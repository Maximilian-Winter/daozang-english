## Text 1: 黃帝太一八門逆順生死訣
### "Yellow Emperor's Taiyi Eight Gates Forward-Reverse Life-Death Formula"

### Core Yang/Yin Dun Formulas (陽遁陰遁公式)

This text provides the foundational formulas for determining gate positions:

#### Yang Dun (陽遁) - Forward Movement
```
阳遁甲子午顺行甲丙戌庚壬
Yang Dun follows Jiazi, advancing forward through Jia, Bing, Xu, Geng, Ren

甲子一休 - Jiazi: Palace 1, Xiu (Rest) Gate
甲戌三伤 - Jiaxu: Palace 3, Shang (Injury) Gate
甲申六开 - Jiashen: Palace 6, Kai (Open) Gate
甲午八生 - Jiawu: Palace 8, Sheng (Life) Gate
甲辰一休 - Jiachen: Palace 1, Xiu Gate
甲寅三寅 - Jiayin: Palace 3
```

#### Yin Dun (陰遁) - Reverse Movement
```
阴遁甲子午逆行乙丁己辛癸
Yin Dun follows Jiazi, moving in reverse through Yi, Ding, Ji, Xin, Gui

甲子九景 - Jiazi: Palace 9, Jing (Scenery) Gate
甲戌七惊 - Jiaxu: Palace 7, Jing (Shock) Gate
甲申四杜 - Jiashen: Palace 4, Du (Block) Gate
甲午二死 - Jiawu: Palace 2, Si (Death) Gate
甲辰九景 - Jiachen: Palace 9, Jing Gate
甲寅七惊 - Jiayin: Palace 7, Jing Gate
```

### Palace-Solar Term Correspondences (宮位節氣)

```
一宮冬至 - Palace 1: Winter Solstice
三宮春分 - Palace 3: Spring Equinox
六宮立冬 - Palace 6: Start of Winter
八宮立春 - Palace 8: Start of Spring
九宮夏至 - Palace 9: Summer Solstice
七宮秋分 - Palace 7: Autumn Equinox
四宮立夏 - Palace 4: Start of Summer
二宮立秋 - Palace 2: Start of Autumn
```

### The Turtle Method (龜法)

An alternative arrangement:
```
9-Summer Solstice, 2-Start of Autumn, 7-Autumn Equinox, 6-Start of Winter
4-Start of Summer, 3-Spring Equinox, 8-Start of Spring, 1-Winter Solstice
```

### Talismanic Practices (符咒法)

#### 神景朝真散結保胎符 (Spirit Scenery Talisman)

**Procedure:**
1. Face east on one's natal day
2. Write 60 talismans
3. Seal with yellow wax in 60 pieces
4. Use good cinnabar as base
5. Each morning, face east, hold talisman in palm

**Incantation:**
```
神虛天真，王液元津
上清華房，元始太真
妙入太霞，七晨丹景
北都受煙，我為上皇
辟舍魔群，千千去穢
凶惡不存，萬萬魔王
護命剪形，急急如玉清上景勑攝

Spirit of emptiness, heavenly truth, royal fluid, primal essence
Upper clarity's flower chamber, Primordial Beginning's great truth
Mysteriously entering the great rosy clouds, seven dawn cinnabar scenes
Northern capital receives the smoke, I become the Supreme Emperor
Expelling demon hordes, removing ten thousand impurities
Evil cannot remain, ten thousand demon kings
Protect life, cut form, urgently as commanded by Jade Clarity's Upper Scenery
```

### 孤虛法 (Void and Solitary Method)

This section describes the **Gu Xu** (孤虛) technique, legendarily transmitted by the Nine Heavens Dark Lady (九天玄女) to General Li Jing (李靖) in the year 627 CE (貞觀二年).

**Principle:** "背孤擊虛" - Turn your back to Gu (solitary), strike toward Xu (void). This allows one woman to match ten men in battle.

#### Six Jia Cycle Gu-Xu Positions:
```
甲戌旬：孤在申酉，虛在寅卯
甲子旬：孤在戌亥，虛在辰巳
甲申旬：孤在午未，虛在子丑
甲午旬：孤在辰巳，虛在戌亥
甲辰旬：孤在寅卯，虛在申酉
甲寅旬：孤在子丑，虛在午未
```

辰日：卯為孤，酉為虛
巳日：辰為孤，戌為虛
午日：巳為孤，亥為虛
未日：午為孤，子為虛
申日：未為孤，丑為虛
酉日：申為孤，寅為虛
戌日：酉為孤，卯為虛
亥日：戌為孤，辰為虛
```

### Monthly Directional Fortune (旺氣)

```
正、五、九月 - Months 1, 5, 9: Fortune in South
二、六、十月 - Months 2, 6, 10: Fortune in East
三、七、十一月 - Months 3, 7, 11: Fortune in North
四、八、十二月 - Months 4, 8, 12: Fortune in West
```

### Xiu Gate Placement by Day (休門三日移一宮)

The Xiu Gate moves through palaces every three days in a 60-day cycle:

```
甲子、乙丑、丙寅 - Xiu Gate in Kan (坎)
丁卯、戊辰、己巳 - Xiu Gate in Kun (坤)
庚午、辛未、壬申 - Xiu Gate in Zhen (震)
癸酉、甲戌、乙亥 - Xiu Gate in Xun (巽)
丙子、丁丑、戊寅 - Xiu Gate in Qian (乾)
己卯、庚辰、辛巳 - Xiu Gate in Dui (兌)
壬午、癸未、甲申 - Xiu Gate in Gen (艮)
乙酉、丙戌、丁亥 - Xiu Gate in Li (離)
```
(Pattern continues through the 60-day cycle)

### Gate Entry Formula (入門起例)

```
甲壬戊子坎中游，丁辛乙卯走坤頭
丙寅配子歸乾上，己癸卯前因兌流
甲庚戊午元居震，酉癸丁辛入巽求
丙壬癸午家邊艮，乙已雞鳴離未休

Jia, Ren, Wu with Zi travel through Kan
Ding, Xin, Yi with Mao go to Kun's head
Bing, Yin matched with Zi return to Qian above
Ji, Gui before Mao flow through Dui
...
```

City walls invisible, closed with golden gates
Ten thousand evils dare not interfere
Six Ding at my sides, Six Jia before and behind
Protect my body, urgently as commanded
```

## Text 2: 黃帝太一八門入式訣
### "Yellow Emperor's Taiyi Eight Gates Entry Method Formula"

*Three volumes (三卷)*

### Volume 1 (卷上): Yang and Yin Sequences

#### Yang Trigram Forward Movement (陽卦順行)

```
甲子甲辰常起一，甲寅甲戌三宮出
甲申六宮甲午八，得之順行無不吉
所到之處休為頭，休字太一神明休
生傷杜景死驚開，此是輪排莫疏失
將戊加休干逆行，須把八門順行日

Jiazi and Jiachen always start at 1
Jiayin and Jiaxu emerge at Palace 3
Jiashen at 6, Jiawu at 8
Following forward movement, nothing is inauspicious
Where you arrive, Xiu (Rest) leads
The character Xiu means Taiyi's divine rest
Sheng, Shang, Du, Jing, Si, Jing, Kai - this is the rotation sequence
Place Wu on Xiu, stems reverse, gates advance by day
```

#### Yin Trigram Reverse Movement (陰卦逆行)

```
甲子甲辰離九宮，甲寅甲戌兌七首
甲申四宮甲午二，尋究得門依次守
從九至一名逆行，順時至一還歸九
得門更自合三奇，便為吉路無凶醜

Jiazi and Jiachen at Li Palace 9
Jiayin and Jiaxu at Dui 7 leading
Jiashen at Palace 4, Jiawu at 2
Investigate the gates, follow in order
From 9 to 1 is called reverse movement
Following time to 1, return again to 9
Obtain the gate, combine with Three Wonders
This becomes the auspicious path with no misfortune
```

### The Three Wonders (三奇)

```
天有三奇日月星 - Heaven has Three Wonders: Sun, Moon, Stars
地有三奇乙丙丁 - Earth has Three Wonders: Yi, Bing, Ding
人有三奇神氣精 - Humans have Three Wonders: Spirit, Qi, Essence
門有三奇開休生 - Gates have Three Wonders: Kai, Xiu, Sheng

合乙丙丁便是吉 - Combining Yi, Bing, Ding is auspicious
門值三奇宜出行 - When gates meet Three Wonders, suitable for travel
三奇路徑為三教 - The Three Wonders path represents the Three Teachings
其餘景內落傍生 - The rest within Jing fall to side paths
```

### Gate Recognition Method (識認門戶法)

```
休門迢迢入爭方 - Xiu Gate leads far into contested realms
生門必定赴仙鄉 - Sheng Gate certainly leads to immortal lands
開路為官掌法印 - Kai Gate opens paths to official seals
性作修羅門入傷 - Violent nature enters through Shang Gate (becomes Asura)
景內下為人倫道 - Within Jing below is the human ethical path
驚開鬼趣受恓惶 - Jing and Kai lead to ghost realms of misery
長記杜門喑啞道 - Remember Du Gate leads to mute paths
死為地獄入鑊湯 - Si Gate leads to hell's boiling cauldrons
```

### Recognizing Omens at Death (識認前程臨境法)

This section describes what visions indicate future rebirth:

| Vision | Rebirth Destination |
|--------|---------------------|
| Banners and flowers | Donkey or horse |
| Bells, chimes, drums | Dog, chicken, goat (licentious rebirth) |
| Vajra and Rakshasa | Western heavenly realms |
| White clouds, cranes, turtles | Three Purities as celestial immortal |
| Riding clouds and qi | Flying immortal |
| Eight treasures, five flavors | Hungry ghost realm |
| Purple or white banners | Human realm |
| Following beauties | Yellow Springs (underworld) |
| Weapons, flags, horses | Asura realm |
| Clear mind, nothing | Great Luo Heaven |

### Du Gate Entry for Avoiding Calamity (杜門入法)

```
入得杜門從七步，過不見形人不遇
無來無去在定中，因此臧從至真住
住即來卻不輪迴，從茲斷卻三塗路
曉了名為物外人，保身不葬杜門塞

Enter Du Gate, take seven steps
Pass through unseen, encounter no one
Neither coming nor going, in samadhi
Thus hidden, dwelling in ultimate truth
Dwelling yet coming, not transmigrating
From here cut off the three evil paths
Understanding this, become a person beyond things
Protect the body, not buried, Du Gate blocks
```

### Difficulty Avoidance Incantation (避難躲閃入杜門咒)

```
太上曰：子欲過度三災九厄，應作是言：
我以天為父，地為母，吾居其中，常為赤子
日為功曹，月為主簿
雷公電母，在吾前後
風伯雨師，在吾左右
六甲直符，周匝圍達
青龍扶吾左，白虎扶吾右
朱雀在吾前，玄武從吾後
北斗覆吾頭，天罡指吾足
騰蛇在吾手，與吾滅殃咎
吾居丹房中，太乙為吾偶
左三右七，戴九履一
二四為吾肩，六八為吾足
吾居中間，以為腹實
吾今劫下，千邪萬鬼，各還本鄉
當吾者死，背吾者亡
速出奔逃，隱匿探藏
天丁力士，斬鬼不祥
急急如太上老君勸攝

The Supreme One says: If you wish to cross the Three Disasters and Nine Calamities, speak thus:
I take Heaven as father, Earth as mother, dwelling between as eternal infant
The Sun as Merit Officer, Moon as Chief Secretary
Thunder Lord and Lightning Mother before and behind me
Wind Uncle and Rain Master at my sides
Six Jia Direct Envoys surrounding completely
Azure Dragon supports my left, White Tiger my right
Vermilion Bird before me, Dark Warrior follows behind
Northern Dipper covers my head, Tiangang points to my feet
Flying Serpent in my hand, eliminating my disasters
I dwell in the Cinnabar Chamber, Taiyi as my companion
Left 3, Right 7, Wearing 9, Treading 1
2 and 4 are my shoulders, 6 and 8 are my feet
I dwell in the center as the belly's fullness
I now command all evil spirits to return to their homes
Those who face me die, those who turn from me perish
Swiftly flee, hide and conceal
Heavenly Ding warriors slay inauspicious ghosts
Urgently as Taishang Laojun commands
```

城郭堅固，如同金關
千凶萬惡，莫敢來干
急急如律令

Yang side of Mount Tai, Yin side of Mount Heng
Bandits don't rise, tigers and wolves don't intrude
Heavenly Emperor serves me, makes me conceal form
City walls firm and solid, like golden barriers
Ten thousand evils dare not approach
Urgently as commanded

小人見我，戰戰惶惶
男女見我，供列酒漿
謀我者死，當我者亡
今日禹步，上應天罡
玉女侍傍，下辟不祥
萬精厭伏，所向無殃
所治者安，所攻者勝
所擊者破，所求者得
所願者成
急急如律令

Six Jia, Six Spirits, Twelve Hour Periods, carry me in travel
Arrive at the desired place, guard left and right
Follow in movement and stillness, rise with each action
Expel bandits and thieves, ghosts and sprites perish
When gentlemen see me, joy doubles
When petty people see me, they tremble in fear
When men and women see me, they offer wine and drink
Those who plot against me die, those who face me perish
Today's Yu Steps, above responding to Tiangang
Jade Women attend beside, below repelling inauspiciousness
Ten thousand spirits suppressed, wherever I go no calamity
What I govern is peaceful, what I attack I conquer
What I strike is broken, what I seek I obtain
What I wish is accomplished
Urgently as commanded
```

### Jade Woman Exit Incantation

```
玉女玉女，護我保我
玉女玉女，衛我侍我
無令百鬼中傷
行到某處，人鬼莫能識我
窈窈冥冥，莫視其形
人見我者，以為非人，以為束薪
人不聞其聲，鬼不見其精
善我者福，惡我者殃
百邪鬼賊，當我者死，值我者亡
千人以上，萬人之中
見我者喜悅
獨開我門，而塞地戶
急急如律令

Jade Woman Jade Woman, protect and preserve me
Jade Woman Jade Woman, guard and attend me
Let no hundred ghosts harm me
Traveling to any place, neither humans nor ghosts can recognize me
Dark and mysterious, none see my form
Those who see me think I am not human, think I am bundled firewood
People don't hear my voice, ghosts don't see my essence
Those who favor me receive blessings, those who hate me receive calamity
Hundred evil ghost-thieves, those who face me die, those who meet me perish
Among thousands, among ten thousands
Those who see me are joyful
Alone open my gate, block the Earth Door
Urgently as commanded
```

## Relationship to Modern Qimen Dunjia

These texts provide the **classical foundation** for the calculation methods implemented in the framework:

| Classical Element | Framework Implementation |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Yang/Yin Dun sequences | `YANG_DUN_SEQUENCE`, `YIN_DUN_SEQUENCE` |
| Solar Term palaces | `SOLAR_TERM_JU_MAPPING` |
| Gate positions | `GATE_BASE_PALACES` |
| Six Jia cycles | `JIA_CONCEALMENT`, `get_jia_for_day_index()` |
| Three Wonders | `THREE_WONDERS = ['乙', '丙', '丁']` |
| Six Yi | `SIX_YI = ['戊', '己', '庚', '辛', '壬', '癸']` |

The ritual and talismanic sections represent the **spiritual practice** dimension that complements the mathematical calculations, providing context for why certain configurations are considered auspicious or inauspicious.
