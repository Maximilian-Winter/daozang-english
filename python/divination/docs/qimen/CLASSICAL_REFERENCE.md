## Historical Background

Qimen Dunjia (奇門遁甲) translates as "Mysterious Gates Escaping Technique." According to legend, it was transmitted by the **Nine Heavens Dark Lady** (九天玄女) to the Yellow Emperor (黃帝) during his war against Chi You (蚩尤).

The system belongs to the **Three Styles** (三式) of Chinese metaphysical calculation:

| System | Chinese | Focus |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Taiyi | 太乙 | Heaven's patterns, fate |
| Qimen | 奇門 | Earth's patterns, strategy |
| Liuren | 六壬 | Human patterns, affairs |

```

## Interpretation Principles

### The Five Factors

When interpreting a Qimen plate, consider five factors in order:

1. **時 Timing** - Is it Yang or Yin Dun? What solar term?
2. **方 Direction** - Which direction is favorable?
3. **門 Gate** - What gate governs the direction?
4. **星 Star** - What star influences it?
5. **神 Spirit** - What spirit is present?

### Hierarchy of Influence

```
門為最要，星次之，神又次之
Gates are most important, stars next, spirits after

First see the Gate - this determines fundamental favorability
Then see the Star - this modifies the quality
Then see the Spirit - this reveals hidden factors
Finally see the Stems - this shows specific dynamics
```

### The Three Auspicious, Three Inauspicious

```
三吉門：開、休、生
Three Auspicious Gates: Kai, Xiu, Sheng

三凶門：死、傷、驚
Three Inauspicious Gates: Si, Shang, Jing

中平門：景、杜
Neutral Gates: Jing (Scenery), Du
```

### Reading the Plate

1. **Establish the Duty Star and Gate (值符、值使)**
   - These show where authority and action focus
   - The palace they occupy is significant

2. **Find the Querent's Palace**
   - For general matters: duty palace
   - For specific matters: related palace (e.g., Palace 8 for wealth)

3. **Check the Target Palace**
   - Where you want to go or what you want to achieve
   - Assess gate, star, spirit, and stems

4. **Examine Relationships**
   - Element relationships between palaces
   - Stem patterns present
   - Special conditions (Fu Yin, Fan Yin)

5. **Synthesize the Reading**
   - Multiple favorable factors = proceed
   - Mixed factors = proceed with caution
   - Multiple unfavorable factors = wait or change approach

---

## Final Words

```
奇門遁甲，非小術也
用之以正，則趨吉避凶
用之以邪，則反受其咎

Qimen Dunjia is not a minor art
Used righteously, it leads to fortune and avoids disaster
Used wickedly, it brings calamity upon oneself

天道無親，常與善人
Heaven's way is impartial, ever favoring the virtuous
```
