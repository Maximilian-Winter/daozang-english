  "full_translation": "**Preface to the Recorded Sayings of the Thirtieth-Generation Celestial Master, Perfected Lord of Empty Tranquility**\n\nWithin the cosmos, the qi of radiant mountains and numinous peaks is concentrated in humanity alone. Yet when humans cultivate the self, what is inwardly contained must manifest outwardly. How could one whose essence is so profoundly stored refrain from giving it voice? Though the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi advocate the abandonment of the body, the rejection of sensory brilliance, and the absolute renunciation of all that ensnares one externally—striving instead to return wholly within—even the Dao of transmitting teachings to the world and establishing guidance must rely upon words to be conveyed and made manifest.\n\nFrom this, we may observe: those who wander beyond the mundane—do they truly regard words as entirely without use? For them, words are like clouds drifting through the vast sky or the faintest ripples upon a limpid abyss, forming patterns with their movement and stillness, yet leaving no trace to be discerned. This differs from the words of the Confucians: when flourishing, their speech is bold and unrestrained, their emotions unbridled; when in adversity, their words are bound by sorrow, their sentiments filled with lament. Nevertheless, the Dao endures through the ages, its spiritual transformations as eternal as Heaven itself. Must one await the presence or absence of words to deem it supreme?\n\nThe Thirtieth-Generation Ancestor, Perfected Lord of Empty Tranquility, possessed innate wisdom and karmic roots, flourishing during the reign of Emperor Huizong, when the court revered the Dao with particular devotion. Between the Chongning and Jingkang eras, the imperial house’s veneration of the Dao was profound, and true immortals emerged in abundance. Among those who ascended and descended in the same era as the Perfected Lord were Xu Shenxi, Wang Wenqing, and Lin Lingsu. In exorcising malevolent spirits, calming tidal disasters, and verifying divine omens—whether bending cypress branches or summoning auspicious signs—they frequently demonstrated extraordinary efficacy. When the nation’s fortunes waned and hardship arose, the Perfected Lord foresaw calamities and portents, and at the sovereign’s command, could summon wind and thunder, drought and rain. His Dao was divinely manifested and renowned, truly sufficient to adorn the celestial court and bestow blessings upon all beings. Though centuries have passed, people still speak of him with admiration today—how could he be compared to those whose fame flickers briefly before vanishing without a trace?\n\nThe *Record of Responses and Transformations* has already documented his meritorious deeds in detail. Yet the Perfected Lord’s teachings for the world, his verses that refine the spirit and awaken the soul, are all capable of rousing the deluded and enlightening the benighted. Had he not wandered in the primordial chaos before the emergence of form, shedding the dust of the world like a cicada molting its shell, utterly free from even the slightest attachment, how could his attainments have reached such heights?\n\nDisciples from all directions recite his words and long to behold them in full, yet regrettably, they have not been preserved in their entirety. Though they were once printed, much has since been lost. Thus, I have gathered them from the famous mountains and re-engraved them upon woodblocks to broaden their transmission. May this enable scholars and seekers to delve beyond the surface of his words, to grasp the secrets of the \"fire talisman\" and fathom the mysteries of lead and mercury, finding in them an everlasting teacher. Proceeding thus into the realm of the Dao and virtue, one may wander the boundless wilderness, the shores of emptiness, amidst towering peaks and ancient forests on a night when the wind is clear and the moon bright. Chanting his ethereal verses, where the pines echo and the springs respond—who can say that the banners of rainbow clouds and the girdles of rosy mists will not descend? How could such words not be transmitted alongside those of Laozi and Zhuangzi?\n\nI, Yu Chu, unworthy heir to this lineage, am hardly capable of fully extolling his virtues. Yet I fear that some of his teachings may be lost, and so I humbly place this preface at the beginning, awaiting the brush of a master to complete the task.\n\nWritten on an auspicious day after the Zhongyuan Festival in the twenty-eighth year of the Hongwu reign (1395), by the Perfected One of Orthodox Unity, Successor to the Dao, Expounder of Non-Action, Inheritor of the Radiant Ancestral Teachings, Leader of the Daoist Religion, and Forty-Third-Generation Celestial Master, Successor to the Han Lineage, Yu Chu, who respectfully bows and offers this preface after fasting and purification.\n\n---\n\n**Recorded Sayings of the Thirtieth-Generation Celestial Master, Perfected Lord of Empty Tranquility, Volume One**\nCompiled by Yu Chu, Forty-Third-Generation Celestial Master and Successor\n\n**Essays**\n**On the Mind**\n\nThe mind is the root of all dharmas, the master of the nine apertures, the foundation of life and death, and the source of good and evil. It arises together with Heaven and Earth, serving as the sovereign of spirit and luminosity. Some call it the *Perfected Lord*, for it commands the entire body. Some call it *True Constancy*, for it transcends antiquity and modernity without decay. Some call it *True Suchness*, for it abides in stillness, unmoved. When activated, it pervades the six directions; when abandoned, its whereabouts are unknown. Vast beyond measure, the cosmos lies within it, and it shares the same essence as the Great Void. Minute beyond limit, it enters the tip of an autumn hair, yet cannot be sought through form.\n\nThis is what we call our fundamental mind, the original self before the empty kalpas. Yet what, truly, is it? Vague and obscure, elusive and indistinct—it cannot be known by intellect, nor grasped by perception. We forcefully name it the *Dao*, forcefully name it *spirit*, forcefully name it *mind*—nothing more. From this, can we not see its greatness? Can we not see its preciousness?\n\nYet why, though it revolves through the Three Realms, passing in and out of life and death, cannot free itself? For when a single thought stirs within, the six senses flow outward without cease, failing to transcend evil even as it transcends good. Thus arise the retributions of heaven and hell, the karmic consequences, the endless cycles of the Six Paths with no hope of escape. How grievous! How lamentable!\n\nThe enlightened, however, are not thus.\n\nThus, through fasting and abstinence, one illuminates their virtue with spirit—once the One True [qi] settles into clarity, the ten thousand calamities dissolve. Laozi said: *\"Attain utmost emptiness, guard stillness firmly; the ten thousand things arise together, and I observe their return.\"* All things flourish in abundance, each returning to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called restoring the mandate; restoring the mandate is called constancy. To know constancy is called clarity; not knowing constancy, one acts recklessly and invites misfortune.\n\nWhat is called *constancy* is that which transcends past and present without decay. What is called *recklessness* is the moment a single thought arises. Zhuangzi said: *\"Once a thing is made, to return again to the root—is this not difficult?\"* In the *Yijing*, is this not the way of the *Great Person*?\n\nFrom this point onward, be cautious in speech, moderate in diet, eliminate defilement and halt thoughts. Still the mind and guard the One; embrace emptiness, tranquility, and non-action. Withdraw the gaze and reverse the hearing; harmonize with radiance and merge with dust. A fleeting thought’s arising is the illness; its non-continuation is the cure. Fear not the arising of thoughts—only the delay in awakening. Like hair that must be combed daily, so too the body and mind—why not tend to them thus? In walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, let not a single moment pass without vigilance.\n\nThe land of *Nothing-Whatsoever*, the realm of *Huaxu*—there shall I wander.\n\n**Opening the Altar, Initiating the Rite**\n\nHave you not seen the thousand-foot ladder leaning against the steep ridge? Step upon it, and you may reach the summit; place it upon flat ground, and even a low wall becomes insurmountable. The ladder is not insufficient—it is the ground upon which it stands that is amiss. A ship of ten thousand *hu* rests securely upon the great river; with it, one may cross oceans; cast it upon a shallow stream, and even a few paces become impassable. The ship is not incapable—it is the waters that bear it which are unfit.\n\nThe scriptures of my lineage—above, they can move heaven and earth; below, they can shake mountains and rivers. In brightness, they command dragons and tigers; in darkness, they subdue ghosts and spirits. In merit, they can revive the decayed; in cultivation, they can transcend life and death. In greatness, they can stabilize nations; in smallness, they can avert disasters. Yet their attainment lies in practice, and their loss lies in negligence. Thus, the craftsman’s tools and measuring line cannot guarantee skill; the master’s model and standard cannot ensure conduct. Yet man’s karmic obstructions—emotional entanglements, demonic hindrances, the snares of fame and profit—accumulate daily without respite.\n\nBorn without parents, who is truly kin beyond the body? Each day requires only clothing and food—what use is hoarding? Glory, wealth, and honor are like a candle in the wind; beloved wives and children are like crows roosting on the same branch. Fine carriages and grand steeds cannot accompany you on the long night’s journey; beautiful concubines and radiant wives cannot rescue you from the ninefold darkness. Carved walls and towering halls, white jade and yellow gold—though they may belong to you for a time, they cannot be kept forever.\n\nVast are the Three Realms, bustling are the Four Forms of Life—once swept away by the passing current, you sink forever in the sea of suffering. Do not wait until the underworld’s emissary arrives to summon your name from the black ledger. By then, regret will be too late.\n\nYou have left your homeland and parents to draw near the gates of masters and teachers, shouldering your burden through frost and rain, baring your liver and cleansing your gall to behold the true wind of the Most High. You have pledged faith and submitted your name to receive the celestial master’s secret scriptures. From this day forward, cast off the old and renew yourself daily. Though your name may be recorded in the highest heavens, your body remains entangled in the world’s net. Sever past attachments gradually; let future grievances pass without entanglement. Only then—dissolving conflicts, blunting sharpness, aiding beings, and saving others—nurture tranquility, preserve spirit, and still the mind.\n\nOnce the green vine is cut, the fire of the *monkey-mind* must cease; when deluded thoughts do not arise, the *horse-mind* within naturally halts. Know the body as affliction; see life as the true. The yang does not cherish birth; the yin does not conceal death. Thus, the great wind cannot stir you, and the kalpa’s fire cannot burn you. Thoughts extinguished from the Three Corpses, nature untainted by the Five Desires.\n\nThe Jasper Terrace and the Park of Paradise become your homeland; the sea of love and mountain of affection are the livelihoods of others. Human life is uncertain—who can guarantee a full span of years? The days and months pass swiftly; to act is already late. If you delay further, you will only grow feeble and despondent. Having fortunately arrived at this treasure mountain, do not return empty-handed.\n\nI humbly pray that the imperial foundation remain ever firm, the sage’s longevity extend without end, the four barbarians lay down their arms, and the ten thousand kingdoms come to pay homage. Once selfless transformation is achieved, then the ten directions, the Three Realms, the Six Paths, the Four Forms of Life, and all sentient beings shall ascend the shore of the Dao.\n\nNow the altar is prepared, and the rite of initiation is at hand. I dare not linger before the disciple. I implore you—take care.\n\n**Reply to the Prefect of Chizhou**\n\n**Reply to Magistrate Ma Xiugen**\n\nI have received your letter, and learned with joy that you have been transferred to Chengdu. Though the journey may have wearied you slightly, your path is now secure and your circumstances settled. The ritual register has been prepared, and I must personally attend to the conferral of the sacred pledge to complete the ceremony. I take this opportunity to convey my sincerest regards; Xiugen, you will soon depart, and I shall send a separate reply.\n\nThe thirteenth day of the sixth month,\n[Your name] respectfully addresses Prefect Wang.\n\n---\n\n**Reply to the Prefect of Zhen Ding Prefecture**\n\nIt has been long since we last exchanged words, and now I receive your letter with sorrow. Yet I rejoice to hear of your well-being, which has attained perfect harmony. I am delighted to learn that Minister An of your prefecture, who from youth has followed the Dao and devoted himself to Confucian learning, stands as a towering wave in the vast ocean of scholarship and a peerless luminary in the forest of letters. I await the day his great talents are put to use, fulfilling the hopes of all. Should I have the chance to meet him, I would seek his guidance with eagerness.\n\n[Your name] respectfully addresses the Prefect of Zhen Ding Prefecture.\n\n---\n\n**Reply to Tang Mingquan**\n\nI have long admired your illustrious name, yet our exchange of profound discourse has been hindered. Gazing toward the Dipper in my dreams, I yearn for your presence, but the winds and clouds keep us apart. Though we have not yet met, I am honored to receive your letter, overwhelmed by your sincerity, and unworthy of such kindness.\n\nI trust that Mingquan, a lofty immortal of the Jade Palace and a guest of the Jasper Terrace, has cast aside the shackles of fame and profit to master the pivot of Dao and virtue. You preserve the formless and nurture the spirit, seeking the luminous pearl in the Red Waters. With tranquility, you cultivate your nature, uniting with the supreme principle in the land of Huaxu. You should further aid those in peril, guide the ignorant, fulfill the virtue of the perfected, and manifest the teachings of the Most High. Then, perhaps, we may ride feathered canopies and dragon scales together to visit the realm of Huayang, or join the ranks of cloud banners and rainbow standards in the celestial expanse of the Great Ultimate.\n\n---\n\n**Reply to Prefect Lin**\n\nThe methods of practice previously transmitted to you were the oral instructions of a sacred master, and their efficacy depends on diligent cultivation. Though you may not ascend in broad daylight, you will attain an unblemished body, prolong your years in this world, and achieve immortality.\n\nWith deepest reverence, I offer my blessings.\n[Your name] respectfully addresses Daoist Companion Lin.\n\n**Reply to Lin Lingsu**\n\nThe gourd and bamboo hat are indifferent things—what use are clouds and mist? The golden gates and crimson haze may seem like celestial wanderings, yet only white stones and limpid springs preserve the mountain’s true tranquility. Our meeting was but a fleeting convergence of duckweed and driftwood, while each of us finds our own path to freedom. Divided by rivers and mountains, seasons have turned again and again; idle fame grows daily, while my wandering traces remain scattered.\n\nI reflect that the Dao is fundamentally natural, and spirit is nothing apart from it. The bright moon courses through the azure sky, yet its light has no form; white clouds drift over green mountains, yet their hue leaves no trace. The silkworm enters its cocoon and the moth departs; the sparrow plunges into water and the clam is born. Transformation occurs in an instant, cycles follow like echoes—no need to imitate, for rise and fall come naturally to the round and square alike. The myriad phenomena know birth and decay, as spring flowers wither in autumn; the single qi waxes and wanes, as night dew vanishes at dawn.\n\nI drift across the five lakes in a small boat, soar over the three isles on a black crane. Ascending high requires distance, descending low presents no difficulty—only by not obscuring the subtle signs does one become a person of true understanding.\n\nYour plum-scented letter, delivered by courier, has just arrived, and I am fortunate that your serene harmony aligns with my fading recollections.\n\n**Memorial from the Celestial Master to the Divine Brother**\n\nIn ancient times, after the Three Heavens, fathers departed and sons succeeded; now, among the masters of the registers, elder brothers step aside and younger brothers assume their place. As your humble servant dons the vestments, I pray the Great Ultimate will witness and know: though I seek to store blessings within this unworthy self, I can never forget the great gift bestowed.\n\nI am at a loss for words.\n\n**Memorial of Gratitude for Official Appointment**\n\nThe times do not wait for men, and I regret being favored by celestial grace. The kindness extends to my kin, bringing joy to my private household. I am ashamed that such honor truly overwhelms me, and my joy is mingled with awe and trepidation.\n\nI recall that from the time I was but a youth with unbound hair, I was blessed to receive your radiant light. Seven years have passed, and three imperial decrees have been issued—granting me a dwelling with cloud-browed eaves to facilitate my devotions, and bestowing the *Yuli Jing* of the Xuanhe reign to aid my cultivation and practice. Then came the grace of the \"Leaking Spring,\" extending even to my elder brother of the same womb, whose encounter with the boundless was beyond any repayment I could offer.\n\nThis is all due to your singular elevation of the teachings, your boundless compassion that knows no distinction, and your profound regard for the bonds of heaven and kin, which you have extended even to me. Though precedent exists, it still astonishes the age. My devotion, like that of a dog or horse, is what I must offer; the splendor of the phoenix and simurgh is beyond all measure.\n\nWith the sincerity of incense and flame, I pray for the eternal longevity of the imperial hills. Gazing toward the heavens and longing for the sagely presence, my emotions are as urgent as if I stood at the edge of an abyss.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\n*End of the First Scroll of the Recorded Sayings of the Thirty-Sixth Celestial Master, the Vacant Tranquility Perfected Lord*\n\n*Second Scroll of the Recorded Sayings of the Thirty-Sixth Celestial Master, the Vacant Tranquility Perfected Lord*\n\n*Compiled by his successor, the Forty-Third Celestial Master Yu Chu*\n\n**Five-Character Ancient Verse**\n\n*Written in Response to Shi Yuangui’s Discourse on the Gull and Roc*\n\n**Five-Character Ancient Verse**\n\n*Written in Response to Shi Yuangui’s Discourse on the Gull and Roc*\n\nSoaring but a few *ren* in flight—\nhow differs it from ninety thousand *li*?\nThe Great Dao drifts, nameless,\nwithout \"that\" or \"this.\"\n\nAlas, Master Yuangui,\nsuch words near their end.\nAll things arise from the Supreme Ultimate;\nthe steadfast set their lofty aims.\nYet gull and roc,\nin debate, miss the highest truth.\nForms shift and change,\nbut never leave the Six Directions’ bounds.\nLeaping or soaring, traversing paths—\nwhy mock near or far?\nOnly then is known the *xiaoyaoyou*,\nits distant gleam revealing the profound intent.\n\nThe discourse done, the four windows stilled,\nwords forgotten, the desk left empty.\n\n---\n\n**[The Prefect’s Visit]**\nCommissioner Xu of the Bureau of Operations sought the Recluse Li in his district, then came to visit Shangqing. There, we boiled tea and spoke at length, parting only at midnight. His words were a delight to the ear—truly grand, lofty, and transformative. Even the mountains and rivers seemed more radiant. The next day, we bade farewell.\n\nAt the time, it was the fifth year of Xuanhe. Here follows a brief account:\n\nThe west wind first stirs, light,\nwhite dew still glistening.\nA man floats down the great river,\neastward to Raoyang.\nHe bears a decree from the Ninefold Throne,\nand so seeks the cinnabar chambers.\nMountain *qi* gleams with dragon and tiger,\ngreen forests stretch beyond the clouds.\nBy chance, he meets me—\nour discourse sharp as frost.\nDusk falls, and we take up candles;\nseated beneath the new moon’s chill.\nThe jade toad veils the misty scene,\ngolden breezes waft celestial fragrance.\nShadows fall like hometown clouds,\nbrilliant, offering wondrous omens.\nThe Six Directions share no other hue,\nthe Five Peaks bathe in autumn’s light.\nA brocade-robed exile in the dusty world,\nriding a whale, he parts the river’s beams.\nYou await the fulfillment of our mystic pact,\nsoaring ethereal in the empty sky.\n\n---\n\n**Tang Mingquan Takes His Family into the Dao**\nHow fine, your long-held detachment,\nyour talent unused for office!\nAmid white clouds, chickens and dogs,\nyou lead your family to wander here.\nYour hidden depths are extraordinary—\nprofound principles may be attained in stillness.\nAlas, the enlightened lord’s decree\ncould not sway your resolve.\nTransformed into a river-and-sea talent,\nutterly free of worldly dust.\nI hear of Magistrate Jingyang,\nwho raised his household beyond the mortal realm.\nSuch matters lie in earnest cultivation—\nstrive on, scion of the Tang!\n\n---\n\n**A Eulogy on the Dragon-Transforming Pavilion, Presented to the Daoist Master of Qingcheng**\nA chamber free of dust,\nharmonious winds sway jade bamboo.\nThe desk holds only zither and books,\nuntrammeled, apart from the vulgar world.\nNow and then, he wields his brush,\ntranscribing talismans and tallying records.\nOr he joins Master Wu Xuan,\nplaying two or three games of *liubo*.\nAt night, beneath the moon beyond the woods,\nhe plays divine melodies upon his knee.\nDeep into the night, his interest unspent,\nhe slowly unfurls the scrolls.\nCome, Master of Qingcheng,\nas clouds part, distant mountains turn green.\n\n---\n\n**In Response to Yuan Gui’s Farewell**\nJust arrived at the towering peaks,\nI ascend again the verdant heights.\nTuning the zither’s green strings to \"White Snow,\"\nin stillness, I pluck \"Yellow Bell.\"\nTreading the path of the ancients,\npursuing the traces of immortals.\nSince coming here, I’ve known abundant fortune—\nyet I trust in each other’s carefree ease.\nWhere is there no joy?\nThis heart knows its course.\nLike a single slice of moon\nhanging on the ten-thousand-year pine.\n\n---\n\n**Thinking of the Elder of Qingcheng**\nSince parting from the Elder of Qingcheng,\nnow several months have passed.\nThe scorching sky, spring’s breath waning,\nmountain blossoms swiftly scatter.\nTime and again, I yearn and gaze,\nwestward, pacing the jade pavilion.\nSurely he lingers among men,\nwhere pipes and songs still revel in delight.\nReturn, companion of the world beyond—\nfulfill our pact at Green Cliff.\nThe setting sun flashes its lingering glow,\nlotus rising from golden carving.\n\n---\n\n**In Response to Yuan Gui’s Encouragement**\nYour words, sir, cite the ancients,\nmaking clear the Dao resides here—\nwithout action, yet goodness arrives.\nNow you have truly attained it,\noffering music to seek true knowledge.\nA single phrase reveals your nature,\nthough words can scarcely contain it.\nI know you have mastered Lao and Zhuang,\nstriding through the vast wilds by day.\nIn spirited discourse on the mystery within mystery,\nyou stand unbounded, without limit.\nTo learn, one must have something to await—\nnot contending with the myriad demons.\nGazing at the scene, as if knowing,\nwhy marvel at the strange or uncanny?\nDoubts dispelled, trust is born—\nthen you are truly a good man.\nTake goodness as your teacher,\nand the celestial truth may be attained in stillness.\nMen still debate rank and station,\nbut the affairs of immortals should follow spontaneity.\nIf fate decrees one surpasses the common,\nwhy wait for death to end all?\nThe Great Dao is no empty illusion—\nluminous, it stands above the ten thousand things.\nHearing this once, I feel\nmy spirit refreshed, my soul invigorated.\nCease debating depth or shallowness—\nthese words express a heart sincere.\nThe times are such that I am fallen,\nyet I cherish this saying.\nThough others may scoff in passing,\nthey cannot fault its kindness.\nFortunate to differ from the vulgar,\nI ponder these matters deeply.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Magistrate Zhang on Reducing Food Expenses**\nNo need for lavish fare—\nthe ancients prized moderation.\nOne meal’s sufficiency, what more to seek?\nThe Eight Delicacies are not my desire.\nBefore the rhinoceros chopsticks are laid,\nI have already forfeited my life’s allotment.\nThe Creator apportions to each their measure,\nhow much or little, fixed in number.\nThink further of those starving on the road—\nall from lack of food.\nMaster Zhuang valued the pigeon’s meal—\nthis passage should be read again and again.\n\n---\n\n**Also on Reducing Clothing**\nClothing should suit the season—\nwinter furs and summer linen.\nConsider the diligent practitioner,\nwho at first cares not for finery.\nLight silks and fine brocades,\nnew styles, their prices varied.\nA few thousand coins for each bolt,\nclumsy tailors hacking at random.\nA trifling misfit, yet the heart is displeased.\nHave you known the poor,\nwhose skin cracks in winter and summer alike?\n\n*End of the Second Scroll of the Recorded Sayings of the Thirty-Sixth Celestial Master, the Vacant Tranquility Perfected Lord*\n\n*Third Scroll of the Recorded Sayings of the Thirty-Sixth Celestial Master, the Vacant Tranquility Perfected Lord*\n\n**The Song of the Great Dao**\n\nThe Dao is not far—it dwells within the body.\nAll things are empty, yet nature is not void.\nIf nature remains unvoid, harmonious qi abides;\nqi returns to the primal sea, and life knows no end.\n\nTo keep the spirit within the body,\nlet not a single thing linger in the numinous terrace.\nIf things remain, the spirit grows unclear,\ndraining vitality and wasting sinew and bone.\n\nThe spirit guides qi, qi sustains form—\nno need for miscellaneous arts to attain long life.\nArts are easy to know, but the Dao is hard to fathom;\neven when fathomed, one fails to practice it single-mindedly.\nThus, though thousands and tens of thousands study,\nin the end, scarcely one or two succeed.\n\nIf the spirit strays, bring it back;\nwhen the spirit returns, qi naturally follows.\nMorning and evening, thus renewed,\nthe true embryo of the unblemished child is born.\n\n---\n\n**The Song of Emptiness**\n\nEmptiness stretches boundless, without shore or edge,\nsun and moon traverse east and west in mutual farewell.\nHow long will their eastbound farewells and westbound welcomes last?\nIn the realm of birth and death, they flash like lightning.\n\nThe true nature, originally one with emptiness,\nshines bright and clear, free from dimness.\nYet by a single thought, it falls into form,\nlost in the cycle of birth and death, wandering east and west.\n\nAlas, how few in the world awaken!\nDeath brings sorrow, birth brings joy—\nunaware that birth is the root of death,\nrejoicing in the sun’s rise, dreading its fall.\n\nEastward rise and westward fall are the natural way;\ndo not let the heart’s attachments entangle you.\nIf you doubt, observe the sun and moon—\ndawn and dusk, they ceaselessly circle the heavens.\n\nBirth is not arrival, death is not departure;\nnothing arises from dependence, all abides where it dwells.\nThe six paths of rebirth rush in vain—\nthe true person dwells only in emptiness.\n\nWhere the true person dwells, no house stands,\nneighboring wind and moon in pure void.\nDo not say the numinous light is but a speck—\nit encompasses the Dharma realm without omission.\n\nThe Dharma realm, vast beyond bounds,\npervades the tiniest dust, yet holds nothing within.\nHunger, cold, and calamity cannot touch it;\nevery thing, every head, returns to the sovereign.\n\nA heap of dust, a body of a hundred years—\nlike a boat adrift on water, steered by another’s hand.\nSuddenly the boat breaks, the passenger steps ashore;\nthe withered wood, masterless, sinks and drifts.\n\nDo not rot, do not look back—how many rivers have you crossed?\nCountless streams, how many times have you passed this way?\nOnce ashore, burn the boat—no need for it;\nwhy speak of waves as bitter, their green as sorrow?\n\nWhether dwelling in the boat or not, fear not—\nlast night’s wind and thunder shook the mountains.\nEmptiness remains unmoved, ever thus;\nonly when you grasp true emptiness will you not be deluded.\n\nFrom ancient times to now, it stands eternal;\nupending the world, it reveals its full body.\nHaving delivered all beings from the sea of suffering,\nthe message of true emptiness is no inert void.\n\nTransformations unfold without end—\nhear my song within the void,\nan iron serpent soaring to Kunlun’s peak.\n\n---\n\n**The Song of Rest**\n\nRest, rest, rest—cease, cease, cease.\nRest and cease without distinction.\nA thousand subtleties, ten thousand mysteries—\nall teach but one thing: rest and cease.\n\nIf you can rest, if you can cease,\nall entanglements of emotion are severed.\nHunger eats, thirst drinks, weariness sleeps—\nthrough ten thousand deaths and a thousand births, no concern remains.\n\nThe sages of old, the wise and enlightened,\ntheir single nature endures through eons.\nRadiant light illumines, merging with true emptiness—\nbeyond rest and cessation, nothing else remains.\n\nThose who plant seeds in hell,\nwho weave karmic debts,\ntheir six senses burn like raging fire.\nClinging to self, contending with others, blind to rest and cessation,\nthey willingly endure dismemberment and tongue extraction.\n\nRest and cease—this is the true oral formula,\nbeyond foolishness, wisdom, skill, or clumsiness.\nFrom ancient teachers, the truth is this:\nthey lamented those who cultivated without meeting a kindred heart—who would reveal it?\n\nRest is not rest, cease is not cease—\nthe great function manifests without pretense.\nIt governs the primal transformation, leaving no trace,\nencompassing emptiness, transcending arising and ceasing.\n\nNeither rest nor cease—\nrest and cease are but forced words.\nTo know true rest and true cessation,\nlook to the flawless moon of mid-autumn.\n\n---\n\n**Composed at Qiantang**\n\nCrimson clouds reflect the vermilion balustrade,\nwhite clouds veil the green mountains.\nWorldly folk never come here—\na pair of cranes dance at the brushwood gate.\n\nA jade zither plays one tune, poems flow in numbers;\nthe mountain boy boils tea, the stove emits no smoke.\nLonging for the world’s pleasures, I wandered away—\nhow many years have passed since I left this grotto heaven?\n\nOn the Xiang River, the moon begins to pale;\nby the Xiang’s banks, the wind’s touch is clear.\nThe jade flute’s broken notes choke with sorrow—\nhow much grief does the frosty embankment hold?\n\nHuman life is but floating clouds.\nThe immortals’ spring remains—\nreturn, return! Rejoice in my true self.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Yuan Gui’s \"Let Them Sing as They Will\"**\n\nLet them sing as they will, let them do as they please—\npay them no mind.\nRight or wrong, what can they do to me?\n\nAll day, I idle with friends beyond the world,\nchanting verses, my brush flowing like a torrent.\nUnburdened by worldly ties,\nmy sword in its scabbard subdues yin demons.\n\nI have grasped the mystery of the immortal’s gate—\nlet the sun and moon shuttle like a loom.\nThe toil of the dust is truly vile—\nwho would drift and idle, following the years?\n\nIn quietude, I ponder the affairs of the bustling world—\nin the end, all is but empty striving.\nLet them sing as they will, let them do as they please—\npay them no mind.\n\nJust nurture the primal qi to harmony.\nSometimes, I freely read alchemical texts;\nat leisure, I seek songs on the jade zither.\nMy heart is no stone—it cannot be moved.\nLet worldly opinions breed discord—\nI wear a pine-wood hairpin and hempen robe, content,\nhow could I crave the trappings of luxury?\n\nIn the divine furnace, the golden elixir is refined,\never more serene and abundant.\nWhen merit and practice are complete, we shall depart together,\nsoaring on feathered canopies to brush the River of Stars.\n\nLet them sing as they will, let them do as they please—\npay them no mind.\n\n---\n\n**The Song of the Bellows**\n\nDo not say the Great Dao is effortless action—\nyou must clarify the bellows within the chamber.\nMiss the moment, and not a breath passes;\npurple mists and crimson light swirl in brilliance.\n\nThe Azure Dragon rejoices, the White Tiger balks,\nthe Scarlet Serpent coils around the Black Tortoise’s shell.\nEven if you pass the Tail Gate,\nyou are still barred by the path of Cao Creek.\n\nTwo paths ascend straight to the cinnabar field—\nit is said that above lies the Pavilion of the Three Pure Ones.\nBeneath the pavilion, a jade pool is clearly seen,\nwithin it, the elixir of immortality.\n\nSeize the moment, gather it—\nhaving ingested it, enjoy the bliss of Penglai.\n\n**The Song of Jing Tong Hermitage**\n\nI built my thatched hermitage deep in the mountains,\nand others mock me, calling it Jing Tong.\nYet all the world’s vastness fits within this inch of land,\nas boundless as the empty void.\n\nMy hermitage is neither \"jing\" nor \"tong,\"\nits eight sides translucent, without form or shadow.\nWaxing and waning follow heaven’s decree—\neven the master within knows nothing of it.\n\nSometimes in winter’s wind and snow,\nthe mountain lies desolate all day, no smoke from human hearths.\nThe void is ink-black, day as dark as night,\nyet within the hermitage, light shines in perfect radiance.\n\nSometimes wind and thunder rise from flat earth,\nmountains sink, rivers surge, clouds and mist swirl.\nDragons roar, tigers howl, ten thousand forms clamor—\nwithin the hermitage, emerald stillness rises without cease.\n\nPines and bamboos encircle the hermitage, verdant to the sky,\nwithering not in winter, flourishing not in spring.\nPeople come and laugh at the hardship of hermit life,\nyet bone-deep poverty is bone-deep purity.\n\nThis pure poverty is the finest way to live—\nI recall the vermilion gates, where many starve.\nIf you recognize the pearl that is your own,\nwhy covet another’s treasures all your life?\n\nThe hermitage is like the body, the master like the heart—\nto understand the master, you must seek within.\nDonkey’s womb, horse’s belly—dreams like grains of sand—\nwho knows the iron ore hides refined gold?\n\nOpen your eyes wide, act swiftly—\nseek now the \"something\" within \"nothing.\"\nWords exhausted, principles cut off, delusions dissolved—\nthe maneless lion roars to the heavens.\n\nThe grand mansions before the hermitage are but fleeting lodges—\nhow many true friends will dwell here with me?\nUnless you wrench free with hands that sever cliffs,\nwho can recognize the one beyond the edge?\n\nWithin this space, joy unknown to others,\nthe work of stillness gained in leisure.\nNaturally wondrous, naturally true—\nall transcendent immortals emerge from this.\n\nThis floating life is brief, its light fleeting—\nwhen the hermitage crumbles, all must end.\nI broadly urge all disciples of my gate:\ndo not neglect this hermitage—cultivate it early.\n\n---\n\n**The Song of the Wild Pavilion**\n\nLeviathans of the four seas are not worth fishing—\neven if they take the hook, I want them not.\nThe immortals of the three isles are not worth boasting—\nthose who attain long life and deathlessness number like hemp.\n\nStirring fame is not worth relying on—\nall the heroes of history are but a play.\nA little wealth and rank are not worth delighting in—\nhow does it compare to the idle clouds beyond the wild pavilion?\n\nWhen the kalpa fire reduces all to ashes,\neven if you sleep through it, you hear nothing.\n\nWild pavilion, wild pavilion—where is it?\nThe cosmos vast, yet no path leads in.\nTen thousand immortals dive in the waves,\na million rocs traverse the earth’s depths.\n\nThis pavilion—truly extraordinary,\nunknown to gods, unfathomed by ghosts.\nEast it pierces, west it pierces,\nsouth it pierces, north it pierces—\nat its center, a single aperture holds worlds like grains of dust.\n\nWithin each dust-mote world, a mote of dust,\neach mote of dust a true person.\nEach true person a true source,\ntheir retinues and regalia countless as grains of sand.\n\nIf mortals see the old man of the wild pavilion,\none glance with the true eye sends them fleeing.\nAh-ha-ha! The wild pavilion’s song, for ages unending.\n\n---\n\n**To Prefect Lin**\n\nWho does not love the gate of long life?\nYou need only apply effort yourself.\nOn the nine-palace terrace, the yellow sprout grows;\nby the white jade pool, the peach of immortality blooms.\n\nStrike the heavenly gate, and ghosts and spirits submit;\nturn the earth’s axis, and yin demons are defeated.\nThe river chariot ascends to the ninefold heavens,\nthe sun and moon refine a world of gold.\n\n---\n\n**Longing for Ghost Valley Mountain and the Grotto of True Thought, Presented to Yuan Gui**\n\nThe Grotto of True Thought—deep in clouds and waters,\nwhere the Daoist dwells, even ghosts and spirits revere.\nMountain flowers smile in the shade of pines and bamboos,\nrock streams murmur—sounds of a thousand ages.\n\nWhen shall I visit, to clear my spirit and heart,\nclimb the stone vines, and laugh and chant together?\n\n*Record of the Words of the Thirty-Third Celestial Master, Xu Jing Zhenjun, Volume Three—Concluded*\n*Record of the Words of the Thirty-Third Celestial Master, Xu Jing Zhenjun, Volume Four*\n\n**Compiled by the Forty-Third Celestial Master, Successor Grandson Yu Chu**\n\n**Five-Character Regulated Verse: On Yuan Gui’s Request to Return to the Mountains, Composed as a Hymn from Afar**\n\nJoy to see the primal stone,\nwordless, yet the truth alone.\nBack to seek the stone-bridge vow,\nwashing off the capital’s dust now.\nIncense coils in still alchemy,\npoems bloom with fresh brush glee.\nHigh clouds embrace no lonely jade,\nhand in hand through grotto’s glade.\n\n**Matching the Rhyme of Master Hunlun’s \"Immediate Matters\" at His Hermitage**\n\nSelf-attained the carefree way,\nalways fond of quiet stay.\nBy the stream, red fades to small,\nbeyond mist, green bamboos tall.\nThings exist in constant sway,\nform forgotten—void holds sway.\nWorldly cares of toil and strain,\nhere dissolve without a trace.\n\n**For Yuan Gui and Tai Ding, the Two Gentlemen**\n\nBy the water, lute and song,\nbeneath the eaves, a scroll held long.\nEach heart follows its delight,\nheaven’s music—how pure, how bright!\nSummer’s first days just begun,\nidle blossoms still hold spring’s sun.\nUnchanged by cold or heat’s decree,\nonly the primal self we see.\n\n**[Autumn Eve]**\n\nOn autumn’s eve, with wine in hand,\nI sketch the scene, though roughly planned.\nTo summon verse of finest kind,\nthe fleeting beauty to unwind.\n\nFlickering autumn’s radiant grace,\nall treasures ripen in their place.\nThe pine stands tall, a crane’s lone cry,\nthe bamboo thick, a cicada’s sigh.\nDeep drunk, my robes grow damp with dew,\nempty songs ride the clear wind through.\nA lute at my waist—play once more,\nthe marshlands of Chu hold songs in store.\n\n**Seeing Yuan Gui Off on His Journey to Mount Magu**\n\nSleeves brushed, the scenes of Ma’s source,\nlight and pure, his lofty force.\nNo distance daunts his thousand-mile way,\nalone he treads the five-clouds’ sway.\nWith zither and books, his joy is found,\nno worldly ties his heart have bound.\nI grieve to lag in his pursuit,\nturning back, my longing mute.\n\n**Matching Yuan Gui’s Rhyme for the Cloud-Brushing Pavilion**\n\nSparse jade frames the lofty hall,\nslowly rising, near the clouds’ thrall.\nTwo pillars share the coolest shade,\nwestward, the Dragon-Transform Pavilion made—\na gust of wind divides the scene.\nThis land laments the zither’s seat,\nhard to nest among the sparrows’ fleet.\nThe host cherishes the straight and true,\nwho dares wield cunning adze anew?\n\n**[In Response to Yuan Gui]**\n\nMaster Yuan Gui read my *Discourse on the Heart*,\nsent a hymn—now matching rhyme in part.\nNew words, though few, unfold so clear,\ntheir chanting cleanses soul and ear.\nIntent lies beyond the verdant scene,\nthe heart is source of all dharmas’ sheen.\nLike dragons, who can fathom deep?\nLike herding horses, words too meek.\nThrice pondering the depths untold,\nreturning, we’ll discuss in full.\n\n**Listening to Yuan Gui’s Zither**\n\nAll things in tumultuous array,\nyet primal sound does not stray.\nAncients plucked it from the strings,\nI seek it now where thought takes wing.\nWater strikes the cliffside stone,\nwind high on the isle—autumn’s tone.\nGazing thus, true joy is found,\nwandering freely, heaven and earth unbound.\n\n**Delight in Clear Skies**\n\nPeonies all have withered now,\nmountain springs at last allow\ntheir voices clear.

rare as these.\n\n**Evening Stroll in the Mountains**\n\nThe roosting crow calls once again,\nseeking its nest—I ask in vain.\nSmall stars gleam, now drawing near,\nhigh cassia’s boughs I first

soon.\nThough dwelling here a hundred days,\nI sense the Three Terraces’ near gaze.\nGreat trees’ voices probe the night,\ntall bamboos shade the quiet height.\nIf one cannot transcend alone,\nhow face the return to one’s own?\n\nNear the door, all treetops sway,\nnot formed from specks of dust’s array.\nThe mountains’ paths I’ve not yet trod,\nafter rain, they gleam like jade’s nod.\nPeaches planted toward the sky,\nclouds arise from ridges high.\nNo cock’s crow or dog’s bark here,\nonly phoenix flutes I hear.\n\nThose who suddenly ascend the hall\nare like immortals in daylight’s thrall.\nLofty, deep—beside the saint’s trace,\nI’m shamed by my unworthy place.\nSlender moon and chilling dew,\ntall pines ask of fields anew.\nThe palace built but years ago,\nstill makes me knock the bell to show.\n\nFacing the west window’s space,\ntwo peaks array their emerald grace.\nWhite clouds drift into the painting,\nwhen will the dark crane take its wing?\nShear the moss like bamboo’s sheen,\nhoe the moss that clings unseen.\nSometimes I leave the door unlatched,\nmist and rain the terrace hatched.\n\n**Linked Verse**\n\nWith Yuan Gui seated in quiet night,\nwe pour the wine bestowed so bright.\nTogether we drink the master’s brew,\nthree cups—yet who would refuse anew?\n\nLeaning close, we speak the Dao’s art,\nbrush in hand, new poems we start.\nThough ill, I’m drawn to join the cheer,\nfor joy’s sake, distance disappears.\n\nSparse stars link the distant Han,\ngreen waters gleam in the fronting pan.\nBefore Pei’s lines could join the thread,\nI’m shamed—what joy the learned shed!\n\nSuddenly clear, then wise,\nTai Ding sits silent, lost in guise.\nNew lotus leaves draw near,\ndustless, the bright moon trails here.\n\n**Mountain Wind**\n\nThe mountain wind arrives in whispers fine,\nsilver candles gleam with scattered shine.\nWith bright eyes, I gaze afar,\nlet not the crimson blinds descend so far.\nThe demon of sleep now wholly dispelled,\nmy chanting thoughts grow clearer, strange, and well.\nA thousand forms dissolve in laughter’s span,\na thousand springs condense to one brief span.\n\nThis joy we share may well suffice,\nlet scorners mock—what care I twice?\nThe Dao’s weight binds all in accord,\nyet scheming hearts I still abhor.\nGautama stands as friend most true,\nthe Old Sage is my master through.\nThe four seas hold no further care,\neach lord finds solace rich and rare.\n\nOn immortal crags, I moor my boat,\nin cloud-brocade, I sow the red elixir’s note.\nThe world deems this folly vain,\nyet we still find what we may attain.\nIn red dust, I tread a fleeting trace,\nto the Purple Court, the path is not far in space.\nFrom first to last, I hold Guanzi dear,\nyet shame my friend Bo Ci’s hold so near.\n\nWhen merit’s done, I’ll ride abreast,\nthrough the six directions, roam at rest.\n\n---\n\n**Again**\n\nWine scorns the price of Gaoyang’s fame,\nmen cherish the feelings of ancient name.\nWe raise our cups to

crown,\nto roam the spirit, one must seek the sea’s renown.\nAt Zhongyuan, let us drink our fill,\nmocking vain names with carefree will.\n\n---\n\n**Seven Words, Again**\n\nDrunk, I boast the cloud-liquor’s grace,\nchanting, I feel my feathers light as lace.\nFrom the pine pavilion, longing knows no bound,\nby the bamboo rail, my lingering thoughts grow sound.\nDistant water grasses hold their emerald hue,\nwildflowers still unfold their petals true.\nThe wind arrives to banish summer’s heat,\nthe autumn cicada sings as dusk repeats.\n\nThe immortal realm seems near the heavenly way,\nthe *Feng-Sao* spurns the world’s entangling fray.\nThough you ride the clouds to question crane in flight,\nI’ll mount the whale of the sea’s vast height.\nThe White Emperor’s qi steels all things stern,\nthe Daoist’s heart, steadfast, makes a hundred demons turn.\nTogether we rejoice in forest’s calm retreat,\nmocking those who chase the city’s street.\n\nBy the stream, let’s share the

the zither’s soul.\nWe cannot yet chant “Let us return,”\nso raise the jar of rosy glow in turn.\n\n---\n\n**Linked Verse on Timely Rain**\n\nHow to console the common folk?\nThe mountains and rivers greet the clouds’ cloak.\nSincerity moves heaven and earth,\nred earnestness lies in word and worth.\nSouthern fields’ seedlings once stood dry,\nnow western suburbs see the rain’s reply.\nPeaks and woods grow lush and deep,\ngrass and trees share joy’s leap.\nBlame not the magic fields’ rich bloom,\nbut rather the feathered robes’ toil and gloom.\nDoes heaven bend to private whim?\nThe vulgar world is steeped in sin.\nThe roads’ dust settles, heat divides,\na bountiful year the farmer’s heart gladdens wide.\nGreat virtue thanks our lord’s grace,\nbranches glisten, startling the forest’s race.\nThe kitchen’s pure, no gnats remain,\nhow shall the Perfected repay this gain?\nOnly by burning incense rare.\n\n---\n\n**Linked Verse on the Completion of the Hunlun Hermitage**\n\nWe build a hut to view the numinous scene,\nwhen work is done, what then is seen?\nZither and books while away the days,\nfishing and trapping age the vines’ embrace.\nEnvious of cloud-trails far and wide,\nwe often share the wine’s tide.\nThe jade cave opens ‘mid the peaks,\nthe western stream pours like the Silver River’s leaks.\nAdorning our pendants, we think of Heaven’s Pillar,\nwatching the sunset, we grasp the Axe’s lesson.\nTrue feeling scorns the shallow and thin,\nworldly affairs are but a fleeting din.\nCutting all ties to seek no burden’s weight,\nstilling the heart to reach the wave’s calm

former court, by fortune, I bowed at the vermilion gate.\nOften I glimpsed your bearing in frequent meetings,\nYet now I grieve the frosty sky hastens your retreat.\nYour perfect virtue humbles the middle and lower ranks to laughter,\nYour towering talent, rare since ancient days, is truly great.\nAshamed my merit and conduct fall short of Yang and Xu,\nHow might I, like Nan Zhen, test the Supreme Tenuity’s gate?\n\n**New Lotus**\nWithered lotus spent, the young buds round,\nBright eyes embrace their fragrance, yet pity they abound.\nThe Moon Emperor comes seeking the azure jade casket,\nThe Golden Lad stands recognizing the sapphire coin’s sound.\nAlready condensed, heavy dew nurtures the pure qi,\nWhat luck the gentle breeze sweeps the faint mist away.\nFar off, Hua Peak remains wholly fair,\nIts blossoms unfurl, crimson and bright as they sway.\n\n**Qiantang**\nCountless households encircled by the city’s winding stream,\nWhere white clouds part, vermilion and azure gleam.\nThe land connects to the golden realm of three thousand worlds,\nThe mountains, jade peaks forming a six-foot screen.\nAt dawn, I lean on the railing, dew still clinging,\nAt night, I draw the curtains, cold stars glimmering.\nThe river’s scenery and windscape defy compare,\nHalf resembling Penglai, half Dongting’s lair.\n\n**Hengfu’s New Tea Triumphs in Contest, Thus I Sing**\nThey say green and white surpass yellow and white,\nYour new buds outshine the old, this much is right.\nDragon’s tongue swiftly gathers the golden tripod’s fire,\nFeathered robes vie to claim the snow-cup’s bloom bright.\nTo Penglai’s high chariot, you must ascend,\nThe faint fragrance of lesser teas cannot contend.\nYet more, the host’s skill shines through,\nCai Jun must enter Lu Yu’s abode

pour wine to adorn the lotus fruit,\nCasually discussing the Great Beginning’s root.\n\n**Composed Hastily on the Seventh Night of the Seventh Month in the Capital**\nHow could the Seventh Night’s splendor fade so soon?\nOnce a year, the weaving maid and herder commune.\nUnstartled by the shooting stars’ high flight,\nAll gaze upward this night in full sight.\nFlowers and moon hold tender feeling, the celestial gate ajar,\nYan Mountain shares its portion, the winecup’s chill afar.\nFrom here, the solemn autumn’s shade will follow,\nFearing my robes may not suffice for winter’s hollow.\n\n**Returning from the Capital, First Visiting the Dragon Transformation Pavilion to Reclaim the Secluded Charm of Former Years, Roughly Sketching an Empty Heart in a Long Verse**\nI sought the fragrant jade of former years,\nTogether with true appreciation, we leaned on the rail’s span.\nSome followed the white sun’s flight, transforming as immortals,\nHalf for today’s treasures, the dark hexagram’s plan.\nIts luster not yet withered, spring’s creatures smile,\nIts sparse shadows come to dance in the moonlight’s aisle.\nThough Jiangnan’s autumn scenes remain bustling and grand,\nThis single lapel of wind and moon brings a chill so bland.\n\n**Returning to the Mountains**\nFor years in the capital, a prisoner most confined,\nReturning to the hills and vales, freedom at last I find.\nFlowing water murmurs as if in shared speech,\nLeisurely clouds, unbound, with me they roam and reach.\nMonkeys cling to pine shadows, watching the cinnabar stove,\nCranes and reed flowers board the fishing boat’s move.\nSuch a post is not at all ill-suited,\nWhy should the red dust’s affairs ever have polluted?\n\n**Responding to Prefect Yu and Censor’s Poem on Wandering Immortal’s Rock**\nFor years in the forest, my intent ran long,\nThrough valleys and peaks, wind and frost I’ve known.\nVulgar guests never crossed my threshold,\nThe enlightened would not deem me mad, I’ve shown.\nBy the river pavilion, I once built, recalling Ninghai’s shore,\nNow in the stone house, I dwell, like Lai Xiang’s door.\nWho would have thought the new prefect of Shangrao,\nWould visit this mountain retreat on his courtly tour?\n\n**The Moon-Stealing Leisure Hall**\nDense forests and towering peaks once detained me,\nA decade in office, not among the loftiest ranks I’d be.\nThe Red Emperor rides the dragon at summer’s end,\nChang’e shares the moon’s glow deep in the mountains’ trend.\nPasses and fords, unobstructed after war’s din,\nRest and sustenance now secure in the village’s din.\nNow, by the willow-lined dike, a true official’s retreat,\nClear streams and splendid gardens, a spacious, tranquil seat.\n\n**Inscribed at the Pavilion of Emptiness**\nNurture the empty qi to preserve life whole,\nDwelling in the Pavilion of Emptiness, just a few beams hold.\nAt South Bank, the Dao’s loftiness earns its fine name,\nIn Supreme Tenuity’s warmth, the magnolia’s pure frame.\nA hundred chapters cherish the dense green forest’s shade,\nThree bodies should inscribe Laozi’s words, thus made.\nUntil the day I attend court at the Purple Chamber’s gate,\nHow many places will the white clouds lightly freight?\n\n**For Master Xiang**\n\n**The Qin Studio**\n\nThe Qin Studio was my former dwelling, named for the qin—five strings it bore. Master Xiang and his disciples now reside here, discoursing on Zhuangzi and Laozi with refined delight. Once I visited, and in recalling past affairs, I found it no less splendid than the many renowned sites. The poem I composed for Master Xiang simply records the truth:\n\nThe Qin Studio’s lofty spirit holds true wind,\nMountains embrace guests, yet no compromise is pinned.\nYou ask of life and death, not in idle haste,\nBut speak of Zhuang and Lao—would you rush the taste?\nGlad now we may come and go as friends,\nYet rue the time when guests once shared these ends.\nThe recluse may compare it to his heart’s own measure,\nSuch a man would not weary the *jiaotong*’s treasure.\n\n**Celebrating the Completion of the Hunlun Hermitage**\n\nThe lofty studio is suddenly complete,\nRed stones and green pines press into the sight.\nVirtue’s constancy has long bound worldly fate,\nLike Ge Hong’s way, a home in every height.\nThe crimson-gold casket hides books most rare,\nThe jade-green flask keeps wine forever there.\nThe return to court may yet be delayed,\nI come now, ready to laugh and sing in the shade.\n\n**The Immortal Crag Temple**\n\nStill near the immortal realm, the crag stands high,\nYet what year did the true hall fall to weeds?\nToday I reach the temple’s sacred ground,\nAnd even the old black crane returns in flight.\nA single stream, like molten glass, flows bright,\nA thousand peaks of purple-green arise in sight.\nDeep in the night, the Chan monks sit with me,\nThe full moon at the window lingers free.\n\n**On Wang Jingxuan’s Sleep**\n\nAll sounds hush as the moon fills empty space,\nA single move decides the game—old Xuan’s grace.\nThe golden flask drained of the village’s wine,\nThe jade spindle sings of the primal time.\nI envy my sleepless self, spirit clear,\nYet laugh at his slumber, so deep, so near.\nTurn and tell the lone cloud on the Dao’s way:\nPurity and turbidity differ by nature’s sway.\n\n**In Response to Prefect Zhou**\n\nSeek quiet in quietude, where quiet may be found,\nPines and bamboo silent, green through autumn’s round.\nFrom beyond the world, your kindness often descends,\nHow fortunate the mountain’s edge your visit sends.\nSweet grass by the curtain grows long in the court,\nA thousand-year-old book on the bridge is sought.\nDelighted to retire here in the south’s embrace,\nProfound talks deepen gratitude for the sage’s grace.\n\n**Benzhu Hermitage**\n\nWhen the mood strikes, I climb the highest peak,\nTrue wind ever present, the climb within reach.\nIn the world’s muddy midst, who still trusts the pure?\nBeyond the clouds, how could one idle, demur?\nStrange rocks poised to fly, bright and stark,\nStartling rapids rush down with a roar’s arc.\nThe common eye may never see this sight,\nBut the perfected walk here in hidden light.\n\n**Mengqin Hermitage**\n\nAt the Purple Court, a noble guest leaves traces rare,\nA single-log bridge spans each crossing there.\nSince the whole household grasped the Supreme Ultimate,\nWho else could step in tandem through the azure air?\nBefore the balustrade, strange trees stay green through winter,\nBeneath the crag, the numinous light glows red at night.\nTrue blessing does not fade with the world’s decline,\nThose beyond the dust enter the divine.\n\n**Pinggai Hermitage**\n\nThe ancients have gone, riding dragons’ scales,\nYet their spirit lingers, recorded true in rolls.\nAt the cave’s mouth, they once bowed thrice to the sun,\nAmid the clouds, a springtime all their own unfolds.\nThe fishing line nears not—turtle and fish stay still,\nWoodsmen forget their schemes—tiger and leopard thrill.\nThe golden well has known no fresh-drawn water,\nYet not a speck of dust clouds the heart’s pure quarter.\n\n**Yuntai Hermitage**\n\nMen of Han once soared with the Dao’s flight,\nEverywhere their traces mark stillness’ height.\nPeach blossoms beyond the world are no common breed,\nCypress seeds in the wind retain their fragrance freed.\nA staff parts the emerald mist to deep halls,\nA boat rides the vast waves into the boundless.\nEighteen hundred years, thirty generations past,\nThe cloud terrace stands empty, jade pendants cast.\n\n**Jinkou Hermitage**\n\nTruth upon truth, nurturing true talent,\nTen thousand trees deep, a single stream bent.\nPearls gleam, night brightens autumn waves at rest,\nChimes hold frost’s tone as dawn’s glow is dressed.\nThe two immortals have long since departed—who meets?\nThree grains remain, awaiting my feet.\nIf the Blue Lad were sent to inspect the traces,\nNo smoke, no shadow would mar the mossy places.\n\n**Houcheng Hermitage**\n\nBeside the long river, the altar stands near,\nBeyond the altar, the river’s edge draws near.\nCinnabar in the earth stays warm through winter’s cold,\nJade bamboo forms a forest, chilled when night grows old.\nThe water crane longs for realms beyond form’s sight,\nThe mountain elder’s brows know no sorrow’s blight.\nThe staff already points to the rosy dawn,\nYet fine dust’s net still binds me on and on.\n\n**Gongmu Hermitage**\n\nAn ancient altar veiled in ten thousand pines,\nI came expressly seeking truth in these confines.\nWild clouds drift open on the green riverbank,\nSparse rain scatters through the verdant woods’ rank.\nThe true chart did not fall from a former dynasty’s hand,\nA humble robe may yet grasp the ancient sage’s stand.\nThe crane’s carriage passed near the resting place,\nPeach blossoms and flowing water still hold their grace.\n\n**Pinggang Hermitage**\n\nA thousand pines, ten thousand bamboos shade the true shrine,\nHow many seekers of truth forget to return in time?\nStone pillows and pond terraces remain as of old,\nCloud-piercing streams and valleys fly swift and cold.\nThe dark ape’s cry echoes through the long night,\nThe yellow crane soars high into the Great Tenuity’s light.\nSince the Six Heavens have long been still and vast,\nWhat age has not turned back to the sacred at last?\n\n**Zhubu Hermitage**\n\nMorning’s glow and evening’s haze both fade away,\nYet no carriages or caps send dust in disarray.\nOf old, I heard of the thousand-year herb’s seed,\nNow one or two recluses here take heed.\nThe colored phoenix often comes to seek bamboo’s fruit,\nThe numinous birds now and then peck the immortal’s root.\nHow grand the riders of old who spurned the light,\nCould they have coveted the five-horse cart’s might?\n\n**Yuju Hermitage**\n\nIn the seat’s corner, a lingering fragrance stays,\nAwe remains as if the master were here always.\nBamboo and stone together rise to the gate of heaven,\nA golden spring flows on, vast and uneven.\nThrough subtle discourse, delusion’s path is cleared,\nPointing directly to the nothingness of home, revered.\nIn this declining age, who can grasp even a part?\nDays follow the senses, ever more harried the heart.\n\n**Beiyu Hermitage**\n\nThe full-moon altar transforms the palace to spring,\nThrough a thousand ages, the willows by the ford still cling.\nThe blue pool brooks no worldly thing’s birth,\nWould the jade brush ever show itself to the herd?\nIn quiet seeking, I’ve pledged with the Three Mysteries’ might,\nIn tranquil joy, who knows the one point’s light?\nA pure journey beyond the world may be compared,\nHoofprints erased, incense dust softly shared.\n\n**Forty-Eight Poems on the Golden Elixir**\n\nThe golden crucible’s dark pearl works its midnight art,\nFive hues swirl, filling the chamber’s part.\nOnly because sun and moon conjoin and blend,\nDo tortoise and snake take turns to contend.\nAt first, the form seems hazy, indistinct,\nWith time, the visage grows dim, indistinct.\nThe cinnabar tells the yang man’s way:\nThis true emptiness is not empty, they say.\n\n**Forty-Eight Poems on the Golden Elixir** *(continued)*\n\nShould false practitioners ask of myriad arts,\nSeek only the Purple Gold Elixir’s heart.\nOn Kunlun’s peaks, towers rise so high,\nIn the Northern Sea’s crucible, dragon and tiger vie.\n\nThis medicine, the treasure most refined,\nWhen wrought, ascends to heavenly kind.\nThe Jade Emperor’s golden decree descends,\nThen cloud-lined paths are no hard road to wend.\n\nThe vulgar throng, lost in delusion’s sway,\nSeek others’ aid yet shun the self’s own way.\nThey crave the world’s endless, fleeting hues,\nForgetting mortal flesh its bounds must lose.\n\nWhen the crucible’s elixir life extends,\nDrowned gold in water to light dust descends.\nBeneath the northern mound’s dark earth they lie—\nAll lost souls who failed to wake and fly.\n\nUnnoticed, years slip past like fingers’ trace,\nSwift as the tide that turns the river’s race.\nFew know the crucible’s sun and moon’s embrace,\nYet many grasp the world’s yin-yang’s face.\n\nAll for wealth they mar their true nature’s grace,\nFor women’s charms they drift with time’s base chase.\nHalf tread the path that leads to the Yellow Springs’ door,\nYet squander their essence to ghosts evermore.\n\nHow laughable, fools by desire entwined,\nWho hoard their breath, their vital force confined!\nThe immortals’ Way is pure and still,\nWhile lust and stench are but the world’s ill.\n\nHow can the foul and vile aspire so high?\nOnly the Returned Elixir grants the sky.\nThe arts of the bedchamber spread in vain,\nBeguiling countless souls again and again.\n\nWhen did the Yin-Gathering Elixir arise?\nEven Liu Zhen of Later Han met his demise.\nBound still to the wheel of return they spin,\nHow can lust’s folly profit the dull within?\n\nThe dog’s wild antics deemed a wondrous art,\nYet ghosts and spirits’ schemes deceive the heart.\nHow much finer the Way of quiet non-doing’s might,\nWhere one crucible’s gold nurtures the Infant Bright!\n\nThe Infant’s crown blooms with lotus fair,\nYet falsehoods swarm like hemp, a tangled snare.\nThey speak not of refining from one crucible’s core,\nBut claim three carts’ conveyance bears the lore.\n\nThe Mud Pill Palace’s path steams clear,\nThe Purple Court’s boundless worth none may compare.\nTo guide the lost in dust’s bewildering maze,\nSeek the root’s truth—no need for vain laments’ haze.\n\nHasten to find a master, point to water and gold,\nFollow the fire’s time to gather the floating and cold.\nNine reflections reveal the Tathāgata’s face,\nTwelve years unfold the Recluse’s heart’s embrace.\n\nThe empty chariot’s lead is swiftly won,\nYet mercury’s dragon-car resists the sun.\nSince first I drank the nectar’s sweet delight,\nI’ve dwelt deep in the Purple Court’s pure height.\n\nThis fleeting life, a dream’s restless stir,\nHow few turn back to seal the Three Passes’ door!\nThe Yellow Dame steadies—easy the parting’s art,\nYet the White Tiger’s flight tests the seeker’s heart.\n\nThe Vermilion Bird enters the furnace, three acres still,\nThe Dark Turtle guards the crucible, a life at will.\nThis luminous mystery I’ve come to know,\nYet hide its mechanism in the old mountains’ glow.\n\nSpeak not of immortal bones, nor seek the Elixir’s flame,\nThis principle is profound, its proper gate the same.\nFew lost ones know to turn back to the root,\nYet this teaching plants the seed as truth’s firm foot.\n\nTortoise and snake, great and small, must often feed,\nThe sun and moon’s essence wholly consume with speed.\nOnly when a true master reveals the way,\nCan the wilds’ barrows not claim your clay?\n\nThe immortals’ wondrous work is hard to spy,\nMany learn the Way yet lose it to desire’s lie.\nIf you can grasp fire and water’s truth at last,\nThen east and west at last stand clear and vast.\n\nMix not true lead with common lead’s alloy,\nNor rank the true wife with the world’s decay.\nWhen Kan and Li unite, the body finds peace,\nOnly in sloth do husband and wife cease.\n\nThe Yellow Sprout’s treasure—speak not lightly,\nThe White Snow’s mystery—dare not slight it.\nNot that I hoard this secret in rustic guise,\nBut the immortals’ medicine the vulgar despise.\n\nFloating and sinking, the Mao-You path divides,\nTransformation’s gate for tortoise and snake abides.\nOf ten thousand students, scarce one or two,\nYet false \"Dao-friends\" fill the earth anew.\n\nPreserve the spirit, know your original face,\nThis subtle principle may yet be learned apace.\nWhen the leakless is complete, the leaking ends,\nThe ford of delusion crossed, the true ford begins.\n\nMortal life scarce grants a thousand years’ span,\nYet the immortal realm turns ten thousand springs with ease.\nHow pitiful, the lost in endless maze,\nWho gladly cast their spirits to the northern dust’s haze!\n\nSome turn to Buddha, then to immortals’ lore,\nTwo paths they grope, yet neither explore.\nMost err in paths that lead to confusion’s snare,\nAnd see how swiftly the lost change and fare.\n\nRefine the medicine within your own frame,\nFoolish to seek the lotus in the flame.\nSeek only the self, seek life’s true thread,\nNot the three thousand or the great thousand’s spread.\n\nThe Black Dragon and the Tiger’s Ford are not hard to part,\nBegin with the gate of settled spirit’s art.\nWhen White Snow is refined to match sun and moon,\nWhen Yellow Sprout is consumed, you’ll rise beyond the rune.\n\nWithin the Four Spirits’ crucible, death may flee,\nIn the Five Colors’ nectar, the soul returns to thee.\nHow many oysters in the world can boast such might?\nLose not your root to wealth or beauty’s blight.\n\nSwiftly discern the floating gold in water’s tide,\nIf you refine it well, even ghosts will abide.\nThe Four Spirits guard the sacred furnace tight,\nNine revolutions deepen the elixir’s light.\n\nDragon and tiger reverse their paths to meet,\nTortoise and snake rise in flames, fierce and fleet.\nWhen the Five Colors swirl in radiant display,\nThe chamber glows to illuminate the way.\n\nThe Zhou Tian’s fire-timing fools the common kind,\nEven Embryonic Breath’s coils are not refined.\nIn the Purple Court, gold gathers, dragon’s fire seed,\nOn Kunlun’s slopes, jade flows, tiger’s spring runs freed.\n\nWhere the Three Lotuses break, the spirit’s power divides,\nWhen the One Child is born, the dust’s bonds subside.\nTo all who rush and strive in vain pursuit,\nTrue lead and true mercury never leave the root.\n\nWithin Kunlun’s halls, the Purple Gold Elixir gleams,\nNot for mortal eyes—only the immortal’s dreams.\nIf fate grants you a share to extend your span,\nNaturally free from hunger and cold’s ban.\n\nTiger and dragon, lead and mercury in the Geng-Xin crucible’s glow,\nGreat and small tortoise and snake on the Taiyi altar’s show.\nWhen one pill is wrought, five hues take flight,\nHeaven’s message is no hard thing to recite.\n\nThis toiling life speeds by like a shuttle’s throw,\nHasten to refine the true, the demons to outgo.\nTurn the floating and sinking in the Northern Sea’s vast tide,\nLose not yourself to dreams in Nanke’s shade.\n\nIn the Jia-Geng crucible, gold is not few,\nIn the Mao-You altar, earth is plentiful too.\nYet when the chamber blazes with radiant light,\nPurify your heart, consume it—freedom’s in sight.\n\nChasing fleeting fame and profit’s hollow gain,\nHeed not how swiftly time steals youth again.\nDazzled by beauty’s bloom before your eyes,\nUnseen, your temples whiten with surprise.\n\nThe sturdy crucible extends life’s thread,\nYet passion’s reckless indulgence mars the true instead.\n\nI urge you to seek the elixir’s secret art,\nNurture the infant within to transcend the dusty world.\nHow swiftly fleeting are these glimpses of light—\nBorn and reborn, the wheel turns without cease.\n\nAll for greed and delusion’s trifling cause,\nYet none think to still the heart and cultivate the true.\nTiger and dragon serve as chariots to ascend the sky,\nLead and mercury are the boat to leave this world behind.\n\nHow many immortals pity the common folk,\nLeaving the elixir’s formula to save the mortal stream.\nRide the dragon, mount the crane—no need for fear,\nFor this is the golden pill’s singular power.\n\nFive-hued cloud-dragons rise from the sea’s depths,\nNine-fold wind-tigers soar to the celestial court.\nWhere jade blossoms meet, observe the ren and gui,\nWhen the purple palace unites, rely on bing and ding.\n\nThis truth is not for lesser minds to grasp,\nUnless your name is the Star of Lesser Brilliance.\nThis toiling life speeds by swift as wind,\nHasten to slay the Three Corpses and Five Worms.\n\nLet not the fox and fox-spirit steal the crucible’s treasure,\nBut bid the dragon and tiger guard the true void.\nWithin the crucible’s precious vessel, tend the fire in time,\nAnd the infant in your belly will grow ever more radiant.\n\nGood men and women, heed these words,\nLest you drown in wine and lust’s delusion.\nMost strange and wondrous things beguile the seeker,\nAt the first glimpse of wanton desire, the heart stirs.\n\nIt is but the song that pours out the body’s treasure,\nHow can the gold in water remain firm?\nThe path to heaven stands open, yet none tread it,\nThe gates of hell are barred, yet crowds rush in.\n\nI send this message to the men and women of the world:\nWithdraw your steps from the burning house, hide in the mountain forest.\nFor those who indulge in excess, the Lord is watchful,\nCondemning them to become foxes and beasts, tails trailing behind.\n\nThey say five hundred years must pass before transformation,\nYet who knows that in three thousand days the spirit is remade?\nWhere the thunder’s fire is put to use,\nDog and fang alike serve as kin in this teaching.\n\nThe fox-spirits, kin to vengeful demons,\nAssume bewitching forms to lead many astray.\nThe tales of Liu Chen and Ruan Zhao are far from true—\nToday, let the wise ponder this deeply.\n\nMistaking the celestial palace for lust’s domain,\nThey fill the purple court with deceit and guile.\nThe pure struggle of the cave admits no impurity,\nWhile the dark recesses of the grotto breed strange wonders.\n\nHow deeply deluded are the people of this world,\nHow many have lost their lives to fox-spirits?\nBy the altar of Master Zi, near the Purple Tenuity,\nIn the deep of night, the wind’s light is falsely praised.\n\nThey speak not of seeking lead to prolong life,\nBut claim mere herbs can extend the years.\nThe immortal elixir need not be sought beyond the body,\nWhy place it before the door like a household god?\n\nPerhaps a mountain spirit has beguiled you,\nMaking you see杂色 as commonplace.\nTrue lead and true mercury are most trustworthy,\nYet this truth, though clear, is seldom practiced.\n\nIn the White Tiger’s crucible, jade nectar forms,\nSurpassing the serpent’s palace where golden essence is nurtured.\nKan’s man and Li’s woman stand in threefold array,\nSun and moon, east and west, unite in one journey.\n\nIf you find the path within this,\nThe infant’s visage will naturally take shape.\nThe golden elixir’s bone-transmuting power does not deceive,\nYet most mortals are easily led astray.\n\nIf the red serpent soars north of the sea,\nThe jade hare will naturally run to the western sky.\nThe Lotus Messenger wields the true water,\nThe Fire Dragon King opens the great path.\n\nTurn your efforts to refining within this,\nFlight and ascent lie in but a single *daogui*.\nFortunate is the one who grasps the profound truth of cultivation,\nDiligently refining the gold within the water.\n\nIf you know the purple court’s lotus can be planted,\nYou will believe the path to Kunlun can be found.\nSun and moon unite, their light above and below,\nAfter white and blue merge, colors float and sink.\n\nSince gaining this true message,\nThe world’s glory and shame no longer touch me.\nWhy waste youth studying poetry and books,\nWhen seeking the true preserves the jade flask?\n\nNo need to weary the spirit wandering the Red Waters,\nSimply know how to preserve your nature and nurture the mysterious pearl.\nWho in this world possesses the crucible’s sun and moon?\nThe furnace’s cinnabar is unknown to the age.\n\nMen laugh at the solitude of this path,\nYet this solitude differs from the world’s.\nOnce awakened to this life and the next,\nWhy cling to empty talk of Chan?\n\nThe Flower Pool’s water is called the elixir of ascent,\nThe golden crucible’s lotus is the key to leaving the world.\nOnly when you delve into its wonders do you begin to know,\nAnd when the work is complete, you see the mystery’s depth.\n\nSince receiving the enlightened master’s guidance,\nI have come to trust the cloud chariot’s escape from the dusty shore.\nThe three passions’ gates stand open without suspicion,\nYet it is the common folk who refuse to enter.\n\nMoon’s essence and sun’s spirit form the path,\nTiger’s spring and serpent’s fire serve as ladder and go-between.\nTend diligently to the three fields to secure the primordial seed,\nFirmly seal the crucible, opening it only later.\n\nFrom formlessness, form naturally arises,\nThe true embryo can unbind the spirit’s knot.\nThe Crimson Bridge’s qi-circulation is all in vain—\nIt is the common folk who cling to appearances and stray.\n\nThe Northern Sea’s crucible divides creation,\nThe Southern Darkness’ palace aligns with heaven’s principle.\nEmptiness and nothingness are achieved through the returning elixir’s power,\nIn the indistinct, the body becomes one with the wondrous Dao.\n\nIf you can perceive this within the floating life,\nThen floating life is but a fermenting brew.\nCountless Dao companions fill the dusty world,\nYet how few bear true names, how few are real?\n\nFailing to grasp that mercury and lead are supreme treasures,\nThey turn to the furnace and crucible to smelt silver.\nWithin lies the true method for gathering the medicine,\nWithout, they seek the elixir in vain toil.\n\nHow much worse for those lost on the path,\nWho not only mislead themselves but others as well.\nBeneath the Nine Perfections Mountain lies the Flower Pool,\nIts waters prolong life, yet the world remains unaware.\n\nGolden tangerines grow there, radiant in hue,\nSmall as pellets, yet rainbow clouds take flight.\nSent to the Northern Sea’s depths for safekeeping,\nCarried to the Southern Culmen, where strange wonders unfold.\n\nOnly when the work within this is complete,\nWill yellow clouds, piece by piece, embrace the infant.\nUpon the Nine Perfections Mountain rise towers and terraces,\nWhere sun and moon float above, purple qi amassed.\n\nFrom the Northern Sea’s depths, golden peonies bloom,\nFrom the Southern Culmen’s palace, jade roses emerge.\nThe Three Clarities’ gates hold the three fields’ secrets,\nNine cycles of effort trace ninefold returns.\n\nWhen this priceless treasure is refined,\nLet others laugh at my foolish toil.\nRestlessly seeking masters, wearily rushing about,\nAll for the divine water that is the immortals’ homeland.\n\nA single crucible glows with molten gold,\nThree fields gleam with jade-like nectar.\nAt midnight, only the true fire coils,\nIn the chamber, unnoticed, rainbow light shines.\n\nA single grain transcends the mundane—how weighty it is!\nOnly then do I trust the path to Penglai is long.\nThe great medicine in the crucible is unknown to the world,\nAs sun and moon both descend, conception is not lost.\n\nNot only the wondrous light of the fire-jujube,\nBut the profound principle called the \"intertwined pear\" is sought.\nThe golden elixir’s bone-transmuting power does not deceive,\nYet most mortals’ natures are easily led astray.\n\nIf the red serpent soars north of the sea,\nThe jade hare will naturally run to the western sky.\nThe Lotus Messenger wields the true water,\nThe Fire Dragon King opens the great path.\n\nTurn your efforts to refining within this,\nFlight and ascent lie in but a single *daogui*.\n\nThe flowing crimson powder scatters clouds afar,\nThe profound divine radiance fills the chamber whole.\nTwelve years of refining—at last it is complete,\nThen riding the phoenix-carriage, one ascends the heavenly ladder.\n\nFor decades I concealed my traces from the world,\nLest the crowd discover the seed planted in the cinnabar field.\nThe Five Phases gather in an instant,\nA single orb of perfect clarity emerges of itself.\n\nThe divine crucible glows with pristine white snow,\nThe leaden cauldron gently pours forth crimson lotus.\nOf late, I’ve grown unaware of fleeting fame,\nYet many come to knock, seeking the wondrous mystery.\n\nHaving ingested the golden elixir, bones and hair grow light,\nThen Penglai’s journey seems but a measured path.\nThe clarified alchemical furnace yields jade powder,\nThe frozen qi-sea pierces the Three Clarities.\n\nKunlun’s palaces rise higher year by year,\nThe Purple Court’s towers are built anew each day.\nWith this, one may ride the cloud-crane chariot,\nLaughing at those who mock the pursuit of immortality.\n\nMany study the Dao, few awaken to truth,\nYet when truth is realized, one sees one’s own true self.\nThe Three Fields’ paths stretch far and wide,\nAll things transform without cause or reason.\n\nWithin earth, gold is nurtured—its hue grows deep,\nWithin the crucible, the fire’s work is ever renewed.\nIf one remains unmoved by wealth or sensual desire,\nOne is already a dweller within Penglai’s grotto.\n\nEnduring humiliation through days of bitter toil,\nShutting the door, yet ghosts still steal one’s essence.\nUnknowing that the cinnabar field’s lock was not secure,\nHow can one prevent the soul’s madness from toppling the Purple Court?\n\nYang-qi swiftly wanes, life is hard to preserve,\nYin-demons gradually grow, easily depleting one’s forces.\nI urge you—hasten to seek a master,\nLest malevolent spirits shatter your Daoist resolve.\n\nOne sees only the divine furnace at midnight,\nYet knows not how the fire’s power scatters yin-demons.\nSuddenly, within the golden crucible, cold jade congeals,\nAnd in an instant, the true body manifests in rainbow radiance.\n\nFrom the vast blue dew, white snow is distilled,\nWithin the Flowery Pond’s waters, the yellow sprout is nurtured.\nHere, one beholds the true message,\nDo not recklessly chase after the deer-cart.\n\nIf one possesses the golden elixir, the soul may return,\nYet the deluded, lost in the Dao’s current, fail to swallow it.\nWhen the vermilion bird opens the cliffside earth,\nThe white deer must enter the sea’s hidden gate.\n\nTo attain this, first tame the qi-steed,\nEver hasten to restrain the heart-monkey.\nGood men and women, seek the true formula,\nDo not let your form decay into a mound of earth.\n\nIn silent meditation, with incense burning,\nWithin each thought, one must see one’s own form.\nLife’s origin lies in lead’s mercury,\nTransformation’s source is the dragon within fire.\n\nDo not shirk the frequent gathering of two and eight,\nOr the arduous union of one and three.\nHere lies the path that leads to heaven,\nWhere one may follow Red Pine’s dusty traces.\n\nDo not scorn the rustic adept’s subtle revelation,\nFor it connects the virtuous to the highest path.\nThose who awaken do so at these words,\nThe deluded remain lost in their own thoughts.\n\nWhen *jia* and *geng* part, the dragon returns to the left,\nWhen *mao* and *you* unite, the tiger stands in the west.\nIf you perceive the mystery within the mystery,\nYou will find it inseparable from the true husband and wife.\n\nMy body, my life, align with heaven,\nOnly the golden elixir can lead one out of delusion.\nThe numinous essence ever dwells in the jade palace,\nThe sacred embryo, once formed, steps upon the cloud-ladder.\n\nWhy cling to the world of clams and oysters?\nWhy carry the silkworm’s woven robes?\nThough refining demands the labor of sun and moon,\nTo transcend the dust, one need only a single *daogui*.\n\n*Record of the Thirtieth Celestial Master, Perfected Lord Xujing, Volume Five (conclusion)*\n*Record of the Thirtieth Celestial Master, Perfected Lord Xujing, Volume Six*\n\nDescendant and Forty-Third Celestial Master, styled *Chubian*, arranged and

seeds lie within—\nhow can one blame it for having no mouth?\nIt holds heaven and earth—\nwho understands this principle?\nHung at the waist,\nI cherish it all the more.\nIt surpasses the golden fish pouch.\n\n*Recalling Peach Blossom Spring: Two Poems*\nCai Shiyuan doubted me, Shenweng, and Shichen.\n\nShiyuan posed a question: \"What is the extension of cultivation and refinement?\"\nI dashed off a brief lyric in reply.\n\nThe words of long life are passed mouth to mouth,\nseeking the golden elixir in its fullness.\nBlending into one, becoming an immortal—\nI explain it earnestly to the worthy.\n\nDo not swallow qi,\ndo not recklessly transmit it—\nhow could one fathom the mystery of creation?\nUse lead to cast into mercury, mercury into lead,\nclearly inverted, again and again.\n\nWithin the piled white clouds, pluck the lotus,\neach branch fragrant and richly lush.\nBy the shore of the numinous tortoise, auspicious winds arise,\na tower of twelve stories high.\nThe golden hall,\nveiled in azure clouds,\ncinnabar glows crimson through the crown.\nWhere the divine mechanism turns, ghosts and spirits commune—\nthe pure and true ascend to the highest palace.\n\n*Lin Jiang Xian*\nDeng Dafu released six cranes at Hunlun Hermitage and requested a poem.\nThus composed.\n\nDo not wonder that the spirit is so plain and pale—\nit fully comprehends the thousand-year pine’s crown.\n\nThe feathered immortals share a deep and kindred sorrow,\nEarnestly vying to inscribe and compose,\nTurning and tossing in responsive verse.\nMoreover, there is the tale of the brothers of Xianyang,\nWhich makes one forget all cares upon hearing it.\nMy life has ever been marked by the signs of transcendence—\nOnce the brush was set to paper,\nThe flow could not be halted.\n\n*Qin Yuan Chun* (Three Poems)\n*Subduing Demons and Establishing Order*\n\nAs the kalpic cycle renews,\nHeavenly scriptures descend with grace,\nThe sagely master commands the demons.\nNow yin and yang are disordered,\nGhosts and spirits confounded,\nRelying on cities,\nStretching across mountains and rivers.\nMurderous qi chokes the sky,\nYin’s countenance usurps the day,\nThe myriad people suffer calamity, day after day.\nAbove Qingcheng,\nA lapis lazuli throne appears,\nSuddenly rising, towering and majestic.\nThe demonic hordes, enraged, brandish their weapons,\nVying to rush and attack the mountain like shuttles in a loom.\nAt the flash of divine radiance,\nDragons are subdued, tigers trapped;\nAt the thunderous roar of awe-inspiring sound,\nLightning strikes, thunder rebukes.\nOrder is established to transform the people,\nEvil is gathered and returned to rectitude,\nLife flourishes in harmony, enjoying great peace.\nThe winds and clouds grow still,\nRevealing the heavens merging with the azure vastness,\nThe moon bathing in limpid waves.\n\n*Again*\n\nThe True Unity endures forever,\nOne with the Great Void,\nThe wondrous gate opens of itself.\nSince the primordial chaos first divided,\nThe Two Modes arrayed their scenes,\nReturning again to the root,\nTo the golden register and the numinous terrace.\nVast qi surges forth,\nThe Valley Spirit nurtures transformation,\nGradually, the divine radiance is felt coming from the void.\nIn the most secluded depths,\nOne hears the dragon’s chant, the tiger’s roar,\nSuddenly—wind and thunder.\n\nHow wondrous, the subtle Dao is hard to fathom,\nYet by refining the foolish, great talents are made.\nLet me plainly reveal to you its form—\nThe clam holds the moon in the deep,\nThe autumn hare carries its embryo.\nMen and women of lofty resolve,\nHigh-minded scholars of old—\nDo not let body and mind be sullied by worldly dust.\nWhen merit is complete,\nFreely dwell in the Purple Court,\nYour name inscribed on the immortal ranks.\n\n*Again*\n\nHasten to cultivate the Way,\nFor on close reckoning, how much time does a human life hold?\nThough you may possess a thousand charms,\nA myriad graces—what avail?\nOne morning, death comes,\nAnd all must be cast aside.\nSuddenly reflecting,\nThe great matter of life and death\nStrikes my heart like a blade unsheathed.\nHard to detain—\nThe golden crow’s arrows fly swift,\nThe jade hare’s shuttle weaves fast.\nAwaken early, let not fate deceive you,\nIn purity, who can match my youthful bride?\nEven if in the moon’s embrace,\nThe Lady of the Moon were yours to command,\nOr in Yue, the fairest of the land—\nThis fleeting romance,\nI have no heart to cherish.\nWith a broad mind and open mouth, avoid strife.\nRely on Penglai’s might,\nWhen the three thousand deeds are fulfilled,\nRide alone back in triumph.\n\n*Lin Jiang Xian*\n*In Reply to Yuan Gui*\n\nAll creatures endowed with life receive Heaven’s gift,\nIn carefree nature, their original share is one.\nLet no heterodox views disturb my true essence.\nHere and now, the inner master abides,\nWholly merged with transformation as human.\n\nNo more need for subtle words, so clear to the core—\nEven light dust would find no cause to cling.\nOnly when this is attained does spirit congeal.\nA hundred demons all cease their strife,\nThe six paths forever halt their turning.\n\n*Man Ting Fang*\n\nIn leisure, refine your skill,\nWithin the wondrous workings of non-being,\nTake care not to speculate or ponder.\nDragon descends, tiger submits,\nTrue earth emerges from central yellow.\nIn movement, rest, sleep, and diet,\nFollow the current, never stir true yang.\nAt the root’s return,\nSpirit congeals, pulse stills,\nAnd from the jade realm, celestial light arises.\n\nWhen winds rise high, the roc’s wings soar far;\nWhen waters run deep, the boat glides on—\nSuch is the principle of all things, manifest and clear.\nSimply illuminate the heart, for that is the Dao,\nDevote yourself wholly, and Heaven will reveal.\nIdly summon spirits or call forth ghosts,\nPray for rain or sunshine—this is no madness.\nYet the deluded,\nThough thunder and wind lie in their grasp,\nTurn their use awry.\n\n*Lin Jiang Xian*\n*In Reply to Yuan Gui, After Reading Yang Xi’s Biography*\n\nSince ancient times, the pure and numinous descend in wondrous ways,\nLady An came

it.\nHow could this compare to ordinary sentiments?\nIn the square inch of the heart,\nNot a speck of dust is stored.\nStill, one must trust—\nGold firm, stone unyielding,\nA single resolve never wavers.\n\nTrue origin,\nTruly lovable,\nTrue teacher, true friend,\nRejoice in their guilelessness.\nAmong them, even more free and untrammeled,\nCareless of form and frame.\nYet is this not solemn awakening?\nRelying on true essence,\nTransforming the mortal frame.\nWhen the numinous meets,\nThe world’s snares of dust—\nSpeak not of their origins.\n\n*Dong Xian Ge*\n\nAtop the solitary peak’s summit,\nNone can reach.\nTen thousand miles of empty space, boundless and vast.\nIn autumn’s high, still scene,\nMists roll back, clouds withdraw,\nWind and dew enfold—\nOnly the moon’s radiance shines high.\nFleeting life, a passing traveler,\nIn fine weather, a fair night,\nDrunk with dance and wild song, mistaking dusk for dawn.\nWho knows the one nature,\nPerfect as the Ganges,\nIn an instant—eternal,\nLight ageless?\nYet they vie to face the moon,\nDebating profit, discoursing fame,\nNever thinking of the fleeting shadow,\nStealthily hastening youth away.\n\n*Yu Jia Ao*\n*Composed Over Wine for Jie Fu*\n\nHastily the cup is raised to share a laugh,\nA life of illness and suffering thus passes.\nFriendship and righteousness run deep as earth.\nHearts illumine each other—\nLet no

Hermitage*\n\nDeep in the hidden ravine,\nI ask the cowherd, the woodcutter boy—\nBoth lose their way.\nWilderness tangled with reeds,\nSerpents and dragons rise and vanish,\nJade Gorge plunges into empty paths.\nNo craving for wild-goose pagodas’ glory,\nOnly keeping to the fish’s cold, pure abyss.\nThis toil—\nHold fast, and the gods themselves will shield you.\n\nSudden awakening,\nNo turning back—\nA single spark of emptiness,\nTen thousand kalpas without past or present.\nThe root of embryonic breathing runs deep,\nThe spirit spring’s cave is secret,\nIn stillness, the Yang fire is nurtured and tuned.\nAsk not of earth’s endurance or heaven’s span—\nSimply gather causes to bear fruit.\nDo not squander,\nFor I reveal to you the true foundation of the Celestial Valley.\n\n*Again*\n\nPassions coil, knowledge binds.\n\nAlas for those of this age who fail to awaken—\ntrue joy lies in the wine.\nUnbridled speech invites transgression,\ndeluded minds lose their conduct,\nyet they claim it was the maddening draught’s fault.\nKnow well that in drunken dance and wild song,\nthere too resides innate knowing and true awareness.\nUnmoored,\nas warmth circulates freely,\nthrough the Three Passes and Three Meridians.\n\nFallen and carefree,\na wanderer of leisure—\ndeep in the realm of intoxication,\nwind and moon ever repay the drunk.\nEmpty blossoms’ tidings,\nradiant and revealed,\nself and other—all forgotten.\nNo need to ask of market brews or village ferments,\nsimply sip lightly, pour low.\nYet they scorn and deride,\nvying to speak of sobriety,\neach word a mistake.\n\n*Embroidered Needle Fixed*\n\nSnowy night, fishing boat,\nevening wind subsides.\nI myself pole the skiff,\ngliding with the current to watch the snow.\nMountains rise like jade peaks,\nforests stand as silver trees,\nhigh and low—no distinction remains.\nThe heart’s nature, clear and limpid,\nwith not a single old friend to speak to.\nSuddenly, this floating life\nseems to dwell in heaven’s halls,\na palace of crystal.\n\nAll sounds and shadows of the dust-world cease.\nPiercing emptiness without bounds,\nwater and sky merge.\nVast qi surges and fills,\ntrue work runs deep and thick—\nthrough the long night, no fear of biting cold.\nAshamed of my own paltriness,\nknowing only how to chase warmth and heat.\nI halt the oars and laugh,\nentrusting all that matters\nto the wild plum and river moon.\n\n*Spring Comes from Heaven Above*\n\nThe crane cries, bearing the imperial decree.\n\nThe earth lies smooth as jade,\nas the sea

steps and jasper chants layered in emerald,\nwith daylily lush and verdant.\nSkilled in drinking the rosy dawn’s nectar, why refuse intoxication?\nNo need to count the thousand cups of worldly dust.\nAt dawn and dusk, he departs to face the origin—\nhow could he bear to abandon the pine of the great man?\n\n*Cherishing the Fleeting Time*\n*(To the tune of Dui Zhu Fu)*\n\nHollow-hearted, stalwart-stemmed, vying in grace and detachment,\nby the balustrade winter and summer alike.\nFrost-laden winds, snow-laden hues in deepening dusk—\nyet never do the slender branches and delicate stems wither.\nWithin the heart’s intent lie the sorrows of dust and sand;\nlisten closely to the strings’ songs, swift and slow.\nNo disdain for the verdant green that opens the blue eye—\ngazing together, as if accustomed to the Taiyuan family’s ways.\n\n*Pure Serene Music*\n*(Qing Ping Yue)*\n\nBefore heaven and after, the true earth conceals divine elegance.\nIts wondrous workings naturally

Heaven shaped these noble heights, and earth’s genius shines thus. Often we say to one another: *We dwell in the ruins of the Perfected Ones yet remain unaware.*\n\nAscending Playful Pearl Peak, I see tiger-crouching dragons leaping, distant walls and far ridges all beneath my gaze. Here I examine the site, erect a hall, and raise its inscribed plaque. Flowers in the water, vegetables in the garden, mountain light and fresh bamboo, the sunlit hut ever more serene—I have found my home.\n\nOnce, longing for return, I saw twelve verses in kindred voice and so harmonized with them.\n\n---\n\n**Xiyuan is fine—**\na transcendent’s structure crowns the transcendent peak.\nOne crane’s nature, pure, clears my dwelling;\nten thousand dragons’ wind and rain stir the frosty void.\nLofty, still, vast—too indolent for worldly care.\n\n**Heaven and earth rejoice—**\nmountains and waters flow in tranquil communion.\nWalking, sitting, lying, I cherish scenes beyond the dust;\nemptiness and silence are the Daoist’s way.\nNo trifling joy compares.\n\n**Xiyuan is fine—**\ndragon’s head and tiger’s brow rise high.\nWind and rain ever gladden the clear cosmos;\nridges and forests surge like waves.\nChanting and singing, I find my poetic boldness.\n\n**Great joy is complete—**\nits fair renown meets its fitting encounter.\n\nAt the pure altar of the Dipper, jade tablets are cast and feathered missives sent;\nthe Primordial is invoked in joyous assembly, golden blades held aloft.\nNow my person stands apart from the world’s dust, free to scratch my head in ease.\n\n**Xiyuan is fine—**\nthe cliffside lodge is hewn from pine, its beams weighed down with age.\nBefore the Five-Dipper Grotto, I pour jade-like wine in study;\nhalf-drunk, beyond the window, I caress my golden cup.\nUnburdened, I am at leisure.\n\n**Emerald hues—**\njade bamboo newly planted.\nLet the wind come, but spare the ancient trees from sway;\nlet the rain fall in season to wash the verdant moss.\nSuch is the vexation of a poet’s talent.\n\n**Xiyuan is fine—**\nspring days lengthen with the rising sun.\nI care not to ask of the third-month’s scenes among men;\nI ever long for the celestial realm of ten thousand flowers.\nIn secluded delight, I am momentarily wild.\n\n**Laughter and song—**\nvast, resounding hymns.\nA thousand deeds vie in the wind-swept valley’s splendor;\nwhen the threefold clouds return, moonlight bathes the forest.\nThe musk’s fragrance lingers like orchid.\n\n**Xiyuan is fine—**\nwelcoming summer, I sprinkle the scorching winds.\nBy the red-brocade stones, a lone flute plays;\non Old Zhang’s crag, I linger among the clustered peaks.\nAt times, I grasp the rod that transforms into a dragon.\n\n**The zither’s jade tones—**\ndawn’s light leans upon the wutong tree.\nThough age may tarnish my literary works, they flourish within the court;\nmountains and rivers, forests and wild pavilions stand empty.\nCrimson flames blaze bright within.\n\n**Xiyuan is fine—**\nthe Daoist cherishes autumn’s scene.\nWhen the season arrives, the heavens naturally turn solemn;\ndeep in the night, I still delight in the moon’s full radiance.\nA long whistle presses down upon the azure peaks.\n\n**Indeed, with wine—**\nhow hard it is to part from song’s edge.\nWherever firewood is felled for charcoal,\nnow is the time to taste the new rice and celebrate the harvest year.\nThe youths dance like embryonic immortals.\n\n**Xiyuan is fine—**\nwinter’s pines stand amid the snow.\nHand in hand upon the stone altar, I receive the beloved scene;\nin stillness, I watch heaven and earth enter the pure palace.\nJust like the Great Mao Peak.\n\n**Sleeves and hems tinkling—**\nthe zither’s case holds deep sentiment.\nBefore the Moon-Blowing Grotto, I hold jade within my lips;\nthe enchanting charm stirs, shifting to the Yellow Bell’s tone.\nEmotions arise from within.\n\n**Xiyuan is fine—**\nthe secluded path does not slope awry.\nThe mountain valley’s seclusion remains unchanged in hue;\nthe pond’s emptiness and stillness bear not a single flaw.\nOne fishes at the water’s edge.\n\n**A small immortal barge—**\none longs to gaze upon your abode.\nThe returning oars turn with the sun, as if beholding a mirror;\nthe drifting boat descends with the stars, like riding a spindle.\nWind and rain scatter the cold sands.\n\n**Xiyuan is fine—**\nthe divine grotto seeks its own accord.\nBy the water, fields are tilled as the mountain stream rushes;\nhewing the mountain, a path is opened where tiny blossoms float.\nFootprints of the old man remain.\n\n**Forgetting the ten thousand things—**\nthe crisp qi gathers the white clouds.\n\nThe Director of Destinies once sought quiet repose,\nZiyang’s steps were truly light along the secluded path.\nLonging to follow this master’s wanderings.\n\n**Xiyuan is fine—**\none dwells within a palace of crystal.\nEver wishing the Jade Spring might cleanse the tripod,\njust as Dragon Well reaches Celestial Peak.\nTruly, a splendid legacy remains.\n\nPure to the depths,\nhow could it rival the flourishing of Li and Tang?\nNaturally steeped, the rock’s clarity presses before the crag;\nnot confined, the mountain’s clouds drift beyond the heavens.\nLimpid and luminous, it fills the heart.\n\n**Xiyuan is fine—**\nrain clears, the red gauze gathers.\nEmerald waters still beckon the old angler;\ngreen cliffs chill, rousing the fisherman’s home.\nSpring tea is brewed beneath the canopy.\n\nWind vast and boundless,\nbrocade shadows grace the stone screen.\nAbove the cauldron, jade bamboo is struck;\nwestward, perch are drawn through crimson sands.\nAsk not of joy’s distant shore.\n\n**Xiyuan is fine—**\nonce more toward the western courtyard.\nWatching evening chrysanthemums bloom beyond the square acre,\nbeside cold plum blossoms, six-petaled snowflakes take flight.\nThree cranes arrive as one.\n\nThe world now clear,\nemptiness alone is prized—non-action supreme.\nWearing the moon, the night still holds parting;\non the fragrant plain of Yu, no need to wander lost.\nHere, one shakes out one’s robes and returns.\n\n---\n\n**Geng Lou Zi**\nAgain in rhyme to the Perfected One\n\nReciting the true scriptures,\nhoping for ten thousand repetitions—\nyet the fire of ignorance remains unquenched.\nOne should turn back,\nexplore true emptiness,\nand melt into serene solitude.\n\nSince ancient times, where do people abide?\nVainly clinging to fame and profit.\nCast off worldly burdens,\ncultivate quiet leisure—\nthe elixir of jade preserves youth.\n\n---\n\n**Su Mu Zhe**\nEmbracing the lone zither,\nplucking a short melody.\nSeated alone in the secluded pavilion,\nall day without a visitor.\nOnly delighting in rosy clouds, a long and proud whistle,\nthe bright moon and clear wind—\neternal friends of past and present.\n\nComprehending heaven and earth,\nknowing yin and yang,\ntoo weary to join the dusty toil,\nthe ceaseless race.\nLoving to gaze high, the white day fades—\nlet others chase\nthe jade hare and golden crow.\n\n---\n\n**Jian Zi Mu Lan Hua**\nPresented to Jianyi, Wang Jiefu\n\nIn the bitter cold of winter,\nthe sun’s return brought near-falling snow.\nPines vie with the clouds,\ntheir towering forms in the pavilion sighing at late-withering.\n\nThe ancients hesitated,\nentering the mountain forests’ depths.\nPast and present align—\nbest to follow the reed pipes and songs, finding joy alone.\n\n---\n\n**Man Ting Fang**\nOnce more ascending...\n\n**Regulating the Three Passes**\n\nRegulating the Three Passes, harmonizing the four limbs,\nin stillness, no care for the vexations of mutual strife.\nIn profound union with the Great Tenuity,\nthe Primordial Beginning speaks to the immortals.\nThe Jade Scriptures are re-edited, wondrous canons,\ninscribed on the Western Terrace and Southern Peak, chapter by chapter.\nYet what is most revered—\nthe body’s field in

echoes—with whom do they clamor over earth and water?\nA gentle breeze sends me down the eaves’ pillars.\nWaxing and waning—how could they bear emotion?\n\nThe Way of Zhongnan,\nlayered with laughter and song.\nThe cinnabar gate freezes at night, horses depart;\nthe Yellow River at dawn reflects a boat adrift.\nRiding side by side, they come and go as one.\n\n**Song of the River Spirit**\n\nColored clouds, pavilions, and auspicious mist settle.\nRain just cleared, the moon veils all in brightness.\nNight still, celestial winds\nblow down the strains of *Steps in the Void*.\nWhere do they ascend to court so late?\nA pair of phoenixes, small,\nand five clouds, light.\n\nFalling flowers, flowing waters—two gates of feeling.\nResentment has no hold,\ndreams refuse to form.\nLeaning on every railing,\nthe Chu wind remains clear.\nDew drips from pine tips, the world hushed—\nunfurling the precious seal,\nreciting the *Yellow Court*.\n\n**Magpie Bridge Immortal**\n*To Mingquan*\n\nSpirit clear, heart wondrous,\nmountains long, waters distant—\nwhat fate determines the year we meet again?\nA single patch of cloud flies through the clear sky,\nstirring in me boundless imagining.\n\nOne gate to transformation,\nninefold blossoms of grace and dew—\nonly wishing for a clear direction.\nBamboo winds often rise in the purple haze of the

carefree and unburdened,\na lone lamp’s light, pure and void.\nThe rush mat steadies the unrestrained body,\ncross-legged in great stillness, the heart unmoving.\nThe moon’s wheel emerges from the sky’s edge,\na nameless pearl revealed in the emptiness.\n\n*Second Watch, Second Point*\nThe second watch deepens,\npalace bells fall silent, night sinks.\nThe bright moon fills the sky like molten gold,\nsharing its light and shadow, no dusk or gloom.\nRising to idly pluck the stringless zither,\nits ancient tones startle the heart.\nThe zither silenced, singing alone, chanting alone—\npine winds and mountain streams, all know the tune.\n\n*Third Watch, Third Point*\nThe third watch at its height,\nmist disperses, clouds withdraw, wind stills.\nMoonlight bursts into the crystal palace,\nall directions, above and below, one vast emptiness.\nRadiance pervades, as in the land of Hua Xu,\nthrough endless ages, no beginning, no end.\nAn iron serpent dances like a flowing

      "translated_text": "**Preface to the Recorded Sayings of the Thirtieth-Generation Celestial Master, Perfected Lord of Empty Tranquility**\n\nWithin the cosmos, the qi of radiant mountains and numinous peaks is concentrated in humanity alone. Yet when humans cultivate the self, what is inwardly contained must manifest outwardly. How could one whose essence is so profoundly stored refrain from giving it voice? Though the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi advocate the abandonment of the body, the rejection of sensory brilliance, and the absolute renunciation of all that ensnares one externally—striving instead to return wholly within—even the Dao of transmitting teachings to the world and establishing guidance must rely upon words to be conveyed and made manifest.\n\nFrom this, we may observe: those who wander beyond the mundane—do they truly regard words as entirely without use? For them, words are like clouds drifting through the vast sky or the faintest ripples upon a limpid abyss, forming patterns with their movement and stillness, yet leaving no trace to be discerned. This differs from the words of the Confucians: when flourishing, their speech is bold and unrestrained, their emotions unbridled; when in adversity, their words are bound by sorrow, their sentiments filled with lament. Nevertheless, the Dao endures through the ages, its spiritual transformations as eternal as Heaven itself. Must one await the presence or absence of words to deem it supreme?\n\nThe Thirtieth-Generation Ancestor, Perfected Lord of Empty Tranquility, possessed innate wisdom and karmic roots, flourishing during the reign of Emperor Huizong, when the court revered the Dao with particular devotion. Between the Chongning and Jingkang eras, the imperial house’s veneration of the Dao was profound, and true immortals emerged in abundance. Among those who ascended and descended in the same era as the Perfected Lord were Xu Shenxi, Wang Wenqing, and Lin Lingsu. In exorcising malevolent spirits, calming tidal disasters, and verifying divine omens—whether bending cypress branches or summoning auspicious signs—they frequently demonstrated extraordinary efficacy. When the nation’s fortunes waned and hardship arose, the Perfected Lord foresaw calamities and portents, and at the sovereign’s command, could summon wind and thunder, drought and rain. His Dao was divinely manifested and renowned, truly sufficient to adorn the celestial court and bestow blessings upon all beings. Though centuries have passed, people still speak of him with admiration today—how could he be compared to those whose fame flickers briefly before vanishing without a trace?\n\nThe *Record of Responses and Transformations* has already documented his meritorious deeds in detail. Yet the Perfected Lord’s teachings for the world, his verses that refine the spirit and awaken the soul, are all capable of rousing the deluded and enlightening the benighted. Had he not wandered in the primordial chaos before the emergence of form, shedding the dust of the world like a cicada molting its shell, utterly free from even the slightest attachment, how could his attainments have reached such heights?\n\nDisciples from all directions recite his words and long to behold them in full, yet regrettably, they have not been preserved in their entirety. Though they were once printed, much has since been lost. Thus, I have gathered them from the famous mountains and re-engraved them upon woodblocks to broaden their transmission. May this enable scholars and seekers to delve beyond the surface of his words, to grasp the secrets of the \"fire talisman\" and fathom the mysteries of lead and mercury, finding in them an everlasting teacher. Proceeding thus into the realm of the Dao and virtue, one may wander the boundless wilderness, the shores of emptiness, amidst towering peaks and ancient forests on a night when the wind is clear and the moon bright. Chanting his ethereal verses, where the pines echo and the springs respond—who can say that the banners of rainbow clouds and the girdles of rosy mists will not descend? How could such words not be transmitted alongside those of Laozi and Zhuangzi?\n\nI, Yu Chu, unworthy heir to this lineage, am hardly capable of fully extolling his virtues. Yet I fear that some of his teachings may be lost, and so I humbly place this preface at the beginning, awaiting the brush of a master to complete the task.\n\nWritten on an auspicious day after the Zhongyuan Festival in the twenty-eighth year of the Hongwu reign (1395), by the Perfected One of Orthodox Unity, Successor to the Dao, Expounder of Non-Action, Inheritor of the Radiant Ancestral Teachings, Leader of the Daoist Religion, and Forty-Third-Generation Celestial Master, Successor to the Han Lineage, Yu Chu, who respectfully bows and offers this preface after fasting and purification.\n\n---\n\n**Recorded Sayings of the Thirtieth-Generation Celestial Master, Perfected Lord of Empty Tranquility, Volume One**\nCompiled by Yu Chu, Forty-Third-Generation Celestial Master and Successor\n\n**Essays**\n**On the Mind**",

      "translated_text": "The mind is the root of all dharmas, the master of the nine apertures, the foundation of life and death, and the source of good and evil. It arises together with Heaven and Earth, serving as the sovereign of spirit and luminosity. Some call it the *Perfected Lord*, for it commands the entire body. Some call it *True Constancy*, for it transcends antiquity and modernity without decay. Some call it *True Suchness*, for it abides in stillness, unmoved. When activated, it pervades the six directions; when abandoned, its whereabouts are unknown. Vast beyond measure, the cosmos lies within it, and it shares the same essence as the Great Void. Minute beyond limit, it enters the tip of an autumn hair, yet cannot be sought through form.\n\nThis is what we call our fundamental mind, the original self before the empty kalpas. Yet what, truly, is it? Vague and obscure, elusive and indistinct—it cannot be known by intellect, nor grasped by perception. We forcefully name it the *Dao*, forcefully name it *spirit*, forcefully name it *mind*—nothing more. From this, can we not see its greatness? Can we not see its preciousness?\n\nYet why, though it revolves through the Three Realms, passing in and out of life and death, cannot free itself? For when a single thought stirs within, the six senses flow outward without cease, failing to transcend evil even as it transcends good. Thus arise the retributions of heaven and hell, the karmic consequences, the endless cycles of the Six Paths with no hope of escape. How grievous! How lamentable!\n\nThe enlightened, however, are not thus.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, through fasting and abstinence, one illuminates their virtue with spirit—once the One True [qi] settles into clarity, the ten thousand calamities dissolve. Laozi said: *\"Attain utmost emptiness, guard stillness firmly; the ten thousand things arise together, and I observe their return.\"* All things flourish in abundance, each returning to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called restoring the mandate; restoring the mandate is called constancy. To know constancy is called clarity; not knowing constancy, one acts recklessly and invites misfortune.\n\nWhat is called *constancy* is that which transcends past and present without decay. What is called *recklessness* is the moment a single thought arises. Zhuangzi said: *\"Once a thing is made, to return again to the root—is this not difficult?\"* In the *Yijing*, is this not the way of the *Great Person*?\n\nFrom this point onward, be cautious in speech, moderate in diet, eliminate defilement and halt thoughts. Still the mind and guard the One; embrace emptiness, tranquility, and non-action. Withdraw the gaze and reverse the hearing; harmonize with radiance and merge with dust. A fleeting thought’s arising is the illness; its non-continuation is the cure. Fear not the arising of thoughts—only the delay in awakening. Like hair that must be combed daily, so too the body and mind—why not tend to them thus? In walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, let not a single moment pass without vigilance.\n\nThe land of *Nothing-Whatsoever*, the realm of *Huaxu*—there shall I wander.\n\n**Opening the Altar, Initiating the Rite**\n\nHave you not seen the thousand-foot ladder leaning against the steep ridge? Step upon it, and you may reach the summit; place it upon flat ground, and even a low wall becomes insurmountable. The ladder is not insufficient—it is the ground upon which it stands that is amiss. A ship of ten thousand *hu* rests securely upon the great river; with it, one may cross oceans; cast it upon a shallow stream, and even a few paces become impassable. The ship is not incapable—it is the waters that bear it which are unfit.\n\nThe scriptures of my lineage—above, they can move heaven and earth; below, they can shake mountains and rivers. In brightness, they command dragons and tigers; in darkness, they subdue ghosts and spirits. In merit, they can revive the decayed; in cultivation, they can transcend life and death. In greatness, they can stabilize nations; in smallness, they can avert disasters. Yet their attainment lies in practice, and their loss lies in negligence. Thus, the craftsman’s tools and measuring line cannot guarantee skill; the master’s model and standard cannot ensure conduct. Yet man’s karmic obstructions—emotional entanglements, demonic hindrances, the snares of fame and profit—accumulate daily without respite.\n\nBorn without parents, who is truly kin beyond the body? Each day requires only clothing and food—what use is hoarding? Glory, wealth, and honor are like a candle in the wind; beloved wives and children are like crows roosting on the same branch. Fine carriages and grand steeds cannot accompany you on the long night’s journey; beautiful concubines and radiant wives cannot rescue you from the ninefold darkness. Carved walls and towering halls, white jade and yellow gold—though they may belong to you for a time, they cannot be kept forever.\n\nVast are the Three Realms, bustling are the Four Forms of Life—once swept away by the passing current, you sink forever in the sea of suffering. Do not wait until the underworld’s emissary arrives to summon your name from the black ledger. By then, regret will be too late.\n\nYou have left your homeland and parents to draw near the gates of masters and teachers, shouldering your burden through frost and rain, baring your liver and cleansing your gall to behold the true wind of the Most High. You have pledged faith and submitted your name to receive the celestial master’s secret scriptures. From this day forward, cast off the old and renew yourself daily. Though your name may be recorded in the highest heavens, your body remains entangled in the world’s net. Sever past attachments gradually; let future grievances pass without entanglement. Only then—dissolving conflicts, blunting sharpness, aiding beings, and saving others—nurture tranquility, preserve spirit, and still the mind.\n\nOnce the green vine is cut, the fire of the *monkey-mind* must cease; when deluded thoughts do not arise, the *horse-mind* within naturally halts. Know the body as affliction; see life as the true. The yang does not cherish birth; the yin does not conceal death. Thus, the great wind cannot stir you, and the kalpa’s fire cannot burn you. Thoughts extinguished from the Three Corpses, nature untainted by the Five Desires.\n\nThe Jasper Terrace and the Park of Paradise become your homeland; the sea of love and mountain of affection are the livelihoods of others. Human life is uncertain—who can guarantee a full span of years? The days and months pass swiftly; to act is already late. If you delay further, you will only grow feeble and despondent. Having fortunately arrived at this treasure mountain, do not return empty-handed.\n\nI humbly pray that the imperial foundation remain ever firm, the sage’s longevity extend without end, the four barbarians lay down their arms, and the ten thousand kingdoms come to pay homage. Once selfless transformation is achieved, then the ten directions, the Three Realms, the Six Paths, the Four Forms of Life, and all sentient beings shall ascend the shore of the Dao.\n\nNow the altar is prepared, and the rite of initiation is at hand. I dare not linger before the disciple. I implore you—take care.\n\n**Reply to the Prefect of Chizhou**",

      "translated_text": "**Reply to Lin Lingsu**\n\nThe gourd and bamboo hat are indifferent things—what use are clouds and mist? The golden gates and crimson haze may seem like celestial wanderings, yet only white stones and limpid springs preserve the mountain’s true tranquility. Our meeting was but a fleeting convergence of duckweed and driftwood, while each of us finds our own path to freedom. Divided by rivers and mountains, seasons have turned again and again; idle fame grows daily, while my wandering traces remain scattered.\n\nI reflect that the Dao is fundamentally natural, and spirit is nothing apart from it. The bright moon courses through the azure sky, yet its light has no form; white clouds drift over green mountains, yet their hue leaves no trace. The silkworm enters its cocoon and the moth departs; the sparrow plunges into water and the clam is born. Transformation occurs in an instant, cycles follow like echoes—no need to imitate, for rise and fall come naturally to the round and square alike. The myriad phenomena know birth and decay, as spring flowers wither in autumn; the single qi waxes and wanes, as night dew vanishes at dawn.\n\nI drift across the five lakes in a small boat, soar over the three isles on a black crane. Ascending high requires distance, descending low presents no difficulty—only by not obscuring the subtle signs does one become a person of true understanding.\n\nYour plum-scented letter, delivered by courier, has just arrived, and I am fortunate that your serene harmony aligns with my fading recollections.\n\n**Memorial from the Celestial Master to the Divine Brother**\n\nIn ancient times, after the Three Heavens, fathers departed and sons succeeded; now, among the masters of the registers, elder brothers step aside and younger brothers assume their place. As your humble servant dons the vestments, I pray the Great Ultimate will witness and know: though I seek to store blessings within this unworthy self, I can never forget the great gift bestowed.\n\nI am at a loss for words.\n\n**Memorial of Gratitude for Official Appointment**\n\nThe times do not wait for men, and I regret being favored by celestial grace. The kindness extends to my kin, bringing joy to my private household. I am ashamed that such honor truly overwhelms me, and my joy is mingled with awe and trepidation.\n\nI recall that from the time I was but a youth with unbound hair, I was blessed to receive your radiant light. Seven years have passed, and three imperial decrees have been issued—granting me a dwelling with cloud-browed eaves to facilitate my devotions, and bestowing the *Yuli Jing* of the Xuanhe reign to aid my cultivation and practice. Then came the grace of the \"Leaking Spring,\" extending even to my elder brother of the same womb, whose encounter with the boundless was beyond any repayment I could offer.\n\nThis is all due to your singular elevation of the teachings, your boundless compassion that knows no distinction, and your profound regard for the bonds of heaven and kin, which you have extended even to me. Though precedent exists, it still astonishes the age. My devotion, like that of a dog or horse, is what I must offer; the splendor of the phoenix and simurgh is beyond all measure.\n\nWith the sincerity of incense and flame, I pray for the eternal longevity of the imperial hills. Gazing toward the heavens and longing for the sagely presence, my emotions are as urgent as if I stood at the edge of an abyss.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\n*End of the First Scroll of the Recorded Sayings of the Thirty-Sixth Celestial Master, the Vacant Tranquility Perfected Lord*\n\n*Second Scroll of the Recorded Sayings of the Thirty-Sixth Celestial Master, the Vacant Tranquility Perfected Lord*\n\n*Compiled by his successor, the Forty-Third Celestial Master Yu Chu*\n\n**Five-Character Ancient Verse**\n\n*Written in Response to Shi Yuangui’s Discourse on the Gull and Roc*",

There, we boiled tea and spoke at length, parting only at midnight. His words were a delight to the ear—truly grand, lofty, and transformative. Even the mountains and rivers seemed more radiant. The next day, we bade farewell.\n\nAt the time, it was the fifth year of Xuanhe. Here follows a brief account:\n\nThe west wind first stirs, light,\nwhite dew still glistening.\nA man floats down the great river,\neastward to Raoyang.\nHe bears a decree from the Ninefold Throne,\nand so seeks the cinnabar chambers.\nMountain *qi* gleams with dragon and tiger,\ngreen forests stretch beyond the clouds.\nBy chance, he meets me—\nour discourse sharp as frost.\nDusk falls, and we take up candles;\nseated beneath the new moon’s chill.\nThe jade toad veils the misty scene,\ngolden breezes waft celestial fragrance.\nShadows fall like hometown clouds,\nbrilliant, offering wondrous omens.\nThe Six Directions share no other hue,\nthe Five Peaks bathe in autumn’s light.\nA brocade-robed exile in the dusty world,\nriding a whale, he parts the river’s beams.\nYou await the fulfillment of our mystic pact,\nsoaring ethereal in the empty sky.\n\n---\n\n**Tang Mingquan Takes His Family into the Dao**\nHow fine, your long-held detachment,\nyour talent unused for office!\nAmid white clouds, chickens and dogs,\nyou lead your family to wander here.\nYour hidden depths are extraordinary—\nprofound principles may be attained in stillness.\nAlas, the enlightened lord’s decree\ncould not sway your resolve.\nTransformed into a river-and-sea talent,\nutterly free of worldly dust.\nI hear of Magistrate Jingyang,\nwho raised his household beyond the mortal realm.\nSuch matters lie in earnest cultivation—\nstrive on, scion of the Tang!\n\n---\n\n**A Eulogy on the Dragon-Transforming Pavilion, Presented to the Daoist Master of Qingcheng**\nA chamber free of dust,\nharmonious winds sway jade bamboo.\nThe desk holds only zither and books,\nuntrammeled, apart from the vulgar world.\nNow and then, he wields his brush,\ntranscribing talismans and tallying records.\nOr he joins Master Wu Xuan,\nplaying two or three games of *liubo*.\nAt night, beneath the moon beyond the woods,\nhe plays divine melodies upon his knee.\nDeep into the night, his interest unspent,\nhe slowly unfurls the scrolls.\nCome, Master of Qingcheng,\nas clouds part, distant mountains turn green.\n\n---\n\n**In Response to Yuan Gui’s Farewell**\nJust arrived at the towering

the ten-thousand-year pine.\n\n---\n\n**Thinking of the Elder of Qingcheng**\nSince parting from the Elder of Qingcheng,\nnow several months have passed.\nThe scorching sky, spring’s breath waning,\nmountain blossoms swiftly scatter.\nTime and again, I yearn and gaze,\nwestward, pacing the jade pavilion.\nSurely he lingers among men,\nwhere pipes and songs still revel in delight.\nReturn, companion of the world beyond—\nfulfill our pact at Green Cliff.\nThe setting sun flashes its lingering glow,\nlotus rising from golden carving.\n\n---\n\n**In Response to Yuan Gui’s Encouragement**\nYour words, sir, cite the ancients,\nmaking clear the Dao resides here—\nwithout action, yet goodness arrives.\nNow you have truly attained it,\noffering music to seek true knowledge.\nA single phrase reveals your nature,\nthough words can scarcely contain it.\nI know you have mastered Lao and Zhuang,\nstriding through the vast wilds by day.\nIn spirited discourse on the mystery within mystery,\nyou stand unbounded, without limit.\nTo learn, one must have something to await—\nnot contending with the myriad demons.\nGazing at the scene, as if knowing,\nwhy marvel at the strange or uncanny?\nDoubts dispelled, trust is born—\nthen you are truly a good man.\nTake goodness as your teacher,\nand the celestial truth may be attained in stillness.\nMen still debate rank and station,\nbut the affairs of immortals should follow spontaneity.\nIf fate decrees one surpasses the common,\nwhy wait for death to end all?\nThe Great Dao is no empty illusion—\nluminous, it stands above the ten thousand things.\nHearing this once, I feel\nmy spirit refreshed, my soul invigorated.\nCease debating depth or shallowness—\nthese words express a heart sincere.\nThe times are

abides;\nqi returns to the primal sea, and life knows no end.\n\nTo keep the spirit within the body,\nlet not a single thing linger in the numinous terrace.\nIf things remain, the spirit grows unclear,\ndraining vitality and wasting sinew and bone.\n\nThe spirit guides qi, qi sustains form—\nno need for miscellaneous arts to attain long life.\nArts are easy to know, but the Dao is hard to fathom;\neven when fathomed, one fails to practice it single-mindedly.\nThus, though thousands and tens of thousands study,\nin the end, scarcely one or two succeed.\n\nIf the spirit strays, bring it back;\nwhen the spirit returns, qi naturally follows.\nMorning and evening, thus renewed,\nthe true embryo of the unblemished child is born.\n\n---\n\n**The Song of Emptiness**\n\nEmptiness stretches boundless, without shore or edge,\nsun and moon traverse east and west in mutual farewell.\nHow long will their eastbound farewells and westbound welcomes last?\nIn the realm of birth and death, they flash like lightning.\n\nThe true nature, originally one with emptiness,\nshines bright and clear, free from dimness.\nYet by a single thought, it falls into form,\nlost in the cycle of birth and death, wandering east and west.\n\nAlas, how few in the world awaken!\nDeath brings sorrow, birth brings joy—\nunaware that birth is the root of death,\nrejoicing in the sun’s rise, dreading its fall.\n\nEastward rise and westward fall are the natural way;\ndo not let the heart’s attachments entangle you.\nIf you doubt, observe the sun and moon—\ndawn and dusk, they ceaselessly circle the heavens.\n\nBirth is not arrival, death is not departure;\nnothing arises from dependence, all abides where it dwells.\nThe six paths of rebirth rush in vain—\nthe true person dwells only in emptiness.\n\nWhere the true person dwells, no house stands,\nneighboring wind and moon in pure void.\nDo not say the numinous light is but a speck—\nit encompasses the Dharma realm without omission.\n\nThe Dharma realm, vast beyond bounds,\npervades the tiniest dust, yet holds nothing within.\nHunger, cold, and calamity cannot touch it;\nevery thing, every head, returns to the sovereign.\n\nA heap of dust, a body of a hundred years—\nlike a boat adrift on water, steered by another’s hand.\nSuddenly the boat breaks, the passenger steps ashore;\nthe withered wood, masterless, sinks and drifts.\n\nDo not rot, do not look back—how many rivers have you crossed?\nCountless streams, how many times have you passed this way?\nOnce ashore, burn the boat—no need for it;\nwhy speak of waves as bitter, their green as sorrow?\n\nWhether dwelling in the boat or not, fear not—\nlast night’s wind and thunder shook the mountains.\nEmptiness remains unmoved, ever thus;\nonly when you grasp true emptiness will you not be deluded.\n\nFrom ancient times to now, it stands eternal;\nupending the world, it reveals its full body.\nHaving delivered all beings from the sea of suffering,\nthe message of true emptiness is no inert void.\n\nTransformations unfold without end—\nhear my song within the void,\nan iron serpent soaring to Kunlun’s peak.\n\n---\n\n**The Song of Rest**\n\nRest, rest, rest—cease, cease, cease.\nRest and cease without distinction.\nA thousand subtleties, ten thousand mysteries—\nall teach but one thing: rest and cease.\n\nIf you can rest, if you can cease,\nall entanglements of emotion are severed.\nHunger eats, thirst drinks, weariness sleeps—\nthrough ten thousand deaths and a thousand births, no concern remains.\n\nThe sages of old, the wise and enlightened,\ntheir single nature endures through eons.\nRadiant light illumines, merging with true emptiness—\nbeyond rest and cessation, nothing else remains.\n\nThose who plant seeds in hell,\nwho weave karmic debts,\ntheir six senses burn like raging fire.\nClinging to self, contending with others, blind to rest and cessation,\nthey willingly endure dismemberment and tongue extraction.\n\nRest and cease—this is the true oral formula,\nbeyond foolishness, wisdom, skill, or clumsiness.\nFrom ancient teachers, the truth is this:\nthey lamented those who cultivated without meeting a kindred heart—who would reveal it?\n\nRest is not rest, cease is not cease—\nthe great function manifests without pretense.\nIt governs the primal transformation, leaving no trace,\nencompassing emptiness, transcending arising and ceasing.\n\nNeither rest nor cease—\nrest and cease are but forced words.\nTo know true rest and true cessation,\nlook to the flawless moon of mid-autumn.\n\n---\n\n**Composed at Qiantang**\n\nCrimson clouds reflect the vermilion balustrade,\nwhite clouds veil the green mountains.\nWorldly folk never come here—\na pair of cranes dance at the brushwood gate.\n\nA jade zither plays one tune, poems flow in numbers;\nthe mountain boy boils tea, the stove emits no smoke.\nLonging for the world’s pleasures, I wandered away—\nhow many years have

note.\nThe world deems this folly vain,\nyet we still find what we may attain.\nIn red dust, I tread a fleeting trace,\nto the Purple Court, the path is not far in space.\nFrom first to last, I hold Guanzi dear,\nyet shame my friend Bo Ci’s hold so near.\n\nWhen merit’s done, I’ll ride abreast,\nthrough the six directions, roam at rest.\n\n---\n\n**Again**\n\nWine scorns the price of Gaoyang’s fame,\nmen cherish the feelings of ancient name.\nWe raise our cups to share delight,\nfacing the scene, we strike new song’s light.\nTwelve parts of pure qi,\nthree thousand beyond worldly glory.\nHeaven’s truth is our sole guide,\nlet no worldly rites our spirits bind.\n\nThe cicada’s hum draws softly near,\nthe pine’s voice swells, serene and clear.\nThe forest wind chills our seated frame,\nthe mountain moon illumines all the same.\nIn perfect stillness, the spirit soars,\nat midnight’s hour, the qi still roars.\nThe stars’ patterns gleam like jade’s bright sheen,\nthe tiger’s strength makes the purple brush light.\n\nTo gain one’s will is not in cap and crown,\nto roam the spirit, one must seek the sea’s renown.\nAt Zhongyuan, let us drink our fill,\nmocking vain names with carefree will.\n\n---\n\n**Seven Words, Again**\n\nDrunk, I boast the cloud-liquor’s grace,\nchanting, I feel my feathers light as lace.\nFrom the pine pavilion, longing knows no bound,\nby the bamboo rail, my lingering thoughts grow sound.\nDistant water grasses hold their emerald hue,\nwildflowers still unfold their petals true.\nThe wind arrives to banish summer’s heat,\nthe autumn cicada sings as dusk repeats.\n\nThe immortal realm seems near the heavenly way,\nthe *Feng-Sao* spurns the world’s entangling fray.\nThough you ride the clouds to question crane in flight,\nI’ll mount the whale of the sea’s vast height.\nThe White Emperor’s qi steels all things stern,\nthe Daoist’s heart, steadfast, makes a hundred demons turn.\nTogether we rejoice in forest’s calm retreat,\nmocking those who chase the city’s street.\n\nBy the stream, let’s share the joy of Three Laughs,\nin drinking, vie with the Eight Immortals’ cause.\nSay not my wine’s all lost to you,\nfor poetry’s renown may yet be due to me and you.\n\n---\n\n**Visiting the Abode of Truth Together**\n\nOur mood draws us to Truth’s retreat,\nour hearts moved by the ancients’ feat.\nThe ancients’ Dao was not alone,\nour hearts today share not a stone.\nIn stillness, joy beyond the world,\nin clarity, no dreams are hurled.\nProfound discourse transcends form and mind,\nour songs and talks through caves unwind.\n\nWild hues blend with tea’s fragrant bowl,\nthe pine’s voice enters the zither’s soul.\nWe cannot yet chant “Let us return,”\nso raise the jar of rosy glow in turn.\n\n---\n\n**Linked Verse on Timely Rain**\n\nHow to console the common folk?\nThe mountains and rivers greet the clouds’ cloak.\nSincerity moves heaven and earth,\nred earnestness lies in word and worth.\nSouthern fields’

feathered robes’ toil and gloom.\nDoes heaven bend to private whim?\nThe vulgar world is steeped in sin.\nThe roads’ dust settles, heat divides,\na bountiful year the farmer’s heart gladdens wide.\nGreat virtue thanks our lord’s grace,\nbranches glisten, startling the forest’s race.\nThe kitchen’s pure, no gnats remain,\nhow shall the Perfected repay this gain?\nOnly by burning incense

days,\nfishing and trapping age the vines’ embrace.\nEnvious of cloud-trails far and wide,\nwe often share the wine’s tide.\nThe jade cave opens ‘mid the peaks,\nthe western stream pours like the Silver River’s leaks.\nAdorning our pendants, we think of Heaven’s Pillar,\nwatching the sunset, we grasp the Axe’s lesson.\nTrue feeling scorns the shallow and thin,\nworldly affairs are but a fleeting din.\nCutting all ties to seek no burden’s weight,\nstilling the heart to reach the wave’s calm state.\nIn Hunlun, we rest in sweet repose,\nin truth and simplicity, the world’s deceit we oppose.\nDust and filth are barred by a thousand peaks,\nthe wind’s flow harmonizes ten thousand qi’s seeks.\nHeaven and earth may vie in longevity,\nsun and moon shuttle like a loom’s

from stone,\nthe world shifts like a moth to flame’s own.\nTo enter the high immortals’ tune,\nbeware the lower ghosts’ dark boon.\nBeneath the thatched eaves, no task remains,\nfrom time to time, we chant our strains.\n\n---\n\n**Drinking, We Linked “Moon over the West River”**\n\nThis night the moon shines bright as day,\nthe eastern pool rivals the West River’s sway.\nMoonlit, the courtyard’s hush is deep,\nwine’s joy and poetry’s passion we cannot keep.\nUnwilling to return to the thatched hall,\nwe dip our brushes, wild and tall.\nBy the lamp, we chant to the quiet pane,\nmocking the

Rhyme**\nJade talismans and golden script chant the Cavern of Perfection’s truth,\nWithin the real, who rivals such lofty and wondrous art?\nWorldly green cast aside, the spirit remains ever still,\nEssence-feeding ceased, the meal is but dust’s part.\nEver shall I aid the sagely brightness in transforming the age,\nNever should I idle my life in aimless roam.\nBy your decree, fortune multiplies for me,\nTo enter the jade palace and meet the One alone.\n\n**Night Sitting in the Capital, Longing for the Primordial Hermitage**\nAlone I sit in the empty hut, stillness known,\nHow could the river city’s charm compare to this?\nBehold the phoenix fruit at its first ripening,\nSelf-proclaimed as the toad’s radiance in its prime.\nWith cloud-aged immortals, I’d share the joy of wine,\nFrom worldly dust, no praise for Qing Zong’s verse I’d claim.\nIn the mountains’ groves, a realm of emptiness and light,\nUnable to return, my chanting bears longing’s weight.\n\n**Responding in Rhyme to Minister Zhao**\nIn sweltering heat, I left my homeland’s hills,\nNow frost and snow bring creeping cold.\nI rue my hollow fame that drags me through the world,\nWhile cherishing your lofty words, leaning on the rail.\nOf late, I’ve wearied of guests beyond the dawn,\nEver plucking the zither through the night’s veil.\nAlready granted leave to return next spring,\nI marvel in advance at the crane’s preening wing.\n\n**Seeing Off the Perfected Realized One**\nFor long I’ve admired your pure renown,\nIn the former court, by fortune, I bowed at the vermilion gate.\nOften I glimpsed your bearing in frequent meetings,\nYet now I grieve the frosty sky hastens your retreat.\nYour perfect virtue humbles the middle and lower ranks to laughter,\nYour towering talent, rare since ancient days, is truly great.\nAshamed my merit and conduct fall short of Yang and Xu,\nHow might I, like Nan Zhen, test the Supreme Tenuity’s gate?\n\n**New Lotus**\nWithered lotus spent, the young buds round,\nBright eyes embrace their fragrance, yet pity they abound.\nThe Moon Emperor comes seeking the azure jade casket,\nThe Golden Lad stands recognizing the sapphire coin’s sound.\nAlready condensed, heavy dew nurtures the pure qi,\nWhat luck the gentle breeze sweeps the faint mist away.\nFar off, Hua Peak remains wholly fair,\nIts blossoms unfurl, crimson and bright as they sway.\n\n**Qiantang**\nCountless households encircled by the city’s winding stream,\nWhere white clouds part, vermilion and azure gleam.\nThe land connects to the golden realm of three thousand worlds,\nThe mountains, jade peaks forming a six-foot screen.\nAt dawn, I lean on the railing, dew still clinging,\nAt night, I draw the curtains, cold stars glimmering.\nThe river’s scenery and windscape defy compare,\nHalf resembling Penglai, half Dongting’s lair.\n\n**Hengfu’s New Tea Triumphs in Contest, Thus I Sing**\nThey say green and white surpass yellow and white,\nYour new buds outshine the old, this much is right.\nDragon’s tongue swiftly gathers the golden tripod’s fire,\nFeathered robes vie to claim the snow-cup’s bloom bright.\nTo Penglai’s high chariot, you must ascend,\nThe faint fragrance of lesser teas cannot contend.\nYet more, the host’s skill shines through,\nCai Jun must enter Lu Yu’s abode anew.\n\n**Inscribed at the Royal Immortal’s Precious Accumulation Abbey**\nImmortals departed, their hermitage remains,\nI arrive, delighted to halt my cloud-borne reins.\nOn this seventh day of the seventh month, autumn’s sun,\nThe flower’s pistil blooms eternal, a thousand years have run.\nBefore a lone pine, flowing water springs,\nSeveral lines of Shen Yue’s playful verses cling.\nAt dusk, we pour wine to adorn the lotus fruit,\nCasually discussing the Great Beginning’s root.\n\n**Composed Hastily on the Seventh Night of the Seventh Month in the Capital**\nHow could the Seventh Night’s splendor fade so soon?\nOnce a year, the weaving maid and herder commune.\nUnstartled by the shooting stars’ high flight,\nAll gaze upward this night in full sight.\nFlowers and moon hold tender feeling, the celestial gate ajar,\nYan Mountain shares its portion, the winecup’s chill afar.\nFrom here, the solemn autumn’s shade will follow,\nFearing my robes may not suffice for winter’s hollow.\n\n**Returning from the Capital, First Visiting the Dragon Transformation Pavilion to Reclaim the Secluded Charm of Former Years, Roughly Sketching an Empty Heart in a Long Verse**\nI sought the fragrant jade of former years,\nTogether with true appreciation, we leaned on the rail’s span.\nSome followed the white sun’s flight, transforming as immortals,\nHalf for today’s treasures, the dark hexagram’s plan.\nIts luster not yet withered, spring’s creatures smile,\nIts sparse shadows come to dance in the moonlight’s aisle.\nThough Jiangnan’s autumn scenes remain bustling and grand,\nThis single lapel of wind and moon brings a chill so bland.\n\n**Returning to the Mountains**\nFor years in the capital, a prisoner most confined,\nReturning to the hills and vales, freedom at last I find.\nFlowing water murmurs as if in shared speech,\nLeisurely clouds, unbound, with me they roam and reach.\nMonkeys cling to pine shadows, watching the cinnabar stove,\nCranes and reed flowers board the fishing boat’s move.\nSuch a post is not at all ill-suited,\nWhy should the red dust’s affairs ever have polluted?\n\n**Responding to Prefect Yu and Censor’s Poem on Wandering Immortal’s Rock**\nFor years in the forest, my intent ran long,\nThrough valleys and peaks, wind and frost I’ve known.\nVulgar guests never crossed my threshold,\nThe enlightened would not deem me mad, I’ve shown.\nBy the river pavilion, I once built, recalling Ninghai’s shore,\nNow in the stone house, I dwell, like Lai Xiang’s door.\nWho would have thought the new prefect of Shangrao,\nWould visit this mountain retreat on his courtly tour?\n\n**The Moon-Stealing Leisure Hall**\nDense forests and towering peaks once detained me,\nA decade in office, not among the loftiest ranks I’d be.\nThe Red Emperor rides the dragon at summer’s end,\nChang’e shares the moon’s glow deep in the mountains’ trend.\nPasses and fords, unobstructed after war’s din,\nRest and sustenance now secure in the village’s din.\nNow, by the willow-lined dike, a true official’s retreat,\nClear streams and splendid gardens, a spacious, tranquil seat.\n\n**Inscribed at the Pavilion of Emptiness**\nNurture the empty qi to preserve life whole,\nDwelling in the Pavilion of Emptiness, just a few beams hold.\nAt South Bank, the Dao’s loftiness earns its fine name,\nIn Supreme Tenuity’s warmth, the magnolia’s pure frame.\nA hundred chapters cherish the dense green forest’s shade,\nThree bodies should inscribe Laozi’s words, thus made.\nUntil the day I attend court at the Purple Chamber’s gate,\nHow many places will the white clouds lightly freight?\n\n**For Master Xiang**",

      "translated_text": "**The Qin Studio**\n\nThe Qin Studio was my former dwelling, named for the qin—five strings it bore. Master Xiang and his disciples now reside here, discoursing on Zhuangzi and Laozi with refined delight. Once I visited, and in recalling past affairs, I found it no less splendid than the many renowned sites. The poem I composed for Master Xiang simply records the truth:\n\nThe Qin Studio’s lofty spirit holds true wind,\nMountains embrace guests, yet no compromise is pinned.\nYou ask of life and death, not in idle haste,\nBut speak of Zhuang and Lao—would you rush the taste?\nGlad now we may come and go as friends,\nYet rue the time when guests once shared these ends.\nThe recluse may compare it to his heart’s own measure,\nSuch a man would not weary the *jiaotong*’s treasure.\n\n**Celebrating the Completion of the Hunlun Hermitage**\n\nThe lofty studio is suddenly complete,\nRed stones and green pines press into the sight.\nVirtue’s constancy has long bound worldly fate,\nLike Ge Hong’s way, a home in every height.\nThe crimson-gold casket hides books most rare,\nThe jade-green flask keeps wine forever there.\nThe return to court may yet be delayed,\nI come now, ready to laugh and sing in the shade.\n\n**The Immortal Crag Temple**\n\nStill near the immortal realm, the crag stands high,\nYet what year did the true hall fall to weeds?\nToday I reach the temple’s sacred ground,\nAnd even the old black crane returns in flight.\nA single stream, like molten glass, flows bright,\nA thousand peaks of purple-green arise in sight.\nDeep in the night, the Chan monks sit with me,\nThe full moon at the window lingers free.\n\n**On Wang Jingxuan’s Sleep**\n\nAll sounds hush as the moon fills empty space,\nA single move decides the game—old Xuan’s grace.\nThe golden flask drained of the village’s wine,\nThe jade spindle sings of the primal time.\nI envy my sleepless self, spirit clear,\nYet laugh at his slumber, so deep, so near.\nTurn and tell the lone cloud on the Dao’s way:\nPurity and turbidity differ by nature’s sway.\n\n**In Response to Prefect Zhou**\n\nSeek quiet in quietude, where quiet may be found,\nPines and bamboo silent, green through autumn’s round.\nFrom beyond the world, your kindness often descends,\nHow fortunate the mountain’s edge your visit sends.\nSweet grass by the curtain grows long in the court,\nA thousand-year-old book on the bridge is sought.\nDelighted to retire here in the south’s embrace,\nProfound talks deepen gratitude for the sage’s grace.\n\n**Benzhu Hermitage**\n\nWhen the mood strikes, I climb the highest peak,\nTrue wind ever present, the climb within reach.\nIn the world’s muddy midst, who still trusts the pure?\nBeyond the clouds, how could one idle, demur?\nStrange rocks poised to fly, bright and stark,\nStartling rapids rush down with a roar’s arc.\nThe common eye may never see this sight,\nBut the perfected walk here in hidden light.\n\n**Mengqin Hermitage**\n\nAt the Purple Court, a noble guest leaves traces rare,\nA single-log bridge spans each crossing there.\nSince the whole household grasped the Supreme Ultimate,\nWho else could step in tandem through the azure air?\nBefore the balustrade, strange trees stay green through winter,\nBeneath the crag, the numinous light glows red at night.\nTrue blessing does not fade with the world’s decline,\nThose beyond the dust enter the divine.\n\n**Pinggai Hermitage**\n\nThe ancients have gone, riding dragons’ scales,\nYet their spirit lingers, recorded true in rolls.\nAt the cave’s mouth, they once bowed thrice to the sun,\nAmid the clouds, a springtime all their own unfolds.\nThe fishing line nears not—turtle and fish stay still,\nWoodsmen forget their schemes—tiger and leopard thrill.\nThe golden well has known no fresh-drawn water,\nYet not a speck of dust clouds the heart’s pure quarter.\n\n**Yuntai Hermitage**\n\nMen of Han once soared with the Dao’s flight,\nEverywhere their traces mark stillness’ height.\nPeach blossoms beyond the world are no common breed,\nCypress seeds in the wind retain their fragrance freed.\nA staff parts the emerald mist to deep halls,\nA boat rides the vast waves into the boundless.\nEighteen hundred years, thirty generations past,\nThe cloud terrace stands empty, jade pendants cast.\n\n**Jinkou Hermitage**\n\nTruth upon truth, nurturing true talent,\nTen thousand trees deep, a single stream bent.\nPearls gleam, night brightens autumn waves at rest,\nChimes hold frost’s tone as dawn’s glow is dressed.\nThe two immortals have long since departed—who meets?\nThree grains remain, awaiting my feet.\nIf the Blue Lad were sent to inspect the traces,\nNo smoke, no shadow would mar the mossy places.\n\n**Houcheng Hermitage**\n\nBeside the long river, the altar stands near,\nBeyond the altar, the river’s edge draws near.\nCinnabar in the earth stays warm through winter’s cold,\nJade bamboo forms a forest, chilled when night grows old.\nThe water crane longs for realms beyond form’s sight,\nThe mountain elder’s brows know no sorrow’s blight.\nThe staff already points to the rosy dawn,\nYet fine dust’s net still binds me on and on.\n\n**Gongmu Hermitage**\n\nAn ancient altar veiled in ten thousand pines,\nI came expressly seeking truth in these confines.\nWild clouds drift open on the green riverbank,\nSparse rain scatters through the verdant woods’ rank.\nThe true chart did not fall from a former dynasty’s hand,\nA humble robe may yet grasp the ancient sage’s stand.\nThe crane’s carriage passed near the resting place,\nPeach blossoms and flowing water still hold their grace.\n\n**Pinggang Hermitage**\n\nA thousand

spurned the light,\nCould they have coveted the five-horse cart’s might?\n\n**Yuju Hermitage**\n\nIn the seat’s corner, a lingering fragrance stays,\nAwe remains as if the master were here always.\nBamboo and stone together rise to the gate of heaven,\nA golden spring flows on, vast and uneven.\nThrough subtle discourse, delusion’s path is cleared,\nPointing directly to the nothingness of home, revered.\nIn this declining age, who can grasp even a part?\nDays follow the senses, ever more harried the heart.\n\n**Beiyu Hermitage**\n\nThe full-moon altar transforms the palace to spring,\nThrough a thousand ages, the willows by the ford still cling.\nThe blue pool brooks no worldly thing’s birth,\nWould the jade brush ever show itself to the herd?\nIn quiet seeking, I’ve

      "translated_text": "**Forty-Eight Poems on the Golden Elixir** *(continued)*\n\nShould false practitioners ask of myriad arts,\nSeek only the Purple Gold Elixir’s heart.\nOn Kunlun’s peaks, towers rise so high,\nIn the Northern Sea’s crucible, dragon and tiger vie.\n\nThis medicine, the treasure most refined,\nWhen wrought, ascends to heavenly kind.\nThe Jade Emperor’s golden decree descends,\nThen cloud-lined paths are no hard road to wend.\n\nThe vulgar throng, lost in delusion’s sway,\nSeek others’ aid yet shun the self’s own way.\nThey crave the world’s endless, fleeting hues,\nForgetting mortal flesh its bounds must lose.\n\nWhen the crucible’s elixir life extends,\nDrowned gold in water to light dust descends.\nBeneath the northern mound’s dark earth they lie—\nAll lost souls who failed to wake and fly.\n\nUnnoticed, years slip past like fingers’ trace,\nSwift as the tide that turns the river’s race.\nFew know the crucible’s sun and moon’s embrace,\nYet many grasp the world’s yin-yang’s face.\n\nAll for wealth they mar their true nature’s grace,\nFor women’s charms they drift with time’s base chase.\nHalf tread the path that leads to the Yellow Springs’ door,\nYet squander their essence to ghosts evermore.\n\nHow laughable, fools by desire entwined,\nWho hoard their breath, their vital force confined!\nThe immortals’ Way is pure and still,\nWhile lust and stench are but the world’s ill.\n\nHow can the foul and vile aspire so high?\nOnly the Returned Elixir grants the sky.\nThe arts of the bedchamber spread in vain,\nBeguiling countless souls again and again.\n\nWhen did the Yin-Gathering Elixir arise?\nEven Liu Zhen of Later Han met his demise.\nBound still to the wheel of return they spin,\nHow can lust’s folly profit the dull within?\n\nThe dog’s wild antics deemed a wondrous art,\nYet ghosts and spirits’ schemes deceive the heart.\nHow much finer the Way of quiet non-doing’s might,\nWhere one crucible’s gold nurtures the Infant Bright!\n\nThe Infant’s crown blooms with lotus fair,\nYet falsehoods swarm like hemp, a tangled snare.\nThey speak not of refining from one crucible’s core,\nBut claim three carts’ conveyance bears the lore.\n\nThe Mud Pill Palace’s path steams clear,\nThe Purple Court’s boundless worth none may compare.\nTo guide the lost in dust’s bewildering maze,\nSeek the root’s truth—no need for vain laments’ haze.\n\nHasten to find a master, point to water and gold,\nFollow the fire’s time to gather the floating and cold.\nNine reflections reveal the Tathāgata’s face,\nTwelve years unfold the Recluse’s heart’s embrace.\n\nThe empty chariot’s lead is swiftly won,\nYet mercury’s dragon-car resists the sun.\nSince first I drank the nectar’s sweet delight,\nI’ve dwelt deep in the Purple Court’s pure height.\n\nThis fleeting life, a dream’s restless stir,\nHow few turn back to seal the Three Passes’ door!\nThe Yellow Dame steadies—easy the parting’s art,\nYet the White Tiger’s flight tests the seeker’s heart.\n\nThe Vermilion Bird enters the furnace, three acres still,\nThe Dark Turtle guards the crucible, a life at will.\nThis luminous mystery I’ve come to know,\nYet hide its mechanism in the old mountains’ glow.\n\nSpeak not of immortal bones, nor seek the Elixir’s flame,\nThis principle is profound, its proper gate the same.\nFew lost ones know to turn back to the root,\nYet this teaching plants the seed as truth’s firm foot.\n\nTortoise and snake, great and small, must often feed,\nThe sun and moon’s essence wholly consume with speed.\nOnly when a true master reveals the way,\nCan the wilds’ barrows not claim your clay?\n\nThe immortals’ wondrous work is hard to spy,\nMany learn the Way yet lose it to desire’s lie.\nIf you can grasp fire and water’s truth at last,\nThen east and west at last stand clear and vast.\n\nMix not true lead with common lead’s alloy,\nNor rank the true wife with the world’s decay.\nWhen Kan and Li unite, the body finds peace,\nOnly in sloth do husband and wife cease.\n\nThe Yellow Sprout’s treasure—speak not lightly,\nThe White Snow’s mystery—dare not slight it.\nNot that I hoard this secret in rustic guise,\nBut the immortals’ medicine the vulgar despise.\n\nFloating and sinking, the Mao-You path divides,\nTransformation’s gate for tortoise and snake abides.\nOf ten thousand students, scarce one or two,\nYet false \"Dao-friends\" fill the earth anew.\n\nPreserve the spirit, know your original face,\nThis subtle principle may yet be learned apace.\nWhen the leakless is complete, the leaking ends,\nThe ford of delusion crossed, the true ford begins.\n\nMortal life scarce grants a thousand years’ span,\nYet the immortal realm turns ten thousand springs with ease.\nHow pitiful, the lost in endless maze,\nWho gladly cast their spirits to the northern dust’s haze!\n\nSome turn to Buddha, then to immortals’ lore,\nTwo paths they grope, yet neither explore.\nMost err in paths that lead to confusion’s snare,\nAnd see how swiftly the lost change and fare.\n\nRefine the medicine within your own frame,\nFoolish to seek the lotus in the flame.\nSeek only the self, seek life’s true thread,\nNot the three thousand or the great thousand’s spread.\n\nThe Black Dragon and the Tiger’s Ford are not hard to part,\nBegin with the gate of settled spirit’s art.\nWhen White Snow is refined to match sun and moon,\nWhen Yellow Sprout is consumed, you’ll rise beyond the rune.\n\nWithin the Four Spirits’ crucible, death may flee,\nIn the Five Colors’ nectar, the soul returns to thee.\nHow many oysters in the world can boast such might?\nLose not your root to wealth or beauty’s blight.\n\nSwiftly discern the floating gold in water’s tide,\nIf you refine it well, even ghosts will abide.\nThe Four Spirits guard the sacred furnace tight,\nNine revolutions deepen the elixir’s light.\n\nDragon and tiger reverse their paths to meet,\nTortoise and snake rise in flames, fierce and fleet.\nWhen the Five Colors swirl in radiant display,\nThe chamber glows to illuminate the way.\n\nThe Zhou Tian’s fire-timing fools the common kind,\nEven Embryonic Breath’s coils are not refined.\nIn the Purple Court, gold gathers, dragon’s fire seed,\nOn Kunlun’s slopes, jade flows, tiger’s spring runs freed.\n\nWhere the Three Lotuses break, the spirit’s power divides,\nWhen the One Child is born, the dust’s bonds subside.\nTo all who rush and strive in vain pursuit,\nTrue lead and true mercury never leave the root.\n\nWithin Kunlun’s halls, the Purple Gold Elixir gleams,\nNot for mortal eyes—only the immortal’s dreams.\nIf fate grants you a share to extend your span,\nNaturally free from hunger and cold’s ban.\n\nTiger and dragon, lead and mercury in the Geng-Xin crucible’s glow,\nGreat and small tortoise and snake on the Taiyi altar’s show.\nWhen one pill is wrought, five hues take flight,\nHeaven’s message is no hard thing to recite.\n\nThis toiling life speeds by like a shuttle’s throw,\nHasten to refine the true, the demons to outgo.\nTurn the floating and sinking in the Northern Sea’s vast tide,\nLose not yourself to dreams in Nanke’s shade.\n\nIn the Jia-Geng crucible, gold is not few,\nIn the Mao-You altar, earth is plentiful too.\nYet when the chamber blazes with radiant light,\nPurify your heart, consume it—freedom’s in sight.\n\nChasing fleeting fame and profit’s hollow gain,\nHeed not how swiftly time steals youth again.\nDazzled by beauty’s bloom before your eyes,\nUnseen, your temples whiten with surprise.\n\nThe sturdy crucible extends life’s thread,\nYet passion’s reckless indulgence mars the true instead.",

      "translated_text": "I urge you to seek the elixir’s secret art,\nNurture the infant within to transcend the dusty world.\nHow swiftly fleeting are these glimpses of light—\nBorn and reborn, the wheel turns without cease.\n\nAll for greed and delusion’s trifling cause,\nYet none think to still the heart and cultivate the true.\nTiger and dragon serve as chariots to ascend the sky,\nLead and mercury are the boat to leave this world behind.\n\nHow many immortals pity the common folk,\nLeaving the elixir’s formula to save the mortal stream.\nRide the dragon, mount the crane—no need for fear,\nFor this is the golden pill’s singular power.\n\nFive-hued cloud-dragons rise from the sea’s depths,\nNine-fold wind-tigers soar to the celestial court.\nWhere jade blossoms meet, observe the ren and gui,\nWhen the purple palace unites, rely on bing and ding.\n\nThis truth is not for lesser minds to grasp,\nUnless your name is the Star of Lesser Brilliance.\nThis toiling life speeds by swift as wind,\nHasten to slay the Three Corpses and Five Worms.\n\nLet not the fox and fox-spirit steal the crucible’s treasure,\nBut bid the dragon and tiger guard the true void.\nWithin the crucible’s precious vessel, tend the fire in time,\nAnd the infant in your belly will grow ever more radiant.\n\nGood men and women, heed these words,\nLest you drown in wine and lust’s delusion.\nMost strange and wondrous things beguile the seeker,\nAt the first glimpse of wanton desire, the heart stirs.\n\nIt is but the song that pours out the body’s treasure,\nHow can the gold in water remain firm?\nThe path to heaven stands open, yet none tread it,\nThe gates of hell are barred, yet crowds rush in.\n\nI send this message to the men and women of the world:\nWithdraw your steps from the burning house, hide in the mountain forest.\nFor those who indulge in excess, the Lord is watchful,\nCondemning them to become foxes and beasts, tails trailing behind.\n\nThey say five hundred years must pass before transformation,\nYet who knows that in three thousand days the spirit is remade?\nWhere the thunder’s fire is put to use,\nDog and fang alike serve as kin in this teaching.\n\nThe fox-spirits, kin to vengeful demons,\nAssume bewitching forms to lead many astray.\nThe tales of Liu Chen and Ruan Zhao are far from true—\nToday, let the wise ponder this deeply.\n\nMistaking the celestial palace for lust’s domain,\nThey fill the purple court with deceit and guile.\nThe pure struggle of the cave admits no impurity,\nWhile the dark recesses of the grotto breed strange wonders.\n\nHow deeply deluded are the people of this world,\nHow many have lost their lives to fox-spirits?\nBy the altar of Master Zi, near the Purple Tenuity,\nIn the deep of night, the wind’s light is falsely praised.\n\nThey speak not of seeking lead to prolong life,\nBut claim mere herbs can extend the years.\nThe immortal elixir need not be sought beyond the body,\nWhy place it before the door like a household god?\n\nPerhaps a mountain spirit has beguiled you,\nMaking you see杂色 as commonplace.\nTrue lead and true mercury are most trustworthy,\nYet this truth, though clear, is seldom practiced.\n\nIn the White Tiger’s crucible, jade nectar forms,\nSurpassing the serpent’s palace where golden essence is nurtured.\nKan’s man and Li’s woman stand in threefold array,\nSun and moon, east and west, unite in one journey.\n\nIf you find the path within this,\nThe infant’s visage will naturally take shape.\nThe golden elixir’s bone-transmuting power does not deceive,\nYet most mortals are easily led astray.\n\nIf the red serpent soars north of the sea,\nThe jade hare will naturally run to the western sky.\nThe Lotus Messenger wields the true water,\nThe Fire Dragon King opens the great path.\n\nTurn your efforts to refining within this,\nFlight and ascent lie in but a single *daogui*.\nFortunate is the one who grasps the profound truth of cultivation,\nDiligently refining the gold within the water.\n\nIf you know the purple court’s lotus can be planted,\nYou will believe the path to Kunlun can be found.\nSun and moon unite, their light above and below,\nAfter white and blue merge, colors float and sink.\n\nSince gaining this true message,\nThe world’s glory and shame no longer touch me.\nWhy waste youth studying poetry and books,\nWhen seeking the true preserves the jade flask?\n\nNo need to weary the spirit wandering the Red Waters,\nSimply know how to preserve your nature and nurture the mysterious pearl.\nWho in this world possesses the crucible’s sun and moon?\nThe furnace’s cinnabar is unknown to the age.\n\nMen laugh at the solitude of this path,\nYet this solitude differs from the world’s.\nOnce awakened to this life and the next,\nWhy cling to empty talk of Chan?\n\nThe Flower Pool’s water is called the elixir of ascent,\nThe golden crucible’s lotus is the key to leaving the world.\nOnly when you delve into its wonders do you begin to know,\nAnd when the work is complete, you see the mystery’s depth.\n\nSince receiving the enlightened master’s guidance,\nI have come to trust the cloud chariot’s escape from the dusty shore.\nThe three passions’ gates stand open without suspicion,\nYet it is the common folk who refuse to enter.\n\nMoon’s essence and sun’s spirit form the path,\nTiger’s spring and serpent’s fire serve as ladder and go-between.\nTend diligently to the three fields to secure the primordial seed,\nFirmly seal the crucible, opening it only later.\n\nFrom formlessness, form naturally arises,\nThe true embryo can unbind the spirit’s knot.\nThe Crimson Bridge’s qi-circulation is all in vain—\nIt is the common folk who cling to appearances and stray.\n\nThe Northern Sea’s crucible divides creation,\nThe Southern Darkness’ palace aligns with heaven’s principle.\nEmptiness and nothingness are achieved through the returning elixir’s power,\nIn the indistinct, the body becomes one with the wondrous Dao.\n\nIf you can perceive this within the floating life,\nThen floating life is but a fermenting brew.\nCountless Dao companions fill the dusty world,\nYet how few bear true names, how few are real?\n\nFailing to grasp that mercury and lead are supreme treasures,\nThey turn to the furnace and crucible to smelt silver.\nWithin lies the true method for gathering the medicine,\nWithout, they seek the elixir in vain toil.\n\nHow much worse for those lost on the path,\nWho not only mislead themselves but others as well.\nBeneath the Nine Perfections Mountain lies the Flower Pool,\nIts waters prolong life, yet the world remains unaware.\n\nGolden tangerines grow there, radiant in hue,\nSmall as pellets, yet rainbow clouds take flight.\nSent to the Northern Sea’s depths for safekeeping,\nCarried to the Southern Culmen, where strange wonders unfold.\n\nOnly when the work within this is complete,\nWill yellow clouds, piece by piece, embrace the infant.\nUpon the Nine Perfections Mountain rise towers and terraces,\nWhere sun and moon float above, purple qi amassed.\n\nFrom the Northern Sea’s depths, golden peonies bloom,\nFrom the Southern Culmen’s palace, jade roses emerge.\nThe Three Clarities’ gates hold the three fields’ secrets,\nNine cycles of effort trace ninefold returns.\n\nWhen this priceless treasure is refined,\nLet others laugh at my foolish toil.\nRestlessly seeking masters, wearily rushing about,\nAll for the divine water that is the immortals’ homeland.\n\nA single crucible glows with molten gold,\nThree fields gleam with jade-like nectar.\nAt midnight, only the true fire coils,\nIn the chamber, unnoticed, rainbow light shines.\n\nA single grain transcends the mundane—how weighty it is!\nOnly then do I trust the path to Penglai is long.\nThe great medicine in the crucible is unknown to the world,\nAs sun and moon both descend, conception is not lost.\n\nNot only the wondrous light of the fire-jujube,\nBut the profound principle called the \"intertwined pear\" is sought.\nThe golden elixir’s bone-transmuting power does not deceive,\nYet most mortals’ natures are easily led astray.\n\nIf the red serpent soars north of the sea,\nThe jade hare will naturally run to the western sky.\nThe Lotus Messenger wields the true water,\nThe Fire Dragon King opens the great path.\n\nTurn your efforts to refining

bright;\nthe jade flask’s spirit stirs, bound for the western source.\nI envy the grassy terrace, where we do not go together—\nmay the bamboo’s wind bring you secluded coolness.\n\n*Lotus Flower*\nFaint red blooms, delicate fragrance,\na leisurely one plucks it, sends it to a mountain chamber.\nOnly its green purity transcends dust and grime—\nit must outshine all other flowers in grace.\n\n*Exhortation to Disciples Returning to the Mountains*\nPast kalpas’ causes meet in this kalpa’s gathering;\nyesterday’s visage, today’s transformation.\nIn the world, seas turn to mulberry fields—\nbeware lest you return to display your puppet’s guise.\n\n*Instructions to Disciple Tang*\nYou seek to aid the people, not for yourself;\nI crave the Dao’s cultivation, heedless of poverty.\nYou must strive with resolve to achieve your work—\nlest, through procrastination, you grow old in vain.\n\n*Composed After Transmitting Blessings*\nThe Daoist’s vow is as boundless as heaven,\nonly when all beings are delivered will I deliver myself.\nIf even the slightest speck remains unblessed,\nI shall never forsake the path to heaven’s ascent.\n\n*Seeing Off Xu Zhengzhi of Nine Dragons to Mount Magu*\nTreading through sunny snow, crossing the rapids,\nwho can follow the crane’s traces or cloud’s trail?\nLike your coming, you depart with nothing—\nyet, gathering your return, you are the Three Mountains.\n\n*Matching Rhymes on the Moon, Assigned the Character \"Clear\"*\nThe azure vault, limpid and clear,\na single moon, tender-hearted, bright across the four seas.\nWithin the flowered courtyard’s empty halls,\nthe feathered one’s heart and gall grow cold.\n\n*Visiting a Friend, Not Met—Inscribed*\nWithin the hut, one walks the path outside;\noutside the hut, one comes to sit within.\nHaphazardly patched with thatch, loosely bound—\nyear after year, wind and rain rend it anew.\n\nHere ends *The Recorded Sayings of the Thirty-Third Celestial Master, Xu
