  "full_translation": "**Record of the Perfected One of Danyang**\n\n*Scripture Title:* *Record of the Perfected One of Danyang*\nRecorded by Jin Magang, compiled by Wang Touzhong. One fascicle.\nSource edition: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Great Mystery Section*.\n\n**Record of the Perfected One of Danyang**\nCompiled by Wang Yizhong of Lingyin\n\nIn the third month of the *guimao* year of the Dading reign, I first paid homage to my master at the southern hermitage of Fan Mingshu of Muping. The master asked: \"From whence have you come?\" I replied: \"I come from eastern Wu. Admiring your virtue, I see that you do not regard wealth as riches, but abide in serene contentment, seated in the advancement of the Dao. Having heard of your renown, I rejoiced and wished to attend you, bearing your towel and sandals, to receive but a single word of instruction.\"\n\nThe master, pleased, said: \"It is rare for one so young to harbor the aspiration to cultivate the Dao.\" After a long pause, he added: \"When hungry, go eat. After eating, go sleep.\"\n\nOne day, seeing me stand with hands clasped in respect, the master suddenly rebuked: \"A Daoist need only be unobstructed and at ease—do not cling to appearances. This hermitage is no grand hall, nor are you an official. If you insist on mundane courtesies, then go elsewhere to socialize. As the ancients said: *‘On the three mountains, human sentiments grow faint; across the four seas, the homeless probe the depths of the Dao’*—these words were not spoken in vain.\"\n\nThe master often taught: \"Those who study the Dao must awaken on their own. Failure to do so stems from benighted confusion. To dispel such confusion, first purify the heart, attaining clarity and stillness. When the work is complete, success is self-evident—there is no need to seek confirmation from others. Thus, the skill or clumsiness of one’s practice becomes plainly apparent.\"\n\nAs the master walked along the road to eastern Mu, whether he encountered monks or Daoists—whether familiar or strangers—he would always bow first. His attendant, puzzled, asked: \"You share no prior acquaintance with them—why bow?\" The master replied: \"The Dao takes softness, weakness, humility, and deference as its foundation. Moreover, the Three Teachings share the same gate, differing only in their doors. Confucius said: *‘Even if it were to hold the whip of a groom, I would still do it.’* I have never heard that a single bow could be considered a transgression.\"\n\nThe master said: \"The Patriarch was once deeply versed in literature. After attaining the Dao, his wit became even sharper. Whether composing acrostics, dissecting characters, or crafting riddles and linked verses, he required no deliberation. He often composed poems in response to others, including those with intricate rhyme schemes. While others had already finished their verses, the Patriarch would be the last to respond, effortlessly weaving in all two hundred and sixty ‘golden joints’ of rhyme. All marveled and sighed in admiration, deeming his words those of an immortal. Who today could match this? Only Lord Fanxi comes close in style.\"\n\nThe master said: \"When the Patriarch once traveled to Dengzhou, he wore a bamboo hat on his head and tattered robes, carrying a staff and a bronze mirror. His appearance was most peculiar and ancient. He begged in the market, yet none in Dengzhou recognized him. That night, returning to the temple, he inscribed a quatrain on the wall:\n\n*Parted from Zhongnan’s waters and bamboo village,*\n*No sons or daughters remain at home.*\n*Thousands of miles away to seek a knowing friend,*\n*To lead me through the gate of undying life.*\n\nAt dawn, he brushed his robes and set off. Several days later, the prefect Heshi Lie Miao visited the temple. Seeing the poem on the wall, he sighed in admiration and composed a response in the same rhyme:\n\n*Turning back, three years since leaving my old village,*\n*Forgotten the courtyard bamboos and growing grandchildren.*\n*Someday I’ll brush my sleeves and seek you out—*\n*Will you permit a tranquil knock at your gate?*\n\nThe master said: \"A bland diet nurtures qi; forsaking anger nurtures one’s nature. Enduring humiliation and humility nurture virtue and guard unity. Serenity and tranquility nurture the Dao. To leave one’s name unrecorded in registers and one’s heart unshackled by power and profit—this is how one sheds the mortal husk and becomes a companion of Heaven.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Wine is the brew that disorders the mind; meat is the substance that severs life. It is best to abstain entirely. While transgressions of wine and meat may yet be forgiven, to transgress in lust is a sin beyond absolution. Why? Lust is more ferocious than wolves and tigers—it ruins fine conduct, undermines good deeds, drains essence, extinguishes spirit, and may even cost one’s life. Thus it is the greatest transgression for a Daoist.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Nothing brings greater joy and ease than idleness. If a Daoist grows weary of dwelling in a hut, he may find one or two companions, sling a satchel over his shoulder, and lean on a staff, singing as he wanders. Should he encounter fine mountains or rivers, he may linger awhile—never rushing the journey.\"\n\nThe master addressed his servant: \"A student of the Dao must persevere to the end, lest he abandon the path halfway and become a laughingstock. You are, after all, a scholar—do you not know that all men must establish themselves through some endeavor? How much more so for one who pursues the Dao, for this is the greatest undertaking of a man’s life.\"\n\nThe master once inscribed a couplet in large characters for his Daoist companions:\n*\"Swiftly topple the mountain of self and other,*\n*Hastily break open the cave of dragon and tiger.\"*\n\nHis servant asked: \"I understand the mountain of self and other, but what is the cave of dragon and tiger, and where does it lie?\"\nThe master smiled: \"Heaven’s mechanism cannot be lightly disclosed. Examine it closely—will you awaken or not?\"\n\nOne day, the master summoned his servant, who arrived after some delay.\n\"Where have you been?\" the master asked.\nThe servant replied: \"I had just risen from a satisfying midday nap, my spirit clear and serene. By my bed lay a copy of the *Zhuangzi*, which I picked up and read—that is why I was not here.\"\nThe master said: \"The Dao requires the heart’s accord. If you remain bound by texts, when will you ever reach an end? As the saying goes: *Awakening to the *Nanhua* only deepens the delusion.*\"\n\nWhile in Huating, the master said: \"What is the Dao? The blackness of the navel is its root source—do you not know it is what issues from the nostrils? Have you not heard Guangchengzi’s words: *Let the cinnabar turtle and river chariot rest still; the crane’s embryo and tortoise’s breath flow on endlessly.*\"\n\nAddressing his disciples, the master said: \"Devote yourself single-mindedly to the Dao, and anyone may become an immortal. Unlike the worldly pursuit of advancement, which brings demotion and failure, the Confucians are broad but lack essentials, while the Dao is simple and easy to practice. But the highest teaching is nothing other than purity and non-action.\"\n\nThe master lived in a bare chamber, furnished only with a desk, a bed, brushes, ink, and a sheepskin—nothing more. In the morning, he took a bowl of congee; at noon, a bowl of rice. Beyond that, he tasted no other food. One day, he summoned his servant and bade him sit for a long while. The servant asked: \"Does my master’s Dao involve deliberate action?\"\nThe master replied: \"No. Though my songs often speak of dragon and tiger, infant and crone, these are but metaphors. The wonder of the Dao lies in nothing more than nurturing the blackness. People drown in profit and fame, dissipating their blackness. For the student of the Dao, there is no other task but to cultivate qi. When the heart’s fluid descends and the kidney’s qi ascends, meeting in the spleen, the primordial qi swirls and coalesces—there the elixir gathers. The liver and lungs are the pathways of this movement. Through long practice of stillness, you will come to know it yourself. Without nurturing the blackness, even if you could carry Mount Tai across the North Sea, it would not be the Dao.\" These words were spoken ten days before his transformation.\n\nHis servant and two or three companions, Cao and Liu, stood outside the chamber when the master suddenly emerged and said: \"The Dao is nothing more than purity, non-action, carefree wandering, and freedom from attachment. These twelve words—if you can chew them to pieces, you may become a thoroughgoing Daoist. Trust an old man’s words and practice them, and you will surely benefit. I will not deceive you young ones.\"\n\nWhile staying in a hut in the western outskirts of Huang County, the master recited:\n*\"Though you spend ten thousand taels of gold a day,*\n*Simple robes and plain fare are best.\"*\n\nHe said: \"Last year, passing through a frontier pass, I heard someone recite these words and admired their truth, so I remembered them. I do not know who composed them.\"\nMa Yuanzhi said: \"These words are from Abbot Shun’s *Weijiang Collection*.\"\nThe master exclaimed: \"How marvelous these words are!\"\n\nThe master said: \"Whose family tradition is this? The teachings of Zhong and Lü were transmitted directly.\" He then recited a verse:\n*\"A single spark of spirit shines through the great void,*\n*No painter’s hand, however skilled, could capture it.*\n*Do not idly compare it to the bright moon—*\n*How could the flawed and green ever resemble me?\"*\n\"This verse reveals a hint of its edge,\" he remarked.\n\nThe master said: \"Qi is difficult to master—swift as a galloping horse. Only stillness makes it manageable. You must abandon external desires. Though splendor may dazzle before your eyes, regard it as if gazing into a deep mountain valley—such is the heart of a Daoist. If you have not reached the ground of no-mind, you cannot control it. Thus the man of Dao values nothing so much as no-mind.\"\n\nThe master continued: \"When the heart is settled, emotions fade; when the body is empty, qi circulates. When the heart dies, spirit lives; when yang flourishes, yin dissipates. This is the natural principle, yet the deluded do not understand. They think only of their descendants and dismiss the study of the Dao as useless—how can they not reflect more deeply?\"\n\nThe master said: \"I was over forty when I met my teacher and entered the Dao, which is why my temples are now streaked with gray. Yet within my belly, there is another strand of hair—how could this have come about? For over a decade, I longed to go to Guanzhong, nurturing only my spirit and qi. It is like one calling out in an empty valley: respond to the call, and what else could it be but the resonance of its emptiness? My friends do not believe this, but if they cultivate stillness in solitude, they will come to know it themselves.\"\n\nThe master spoke of Master Haichan: \"Originally a minister of Yan, he awakened to the Dao one day and severed all family ties. His poem contains the lines: *'I cast off the fiery household of three thousand, / Abandoned the gate and soldiers of a million homes.'* Later, he sustained himself by begging, performing in markets, even carrying wine and combs to brothels—yet felt no shame. Some later Dao students claim, *'I come from wealth and nobility—how can you compare me to Haichan?'*\"\n\nThe master said: \"If one can discern the Dao of clarity and stillness, it is perfect in every way. Thus the scripture says: *'If a person can remain constantly clear and still, / Heaven and earth all return to them.'* By 'heaven and earth,' it does not mean the external sky above and earth below, but rather the heaven and earth within the body. The diaphragm and above is heaven; the diaphragm and below is earth. If heavenly qi descends and earthly vessels flow, with harmony between above and below, essence and qi will naturally stabilize.\" This was spoken by Master Xiaoren.\n\nThe master said: \"The subtlety of preserving qi lies in safeguarding essence, and one must be especially vigilant during sleep. When about to rest, let right mindfulness arise, all thoughts dissolve, and the body lie curled to the side. Let the breath flow gently through the nose, the hun-soul not stir within, the spirit not wander without—then qi and essence will naturally settle.\"\n\nThe master said: \"The Confucians say: *'Repay virtue with virtue, repay resentment with uprightness.'* The perfected once said: *'Bind friends with trust, repay sternness with grace.'\"\n\nThis may be called perfection.\n\nDuring the master’s time in Laizhou, a man named Jiang Xi presented him with the *Transmission of Master Lü*. As the master read the passage on how worldly people pursue only fame and profit, unaware of the spirit within, chasing external things without return, and losing all celestial authenticity—who then is to blame?—he closed the scroll and said to Xi: \"These words truly strike the principle. Yet with no one in the world to awaken, how difficult the Dao is to practice!\"\n\nThere was a man named Han Tao, styled Qingfu, who admired the character of Tao Yuanming and Shao Yaofu, styling himself the Master of Anle Garden. When the master returned from the Guanzhong region to Muyi, he passed through Jinan and was invited to the garden, where he was served a simple meal. Afterward, Tao knelt before the master and said: \"From my youth I have admired the Dao, and now my temples are gray. Fortunate to meet you, master, I beg a single word to illuminate my ignorance.\"\n\nThe master replied: \"The Dao takes non-action as its essence, forgetting words as its function, softness and weakness as its root, and purity and stillness as its foundation. If applied to oneself, one must moderate diet, cut off thoughts, sit in stillness to regulate the breath, and rest peacefully to nurture qi. When the mind does not wander, the nature stabilizes; when the body is not wearied, essence is preserved; when the spirit is not disturbed, the elixir coalesces. Then one may extinguish passions in emptiness and pacify the spirit in the ultimate. This may be called attaining the wondrous Dao without stepping beyond the courtyard.\"\n\nHan bowed in gratitude and said: \"The great Dao is vast and formless, beyond all questioning. Now, having heard these wondrous teachings, I have found the gate and entered.\"\n\nCao and Lai, both originally Confucian scholars, had studied the Dao for many years and shared an unbroken bond with the master. They once asked in leisure: \"When you were in Guanzhong, how did you cultivate the Dao?\"\n\nCao Lai replied: \"The master wore a single unlined robe through winter and summer, ate coarse food to satisfaction, and even in the bitter cold of winter, his hut had no fire, and he sometimes drank ice-cold water. Yet his spirit and qi remained harmonious and smooth, without the slightest chill. After ten years of this, if his abdomen had not contained the Dao’s qi, he could not have endured it.\"\n\nThe master said: \"In all matters, one must prepare in advance to avoid disaster. Thus, those who cultivate the Dao must guard against passions and desires in their youth and prime, making early preparations—then immortality may be hoped for. But if one waits until gray hairs hang at the temples and vitality has declined before beginning to study the Dao, it is like seeking furs in the depths of winter—is this not too late?\"\n\nThe master said: \"The thirty-six Daoist breathing exercises and the twenty-four stages of returning the elixir are but the gradual gates to entering the Dao and cannot be practiced directly. The great Dao, if confined to the furnace and crucible, borrowing the forms of tortoise and snake, is to create trouble where none exists and add artifice to one’s nature. This is to impose greatly upon people.\"\n\nThus, the Daoist tradition has left behind countless scriptures and texts—thousands of classics and ten thousand treatises—but they may be summarized in a single word: *purity and stillness*.\n\nThe master said: \"Purity and stillness: purity is to purify the source of the heart, stillness is to still the sea of qi. When the heart’s source is pure, external things cannot disturb it, so passions settle and spirit-light arises. When the sea of qi is still, deviant desires cannot intrude, so essence is preserved and the abdomen is full. Thus, calming the heart is like settling water, and nurturing qi is like raising a child. When qi flourishes, the spirit becomes numinous; when the spirit is numinous, qi transforms—this is the result of purity and stillness. If one practices arts with intention and effort, these are finite techniques. If one practices the principle of non-action and non-intention, this is the infinite emptiness of purity.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Non-action means not thinking, not scheming. Guard against love, desire, anger, and resentment; accumulate neither profit nor harm. In this way, though one may act, one remains in non-action; though one may engage in affairs, one remains without affairs. How much more so when one focuses on purifying the heart, stilling the mind, and nurturing qi—preserving the spirit to wander in the land of carefree ease, entering the realm of nothing-whatsoever.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Liu Gaoshang lived in a humble abode for forty years, doing nothing else but emptying his heart, filling his abdomen, shedding ornament, forgetting fame, abandoning profit, purifying his spirit, preserving his qi—then the elixir coalesced of itself, and immortality was achieved.\" There was a eulogy for him that said: *\"Block the openings, close the gates.\"* I once recited these words, but now I see this man—how simple and fitting!\n\nThe master said: \"Non-mind does not mean being mindless like a cat or dog. It is to maintain the mind in the realm of purity and stillness, without deviant thoughts. Thus, the common person lacks a pure and still mind, while the Daoist lacks a mind tainted by dust and grime—not that both are equally mindless, like wood, stone, cats, or dogs.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Not arising, not ceasing—seeing the Tathāgata. When awakened, one escapes rebirth.\" Qiu Jun said: \"This is the emergence of the yin spirit. When one reaches the celestial court and suddenly sees a pair of flowers flying, then the yang spirit emerges. This is the first stage.\"\n\nThe master said:\n*\"The great Dao is far from human passions,*\n*Non-action is the wondrous root and foundation.*\n*In the world, if one loves nothing,*\n*Afflictions will not follow.\"*\n\nThe master said: \"If a cultivator’s merit and practice are not yet complete when the great limit arrives, sages and worthies will not let them die. But if one does not cultivate at all, when the great limit comes, they cannot escape it.\"\n\nThe master said: \"A single thought unbroken—rest for a lifetime.\"\n\nGong Daosheng asked: \"When in the state of profound stillness, what then?\"\n\nThe master replied: \"Bring it together with profound stillness—then even that is not needed.\"\n\nYu Qingfeng asked: \"I have cultivated for many years, yet my Dao-eye is not clear, and my mind-ground is not numinous. Why?\"\n\nThe master said: \"There is no other reason—your practice of the Dao is not refined.\"\n\nThe master said: \"All men and women, from beginningless time, have been bound by love, desire, and endless passions, never leaving the cycle of the six realms. All births—from wombs, eggs, moisture, or transformation—all forms and natures arise from love and desire. Nature arises from love, life arises from desire, and from love and desire arise fortune and misfortune, jealousy and obstruction. From this, the wheel of rebirth turns endlessly. The Dharma says: to purify the earth, first purify the heart.\"\n\nIf the heart is pure, the wheel of rebirth naturally stills.\n\nThe master was fond of eating porridge; at noon, he would consume a single bowl, then spend the rest of the day discoursing on the Dao, tirelessly instructing and guiding his disciples. He was, in nature, a kind and virtuous gentleman. While in Laiyang, he composed verses of varying lengths, including the line: *\"After a meal of porridge, one must accomplish a full measure of practice.\"* Let scholars take heed of this. Those who merely eat, drink, and sit idly—without making the Dao their concern—may well be judged for their negligence.\n\nThe master said: \"Those who study the Dao need not widely peruse scriptures, for they only scatter the mind and hinder one’s progress in the Dao. However, reading the *River Earl’s Commentary on the Dao De Jing* or the *Jinling Master’s Commentary on the Yin Fu Jing* from time to time does no harm. Yet even this is not as good as abandoning all reading, sitting in stillness like a deaf and blind man, and nurturing the qi—this is the highest strategy.\"\n\nThe master said: \"The Daoist, in walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, must not for even a moment let the heart stray from the Dao. When walking, place your feet on level ground; when standing, fix your spirit in the vast emptiness; when sitting, regulate the breath at the tip of your nose; when sleeping, embrace the pearl below the navel. With long practice, the breath becomes harmonized without interruption, and though one may seem dull-witted all day, this is the true work—it is not mere artificial effort or forced discipline.\"\n\nThe master said: \"For those newly embarking on the Dao, from this day forward, let go of all worldly affairs and do not let them weigh on the heart. If even the slightest thread of attachment remains, the Dao will not take root. Do not dwell on the past, nor anticipate the future—simply attend to the present moment, and you become a person without cares.\"\n\nThe master also said: \"The Daoist does not resent poverty, for poverty is the foundation of nurturing life. When hungry, eat a bowl of porridge; when tired, spread a bundle of straw to sleep. Living simply from day to day—this is the livelihood of the Daoist. Thus, know that purity is something even the wealthy and noble cannot attain.\"\n\nThe master passed through Qingshe, where he was invited to a vegetarian feast. Among the guests were several ordained monks, one of whom displayed his eloquence, engaging in contentious debate without end. The master calmly replied: \"If I set aside this body, I know nothing else.\" The monk flushed with embarrassment and could no longer find words.\n\nThe master said: \"To be a Daoist, one must be a man of resolute character—never wavering or indecisive. Keep in mind that the matter of life and destiny is of utmost importance; practice with unwavering determination, and resolve to succeed. Those who are overly sentimental or lack the will to embrace the Dao are not true seekers of the Way.\"\n\nThe master said: \"The darkness within the body must not be dispersed; the spirit within the heart must not be obscured.\" Someone asked: \"How can one prevent the qi from scattering?\" The master replied: \"By keeping the body in non-action.\" Another asked: \"How can one prevent the spirit from being obscured?\" The master replied: \"By keeping the heart free of affairs.\" Yet another asked: \"If body and heart are thus, may one then dwell in a hermitage?\" The master said: \"If you can settle everything, then it is good to rest.\"\n\nThe master said: \"The Daoist’s heart and nature must not be entangled in worldly matters. Yet to wander with a flowering staff, composing verses in the wind and moonlight, and refining one’s temperament—what harm is there in that? As for begging from door to door, pushing and shoving—this is simply the daily practice of the Daoist.\"\n\nThe master said: \"When you first entered seclusion, you begged for a meal and ate when you received one. Now, your merit and conduct have diminished—you choose where to stay and what to eat. If you proceed thus, you will never attain the Dao but will instead be forced to repay your debts.\"\n\nThe master said: \"When I first went begging in Guanzhong, I came to a wineshop where a drunkard insulted and cursed me. Later, he struck me with his fist, and I fled. When he caught hold of me, he struck me again, and I could only endure it. Have any of you encountered such demonic obstacles?\" The disciples answered: \"No.\" The master said: \"If you do, bear it well and do not contend.\"\n\nThe master said: \"The ancestral masters taught that one must not wear fine clothes, nor eat fine food, nor sing or carouse—only ensure that nothing clings to the heart.\"\n\nThe master said: \"In my secular days, I weighed meat and measured wine, but I have now abstained from them for over a decade. Even if one eats meat and drinks wine, one may still become an immortal—though the process will be slower. But if the heart does not hold to the Dao, and one indulges in wine and meat, merely gratifying the palate, the retribution will be inescapable, and one will ultimately become a lowly ghost.\"\n\nThe master said: \"The ancestral masters guided four disciples—Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma—observing how Ren Fengzi acted with virtue. The masters said: 'When one merely hears of such things, it pierces the ears; but upon seeing them, one clutches the treasure and dares not let go.' Master Liu also spoke of this.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Once, while in seclusion, I idly remarked on fresh melons. The next day, the assembly made melon-stuffed buns, and I ate three of them—thus, I was punished with three days of fasting.\"\n\nThe master said: \"The ancestral master once sent a disciple to Ninghai to beg for a little money and rice for my use. The disciple said: 'After the other brothers go, how will it be? I vow never to return to my hometown.' The master grew angry and beat him until dawn, striking him countless times. I felt the urge to retreat, but my senior brother Qiu dissuaded me, and to this day, I dare not forget his kindness.\"\n\nThe master said: \"When I was in my hometown, the ancestral master ordered me to beg in Laizhou. After several days, I hesitated. That night, I dreamed the master said: 'Tomorrow, stretch out your hand like a true man and beg boldly in the streets.' My deluded thoughts had obstructed me, so the master spoke thus.\"\n\nThe master said: \"When I returned to my hometown and first went out into the streets, the ancestral master gathered all the young boys, daubed their faces with rouge, and powdered them. I thought to myself: 'I fear encountering my children or acquaintances, but even more, I fear meeting my in-laws.' Each time I thought of stopping at Fan Mingshu’s house to rest, I would see my father-in-law already there, saying, 'This time, you need not feel ashamed.'\"\n\nA disciple asked: \"The *Record of Lord Xu’s Ascension* states that after one thousand two hundred and forty years, eight hundred people will attain immortality. How is this to be understood?\"\n\nThe master said: \"The ancestral master once spoke of teaching the common folk in their tens of thousands, and Wang Zixian later echoed this.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Zhang Wenzi had a fine saying—whenever conversing, one must always tend to the treasure that nourishes the body.\"\n\nThe master laughed: \"He sets up a stall to preach, yet it is only to exhort others.\"\n\nThe master said: \"The hundred do not sing, the ten do not admonish—if one acts of one’s own accord, it is still what the ancestral master once taught, and thus it is fulfilled.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Most people are prone to self-praise, all believing themselves superior, and thus rarely willing to humble themselves before others.\"\n\nThe master said: \"When someone picked up a donkey contract on the road, the ancestral master struck him until dawn, raining blows upon his head and face—what count could there be?\"\n\nThe master said: \"People still do not believe. Yet on a day of clear wind and bright sun, if there were one who did believe, the master would smile faintly at him.\"\n\nSuddenly, Daching said: \"With the master’s conduct as it is, how could people not believe?\"\n\nQingfeng said: \"One believer is one immortal—it is because of this lack of faith.\"\n\nThe master said: \"To deeply conceal white snow is not out of reverence; to broadly accumulate yellow sprouts is not out of greed.\"\n\nHaving spoken, he laughed and said: \"How fine is that?\"\n\nAgain he said: \"In dreams, a shadowless sword is forged; in the Dharma, the heart of passion is cast away.\"\n\nAgain he said: \"Beneath the Jade Pool, the green phoenix dances; within the Garden of Paradise, the white crane soars.\"\n\nWhen the master returned to the shores of the sea, the households all strictly observed fasting and precepts, submitting to the Five Assemblies established by the ancestral master.\n\nA young disciple, hearing that Master Ma was in Deng Prefecture, gathered over a hundred followers and said to the master: \"We have each bathed and dwelled in stillness, abstaining from meat and wine for seven days. We wish to join the Pure Assembly to pray for blessings and dissolve past karma.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Good. If you have maintained purity for seven days and still speak of blessings—how much greater is the fortune of Ma Feng’s disciples, who uphold purity throughout their lives, forsaking desires and abstaining from meat and wine!\"\n\nThe assembly all bowed in reverence and sighed: \"The teachings of purity are truly inconceivable.\" From then on, the people of the three prefectures, household by household, received the teachings. Gradually spreading to the ten directions, those who heard the wind of it turned toward faith, and the great teaching flourished anew, beginning with the master.\n\nThe master asked his disciples: \"How many hours are there in a day?\"\n\nThe disciples replied: \"Six hours in a day.\"\n\nThe master said: \"How many hours are there in a day and night?\"\n\nThe disciples said: \"Twelve hours in a day and night.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Within these twelve hours of day and night, the Way of Heaven moves, revolving and transforming creation—is there even a moment’s pause?\"\n\nThe disciples replied: \"There is no pause.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Those who study the Dao must emulate the Way of Heaven, revolving and transforming the creation within themselves. In all twelve hours, they must remain ever pure and ever still, not allowing even a speck of dust to arise in their thoughts. Only then is this cultivation. Progressing day by day, month by month, without interruption, one may then become an immortal. If one slackens in effort or strays from conduct, how can one attain liberation? I observe you all—within these twelve hours, not one of you has ever devoted a single hour wholeheartedly to the Dao. Yet you accept the offerings of patrons from the ten directions—how will you repay them? When you close your eyes one day, you will return to the wheel of rebirth. When will you ever escape it?\n\n\"I now urge you: still your minds and dispel desires, untouched by the myriad entanglements. When spirit and qi harmonize and merge, this is the Dao. Cultivate thus, and you will not err. If you procrastinate and grow lax, failing to uphold the practice, the fault is not mine.\n\n\"Do you not consider your seven generations of ancestors, who in life committed manifold evil deeds and now suffer torments in the dark realms? They long for their descendants to attain the Dao, that they may be delivered and ascend to heaven. Let this be your thought. Resolve your hearts firmly, and hold to the Dao even unto death. This is my wish. Take heed.\"\n\nHearing these compassionate words, the disciples were all awed and inspired, competing to redouble their efforts.\n\nThe master said to the assembly: \"The Dao has no form or name—it is the origin of spirit and qi. When primordial qi descends and transforms, spirit and illumination arise naturally. Refining spirit to merge with the Dao—this is true cultivation. All other names and appearances are mere distractions, unreliable as standards. I will now set forth its great outline for you.\n\n\"The essentials of cultivation cannot depart from spirit and qi. Spirit and qi are life and destiny; life and destiny are dragon and tiger; dragon and tiger are lead and mercury; lead and mercury are water and fire; water and fire are the infant and the maiden; the infant and the maiden are true yin and true yang; true yin and true yang are none other than spirit and qi. These various names and forms must not be clung to—they are but the two words: spirit and qi.\n\n\"If you wish to nurture qi and perfect spirit, you must first sever all worldly ties, purifying inner and outer. With long and unwavering focus, spirit will congeal and qi will harmonize. After three years without leakage, the lower elixir forms; after six years without leakage, the middle elixir forms...\"\n\nAfter nine years without leakage, the upper elixir forms. This is called the perfection of the Three Elixirs, the completion of the Nine Cycles. The marrow congeals and transforms, the blood vessels become true; within, perfection is complete, and without, radiance overflows. Light and shadow shine through with clarity, still and unmoving, yet responsive to all stimuli without end. A thousand changes, ten thousand transformations—sitting in life, standing in death. The thirty-six thousand spirits leap and roam throughout the world, welcomed by the overseers of the Three Realms. Amid the Eight Difficulties, no calamity or poison can bring harm. Even in the great kalpa’s transformations, the floods surging from all four directions, when the spirit fills the Great Void, nothing can obstruct it.\n\nThus, heaven may at times collapse, earth may at times sink, mountains may at times crumble, seas may at times dry up—all that has form will ultimately perish in destruction. Only those who cultivate the Dao, reaching the state where spirit and Dao unite, endure beyond the kalpa without decay. Their merit extends to nine generations of ancestors, ascending to the Upper Clarity.\n\n*Record of the Perfected One of Cinnabar Yang, concluded.*",

One fascicle.\nSource edition: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Great Mystery Section*.\n\n**Record of the Perfected One of Danyang**\nCompiled by Wang Yizhong of Lingyin\n\nIn the third month of the *guimao* year of the Dading reign, I first paid homage to my master at the southern hermitage of Fan Mingshu of Muping. The master asked: \"From whence have you come?\" I replied: \"I come from eastern Wu. Admiring your virtue, I see that you do not regard wealth as riches, but abide in serene contentment, seated in the advancement of the Dao. Having heard of your renown, I rejoiced and wished to attend you, bearing your towel and sandals, to receive but a single word of instruction.\"\n\nThe master, pleased, said: \"It is rare for one so young to harbor the aspiration to cultivate the Dao.\" After a long pause, he added: \"When hungry, go eat. After eating, go sleep.\"\n\nOne day, seeing me stand with hands clasped in respect, the master suddenly rebuked: \"A Daoist need only be unobstructed and at ease—do not cling to appearances. This hermitage is no grand hall, nor are you an official. If you insist on mundane courtesies, then go elsewhere to socialize. As the ancients said: *‘On the three mountains, human sentiments grow faint; across the four seas, the homeless probe the depths of the Dao’*—these words were not spoken in vain.\"\n\nThe master often taught: \"Those who study the Dao must awaken on their own. Failure to do so stems from benighted confusion. To dispel such confusion, first purify the heart, attaining clarity and stillness. When the work is complete, success is self-evident—there is no need to seek confirmation from others. Thus, the skill or clumsiness of one’s practice becomes plainly apparent.\"\n\nAs the master walked along the road to eastern Mu, whether he encountered monks or Daoists—whether familiar or strangers—he would always bow first. His attendant, puzzled, asked: \"You share no prior acquaintance with them—why bow?\" The master replied: \"The Dao takes softness, weakness, humility, and deference as its foundation. Moreover, the Three Teachings share the same gate, differing only in their doors. Confucius said: *‘Even if it were to hold the whip of a groom, I would still do it.’* I have never heard that a single bow could be considered a transgression.\"\n\nThe master said: \"The Patriarch was once deeply versed in literature. After attaining the Dao, his wit became even sharper. Whether composing acrostics, dissecting characters, or crafting riddles and linked verses, he required no deliberation. He often composed poems in response to others, including those with intricate rhyme schemes. While others had already finished their verses, the Patriarch would be the last to respond, effortlessly weaving in all two hundred and sixty ‘golden joints’ of rhyme. All marveled and sighed in admiration, deeming his words those of an immortal. Who today could match this? Only Lord Fanxi comes close in style.\"",

      "translated_text": "The master said: \"When the Patriarch once traveled to Dengzhou, he wore a bamboo hat on his head and tattered robes, carrying a staff and a bronze mirror. His appearance was most peculiar and ancient. He begged in the market, yet none in Dengzhou recognized him. That night, returning to the temple, he inscribed a quatrain on the wall:\n\n*Parted from Zhongnan’s waters and bamboo village,*\n*No sons or daughters remain at home.*\n*Thousands of miles away to seek a knowing friend,*\n*To lead me through the gate of undying life.*\n\nAt dawn, he brushed his robes and set off. Several days later, the prefect Heshi Lie Miao visited the temple. Seeing the poem on the wall, he sighed in admiration and composed a response in the same rhyme:\n\n*Turning back, three years since leaving my old village,*\n*Forgotten the courtyard bamboos and growing grandchildren.*\n*Someday I’ll brush my sleeves and seek you out—*\n*Will you permit a tranquil knock at your gate?*\n\nThe master said: \"A bland diet nurtures qi; forsaking anger nurtures one’s nature. Enduring humiliation and humility nurture virtue and guard unity. Serenity and tranquility nurture the Dao. To leave one’s name unrecorded in registers and one’s heart unshackled by power and profit—this is how one sheds the mortal husk and becomes a companion of Heaven.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Wine is the brew that disorders the mind; meat is the substance that severs life. It is best to abstain entirely. While transgressions of wine and meat may yet be forgiven, to transgress in lust is a sin beyond absolution. Why? Lust is more ferocious than wolves and tigers—it ruins fine conduct, undermines good deeds, drains essence, extinguishes spirit, and may even cost one’s life. Thus it is the greatest transgression for a Daoist.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Nothing brings greater joy and ease than idleness. If a Daoist grows weary of dwelling in a hut, he may find one or two companions, sling a satchel over his shoulder, and lean on a staff, singing as he wanders. Should he encounter fine mountains or rivers, he may linger awhile—never rushing the journey.\"\n\nThe master addressed his servant: \"A student of the Dao must persevere to the end, lest he abandon the path halfway and become a laughingstock. You are, after all, a scholar—do you not know that all men must establish themselves through some endeavor? How much more so for one who pursues the Dao, for this is the greatest undertaking of a man’s life.\"\n\nThe master once inscribed a couplet in large characters for his Daoist companions:\n*\"Swiftly topple the mountain of self and other,*\n*Hastily break open the cave of dragon and tiger.\"*\n\nHis servant asked: \"I understand the mountain of self and other, but what is the cave of dragon and tiger, and where does it lie?\"\nThe master smiled: \"Heaven’s mechanism cannot be lightly disclosed. Examine it closely—will you awaken or not?\"\n\nOne day, the master summoned his servant, who arrived after some delay.\n\"Where have you been?\" the master asked.\nThe servant replied: \"I had just risen from a satisfying midday nap, my spirit clear and serene. By my bed lay a copy of the *Zhuangzi*, which I picked up and read—that is why I was not here.\"\nThe master said: \"The Dao requires the heart’s accord. If you remain bound by texts, when will you ever reach an end? As the saying goes: *Awakening to the *Nanhua* only deepens the delusion.*\"\n\nWhile in Huating, the master said: \"What is the Dao? The blackness of the navel is its root source—do you not know it is what issues from the nostrils? Have you not heard Guangchengzi’s words: *Let the cinnabar turtle and river chariot rest still; the crane’s embryo and tortoise’s breath flow on endlessly.*\"\n\nAddressing his disciples, the master said: \"Devote yourself single-mindedly to the Dao, and anyone may become an immortal. Unlike the worldly pursuit of advancement, which brings demotion and failure, the Confucians are broad but lack essentials, while the Dao is simple and easy to practice. But the highest teaching is nothing other than purity and non-action.\"\n\nThe master lived in a bare chamber, furnished only with a desk, a bed, brushes, ink, and a sheepskin—nothing more. In the morning, he took a bowl of congee; at noon, a bowl of rice. Beyond that, he tasted no other food. One day, he summoned his servant and bade him sit for a long while. The servant asked: \"Does my master’s Dao involve deliberate action?\"\nThe master replied: \"No. Though my songs often speak of dragon and tiger, infant and crone, these are but metaphors. The wonder of the Dao lies in nothing more than nurturing the blackness. People drown in profit and fame, dissipating their blackness. For the student of the Dao, there is no other task but to cultivate qi. When the heart’s fluid descends and the kidney’s qi ascends, meeting in the spleen, the primordial qi swirls and coalesces—there the elixir gathers. The liver and lungs are the pathways of this movement. Through long practice of stillness, you will come to know it yourself. Without nurturing the blackness, even if you could carry Mount Tai across the North Sea, it would not be the Dao.\" These words were spoken ten days before his transformation.\n\nHis servant and two or three companions, Cao and Liu, stood outside the chamber when the master suddenly emerged and said: \"The Dao is nothing more than purity, non-action, carefree wandering, and freedom from attachment. These twelve words—if you can chew them to pieces, you may become a thoroughgoing Daoist. Trust an old man’s words and practice them, and you will surely benefit. I will not deceive you young ones.\"\n\nWhile staying in a hut in the western outskirts of Huang County, the master recited:\n*\"Though you spend ten thousand taels of gold a day,*\n*Simple robes and plain fare are best.\"*\n\nHe said: \"Last year, passing through a frontier pass, I heard someone recite these words and admired their truth, so I remembered them. I do not know who composed them.\"\nMa Yuanzhi said: \"These words are from Abbot Shun’s *Weijiang Collection*.\"\nThe master exclaimed: \"How marvelous these words are!\"\n\nThe master said: \"Whose family tradition is this? The teachings of Zhong and Lü were transmitted directly.\" He then recited a verse:\n*\"A single spark of spirit shines through the great void,*\n*No painter’s hand, however skilled, could capture it.*\n*Do not idly compare it to the bright moon—*\n*How could the flawed and green ever resemble me?\"*\n\"This verse reveals a hint of its edge,\" he remarked.\n\nThe master said: \"Qi is difficult to master—swift as a galloping horse. Only stillness makes it manageable. You must abandon external desires. Though splendor may dazzle before your eyes, regard it as if gazing into a deep mountain valley—such is the heart of a Daoist. If you have not reached the ground of no-mind, you cannot control it. Thus the man of Dao values nothing so much as no-mind.\"",

When the heart dies, spirit lives; when yang flourishes, yin dissipates. This is the natural principle, yet the deluded do not understand. They think only of their descendants and dismiss the study of the Dao as useless—how can they not reflect more deeply?\"\n\nThe master said: \"I was over forty when I met my teacher and entered the Dao, which is why my temples are now streaked with gray. Yet within my belly, there is another strand of hair—how could this have come about? For over a decade, I longed to go to Guanzhong, nurturing only my spirit and qi.

His poem contains the lines: *'I cast off the fiery household of three thousand, / Abandoned the gate and soldiers of a million homes.'* Later, he sustained himself by begging, performing in markets, even carrying wine and combs to brothels—yet felt no shame. Some later Dao students claim, *'I come from wealth and nobility—how can you compare me to Haichan?'*\"\n\nThe master said: \"If one can discern the Dao of clarity and stillness, it is perfect in every way. Thus the scripture says: *'If a person can remain constantly clear and still, / Heaven and earth all return to them.'* By 'heaven and earth,' it does not mean the external sky above and earth below, but rather the heaven and earth within the body. The diaphragm and above is heaven; the diaphragm and below is earth. If heavenly qi descends and earthly vessels flow, with harmony between above and below, essence and qi will naturally stabilize.\" This was spoken by Master Xiaoren.\n\nThe master said: \"The subtlety of preserving qi lies in safeguarding essence, and one must be especially vigilant during sleep. When about to rest, let right mindfulness arise, all thoughts dissolve, and the body lie curled to the side.

      "translated_text": "This may be called perfection.\n\nDuring the master’s time in Laizhou, a man named Jiang Xi presented him with the *Transmission of Master Lü*. As the master read the passage on how worldly people pursue only fame and profit, unaware of the spirit within, chasing external things without return, and losing all celestial authenticity—who then is to blame?—he closed the scroll and said to Xi: \"These words truly strike the principle. Yet with no one in the world to awaken, how difficult the Dao is to practice!\"\n\nThere was a man named Han Tao, styled Qingfu, who admired the character of Tao Yuanming and Shao Yaofu, styling himself the Master of Anle Garden. When the master returned from the Guanzhong region to Muyi, he passed through Jinan and was invited to the garden, where he was served a simple meal. Afterward, Tao knelt before the master and said: \"From my youth I have admired the Dao, and now my temples are gray. Fortunate to meet you, master, I beg a single word to illuminate my ignorance.\"\n\nThe master replied: \"The Dao takes non-action as its essence, forgetting words as its function, softness and weakness as its root, and purity and stillness as its foundation. If applied to oneself, one must moderate diet, cut off thoughts, sit in stillness to regulate the breath, and rest peacefully to nurture qi. When the mind does not wander, the nature stabilizes; when the body is not wearied, essence is preserved; when the spirit is not disturbed, the elixir coalesces. Then one may extinguish passions in emptiness and pacify the spirit in the ultimate. This may be called attaining the wondrous Dao without stepping beyond the courtyard.\"\n\nHan bowed in gratitude and said: \"The great Dao is vast and formless, beyond all questioning. Now, having heard these wondrous teachings, I have found the gate and entered.\"\n\nCao and Lai, both originally Confucian scholars, had studied the Dao for many years and shared an unbroken bond with the master. They once asked in leisure: \"When you were in Guanzhong, how did you cultivate the Dao?\"\n\nCao Lai replied: \"The master wore a single unlined robe through winter and summer, ate coarse food to satisfaction, and even in the bitter cold of winter, his hut had no fire, and he sometimes drank ice-cold water. Yet his spirit and qi remained harmonious and smooth, without the slightest chill. After ten years of this, if his abdomen had not contained the Dao’s qi, he could not have endured it.\"\n\nThe master said: \"In all matters, one must prepare in advance to avoid disaster. Thus, those who cultivate the Dao must guard against passions and desires in their youth and prime, making early preparations—then immortality may be hoped for. But if one waits until gray hairs hang at the temples and vitality has declined before beginning to study the Dao, it is like seeking furs in the depths of winter—is this not too late?\"\n\nThe master said: \"The thirty-six Daoist breathing exercises and the twenty-four stages of returning the elixir are but the gradual gates to entering the Dao and cannot be practiced directly. The great Dao, if confined to the furnace and crucible, borrowing the forms of tortoise and snake, is to create trouble where none exists and add artifice to one’s nature. This is to impose greatly upon people.\"\n\nThus, the Daoist tradition has left behind countless scriptures and texts—thousands of classics and ten thousand treatises—but they may be summarized in a single word: *purity and stillness*.\n\nThe master said: \"Purity and stillness: purity is to purify the source of the heart, stillness is to still the sea of qi. When the heart’s source is pure, external things cannot disturb it, so passions settle and spirit-light arises. When the sea of qi is still, deviant desires cannot intrude, so essence is preserved and the abdomen is full. Thus, calming the heart is like settling water, and nurturing qi is like raising a child. When qi flourishes, the spirit becomes numinous; when the spirit is numinous, qi transforms—this is the result of purity and stillness. If one practices arts with intention and effort, these are finite techniques. If one practices the principle of non-action and non-intention, this is the infinite emptiness of purity.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Non-action means not thinking, not scheming. Guard against love, desire, anger, and resentment; accumulate neither profit nor harm. In this way, though one may act, one remains in non-action; though one may engage in affairs, one remains without affairs. How much more so when one focuses on purifying the heart, stilling the mind, and nurturing qi—preserving the spirit to wander in the land of carefree ease, entering the realm of nothing-whatsoever.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Liu Gaoshang lived in a humble abode for forty years, doing nothing else but emptying his heart, filling his abdomen, shedding ornament, forgetting fame, abandoning profit, purifying his spirit, preserving his qi—then the elixir coalesced of itself, and immortality was achieved.\" There was a eulogy for him that said: *\"Block the openings, close the gates.\"* I once recited these words, but now I see this man—how simple and fitting!\n\nThe master said: \"Non-mind does not mean being mindless like a cat or dog. It is to maintain the mind in the realm of purity and stillness, without deviant thoughts. Thus, the common person lacks a pure and still mind, while the Daoist lacks a mind tainted by dust and grime—not that both are equally mindless, like wood, stone, cats, or dogs.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Not arising, not ceasing—seeing the Tathāgata. When awakened, one escapes rebirth.\" Qiu Jun said: \"This is the emergence of the yin spirit. When one reaches the celestial court and suddenly sees a pair of flowers flying, then the yang spirit emerges. This is the first stage.\"\n\nThe master said:\n*\"The great Dao is far from human passions,*\n*Non-action is the wondrous root and foundation.*\n*In the world, if one loves nothing,*\n*Afflictions will not follow.\"*\n\nThe master said: \"If a cultivator’s merit and practice are not yet complete when the great limit arrives, sages and worthies will not let them die. But if one does not cultivate at all, when the great limit comes, they cannot escape it.\"\n\nThe master said: \"A single thought unbroken—rest for a lifetime.\"\n\nGong Daosheng asked: \"When in the state of profound stillness, what then?\"\n\nThe master replied: \"Bring it together with profound stillness—then even that is not needed.\"\n\nYu Qingfeng asked: \"I have cultivated for many years, yet my Dao-eye is not clear, and my mind-ground is not numinous. Why?\"\n\nThe master said: \"There is no other reason—your practice of the Dao is not refined.\"\n\nThe master said: \"All men and women, from beginningless time, have been bound by love, desire, and endless passions, never leaving the cycle of the six realms. All births—from wombs, eggs, moisture, or transformation—all forms and natures arise from love and desire. Nature arises from love, life arises from desire, and from love and desire arise fortune and misfortune, jealousy and obstruction. From this, the wheel of rebirth turns endlessly. The Dharma says: to purify the earth, first purify the heart.\"",

      "translated_text": "If the heart is pure, the wheel of rebirth naturally stills.\n\nThe master was fond of eating porridge; at noon, he would consume a single bowl, then spend the rest of the day discoursing on the Dao, tirelessly instructing and guiding his disciples. He was, in nature, a kind and virtuous gentleman. While in Laiyang, he composed verses of varying lengths, including the line: *\"After a meal of porridge, one must accomplish a full measure of practice.\"* Let scholars take heed of this. Those who merely eat, drink, and sit idly—without making the Dao their concern—may well be judged for their negligence.\n\nThe master said: \"Those who study the Dao need not widely peruse scriptures, for they only scatter the mind and hinder one’s progress in the Dao. However, reading the *River Earl’s Commentary on the Dao De Jing* or the *Jinling Master’s Commentary on the Yin Fu Jing* from time to time does no harm. Yet even this is not as good as abandoning all reading, sitting in stillness like a deaf and blind man, and nurturing the qi—this is the highest strategy.\"\n\nThe master said: \"The Daoist, in walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, must not for even a moment let the heart stray from the Dao. When walking, place your feet on level ground; when standing, fix your spirit in the vast emptiness; when sitting, regulate the breath at the tip of your nose; when sleeping, embrace the pearl below the navel. With long practice, the breath becomes harmonized without interruption, and though one may seem dull-witted all day, this is the true work—it is not mere artificial effort or forced discipline.\"\n\nThe master said: \"For those newly embarking on the Dao, from this day forward, let go of all worldly affairs and do not let them weigh on the heart. If even the slightest thread of attachment remains, the Dao will not take root. Do not dwell on the past, nor anticipate the future—simply attend to the present moment, and you become a person without cares.\"\n\nThe master also said: \"The Daoist does not resent poverty, for poverty is the foundation of nurturing life. When hungry, eat a bowl of porridge; when tired, spread a bundle of straw to sleep. Living simply from day to day—this is the livelihood of the Daoist. Thus, know that purity is something even the wealthy and noble cannot attain.\"\n\nThe master passed through Qingshe, where he was invited to a vegetarian feast. Among the guests were several ordained monks, one of whom displayed his eloquence, engaging in contentious debate without end. The master calmly replied: \"If I set aside this body, I know nothing else.\" The monk flushed with embarrassment and could no longer find words.\n\nThe master said: \"To be a Daoist, one must be a man of resolute character—never wavering or indecisive. Keep in mind that the matter of life and destiny is of utmost importance; practice with unwavering determination, and resolve to succeed. Those who are overly sentimental or lack the will to embrace the Dao are not true seekers of the Way.\"\n\nThe master said: \"The darkness within the body must not be dispersed; the spirit within the heart must not be obscured.\" Someone asked: \"How can one prevent the qi from scattering?\" The master replied: \"By keeping the body in non-action.\" Another asked: \"How can one prevent the spirit from being obscured?\" The master replied: \"By keeping the heart free of affairs.\" Yet another asked: \"If body and heart are thus, may one then dwell in a hermitage?\" The master said: \"If you can settle everything, then it is good to rest.\"\n\nThe master said: \"The Daoist’s heart and nature must not be entangled in worldly matters. Yet to wander with a flowering staff, composing verses in the wind and moonlight, and refining one’s temperament—what harm is there in that? As for begging from door to door, pushing and shoving—this is simply the daily practice of the Daoist.\"\n\nThe master said: \"When you first entered seclusion, you begged for a meal and ate when you received one. Now, your merit and conduct have diminished—you choose where to stay and what to eat. If you proceed thus, you will never attain the Dao but will instead be forced to repay your debts.\"\n\nThe master said: \"When I first went begging in Guanzhong, I came to a wineshop where a drunkard insulted and cursed me. Later, he struck me with his fist, and I fled. When he caught hold of me, he struck me again, and I could only endure it. Have any of you encountered such demonic obstacles?\" The disciples answered: \"No.\" The master said: \"If you do, bear it well and do not contend.\"\n\nThe master said: \"The ancestral masters taught that one must not wear fine clothes, nor eat fine food, nor sing or carouse—only ensure that nothing clings to the heart.\"\n\nThe master said: \"In my secular days, I weighed meat and measured wine, but I have now abstained from them for over a decade. Even if one eats meat and drinks wine, one may still become an immortal—though the process will be slower. But if the heart does not hold to the Dao, and one indulges in wine and meat, merely gratifying the palate, the retribution will be inescapable, and one will ultimately become a lowly ghost.\"\n\nThe master said: \"The ancestral masters guided four disciples—Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma—observing how Ren Fengzi acted with virtue. The masters said: 'When one merely hears of such things, it pierces the ears; but upon seeing them, one clutches the treasure and dares not let go.' Master Liu also spoke of this.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Once, while in seclusion, I idly remarked on fresh melons. The next day, the assembly made melon-stuffed buns, and I ate three of them—thus, I was punished with three days of fasting.\"\n\nThe master said: \"The ancestral master once sent a disciple to Ninghai to beg for a little money and rice for my use. The disciple said: 'After the other brothers go, how will it be? I vow never to return to my hometown.' The master grew angry and beat him until dawn, striking him countless times. I felt the urge to retreat, but my senior brother Qiu dissuaded me, and to this day, I dare not forget his kindness.\"\n\nThe master said: \"When I was in my hometown, the ancestral master ordered me to beg in Laizhou. After several days, I hesitated. That night, I dreamed the master said: 'Tomorrow, stretch out your hand like a true man and beg boldly in the streets.' My deluded thoughts had obstructed me, so the master spoke thus.\"\n\nThe master said: \"When I returned to my hometown and first went out into the streets, the ancestral master gathered all the young boys, daubed their faces with rouge, and powdered them. I thought to myself: 'I fear encountering my children or acquaintances, but even more, I fear meeting my in-laws.' Each time I thought of stopping at Fan Mingshu’s house to rest, I would see my father-in-law already there, saying, 'This time, you need not feel ashamed.'\"",

If you have maintained purity for seven days and still speak of blessings—how much greater is the fortune of Ma Feng’s disciples, who uphold purity throughout their lives, forsaking desires and abstaining from meat and wine!\"\n\nThe assembly all bowed in reverence and sighed: \"The teachings of purity are truly inconceivable.\" From then on, the people of the three prefectures, household by household, received the teachings. Gradually spreading to the ten directions, those who heard the wind of it turned toward faith, and the great teaching flourished anew, beginning with the master.\n\nThe master asked his disciples: \"How many hours are there in a day?\"\n\nThe disciples replied: \"Six hours in a day.\"\n\nThe master said: \"How many hours are there in a day and night?\"\n\nThe disciples said: \"Twelve hours in a day and night.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Within these twelve hours of day and night, the Way of Heaven moves, revolving and transforming creation—is there even a moment’s pause?\"\n\nThe disciples replied: \"There is no pause.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Those who study the Dao must emulate the Way of Heaven, revolving and transforming the creation within themselves. In all twelve hours, they must remain ever pure and ever still, not allowing even a speck of dust to arise in their thoughts. Only then is this cultivation. Progressing day by day, month by month, without interruption, one may then become an immortal. If one slackens in effort or strays from conduct, how can one attain liberation? I observe you all—within these twelve hours, not one of you has ever devoted a single hour wholeheartedly to the Dao. Yet you accept the offerings of patrons from the ten directions—how will you repay them? When you close your eyes one day, you will return to the wheel of rebirth. When will you ever escape it?\n\n\"I now urge you: still your minds and dispel desires, untouched by the myriad entanglements. When spirit and qi harmonize and merge, this is the Dao. Cultivate thus, and you will not err. If you procrastinate and grow lax, failing to uphold the practice, the fault is not mine.\n\n\"Do you not consider your seven generations of ancestors, who in life committed manifold evil deeds and now suffer torments in the dark realms? They long for their descendants to attain the Dao, that they may be delivered and ascend to heaven. Let this be your thought. Resolve your hearts firmly, and hold to the Dao even unto death. This is my wish. Take heed.\"\n\nHearing these compassionate words, the disciples were all awed and inspired, competing to redouble their efforts.\n\nThe master said to the assembly: \"The Dao has no form or name—it is the origin of spirit and qi.
