  "full_translation": "**Title:**\n*Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s *Yinfu Jing* (黃帝《陰符經》注)*\n\n**Author & Textual Notes:**\nA work by the eminent scholar **Yu Yan (俞琰)** of the late Southern Song dynasty.\nComposed posthumously in the **8th year of Zhizheng (至正八年, 1348)**.\nOne scroll.\nSource text: *Zhengtong Daozang* (正統道藏), *Dongzhen* (洞真) section, *Yujue* (玉诀) category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s *Yinfu Jing***\n\nMaster **Su Weitan (蘇為淛)**, a scholar of the Right Commandery, was a paragon of virtue among the literati—his excellence rivaled that of **Shiguan Gong (石涧翁)**. Such men are rare today.\n\nGong devoted his life to studying the *Yijing* (易), gaining profound insights. Thus, he upheld tranquility without ostentation and lived to a venerable age. His elucidations of this text reveal truths beyond what **Zhu Xi (朱夫子)** had fully articulated. Were Zhu Xi to rise again, he would surely affirm this work as unassailable.\n\nMoreover, his disciples—**Ziyu (子玉)** in upholding his legacy and **Sun Zhen (孙桢)** in diligent study—demonstrate that Heaven’s rewards are boundless and unceasing.\n\nZiyu presented this work to me, requesting a preface. How dare I presume? Yet after days of reading and reflection, my admiration deepened. I thus pen these words in gratitude—not merely as an old friend, but as a testament to our shared bond.\n\nAlas, my words are those of an aged man—can they truly inspire trust? Can they truly inspire trust?\n\nWritten on the **15th day of the 10th month, Zhizheng 8th year (1348)**, by **Shi Yu (師余)** of **Meishan (眉山)**.\n\n---\n**Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s *Yinfu Jing***\nBy **Linwu Shanren Yu Yan (林屋山人俞琰)**, also known as **Yu Wurou (玉吾叟)**.\n\nTo observe the **Dao/Way of Heaven**, to grasp its operations—this is complete.\n\nThat which unfolds **naturally and effortlessly** is the **Dao/Way of Heaven**.\nThat which **revolves left and right without ceasing**, day and night, is Heaven’s operation.\n*The Doctrine of the Mean* states: **\"Sincerity is the **Dao/Way of Heaven**.\"**\nIt further says: **\"Supreme sincerity knows no exhaustion.\"**\nSincerity is **true and unerring**, pure in its alignment with the natural principles of Heaven.\n**\"No exhaustion\"** means that even in the briefest instant, there is **qi/nourishment**—\nits existence is continuous, never interrupted for a moment.\n\nIf a person can **observe the **Dao/Way of Heaven** and cultivate sincerity within,\ngrasp Heaven’s operations and **strive unceasingly**—\nthen they walk as a companion of Heaven.\n\n**\"Complete\"** refers to the eight characters **\"observe Heaven’s **Dao/Way**, grasp its operations\"**—\nconcise in expression, exhaustive in meaning, with nothing further to add.\n\nHeaven has **five calamities**, and those who perceive them thrive.\nThe **five calamities** reside in the heart and manifest in Heaven.\nThe **five calamities** are the **Five Phases**.\n\nZhu Ziyou said:\n*\"The virtues and vices of the world arise from these five—*\n*thus, reversing their names, we call them **five calamities**.\"*\n\nI say that Heaven’s **Five Phases** are **water, fire, wood, metal, earth**;\nwhile humanity’s **Five Phases** are **vision, hearing, speech, demeanor, thought**.\nHeaven’s **Five Phases** are visible in Heaven—\nbut can humanity’s **Five Phases** be seen within the heart?\n\nIf a person can perceive what is easily seen\nand also what is difficult to see,\nthen there is nothing they cannot perceive.\nThus it is said: **\"Those who perceive them thrive.\"**\n\nHow does it reside in the heart?\n**Vision** must be **clear**, **hearing** must be **acute**,\n**speech** must be **faithful**, **demeanor** must be **respectful**,\nand the heart’s function is **thought**.\n\nHow does it manifest in Heaven?\n**Wind, rain, sunshine, cold, and heat**—these are its expressions.\nThe universe lies within the hands;\nten thousand transformations arise from the body.\n\nIf a person can **activate their innate mechanism** to override Heaven and Earth’s operations,\nthen the creative forces of Heaven and Earth rest within them.\nThus it is said: **\"The universe lies within the hands;**\n**ten thousand transformations arise from the body.\"**\n\nShao Yong’s *\"Observing the *Yijing* in Verse\"* states:\n*\"One thing’s origin stems from one body,*\n*One body returns to encompass Heaven and Earth.*\n*Know that all things are complete within me—*\n*Why set apart the Three Realms as roots?*\n*Heaven divides creation from the One—*\n*Man weaves fate from the heart.*\n*Heaven and man—how could they differ in essence?*\n*The **Dao/Way** acts not in vain, for it lies in humanity.\"*\n\nThis is the meaning.\n\n**Heaven’s nature** is **humanity**.\n**Humanity’s heart** is the **mechanism**.\n\nHumans are born in stillness—this is **Heaven’s nature**.\nThus it is said: **\"Heaven’s nature is humanity.\"**\nThe **mechanism** stirs within—this is **humanity’s heart**.\nThus it is said: **\"Humanity’s heart is the mechanism.\"**\n\nTo **establish the **Dao/Way of Heaven** is to stabilize humanity**.\nIf a person can **uphold sincerity** and not be swayed by desires,\nthen **Heaven is steadfast** and **humanity is steadfast**.\nThus it is said: **\"To establish the **Dao/Way of Heaven** is to stabilize humanity.\"**\n\nWhen **Heaven’s killing mechanism** is unleashed, **dragons and serpents** rise from the land.\nWhen **Earth’s killing mechanism** is unleashed, **stars and constellations** fall into obscurity.\nWhen **humanity’s killing mechanism** is unleashed, **Heaven and Earth reverse**.\n\nWhen **Heaven’s killing mechanism** is unleashed from above,\n**dragons and serpents** respond and rise from the land;\nwhen **Earth’s killing mechanism** is unleashed from below,\n**stars and constellations** respond and fall into obscurity;\nwhen **humanity’s killing mechanism** is unleashed from within,\nthen **above and below** respond, and **Heaven and Earth reverse**.\n\nStrategists who understand this principle\ncompare it to the **Hengshan serpent**—\nstrike its head and its tail responds,\nstrike its tail and its head responds,\nstrike its center and both head and tail respond.\n\nPractitioners who understand this principle\ntake the **head as Heaven**, the **torso as Earth**, and the **heart as humanity**,\ntheir method being to **conceal the spirit within**,\nregulating the **inhalation and exhalation**—\nascending to the **Mingmen (命门)** at the base,\ndescending to the **Dantian (丹田)** above—\ncausing the **Five Phases** to invert and circulate within,\ndescending so that **metal and water** merge with **earth**,\nascending so that **wood and fire** pair with **earth**,\nendlessly rising and falling without end—\nthis is the **reversal of Heaven and Earth within the body**.\n\nThough the two schools speak differently in intent,\ntheir principles converge in harmony.\n\nFor the **benevolent**, this is **benevolence**;\nfor the **wise**, this is **wisdom**—\nyet their essence is one.\n\nOtherwise, why would this text be called the *Yinfu Jing*?\n\nI observe *The Laozi* and find:\n*\"The **spirit of the valley** does not die—\nthis is called the **mysterious female**;\nThe **gate of the mysterious female**—\nthis is called the **root of Heaven and Earth**.*\n*Endlessly present, yet used without exhaustion.\"*\nThis speaks of **cultivation**.\n\nIt further says:\n*\"To govern a great state is like poaching a small fish.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Fine weapons are ominous instruments.\"*\nIndeed, these also encompass **governance**,\nnot solely the **art of cultivation**.\n\nWorks such as *The Zihua Zi*, *The Guan Yin Zi*, *The Wenzzi*, *The Liezi*, and *The Zhuangzi*\nare likewise so.\n\nSome cling to one aspect and speak only of that—\nthis is erroneous.\n\nZhan Gu’s commentary on this text\ntakes **coercive techniques of seduction and warfare** as **strength in battle and victory**—\nthis is the greatest error of all.\n\nWhen **Heaven and humanity’s mechanisms** align,\nthe foundation of **ten thousand transformations** is set.\n\nThe **mechanism of Heaven** and the **mechanism of the human heart** resonate—\nwhen they move, they harmonize in response—\nthis is **Heaven and humanity’s unified activation**.\n\nThe **mechanism of Heaven and humanity’s unified activation**—\nwho but the **enlightened** can comprehend it?\n\nTo know this **mechanism** yet act without recklessness\nis to establish the **root of ten thousand transformations**.\nThus it is said: **\"When Heaven and humanity’s mechanisms align,**\n**the foundation of ten thousand transformations is set.\"**\n\nPractitioners who grasp this **unified mechanism**\nthus, in the stillness of night,\n**concentrate their spirit and gather their qi** in the **Dantian** for a moment—\nwhen **spirit enters qi** and **qi merges with spirit**,\nthey remain **motionless and tranquil**.\nBy the end of **Hai (亥)** and the start of **Zi (子)**,\nwhen **Heaven and Earth’s qi** arrives, they **urgently gather it**;\nwhen it has not yet arrived, they **remain empty and await it**,\ndaring not to act prematurely.\n\n**Nature** has **aptitude and clumsiness**—it can be **concealed**.\nHumans have **wisdom and folly**—\nthus their **nature** varies in aptitude and clumsiness.\n\n「If the **Great Knowing** is like **Great Folly**,\nand **Great Skill** is like **Great Clumsiness**,\nthen their **nature** is concealed within\nand not perceived by others.\n\nThus it is said: **\"Nature** has **aptitude and clumsiness**—\nit can be **concealed**.\"\n\nThe **evil of the nine orifices** lies in the **three essentials**—\nthey can be controlled through **action and stillness**.\n**Evil** is what **human desire** is.\n\nWhen **human desire** burns fiercely,\n**Heaven’s principle** is extinguished—\nthis is why the **noble one** restrains their **evil**.\n\nThe **orifices** are nine, yet the **essentials** are three—\nthe ears, eyes, and mouth.\n\nWhen the **noble one acts**, they do not gaze\nunless it is **proper ritual**,\nthey do not listen unless it is **proper ritual**,\nthey do not speak unless it is **proper ritual**—\n**action** is thus **sincere**.\n\nWhen they are **still**, they neither gaze nor listen,\nbut **carefully restrain** their **joyousness (yui)**—\n**stillness** is thus **sincere**.\n\nThe **noble one**, whether in **action** or **stillness**,\nis **sincere** in both—\n**sincere** in **action**, **sincere** in **stillness**,\nand with **sincerity** in all things,\nthey can go nowhere without success.\n\nThus it is said: **\"The evil of the nine orifices**\nlies in the **three essentials**—\nthey can be controlled through **action and stillness**.\"\n\nFire **arises from wood**—\nwhen **disaster** is about to strike, it **must be subdued**.\n**Deceit** **arises from the state**—\nwhen **turmoil** is about to emerge, it **must be broken**.\n\nTo **know** and **cultivate** this **Dao/Way**,\nis to be called a **sage**.\n\nFire **arises within wood**—\nwhen fire **flares**, wood **is consumed by it**.\nThus it is said: **\"Fire arises from wood**—\n**disaster** is about to strike, it **must be subdued**.\"\n\n**Deceit** **arises within the state**—\nwhen **deceit** **stirs**, the state **is shattered**.\nThus it is said: **\"Deceit arises from the state**—\nwhen **turmoil** is about to emerge, it **must be broken**.\"\n\nThe **method of cultivation** is this:\n**Hide the heart** in the **depths (yuan)**,\n**nurture its luminous roots**—\nwhen **still**, fire **poses no threat of upward flames**,\njust as wood, though harboring fire,\n**is not consumed by it**.\n\n**Restrain its evil** while **preserving its sincerity**,\nand it is like a state, though harboring **deceit**,\n**not being shattered by it**.\n\nThus it is said: To **know** and **cultivate** this **Dao/Way**,\nis to be called a **sage**.\n\n**Heaven’s creation and killing** are the **principles of the Dao/Way**.\nThere is the **emergence of spring rain**,\nand there is the **stern killing of autumn frost**—\nthis is the **natural course of Heaven’s Dao/Way**,\nthe **inevitable operation of principle**.\n\n**Heaven and Earth** are the **thieves of ten thousand things**;\n**ten thousand things** are the **thieves of humanity**;\n**humanity** is the **thief of ten thousand things**.\n\nWhen the **three thieves** are **properly managed**,\nand the **Three Powers (Heaven, Earth, humanity)** are **settled in harmony**,\nthen **Heaven and Earth** stand firm,\nand **ten thousand things** flourish.\n\nThus it is said: **\"Heaven and Earth** are the **thieves of ten thousand things**;\n**ten thousand things** are the **thieves of humanity**;\n**humanity** is the **thief of ten thousand things**.\"\n\nThough it speaks not of **nurturing** but of **harming**,\nit is but the **inverse** of the same.\n\nIf each of the **three** attains its **proper place**,\nthen **Heaven and Earth** take their **positions**,\nand **ten thousand things** are **nourished**—\nthus it is said: **\"The three thieves are properly managed,\nthe Three Powers are settled in harmony.\"**\n\nThus it is said: **\"To eat the **timing** of Heaven and Earth,**\n**the hundred bones** are **regulated**.\nTo **stir the **mechanism** of humanity,\n**the ten thousand transformations** are **settled**.\n**Timing** refers to **Heaven and Earth’s timing**.\n\nIf I can **eat the timing** of Heaven and Earth,\nand **align with them**,\nthen **the hundred bones** are **regulated**.\n\n**Mechanism** refers to **the human heart’s mechanism**.\nIf I can **stir the mechanism** of humanity,\nand **align with Heaven and Earth**,\nthen the **ten thousand transformations** of my body are **settled**.\n\nHumans know the **manifest spirit** of their **spirit**,\nbut do not know the **principle of the unmanifest spirit**—\nhow it **becomes spirit**.\n\n**Spirit** is the **unfathomable interplay of yin and yang**.\nIt **penetrates ten thousand things** and **gives voice** to them—\nnot the **supernatural marvels** of the vulgar world.\n\nThe **foolish** are **confused by principle**,\nand **bewildered by tales of supernatural marvels**,\nthus they call it **spirit**.\n\nYet the **movement of the sun and moon**,\nthe **shift of the four seasons**,\nthe **changes of ten thousand things**—\nthese, through **habituation**, become **commonplace**,\nand thus are called **unmanifest spirit**.\n\nWho truly knows\nhow the **unmanifest spirit** **becomes spirit**?\n\nThe **foolish** have heard from **recluses** that:\n**Heaven** is **vast and empty**, yet its **form resembles a chicken’s egg**,\nwhile **Earth** is **encased within Heaven**,\nlike the **yolk** within a chicken’s egg.\n\nThe **upper and lower, four directions** of **Earth**—\nall are **empty**, and the **void within the void** is **Heaven**.\n\n**Earth** **suspends** in the **void**,\nenduring eternally without **falling**,\nbecause **Heaven** **operates externally**,\n**revolving day and night** without **ceasing for a moment**.\n\n**Heaven** **tilts northward and southward**,\nthus the **North Pole** **rises above Earth** by **thirty-six degrees**,\nwhile the **South Pole** **descends below Earth** by **thirty-six degrees**.\n\nThe **Yellow Path (Dao/Way)** **encircles Heaven’s core**,\nand the **sun and moon** **traverse the void**,\nnever **departing the Yellow Path** during **day and night**.\n\nThe *Book of the Sui Dynasty* claims: **\"The sun enters the water.\"**\nThis is **false**.\nWater **originates from Earth**,\nand its **movement** does not **depart from Earth**.\n\nEarth’s **four boundaries** are all **Heaven**—\nhow could there be water?\nTo say water **floats upon Heaven** and **loads Earth** is even more **false**.\n\nOn the **Winter Solstice**,\nwhen the **day** is near the **South Pole**,\nthe **sun** **travels in Heaven’s southern region**,\nand **yang qi** is **far from humanity**,\nthus **cold nights** **retreat into Earth’s void** below,\nwhile **yang qi** **remains beneath humanity’s feet**—\nthis is why **wells and springs** are **warm**.\n\nOn the **Summer Solstice**,\nwhen the **day** is near the **North Pole**,\nthe **sun** **travels directly above humanity’s head**,\nand **yang qi** **straight down**—\nthus **hot nights** **retreat into Earth’s void** beyond the **northern expanse**,\nwhile **yang qi** is **not in Earth’s depths**—\nthis is why **wells and springs** are **cold**.\n\n**Ten thousand things** **spring forth and grow**,\n**summer-long and winter-hide**,\nby the **yang qi** from the **solar yin** beneath Earth,\n**steaming upward** from below.\n\nThey **autumn-harvest and winter-conceal**,\nby the **yang qi** **gradually withdrawing** from Earth’s depths.\n\nThis **principle** is **clear**, yet the **bewildered** do not know it.\n\nEven **birds, beasts, insects, and fish**—\nthose **born from the womb**, those **born from eggs**,\nthose **born from dampness**, those **born from transformation**—\nand **grasses and trees** **blooming and bearing fruit**,\nwhite as white, red as red,\nlarge as large, small as small—\nall **common folk** see their **manifestation (ran)**,\nyet none know their **principle of manifestation**.\n\nThus it is said: **\"Humans know the **manifest spirit** of their **spirit**,\nbut do not know the **principle of the unmanifest spirit**—\nhow it **becomes spirit**.\"**\n\nThe **sun and moon** have **fixed numbers**,\nand **great and small** have **determined measures**.\nFrom this **sage’s function** **emerges**,\nand **spiritual luminosity** **arises**.\n\nThe **sun and moon**—are they not **spirit**?\nTheir **movement and revolution**,\none **cold**, one **hot**—\nwhen **cold departs**, **heat arrives**,\nand when **heat departs**, **cold returns**—\nthis too is **spirit**.\n\nWho else but the **sage** could **illuminate** it?\nTo **know** and **illuminate** **spirit**—\nits **function** is **indeed that of the sage**.**\n\nThe sun advances one degree each day,\nand in one cycle traverses **365¼ degrees** to complete the heavens.\nThe moon advances **thirteen degrees and a fraction** each day,\nand in twenty-eight days completes the heavens—\nyet it requires **two additional days** to align with the sun and form a new moon.\nIn twenty-seven days, it completes the heavens—\nyet it requires **three additional days** to align with the sun and form a new moon.\nThus it is said: **\"The sun and moon have fixed numbers,\nand great and small have determined measures.\"**\n\nThe sage considered that the common people did not know\nthe fixed numbers of the sun and moon,\nand that their **spring plowing and autumn harvests** would lose their proper timing.\nThus he established the calendar and clarified the seasons,\nusing **intercalary months** to regulate the four seasons and complete the year.\n**Every three years**, one intercalary month is added;\n**every five years**, two are added;\n**every nineteen years**, seven are added—\nthis constitutes a **chapter**,\nand thus the new moon always falls on the same day.\nIts numbers are fixed and cannot be altered.\n\nThe sage **assisted the nurturing transformations** of Heaven and Earth,\nand his achievements were such that the common people all came to know\nthe **spirit of the sun and moon**,\nand its principles became clearly manifest.\nThus it is said: **\"The sage’s function emerges,\nand spiritual luminosity arises.\"**\n\nAs for **stealing the mechanism**—\nnone under Heaven can see it,\nnone can know it.\nThe **noble one** who attains it **fortifies his essence**,\nwhile the petty one who attains it **recklessly endangers his life**.\nBefore the mechanism is triggered, it is hidden and does not reveal itself—\nwho can see it?\nWho can know it?\nThus it is called **\"stealing the mechanism.\"**\n\nThis mechanism—\nwhen the noble one attains it, he **fortifies his essence**,\nfor the noble one **knows the Mandate** and does not act recklessly;\nwhen the petty one attains it, he **recklessly endangers his life**,\nfor the petty one **does not know the Mandate** and acts recklessly.\n\nThe blind excel in hearing,\nthe deaf excel in sight.\nCutting off one source of profit,\none’s effectiveness is **tenfold** that of a teacher;\n**threefold reversals** of day and night,\none’s effectiveness is **ten thousandfold** that of a teacher.\nThe blind have no sight, yet their ears are keen;\nthe deaf hear nothing, yet their eyes are sharp—\none focus, undivided.\nThose who study the **Dao**,\nif they can **sever private desires for profit** and apply their will without division,\ntheir effectiveness will be **tenfold** that of the masses.\nPeople merely fail to reflect upon themselves.\n\nIf one can **diligently guard the three essentials**—\n**ears, eyes, and mouth**—\nand maintain sincerity day and night,\ntheir effectiveness will be **ten thousandfold** that of the masses.\n\nThe **heart** arises from things,\ndies from things—\nits mechanism lies in the **eyes**.\nThe heart moves in response to things—this is to **arise from things**;\nto chase after things and forget to return—this is to **die from things**.\nThe heart is the **dwelling of spirit**,\nthe eyes are the **windows of spirit**.\nWhere the eyes go, the heart follows—\nits mechanism indeed lies in the eyes.\n\nHeaven’s **greatest benevolence** arises from its **seeming lack of benevolence**.\nSwift thunder and violent winds—\nall creatures tremble in response.\nHeaven, in its dealings with things,\nlets them follow their natural course—\nthough one might say it has no benevolence.\nYet when it **strikes with thunder and lightning**,\nand **nourishes with wind and rain**,\nall living things beneath Heaven tremble and respond—\nis this not **great benevolence** arising from what seems like none?\n\n**Supreme joy** leaves **nature in excess**,\n**supreme stillness** brings **clarity**.\nThe wise find joy—\njoy brings **knowing the Mandate** and **no cause for worry**,\nso their nature is in **abundance**, unconstrained;\nthe virtuous are still—\nstillness brings **calmness** and **no desires**,\nso their nature is **pure and ungreedy**.\n\nHeaven’s **ultimate particularity** becomes **ultimate universality**.\nHeaven’s **Way** is utterly universal and without particularity.\nPeople see only one thing’s birth, one thing’s growth,\nand assume Heaven’s **ultimate particularity**,\nwithout considering the sun and moon’s illumination,\nthe rain and dew’s reach.\nAll flying, swimming, moving, and rooted beings\neach maintain their **nature and life** while harmonizing with the **Great Unity**—\nthis is Heaven’s **ultimate universality**.\nHow could Heaven ever **partially favor** one thing?\n\nThe **regulation of birds** lies in **qi**.\nIn spring, the **oriole sings**—who makes it sing?\nIn autumn, the **wild geese arrive**—who makes them come?\nThe regulation of birds lies in **qi**.\n\n**Life** is the **root of death**;\n**death** is the **root of life**.\n**Benevolence** arises from **harm**,\n**harm** arises from **benevolence**.\n**Life** refers to the movement of all things—\nwhen movement reaches its extreme, it returns to stillness,\nthus **life is the root of death**.\n**Death** refers to the stillness of all things—\nwhen stillness reaches its extreme, it returns to movement,\nthus **death is the root of life**.\n**Benevolence** refers to Heaven’s **nourishing of things**,\n**harm** refers to Heaven’s **destroying of things**.\nThere is **autumn and winter’s storage and concealment**,\nthen **spring and summer’s flourishing and growth**;\nthere is **spring and summer’s spreading and prosperity**,\nthen **autumn and winter’s withering and fall**.\nThus it is said: **\"Benevolence arises from harm,\nharm arises from benevolence.\"**\n\nThe foolish take Heaven and Earth’s **patterns and principles** as **sagely**,\nI take **seasonal things’ patterns and principles** as **wise**.\nThe foolish consider Heaven and Earth’s **patterns and principles** as **sagely**—\nif sagely, they cannot be fully measured.\nSince they cannot be measured, they do not exhaust their principles.\nThough they call it sagely, they do not know **how** it is sagely.\n\nI consider **seasonal things’ patterns and principles** as **wise**—\nif wise, they can be known.\nThe knowing exhaust their principles to attain knowledge—\nthen even if Heaven and Earth are sagely,\nI too can measure them—\nhow much more so for seasonal things?\nThe **patterns and principles of seasonal things**\nare the **patterns and principles of Heaven and Earth**.\nTo not know Heaven’s **patterns** is to observe only Heaven’s **timely suitability**,\nto not know Earth’s **principles** is to perceive only Earth’s **material tendencies**—\nwhy seek them in the distant and lofty?\n\nThe concluding passage, over a hundred characters long,\nsome take as **commentary**, others as **main text**,\nsuch as: *\"The **Way of Heaven and Earth** is gradual,\nthus **yin and yang** prevail in turn.\"*\nMeaning: In the space between Heaven and Earth,\nwhen **yang is strong**, it **overcomes yin**,\nwhen **yin is strong**, it **overcomes yang**—\nlike water **gradually permeating** things.\nThough Zhu Wuzhi took it as commentary and did not explain it,\nwhen answering his disciples’ questions, he deeply adopted its meaning—\nthus I include it as well.\n\n**Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Symbol Classic***",

      "original_text": "观天之道，执天之行，尽矣。 自然而然者，天之道也。 左旋右转而昼夜弗停者，天之行也。 《中庸》云：诚者，天之道。 又云：至诚无息，诚则真实无妄而纯乎天理之自然也，无息则瞬有养息，有存而须臾不间断也。 人能观天之道而存其诚，执天之行而自强不息，则与天为徒矣。 尽矣云者，观天之道，执天之行八字言简意尽，而无以加也。 天有五贼，见之者昌。 五贼在心，施行於天。 五贼，五行也。 朱紫阳曰：天下之善由此五者而生，恶亦由此五者而有，故即其反而言之曰五贼。 愚谓天之五行，水、火、木、金、土是也； 人之五行，视、听、言、貌、思是也。 天之五行在天，可得而见； 人之五行在心，可得而见乎？ 人能见其所易见，又能见其所难见，则无所不见矣。 故曰：见之者昌。 何以谓之在心？ 视思明，听思聪，言思忠，貌思恭，而心之官则思也。 何以谓之？ 施行於天，风、雨、旸、寒、燠是也。 宇宙在乎手，万化生乎身。 人能动其机以夺天地之机，则天地之造化在我矣。 故曰：宇宙在乎手，万化生乎身。 邵康节《观易吟》云：一物其来有一身，一身还有一乾坤。 能知万物备於我，肯把三才别立根。 天向一中分造化，人从心上起经纶。 天人安有两般义，道不虚行即在人。 此之谓也。 天性，人也。 人心，机也。 人生而静，天之性也。 故曰：天性，人也。 机动於中，人之心也。 故曰：人心，机也。 立天之道，以定人也。 人能立其诚而不为人欲之所移，则天者定而人亦定矣。 故曰：立天之道，以定人也。 天发杀机，龙蛇起陆。 地发杀机，星辰陨伏。 人发杀机，天地反覆。 天发杀机於上，则龙蛇应之而起陆； 地发杀机於下，则星辰应之而陨伏； 人发杀机於中，则上下皆应之而天地反覆。 权谋知术之士知此理，则譬以恒山之蛇，击其首则尾应，击其尾则首应，击其中则首尾俱应； 修炼之士知此理，则以首为天，腹为地，心为人，其法潜神於内，驭呼吸之往来，上至泥九，下至命门，使五行颠倒运於其中，降则金水合处而与土俱降，升则木火为侣而与土俱升，上下往来，无穷无已，是为吾身之天地反覆。 二家之说，虽各言其志，理则暗合。 盖仁者见之谓之仁，知者见之谓之知，而其理一也。 不然，此书何以谓之《阴符》？ 愚观《老子》之书云：谷神不死，是谓玄牝； 玄牝之门，是谓天地根。 绵绵若存，用之不勤。 此言修炼也。 又云：治大国若烹小鲜。 又云：佳兵者，不祥之器。 盖亦兼言治道，不专言修炼之一端也。 如《子华子》、《关尹子》、《文子》、《列子》、《庄子》皆然。 或者执於一偏而专言其一，谬矣。 詹谷注此经，乃以御女采战之秽术为强兵战胜，则又谬之甚焉者也。 天人合发，万化定基。 天之机与人心之机相应，其动也，彼此相符，是为天人合发。 天人合发之机，非知道者孰能知之？ 知其机而不妄动，则万化之本定矣。 故曰：天人合发，万化定基。 修炼者知此天人合发之机，遂於中夜静坐，凝神聚气於丹田片饷之间，神入气中，气与神合，则寂然不动，逮夫亥之末、子之初，天地之气至则急采之，未至则虚以待之，不敢为之先也。 性有巧拙，可以伏藏。 人有知有愚，故其性巧拙不同。",

operations and **strive unceasingly**—\nthen they walk as a companion of Heaven.\n\n**\"Complete\"** refers to the eight characters **\"observe Heaven’s **Dao/Way**, grasp its operations\"**—\nconcise

Heaven.\nThe **five calamities** are the **Five Phases**.\n\nZhu Ziyou said:\n*\"The virtues and vices of the world arise from these five—*\n*thus, reversing their names, we call them **five calamities**.\"*\n\nI say that Heaven’s **Five Phases** are **water, fire, wood, metal, earth**;\nwhile humanity’s **Five Phases** are **vision, hearing, speech, demeanor, thought**.\nHeaven’s **Five Phases** are visible in Heaven—\nbut can humanity’s **Five Phases** be seen within the heart?\n\nIf a person can perceive what is easily seen\nand also what is difficult to see,\nthen there is nothing they cannot perceive.\nThus it is said: **\"Those who perceive them thrive.\"**\n\nHow does it reside in the heart?\n**Vision** must be **clear**, **hearing** must be **acute**,\n**speech** must be **faithful**, **demeanor** must be **respectful**,\nand the heart’s function is **thought**.\n\nHow does it manifest in Heaven?\n**Wind, rain, sunshine, cold, and heat**—these are its expressions.\nThe universe lies within the hands;\nten thousand transformations arise from the body.\n\nIf a person can **activate their innate mechanism** to override Heaven and Earth’s operations,\nthen the creative forces of Heaven and Earth rest within them.\nThus it is said: **\"The universe lies within the hands;**\n**ten thousand transformations arise from the body.\"**\n\nShao Yong’s *\"Observing the *Yijing* in Verse\"* states:\n*\"One thing’s origin stems from one body,*\n*One body returns to encompass Heaven and Earth.*\n*Know that all things are complete within me—*\n*Why set apart the Three Realms as roots?*\n*Heaven divides creation from the One—*\n*Man weaves fate from the heart.*\n*Heaven and man—how could they differ in essence?*\n*The **Dao/Way** acts not in vain, for it lies in humanity.\"*\n\nThis is the meaning.\n\n**Heaven’s nature** is **humanity**.\n**Humanity’s heart** is the **mechanism**.\n\nHumans are born in stillness—this is **Heaven’s nature**.\nThus it is said: **\"Heaven’s nature is humanity.\"**\nThe **mechanism** stirs within—this is **humanity’s heart**.\nThus it is said: **\"Humanity’s heart is the mechanism.\"**\n\nTo **establish the **Dao/Way of Heaven** is to stabilize humanity**.\nIf a person can **uphold sincerity** and not be swayed by desires,\nthen **Heaven is steadfast** and **humanity is steadfast**.\nThus it is said: **\"To establish the **Dao/Way of Heaven** is to stabilize humanity.\"**\n\nWhen **Heaven’s killing mechanism** is unleashed, **dragons and serpents** rise from the land.\nWhen **Earth’s killing mechanism** is unleashed, **stars and constellations** fall into obscurity.\nWhen **humanity’s killing mechanism** is unleashed, **Heaven and Earth reverse**.\n\nWhen **Heaven’s killing mechanism** is unleashed from above,\n**dragons and serpents** respond and rise from the land;\nwhen **Earth’s killing mechanism** is unleashed from below,\n**stars and constellations** respond and fall into obscurity;\nwhen **humanity’s killing mechanism** is unleashed from within,\nthen **above and below** respond, and **Heaven and Earth reverse**.\n\nStrategists who understand this principle\ncompare it to the **Hengshan serpent**—\nstrike its head and its tail responds,\nstrike its tail and its head responds,\nstrike its center and both head and tail respond.\n\nPractitioners who understand this principle\ntake the **head as Heaven**, the **torso as Earth**, and the **heart as humanity**,\ntheir method being to **conceal the spirit within**,\nregulating the **inhalation and exhalation**—\nascending to the **Mingmen (命门)** at the base,\ndescending to the **Dantian (丹田)** above—\ncausing the **Five Phases** to invert and circulate within,\ndescending so that **metal and water** merge with **earth**,\nascending so that **wood and fire** pair with **earth**,\nendlessly rising and falling without end—\nthis is the **reversal of Heaven and Earth within the body**.\n\nThough the two schools speak differently in intent,\ntheir principles converge in harmony.\n\nFor the **benevolent**, this is **benevolence**;\nfor the **wise**, this is **wisdom**—\nyet their essence is one.\n\nOtherwise, why would this text be called the *Yinfu Jing*?\n\nI observe *The Laozi* and find:\n*\"The **spirit of the valley** does not die—\nthis is called the **mysterious female**;\nThe **gate of the mysterious female**—\nthis is called the **root of Heaven and Earth**.*\n*Endlessly present, yet used without exhaustion.\"*\nThis speaks of **cultivation**.\n\nIt further says:\n*\"To govern a great state is like poaching a small fish.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Fine weapons are ominous instruments.\"*\nIndeed, these also encompass **governance**,\nnot solely the **art of cultivation**.\n\nWorks such as *The Zihua Zi*, *The Guan Yin Zi*, *The Wenzzi*, *The Liezi*, and *The Zhuangzi*\nare likewise so.\n\nSome cling to one aspect and speak only of that—\nthis is erroneous.\n\nZhan Gu’s commentary on this text\ntakes **coercive techniques of seduction and warfare** as **strength in battle and victory**—\nthis is the greatest error of all.\n\nWhen **Heaven and humanity’s mechanisms** align,\nthe foundation of **ten thousand transformations** is set.\n\nThe **mechanism of Heaven** and the **mechanism of the human heart** resonate—\nwhen they move, they

know this **mechanism** yet act without recklessness\nis to establish the **root of ten thousand transformations**.\nThus it is said: **\"When Heaven and humanity’s mechanisms align,**\n**the foundation of ten thousand transformations is set.\"**\n\nPractitioners who grasp this **unified mechanism**\nthus, in the stillness of night,\n**concentrate their spirit and gather their qi** in the **Dantian** for a moment—\nwhen **spirit enters qi** and **qi merges with spirit**,\nthey remain **motionless and tranquil**.\nBy the end of **Hai (亥)** and the start of **Zi (子)**,\nwhen **Heaven and

      "translated_text": "The sun advances one degree each day,\nand in one cycle traverses **365¼ degrees** to complete the heavens.\nThe moon advances **thirteen degrees and a fraction** each day,\nand in twenty-eight days completes the heavens—\nyet it requires **two additional days** to align with the sun and form a new moon.\nIn twenty-seven days, it completes the heavens—\nyet it requires **three additional days** to align with the sun and form a new moon.\nThus it is said: **\"The sun and moon have fixed numbers,\nand great and small have determined measures.\"**\n\nThe sage considered that the common people did not know\nthe fixed numbers of the sun and moon,\nand that their **spring plowing and autumn harvests** would lose their proper timing.\nThus he established the calendar and clarified the seasons,\nusing **intercalary months** to regulate the four seasons and complete the year.\n**Every three years**, one intercalary month is added;\n**every five years**, two are added;\n**every nineteen years**, seven are added—\nthis constitutes a **chapter**,\nand thus the new moon always falls on the same day.\nIts numbers are fixed and cannot be altered.\n\nThe sage **assisted the nurturing transformations** of Heaven and Earth,\nand his achievements were such that the common people all came to know\nthe **spirit of the sun and moon**,\nand its principles became clearly manifest.\nThus it is said: **\"The sage’s function emerges,\nand spiritual luminosity arises.\"**\n\nAs for **stealing the mechanism**—\nnone under Heaven can see it,\nnone can know it.\nThe **noble one** who attains it **fortifies his essence**,\nwhile the petty one who attains it **recklessly endangers his life**.\nBefore the mechanism is triggered, it is hidden and does not reveal itself—\nwho can see it?\nWho can know it?\nThus it is called **\"stealing the mechanism.\"**\n\nThis mechanism—\nwhen the noble one attains it, he **fortifies his essence**,\nfor the noble one **knows the Mandate** and does not act recklessly;\nwhen the petty one attains it, he **recklessly endangers his life**,\nfor the petty one **does not know the Mandate** and acts recklessly.\n\nThe blind excel in hearing,\nthe deaf excel in sight.\nCutting off one source of profit,\none’s effectiveness is **tenfold** that of a teacher;\n**threefold reversals** of day and night,\none’s effectiveness is **ten thousandfold** that of a teacher.\nThe blind have no sight, yet their ears are keen;\nthe deaf hear nothing, yet their eyes are sharp—\none focus, undivided.\nThose who study the **Dao**,\nif they can **sever private desires for profit** and apply their will without division,\ntheir effectiveness will be **tenfold** that of the masses.\nPeople merely fail to reflect upon themselves.\n\nIf one can **diligently guard the three essentials**—\n**ears, eyes, and mouth**—\nand maintain sincerity day and night,\ntheir effectiveness will be **ten thousandfold** that of the masses.\n\nThe **heart** arises from things,\ndies from things—\nits mechanism lies in the **eyes**.\nThe heart moves in response to things—this is to **arise from things**;\nto chase after things and forget to return—this is to **die from things**.\nThe heart is the **dwelling of spirit**,\nthe eyes are the **windows of spirit**.\nWhere the eyes go, the heart follows—\nits mechanism indeed lies in the eyes.\n\nHeaven’s **greatest benevolence** arises from its **seeming lack of benevolence**.\nSwift thunder and violent winds—\nall creatures tremble in response.\nHeaven, in its dealings with things,\nlets them follow their natural course—\nthough one might say it has no benevolence.\nYet when it **strikes with thunder and lightning**,\nand **nourishes with wind and rain**,\nall living things beneath Heaven tremble and respond—\nis this not **great benevolence** arising from what seems like none?\n\n**Supreme joy** leaves **nature in excess**,\n**supreme stillness** brings **clarity**.\nThe wise find joy—\njoy brings **knowing the Mandate** and **no cause for worry**,\nso their nature is in **abundance**, unconstrained;\nthe virtuous are still—\nstillness brings **calmness** and **no desires**,\nso their nature is **pure and ungreedy**.\n\nHeaven’s **ultimate particularity** becomes **ultimate universality**.\nHeaven’s **Way** is utterly universal and without particularity.\nPeople see only one thing’s birth, one thing’s growth,\nand assume Heaven’s **ultimate particularity**,\nwithout considering the sun and moon’s illumination,\nthe rain and dew’s reach.\nAll flying, swimming, moving, and rooted beings\neach maintain their **nature and life** while harmonizing with the **Great Unity**—\nthis is Heaven’s **ultimate universality**.\nHow could Heaven ever **partially favor** one thing?\n\nThe **regulation of birds** lies in **qi**.\nIn spring, the **oriole sings**—who makes it sing?\nIn autumn, the **wild geese arrive**—who makes them come?\nThe regulation of birds lies in **qi**.\n\n**Life** is the **root of death**;\n**death** is the **root of life**.\n**Benevolence** arises from **harm**,\n**harm** arises from **benevolence**.\n**Life** refers to the movement of all things—\nwhen movement reaches its extreme, it returns to stillness,\nthus **life is the root of death**.\n**Death** refers to the stillness of all things—\nwhen stillness reaches its extreme, it returns to movement,\nthus **death is the root of life**.\n**Benevolence** refers to Heaven’s **nourishing of things**,\n**harm** refers to Heaven’s **destroying of things**.\nThere is **autumn and winter’s storage and concealment**,\nthen **spring and summer’s flourishing and growth**;\nthere is **spring and summer’s spreading and prosperity**,\nthen **autumn and winter’s withering and fall**.\nThus it is said: **\"Benevolence arises from harm,\nharm arises from benevolence.\"**\n\nThe foolish take Heaven and Earth’s **patterns and principles** as **sagely**,\nI take **seasonal things’ patterns and principles** as **wise**.\nThe foolish consider Heaven and Earth’s **patterns and principles** as **sagely**—\nif sagely, they cannot be fully measured.\nSince they cannot be measured, they do not exhaust their principles.\nThough they call it sagely, they do not know **how** it is sagely.\n\nI consider **seasonal things’ patterns and principles** as **wise**—\nif wise, they can be known.\nThe knowing exhaust their principles to attain knowledge—\nthen even if Heaven and Earth are sagely,\nI too can measure them—\nhow much more so for seasonal things?\nThe **patterns and principles of seasonal things**\nare the **patterns and principles of Heaven and Earth**.\nTo not know Heaven’s **patterns** is to observe only Heaven’s **timely suitability**,\nto not know Earth’s **principles** is to perceive only Earth’s **material tendencies**—\nwhy seek them in the distant and lofty?\n\nThe concluding passage, over a hundred characters long,\nsome take as **commentary**, others as **main text**,\nsuch as: *\"The **Way of Heaven and Earth** is gradual,\nthus **yin and yang** prevail in turn.\"*\nMeaning: In the space between Heaven and Earth,\nwhen **yang is strong**, it **overcomes yin**,\nwhen **yin is strong**, it **overcomes yang**—\nlike water **gradually permeating** things.\nThough Zhu Wuzhi took it as commentary and did not explain it,\nwhen answering his disciples’ questions, he deeply adopted its meaning—\nthus I include it as well.\n\n**Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Symbol Classic***",
