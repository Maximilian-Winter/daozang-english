  "full_translation": "**Western Cloud Collection**\n*Scripture Title: Western Cloud Collection*\n*Author: Qi Zhicheng of the Yuan Dynasty*\n*Three fascicles*\n*Source edition: Zhengtong Daoist Canon, Taiping Section*\n\n**Western Cloud Collection, Fascicle One**\n\n**Seven-Character Quatrains**\n*By Master Dongming*\n\n**Mountain Dwelling – Thirteen Poems**\n\nShaking off the bonds of fame and profit’s prison,\nI return to hide my traces in old forests and hills.\nWhen weary, I sit or lie beneath towering pines,\nBrushing clean the mossy mat to pillow on stone.\n\nHarmonious *qi* suffuses the grotto-heaven,\nNurturing numinous essence as my practice ripens.\nDrunk and drowsing beneath green cliffs, I hear birdsong—\nIt calls forth the scripture of long life and enduring vision.\n\nStolidly forgetting schemes, I escape the world’s cage,\nDrifting like cloud and water, east or west as I please.\nDrunk, I lean on a pillow in the pine’s shade—\nWho plays the reed pipes filling the vast sky?\n\nA solitary wisp of cloud wanders idly,\nThe twin wheels of sun and moon follow their course.\nIf a Daoist’s skill could be thus,\nI would bury my name among the jade peaks.\n\nA stream of green water winds round the brushwood fence,\nOn all sides, blue mountains array their emerald slopes.\nNo carriages or horses pass my gate—\nOnly wild clouds return now and then to the grotto.\n\nThe mountain hall sees no visitors all day,\nIn the still night, tigers sometimes knock at the door.\nWith mind and nature serene in this single retreat,\nHarmonious *qi* ascends to Kunlun’s heights.\n\nBefore the jade peaks, I keep tryst with a friend,\nDelighted, we talk and laugh, forgetting the hour.\nNo red-dust world meets my eyes—\nOnly white clouds atop my head, mirroring the moon’s glow.\n\nWoods and springs nurture my clumsiness, worldly ties fade,\nMy heart-mind untainted, the immortal’s joy is fine.\nStrolling at ease among mountains and waters,\nI return to pillow high on mist and rosy clouds.\n\nOn a still night, I wander amid mountain hues,\nLeaping into empty space, hands flung wide in purple clouds.\nOn wondrous peaks, gibbons cry to the moon;\nBy limpid shallows, tigers roar in the wind.\n\nFor a decade, I’ve hidden among jade peaks,\nFree and at ease within five-colored clouds.\nBeyond the world of men, none know me—\nNorth or south, east or west, I come and go as I will.\n\nWeary of the dusty world, I delight in natural truth,\nBeyond things, I wander carefree, my body unbound.\nDeep in azure mists, no companions—\nOnly the high mountain’s flowing waters as my neighbor.\n\nFew walk the mystic gate, yet I’ve not stood out,\nFinding a hidden place, I hide myself away.\nI seek no worldly glory or noble rank—\nI wish only to be a guardian of clumsiness in woods and springs.\n\nThe grotto-heaven’s wind and moon, water and clouds,\nMagic mushrooms bloom, lotuses open, jade nectar mellows.\nLast night, a blue-robed messenger brought sacred words—\nAll were entrusted to this idle man.\n\n**Expressing Aspirations – Fifty Poems**\n\nWhy would I tire of visitors to my study?\nI fear they bring in right and wrong.\nIf we contend over right and wrong,\nWe lose true leisure and true joy.\n\nIn youth, I severed the web of attachments,\nReturning to reflect and dwell in the Old Master’s house.\nCarefree among water and clouds, I make my living,\nMy life a path of poverty, softness, and weakness.\n\nThoughts are like bubbles on water,\nReflecting light to dispel their traces.\nIf one knows this principle of practice,\nHarmonious *qi* flows through the body of its own.\n\nI envy not the lord of ten thousand households,\nForgetting name and abandoning profit, I have no cares.\nWhen hungry, I beg at doors as fate allows;\nWhen full, I return to my hut to study the butcher’s art.\n\nMy heart-mind untainted, I escape the world’s cage,\nForgetting words, I grasp the meaning—original emptiness.\nGreen mountains hold stones flat as pillows—\nI gladly become the world’s sleepy old man.\n\nSeeing through the vanity of profit and fame,\nI perfect my nature and life, my practice complete.\nThe clamor of clouds’ proud echoes fills my ears—\nRiding a crane, I roam spiritually to the Jade Capital.\n\nMy eyes grow weary in the dusty world’s bustle,\nEverywhere I turn, no emotions entangle my nature.\nClouds part, the blue sky reveals autumn’s bright moon—\nStaff in hand, I step alone onto the Jasper Terrace.\n\nA carefree immortal, drifting at ease,\nWhen weary, I pillow high on clouds to sleep.\nIn dreams, not a speck of dust soils me—\nI transform into golden light filling the cosmos.\n\nI push aside all subtle mechanisms,\nLaying down the whole body to enter non-action.\nResponding to things with true emptiness—\nThis is when a man awakens.\n\nOnce the One Real is fully realized, all entanglements cease,\nNo more wasted time chasing desires.\n*Qi* full, essence abundant, merit and practice complete,\nI ride a whale to return to Yingzhou.\n\nLaying down the whole body, the Dao becomes intimate,\nMy heart ashen, no longer stained by the mundane.\nNuminous light above and below connects heaven and earth—\nA free man, I roam north, south, east, or west.\n\nDeath within death, death within death,\nEnding, then ending again, ending without end.\nThree or five times, the crane’s summons arrives—\nRiding a phoenix, I soar through the nine skies.\n\nSword in hand, I battle demon armies,\nVanquishing demon armies to become a Daoist follower.\nSteadily riding a white ox through grotto-palaces,\nAn idle man who seems not idle at all.\n\nMy celestial skills are beyond mortal measure,\nMy otherworldly mechanisms unknown even to ghosts.\nReturning from audience in the Flowery Canopy’s halls,\nI adjust my rainbow robes to feast at Jasper Pool.\n\nHeart ashen, form withered, I lay down the sword,\nBones and flesh all ascend to Great Luo.\nLooking down on the dusty world’s carriages and horses,\nThey toil daily for paltry fame and profit.\n\nBeyond things, forgetting schemes, I match the sages’ art,\nBreaking through Heaven’s Gate to attend Jasper Pool.\nWho understands the flute played without holes?\nThe zither plucked without strings is known only to me.\n\nIn every encounter, the heart rests, shedding all demons,\nForgetting words, grasping meaning, I lay down the sword.\nThe world’s endless turns hold no end—\nOnly in my hut do I nurture supreme harmony.\n\nPoverty and softness make true cultivation,\nFame and profit’s vanities are all abandoned.\nThe heart-ground clear, nothing else remains—\nOnly pure wind and bright moon fill the jade tower.\n\nPractice suddenly awakens, cutting off dust,\nDispersing deluded clouds, the moon of nature shines.\nForging and refining primordial chaos, it returns to my chamber—\nWithout moving a step, I arrive at Penglai.\n\nPure light gleams, free of the slightest dust,\nVast *qi* flows endlessly, nurturing the Valley Spirit.\nThe man of affairs is not like the man of no affairs—\nI envy not the man of intentions.\n\nHarmonious *qi* suffuses the nine realms,\nThe Azure Dragon steadily carries me from the Ten Isles.\nIn the Hall of Luminous Clarity, reed pipes play—\nDrinking fine wine, what joy!\n\nLast night, a mad Daoist rode a dragon,\nComing especially to speak with me of the mystic wind.\nThe elixir complete, its light waxes and wanes—\nYet it still lacks the world’s pure and tranquil merit.\n\nEverywhere, I see through the original nothingness,\nVast, vast pure wind fills the great void.\nRecognizing the true face within—\nI take this body as a temporary hut.\n\nSuddenly I shed the clamor and sever worldly passions,\nForgetting schemes, forgetting things—even forgetting form.\nSpirit congealed, *qi* knotted, the infant is complete—\nFreely I release and gather, entering the profound obscurity.\n\nMind forgets all realms, emerging from the river of delusion,\nIntent does not sink into emptiness—Daoist practice flourishes.\nClouds disperse, the azure pool gleams pure and bright,\nLuminous light unwavering, *qi* and spirit harmonized.\n\nBamboo desk, rush mat, a humble thatched hall—\nCarefree, without affairs, I conceal my radiance.\nFrom now on, I no longer idly chant verses,\nTo spare others the talk of my shortcomings.\n\nThe red dust’s dream breaks—joy knows no end,\nResponding to things without arising, I gain freedom.\nSpirit and *qi* in harmony, merits complete,\nThe azure simurgh steadily carries me to Yingzhou.\n\nFrom awakening, the perfect truth holds not a coin,\nNot a coin possessed—this is the perfect truth.\nStrange how a tattered quilt warms three winters,\nFor I share half the spring from the pot’s within.\n\nWhen will envy, stinginess, greed cease?\nWhen will *qi*, wealth, wine, and lust come to rest?\nTurning my head, I suddenly awaken—all cast aside,\nLetting go, I return to utter freedom.\n\nA hundred years of light—forty already passed,\nNot a single accomplishment, temples now grizzled.\nLast night, my heart suddenly awakened,\nDwelling in a humble hut, nurturing serenity.\n\nReciting the *Scripture of Ninefold Cyclical Elixir*,\nA decade of drunken dreams startled awake in an instant.\nNo mind to vie for prominence in the world,\nIntent only to hide my name among the mountains.\n\nI’ve wandered north and south, east and west,\nClouds and waters—my conduct nearly sufficient.\nThe world’s livelihood is but clamor,\nThe immortals’ way is naturally subtle.\n\nSitting in stillness, forgetting words, I reflect—\nAdvancing forward, I enter the land of immortals.\nHow can the land of immortals be shown to others?\nWhen yin is exhausted and yang complete, the Dao manifests itself.\n\nSitting in stillness, forgetting words, I reflect—\nAdvancing forward, I step beyond the dusty frontier.\nThe cinnabar field holds a treasure beyond life and death,\nThe square inch without emotion—this is the land of the Dao.\n\nSuddenly severing worldly ties, I yearn for immortal cultivation,\nNature and life merge, attaining spontaneity.\nConfronting realms, the mind turns to ash—one without affairs,\nIn the grotto, high-pillowed, I sleep amidst clouds.\n\nDualities of good and evil arise without cause,\nA single dust-like thought refuses to cease.\nRisking death for a decade, battling strife,\nAt last, I stride alone through the great void.\n\nDwelling in green peaks, my heart’s delight unfurls,\nReclining amidst clouds and mist—what joy!\nSuddenly, my mind and intent leave the mortal world,\nThe divine mechanism awakens, and I swiftly return.\n\nGreen waters, blue mountains—without a speck of dust,\nYet still I seek Penglai in the places I attain.\nThough my thatched hut is humble,\nWho without merit could ever arrive here?\n\nTurning the light inward, I examine human sentiments,\nReflecting back, I observe the world’s heart.\nWhen worldly sentiments and human passions are exhausted,\nI may pillow my head high and sleep on jade peaks.\n\nNot chasing wealth, guarding poverty and leisure—\nWhy should others cast cold eyes upon me?\nWith a flick of my sleeve, I return to the green peaks,\nSoaring high, I recline atop white clouds.\n\nFame and fortune—all cast aside,\nWorldly affairs and human sentiments—all abandoned.\nStraight into the depths of clouded mountains I hide,\nIn my thatched study, I meticulously study the mysterious teachings.\n\nUtterly clumsy, utterly still,\nPure poverty, pure leisure.\nDeep in the golden pavilion mountains, no guests arrive,\nA single censer of incense seals the brushwood gate.\n\nAmidst a thicket of worries, worries grow distant,\nWithin a heap of right and wrong, right and wrong fade.\nThe divine mechanism silently grasps the principle of conduct,\nBetween heaven and earth—this is no falsehood.\n\nHeaven and earth teem with tigers and dragons,\nWielding lightning, thundering—creation’s work.\nThe vast sky roams the carefree wanderer,\nHow could worldly people possess such a way?\n\nEntering the mysterious gate for twenty years,\nI’ve reined in my heart, not letting horse or monkey run wild.\nReturning, I clap my hands and laugh before the cliffs—\nThe Milky Way was always the Milky Way.\n\nUnkempt, grimy, appearing foolish and dull,\nYet within, luminous clarity never dims.\nOnly when the blue-robed messenger delivers good tidings,\nWill you then believe the awakening to the mysterious mechanism.\n\nThree seals on thoughts of self and others, right and wrong,\nA single thought returning to the root—Daoist vision clears.\nHenceforth, I depart the realm of cause and effect,\nSinging alone, drinking alone—rejoicing in non-arising.\n\nLike the arrival of impermanence’s limit,\nHow much better to cease before death.\nCease, cease, cease—until reaching the realm of non-action,\nOnly then do I exit the mundane stream and enter the Daoist flow.\n\nSeizing the power of yin and yang’s creation,\nI become an immortal of Peng Island’s grottoes.\nDragons lead me to slumber on mountain peaks,\nTigers draw me to sleep beneath the sea.\n\nA single bell’s toll startles the dreaming soul,\nThree cock’s crows—departing the imperial city.\nStriding alone atop Kunlun’s summit,\nI look down upon the floating world’s scramble for fame and gain.\n\n*Leaving My Interests* – Five Poems\n\nThe divine sword, since hidden in its scabbard,\nDemonic armies shriek—bones and hair turn cold.\nI’ve wandered all ten directions of the world,\nA single luminous clarity—peace wherever I touch.\n\nThrough kalpas, I’ve lost—today I awaken,\nExamining every head—breaking free from the mortal prison.\nIdly standing before the vast sea’s peaks,\nI chance upon a divine raft sailing the heavens.\n\nGirded sword, riding a dragon—mighty in bearing,\nSoaring at will across the azure vault.\nPassing three mountains by night—dawn still early,\nI lodge at Jade Terrace’s foremost peak.\n\nMountains of uniform green rise into the blue sky,\nA few calls of secluded birds in the setting sun.\nBird calls, mountain hues—none understand,\nOnly the awakened can penetrate creation’s workings.\n\nExamining all ties, I exit the world,\nIn the depths of emerald cliffs—true leisure.\nLying down, I listen to the murmuring stream,\nGazing southwest—more mountains to behold.\n\n*Occasional Verses* – Seven Poems\n\nSeeing through human sentiments, worldly affairs as empty,\nLike tumbleweed and floating clouds, I lodge at heaven’s edge.\nDeep in chaotic mountains, I hide my thatched hut,\nNo longer displaying my illusory form before others.\n\nThoroughly versed in worldly affairs—they are not steadfast,\nI retreat to forests and springs, nurturing vastness.\nOnly when the divine elixir completes its nine cycles,\nWill I ride a black crane upside-down to the three heavens.\n\nNot discussing heavenly or worldly mechanisms,\nAmong pines, I recline and watch white clouds drift.\nIf someone comes to ask about cultivation,\nI smile and point to the cold, emerald western peak.\n\nAt the brink of realms, the mind empties itself,\nHarmonious *qi* circulates, filling the merit of practice.\nInspired, I freely chant amidst green peaks,\nWeary, I recline high amidst white clouds.\n\nMountains encircle the setting sun on all sides,\nA stream’s sound winds around the thatched hall.\nHow laughable—worldly people’s hearts are too turbid,\nSeeking Penglai’s estate upon the sea.\n\nClouded mountains rise on all four sides into the vault of heaven,\nAt their center—a luminous grotto, the Daoist’s hall.\n\nAmidst late spring’s third month, how fine—\nFallen blossoms strewn, their fragrance flowing with the stream.\nGolden Pavilion Mountain harbors a grotto-heaven,\nSince ancient times drawing recluses, sages beyond the dust.\n\nA stream of cloud and water encircles emerald peaks,\nTen thousand acres of mist and rosy clouds seal jade summits.\nTwo idle chants:\n\nMoment by moment, awakening to the Profound Mystery,\nIn every thing, at every turn, the Original Source appears.\nSilence holds unfathomable mechanism,\nNon-doing enacts principles beyond words.\n\nHeart’s truth speaks not of worldly schemes,\nAt ease, I chant verses that capture the moment’s joy.\nHaving affairs—how can it compare to affairless days?\nNon-doing surpasses the times of striving.\n\nTwo playful verses:\n\nBeneath the pavilion, evergreen pines endure four seasons,\nBy their side, silent upon the mossy carpet I stand.\nLast night, walking along the river embankment,\nWillow fluff follows the wind, brushing against me.\n\nWarmth, coolness, cold, heat—four seasons at peace,\nSweet, bitter, pungent, sour—one taste savored.\nThough right and wrong enter the ear,\nNeither honor nor disgrace touches the heart.\n\n*Western Clouds Collection*, Volume One concludes\n*Western Clouds Collection*, Volume Two\nComposed by Master Luminous Grotto\nValley Spirit\n\nBeyond things, I forget schemes and stand at ease,\nIn nothingness, I recognize the original truth.\nFrom Heaven’s Gate surges forth a return to Peng Isle—\nThis family tradition is called Valley Spirit.\n\n*Dead Heart*, Two Verses\n\nHow to still the stirrings of the crowd’s thoughts?\nTracing back, all thoughts arise from the heart alone.\nIf my heart can die before this life ends,\nThe Dao of enriching the state and pacifying the people naturally fulfills.\n\nWhat proof sustains the work of cultivating truth?\nWhen the heart dies, the crowd’s thoughts cease to stir.\nQi brims over, merits and deeds complete—\nSpirit-light illumines the divine capital.\n\n*Awakening to the Dao*, Four Verses\n\nThe master’s secret words open the heart to awakening,\nThe family tradition beyond things is nurtured within the world.\nThough I traverse the world seeking, I cannot find it—\nHow could a crow bring it from amidst the flowers?\n\nForgetting schemes, I sit in blankness and awaken to the true constant,\nThe dharma-nature shines resplendent, filling the great square.\nLead and mercury, two kinds, gathered within the crucible,\nSmelted into a single sheet of crystal light.\n\nImmortals are originally cultivated by humans,\nCut off thoughts, forget form, and escape the prison of the world.\nAwakening thoroughly to the bean’s first moment—no image, no thing—\nWithout leaving the hermitage gate, one arrives at Yingzhou.\n\nThe master’s secret words awaken the original beginning,\nComing with no lack, going with no excess.\nYears of dust and grime are wiped and polished clean—\nThe whole body shines with numinous clarity, illuminating the great void.\n\n*Clouds and Waters*\n\nLeaping from the cage of the mundane, transgressions left behind,\nDrifting clouds and flowing waters—what fine karmic conditions.\nGreen sand covers the ground beneath the pines’ shade,\nIdly keeping company with a recluse, drunk and asleep.\n\n*Admonitions to the Assembly*, Twenty Verses\n\nSight and sound forgotten, the heart-ground grows still,\nJoy and sorrow cut off, qi and spirit harmonize.\n\nFrom the primal beginning, awakening thoroughly to no coming, no going—\nCan you grasp this family’s tradition?\nThe heart must not hastily become a guest of the dustless realm;\nSudden awakening, repeated cultivation—cultivation upon cultivation.\n\nThe nature resembles the autumn moon in the distant sky,\nClear and void, its reflection flowing with the clouds.\nGreen temples now strewn with fresh white hair,\nYet petty fame and profit yield nothing.\n\nWhat use are wealth and nobility in the end?\nThey cannot buy escape from the wheel of rebirth, nor life beyond death.\nWhere now are the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Wei?\nTheir illusory achievements all come to naught.\n\nWould you follow the ancients like Zhang and Fan?\nCome with me to grow old in the clouded niche.\nLet all disputes be settled in non-contention,\nLet self and others dissolve in the patience of endurance.\n\nIf you fully lay down body and mind,\nNuminous radiance will illuminate the vast firmament.\nDo not ensnare others with the profound and wondrous—\nTo my eyes, even the profound and wondrous are empty.\n\nEmpty all traces, then stoke the fire of progress;\nWithin the cinnabar furnace, it naturally glows red.\nDay and night, you toil over fame and profit,\nMorning and dusk, you tend to this illusory body.\n\nThough you may wear purple sashes and golden seals of office,\nHow can they compare to the nameless, idle Daoist?\nOn the path of life and death, people mark the years,\nOn the road of rebirth, travelers count the passing seasons.\n\nPity those who waste body and mind,\nFailing to learn the way of long life and enduring vision.\nDo not mistake the illusory form for the constant body,\nNor speak of the profound as if it were profound again.\n\nWithin the imageless, fathom the true form;\nIn the wordless, awaken to the real meaning.\nA true man leaves behind emotions and desires,\nOne who chases profit and fame is no great man.\n\nThe tangible form is but dung and dust,\nThe nameless, numinous essence is the original body.\nBanish passions, eat plain fare, dispel yin demons,\nSleep little, keep the spirit clear, and qi will naturally harmonize.\n\nIn the twelve hours, no darkness or obscurity,\nWith three thousand merits complete, seek the misty peaks.\nEvery person has the share to become an immortal—\nOnly worldly ties bind them with bitter entanglement.\n\nIf you lay down all worldly ties,\nYou may step upon the clouds from level ground.\nHow laughable are those fellow Dao-seekers,\nMistaking the head for the shadow, taking it as the celestial truth.\n\nIf you do not understand the principle beyond words in cultivation,\nYou will ultimately fail to grasp the form beyond form.\nThe path ahead demands careful heed—\nTread with intent through the brambles.\n\nTen years of diligent practice will see the task complete,\nAnd naturally, the ninefold elixir will be perfected.\nLead and mercury, the two, gathered in the crucible,\nMelt into a single piece of crystal light.\n\nDo not let this supreme scene slip from your heart—\nScholars should examine it closely and in detail.\nExternally repel yin demons, internally fortify yang;\nBeyond this method, there is no other method.\n\nWhen pure yang is refined and yin demons are exhausted,\nNature and life may truly endure.\nThe four great elements of the mortal body do not last long—\nAfter a hundred years, all scatter apart.\n\nOnly when the heart turns to ash do you awaken to the true empty body,\nAnd the jade-like resonance fills the great expanse.\nThe wondrous principles of Qiu and Liu are hard for people to grasp,\nThe mechanisms of Tan and Ma are not transmitted in the world.\n\nThis family’s tradition is attained in purity and stillness—\nOnly then may the practitioner awaken to the profound mystery.\n\n*Idle Thoughts*\n\nDo not idly speculate, carefree one;\nLet your hair down, loosen your robe, and nurture your Daoist talent.\nLast night, in a dream, I returned to my celestial abode,\nWhere numinous light transformed and filled the jade terrace.\n\nShallow pools stir with turbid waves when the wind blows,\nDeep abysses remain clear even when disturbed.\nShallow cultivation leaves the heart unsettled,\nDeep practice in the Dao makes the nature easily understood.\n\n*Three Admonitions to Master Liang on His Travels*\n\nSir, do not exhaust yourself in ceaseless toil—\nWhat is the meaning of your daily cultivation?\nWhen all good and evil are fully laid down,\nThe spirit naturally settles, and qi rises in harmony.\n\nKnow that good and evil are but illusory ties;\nWithout transcending them, how can one be wise?\nHave you yet laid down body and mind?\nOnly then may you escape form and precede the Lord of Creation.\n\n*To Master Liu*\n\nIf you truly aspire to be an immortal, sever all attachments;\nOnly when the nature is settled will you know life is complete.\nThis principle need not be sought outside—\nDo not waste your straw sandals in vain.\n\n**The Craftsman’s Work**\n\nWhen the craftsman’s hand is fit for labor,\nNew fire in the furnace, old tongs and hammer.\nForged into a nameless thing—\nWho else could resemble the true person so closely?\n\n**Four Poems on My Feelings**\n\nDrifting, drifting through this life,\nGain and loss unstartling, honor and disgrace light.\nWho has pierced this truth?\nRetreat when it’s time to withdraw, act when it’s time to engage.\n\nBy water, against mountains, I build a nest,\nA thousand crops in my fields by the stream.\nPeople laugh at my livelihood—\nWhat other skill do I possess?\n\nAvoiding the world, a lazy man with no tricks,\nClumsy and dull, too foolish for subtlety.\nNo need to speak of worldly affairs—\nI’ve won peaceful sleep, my legs stretched free.\n\nMy family’s ways painted on the screen:\nA lean vine, straw hat, light straw sandals.\nI’ve wandered the world with no desire left—\nOnly the heart of a lone cloud, a wild crane.\n\n**The Difficulty of Learning the Dao**\n\nA thousand hearings, yet leaving home is hardest of all,\nA hundred schemes seek leisure, but leisure never comes.\nVexed by worldly dust clinging to the heart’s machinery—\nWhen may I return to lie among the clouds?\n\n**Answering a Daoist Friend’s Question on Cultivation**\n\nDo not toil over exhaustive study—I tell you plainly:\nCast off the bonds of fame to be a free person.\nDwell neither within nor without, nor in between—\nThe whole body, empty and void, is the Dharma-body.\n\n**Answering a Daoist Friend’s Question on the Wondrous Teaching**\n\nWhat of wondrous words and profound sayings?\nTheir secret is not so vast.\nLay down body and mind to be a carefree guest—\nUnclouded spirit, qi harmonized naturally.\n\n**A Daoist Friend Asks How to Transcend Yin and Yang, Creation and Transformation**\n\nNew transgressions cease, old ones dissolve,\nWith no new or old faults, spirit and qi align.\nRefine the luminous pearl until it shines brilliantly—\nYin and yang, creation and transformation are transcended in that moment.\n\n**Fellow Daoists Ask What Evidence Proves Cultivation**\n\nWhat evidence proves the work of refining the true?\nPure conduct and steadfast practice reveal the path.\nObserve those on the road of no-birth—\nWhen realms are forgotten and the heart extinguished, Penglai is their home.\n\n**A Friend Asks About Chang’an**\n\nEach time you endure, you gain leisure,\nWhen circumstances arise, do not interfere.\nIf others vex you but your heart remains unmoved—\nThis alone is Chang’an.\n\n**Answering a Question on Longevity**\n\nWhere root and dust end, the realm is serene and still—\nNo one there knows death or life.\nIf you can walk this far,\nThe nameless, numinous essence fills the great void.\n\n**Answering a Question on Refining Mercury and Lead**\n\nClouds drift upward to the mud-pill palace,\nForm withered, heart ashen, nature spontaneous.\nThis alone is the art of refinement—\nNo need to exhaust debate on mercury and lead.\n\n**To Yang Fuying**\n\nThe Yang family reveres the perfected ones,\nMorning and evening, their incense and devotion are most earnest.\nWhat they receive in this life was accumulated in past lives—\nWhat they cultivate now becomes the cause for the next.\n\n**To Master Li**\n\nSever desire, forget emotion, and the heart hollows itself,\nPenglai is but a footstep away.\nI urge you to guard this single coming—\nAwaken fully to the primordial: is there even an \"one\"?\n\n**Two Poems to Liu Boda**\n\nThe heart’s transformations are beyond measure,\nThe enlightened must understand the great constant.\nIf you fully lay down the whole body,\nVast and boundless, spirit and qi fill the heavens.\n\nA clumsy verse sent to Pengcheng—\nNo scheme compares to guarding purity and clarity.\nWhen inspired, I roam and chant among green peaks;\nWhen weary, I recline high in the white-cloud capital.\n\n**To Yang Quhua**\n\nFor ten years in the dusty world, I sought true worthies,\nOnly to meet an old immortal from Hongnong.\nWith both hands, he snapped the locks of fame and profit—\nHis whole body bathed in the realm of water and clouds.\n\n**Two Poems to Lu Yantong**\n\nGazing down at the sacred turtle playing in dark waves,\nI came to fish it from the river of delusion.\nAlas, it would not take the fragrant bait—\nTurning away, I returned empty-handed to the Great Veil.\n\nHaving cast off the bonds of fame, a talent beyond the dust,\nI idly cast my line from the fishing platform.\nThe bait was thrown at night’s end, but the fish did not bite—\nInstead, I was invited by wind and moon into the cave.\n\n**To Master Su**\n\nRushing south and north through the red dust,\nI laugh at those on the roads to Chang’an.\nBetter to plant grievances within the numinous storehouse—\nHow could it compare to joy and laughter in the celestial truth?\n\n**Two Poems to Scholar Du**\n\nAn empty heart illuminates worldly affairs,\nA full belly contains the patterns of creation.\nResponding to things with a clear and pure eye—\nNaturally, a numinous chapter appears behind your elbow.\n\nRoam freely between heaven and earth,\nCarefree and untrammeled through spring and autumn.\nThough I have not attained the joy of longevity,\nWhen realms vanish and the heart is forgotten, death brings no sorrow.\n\n**To Wang Zheju**\n\nA descendant of Taiyuan, single-minded in purpose,\nHis square inch of heart is dustless, his life and fate whole.\nWidely guiding the deluded to escape the world’s net,\nHe follows in the footsteps of the ancestral masters.\n\n**To Lu Yantong**\n\nBreaking the shackles of love and affection with a single stroke,\nLeaping free from the platform of right and wrong—\nA wanderer amidst mist and clouds in the heart of wild mountains,\nI await the knock upon the pine gate to swing it open.\n\n**Two More Poems**\n\nLu Yantong harbors the intent to leave the household life,\nYet lacks the resolute heart to act.\nThe divine water of his cinnabar field has run dry,\nHis temples bald, teeth sparse, eyes diseased and dim.\nHe comes to the treasure mountain empty-handed,\nOnly to face hardship a few steps ahead.\n\nLong have I known your heart:\nYour lips speak of the profound Dao, yet your nature clings to desire.\nCast aside lustful passions to seek the profound Dao,\nThen you may follow me to dwell on the emerald peaks.\n\n**To Master Fu**\n\nYou have mastered the ways of gain and loss, glory and decay,\nAnd returned to lodge your traces at Ju Yang Hermitage.\nBeyond the world’s affairs, you shall not age,\nEver guiding the deluded as their compass true.\n\n**Two Poems to Householders Pursuing the Dao**\n\nFrom youth you cultivated immortality, escaping the world’s cage,\nYet still fail to recognize your original face.\nTo speak of the Dao while remaining at home—\nHow it would make Lord Pang and Master Xu laugh!\n\nThe mechanism of transcendence is hard to grasp amid desire,\nDwelling in the dust, one cannot aspire to the subtle and serene.\nIf mere words could bring about karmic fruit,\nA painted cake would sate hunger—how could that suffice?\n\n**To Yin Guo**\n\nTending the fire without straying from the furnace’s side,\nOnce the elixir is complete, you awaken to the profound mystery.\nI beg you to seek the wondrous within the subtle,\nWhere the unshaken crucible and hammer are naturally so.\n\n**A Friend Visits**\n\nThe world’s splendor and vanity are all unbearable,\nI conceal my light and hide my tracks, reclining amidst mist and haze.\nWere it not for a knowing friend coming to call,\nWho else would visit this hermitage?\n\n**Visiting a Friend**\n\nGreen waters and blue mountains as close neighbors,\nPure winds and bright moons to keep you company.\nAfter eating when hunger is sated, with nothing left to do,\nI stroll through the pines to pay my respects to an old friend.\n\n**Responding to a Friend’s Poem Seeking the Elixir**\n\nLet no thing enter your heart,\nWherever you turn, without attachment, your nature finds peace.\nGuard well the treasure within your own body,\nNo need to seek the divine elixir elsewhere.\n\n**Parting from a Friend**\n\nA thatched hut by the water, beside a bamboo fence,\nWhere immortal friends dwell together, discoursing on the wondrous Dao.\nWhen shall we meet again after this parting?\nRiding clouds to pay homage before the ancestral masters.\n\n**Two Poems for Master Li**\n\nAsk not how the practice of cultivation fares,\nOnce the demonic hordes are vanquished, the weapons fall still.\nThe celestial palace is not far—\nA heart without dust is the Great Heavenly Net.\n\nIf you still yearn for talents beyond the world,\nSever all ties with the human realm, cutting off comings and goings.\nSeek not the family style beyond appearances—\nWithin your square inch of heart, the jeweled terrace is clearly revealed.\n\n**For a Birthday**\n\nNo need for the zhuangchun’s longevity to bestow upon the worthy,\nI offer these humble words to convey to you:\nDiligently guard your spirit and qi,\nAnd the days and months within the gourd will naturally extend.\n\n**For Prefect Liu’s Birthday**\n\nA man of sincerity and simplicity, held in all men’s esteem,\nHis governance and writings are known throughout the world.\nNo need for mountain recluses to offer blessings—\nThe days and months within his gourd stretch on endlessly.\n\n**In Memory of Master Fu**\n\nThirty years within the gates of the mysterious,\nYet his heart never leapt beyond the five phases.\nNow, laying down this skin-bag, he departs,\nReturning at last to the formless heaven beyond appearances.\n\n**Song Lao’s Transcendence**\n\nHe saw through all karmic entanglements, and they gradually dissolved,\nForgetting the self, his qi and spirit harmonized in stillness.\nEarly on, he completed the work of longevity,\nNo longer seeking the quietude of the human world.\n\n**Two Poems in Lu Yantong’s Rhyme**\n\nSevering the reins of fame and profit from before,\nThe radiance of the spirit shines forth, filling the vast sky.\nOnly then does one know the excellence of the family style beyond the world—\nNo longer do dreams haunt the homeland of the soul.\n\nBreaking the locks of gain, casting off the dust’s reins,\nClouds and waters lead him to study under the true Yang.\nWith immortals of the grotto-palace as companions,\nHe has already left behind the realm of life and death.\n\n**Two Poems in Abbot Rang’s Rhyme**\n\nThe sickness of the self must be seen by the self,\nIn movement and stillness, walking, standing, sitting, or lying.\nA thousand kinds of attachments—all severed,\nNo longer bound by the wheel of rebirth in the human world.\n\nGreen waters and blue mountains, ever pleasing to behold,\nThis body is entirely at ease, like drifting white clouds.\nIn leisure, there is still a hint of something—\nVaguely, the spirit wanders, inquiring of Penglai’s gardens.\n\n**In Master Sun’s Rhyme**\n\nA thatched hut by distant waters, beside a bamboo fence,\nWhere immortal friends dwell together, discoursing on the wondrous Dao.\nBefore the horse and monkey of the mind, the locks are firmly set,\nNaturally, a numinous chapter appears behind your elbow.\n\n*The Central Cloud Collection, Volume Two, Concludes*\n*The Central Cloud Collection, Volume Three*\n\n**By Master Dongming, in Response to Instructor Gao’s Rhyme**\n\nOnly in purity does one perceive the realm beyond the dust,\nOnly in non-doing can one escape the催 of death and life.\nAll worldly affairs—cast them aside,\nLaughing, point to the clouds and mountains and go home.\n\n**Nine Poems by Grand Master Liu of Taiping, Requesting a Response in the Same Rhyme**\n\nDay and night, I urge you: ponder deeply,\nSever all attachments to avoid calamity.\nTurn the mysterious pass, break free from the world’s net,\nTogether return to Penglai Isle to pay homage to Chongyang.\n\nIn cultivation, there is no wondrous harmony or mystery,\nGuard the One, forget form, cut all ties of love.\nFacing circumstances with no mind—truly clear,\nRide a white deer backward into the Jade Heaven.\n\nTen thousand miles without clouds, ten thousand miles of sky,\nThe heart rests, no need to discuss the wondrous or mysterious.\nThe spirit terrace, limpid and pure, is the body of true emptiness,\nResponding to things like a mirror hung in space.\n\nWhere white clouds part, the blue sky appears,\nWhen black mist withdraws, the moon of nature is full.\nIf one grasps this principle,\nThe wondrous, formless body becomes whole of itself.\n\nThe Way of Heaven waxes and wanes, the sun and moon revolve,\nThe human heart, free of filth, is likewise.\nHalf a sip of ghee ascends to the heavens,\nThe jade-like tone resounds, celebrating great years.\n\nCast aside all clamor, delve deeply into the Dao,\nForget both self and things, then awaken to the mystery.\nLet go into the vast emptiness—this pure body,\nIts radiance surpasses even the Dipper and Ox.\n\nSeeking glory ultimately invites disgrace,\nScheming and pretense—knowing them, one loses the real.\nIf one grasps this mechanism,\nUntroubled, one passes through the waning spring.\n\nDay and night, whet the blade to learn the butcher’s art,\nDawn and dusk, equalize all things, yearn for true cultivation.\nWhen the black mist before your eyes is wholly gathered,\nThe golden essence behind your elbow flows of itself.\n\nNot in the tip of the brush or the tip of the tongue,\nBut through true practice, the work is perfected.\nAfter ten years of walking to the place of no-mind,\nA single luminous clarity belongs to nature.\n\n**Two Poems in Response to Envoy Yuan’s Rhyme**\n\nTo remove the false is called harming the real,\nWhen both real and false are removed, no realm can invade.\nThe bones of the Dao are refined, the flute and zither play,\nFlowing rosy clouds celebrate, drunk in the jade forest.\n\nPound yin and yang to pieces, set them in the furnace,\nLightly stoke the fire, let it roll and simmer.\nThe great taboos are defilement by fame, wealth, and desire,\nThose who take this elixir will surely extend their years.\n\n**In Response to Instructor Gao’s Rhyme**\n\nThe immortal wind is awakened, the pure work complete,\nA face of dust—let others not look down.\nThe heart-ground is wholly cleared, nothing else remains,\nExhausting the spirit, only the Dao sustains life.\n\n**Four Poems in Response to Academician Li’s Rhyme**\n\nIn my studio, jade nectar fills the pot and cup,\nBefore my eyes, the green peach blossoms bloom.\nI descended the mountain hall to invite a noble friend,\nYet alas, it came to naught—I returned alone.\n\nI searched through all the fine sights of Yunzhou,\nBut the Golden Pavilion Mountain held the most.\nA flowing stream, one brook, clear and vast,\nSteep peaks on all sides, emerald and towering.\n\nFrom childhood, I left home, far from worldly dust,\nAmidst piled mist and rosy clouds, delighting in nature’s truth.\nThough I have not yet become an immortal and departed,\nFor now, I make the green mountains my master.\n\nReturning to the forest springs to study the Great Mystery,\nGather the heart, do not let the horse and monkey run wild.\nAll worldly affairs—completely unattached,\nVast and boundless, the spirit’s light fills the grotto-heaven.\n\n**Four Poems in Response to Master Fu’s Rhyme**\n\nWorldly fame and merit—I have ceased to strive,\nRetiring, I hide away, pillow high, lying amidst clouds and mist.\nBoundless leisurely realms all belong to me,\nBright moon and clear wind—no need for coin.\n\nAwakening, I am too lazy to chase profit and fame,\nThe life of clouds and water is carefree and at ease.\nBody and nature, serene, return to the grotto palace,\nSuddenly, without care, I arrive in the human world.\n\nAll things I knew came to nothing,\nRetiring, I lie high in the white-cloud capital.\nThe three lights’ wisdom shines, all demons scatter,\nA single thought of no-birth transcends the five elements.\n\nWith mind, one investigates the mindless body,\nWithout affairs, the mysterious is still entangled in right and wrong.\nI only wish these words would awaken people early,\nYet even returning to begin the work may be too late.\n\n**Chongyang**\n\nFrost falls on Wu River, the maple leaves fragrant,\nBy the fence, the chrysanthemums bloom to my heart’s content.\nWhen shall I see the old man of Yuanming,\nTo face the west wind and laugh together?\n\n**Mid-Autumn**\n\nDeeper into the night, clouds retreat, the wind grows clearer,\nThe bright moon’s glow shines all the more.\nWith intent, I drink and chant, sharing the joy with all,\nAn immortal invites me to ascend and play in the divine capital.\n\n**Two Poems for the Double Ninth**\n\nThe three paths of yellow blossoms glow in the setting sun,\nThe forest is full of red leaves, drunk on autumn frost.\nHanging up my cap and returning—this is life’s joy,\nNo envy for the madcap revelry of the poet-official.\n\nHow fine is the Double Ninth, leisure drawing near,\nRed leaves flutter, playing in the west wind.\nThe west wind and red leaves—none understand,\nThose who do grasp the workings of creation.\n\n**Spring Rain**\n\nThe lad transmits the decree, descending from the Jade Capital,\nDragons emerge from the sea, riding the clouds.\nHeaven and Earth send down this pure, cool rain,\nNourishing the yellow sprouts that grow all over the land.\n\n**Rejoicing in Rain**\n\nLong drought, the people suffer, praying to the sacred spirits,\nDragons emerge from the sea, riding clouds and rainbows.\nSweet dew descends in abundance, the farmers rejoice,\nDonning bamboo hats and straw raincoats, they plow through the rain.\n\n**Hearing the Cuckoo**\n\nBefore Golden Pavilion Mountain, the cuckoo cries,\nEach call says, “Better to return.”\nWhich wanderer knows the true meaning of returning?\nOnly then does one realize how rare the enlightened are in this world.\n\n**Two More Poems**\n\nIn the *renzi* year, dwelling in Yunzhou’s Lequan Hermitage.\nFive days after the Summer Solstice, sudden snow fills the sky,\nA yard above the ground, melting into rain.\n\nHalf follows the misty haze, half follows the wind,\nFlying from the heavens, fusing with the earth.\nLike a carefree Daoist of Cloud Brook,\nCultivating primordial *qi*, filling the void.\n\nThe summer heat oppresses, midday sleep deep,\nAwakening, six-sided flakes congeal in the sky.\nYin and yang’s creation—knowing it is upside-down,\nA single piece of the spirit terrace, cold as ice.\n\n**Fishing Alone on a Cold River**\n\nA single straw raincoat, a single leaf of a boat,\nWhy not fold your sleeves and come and go at ease?\nKnowing this moon-white, wind-clear night,\nWhich fish would willingly take the hook?\n\n**Roseleaf Raspberry**\n\nA trellis of roseleaf raspberry flowers in full bloom,\nThe recluse says nothing, pacing back and forth alone.\n\n**When Spring Departs and Returns**\n\nLast year’s spring departed, only to return again,\nThis year’s spring arrives once more, repeating the same.\n\n**The White Cloud Immortal Invites Reclusion**\n\nGreat reclusion need not be in the mountains’ depths—\nEven in the city, one may yearn for true cultivation.\nTo blend with the world while knowing its ways,\nWith withered form and ashen heart, the nature remains free.\n\n**Fool’s Studio**\n\nWhere the Two Modes blur indistinct,\nWhen the primal *qi* was yet undivided.\n\"Recalcitrant as Hui, dull as Shen\"—\nOnly the sage understands this feeling.\n\n**Inscribed on a Paper Fan**\n\nThe immortal realm lies close, its path not long,\nThe spirit terrace unstained, awakened to truth.\nThrough the triple burners, summer heat scorches the bowels,\nYet one wave brings a bone-penetrating cool.\n\n**Inscribed at Dragon Gate’s Nine Dragons Abbey**\n\nDragon Gate’s waters murmur day and night,\nMist and haze veil the low hills.\nEndless scenes lie hidden in the jade-green grotto—\nWho knows Penglai Isle dwells here among men?\n\n**Inscribed at Lintong’s Huaqing Palace**\n\nYin departs, yang returns—such is nature’s way,\nCloud-wrapped mountains conceal a cavern heaven.\nThrough how many cycles of mulberry fields transformed,\nThe cinnabar in the crucible still refines as before.\n\n**Inscribed at Juyang Mountain’s Mingzhen Abbey**\n\nBehind Mingzhen Abbey rises Juyang Mountain,\nEmerald peaks soar amid the azure sky.\nWithin, many carefree recluses dwell,\nEnveloped in white clouds, free and at ease.\n\n**Passing the Frontier at Jin in Autumn, Ding-Si Year**\n\nIn dreams, my heart returns to Guanghan,\nAwakening, I remain in the dusty world.\nA night’s west wind lifts the curtain fiercely,\nBlowing open golden blossoms along the winding rail.\n\n**In the Gui-You Year of Zhiyuan, Accompanying the Imperial Censor on a Sacred Mission to the Mountains and Rivers, Passing Jinan**\n\nRelay horses clatter forth from the imperial capital,\nMountains and waters stir the poet’s heart.\nIn the endless valleys and streams,\nDetached from care, forgetting thought, clarity arises.\n\n**Two Poems on Mount Tai**\n\nStone steps at first ascent daunt the traveler,\nYet rising above the clouds, the heart finds peace.\nWhence comes this celestial wind, so distant,\nMaking this mortal life seem to reach Guanghan?\n\nIn mid-March, I pay homage to Mount Tai,\nThe mountain air crisp, chilling the traveler.\nStanding atop the peak to watch the sunrise,\nGazing down at the mortal world, the vista widens.\n\n**Heavenly Altar**\n\nSleeves billowing in the wind, I visit the immortal altar,\nAlone I come and go where none remain.\nOn jade nights, I pour my own wine,\nWho plays the reed pipes in the azure heavens?\n\n**Two Poems on Presenting Dragon Tablets**\n\nAfter leaving the imperial capital, I reach Heavenly Altar,\nBurning incense there to pray for eternal peace.\nDelighted to witness the immortal lanterns’ auspicious glow,\nUnprepared, I lean on the railing through the fine night.\n\nBy royal command, I descend the vermilion steps,\nCrossing streams and threading forests into the emerald haze.\nOn the day of presenting the dragon tablet at the Queen Mother’s Grotto,\nCranes accompany me, soaring amid rosy clouds.\n\n**Accompanying Attendant Cui Shuwen Across Dongting Lake**\n\nWaters calm, wind gentle, auspicious mists clear,\nI reverently burn fine incense to pray for sagely brightness.\nA clumsy verse composed to pass the time,\nInscribed on Dongting’s wall to mark my passage.\n\n**Inscribed at Zhurong Peak**\n\nWorldly affairs and human sentiments are not worth seeing,\nReturning, I conceal my traces behind pine gates.\nOn the solitary, lofty summit, none come,\nAlone I ride the azure dragon, free to roam.\n\n**Two Poems on Juyong Pass**\n\nHalf a year, how often I’ve passed Juyong Pass,\nWho would believe this idle man is never idle?\nWhat use are these drooping white hairs,\nWhen green mountains remain and waters still murmur?\n\nPine winds and crying crows see travelers home,\nA light rain clears, the path unmuddied.\nTell those who dwell at Juyong Pass,\nSpring’s arrival is surely near.\n\n**Dragon Gate**\n\nAutumn comes, twice I pass Dragon Gate,\nFrom head to toe, I bear the emperor’s grace.\nFeet treading yellow clouds, I return to my homeland,\nHands lifting the blue sea to Kunlun’s heights.\n\n**Penglai Mountain**\n\nSince parting the mortal world to reach Penglai,\nI shall never return to the world of men.\nBeneath green peaks, a thatched hut with bamboo fence,\nLeisurely facing white clouds, at ease.\n\n**Passing Huizhou**\n\nStraw sandals, a bamboo staff, a short hempen robe,\nA drifting cloud, a wandering stream—I pass Huizhou.\nWind and rain urge my verse, yet no fine lines come,\nGreedy to watch the dragons play in the blue current.\n\n**Presenting Tablets at Jiyuan**\n\nThe jade hall’s rites concluded, I receive heaven’s decree,\nBearing the dragon tablets to cast into the water palace.\nIn late winter, harmonious *qi* flourishes,\nThe sacred tortoise swims playfully in the clear stream.\n\n**Presenting Tablets**\n\nRespectfully bearing the dragon tablets from the imperial realm,\nI present them at the Jidu and Songyan shrines.\nHeaven, for the sage’s sake, expands the realm of longevity,\nGreen mountains endless, waters ever flowing.\n\n**On Mount Song, Following Attendant Cui Shuwen’s Rhyme**\n\nA star of office, a feathered guest—delighted to travel together,\nHarmonious *qi* suffuses, auspicious mists float.\nCountless fine mountains greet our horses’ heads,\nEach peak more elegant, each more secluded than the last.\n\n**Ninth Month, Lodging at Qiuyang Abbey Amid Rain**\n\nRain passed, chrysanthemums exude a rare fragrance,\nWind scatters red leaves, hastening autumn’s departure.\nMountain birds fall silent, their mood profound,\nNameless wild grasses hold deeper principles.\n\n**Mount Hua**\n\nJust awakened by the sound of a spring, I seek the true,\nBefore the wind, beneath the moon.\nLeaping upward to the southern peak’s summit,\nI turn to gaze at the Northern Star’s reflected light.\n\n**Two Poems on Passing Jingxing**\n\nSpurring my horse at dawn through Jingxing,\nThe rugged long road stirs my poetic heart.\nIf this journey were governed by cock’s crow,\nHow often would my immortal dreams be shattered?\n\nLayered cold clouds gather at my horse’s hooves,\nGreen mountains loom before its head.\nThe scenery is fine, yet no fine verse comes,\nGreedy to listen to apes’ cries and tigers’ roars.\n\n**Inscribed at Hidden Spring**\n\nMountain contours coil around the surging spring,\nThe grotto gate high, clouds and mist emerge.\nTurning back from the world’s bustling vanities,\nI claim this grotto as my own paradise.\n\n**Self-Portrait**\n\nThirst quenched with the elixir of heaven and earth,\nHunger sated with the flesh of dragons and tigers.\nSuch joys are the idle man’s alone—\nNot easily known by those who are not idle.\n\n**Quatrain**\n\nHere is the translation:\n\n---\n\nLong have I admired the land west of the Pure Yang Palace in Yongle, Hezhong, where the terrain is most excellent. I once considered relocating the burial site of my late master, the Perfected One of Cloud-Dispersing. The decision remained unresolved when, one day in stillness, I saw my master pass by the door. I hurried after him, but he had already vanished. Thereupon I composed this quatrain:\n\nUnknowing, unaware—one may simply return,\nClear and bright, it is fitting for the season.\nMatters of two ends follow your use of them;\nFar or near, non-action is yet no lack of action.\n\n**Answering a Question on Cultivation (Two Poems)**\nI offer my humble views in reply to you,\nThe master’s profound words awakening the original truth.\nThough I have yet to fully comprehend,\nI need not again play the fool’s guide.\n\nWhen the heart arises, myriad dusty conditions follow;\nWhen intent dissolves, all aligns with the sage’s mechanism.\nIf one can grasp this principle,\nWithout moving a step, one arrives at Jasper Pool.\n\n**Expressing My Feelings at Fanghu in Changchun Palace (Two Poems)**\nThe winding balustrade and secluded garden hold uncommon scenes,\nPines and cypresses stand dense as the setting sun descends.\nJade nectar brewed, I drink it beneath the moon;\nJade hairpins carry fragrance through the courtyard.\n\nI would take the vast sea as fine wine,\nAnd a gourd ladle as my giant cup.\nHonoring the aged, I invite them to drink through the night,\nDelighted by the company of pine winds and bamboo moonlight.\n\n**Four Poems on the Upper Hermitage of Pengshan**\nFor ten years I have dwelt in the mountains, far from worldly affairs,\nIn recent years, my dreaming soul seems lighter.\nSleepless in the deep night, I sit in joy;\nThe bright moon fills the hall, the wind grows clearer.\n\nThree sides of perilous peaks array like emerald screens,\nDeep in the crags, ancient trees bear auspicious clouds.\nI came intending to forget thoughts of return,\nYet how can I, when my work remains unfinished?\n\nWithin the courtyard, yellow blossoms bloom in all seasons,\nClouds, mountains, waters, and bamboo encircle the pavilion.\nDo not say fine scenery goes unvisited—\nWind and moon need no invitation to come of themselves.\n\nLeaning against the mountain, facing the stream, I build my thatched hut,\nThe gate opens amid the shadows of green pines.\nThis cave-heaven, though near, remains untrodden by men;\nWhite clouds and secluded birds come and go.\n\n**Inscribed on Mount Song, the Central Peak**\nEmerald screens, jade pillars, and the Golden Flask—\nI have traversed all peaks, yet none compare.\nOrchid and angelica fragrance fills the courtyard,\nWater’s radiance and mountain hues encircle my thatched hut.\n\n**The Filial Son**\nLoyal and obedient, steadfast, he forgets worldly attitudes,\nIn mourning, he strictly observes rites, casting aside frivolity.\nHow many filial sons exist in the world?\nHow many households emulate such sincerity?\n\n**Two Poems on Seeing a Pavilion at Wutai on Mount Feng**\nAt Wutai, a pavilion overlooks a clear stream,\nBrocade trees and screen-like mountains enclose it on all sides.\nA stretch of mist and rosy clouds, the place untouched by footprints—\nI take up my staff and walk alone, watching clouds take flight.\n\nYellow essence and aged trees serve as fine wine,\nEarthenware and porcelain cups replace jade goblets.\nI specially descended Wutai to invite old friends,\nYet alas, it did not come to pass—I returned alone.\n\n**Addressing the Assembly**\nNorth, south, east, west—all is one sky,\nWithin it, the subtle principles are truly transmitted.\nMyriad affairs do not cling to the heart’s head;\nA single luminous clarity belongs to nature.\n\n**Thanking Magistrate Zhang Junyu**\nIn the summer of the *guisi* year of the Zhiyuan era, Magistrate Zhang Junyu of the Imperial Library was dispatched by imperial decree to discuss the establishment of a shrine in the mountains. Due to my aged infirmity and grave illness, it did not come to pass. Thus, I composed this poem in gratitude.\n\nDelighted to meet a kindred spirit, I spoke of our original bond,\nHow could I not wholeheartedly explain our lineage’s ways?\nAshamed of my lack of talent to aid the world,\nI can only be master to the green mountains.\n\n**Inscribed on White Cloud Hermitage**\nOn the Double Ninth Festival, people vie to admire the scenery,\nI drag my staff of *li* wood to wander among the crowd.\nAt the immortal’s abode, I ask where the clouds reside—\nWhite Cloud Hermitage lies near White Cloud Tower.\n\n**Returning to the Old Retreat on Jin’ge Mountain**\nIn my old age, I pass the remaining years beneath the pines,\nRecalling a couplet from my predecessor’s poem.\nWith a generous heart, I while away the days,\nCalmly opening my Daoist eye to gaze upon the blue sky.\n\n**For the Tile-Maker**\nGreen and white, clinking and clanking, four corners square,\nMatching length, width, and thickness without dispute.\nAs if born to be broken, returning to the original master,\nI compose this rustic poem as proof.\n\n**Leaving the World (Two Poems)**\nFrom now on, I will have nothing to do with worldly affairs,\nFor ten years I have lived free and unfettered among the peaks.\nWhen the three thousand merits are complete, I ascend to the origin at dawn,\nAt midnight, I ride a dragon to the Moon Palace.\n\nHarmonious *qi* circulates, the true nature unfolds,\nRefining spirit and merging with the Dao, I rise beyond the dust.\nReleasing my grip, I soar on the wind,\nTurning my head, I shall not return to the human world.\n\n**End of the Lower Scroll of *Western Cloud Collection***",

Canon, Taiping Section*\n\n**Western Cloud Collection, Fascicle One**\n\n**Seven-Character Quatrains**\n*By Master Dongming*\n\n**Mountain Dwelling – Thirteen Poems**\n\nShaking off the bonds of fame and profit’s prison,\nI return to hide my traces in old forests and hills.\nWhen weary, I sit or lie beneath towering pines,\nBrushing clean the mossy mat to pillow on stone.\n\nHarmonious *qi* suffuses the grotto-heaven,\nNurturing numinous essence as my practice ripens.\nDrunk and drowsing beneath green cliffs, I hear birdsong—\nIt calls forth the scripture of long life and enduring vision.\n\nStolidly forgetting schemes, I escape the world’s cage,\nDrifting like cloud and water, east or west as I please.\nDrunk, I lean on a pillow in the pine’s shade—\nWho plays the reed pipes filling the vast sky?\n\nA solitary wisp of cloud wanders idly,\nThe twin wheels of sun and moon follow their course.\nIf a Daoist’s skill could be thus,\nI would bury my name among the jade peaks.\n\nA stream of green water winds round the brushwood fence,\nOn all sides, blue mountains array their emerald slopes.\nNo carriages or horses pass my gate—\nOnly wild clouds return now and then to the grotto.\n\nThe mountain hall sees no visitors all day,\nIn the still night, tigers sometimes knock at the door.\nWith mind and nature serene in this single retreat,\nHarmonious *qi* ascends to Kunlun’s heights.\n\nBefore the jade peaks, I keep tryst with a friend,\nDelighted, we talk and laugh, forgetting the hour.\nNo red-dust world meets my eyes—\nOnly white clouds atop my head, mirroring the moon’s glow.\n\nWoods and springs nurture my clumsiness, worldly ties fade,\nMy heart-mind untainted, the immortal’s joy is fine.\nStrolling at ease among mountains and waters,\nI return to pillow high on mist and rosy clouds.\n\nOn a still night, I wander amid mountain hues,\nLeaping into empty space, hands flung wide in purple clouds.\nOn wondrous peaks, gibbons cry to the moon;\nBy limpid shallows, tigers roar in the wind.\n\nFor a decade, I’ve hidden among jade peaks,\nFree and at ease within five-colored clouds.\nBeyond the world of men, none know me—\nNorth or south, east or west, I come and go as I will.\n\nWeary of the dusty world, I delight in natural truth,\nBeyond things, I wander carefree, my body unbound.\nDeep in azure mists, no companions—\nOnly the high mountain’s flowing waters as my neighbor.\n\nFew walk the mystic gate, yet I’ve not stood out,\nFinding a hidden place, I hide myself away.\nI seek no worldly glory or noble rank—\nI wish only to be a guardian of clumsiness in woods and springs.\n\nThe grotto-heaven’s wind and moon, water and clouds,\nMagic mushrooms bloom, lotuses open, jade nectar mellows.\nLast night, a blue-robed messenger brought sacred words—\nAll were entrusted to this idle man.\n\n**Expressing Aspirations – Fifty Poems**\n\nWhy would I tire of visitors to my study?\nI fear they bring in right and wrong.\nIf we contend over right and wrong,\nWe lose true leisure and true joy.\n\nIn youth, I severed the web of attachments,\nReturning to reflect and dwell in the Old Master’s house.\nCarefree among water and clouds, I make my living,\nMy life a path of poverty, softness, and weakness.\n\nThoughts are like bubbles on water,\nReflecting light to dispel their traces.\nIf one knows this principle of practice,\nHarmonious *qi* flows through the body of its own.\n\nI envy not the lord of ten thousand households,\nForgetting name and abandoning profit, I have no cares.\nWhen hungry, I beg at doors as fate allows;\nWhen full, I return to my hut to study the butcher’s art.\n\nMy heart-mind untainted, I escape the world’s cage,\nForgetting words, I grasp the meaning—original emptiness.\nGreen mountains hold stones flat as pillows—\nI gladly become the world’s sleepy old man.\n\nSeeing through the vanity of profit and fame,\nI perfect my nature and life, my practice complete.\nThe clamor of clouds’ proud echoes fills my ears—\nRiding a crane, I roam spiritually to the Jade Capital.\n\nMy eyes grow weary in the dusty world’s bustle,\nEverywhere I turn, no emotions entangle my nature.\nClouds part, the blue sky reveals autumn’s bright moon—\nStaff in hand, I step alone onto the Jasper Terrace.\n\nA carefree immortal, drifting at ease,\nWhen weary, I pillow high on clouds to sleep.\nIn dreams, not a speck of dust soils me—\nI transform into golden light filling the cosmos.\n\nI push aside all subtle mechanisms,\nLaying down the whole body to enter non-action.\nResponding to things with true emptiness—\nThis is when a man awakens.\n\nOnce the One Real is fully realized, all entanglements cease,\nNo more wasted time chasing desires.\n*Qi* full, essence abundant, merit and practice complete,\nI ride a whale to return to Yingzhou.\n\nLaying down the whole body, the Dao becomes intimate,\nMy heart ashen, no longer stained by the mundane.\nNuminous light above and below connects heaven and earth—\nA free man, I roam north, south, east, or west.\n\nDeath within death, death within death,\nEnding, then ending again, ending without end.\nThree or five times, the crane’s summons arrives—\nRiding a phoenix, I soar through the nine skies.\n\nSword in hand, I battle demon armies,\nVanquishing demon armies to become a Daoist follower.\nSteadily riding a white ox through grotto-palaces,\nAn idle man who seems not idle at all.\n\nMy celestial skills are beyond mortal measure,\nMy otherworldly mechanisms unknown even to ghosts.\nReturning from audience in the Flowery Canopy’s halls,\nI adjust my rainbow robes to feast at Jasper Pool.\n\nHeart ashen, form withered, I lay down the sword,\nBones and flesh all ascend to Great Luo.\nLooking down on the dusty world’s carriages and horses,\nThey toil daily for paltry fame and profit.\n\nBeyond things, forgetting schemes, I match the sages’ art,\nBreaking through Heaven’s Gate to attend Jasper Pool.\nWho understands the flute played without holes?\nThe zither plucked without strings is known only to me.\n\nIn every encounter, the heart rests, shedding all demons,\nForgetting words, grasping meaning, I lay down the sword.\nThe world’s endless turns hold no end—\nOnly in my hut do I nurture supreme harmony.\n\nPoverty and softness make true cultivation,\nFame and profit’s vanities are all abandoned.\nThe heart-ground clear, nothing else remains—\nOnly pure wind and bright moon fill the jade tower.\n\nPractice suddenly awakens, cutting off dust,\nDispersing deluded clouds, the moon of nature shines.\nForging and refining primordial chaos, it returns to my chamber—\nWithout moving a step, I arrive at Penglai.\n\nPure light gleams, free of the slightest dust,\nVast *qi* flows endlessly, nurturing the Valley Spirit.\nThe man of affairs is not like the man of no affairs—\nI envy not the man of intentions.\n\nHarmonious *qi* suffuses the nine realms,\nThe Azure Dragon steadily carries me from the Ten Isles.\nIn the Hall of Luminous Clarity, reed pipes play—\nDrinking fine wine, what joy!\n\nLast night, a mad Daoist rode a dragon,\nComing especially to speak with me of the mystic wind.\nThe elixir complete, its light waxes and wanes—\nYet it still lacks the world’s pure and tranquil merit.\n\nEverywhere, I see through the original nothingness,\nVast, vast pure wind fills the great void.\nRecognizing the true face within—\nI take this body as a temporary hut.",

complete—\nFreely I release and gather, entering the profound obscurity.\n\nMind forgets all realms, emerging from the river of delusion,\nIntent does not sink into emptiness—Daoist practice flourishes.\nClouds disperse, the azure pool gleams pure and bright,\nLuminous light unwavering, *qi* and spirit harmonized.\n\nBamboo desk, rush mat, a humble thatched hall—\nCarefree, without affairs, I conceal my radiance.\nFrom now on, I no longer idly chant verses,\nTo spare others the talk of my shortcomings.\n\nThe red dust’s dream breaks—joy knows no end,\nResponding to things without arising, I gain freedom.\nSpirit and *qi* in harmony, merits complete,\nThe azure simurgh steadily carries me to Yingzhou.\n\nFrom awakening, the perfect truth holds not a coin,\nNot a coin possessed—this is the perfect truth.\nStrange how a tattered quilt warms three winters,\nFor I share half the spring from the pot’s within.\n\nWhen will envy, stinginess, greed cease?\nWhen will *qi*, wealth, wine, and lust come to rest?\nTurning my head, I suddenly awaken—all cast aside,\nLetting go, I return to utter freedom.\n\nA hundred years of light—forty already passed,\nNot a single accomplishment, temples now grizzled.\nLast night, my heart suddenly awakened,\nDwelling in a humble hut, nurturing serenity.\n\nReciting the *Scripture of Ninefold Cyclical Elixir*,\nA decade of drunken dreams startled awake in an instant.\nNo mind to vie for prominence in the world,\nIntent only to hide my name among the mountains.\n\nI’ve wandered north and south, east and west,\nClouds and waters—my conduct nearly sufficient.\nThe world’s livelihood is but clamor,\nThe immortals’ way is naturally subtle.\n\nSitting in stillness, forgetting words, I reflect—\nAdvancing forward, I enter the land of immortals.\nHow can the land of immortals be shown to others?\nWhen yin is exhausted and yang complete, the Dao manifests itself.\n\nSitting in stillness, forgetting words, I reflect—\nAdvancing forward, I step beyond the dusty frontier.\nThe cinnabar field holds a treasure beyond life and death,\nThe square inch without emotion—this is the land of the Dao.\n\nSuddenly severing worldly ties, I yearn for immortal cultivation,\nNature and life merge, attaining spontaneity.\nConfronting realms, the mind turns to ash—one without affairs,\nIn the grotto, high-pillowed, I sleep amidst clouds.\n\nDualities of good and evil arise without cause,\nA single dust-like thought refuses to cease.\nRisking death for a decade, battling strife,\nAt last, I stride alone through the great void.\n\nDwelling in green peaks, my heart’s delight unfurls,\nReclining amidst clouds and mist—what joy!\nSuddenly, my mind and intent leave the mortal world,\nThe divine mechanism awakens, and I swiftly return.\n\nGreen waters, blue mountains—without a speck of dust,\nYet still I seek Penglai in the places I attain.\nThough my thatched hut is humble,\nWho without merit could ever arrive here?\n\nTurning the light inward, I examine human sentiments,\nReflecting back, I observe the world’s heart.\nWhen worldly sentiments and human passions are exhausted,\nI may pillow my head high and sleep on jade peaks.\n\nNot chasing wealth, guarding poverty and leisure—\nWhy should others cast cold eyes upon me?\nWith a flick of my sleeve, I return to the green peaks,\nSoaring high, I recline atop white clouds.\n\nFame and fortune—all cast aside,\nWorldly affairs and human sentiments—all abandoned.\nStraight into the depths of clouded mountains I hide,\nIn my thatched study, I meticulously study the mysterious teachings.\n\nUtterly clumsy, utterly still,\nPure poverty, pure leisure.\nDeep in the golden pavilion mountains, no guests arrive,\nA single censer of incense seals the brushwood gate.\n\nAmidst a thicket of worries, worries grow distant,\nWithin a heap of right and wrong, right and wrong fade.\nThe divine mechanism silently grasps the principle of conduct,\nBetween heaven and earth—this is no falsehood.\n\nHeaven and earth teem with tigers and dragons,\nWielding lightning, thundering—creation’s work.\nThe vast sky roams the carefree wanderer,\nHow could worldly people possess such a way?\n\nEntering the mysterious gate for twenty years,\nI’ve reined in my heart, not letting horse or monkey run wild.\nReturning, I clap my hands and laugh before the cliffs—\nThe Milky Way was always the Milky Way.\n\nUnkempt, grimy, appearing foolish and dull,\nYet within, luminous clarity never dims.\nOnly when the blue-robed messenger delivers good tidings,\nWill you then believe the awakening to the mysterious mechanism.\n\nThree seals on thoughts of self and others, right and wrong,\nA single thought returning to the root—Daoist vision clears.\nHenceforth, I depart the realm of cause and effect,\nSinging alone, drinking alone—rejoicing in non-arising.\n\nLike the arrival of impermanence’s limit,\nHow much better to cease before death.\nCease, cease, cease—until reaching the realm of non-action,\nOnly then do I exit the mundane stream and enter the Daoist flow.\n\nSeizing the power of yin and yang’s creation,\nI become an immortal of Peng Island’s grottoes.\nDragons lead me to slumber on mountain peaks,\nTigers draw me to sleep beneath the sea.\n\nA single bell’s toll startles the dreaming soul,\nThree cock’s crows—departing the imperial city.\nStriding alone atop Kunlun’s summit,\nI look down upon the floating world’s scramble for fame and gain.\n\n*Leaving My Interests* – Five Poems\n\nThe divine sword, since hidden in its scabbard,\nDemonic armies shriek—bones and hair turn cold.\nI’ve wandered all ten directions of the world,\nA single luminous clarity—peace wherever I touch.\n\nThrough kalpas, I’ve lost—today I awaken,\nExamining every head—breaking free from the mortal prison.\nIdly standing before the vast sea’s peaks,\nI chance upon a divine raft sailing the heavens.\n\nGirded sword, riding a dragon—mighty in bearing,\nSoaring at will across the azure vault.\nPassing three mountains by night—dawn still early,\nI lodge at Jade Terrace’s foremost peak.\n\nMountains of uniform green rise into the blue sky,\nA few calls of secluded birds in the setting sun.\nBird calls, mountain hues—none understand,\nOnly the awakened can penetrate creation’s workings.\n\nExamining all ties, I exit the world,\nIn the depths of emerald cliffs—true leisure.\nLying down, I listen to the murmuring stream,\nGazing southwest—more mountains to behold.\n\n*Occasional Verses* – Seven Poems\n\nSeeing through human sentiments, worldly affairs as empty,\nLike tumbleweed and floating clouds, I lodge at heaven’s edge.\nDeep in chaotic mountains, I hide my thatched hut,\nNo longer displaying my illusory form before others.\n\nThoroughly versed in worldly affairs—they are not steadfast,\nI retreat to forests and springs, nurturing vastness.\nOnly when the divine elixir completes its nine cycles,\nWill I ride a black crane upside-down to the three heavens.\n\nNot discussing heavenly or worldly mechanisms,\nAmong pines, I recline and watch white clouds drift.\nIf someone comes to ask about cultivation,\nI smile and point to the cold, emerald western peak.\n\nAt the brink of realms, the mind empties itself,\nHarmonious *qi* circulates, filling the merit of practice.\nInspired, I freely chant amidst green peaks,\nWeary, I recline high amidst white clouds.\n\nMountains encircle the setting sun on all sides,\nA stream’s sound winds around the thatched hall.\nHow laughable—worldly people’s hearts are too turbid,\nSeeking Penglai’s estate upon the sea.\n\nClouded mountains rise on all four sides into the vault of heaven,\nAt their center—a luminous grotto, the Daoist’s hall.",

sleep, my legs stretched free.\n\nMy family’s ways painted on the screen:\nA lean vine, straw hat, light straw sandals.\nI’ve wandered the world with no desire left—\nOnly the heart of a lone cloud, a wild crane.\n\n**The Difficulty of Learning the Dao**\n\nA thousand hearings, yet leaving home is hardest of all,\nA hundred schemes seek leisure, but leisure never comes.\nVexed by worldly dust clinging to the heart’s machinery—\nWhen may I return to lie among the clouds?\n\n**Answering a Daoist Friend’s Question on Cultivation**\n\nDo not toil over exhaustive study—I tell you plainly:\nCast off the bonds of fame to be a free person.\nDwell neither within nor without, nor in between—\nThe whole body, empty and void, is the Dharma-body.\n\n**Answering a Daoist Friend’s Question on the

thrown at night’s end, but the fish did not bite—\nInstead, I was invited by wind and moon into the cave.\n\n**To Master Su**\n\nRushing south and north through the red dust,\nI laugh at those on the roads to Chang’an.\nBetter to plant grievances within the numinous storehouse—\nHow could it compare to joy and laughter in the celestial truth?\n\n**Two Poems to Scholar Du**\n\nAn empty heart

mountains,\nI await the knock upon the pine gate to swing it open.\n\n**Two More Poems**\n\nLu Yantong harbors the intent to leave the household life,\nYet lacks the resolute heart to act.\nThe divine water of his cinnabar field has run dry,\nHis temples bald, teeth sparse, eyes diseased and dim.\nHe comes to the treasure mountain empty-handed,\nOnly to face hardship a few steps ahead.\n\nLong have I known your heart:\nYour lips speak of the profound Dao, yet your nature clings to desire.\nCast aside lustful passions to seek the profound Dao,\nThen you may follow me to dwell on the emerald peaks.\n\n**To Master Fu**\n\nYou have mastered the ways of gain and loss, glory and decay,\nAnd returned to lodge your traces at Ju Yang Hermitage.\nBeyond the world’s affairs, you shall not age,\nEver guiding the deluded as their compass true.\n\n**Two Poems to Householders Pursuing the Dao**\n\nFrom youth you cultivated immortality, escaping the world’s cage,\nYet still fail to recognize your original face.\nTo speak of the Dao while remaining at home—\nHow it would make Lord Pang and Master Xu laugh!\n\nThe mechanism of transcendence is hard to grasp amid desire,\nDwelling in the dust, one cannot aspire to the subtle and serene.\nIf mere words could bring about karmic fruit,\nA painted cake would sate hunger—how could that suffice?\n\n**To Yin Guo**\n\nTending the fire without straying from the furnace’s side,\nOnce the elixir is complete, you awaken to the profound mystery.\nI beg you to seek the wondrous within the subtle,\nWhere the unshaken crucible and hammer are naturally so.\n\n**A Friend Visits**\n\nThe world’s splendor and vanity are all unbearable,\nI conceal my light and hide my tracks, reclining amidst mist and haze.\nWere it not for a knowing friend coming to call,\nWho else would visit this hermitage?\n\n**Visiting a Friend**\n\nGreen waters and blue mountains as close neighbors,\nPure winds and bright moons to keep you company.\nAfter eating when hunger is sated, with nothing left to do,\nI stroll through the pines to pay my respects to an old friend.\n\n**Responding to a Friend’s Poem Seeking the Elixir**\n\nLet no thing enter your heart,\nWherever you turn, without attachment, your nature finds peace.\nGuard well the treasure within your own body,\nNo need to seek the divine elixir elsewhere.\n\n**Parting from a Friend**\n\nA thatched hut by the water, beside a bamboo fence,\nWhere immortal friends dwell together, discoursing on the wondrous Dao.\nWhen shall we meet again after this parting?\nRiding clouds to pay homage before the ancestral masters.\n\n**Two Poems for Master Li**\n\nAsk not how the practice of cultivation fares,\nOnce the demonic hordes are vanquished, the weapons fall still.\nThe celestial palace is not far—\nA heart without dust is the Great Heavenly Net.\n\nIf you still yearn for talents beyond the world,\nSever all ties with the human realm, cutting off comings and goings.\nSeek not the family style beyond appearances—\nWithin your square inch of heart, the jeweled terrace is clearly revealed.\n\n**For a Birthday**\n\nNo need for the zhuangchun’s longevity to bestow upon the worthy,\nI offer these humble words to convey to you:\nDiligently guard your spirit and qi,\nAnd the days and months within the gourd will naturally extend.\n\n**For Prefect Liu’s Birthday**\n\nA man of sincerity and simplicity, held in all men’s esteem,\nHis governance and writings are known throughout the world.\nNo need for mountain recluses to offer blessings—\nThe days and months within his gourd stretch on endlessly.\n\n**In Memory of Master Fu**\n\nThirty years within the gates of the mysterious,\nYet his heart never leapt beyond the five phases.\nNow, laying down this skin-bag, he departs,\nReturning at last to the formless heaven beyond appearances.\n\n**Song Lao’s Transcendence**\n\nHe saw through all karmic entanglements, and they gradually dissolved,\nForgetting the self, his qi and spirit harmonized in stillness.\nEarly on, he completed the work of longevity,\nNo longer seeking the quietude of the human world.\n\n**Two Poems in Lu Yantong’s Rhyme**\n\nSevering the reins of fame and profit from before,\nThe radiance of the spirit shines forth, filling the vast sky.\nOnly then does one know the excellence of the family style beyond the world—\nNo longer do dreams haunt the homeland of the soul.\n\nBreaking the locks of gain, casting off the dust’s reins,\nClouds and waters lead him to study under the true Yang.\nWith immortals of the grotto-palace as companions,\nHe has already left behind the realm of life and death.\n\n**Two Poems in Abbot Rang’s Rhyme**\n\nThe sickness of the self must be seen by the self,\nIn movement and stillness, walking, standing, sitting, or lying.\nA thousand kinds of attachments—all severed,\nNo longer bound by the wheel of rebirth in the human world.\n\nGreen waters and blue mountains, ever pleasing to behold,\nThis body is entirely at ease, like drifting white clouds.\nIn leisure, there is still a hint of something—\nVaguely, the spirit wanders, inquiring of Penglai’s gardens.\n\n**In Master Sun’s Rhyme**\n\nA thatched hut by distant waters, beside a bamboo fence,\nWhere immortal friends dwell together, discoursing on the wondrous Dao.\nBefore the horse and monkey

      "translated_text": "**By Master Dongming, in Response to Instructor Gao’s Rhyme**\n\nOnly in purity does one perceive the realm beyond the dust,\nOnly in non-doing can one escape the催 of death and life.\nAll worldly affairs—cast them aside,\nLaughing, point to the clouds and mountains and go home.\n\n**Nine Poems by Grand Master Liu of Taiping, Requesting a Response in the Same Rhyme**\n\nDay and night, I urge you: ponder deeply,\nSever all attachments to avoid calamity.\nTurn the mysterious pass, break free from the world’s net,\nTogether return to Penglai Isle to pay homage to Chongyang.\n\nIn cultivation, there is no wondrous harmony or mystery,\nGuard the One, forget form, cut all ties of love.\nFacing circumstances with no mind—truly clear,\nRide a white deer backward into the Jade Heaven.\n\nTen thousand miles without clouds, ten thousand miles of sky,\nThe heart rests, no need to discuss the wondrous or mysterious.\nThe spirit terrace, limpid and pure, is the body of true emptiness,\nResponding to things like a mirror hung in space.\n\nWhere white clouds part, the blue sky appears,\nWhen black mist withdraws, the moon of nature is full.\nIf one grasps this principle,\nThe wondrous, formless body becomes whole of itself.\n\nThe Way of Heaven waxes and wanes, the sun and moon revolve,\nThe human heart, free of filth, is likewise.\nHalf a sip of ghee ascends to the heavens,\nThe jade-like tone resounds, celebrating great years.\n\nCast aside all clamor, delve deeply into the Dao,\nForget both self and things, then awaken to the mystery.\nLet go into the vast emptiness—this pure body,\nIts radiance surpasses even the Dipper and Ox.\n\nSeeking glory ultimately invites disgrace,\nScheming and pretense—knowing them, one loses the real.\nIf one grasps this mechanism,\nUntroubled, one passes through the waning spring.\n\nDay and night, whet the blade to learn the butcher’s art,\nDawn and dusk, equalize all things, yearn for true cultivation.\nWhen the black mist before your eyes is wholly gathered,\nThe golden essence behind your elbow flows of itself.\n\nNot in the tip of the brush or the tip of the tongue,\nBut through true practice, the work is perfected.\nAfter ten years of walking to the place of no-mind,\nA single luminous clarity belongs to nature.\n\n**Two Poems in Response to Envoy Yuan’s Rhyme**\n\nTo remove the false is called harming the real,\nWhen both real and false are removed, no realm can invade.\nThe bones of the Dao are refined, the flute and zither play,\nFlowing rosy clouds celebrate, drunk in the jade forest.\n\nPound yin and yang to pieces, set them in the furnace,\nLightly stoke the fire, let it roll and simmer.\nThe great taboos are defilement by fame, wealth, and desire,\nThose who take this elixir will surely extend their years.\n\n**In Response to Instructor Gao’s Rhyme**\n\nThe immortal wind is awakened, the pure work complete,\nA face of dust—let others not look down.\nThe heart-ground is wholly cleared, nothing else remains,\nExhausting the spirit, only the Dao sustains life.\n\n**Four Poems in Response to Academician Li’s Rhyme**\n\nIn my studio, jade nectar fills the pot and cup,\nBefore my eyes, the green peach blossoms bloom.\nI descended the mountain hall to invite a noble friend,\nYet alas, it came to naught—I returned alone.\n\nI searched through all the fine sights of Yunzhou,\nBut the Golden Pavilion Mountain held the most.\nA flowing stream, one brook, clear and vast,\nSteep peaks on all sides, emerald and towering.\n\nFrom childhood, I left home, far from worldly dust,\nAmidst piled mist and rosy clouds, delighting in nature’s truth.\nThough I have not yet become an immortal and departed,\nFor now, I make the green mountains my master.\n\nReturning to the forest springs to study the Great Mystery,\nGather the heart, do not let the horse and monkey run wild.\nAll worldly affairs—completely unattached,\nVast and boundless, the spirit’s light fills the grotto-heaven.\n\n**Four Poems in Response to Master Fu’s Rhyme**\n\nWorldly fame and merit—I have ceased to strive,\nRetiring, I hide away, pillow high, lying amidst clouds and mist.\nBoundless leisurely realms all belong to me,\nBright moon and clear wind—no need for coin.\n\nAwakening, I am too lazy to chase profit and fame,\nThe life of clouds and water is carefree and at ease.\nBody and nature, serene, return to the grotto palace,\nSuddenly, without care, I arrive in the human world.\n\nAll things I knew came to nothing,\nRetiring, I lie high in the white-cloud capital.\nThe three lights’ wisdom shines, all demons scatter,\nA single thought of no-birth transcends the five elements.\n\nWith mind, one investigates the mindless body,\nWithout affairs, the mysterious is still entangled in right and wrong.\nI only wish these words would awaken people early,\nYet even returning to begin the work may be too late.\n\n**Chongyang**\n\nFrost falls on Wu River, the maple leaves fragrant,\nBy the fence, the chrysanthemums bloom to my heart’s content.\nWhen shall I see the old man of Yuanming,\nTo face the west wind and laugh together?\n\n**Mid-Autumn**\n\nDeeper into the night, clouds retreat, the wind grows clearer,\nThe bright moon’s glow shines all the more.\nWith intent, I drink and chant, sharing the joy with all,\nAn immortal invites me to ascend and play in the divine capital.\n\n**Two Poems for the Double Ninth**\n\nThe three paths of yellow blossoms glow in the setting sun,\nThe forest is full of red leaves, drunk on autumn frost.\nHanging up my cap and returning—this is life’s joy,\nNo envy for the madcap revelry of the poet-official.\n\nHow fine is the Double Ninth, leisure drawing near,\nRed leaves flutter, playing in the west wind.\nThe west wind and red leaves—none understand,\nThose who do grasp the workings of creation.\n\n**Spring Rain**\n\nThe lad transmits the decree, descending from the Jade Capital,\nDragons emerge from the sea, riding the clouds.\nHeaven and Earth send down this pure, cool rain,\nNourishing the yellow sprouts that grow all over the land.\n\n**Rejoicing in Rain**\n\nLong drought, the people suffer, praying to the sacred spirits,\nDragons emerge from the sea, riding clouds and rainbows.\nSweet dew descends in abundance, the farmers rejoice,\nDonning bamboo hats and straw raincoats, they plow through the rain.\n\n**Hearing the Cuckoo**\n\nBefore Golden Pavilion Mountain, the cuckoo cries,\nEach call says, “Better to return.”\nWhich wanderer knows the true meaning of returning?\nOnly then does one realize how rare the enlightened are in this world.\n\n**Two More Poems**\n\nIn the *renzi* year, dwelling in Yunzhou’s Lequan Hermitage.\nFive days after the Summer Solstice, sudden snow fills the sky,\nA yard above the ground, melting into rain.\n\nHalf follows the misty haze, half follows the wind,\nFlying from the heavens, fusing with the earth.\nLike a carefree Daoist of Cloud Brook,\nCultivating primordial *qi*, filling the void.\n\nThe summer heat oppresses, midday sleep deep,\nAwakening, six-sided flakes congeal in the sky.\nYin and yang’s creation—knowing it is upside-down,\nA single piece of the spirit terrace, cold as ice.\n\n**Fishing Alone on a Cold River**\n\nA single straw raincoat, a single leaf of a boat,\nWhy not fold your sleeves and come and go at ease?\nKnowing this moon-white, wind-clear night,\nWhich fish would willingly take the hook?\n\n**Roseleaf Raspberry**\n\nA trellis of roseleaf raspberry flowers in full bloom,\nThe recluse says nothing, pacing back and forth alone.",

Immortal Invites Reclusion**\n\nGreat reclusion need not be in the mountains’ depths—\nEven in the city, one may yearn for true cultivation.\nTo blend with the world while knowing its ways,\nWith withered form and ashen heart, the nature remains free.\n\n**Fool’s Studio**\n\nWhere the Two Modes blur indistinct,\nWhen the primal *qi* was yet undivided.\n\"Recalcitrant as Hui, dull as Shen\"—\nOnly the sage understands this feeling.\n\n**Inscribed on a Paper Fan**\n\nThe immortal realm lies close, its path not long,\nThe spirit terrace unstained, awakened to truth.\nThrough the triple burners, summer heat scorches the bowels,\nYet one wave brings a bone-penetrating cool.\n\n**Inscribed at Dragon Gate’s Nine Dragons Abbey**\n\nDragon Gate’s waters murmur day and night,\nMist and haze veil the low hills.\nEndless scenes lie hidden in the jade-green grotto—\nWho knows Penglai Isle dwells here among men?\n\n**Inscribed at Lintong’s Huaqing Palace**\n\nYin departs, yang returns—such is nature’s way,\nCloud-wrapped mountains conceal a cavern heaven.\nThrough how many cycles of mulberry fields transformed,\nThe cinnabar in the crucible still refines as before.\n\n**Inscribed at Juyang Mountain’s Mingzhen Abbey**\n\nBehind Mingzhen Abbey rises Juyang Mountain,\nEmerald peaks soar amid the azure sky.\nWithin, many carefree recluses dwell,\nEnveloped in white clouds, free and at ease.\n\n**Passing the Frontier at Jin in Autumn, Ding-Si Year**\n\nIn dreams, my heart returns to Guanghan,\nAwakening, I remain in the dusty world.\nA night’s west wind lifts the curtain fiercely,\nBlowing open golden blossoms along the winding rail.\n\n**In the Gui-You Year of Zhiyuan, Accompanying the Imperial Censor on a Sacred Mission to the Mountains and Rivers, Passing Jinan**\n\nRelay horses clatter forth from the imperial capital,\nMountains and waters stir the poet’s heart.\nIn the endless valleys and streams,\nDetached from care, forgetting thought, clarity arises.\n\n**Two Poems on Mount Tai**\n\nStone steps at first ascent daunt the traveler,\nYet rising above the clouds, the heart finds peace.\nWhence comes this celestial wind, so distant,\nMaking this mortal life seem to reach Guanghan?\n\nIn mid-March, I pay homage to Mount Tai,\nThe mountain air crisp, chilling the traveler.\nStanding atop the peak to watch the sunrise,\nGazing down at the mortal world, the vista widens.\n\n**Heavenly Altar**\n\nSleeves billowing in the wind, I visit the immortal altar,\nAlone I come and go where none remain.\nOn jade nights, I pour my own wine,\nWho plays the reed pipes in the azure heavens?\n\n**Two Poems on Presenting Dragon Tablets**\n\nAfter leaving the imperial capital, I reach Heavenly Altar,\nBurning incense there to pray for eternal peace.\nDelighted to witness the immortal lanterns’ auspicious glow,\nUnprepared, I lean on the railing through the fine night.\n\nBy royal command, I descend the vermilion steps,\nCrossing streams and threading forests into the emerald haze.\nOn the day of presenting the dragon tablet at the Queen Mother’s Grotto,\nCranes accompany me, soaring amid rosy clouds.\n\n**Accompanying Attendant Cui Shuwen Across Dongting Lake**\n\nWaters calm, wind gentle, auspicious mists clear,\nI reverently burn fine incense to pray for sagely brightness.\nA clumsy verse composed to pass the time,\nInscribed on Dongting’s wall to mark my passage.\n\n**Inscribed at Zhurong Peak**\n\nWorldly affairs and human sentiments are not worth seeing,\nReturning, I conceal my traces behind pine gates.\nOn the solitary, lofty summit, none come,\nAlone I ride the azure dragon, free to roam.\n\n**Two Poems on Juyong Pass**\n\nHalf a year, how often I’ve passed Juyong Pass,\nWho would believe this idle man is never idle?\nWhat use are these drooping white hairs,\nWhen green mountains remain and waters still murmur?\n\nPine winds and crying crows see travelers home,\nA light rain clears, the path unmuddied.\nTell those who dwell at Juyong Pass,\nSpring’s arrival is surely near.\n\n**Dragon Gate**\n\nAutumn comes, twice I pass Dragon Gate,\nFrom head to toe, I bear the emperor’s grace.\nFeet treading yellow clouds, I return to my homeland,\nHands lifting the blue sea to Kunlun’s heights.\n\n**Penglai Mountain**\n\nSince parting the mortal world to reach Penglai,\nI shall never return to the world of men.\nBeneath green peaks, a thatched hut with bamboo fence,\nLeisurely facing white clouds, at ease.\n\n**Passing Huizhou**\n\nStraw sandals, a bamboo staff, a short hempen robe,\nA drifting cloud, a wandering stream—I pass Huizhou.\nWind and rain urge my verse, yet no fine lines come,\nGreedy to watch the dragons play in the blue current.\n\n**Presenting Tablets at Jiyuan**\n\nThe jade hall’s rites concluded, I receive heaven’s decree,\nBearing the dragon tablets to cast into the water palace.\nIn late winter, harmonious *qi* flourishes,\nThe sacred tortoise swims playfully in the clear stream.\n\n**Presenting Tablets**\n\nRespectfully bearing the dragon tablets from the imperial realm,\nI present them at the Jidu and Songyan shrines.\nHeaven, for the sage’s sake, expands the realm of longevity,\nGreen mountains endless, waters ever flowing.\n\n**On Mount Song, Following Attendant Cui Shuwen’s Rhyme**\n\nA star of office, a feathered guest—delighted to travel together,\nHarmonious *qi* suffuses, auspicious mists float.\nCountless fine mountains greet our horses’ heads,\nEach peak more elegant, each more secluded than the last.\n\n**Ninth Month, Lodging at Qiuyang Abbey Amid Rain**\n\nRain passed, chrysanthemums exude a rare fragrance,\nWind scatters red leaves, hastening autumn’s departure.\nMountain birds fall silent, their mood profound,\nNameless wild grasses hold deeper principles.\n\n**Mount Hua**\n\nJust awakened by the sound of a spring, I seek the true,\nBefore the wind, beneath the moon.\nLeaping upward to the southern peak’s summit,\nI turn to gaze at the Northern Star’s reflected light.\n\n**Two Poems on Passing Jingxing**\n\nSpurring my horse at dawn through Jingxing,\nThe rugged long road stirs my poetic heart.\nIf this journey were governed by cock’s crow,\nHow often would my immortal dreams be shattered?\n\nLayered cold clouds gather at my horse’s hooves,\nGreen

Thereupon I composed this quatrain:\n\nUnknowing, unaware—one may simply return,\nClear and bright, it is fitting for the season.\nMatters of two ends follow your use of them;\nFar or near, non-action is yet no lack of action.\n\n**Answering a Question on Cultivation (Two Poems)**\nI offer my humble views in reply to you,\nThe master’s profound words awakening the original truth.\nThough I have yet to fully comprehend,\nI need not again play the fool’s guide.\n\nWhen the heart arises, myriad dusty conditions follow;\nWhen intent dissolves, all aligns with the sage’s mechanism.\nIf one can grasp this principle,\nWithout moving a step, one arrives at Jasper Pool.\n\n**Expressing My Feelings at Fanghu in Changchun Palace (Two Poems)**\nThe winding balustrade and secluded garden hold uncommon scenes,\nPines and cypresses stand dense as the setting sun descends.\nJade nectar brewed, I drink it beneath the moon;\nJade hairpins carry fragrance through the courtyard.\n\nI would take the vast sea as fine wine,\nAnd a gourd ladle as my giant cup.\nHonoring the aged, I invite them to drink through the night,\nDelighted by the company of pine winds and bamboo moonlight.\n\n**Four Poems on the Upper Hermitage of Pengshan**\nFor ten years I have dwelt in the mountains, far from worldly affairs,\nIn recent years, my dreaming soul seems lighter.\nSleepless in the deep night, I sit in joy;\nThe bright moon fills the hall, the wind grows clearer.\n\nThree sides of perilous peaks array like emerald screens,\nDeep in the crags, ancient trees bear auspicious clouds.\nI came intending to forget thoughts of return,\nYet how can I, when my work remains unfinished?\n\nWithin the courtyard, yellow blossoms bloom in all seasons,\nClouds, mountains, waters, and bamboo encircle the pavilion.\nDo not say fine scenery goes unvisited—\nWind and moon need no invitation to come of themselves.\n\nLeaning against the mountain, facing the stream, I build my thatched hut,\nThe gate opens amid the shadows of green pines.\nThis cave-heaven, though near, remains untrodden by men;\nWhite clouds and secluded birds come and go.\n\n**Inscribed on Mount Song, the Central Peak**\nEmerald screens, jade pillars, and the Golden Flask—\nI have traversed all peaks, yet none compare.\nOrchid and angelica fragrance fills the courtyard,\nWater’s radiance and mountain hues encircle my thatched hut.\n\n**The Filial Son**\nLoyal and obedient, steadfast, he forgets worldly attitudes,\nIn mourning, he strictly observes rites, casting aside frivolity.\nHow many filial sons exist in the world?\nHow many households emulate such sincerity?\n\n**Two Poems on Seeing a Pavilion at Wutai on Mount Feng**\nAt Wutai, a pavilion overlooks a clear stream,\nBrocade trees and screen-like mountains enclose it on all sides.\nA stretch of mist and rosy clouds, the place untouched by footprints—\nI take up my staff and walk alone, watching clouds take flight.\n\nYellow essence and aged trees serve as fine wine,\nEarthenware and porcelain cups replace jade goblets.\nI specially descended Wutai to invite old friends,\nYet alas, it did not come to pass—I returned alone.\n\n**Addressing the Assembly**\nNorth, south, east, west—all is one sky,\nWithin it, the subtle principles are truly transmitted.\nMyriad affairs do not cling to the heart’s head;\nA single luminous clarity belongs to nature.\n\n**Thanking Magistrate Zhang Junyu**\nIn the summer of the *guisi* year of the Zhiyuan era, Magistrate Zhang Junyu of the Imperial Library was dispatched by imperial decree to discuss the establishment of a shrine in the mountains. Due to my aged infirmity and grave illness, it did not come to pass. Thus, I composed this poem in gratitude.\n\nDelighted to meet a kindred spirit, I spoke of our original bond,\nHow could I not wholeheartedly explain our lineage’s ways?\nAshamed of my lack of talent to aid the world,\nI can only be master to the green mountains.\n\n**Inscribed on White Cloud Hermitage**\nOn the Double Ninth Festival, people vie to admire the scenery,\nI drag my staff of *li* wood to wander among the crowd.\nAt the immortal’s abode, I ask where the clouds reside—\nWhite Cloud Hermitage lies near White Cloud Tower.\n\n**Returning to the Old Retreat on Jin’ge Mountain**\nIn my old age, I pass the remaining years beneath the pines,\nRecalling a couplet from my predecessor’s poem.\nWith a generous heart, I while away the days,\nCalmly opening my Daoist eye to gaze upon the blue sky.\n\n**For the Tile-Maker**\nGreen and white, clinking and clanking, four corners square,\nMatching length, width, and thickness without dispute.\nAs if born to be broken, returning to the original master,\nI compose this rustic poem as proof.\n\n**Leaving the World (Two Poems)**\nFrom now on, I will have nothing to do with worldly affairs,\nFor ten years I have lived free and unfettered among the peaks.\nWhen the three thousand merits are complete, I ascend to the origin at dawn,\nAt midnight, I ride a dragon to the Moon Palace.\n\nHarmonious *qi* circulates, the true nature unfolds,\nRefining spirit and merging with the Dao, I rise beyond the dust.\nReleasing my grip, I soar on the wind,\nTurning my head, I shall not return to the human world.\n\n**End of the Lower Scroll of *Western Cloud Collection***",
      "overlap_context": " verse comes,\nGreedy to listen to apes’ cries and tigers’ roars.\n\n**Inscribed at Hidden Spring**\n\nMountain contours coil around the surging spring,\nThe grotto gate high, clouds and mist emerge.\nTurning back from the world’s bustling vanities,\nI claim this grotto as my own paradise.\n\n**Self-Portrait**\n\nThirst quenched with the elixir of heaven and earth,\nHunger sated with the flesh of dragons and tigers.\nSuch joys are the idle man’s alone—\nNot easily known by those who are not idle.\n\n**Quatrain**",
