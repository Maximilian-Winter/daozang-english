  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Scripture of Daoist Guidance Through the Three Lights and Nine Transformations**\n\nIn the primordial antiquity, the Most High Sages, the Limitless Heavenly Perfected Ones, the Mysterious Harmony Spirit Consort, and the Radiant Jade Maiden, together with the thirty-two Heavenly Lords and Heavenly Emperors, the Heavenly Perfected Great Spirits, the Numinous Treasure Perfected Ones, the hosts of all heavenly immortals, immortal youths and jade maidens, the true officials of the sun and moon, the arrayed luminaries and stars, the boundless celestial attendants, and the wandering immortals dwelling within the sun, moon, and stars—at the time of the true *qi* of the Great Yang, during the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months, they draw the essence of the sun with the left hand and the soul of the moon with the right, gazing upward to pay homage to the myriad sages and bowing downward to receive the radiance of the constellations. Thus they cultivate the Dao of the True Constant of Stabilizing Light.\n\nIts names are eight: the first is *Flowing Essence*, the second *Lustrous Infant*, the third *Dharma Qi*, the fourth *Yang Jade*, the fifth *Cloud Blossom*, the sixth *Daoist Immortal*, the seventh *Nine Transformations*, and the eighth *Stabilizing Light*.\n\nWhen this Dao is fully accomplished, one returns to the true and constant. Rising and descending with the *qi*, one merges with the mysterious Dao, neither born nor extinguished, enduring for countless kalpas. All the true immortals of the heavens delight in its practice. The Lord of the Sun, the Emperor of the Moon, and the true officials of the stellar lodges also constantly engage with it; none fail to marvel at the Dao of the True Constant.\n\nThe primordial *qi* exhales the celestial flowing essence, rinses the *Lustrous Infant*, extends the *Dharma Qi*, guides and governs the *Yang Jade*, refines the *Cloud Blossom*, transforms and evolves the *Daoist Immortal*, transcends through the *Nine Transformations*, the body generating wondrous radiance, the hands revolving the *Stabilizing Light*, leaping in reflection through the great void, ascending beyond the Three Realms, forever escaping birth and death, and soaring to the Upper Palaces.\n\nThe Five Venerable Great Sages and the Perfected Ones of all heavens guide the *Flowing Essence* of the Three Lights. At that time, one hundred and twenty-five Perfected Ones recite and chant the eight concordant sounds of the Dharma.\n\nThe wondrous Dao divides into one *qi*,\nWithin the *qi*, yin and yang part.\nCongealing, they transform into the sun, moon, and stars,\nResplendent, they flow as the Three Lights.\nThe Nine Blossoms contain the Nine Daos,\nThe Eight Colors delight the Eight Directions.\nBrilliant, they illuminate the true body of the Cavern,\nThe flowing essence returns to the Great Vastness.\nBelow, it generates the Abyssal Spring Palace,\nAbove, it arrays the Realm of Non-Where.\nThe body released, traces take flight,\nSuddenly, all is forgotten.\nThe Seven Treasures form the flowing essence,\nChaos intermingles with fragrant blossoms.\nSwallowing the *Nine Clouds Powder*,\nThis joy knows no end.\n\nWhen the guidance of the *Flowing Essence* and the recitation of the concord are complete, ingest the three talismans.\n\nThe Five Venerable Great Sages and the Perfected Ones of all heavens guide the *Lustrous Infant* of the Three Lights. At that time, one hundred and twenty-five Perfected Ones recite and chant the eight concordant sounds of the Dharma.\n\nWithin the profound and absolute nine *qi*,\nThe *Lustrous Infant* arises from the Great Non-Being.\nThe *Yuyi* shines in the Valley of the Sun,\nThe *Jielin* radiates upon the celestial thoroughfare.\nThe Five Stars stream forth precious light,\nThe Dipper and Pole revolve the celestial pivot.\nFlying *qi* billows and scatters,\nSwallowing and guiding, one lingers in hesitation.\nTranscending traces upon the Stairway of Heavenly Treasures,\nRefining the magic mushrooms and ingesting blossoms.\n*Qi* spreads, the myriad spirits are complete,\nThe body ascends into the Great Void.\n\nWhen the guidance of the *Lustrous Infant* and the recitation of the concord are complete, ingest the three talismans.\n\nThe Five Venerable Great Sages and the Perfected Ones of all heavens guide the *Dharma Qi* of the Three Lights. At that time, one hundred and twenty-five Perfected Ones recite and chant the eight concordant sounds of the Dharma.\n\nThe vast and crystalline *Dharma Qi* arises,\nMisty and dense, it congeals in the mysterious center.\nThe Two Luminaries together become limpid,\nThe Five Wefts interpenetrate.\nThe Three Lights shine resplendently,\nPrecious *qi* fills the Three Palaces.\nThe Imperial Realm gathers the Nine Elders,\nSwallowing and ingesting, the hundred bones flourish.\nGolden blossoms illuminate the Mirror of Light,\nThe body becomes one with the sun and moon.\nContemplating the Dao before the Upper Sages,\nFor ten thousand kalpas, life knows no end.\n\nWhen the guidance of the *Dharma Qi* and the recitation of the concord are complete, ingest the three talismans.\n\nThe Five Venerable Great Sages and the Perfected Ones of all heavens guide the *Yang Jade* of the Three Lights. At that time, one hundred and twenty-five Perfected Ones recite and chant the eight concordant sounds of the Dharma.\n\nThe true *qi* of *Yang Jade* is upright,\nThe wondrous Dao divides the Three Radiant Ones.\nThe Mysterious Harmony chants the numinous sound,\nThe Eight Harmonies unfold the jade script.\nThe Five Elders darkly dwell in the cinnabar abode,\nFloating, they ride the radiant clouds.\nThe Great Sages and hosts of all heavens,\nMount dragons and drink the Jade Nectar.\nThe Three and Five determine the register of life,\nPlaying and frolicking as guests of the Most High.\nThe blossoming light shines boundlessly,\nHand in hand, they pay homage at the dawn of the Emperor.\n\nWhen the guidance of *Yang Jade* and the recitation of the concord are complete, ingest the three talismans.\n\nThe Five Venerable Great Sages and the Perfected Ones of all heavens guide the *Cloud Blossom* of the Three Lights.

At that time, one hundred and twenty-five Perfected Ones recite and chant the eight concordant sounds of the Dharma.\n\nThe Dao of the Supreme Perfected is supreme indeed,\nWondrous are the chapters of the Numinous Treasure.\nDrawing in the radiance, one guides the Five Stars,\nSwallowing and inhaling, one visualizes their effulgent rays.\nFlowing essence bathes the hundred bodies,\nLuminous and crystalline as congealed frost and snow.\nThe cavernous illumination shines within and without,\nAll dross and dust utterly vanish.\nThe flesh flourishes, never to age again,\nAttaining this is called *Stabilizing Light*.\nForever feasting in the Palace of Great Clarity,\nThis is the Land of Unending Day.\nGathering one’s traces to return to the root,\nThe Nine Transformations congeal true constancy.\n\nWhen the guidance of *Stabilizing Light* and the recitation of the concord are complete, ingest the three talismans.\n\nAfter ingesting the talismans and bowing to the Perfected,\nGuide the body, swallow *qi*,\nThe Two Radiances merge as one,\nThe Three Lights converge in harmony.\nMy body transcends,\nUniting with the light as one.\nIn response, it returns to being;\nIn stillness, it enters non-being.\nRoaming the Great Void,\nHidden or manifest, boundless.\nThrough this freedom,\nOne becomes the Perfect Person of Natural Spontaneity,\nAlso named the *Stabilizing Light Perfected of the Thirty-Two Heavens of the Primordial Beginning, the Five Venerables, and the Numinous Treasure*.\n\nEver in the company of the Ten Poles’ Great Sages,\nThe Ten Flowered Lofty Perfected,\nThe Four Heavenly Thearchs,\nThe Five Venerable Lords of the Dao,\nAttended by a thousand Perfected and ten thousand spirits,\nAnd the officials of the Three Realms,\nThey wander and rest in the Gates of Cavernous Yang,\nWithin the Terrace of Absolute Contemplation.\nHere lie the Heaven of August Antiquity,\nThe Heaven of Harmonious Yang,\nThe Heaven of Ascending Perfection,\nThe Heaven of Cloud-Crossing—\nEach of the Four Heavens contains thirty-six lands,\nEach land has its lords and ministers, its territories,\nIts people and emperors,\nIts avian Kunlun,\nIts Jasper Capital and Golden Palaces,\nIts Mysterious Metropolis and Five Marchmounts,\nIts divine bureaus of immortals,\nIts great marshes and famed mountains,\nIts Eight Mighty Spirit-Beasts,\nAll creatures that fly and dive, swim and soar,\nScales and shells, feathers and fur,\nHills and forests, all that wriggles and stirs,\nTransformed into the Seven Treasures,\nIlluminating the four directions.\nThe Dharma drums shake the heavens,\nThe numinous sounds harmonize in concert,\nSinging the chapters of the Eight Assemblies of the Most High.\n\nThose newly initiated into learning as Immortals,\nWho gain the privilege to observe and listen,\nAscend the cosmic net and fly through the records,\nFollowing the records, they revolve through the Dipper and enter the Ladle,\nSwallowing the primordial, ingesting essence,\nFusing spirit with the wondrous,\nHands turning the Six Perfections,\nFeet treading the Nine Flowers,\nBody soaring into the void,\nMerging with the radiance as one,\nForever ascending the wondrous Dao,\nPreserved eternally beyond heaven.\n\nThe Heaven of Jade Perfection,\nThe Heaven of Reverent Splendor,\nThe Heaven of August Cliff,\nThe Heaven of Primordial Cavern—\nHere stands the Terrace of Vast Yang and Mysterious Origin,\nWhere the Perfected of the Nine Transformations ascend.\n\nThe Heaven of Harmonious Youth,\nThe Heaven of Ancestral Drift,\nThe Heaven of Ultimate Wind,\nThe Heaven of Wondrous Completion—\nHere stand the Forest of Jade Splendor and the Terrace of Cloud-Soaring,\nWhere the Perfected of Guiding Immortals ascend.\n\nThe Heaven of Level Nurturing,\nThe Heaven of August Reed,\nThe Heaven of Filial Radiance,\nThe Heaven of Forbidden Heights—\nHere stands the Terrace of Mysterious Prosperity and Treasure,\nWhere the Perfected of Cloud Splendor ascend.\n\nThe Heaven of Literary Elevation,\nThe Heaven of Hallowed Radiance,\nThe Heaven of Venerable Weight,\nThe Heaven of Constant Fusion—\nHere stands the Terrace of Returning Yin and Great Perfection,\nWhere the Perfected of Jade Yang ascend.\n\nThe Heaven of Seven Luminaries,\nThe Heaven of Upright Serenity,\nThe Heaven of River Origin,\nThe Heaven of Soaring Victory—\nHere stands the Terrace of Cloud-Formed Numinous Flight,\nWhere the Perfected of Dharma *Qi* ascend.\n\nThe Heaven of Crossing the Scales,\nThe Heaven of Reverent Celebration,\nThe Heaven of Upper Divination,\nThe Heaven of Brahmanic Crossing—\nHere stands the Terrace of Boundless Contemplation,\nWhere the Perfected of Overflowing Essence ascend.\n\nThe Heaven of Concealing Mist,\nThe Heaven of Ultimate Jade,\nThe Heaven of Vow-Swearing,\nThe Heaven of Gambling—\nHere stands the Terrace of Ten Absolutes and Nine Flowers,\nWhere the Perfected of Flowing Essence ascend.\n\nThese eight terraces are where the Perfected of the Three Lights,\nThe Heavenly Kings of the Four Heavens,\nAnd the various Perfected Ones ascend to wander and feast.\nThe celestial texts and jade scriptures,\nCarved in jade characters,\nAre kept within these terraces,\nNamed the *Mandates of the Eight Heavens of the Primordial Beginning*.\n\nThose who guide and lead revere and ingest,\nTransforming their substance and altering their form,\nRefining the body of conditioned existence,\nTo enter the Dao of formlessness.\n\nDuring cultivation,\nOne retreats to a separate chamber to visualize the Dao,\nPurifying with fasts and cutting off from dust.\nIn the months of the Six Yang,\nThe Six *Qi* are proclaimed in harmony,\nAnd the Celestial Perfected respond.\nOr upon sacred mounds and immortal peaks,\nWith mind serene and intent focused,\nOne may instantly ascend and commune.\nIf dwelling among the common folk,\nSuch resonance is indeed difficult to achieve.\n\nThe Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning,\nThe Most High Lord of the Great Dao,\nThe Most High Lord Lao,\nThe Five Venerable Lords of the Dao,\nThe True Kings of the Four Poles,\nThe Nine Heavenly Thearchs,\nThe Four Heavenly Kings,\nThe Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors,\nThe Ten Flowered Perfected of the Most High,\nThe Lords of the Three Origins—\nThey record and govern the host of sages,\nAll the revered spirits.\nEach month, they guide the Three Lights.\nThe Three Lights open the mysterious,\nThe upright *qi* is proclaimed and circulates,\nThe celestial measures are balanced and just,\nThe Eight Winds are without error.\nThen they command the host of Perfected Immortals and officials\nTo pay homage to the Four Directions’ Lord of the Dao, the Heavenly Worthy,\nWho manifests in response to devotion,\nHis divine radiance blazing,\nTo aid the brightness of the sun and moon.\n\nThose who cultivate this Dao\nShould, in their fasting chambers,\nMorning and evening, visualize and pay reverence,\nHoping for resonance and communion.\n\n**Eastern Eight Heavens’ Lord of the Dao, the Heavenly Worthy:**\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Grand Mystery, Governing All.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Eight Clarities of the Mysterious Subtle.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Direction-Governing, Flowing Radiance.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Three Perfected of the Great Cinnabar.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Yellow Court and Great Monad.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Northern Thearch and Grand August.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Heavenly Might and Luminous *Qi*.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Purple Ultimate and Returning Perfection.\n\n**Southern Eight Heavens’ Lord of the Dao, the Heavenly Worthy:**\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Tortoise Mountain and Five *Qi*.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Round Practice and Treasure Refinement.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Guiding Permeation and Serving the Ultimate.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Thousand Recitations and Returning Dao.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Four Clarities and Following Life.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Cloud Celebration and Cloud Radiance.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Wandering the Mysterious and Upper Capital.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Treasure Measure and Primordial Elder.\n\n**Western Eight Heavens’ Lord of the Dao, the Heavenly Worthy:**\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Grand Balance and Universal Salvation.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Nine *Qi* and True Transformation.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Yellow Elder and Salvation of Life.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Purple Yang and Nurturing Spirit.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Fixed Appearance and Flying Practice.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Lofty Achievement and Heavenly Contemplation.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Flying Yellow and Nine Lights.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Great Dharma and Mysterious Ultimate.\n\n**Northern Eight Heavens’ Lord of the Dao, the Heavenly Worthy:**\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Returning Origin and Three Simplicities.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Six Harmonies and Northern Salvation.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Purple Salvation and Flowing Infancy.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Prosperous Appearance and True *Qi*.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Exhortation and Utmost Receptivity.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Hundred Immortals and Prolonging Truth.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Weaponry and Five *Qi*.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Nine Transformations and Purity and Stillness.\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy governs all the great sages of the myriad kalpas and the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions who respond and transform. They cultivate the *Daoist Retreat* and *Numinous Treasure* guiding and purificatory fasts. During the six yang fast months—namely the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months—at the central hour of the day, one should reverently worship the Heavenly Worthy of the respective direction. Prostrating the head and body to the ground, perform thirty-two bows, scatter flowers, burn incense, pray by day, kindle lamps and meditate in stillness, and at night offer repentance. With wholehearted sincerity and utter devotion, all virtues will be perfected. The supremely true and great spirits shall respond in hidden ways, enabling communion and deliverance for those who study the Dao.\n\nThus concludes the *Supreme Numinous Treasure Scripture of Guiding and Absorbing the Three Luminaries*.",

      "translated_text": "The Dao of the Supreme Perfected is supreme indeed,\nWondrous are the chapters of the Numinous Treasure.\nDrawing in the radiance, one guides the Five Stars,\nSwallowing and inhaling, one visualizes their effulgent rays.\nFlowing essence bathes the hundred bodies,\nLuminous and crystalline as congealed frost and snow.\nThe cavernous illumination shines within and without,\nAll dross and dust utterly vanish.\nThe flesh flourishes, never to age again,\nAttaining this is called *Stabilizing Light*.\nForever feasting in the Palace of Great Clarity,\nThis is the Land of Unending Day.\nGathering one’s traces to return to the root,\nThe Nine Transformations congeal true constancy.\n\nWhen the guidance of *Stabilizing Light* and the recitation of the concord are complete, ingest the three talismans.\n\nAfter ingesting the talismans and bowing to the Perfected,\nGuide the body, swallow *qi*,\nThe Two Radiances merge as one,\nThe Three Lights converge in harmony.\nMy body transcends,\nUniting with the light as one.\nIn response, it returns to being;\nIn stillness, it enters non-being.\nRoaming the Great Void,\nHidden or manifest, boundless.\nThrough this freedom,\nOne becomes the Perfect Person of Natural Spontaneity,\nAlso named the *Stabilizing Light Perfected of the Thirty-Two Heavens of the Primordial Beginning, the Five Venerables, and the Numinous Treasure*.\n\nEver in the company of the Ten Poles’ Great Sages,\nThe Ten Flowered Lofty Perfected,\nThe Four Heavenly Thearchs,\nThe Five Venerable Lords of the Dao,\nAttended by a thousand Perfected and ten thousand spirits,\nAnd the officials of the Three Realms,\nThey wander and rest in the Gates of Cavernous Yang,\nWithin the Terrace of Absolute Contemplation.\nHere lie the Heaven of August Antiquity,\nThe Heaven of Harmonious Yang,\nThe Heaven of Ascending Perfection,\nThe Heaven of Cloud-Crossing—\nEach of the Four Heavens contains thirty-six lands,\nEach land has its lords and ministers, its territories,\nIts people and emperors,\nIts avian Kunlun,\nIts Jasper Capital and Golden Palaces,\nIts Mysterious Metropolis and Five Marchmounts,\nIts divine bureaus of immortals,\nIts great marshes and famed mountains,\nIts Eight Mighty Spirit-Beasts,\nAll creatures that fly and dive, swim and soar,\nScales and shells, feathers and fur,\nHills and forests, all that wriggles and stirs,\nTransformed into the Seven Treasures,\nIlluminating the four directions.\nThe Dharma drums shake the heavens,\nThe numinous sounds harmonize in concert,\nSinging the chapters of the Eight Assemblies of the Most High.\n\nThose newly initiated into learning as Immortals,\nWho gain the privilege to observe and listen,\nAscend the cosmic net and fly through the records,\nFollowing the records, they revolve through the Dipper and enter the Ladle,\nSwallowing the primordial, ingesting essence,\nFusing spirit with the wondrous,\nHands turning the Six Perfections,\nFeet treading the Nine Flowers,\nBody soaring into the void,\nMerging with the radiance as one,\nForever ascending the wondrous Dao,\nPreserved eternally beyond heaven.\n\nThe Heaven of Jade Perfection,\nThe Heaven of Reverent Splendor,\nThe Heaven of August Cliff,\nThe Heaven of Primordial Cavern—\nHere stands the Terrace of Vast Yang and Mysterious Origin,\nWhere the Perfected of the Nine Transformations ascend.\n\nThe Heaven of Harmonious Youth,\nThe Heaven of Ancestral Drift,\nThe Heaven of Ultimate Wind,\nThe Heaven of Wondrous Completion—\nHere stand the Forest of Jade Splendor and the Terrace of Cloud-Soaring,\nWhere the Perfected of Guiding Immortals ascend.\n\nThe Heaven of Level Nurturing,\nThe Heaven of August Reed,\nThe Heaven of Filial Radiance,\nThe Heaven of Forbidden Heights—\nHere stands the Terrace of Mysterious Prosperity and Treasure,\nWhere the Perfected of Cloud Splendor ascend.\n\nThe Heaven of Literary Elevation,\nThe Heaven of Hallowed Radiance,\nThe Heaven of Venerable Weight,\nThe Heaven of Constant Fusion—\nHere stands the Terrace of Returning Yin and Great Perfection,\nWhere the Perfected of Jade Yang ascend.\n\nThe Heaven of Seven Luminaries,\nThe Heaven of Upright Serenity,\nThe Heaven of River Origin,\nThe Heaven of Soaring Victory—\nHere stands the Terrace of Cloud-Formed Numinous Flight,\nWhere the Perfected of Dharma *Qi* ascend.\n\nThe Heaven of Crossing the Scales,\nThe Heaven of Reverent Celebration,\nThe Heaven of Upper Divination,\nThe Heaven of Brahmanic Crossing—\nHere stands the Terrace of Boundless Contemplation,\nWhere the Perfected of Overflowing Essence ascend.\n\nThe Heaven of Concealing Mist,\nThe Heaven of Ultimate Jade,\nThe Heaven of Vow-Swearing,\nThe Heaven of Gambling—\nHere stands the Terrace of Ten Absolutes and Nine Flowers,\nWhere the Perfected of Flowing Essence ascend.\n\nThese eight terraces are where the Perfected of the Three Lights,\nThe Heavenly Kings of the Four Heavens,\nAnd the various Perfected Ones ascend to wander and feast.\nThe celestial texts and jade scriptures,\nCarved in jade characters,\nAre kept within these terraces,\nNamed the *Mandates of the Eight Heavens of the Primordial Beginning*.\n\nThose who guide and lead revere and ingest,\nTransforming their substance and altering their form,\nRefining the body of conditioned existence,\nTo enter the Dao of formlessness.\n\nDuring cultivation,\nOne retreats to a separate chamber to visualize the Dao,\nPurifying with fasts and cutting off from dust.\nIn the months of the Six Yang,\nThe Six *Qi* are proclaimed in harmony,\nAnd the Celestial Perfected respond.\nOr upon sacred mounds and immortal peaks,\nWith mind serene and intent focused,\nOne may instantly ascend and commune.\nIf dwelling among the common folk,\nSuch resonance is indeed difficult to achieve.\n\nThe Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning,\nThe Most High Lord of the Great Dao,\nThe Most High Lord Lao,\nThe Five Venerable Lords of the Dao,\nThe True Kings of the Four Poles,\nThe Nine Heavenly Thearchs,\nThe Four Heavenly Kings,\nThe Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors,\nThe Ten Flowered Perfected of the Most High,\nThe Lords of the Three Origins—\nThey record and govern the host of sages,\nAll the revered spirits.\nEach month, they guide the Three Lights.\nThe Three Lights open the mysterious,\nThe upright *qi* is proclaimed and circulates,\nThe celestial measures are balanced and just,\nThe Eight Winds are without error.\nThen they command the host of Perfected Immortals and officials\nTo pay homage to the Four Directions’ Lord of the Dao, the Heavenly Worthy,\nWho manifests in response to devotion,\nHis divine radiance blazing,\nTo aid the brightness of the sun and moon.\n\nThose who cultivate this Dao\nShould, in their fasting chambers,\nMorning and evening, visualize and pay reverence,\nHoping for resonance and communion.\n\n**Eastern Eight Heavens’ Lord of the Dao, the Heavenly Worthy:**\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Grand Mystery, Governing All.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Eight Clarities of the Mysterious Subtle.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Direction-Governing, Flowing Radiance.\nThe
