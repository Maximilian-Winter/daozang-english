The original table of contents was incomplete; the titles from the main text have been supplemented.\n\n**The Presentation of the *Jìn Yù Zhǐzǐ* (進鬻子表) –** Your humble subject, Xíng Guī, speaks:\n\nI have heard that before the invention of knotted cords, records were sparse and indistinct;\nWhen writing first emerged, its teachings and principles arose.\nThe establishment of historians to record speech gave rise to the traces of praise and blame;\nThe appointment of officials to document affairs opened the door to admonition and exhortation.\nThus, the state’s inscriptions multiplied, their edicts and instructions became clear,\nAnd the Dao of chanting and elucidating was expanded, while the principles of explanation were made manifest.\nVirtue and deeds grew ever more refined, brilliance and wisdom renewed daily,\nAs character was polished and its luminous essence was roused.\n\nWhen the **Dao-Symbols** (道符) of **Zhōu Wén** (周文) became the **#1 Saint** (聖),\nAnd **Yù Zhǐzǐ** (鬻子) was hailed as an **exemplary sage** (稱賢),\nTheir intentions aligned with the **Dao/Way** (道), their substance harmonized,\nThey truly **#2 fulfilled the role of the Master** (實#2申師傅).\n**Yù Zhǐzǐ** (鬻子), upon **Wén Wáng’s** (文王) descent to him,\nGreatly opened his heart and mind,\nIlluminated the methods of promulgating governance,\nAnd broadly established strategies of support and completion,\nEnabling the myriad affairs of state to be contemplated,\nAnd ensuring the prosperity of an entire age.\nHe revered antiquity with sincerity,\nAnd revealed truths to sharpen perception and understanding.\n\nExamining his recorded doctrines and exploring his admonishing words,\nOne finds that he **rooted his teachings in the Dao/Way** (原道心以裁章),\nAnd **delved into the divine principles** (研神理) to awaken and nourish.\nHe **wove together** (弥纶) the **ancestral instructions** (彝训),\nAnd **structured the world with his teachings** (经纬区中),\nNot merely praising and explaining subtle truths,\nBut earnestly **passing down his legacy** (务於遗翰) for future generations.\n\nThe **Zhāi Xióng** (斋熊) was the first among the **Master’s disciples** (诸子之首),\nAnd **Wén Wáng** (文王) was the **founder of saintly virtue** (聖德之宗).\nSince **Xióng** (熊) was **Wén Wáng’s** (文王) teacher,\nAnd the **Book** (书) is the **embodiment of governance and instruction** (政教之体),\nThough its chapters may be fragmentary and incomplete,\nIts **essential framework and principles remain intact** (提举犹备纪纲),\nLike a **vessel of jade** (譬彼盘盂),\nIts **exposition surpasses the original** (发扬有愈).\n\nMy family has long been devoted to **Confucian learning** (传儒素),\nWith deep-rooted habits of loyalty and integrity.\nSeeing the **traces of a sage ruler revering his teacher** (明主奉师之踪),\nAnd observing the **path of the worthy fulfilling their duty** (贤者尽义之道),\nI have **followed and investigated** (循环征究),\nAnd **penetrated the profound mysteries** (妙极机神).\n\nThough I am the most humble and foolish of scholars,\nI dare to compose **annotations and elucidations** (注解),\nTo **delve deeply and analyze principles** (研覃析理),\nAnd **express my personal reverence** (以叔私情),\nTo **trim away superfluous words** (剪截浮辞),\nAnd **reiterate the teachings of the blind and deaf** (用申狂瞽).\n\nI humbly pray that Your Majesty,\n**Follows Heaven’s model and issues sage instructions** (則天垂训),\n**Surpasses the extremes and spreads the imperial winds** (越极宣风),\n**Reveres the supreme harmony of the Ancestor** (稽太上之至和),\nAnd **awakens the bright admonitions of the sovereign** (興帝王之炯诫).\nMay your **ministers and advisors be trustworthy** (股肱谅直),\nAnd your **counselors’ doubts be resolved** (献替元疑).\nMay you **promote the worthy and the good** (大举贤良),\nAnd **bring peace and stability to the realm** (宁济区宇).\nMay the **four seas transform their faces** (四海革面),\nAnd the **eight directions cultivate their hearts** (八表宅心).\nMay you **prioritize the fundamentals and refine culture** (务本修文),\nAnd **govern with ease, achieving harmony without strife** (垂拱无事).\n\nThough I am of lowly birth and humble station,\nWith **limited understanding and shallow insight** (识度庸浅),\nI have **received the blessings of Yáo and Shùn** (荷尧沐舜),\nAnd **sang the songs of the laborers** (击壤枢歌).\nThe **Zhōu** (周) **first implemented governance and instruction** (施政教之端),\nAnd I, **listening to the harmonious melodies of the Age of Great Peace** (属听太平之咏),\n**Aspire to compile and record** (志存缀辑),\nTo **transcribe the Master’s words** (以述矢言).\n\nThe **scrolls are vast, and my words are crude** (简牍难周，辞意斯拙),\nYet I have **carefully copied and presented this work** (谨以缮写),\nTo **offer at Your imperial court** (奉献阙庭).\nMay the **sun and moon’s light shine ever brighter** (庶日月昭明),\nAnd **illuminate even the smallest gaps** (布余晖於漏隙).\nMay the **timely rains fall abundantly** (时雨咸洎),\nAnd **moisten even the driest of twigs** (洒余润於纤枯).\n\nI **hope only to contribute a humble grain of dust** (望希尘露之资),\nHow dare I **speak of steering a sunken vessel** (岂议沉舟之楫)?\nYour **divine authority is near** (天威咫尺),\nAnd my **spirit trembles in awe** (神魄震惊).\n\nI **respectfully submit this presentation** (谨上表以闻),\nAnd **await Your gracious response** (伏听慈旨).\nI **speak thus with humility** (谨言).\n\n**Translation:**\n\nIn the fourth year of the Yonghui era (永徽四年), on the twenty-sixth day of the eleventh month, the humble county magistrate of Huazhou, Zheng County, Adoring Servant Feng Xinggui, respectfully submits this preface.\n\n**Note on Transmission:**\nThe character *\"zuò\"* (作) follows the *Siku Quanshu* (四库) edition.\nThe character *\"shí\"* (实) corrects the original *\"huáng\"* (皇) based on the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\nThe character *\"guī\"* (珪) corrects the original *\"guī\"* (圭).\n\n**Preface by the Master’s Disciple:**\n\nThe Master’s name was Xuzi (鬻子), surnamed Xiong (熊), a native of Chu. He was the teacher of King Wen of Zhou.\n\nAt ninety years of age, he was seen by King Wen, who said: *\"You are old.\"* Xuzi replied:\n*\"If I were to hunt beasts and chase deer, I would indeed be old.\nBut if I were to sit and deliberate on state affairs, I am still young.\"*\n\nThus, King Wen took him as his teacher.\n\nHe composed twenty-two treatises, titled *The Book of Xuzi* (《鬻子》).\n*\"Zi\"* (子) is an honorific for a virtuous man.\nThough his wisdom did not match the Sage, his works were not canonized as scripture—\ninstead, they were titled to mark his lineage.\n\n**On the Daoist Tradition:**\nFollowing Liu Xi’s *Nine Schools*, this belongs to the Daoist lineage.\n\nDuring the Qin’s violent chaos, most records were lost.\nThough *The Book of Xuzi* was not burned, its compilation was disrupted, leaving it fragmented.\nAccording to the *Han Book of Arts and Literature* (《汉书·艺文志》), only six chapters remained—\nyet this edition contains fourteen, and it is unclear which is correct.\n\nSome chapters are disordered, with many lacunae.\nYet even in its incomplete form, its teachings on the Great Dao,\nits compilation of clear histories,\nits elucidation of the realm’s moral cultivation,\nand its discourse on the right and wrong of virtue and punishment—\nthough the scrolls are not whole, their essence is discernible.\nLike branches of the Deng Forest, jade from Jing Mountain, or the remnants of a noble’s writings,\nthey are still worthy of examination.\n\nXuzi was well-versed in virtue and Dao, skilled in governance.\nThus, he made the Great Sage King Wen humble in deference,\nand the Sage sought his counsel.\n\nHis words embody the Way of the Sovereign,\nhis arguments emphasize urgent warnings,\nhis reasoning extends far,\nhis intent is vast and profound—\ntruly the profound words of a master,\nthe first among the Hundred Schools.\n\nHe wove the threads of benevolence and righteousness,\nstructured the governance of the realm,\npromoted sincere admonition,\nand expounded on methods of grand salvation.\nFor rulers, reading it can bring order to the state;\nfor officials, following it can guide administration.\nIt is enough to inspire the virtuous and purify the unworthy.\n\nThe *Analects* say:\n*\"The Three Hundred Poems—what unifies them?\nIt is the thought of no deceit.\"*\n\nWords that endure are like tortoiseshell and mirrors.\nIs not *The Book of Xuzi*’s discourse on the Dao the embodiment of this principle?\n\nFortunately, in moments of leisure,\nI have browsed through the histories of masters and disciples.\nYet the volumes are vast,\nand I cannot examine them thoroughly.\n\nThis master, unlike others,\nhas earnestly devoted himself to tracing the origins of his teachings,\nand probing the essence of his exposition.\nHe does not indulge in fanciful parables or empty rhetoric,\nnor does he chase after fleeting sophistry and lofty debate.\nRather, his words weigh as much as a thousand gold pieces,\nand his phrases endure as long as ten thousand years.\n\nI shall briefly annotate and outline his intent,\nmy thoughts soaring above the ages,\nmy heart resting beneath the centuries,\nhoping to perpetuate the Dao and reveal his will,\nhanging it like the sun and moon for all time.\nMay future worthies not overlook this.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on the Five Emperors and Three Kings’ Administration**\n*(From *Xuzi* Scroll One, Annotated by Adjutant Adoring the Way, Zheng Xian of Huazhou)*\n\n**On the Selection of Officials (Section Five)**\n\n*\"To compose\"* (撰) is also *\"to gather\"* (具).\nOfficials are the instruments of governance.\nAgain, *\"to compose\"* (撰) means *\"to seek widely\"* (博),\nfor when the ruler issues decrees and implements policies,\nit is through the wide search for worthy officials.\nThe worthy are promoted; the unworthy are excluded—\nthus the political Dao of the Five Emperors and Three Kings\ncan be passed down through the ages.\n\n*\"Bu\"* (乙) follows *\"Jia\"* (甲),\ndemonstrating the order of governance.\n\nGovernance (政) is law and instruction.\nHere, the imperial and royal affairs are presented\nas worthy of emulation.\n\nThe worthy sage does not conspire with others—\nfor the sage cultivates within and governs without,\nrectifying his form and aligning his shadow,\nembodying the essence of true virtue,\npreserving the subtle mystery of the uncarved block.\nWhen his words issue, they become doctrine;\nwhen he acts, they become law.\nIf he does not involve himself in governance,\nhow could he act recklessly?\nThis is how he brings order.\n\nIf one conspires with others, then there is no way to avoid the Dao.\n\nThe worthy sage does not conspire with others—then it is enough.\nIf he does conspire, he must uphold the Great Dao in his words,\nnot disguising error to evade the Dao,\nnor seeking expedience to achieve correctness.\n\n*\"You\"* (由) means *\"use.\"*\nThus, the worthy sage’s counsel must necessarily employ the Dao.\nThe worthy sage speaks all day yet never strays from its essence,\nand in governing affairs, his actions resonate with the Dao.\n\nThus, those who align with the Dao will find the Dao in return;\nspeech that deviates from the Dao, the worthy sage does not employ.\nYet he cannot guarantee acceptance—\nthe multitude’s gaze lingers on deceit, not truth;\ntheir hearts dazzle at reputation, unable to discern reality.\nThe mediocre ruler, bewildered by the crowd,\nhow could he receive the Dao’s teachings?\n\nThus, the worthy sage’s Dao is not readily embraced.\nHe can be utterly loyal,\nexhausting his heart in discussing the Dao and exhausting his loyalty to it.\nHis words are not devious.\nYet he cannot guarantee entrance—\nexhausting loyalty in discussing the Dao,\nthe sage ruler accepts it, but the mediocre ruler finds it difficult.\nThus, the ruler who embodies the Dao\nbrings harmony between ruler and subjects,\nadvances the worthy and employs the wise,\nand shields with vigilance without concealment.\nTo cast a stone into water—how could there be discord?\n\nYet the ruler who lacks clarity\nsees estrangement between ruler and minister,\nhas petty men at his side,\nabandons the upright and virtuous,\nfavors flatterers and sycophants,\nignores loyalty and sincerity,\nand closes his eyes to truth—\nhow could he not be confused?\nHe rejects loyal speech.\n\nHe can be utterly trustworthy—\nthe worthy sage does not falsely concur,\ndoes not speak recklessly,\nmaintains upright demeanor and sincere words,\nclarifies truth and reality,\nand must preserve this in sincerity.\nYet he cannot guarantee belief—\ntruthful words may not be pleasing yet align with the Dao.\nThe mediocre ruler, bewildered by the crowd’s deceit,\nhow could he trust the worthy sage’s words?\nHis words are not trusted.\n\nThe worthy sage, not a mere person,\ndoes not express himself in speech alone,\nbut manifests in action.\nThe worthy sage merely does good,\nusing it to assail evil—\ngood does not claim self-righteousness,\nevil is not condemned in others;\nhis actions, not his words, reveal this.\nThus, the one who does not condemn others does what is right,\nand condemns others only in speech—\nthis is what all agree upon.\nThe one condemned by others will also condemn them.\nThe worthy sage, when condemning others,\nnever condemns them for condemning others;\nhe practices the Dao himself\nand uses it to judge their error.\n\nThe one who abhors evil does good—\nevil and good reside within oneself,\nthis is what all share.\nThe worthy sage strives for good to assail evil,\nnot abhorring evil in others,\nthus making evil manifest through the Dao of goodness.\nYet the Dao is now revealed.\n\nIn counsel, he is utterly loyal;\nin speech, utterly trustworthy;\nin action, he does good to assail evil,\nmakes the right clear and the wrong evident,\nand does not seek knowledge frivolously—\nfor virtue and the Dao naturally illuminate.\n\n**The Great Dao: The Eighth Question of King Wen**\nThe Dao—\nit covers heaven and earth,\nencompasses the four directions,\nreaches the eight extremes,\nsoars without bounds,\nplunges beyond measure,\nspans the six convergences,\nstretches across the four quarters—\nit cannot be exhausted by words or symbols,\ncannot be pointed out or explained.\nIt responds to all unasked questions,\nmarks the end of governance and instruction,\nembraces all forms of existence,\nshines beyond the three luminaries,\nacts yet does not possess,\nmoves yet remains unseen.\n\nThe ruler who embodies the Dao,\nin all his actions, aligns with it—\nhis wondrous applications are boundless,\nthus it is called the Great.\n\nKing Wen, following its boundless applications,\nis thus called the Great Teacher questioning the Dao,\nto establish an enduring model,\nand thus the chapter is named.\n\n**Governance:**\nIn days past, King Wen asked the Master Yuzi:\n*\"In days past\"* refers to antiquity.\nThough he ruled over countless subjects without sole authority,\nhe followed the Teacher to seek the Dao’s gate to governance.\n\n*\"Dare I ask—does a man have great forgetfulness?\"*\nHe revered the Teacher’s path, hence *\"dare I ask.\"*\nKing Wen sought to preserve the Great Dao for governance,\nhis thoughts rooted in enduring principles,\nthus he first asked about great forgetfulness.\n\nThe Master replied: *\"There is.\"*\n\nYuzi’s initial answer to King Wen—\nthere is great forgetfulness.\n\nKing Wen said: *\"Dare I ask—what is great forgetfulness?\"*\nYuzi did not immediately answer directly,\nthus King Wen prompted him further.\nKing Wen wished to clarify the principle of his ultimate aspiration,\nhence *\"what is the matter with it?\"*\n\nYuzi said:\n*\"To know one’s own evil yet not amend it,\nthus harming oneself,\nand losing one’s body.\nWhen wrong occurs, do not fear to change—\nall day long, do not commit evil.\nEvil departs from oneself—\nis it merely blackening the face and shaving the head\nto leave behind a corpse’s remnant?\nThus, Chi You was executed,\nthe Four Deceivers were slaughtered,\nXu the Cruel was cut off from sacrifice,\nand Tang the Tyrant’s lineage was overthrown.\nTo harm oneself and destroy one’s body,\nto ruin one’s family and lose one’s state—\nsuch is their conduct,\nthis is called great forgetfulness.\nThis is what their conduct was—\nthus it is called great forgetfulness.\nThe conclusion of his answer.*\n\n**The Fifth Chapter: The Five Emperors and Three Kings Honor the Dao in Governance**\nTo govern with virtue,\none must hold the Dao in highest regard,\nfor it is the blessing that transforms the nation.\n\nAt the time of King Wen,\nthe Three Kings were collectively referred to—\nfrom the near to the distant,\nto illustrate the Dao’s unity.\n\n*\"Zhou\"* means *\"comprehensive\"* and *\"complete,\"*\nspeaking of the Five Emperors and Three Kings honoring the Dao,\ntheir governance unified as one,\nand nothing was left unattended.\n\nThe ancient emperors and kings—\n*\"In days past\"* refers to those ancient rulers who honored virtue and the Dao.\nBy invoking antiquity to admonish the present,\nthey serve as a warning.\n\nWhat made them enlightened?\nIt was because of their officials.\nThe emperors and kings who were called enlightened\nall entrusted worthy officials,\nplacing them in prominent positions,\nthus the Dao’s transformation flourished\nand all nations found peace—\nenlightenment was not achieved alone.\n\nThe ancient worthy sages,\nwhat made them successful?\nIt was because of their people.\nPeople are the foundation of the state—\ngain their support, and prosperity follows.\nEstablish the principles and seize the moment,\nrelying on the myriad subjects;\nall contribute their strength\nto accomplish their deeds.\n\nStrength arises from spirit—\nthe ruler, having a state,\nfirst seeks divine favor;\n\nThe August Heavenly Sovereign and Earthly Deities,\nthe ancestral altars and mountain rivers—\ntheir divine manifestations and mysterious omens\nall converge without fail.\n\nKing Tang received divine mandate,\naccepting the Great Destiny of Xia;\nKing Wu dreamed of the gods,\nthus achieving the great pacification of Yin.\n\nThe interplay of yin and yang in darkness,\nstirring all things—\nhow could this be their doing alone?\nAll transformations arise from the natural interplay of mysterious correspondences,\nand their purpose is not of human making—\nprinciples align spontaneously.\nThus it is said: *\"Strength arises from spirit.\"*\n\nYet the greatest achievements belong to officials.\nThe sovereign measures governance and issues decrees\nbut does not act alone—\nhe entrusts worthy and capable men\nto execute his will,\nso the realm attains peace,\nand the people know what to uphold.\nThis is the merit of virtuous officials and their exemplary conduct.\n\nBlessings return to the ruler.\nWhen officials embody noble virtue,\nthey dedicate their hearts and strength,\nthe people uphold the Dao,\nand customs conform to its teachings.\nSuperior and inferior unite in harmony,\nand virtue reciprocally flows.\nThus the land prospers in tranquility—\nthis is the ruler’s blessing.\n\nIn ancient times, the Five Sovereigns governed the world.\nThe Five Sovereigns were: the Yellow Emperor, Zhuanxu, Gaoxin,\nTang, and Yu.\nTheir Way shone brightly,\nlike the clarity of sun and moon,\nas if day had replaced night.\nThe sun and moon move in radiance,\nilluminating without favor,\nreaching both hidden and revealed,\nunceasing from beginning to end—\nthus their brilliance never falters.\n\nThe Sage aligns with Heaven and Earth in virtue,\nharmonizing with sun and moon in clarity—\ntheir Way is vast and unwaning,\nworthy of reverence and emulation.\nThus their Way endures eternally,\nbringing blessings and teachings to ten thousand generations—\nonly from the Yellow Emperor onward,\nand from Shun and Yu upward,\ndoes this hold true.\n*\"Chief\"* means *\"origin\"*—\nthe Five Sovereigns’ Way is always the beginning for all ages,\nnone surpassing it.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor first introduced garments,\ncreated writing and records,\nestablished historiographers,\ncrafted boats and vessels to traverse impassable waters,\ntamed oxen and rode horses,\nerected halls and fortified gates,\nset up night patrols to guard against bandits,\ninvented pestles and mortars for the people’s benefit,\nforged bows and arrows to awe the world,\nestablished musical pitch-pipes,\nand instituted mountain-altar sacrifices.\n\nZhuanxu pacified the chaos of the Nine Li tribes,\nseparating humanity from spirits,\nrestoring order to all things.\n\nThe Gaoxin clan created the *jūzhuán* (whirligig),\nbells and drums,\nand rush mats.\n\nEmperor Yao lived in thatched huts without trimming,\nwith a three-foot earthen platform,\nwearing hemp garments in summer,\ndeer-fur robes in winter—\nhis virtue was vast, beyond naming,\nhis achievements towering and enduring.\n\nEmperor Shun, even as a youth, was supremely filial.\nWhen Yao heard of his wisdom, he appointed him.\nShun then selected:\nYú as Minister of Works to regulate waters,\nJi as the Patriarch of Agriculture to sow grains,\nZī as Minister of Education to instruct the people,\nGāoyáo as Judge to arbitrate disputes,\nSuì as Overseer of Labor to supervise public works,\nYì to cultivate plants,\nBòyí to preside over rituals,\nand Qú to harmonize music and spirits.\n\nShun played the five-stringed *qin* and sang *\"The South Wind\"* ode.\n\nGreat Yu endured wind and rain without respite,\nhis hat and shoes forgotten,\nhe surveyed the nine regions,\ninspected the four directions,\ndug through the Dragon Gate,\ncleared the Yi Pass,\ndiverted the hundred rivers,\nand established the myriad states.\nHad it not been for Yu’s labors,\nall would have drowned like fish.\n\nNo ruler’s deeds surpass these—\nthus their blessings and teachings endure through the ages.\nIf a ruler wishes to perpetuate the Five Sovereigns’ Way without loss,\nhe may endure forever.\nIt means the ruler follows the Five Sovereigns’ Way consistently,\nnever abandoning it,\nthus preserving the ancestral temples and ancestral altars,\nand becoming the origin for the people.\n\n**Guard the Dao of the Five Sovereigns and Three Kings—Chapter Four of Zhou Politics**\n*\"Hold fast to the Great Symbols, and the world will follow.\nClarity in the Way means the world will not stray—\nthe Way must never be abandoned.\"*\n\nWhen the Sage rules above,\neven one virtuous scholar in a hundred *li* is rare.\nThough the enlightened monarch’s influence spreads,\nhis virtue permeates all things,\nyet even one scholar in a hundred *li* is scarcely seen—\nhow much more so if their traces are unseen?\nThough many may be virtuous, they are as nonexistent.\n\nWhen the Way declines and tyranny prevails,\neven one scholar in a thousand *li* is like standing shoulder-to-shoulder.\nWhen the Way decays and brutal chaos reigns,\nall long for virtue—\neven one scholar in a thousand *li* is as common as neighbors.\nIt means virtuous men are nowhere to be found.\n\n**Compiling the Biographies of Officials—Chapter Three of the Transmission of Politics**\nThe sovereign’s means to stabilize the state,\nto govern and teach,\nlies in virtuous officials.\n*\"One must seek broadly to obtain them.\"*\n\nThus it is said:\nThe people are the staff of both the worthy and unworthy—\nboth exist within them.\nThe worthy bear the name of virtue;\nthe unworthy are the reckless and defiant.\nWorthiness and unworthiness manifest in conduct—\nthese two, though sharing the same origin,\ndiffer in name,\nyet both depend on the most refined selection,\neach with their fixed destiny.\n\nThe breadth of the world,\nthe multitude of the people—\nworthy and unworthy are both present.\nThus the worthy are chosen,\nwhile the unworthy are set aside.\nIt means the worthy do not seek advancement alone,\nbut are needed by the times—\nthe ruler must employ them,\nand thus they are chosen.\nThe unworthy do not seek exile alone,\ntheir actions merit no recognition,\nand they are excluded from governance—\nthus they are discarded.\n\n*\"Staff of ability\"*—\nthose with surpassing intelligence\nyet pride in their talents;\nrelying on ability and intelligence\ninevitably defies the natural order.\nLightness and haste lead to perilous deviation—\nthus it is said: *\"Staff of ability.\"*\n\n*\"Loyalty and trust adorn them.\"*\nThey embody the resolve of loyalty,\nmust cultivate the Dao,\nprioritize sincerity in conduct,\nand adhere to truth.\nRitual, righteousness, benevolence, and trust\nrefine their character—\nthus it is said: *\"Loyalty and trust adorn them.\"*\n\nThe people are a mass of ignorance.\nOblivious and unknowing—\nthis is folly.\nThough they are ignorant,\nan enlightened ruler selects officials\nto inspire them.\nIt means the ruler extends his heart to the people,\nseeking virtuous officials\nand not ruling alone.\n\nThe **scholar-officials** and the people approve of them,\nand the enlightened ruler promotes them.\nWhen they gain the support of the common heart,\nexcel in governance and administration,\nthis is how the ruler selects and employs them.\n\nIf the **scholar-officials** and the people disapprove of them,\nthe enlightened ruler dismisses them.\nIf they are like the common people—\nbetween the wise and the foolish,\ntheir governance does not align with the people—\nthis is why they are rejected and removed.\n\nThus, the **Sage-King** (*王者*) selects officials without forgetting,\nand must ensure the people respond before harmonizing.\nThe ruler gathers all counsel to observe the masses,\ndiscerns the bright to probe the **wind-sound** (*风声*),\nscrutinizes the words of the lowly to seek their gains and losses,\nand takes virtuous officials to propagate governance and transformation.\n\nTo extend oneself and take the virtuous—\nonly the **Sage** can do this.\n\nThe people are the standard for officials.\nThe standard is the **law and model** (*法式*).\nKnowing them from below,\nthis is why the **law and model** for selecting officials\nis examined among the common folk—\nwhether they are approved or not.\n\nTo examine officials among the people,\nthen to follow accordingly.\nIf the people approve of them,\nthe ruler promotes them;\nif the people disapprove of them,\nthe ruler dismisses them.\nThis is the principle of **following** (*随*).\n\nGovernance states:\nThe people are the most lowly,\nthe utmost of lowliness.\nYet to let them select officials,\none must choose those they love.\nThe **Sage-Ruler** does not defy the people’s will by employing them alone.\n\nThus, if ten thousand love them,\nthen they are officials of ten thousand;\nif a hundred thousand love them,\nthen they are officials of a hundred thousand;\nif a thousand thousand love them,\nthen they are officials of a thousand thousand;\nif ten thousand thousand love them,\nthen they are officials of ten thousand thousand.\nFrom here onward,\nall speak of the people’s affections and their virtuous conduct,\neach having their own beloved and cherished ones,\nwith varying degrees of preference.\nThus, officials of ten thousand

grand viziers** are the foundation of feudal lords.\nThe rise or fall of governance\ndepends on **ministers and grand viziers**.\nIf the virtuous are obtained, harmony and unity prevail;\nif the

It is named thus to honor Duke Zhou’s contributions to governance and ritual propriety.\n\nDuke Zhou said:\n*\"I have heard this from the Way of Governance—*\n*I cite Duke Zhou’s words to illuminate governance.*\n\n*To know virtue yet fail to act is called madness.*\n*Virtue is the embodiment of the Dao, the cultivation of power.*\n\n*When the sovereign acts virtuously above,*\n*The people respond in virtue below—*\n*Thus did Yáo’s reign see households worthy of ennoblement.*\n\n*To know the Dao’s virtue yet refuse to employ it*\n*Is the mark of a mad and rebellious man.*\n\n*To know vice yet fail to amend is called delusion.*\n*Vice is the thief that destroys the body.*\n\n*When the sovereign acts in vice above,*\n*The people follow in vice below, unrepentant—*\n*This is the state of confusion and delusion.*\n\n*Madness and delusion—*\n*These are the warnings of the Sage-Kings.*\n\n*To know virtue yet not act,*\n*To know vice yet not amend,*\n*Is to court the extremes of madness and delusion.*\n\n*This is the clear admonition of the Sage-Kings.\"*\n\n**\"The Dao-Symbol of the Five Sovereigns and Three Kings: Chapter *Jia* (Second)**\n\nTo found a dynasty and establish its roots,\nOne must first align with the Dao.\nWhen the Dao is harmonized,\nIt stands unshaken in all things.\nInfluence and response resonate in kind—\nNaturally attuned and responsive.\n\n*Jia* comes before *Yǐ*—\nThe unworthy are those who lack self-awareness.\nTo be unworthy means to lack resemblance.\nResemblance is likeness—\nTo speak of what does not conform is to lack likeness.\nTo know one’s own worth or unworthiness\nIs to possess clarity.\nOne who lacks likeness—\nHow could they claim it themselves?\nThis is to say they do not know.\n\nYet unworthiness reveals itself in action.\nDanzhu was arrogant and cruel,\nDay and night without respite;\nHis wickedness was unrestrained,\nNever ceasing.\nThis is what is manifest in outward conduct,\nNot hidden or subtle.\n\nThough he claimed to be virtuous,\nHe was still called unworthy.\nWould the unworthy truly claim unworthiness?\nWhen viewed by the worthy,\nThe path of unworthiness becomes clear.\nThough he may be deemed worthy by others,\nOr deem himself worthy—\nWould others truly regard him as such?\n\nThe foolish do not claim their own foolishness,\nYet their folly is evident in their words.\nThose who obscure the Dao and lack virtue—\nWould they openly confess their ignorance?\nYet their foolishness is revealed in their speech and reasoning.\nThough they may call themselves wise,\nThey are still called foolish.\nWould the foolish truly consider themselves foolish?\nWhen viewed by the wise,\nThe traces of folly become apparent.\nThough others may deem them wise,\nOr they deem themselves wise—\nWould others truly regard them as such?\n\n**The Seventh Record of the Five Sovereigns’ Governance**\nTo speak of the Sovereigns is to mark the beginning of their reigns,\nRecording the years of their ascension and succession.\nThe governance of the world—\nHow could it be recklessly administered?\nIt is through the accumulation of virtue and deeds that it is attained.\nThus, the Dao of the Five Sovereigns was passed down in governance,\nAnd they are collectively referred to as such.\n\nIn ancient times, Emperor Zhuanxu—\nHis mother, the Yellow Emperor’s consort, Lady Leizu,\nBore Changyi.\nChangyi begot Zhuanxu,\nWho became the leader of the Gaoyang clan,\nReigning for seventy-eight years.\nAt fifteen, he assisted the Yellow Emperor,\nOf the Xuanyuan clan,\nThe second son of Shaodian,\nHis father named Emperor Hongshi,\nHis mother named Fushi.\nShe beheld a great lightning flash encircling the Northern Dipper’s pivot star,\nIlluminating the wilderness,\nAnd conceived—\nGiving birth after twenty-five months.\nHe ruled with the virtue of Earth,\nThus called the Yellow Emperor,\nReigning for a hundred years.\nZhuanxu, from his youth,\nAssisted the Yellow Emperor with his wings.\nAt twenty, he governed the world.\nAscending as the Son of Heaven,\nHis governance of the world\nFollowed and upheld the Yellow Emperor’s Dao,\nAdhering to and refining the Yellow Emperor’s methods,\nWithout alteration.\nHe learned the Yellow Emperor’s Dao and made it constant.\nThough his influence did not fully reach others,\nThis was how he emulated it.\nHe followed the Yellow Emperor’s comprehensive Dao,\nApplying it consistently.\n\nThe ancient Emperor Yu,\nBorn of the Yellow Emperor’s consort, Xuanxiao,\nXuanxiao’s son—Emperor Yu—\nHis virtue ever renewed,\nThus called Gao Xin,\nReigned for seventy years.\nAt fifteen, he assisted Emperor Zhuanxu,\nAt thirty, he governed the world.\nHe aided Zhuanxu in ordering the world,\nAnd at thirty ascended as Emperor.\nIn his governance of the world,\nHe upheld and illuminated the Yellow Emperor’s Dao,\nYet his virtue was slightly lesser,\nUnable to fully enact the Yellow Emperor’s Dao—\nOnly illuminating it was all.\nHe learned Emperor Zhuanxu’s Dao and practiced it.\nHis governance and teachings\nEmulated Zhuanxu’s ways.\nYet his words could not be constantly upheld.\n\n**Yu’s Governance (Sixth in Sequence)**\nYu, the Summer Patriarch,\nHis merit bestowed with the dark jade,\nHis virtue harmonizing with the Primordial Beginning,\nHe entrusted the worthy and established governance,\nAchieving great peace as a model to follow.\nThus, the chapter is named after him.\n\nYu’s rule over the world:\nA great-grandson of the Yellow Emperor,\nDescendant of Zhuanxu,\nSurname Si, named Wencheng,\nCalled Gaomi,\nReigned for nine years,\nReceived the Mandate of Heaven through success,\nThus called Yu.\nHe ascended after Shun’s abdication to rule the world.\n\nHe obtained Gao Yao,\nDuzi Ye,\nJi Zi,\nShi Zi Yan,\nJi Zi Ning,\nRan Zi Kan,\nQing Zi Yu—\nThese seven ministers’ names.\nHe gained seven ministers to assist his rule,\nTo govern the world,\nAnd thus the world was governed.\nIt is said that though an emperor alone rules the world,\nEven with sage virtue,\nHe must await worthy ministers to aid him—\nThus the people are at ease.\n\n**Shang Governance (Seventh in Sequence, to the End of Zhou)**\nIt is said that Tang overthrew the wicked Jie,\nTo govern the myriad affairs and order the world,\nWith worthy ministers aiding him to achieve great peace,\nUntil Zhou’s folly led to the loss of the realm—\nThus, the beginning and end are recorded to name the chapter.\n\nTang’s rule over the world:\nSurname Zi, named Li,\nCalled Tianyi.\nHe abolished cruelty and removed tyranny—thus called Tang.\nHe campaigned against Ge Bo,\nExiled Jie,\nAnd took the world in order.\nHe obtained Qing Jiu,\nYi Yin,\nHuang Li Qi,\nDongmen Xu,\nNanmen Ru,\nXimen Ci,\nBeimen Ce.\nYi Yin was a concubine’s attendant from Youxinshi, made his chancellor.\nDongmen and the others—all their names.\nHe gained seven ministers to govern the world,\nAnd thus the world was governed.\nThe seven ministers all had virtuous conduct,\nExposing faults and aiding in harmony—\nThus the people were all content.\n\nTwenty-seven generations,\nFrom Tang to Zhou,\nFather to son, brother to brother, twenty-seven reigns.\nAccumulating years, five hundred seventy-six years to Zhou.\nFor Summer, \"year\" excludes the first year of accession.\n\n**Yu’s Governance (Sixth, Revisited)**\nWith five tones to govern,\nDiligent in the realm,\nWorthy of being supreme.\nYu’s rule over the world used five tones.\nNinefold depths of obscurity,\nBelow, difficult to approach,\nYet matters the people wished to report were repelled—\nThus, he hung the five tones to summon them for governance.\n\nAt the gate, he hung the bell, drum, small bell, stone chime,\nHung on the *gōng* stand.\nAnd placed the *táo* drum,\nPlaced on the ground.\nTo attract scholars from the four seas.\nWhen scholars from the four seas came with words,\nThey struck the five tones to transmit their voices.\nHe inscribed on the *gōng* stand:\n*\"Teach me the Dao, strike the drum,\"*\nThe drum moves creatures—\nThus, striking it aligns with the Dao.\n*\"Teach me righteousness, strike the bell,\"*\nThe bell is a metal tone—\nThus, teaching righteousness, strike the bell.\n*\"Teach me affairs, ring the small bell,\"*\nThe small bell, metal chime with wooden tongue—\nThus, when matters require action, ring the small bell.\n*\"Speak to me of worries, strike the stone chime,\"*\nWorries, a sorrowful tone.\nThe stone chime’s sound is mournful—\nThus, when worried, strike the stone chime.\n*\"Speak to me of lawsuits, beat the *táo* drum.\"*\nThis is the five tones.\nLawsuits require swift resolution—\nThus, beat the *táo* drum to present them.\nThe above inscriptions were all carved on the *mí* stand.\n\nThus, Yu once sat on a single meal and rose seventy times,\nAt noon, not having time to eat fully,\nSo urgent were his affairs,\nThat he showed his eagerness to receive scholars.\nHe said:\n*\"I still fear scholars from the four seas will linger on the roads.\"*\nHis usual travels were not where he should worry.\nThus, scholars from the four seas all arrived.\nMatters were always aligned with the Dao,\nHarmonizing above and below,\nResponding to gatherings without fail.\nThus, when Yu was in court,\nHe could arrange ranks.\nNot having time to eat fully,\nListening to governance without fatigue,\nThe court was serene and still—\nThen there were no affairs.\n\n**The Dao Aligns with the Five Emperors and Three Kings (Fifth Chapter on Governance)**\nWhen a gentleman enters his office,\nBright as the sun at dawn.\nEntering, radiant—\nPeople preserve their blessings.\nDeparting, dim—\nPeople lose their teachings.\nThis is called attaining the harmonious governance.\n\nA state belongs to ministers, relatives, and worthy men.\nIf there is a state, there are ministers and relatives.\nThe worthy are the ministers and relatives;\nPeople entrust them, the ruler employs them.\nCould the unworthy be employed?\nWith or without a state, the wise govern it.\nA ruler does not himself make peace,\nNor does he himself cause chaos.\nWhat makes peace is the power of wisdom and strategy.\nWisdom is not a single day’s resolve.\nAccumulating merit and achievements,\nPracticing the Dao without weariness,\nTo fulfill his resolve.\nGovernance is not a single day’s plan.\nPlanning is the work of the mind.\nEstablishing virtue as the highest,\nModifying governance and teaching with sincere balance.\nPlanning cannot be achieved in a single day.\nGovernance of resolve and planning\nLies with the emperor—\nThen the people know what to preserve.\n\nThe sovereign above has the Dao,\nAnd its transformation flows below.\nThe distant and near revere virtue,\nThe four borders face no peril,\nThe people are pure and harmonious,\nBandits and thieves cease to stir—\nThus, the people know what to rely on\nAnd what to avoid.\n\nWealth and nobility, poverty and lowliness,\nDo not encroach upon one another.\nRen, virtue, propriety, and wisdom\nProceed from his gate.\nNo defiance of governance and teaching,\nThe common folk are blessed—\nThis is the way to know what to avoid.\n\nTo promulgate teaching and issue commands\nFor the benefit of all under Heaven—\nThis is called the Dao.\nTo precede it with boundless love,\nTo expound it with virtue and righteousness,\nTo precede it with reverence and yielding,\nTo guide it with ritual and music,\nTo neither seize another’s time\nNor obstruct another’s interests—\nThus, calamities and disorders do not arise.\n\nThe Dao of bringing blessings—\nIs this not what is meant?\n\nMutual affinity between the sovereign and people—\nThis is called harmony.\n\nWith supreme virtue, he instructs them;\nWith essential Dao, he governs them.\nWhen sovereign and people share a single heart,\nThis is called harmony.\n\nWhen the people obtain their desires without seeking—\nThis is called trust.\n\nThe sun rises and they labor,\nThe sun sets and they rest,\nNot wearying in their tasks,\nNot burdened by harshness or vexation.\nThey savor their food,\nFind comfort in their dwellings,\nAnd delight in their occupations—\nCould these things be sought from without?\n\nWhen the sovereign above practices the Dao,\nThen his governance may truly be called great trust.\n\nTo remove all harm from under Heaven—\nThis is called ren.\n\nTo embrace love for all things,\nTo extend compassion outward,\nEven as in the case of King Tang’s conquest of Ge Bo,\nOr his banishment of Jie to Nan Chao,\nAnd Yu’s separation of mountains and rivers,\nAnd establishment of states—\nThus, the people are spared from chaos,\nAnd dwell securely in their homes.\n\nIs ren distant?\nThis is its utmost reach.\n\nRen and trust,\nHarmony and Dao—\nThese are the sovereign’s instruments.\nThese four principles,\nThe sovereign’s instruments for ruling under Heaven,\nHe delights in promoting them.\n\nIf one transgresses them,\nThen under Heaven will depart and rebel—\nIt will not belong to him.\n\nAll things have their instruments;\nWhat is used to benefit them,\nThis is what we call their instruments.\nIf one defies their proper use,\nCan one truly claim to wield their instruments?\n\nThus, name and instrument cannot be falsely attributed.\nWhat one cultivates must be done\nWith their proper instruments.\n\nTo obtain their instruments,\nSo that harmony may be achieved;\nIf one does not wield their proper instruments,\nThe benefit is distant—\nHow could it succeed?\n\nSo too for the feudal lords who aspire to kingship—\nThose who do not use the sovereign’s instruments\nCannot succeed.\n\nSpeaking of the vastness of under Heaven\nAnd the weight of the divine instrument,\nIf not the true sovereign,\nIt is difficult to govern it.\nThe sovereign’s *qi* descends,\nAnd then it may be carved and apportioned.\n\nOne must practice ren and trust,\nHarmony and Dao,\nOnly then can one attract and embrace all the people,\nAnd encompass the four quarters.\nThe Western Earl rose to power through reverence and yielding,\nThe Duke of Nanyang obtained governance through the seven Dao—\nWithout the proper person,\nCould these achievements be attained in vain?\n\nThe sovereign’s governance is the seventh principle by which he rules under Heaven.\n\nHeaven and Earth are set and all things are born,\nYin and Yang transform and the four seasons are fixed.\nDistinction and governance are the methods of rule;\nPursued to their beginning and end,\nThey may become laws.\n\nHeaven and Earth are divided and all things are born,\nThe Heavenly *qi* in its stillness is singular and unified,\nIn its movement is upright and straight;\nThe Earthly *qi* in its stillness is gathered and contained,\nIn its movement is expansive and open.\nThus, they produce the vastness of all things.\n\nAll things are born, and then man governs them.\nGovernance is the means to align with Heaven and Earth.\nIt is said that Heaven and Earth cannot command one another,\nCannot restrain one another,\nAnd thus require man to govern them and bring order.\n\nWithout governance,\nAll things would not be orderly.\nHeaven and Earth can give life but cannot refrain from killing—\nIt is said that Heaven and Earth can give life but cannot refrain from killing.\nOnly what Heaven and Earth kill,\nMan cannot give life to.\nHeaven’s power to give life,\nOnly Heaven’s power to kill is possible.\nIf only Heaven kills,\nCould man give life?\nThis is what cannot be given life.\n\nWhen man transforms and becomes virtuous,\nAmong all things, man is the most noble.\nTo transform and become virtuous,\nThis is the natural order of Heaven.\n\nWhen beasts transform, they become evil.\nThey are born with the *qi* of their nature,\nWithout wisdom to adorn them—\nNot of man’s kind,\nCould they not be evil?\n\nIf a man is not virtuous,\nHe is called a beast.\nWhen man transforms and becomes virtuous,\nThis is called the natural order of Heaven.\nNow, those who do not become virtuous,\nWith their soaring emptiness and trampling of the real—\nHow are they different from this?\n\nThere is Heaven before there is Earth,\nHeaven is above, Earth is below,\nHeaven and Earth follow one another—\nThis is the natural order.\nThere is Earth before there is distinction,\nThe Three Powers are firmly established,\nAnd all things are differentiated.\nThere is distinction before there is virtue,\nThe virtue of husband and wife is made manifest,\nThe virtue of sovereign and minister is displayed.\nThere is virtue before there is teaching,\nOfficials are appointed, governance and teaching are practiced;\nFather and son are preserved, households establish teaching—\nThus, they may reach the heights above.\nThere is teaching before there is Dao,\nWhen the traces of teaching are clearly marked,\nIt is constrained by the Dao;\nIf one deviates from the Dao,\nThings cannot be at peace.\nThere is Dao before there is order,\nNames and things are established,\nAnd order naturally exists.\nThere is order before there are numbers.\nWhen names and order are made clear,\nThey are governed by them.\n\nNumbers end with ten in unity,\nExtending even to thousands and millions,\nUsing the *shu* and *xu* calculations—\nThis is the principle of Heaven’s movements.\nThere is night and there is day,\nThere is dawn and there is dusk—\nThus, they are reckoned as numbers.\n\nThe sky has three hundred and sixty degrees,\nOne degree per day,\nThree hundred and sixty days completing a full cycle;\nWithin a single day,\nDawn and dusk are a hundred *ke*,\nAnd this is fixed as the reckoning of numbers.\nThe moon waxes and wanes,\nThe phases of union and separation are recorded by numbers.\nWithin a year there are twelve months,\nEach month has waxing and waning.\nThe sun and moon sometimes align in sequence,\nSometimes separate in sequence,\nAnd this completes a year.\nThe sun reaches its limit in sequence,\nThe moon reaches its limit in phases,\nThe stars return to their courses—\nThen the numbers shall reach their end.\nThus, the sun, moon, stars, and constellations\nRun their courses through twelve months,\nAnd return to their original positions.\n\nThe **Memoir**—this is but the gathering.\n\nThe four [celestial bodies] are all arrayed,\nAnd thus their reckoning is established.\nSpring, summer, autumn, and winter each govern\nThe days and months of a year.\n\nAbove this lies the **Dao of governance**—\nThe standard by which one must act.\nGovernance is **protection**.\nFrom beginning to end, this is **protection**.\nGovernance is **rectification**.\nThat which rectifies the world,\nAnd establishes the **Way**—\nThe **Heavenly Cycle** guards and protects,\nAt its start, it transforms;\nAt its end, it brings peace;\nIt does not allow deviation.\n\n**Caution:** The Sixth Warning to Duke Zhou of Lu\nThe laws of punishment must conform to order,\nFitting the needs of governance;\nThe **virtue of sparing life** must align with just statutes.\nThus, the wise and enlightened,\nSupporting the Zhou dynasty,\nTheir admonitions and encouragements\nMay be spoken of in praise.\n\nThe great principles of a state\nLie in rewards and punishments.\nIf these two are misapplied,\nWhat guidance can there be?\nThus, this is the foundation of governance—\nHence, the **Memoir** is titled as such.\n\nIn days of old,\n*\"In days of old\"*—this is the speech of past times.\nDuke Zhou sent Lord Kang to govern at Yin,\nLord Kang, Duke Zhou’s younger brother,\nTo the lands of the Three Guards of Wei.\nThe Yin people often rebelled,\nThus, the sage sent his virtuous younger brother to rule.\n\nHe admonished him, saying:\n*\"Better to acquit the guilty\nThan to condemn the innocent.\nLife hangs in the balance—\nJustice must be meticulously weighed.\nIf punishments are excessive,\nBy what standard shall they be judged?\nThus, one must not lightly condemn the innocent,\nBut rather err in favor of the guilty.\nThis too is the **Way of benevolent leniency**.*\n\n*\"There shall be no innocent condemned,\nNor punishment without clear cause—\nThough punishment be severe, without justice, it will not restrain.\nThis means punishment must be applied only to the guilty.*\n\n*\"There shall be no meritorious deed left unrewarded.\nIf rewards are unclear,\nThough given, they will not inspire.\nThis means rewards must be bestowed only upon the worthy.\"*\n\nHe admonished him further, *\"O Kang,*\nThe repeated warnings are to show earnestness.\nKang, your given name—\nTake heed in meting out punishment and reward.\nPunishment and reward—\nThese are the reins of the state.\nIn anger, one may punish without just cause;\nIn joy, one may reward without due merit.\nMoreover, excessive rewards may breed arrogance and licentiousness,\nWhile excessive punishments may strike the innocent.\nIf rewards match merit, the virtuous are encouraged;\nIf punishments fit the crime, the wicked desist.\nThis must be weighed with utmost care.\"*\n\n*(End of the scroll of the \"Memoir,\" attributed to Master Yuzi.)*\n\nThe following is the corrected and standardized text based on the *Siku Quanshu* edition, with annotations reflecting variant readings:\n\n---\n\n**#1** *\"This is the person who has perished.\"* **#2** *\"True\"* **#3** *\"Forgetful\"* **#4** *\"Born in the fourteenth month.\"* **#5** *\"Compare\"* **#6** *\"Effect\"* (The *Daozang* edition erroneously duplicates *\"effect\"* as *\"effect effect.\"* Corrected here based on the *Siku Quanshu* edition.)\n\n**#7** *\"Ren\"* **#8** *\"Retain\"* **#9** *\"Light\"* **#10** *\"King\"* **#11** *\"Govern\"* (The *Daozang* edition omits *\"govern\"* before *\"志.\"* Restored here based on the *Siku Quanshu* edition.) **#12** *\"Wisdom\"* (The *Daozang*

subject, Xíng Guī, speaks:\n\nI have heard that before the invention of knotted cords, records were sparse and indistinct;\nWhen writing first emerged, its teachings and principles arose.\nThe establishment of historians to record speech gave rise to the traces of praise and blame;\nThe appointment of officials to document affairs opened the door to admonition and exhortation.\nThus, the state’s inscriptions multiplied, their edicts and instructions became clear,\nAnd the Dao of chanting and elucidating was expanded, while the principles of explanation were made manifest.\nVirtue and deeds grew ever more refined, brilliance and wisdom renewed daily,\nAs character was polished and its luminous essence was roused.\n\nWhen the **Dao-Symbols** (道符) of **Zhōu Wén** (周文) became the **#1 Saint** (聖),\nAnd **Yù Zhǐzǐ** (鬻子) was hailed as an **exemplary sage** (稱賢),\nTheir intentions aligned with the **Dao/Way** (道), their substance harmonized,\nThey truly **#2 fulfilled the role of the Master** (實#2申師傅).\n**Yù Zhǐzǐ** (鬻子), upon **Wén Wáng’s** (文王) descent to him,\nGreatly opened his heart and mind,\nIlluminated the methods of promulgating governance,\nAnd broadly established strategies of support and completion,\nEnabling the myriad affairs of state to be contemplated,\nAnd ensuring the prosperity of an entire age.\nHe revered antiquity with sincerity,\nAnd revealed truths to sharpen perception and understanding.\n\nExamining his recorded doctrines and exploring his admonishing words,\nOne finds that he **rooted his teachings in the Dao/Way** (原道心以裁章),\nAnd **delved into the divine principles** (研神理) to awaken and nourish.\nHe **wove together** (弥纶) the **ancestral instructions** (彝训),\nAnd **structured the world with his teachings** (经纬区中),\nNot merely praising and explaining subtle truths,\nBut earnestly **passing down his legacy** (务於遗翰) for future generations.\n\nThe **Zhāi Xióng** (斋熊) was the first among the **Master’s disciples** (诸子之首),\nAnd **Wén Wáng** (文王) was the **founder of saintly virtue** (聖德之宗).\nSince **Xióng** (熊) was **Wén Wáng’s** (文王) teacher,\nAnd the **Book** (书) is the **embodiment of governance and instruction** (政教之体),\nThough its chapters may be fragmentary and incomplete,\nIts **essential framework and principles remain intact** (提举犹备纪纲),\nLike a **vessel of jade** (譬彼盘盂),\nIts **exposition surpasses the original** (发扬有愈).\n\nMy family has long been devoted to **Confucian learning** (传儒素),\nWith deep-rooted habits of loyalty and integrity.\nSeeing the **traces of a sage ruler revering his teacher** (明主奉师之踪),\nAnd observing the **path of the worthy fulfilling their duty** (贤者尽义之道),\nI have **followed and investigated** (循环征究),\nAnd **penetrated the profound mysteries** (妙极机神).\n\nThough I am the

(則天垂训),\n**Surpasses the extremes and spreads the imperial winds** (越极宣风),\n**Reveres the supreme harmony of the Ancestor** (稽太上之至和),\nAnd **awakens the bright admonitions of the sovereign** (興帝王之炯诫).\nMay your **ministers and advisors be trustworthy** (股肱谅直),\nAnd your **counselors’ doubts be resolved** (献替元疑).\nMay you **promote the worthy and the good** (大举贤良),\nAnd **bring peace and stability to the realm** (宁济区宇).\nMay the **four seas transform their faces** (四海革面),\nAnd the **eight directions cultivate their hearts** (八表宅心).\nMay you **prioritize the fundamentals and refine culture** (务本修文),\nAnd **govern with ease, achieving harmony without strife** (垂拱无事).\n\nThough I am of lowly birth and humble station,\nWith **limited understanding and shallow insight** (识度庸浅),\nI have **received the blessings of Yáo and Shùn** (荷尧沐舜),\nAnd **sang the songs of the laborers** (击壤枢歌).\nThe **Zhōu** (周) **first implemented governance and instruction** (施政教之端),\nAnd I, **listening to the harmonious melodies of the Age of Great Peace** (属听太平之咏),\n**Aspire to compile and record** (志存缀辑),\nTo **transcribe the Master’s words** (以述矢言).\n\nThe **scrolls are vast, and my words are crude** (简牍难周，辞意斯拙),\nYet I have **carefully copied and presented this work** (谨以缮写),\nTo **offer at Your imperial court** (奉献阙庭).\nMay the **sun and moon’s light shine ever brighter** (庶日月昭明),\nAnd **illuminate even the smallest gaps** (布余晖於漏隙).\nMay the **timely rains fall abundantly** (时雨咸洎),\nAnd **moisten even the driest of twigs** (洒余润於纤枯).\n\nI **hope only to contribute a humble grain of

forgetfulness.\n\nThe Master replied: *\"There is.\"*\n\nYuzi’s initial answer to King Wen—\nthere is great forgetfulness.\n\nKing Wen said: *\"Dare I ask—what is great forgetfulness?\"*\nYuzi did not immediately answer directly,\nthus King Wen prompted him further.\nKing Wen wished to clarify the principle of his ultimate aspiration,\nhence *\"what is the matter with it?\"*\n\nYuzi said:\n*\"To know one’s own evil yet not amend it,\nthus harming oneself,\nand losing one’s body.\nWhen wrong occurs, do not fear to change—\nall day long, do not commit evil.\nEvil departs from oneself—\nis it

beat the *táo* drum.\"*\nThis is the five tones.\nLawsuits require swift resolution—\nThus, beat the *táo* drum to present them.\nThe above inscriptions were all carved on the *mí* stand.\n\nThus, Yu
