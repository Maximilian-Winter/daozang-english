Xin).\nZou Xin is the pseudonym of the Song Confucian scholar Zhu Xi.\n\n**One scroll.**\nSource of the base text: *Zhengtong Daozang* (正统道藏), in the *Tongzhen* (洞真) section under *Jade Precepts* (玉诀类).\nSee also Zhu Xi’s *Examination of the Discrepancies in the Yin Fu Jing* (阴符经考异) in the *Siku Quanshu* (四库全书).\n\n**Upper Section: Commentary by Zou Xin, the Daoist of Kongtong (崆峒道士邹欣注)**\n\n**Upper Section:**\nTo observe the Dao of Heaven, to grasp Heaven’s actions—this is complete.\nThe Dao divides into Heaven and Earth; Heaven and Earth divide into the myriad things.\nAmong the myriad things, humans are the most spiritually refined (灵),\ntheir essence originally one with that of Heaven and Earth.\n\nYet what humans receive from Heaven and Earth differs in purity and mixture,\nso one must observe the Dao of Heaven and grasp its actions—\nthen the Dao resides within me.\n\nWhen it speaks of Heaven without mentioning Earth,\nEarth is already contained therein.\n\nHeaven has Five Thieves (五贼), and those who perceive them thrive.\nThe Five Thieves dwell in the heart, manifesting in Heaven’s operations.\nThe cosmos lies within the hand; all transformations arise from the body.\nThe Five Thieves—these are the Five Phases (五行).\n\nThe virtues of the world emerge from these five,\nwhile evils also arise from them—\nhence, when discussing their reversals, they are called Five Thieves.\n\nThough the Five Thieves belong to Heaven and Earth,\nthey are also the very elements that give rise to Heaven and Earth.\nDescending into humans, they become this heart.\nIf one recognizes their origins,\nthen one may apply them to Heaven and Earth,\nand creation will be within my grasp.\nThus it is said: *Those who perceive them thrive.*\n\nZhuzi (Master Zhu) says:\nThe *Yin Fu Jing* speaks of those five things\ninteracting in generation and restraint (相生相克),\ncalling them Five Thieves in the heart, manifesting in Heaven’s operations.\nIf one does not use a proper heart to observe them,\nthey all become thieves.\n\nThe Five Thieves refer to the Five Natures’ virtue (五性之德),\nmanifesting in Heaven’s operations as the Five Phases’ *qi* (五行之气).\nHeaven’s nature—this is humanity (人).\nHuman hearts—these are mechanisms (机).\nTo establish the Dao of Heaven is to regulate humanity.\n\nWhat Heaven and Earth possess as nature (性)\nis tranquil and boundless, unseen and unattainable.\nYet the human heart inherits Heaven’s nature,\nso it is said: *Heaven’s nature, this is humanity.*\n\nThe human heart, acting spontaneously,\nunaware of its own origins—this is the mechanism (机),\nthe means by which Heaven moves and Earth remains still.\n\nThis mechanism in humans—what cannot it achieve?\nTo become Yao and Shun, or Jie and Zhou—\nthe same mechanism applies.\nOnly by establishing the Dao of Heaven\ncan one regulate it, achieving wisdom (智).\nThus, when one departs from it, reason is restored.\n\nWhen Heaven unleashes destructive intent (杀机),\nthe stars shift their courses.\nWhen Earth unleashes destructive intent,\ndragons and serpents rise upon the land.\nWhen humans unleash destructive intent,\nHeaven and Earth are overturned.\nWhen Heaven and humanity jointly unleash destructive intent,\nall transformations find their foundation.\n\nDestructive intent (杀机)—this is the mechanism’s excess.\nWhen Heaven and Earth’s *qi* (气) oversteps,\nstrange phenomena appear, and dragons and serpents rise upon the land.\nWhen the human heart oversteps,\ndelusions arise, and Heaven is overturned while Earth is covered.\nWhen Heaven and humanity jointly unleash destructive intent,\nthe Dao is present—Heaven’s will and human emotions align.\n\nYet Heaven’s order has its principles,\nHeaven’s hierarchy has its rites—\nthese are humanity’s greatest relationships (伦).\nThe fourfold schools (四方之学) use this as their worldly net,\ncutting it off, yet unable to shake it—\nfor its foundation of myriad changes is fixed and unalterable.\n\n**Note:** According to the Tang official Chu Suiliang (褚遂良),\nhe obtained a copy of the *Yin Fu Jing*\ncommented by the *Taiji True Person* (太极真人)\nfrom the household of Longsun Zhao Guogong (长孙赵国公).\nHe believed the text was not the work of a single individual,\nas his annotations reveal:\nThe first two sentences are attributed to *Saintly Mother Qibo* (圣母岐伯).\nThe next four sentences to *Heavenly True Person* (天真皇人).\nAnd so forth below.\n\n「Among the various versions, the differences include:\n\n- *\"Heaven unleashes destructive intent, shifting stars and altering constellations\"* (天发杀机，移星易宿),\n- *\"Earth unleashes destructive intent, dragons and serpents emerge from the land\"* (地发杀机，龙蛇起陆),\n- *\"Humanity unleashes destructive intent, Heaven and Earth invert and overturn\"* (人发杀机，天地反覆).\n\nOther versions omit *\"shifting stars and altering constellations\"* (移星易宿) and the eight characters of *\"Earth unleashes destructive intent\"* (地发杀机八字), yet the *Chu Suiliang* version should be considered authoritative.\n\n*Siu Qi Liu* (须溪刘氏) states:\n*\"When Heaven and humanity’s destructive intent align,\nit is the chaotic movement of the primordial age—\nalignment brings certainty.\nNature has its cleverness and clumsiness,\nwhich can be suppressed or concealed.\nThe nine orifices’ (九窍) malevolent forces\nlie within the three critical points (三要),\nand they can be activated or stilled (动静).\nThe Sage’s nature aligns with Heaven and Earth,\nyet common folk cannot—\ndue to their differing cleverness and clumsiness.\nOnly by knowing how to suppress and conceal (伏藏),\ncan the clumsy become clever (巧).\nHumanity knows how to suppress and conceal\nbecause of the nine orifices’ malevolent forces (九案之邪).\nThough the orifices number nine,\nthe three critical points are:\nears, eyes, and mouth.\nBy knowing how to activate or still (动静),\none can return three times (三返),\nand the nine orifices will have no malevolent forces (无邪).\nThe eyes must see (目必视),\nthe ears must hear (耳必听),\nthe mouth must speak (口必言)—\nthese cannot be forced into stillness (静),\nyet movement (动) never truly departs from stillness (未尝离静),\nand stillness is not mere inaction (静非不动者).\nThus, one can speak of activating and stilling.\n\nFire arises from wood (火生於木),\nyet calamity must first be subdued (祸发必克).\nDeceit arises from the state (奸生於国),\nyet turmoil must first be quelled (时动必溃).\nKnowing this and refining through practice (修炼),\nis what is called a Sage (圣人).\n\nFire arises from wood (火生於木),\nyet sometimes it consumes the wood (有时而焚木);\nDeceit arises from the state (奸生於国),\nyet sometimes it must inevitably collapse (有时而必溃).\nThe five thieves’ (五贼) destructive intent\nalso follows this principle.\nKnowing this and refining through practice (修炼),\nwho but a Sage can achieve it?\nThe method of refinement (修炼之法)\nis the theory of activating and stilling (动静伏藏之说).\n\n---\n*Annotations from the Yellow Emperor’s* *Yin Fu Jing* (黄帝阴符经),\n*commented and elucidated by* *Daoist* *Zou Xin* (崆峒道士邹欣注).」\n\n**Middle Section**\n\nHeaven’s birth and Heaven’s death—this is the Dao’s principle.\nBirth and death are the Dao’s descent into *qi*, natural and inescapable.\n\nHeaven and Earth are the thieves of all things;\nAll things are the thieves of humankind;\nHumankind are the thieves of all things.\n\nWhen the three thieves are just, the Three Powers are at peace.\nHeaven and Earth give birth to all things and also kill them;\nAll things give birth to humankind and also kill them;\nHumankind give birth to all things and also kill them.\nBecause they give birth while also killing,\nThus, when reversed, it is called *theft*—just as the Five Thieves are named.\n\nYet when birth and death each find their measure,\nthe three thieves are just, and the Three Powers are settled.\nThus it is said:\n*\"Eat the season’s due, and the hundred limbs are in order.\nStir the mechanism, and all transformations are at peace.\"*\n\nHeaven, Earth, and all things are governed by humankind.\nIf humankind eats the season’s due,\nthen the hundred limbs are in order;\nIf humankind stirs the mechanism of birth and death,\nthen all transformations are at peace—\nthis is the *thief’s* Dao.\n\n*The season* refers to the early and late of spring and autumn.\n*The mechanism* refers to birth, death, growth, and nourishment.\n\nAs Master Liu of the Han dynasty said:\n*\"Eating the season’s due\"* is like Liezi’s saying—\n*\"stealing the harmony of Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nHumankind knows the *spirit* of the spirit,\nbut does not know how the *unmanifest* is spirit.\n*Spirit* is the uncanny and unfathomable.\n*The unmanifest* refers to Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, mountains and rivers, the living and the growing.\n\nHumankind knows the uncanny as spirit,\nbut does not know that Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, mountains and rivers, the living and the growing—\nwhat the ears and eyes perceive—\nare also spirit.\n\nSun and moon have their numbers, great and small have their limits.\nFrom this, *sagely* works arise; from this, *spiritual* power emerges.\nSun and moon—humankind does not know their spirit.\nThe sun’s number is great, completing three hundred sixty days;\nThe moon’s number is small, completing three hundred sixty *chén* (辰).\nHeaven and Earth’s transformations do not exceed three hundred sixty.\n\nThe origin of *sagely* works lies in knowing this;\nThe emergence of *spiritual* power lies in this.\n\nWhen stealing the mechanism,\nnone under Heaven can see it, none can know it.\nThe virtuous one who attains it preserves himself;\nThe petty one who attains it risks his life.\n\n*Stealing the mechanism*—\nthis is the Five Thieves flowing between Heaven and Earth,\nas mentioned above regarding the numbers of sun and moon.\nTo see and know it is to make the three thieves just,\nand the Three Powers at peace.\n\nYet whether the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun gained renown and longevity,\nor whether Su Qin, Zhang Yi, Shen Buhai, and Han Fei perished with their clans—\nall were by the Dao.\n\nThe people can be made to follow it,\nbut not made to know it.\nTruly profound words!\n\n---\n**Annotations from the *Yellow Emperor’s Yin Fu Jing* (黄帝阴符经注解),\ncommented and elucidated by Daoist Zou Xin (崆峒道士邹欣注).**\n\n**Lower Section**\n\nThe blind excel in hearing, the deaf in sight.\nCut off one source of profit, and the use of troops is tenfold;\nThreefold reversals of day and night, and the use of troops is ten-thousandfold.\nThe blind’s hearing and the deaf’s sight—\ntheir focused intent is undivided, one can suffice for ten.\n\nThe \"threefold reversals\" refer to ear, eye, and mouth.\n\"Reversal\" means returning to their origins.\nDay and night are the operation of yin and yang.\nWhen these three are reversed,\nthey transcend the operation of yin and yang,\nand harmonize day and night, life and death.\nOne can suffice for ten-thousand—\nas the *Yijing* says: *\"The divine warrior who does not kill.\"*\n\nZhuzi says:\nThe blind excel in hearing, the deaf in sight—\ntheir singular focus is evident.\n\"Cut off one source of profit\" means to sever profit and guard a single source.\n\"Cut off profit\" means to abandon the secondary;\n\"one source\" means to unify the fundamental origin.\n\"Threefold reversals of day and night\" means further refinement—\nnot just in warfare, but in all matters.\nThe ancients said, *\"Double the effort, halve the work,\"*\nand again: *\"The saying of threefold reversals of day and night*\nis like the Daoist practitioner’s *zi-wu* [子午] discipline—\ntoday as such, tomorrow as such,\nthe more practiced, the more effective it becomes.\"*\n\nXu Han Liuzi says:\n\"Threefold reversals\" simply means *sanxing* [三省].\nThe mind arises from things, dies from things—\nthe mechanism lies in the eyes.\nThe mind perceives through things—that is to arise from things;\nto chase things and lose oneself—that is to die from things.\nWhen humans encounter things,\ntheir orifices number nine, but their essence lies in three,\nand the eyes are the most essential of these.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"See no desirable sights, and the heart will not be disturbed.\"*\nConfucius replied:\n*\"Conquer the self through the eyes—*\n*for vision is the first step.\"*\n\nWestern teachings on the six senses and six consciousnesses\nfirst name *eye* and *form*—\nall are rooted in intent.\n\nHeaven’s lack of favor is the greatest favor.\nSwift thunder and fierce winds—\nnone fail to act with overwhelming force.\n\nThe Grace of No Grace—this is the Dao of Heaven.\nOnly through no grace can grace arise,\nonly through non-action can action be wrought—\nthis is the use of the Sage, tenfold multiplied,\nyet only through threefold reversals can it be achieved.\n\nAccording to the *Zhu* edition, the following three characters are added here: *\"The principle lies in qi.\"*\n\nThe utmost joy leaves a surplus—\nthe utmost stillness, a purity.\nHeaven’s utmost selfishness\nbecomes the utmost public use.\n\nThe principle of *qín* lies in qi.\nThe utmost joy is without affairs,\nthus its nature is surplus—\nabundant, yet it can anticipate the world’s worries.\nThe utmost stillness is without defilement,\nthus its nature is purity—\nclean, yet it can share in the world’s calamities.\n\nThis is the Dao of threefold reversals,\nthe pinnacle of non-action.\nIt is the work of those who do not pluck a single hair.\n\nYet Heaven’s Dao, though most private,\nin its use is most public—\nthus the utmost joy and utmost stillness\nare the means by which action arises.\n\nSo too with things: what can be taken is called *qín*.\nThe mutual subjugation of all things—\ndo they not act within this?\nIt is merely the natural unfolding of qi.\n\nThe tiger and leopard toward the *lín*,\nthe eagle and falcon toward the *fèng*—\nthey do not prevail by their own prowess or shock.\nThis is the threefold reversal of day and night,\nby which one attains to one against ten thousand.\n\nAccording to the *Zhu* edition, the phrase *\"The principle of qín lies in qi\"* is omitted here.\n\nLife is the root of death;\ndeath, the root of life.\nGrace arises from harm;\nharm arises from grace.\nLife, death, grace, harm—\nthe Dao is never otherwise.\nThus the destruction of frost and snow\nis the source of utmost grace;\nthe nourishment of rain and dew\nis the source of utmost forbearance.\n\nPushed to its extreme, there is no mechanism of having or not-having,\nno ceasing or motion that does not intermingle.\nThus, true speech is like reversal.\n\nThe foolish see Heaven and Earth as having patterns and principles—sacred.\nI see time and things as having patterns and principles—wise.\nMen see patterns in Heaven, principles in Earth,\nand call it sacred—\nyet they do not know why it is sacred.\nI see the patterns of time, the principles of things,\nand thus know why Heaven and Earth are sacred.\nHeaven’s patterns have their seasons,\nEarth’s principles have their things—\nthis is wisdom.\n\nSpeaking of Heaven and Earth’s constancy,\ntheir Dao is indeed as such;\nspeaking of what changes,\nit is also as such.\n\nThis is observing Heaven’s Dao,\ngrasping Heaven’s workings,\nuntil it harmonizes with day and night,\nand aligns with the unity of creation—\nmotion and stillness without contradiction.\n\nMaster Liu of Shuxu said: *\"Time and things are coarse and near.\"*\n\nAccording to the *Lishan Laomu* and *Cai* editions,\n*\"I see time and things as having patterns and principles—wise\"*\nis the final sentence of the text.\nThe *Zhu* edition and *Zhang* annotated edition include twenty-one additional sentences (114 characters) below,\nwhich Master Zhu deeply valued.\nNow, the *Zhu* edition is taken as the standard.\n\nMen see the sacred as foolish and simple,\nI see the sacred as not foolish and simple.\nMen marvel at its sacredness,\nI see its sacredness as not to be marveled at.\nWater plunging into fire—\nself-destruction is its own doing.\n\nAccording to the *Zhang* annotated edition:\n*\"Men see the sacred as foolish and simple,\nI see the sacred as not foolish and simple;\nMen expect its sacredness,\nI see its sacredness as not to be expected.\"*\nThus it is said:\n*\"How much more so water entering fire—\nself-destruction is its own doing.\"*\n\nThe Dao of Nature is still,\nthus Heaven and Earth and all things are born.\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth is gradual,\nthus yin and yang prevail.\nYin and yang, pushing against each other,\nbring about smooth transformation.\n\nMaster Zhu said: *\"These four sentences are wonderfully expressed.*\nStillness can generate motion—\nthis is gradualness.\nGradualness consumes and grows again gradually,\ngradualness nurtures Heaven and Earth’s Dao—\nthis is constancy.\nThus it instructs people.\nAgain he said: *\"The character *gradual* is most excellently placed.*\nHow could Heaven and Earth act abruptly?\nThus yin and yang prevail?\nAgain he said: *\"The sentence ‘The Dao of Heaven and Earth is gradual’ is excellent.*\nThe Dao of yin and yang—\nno day passes without their mutual victory.\nThey proceed step by step—\none retreats a fraction, the other advances a fraction.\nAgain he said: *\"If it were not for extreme stillness,\nHeaven and Earth and all things would not be born.\n*Gradual* means slow transformation.\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth—\ngradually consuming and growing—\nthus, when justness and gentleness prevail,\nthis is the principle of auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, of yin and yang victory.\nThe *Yinfu Jing* is particularly excellent here.\"\n\nThus the Sage knows the Dao of Nature cannot be defied,\nand acts accordingly.\nThe Dao of utmost stillness\ncannot be measured by calendars or instruments.\nYet from this arise wondrous devices,\ngiving birth to ten thousand phenomena.\nThe Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems—\ndivine mechanisms, hidden like ghosts.\nThe arts of yin and yang victory\nare clearly manifested in symbols.\n\n*Gao Shi’s Halting Summary* says:\nMaster Cai said:\n*\"Gou’s calligraphic *Yinfu Jing* is the most refined of books,\nmasterfully concealing its brushstrokes.*\nI observe this text—\nnot only is Gou’s penmanship vigorous and compact,\nunlike other scripts,\nbut its preface, attributed to Zheng Dan,\nis even more extraordinary.\nIts lines—\n*‘Thunder and rain above, ritual vessels spreading far,\nrefining its essence, flowing into wisdom’*—\nare exquisitely precise, unlike Tang dynasty prose.\nAnd it says:\n*‘The encounter at Panxi,\nthe secrets of the Golden Case—\nLiu Bang and Wu Qi pondered them to their depths,\nmaking *Yinfu*’s use manifest.’*\nAccording to the final lines,\nthe text hints without revealing,\nresembling a profound, mysterious device—\nten thousand phenomena unknown.\nThe Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems—\ndivine mechanisms, hidden like ghosts—\nperhaps this is what is meant by *arts*.\nIt lies in human silent enlightenment,\nand in skillful use.\"\n\nAgain, Master Wei of He Mountain said:\n*\"Master Li Jiayou was well-versed in the Classics, histories, and hundred schools,\nyet deeply studied the *Yijing*.\nIn his later years, he encountered the theory of *gathering qi and softness*,\nand correlated it with the *Yinfu Jing*.\nThrough exhaustive research and contemplation,\nhe firmly believed without ceasing.\nThus, those who understand the Dao\nmust integrate these two books with the *Yijing* in practice.\"*\n\n*The Yellow Emperor’s Yinfu Jing: Annotated and Explained* ends here.",

multiplied,\nyet only through threefold reversals can it be achieved.\n\nAccording to the *Zhu* edition, the following three characters are added here: *\"The principle lies in qi.\"*\n\nThe utmost joy leaves a surplus—\nthe utmost stillness, a purity.\nHeaven’s utmost selfishness\nbecomes the utmost public use.\n\nThe principle of *qín* lies in qi.\nThe utmost joy is without affairs,\nthus its nature is surplus—\nabundant, yet it can anticipate the world’s worries.\nThe utmost stillness is without defilement,\nthus its nature is purity—\nclean, yet it can share in the world’s calamities.\n\nThis is the Dao of threefold reversals,\nthe pinnacle of non-action.\nIt is the work of those who do not pluck a single hair.\n\nYet Heaven’s Dao, though most private,\nin its use is most public—\nthus the utmost joy and utmost stillness\nare the means by which action arises.\n\nSo too with things: what can be taken is called *qín*.\nThe mutual subjugation of all things—\ndo they not act within this?\nIt is merely the natural unfolding of qi.\n\nThe tiger and leopard toward the *lín*,\nthe eagle and falcon toward the *fèng*—\nthey do not prevail by their own prowess or shock.\nThis is the threefold reversal of day and night,\nby which one attains to one against ten thousand.\n\nAccording to the *Zhu* edition, the phrase *\"The principle of qín lies in qi\"* is omitted here.\n\nLife is the root of death;\ndeath, the root of life.\nGrace arises from harm;\nharm arises from grace.\nLife, death, grace, harm—\nthe Dao is never otherwise.\nThus the destruction of frost and snow\nis the source of utmost grace;\nthe nourishment of rain and dew\nis the source of utmost forbearance.\n\nPushed to its extreme, there is no mechanism of having or not-having,\nno ceasing or motion that does not intermingle.\nThus, true speech is like reversal.\n\nThe foolish see Heaven and Earth as having patterns and principles—sacred.\nI see time and things as having patterns and principles—wise.\nMen see patterns in Heaven, principles in Earth,\nand call it sacred—\nyet they do not know why it is sacred.\nI see the patterns of time, the principles of things,\nand thus know why Heaven and Earth are sacred.\nHeaven’s patterns have their seasons,\nEarth’s principles have their things—\nthis is wisdom.\n\nSpeaking of Heaven and Earth’s constancy,\ntheir Dao is indeed as such;\nspeaking of what changes,\nit is also as such.\n\nThis is observing Heaven’s Dao,\ngrasping Heaven’s workings,\nuntil it harmonizes with day and night,\nand aligns with the unity of creation—\nmotion and stillness without contradiction.\n\nMaster Liu of Shuxu said: *\"Time and things are coarse and near.\"*\n\nAccording to the *Lishan Laomu* and *Cai* editions,\n*\"I see time and things as having patterns and principles—wise\"*\nis the final sentence of the text.\nThe *Zhu* edition and *Zhang* annotated edition include twenty-one additional sentences (114 characters) below,\nwhich Master Zhu deeply valued.\nNow, the *Zhu* edition is taken as the standard.\n\nMen see the sacred as foolish and simple,\nI see the sacred as not foolish and simple.\nMen marvel at its sacredness,\nI see its sacredness as not to be marveled at.\nWater plunging into fire—\nself-destruction is its own doing.\n\nAccording to the *Zhang* annotated edition:\n*\"Men see the sacred as foolish and simple,\nI see the sacred as not foolish and simple;\nMen expect its sacredness,\nI see its sacredness as not to be expected.\"*\nThus it is said:\n*\"How much more so water entering fire—\nself-destruction is its own doing.\"*\n\nThe Dao of Nature is still,\nthus Heaven and Earth and all things are born.\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth is gradual,\nthus yin and yang prevail.\nYin and yang, pushing against each other,\nbring about smooth transformation.\n\nMaster Zhu said: *\"These four sentences are wonderfully expressed.*\nStillness can generate motion—\nthis is gradualness.\nGradualness consumes and grows again gradually,\ngradualness nurtures Heaven and Earth’s Dao—\nthis is constancy.\nThus it instructs people.\nAgain he said: *\"The character *gradual* is most excellently placed.*\nHow could Heaven and Earth act abruptly?\nThus yin and yang prevail?\nAgain he said: *\"The sentence ‘The Dao of Heaven and Earth is gradual’ is excellent.*\nThe Dao of yin and yang—\nno day passes without their mutual victory.\nThey proceed step by step—\none retreats a fraction, the other advances a fraction.\nAgain he said: *\"If it were not for extreme stillness,\nHeaven and Earth and all things would not be born.\n*Gradual* means slow transformation.\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth—\ngradually consuming and growing—\nthus, when justness and gentleness prevail,\nthis is the principle of auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, of yin and yang victory.\nThe *Yinfu Jing* is particularly excellent here.\"\n\nThus the Sage knows the Dao of Nature cannot be defied,\nand acts accordingly.\nThe Dao of utmost stillness\ncannot be measured by calendars or instruments.\nYet from this arise wondrous devices,\ngiving birth to ten thousand phenomena.\nThe Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems—\ndivine mechanisms, hidden like ghosts.\nThe arts of yin and yang victory\nare clearly manifested in symbols.\n\n*Gao Shi’s Halting Summary* says:\nMaster Cai said:\n*\"Gou’s calligraphic *Yinfu Jing* is the most refined of books,\nmasterfully concealing its brushstrokes.*\nI observe this text—\nnot only is Gou’s penmanship vigorous and compact,\nunlike other scripts,\nbut its preface, attributed to Zheng Dan,\nis even more extraordinary.\nIts lines—\n*‘Thunder and rain above, ritual vessels spreading far,\nrefining its essence, flowing into

*Yinfu*’s use manifest.’*\nAccording to the final lines,\nthe text hints without revealing,\nresembling a profound, mysterious device—\nten thousand phenomena unknown.\nThe Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems—\ndivine mechanisms, hidden like ghosts—\nperhaps this is what is meant by *arts*.\nIt lies in human silent enlightenment,\nand in skillful use.\"\n\nAgain, Master Wei of He Mountain said:\n*\"Master Li Jiayou was well-versed in the Classics, histories, and hundred schools,\nyet deeply studied the *Yijing*.\nIn his later years, he encountered the theory of *gathering qi and
