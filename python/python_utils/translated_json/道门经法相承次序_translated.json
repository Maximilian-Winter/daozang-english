  "full_translation": "**The Succession of Daoist Scriptures and Teachings**\n\n**Title:** *The Succession of Daoist Scriptures and Teachings*\n(Original unattributed author)\nThis text records Emperor Tang Tianhuang (Emperor Gaozong of Tang) seeking the Dao from Zhongyue Master Pan (Pan Shizheng), likely compiled by Tang-era Shangqing Daoists. The original single scroll was later divided into three volumes. The source text is from *The Canon of Orthodox Daoist Scripture (Zhengtong Daozang)*, the Taiping section.\n\n---\n\n**Volume One: The Origin and Succession of Daoist Teachings**\n\nThe Daoist lineage originates from the formless beginning, manifesting through response and sensation, emerging from the wondrous One. From the wondrous One, it divides into the Three Primordials (*sānyuán*), which further transform into the Three Qi (*sānqì*), and from the Three Qi arise the Three Realms (*sāncái*). Once the Three Realms are established, all things are complete.\n\nThe Three Primordials are:\n1. **Hundun Taowu Yuan** (Mixed Void Primordial of the Great Non-Being),\n2. **Chihun Taowu Yuan** (Red Mixed Primordial of the Great Non-Being),\n3. **Mingji Xuantong Yuan** (Silent and Mysterious Communicating Primordial).\n\nFrom **Hundun Taowu Yuan** emanates Tianbao Jun (Celestial Treasure Lord),\nFrom **Chihun Taowu Yuan** emanates Lingbao Jun (Numinous Treasure Lord),\nFrom **Mingji Xuantong Yuan** emanates Shenbao Jun (Divine Treasure Lord).\n\nThe Great Void Manifestation (*Dadong Jibie*) further distinguishes the **Hua Zhu** (Transformation Master), governing the Three Pure Realms.\n\nThe Three Pure Realms are:\n- **Yuqing** (Jade Purity),\n- **Shangqing** (Upper Purity),\n- **Taqing** (Great Purity),\nalso called the Three Heavens.\n\nThe Three Heavens are:\n- **Qingwei Tian** (Pure Mists Heaven),\n- **Yuyu Tian** (Jade Remnant Heaven),\n- **Dachi Tian** (Great Red Heaven).\n\nTianbao Jun governs the Yuqing Realm, which is Qingwei Tian, its qi being **Qingchi** (Azure Beginning).\nLingbao Jun governs the Shangqing Realm, which is Yuyu Tian, its qi being **Baiyuan** (White Primordial).\nShenbao Jun governs the Taqing Realm, which is Dachi Tian, its qi being **Huangxuan** (Yellow Mysterious).\n\nThus, the *Chapter on the Nine Heavens Generating Spirits* states:\n*\"These three names differ in years and titles, yet their essence is one. These three Lords are each the teaching masters of the Three Caverns, the exalted deities of the Three Caverns.\"*\n\nThe Three Caverns (*sāndòng*) are:\n- **Dongzhen** (Cavern of Perfected Truth),\n- **Dongxuan** (Cavern of Mysterious Primordials),\n- **Dongshen** (Cavern of Divine Manifestations).\n\nTianbao Jun expounds the **Twelve Departments of Scripture**, becoming the master of the Dongzhen Cavern.\nLingbao Jun expounds the **Twelve Departments of Scripture**, becoming the master of the Dongxuan Cavern.\nShenbao Jun expounds the **Twelve Departments of Scripture**, becoming the master of the Dongshen Cavern.\n\nThe Three Caverns together form **Thirty-Six Exalted Scriptures**. The first, Dongzhen, is the **Great Vehicle**; the second, Dongxuan, is the **Middle Vehicle**; the third, Dongshen, is the **Lesser Vehicle**.\n\nFrom the Three Caverns, seven departments are synthesized:\n- **Dongzhen, Dongxuan, Dongshen** (the three caverns),\n- **Taixuan** (Great Mysterious),\n- **Taiping** (Great Peace),\n- **Taqing** (Great Purity),\nas auxiliary scriptures. **Taixuan** aids Dongzhen, **Taiping** aids Dongxuan, and **Taqing** aids Dongshen.\n\nThe three auxiliaries combine to form the **Thirty-Six Departments**, while the **Seven Departments of Unified Command** (*Zhengyi Mengwei Tongguan*) synthesize into seven, hence the saying: *\"Three Caverns of Exalted Texts, Seven Departments of Mysterious Teachings.\"*\n\nFrom these seven, the **Thirty-Six Departments** further expand. The Thirty-Six Departments are:\n1. **Benwen** (Original Texts),\n2. **Shenfu** (Divine Talismans),\n3. **Yujue** (Jade Secrets),\n4. **Lingtu** (Numinous Diagrams),\n5. **Pulu** (Genealogies and Records),\n6. **Jielü** (Precepts and Statutes),\n7. **Weiyi** (Ceremonial Etiquette),\n8. **Fangfa** (Methods and Techniques),\n9. **Chongshu** (Assemblies and Discourses),\n10. **Chuanji** (Transmissions and Biographies),\n11. **Zansong** (Hymns and Chants),\n12. **Biaoshou** (Tables and Petitions).\nEach of the Three Caverns contains twelve departments, totaling **Thirty-Six Departments**.\n\nThe Three Qi are:\n- **Xuanqi** (Mysterious Qi),\n- **Yuanqi** (Primordial Qi),\n- **Shiqì** (Beginning Qi).\n\n**Shiqì** is azure, located in Qingwei Tian;\n**Yuanqi** is white, located in Yuyu Tian;\n**Xuanqi** is yellow, located in Dachi Tian.\nThus, they are called the **Three Qi of Xuan, Yuan, and Shi**.\n\nFrom these three qi, **Yin, Yang, and Harmony** arise, which further generate **Heaven, Earth, and Humanity**.\n\nThus, the *Laozi Jing* states:\n*\"The Dao gives birth to One, One gives birth to Two, Two gives birth to Three, Three gives birth to all things.\"*\n\nFrom **Xuandu Yujing** downward, there are **Thirty-Six Heavens** in total. Of these, **Twenty-Eight Heavens** are within the Three Realms, and **Eight Heavens** are beyond them.\n\nThe Three Realms are:\n- **Yùjiè** (Realm of Desire),\n- **Sèjiè** (Realm of Form),\n- **Wúsèjiè** (Realm of Formlessness).\n\nThe lower **Six Heavens** belong to the Realm of Desire,\nThe next **Eighteen Heavens** belong to the Realm of Form,\nThe upper **Four Heavens** belong to the Realm of Formlessness,\ntotaling **Twenty-Eight Heavens** within the Three Realms.\n\nThe Three Realms’ exalted domains possess refined and solemn forms. From the **Realm of Desire** upward, human lifespans extend greatly, their lands made of gold, their steps of white jade, and treasures of pearls and jewels appearing naturally. Though refined music resounds, they are free from birth and death.\n\nThe next **Four Heavens** above the Three Realms are called **Zhongrén Tian** (Heavens of Nurturing Humans), also **Sheng Dizi Tian** (Heavens of Holy Disciples), or **Sifan Tian** (Four Brahman Heavens). Those who reach here transcend birth and death, beyond the reach of the Three Calamities.\n\nAbove these are the **Three Realms**, divided into left, right, and central palaces, each containing:\n- **Xianwang** (Immortal Kings),\n- **Xian Gong** (Immortal Dukes),\n- **Xian Qing** (Immortal Viscounts),\n- **Xian Bo** (Immortal Marquises),\n- **Xian Dafu** (Immortal High Officers),\nalongside **one Taishang Laojun** (Supreme Venerable Lord) and **one Tian Shi** (Celestial Master).\n\nThe **Taqing Realm** has **Nine Xian** (Immortals):\n1. Shangxian (Highest Immortal),\n2. Gaoxian (Lofty Immortal),\n3. Daxian (Great Immortal),\n4. Xuánxian (Mysterious Immortal),\n5. Tianxian (Celestial Immortal),\n6. Zhenxian (True Immortal),\n7. Shenxian (Divine Immortal),\n8. Lingxian (Spiritual Immortal),\n9. Zhixian (Ultimate Immortal).\n\nThe **Zhen-Sheng** (True-Sage) Realms follow a similar numbering sequence—**Shang, Gao, Da, Xuan, Tian, Zhen, Shen, Ling, Zhi**—but with variations:\n- For **Zhen** (True): *Xianzhen* (Immortal True), *Yuanzhen* (Primordial True),\n- For **Sheng** (Sage): *Xiansheng* (Immortal Sage), *Wutian Sheng* (Sage Beyond Heaven).\n\nThe highest heaven is named **Daluo Tian** (Great Luo Heaven), located atop **Xuandu Yujing Mountain**. There, the **Ziwu Jinque** (Purple Micro Star Gate) stands, adorned with **seven-treasure cypress trees**, where **qilin** and **shishi** (mythical beasts) roam. The **Three-World Venerable Sovereigns** govern within.\n\nThe **Twenty-Eight Heavens of Desire**, the **Four Heavens above**, the **Three Realms**, and the **Daluo Heaven** above them—all **Thirty-Six Heavens**—are under the dominion of the Celestial Sovereigns.\n\nThus, the scripture declares:\n*\"Above the Three Realms lies the boundless Daluo Heaven,\nWithout form or root, its clouds towering and vast—\nOnly Yuan Shi remains,\nThe eternal home of the Great Cataclysm.\"*\n\nThe **Three Celestial Sovereigns of the Dao** are: the **Past Yuan Shi Tianzun** (Celestial Sovereign of the Primordial Beginning), the **Present Taishang Yuhuang Tianzun** (Celestial Sovereign of the Supreme Jade Emperor), and the **Future Jinque Yuchen Tianzun** (Celestial Sovereign of the Golden Gate and Jade Dawn).\n\nYet, the **Taishang** (Supreme Emperor) is himself a disciple of the **Yuan Shi Tianzun**. Since the **Shang Huang** (Upper Emperor) took his seat half a *kāli* (eon) ago, the **Yuan Shi Tianzun** has been in meditation.\n\nThe **Three Celestial Sovereigns** also possess ten titles:\n1. **Ziran** (Natural),\n2. **Yuanji** (Primordial Extremity),\n3. **Dadao** (Great Dao),\n4. **Zhizhen** (Ultimate Truth),\n5. **Taishang** (Supreme),\n6. **Daojun** (Dao Lord),\n7. **Gaohuang** (High Emperor),\n8. **Tianzun** (Celestial Sovereign),\n9. **Yudi** (Jade Emperor),\n10. **Bixia** (Your Majesty).\n\nExamining the Daoist scriptures and canons, they originate from the **Three Primordial** (Three Yuan), descend from the **Five Phases** (Five De), and culminate in the **Eight Trigrams** (Eight Xie). By uniting the **Three** with the **Five**, they form the **Eight Assemblies** (Eight Hui).\n\nThe characters of the **Eight Assemblies** are formed by **Miaoji** (subtle *qi*), with eight angles and drooping rays, condensed in the void as celestial cloud inscriptions. **Tai Zhen** (Supreme Truth) holds the brush, **Yu Fei** (Jade Consort) sweeps the mat, **Huang Jin** (Yellow Gold) serves as the book, and **Bai Yu** (White Jade) as the pages. They are sealed in the heavens above and stored in the **Seven-Treasure Mysterious Platform** (Qiantai). When the Dao is present, they appear; when the Dao is absent, they vanish.\n\nThis is the **Natural Heavenly Scripture**, not the work of **Cang Jie** (the legendary inventor of Chinese writing). The transmitted *Lingbao Jing* (Scripture of the Sacred Treasure) is authored by **Tian Zhen Huangren** (the Heavenly True Yellow Man), received at **Emei Mountain** from **Xuanyuan Huangdi** (the Yellow Emperor of the Five Augusts).\n\nMoreover, the **Tian Zhen Huangren** received imperial decrees at the **Mudu Platform** (De’s Pavilion). **Xia Yu** (Emperor Yu of the Xia) was inspired by its descent at **Zhong Mountain**, and **He Lu** (King Goujian of Yue) secretly glimpsed it at **Jouqu River**.\n\nLater, there were disciples like **Ge Xiaoxian** and **Zheng Siyuan**, passing down the teachings in an unbroken lineage. As for **Laozi’s** *Daode Jing* (Classic of the Dao and Virtue), it is categorized under the **Great Vehicle Section** (Dacheng) of the **Orthodox Daoist Canon** (Zhengzong), ranking as a **Three Auxiliary Scripture** (San Fu), yet not entering the **Three Caverns Teachings** (San Dong).\n\nToday, people’s learning is often shallow—they recite only the *Daode Jing*, unaware of the **True Scripture**, and mistakenly claim Daoism began with **Zhuang Zhou** (Master Zhuang), not knowing its origins trace back to **Zhuxia** (the Sage of the Pillar). Alas, how lamentable!\n\nWith such limited understanding—like sipping from a ladle or peering through a tube—how can one grasp the full extent of this? What is the true measure of attainment?\n\nThe **Venerable Lord** was born at the end of the **Shang Dynasty**, raised in the early **Zhou**, entrusted to the divine and mysterious **Jade Maiden**, gestating for eighty-one years beneath a **Li Tree**, emerging from his left armpit at birth—already radiant and white—known as **Laozi**, taking the tree as his surname, thus bearing the **Li** clan.\n\nHis appearance was thus: fine brows of yellow hue, sun-like horns and moon-like eyes, his stride measured in five *bu* and ten *chi*, his ears with three openings, his nose with twin pillars.\n\nAs the **Zhou virtue declined** and the **Way of the world perished**, in the thirty-third year of King Ping’s reign, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, he departed **Zhou** and crossed the **Green Ox Ford**, where purple qi hovered over the pass. There, he entrusted the *True Scripture of the Dao and Virtue* to the **Count of the Pass, Yin Xi**.\n\nThus, the **Daoist scriptures and edicts** are not merely five thousand in number. The **Celestial Sovereign of Primordial Beginnings**, the **Precious Pearl Laozi**—their distinction lies not only in differing eras but also in varying titles.\n\nWhat is called the **Three Realms**?\nFirst, the **Realm of Desire** has six heavens, as recorded in the *Scripture on Guiding Beings*: the **Great Yellow Emperor’s** celestial tally reaches six heavens. Those in the **Realm of Desire**, with lifespans of ten thousand years, commit no bodily offenses—no killing, no theft—upon rebirth, ascending to these heavens. Within these heavens, the six desires are untainted; thus, one is born there.\n\nSecond, the **Realm of Form** has eighteen heavens, taken sequentially. Those who, in one lifetime, commit no mental offenses—no greed, no wrath—are reborn into these heavens, where lifespans span billions of years.\n\nThird, the **Formless Realm** has four heavens. Those who, in one lifetime, refrain from evil speech—no slander, no deceit, no idle chatter—shall, in their next existence, dwell in these heavens. Their lifespans span billions of *kalpas*. Among the virtuous men and women whose merits are complete, worthy of ascending to the four heavens, the **Queen Mother** welcomes them, and they ascend to these four heavens.\n\nAbove the **Three Realms** lies the **Supreme Constant Fusion Heaven**, the **Great Release Victorious Heaven**, the **Dragon-Transformed Brahman Heaven**, and the **Great Polarity Jia-Yi Heaven**—these four heavens are called the **Four Human Heavens**, the highest of the Three Realms, untouched by calamity.\n\nAbove the **Four Human Heavens** are the **Three Pure Realms**:\nFirst, the **Highest Clarity** (Tai Qing);\nSecond, the **Upper Clarity** (Shang Qing);\nThird, the **Jade Clarity** (Yu Qing).\n\nAbove the **Three Pure Realms** is the **Great Luo Heaven**, where the **Celestial Sovereign of Primordial Beginnings** resides. In the **Highest Clarity Realm**, the **Celestial Sovereign of Precious Red Heaven** expounds the **Twelve Divisions of Scripture**, known as the *Cavernous Divine Section*, with one as the **Immortal Sovereign**.\n\nThe **Upper Clarity Realm** is the **Yu-Yu Heaven**, where the **Numinous Treasure Sovereign** teaches as the **Master**, expounding the **Twelve Divisions of Scripture**, known as the *Cavernous Mysterious Section*, with one as the **True Sovereign**.\n\nThe **Jade Clarity Realm** is the **Pure Microcosmic Heaven**, where the **Celestial Sovereign of Treasure** expounds the **Twelve Divisions of Scripture**, known as the *Cavernous True Section*, with one as the **Holy Sovereign**—thus the **Immortal, True, and Holy**.\n\nThe **Precious Red Heaven** embodies **Primordial Qi**, its hue white;\nThe **Yu-Yu Heaven** embodies **Mysterious Qi**, its hue yellow;\nThe **Pure Microcosmic Heaven** embodies **Original Qi**, its hue azure.\n\nThese are the **Three Primordial Qi** of the **Highest Clarity**, **Upper Clarity**, and **Jade Clarity**—the essence of **Dao practice** and **ascending the platform**.\n\nWhat are called the **Four Equalities**?\nFirst, **only compassion**;\nSecond, **only love**;\nThird, **only goodness**;\nFourth, **only endurance**.\n\nWhat are called the **Six Perfections of Practice**?\nFirst, **diligence**;\nSecond, **faith**;\nThird, **submission** (to the Dao);\nFourth, **perseverance**;\nFifth, **admonition and disputation** (with wisdom);\nSixth, **abandoning alcohol and lust**.\n\nWhat are called the **Six Roots**?\nFirst, the **ear-root**;\nSecond, the **eye-root**;\nThird, the **nose-root**;\nFourth, the **tongue-root**;\nFifth, the **mind-root**;\nSixth, the **body-root**.\n\nThe **root** is that which, externally, has no object, and internally, no response—thus called **root**.\n\nWhat are called the **Six Dusts**?\nThe **eye**, with **lust for color**, is dust;\nThe **ear**, with **indulgence in sound**, is dust;\nThe **nose**, with **attachment to fragrance and stench**, is dust;\nThe **tongue**, with **discernment of flavors**, is dust;\nThe **body**, with **desire for smoothness**, is dust;\nThe **mind**, with **lust for contact**, is dust.\n\nWhen the **Six Roots** overstep, they become the **Six Dusts**.\nWhen **turbulence** loses its true nature, they are also called the **Six Bandits**.\n\nThis is through human **artifice and application**.\n\nWhat are called the **Four Great Elements**?\nFirst, the **Earth Element**, forming **bones and flesh**;\nSecond, the **Water Element**, forming **blood and vessels**;\nThird, the **Fire Element**, providing **warmth**;\nFourth, the **Wind Element**, generating **coolness**.\n\nWhat are called the **Five Shades** (of perception)?\nFirst, the **Shade of Form**: through the eyes, perceiving all forms—this is the **Shade of Form**.\nSecond, the **Shade of Reception**: the mind discerns **right and wrong, suffering and joy**—this is the **Shade of Reception**.\nThird, the **Shade of Reflection**: the mind contemplates—this is the **Shade of Reflection**.\nFourth, the **Shade of Action**: the mind follows reflection and acts—this is the **Shade of Action**.\nFifth, the **Shade of Cognition**: the mind knows **birth and death**, recognizing, discerning, and remembering—this is the **Shade of Cognition**.\n\nWhat are called the **Three Karmas**?\nFirst, **bodily karma**: killing, theft, lewdness.\nSecond, **mental karma**: greed, wrath, delusion.\nThird, **verbal karma**: evil speech, slander, lies, and idle chatter—these are the **Three Karmas**.\n\nThe **three bodily, three mental, and four verbal** offenses combine into the **Ten Evils**.\n\nThe **Five Sufferings**:\nThere are **five sufferings of life and death**—five in **life**, five in **death**.\n\nWhat are called the **Five Sufferings of Life**?\nAs the *Scripture on Ascending the Mysterious* states:\nFirst, being enslaved as a **servant or concubine**, enduring **sorrow and separation**.\nSecond, dwelling in **folly and blindness**, failing to see the **wondrous Dao**, estranged from the **Master**.\nThird, being **lonely, widowed, orphaned, or solitary**—having the **form of a person** but lacking **human sentiment**.\nFourth, suffering **violence and misfortune**, bound in **prisons and chains**.\nFifth, though **long-lived**, plagued by **disease**, tormented by **afflictions** day and night—these are the **Five Sufferings of Life**.\n\nWhat are called the **Five Sufferings of Death**?\nFirst, traversing **mountains of blades and forests of swords**, limbs severed and torn.\nSecond, plunged into **boiling cauldrons**, flesh and bone dissolved, trapped in the **wheel of birth and death**.\nThird, wandering as a **hungry ghost**, clothes insufficient to cover the body, food insufficient to fill the stomach, consuming **fire and charcoal**.\nFourth, a **son embracing a copper pillar**, a **daughter lying on an iron bed**, **swords piercing the heart**, **blades rending the back**.\n\n「Sixth, though **freed from suffering**, still one must endure the **Five Sufferings of Life** and be reborn as **livestock**, subjected to human lashes—**whips** breaking the neck, **hooves** piercing the body. This is named the **Five Sufferings of Death**.\n\nWhat are called the **Three Filths**?\n*Filth* refers to **bondage**. First is the **path of hell** (地狱道), second the **path of hungry ghosts** (饿鬼道), third the **path of livestock** (畜生道). Together with the **Five Sufferings**, this is named the **Eight Difficulties**.\n\nWhat are called the **Three Karmas**?\nThey were previously mentioned: first, **physical karma** (身业), second, **mental karma** (心业), third, **verbal karma** (口业). Within **physical karma**, there are three transgressions: first, the **transgression of killing** (杀生过), second, the **transgression of theft** (偷盗过), third, the **transgression of licentiousness** (邪淫过).\nAll beings, with a mere turn of the hand or movement of the foot, habitually commit harm. All sentient creatures with blood—without mercy—either act under cover of darkness, plundering openly, or pass by temples and shrines, taking **sacred treasures**. After this transgression, one falls into the **Three Filths**, where **venomous birds** peck out the eyes, **iron plows** till the tongue, molten copper seethes in **boiling cauldrons**, poured into the mouth and burning the body. Through countless **kalpas** (劫) of endless darkness, there is no way to escape—this is the retribution for one’s prior **karma**.\n\nWithin **mental karma**, there are also three **poisons** (三毒): first, the **poison of deceit** (阴私毒), second, the **poison of harm** (贼害毒), third, the **poison of slander** (谗佞毒).\nAfter this transgression, one endures the **Five Turbid Cauldrons** (五浊汤)—day and night, tormented by fire. Though reborn, one becomes a **venomous serpent** or **malevolent beast**, repaying the sins of the **Three Poisons** from a past life.\nThis is named **mental karma**.\n\nWithin **verbal karma**, there are four **offenses** (四罪): first, **deceptive speech** (绮言), second, **falsehood** (妄语), third, **double-tongued slander** (两舌), fourth, **malicious cursing** (恶骂).\nAll beings across the **Ten Directions** (十方) of the great earth indulge in **flowery, seductive words** (华辞绮艳), twist their tongues in **double-tongued slander**, speak ill of others, severing **kinship and lineage** (种亲), uttering **coarse, malevolent speech** (粗言恶气) and cursing one another. With **verbal karma**, the **root of the tongue** (舌根) craves **savory flavors**, drinking wine, eating meat, and indulging in **spicy, pungent** (荤辛) tastes.\nAfter this transgression, one descends into the **Nine Abysses** (九幽), an endless night of **darkness and cold**, where one is imprisoned in **biting frost**.\nEven if one is kind to **compassionate parents**, who would know the **bitter and sweet** (苦爽含酸) of their suffering? Though one has **affectionate spouses and children**, how could they witness the **lonely spirit enduring torment** (孤魂受痛)?\nOnly the **Three Celestial Teachers** (三天教主) and the **Six Path Masters** (六道大师) pity the suffering of all beings, like **a tender infant** (赤子), filled with **mercy and love**, universally saving all sentient beings, bestowing **blessings and grace**, aiding those with **sentience** (含识).\nUnder the **compassionate guidance** (御慈悲之救物) of the **Teachers of Mercy**, and the **great grace** (洪恩) of the **Primordial Sage** (元始), all strive to **purify mind and body**, gathering their intentions in one moment.\nWhether the **offense is great or small**, all beg for its removal. Whether the **obstacle is shallow or deep**, all seek **atonement in a single day**. With **one heart**, they **bow in reverence**, taking refuge in **faith and devotion**.\n\nThe **Tang Emperor** (唐天皇) asked in **Mount Song** (中岳) about the **Triple Unity Method** (三一法). The **Revered Master** (尊师) replied:\n*\"In accordance with the *Scripture of the Sovereign’s Unity* (皇人守一经), the method of **Triple Unity** (三守一) is preserved. First, **cultivate unity** within the mind at the **space between the brows** (两眉间), then withdraw inward to the **upper elixir field** (上丹田), three inches deep. There is a **Divine Being** (神) named **赤子** (Child of Vermilion), with the **surname 元先** (Primordial First). Another name is **帝卿** (Lord of the Sovereign), with a height of three inches, wearing **vermilion headgear, vermilion robes, and vermilion shoes** (赤帻、赤衣、赤履).\n\nNext, **cultivate unity** within the **middle elixir field** (心中丹田), where a **Divine Being** (神) named **真人** (True Person), with the **surname 子丹** (Elixir Child), is also called **光坚** (Radiant Strength), with three inches in height, wearing **vermilion headgear, vermilion robes, and vermilion shoes**.\n\nThen, **cultivate unity** within the **lower elixir field** (脐下三寸), three inches below the navel, where a **Divine Being** (神) named **婴儿** (Infant), with the **surname 元阳子** (Primordial Yang Child), is also called **谷玄子** (Mysterious Valley Child), with three inches in height, wearing **vermilion headgear, vermilion robes, and vermilion shoes**.\n\nVisualize the **lower unity** seated upon a **golden bed and jade couch** (金床玉机), constantly stirring the **refined vital essence** (精气) with a **golden censer and jade ladle** (金炉玉匕).\n\nThen, **cultivate unity** from the **lower unity** to the **middle unity**, dwelling on its **left side**, and again, **cultivate unity** with the **lower unity**’s hand holding the **golden censer and jade ladle**, residing on the **middle unity**’s **right side**. First, **nourish the upper and middle unity** (上中一) with the **refined essence**, granting one **thirteen breaths** (得十三口). Then, return to **contemplate the dwelling place of the upper unity**, followed by **contemplate the dwelling place of the lower unity**, and then cease.\n\nThe **True Person** said: *\"You can achieve **all things through Unity** (守一).*\n**Unity** is the **Sovereign of the Body** (身之帝君). Guarding the **Sovereign** ensures the **Sovereign’s presence**, and when the **Sovereign is present**, the **thirty-six thousand spirits** (三万六千神) dare not fail to be present as well.\n**Contemplating Unity** can repel **hundreds of ghosts and spirits** (百鬼众精), **five weapons** (五兵)—water and fire—**all calamities and five poisons** (众灾五毒), **tigers and wolves, snakes and locusts** (虎狼蛇蝗), **crocodiles, dragons, and malevolent specters** (蛟龙魍魉), **mountain spirits and demonic apparitions** (山精鬼魅), preventing them from approaching humans.\n\nThe **Tang Emperor** asked: *\"The **Nine Palaces** (九宫) at the hairline on the forehead—what are their names?\"*\nThe **Revered Master** replied:\n*\"In accordance with the *Scripture of Ascending to Truth and Hidden Secrets* (登真隐诀经), the hairline contains the **Nine Palaces** (九宫) behind the forehead. First is the **Double Field Palace** (双田宫), second the **Bright Hall Palace** (明堂宫), third the **Chamber Palace** (洞房宫), fourth the **Elixir Field Palace** (丹田宫), fifth the **Flowing Pearl Palace** (流珠宫), sixth the **Jade Sovereign Palace** (玉帝宫), seventh the **Celestial Court Palace** (天庭宫), eighth the **Ultimate Truth Palace** (极真宫), ninth the **Mysterious Elixir Palace** (玄丹宫).\nIn accordance with the *Hidden Secrets of Ascending to Truth* (登真隐诀), the **space between the brows** (两眉间) above the forehead is divided into three parts: the first inch is the **Double Field Palace** (守寸双田), the second inch is the **Bright Hall Palace** (明堂宫), the third inch is the **Chamber Palace** (洞房宫), the fourth inch is the **Elixir Field Palace** (丹田宫), the fifth inch is the **Flowing Pearl Palace** (流珠宫), and the sixth inch is the **Jade Sovereign Palace** (玉帝宫).\nAbove the **Bright Hall Palace**, one inch is the **Celestial Court Palace** (天庭宫); above the **Chamber Palace**, one inch is the **Ultimate Truth Palace** (极真宫); above the **Elixir Field Palace**, one inch is the **Mysterious Elixir Palace** (玄丹宫); and above the **Flowing Pearl Palace**, one inch is the **Supreme Sovereign Palace** (太皇宫).\nThus, there are **nine palaces** (九宫) within one head.\n\nThe **Tang Emperor** asked: *\"Where is the **Six Harmony Palace** (六合宫)?\"*\nThe **Revered Master** replied:\n*\"In accordance with the *Scripture of Double Vision* (双景经), the **Six Palaces** (六宫) are located behind the brows, one *fen* (分) deep into the skin, and further divided into nine sections, each nine *fen* (分) in size.\"*\n\nThe **Tang Emperor** asked: *\"Where does the **Daoist path** (道家) culminate in **fruit and attainment** (证果)?*\nThe **Celestial Master** (天师) replied:\n*\"The **Law Nature** (法性) is always **serene and pure** (常湛), and **True Principle** (真理) rests in **stillness and emptiness** (唯寂). Though **mixed and transformed** (混成) and giving rise to **things** (有物), it is also **void and boundless** (虚廓), beyond perception. Yet, through **sensual responses** (机感), it subtly encompasses all. The **names** given in **teachings** (因教立名) are boundless in meaning.\nThe **Dao** (道) is the **wondrous name** (妙称) for **perfect harmony and unity** (圆通).\"\n\nThe **Sage** is the supreme name for **profound awareness** (玄觉). All things with form inherently contain the **Dao-nature** (道性). Yet, attaining the **Dao** varies in depth, and **enlightenment** ranges from shallow to profound.\n\nTo merely grasp the common and not the true is not to attain the **Dao**; to perceive the near but not the far is not to be called a **Sage**. Thus, sensations of pain, itching, cold, and warmth are but the trivial awareness of all things. Mastering the **Nine Net Bindings** (九结) is but a skillful proximity to understanding—yet this is daily distant from the **Dao**, ever farther from sainthood.\n\nOnly those who **uprightly** (挺然) awaken to **profound insight** (玄悟) and **transcendently** (超然) attain **great harmony** (大通) can perceive the perils of the **Three Realms** (三界) and guide all **Four Births** (四生) to the **Domain of Longevity** (寿域). This is achieved by **awakening through harmony**, making the unaware aware, and the unharmonized harmonized—thus perfecting **Great Awakening**, hence called **Round Enlightenment** (圆通).\n\nYet, the **Law** (法) and **humanity** (人) are inherently harmonized—**harmony as essence**, **trace as manifestation**. When perceived through **form**, it is not **being**; when responded to through **sensation**, it is not **emptiness**. Thus, the **Celestial Sovereign of the Great Dao** (大道天尊) embodies both **True** and **Responsive** aspects: the **True** abides **serene and eternal**, neither generated nor extinguished; the **Responsive** manifests with coming and going, **provisionally demonstrating** to guide beings.\n\nYet, the **True** and **Responsive** are twofold in form—**True Body** as the **Root of the Dao**, **Responsive Body** as **Manifested Trace**. Across **kalpas**, the **Manifested Trace** emerges, projecting forms and transmitting sounds, expounding **sutras** to guide beings—innumerable in **great compassion**, encompassing all living beings.\n\nSince all beings differ in **root-nature** (根性), **teachings** are established in **graded stages** (科), with **progressive** and **sudden** methods varying.\n\nFor those who first awaken to the **Dao-intent**, cultivating **aspiration**, as taught, begin by upholding **pure precepts**. The **precepts** (戒) are of two kinds: **Precepts of Attainment** (有得戒) and **Precepts of Non-Attainment** (无得戒).\n\n**Precepts of Attainment** are as described in the *Taixuan Zhenjing* (《太玄真经》): the **Three Precepts**, **Five Precepts**, **Nine Precepts**, **Ten Precepts**, **One Hundred and Eighty Precepts**, and the **Three Hundred Great Precepts**.\n\n**Precepts of Non-Attainment** refer to those of **highest aptitude** (上机), whose **spirit-awareness** is enlightened, whose **conduct** is refined, and whose **actions** are subtle—free from **deliberate intent**, untouched by **defilements**, entering the **void-realm**, treading the **true source**. They attain **permanent bliss** without seeking, and **all virtues** arise spontaneously; they transcend the **human realm** without aversion, and **all evils** cease naturally. Since they inherently **hold nothing**, they inherently **transgress nothing**—this is called **Non-Attainment**.\n\nSince there is no transgression, there is no loss. Thus, they are called **true high-aptitude beings**. Such are their precepts.\n\nIf one upholds the precepts without transgression, they ascend the **Ten Transformations** (十转位) and attain the **Five Dao Fruits** (五道果).\n\nThe **Ten Transformations** are as stated in the *Haikong Zhizang Jing* (《海空智藏经》):\n1. **Transformation of No-Anxiety** (无忧转),\n2. **Transformation of Pure Mind** (净心转),\n3. **Transformation of Release from Hindrance** (释滞转),\n4. **Transformation of Daoist Scholar** (道儒转),\n5. **Transformation of Penetrating Insight** (达解转),\n6. **Transformation of Auspicious Vision** (善见转),\n7. **Transformation of Skillful Means** (权物转),\n8. **Transformation of Clarifying Responses** (了机转),\n9. **Transformation of Celestial Clarity** (天明转),\n10. **Transformation of Fully Attained** (具足转).\n\nThe **Five Dao Fruits** are as follows:\n1. **Earthly Immortal Fruit** (地仙果),\n2. **Flying Immortal Fruit** (飞仙果),\n3. **Self-Sovereign Fruit** (自在果),\n4. **Leakless Fruit** (无漏果),\n5. **Non-Action Fruit** (无为果).\n\nIf one cultivates through **alchemical practices**, abstaining from grains, refining **essence** and **Dao-flavor** (道味), aspiring to **mountain seclusion**, hiding their form in retreat, consuming **dew and qi**, rejecting **rich nourishment**, lightening the body and strengthening vitality, avoiding **aging and death**, wandering in **Dao-nature**, not consuming living beings, practicing **compassionate laws**, or if born into noble families, residing in splendor, free from illness, sustaining **long-term vegetarian fasting**, abandoning lust, and practicing as above—then they attain the **Earthly Immortal Fruit**.\n\nIf one performs **auspicious deeds**, safeguards **preceptual conduct**, never transgressing, maintaining **upright body and mind**, abstaining from **root desires**, skillfully holding the **Six Senses**, untouched by **defilements**, aligning actions with **principle**, not exceeding **measure**, wandering on **famed peaks**, feasting on **clouds and mist**, fortifying the mind, unmoved—even if they do not broadly hear **profound Dao-sounds**, yet they uphold **pure precepts** like a **lucent crystal**, clear within and without—then they attain the **Flying Immortal Fruit**.\n\nIf one masters **prohibitions and decorum**, their **conduct** and **mind** align with **rules**, revered by **heavenly and human**, all offering **sustenance**, their **spiritual power** transforming without limit, their **intentions** fulfilled—without consuming **elixirs**, naturally sated—if they wish to eat, it manifests by **thought alone** in this world, their **form and thoughts** unrestrained, wandering **mountains and marshes** without fear, perpetually cultivating **auspicious deeds**, their **form** responding to **sensations**, their **mind** steadfast as **mountains**, mastering **spiritual penetration**, meditating on **subtle stillness** within **subtle stillness**, able to **divide their form**, responding to countless calls—then they attain the **Self-Sovereign Fruit**.\n\nIf one **penetrates all laws**, discerning **heart-mind distinctions** without error, benefiting infinitely, entering **void and form**, receiving all **scriptures**, free from **afflictions**, abandoning **greed, anger, and attachment**, purifying the **Six Entries**, severing the **Three Bonds**, enlightened and penetrating, **eloquent in teaching**, broadly liberating beings—within this **lifetime** and future **kalpas**, never regressing, ascending **graded stages** to the **Supreme Path**—then through diligent cultivation, they attain the **Leakless Dao Fruit**.\n\nThe **Non-Action Fruit** is entering the **Supreme Stillness Path** (寂无上法门). **Stillness** is **Non-Action**; **Non-Action** is **Stillness**. **Stillness** is neither birth nor death, thus **eternal life**; it is neither destruction nor change, thus **adaptive response**. **Non-Action** is **Action**; **Action** is **Non-Action**. Through **Non-Action**, **Action** arises; through **Action**, one enters the **Non-Action realm**—this is **responsive harmony**.\n\n**Responsive harmony** is **Stillness**; through **Stillness**, **responsive harmony** arises; through **responsive harmony**, one returns to **Stillness**—subtle and unfathomable, **spiritual power** beyond thought, exhausting **profound depths**, hence called **Liberation**—this is the **Supreme Fruit of Non-Action**.\n\nThe **Five Fruits** perfected, the **Ten Transformations** fulfilled—then one departs the **Three Realms’ bonds**, ascends to the **Nine Pure Ones**, attains the **Way of the Supreme One**, succeeds the **Law Sovereign’s station**, severs the **evil roots** forever, gathers all **virtues**, and illuminates the **Three Penetrations** with clarity, piercing the **Five Eyes**.\n\nNot **body** apart from **body**, nor **not-body**—yet with **one form** pervading the **Six Paths**.\nNot **mind** apart from **mind**, nor **not-mind**—yet with **one thought** encompassing all **dharma**.\n\nLiberating all beings’ **nature** reveals the **True Way’s nature**; **one aspect without aspect**, taking this as **Non-Being**, yet alone able to be the **origin of all things**.\n\nThus, by this principle, it is called **Primordial Origin**.\n\nThough it abides near all things, the **Way** stands alone supreme. Constantly dwelling in the **Three Pure Ones**, it transcends all heavens. The **eight directions**, the **five hundred myriads** of heavens—all reverence it, hence called **Heavenly Sovereign**.\n\nThe **Sovereign’s** name has many titles; briefly, the **Five Designations**:\nThe **Sovereign of Dao/Virtue**, the **Sovereign of Wisdom and Benevolence**, the **Sovereign of Divine Powers**, the **Sovereign of Purity and Marvel**.\n\nIts **merits and virtues** are vast—praise cannot exhaust them.\n\nThe **Tang Emperor** asked: *\"What are the ranks of the Heavenly Sovereign’s titles?\"*\nThe **Master** replied: *\"According to the *Lingbao Scriptures* and the *Three Realms Diagrams*: The **Way** has the **Three Pure Ones** and the **Three Realms**.\n\nThe **Three Pure Ones’ domains** are **Jade Pure**, **Upper Pure**, and **Supreme Pure**; the **Three Realms** are the **Realm of Desire**, the **Realm of Form**, and the **Realm of Formlessness**.\n\nBelow, the **Realm of Desire** has **six heavens**; within it, the **Realm of Form** has **eighteen heavens**; above, the **Realm of Formlessness** has **four heavens**.\n\nAbove the **Three Realms**, there are **four human-heavenly realms**, totaling **thirty-two heavens**.\n\nFrom the **four human-heavens** downward, within the **Three Realms**, one is still subject to the **three calamities** and **effacing ages**.\n\nFrom the **Realm of Formlessness** upward, the **three calamities** do not reach, nor do the **ages** interfere.\n\nWithin the **Three Pure Ones’ domains**, each has a heaven: **Pure Mists Heaven**, **Yu Remnant Heaven**, and **Great Red Heaven**.\n\nThese **Three Pure Ones and Three Realms**, each with their **heavenly emperors**, **true immortals of rank**, and countless attendants—too numerous to recount.\n\nAbove them, the **Great Luo Heaven** envelops the **Three Pure Ones**, making **thirty-six heavens** in total: the **Three Pure Ones**, **Great Luo**, and the **Three Realms**.\n\nWithin **Great Luo Heaven** lies **Jade Capital Mountain**, atop which stands a **seven-treasured city**, twenty-four myriads of *li* in circumference, twenty-four thousand *li* high.\n\nWithin the city is the **seven-treasured Mysterious Platform**, a **nine-million-tiered terrace**, rising three hundred sixty *li* above the city.\n\nUpon the terrace grow **seven-treasured trees**, eight stalks each rising seven hundred twenty *li* above the terrace. Their branches and leaves spread beyond the city’s eight directions, infinite.\n\nTheir roots and trunks are of **gold and silver**, their branches of **pearls and jade**, their leaves of **coral and night-pearl**, their fruits of **□□, agate, lapis lazuli, and amber**, interwoven with gold, silver, pearls, and jade.\n\nWhen the slightest breeze stirs the branches, the leaves gleam resplendent, their praise unfathomable, their radiance dazzling the eyes. The **four spirits** gather in reverence, their palaces and towers beyond description.\n\nHeavenly emperors, **Great Saints**, **Heavenly Sovereigns**, **Mystery-Walking True Ones**, **Immortal Boys and Jade Girls**—all attend in service, sweeping, burning incense, scattering flowers.\n\n**Lion-dogs** repel evil, **divine dragons and vermilion phoenixes** soar. **Spiritual beasts** guard in myriad kinds.\n\nThe mountain yields **five-colored flowing springs** and **nine-colored luminous light**, illuminating the **Great Luo multitudes** above, where the **Primordial Dao’s Heavenly Sovereign** resides.\n\nThus, the *Scripture of Salvation* says:\n*\"Above the Three Realms, vast and boundless is Great Luo—\nAbove formlessness, misty peaks rise—\nOnly the Primordial Origin remains,\nThe unshaken home of the Great Effacing.\"*\n\nThis is what is meant.\n\nOn the **Three Five and Eight Festivals**, and all **fasting days**, the **Ten Directions’ Saints**, heavenly emperors, **Mystery-Walking True Ones**, and countless **unnumbered multitudes**—all don **heavenly威羽服**, each with **ten thousand myriads**, riding **clouds and dragons**, playing **heavenly grand music**, singing in harmony, their **ten-perfect spirit banners** drifting through the void as they ascend to the **Celestial Gathering**, paying homage to the **Jade Capital Primordial Heavenly Sovereign**.\n\nAll the **Saints** burn incense in worship, flying through the **void**, singing of the **Celestial Capital’s** splendor, marveling at its **palaces’** famed grandeur.\n\nThe **Saints** gather in awe—beyond naming.\n\nAgain, the *Scripture of the Multitudes* says:\n*\"The Supreme Dao’s Great Sovereign, the Highest Jade Emperor, the Ten Directions’ Ultimate Truth—\nAll ride **five-colored jade wheels**, **lingyu carriages**, **spirit-pearl chariots**, **ten-perfect feathered canopies**, and **three-white flowing clouds**.\nHeavenly Great Saints, **Mystery-Walking True Ones**—all ride **Azure Mist**, **Nine Spirits’ flowing light**, **flying-cloud jade carriages**, celebrating the **Four Celestial Gatherings**, the **Three Dawns’ fragrance**, **flying incense’s eight convergences**, **lightning’s flashing brilliance**, **flower-essence bathing the sun**, the **three luminaries’ convergence**, **divine clouds’ radiance**, and the **Primordial’s flowing light**.\n\nFrom the **Five Emperors’ spirits**, the **Mulberry Grove Thousand Trues**, **lion-dogs and white geese**, **tigers, leopards, dragons, and unicorns**—\n**Spiritual consorts** scatter flowers, **golden boys** waft incense, the **five paths** open, the **three realms’ ferries** connect.\nThey wander the **cloud paths**, singing the **Ten Heavens**, ascending to the **Three Pure Ones’ Great Luo** above, the **Supreme Mysterious Jade Capital’s Cold Spirit Hall**, the **Purple Micro Upper Palace**, donning **heavenly treasure羽服**, presenting themselves beneath the **Primordial Heavenly Sovereign’s golden gate**, to receive the *Primordial Lingbao Red Book Jade Chapter True Texts*.\n\nThe **Heavenly Sovereign** manifests the **divine form**, taking the **Way** as **body**—not relying on **contingent causes**, yet without dependence.\n\nThus, the *Scripture of Boundless* says:\n*\"Primordial Origin at the **Ancient Effacing**—\nTransforming to birth all heavens,\nOpening the **three luminaries**—this is the **heavenly root**.\nAbove, no further ancestor—\nOnly the **Way** as **body**,\nResponding to transform and save,\nDisplaying the **Name of the Boundless**,\nRetreating traces to return to **True One**—\nThen serene, it becomes **One**.\n\nBecause all heavens revere it, it is called **Heavenly Sovereign**.\nAs the **root of all things**, it is called **Primordial Origin.**\"\n\nThe **Sages of All Truths**, in strict accordance with the Daoist scriptures, are those who:\n\nFirst, from the realm of the mundane, **learn the Dao** and **hold fast to its laws and precepts**, never failing in their practice—then they are **enrolled in the Celestial Register of Immortals**, gaining entry to the **Luminous Mountains and Sacred Caverns of the Five Peaks**.\n\nFrom the **Sacred Caverns**, advancing **without interruption in their studies**, they ascend to the **Heavens of the Realm of Desire**.\n\nFrom the **Heavens of the Realm of Desire**, progressing **without interruption in the Dao**, they attain the **Heavens of the Realm of Form**.\n\nFrom the **Heavens of the Realm of Form**, advancing **without interruption in the Dao**, they reach the **Heavens of the Realm of Formlessness**.\n\nFrom the **Heavens of the Realm of Formlessness**, advancing **without interruption in the Dao**, they ascend to the **Four Kinds of Human-Heavenly Realms**.\n\nFrom the **Four Kinds of Human-Heavenly Realms**, advancing **without interruption in the Dao**, they attain the **Supreme Three Heavens**.\n\nFrom the **Supreme Three Heavens**, advancing **without interruption in the Dao**, they ascend to the **Highest Great Luo Heaven**.\n\nYet, from the **Heavens of the Realm of Formlessness and below**, if one does not **pursue and refine the Supreme Dao**, then the **proximity or distance of kalpas** will vary, and the **Three Calamities** will befall them—**not escaping the fate of the kalpas**.\n\nFrom the **Four Kinds of Human-Heavenly Realms** and above, they have reached the **ultimate fruit of the Dao**, forever unshaken in their **Sacred Abodes**, **conjoined with the Dao in True Reality**, perpetually abiding in **Serene Supreme Bliss**.\n\nThe **Tang Heavenly Sovereign** asked: *\"What are the names of those below the **Highest Dao Sovereign**?\"*\n\n**Pan the Venerable Master** replied: *\"The **True Path** is profound and mysterious, transcending all **phenomenal forms and colors**. Its manifestations are vast and boundless, hence the distinction between the **Three Pure Ones** and the **Three Realms**, and the differentiation of the **Nine Earthly Regions** and **Nine Celestial Levels**.\n\nThe **Heavenly Palaces and Abodes** each possess their own **domain and expanse**, some grand, some modest—**too numerous to recount**.\n\nNow, in accordance with the *Scripture of Boundless Salvation*, there are **Thirty-Two Heavens**, each with its own **Palace and Abode** where the **Thirty-Two Celestial Emperors** reside, all within their respective **Heavenly Realms**.\n\n**The Dao Gate’s Scriptures on the Transmission of Laws and Precepts, Volume One, completed.**\n**The Dao Gate’s Scriptures on the Transmission of Laws and Precepts, Volume Two,

**Taqing Wondrous Realm**, the place of **Ultimate Bliss**.\n\nThe **Tang Heavenly Sovereign** asked:\n*\"How many forms does the Celestial Venerable have? I, your disciple, cannot endure the hardships of the Dao and dare not repeatedly petition the Celestial Venerable for protection.\"*\n\nThe Celestial Master replied:\n\n*\"It may be named yet not named, thus attaining the truth beyond all speech;\nThe Great Form is formless, thus ascending to the Mysterious between nothingness.\nIf only vague and indistinct, lost in the murk of sentient beings,\nthere would be no need for manifestations and titles—\nyet symbols are established and names bestowed,\nso that all conscious beings may have their proper refuge.\n\nSince beginningless time, through countless kalpas,\nthe Sage’s titles have been without end.\nThough not exhaustively recorded in scriptures,\nthey are indeed chronicled in a hundredth part—\nand those matters clearly manifest,\nthe *Separate Record of the Five Hundred Celestial Venerables*,\nis presented accordingly.\n\nAccording to the scriptures’ teachings,\nthe Celestial Venerable possesses:\nthe **Dharma-body**, the **Original-body**, the **Dao-body**, the **True-body**, the **Trace-body**, the **Manifestation-body**, the **Fractional-body**, and the **Transformation-body**.\n\nCarefully examining the *Supreme Scripture of Unveiling the Secret Treasure*:\nThe Supreme One spoke:\n*'This scripture is named *Unveiling the Secret Treasure*,\nits meaning like that of the peerless Dharma King—\nemerging from the Five Turbidities,\ntransforming all sentient beings in their threefold karma,\ndemonstrating expedient means with skillful intent,\nsubtly hidden yet difficult to comprehend.\n\nThus, the demonstration:\nThe wondrous bodies attained by the Celestial Venerables of the ten directions\nare the true essence of the Dao’s form,\nnaturally formless and nameless,\nneither fabricated nor contrived—\ntheir law is like the emptiness of space.\nThrough countless kalpas,\nthey have long verified this same law—\none undivided essence, yet able to manifest\nvarious Dharma-bodies,\nteaching sentient beings of the six realms\nto cultivate retribution and transformation,\nfree from worldly suffering and fear,\ntheir power and transformations boundless,\nbeyond conception—\nthis is called the *Secret Treasure of the Unveiled Body*.\n\nWithin the Celestial Venerable’s true and real nature,\nbeyond all spoken extinction,\nskillfully employing causes and conditions,\nthey distinguish and display teachings endlessly,\ntheir words ordered, meanings profound—\nsometimes expounding the Three Vehicles,\nleading to heavenly retribution,\ngradually transforming all to return to the One True Dao—\nthis is called the *Secret Treasure of the Unveiled Speech*.\n\nThough free from thought and discrimination,\nwith all-knowing wisdom penetrating the true gate of emptiness,\nexhausting the limits of principle,\nequal to the true and real,\nwith all-knowing wisdom illuminating human laws—\ncolor is not a law, mind is not a mind-law,\nthe Five Paths of human and heavenly realms,\nthe Four Great Elements and Six Dusts,\nsentient beings’ thoughts and retributions,\ncausal conditions—\nall are clearly understood in a single thought,\ndiscerning roots and nature,\nacting as appropriate,\npenetrating to the utmost intent—\nthis is called the *Secret Treasure of the Unveiled Mind*.\n\nThrough these three kinds of secret laws,\nthe True Dao-body is perfected—\nnot something ordinary mortals or the Nine Stars can comprehend.\n\nThe Celestial Venerable of the **Dharma-body**:\nCarefully examining the *Scripture of Ascending to the Mysterious*:\n*'I, with the Three Qi circulating the eight extremes,\nam called Yuan Shi, or Lao Jun, or Tai Shang,\nor Imperial Teacher, or Mysterious Sovereign—\nentering the obscure, emerging from the void,\nresponding without bounds,\nadapting to the people’s desires,\nthus manifesting the Dharma-body.\nThe convergence of all paths is not for different causes—\nthe foolish fail to grasp this,\nyet the wise recognize it.\nI pity those who speak in vain,\ndaring to reveal its source.\n\nThe Dao’s diffusion of qi\nlies in the boundless, formless, imageless—\nscriptures remain, yet not adorned by artifice.\nOnly through sincere self-cultivation\ndoes one attain the true form,\nand upon attaining the true form,\nnaturally ascending to the morning.\"*\n\nThis law is profound and recondite—profound beyond profundity—\nthe foolish lose their way, some calling it not divine,\nmocking and competing, attacking the root and uprooting it.\n\nAccording to the *Supreme Dao’s Perfection of the Ultimate Unsurpassed Dao Collection Scripture*:\nAt that time, the Celestial Worthies of the Ten Directions\ncame to this land, dwelling according to their realms,\neach within the halls reciting praises thus:\n\n*\"The Primordial, Supreme, First and Highest Sovereign,\ntranscending the Ten Directions without equal.\nThrough countless kalpas, accumulating wondrous deeds,\npossessing perfect purity and boundless virtue and blessings.\nAll defilements and habitual bonds severed,\npast karma exhausted, no new deeds created.\nDivine powers and might unobstructed,\npenetrating the Three Realms, awakening to the True.\nPerfect wisdom and all virtues gathered—\nthis wondrous law is made into the body.\"*\n\nThe Original Body Celestial Worthies, according to the *Treasure of the Mysterious Scripture*:\nThe Supreme One said: *\"The Original is quiescent yet responsive, true and false differ,\nprovisional and real—all marvels arise from the Mysterious Gate.\"*\n\nAgain, according to the *Supreme Opening of the Secret Treasury Scripture*:\nThe Imperial Lord said: *\"This Original Body, able to generate all things,\nis itself the Original Beginning of all things—\nwhat difference is there between this and the Divine Origin?\"*\n\nThe Supreme One replied:\n*\"Its source and substance are without duality.\nWhy? Both are ultimately so—\nwithout beginning or end, unspeakable.\nThrough skillful means, distinctions may be spoken of.\nWhat is called the Divine Origin is mere imagined things—\na single thought’s continuation,\nand the wheel of sentient beings’ karma turns endlessly—\nthis is called recognizing things, also called the Divine Origin.\nWhat is called the Original Body is the Dao-nature.\nThe pure mind, able to do all things,\nis the root of all dharmas—\nthus called the Original Beginning.\nThis is true nature—\nneither mind nor non-mind, neither form nor non-form.\nWithout entangling deliberation, thus not impermanent—\nhence called non-mind;\nyet it generates mind, knowing nothing—\nalso called mind.\nWithout acquisition, thus called non-form;\nyet it generates form, seen by the Dao-eye—\nalso called form.\nThis pure mind possesses all virtues,\nboundless merit, accomplished wisdom,\never-abiding, self-so, serene and blissful—\nyet obscured by defilements, thus not yet realized—\nhence called nature.\nIf through skillful means one severs all defilements,\nthe obstructions exhausted, clarity revealed—\nthis is called the Original Body.\nSuch a body is inherently possessed,\nnot newly created—\nthus called Original.\nNot a fixed nature, not the Three Times*—\nyet encompassing expedient speech—\nthus not the Three Times.\nOriginally existing—hence called Past.\nAll sentient beings will inevitably attain it—\nhence called Future.\nThe Great Saints of the Ten Directions have already obtained it—\nhence called Present.\nThough spoken of as having the Three Times,\nits essence is unchanging, ever-abiding and unaltered.\"*\n\nThe Dao-Body Celestial Worthies, according to the *Supreme Spirit-Treasury Scripture of Infinite Salvation*:\n*\"In the Primordial Ancestral kalpa,\nthe transformations gave birth to all heavens,\nilluminating the Three Lights*—\nthis is the Heavenly Root.\nAbove, no further Ancestor—\nonly the Dao as body.\"*\n\nAgain, according to the *Supreme Opening of the Secret Treasury Scripture*:\nThe Supreme Dao Lord and the countless Heavenly True Persons of Wondrous Practice\ntogether visited the Imperial Lord of Taiwei at the Jade Terrace above the Azure Mists,\nwithin the Golden Flower Chamber.\nThe Taiwei Emperor kowtowed: *\"Lord Dao, I do not understand\nwhether the Celestial Worthies of the Three Times and Ten Directions,\nhaving obtained this wondrous body,\ndo so by the same law or by different bodies?\"*\n\nThe Supreme One replied:\n*\"The most true and wondrous principle—\nquiescent, formless, pure and serene—\nunspeakable.\nThrough skillful transformation, two paths are briefly opened:\nFirst, the Dao-Body’s quiescent, void essence;\nSecond, the Generated Body’s born and formed physique.\nWhat is called the Dao-Body:\nfree from all marks,\nperfect true wisdom fulfilled,\nsevering illusions,\nmystically harmonizing with the Mysterious Sovereign,\none with the Dao—\nneither extinction nor generation,\nno coming nor going,\ndiscourse ceases, thoughts exhausted.\"*\n\nThe Emperor bowed: *\"I do not understand—\nis the Dao-Body itself the quiescent Original,\nor is there another called the Original?\"*\n\nThe Supreme One replied:\n*\"The Dao is the Sacred Original,\nthe Original is the Dao’s root—\nthough one in essence, not without two sources.\nThe Dao stands alone,\nits body naturally void and penetrating,\nstrongly named without dependence.\nFar-reaching and still, its function exhausted—\nthe Original faces the End,\nrelying on provisional names,\ncalled the Origin of things,\nits use generating.\nAlso called the Trace-Original,\ndynamic and quiescent in function,\nappearing and vanishing beyond things,\nsilent and dependent on marks.\"*\n\nThen the Dao Lord wished to reveal the Mysterious Principle\nand spoke again in verse:\n\n*\"The Dao-Body neither generates nor perishes,\nfollowing its nature, naturally profound and penetrating.\nSerene and ever pure,\nindependent—strongly called void.\nCutting off names, needing no counterpart,\nyet falsely creating things’ functions.\nSilent and still, exhausting meaning’s use,\nsolemn and quiescent, guarding the void’s surge.\"*\n\nThe True-Body Celestial Worthies, according to the *Scripture of the Immortal’s Questions*:\n*\"Those who attain the Dao’s worthiness\ndo so through accumulating virtue and doing good,\nrefining the body and tempering the spirit—\nthus achieving the True.\"*\n\nAgain, according to the *Supreme Scripture of Resolving Doubts*:\n*\"The Primordial Celestial Worthies, at the time of the Coherent Dawn,\nstood upon the Linguan Terrace,\nwith the Supreme Dao Lord and twelve hundred million Childlike Saints\nseated together on the White Jade Lion Throne,\nall proclaiming secret essences,\nopening wondrous gates—\nonly Celestial Worthies of the same practice,\nthose who walk the Dao’s path together,\nwere present at this assembly.\nWith divine power, they shook the great earth,\nspinning and revolving,\nstartling the hearts of all things.\nAt that time, the three kinds of malevolent beings\nall obtained respite,\nand the rewards of humans and devas\nwere each augmented—\nfree from all sufferings, obstacles, and calamities,\nnear and far, all gathered instantly—\ntheir numbers boundless, beyond reckoning.\nThen the great assembly, in unison,\ngazed upon the Dao Lord,\ntheir eyes never blinking,\nand recited this verse:\"*\n\nThe Primordial Supreme Lord of Heaven and Humankind,\nnow abandons great compassion and departs from birth and death.\nAlone returning to the wondrous, silent source of goodness,\nhe does not dwell in the world to benefit the dust of mortals.\n\nThe pure, unobstructed body of true wisdom—\nno metaphor or speech can liken it.\nNot something within our knowing or seeing,\nhow could we observe it and awaken to profound truth?\n\nThe Celestial Worthies of the trace-body,\ncarefully consulting the *Supreme Scripture of Unveiling the Secret Treasury*,\nasked: *\"Does the Dao Lord manifest both the birth-body and the trace-body?\"*\n\nThe Supreme Lord replied: *\"So it is. Birth and trace—\nboth are called 'opportunity,' benefiting without distinction,\nthus named 'manifestation.' Essence and function are not separate,\nnames differ according to meaning.*\n\n*The Dao Lord further asked: *\"Is the trace-body one with the Dharma or without?\"*\n\n*The Supreme Lord answered: *\"I do not say 'yes.' All things,\nin their nature, are without possession.\nHow could the trace-body be said to have Dharma?\nIf only a name is assumed, then it is both and not both—\nnot separate from its origin, hence called 'not having';\nseen by sentient beings, hence called 'having';\nno other substance, hence called 'not having';\nyet truly beneficial, hence called 'having.'\n\n*Like a bright mirror that reflects myriad forms,\nclear and distinct, yet the images within it\ncannot be fixed as having or not having—\nyet one may say the mirror holds images.\nWhen the minds of all beings are clear,\nthey see the true Dao-body’s reflection—\nlike still water without waves,\nreflecting sun, moon, stars, and flying birds,\nall clearly seen at the water’s depths,\nalong with their own shadow, distinct and bright.\n\n*These watery things and their shadows\nare neither truly real nor can be said not to exist.\nWhen all beings’ minds are clear and pure,\nthey see the Dao-body’s reflection—\njust so.\nThe true Dao is imprinted upon them,\nthus neither having nor unseen—\nhence it cannot be called 'not having.'\nLike one who pursues the past by tracing footsteps,\nyet finds neither the trace nor the person—\nneither one nor different.\nThe trace-body is the same.\n\n*Those who understand clearly,\nentering through the trace to awaken,\nsee the true Dao-body,\nknowing the trace-Dharma is nonexistent—\nthus it is called 'one.'\nNot that it does not rely on the trace,\nbut gradually attaining comprehension,\nestablishing fields of merit—\nthis is called 'different.'\n\n*Such is the Dao’s realm,\nnot something the vulgar or lowly saints can fathom.*\n\n*Then the Dao Lord wished to reveal this meaning,\nreciting another verse:*\n\n*The trace-body has no fixed form,\nits manifested body endures eternally.\nIt presses upon the Five Paths’ shapes,\nits form adapts to beauty or ugliness.\nPrioritizing its essence,\nit benefits without burden or neglect.\nSometimes it generates transformations,\nat times it follows father and mother.\nThe Celestial Worthies of the trace-body,\nconsulting the *Scriptures of the Old Lord’s Teachings*, say:\nThe Sacred and True are without constraint,\ntheir essence has two aspects:\nOne—Dao-qi descending to manifest form,\nharmonizing with mortals, yet mortals not yet returning to the root.\nTwo—when the vulgar cultivate with complete virtue,\ntheir spirit merges with manifestation,\nhidden yet unnamed.\n\n*The Dao responds to circumstances;\ncircumstances are without name,\nyet manifestations are named.\nNames differ, manifestations differ,\nyet the Dao remains the same—\naction never leaves stillness.*\n\n*Further, consulting the *Supreme Scripture of Resolving Doubts*, it says:\nThe Primordial Celestial Worthies declared,\n*\"For the sake of sentient beings, I manifest and receive form,\nentering the Five Paths, adapting to circumstances to guide them,\nusing expedient means to awaken all,\nconforming to their roots and nature,\ndemonstrating forms by expedient means—\nthus it is called the 'manifestation-body.'\nYet this manifestation-body\nhas neither birth nor death, coming nor going—\nit is ever-present, unchanging,\nbenefiting all, hidden or revealed,\narousing diligence so none retreat.\"*\n\n*At that time, the assembled immortals bowed repeatedly to the Dao Lord,\nreciting this verse:*\n\n*The Supreme, pure, and wondrous body of true wisdom,\nsilent and extinguished, formless—none can perceive it.\nOnly the manifestation-body returns to its source,\nthus all bear great sorrow and distress.\nRelying on the Supreme Lord of the Boundless,\nlike an orphan clinging to a father’s mercy,\nwe are immersed in the fire of suffering—\nwe pray for the timely rain of sweet dew.\nSevering inverted thoughts and clinging hearts,\ndissolving all views and evil inclinations.*\n\n*The Celestial Worthies of the divided-body,\nconsulting the *Scripture of the Spirit’s Degree and Fate*, say:\nThe Celestial Worthies divided their forms into a hundred million,\nsimultaneously present everywhere—\nmale or female, all seen within the Five-Colored Light,\nas though gathered in one place.\nWherever they appeared,\nthe young and old, male and female, all prostrated in homage.\n\n*The Celestial Worthies, according to each land,\nexpounded the Ten Marvelous Sutras,\ninstructed in prohibitions,\nand declared distinctions between male and female.*\n\n*At that time, the young and old from the four borders,\nwithout exception, offered gold and silver,\nfive-colored patterned silks, jewels, and treasures—\ncountless beyond measure—to present to the Celestial Worthies,\nreceiving the precepts and venerating the sutras.*\n\n*For seven days and seven nights,\nthe light shone brightly, dispelling darkness,\nand the four directions returned to normal.\nThe treasures of faith filled the land,\nand the Celestial Worthies at once distributed to the destitute—\nthe hungry were filled, the poor lacked nothing,\nrich and poor became equal,\nand no one harbored resentment.\nThe Celestial Records noted those with prior merit,\ninscribing their names on golden tablets,\ngranting them world-transcendence,\nflight through the void,\nentrance into the Dao-gate,\nand longevity of thirty-six thousand years.*\n\n*Further, consulting the *Supreme Scripture of the Ultimate Peak’s Most Victorious and Unequaled Dao Collection*, it says:\nThe Primordial Celestial Worthies remained motionless for three days and three nights,\ntheir faculties silent, entering profound stillness,\ngazing into the wondrous gate.\nAll the great assembly likewise stood upright,\ngazing upon the Lord’s countenance,\nnot a single misstep.\n\n*After three days, the Primordial Celestial Worthies raised their body in smile,\ntheir entire form radiating golden light,\nilluminating the assembly in pure gold,\nand emitted a subtle voice in praise of the Dao Lord:*\n*\"Excellent! Excellent!\nMy true child,\nable to inherit the honored position,\nteaching and transforming sentient beings,\nopening the gate of expedient means—\njust as I.\"*\n\nThe Ten-Quadrant Celestial Worthies all rejoiced in harmony.\n\nThe Primordial Celestial Worthies manifested a palace of a hundred billion golden halls, resplendent in height and grandeur, adorned with lawful seats and ornate decorations, equal in splendor as before. All the ten-quadrant lands were contained within the palace.\n\nThe Manifested-Body Celestial Worthies of the ten-quadrant realms, upon seeing this radiance, gathered at once, their retinues assembled to expound the Dao’s rites and praise the Dao Lord.\n\nThe Manifested-Body Celestial Worthies—*as recorded in the Scripture of Fixed Resolution*—were once twelve young disciples dwelling in the world, indulging in worldly pleasures. Day by day, they gathered to share meals, engage in play and sightseeing, or debate the ease and difficulty of the Dao. The Celestial Worthies, perceiving through the Dao-Eye their past lives as humans who had hoarded scriptures in secret, saw their disciples’ hesitant hearts toward the Dao as well. Thus, they seized the opportunity to guide them, for even such hearts could be transformed.\n\nThereupon, the Celestial Worthies assumed the form of a common mortal passing through the assembly to beg for alms. Addressing the gathered disciples, the transformed figure said: *\"To uphold the precepts is easy; to violate them is difficult.\"* The disciples, hearing these words, all fell silent in contemplation.\n\nThey asked the transformed figure: *\"How is it that you say upholding the precepts is easy, while not upholding them is so difficult?\"*\n\nThe transformed figure replied: *\"To stand upright as the precepts demand—one need not fear kings nor ghosts and spirits. How is this not easy? But those who violate the precepts fear all men, and fear ghosts and spirits as well. How could this not be difficult?\"*\n\nThus, the twelve young disciples, now stirred by the Dao, each reflected deeply and came to understand the law’s meaning.\n\n*The Scripture of Supreme Decision on Doubts* states: The Primordial Celestial Worthies spoke to Xu Lai Le: *\"With the Dao-Eye, I observe from the silent realm the myriad beings. Those who can discern the truth, I grant them the seal of the Law. Those who follow my teachings—I shall manifest countless forms, appearing in the realms of humans and heavens, acting as expedient means to guide and protect them, appearing and vanishing in an instant. Now, without hesitation, you must take this true seal of the Law and universally teach the celestial and human beings, ensuring all attain knowledge and follow the Law in practice.\"*\n\nThe True Person of the Great Polarity bowed in reverence and accepted the command.\n\nThe Tang Emperor asked: *\"The Dao’s law is here; in the heavens, is it the ultimate? Or is there another place?\"*\n\nPan the Venerable Master answered: *\"According to the *Secrets of Ascending the True* and the *Scripture of the True Soul’s Rank and Vocation*, the following are the Celestial Worthies of the Jade Purity realm:\n\n- **Upper Elemental Worthies:**\n  - The Highest Upper Elemental Jade-Clear Purple-Void Supreme Primordial Dao Lord,\n  - The Three-Elemental Void-Emptiness Supreme Brightness Upper Primordial Dao Lord,\n  - The Void-Clarity Purple-Lantern Middle Elemental Highest Supreme Eternal Sovereign Dao Lord,\n  - The Supreme Substance High-Void Supreme Extremity Purple Sovereign Dao Lord.\n\n  These are the four Dao Lords of the Jade Purity Upper Elemental Realm.\n\n- **Middle Elemental Worthies:**\n  - The Northern Mysterious Highest Void Sovereign Dao Lord,\n  - The Southern Vermilion Highest Void Sovereign Dao Lord,\n  - The Western Flower Highest Void Sovereign Dao Lord,\n  - The Eastern Brightness Highest Void Sovereign Dao Lord,\n  - The Middle Elemental Supreme Unity Void Sovereign Dao Lord,\n  - The Five Spirits Seven Luminaries Mixed-Generation Highest Dao Lord.\n\n  These are the six Dao Lords of the Jade Purity Middle Elemental Purple-Clarity Realm.\n\n- **Lower Elemental Worthies:**\n  - The Three-Elemental Supreme Mysterious Old Soul Primordial Dawn Sovereign,\n  - The Three-Elemental Four Extremities Upper Elemental Void Sovereign Primordial Spirit Sovereign,\n  - The Three-Elemental Dawn Central Yellow Illumination Void Sovereign Primordial Platform Sovereign,\n  - The Three-Elemental Purple Reflection Divine Spirit Void-Generated True Primordial Fetal Sovereign,\n  - The Jade-Mysterious Sovereign Dao Lord,\n  - The Upper Sovereign Dao Lord.\n\n  These are the six Elemental Worthies of the Jade Purity Lower Elemental Realm.\n\n- **Supreme Worthies of Jade Purity:**\n  - The Highest Dao Lord,\n  - The Jade Sovereign Dao Lord,\n  - The Jade-Mysterious Dao Lord,\n  - The Mysterious-Clarity Jade Sovereign,\n  - The Upper Sovereign Heavenly Emperor,\n  - The Supreme Void Sovereign Dao Lord,\n  - The Upper Sovereign High True Supreme King Sovereign,\n  - The Three Heavens Supreme Unity Primordial Sovereign.\n\n  These are the Worthies of Jade Purity, as recorded in the *Upper Clarity Scripture*, all revered in their ranks.

Within them are ranked gods, spirits, emperors, and empresses, with distinctions of high and low. They govern the winds and rains, oversee all spirits, and shine resplendently, overseeing the mortal realm below. All beings’ names and records are registered beneath them. The people’s virtues and vices are recorded in their deeds, and the spirits report them to the celestial bureaucracy. Those with meritorious deeds are inscribed in the Yellow Registers, while those with offenses are recorded in the Black Ledgers. When their merits reach three thousand, their names are transferred to the immortal register.\n\nNovices who practice virtue and establish merit rely on the righteous spirits of the six *jiǎ* (Heavenly Stems) and *zǐ* (Earthly Branches), have their sins erased, and are enrolled in the immortal ledgers. These are the spirit officials—all belong to the *Yǒuwéi* (Manifested) bureaucracy. They cannot be slighted, for if neglected, one will suffer in the next life. Thus, one must earnestly seek and petition, striving for early success. This is the initial gate of learning, not the highest path of the Great Vehicle.\n\nMoreover, those beginning from the mortal realm are still obstructed by demons. Therefore, they rely on the celestial officials of the sun, moon, and stars below, and the righteous *qi* of the six *jiǎ*, to subdue ghosts and spirits, dispel demons, and eliminate calamities. However, the ultimate fruit of initial practice is not as described. Disciples who receive the teachings follow the graded path—from gradual to sudden, from low to high. Thus, the Three Vehicles’ teachings differ in scale.\n\nAccording to the *Tàizhēn Kē*:\nThe *Míngwēi* (Oath of Power) is the Lower Grade, *Tàiqīng* is the Middle Grade, and *Shàngqīng Dàodé* is the Upper Grade—the three grades are the Three Vehicles.\n\nThose of low capacity first seek self-benefit but cannot yet save others. Thus, the Three Sovereigns and Cavernous Gods refine wisdom, progressing from near to far, clarifying that the body is the foundation of all virtues, and that self-salvation can extend to others.\n\nThose of medium capacity have clear wisdom, understanding that benefiting others is the path to self-benefit, and that self-cultivation is the foundation for saving others. Thus, the Middle Grade Cavernous Mysteries distinguish between the manifested and the void, achieving mutual benefit for self and others.\n\nWhen reaching *Dòngzhēn* (Penetrating Truth), the true and false merge, and self and other are transcended, leaving only the singular path.\n\nThus, those of middle and low capacity, at the start of their Daoist practice, establish merit and cultivate virtue through the *yīnyáng* (yin-yang), the six *jiǎ*, the sun, moon, and five stars. Some align with the body, others with benefiting beings—whether healing illnesses, curing diseases, rescuing the dying, or saving the living. Though these are acts of conditional merit, their blessings are vast, gradually increasing. When merit is complete, one does not dwell on it; when practice is fulfilled, one does not cling. One constantly performs hidden kindnesses, acting without expectation, aligning with the Dao, and ultimately attaining non-action.\n\nThe Tang Heavenly Sovereign asked: *\"The Dao’s laws reach their peak in this heaven—is there yet another realm?\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"According to the *Língbǎo Běnyuán Jīng*, the *Tàizhēn Kē*, and the *Zhūtiān Língshū Dùmìng Jīng*, it states:\nThe Three Realms and Three Purity domains comprise four kinds of Great Luo (transcendents). Below are the Twenty-Eight Heavens of the Three Realms, followed by the four kinds of Human Heavens, then the Three Supreme Heavens, and finally the Great Luo High-Covered Heaven.\n\nThe six *Yù* (Desire) realms—*Tàihuáng Chéngtiān* (Great Yellow Sovereign Heaven), *Tàimíng Yùwán Tiān* (Great Bright Jade Complete Heaven), *Qīngmíng Hé Tóng Tiān* (Clear Bright Harmony Child Heaven), *Xuāntāi Píngyù Tiān* (Primordial Womb Nurturing Heaven), *Yuánmíng Wénjǔ Tiān* (Primordial Bright Literary Ascension Heaven), and *Qīyào Móyí Tiān* (Seven Radiant Mo-Yi Heaven)—are yin-yang generated, with lifespans of ten thousand years.\n\nAbove them are the six *Xūwú* (Emptiness) realms—*Xūwú Yuèhéng Tiān* (Void Beyond Measure Heaven), *Tàijí Méngyì Tiān* (Great Extremes Obscured Heaven), *Chìmíng Héyáng Tiān* (Scarlet Bright Harmony Yang Heaven), *Xuānmíng Gōnghuá Tiān* (Mysterious Bright Reverent Splendor Heaven), *Yàomíng Zōngpiāo Tiān* (Radiant Bright Sovereign Drifting Heaven), *Zhúlòu Huángjiào Tiān* (Jade Fall Royal Horn Heaven), *Xūmíng Tángyào Tiān* (Void Bright Hall Radiance Heaven), *Guānmíng Duànjìng Tiān* (Observant Bright Tranquil Heaven), *Xuānmíng Gōngqìng Tiān* (Mysterious Bright Reverent Celebration Heaven), *Tàihuàn Jíyáo Tiān* (Great Splendor Extreme Jade Heaven), *Yuánzǎi Kǒngshēng Tiān* (Primordial Loaded Hollow Ascension Heaven), *Tàiān Huángyá Tiān* (Great Peace Royal Cliff Heaven), *Xiǎndìng Jífēng Tiān* (Manifest Destiny Extreme Wind Heaven), *Shǐhuáng Xiàománg Tiān* (First Sovereign Filial Brightness Heaven), *Tàihuáng Fǎngzhòng Tiān* (Great Sovereign Visiting Heavy Heaven), *Wúsī Jiāngyóu Tiān* (Non-Thought Jiang-You Heaven), *Shàngzhì Ruànlè Tiān* (Uppermost Auspicious Music Heaven), and *Wújí Duànshì Tiān* (Non-Extreme Tranquil Vow Heaven.\"*\n\n「To the right, the eighteen heavens of the Color Realm, where *yīnyáng* (yin-yang) manifest as hues, sharing the same origin as the Desire Realm yet not intermingling with it. Here, all beings are born through transformation, their lifespans accumulating to a hundred million years, yet they suffer neither decay nor harm.\n\nThe Radiant Court of the Celestial Path Heaven, the Abyssal Communion of the Primordial Cavern Heaven, the Graceful Favor of the Wondrous Completion Heaven, and the Refined Music of the Forbidden Ascension Heaven—these four are the heavens of the Formless Realm. Within them, *yīnyáng* (yin-yang) takes shape, with bodies stretching hundreds of *lǐ* (leagues), yet they do not weary from it. They can vanish their forms into subtlety, free from all color and desire, knowing only the straight path. Their years span countless *jié* (kalpas), yet though they do not study, they naturally act with benevolence, reaping the fruits of their merit.\n\nAs for the demon kings, even those whose learning is not yet perfected wander here, yet they cannot surpass the Three Realms, nor escape the great calamity.\n\nWhen the grand cycle turns, the twenty-eight heavens merge into one moment of chaos, like the mists of the *Gǔ* (Valley) of *Hóng* (Confusion). Among them, those who truly grasp the Dao are welcomed by the Holy Mother, ascending beyond the four heavens of *Chángróng* (Ever-Melting), *Yùlóng* (Jade-Surging), *Fàndù* (Dharma-Ascending), and *Jiǎyù* (Jade-Resounding).\n\nThose who attain the Dao as Holy True Ones within the Three Realms are returned to the human path, enduring the Three Trials. Those who advance further do so according to their merit.\n\nThe Heaven of Supreme Ever-Melting, the Heaven of Jade-Surging Triumph, the Heaven of Dragon-Transformation Dharma-Ascending, and the Heaven of Great Dao Tranquil Jade-Resounding—these four are the heavens of the Human Realm, known as the Four Dharma-Heavens. Their lifespans know no fixed limit, for they shift moment by moment, growing ever brighter each day. They do not depart these heavens when their span ends, nor descend to the Three Realms; their distance is measured within the middle. Those who cultivate *rénjìng* (benevolent purity) until their *xíqì* (habitual tendencies) are exhausted are born there.\n\nThe Daoist scriptures, passed down in succession, conclude their first volume.\n\nThe Daoist scriptures, passed down in succession, begin their second volume.\n\nThe Three Pure Ones’ realm starts below: the First is the Great Red Heaven, the Second is the Yu-Remainder Heaven, and the Third is the Pure Mists Heaven.\n\nThe three heavens above are called the Supreme Three Heavens, where those who have realized the Dao and attained the ultimate mysteries manifest in wondrous forms. Their divine powers are boundless, dwelling eternally unbroken. These are the origins of the Nine Pure Ones, condensed into one *qì* (breath/essence).\n\nBeyond this *qì* lies the Great Luo Heaven, the abode of the Primordial Origin Lord’s immovable essence. The *Sutra of Degrees* states: Above the Three Realms, the vast Great Luo, where no formless roots exist—its clouds rise in towering layers, and only the Primordial Origin’s boundless kalpas dwell there. This is called the Supreme. The three *yuán* (primordial cycles) and eight *jié* (nodes), the ten *zhí* (straight days) of *gēngshēn* (regeneration), and all such days of abstinence—when the ten thousand saints and five hundred million wondrous Daoist beings, countless as the stars, don their celestial law-garments, each leading ten million souls, ride upon the void, ascend with dragons, and perform the grand celestial music, singing with resounding voices, their ten thousand banners fluttering in unison—all drift through the empty sky and gather in the Mysterious Metropolis. The Mysterious Metropolis Great Luo Heaven lies above the Jade Capital Mountain.\n\nThe ten titles of the *Xuánzhōng* (Mysterious Metropolis) Grand Master differ from the previous ten titles:\n1. The Nameless Lord,\n2. The Supreme Mysterious Elder,\n3. The Highest Elder Lord,\n4. The Exalted Elder Sage,\n5. The Heavenly Sovereign Great Emperor,\n6. The Mysterious Metropolis Grand Master,\n7. The Ancient Sage,\n8. The Golden Gate Emperor Lord,\n9. The Formless True Person,\n10. The Highest Emperor of the Supreme.\n\nThis is from *The True Transmission*.\n\n1. The Great Dao,\n2. The Upright Truth,\n3. The Highest Sage,\n4. The Lord of the Dao,\n5. The Mysterious Elder,\n6. The Heavenly Lord,\n7. The Ten Saints,\n8. The True Saints,\n9. The Jade Emperor,\n10. The Law King.\n\nThe One Vehicle: According to *The Great True Science Sutra*, the Three Vehicles are interconnected, with varying applications. When one is astonished by their unity, it is called the One Vehicle Dao.\n\nThe One Mind: The scripture says, \"The mind attains stillness.\"\n\nThe Two Scenes: Refers to the sun and moon.\n\nThe Two *Qi*: Refers to *yīnyáng* (yin-yang).\n\nThe Two True Ones: The Left Mysterious True Person, the Right Mysterious True Person.\n\nThe Two *Yí*: The round heaven and the square earth.\n\nThe Two Volumes: The scripture says, \"For the sake of expounding the Dao and virtue, it is arranged in two volumes: the Dao Scripture above, the Virtue Scripture below.\"\n\nThe Two Wisdoms: The scripture says, \"The provisional and the real, saving the ignorant and the enlightened.\"\n\nThe Two Officials: Refers to the Highest Celestial and the Highest Spirit.\n\nThe Three Heavens: 1.

The Original *Qi* transforms into the Great Red Heaven.\n\nThe Three Worthies: The superior worthy attains the Dao and ascends to become a celestial official; the middle worthy attains the Dao and dwells on Kunlun; the inferior worthy attains the Dao and lives long in the mortal world. Again, the Three Worthies: The superior worthy’s *qi* surges, riding the sun and moon upon the void; the middle worthy’s transformation is hidden, seated yet present, standing yet absent; the inferior worthy’s extinction is complete, becoming a Wheel-Turning Sage King.\n\nThe Three Essences: The yang essence is the sun, the yin essence is the moon, and the harmonious essence is the stars.\n\nThe Three Palaces: The Left Palace of the Jade Purity, the Right Palace of the Jade Purity, and the Central Palace of the Jade Purity.\n\nThe Three *Qì*: 1. The golden *qì*, which governs the upper primordial and the heavens—heaven being *qián* (the creative), so the golden *qì* rules it, thus dispelling celestial calamities. 2. The yellow *qì*, which governs the lower primordial and the earth—earth being *kūn* (the receptive), which contains the yellow, so the yellow *qì* rules it, thus rescuing the seven ancestors, who might otherwise fear the underworld. 3. The white *qì*, which governs the central primordial and humanity—those who receive the *qì* are endowed with virtue, and jade embodies virtue, hence the white *qì* rules kings and nobles.\n\nThe Three Stages: Having, having-not, neither having nor not—these are the three stages of form. Having yin, having yang, having harmony—these are the three stages of *qi*. Having wisdom, having foolishness, having mediocrity—these are the three stages of divine consciousness. Having sharpness, having dullness, having balance—these are the three stages of talent and application.\n\nIn all, fifteen matters, sharing the same origin and *qi*. The Three Worlds: The past without limit, the future without limit, the present without limit. The Three Naturals: Those with sharp roots study the great naturalness, guard the void, and master transformation and death, becoming the ancestors of all ages.»\n\nThe **宗师** is the **Saint**.\n\nThe **平根** (mediocre-rooted) person studies the **Middle Naturalness**, guards the spirit and refines the form, and ascends as the **Celestial Official True Person**.\n\nThe **钝根** (dull-rooted) person studies the **Lesser Naturalness**, guards the yin-yang *qi*, grows feathers, and becomes a **Flying Immortal**.\n\nThe **Three Afflictions**: envy, slander, and greed.\n\nThe **Three Dantians**: the **赤子神** (Infant Spirit) at the brow, the **真人神** (True Person Spirit) at the heart, and the **婴儿神** (Infant Spirit) at the navel.\n\nThe **Three Dao**: the **Saintly Dao**, the **True Dao**, and the **Immortal Dao**.\nAgain, the **Three Dao**: the **Great Dao of the Limitless**, the **Great Dao of the Supreme**, and the **Great Dao of Non-Action**.\n\nThe **Three Elements**: the **Upper Element** (eight days), the **Middle Element** (eight days), the **Lower Element** (eight days).\n\nThe **Three Souls**: the **爽灵** (Luminous Soul), the **胎光** (Fetal Light), and the **幽精** (Mysterious Essence).\n\nThe **Three Poisons** (distinct from the prior three): lust, wrath, and delusion.\n\nThe **Three Vehicles of Learning and Practice**:\n- The **Lesser Vehicle** studies the **Cavern Spirit**, attains the Dao, and becomes an **Immortal**.\n  The **Nine Ranks of Immortals**:\n  1. **Upper Immortal** (male: **皇**, female: **后**)\n  2. **High Immortal** (male: **帝**, female: **后**)\n  3. **Great Immortal** (male: **王**, female: **妃**)\n  4. **Divine Immortal** (male: **公**, female: **妃**)\n  5. **Mysterious Immortal** (male: **卿**, female: **夫人**)\n  6. **True Immortal** (male: **大夫**, female: **夫人**)\n  7. **Celestial Immortal** (male: **士**, female: **妻**)\n  8. **Spiritual Immortal**\n  9. **Ultimate Immortal** (male: **士**, female: **妻**)\n\n- The **Middle Vehicle** studies the **Cavern of the Mysterious**, attains the Dao, and becomes a **True One**.\n  The **Nine Ranks of True Ones**:\n  1. **Upper True One**\n  2. **High True One**\n  3. **Great True One**\n  4. **Divine True One**\n  5. **Wondrous True One**\n  6. **Celestial True One**\n  7. **Immortal True One**\n  8. **Spiritual True One**\n  9. **Ultimate True One**\n\n- The **Great Vehicle** studies the **Cavern of the True**, attains the Dao, and becomes a **Saint**.\n  The **Nine Ranks of Saints**:\n  1. **Upper Saint**\n  2. **High Saint**\n  3. **Great Saint**\n  4. **Divine Saint**\n  5. **Mysterious Saint**\n  6. **Immortal Saint**\n  7. **True Saint**\n  8. **Spiritual Saint**\n  9. **Ultimate Saint**\n\nThe **Three Sovereigns**: Heaven, Earth, and Man.\n\nThe **Three Symbols**: **玄气** (Mysterious *Qi*) is green, **元气** (Primordial *Qi*) is white, **始气** (Original *Qi*) is yellow.\n\nThe **Three Vows**:\n  1.

Like **emptiness congealing** (虚凝)—the **Dao/Way** ever pure and serene, its singular essence manifest—**\"Non-Existence\"** (无) is **\"Existence\"** (有), for **true wisdom** (真慧) reveals past, present, and future, whether **saints** (若圣) or **common folk** (若凡), **causes** (若因) or **effects** (若果), the cycles of **heavens and earth**, the rise and fall of **kalpas**, the purity and defilement of all phenomena—knowing them all clearly, this is called **\"Wisdom’s Attainment\"** (谓之慧得).\n\n**The Threefold Naturals (三自然):\n  Their distinctions were previously mentioned.\n  1. **Natural Unity** (一体自然)—**emptiness congealing** (虚凝) and **true constancy** (真常).\n  2. **Natural Response** (应自然)—the **harmonious movement of *qi*** (和气升降).\n  3. **Natural Reception** (受自然)—the **Five Phases** (青黄赤白黑).\n\n**The Twenty-Eight Constellations (二十八宿):\n  - East: **Jiao (角)**, **Xing (亢)**, **Fang (房)**, **Xin (心)**, **Wei (尾)**, **Ji (箕)**.\n  - South: **Jing (井)**, **Gui (鬼)**, **Liu (柳)**, **Xing (星)**, **Zhang (张)**, **Yi (翼)**, **Zhen (轸)**.\n  - West: **Kui (奎)**, **Luo (娄)**, **Wei (胃)**, **Mao (昴)**, **Bi (毕)**, **Zui (觜)**, **Shen (参)**.\n  - North: **Dou (斗)**, **Niu (牛)**, **Nü (女)**, **Xu (虚)**, **Wei (危)**, **Shi (室)**, **Bi (壁)**.\n\n**The Five Stars (五星):\n  - East: **Sui Star** (岁星, *Jupiter*).\n  - South: **Yinghuo Star** (荧惑, *Mars*).\n  - West: **Tai Bai Star** (太白, *Venus*).\n  - North: **Chen Star** (辰星, *Saturn*).\n  - Central: **Zhen Star** (镇星, *Polaris*).\n\n**The Six Months of Abstinence (六斋月):**\n  The **first**, **third**, **fifth**, **seventh**, **ninth**, and **eleventh** months.\n  The **Three Celestial Orders** (三官) and the **Celestial Sovereign** (天帝) of the **Upper Three Heavens** (上三天) oversee and inspect the sins of mortals throughout the year.

Celestial Sovereign resides in the Jade-Yu Heavenly Palace (贾奕天上, 七宝紫微宫中), teaching the **Mysterious Law** (妙法) to **700 billion beings** (七千亿众). Among them, a **True Person named Sea-Empty Wisdom-Hoard** (海空智藏) knelt in homage and inquired:\n*\"How do mortals who aspire to the Dao/Way attain enlightenment? What are the ranks and transformations—from the Three Pure Ones to the Ten Transmutations—and their respective titles?\"* (玄门众生，发心入道，阶级升降，三清十转名号).\n\nAt that time, the Celestial Sovereign instructed **Sea-Empty Wisdom-Hoard** (海空智藏):\n\n*\"You must understand that the **Great Saints of the Ten Directions** (十方大圣) enter the Dao/Way through three progressive stages of ten transformations each, ascending in order. You must now carefully listen to the ten transformations, for they differ entirely from the three preceding stages.\n\nWhat are these three stages? First, the **Stage of Faith** (信阶); second, the **Stage of Practice** (行阶); third, the **Stage of Dedication** (回向阶).\n\nWithin the **Stage of Faith** (信膈), there are ten states of mind. What are these ten? First, the **Mind of Faith** (信心); second, the **Mind of Advancement** (进心); third, the **Mind of Reflection** (念心); fourth, the **Mind of Wisdom** (慧心); fifth, the **Mind of Concentration** (定心); sixth, the **Mind of Precepts** (戒心); seventh, the **Mind of Dedication** (回向心); eighth, the **Mind of Dharma Protection** (护法心); ninth, the **Mind of Renunciation** (舍法心); tenth, the **Mind of Aspiration** (愿心).\n\nWithin the **Stage of Practice** (行阶), there are ten practices: the **Mind of Faith** (信), the **Mind of Advancement** (进), the **Mind of Reflection** (念), the **Mind of Wisdom** (慧), the **Mind of Concentration** (定), the **Mind of Precepts** (戒), the **Mind of Dedication** (回向), the **Mind of Dharma Protection** (护法), the **Mind of Renunciation** (舍法), and the **Mind of Aspiration** (愿心)—these are the ten practices.\n\nWithin the **Stage of Dedication** (回向阶), there are ten dedicatory practices: the **Mind of Faith** (信心), the **Mind of Advancement** (进心), the **Mind of Reflection** (念心), the **Mind of Wisdom** (慧心), the **Mind of Concentration** (定心), the **Mind of Precepts** (戒心), the **Mind of Dedication** (回向心), the **Mind of Dharma Protection** (护法心), the **Mind of Renunciation** (舍法心), and the **Mind of Aspiration** (愿心)—these are the ten dedicatory practices, comprising the three stages of aspiration.\n\nThe **method of entering the Dao/Way** (入道方便) relies on **victorious aspiration** (胜心) to proceed into the ten transformations, which are entirely distinct from the previous ten.\n\nWhat are these ten? First, the **Transformation of True Realization** (证实转); second, the **Transformation of Removing Obstacles** (离障转); third, the **Transformation of Radiant Clarity and Counteraction** (光明对治转); fourth, the **Transformation of Wisdom-Fire Consuming** (智火烧然转); fifth, the **Transformation of Subduing Demons** (权魔胜转); sixth, the **Transformation of Manifesting Virtues** (现前显德转); seventh, the **Transformation of Illuminating the Distant Path** (远行光惠转); eighth, the **Transformation of Unchanging Non-Duality** (相无相不动转); ninth, the **Transformation of Concentration and Wisdom in Harmony** (定慧相应转); tenth, the **Transformation of Ultimate Dharma Realm** (法地究竟转).\n\n**Sea-Empty Wisdom-Hoard**, these ten transformations are the same as those taught by the Celestial Sovereign in the **past, future, and present three worlds** (过去未来见在三世), though spoken at different times, to be praised and countered.\n\nThe **True Person** (道心真人) faces ten kinds of obstacles in their aspiration to the Dao/Way. What are these ten? First, the obstacle of **countering the defilements of beings** (对治众生障); second, the obstacle of **countering the evil deeds of beings** (对治众生邪行障); third, the obstacle of **not understanding or enduring the teachings upon hearing or reflection** (於闻思修习受忍不通障); fourth, the obstacle of **arrogance arising from self-liberation** (自六解发心起高慢障); fifth, the obstacle of **egoistic attachment to the nature of dharmas** (我慢众人障); sixth, the obstacle of **habitual defilements from prior transformations** (除十转己前烦恼习障); seventh, the obstacle of **subtle defilements of wisdom** (除细法智障); eighth, the obstacle of **remaining deluded despite severing ignorance** (断无明有障); ninth, the obstacle of **not abandoning unwholesome deeds** (断不善利佗障); tenth, the obstacle of **not attaining freedom in the Dharma** (於法示得自在障).\n\n**Sea-Empty Wisdom-Hoard True Person**, to sever these ten obstacles of entering the Dao/Way, practices and extinguishes them utterly, so that they do not arise again. Thus, the ten transformations are established.\n\nWhy? The reason for naming these transformations from **True Realization** (证实) to **Ultimate Dharma Realm** (地究竟) is to benefit beings, gradually enlightening their wisdom and leading them into the transformations of the Dao/Way.\n\nThe meaning of the ten transformations is as follows:\n\nThe **First Transformation of True Realization** (证实转) is to **attain insight into the true and wondrous nature of the Dao/Way** (证见道性真实妙理).\n\nThe **Second Transformation of Removing Obstacles** (离障转) is to **obtain pure and wondrous precepts**, fully endowed with purity, **removing defilements and avarice**, hence the name.\n\nThe **Third Transformation of Radiant Clarity and Counteraction** (光明对治转) is to **reflect upon and practice flawless teachings**, **illuminating and manifesting** them clearly.\n\nThe **Fourth Transformation of Wisdom-Fire Consuming** (智火烧然转) is to **burn defilements to ashes with the fire of wisdom** (烦恼成薪，智火烧烬).\n\nThe **Fifth Transformation of Subduing Demons** (摧魔胜转) is to **acquire transcendent, flawless wisdom**, **virtuous means**, and **freedom from all defilements**, **abandoning the defiled mind**, and **subduing all demons** (降伏众魔).\n\nThe **Sixth Transformation of Manifesting Virtues** (现前显德转) is to **enter profound wisdom**, **reach the other shore**, and **benefit all beings** (自佗俱利), **manifesting the virtues of wisdom** (智德现前).\n\nThe **Seventh Transformation of Illuminating the Distant Path** (远行光慧转) is to **practice the Dharma of non-duality**, **culminating in its power**, **like a traveler gradually moving away from home** (去我渐远).\n\nThe **Eighth Transformation of Unchanging Non-Duality** (不动转) is to **refine the fruits of virtue**, **remaining undisturbed in the practice of non-duality** (於无相行中无间阙).\n\nThe **Ninth Transformation of Concentration and Wisdom in Harmony** (定慧相应转) is to **attain unobstructed wisdom**, **benefiting all beings in teaching the Dharma** (向众生说法成就中利佗).\n\nThe **Tenth Transformation of Ultimate Dharma Realm** (法地究竟转) is to **obtain the Dharma Body**, **perfect in all virtues**, and **ultimately free** (毕竟自在).\n\nThus, the **Great Bodhisattva** (大士) receives the **position of the Dharma King** (法王位), akin to a **prince attaining sovereignty among all kings** (太子於诸王中而得自在).\n\nEven in this position of the ten transformations, **subtle obstacles remain**, as **liberation has not yet been fully attained**.

      "translated_text": "**The Succession of Daoist Scriptures and Teachings**\n\n**Title:** *The Succession of Daoist Scriptures and Teachings*\n(Original unattributed author)\nThis text records Emperor Tang Tianhuang (Emperor Gaozong of Tang) seeking the Dao from Zhongyue Master Pan (Pan Shizheng), likely compiled by Tang-era Shangqing Daoists. The original single scroll was later divided into three volumes. The source text is from *The Canon of Orthodox Daoist Scripture (Zhengtong Daozang)*, the Taiping section.\n\n---\n\n**Volume One: The Origin and Succession of Daoist Teachings**\n\nThe Daoist lineage originates from the formless beginning, manifesting through response and sensation, emerging from the wondrous One. From the wondrous One, it divides into the Three Primordials (*sānyuán*), which further transform into the Three Qi (*sānqì*), and from the Three Qi arise the Three Realms (*sāncái*). Once the Three Realms are established, all things are complete.\n\nThe Three Primordials are:\n1. **Hundun Taowu Yuan** (Mixed Void Primordial of the Great Non-Being),\n2. **Chihun Taowu Yuan** (Red Mixed Primordial of the Great Non-Being),\n3. **Mingji Xuantong Yuan** (Silent and Mysterious Communicating Primordial).\n\nFrom **Hundun Taowu Yuan** emanates Tianbao Jun (Celestial Treasure Lord),\nFrom **Chihun Taowu Yuan** emanates Lingbao Jun (Numinous Treasure Lord),\nFrom **Mingji Xuantong Yuan** emanates Shenbao Jun (Divine Treasure Lord).\n\nThe Great Void Manifestation (*Dadong Jibie*) further distinguishes the **Hua Zhu** (Transformation Master), governing the Three Pure Realms.\n\nThe Three Pure Realms are:\n- **Yuqing** (Jade Purity),\n- **Shangqing** (Upper Purity),\n- **Taqing** (Great Purity),\nalso called the Three Heavens.\n\nThe Three Heavens are:\n- **Qingwei Tian** (Pure Mists Heaven),\n- **Yuyu Tian** (Jade Remnant Heaven),\n- **Dachi Tian** (Great Red Heaven).\n\nTianbao Jun governs the Yuqing Realm, which is Qingwei Tian, its qi being **Qingchi** (Azure Beginning).\nLingbao Jun governs the Shangqing Realm, which is Yuyu Tian, its qi being **Baiyuan** (White Primordial).\nShenbao Jun governs the Taqing Realm, which is Dachi Tian, its qi being **Huangxuan** (Yellow Mysterious).\n\nThus, the *Chapter on the Nine Heavens Generating Spirits* states:\n*\"These three names differ in years and titles, yet their essence is one. These three Lords are each the teaching masters of the Three Caverns, the exalted deities of the Three Caverns.\"*\n\nThe Three Caverns (*sāndòng*) are:\n- **Dongzhen** (Cavern of Perfected Truth),\n- **Dongxuan** (Cavern of Mysterious Primordials),\n- **Dongshen** (Cavern of Divine Manifestations).\n\nTianbao Jun expounds the **Twelve Departments of Scripture**, becoming the master of the Dongzhen Cavern.\nLingbao Jun expounds the **Twelve Departments of Scripture**, becoming the master of the Dongxuan Cavern.\nShenbao Jun expounds the **Twelve Departments of Scripture**, becoming the master of the Dongshen Cavern.\n\nThe Three Caverns together form **Thirty-Six Exalted Scriptures**. The first, Dongzhen, is the **Great Vehicle**; the second, Dongxuan, is the **Middle Vehicle**; the third, Dongshen, is the **Lesser Vehicle**.\n\nFrom the Three Caverns, seven departments are synthesized:\n- **Dongzhen, Dongxuan, Dongshen** (the three caverns),\n- **Taixuan** (Great Mysterious),\n- **Taiping** (Great Peace),\n- **Taqing** (Great Purity),\nas auxiliary scriptures. **Taixuan** aids Dongzhen, **Taiping** aids Dongxuan, and **Taqing** aids Dongshen.\n\nThe three auxiliaries combine to form the **Thirty-Six Departments**, while the **Seven Departments of Unified Command** (*Zhengyi Mengwei Tongguan*) synthesize into seven, hence the saying: *\"Three Caverns of Exalted Texts, Seven Departments of Mysterious Teachings.\"*\n\nFrom these seven, the **Thirty-Six Departments** further expand. The Thirty-Six Departments are:\n1. **Benwen** (Original Texts),\n2. **Shenfu** (Divine Talismans),\n3. **Yujue** (Jade Secrets),\n4. **Lingtu** (Numinous Diagrams),\n5. **Pulu** (Genealogies and Records),\n6. **Jielü** (Precepts and Statutes),\n7. **Weiyi** (Ceremonial Etiquette),\n8. **Fangfa** (Methods and Techniques),\n9. **Chongshu** (Assemblies and Discourses),\n10. **Chuanji** (Transmissions and Biographies),\n11. **Zansong** (Hymns and Chants),\n12. **Biaoshou** (Tables and Petitions).\nEach of the Three Caverns contains twelve departments, totaling **Thirty-Six Departments**.\n\nThe Three Qi are:\n- **Xuanqi** (Mysterious Qi),\n- **Yuanqi** (Primordial Qi),\n- **Shiqì** (Beginning Qi).\n\n**Shiqì** is azure, located in Qingwei Tian;\n**Yuanqi** is white, located in Yuyu Tian;\n**Xuanqi** is yellow, located in Dachi Tian.\nThus, they are called the **Three Qi of Xuan, Yuan, and Shi**.\n\nFrom these three qi, **Yin, Yang, and Harmony** arise, which further generate **Heaven, Earth, and Humanity**.\n\nThus, the *Laozi Jing* states:\n*\"The Dao gives birth to One, One gives birth to Two, Two gives birth to Three, Three gives birth to all things.\"*\n\nFrom **Xuandu Yujing** downward, there are **Thirty-Six Heavens** in total. Of these, **Twenty-Eight Heavens** are within the Three Realms, and **Eight Heavens** are beyond them.\n\nThe Three Realms are:\n- **Yùjiè** (Realm of Desire),\n- **Sèjiè** (Realm of Form),\n- **Wúsèjiè** (Realm of Formlessness).\n\nThe lower **Six Heavens** belong to the Realm of Desire,\nThe next **Eighteen Heavens** belong to the Realm of Form,\nThe upper **Four Heavens** belong to the Realm of Formlessness,\ntotaling **Twenty-Eight Heavens** within the Three Realms.\n\nThe Three Realms’ exalted domains possess refined and solemn forms. From the **Realm of Desire** upward, human lifespans extend greatly, their lands made of gold, their steps of white jade, and treasures of pearls and jewels appearing naturally. Though refined music resounds, they are free from birth and death.\n\nThe next **Four Heavens** above the Three Realms are called **Zhongrén Tian** (Heavens of Nurturing Humans), also **Sheng Dizi Tian** (Heavens of Holy Disciples), or **Sifan Tian** (Four Brahman Heavens). Those who reach here transcend birth and death, beyond the reach of the Three Calamities.\n\nAbove these are the **Three Realms**, divided into left, right, and central palaces, each containing:\n- **Xianwang** (Immortal Kings),\n- **Xian Gong** (Immortal Dukes),\n- **Xian Qing** (Immortal Viscounts),\n- **Xian Bo** (Immortal Marquises),\n- **Xian Dafu** (Immortal High Officers),\nalongside **one Taishang Laojun** (Supreme Venerable Lord) and **one Tian Shi** (Celestial Master).\n\nThe **Taqing Realm** has **Nine Xian** (Immortals):\n1. Shangxian (Highest Immortal),\n2. Gaoxian (Lofty Immortal),\n3. Daxian (Great Immortal),\n4. Xuánxian (Mysterious Immortal),\n5. Tianxian (Celestial Immortal),\n6. Zhenxian (True Immortal),\n7. Shenxian (Divine Immortal),\n8. Lingxian (Spiritual Immortal),\n9. Zhixian (Ultimate Immortal).\n\nThe **Zhen-Sheng** (True-Sage) Realms follow a similar numbering sequence—**Shang, Gao, Da, Xuan, Tian, Zhen, Shen, Ling, Zhi**—but with variations:\n- For **Zhen** (True): *Xianzhen* (Immortal True), *Yuanzhen* (Primordial True),\n- For **Sheng** (Sage): *Xiansheng* (Immortal Sage), *Wutian Sheng* (Sage Beyond Heaven).\n\nThe highest heaven is named **Daluo Tian** (Great Luo Heaven), located atop **Xuandu Yujing Mountain**. There, the **Ziwu Jinque** (Purple Micro Star Gate) stands, adorned with **seven-treasure cypress trees**, where **qilin** and **shishi** (mythical beasts) roam. The **Three-World Venerable Sovereigns** govern within.\n\nThe **Twenty-Eight Heavens of Desire**, the **Four Heavens above**, the **Three Realms**, and the **Daluo Heaven** above them—all **Thirty-Six Heavens**—are under the dominion of the Celestial Sovereigns.\n\nThus, the scripture declares:\n*\"Above the Three Realms lies the boundless Daluo Heaven,\nWithout form or root, its clouds towering and vast—\nOnly Yuan Shi remains,\nThe eternal home of the Great Cataclysm.\"*",

Since the **Shang Huang** (Upper Emperor) took his seat half a *kāli* (eon) ago, the **Yuan Shi Tianzun** has been in meditation.\n\nThe **Three Celestial Sovereigns** also possess ten titles:\n1. **Ziran** (Natural),\n2. **Yuanji** (Primordial Extremity),\n3. **Dadao** (Great Dao),\n4. **Zhizhen** (Ultimate Truth),\n5. **Taishang** (Supreme),\n6. **Daojun** (Dao Lord),\n7. **Gaohuang** (High Emperor),\n8. **Tianzun** (Celestial Sovereign),\n9. **Yudi** (Jade Emperor),\n10. **Bixia** (Your Majesty).\n\nExamining the Daoist scriptures and canons, they originate from the **Three Primordial** (Three Yuan), descend from the **Five Phases** (Five De), and culminate in the **Eight Trigrams** (Eight Xie). By uniting the **Three** with the **Five**, they form the **Eight Assemblies** (Eight Hui).\n\nThe characters of the **Eight Assemblies** are formed by **Miaoji** (subtle *qi*), with eight angles and drooping rays, condensed in the void as celestial cloud inscriptions. **Tai Zhen** (Supreme Truth) holds the brush, **Yu Fei** (Jade Consort) sweeps the mat, **Huang Jin** (Yellow Gold) serves as the book, and **Bai Yu** (White Jade) as the pages.

Those who, in one lifetime, commit no mental offenses—no greed, no wrath—are reborn into these heavens, where lifespans span billions of years.\n\nThird, the **Formless Realm** has four heavens.

dust;\nThe **nose**, with **attachment to fragrance and stench**, is dust;\nThe **tongue**, with **discernment of flavors**, is dust;\nThe **body**, with **desire for smoothness**, is dust;\nThe **mind**, with **lust for contact**, is dust.\n\nWhen the **Six Roots** overstep, they become the **Six Dusts**.\nWhen **turbulence** loses its true nature, they are also called the **Six Bandits**.\n\nThis is through human **artifice and application**.\n\nWhat are called the **Four Great Elements**?\nFirst, the **Earth Element**, forming **bones and flesh**;\nSecond, the **Water Element**, forming **blood and vessels**;\nThird, the **Fire Element**, providing **warmth**;\nFourth, the **Wind Element**, generating **coolness**.\n\nWhat are called the **Five Shades** (of perception)?\nFirst, the **Shade of Form**: through the eyes, perceiving all forms—this is the **Shade of Form**.\nSecond, the **Shade of Reception**: the mind discerns **right and wrong, suffering and joy**—this is the **Shade of Reception**.\nThird, the **Shade of Reflection**: the mind contemplates—this is the **Shade of Reflection**.\nFourth, the **Shade of Action**: the mind follows reflection and acts—this is the **Shade of Action**.\nFifth, the **Shade of Cognition**: the mind knows **birth and death**, recognizing, discerning, and remembering—this is the **Shade of Cognition**.\n\nWhat are called the **Three Karmas**?\nFirst, **bodily karma**: killing, theft, lewdness.\nSecond, **mental karma**: greed, wrath, delusion.\nThird, **verbal karma**: evil speech, slander, lies, and idle chatter—these are the **Three Karmas**.\n\nThe **three bodily, three mental, and four verbal** offenses combine into the **Ten Evils**.\n\nThe **Five Sufferings**:\nThere are **five sufferings of life and death**—five in **life**, five in **death**.\n\nWhat are called the **Five Sufferings of Life**?\nAs the *Scripture on Ascending the Mysterious* states:\nFirst, being enslaved as a **servant or concubine**, enduring **sorrow and separation**.\nSecond, dwelling in **folly and blindness**, failing to see the **wondrous Dao**, estranged from the **Master**.\nThird, being **lonely, widowed, orphaned, or solitary**—having the **form of a person** but lacking **human sentiment**.\nFourth, suffering **violence and misfortune**, bound in **prisons and chains**.\nFifth, though **long-lived**, plagued by **disease**, tormented by **afflictions** day and night—these are the **Five Sufferings of Life**.\n\nWhat are called the **Five Sufferings of Death**?\nFirst, traversing **mountains of blades and forests of swords**, limbs severed and torn.\nSecond, plunged into **boiling cauldrons**, flesh and bone dissolved, trapped in the **wheel of birth and death**.\nThird, wandering as a **hungry ghost**, clothes insufficient to cover the body, food insufficient to fill the stomach, consuming **fire and charcoal**.\nFourth, a **son embracing a

This is named the **Five Sufferings of Death**.\n\nWhat are called the **Three Filths**?\n*Filth* refers to **bondage**. First is the **path of hell** (地狱道), second the **path of hungry ghosts** (饿鬼道), third the **path of livestock** (畜生道). Together with the **Five Sufferings**, this is named the **Eight Difficulties**.\n\nWhat are called the **Three Karmas**?\nThey were previously mentioned: first, **physical karma** (身业), second, **mental karma** (心业), third, **verbal karma** (口业). Within **physical karma**, there are three transgressions: first, the **transgression of killing** (杀生过), second, the **transgression of theft** (偷盗过), third, the **transgression of licentiousness** (邪淫过).\nAll beings, with a mere turn of the hand or movement of the foot, habitually commit harm. All sentient creatures with blood—without mercy—either act under cover of darkness, plundering openly, or pass by temples and shrines, taking **sacred treasures**. After this transgression, one falls into the **Three Filths**, where **venomous birds** peck out the eyes, **iron plows** till the tongue, molten copper seethes in **boiling cauldrons**, poured into the mouth and burning the body. Through countless **kalpas** (劫) of endless darkness, there is no way to escape—this is the retribution for one’s prior **karma**.\n\nWithin **mental karma**, there are also three **poisons** (三毒): first, the **poison of deceit** (阴私毒), second, the **poison of harm** (贼害毒), third, the **poison of slander** (谗佞毒).\nAfter this transgression, one endures the **Five Turbid Cauldrons** (五浊汤)—day and night, tormented by fire. Though reborn, one becomes a **venomous serpent** or **malevolent beast**, repaying the sins of the **Three Poisons** from a past life.\nThis is named **mental karma**.\n\nWithin **verbal karma**, there are four **offenses** (四罪): first, **deceptive speech** (绮言), second, **falsehood** (妄语), third, **double-tongued slander** (两舌), fourth, **malicious cursing** (恶骂).\nAll beings across the **Ten Directions** (十方) of the great earth indulge in **flowery, seductive words** (华辞绮艳), twist their tongues in **double-tongued slander**, speak ill of others, severing **kinship and lineage** (种亲), uttering **coarse, malevolent speech** (粗言恶气) and cursing one another. With **verbal karma**, the **root of the tongue** (舌根) craves **savory flavors**, drinking wine, eating meat, and indulging in **spicy, pungent** (荤辛) tastes.\nAfter this transgression, one descends into the **Nine Abysses** (九幽), an endless night of **darkness and cold**, where one is imprisoned in **biting frost**.\nEven if one is kind to **compassionate parents**, who would know the **bitter and sweet** (苦爽含酸) of their suffering? Though one has **affectionate spouses and children**, how could they witness the **lonely spirit enduring torment** (孤魂受痛)?\nOnly the **Three Celestial Teachers** (三天教主) and the **Six Path Masters** (六道大师) pity the suffering of all beings, like **a tender infant** (赤子), filled with **mercy and love**, universally saving all sentient beings, bestowing **blessings and grace**, aiding those with **sentience** (含识).\nUnder the **compassionate guidance** (御慈悲之救物) of the **Teachers of Mercy**, and the **great grace** (洪恩) of the **Primordial Sage** (元始), all strive to **purify mind and body**, gathering their intentions in one moment.\nWhether the **offense is great or small**, all beg for its removal. Whether the **obstacle is shallow or deep**, all seek **atonement in a single day**. With **one heart**, they **bow in reverence**, taking refuge in **faith and devotion**.\n\nThe **Tang Emperor** (唐天皇) asked in **Mount Song** (中岳) about the **Triple Unity Method** (三一法). The **Revered Master** (尊师) replied:\n*\"In accordance with the *Scripture of the Sovereign’s Unity* (皇人守一经), the method of **Triple Unity** (三守一) is preserved. First, **cultivate unity** within the mind at the **space between the brows** (两眉间), then withdraw inward to the **upper elixir field** (上丹田), three inches deep. There is a **Divine Being** (神) named **赤子** (Child of Vermilion), with the **surname 元先** (Primordial First). Another name is **帝卿** (Lord of the Sovereign), with a height of three inches, wearing **vermilion headgear, vermilion robes, and vermilion shoes** (赤帻、赤衣、赤履).\n\nNext, **cultivate unity** within the **middle elixir field** (心中丹田), where a **Divine Being** (神) named **真人** (True Person), with the **surname 子丹** (Elixir Child), is also called **光坚** (Radiant Strength), with three inches in height, wearing **vermilion headgear, vermilion robes, and vermilion shoes**.\n\nThen, **cultivate unity** within the **lower elixir field** (脐下三寸), three inches below the navel, where a **Divine Being** (神) named **婴儿** (Infant), with the **surname 元阳子** (Primordial Yang Child), is also called **谷玄子** (Mysterious Valley Child), with three inches in height, wearing **vermilion headgear, vermilion robes, and vermilion shoes**.\n\nVisualize the **lower unity** seated upon a **golden bed and jade couch** (金床玉机), constantly stirring the **refined vital essence** (精气) with a **golden censer and jade ladle** (金炉玉匕).\n\nThen, **cultivate unity** from the **lower unity** to the **middle unity**, dwelling on its **left side**, and again, **cultivate unity** with the **lower unity**’s hand holding the **golden censer and jade ladle**, residing on the **middle unity**’s **right side**. First, **nourish the upper and middle unity** (上中一) with the **refined essence**, granting one **thirteen breaths** (得十三口). Then, return to **contemplate the dwelling place of the upper unity**, followed by **contemplate the dwelling place of the lower unity**, and then cease.\n\nThe **True Person** said: *\"You can achieve **all things through Unity** (守一).*\n**Unity** is the **Sovereign of the Body** (身之帝君). Guarding the **Sovereign** ensures the **Sovereign’s presence**, and when the **Sovereign is present**, the **thirty-six thousand spirits** (三万六千神) dare not fail to be present as well.\n**Contemplating Unity** can repel **hundreds of ghosts and spirits** (百鬼众精), **five weapons** (五兵)—water and fire—**all calamities and five poisons** (众灾五毒), **tigers and wolves, snakes and locusts** (虎狼蛇蝗), **crocodiles, dragons, and malevolent specters** (蛟龙魍魉), **mountain spirits and demonic apparitions** (山精鬼魅), preventing them from approaching humans.\n\nThe **Tang Emperor** asked: *\"The **Nine Palaces** (九宫) at the hairline on the forehead—what are their names?\"*\nThe **Revered Master** replied:\n*\"In accordance with the *Scripture of Ascending to Truth and Hidden Secrets* (登真隐诀经), the hairline contains the **Nine Palaces** (九宫) behind the forehead.

      "translated_text": "The **Sage** is the supreme name for **profound awareness** (玄觉). All things with form inherently contain the **Dao-nature** (道性). Yet, attaining the **Dao** varies in depth, and **enlightenment** ranges from shallow to profound.\n\nTo merely grasp the common and not the true is not to attain the **Dao**; to perceive the near but not the far is not to be called a **Sage**. Thus, sensations of pain, itching, cold, and warmth are but the trivial awareness of all things. Mastering the **Nine Net Bindings** (九结) is but a skillful proximity to understanding—yet this is daily distant from the **Dao**, ever farther from sainthood.\n\nOnly those who **uprightly** (挺然) awaken to **profound insight** (玄悟) and **transcendently** (超然) attain **great harmony** (大通) can perceive the perils of the **Three Realms** (三界) and guide all **Four Births** (四生) to the **Domain of Longevity** (寿域). This is achieved by **awakening through harmony**, making the unaware aware, and the unharmonized harmonized—thus perfecting **Great Awakening**, hence called **Round Enlightenment** (圆通).\n\nYet, the **Law** (法) and **humanity** (人) are inherently harmonized—**harmony as essence**, **trace as manifestation**. When perceived through **form**, it is not **being**; when responded to through **sensation**, it is not **emptiness**. Thus, the **Celestial Sovereign of the Great Dao** (大道天尊) embodies both **True** and **Responsive** aspects: the **True** abides **serene and eternal**, neither generated nor extinguished; the **Responsive** manifests with coming and going, **provisionally demonstrating** to guide beings.\n\nYet, the **True** and **Responsive** are twofold in form—**True Body** as the **Root of the Dao**, **Responsive Body** as **Manifested Trace**. Across **kalpas**, the **Manifested Trace** emerges, projecting forms and transmitting sounds, expounding **sutras** to guide beings—innumerable in **great compassion**, encompassing all living beings.\n\nSince all beings differ in **root-nature** (根性), **teachings** are established in **graded stages** (科), with **progressive** and **sudden** methods varying.\n\nFor those who first awaken to the **Dao-intent**, cultivating **aspiration**, as taught, begin by upholding **pure precepts**. The **precepts** (戒) are of two kinds: **Precepts of Attainment** (有得戒) and **Precepts of Non-Attainment** (无得戒).\n\n**Precepts of Attainment** are as described in the *Taixuan Zhenjing* (《太玄真经》): the **Three Precepts**, **Five Precepts**, **Nine Precepts**, **Ten Precepts**, **One Hundred and Eighty Precepts**, and the **Three Hundred Great Precepts**.\n\n**Precepts of Non-Attainment** refer to those of **highest aptitude** (上机), whose **spirit-awareness** is enlightened, whose **conduct** is refined, and whose **actions** are subtle—free from **deliberate intent**, untouched by **defilements**, entering the **void-realm**, treading the **true source**. They attain **permanent bliss** without seeking, and **all virtues** arise spontaneously; they transcend the **human realm** without aversion, and **all evils** cease naturally. Since they inherently **hold nothing**, they inherently **transgress nothing**—this is called **Non-Attainment**.\n\nSince there is no transgression, there is no loss. Thus, they are called **true high-aptitude beings**. Such are their precepts.\n\nIf one upholds the precepts without transgression, they ascend the **Ten Transformations** (十转位) and attain the **Five Dao Fruits** (五道果).\n\nThe **Ten Transformations** are as stated in the *Haikong Zhizang Jing* (《海空智藏经》):\n1. **Transformation of No-Anxiety** (无忧转),\n2. **Transformation of Pure Mind** (净心转),\n3. **Transformation of Release from Hindrance** (释滞转),\n4. **Transformation of Daoist Scholar** (道儒转),\n5. **Transformation of Penetrating Insight** (达解转),\n6. **Transformation of Auspicious Vision** (善见转),\n7. **Transformation of Skillful Means** (权物转),\n8. **Transformation of Clarifying Responses** (了机转),\n9. **Transformation of Celestial Clarity** (天明转),\n10. **Transformation of Fully Attained** (具足转).\n\nThe **Five Dao Fruits** are as follows:\n1. **Earthly Immortal Fruit** (地仙果),\n2. **Flying Immortal Fruit** (飞仙果),\n3. **Self-Sovereign Fruit** (自在果),\n4. **Leakless Fruit** (无漏果),\n5. **Non-Action Fruit** (无为果).\n\nIf one cultivates through **alchemical practices**, abstaining from grains, refining **essence** and **Dao-flavor** (道味), aspiring to **mountain seclusion**, hiding their form in retreat, consuming **dew and qi**, rejecting **rich nourishment**, lightening the body and strengthening vitality, avoiding **aging and death**, wandering in **Dao-nature**, not consuming living beings, practicing **compassionate laws**, or if born into noble families, residing in splendor, free from illness, sustaining **long-term vegetarian fasting**, abandoning lust, and practicing as above—then they attain the **Earthly Immortal Fruit**.\n\nIf one performs **auspicious deeds**, safeguards **preceptual conduct**, never transgressing, maintaining **upright body and mind**, abstaining from **root desires**, skillfully holding the **Six Senses**, untouched by **defilements**, aligning actions with **principle**, not exceeding **measure**, wandering on **famed peaks**, feasting on **clouds and mist**, fortifying the mind, unmoved—even if they do not broadly hear **profound Dao-sounds**, yet they uphold **pure precepts** like a **lucent crystal**, clear within and without—then they attain the **Flying Immortal Fruit**.\n\nIf one masters **prohibitions and decorum**, their **conduct** and **mind** align with **rules**, revered by **heavenly and human**, all offering **sustenance**, their **spiritual power** transforming without limit, their **intentions** fulfilled—without consuming **elixirs**, naturally sated—if they wish to eat, it manifests by **thought alone** in this world, their **form and thoughts** unrestrained, wandering **mountains and marshes** without fear, perpetually cultivating **auspicious deeds**, their **form** responding to **sensations**, their **mind** steadfast as **mountains**, mastering **spiritual penetration**, meditating on **subtle stillness** within **subtle stillness**, able to **divide their form**, responding to countless calls—then they attain the **Self-Sovereign Fruit**.\n\nIf one **penetrates all laws**, discerning **heart-mind distinctions** without error, benefiting infinitely, entering **void and form**, receiving all **scriptures**, free from **afflictions**, abandoning **greed, anger, and attachment**, purifying the **Six Entries**, severing the **Three Bonds**, enlightened and penetrating, **eloquent in teaching**, broadly liberating beings—within this **lifetime** and future **kalpas**, never regressing, ascending **graded stages** to the **Supreme Path**—then through diligent cultivation, they attain the **Leakless Dao Fruit**.\n\nThe **Non-Action Fruit** is entering the **Supreme Stillness Path** (寂无上法门). **Stillness** is **Non-Action**; **Non-Action** is **Stillness**. **Stillness** is neither birth nor death, thus **eternal life**; it is neither destruction nor change, thus **adaptive response**. **Non-Action** is **Action**; **Action** is **Non-Action**. Through **Non-Action**, **Action** arises; through **Action**, one enters the **Non-Action realm**—this is **responsive harmony**.\n\n**Responsive harmony** is **Stillness**; through **Stillness**, **responsive harmony** arises; through **responsive harmony**, one returns to **Stillness**—subtle and unfathomable, **spiritual power** beyond thought, exhausting **profound depths**, hence called **Liberation**—this is the **Supreme Fruit of Non-Action**.",

      "translated_text": "The Primordial Supreme Lord of Heaven and Humankind,\nnow abandons great compassion and departs from birth and death.\nAlone returning to the wondrous, silent source of goodness,\nhe does not dwell in the world to benefit the dust of mortals.\n\nThe pure, unobstructed body of true wisdom—\nno metaphor or speech can liken it.\nNot something within our knowing or seeing,\nhow could we observe it and awaken to profound truth?\n\nThe Celestial Worthies of the trace-body,\ncarefully consulting the *Supreme Scripture of Unveiling the Secret Treasury*,\nasked: *\"Does the Dao Lord manifest both the birth-body and the trace-body?\"*\n\nThe Supreme Lord replied: *\"So it is. Birth and trace—\nboth are called 'opportunity,' benefiting without distinction,\nthus named 'manifestation.' Essence and function are not separate,\nnames differ according to meaning.*\n\n*The Dao Lord further asked: *\"Is the trace-body one with the Dharma or without?\"*\n\n*The Supreme Lord answered: *\"I do not say 'yes.' All things,\nin their nature, are without possession.\nHow could the trace-body be said to have Dharma?\nIf only a name is assumed, then it is both and not both—\nnot separate from its origin, hence called 'not having';\nseen by sentient beings, hence called 'having';\nno other substance, hence called 'not having';\nyet truly beneficial, hence called 'having.'\n\n*Like a bright mirror that reflects myriad forms,\nclear and distinct, yet the images within it\ncannot be fixed as having or not having—\nyet one may say the mirror holds images.\nWhen the minds of all beings are clear,\nthey see the true Dao-body’s reflection—\nlike still water without waves,\nreflecting sun, moon, stars, and flying birds,\nall clearly seen at the water’s depths,\nalong with their own shadow, distinct and bright.\n\n*These watery things and their shadows\nare neither truly real nor can be said not to exist.\nWhen all beings’ minds are clear and pure,\nthey see the Dao-body’s reflection—\njust so.\nThe true Dao is imprinted upon them,\nthus neither having nor unseen—\nhence it cannot be called 'not having.'\nLike one who pursues the past by tracing footsteps,\nyet finds neither the trace nor the person—\nneither one nor different.\nThe trace-body is the same.\n\n*Those who understand clearly,\nentering through the trace to awaken,\nsee the true Dao-body,\nknowing the trace-Dharma is nonexistent—\nthus it is called 'one.'\nNot that it does not rely on the trace,\nbut gradually attaining comprehension,\nestablishing fields of merit—\nthis is called 'different.'\n\n*Such is the Dao’s realm,\nnot something the vulgar or lowly saints can fathom.*\n\n*Then the Dao Lord wished to reveal this meaning,\nreciting another verse:*\n\n*The trace-body has no fixed form,\nits manifested body endures eternally.\nIt presses upon the Five Paths’ shapes,\nits form adapts to beauty or ugliness.\nPrioritizing its essence,\nit benefits without burden or neglect.\nSometimes it generates transformations,\nat times it follows father and mother.\nThe Celestial Worthies of the trace-body,\nconsulting the *Scriptures of the Old Lord’s Teachings*, say:\nThe Sacred and True are without constraint,\ntheir essence has two aspects:\nOne—Dao-qi descending to manifest form,\nharmonizing with mortals, yet mortals not yet returning to the root.\nTwo—when the vulgar cultivate with complete virtue,\ntheir spirit merges with manifestation,\nhidden yet unnamed.\n\n*The Dao responds to circumstances;\ncircumstances are without name,\nyet manifestations are named.\nNames differ, manifestations differ,\nyet the Dao remains the same—\naction never leaves stillness.*\n\n*Further, consulting the *Supreme Scripture of Resolving Doubts*, it says:\nThe Primordial Celestial Worthies declared,\n*\"For the sake of sentient beings, I manifest and receive form,\nentering the Five Paths, adapting to circumstances to guide them,\nusing expedient means to awaken all,\nconforming to their roots and nature,\ndemonstrating forms by expedient means—\nthus it is called the 'manifestation-body.'\nYet this manifestation-body\nhas neither birth nor death, coming nor going—\nit is ever-present, unchanging,\nbenefiting all, hidden or revealed,\narousing diligence so none retreat.\"*\n\n*At that time, the assembled immortals bowed repeatedly to the Dao Lord,\nreciting this verse:*\n\n*The Supreme, pure, and wondrous body of true wisdom,\nsilent and extinguished, formless—none can perceive it.\nOnly the manifestation-body returns to its source,\nthus all bear great sorrow and distress.\nRelying on the Supreme Lord of the Boundless,\nlike an orphan clinging to a father’s mercy,\nwe are immersed in the fire of suffering—\nwe pray for the timely rain of sweet dew.\nSevering inverted thoughts and clinging hearts,\ndissolving all views and evil inclinations.*\n\n*The Celestial Worthies of the divided-body,\nconsulting the *Scripture of the Spirit’s Degree and Fate*, say:\nThe Celestial Worthies divided their forms into a hundred million,\nsimultaneously present everywhere—\nmale or female, all seen within the Five-Colored Light,\nas though gathered in one place.\nWherever they appeared,\nthe young and old, male and female, all prostrated in homage.\n\n*The Celestial Worthies, according to each land,\nexpounded the Ten Marvelous Sutras,\ninstructed in prohibitions,\nand declared distinctions between male and female.*\n\n*At that time, the young and old from the four borders,\nwithout exception, offered gold and silver,\nfive-colored patterned silks, jewels, and treasures—\ncountless beyond measure—to present to the Celestial Worthies,\nreceiving the precepts and venerating the sutras.*\n\n*For seven days and seven nights,\nthe light shone brightly, dispelling darkness,\nand the four directions returned to normal.\nThe treasures of faith filled the land,\nand the Celestial Worthies at once distributed to the destitute—\nthe hungry were filled, the poor lacked nothing,\nrich and poor became equal,\nand no one harbored resentment.\nThe Celestial Records noted those with prior merit,\ninscribing their names on golden tablets,\ngranting them world-transcendence,\nflight through the void,\nentrance into the Dao-gate,\nand longevity of thirty-six thousand years.*\n\n*Further, consulting the *Supreme Scripture of the Ultimate Peak’s Most Victorious and Unequaled Dao Collection*, it says:\nThe Primordial Celestial Worthies remained motionless for three days and three nights,\ntheir faculties silent, entering profound stillness,\ngazing into the wondrous gate.\nAll the great assembly likewise stood upright,\ngazing upon the Lord’s countenance,\nnot a single misstep.\n\n*After three days, the Primordial Celestial Worthies raised their body in smile,\ntheir entire form radiating golden light,\nilluminating the assembly in pure gold,\nand emitted a subtle voice in praise of the Dao Lord:*\n*\"Excellent! Excellent!\nMy true child,\nable to inherit the honored position,\nteaching and transforming sentient beings,\nopening the gate of expedient means—\njust as I.\"*",

All the ten-quadrant lands were contained within the palace.\n\nThe Manifested-Body Celestial Worthies of the ten-quadrant realms, upon seeing this radiance, gathered at once, their retinues assembled to expound the Dao’s rites and praise the Dao Lord.\n\nThe Manifested-Body Celestial Worthies—*as recorded in the Scripture of Fixed Resolution*—were once twelve young disciples dwelling in the world, indulging in worldly pleasures. Day by day, they gathered to share meals, engage in play and sightseeing, or debate the ease and difficulty of the Dao. The Celestial Worthies, perceiving through the Dao-Eye their past lives as humans who had hoarded scriptures in secret, saw their disciples’ hesitant hearts toward the Dao as well. Thus, they seized the opportunity to guide them, for even such hearts could be transformed.\n\nThereupon, the Celestial Worthies assumed the form of a common mortal passing through the assembly to beg for alms. Addressing the gathered disciples, the transformed figure said: *\"To uphold the precepts is easy; to violate them is difficult.\"* The disciples, hearing these words, all fell silent in contemplation.\n\nThey asked the transformed figure: *\"How is it that you say upholding the precepts is easy, while not upholding them is so difficult?\"*\n\nThe transformed figure replied: *\"To stand upright as the precepts demand—one need not fear kings nor ghosts and spirits. How is this not easy? But those who violate the precepts fear all men, and fear ghosts and spirits as well. How could this not be difficult?\"*\n\nThus, the twelve young disciples, now stirred by the Dao, each reflected deeply and came to understand the law’s meaning.\n\n*The Scripture of Supreme Decision on Doubts* states: The Primordial Celestial Worthies spoke to Xu Lai Le: *\"With the Dao-Eye, I observe from the silent realm the myriad beings. Those who can discern the truth, I grant them the seal of the Law. Those who follow my teachings—I shall manifest countless forms, appearing in the realms of humans and heavens, acting as expedient means to guide and protect them, appearing and vanishing in an instant.

Within them are ranked gods, spirits, emperors, and empresses, with distinctions of high and low. They govern the winds and rains, oversee all spirits, and shine resplendently, overseeing the mortal realm below. All beings’ names and records are registered beneath them. The people’s virtues and vices are recorded in their deeds, and the spirits report them to the celestial bureaucracy. Those with meritorious deeds are inscribed in the Yellow Registers, while those with offenses are recorded in the Black Ledgers. When their merits reach three thousand, their names are transferred to the immortal register.\n\nNovices who practice virtue and establish merit rely on the righteous spirits of the six *jiǎ* (Heavenly Stems) and *zǐ* (Earthly Branches), have their sins erased, and are enrolled in the immortal ledgers. These are the spirit officials—all belong to the *Yǒuwéi* (Manifested) bureaucracy. They cannot be slighted, for if neglected, one will suffer in the next life. Thus, one must earnestly seek and petition, striving for early success. This is the initial gate of learning, not the highest path of the Great Vehicle.\n\nMoreover, those beginning from the mortal realm are still obstructed by demons. Therefore, they rely on the celestial officials of the sun, moon, and stars below, and the righteous *qi* of the six *jiǎ*, to subdue ghosts and spirits, dispel demons, and eliminate calamities. However, the ultimate fruit of initial practice is not as described. Disciples who receive the teachings follow the graded path—from gradual to sudden, from low to high. Thus, the Three Vehicles’ teachings differ in scale.\n\nAccording to the *Tàizhēn Kē*:\nThe *Míngwēi* (Oath of Power) is the Lower Grade, *Tàiqīng* is the Middle Grade, and *Shàngqīng Dàodé* is the Upper Grade—the three grades are the Three Vehicles.\n\nThose of low capacity first seek self-benefit but cannot yet save others. Thus, the Three Sovereigns and Cavernous Gods refine wisdom, progressing from near to far, clarifying that the body is the foundation of all virtues, and that self-salvation can extend to others.\n\nThose of medium capacity have clear wisdom, understanding that benefiting others is the path to self-benefit, and that self-cultivation is the foundation for saving others. Thus, the Middle Grade Cavernous Mysteries distinguish between the manifested and the void, achieving mutual benefit for self and others.\n\nWhen reaching *Dòngzhēn* (Penetrating Truth), the true and false merge, and self and other are transcended, leaving only the singular path.\n\nThus, those of middle and low capacity, at the start of their Daoist practice, establish merit and cultivate virtue through the *yīnyáng* (yin-yang), the six *jiǎ*, the sun, moon, and five stars. Some align with the body, others with benefiting beings—whether healing illnesses, curing diseases, rescuing the dying, or saving the living. Though these are acts of conditional merit, their blessings are vast, gradually increasing. When merit is complete, one does not dwell on it; when practice is fulfilled, one does not cling. One constantly performs hidden kindnesses, acting without expectation, aligning with the Dao, and ultimately attaining non-action.\n\nThe Tang Heavenly Sovereign asked: *\"The Dao’s laws reach their peak in this heaven—is there yet another realm?\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"According to the *Língbǎo Běnyuán Jīng*, the *Tàizhēn Kē*, and the *Zhūtiān Língshū Dùmìng Jīng*, it states:\nThe Three Realms and Three Purity domains comprise four kinds of Great Luo (transcendents). Below are the Twenty-Eight Heavens of the Three Realms, followed by the four kinds of Human Heavens, then the Three Supreme Heavens, and finally the Great Luo High-Covered Heaven.\n\nThe six *Yù* (Desire) realms—*Tàihuáng Chéngtiān* (Great Yellow Sovereign Heaven), *Tàimíng Yùwán Tiān* (Great Bright Jade Complete Heaven), *Qīngmíng Hé Tóng Tiān* (Clear Bright Harmony Child Heaven), *Xuāntāi Píngyù Tiān* (Primordial Womb Nurturing Heaven), *Yuánmíng Wénjǔ Tiān* (Primordial Bright Literary Ascension Heaven), and *Qīyào Móyí Tiān* (Seven Radiant Mo-Yi Heaven)—are yin-yang generated, with lifespans of ten thousand years.\n\nAbove them are the six *Xūwú* (Emptiness) realms—*Xūwú Yuèhéng Tiān* (Void Beyond Measure Heaven), *Tàijí Méngyì Tiān* (Great Extremes Obscured Heaven), *Chìmíng Héyáng Tiān* (Scarlet Bright Harmony Yang Heaven), *Xuānmíng Gōnghuá Tiān* (Mysterious Bright Reverent Splendor Heaven), *Yàomíng Zōngpiāo Tiān* (Radiant Bright Sovereign Drifting Heaven), *Zhúlòu Huángjiào Tiān* (Jade Fall Royal Horn Heaven), *Xūmíng Tángyào Tiān* (Void Bright Hall Radiance Heaven), *Guānmíng Duànjìng Tiān* (Observant Bright Tranquil Heaven), *Xuānmíng Gōngqìng Tiān* (Mysterious Bright Reverent Celebration Heaven), *Tàihuàn Jíyáo Tiān* (Great Splendor Extreme Jade Heaven), *Yuánzǎi Kǒngshēng Tiān* (Primordial Loaded Hollow Ascension Heaven), *Tàiān Huángyá Tiān* (Great Peace Royal Cliff Heaven), *Xiǎndìng Jífēng Tiān* (Manifest Destiny Extreme Wind Heaven), *Shǐhuáng Xiàománg Tiān* (First Sovereign Filial Brightness Heaven), *Tàihuáng Fǎngzhòng Tiān* (Great Sovereign Visiting Heavy Heaven), *Wúsī Jiāngyóu Tiān* (Non-Thought Jiang-You Heaven), *Shàngzhì Ruànlè Tiān* (Uppermost Auspicious Music Heaven), and *Wújí Duànshì Tiān* (Non-Extreme Tranquil Vow Heaven.\"*",

      "translated_text": "「To the right, the eighteen heavens of the Color Realm, where *yīnyáng* (yin-yang) manifest as hues, sharing the same origin as the Desire Realm yet not intermingling with it. Here, all beings are born through transformation, their lifespans accumulating to a hundred million years, yet they suffer neither decay nor harm.\n\nThe Radiant Court of the Celestial Path Heaven, the Abyssal Communion of the Primordial Cavern Heaven, the Graceful Favor of the Wondrous Completion Heaven, and the Refined Music of the Forbidden Ascension Heaven—these four are the heavens of the Formless Realm. Within them, *yīnyáng* (yin-yang) takes shape, with bodies stretching hundreds of *lǐ* (leagues), yet they do not weary from it. They can vanish their forms into subtlety, free from all color and desire, knowing only the straight path. Their years span countless *jié* (kalpas), yet though they do not study, they naturally act with benevolence, reaping the fruits of their merit.\n\nAs for the demon kings, even those whose learning is not yet perfected wander here, yet they cannot surpass the Three Realms, nor escape the great calamity.\n\nWhen the grand cycle turns, the twenty-eight heavens merge into one moment of chaos, like the mists of the *Gǔ* (Valley) of *Hóng* (Confusion). Among them, those who truly grasp the Dao are welcomed by the Holy Mother, ascending beyond the four heavens of *Chángróng* (Ever-Melting), *Yùlóng* (Jade-Surging), *Fàndù* (Dharma-Ascending), and *Jiǎyù* (Jade-Resounding).\n\nThose who attain the Dao as Holy True Ones within the Three Realms are returned to the human path, enduring the Three Trials. Those who advance further do so according to their merit.\n\nThe Heaven of Supreme Ever-Melting, the Heaven of Jade-Surging Triumph, the Heaven of Dragon-Transformation Dharma-Ascending, and the Heaven of Great Dao Tranquil Jade-Resounding—these four are the heavens of the Human Realm, known as the Four Dharma-Heavens. Their lifespans know no fixed limit, for they shift moment by moment, growing ever brighter each day. They do not depart these heavens when their span ends, nor descend to the Three Realms; their distance is measured within the middle. Those who cultivate *rénjìng* (benevolent purity) until their *xíqì* (habitual tendencies) are exhausted are born there.\n\nThe Daoist scriptures, passed down in succession, conclude their first volume.\n\nThe Daoist scriptures, passed down in succession, begin their second volume.\n\nThe Three Pure Ones’ realm starts below: the First is the Great Red Heaven, the Second is the Yu-Remainder Heaven, and the Third is the Pure Mists Heaven.\n\nThe three heavens above are called the Supreme Three Heavens, where those who have realized the Dao and attained the ultimate mysteries manifest in wondrous forms. Their divine powers are boundless, dwelling eternally unbroken. These are the origins of the Nine Pure Ones, condensed into one *qì* (breath/essence).\n\nBeyond this *qì* lies the Great Luo Heaven, the abode of the Primordial Origin Lord’s immovable essence. The *Sutra of Degrees* states: Above the Three Realms, the vast Great Luo, where no formless roots exist—its clouds rise in towering layers, and only the Primordial Origin’s boundless kalpas dwell there. This is called the Supreme. The three *yuán* (primordial cycles) and eight *jié* (nodes), the ten *zhí* (straight days) of *gēngshēn* (regeneration), and all such days of abstinence—when the ten thousand saints and five hundred million wondrous Daoist beings, countless as the stars, don their celestial law-garments, each leading ten million souls, ride upon the void, ascend with dragons, and perform the grand celestial music, singing with resounding voices, their ten thousand banners fluttering in unison—all drift through the empty sky and gather in the Mysterious Metropolis. The Mysterious Metropolis Great Luo Heaven lies above the Jade Capital Mountain.\n\nThe ten titles of the *Xuánzhōng* (Mysterious Metropolis) Grand Master differ from the previous ten titles:\n1. The Nameless Lord,\n2. The Supreme Mysterious Elder,\n3. The Highest Elder Lord,\n4. The Exalted Elder Sage,\n5. The Heavenly Sovereign Great Emperor,\n6. The Mysterious Metropolis Grand Master,\n7. The Ancient Sage,\n8. The Golden Gate Emperor Lord,\n9. The Formless True Person,\n10. The Highest Emperor of the Supreme.\n\nThis is from *The True Transmission*.\n\n1. The Great Dao,\n2. The Upright Truth,\n3. The Highest Sage,\n4. The Lord of the Dao,\n5. The Mysterious Elder,\n6. The Heavenly Lord,\n7. The Ten Saints,\n8. The True Saints,\n9. The Jade Emperor,\n10. The Law King.\n\nThe One Vehicle: According to *The Great True Science Sutra*, the Three Vehicles are interconnected, with varying applications. When one is astonished by their unity, it is called the One Vehicle Dao.\n\nThe One Mind: The scripture says, \"The mind attains stillness.\"\n\nThe Two Scenes: Refers to the sun and moon.\n\nThe Two *Qi*: Refers to *yīnyáng* (yin-yang).\n\nThe Two True Ones: The Left Mysterious True Person, the Right Mysterious True Person.\n\nThe Two *Yí*: The round heaven and the square earth.\n\nThe Two Volumes: The scripture says, \"For the sake of expounding the Dao and virtue, it is arranged in two volumes: the Dao Scripture above, the Virtue Scripture below.\"\n\nThe Two Wisdoms: The scripture says, \"The provisional and the real, saving the ignorant and the enlightened.\"\n\nThe Two Officials: Refers to the Highest Celestial and the Highest Spirit.\n\nThe Three Heavens: 1. The Primordial *Qi* transforms into the Pure Mists Heaven, 2. The Mysterious *Qi* transforms into the Yu-Remainder Heaven, 3. The Original *Qi* transforms into the Great Red Heaven.\n\nThe Three Worthies: The superior worthy attains the Dao and ascends to become a celestial official; the middle worthy attains the Dao and dwells on Kunlun; the inferior worthy attains the Dao and lives long in the mortal world. Again, the Three Worthies: The superior worthy’s *qi* surges, riding the sun and moon upon the void; the middle worthy’s transformation is hidden, seated yet present, standing yet absent; the inferior worthy’s extinction is complete, becoming a Wheel-Turning Sage King.\n\nThe Three Essences: The yang essence is the sun, the yin essence is the moon, and the harmonious essence is the stars.\n\nThe Three Palaces: The Left Palace of the Jade Purity, the Right Palace of the Jade Purity, and the Central Palace of the Jade Purity.\n\nThe Three *Qì*: 1. The golden *qì*, which governs the upper primordial and the heavens—heaven being *qián* (the creative), so the golden *qì* rules it, thus dispelling celestial calamities. 2. The yellow *qì*, which governs the lower primordial and the earth—earth being *kūn* (the receptive), which contains the yellow, so the yellow *qì* rules it, thus rescuing the seven ancestors, who might otherwise fear the underworld. 3. The white *qì*, which governs the central primordial and humanity—those who receive the *qì* are endowed with virtue, and jade embodies virtue, hence the white *qì* rules kings and nobles.\n\nThe Three Stages: Having, having-not, neither having nor not—these are the three stages of form. Having yin, having yang, having harmony—these are the three stages of *qi*. Having wisdom, having foolishness, having mediocrity—these are the three stages of divine consciousness. Having sharpness, having dullness, having balance—these are the three stages of talent and application.\n\nIn all, fifteen matters, sharing the same origin and *qi*. The Three Worlds: The past without limit, the future without limit, the present without limit. The Three Naturals: Those with sharp roots study the great naturalness, guard the void, and master transformation and death, becoming the ancestors of all ages.»",

      "translated_text": "At that time, the Celestial Sovereign instructed **Sea-Empty Wisdom-Hoard** (海空智藏):\n\n*\"You must understand that the **Great Saints of the Ten Directions** (十方大圣) enter the Dao/Way through three progressive stages of ten transformations each, ascending in order. You must now carefully listen to the ten transformations, for they differ entirely from the three preceding stages.\n\nWhat are these three stages? First, the **Stage of Faith** (信阶); second, the **Stage of Practice** (行阶); third, the **Stage of Dedication** (回向阶).\n\nWithin the **Stage of Faith** (信膈), there are ten states of mind. What are these ten? First, the **Mind of Faith** (信心); second, the **Mind of Advancement** (进心); third, the **Mind of Reflection** (念心); fourth, the **Mind of Wisdom** (慧心); fifth, the **Mind of Concentration** (定心); sixth, the **Mind of Precepts** (戒心); seventh, the **Mind of Dedication** (回向心); eighth, the **Mind of Dharma Protection** (护法心); ninth, the **Mind of Renunciation** (舍法心); tenth, the **Mind of Aspiration** (愿心).\n\nWithin the **Stage of Practice** (行阶), there are ten practices: the **Mind of Faith** (信), the **Mind of Advancement** (进), the **Mind of Reflection** (念), the **Mind of Wisdom** (慧), the **Mind of Concentration** (定), the **Mind of Precepts** (戒), the **Mind of Dedication** (回向), the **Mind of Dharma Protection** (护法), the **Mind of Renunciation** (舍法), and the **Mind of Aspiration** (愿心)—these are the ten practices.\n\nWithin the **Stage of Dedication** (回向阶), there are ten dedicatory practices: the **Mind of Faith** (信心), the **Mind of Advancement** (进心), the **Mind of Reflection** (念心), the **Mind of Wisdom** (慧心), the **Mind of Concentration** (定心), the **Mind of Precepts** (戒心), the **Mind of Dedication** (回向心), the **Mind of Dharma Protection** (护法心), the **Mind of Renunciation** (舍法心), and the **Mind of Aspiration** (愿心)—these are the ten dedicatory practices, comprising the three stages of aspiration.\n\nThe **method of entering the Dao/Way** (入道方便) relies on **victorious aspiration** (胜心) to proceed into the ten transformations, which are entirely distinct from the previous ten.\n\nWhat are these ten? First, the **Transformation of True Realization** (证实转); second, the **Transformation of Removing Obstacles** (离障转); third, the **Transformation of Radiant Clarity and Counteraction** (光明对治转); fourth, the **Transformation of Wisdom-Fire Consuming** (智火烧然转); fifth, the **Transformation of Subduing Demons** (权魔胜转); sixth, the **Transformation of Manifesting Virtues** (现前显德转); seventh, the **Transformation of Illuminating the Distant Path** (远行光惠转); eighth, the **Transformation of Unchanging Non-Duality** (相无相不动转); ninth, the **Transformation of Concentration and Wisdom in Harmony** (定慧相应转); tenth, the **Transformation of Ultimate Dharma Realm** (法地究竟转).\n\n**Sea-Empty Wisdom-Hoard**, these ten transformations are the same as those taught by the Celestial Sovereign in the **past, future, and present three worlds** (过去未来见在三世), though spoken at different times, to be praised and countered.\n\nThe **True Person** (道心真人) faces ten kinds of obstacles in their aspiration to the Dao/Way. What are these ten? First, the obstacle of **countering the defilements of beings** (对治众生障); second, the obstacle of **countering the evil deeds of beings** (对治众生邪行障); third, the obstacle of **not understanding or enduring the teachings upon hearing or reflection** (於闻思修习受忍不通障); fourth, the obstacle of **arrogance arising from self-liberation** (自六解发心起高慢障); fifth, the obstacle of **egoistic attachment to the nature of dharmas** (我慢众人障); sixth, the obstacle of **habitual defilements from prior transformations** (除十转己前烦恼习障); seventh, the obstacle of **subtle defilements of wisdom** (除细法智障); eighth, the obstacle of **remaining deluded despite severing ignorance** (断无明有障); ninth, the obstacle of **not abandoning unwholesome deeds** (断不善利佗障); tenth, the obstacle of **not attaining freedom in the Dharma** (於法示得自在障).\n\n**Sea-Empty Wisdom-Hoard True Person**, to sever these ten obstacles of entering the Dao/Way, practices and extinguishes them utterly, so that they do not arise again. Thus, the ten transformations are established.\n\nWhy? The reason for naming these transformations from **True Realization** (证实) to **Ultimate Dharma Realm** (地究竟) is to benefit beings, gradually enlightening their wisdom and leading them into the transformations of the Dao/Way.\n\nThe meaning of the ten transformations is as follows:\n\nThe **First Transformation of True Realization** (证实转) is to **attain insight into the true and wondrous nature of the Dao/Way** (证见道性真实妙理).\n\nThe **Second Transformation of Removing Obstacles** (离障转) is to **obtain pure and wondrous precepts**, fully endowed with purity, **removing defilements and avarice**, hence the name.\n\nThe **Third Transformation of Radiant Clarity and Counteraction** (光明对治转) is to **reflect upon and practice flawless teachings**, **illuminating and manifesting** them clearly.\n\nThe **Fourth Transformation of Wisdom-Fire Consuming** (智火烧然转) is to **burn defilements to ashes with the fire of wisdom** (烦恼成薪，智火烧烬).\n\nThe **Fifth Transformation of Subduing Demons** (摧魔胜转) is to **acquire transcendent, flawless wisdom**, **virtuous means**, and **freedom from all defilements**, **abandoning the defiled mind**, and **subduing all demons** (降伏众魔).\n\nThe **Sixth Transformation of Manifesting Virtues** (现前显德转) is to **enter profound wisdom**, **reach the other shore**, and **benefit all beings** (自佗俱利), **manifesting the virtues of wisdom** (智德现前).\n\nThe **Seventh Transformation of Illuminating the Distant Path** (远行光慧转) is to **practice the Dharma of non-duality**, **culminating in its power**, **like a traveler gradually moving away from home** (去我渐远).\n\nThe **Eighth Transformation of Unchanging Non-Duality** (不动转) is to **refine the fruits of virtue**, **remaining undisturbed in the practice of non-duality** (於无相行中无间阙).\n\nThe **Ninth Transformation of Concentration and Wisdom in Harmony** (定慧相应转) is to **attain unobstructed wisdom**, **benefiting all beings in teaching the Dharma** (向众生说法成就中利佗).\n\nThe **Tenth Transformation of Ultimate Dharma Realm** (法地究竟转) is to **obtain the Dharma Body**, **perfect in all virtues**, and **ultimately free** (毕竟自在).\n\nThus, the **Great Bodhisattva** (大士) receives the **position of the Dharma King** (法王位), akin to a **prince attaining sovereignty among all kings** (太子於诸王中而得自在).\n\nEven in this position of the ten transformations, **subtle obstacles remain**, as **liberation has not yet been fully attained**. To counter these **subtle, habitual obstacles** (微细障), one must not yet have **entered the Celestial Sovereign’s realm** (证入天尊地).\n\nIn this stage, **all practices are consummated**, **all virtues are perfected**, **the Dao/Way’s nature is fully realized**, and **wisdom and virtue are equal and undivided**. The **Five Aggregates and Three Powers** (五大三德) are complete, and the **ten virtues of the Dharma** (十法) are fully attained, **culminating in the Three Bodies and the Dharma Response** (三身法报应等), with **aspirations and virtues perfected**.\n\nWhat are these **ten virtues of the Dharma** (十法具足)?
