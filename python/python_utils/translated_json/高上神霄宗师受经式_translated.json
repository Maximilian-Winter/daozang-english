scroll\n**Source:** *Canon of the Orthodox Daoist Treasure (正統道藏)*, First Section\n\n---\n\n**Highest Supreme Celestial Master Scripture-Receiving Ritual**\n\nThe Most August Saint unfurls the sacred diagram,\nIlluminating brilliance spreads in splendor.\nThe essence of True Primordial is refined,\nWondrous patterns emit their fragrant virtue.\n\nIn the early days of the Great Cataclysm, at the dawn of Vermilion Clarity,\nThe Most High Lord of Primordial Origin rode the Vermilion Chaos,\nAccumulating the sacred *qi* of the Great Primordial,\nManifesting in the Eastern Heaven of Beginning Azure,\nAmong the Ten Directions’ Celestial Immortals, the Most August Saints,\nThe Wondrous Conduct True Persons—\nAn innumerable assembly—\nProclaimed the *Lingbao Degren* (Soul-Treasure Scripture for Deliverance) and the Celestial Master Scriptures,\nAnd bestowed them upon the Jade Canopy Most High Dao Lord.\n\nThereupon, He commanded the Celestial Immortal Sovereign and the Upper Clarity Immortals\nTo compile the essential meanings,\nArrange the graded teachings,\nAnd together compose sixty volumes,\nCorresponding to the Six Heavenly Stems,\nAll beginning with *Wuliang Degren* (Infinite Deliverance).\n\nWhen the scriptures were complete,\nThey were presented to the Void Sovereign,\nAnd stored in the Purple Micro Palace above.\nThey were entrusted to the Celestial Master, the True King of Jade Clarity,\nSealed within the Jade Chamber of the Eastern Extremity’s Splendid Hall,\nTo be transmitted only in a later kalpa.\n\nIn the era of the Flourishing Song Dynasty,\nWhen the *qi* of Great Peace prevailed,\nAt the auspicious juncture of Celestial Master’s descent,\nHe was destined to become the sovereign of mortals.\nThus, the Green Flower Emperor, His younger brother,\nWas appointed to oversee the Celestial Treasury,\nWhile the True King received the Celestial Mandate,\nInheriting the august lineage,\nRuling the Nine Realms,\nHarmonizing the Ten Thousand States,\nManifesting the Dao’s transformation,\nAnd proclaiming the sacred wind of the Primordial.\n\nAfter the reign of *Rénchén* (1144 CE),\nThe Green Flower Emperor secretly convened in the Forbidden Palace,\nDivine correspondence was perfected,\nHeaven and humanity communed—\nThus, the appointed time was revealed.\n\nThen, the True King ascended in spirit,\nPiercing the Purple Clarity,\nAnd from the Celestial Master’s Jade Chamber,\nHe retrieved the *Lingbao Zhenjing* (Soul-Treasure True Scripture) in sixty volumes.\nAdditionally, in ancient times,\nHe had served the Primordial Origin,\nAscending together to the *Yùluó* (Jade Net),\nWitnessing the sacred *qi* of the Three Primordials’ luminous net,\nAnd thus composed the *Highest Supreme Celestial Master Jade Clarity Secret Talismans* in three volumes,\nWhich had been meticulously examined in the era of the Most High Emperor,\nVerified in the Purple Micro Constellation,\nAnd likewise kept secret within the Celestial Master’s kalpa-long prohibition.\nNow, they are to be revealed.\n\nHe then instructed His celestial ministers and officials\nTo adapt the scriptures and talismans to human teachings,\nClothe them in worldly forms,\nEstablish ritual frameworks,\nAnd propagate them among those of noble resolve.\n\nIf one encounters this Dao and diligently practices it,\nThey are surely those whose names were inscribed in antiquity,\nWhose forms are painted in the Three Imperial Floral Patterns,\nWhose bones are refined by the Five Radiant Energies,\nWhose inner essence is preserved by the *Kèbǎo* (Preservation Method),\nAnd who are destined for the *Rénchén* (1144 CE) deliverance—\nTrue practitioners of the Dao.\nIn the myriad kalpas,\nTo meet this moment is rare indeed—\nHow could one not strive with utmost earnestness?\n\n**The Three Masters of the Highest Supreme Celestial Dao:**\n\n- **Ancestor Master:** *Yuhuang Shangdi Yuan Shi Tianzun* (Jade Sovereign, Most High Lord of Primordial Origin)\n- **Lineage Master:** *Shang Qing Yuzhen Yuan Huang Daojun* (Upper Clarity, Jade Canopy Primordial Dao Lord)\n- **True Master:** *Gāoshàng Shénxiāo Yùqīng Zhēnwáng Chángshēng

Those who encounter this Dao preserve themselves by ascending to the Three Realms, benefit others by eradicating a hundred afflictions in the kalpa, and through their merit and virtue, attain the Celestial Highness.

These transmissions record the cultivation and attainment of the Dao by the immortal officials, as well as their governance of the Celestial Highness’ duties.\n\nAmong the Celestial Highness’ Inner Treasury’s Three Caverns and Four Auxiliaries—some have been transmitted since antiquity and are widely seen in the world, while others are forbidden and secret treasures of a thousand two hundred volumes, undivulged across kalpas. These are categorized into six grades and twelve classes, arranged into upper, middle, and lower volumes, stored in the Eastern and Western Azure Halls.

Upon attaining the Dao, they shall hold the rank of *Dōngxī Èrtái Xiānguān Chánglì Jiǔgōng Zhēnzǎi* (Eastern and Western Halls’ Immortal Officials, Long Officers, and Nine Palaces’ True Rulers).\n\nTheir ritual attire consists of:\n- The *Yùqīng Yúntái Bǎoguān* (Jade Clarity Cloud Platform Precious Crown),\n- The *Zǐlíng Cuìyù zhī zān* (Purple Spirit Jade Terrapin Hairpin),\n- The *Fēiyún Yùyā Lǜguāng zhī pèi* (Flying Clouds and Misty Glow Green Light Robe, thirty-six layers),\n- The *Hèhuáng shang fēiqīng zhī kūn* (Brown-Yellow Robe with Flying Blue Skirt),\n- The *Zhūyáng zhī lǚ* (Cinnabar-Sole Sandals),\n- The *Dònglíng Bìyáo zhī guī* (Cavern Spirit Jade Jade Tablet),\n- The *Sānqì Jiāohuī Yùpèi* (Three Breaths’ Radiant Jade Pendant),\n- The *Zhèn yào xiāomó zhī jiàn* (Shaking Demons’ Dissolving Sword, three feet six inches long),\n- And standing upon the *Tà jiǔqì zhī tán* (Platform of the Nine Breaths).\n\nIf, among the three stages, one obtains the complete volumes of the upper, middle, or lower scriptures—or even possesses one or two of the Three Caverns’ teachings in the mortal world—they shall be titled *Shenshang Tàipíng Fǔhuà Dìzǐ* (Celestial Highness Great Peace’s Auxiliary Transformation Disciple). Upon attaining the Dao, they shall hold the rank of *Zhūtiān Xiānzhēn* (Various Heavens’ Immortal Perfected) or may also be appointed as *Shénfǔ Sǎn guān Xiānlì* (Jade Treasury’s Scattered Officials and Immortal Ministers). However, they shall not yet hold the noble status of the Highest Pure Jade Heaven, nor necessarily wield the authority of the supreme ritual officials.\n\nTheir ritual attire consists of:\n- The *Sùyù Sānhuá Bìguān* (Pure Jade Triple Flower Precious Crown) or *Sān Sùyuán guān* (Three Pure Primordial Crown),\n- The *Zǐjīng Shuǐyù zhī zān* (Purple Essence Water Jade Hairpin),\n- The *Sùzǐ zhī bèi* (Pure Purple Robe, thirty-six layers),\n- The *Bìhèhuáng shang lǜqīng zhī kūn* (Dark Brown-Yellow Robe with Green-Blue Skirt),\n- The *Huánghuá Yáojiǎn Zhūlǚ* (Yellow Flower Jade Tablet Cinnabar Sandals),\n- The *Yùpèi* (Jade Pendant),\n- The *Wǔqì Dānjīng zhī jiàn* (Five Breaths’ Elixir Sword, three feet two inches long),\n- And standing upon the *Tà sānguāng Bāwéi zhī tán* (Platform of the Three Lights and Eight Halos).\n\nIf one receives the teachings and fulfills all three stages, upon attaining the Dao, they shall ascend to the position of *Sāntiān Gāohuáng Dàojūn* (Three Heavens’ High Sovereign Dao Lord), ranking equally with the saints.\n\nUnless one submits a memorial and petition to the Perfected Court for ritual inspection, one may not arbitrarily wear the ritual attire. The Spirit Officials shall investigate and punish those who fall from the Dao.\n\nThe reception ceremony for the Highest Celestial Highness’s lineage master in receiving the scriptures is complete.",

the *qi* of Great Peace prevailed,\nAt the auspicious juncture of Celestial Master’s descent,\nHe was destined to become the sovereign of mortals.\nThus, the Green Flower Emperor, His younger

It is an eternal, forbidden, and perpetually transmitted scripture across kalpas. Those who encounter this Dao preserve themselves by ascending to the Three Realms, benefit others by eradicating a hundred afflictions in the kalpa, and through their merit and virtue, attain the Celestial Highness.

It may be used to supplement the Great Cavern’s grades and worn as prescribed; its effects vary according to one’s cultivation, as stated in the original ritual.\n\n**Explanatory Commentaries**\nThe *Mixed Primordial Supreme Virtue Emperor’s* (Húnyuán Shàngdé Huángdì) *Daode* (Way and Virtue) Two Scriptures—these are the imperial compositions of the Song Emperor Huizong, the Dao Sovereign.\n*The Nanhua Zhenjing Xiaoyao You Zhēnyì Zhǐguī* (The True Meaning and Guidance of the *Zhuangzi*’s *Xiaoyao You*—The Wandering Free) is also an imperial composition of the Song Emperor Huizong, the Dao Sovereign.\n\n**Supplementary Commentaries**\nLi Yùdé’s elucidation of the *Lingbao Duren Jing*’s meaning, with a preface by the True King Lord—these are the true commentaries and explanations.\n\nThe *Gaoshang Shenshang Zhēnyù Shuō* (Highest Celestial True Jade Explanation) of the *Five-Directional Heaven’s Good-Generation-No-Killing Praise*—this originates from the *Miaojì Jingkē* (Wondrous Salvation Ritual Science) of the Celestial Highness’ Eastern Extremity Azure Hall. Reciting it resolves the calamity of unjustly harming life and cultivates the merit of good-generation and non-killing.\n\nThe *Zhènghé Yùzhì Jīnlu Zhōngkē Yí* (Political Harmony’s Imperial Composition of the Golden Register’s Central Ritual)—this ritual is for national fasting, ritual offerings, and supplications for blessings and disaster aversion.
