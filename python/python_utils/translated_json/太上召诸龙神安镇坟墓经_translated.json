Author unknown. Five scriptures in one fascicle. Base text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongxuan* Section, *Benwen* Category.\n\n---\n\nThe *Scripture of the Most High on Summoning Divine Dragons to Pacify and Guard Graves*\n\nBefore the dawn of the Primordial Radiance, the Most High Lord of the Dao, together with the divine immortals and sagely hosts of the heavens, proceeded to the ruins of Yang Valley beneath the Mulberry Grove of Chang Sang. With one heart, they bowed in reverence and addressed the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning:\n\n\"Your servants humbly observe that when the parents and kin of ordinary people pass away, their remains are interred upon the hills, tombs erected to secure their rest for ten thousand years, in hope of safeguarding descendants and bringing prosperity to posterity, that their families may flourish in wealth and honor.\n\nYet now, households tremble in distress, year after year beset by misfortune and decline. Wealth and grain dissipate, calamities strike without end, livestock fail to multiply, and fields and silkworms yield no bounty.\n\nWe, your servants, rely upon the merit of past causes and have attained felicity in this life. We prostrate ourselves before the Most High and Venerable.\"\n\nEnlighten this foolish heart, we beseech your compassionate mercy, that you might deign to reveal the truth. For these decayed bones, now enriched, have received the profound grace of the Mysterious, yet can never repay the debt of birth and nurture.\n\nThe Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning then addressed the Most High Lord of the Dao, saying: \"What you have spoken of these inauspicious calamities is deeply pitiable. To revive those sunk in delusion and bring all to dwell upon the shore of blessings, you should resume your seat and heed these decisive words.\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy declared: \"Those who suffer poverty and hardship in this present life did not believe in the Dao and its teachings in past existences, nor did they plant the seeds of good causes. In this life, their burials fail to bring benefit to the deceased across the years. The sites chosen for interment may also, in the four seasons, offend the celestial stars and terrestrial constellations, thus resulting in such misfortunes. Now, having heard your petition, I am greatly pleased. From this day forward, should any find their tombs unsettled and calamities assailing them without cease, let them seek a lofty Daoist master, establish an extensive ritual arena according to the standards of the *Lingbao* scriptures, and repent their transgressions. Summon the Dragon Kings to come and pacify the tombs, and then shall disasters melt away like ice, while blessings gather like clouds.\"\n\nThe Most High Lord of the Dao and all the assembled sages rose and bowed, each vowing to uphold these teachings. Thereupon, the Celestial Worthy summoned the great Dragon Kings, each to extend their salvific protection:\n\nThe Azure Dragon King of the Eastern Blue Emperor,\nThe Vermilion Dragon King of the Southern Red Emperor,\nThe White Dragon King of the Western White Emperor,\nThe Black Dragon King of the Northern Black Emperor,\nThe Yellow Dragon King of the Central Yellow Emperor,\nThe Auspicious Spirit Dragon King,\nThe Deep Forest Spirit Dragon King,\nThe Abundantly Kind Spirit Dragon King,\nThe Flowing Blossom Spirit Dragon King,\nThe Sweet Thought Spirit Dragon King,\nThe Kindly Radiant Spirit Dragon King,\nThe Wavelike Spirit Dragon King,\nThe Joyous Thought Spirit Dragon King,\nThe Black Dragon Spirit Dragon King,\nThe Arriving Dragon Spirit Dragon King,\nThe Responsive Dragon Spirit Dragon King,\nThe Admonishing Dragon Spirit Dragon King,\nThe Thirty-Eight Mountain Spirit Dragon Kings,\nThe Twenty-Four Direction Spirit Dragon Kings,\nThe Celestial Star and Eight Trigram Spirit Dragon Kings.\n\nThe Celestial Worthy declared: \"Each of these great Dragon Kings commands ten thousand hosts. On days of calamity, burn incense and summon them universally. The dragons shall descend, and according to your wishes, proclaim once more:\n\nThe Yearly Virtue dispels azure omens,\nMars transforms fiery disasters.\nVenus beckons the Seven Treasures,\nThe Gate of Chen welcomes flourishing returns.\nThe Central Honored One pacifies the Five Tombs,\nAll evils are utterly destroyed.\nThe divine dragons establish the Eight Directions,\nMyriad blessings come forth in abundance.\"\n\nThe Dao proclaimed: \"The names of the Dragon Kings revealed by the Celestial Worthy are the true scripture. Should any good man or good woman, in burying their dead, offend the celestial stars or transgress terrestrial prohibitions, all dragon deities shall be invited by Orthodox Unity Daoist masters to recite this scripture, invoke the divine dragons, and come to pacify the tombs. Naturally, their households shall shine with radiance, and their descendants multiply. The efficacy of this scripture is beyond measure. Those who, in life, do not believe and slander this true text shall suffer calamities extending for a hundred million generations.\"\n\nAt that time, the great assembly, having heard this scripture, all declared it inconceivable. They bowed in reverence, withdrew, and with heads touching the ground, pledged to put it into practice.\n\nHere ends *The Most High’s Scripture on Summoning the Divine Dragons to Pacify and Secure Tombs*.",
