  "full_translation": "**Hymn in Praise of the Supreme Ascent to the Mysterious Wondrous Scripture for Eliminating Disasters and Protecting Life**\n\n*Composed by Master Zhenyi, Sima Ziwei of the Tang Dynasty*\n\n**Title:** *Hymn in Praise of the Supreme Ascent to the Mysterious Wondrous Scripture for Eliminating Disasters and Protecting Life*\n*A scroll by Tang Daoist Sima Yongzhen (courtesy name Ziwei).*\n*Source text:* *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Section of Cavernous Truth*, *Category of Hymns and Praises*\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Hymn in Praise of the Supreme Ascent to the Mysterious Wondrous Scripture for Eliminating Disasters and Protecting Life**\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy manifests across the Three Realms, compassionately pitying the Four Kinds of Beings. He opens the gate of myriad wonders and delivers those from boundless suffering. Thus, he bestows the scriptures of the mysterious teaching and subtly intones the wondrous sound, enabling the unhearing to hear and the unenlightened to awaken.\n\nThis scripture was composed by the Supreme Venerable Sovereign, the Most High Lord Lao. Its purport is the root of the wondrous nature and the origin of the ten thousand dharmas. Though its text is concise, its principles run profoundly deep—like a single hair swallowing the waves of the four seas, or a tiny grain containing an immeasurable multitude. Its numinosity is unfathomable, its wisdom beyond explication. It cannot be sought through sound nor perceived through form. Remote yet without exclusion, near yet without intimacy, pursued yet unseen ahead, awaited yet unapproachable from behind. Above the highest, it cannot be ascended by steps. Mysterious beyond the mysterious, it cannot be heard.\n\nIt precedes Heaven yet is not ancient, enduring through vast kalpas without end. Revered yet nameless, exalted yet without rank, it pervades myriad transformations in an instant, boundless and fleeting. When it illumines, even the sun and moon wane; when it sustains, even Heaven and Earth are not all-encompassing. Adapting to conditions, it transforms and guides; confronting circumstances, it forgets the mind. It resolves the web of doubt to enter the mysterious teaching, leading the wheel of rebirth to return to the path of awakening. It disperses the remnant qi to nurture the multitudes of beings. Lose it, and time flees like rushing water; preserve it, and one remains ageless beyond the later Heaven.\n\nThose who revile it wield vast brooms to sweep Mount Kunlun; those who delve into it resemble swans and herons drinking from the vast sea. Thus, the mysterious words remain unexpressed, and the sagely Dao is hard to manifest. Even with cultivation, mere recitation abounds; though one may hear it at dawn and die by dusk, none have truly grasped it. Undeterred by my inadequacy, I have presumptuously composed this hymn.\n\n---\n\n**Hymn in Praise of the Supreme Ascent to the Mysterious Wondrous Scripture for Eliminating Disasters and Protecting Life**\n\nAdrift in the River of Love, blown by the Sea of Desire—\nWho says the river and sea are vast? Their depths may yet be known.\nBut the passions of love and desire have no bottom—when shall escape come?\n\nEnsnared in sound and form,\nLike waterfowl and wind through forests, all return to the single Dharma-sound.\nYet how does the inverted nature arise, spawning a myriad minds?\n\nBewildered by existence and non-existence,\nEmptiness contains forms, forms return to emptiness.\nIf the mind is clear and discerning, it wields existence and non-existence at will.\n\nNo-emptiness and emptiness, no-form and form—\nNo-emptiness is not empty; no-form is not formless.\nIf one knows form and emptiness, both form and emptiness are naturally attained.\n\nNo-nothing and nothing, existence and no-existence—\nExistence includes no-existence; nothing encompasses existence and non-existence.\nWith a vacant mind, unmoved, the wondrous Dao naturally abides.\n\nFrom beginning to end, obscured and dim, unable to illuminate itself—\nLike one entering darkness, what can the eyes perceive?\nTo see clearly, one must rely on the lamp of vast kalpas.\n\nUltimately deluded,\nWith form and formlessness, confusion persists.\nNot yet awakened to the luminous nature, how can doubts be resolved?\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declares:\n\"All you sentient beings—\nYour natures are inferior, lost to the root of the Dao.\nI specially proclaim this principle to guide you into the wondrous gate.\n\nFrom non-existence arises existence; from non-nothing arises nothing.\nThings emerge from non-existence; the Dao vanishes within existence.\nDo not cling to views of existence and non-existence—delusion will dissolve on its own.\n\nNo-form within form, no-emptiness within emptiness—\nEmptiness and form mutually arise, entwined like tangled ink.\nTo know the principle of emptiness and form, do not separate emptiness from form.\n\nNot-existence as existence, not-nothing as nothing—\nThe nature of the Dao is fundamentally empty and non-existent, yet even emptiness and non-existence are provisional names.\nIf one clings to views of existence and non-existence, one remains bound by dharmas.\n\nNot-form as form, not-emptiness as emptiness—\nNon-emptiness is true emptiness; non-form is true form.\nWhen emptiness and form are thus, they become real—yet where is the true Dharma found?\n\nEmptiness is emptiness, yet emptiness is not fixed;\nForm is form, yet form is not fixed.\nThis emptiness and this form—ultimately, they are not separate.\nTo recognize true emptiness and form, turn the mind inward and observe the self.\n\nForm is emptiness, emptiness is form.\nIf one knows emptiness is not empty and form is not form,\nEmptiness and form should both be dissolved—no need to grasp one corner.\nForm and emptiness are unobstructed; the original nature is thusness itself.\n\nThis is called illumination, the beginning of attaining the wondrous sound.\nThe wondrous sound is likened to the empty nature, yet the empty mind is not the wondrous sound.\nTo grasp even a hair’s worth of it is to lose the freedom of the mind.\n\nComprehending the Dharma of no-emptiness, perceiving without obstruction—\nWith one mind, observe all things; all dharmas are the same.\nIf one understands thus, true wisdom is attained.\n\nEntering the gate of myriad wonders, natural awakening arises.\nAwakening to the root of nature is called entering the wondrous gate.\nThe wondrous gate is the expedient Dharma—do not cling to this Dharma.\n\nFree from the web of doubts, unattached to views of emptiness—\nShatter the net of doubt; neither existence nor non-existence pertains.\nWith a rectified mind, abide in eternal ease, as if ascending a clouded plateau.\n\nPurify the six senses, sever perverse obstructions—\nWith a tranquil mind, the six senses are pure; the six senses follow the nature.\nIf the nature is unattached to things, where do perverse obstructions arise?\n\nThus, I expound this wondrous scripture for you, named *The Scripture for Protecting Life*.\nThe wondrous scripture is the unobstructed nature; provisionally, it is given this name.\nI speak it for the sake of sentient beings, that they may awaken to this scripture.\n\nDeliver sentient beings, carry it with you as an offering—\nThe One Reality delivers all, like an oar crossing the raging current.\nThe true nature is always with you—do not seek it outside the self.\n\nDisseminate the teaching in the world, circulate and recite it—\nPropagate the principle of emptiness; let it spread throughout the world.\nRecite the scripture ten thousand times, and its meaning will become clear.\n\nThen shall the Flying Heavenly Deva-Kings and the Diamond Warriors Who Shatter Evil...\"*\n\nThe true nature is called the Divine King;\nThe Flying Heavenly Ones have no fixed abode.\nThey dispel evil from without,\nUnshakable as diamond.\n\nThe Dharma-Protecting Spirit Youths, the Salvation-from-Suffering Perfected Ones, the Golden Essence Fierce Beasts—\nThe Spirit Youths are the true nature;\nUnstained, they are called Perfected Ones.\nFierce as lions,\nTheir names differ, yet they share one Dharmakāya.\n\nHundreds of millions of hosts,\nAll come to guard and serve this scripture.\nAll devas and all holy multitudes—\nNot one, not two,\nTheir nature does not follow the flowing waves:\nThis is called true guardianship.\n\nWherever offerings are made,\nThey ward off calamity and sustain the weak.\nIn speech or silence, in movement or rest,\nNot a single thought of arising arises.\nForgetting form, they merge into the indistinct,\nWhere neither gods nor ghosts can spy.\n\nThey deliver all sentient beings,\nFreeing them from all defilements.\nThe true Dharma delivers the perverse Dharma;\nSentient beings see with partial vision.\nIf one generates no seeing,\nThe field of the mind is defiled.\n\nThen the Heavenly Venerable spoke these verses:\nThe Heavenly Venerable repeated the verses,\nDirectly pointing to the source of the mind,\nThat all may return to the gate of liberation.\n\nSeeing does not perceive me;\nHearing does not attain me.\nThe Dao is not in seeing or hearing—\nSeeing and hearing breed doubt.\nResponding to things as they arise,\nWith an empty mind, it may be known.\n\nDeparting from all extremes,\nThis is called the wondrous Dao.\nThe mind doubts, following the ten thousand conditions;\nFollowing conditions, it mistakes the field of the mind.\nThe Dao is not being or non-being—\nOnly then is it called departing from all extremes.\n\n*The Laudatory Verses of the Supreme Ascension to the Mysterious, Disaster-Dispelling, Life-Protecting Wondrous Scripture* concludes.",
