Taiyi is invisible. It emerges from Earth, thus the yang lies below. Form and substance are yet undifferentiated, the dark and yellow intermingled—this is the hidden virtue of the dragon. It is said that qi arises from below, stirring beneath the Earth and responding above the Heaven, thus generating being from non-being.\n\nMoreover, the essence of Heaven and Earth, when received from Heaven, activates and manifests as the Qian (Heaven), with heavenly qi ascending to become clouds and mist. When received from Earth, it activates and manifests as the Kun (Earth), with earthly qi descending to become fog and dew. Those who preserve this will see great endeavors flourish and prosper.\n\n**Taichu (The Great Beginning)**\nTaichu is the beginning of qi, arising from Kan (the Abysmal). Thus, it transforms and becomes the One. The One is the beginning of yang, the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth. It traverses the Nine Provinces and culminates in Qian. Qian is strength. Beginning in Kan and completing its first movement, it is called the \"first yang line (初九).\" It nourishes all things and aids the multitude, its qi and function inexhaustible, cycling endlessly—thus it is called \"eternal life.\"\n\n**Taishi (The Great Commencement)**\nTaishi is the beginning of form, named the \"vessel.\" It transforms once more into the Seven. The Seven is the position of fire in the south. With yin and yang in harmonious union, the myriad things grow and thrive. To the left, it transforms into Li (Fire), symbolizing the sun; to the right, it transforms into Kan (Water), symbolizing the moon. The sun belongs to Heaven and revolves leftward; the moon belongs to Earth and turns rightward. The two qi intermingle, forming Taisu (the Great Simplicity), and give rise to the second movement—thus it is called the \"second yang line (九二).\" It reaches the Supreme Ultimate, which divides into the Two Modes (yin and yang) and generates the Eight Trigrams. The Eight Trigrams are called \"models and images.\" No model or image is greater than Heaven and Earth; no luminosity in Heaven and Earth is greater than the sun and moon. The sun and moon move and change over time—how can the Dao of their transformations be fully fathomed?\n\n**Taisu (The Great Simplicity)**\nTaisu is the beginning of substance and qi. Form and substance are complete, called the \"Great Image,\" yet they remain undivided—thus it is called \"chaos,\" containing all without dispersion. All things are nurtured and cultivated through these Three Beginnings, forming the third movement—thus it is called the \"third yang line (九三).\" Qian (Heaven) attains its substance, and Kun (Earth) is born. Following the pattern of the six in the fifth place, yin qi arises—thus it is said that \"the sun and moon are like conjoined jade disks.\" Preserve this and never forget its mechanism.\n\nTherefore, the seasons and solar terms have their measures. If one does not generate regret or delusion, then outwardly, the circular form is encircled by blue-green qi. The six pitch-pipes mirror the Dipper’s establishment—thus the *Book of Changes* states: \"The noble person, when at rest, observes its images and recites its words; when in motion, observes its changes and recites its oracles.\" Therefore, clouds, dragons, wind, and rain—day and night—all transformations reside within.\n\nWhite takes its image from metal, the west. Black takes its image from water, the north. Within Kan lies the yang pearl—this is its symbol. From *zi* (midnight), preserve its purity until *si* (morning), marking the end and the birth of obscurity. The square and the circle are the guardians of their offices. Above, they do not reside in Heaven; below, they do not reside in the fields. In silent stillness, they preserve one another, and spirit and qi do not disperse.\n\nThose who obstruct and smother it cause Heaven and Earth to close and stagnate. Those who facilitate its flow allow yin and yang to generate and complete. The work of generation and completion is the principle of the world. It transforms seven times and becomes nine. Nine is Qian. The cycle of yin and yang concludes and returns to its beginning. From *wu* (noon), preserve its obscurity until *hai* (midnight), marking the end and the return to purity—thus Kan (Water) and the ruler and minister each attain their proper positions. Ending and beginning anew, it is called \"self-renewing without cease.\" It is said that when one ends, it regenerates. The theory of the Four Images concludes in Gen (Mountain) and begins in Zhen (Thunder).\n\nPreserving life and maintaining nature—this is the achievement of the tortoise, snake, dragon, and crane, who guard the primordial and do not disperse. This teaching is imparted only to those who are cautious and do not deviate from the Dao.\n\n**End of *Qian Yuanzi’s Treatise on the Three Beginnings***",
