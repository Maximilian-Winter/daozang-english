  "full_translation": "The Supreme Perfected of the Mysterious Unity, the Most High, expounds *The Sutra of Wondrous Communication and Turning the Spirit to Enter Samādhi* #1\n\nThe Dao speaks: Those who revolve through the cycle of rebirth without perishing may return to be born among humans, endowed with keen intelligence, a harmonious heart, and a gentle disposition. If they are devoted to the Three Treasures, aspire to the immortals, and contemplate meritorious deeds, they should broadly cultivate the field of blessings. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, they may practice wondrous communication, turn the spirit, and enter samādhi, thereby attaining the utmost perfection.\n\nIf the practice of the Dao is incomplete, immortality will not be achieved. Since time immemorial, across countless kalpas, those who have accumulated learning and become perfected immortals and the natural Daoists of the ten directions have all attained this through their deeds and conduct. By restraining the mind, steadfast in resolve, sitting in contemplation of the subtle, every movement and stillness becomes an act of turning the spirit—thus attaining the rank of high immortals.\n\nTheir thoughts are most subtle, their contemplations most vast, boundless and immeasurable. When conduct is perfected and samādhi entered, they attain the immortals’ way. You must diligently practice, for it will surely accord with the heart of the Dao.\n\nThe Dao speaks: If you study the immortals’ way, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally attain long life. Your body and my spirit will enter samādhi and wondrous communication.\n\nIf you honor your teacher and lineage, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally receive instruction and discipline. Your body and my spirit will together uphold the precepts.\n\nIf you uphold the scriptural teachings, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally attain wisdom. Your body and my spirit will together ascend as immortals.\n\nIf you attend lectures and expositions, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally gain insight through listening. Your body and my spirit will comprehend the profound meaning.\n\nIf you witness the observance of purity and sincerity, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally enter the Dharma. Your body and my spirit will be inwardly and outwardly pure and solemn.\n\nIf you witness the burning of incense, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally enter fragrance and splendor. Your body and my spirit will not tread in defilement.\n\nIf you behold the Three Luminaries, let your thoughts be boundless, and all darkness will universally dissolve. Your body and my spirit will abide eternally in radiance.\n\nIf you see drifting clouds, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally be enveloped. Your body and my spirit will together enter the cloud-wheel.\n\nIf you see the pouring rain, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally receive its moisture. Your body and my spirit will be blessed by the heavens’ shade and nourishment.\n\nIf you see pristine snow, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally dwell in purity. Your body and my spirit will congeal qi and attain perfection.\n\nIf you see frost and dew, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will preserve integrity without decline. Your body and my spirit will be without restraint.\n\nIf you see pure water, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally bathe. Your body and my spirit will wash away filth and impurity.\n\nIf you see a great river, let your thoughts be boundless, and its depths will universally flow. Your body and my spirit will be all-embracing.\n\nIf you see a great mountain, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally find shelter. Your body and my spirit will dwell in mountain caves.\n\nIf you see trees, let your thoughts be boundless, and they will universally remain undecayed. Your body and my spirit will flourish as a lush forest.\n\nIf you see planting, let your thoughts be boundless, and growth will be universal. Your body and my spirit will thrive with the sun.\n\nIf you see an orchard, let your thoughts be boundless, and fruition will be universal. Your body and my spirit will bear fruit and take root.\n\nIf you see flying birds, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally traverse the sky. Your body and my spirit will grow feathers and wings in due time.\n\nIf you see birds and beasts, let your thoughts be boundless, and no harmful intent will arise. Your body and my spirit will retreat to study in secluded forests.\n\nIf you see palace towers, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally gaze upon them. Your body and my spirit will become Wheel-Turning Kings.\n\nIf you see city walls, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally enter the court. Your body and my spirit will be refined and solemn.\n\nIf you see terraces and observatories, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally behold the eight directions. Your body and my spirit will perceive the subtle and hidden.\n\nIf you see a sacred altar, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally tread the Dharma gate. Your body and my spirit will attain the Dao of non-action.\n\nIf you see a youth, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally transcend the body.

Your body and my spirit will plant and grow in unison.\n\nIf you see a dwelling, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally find shelter. Your body and my spirit will have orderly and solemn abodes.\n\nIf you see evening repose, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally attain tranquility. Your body and my spirit will rest together in the void.\n\nIf you rise at dawn, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally attain clarity.

Blessings cover the boundless; the spirit turns and enters subtlety, penetrating the minute and plumbing the profound. When body and Dao become one, and thoughts are settled, you will sit and descend in the cloud-dragon’s eight-jewel carriage, flying upward to the Palace of Supreme Clarity.\n\nThe verse of boundless wondrous communion and turning the spirit says:\nWondrous communion turns my spirit,\nVast and universal, boundless merit.\nThe Dao completes the kalpas of heaven and earth,\nIts wheel of transformation unfolds the nine heavens.\nExtinction and rebirth, life and death,\nEach has its cause and condition, each its origin.\nWho awakens to the reasons for going and coming?\nForm and soul have no beginning or end.\nAccumulated blessings rest upon the foundation of fortune,\nThe body escapes the peak of five perils.\nFreed from the three evil destinies,\nOne enters the serene void, light and free.\nThoughts ferry boundless realms,\nSettled contemplation evokes spiritual communion.\nThe Dharma is conveyed to the three degrees’ field,\nTransforming into a lofty immortal lord.\nI turn my steps of the great *chun* tree,\nSoaring to the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate.\n\nThe Dao says: The *Scripture on Boundless Wondrous Communion and Turning the Spirit to Samādhi* entirely governs the practice of the Dao. A single thought unites form and spirit, universally entering the utmost truth. It was received by the Highest Lord of the Dao, the August Jade Emperor. The supreme sages and perfected ones of the ten directions who have attained the immortal Dao all cultivate this method to broadly deliver the boundless. Its blessings are vast and universal, bestowing grace without exception. Its merit equals heaven and earth, its achievements shine like the sun and moon. Those who study without this method lack sufficient Dao-practice; how then can they achieve immortality? Yet what the Highest Lord values is not practiced in the world, and few possess its text. Should one obtain it, the immortal Dao is spontaneously achieved. All should present offerings of gold and silk as tokens of sincerity, approach a master to request transmission, for the Dao treasures its methods, and without sincerity, they cannot be practiced. To transmit lightly is to treat them as worthless; to cultivate emptily is to debase the Dao. Both incur the judgment of the wind-blade; be warned and take heed.\n\nThe Dao says: My *Scripture of the Wondrous Wheel of the Dao* comes from the immeasurable. Even kalpas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges cannot compare. The formation and dissolution of heaven and earth cannot be reckoned; all scriptures may perish, but my scripture will not. It turns with the cycles, its transformations ever more flourishing, delivering the boundless. Among scriptures, it is supreme, like the heavens opening to transformation. Without this scripture, the Dharma cannot spread. As all teachings unfold, this scripture is their origin. As all stars shine universally, this scripture is like the moon at its brightest, most luminous, illuminating the ten directions. As the three realms lie in dark obscurity, this scripture is like the rising sun, universally illuminating all heavens, none left unbrightened. As the myriad rivers flow, this scripture is like the abyss of Tanggu, the source of the great sea, to which all return. As Kunlun is lofty, this scripture is like the Jade Capital Mountain, encompassing all. This scripture is subtle and wondrous, enduring with heaven and earth. The primordial kings of the heavens, the lofty immortals and perfected ones—numberless beyond reckoning—all receive its command.\n\nThus it universally saves sentient beings. Whether they study or not, it instructs the three vehicles, broadly opening the Dharma-gates. Above, it orders the Three Luminaries; in the middle, it harmonizes yin and yang; below, it unfolds the myriad lives. All receive its sheltering shade, their seven generations delivered, their destitute souls turned and liberated. Birth and death, injury and ruin—none fail to be perfected. Its wheel turns without ceasing, like a boat ferrying people.\n\nThose who cultivate this scripture with unwavering devotion swiftly summon the dragon-chariot, ascending in broad daylight, dwelling in peace and sitting in uprightness. Those who contemplate this scripture see their households flourish, a hundred blessings like mountains. Their sons and daughters are talented and wise; wealth and honor grow daily. Kings, lords, and nobles who venerate this scripture attain limitless rank, producing generations of worthy and enlightened rulers. Women in seclusion who contemplate this scripture transform their bodies into men. Those in dark obscurity who contemplate this scripture immediately find release, clearly beholding the Eight Clarities. Those who lodge alone in fear who contemplate this scripture see demons and goblins vanish, as if ten thousand people shared the room. Those who encounter venomous beasts in desolate mountains who contemplate this scripture see the beasts retreat in hiding, unharmed. Those who cross great rivers and meet wind and waves who contemplate this scripture see rivers and seas grow still, dragons emerging to welcome them. Those who enter fire who contemplate this scripture remain unburned, the flames extinguishing themselves. Those who enter epidemics and the midst of ten thousand ghosts who contemplate this scripture see ghosts and toxins vanish, the sick restored to health. Those afflicted with dire illness who contemplate this scripture cast off calamity, forever preserving long life. Those in destitution and starvation who contemplate this scripture swallow qi and partake of its nourishment, becoming sated. Those imprisoned in dungeons and heavy fetters who contemplate this scripture see their bonds released, spared from punishment. Those seized by officials and clerks who contemplate this scripture see their shackles undone, the clerks rejoicing. Those with enemies who contemplate this scripture find their hearts gladdened and resentment dissolved, becoming closest kin. Those who meet bandits and blades who contemplate this scripture see the bandits retreat, blades kept at bay.\n\nThis scripture is the refuge of the three realms, delivering sentient beings from peril and distress, liberating them from the three evil destinies and the eight difficulties. In the midst of the five sufferings, none are endured. Its sheltering shade extends without limit; its blessings are beyond measure. Those who honor this scripture may be called the gate to the boundless.\n\nThe Most High Mysterious Unity Perfected One addressed the Immortal Duke, saying: \"I have received the command of the Most High to transmit to you the *Exhortation Scripture of Wondrous Teachings*, expounding the Dharma and proclaiming the doctrine—its subtlety reaches its utmost. Its text has been kept secret in the Most High’s Purple Tenuity Palace; unless one bears the office of Immortal Duke, its text cannot be seen. Today I reveal its precepts to perfect your immortality. You should treasure and guard them in secrecy, diligently practice the Dao to achieve perfection, and you shall be welcomed into the Palace of the Great Ultimate.\"\n\nThe Immortal Duke bowed his head, received the precepts, and departed in reverence.\n\n*Scripture of the Most High’s Cavernous Mystery, Numinous Treasure, True Unity, Wheel of Exhortation and Precepts, Wondrous Dharma* #14 (end)\n\n[Note: The following is the third section of the scripture. The Dunhuang version is titled *Scripture of the Most High Mysterious Unity Perfected One’s True Radiance, Expounding the Wondrous Penetration of the Boundless, Turning the Spirit, and Entering Samādhi*.]",

      "translated_text": "If you wear clogs or sandals, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally ride the phoenix. Your body and my spirit will tread upon purple clouds.\n\nIf you see a boat, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally attain crossing. Your body and my spirit will be unbound by bridges.\n\nIf you see a chariot, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally cease walking. Your body and my spirit will together spur flying carriages.\n\nIf you see a horse, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally gain flying steps. Your body and my spirit will ride clouds and mount dragons.\n\nIf you see the Great Clarity, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally receive emptiness and stillness. Your body and my spirit will ascend to the Golden Portals.\n\nForty-five thoughts equal the merit of heaven and earth, their number following the Dao of nature. Blessings cover the boundless; the spirit turns and enters subtlety, penetrating the minute and plumbing the profound. When body and Dao become one, and thoughts are settled, you will sit and descend in the cloud-dragon’s eight-jewel carriage, flying upward to the Palace of Supreme Clarity.\n\nThe verse of boundless wondrous communion and turning the spirit says:\nWondrous communion turns my spirit,\nVast and universal, boundless merit.\nThe Dao completes the kalpas of heaven and earth,\nIts wheel of transformation unfolds the nine heavens.\nExtinction and rebirth, life and death,\nEach has its cause and condition, each its origin.\nWho awakens to the reasons for going and coming?\nForm and soul have no beginning or end.\nAccumulated blessings rest upon the foundation of fortune,\nThe body escapes the peak of five perils.\nFreed from the three evil destinies,\nOne enters the serene void, light and free.\nThoughts ferry boundless realms,\nSettled contemplation evokes spiritual communion.\nThe Dharma is conveyed to the three degrees’ field,\nTransforming into a lofty immortal lord.\nI turn my steps of the great *chun* tree,\nSoaring to the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate.\n\nThe Dao says: The *Scripture on Boundless Wondrous Communion and Turning the Spirit to Samādhi* entirely governs the practice of the Dao. A single thought unites form and spirit, universally entering the utmost truth. It was received by the Highest Lord of the Dao, the August Jade Emperor. The supreme sages and perfected ones of the ten directions who have attained the immortal Dao all cultivate this method to broadly deliver the boundless. Its blessings are vast and universal, bestowing grace without exception. Its merit equals heaven and earth, its achievements shine like the sun and moon. Those who study without this method lack sufficient Dao-practice; how then can they achieve immortality? Yet what the Highest Lord values is not practiced in the world, and few possess its text. Should one obtain it, the immortal Dao is spontaneously achieved. All should present offerings of gold and silk as tokens of sincerity, approach a master to request transmission, for the Dao treasures its methods, and without sincerity, they cannot be practiced. To transmit lightly is to treat them as worthless; to cultivate emptily is to debase the Dao. Both incur the judgment of the wind-blade; be warned and take heed.\n\nThe Dao says: My *Scripture of the Wondrous Wheel of the Dao* comes from the immeasurable. Even kalpas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges cannot compare. The formation and dissolution of heaven and earth cannot be reckoned; all scriptures may perish, but my scripture will not. It turns with the cycles, its transformations ever more flourishing, delivering the boundless. Among scriptures, it is supreme, like the heavens opening to transformation. Without this scripture, the Dharma cannot spread. As all teachings unfold, this scripture is their origin. As all stars shine universally, this scripture is like the moon at its brightest, most luminous, illuminating the ten directions. As the three realms lie in dark obscurity, this scripture is like the rising sun, universally illuminating all heavens, none left unbrightened. As the myriad rivers flow, this scripture is like the abyss of Tanggu, the source of the great sea, to which all return. As Kunlun is lofty, this scripture is like the Jade Capital Mountain, encompassing all. This scripture is subtle and wondrous, enduring with heaven and earth. The primordial kings of the heavens, the lofty immortals and perfected ones—numberless beyond reckoning—all receive its command.\n\nThus it universally saves sentient beings. Whether they study or not, it instructs the three vehicles, broadly opening the Dharma-gates. Above, it orders the Three Luminaries; in the middle, it harmonizes yin and yang; below, it unfolds the myriad lives. All receive its sheltering shade, their seven generations delivered, their destitute souls turned and liberated. Birth and death, injury and ruin—none fail to be perfected. Its wheel turns without ceasing, like a boat ferrying people.\n\nThose who cultivate this scripture with unwavering devotion swiftly summon the dragon-chariot, ascending in broad daylight, dwelling in peace and sitting in uprightness. Those who contemplate this scripture see their households flourish, a hundred blessings like mountains. Their sons and daughters are talented and wise; wealth and honor grow daily. Kings, lords, and nobles who venerate this scripture attain limitless rank, producing generations of worthy and enlightened rulers. Women in seclusion who contemplate this scripture transform their bodies into men. Those in dark obscurity who contemplate this scripture immediately find release, clearly beholding the Eight Clarities. Those who lodge alone in fear who contemplate this scripture see demons and goblins vanish, as if ten thousand people shared the room. Those who encounter venomous beasts in desolate mountains who contemplate this scripture see the beasts retreat in hiding, unharmed. Those who cross great rivers and meet wind and waves who contemplate this scripture see rivers and seas grow still, dragons emerging to welcome them. Those who enter fire who contemplate this scripture remain unburned, the flames extinguishing themselves. Those who enter epidemics and the midst of ten thousand ghosts who contemplate this scripture see ghosts and toxins vanish, the sick restored to health. Those afflicted with dire illness who contemplate this scripture cast off calamity, forever preserving long life. Those in destitution and starvation who contemplate this scripture swallow qi and partake of its nourishment, becoming sated. Those imprisoned in dungeons and heavy fetters who contemplate this scripture see their bonds released, spared from punishment. Those seized by officials and clerks who contemplate this scripture see their shackles undone, the clerks rejoicing. Those with enemies who contemplate this scripture find their hearts gladdened and resentment dissolved, becoming closest kin. Those who meet bandits and blades who contemplate this scripture see the bandits retreat, blades kept at bay.\n\nThis scripture is the refuge of the three realms, delivering sentient beings from peril and distress, liberating them from the three evil destinies and the eight difficulties. In the midst of the five sufferings, none are endured. Its sheltering shade extends without limit; its blessings are beyond measure. Those who honor this scripture may be called the gate to the boundless.",
