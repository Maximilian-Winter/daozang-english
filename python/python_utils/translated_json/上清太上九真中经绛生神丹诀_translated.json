  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Nine Perfections: The Crimson Elixir of Divine Birth (Shangqing Taishang Jiuzhen Zhongjing Jiangsheng Shendan Jue)**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Nine Perfections: The Crimson Elixir of Divine Birth*\nAuthor unknown, approximately dating to the Northern and Southern Dynasties. One of the transmitted versions of the *Scripture of the Nine Perfections*. One scroll.\nSource of the base text: *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Nine Perfections: The Crimson Elixir of Divine Birth**\n\nFirst, close the eyes and inwardly observe. If any deficiencies are perceived, then burn incense, sit upright, close the eyes, clasp the hands firmly over the knees, and with concentrated essence, visualize the host of spirits while reciting the incantation as prescribed above.\n\nAt dawn and midday, perform the visualization while seated upright, ensuring no one witnesses the practice. In all cases, inwardly observe and visualize just before closing the eyes.\n\nOn the first day of the lunar month at midnight, after visualizing the spirits, further visualize within the two eyes a white *qi*, the size of a chicken’s egg, suspended before the face. Momentarily, it transforms into two luminous mirrors, each nine inches in diameter, which illuminate the twenty-four spirits residing within the body, clearly and penetratingly. After a long while, recite the following prayer:\n\n*\"O Radiant Treasure Mirrors, disperse and transform your forms,\nIllumine the primordial spirit, subdue the myriad demons.\nAscend to the Supreme Clarity, part the clouds and celestial veils,\nCommand a thousand spirits, seal the mountains and summon the rivers.\"*\n\nAfter reciting the incantation, perform this practice once every five days. This is what is meant by \"reexamining inner essence and gathering the five spirits.\" By consistently practicing this, calamities will not arise, and one will ascend to the rank of a lofty immortal.\n\nThe method of the \"Brushing Youth\" enables one to clearly perceive the Five Spirits of the Celestial Lord and the twenty-four spirits. Regularly, during the *jiazi*旬 (ten-day period), on the day of *gengwu*, at noon, take one *sheng* of pure water, add one *zhu* of true elixir, stir it counterclockwise twenty-one times, and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Mysterious flow of crimson essence, first illuminating the eightfold brightness,\nThe host of body spirits all assemble, manifesting their forms.\nPenetrating vision spans ten thousand *li*, reaching the nine numina at the center.\nThe Celestial Lord reflects the youth, refining my supreme essence.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, face east and wash the eyes fourteen times. Those who practice this regularly will attain penetrating vision of the myriad spirits. The incantation should be whispered softly, and the eyes should be washed with water facing the lunar station, always toward the east.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Perfected’s Summons of the Five Celestial Bodies in the Grotto Chamber and the Secret Method of the Hidden Register of the Flying Soul in the Six Harmonies**\n**The Jade Scripture and Precious Formula of the Supreme Pole Lord of the Southern Culmen**\n\nAt midnight, in perfect stillness, sit or lie as you wish. Compose the body, purify the heart, relax the breath, and harmonize the spirit. Close the eyes and inwardly visualize the Great White Star of the west, positioned above the two eyebrows, called the *Jade Pendants of the Purple Palace*. One *cun* above the eyebrows and one *cun* inward lies the *Jade Pendants of the Purple Palace*. On yang days, visualize the star above the left eyebrow; on yin days, above the right.\n\nNext, visualize the Chen Star of the north, located in the *Dark Palace of the Celestial Minister* at the center of the heavens. The *Dark Palace of the Celestial Minister* lies one *cun* directly upward from the nose, five *fen* below the hairline.\n\nNext, visualize the Wood Star of the east, located in the *Vermilion Terrace of the Grotto Pass*. The *Vermilion Terrace of the Grotto Pass* lies one *cun* behind the eyes and one *cun* inward. On yang days, visualize the star behind the left eye; on yin days, behind the right.\n\nNext, visualize the Sparkling Deluder Star of the south, located in the *Jade Gate and Flourishing Chamber*. The *Jade Gate and Flourishing Chamber* lies five *fen* inward from the inner canthi of the two eyes. On yang days, visualize the star at the inner canthus of the left eye; on yin days, at the inner canthus of the right.\n\nNext, visualize the Central Quelling Star, located in the *Golden Coffer, Yellow Chamber, and Long Valley*. The *Golden Coffer, Yellow Chamber, and Long Valley* lie at the center of the philtrum, two *fen* inward, with the star suspended as if strung above.\n\nAfter completing the visualization, ensure the stars occupy their positions, and you will perceive them emitting rays of light and releasing five-colored mists that penetrate the entire body, inside and out, as if the essence of the stars gently enters within.\n\nThen, knock the teeth five times, swallow saliva twenty-five times, and softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Supreme Purple Palace, within I perceive the Celestial Lord,\nThe Great One merges in unity, the gate of the Purple Chamber.\nWithin the gate, radiance shines—this is the Three Origins.\nThe Three Origins congeal essence, giving rise to the Five Spirits.\nPrecious luminaries unfold their splendor, emitting light that pierces the dawn.\nEssence transforms and accumulates, changing into an elder,\nWith a countenance of plain silk, clad in a green mantle and crimson skirt,\nA flowing bell at the right, tiger-patterned talisman at the left,\nHolding the Heavenly Net, scattering crimson and flying through the dawn,\nTreading upon the Floral Canopy, exhaling rays that refine the body.\nThe Three Luminaries guard and protect, enabling me to attain perfection,\nNurturing the hun-soul and restraining the po-soul, riding the whirlwind to ascend as an immortal.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, swallow saliva three more times and knock the teeth three times.\n\nThose who consistently practice this method for fifteen years will be welcomed by the True One of the Crimson Mound of the Southern Culmen, the Supreme Elder, in a chariot of green clouds; by the Master of the Plain Mound of the Western Culmen, the White Elder, in a carriage of yellow whirlwinds; by the Supreme Immortal Emperor of the Northern Culmen, the Dark Elder, in a dragon of dark radiance; by the Duke of Supporting Yang of the Eastern Culmen, the Green Elder, in a palanquin of azure canopies; and by the Supreme Dark Child of the Central Origin, the Central Elder, in a canopy of winding dawn. When the Five Elders unite, they ascend together to the Purple Void.\n\nPractice this without fail, and visualize with precision. Avoid treading upon filth, abstain from promiscuity, regularly burn incense, and frequently bathe. Those who violate these precepts will wither and decline; those who adhere will ascend as immortals.\n\nAfter completing the visualization, if you have a wish, append it to the end of the incantation. When visualizing the five stars together, position them two *cun* below the nape, one *cun* to each side, with the stars as round as pellets, illuminating the body and face.\n\nOn the first, fifteenth, seventh, ninth, thirteenth, seventeenth, twentieth, and twenty-fifth days of the lunar month, at cockcrow, visualize the images of the sun and moon within the *Soul Chamber of the Six Harmonies*. The *Soul Chamber of the Six Harmonies* lies in the small, elevated space above the outer corners of the two eyes. Press this point and knock the teeth; if you feel a movement beneath your fingers where the four meet, that is the location. One *cun* inward, nine *fen* square, it is called the *Mansion of the Soul Chamber of the Six Harmonies*.\n\nWith the sun on the left and the moon on the right, visualize their radiance illuminating the entire form, ensuring their semblance remains in place. Close the eyes and focus intently, allowing no lapse in concentration. Once complete, knock the teeth seven times, swallow saliva nine times, and softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Great luminous dawn,\nNinefold verdant ascent,\nSummoning rosy clouds, concealing brilliance,\nRefining the five forms,\nPalace chariot of the Six Harmonies,\nSeven spirits in harmony,\nLet me ascend as an immortal,\nMy soul ascend to the Upper Clarity.\"*\n\nUpon finishing the incantation, after practicing this for fifteen years, the Jade Emperor will dispatch the *Three Pure Ones’* chariot to welcome you.\n\nOne must raise a rooster that crows at dawn, ensuring it maintains regular timing. If practiced in concealment, the mutual radiance of the sun and moon will be lost.\n\nThe Southern Pole Lady received this method from the Most High Perfected, naming it *Dual Radiance Winging the Form in Hidden Visualization*. Only those with the bone structure of an immortal may hear and behold this scripture.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Reversion to the Hidden Dao: Inner Chapter for Removing Sins from the Register**\n\n**The Jade Perfected’s Hidden Primordial Inner Vision**\nOn the *ding* days of the *Six Ding* cycle, during the hour of *sheng qi*, when the Celestial Primordial unfolds and the *bao* binds ever more firmly, the seven *po* ascend to speak, and the three *hun* record transgressions. For those who have violated the seven generations of ancestors and accumulated sins in the Three Yin realms, there exists a method of dissolution to absolve transgressions and sins.\n\nThis practice is for those who seek immortality.\n\nRegularly, during the *jiazi* cycle, on the *dingmao* day, at midnight, sit upright on the bed in the sleeping chamber, facing north, hands clasped. Knock the teeth seven times, then visualize the seven stars shining brightly in the north. After a long while, softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"First Great Star,\nMysterious Pivot, Yang Brightness,\nCelestial Pivot, Spirit of the Hun,\nNine Lords of the Upper Prime.\"*\n\nAfter seven invocations, recite again:\n\n*\"May the yang sins and yin transgressions of my seven generations, down to my own self, all be dissolved. May all endeavors align with my wishes, and all affairs accord with my heart. May I ascend the Seven Primes, harmonize with Heaven, my name inscribed on the cinnabar tablets, my lifespan extended by billions.\"*\n\nOnce complete, visualize the seven stars of the Northern Dipper descending from the celestial center, flying into your mouth and directly into your heart. Visualize the starlight illuminating both within and without, focusing intently. This is called *dissolving the morning’s entangling net*, where inner and outer become empty and radiant, ascending the Dao.\n\nDuring the *jiaxu* cycle, on the *dingchou* day, at midnight, sit upright on the bed in the sleeping chamber, facing north, hands clasped. Knock the teeth seven times, then visualize the seven stars shining brightly in the north. After a long while, softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Second Prime Star,\nNorthern Terrace, Yin Essence,\nCelestial Whirl, Spirit of the Hun,\nNine Lords of the Upper Jade.\"*\n\nAfter seven invocations, recite again:\n\n*\"May the yang sins and yin transgressions of my seven generations, down to my own self, all be dissolved. May the Six Qi be full, the Four Spirits in emptiness. May I ascend the Seven Primes, my name inscribed in the Jade Book, ascend to the Purple Clarity, ride the void and harness the formless, moving freely and auspiciously, in harmony with Heaven.\"*\n\nOnce complete, visualize the seven stars of the Northern Dipper descending from the celestial center, flying into your mouth and directly into your lungs, illuminating both within and without, the five viscera distinctly visible. When the stars enter your mouth, your eyes should perceive their radiance scattering and filling your mouth, with a slight warmth—this is the sign of the stellar essence entering.\n\nFor all seven primes, visualize the Dao of the Nine Mornings. The bed and mat you sleep on must not be shared with others, nor should your clothing. If a man and woman share a mat to rest, their sins are recorded in the Northern Mystery’s register. If one violates defilement, calamity is inscribed in the earthly prison.\n\nHowever, if a master and disciple of the same qi share a resting place, it is not considered a violation.\n\nDuring the *jiashen* cycle, on the *dinghai* day, at midnight, sit upright on the bed in the sleeping chamber, facing north, hands clasped. Knock the teeth seven times, then visualize the seven stars shining brightly in the north. After a long while, softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Third True Star,\nNine Ultimates, Supreme Perfected,\nCelestial Mechanism, Essence of the Po,\nNine Lords of the Upper Simplicity.\"*\n\nAfter seven invocations, recite again:\n\n*\"May the death sins and transgressions of my seven generations of ancestors and parents, down to my own self—accumulated evils, hidden faults, and violations against the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water—all be dissolved. May my eyes see clearly, penetrating the hidden and unseen. May I ascend the Seven Lords, my name inscribed in the Upper Clarity, command the myriad spirits, ascend to the Jade Court, ride the radiance and harness the void, harmonizing with Heaven.\"*\n\nOnce complete, visualize the seven stars of the Northern Dipper descending from the celestial center, flying into your mouth and directly into your liver, their light illuminating the five viscera, both within and without. Finish by visualizing facing north, bowing twice, then swallowing saliva nine times. One may also rise and bow.\n\nDuring the *jiawu* cycle, on the *dingyou* day, at midnight, sit upright on the bed in the sleeping chamber, facing north, hands clasped. Knock the teeth seven times, then visualize the seven stars shining brightly in the north. After a long while, softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Fourth Pivot Star,\nRoot-Spreading Mystery,\nCelestial Balance, Essence of the Po,\nNine Lords of the Upper Void.\"*\n\nAfter seven invocations, recite again:\n\n*\"May the sins of my seven generations, down to my own self—lacking kindness and virtue, unfilial and unbenevolent, the countless yin evils—all be dissolved. May I ingest essence and absorb qi, daily advancing. May I ascend the Seven Primes, my name inscribed in the Great Mystery, listed before the Jade Emperor, soaring through the Nine Heavens, commanding spirits and guiding numina, renewing the brightness of the sun and moon.\"*\n\nOnce complete, visualize the seven stars of the Northern Dipper descending from the celestial center, flying into your mouth and directly into your spleen, their radiance illuminating and penetrating, reflecting upon the five viscera. Finish by swallowing saliva fourteen times.\n\nDuring the *jiachen* cycle, on the *dingwei* day, at midnight, sit upright on the bed in the sleeping chamber, facing north, hands clasped. Knock the teeth seven times, then visualize the seven stars shining brightly in the north. After a long while, softly recite the incantation:\n\nThe Fifth Star of the Net, Heavenly Balance and Cinnabar Prime, Jade Balance and Spirit-Soul Supreme Lord, Supreme Mystery and Nine August Lords. Invoke it seven times, then recite the incantation:\n\n*\"May I be cleansed of all defilements and transgressions from seven generations past down to my present self—inner and outer impurities, hidden and manifest faults numbering thousands of millions, recorded in the Dark Pass—all dissolved. May my body be filled with qi, brimming in the Yellow Court, settling in the stomach, inscribed upon the Great Simplicity. May I ride the radiance to the Purple Palace, attended on the right by Jade Maidens and on the left by Jade Lads, sun and moon shining as one, my rank as True King.\"*\n\nFinish by visualizing the seven stars of the Northern Dipper descending from the celestial center, flying into your mouth and directly into your stomach, their radiance illuminating and penetrating, reflecting upon the five viscera. Complete by swallowing saliva eighteen times.\n\nDuring the *jiayin* cycle, on the *dingsi* day, at midnight, sit upright on the bed in the sleeping chamber, facing north, hands clasped. Knock the teeth seven times, then visualize the seven stars shining brightly in the north. After a long while, softly recite the incantation:\n\nThe Sixth Star of the Cycle, Life’s Mechanism and Northern Pole, Opening Yang and Spirit-Soul, Supreme Cinnabar and Void Nine Lords. Invoke it seven times, then recite the incantation:\n\n*\"May I be absolved of all crimes and misdeeds from seven generations past down to my present self—treacherous evils, rebellious transgressions, and reckless offenses recorded in the Celestial Bureau—all dissolved. May the hundred ailments be healed, my body’s qi harmonized and upright, my name inscribed on the Terrace of Immortals, engraved upon the Golden Register of the Upper Clarity. May I command the ten thousand spirits and soar through the Nine Luminaries.\"*\n\nFinish by visualizing the seven stars of the Northern Dipper descending from the celestial center, flying into your mouth and directly into your kidneys, their radiance illuminating and penetrating, the five viscera distinctly revealed. Complete by swallowing saliva fourteen times. On yang days, visualize the stars entering the left kidney; on yin days, the right. The first day is yang, the second yin. This practice strictly forbids exposure to blood, filth, or foul odors, or the consumption of meat and pungent foods. Violations will extend to the seven ancestors above and the practitioner below, resulting in death as a lesser ghost, their name erased from the Celestial Gate.\n\nOn the evening of the lunar month’s end, the following dawn marking the new moon, before the cock’s crow, sit upright on the bed in the sleeping chamber, facing east, hands clasped. Knock the teeth seven times, then visualize the seven stars of the Northern Dipper shining brightly before your face. After a long while, softly recite the incantation:\n\nThe Seventh Star of the Barrier, Mysterious Yang and Heavenly Gate, Jade Radiance and Supreme Brilliance, Supreme Jade Emperor and Dao Lord. Invoke it seven times, then recite the incantation:\n\n*\"May I be cleansed of all hidden and obscured sins from seven generations past down to my present self—offenses incurring the Five Punishments, the spirits within my body numbering thousands of millions, recorded in the Ghost Bureau of the Northern Emperor—all dissolved. May my spirit be unimpeded in eight directions, seated in stillness or standing in vanishing, ears hearing the unheard, eyes emitting purple light. May I be inscribed upon the Jade Simplicity, peer into the forms of ghosts, my name recorded by the August Lord, my fate illumined by the Five Luminaries. May I soar through the Seven Primes and repose in the Purple Court.\"*\n\nFinish by visualizing the seven stars of the Northern Dipper descending from the celestial center, flying into your mouth and into your pupils, their light suffusing both eyes, revealing the inner and outer naturally, the five viscera distinctly visible. On yang days, visualize the stars entering the left pupil; on yin days, the right.\n\nOn *liujia* days, at the hour of midnight when generative qi arises, recline or sit upright on the bed in the sleeping chamber, head facing any direction. Clench the fists, hold the breath, and settle the spirit for a long while. Knock the teeth nine times, then visualize the nine stars of the Northern Dipper shining brilliantly above your crown. Let the light of the nine stars, with one star preceding the Dipper’s handle, radiate and intermingle. Then softly recite the incantation:\n\nThe Eighth August Star, Supreme Jade Emperor Spirit, Eight Effulgences Prime Lord, Nine Exalted Great Stars, Supreme Tenuity and Jade Emperor Spirit, Great Simplicity and Seven Dawns Prime Lord. Invoke it nine times, then recite the incantation:\n\n*\"May I be absolved of all sins—great and small—from nine generations of ancestors and parents down to my present self, from mountains to water sources, recorded in the Registers of the Dead, hidden evils, concealed treacheries, and deceits numbering in the millions, listed in the Ghost Emperor’s Fengdu, offenses under the statutes of death, inscribed in the Black Register of the Nine Primes and Supreme Ultimate True Persons of the Northern Heavens. I beseech the Nine Primes Supreme August Lord and Jade Mystery Lord to dissolve every transgression. May I soar through the Seven Paths, ascend to the Jade Clarity, wander the Great Primal, ride the radiance of dawn’s birth, feast in the Eight Simplicities of the North, rival the sun, jointly attend the August Consort, and command the ten thousand numina.\"*\n\nFinish by visualizing the seven stars of the Northern Dipper descending from the celestial center into the Purple Chamber of the Muddy Pellet, their light illuminating the Muddy Pellet and suffusing the entire body and five viscera, generating purple clouds of qi within and without, dense and luxuriant. Complete by swallowing saliva twenty-seven times.\n\nIf *liujia* days, the last day of the lunar month, or *liuding* days coincide too closely, adjust the timing accordingly without undue frequency. Each practice must adhere strictly to the true method.\n\nHere ends the Supreme Way of Returning to the Origin and Atoning for Sins. On the day the Supreme Lord concealed the Five Penetrations, they were sealed in the Jade Casket of the Five Peaks, the Hidden Way of Returning to the Origin concealed in the Palace of the Nine Dawns. Having cultivated the Five Penetrations, one must practice the Return to the Origin. The Five Penetrations are presented to the Emperor, the Return to the Origin initiated, and the Mysterious End revealed. Thus, those who cultivate the Five Penetrations and practice the Seven Primes’ Way of Return must abstain from consuming bloody or foul substances or encountering corpses and impurities. Violators will face the judgment of the Great Mystery.\n\nThe Five Penetrations mark the Supreme Lord’s auspicious assembly day. The Return to the Origin marks the Supreme Lord’s day of renewal. Without knowledge of the Five Penetrations, one cannot dissolve sins or eradicate evils. Without knowledge of the Hidden Way of Returning to the Origin, one’s name cannot be inscribed among the Upper Perfected.\n\nOn those designated days, one must reflect upon auspicious matters and first repent for the transgressions within one’s body—this is what is meant by \"dissolving the bonds of seven generations and shedding the form and name.\" Yet this must not be revealed to the immortals within the Nine Palaces.\n\nFor those who cultivate the affairs of the Cavernous Chamber and the Purple Chamber, or who meditate upon the Nine Mornings and Seven Primes, at the moment of first rising from sleep or first lying down, during breathwork, or after meals, one should softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Five Stars, Five Penetrations,\nSix Harmonies, Purple Chamber,\nReturn to the Origin, Hidden Way,\nVast and Radiant Seven Mornings.\nThe soul’s begetter is the Mysterious Father,\nwho transforms one into spirit;\nthe spirit’s begetter is the Mysterious Mother,\nwho shapes two into form.\nThe Duke’s Son governs my sinews and bones,\nWhite Prime refines my essence and qi.\nMay I attain long life and enduring vision,\nascend as a flying immortal through the Ten Heavens.\"*\n\nOnce the incantation is complete, ensure no ear hears its sound. This is the Supreme Lord’s Hidden Incantation, used to dispel perverse qi, summon spirit and essence, and prevent lifelong weariness or confusion.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Nine True Sovereign Lords on the Nine Yin’s Convergence and Myriad Transformations in the Hidden Heavens* states: The *Nine Yin Scripture of the Sovereign Lord* says: Those who wish to transform, divide their form, vanish into the eight directions, conceal their body and hide their radiance, enter emptiness to create obscurity, summon the myriad things, or command and restrain demonic chiefs must constantly purify themselves and cultivate the Sovereign Lord’s Nine Yin’s refined contemplation.\n\nWithin the first star is the Palace of the Supreme Lord, where resides the Sovereign Lord’s Inner Consort of Transformation, Concealment, and Return to the Origin, named **Taiyi Fada**, styled **Xing Zhengfu**. She wears a yellow brocade mantle, a vermilion-and-indigo flying skirt, and a trailing cloud coiffure.\n\nWithin the second star is the Palace of the Middle Origin, where resides the Sovereign Lord’s Inner Concubine of Embryonic Protection and Form Transformation, named **Taiyi Sanweng**, styled **Luozhu Ying**. She wears a blue-green brocade mantle, a green-feathered flying floral skirt, and a trailing cloud coiffure.\n\nWithin the third star is the Palace of the True Origin, where resides the Sovereign Lord’s Upper Prime Cinnabar Mother of the Six Vanishings and Seven Concealments, named **Taiyi Lingyi**, styled **Zhong Shuangzhao**. She wears a blue-green brocade mantle, an embroidered-feather flying floral skirt, and a trailing cloud coiffure.\n\nWithin the fourth star is the Palace of the Hidden Axis, where resides the Sovereign Lord’s Inner Consort of Concealed Radiance and Hidden Light, named **Taiyi Qilie**, styled **Heng Danpan**. She wears a purple brocade mantle, a yellow-flowered feathered flying skirt, and a trailing cloud coiffure.\n\nWithin the fifth star is the Palace of the Stalwart Spirit, where resides the Sovereign Lord’s Great Maiden of the Dipper’s Center, named **Taiyi Yushu**, styled **Chou Qiulan**. She wears a vermilion brocade mantle, a purple-and-indigo flying skirt, and a trailing cloud coiffure.\n\nWithin the sixth star is the Palace of the Recorded Luminance, where resides the Sovereign Lord’s Middle Maiden of the Dipper’s Center, who conceals her traces and disperses the masses, named **Taiyi Qijing**, styled **Baoding Ling**. She wears a vermilion brocade mantle, a blue-green embroidered flying skirt, and a trailing cloud coiffure.\n\nWithin the seventh star is the Palace of the Convergent Assembly, where resides the Sovereign Lord’s Lesser Maiden of the Dipper’s Center, who divides her shadow into myriad forms, named **Taiyi Yuhei**, styled **Tian Fanxiu**. She wears a cinnabar brocade mantle, a blue-green flowered feathered skirt, and a trailing cloud coiffure.\n\nWithin the eighth star is the Palace of the Sovereign’s Seat, where resides the Sovereign Lord’s Left Consort of the Dipper’s Center, the High August One who transforms the sun, moon, water, and fire, named **Taiyi Shiqizhu**, styled **Luomaohua**. She wears a purple brocade mantle, an embroidered-feather flying skirt, and a trailing cloud coiffure.\n\nWithin the ninth star is the Palace of the Supreme Veneration, where resides the Sovereign Lord’s Right Consort of the Dipper’s Center, the High August One who transforms metal, stone, mountains, and rivers, named **Taiyi Aitiao**, styled **Yunyu**. She wears a green brocade mantle, a kingfisher-feathered floral skirt, and a trailing cloud coiffure.\n\nWithin the nine star-palaces of the Dipper, the names of the Nine Yin Consorts of the Sovereign Lord are concealed. When reciting the incantation, invoke only their titles and names; do not mention their attire, mantles, or anything below the head.\n\nThose who master the Sovereign Lord’s Nine Yin will ascend to the Morning Upper Heavens, attaining the rank of Upper Perfected. At life’s end, they will not suffer the calamity of mourning, for the spirits of the Great Yin will guard and follow them, and the essences of the myriad spirits will bow in homage. They will disperse, transform, and merge, shaping heaven and earth.\n\nThese Nine Consorts of the Great Yin are the divine attendants of the Sovereign Lord’s Yin Palace. If one practices the Dao to untie knots, offers talismans to the celestial registers, pacifies the hun-soul and restrains the po-soul, transforms and generates the body’s spirits, guides the qi and extends the essence in pursuit of long life, yet remains ignorant of the names of the Sovereign Consorts and fails to practice the Nine Yin to achieve convergence, one will never attain immortality.\n\nOne inch inward from the space between the eyebrows lies the Hall of Luminance, a perfect square of one inch, where the Sovereign Lord’s Nine Yin Consorts perpetually reside.\n\nOn the even-numbered days of each month, at the hour of living qi during the evening, burn incense and enter a separate chamber. Sit or lie as you wish, close your eyes for a long while, and visualize the Sovereign Lord seated serenely within the Purple Chamber of the Great Ultimate. Then visualize the Five Spirits of Taiyi within the Six Harmonies, the Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper within your heart, and the Nine Yin Consorts within the Hall of Luminance. Next, visualize the Luminous Essence Lad of the Grand Tenuity standing before the Sovereign Lord, the lad holding the Five Talismans in his left hand and the Five Registers in his right. Then visualize your own form standing behind the lad, the Nine Yin Consorts emerging from the Hall of Luminance to stand in a row behind you, and the Five Spirits of Taiyi ascending from the Six Harmonies into the Purple Chamber of the Great Ultimate to stand in a row behind the Nine Yin Consorts.\n\nOnce all is complete, the Sovereign Lord and the host of spirits suddenly merge into a single transformation, assuming the form of a newborn infant. This is called the **Eternal Lad**, styled **Transforming Jade**, who holds the Nine Stars in his hand, wears the sun upon his head, and clasps the moon in his mouth. The lad bathes you in the radiance of the sun, moon, and Nine Stars, illuminating your entire body inside and out. You will feel your body suffused with crimson, as if engulfed in flames, with no distinction between inner and outer—all will be enveloped in a misty glow. This is the Sovereign Lord’s Taiyi Nine Yin, the Nine Yin’s convergence and transformation into myriad forms.\n\nAfter a long while, conclude by knocking the teeth twenty-four times, swallowing saliva nine times, and softly reciting the incantation:\n\nThe radiance of the Grotto-Heavens’ divine light revolves, illuminating the Purple Clarity. The Nine Mornings of Mysterious Yin conceal themselves in the depths of darkness, where the Lady of the Dipper’s midst and the Three Maidens disperse their forms. The divine consorts transform within, and the myriad things instantly take shape. Lightning flashes and thunder crashes, clouds and mists drift and scatter. Ninety transformations arise, giving birth to cinnabar and sprouting verdant hues. The Nine Ladies of Taiyi transmute their palaces into a state of primordial fusion. The Eternal Lad roams freely, dwelling in the hidden depths of darkness. Adorned in brocade robes and resplendent coverings, with skirts of flying purple feathers, he bears a concealed talisman at his left side and a tiger-patterned sash at his right. He commands fire and wears fire, cradling a crimson banner in his arms. The Eight Winds of demon-subduing rage at his flanks, while the Four Quarters are drawn by luminous clouds. Carefree within the celestial net, he dissolves the Seven Primes, obscures mountains and rivers, and overturns the Five Mornings. The sun and moon dim their brilliance, and the constellations lose their true forms. Dividing his form into a hundred, he transforms his body into a thousand. Within fire, he becomes fire; entering the forest, he becomes the forest. Dwelling in water, he becomes water; entering the mountain, he becomes the mountain. Whatever is sought arrives in an instant; whatever is summoned appears before him. Desires are swiftly fulfilled, and wishes manifest at a glance. A thousand kinds and a thousand things follow the heart’s every word. When the Sovereign Lord takes form, the Jade Morning of the Most High, the Peerless One of shared radiance, the Four and the White Prime—all these arise with the birth of heaven and earth to protect and nurture my body. Whatever the mouth utters transforms in accordance with the will. Jade lads present talismans, Jade Flowers hold towels, divine consorts offer incense, and the Four Perfected share the same chariot. Every matter and every thing conforms to my words.\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, visualize the Year Star, the Sparkling Deluder, the Grand White, the Chronographic Star, and the Quelling Star—altogether five stars—each arriving from their respective directions and entering your mouth. Let the radiant light of the Five Stars shine upward to illuminate the Purple Chamber of the Muddy Pellet, shine inward to illuminate the Five Viscera, and shine downward to illuminate the Yin Chamber, so that the entire body becomes thoroughly permeated.\n\nThis is the Sovereign Lord’s use of illumination to reverse the Dao of the Nine Yins.\n\nAfter a long while of visualization, knock the teeth five times, swallow saliva five times, and softly recite the incantation:\n\nThe Five Celestial Bodies array themselves in brilliance across the Five Directions.\nThe Water Star averts calamity; the Wood Star brings prosperity.\nThe Sparkling Deluder dissolves misfortune; the Grand White repels weapons.\nThe Quelling Star secures the Four Quarters, granting me favorable divination.\nThe Sovereign Lord employs transformation to harmonize and reverse the Nine Spirits.\nThe White Blossom of Great Yin, the palace chambers of the Nine Stars,\ninscribe my jade tablet and record my name in the Emperor’s chamber.\nRiding the whirlwind and fanning the luminous clouds, I soar through the Great Void,\nentering and exiting the unseen, roaming the Ten Directions of darkness.\nFive-colored clouds cover me, summoning spirits and seizing the winds,\ncommanding the myriad spirits to serve and protect the Transcendent Lords above.\n\nWhen finished, this is the hidden scripture of the Sovereign Lord’s Nine Yins, the inner practice of the Nine Perfected.\n\nThe ranks of the Five Spirits, the pathways of the Three Primes:\nThe Central Yellow Venerable Lord, the Southern Purple Essence Lord, the Eastern Azure Lad Lord, the Northern Most High Lord, and the Western Primordial Simplicity Lord—all reverse the Nine Yins to disperse their forms, deploy the Five Stars to extinguish their radiance, and blend and transform the myriad things, accomplishing all matters instantly. Those who long preserve and contemplate this become Perfected Ones above.\n\nIf the practitioner constantly cultivates this, their transformations will be boundless, and their body will generate water and fire.\n\nHere ends the Dao of the Sovereign Lord’s Nine Yins.\n\n**The Vermilion Writ of the Most High’s Jade Morning and the Rushing Solar Orb**\n**The Yellow Writ of the Knotted Radiance and the Rushing Lunar Orb**\n\nThis Dao of the rushing sun and moon is treasured and kept secret by the Four Perfected Ones of the Most High’s Supreme Clarity and the Nine Sovereigns of the Great Ultimate, as well as the Jade Writs of the Mysterious Void Jade Lord. Unless one’s name is inscribed in the Golden Pavilion and recorded in the Eastern Florescence, one cannot hear or see the titles of these two chapters.\n\nThose who practice this must first purify themselves with a hundred days of abstention, cutting off all worldly affairs. With prolonged cultivation, the sun and moon of the upper realms will grant fifty jade lads and fifty jade maidens each.\n\nThe *Vermilion Writ of the Most High’s Jade Morning* and the *Yellow Writ of the Knotted Radiance* are the sacred and secret scriptures of the Jade Sovereign Lord of the Most High. They are stored in the chambers of the Nine Heavens, upon the Cinnabar-Jasper Terrace. Unless one is diligent in heart and fond of the true, with the celestial bone-record of a Flying Mystery Heavenly Transcendent, one cannot see or hear of them. Even hearing their titles must not be spoken of carelessly, for to do so offends the Three Officials, and Heaven and Earth will not forgive.\n\nInitially, the transmission was permitted to one person every three hundred years, then again after seven hundred years. If the spirits and darkness indicate one is fit to receive it, it may be transmitted. The method of transmission is passed from master to disciple in accordance with the exalted statutes of the Mysterious. If transmitted to an unworthy person who does not follow the regulations, it is considered a leak of celestial patterns. Those who violate the oath through negligence or disrespect will become lowly ghosts after death, and their seven generations of ancestors will suffer the punishment of wind and fire. Unless of the same vital breath, one should rather keep silent.\n\nOn the Western Mystery Mountain’s Terrace of Radiance, these two scriptures are inscribed on jade tablets in golden characters. In the Clear Void Heaven of Wangwu, they exist but are not complete. Only in the Highest Terrace of the Great Mystery Palace and the northern chamber of the Penglai Prefecture’s Golden Pillar and Jade Wall are the inscriptions fully preserved. The Transcendents of the Central Palace and the various palaces of the Great Clarity do not even know what these texts are.\n\nOn the northern cavern of Mount Emei’s stone chamber doorframe, an inscription in stone reads:\n*\"The Jade Morning draws the sun’s essence; the Knotted Radiance summons the moon’s spirit.\nAttaining the Dao, one dwells in the Upper Palace, becoming a Perfected Sovereign Lord.\"*\nThese twenty characters are seen by lesser transcendents, who do not comprehend their meaning. Among such transcendents, many have never even seen the titles of these texts.\n\nThe Golden Liquid Divine Elixir is but a minor art, insufficient for ascending to the Upper Clarity. Those who wish to practice this Dao need not distinguish between foolishness and wisdom—only that such texts do not exist in the mortal realm. The true methods of the Mysterious Law are transmitted only after oaths are sworn. Those who obtain and practice them attain the rank of Upper Perfected, riding the Eight Radiance Jade Wheels to roam the Nine Mornings, journeying to the Primordial Purity Palace to behold the Supreme Unity Emperor Lord, together paying homage at the Origin Dawn. Thus, the secret words say: *\"Only when you obtain the Jade Morning and Knotted Radiance do you become a Perfected of the Upper Clarity. Without cultivating the Supreme Dao, you cannot meet the Three Origin Lords.\"*\n\nThe Supreme’s Jade Morning Sun’s Five Emperors’ taboo names, courtesy names, and attire:\n- **Sun’s Green Emperor**: Taboo name *Yuánchángwú*, courtesy name *Zhàolóngtāo*, clad in a green jade brocade mantle, azure floral flying-feather skirt, and a *Cuìróng Fúchén* crown.\n- **Sun’s Red Emperor**: Taboo name *Dānlíngzhì*, courtesy name *Lǜhóngyìng*, clad in a descending-jade brocade mantle, vermilion floral flying-feather skirt, and a *Dān Fúlíngmíng* crown.\n- **Sun’s White Emperor**: Taboo name *Hàoyùjiāng*, courtesy name *Huíjīnxiá*, clad in a plain jade brocade mantle, white feather flying-floral skirt, and a *Hàolíng Fúgài* crown.\n- **Sun’s Black Emperor**: Taboo name *Chéngqīntíng*, courtesy name *Xuánlǜyán*, clad in a dark jade brocade mantle, black feather flying-floral skirt, and a *Xuánshān Fúróng* crown.\n- **Sun’s Yellow Emperor**: Taboo name *Shòuyìfù*, courtesy name *Biāohuīxiàng*, clad in a yellow jade brocade mantle, yellow feather flying-floral skirt, and a *Fúlíng Zǐ* crown.\n\nThe above are the taboo names, courtesy names, and attire of the Five Emperors within the sun.\n\nTo practice the sun-chasing Dao, one must recite and recognize their names, visualizing the emperors’ attire surrounding oneself in all directions.\n\nThe Moon’s Lady, spirit of the lunar essence, is named *Àixiāo Táibiāo*. The moon’s soul pairs with the Five Emperors, and one must also recite her name. Knowing the moon’s soul name ensures a life free from calamity, untouched by myriad harms.\n\nThe Supreme conceals the taboo names and courtesy names of the sun and moon emperors and their consorts within the Primordial Purity Moon Palace. Those who possess this knowledge become divine immortals.\n\nThe Supreme’s Knotted Radiance Moon’s Five Empresses’ taboo names, courtesy names, and attire:\n- **Moon’s Green Empress**: Taboo name *Éyǐnzhū*, courtesy name *Fēnyàn Yīng*, clad in a green floral jade brocade mantle and a kingfisher-green dragon-phoenix flying-feather skirt.\n- **Moon’s Red Empress**: Taboo name *Yìyìliáo*, courtesy name *Wǎnyánxū*, clad in a cinnabar-bud jade brocade mantle and a vermilion floral phoenix-falling flying-feather skirt.\n- **Moon’s White Empress**: Taboo name *Língsùlán*, courtesy name *Yùliánhuá*, clad in a white jade four-dragon brocade mantle and a plain feather luan-pattern flying-floral skirt.\n- **Moon’s Black Empress**: Taboo name *Jiéliánqiáo*, courtesy name *Tíngshǔjīn*, clad in a dark jade nine-cloud brocade mantle and a black feather dragon-pattern flying-floral skirt.\n- **Moon’s Yellow Empress**: Taboo name *Qīngyíngjīn*, courtesy name *Xuándìngróng*, clad in a yellow cloud-mountain brocade mantle and a green feather phoenix-floral embroidered skirt.\n\nAll five empresses wear their hair in three-angled cloud buns, with the rest cascading to their waists.\n\nThe above are the taboo names, courtesy names, and attire of the Five Empresses within the moon.\n\nTo practice the moon-chasing Dao, one must recite and recognize their names, visualizing the empresses’ attire surrounding oneself in all directions.\n\nThe sun’s soul, spirit of the solar essence, is named *Zhūjǐng Chìtóng*. The sun’s soul pairs with the moon’s Five Empresses, and one must also recite his name. Knowing the sun’s soul name ensures a life free from illness, untouched by myriad misfortunes. The Supreme conceals the names of the sun and moon souls within the Purple Void King’s Palace. Those who know them command spirits and wield numinous power.\n\nThose who cultivate the sun- and moon-chasing Dao may practice as they see fit; it is not necessary to perform all rites. To attain a secluded chamber, one need only observe where the sun and moon first radiate. Those who do not sever worldly affairs or avoid external distractions cannot practice this Dao.\n\nAt midnight, one should always burn incense, visualize the Five Empresses’ names, and silently recite the incantation: *\"May I unite with the Emperor Lords and the Five Spirits of the Supreme Unity, merging our radiance as one.\"* After twenty-four years of such practice, one may ascend to heaven in broad daylight, even without performing the chasing and visualization rites. Constantly visualize them at one’s left and right, reciting the old incantations silently, never aloud.\n\nTo practice the Jade Morning sun-chasing Dao, gaze at the sunrise each dawn. If the sun is not visible, remain in a quiet chamber, first closing the eyes and holding the breath for ten cycles, then swallowing the sun’s radiance ten times. Visualize the auroral light entering the mouth and swallow it. Afterward, softly call the Five Emperors’ names and the moon’s soul name three times in total.\n\nNext, visualize the Green Emperor Lord emerging from the sunlight to stand at one’s left; then the Red Emperor Lord, from the sunlight to one’s right; then the White Emperor Lord, from the sunlight to one’s back; then the Black Emperor Lord, from the sunlight to one’s left hand; and finally the Yellow Emperor Lord, from the sunlight to one’s right hand. When all Five Emperors have arrived, visualize their attire in vivid detail.\n\nThen, knock the teeth five times, swallow saliva nine times, and softly recite the incantation:\n*\"Crimson furnace, cinnabar radiance, round blossom of ninefold brightness,\nSupreme splendor dawns, resplendent with vermilion essence.\nFive Emperors initiate the auroras, illuminating the myriad lives of the cavernous void.\nBehold the descent of the Upper Perfected, vast and boundless as emptiness.\nCirculate the qi, refine the hues, flowing through the five forms.\nMay my spirit transform, my six palaces flourish and fill,\nUniting with the Emperor Lords, the Supreme Unity’s peerless heroes.\nRiding the crimson clouds, the yang mirror’s nine chariots,\nAscend to the sun’s heart, merging with the emperors’ numen.\nMay my lifespan equal heaven and earth, the two dawns converging.\"*\n\nAfter the incantation, knock the teeth three more times, swallow saliva three times, and softly recite:\n*\"Moon soul, spirit essence, Àixiāo Táibiāo,\nGrant me access to the sun’s cavernous heaven,\nTo the eastern Mount Meng’s long hills,\nWhere I receive the divine writ of the wielding spirit,\nBear the talisman of the nine realms,\nFeast on the sun’s azure essence,\nDrink the cloud-jade’s bloom,\nRevel in the city of the eight poles,\nAscend the Terrace of Luminous Perfection,\nSit in the Hall of Rare Forests,\nChant the Jade Dawn’s verses.\"*\n\nUpon completion, once more visualize the yang mirror’s crimson-cloud chariot, harnessed to nine red dragons, arriving before you from the sunlight. Then, together with the Five Emperors, mount it and hasten toward the sun. Forget your form for a long while, then swallow saliva fourteen times. When finished, open your eyes and concentrate intensely, visualizing until faint outlines appear. Those who persist in this practice will surely ride the radiance to the sun—thus concludes the Way of Yūyí.\n\nTo perform the Way of Jiélín and hasten to the moon, gaze toward the moon each evening. When the moon is absent, sit in a quiet chamber, close your eyes, hold your breath for nine breaths, then swallow moonlight nine times. Visualize the moonlight entering your mouth and swallow it. Recite the names of the Five Vast Ladies and the sun’s soul, three times in all. Next, visualize the Azure Emperor’s Lady descending from the moonlight, with attendants arrayed to left and right, following the same method as the visualization of the Five Emperors within the sun. When all have arrived, visualize their robes and colors in vivid detail. Then knock the teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and softly recite:\n\n*\"Essence of yellow radiance, primordial yin’s inner pattern,\nIllumining the Great Mystery, opening the myriad realms,\nDispersing the misty cold winds, the Seven Dawns suspend jade,\nThe threefold yin revolves, heaven and earth exhale light,\nPurple luminaries drift and descend, floating blossoms fill the nine voids,\nRound brightness bestows hues, the six qi transform and flow,\nThe Five Emperor Ladies tread clouds and grasp winds,\nSpirit veils of dense silk, jade pendants and earrings,\nFeather skirts brush the clouds, transcendent fans stir the east,\nCanopy trees spread their shade, jade branches flourish like lotus,\nCloud toads refine and polish, nurturing the Tree King,\nIts roots stretch ten thousand leagues, casting shade over my body,\nSoul harmonized, spirit transformed, the six mysteries brim with numen.\nThose who return revert to infancy, jade radiance restores youth,\nThe Emperor Lords merge and transform, together with the radiant peach of health,\nTimely riding the flowing bells, ten dragons of flying clouds,\nAscend to the Luminous Palace, attaining the rank of Guardian Sovereign,\nLifespan conjoined with the two images, heaven and earth without end.\"*\n\nWhen finished, knock the teeth seven more times, swallow saliva seven times, and softly recite:\n\n*\"Sun soul, spirit essence, Pearl Radiance Red Youth,\nGrant me passage west to the Six Peaks’ gate,\nEntering the Jade Palace of Harmonious Dawn,\nThe Eight Chords’ White Hills, the Eight Radiance’ upper chambers,\nTo bear the talisman of Ten Brightnesses,\nWear the writ of the shooting star’s night glow,\nSit in the Hall of Supreme Harmony,\nAscend the Terrace of Seven Numinous Ones,\nDrink the moon’s blossom cream,\nFeast on the yellow jade’s purple nectar,\nChant the verses of the Lofty Ones,\nRecite the Jade Dawn’s true hymns.\"*\n\nUpon completion, visualize the flowing-bell flying-cloud chariot, harnessed to ten yellow dragons, arriving before you from the moonlight. Then, together with the Five Ladies, mount it and hasten toward the moon. Forget your form for a long while, then swallow saliva thirty times. When finished, open your eyes and concentrate intensely, visualizing until faint outlines appear. Those who persist in this practice will surely ride the radiance to the moon—thus concludes the Way of Jiélín.\n\nIf one has already attained the Dao and perfected the refinement of essence and visualization, practicing this for two years will yield faint outlines; in three years, the form will appear; in five years, one may hasten to the sun and moon. For those who are not yet immortals but begin this practice in earnest, progress will not be swift. Yet with prolonged cultivation, one may ascend to the Two Radiant Ones and become a Perfected of Highest Clarity. This transmission is bestowed upon one person every seven hundred years.\n\nHere ends the *Highest Clarity Supreme Nine Perfected Central Scripture: Crimson Life-Spirit Elixir Formula*.",

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Nine Perfections: The Crimson Elixir of Divine Birth (Shangqing Taishang Jiuzhen Zhongjing Jiangsheng Shendan Jue)**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Nine Perfections: The Crimson Elixir of Divine Birth*\nAuthor unknown, approximately dating to the Northern and Southern Dynasties. One of the transmitted versions of the *Scripture of the Nine Perfections*. One scroll.\nSource of the base text: *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Nine Perfections: The Crimson Elixir of Divine Birth**\n\nFirst, close the eyes and inwardly observe. If any deficiencies are perceived, then burn incense, sit upright, close the eyes, clasp the hands firmly over the knees, and with concentrated essence, visualize the host of spirits while reciting the incantation as prescribed above.\n\nAt dawn and midday, perform the visualization while seated upright, ensuring no one witnesses the practice. In all cases, inwardly observe and visualize just before closing the eyes.\n\nOn the first day of the lunar month at midnight, after visualizing the spirits, further visualize within the two eyes a white *qi*, the size of a chicken’s egg, suspended before the face. Momentarily, it transforms into two luminous mirrors, each nine inches in diameter, which illuminate the twenty-four spirits residing within the body, clearly and penetratingly. After a long while, recite the following prayer:\n\n*\"O Radiant Treasure Mirrors, disperse and transform your forms,\nIllumine the primordial spirit, subdue the myriad demons.\nAscend to the Supreme Clarity, part the clouds and celestial veils,\nCommand a thousand spirits, seal the mountains and summon the rivers.\"*\n\nAfter reciting the incantation, perform this practice once every five days. This is what is meant by \"reexamining inner essence and gathering the five spirits.\" By consistently practicing this, calamities will not arise, and one will ascend to the rank of a lofty immortal.\n\nThe method of the \"Brushing Youth\" enables one to clearly perceive the Five Spirits of the Celestial Lord and the twenty-four spirits. Regularly, during the *jiazi*旬 (ten-day period), on the day of *gengwu*, at noon, take one *sheng* of pure water, add one *zhu* of true elixir, stir it counterclockwise twenty-one times, and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Mysterious flow of crimson essence, first illuminating the eightfold brightness,\nThe host of body spirits all assemble, manifesting their forms.\nPenetrating vision spans ten thousand *li*, reaching the nine numina at the center.\nThe Celestial Lord reflects the youth, refining my supreme essence.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, face east and wash the eyes fourteen times. Those who practice this regularly will attain penetrating vision of the myriad spirits. The incantation should be whispered softly, and the eyes should be washed with water facing the lunar station, always toward the east.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Perfected’s Summons of the Five Celestial Bodies in the Grotto Chamber and the Secret Method of the Hidden Register of the Flying Soul in the Six Harmonies**\n**The Jade Scripture and Precious Formula of the Supreme Pole Lord of the Southern Culmen**\n\nAt midnight, in perfect stillness, sit or lie as you wish. Compose the body, purify the heart, relax the breath, and harmonize the spirit. Close the eyes and inwardly visualize the Great White Star of the west, positioned above the two eyebrows, called the *Jade Pendants of the Purple Palace*. One *cun* above the eyebrows and one *cun* inward lies the *Jade Pendants of the Purple Palace*. On yang days, visualize the star above the left eyebrow; on yin days, above the right.\n\nNext, visualize the Chen Star of the north, located in the *Dark Palace of the Celestial Minister* at the center of the heavens. The *Dark Palace of the Celestial Minister* lies one *cun* directly upward from the nose, five *fen* below the hairline.\n\nNext, visualize the Wood Star of the east, located in the *Vermilion Terrace of the Grotto Pass*. The *Vermilion Terrace of the Grotto Pass* lies one *cun* behind the eyes and one *cun* inward. On yang days, visualize the star behind the left eye; on yin days, behind the right.\n\nNext, visualize the Sparkling Deluder Star of the south, located in the *Jade Gate and Flourishing Chamber*. The *Jade Gate and Flourishing Chamber* lies five *fen* inward from the inner canthi of the two eyes. On yang days, visualize the star at the inner canthus of the left eye; on yin days, at the inner canthus of the right.\n\nNext, visualize the Central Quelling Star, located in the *Golden Coffer, Yellow Chamber, and Long Valley*. The *Golden Coffer, Yellow Chamber, and Long Valley* lie at the center of the philtrum, two *fen* inward, with the star suspended as if strung above.\n\nAfter completing the visualization, ensure the stars occupy their positions, and you will perceive them emitting rays of light and releasing five-colored mists that penetrate the entire body, inside and out, as if the essence of the stars gently enters within.\n\nThen, knock the teeth five times, swallow saliva twenty-five times, and softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Supreme Purple Palace, within I perceive the Celestial Lord,\nThe Great One merges in unity, the gate of the Purple Chamber.\nWithin the gate, radiance shines—this is the Three Origins.\nThe Three Origins congeal essence, giving rise to the Five Spirits.\nPrecious luminaries unfold their splendor, emitting light that pierces the dawn.\nEssence transforms and accumulates, changing into an elder,\nWith a countenance of plain silk, clad in a green mantle and crimson skirt,\nA flowing bell at the right, tiger-patterned talisman at the left,\nHolding the Heavenly Net, scattering crimson and flying through the dawn,\nTreading upon the Floral Canopy, exhaling rays that refine the body.\nThe Three Luminaries guard and protect, enabling me to attain perfection,\nNurturing the hun-soul and restraining the po-soul, riding the whirlwind to ascend as an immortal.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, swallow saliva three more times and knock the teeth three times.\n\nThose who consistently practice this method for fifteen years will be welcomed by the True One of the Crimson Mound of the Southern Culmen, the Supreme Elder, in a chariot of green clouds; by the Master of the Plain Mound of the Western Culmen, the White Elder, in a carriage of yellow whirlwinds; by the Supreme Immortal Emperor of the Northern Culmen, the Dark Elder, in a dragon of dark radiance; by the Duke of Supporting Yang of the Eastern Culmen, the Green Elder, in a palanquin of azure canopies; and by the Supreme Dark Child of the Central Origin, the Central Elder, in a canopy of winding dawn. When the Five Elders unite, they ascend together to the Purple Void.\n\nPractice this without fail, and visualize with precision. Avoid treading upon filth, abstain from promiscuity, regularly burn incense, and frequently bathe. Those who violate these precepts will wither and decline; those who adhere will ascend as immortals.\n\nAfter completing the visualization, if you have a wish, append it to the end of the incantation. When visualizing the five stars together, position them two *cun* below the nape, one *cun* to each side, with the stars as round as pellets, illuminating the body and face.\n\nOn the first, fifteenth, seventh, ninth, thirteenth, seventeenth, twentieth, and twenty-fifth days of the lunar month, at cockcrow, visualize the images of the sun and moon within the *Soul Chamber of the Six Harmonies*. The *Soul Chamber of the Six Harmonies* lies in the small, elevated space above the outer corners of the two eyes. Press this point and knock the teeth; if you feel a movement beneath your fingers where the four meet, that is the location. One *cun* inward, nine *fen* square, it is called the *Mansion of the Soul Chamber of the Six Harmonies*.",

She wears a blue-green brocade mantle, a green-feathered flying floral skirt, and a trailing cloud coiffure.\n\nWithin the third star is the Palace of the True Origin, where resides the Sovereign Lord’s Upper Prime Cinnabar Mother of the Six Vanishings and Seven Concealments, named **Taiyi Lingyi**, styled **Zhong Shuangzhao**. She wears a blue-green brocade mantle, an embroidered-feather flying floral skirt, and a trailing cloud coiffure.\n\nWithin the fourth star is the Palace of the Hidden Axis, where resides the Sovereign Lord’s Inner Consort of Concealed Radiance and Hidden Light, named **Taiyi Qilie**, styled **Heng Danpan**. She wears a purple brocade mantle, a yellow-flowered feathered flying skirt, and a trailing cloud coiffure.\n\nWithin the fifth star is the Palace of the Stalwart Spirit, where resides the Sovereign Lord’s Great Maiden of the Dipper’s Center, named **Taiyi Yushu**, styled **Chou Qiulan**. She wears a vermilion brocade mantle, a purple-and-indigo flying skirt, and a trailing cloud coiffure.\n\nWithin the sixth star is the Palace of the Recorded Luminance, where resides the Sovereign Lord’s Middle Maiden of the Dipper’s Center, who conceals her traces and disperses the masses, named **Taiyi Qijing**, styled **Baoding Ling**. She wears a vermilion brocade mantle, a blue-green embroidered flying skirt, and a trailing cloud coiffure.\n\nWithin the seventh star is the Palace of the Convergent Assembly, where resides the Sovereign Lord’s Lesser Maiden of the Dipper’s Center, who divides her shadow into myriad forms, named **Taiyi Yuhei**, styled **Tian Fanxiu**. She wears a cinnabar brocade mantle, a blue-green flowered feathered skirt, and a trailing cloud coiffure.\n\nWithin the eighth star is the Palace of the Sovereign’s Seat, where resides the Sovereign Lord’s Left Consort of the Dipper’s Center, the High August One who transforms the sun, moon, water, and fire, named **Taiyi Shiqizhu**, styled **Luomaohua**. She wears a purple brocade mantle, an embroidered-feather flying skirt, and a trailing cloud coiffure.\n\nWithin the ninth star is the Palace of the Supreme Veneration, where resides the Sovereign Lord’s Right Consort of the Dipper’s Center, the High August One who transforms metal, stone, mountains, and rivers, named **Taiyi Aitiao**, styled **Yunyu**. She wears a green brocade mantle, a kingfisher-feathered floral skirt, and a trailing cloud coiffure.\n\nWithin the nine star-palaces of the Dipper, the names of the Nine Yin Consorts of the Sovereign Lord are concealed. When reciting the incantation, invoke only their titles and names; do not mention their attire, mantles, or anything below the head.\n\nThose who master the Sovereign Lord’s Nine Yin will ascend to the Morning Upper Heavens, attaining the rank of Upper Perfected. At life’s end, they will not suffer the calamity of mourning, for the spirits of the Great Yin will guard and follow them, and the essences of the myriad spirits will bow in homage. They will disperse, transform, and merge, shaping heaven and earth.\n\nThese Nine Consorts of the Great Yin are the divine attendants of the Sovereign Lord’s Yin Palace. If one practices the Dao to untie knots, offers talismans to the celestial registers, pacifies the hun-soul and restrains the po-soul, transforms and generates the body’s spirits, guides the qi and extends the essence in pursuit of long life, yet remains ignorant of the names of the Sovereign Consorts and fails to practice the Nine Yin to achieve convergence, one will never attain immortality.\n\nOne inch inward from the space between the eyebrows lies the Hall of Luminance, a perfect square of one inch, where the Sovereign Lord’s Nine Yin Consorts perpetually reside.\n\nOn the even-numbered days of each month, at the hour of living qi during the evening, burn incense and enter a separate chamber. Sit or lie as you wish, close your eyes for a long while, and visualize the Sovereign Lord seated serenely within the Purple Chamber of the Great Ultimate. Then visualize the Five Spirits of Taiyi within the Six Harmonies, the Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper within your heart, and the Nine Yin Consorts within the Hall of Luminance. Next, visualize the Luminous Essence Lad of the Grand Tenuity standing before the Sovereign Lord, the lad holding the Five Talismans in his left hand and the Five Registers in his right. Then visualize your own form standing behind the lad, the Nine Yin Consorts emerging from the Hall of Luminance to stand in a row behind you, and the Five Spirits of Taiyi ascending from the Six Harmonies into the Purple Chamber of the Great Ultimate to stand in a row behind the Nine Yin Consorts.\n\nOnce all is complete, the Sovereign Lord and the host of spirits suddenly merge into a single transformation, assuming the form of a newborn infant. This is called the **Eternal Lad**, styled **Transforming Jade**, who holds the Nine Stars in his hand, wears the sun upon his head, and clasps the moon in his mouth. The lad bathes you in the radiance of the sun, moon, and Nine Stars, illuminating your entire body inside and out. You will feel your body suffused with crimson, as if engulfed in flames, with no distinction between inner and outer—all will be enveloped in a misty glow. This is the Sovereign Lord’s Taiyi Nine Yin, the Nine Yin’s convergence and transformation into myriad forms.\n\nAfter a long while, conclude by knocking the teeth twenty-four times, swallowing saliva nine times, and softly reciting the incantation:",

      "translated_text": "The radiance of the Grotto-Heavens’ divine light revolves, illuminating the Purple Clarity. The Nine Mornings of Mysterious Yin conceal themselves in the depths of darkness, where the Lady of the Dipper’s midst and the Three Maidens disperse their forms. The divine consorts transform within, and the myriad things instantly take shape. Lightning flashes and thunder crashes, clouds and mists drift and scatter. Ninety transformations arise, giving birth to cinnabar and sprouting verdant hues. The Nine Ladies of Taiyi transmute their palaces into a state of primordial fusion. The Eternal Lad roams freely, dwelling in the hidden depths of darkness. Adorned in brocade robes and resplendent coverings, with skirts of flying purple feathers, he bears a concealed talisman at his left side and a tiger-patterned sash at his right. He commands fire and wears fire, cradling a crimson banner in his arms. The Eight Winds of demon-subduing rage at his flanks, while the Four Quarters are drawn by luminous clouds. Carefree within the celestial net, he dissolves the Seven Primes, obscures mountains and rivers, and overturns the Five Mornings. The sun and moon dim their brilliance, and the constellations lose their true forms. Dividing his form into a hundred, he transforms his body into a thousand. Within fire, he becomes fire; entering the forest, he becomes the forest. Dwelling in water, he becomes water; entering the mountain, he becomes the mountain. Whatever is sought arrives in an instant; whatever is summoned appears before him. Desires are swiftly fulfilled, and wishes manifest at a glance. A thousand kinds and a thousand things follow the heart’s every word. When the Sovereign Lord takes form, the Jade Morning of the Most High, the Peerless One of shared radiance, the Four and the White Prime—all these arise with the birth of heaven and earth to protect and nurture my body. Whatever the mouth utters transforms in accordance with the will. Jade lads present talismans, Jade Flowers hold towels, divine consorts offer incense, and the Four Perfected share the same chariot. Every matter and every thing conforms to my words.\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, visualize the Year Star, the Sparkling Deluder, the Grand White, the Chronographic Star, and the Quelling Star—altogether five stars—each arriving from their respective directions and entering your mouth. Let the radiant light of the Five Stars shine upward to illuminate the Purple Chamber of the Muddy Pellet, shine inward to illuminate the Five Viscera, and shine downward to illuminate the Yin Chamber, so that the entire body becomes thoroughly permeated.\n\nThis is the Sovereign Lord’s use of illumination to reverse the Dao of the Nine Yins.\n\nAfter a long while of visualization, knock the teeth five times, swallow saliva five times, and softly recite the incantation:\n\nThe Five Celestial Bodies array themselves in brilliance across the Five Directions.\nThe Water Star averts calamity; the Wood Star brings prosperity.\nThe Sparkling Deluder dissolves misfortune; the Grand White repels weapons.\nThe Quelling Star secures the Four Quarters, granting me favorable divination.\nThe Sovereign Lord employs transformation to harmonize and reverse the Nine Spirits.\nThe White Blossom of Great Yin, the palace chambers of the Nine Stars,\ninscribe my jade tablet and record my name in the Emperor’s chamber.\nRiding the whirlwind and fanning the luminous clouds, I soar through the Great Void,\nentering and exiting the unseen, roaming the Ten Directions of darkness.\nFive-colored clouds cover me, summoning spirits and seizing the winds,\ncommanding the myriad spirits to serve and protect the Transcendent Lords above.\n\nWhen finished, this is the hidden scripture of the Sovereign Lord’s Nine Yins, the inner practice of the Nine Perfected.\n\nThe ranks of the Five Spirits, the pathways of the Three Primes:\nThe Central Yellow Venerable Lord, the Southern Purple Essence Lord, the Eastern Azure Lad Lord, the Northern Most High Lord, and the Western Primordial Simplicity Lord—all reverse the Nine Yins to disperse their forms, deploy the Five Stars to extinguish their radiance, and blend and transform the myriad things, accomplishing all matters instantly. Those who long preserve and contemplate this become Perfected Ones above.\n\nIf the practitioner constantly cultivates this, their transformations will be boundless, and their body will generate water and fire.\n\nHere ends the Dao of the Sovereign Lord’s Nine Yins.\n\n**The Vermilion Writ of the Most High’s Jade Morning and the Rushing Solar Orb**\n**The Yellow Writ of the Knotted Radiance and the Rushing Lunar Orb**\n\nThis Dao of the rushing sun and moon is treasured and kept secret by the Four Perfected Ones of the Most High’s Supreme Clarity and the Nine Sovereigns of the Great Ultimate, as well as the Jade Writs of the Mysterious Void Jade Lord. Unless one’s name is inscribed in the Golden Pavilion and recorded in the Eastern Florescence, one cannot hear or see the titles of these two chapters.\n\nThose who practice this must first purify themselves with a hundred days of abstention, cutting off all worldly affairs. With prolonged cultivation, the sun and moon of the upper realms will grant fifty jade lads and fifty jade maidens each.\n\nThe *Vermilion Writ of the Most High’s Jade Morning* and the *Yellow Writ of the Knotted Radiance* are the sacred and secret scriptures of the Jade Sovereign Lord of the Most High. They are stored in the chambers of the Nine Heavens, upon the Cinnabar-Jasper Terrace. Unless one is diligent in heart and fond of the true, with the celestial bone-record of a Flying Mystery Heavenly Transcendent, one cannot see or hear of them. Even hearing their titles must not be spoken of carelessly, for to do so offends the Three Officials, and Heaven and Earth will not forgive.\n\nInitially, the transmission was permitted to one person every three hundred years, then again after seven hundred years. If the spirits and darkness indicate one is fit to receive it, it may be transmitted. The method of transmission is passed from master to disciple in accordance with the exalted statutes of the Mysterious. If transmitted to an unworthy person who does not follow the regulations, it is considered a leak of celestial patterns. Those who violate the oath through negligence or disrespect will become lowly ghosts after death, and their seven generations of ancestors will suffer the punishment of wind and fire. Unless of the same vital breath, one should rather keep silent.\n\nOn the Western Mystery Mountain’s Terrace of Radiance, these two scriptures are inscribed on jade tablets in golden characters. In the Clear Void Heaven of Wangwu, they exist but are not complete. Only in the Highest Terrace of the Great Mystery Palace and the northern chamber of the Penglai Prefecture’s Golden Pillar and Jade Wall are the inscriptions fully preserved. The Transcendents of the Central Palace and the various palaces of the Great Clarity do not even know what these texts are.\n\nOn the northern cavern of Mount Emei’s stone chamber doorframe, an inscription in stone reads:\n*\"The Jade Morning draws the sun’s essence; the Knotted Radiance summons the moon’s spirit.\nAttaining the Dao, one dwells in the Upper Palace, becoming a Perfected Sovereign Lord.\"*\nThese twenty characters are seen by lesser transcendents, who do not comprehend their meaning.

Constantly visualize them at one’s left and right, reciting the old incantations silently, never aloud.\n\nTo practice the Jade Morning sun-chasing Dao, gaze at the sunrise each dawn. If the sun is not visible, remain in a quiet chamber, first closing the eyes and holding the breath for ten cycles, then swallowing the sun’s radiance ten times.

      "translated_text": "Upon completion, once more visualize the yang mirror’s crimson-cloud chariot, harnessed to nine red dragons, arriving before you from the sunlight. Then, together with the Five Emperors, mount it and hasten toward the sun. Forget your form for a long while, then swallow saliva fourteen times. When finished, open your eyes and concentrate intensely, visualizing until faint outlines appear. Those who persist in this practice will surely ride the radiance to the sun—thus concludes the Way of Yūyí.\n\nTo perform the Way of Jiélín and hasten to the moon, gaze toward the moon each evening. When the moon is absent, sit in a quiet chamber, close your eyes, hold your breath for nine breaths, then swallow moonlight nine times. Visualize the moonlight entering your mouth and swallow it. Recite the names of the Five Vast Ladies and the sun’s soul, three times in all. Next, visualize the Azure Emperor’s Lady descending from the moonlight, with attendants arrayed to left and right, following the same method as the visualization of the Five Emperors within the sun. When all have arrived, visualize their robes and colors in vivid detail. Then knock the teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and softly recite:\n\n*\"Essence of yellow radiance, primordial yin’s inner pattern,\nIllumining the Great Mystery, opening the myriad realms,\nDispersing the misty cold winds, the Seven Dawns suspend jade,\nThe threefold yin revolves, heaven and earth exhale light,\nPurple luminaries drift and descend, floating blossoms fill the nine voids,\nRound brightness bestows hues, the six qi transform and flow,\nThe Five Emperor Ladies tread clouds and grasp winds,\nSpirit veils of dense silk, jade pendants and earrings,\nFeather skirts brush the clouds, transcendent fans stir the east,\nCanopy trees spread their shade, jade branches flourish like lotus,\nCloud toads refine and polish, nurturing the Tree King,\nIts roots stretch ten thousand leagues, casting shade over my body,\nSoul harmonized, spirit transformed, the six mysteries brim with numen.\nThose who return revert to infancy, jade radiance restores youth,\nThe Emperor Lords merge and transform, together with the radiant peach of health,\nTimely riding the flowing bells, ten dragons of flying clouds,\nAscend to the Luminous Palace, attaining the rank of Guardian Sovereign,\nLifespan conjoined with the two images, heaven and earth without end.\"*\n\nWhen finished, knock the teeth seven more times, swallow saliva seven times, and softly recite:\n\n*\"Sun soul, spirit essence, Pearl Radiance Red Youth,\nGrant me passage west to the Six Peaks’ gate,\nEntering the Jade Palace of Harmonious Dawn,\nThe Eight Chords’ White Hills, the Eight Radiance’ upper chambers,\nTo bear the talisman of Ten Brightnesses,\nWear the writ of the shooting star’s night glow,\nSit in the Hall of Supreme Harmony,\nAscend the Terrace of Seven Numinous Ones,\nDrink the moon’s blossom cream,\nFeast on the yellow jade’s purple nectar,\nChant the verses of the Lofty Ones,\nRecite the Jade Dawn’s true hymns.\"*\n\nUpon completion, visualize the flowing-bell flying-cloud chariot, harnessed to ten yellow dragons, arriving before you from the moonlight.

When finished, open your eyes and concentrate intensely, visualizing until faint outlines appear. Those who persist in this practice will surely ride the radiance to the moon—thus concludes the Way of Jiélín.\n\nIf one has already attained the Dao and perfected the refinement of essence and visualization, practicing this for two years will yield faint outlines; in three years, the form will appear; in five years, one may hasten to the sun and moon. For those who are not yet immortals but begin this practice in earnest, progress will not be swift. Yet with prolonged cultivation, one may ascend to the Two Radiant Ones and become a Perfected of Highest Clarity. This transmission is bestowed upon one person every seven hundred years.\n\nHere ends the *Highest Clarity Supreme Nine Perfected Central Scripture: Crimson Life-Spirit Elixir Formula*.",
