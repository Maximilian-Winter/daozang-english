  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Scripture of Original Cinnabar of the Dao Lord of the Cavern of Perfection**\n\n**Transmission of the Great Youthful Lord**\n\nThe Three Venerable Lords—the Lord of the Grand Thearch, the Lord of the Supreme Heavenly Thearch, and the Lord of the Grand Tenuity Heavenly Thearch—each formerly received the *Supreme Scripture of Original Cinnabar* from the Supreme Dao Lord. Through its practice and cultivation, they attained the Dao, ascending to supplement the authenticity of emperors and kings. On the day of their ascent into the empyrean, the Lord of the Grand Thearch transmitted the true scripture to the Queen Mother of the West; the Lord of the Supreme Heavenly Thearch transmitted it to the Lord of the Upper Prime of the Southern Culmen; and the Lord of the Grand Tenuity Heavenly Thearch transmitted the true scripture to the Sacred Lord of the Golden Portal. The Sacred Lord of the Golden Portal then transmitted the true scripture to the Prime Minister, the Youthful Lord of Azure Lads, who in turn transmitted it to Master Juan.\n\nThis scripture is the *Upper Chapter of the Primordial Numinous*, a Dao of sublime mystery beyond the reach of middling immortals. Unless one’s name is inscribed upon vermilion tablets in green characters of the Great Ultimate, the *Supreme Scripture of Original Cinnabar* will not be encountered or perceived.\n\nIf a Daoist fully cultivates the *Three True Grades of the Supreme*, their rank shall be that of the supreme duke and chief minister above emperors and kings. Should their reception be partial and their understanding of the Dao limited, their station shall be as a king of the lesser numinous palaces, a minister of the divine continent, or a grand master of the middle or lower grades of the Great Ultimate. Yet even they may ride dragons and drive clouds, soaring through the void, escorted by divine officials and scattering their radiance to the eight directions.\n\nSubtle and profoundly mysterious, it must not be lightly disclosed. The catalog of graded scriptures is concealed within the *Eight Primordial Chapters of the Supreme Hidden Writ*, subject to the constraints of reverent restraint. One must cultivate in seclusion and devotion, for the more earnest one’s resolve, the more swiftly the true person’s form shall gradually manifest.\n\nWithout your master’s sanction, do not speak of this to others.\n\nIf you hear the sound of flutes or horns in your ears, it is an auspicious omen of noble fortune. If you hear cries, wails, or shouts, it is an inauspicious omen of base misfortune. If you perceive foul *qi*, it foretells defiling or impure events—such is the verification of malodorous *qi*. Therefore, bathe anew, burn incense, and sweep your chamber in response, for this is the Lord Emperor’s earnest admonition to humankind.\n\nIf you perceive fragrant *qi*, it signifies that divine officials and numinous beings are at your side, observing your conduct. At such times, perform good deeds, practice virtue and kindness, relieve the destitute, accumulate hidden merit, and extend benevolence. The divine officials and numinous beings shall then report your deeds to the Supreme, revealing your virtue or its lack.\n\nThe subtleties of the Dao must not be overlooked, for all such signs are of this nature. If you perceive fragrant *qi*, do not disclose it to others unless they are your master. If you perceive foul *qi*, you should confess it to clarify your transgressions and the impropriety of your defilement.\n\nIf you smell the scent of blood or unexpectedly see pools of blood, it portends military calamity. Immediately retreat into seclusion among mortals, entreat the Three Primordial Lords of the Three Origins for instruction, and observe a three-month retreat in purification—thus may disaster be averted. These are the Lord Emperor’s revelations of fortune and misfortune, meant to inspire caution regarding blessings and woes.\n\nUpon witnessing inauspicious omens, practice hidden virtue, extend kindness to save others, perform deeds beyond the capacity of ordinary people, and walk paths others cannot tread—only then may you escape the fate of certain death. Take heed and do not cling to convention.\n\nThree *fen* inward from the space between the eyebrows lies the *Guardian Inch of the Twin Fields*; one *cun* inward lies the *Hall of Luminosity*; two *cun* inward lies the *Cavern Chamber*; three *cun* inward lies the *Cinnabar Field*; four *cun* inward lies the *Flowing Pearl Palace*; and five *cun* inward lies the *Palace of the Jade Emperor*.\n\nFor all methods of cultivation of the upper practices, first strike the celestial drum, cover your ears with your hands, and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"The Red Child dwells within the palace,\nThe Nine Perfected abide in the chamber.\nHearken to the divine command,\nEver vigilant against misfortune.\nThe Great One’s flowing fire\nExtinguishes ten thousand calamities.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, clap your hands over your ears seven times. If you feel warmth in your face, it is a favorable sign. If you sense cold in your head, neck, or shoulders, it indicates the entry of malign *qi*. Immediately lie down, close your eyes, and visualize the True Lord of the Great One in the *Palace of Original Cinnabar*, casting forth the radiant *Flowing Fire Bell* to expel the malign *qi* from your body. The firelight shall follow behind, illuminating your entire form until, after a long while, you are restored to equilibrium.\n\nIf you suddenly hear the sound of rushing water, thunder, or drumming in your ears, it signifies bodily exhaustion, extreme debilitation of the heart’s storehouse, and an inability to savor the true and nourish life, leading to dissipation. Thus, the six palaces lose their harmony, the hun and po wail in sorrow, and this foreshadows the onset of illness and death.\n\nThe *Muddy Pellet* has lost its method, the Nine Palaces are disordered, sorrow and disturbance reign in confusion, the drumming sounds in chaos, and the spirits seek to abandon their abode, forsaking the body. Upon hearing this, concentrate your thoughts on the True Lord of the Great One, restoring the focused sincerity of your true heart. If your transgressions are not profound, you may yet hear and reform. Deafness arises when the spirit of the ears has departed.\n\nThe ears are the Lord Emperor’s gates of hearing. The eyes are the sun and moon of the Great One. The nose is the hills and mountains of the Three Origins. The mouth is the crimson abyss of the *Vermilion Palace*. The eyebrows are the floral canopy of the White Prime. The hair is the forest essence of the *Hall of Luminosity*. The tongue is the dragon carriage of the *Peerless*. The teeth are the mighty power of the *Stomach Palace*. The hands are the external aid of the gallbladder spirit. The feet are the numinous gates of the kidney origin. The utmost yin is the true mechanism of the *Cavern Chamber*.\n\nThe single body harbors a hundred spirits, each with its proper domain—these must not be overlooked, nor treated with carelessness.\n\nIf you suddenly hear the sounds of gold and jade in your ears, it signifies the arrival of true *qi* and the imminent completion of the Dao.\n\nIf you suddenly hear the sounds of stringed music, the Six Ding Jade Maidens come to guard you—this signifies the Dao is about to be accomplished.\n\nAbove the space between the eyebrows lies the *Yellow Gate* and *Purple Portal*, the *Crimson Terrace* and *Azure Chamber*, jointly established to guard the *cun* on either side of the ears. To the left of the *cun* stands the *Crimson Terrace*, and to the right, the *Yellow Gate*. The True Persons of the Nine Palaces enter and exit through the space between the *Yellow Gate* and *Crimson Terrace*, guided by the Dao. Thus, the terraces and gates are placed on either side. These terraces and gates serve to observe extraordinary *qi* conditions and welcome the comings and goings of the True Persons.\n\nThe great spirit of the *Purple Portal* is named *Pingjing* (\"Peaceful Stillness\"), styled *Fawang* (\"Dharma King\"). The great spirit of the *Azure Chamber* is named *Zhengxin* (\"Upright Heart\"), styled *Chufang* (\"Initial Square\"). Both resemble infants, each clad in robes matching the color of their respective chamber or portal, and each holds a *liujin* (\"flowing-gold\") fire-bell.\n\nThe *cun* recedes inward by three *fen*, hence its name, *shoucun* (\"guarding inch\"). At dawn, dusk, and during meditation, first visualize the two great spirits, faintly perceiving their forms. Then call their names thrice, and softly intone:\n\n*\"Purple Portal, Azure Chamber,*\n*Two great spirits, hands grasping flowing bells,*\n*Bodies generating wind and clouds,*\n*Flanking and guarding the true Dao,*\n*Barred to all external intrusions.*\n*May my thoughts and perceptions*\n*Open the numinous gates,*\n*Ensuring smooth and upright passage,*\n*Ascending through the Nine Portals,*\n*To behold the Nine True Ones,*\n*And the august presence of the Most High.\"*\n\nAfter the incantation, proceed to visualize the Three Ones, the Cavern Chambers, the Ninefold Dao, and all essential practices.\n\nThe two great spirits of the *shoucun* heed only the true officials within the Nine Palaces. When these officials, bearing the Mandate of the Supreme Emperor, or the Jade Lads, numinous perfected ones, sages, immortals, or any of the various imperial chariots, come and go, the two great spirits permit their passage. All others, being untrue, are barred from entering the inner palace. Such is the discipline of the *Central Yellow* and *Supreme One*.\n\nThereupon, the Infant Sovereign commands the ear spirits *Jiaonü* (\"Delicate Maiden\") and *Yunyi* (\"Cloud Ornament\") to guide them in. Thus, when one perceives ringing in the ears, it signals the arrival of an external emissary. Depending on whether the visitor is auspicious or inauspicious, *Yunyi* strikes the chime and bell to alert the Nine Palaces, ensuring vigilance against intruders. The chime and bell produce the very sounds that cause the ears to ring.\n\nUpon hearing this, place your hands over your ears and intone:\n\n*\"The Red Child dwells within the palace,*\n*The Nine True Ones abide in the chambers.*\n*I beseech you to heed the divine command,*\n*And ever discern what is inauspicious.\"*\n\nWithin the *Cinnabar Field* resides the *Supreme One True Lord of the Upper Origin*, along with the Sovereign’s ministers—a total of three—who together govern the palace of the *Cinnabar Field* and uphold the Dao of the Three Origins’ True One. This is the essential purport of the *Earthly Perfected* and the scripture of *Mounting the Dragon Chariot*.\n\nThe Heavenly Honored One often delights in becoming an *Earthly Perfected*. The *Earthly Perfected* retreats into official seclusion, untroubled by the toils of courtly banquets, thus moving leisurely and at ease, wandering as the occasion arises. They ascend in the *Seven Chariots* and tread the *Primordial Qi* within the *Great Nonbeing*. Though the *Heavenly Perfected* and *Earthly Perfected* differ slightly in rank, both are equally true. Each abides contentedly in their proper place, no longer aspiring to become officials in the clouds.\n\nWithin the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace* resides the *Mud-Pill Supreme One True Lord*. One *cun* behind the *Cinnabar Field* lies the *Flowing Pearl Palace*, whose true spirit is detailed in a separate scripture and governs the actions of the *Controller of Destiny*. Its Dao is profoundly wondrous; ( ) oaths and silk offerings are pledged, and covenants are sworn before it can be transmitted. This scripture is passed down once every three hundred years, and once bestowed, it may not be disseminated further. Such is the Dao of the *Supreme Polarity’s* ministers and the *Controller of Destiny*.\n\nThe *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace* is located above the *Cinnabar Field*, precisely one *cun* square, a purple chamber with green walls, filled with crimson mist. Within it, the *Mud-Pill Supreme One True Lord* governs the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace*. The True Lord resembles a newborn infant, seated upon a golden bed within a jade canopy, clad in a purple embroidered brocade robe, with a belt bearing *flowing-fire bells*. These *flowing-fire bells* are formless yet radiate crimson light; when moved, their sound resonates for thousands of miles—such is the precious bell of the *Central Yellow Supreme One True Person* of the *Upper Clarity*.\n\nIn the left hand, the True Lord grasps the handle of the *Northern Dipper’s* seven stars, and in the right, the *North Star’s* guiding rope. The *North Star* is the unmoving pole star, known as the *Celestial Guiding Rope*. Seated upright in the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace*, facing outward, the True Lord has no attendants on either side. The absence of attendants is why the title *Supreme One True Lord* is conferred.\n\nAt dawn and dusk, after attending to the Three Ones, one may then proceed to visualize the True Lord. This order—first the light, then the weighty—ensures proper cultivation.\n\nA person’s head contains nine palaces; let us first describe them. Above the space between the eyebrows lies the *Yellow Gate*. After visualizing it, call the names of the Three Lords thrice and strike the *Heavenly Drum* twenty-four times. A thousand demons will submit, and ten thousand ghosts and malevolent spirits will vanish.\n\nIf a Daoist feels hunger or thirst, visualize the Three Lords, and from their mouths exhale crimson *qi* to fill your own mouth. Inhale and swallow it, and soon you will be sated. If a Daoist travels at night and cannot see the path, visualize the Three Lords, causing their mouths to emit three beams of fire to illuminate the way, and the road will instantly become bright and clear.\n\nIf one finds oneself in perilous or treacherous places, amid the dangers of blades and weapons, swiftly visualize the Three Lords, causing them to ring their jade bells. Concentrate and focus your thoughts, and enemies will naturally be seized with fear and awe, no longer harboring malicious or harmful intentions.\n\nIf a Daoist seeks to prolong life, attain longevity, and avoid death, or to be rescued and revived when gravely ill, compose the mind, lie down peacefully, and with focused intent, visualize the Three Lords of the *Hall of Luminosity*. Kneel facing outward, exhale crimson *qi* so that its light envelops your body, encircling your mouth. Swallow the crimson *qi* repeatedly, without count. Close your eyes and gently swallow it. Soon, the crimson *qi* will coil around your body, transforming into fire that burns your form. Body and fire become one, radiating light within and without. After a long while, cease—this is called *Refining the Form with Sun and Moon*, reviving the dead.\n\nAt dawn and dusk, when lying down at night, one should regularly practice this, and one will surely attain longevity and avoid death. Frequently visualizing and swallowing crimson *qi* will restore youthful complexion, making one’s countenance like that of a child—this is the Way of immortality, the essential secret of the *Hall of Luminosity* observed by transcendents.\n\nEach morning upon rising, one should swallow saliva thirty times, regularly wiping the face and rubbing the eyes with the hands, visualizing the saliva as crimson fluid. Within the *Cavern Chamber* reside the Three Perfected Lords: to the left is the Lord of Non-Florescence, to the right is the White Prime Lord, and in the center is the Yellow Elder Lord. These Three Perfected Lords together govern the *Cavern Chamber*, and this is the Way of Ascending Transcendence, which is expounded in separate scriptures.\n\nWithin the *Cinnabar Field* resides the Supreme Perfected Unity Lord of the Upper Origin. As for the Three Ones of the *Mud-Pellet Heavenly Emperor*, they are the spiritual essence of the body, the root of the hundred spirits, the mountain source of fluids, and the jade chamber of the ethereal soul. Thus, the *Stomach Pool* is square in form to receive things, while the *Brain Palace* is round and empty to accommodate the true. Myriad hairs stand erect, and a thousand pores emit mist. Virtue fills Heaven and Earth, merging with the Great Mystery—hence it is called the *Mud-Pellet*. The *Mud-Pellet* is the supreme spirit above the bodily form.\n\nThose who only know how to swallow *qi*, gurgle with saliva, click their teeth, and ingest fluids, yet do not understand their origin, merely grasp the overflow of the *Mud-Pellet* and the peripheral branches of the brain. Now I shall reveal to you the secret of guarding the One to hasten progress toward transcendence, so that you may become a Perfected One of the highest immortals.\n\nDisciples who receive this scripture must purify themselves with sincerity for forty-five days before transmission. Offer forty feet of green silk, five bright mirrors, and two pairs of gold rings as the covenant of *Penetrating Unity*, swearing an oath not to disclose it.\n\nOne inch above the space between the eyebrows lies the *Hall of Luminosity*; two inches inward is the *Cavern Chamber*; three inches inward is the *Cinnabar Field*. Directly above the *Cinnabar Field*, one inch square, lies the *Mysterious Cinnabar*, the essence of the brain, the *Mud-Pellet*, and the palace of the ethereal soul.\n\nWithin the *Hall of Luminosity* reside: to the left, the Luminous Youth Perfected Lord; to the right, the Luminous Maiden Perfected Lord; and in the center, the Luminous Mirror Spirit Lord. The Luminous Youth Perfected Lord is named *Mysterious Yang*, styled *Lesser Azure*. The Luminous Maiden Perfected Lord is named *Subtle Yin*, styled *Lesser Origin*. The Luminous Mirror Spirit Lord is named *Illuminating Essence*, styled *Fourfold Luminosity*. These Three Lords together govern the *Hall of Luminosity*, all clad in brocade robes, girded with four jade bells, and holding a jade mirror in their mouths—both the mirrors and bells are of crimson jade. Their heads resemble those of infants, as does their form. They sit facing outward or toward one another.\n\nThis is the Way of the *Hall of Luminosity*, practiced by transcendents and cultivated through the Dao and its virtue. If a Daoist feels fear, they should visualize the Three Spirits, causing the jade bells to chime so that the sound reaches the *Great Ultimate*, and the mouth to emit a crimson light from the jade mirror, extending ten thousand yards.\n\nOne inch above the *Hall of Luminosity* is the *Celestial Court Palace*; one inch above the *Cavern Chamber* is the *Utmost Perfection Palace*; one inch above the *Cinnabar Field* is the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace*; and one inch above the *Flowing Pearl Palace* is the *Supreme August Palace*. Altogether, there are nine palaces within the head.\n\nThe scriptures of the *Hall of Luminosity*, *Cavern Chamber*, *Cinnabar Field*, and *Flowing Pearl* are the Way by which transcendents become Perfected Ones, transmitted through the ages. The scripture of the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace* contains the essential words of the Perfected Officials who oversee destiny, serving as the leader of the four palaces.\n\nThis scripture may only be transmitted when the *Great Ultimate Emperor Lord* deems it permissible, and even then, it is granted only at the proper time. Those who practice the Way of the Five Palaces in the world and possess a true name will encounter it. Without the destined bone and fate, one will not hear these words.\n\nThere is also the *Jade Emperor Palace*, where the *Jade Purity Spirit Mother* resides; the *Celestial Court Palace*, where the *Upper Purity Perfected Maiden* resides; the *Utmost Perfection Palace*, where the *Great Ultimate Empress* resides; and the *Supreme August Palace*, where the *Supreme Lord’s Consort* resides. These four palaces are governed by the Feminine Perfected Unity, whose Way surpasses that of the Masculine Perfected Unity. Each has its own precious scripture, transmitted only to those who have already attained Perfection. Those who have not yet achieved Perfection are unworthy to hear of it. The essentials of the Feminine Perfected Unity are likewise not to be received lightly.\n\nThe *Supreme Lord* emerged from the *Eight Radiant Scenes of the Ultimate*, entered the *Jasper Terrace*, attended by three thousand jade maidens who served the Perfected and supported the chariot, with spirit consorts singing in harmony and divine attendants holding towels—all practiced the Way of the Feminine One, using it to ascend to the grand assembly of the *Mysterious Dawn*. This is the ancestral root of the *Supreme Lord*, transmitted by the *Spiritual Sovereign*.\n\nThese four palaces exist within all people, but those who do not cultivate this Way leave their palaces empty. Those who do not fully cultivate the Nine Palaces also leave their palaces empty—not only the four palaces of the Feminine Perfected. Within the *Cinnabar Field Palace*, the Emperor Lord is always present, and a great spirit guards the center, though one does not perceive them until cultivation reveals their presence. Those who cultivate become transcendents; those who do not merely live out their years and die.\n\nThe Way of the Feminine and Masculine Unity may be cultivated by both men and women, with no exceptions. Only through utmost dedication and perseverance will one reap its benefits.\n\nThe Way of the *Mysterious Cinnabar Supreme Unity Perfected Lord* requires that at dusk and in quiet repose, one dispel all distracting thoughts, sitting or lying as one wishes. First, visualize the purple *qi* of the *Northern Culmen Star* descending into the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace*. Soon, the palace fills, and the *qi* overflows beyond the body, enveloping it and penetrating both within and without, merging with the purple *qi* as one.\n\nThen, visualize the sun entering the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace*, filling it so that it resides at the center of the purple *qi*, appearing like a fiery pearl seen in darkness. Next, visualize the *Middle Yellow Supreme Unity Perfected Lord* of *Upper Purity* descending from the purple *qi* of the *Northern Culmen* into the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace*, seated within the sun. The Lord’s name is *Regulating Florescence*, styled *Transforming Mystery*, with attire and countenance as described above.\n\nFinally, visualize your own body suddenly ascending into the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace*, seated before the *Supreme Unity Perfected Lord*. Clad in whatever garments you envision, bow twice with reverence, kneel, and inquire of the Lord, seeking the Way of transcendence and longevity, speaking as your heart desires.\n\nThen visualize swallowing the purple *qi* thirty times, completing the count, and swallowing saliva thirty times. Next, visualize within the Northern Dipper’s seven stars two crimson *qi* as large as the sun, descending directly into the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace*. Thereupon, the *Supreme Unity Perfected Lord* and yourself together mount the sun and traverse the path of crimson *qi*, ascending directly to the *Northern Dipper’s* *Kui* constellation. Rest there for a long while, and upon waking from this meditation, true responses will manifest.\n\nAfter fourteen years of this practice, you will wander together with the *Supreme Unity*, both reaching the *Seven Origins’* guiding principles. After sixteen years, you will ascend to the *Upper Purity Palace* to receive scriptures and wear talismans, commanding jade lads and jade maidens, eighty each. Perform this visualization every night without fail, counting only the repetitions—do not skip a single night. This Way may also be cultivated exclusively, without requiring adherence to the *Three Ones*. Combined practice refines essence more swiftly, hastening spiritual resonance.\n\nOn the first, third, seventh, eleventh, and fifteenth days of the lunar month, at midnight, visualize the *Supreme Unity Perfected Lord* within the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace*, seated facing outward, exhaling azure *qi* that enters your mouth. Swallow it fifty times, then swallow saliva fifty times, and recite the invocation:\n\n*\"Supreme Unity Perfected Sovereign, Middle Yellow Purple Lord, whose name is* Regulating Florescence, *styled* Transforming Mystery, *seated upon a golden couch within a jade canopy, draped in purple embroidery and brocade skirts, girded with flowing-fire bells to sever evil and destroy treachery, grasping star essence in hand, head bearing the sun’s true radiance—now seated in rectitude, exhaling* qi *for me to swallow, speaking with me, feasting together in the* Mysterious Cinnabar. *Refine and irrigate my seven po, harmonize and soften my three hun, that divine spirits may attend and guard me, enabling my ascent as an immortal. Let my five viscera regenerate, restoring my youthful countenance. Receive the scriptures of* Upper Purity *and serve as* Controller of Destiny *under the Thearch. May all wishes and desires be fulfilled, and a hundred blessings renewed.\"*\n\nThen visualize yourself ascending into the palace, resting before the *Supreme Unity*. As you fall asleep, wondrous responses will manifest in dreams.\n\nThrough such repeated accumulation, one gradually attains the opportunity for encounter. The *Dragon Script of the Supreme* states: \"Sit upright in the *Mysterious Cinnabar*, neither slanted nor deviant.\" This is the essence of the Way—you must constantly visualize the *Supreme Unity’s* purple *qi* swirling around your body and swallow it. You must also visualize the *True Lord of the Supreme Unity* residing within the *Mysterious Cinnabar* Palace. Thus, you shall attain boundless longevity, and no misfortune shall assail you. This is the culmination of the *Mysterious Cinnabar* Dao.\n\nFrom the *Wondrous Scripture of the Pure Numinous Center*:\nThe *Lord of the Grand Thearch*, the *Supreme Celestial Thearch*, and the *Celestial Thearch of the Grand Tenuity*—these Three Venerable Lords—once received the *Upper Scripture of the Mysterious Cinnabar* from the *Lord of the Supreme Dao*. Through its practice and cultivation, they ascended to replenish the true essence of emperors and kings. On the day of their ascent into the heavens, the *Lord of the Grand Thearch* transmitted the true scripture to the *Queen Mother of the West*; the *Supreme Celestial Thearch* transmitted it to the *Upper Prime Lord of the Southern Culmen*; and the *Celestial Thearch of the Grand Tenuity* transmitted it to the *Sacred Lord of the Golden Watchtower*. The *Sacred Lord of the Golden Watchtower* then passed it to the *Prime Minister of the Azure Lad*, who in turn transmitted it to *Master Juan*. This scripture is the *Upper Chapter of the Pure Numinous*, a teaching of profound subtlety, not to be heard by middling immortals. Unless one’s name is inscribed on crimson tablets with emerald characters in the *Great Ultimate*, the *Upper Scripture of the Mysterious Cinnabar* will not be encountered or witnessed.\n\nIf a Daoist fully cultivates the *Three True Scriptures of the Supreme*, their rank shall be that of *Supreme Duke* and *Prime Minister* above emperors and kings. If one’s reception of the teachings is partial or their understanding of the Dao limited, their rank shall be that of a minor king in the *Palace of Numinous Lesser Realms*, a minister of the *Divine Continent*, or a *Grand Master* of the *Great Ultimate’s* middle or lower ranks. Yet even they shall ride dragons and drive clouds, soaring through the void, escorted by divine officials, their radiance dispersing to the eight directions. How subtle and profound—this must not be lightly disclosed.\n\nThe titles of these scriptures derive from the *Hidden Writings of the Supreme* in the *Eight Pure Chapters*, which follow the structure of celestial and terrestrial correspondences. The *Three Ones of the Mud-Pill Palace Thearch* are the spiritual origin of the body, the root of life for the hundred spirits, the mountain source of fluids, and the jade chamber of the *hun* and essence. Thus, the stomach’s reservoir is square to receive matter, while the brain’s palace is round and empty to accommodate the true. Ten thousand hairs stand erect, a thousand pores emit mist, virtue aligns with celestial power, and all merges with the *Great Mystery*. The *Nine Numinous Primes* of the *Pure Origin* are thus called the *Upper Treasury of the Mud-Pill Palace*. The *Upper Treasury of the Mud-Pill Palace* is the supreme spirit within the form of the Great Dao.\n\nYet if you only know how to swallow *qi* and ingest fluids, to sound the *Celestial Drum* and absorb saliva, without understanding their origin—these are but the overflowing foam of the *Mud-Pill Palace’s* upper stream, mere tributaries of the brain’s domain. Now I shall reveal to you the secret of *Guarding the One*, practiced in accordance with the twelve hours. Each spirit possesses a surname, given name, native land, palace, attire, and luminous hue.\n\nIf you wish to compound the *Divine Elixir*, you must visualize these spirits’ forms and colors:\nThe male is nine *cun* and nine *fen* in height, girded with a sash of five colors—mysterious yellow and pure numinous silk. He wears a cap adorned with seven treasures and vermilion jade, crowned with the *Infinite Wisdom* cap. He dwells in the *Crimson Palace of the Supreme Ultimate*, the *Uppermost Treasury of the Five Numinous Realms* in the *Mysterious Origin Hamlet*. His surname is *Lian*, given name *Xian*, courtesy name *Huangyan*.\n\nThe female is six *cun* and six *fen* in height, robed in a nine-colored sash of azure treasure, divine radiance, brocade, frost-silk, and luminous hues. She wears a *Mysterious Yellow Wisdom* cap and resides in the *Supreme Palace of Kunlun’s Great Seclusion*, the *Hall of Brightness* in the *Nine Radiant Realms* of the *Great Transformation Hamlet*. Her surname is omitted, given name *Hui*, courtesy name *Biyu*.\n\nThese two, when beheld, are the parents of the *Divine Elixir* that gives birth to great immortals. Before the primordial *qi* took form, before the five governances were established, before light and shadow were distinguished—there was neither limit nor end, neither above nor below, neither exterior nor interior, neither left nor right, neither before nor after. They are the primal ancestors of the *Supreme*, the parents of primordial *qi*, the ultimate subtlety of the *Mysterious Origin*, the unmanifest of the *Empty Ultimate*. From them, the ten thousand things are born, and heaven and earth endure.\n\nIf they dwell among humans, their lifespan is the longest. Those who can visualize them shall live a thousand years without aging, dwelling also among the Nine Heavens, where the myriad spirits receive their transmission.\n\nWhen compounding the elixir, all ingredients must first be prepared with fasting, purification, and ritual purity. Once the elixir is complete, its efficacy will manifest. It is called the *Mysterious Elixir*, and the essence-water of a virgin girl is also excellent for its preparation. To compound the elixir, you must do so with a virgin girl in a secluded place. Three people should avoid contact with the profane. For three days and nights, erect a yellow altar.\n\nIn the east, place the *Azure Dragon* talisman to subdue wood essence, inscribed in blue;\nIn the south, place the *Vermilion Bird* talisman to subdue fire essence, inscribed in red;\nIn the west, place the *White Tiger* talisman to subdue metal essence, inscribed in white;\nIn the north, place the *Dark Warrior* talisman to subdue water essence, inscribed in black;\nIn the center, place the *Yellow Dragon* talisman to subdue earth essence, inscribed in yellow.\n\nErect the five talismans in their respective forms, then compound the elixir. The essence of numinous sand and herbal medicines may all be combined into the elixir. When a *knife-tip’s* measure enters the mouth, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nDuring compounding, beware of defilement—if the elixir fails, it will cost you your life. The oral instructions for compounding must not neglect the order of the Nine Heavens and Nine Earths. Know their sequence well:\n\nThe *Heaven of Supreme Purity* is the upper treasury of the Nine Heavens, the first generation, its *qi* pure and empty, the abode of the Most Revered.\nThe *Heaven of Pure Tenuity* is the uppermost palace of the first rank, the second generation, its *qi* subtle and wondrous, governed by the next in reverence.\nThe *Great Crimson Heaven* is the upper palace of the northern first rank, the third generation, its *qi* vermilion and cinnabar, ruled by the *Lord of the Great Yang*.\nThe *Great Azure Heaven* is the treasury of the *Mysterious Origin*, the fourth generation, its *qi* profound and distant, ruled by the *Lord of Emptiness and Non-Being*.\nThe *Great Mysterious Dark Heaven* is the palace of the *Northern Capital*, the fifth generation, its *qi* wondrous and obscure, ruled by the *Lord of the Infinite*.\n\nThe *Heaven of Great Mystery* is the northern first-rank palace, the sixth generation, its *qi* profound and silent, ruled by the *Lord of the Great Dao*.\nThe *Heaven of Grand Radiance* is the capital treasury of the Seven Governances, the seventh generation, its *qi* vast and boundless, all-embracing, ruled by the *Most High Lord Lao*.\nThe *Heaven of the Great Mysterious Capital* is the upper palace of the Northern Peace, the eighth generation, its *qi* pure and ordered, ruled by the *Lord of Virtue and Power*.\nThe *Heaven of Great Clarity* is the palace of the myriad yang immortals’ origin, the ninth generation, its *qi* luminous and bright, ruled by the *Lord of Supreme Purity*.\n\nThus the Nine Heavens are all pure, the Nine Lands stand in order, and the myriad beings flourish. Yin and yang, sun and moon, the four seasons and five phases—all follow their course.\nWhen the primal *qi* abides in Heaven, Heaven becomes clear; when it descends to Earth, the myriad beings are born. Wherever the One dwells, all is luminous and bright.\nThus what Heaven values is the Dao, and what man values is the treasure. Heaven’s Dao is not recklessly bestowed, and man’s treasure is not carelessly spoken of—hence the Dao is weighty while man is light.\n\nFrom the *Great Beginning* and *Great Origin*, the One is profoundly subtle, the root of all mysteries.\nThe *Lesser Yang*’s *Crimson Canopy* is the *Vermilion Palace*; the *Great One*’s *Yellow Court* is the *Great Crimson Palace*. Golden palaces and jade chambers, secluded passes and flanking gates—where the *Jade Gate* first rises and the *Jade Stem* first grows. The Kunlun Mountains stand atop the *Jade Tower’s* summit, soaring upward a distance of nineteen thousand *li*. Within lies profound subtlety: five-colored *langgan* jade. Above dwells the *Great One*, below the *Vermilion Palace*. It may manifest or vanish in an instant, born of the primal *qi*, all-embracing. When the Dao’s virtue is one, it becomes weighty indeed.\n\nMan is born of Earth from the *qi* of the *Primal Beginning*. Without Earth’s generative sequence, the essences of the myriad beings upon the land would not dare harm man.\nThe first land is called *Primal Virtue*, its *qi* azure above and yellow within, governed by the *Minister of Primal Earth*. Its depth is eleven thousand one hundred and ten *li*, where all officials of the earthly realm reside.\nThe second land, *August Virtue*, is pervaded by blackness, governed by the *Deputy of Primal Court Earth*. Its depth is the same as above, where all earthly officials reside.\nThe third land, *Imperial Virtue*, is pervaded by verdant blue, governed by the *Earth Dragon of the Tiger’s Maw*. Its depth is the same as above, where all earthly officials reside.\nThe fourth land, *Kingly Virtue*, is pervaded by yellow, governed by the *Great General of Primal Heart Earth*. Its depth is likewise the same.\nThe fifth land, *Primal Virtue*, is pervaded by red, governed by the *Officer of Primal Blessing Earth*. Its depth is the same as above.\nThe sixth land, *Earthly Virtue*, is pervaded by white, governed by the *One of Primal Bone Earth*. Its depth is the same as above.\nThe seventh land, *Inner Virtue*, is pervaded by purple, governed by the *Parents of the Dawn Earth*. Its depth is the same as above.\nThe eighth land, *Returning Virtue*, is pervaded by azure, governed by the *Ancestral Rectifier of the Worthy Earth*. Its depth is the same as above.\nThe ninth land, *Flourishing Virtue*, is pervaded by green, governed by the *Two Thousand Stone Officers of the Celestial Axle*. Its depth is the same as above.\nThe count of their *qi* derives from the *Frigid Waters of the Great Cold Region*.\n\nIf a Daoist can thoroughly comprehend the two scrolls herein, they will commune with the numinous in Heaven and Earth. Thereafter, in practice, they will not undergo the trials of the Nine Heavens, Nine Lands, or Nine Waters; they will not enter the *Hill of Cold*, nor endure freezing chill, but will join the ranks of the luminous and pure among the six pitch-pipes in Heaven.\nShould a Daoist disregard these teachings, they will descend into the Yellow Springs, undergoing trials in the prisons of the earthly hells, destined for the *Hill of Cold*. Though they may be ghosts, their forms will still suffer venomous torment, agony so intense it cannot be borne—such is the fate of spectral servitude. Their words may be false, but their suffering is real. Their descendants, male and female, will not live out their years but will meet untimely ends.\nMoreover, in the *Ghost Statutes of the Blue Maiden* and the eight scrolls of the imperial decrees, ghosts submit of their own accord.\nThese two sacred texts must not be mingled with others unless inscribed on cinnabar tablets.\n\nOne must fully grasp the palaces and chambers within the body, the dwelling places of the spirits: one hundred eighty palaces, three hundred sixty joints, one thousand two hundred apertures, twelve thousand radiant essences, and thirty-six thousand spirit lords.\nHere dwells the Most Revered, where the *Mysterious Sages* reside. The three *hun* and seven *po*, the twelve bodily forms and shadows, respond to myriad sounds.\nThus the reckoning of yin and yang is complete in the Three Origins: the head as the *Heavenly Origin*, the heart as the *Middle Origin*, and the kidneys as the *Lower Origin*—all governed by thirty-six thousand spirit lords. This is called the *Subtle Mystery of the Three Origins*, distinguished as left and right.\nHence: left is azure, right is white; front is red, back is black; center is true yellow.\nThe six pitch-pipes emerge from this, governed by the twenty-four *qi*, each with its own domain. The *Primal Elders* and their deputies number thirty-six thousand.\nTransformations shift without end; though one may briefly evade a time, this is not death but merely a change of form.\nThus the myriad spirits are established among the myriad beings. When their forces converge and accumulate, they coalesce into human *qi*; when dispersed, the spirits scatter. Once the spirits scatter, the body can no longer move, and the true form naturally conceals itself.\nOrdinary people, growing old, simply do not understand this principle and call it permanent death, wailing in grief. Yet this is no different from the hundred insects: on the first day of the *Beginning of Winter*, they all shed their skins outside their burrows, their forms returning to the earth. At the *Waking of Insects* in mid-spring, they emerge again, unaware of where they shed their skins—just like newborn infants.\n\nI often see you all briefly appear in the world, yet you do not study the Dao of immortality, nor harmonize with divine medicines. Instead, you incur transgressions and endure punishments until your allotted time is complete, then return to your descendants’ bodies, taking form anew—how can you not understand this?\nIf you have committed transgressions, cultivate merit to atone for them, and make amends for past faults by observing the prohibitions and decrees. Thus it is said: when ancestors act with virtue, blessings flow to their descendants; when they act with wickedness, sins befall later generations. This is because their earthly punishments are not yet complete, and when their time is up, they return to the world to repay their debts—not because they themselves committed evil in this life.\n\nGuard your words carefully, for the Examiners watch over you day and night. The mouth is the Gate of Heaven—do not recklessly transmit [these teachings]. To transmit them to the unworthy is to forfeit fifty years of your allotted lifespan.\n\nBy the statutes of the luminous code: on the day of *gengshen*, the six *po*-spirits of the body ascend to the Celestial Treasury and return to the human form. On this day, face east and sit upright—beware of sleeping or lying down. Pray thus: *\"Spirits of the Five Viscera, abide in your palaces and chambers. Together, contemplate the proper method. If any leaks forth, suppress it: if it leaks from the head, press the feet; all depends on the master’s guidance.\"*\n\nThe arts of contemplating the viscera: within my body, the three *hun*-souls dwell in my liver on the left, the seven *po*-spirits in my lungs on the right. One hundred and twenty forms and shadows, twelve thousand rays of essence and light, enter through the Celestial Bridge of my mouth, ascending to Kunlun Mountain, the Prefecture of Fanyang, the Land of Non-Action. The Vermilion Bird leads the way, bearing banners; the Dark Warrior follows, bearing bells and drums. The Azure Dragon attends on the left, the White Tiger on the right. The Yellow Spirit of the Center wields the battle-axe. A thousand ghosts and ten thousand spirits prostrate themselves, none daring to rise. Ahead lies a cauldron of boiling liquid holding ten thousand *shi*; behind, scales bristle and claws reverse. May you, my lord, dissolve my calamities and disperse my misfortunes. As I pass through this time, I tread the Three Bonds and Six Relations, severing the demons—*hasten, as the statutes command!*\n\nAs a Daoist, you must listen and observe within your body. By its radiance and hue, you will know whether it is emaciated and *qi*-depleted, struck by the six vile and malevolent ghosts. At the hour when the sun is at its zenith, retire to a secluded chamber, close your eyes, and gaze inward for a long while. If you see a resplendent glow, bright and flourishing, then your body is robust, and your year will be one of vigor. Stop your ears and listen inwardly: if you hear the sound of metal and stone, or the tones of reed pipes, the five notes, bells, and chimes, these are all auspicious signs. But if the light appears faint and thin, or you hear wailing and lamentation, these are all inauspicious omens.\n\nYou must then compose and harmonize your spirit, and visualize the True Unity Lord returning to govern within your palace-chambers. Recite the incantation: *\"My form is host to ten thousand spirits. Secure my palace-chambers; guard my Jade Hall, and let none wander astray. Guardian warriors at the gates, Central Youths—if any extraordinary being enters or departs, seize them and deliver them to the market square. Bind their heads and cover their faces; let them not stir—hasten, as the statutes command!\"*\n\nIf you perceive your essence-light growing faint and thin, at the hour when the sun or moon first rises, face east and sit upright. Pray thus: *\"Warm and radiant, warm and radiant, essence-light bright! I swallow *qi* and consume shadows, drawing them into my form. Support my body and summon the divine spirits. Let true *qi* return to govern, cutting off perverse essences. Grant me long life and ten thousand years of longevity—hasten, as the statutes command!\"* Swallow nine times and cease.\n\nIf your body suddenly feels disquieted, your heart sorrowful and pensive, as though longing for something yet without clear cause, your mind restless and unable to find peace—this is precisely when the spirits within your body yearn to depart, longing for their palace-chambers. The three *hun* have already gone; the seven *po* take flight. Only the form remains, now mingling with perverse forces. In dreams, you may encounter women or men, exchanging essence and leaking spirit—these are all omens of death. Should such signs appear, you must reform yourself anew. Approach a Daoist libationer to present a memorial, and kneel in supplication to express your sorrow. Establish minor merits to soothe your heart and mind. From this day forward, observe the proper times for cultivation: pay homage to the Four Honored Ones, practice the Three, Five, Seven, Nine; the Two, Four, Six, Eight; the Eight Winds, Twelve Thunders, Twenty-Four Rains, Three Hundred Sixty Lightning Bolts, Nine Palaces, and Eight Trigrams. Do not mingle the true with the false, nor engage in improper conduct, lest the Examiners report you. After death, the Three Offices will grant no pardon.\n\nWhen facing south, the Vermilion Bird of the South should face south, and the talisman likewise. When facing west, the White Tiger of the West should face south, and the talisman should face west.\n\nWhen facing north, the Dark Warrior of the North should face south, and the talisman likewise face north. When at the center, the Yellow Dragon should face south, and the talisman face east. When facing east, the Azure Dragon should face south, and the talisman face east—all inscribed on peachwood tablets.\n\nThis Azure Dragon talisman severs wood spirits.\nThis Vermilion Bird talisman severs fire spirits.\nThis White Tiger talisman severs metal spirits.\nThis Dark Warrior talisman severs water spirits.\nThis Yellow Dragon talisman severs earth spirits.\n\n*The Threefold Statutes of the Nine Perfected Illuminated Regulations from the Cavern of Perfection*\n\nThe Most High addressed the Celestial Thearchs, the Sagely Sovereigns of Later Ages, the Supreme Ministers and Azure Lads, and the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, saying: All later disciples who obtain sight of the Three Caverns’ precious writs or the first scrolls of the secret scriptures shall have their names inscribed in gold characters in the Eastern Florescence and recorded in the Upper Clarity. Though they may not yet soar to the Purple Court with reins in hand, they are already those destined for transcendence.\n\nYet even if they behold these texts, without knowing the *Nine Perfected Illuminated Regulations*—the protocols and standards of the Three Caverns’ wondrous writs and the Most High’s precious books—they cannot casually unroll them. These illuminated regulations, treasured and secret, are concealed within the Palace of the Dark Capital, in the Golden Chambers of the Jade Metropolis, and are not transmitted to the world. They clarify the profound mysteries of the Three Caverns, mark the rituals of the assembled perfected, deliver those with karmic bonds from the dark palaces, elevate the Seven Mysteries to the registers of immortality, interweave the threads of the ten thousand Dao, and dissolve the heavy burdens of the Nine Yin. Their wonders are attainable; when their statutes are put into practice, they instill solemn discipline.\n\nNow, therefore, I reveal the threefold outline of these regulations to assist in the propagation of the Three Wondrous and Pristine Numinous Scriptures, that they may serve as admonitions to later disciples. Let those who aspire to diligence take heed of these precious statutes.\n\nThe Celestial Thearchs, the Nine Mysteries’ Sagely Sovereigns, the Supreme Ministers and Azure Lads, the Perfected Lads of the Great Ultimate, and the Perfected of the Great Ultimate bowed their heads and dared to inquire of the Most High Heavenly Worthy: The supreme and true methods are lofty, transcendent, and limpid, vast and boundless in their myriad manifestations; they are profoundly still and empty, their wondrous subtleties radiant and resplendent. Their teachings transform the Three Vehicles, pervading countless kalpas—who could be equal to them? How could one neglect the illuminated regulations?\n\nThe Most High replied: Your words are good. As for later generations, unless they are those of luminous emptiness who coalesce spontaneously from the primordial, all are conceived within the primal qi and tainted by the clamor and filth of the world. Their conduct is not purely formed, their natures not single-mindedly refined. Though they may yearn for the profound mysteries, their hearts often turn away from me. In all their actions, they inevitably commit transgressions. Transgressions arise externally, extinguishing life internally. Those who study in this manner—how far do they stray from the true!\n\nIf the Three Offices hold them accountable and their cases lie with the dark bureaus, if their seven generations of ancestors are examined and their sins accumulate upon their persons—those who commit such transgressions, if they awaken to the existence of the illuminated regulations with their systems of correction and punishment, and to the greatness of the sagely transformation that again permits methods of redemption, and apply them according to the statutes, then the time of their perfection will surely draw near.\n\nFor scholars of the Dao who lack these standards, their painstaking contemplation is in vain, and their bitter devotion yields no benefit. Now, therefore, I reveal the *Nine Perfected Threefold Illuminated Regulations* to be transmitted to later disciples who are destined to become perfected.\n\nThe Sagely Sovereigns, the Supreme Ministers and Azure Lads, and the Perfected of the Great Ultimate then withdrew, purified themselves, and journeyed to the Upper Clarity to receive the *Pristine Numinous Great Possession Wondrous Scripture and the Nine Perfected Illuminated Regulations*. They concealed them in golden treasuries and jade coffers, guarded by jade lads and jade maidens—three thousand each—who attended to the numinous texts. Incense wafted through the empty courtyards, flying dragons and venomous beasts, giant serpents a thousand fathoms long, brandished their claws upon the cloud-walls, standing guard at the Jade Pass. Thus did the Ten Heavenly Great Sages and the Perfected Immortals of the Nine Palaces, three times each month, ascend to the Dark Palace to receive the illuminated regulations and pay homage to the numinous texts.\n\nThe Supreme Minister and Azure Lad said: All who possess golden bones and jade bodies, whose names are recorded in the Azure Palace, and who obtain these texts must keep them secret and put them into practice. In this way, the rites of reception harmonize with the supreme canons, the protocols of application align with the true, and the methods of redemption and deliverance dissolve all karmic entanglements. The seven generations of ancestors rejoice, and one’s own person ascends to feast in the Jade Palace.\n\n*The Upper Scroll of the Threefold Statutes of the Nine Perfected Illuminated Regulations of the Dark Capital: The Transmission of Scriptures*\n\nThe first scroll of the Upper Rank of the Dark Capital states: The *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*, the *Precious Scripture of the Feminine One*, and the *Most High Pristine Numinous Great Possession Wondrous Scripture*—the three wondrous chapters and the precious writs of the August Jade Sovereign—are concealed in the Palace of Great Possession above the Nine Heavens, within the Jade Chambers of the Supreme Mystery’s Numinous Terrace. According to the ancient statutes of the August Sovereign of the Highest, these scriptures are transmitted once every ten thousand kalpas. The three true and luminous Dao flourish daily among those who study the perfected.\n\nThe supreme and correct statutes permit three transmissions within seven thousand years. Jade lads and jade maidens, seven thousand each, attend with incense and tend to the numinous texts. According to the statutes governing transmission, one must face the altar and fast for a hundred days, swear an oath with a golden clasp, and assign jade lads and jade maidens in accordance with the statutes of the Four Poles. Those who transmit without following the statutes shall have their sins extend to their seven generations of ancestors, their dark souls condemned to servitude—swallowing fire, eating iron, bearing mountains, and transporting stones to fill the boundless abyss. Their own persons shall suffer the punishment of the wind-blade, their bodies perishing and their forms mutilated, eternally confined to the earthly prisons, never to attain immortality.\n\nThe second scroll of the Upper Rank of the Dark Capital states: For transmitting the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the True Scripture of the Great Cavern* to later disciples, the oath requires ten taels of superior gold, twenty-five catties of bronze, five pairs of golden clasps, one golden fish, one jade dragon, and one tael of green silk to bind the clasps.\n\nFor the *Feminine One*, five taels of superior gold, fifty feet each of five-colored brocade and silk, one catty of incense, and three pairs of golden clasps.\n\nFor the *Most High Pristine Numinous Cavern-True Mysterious Scripture*, two taels of superior gold, one hundred feet of purple-patterned silk, twenty-seven feet of green brocade, five taels of red silk, one catty of incense, and one tael of cinnabar.\n\nThe August Sovereign’s trust and oath must not be deficient; deficiency violates the statutes. If the master transgresses, the jade lads and jade maidens who attend the scriptures shall be returned to their original palaces. Within three years, the master’s body shall suffer the torture of the wind-blade, and the scriptures shall naturally be lost.\n\nThose who receive these teachings yet fail to adhere to the clear statutes shall suffer the loss of their luminous form and endure mutilation. Their seven generations of ancestors and parents shall be consigned to the punishments of the Northern Feng, and for ten thousand kalpas, they shall be reborn into the paths of non-human beings. Let learners be cautious.\n\nThe third chapter of the *Upper Rank of the Mysterious Metropolis* states: All those bearing the golden name *Eastern Florescence* and the jade title *Upper Clarity*, who receive the *Jade Scripture of the Imperial Chapters of the Towering Empyrean*, the *Purple Metamorphosis of the Flaming Radiance of the Pristine and True*, the *Seventy-Four Methods of Upper Clarity Transformation*, the *Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected*, the *Eight Arts of the Hidden Earth of the Cinnabar Landscape’s Daoic Essence*, the *Jade Scripture of Dissolving Form and Transmuting through Flowing Radiance*, and the *Seven Transformations of the Heavenly Dance*—these are all the exalted scriptures of the Nine Heavens’ True Kings, the Primordial Celestial King of Origin, the Most High Celestial Thearch, and the Yellow Elder Lord of the Center. They were received within the Great Void, amid the Nine Mysteries, as the loftiest chapters of Non-Being. All are secretly preserved within the Palace of the Numinous Metropolis of the Great Highest, in the Purple Chambers, governed by the Three Origin Lords, attended by three thousand jade lads and jade maidens.\n\nAt the inception of the Primordial Origin, these scriptures were transmitted once every seven thousand kalpas. After the establishment of the Three Ways and the Rectification of the Dao, transmission was permitted thrice within seven years, and if a worthy recipient appeared within seven hundred years, transmission was also permitted. Transmission requires facing the altar for ninety days of purification, or thirty days, or nine days, and the scriptures are conferred only after a covenant is sworn. Jade lads and jade maidens are assigned in accordance with the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*. Should one transmit these teachings without adhering to the statutes, the sin shall extend to seven generations of ancestors and parents, who shall be consigned to the offices of ghostly servitude, compelled to haul the stones of Mount Meng to fill the River of Eternal Night. For ten thousand kalpas, they shall be reborn into the paths of non-human beings, while the transgressor’s own body shall suffer the torture of the wind-blade, the scriptures shall naturally be lost, and they shall never attain immortality. Let those who transmit be cautious.\n\nThe fourth chapter of the *Upper Rank of the Mysterious Metropolis* states: For the transmission of the *Jade Scripture of the Imperial Chapters*, one must present a golden fish, a jade dragon, thirty-two feet of green silk, and three pairs of golden clasps as oath. For the *Purple Metamorphosis of the Flaming Radiance*, fifty feet each of five-colored brocade, five taels of gold, five catties of aloeswood, one catty of true pearls, one scripture knife, seven golden fish, and seventy feet of crimson-patterned silk as oath. For the *Seventy-Four Methods of Upper Clarity Transformation*, forty feet of green silk, ten taels of superior gold, six pairs of golden clasps, one catty of fine incense, and a golden fish and jade dragon as oath. For the *Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected*, one must follow the statutes and cut off hair as covenant; now, ninety feet of white silk are used to substitute for the covenant, in accordance with the number of the Nine Perfected. One catty of green silk and twenty feet of crimson-patterned silk serve as the oath of the Sun’s Radiance; twenty-four feet of azure silk as the oath of the Moon’s Splendor; and three pairs of golden rings as the pledge of the Eternal Lad’s transformation.\n\nFor the *Eight Arts of the Hidden Earth of the Cinnabar Landscape’s Daoic Essence* and the *Jade Scripture of Dissolving Form and Transmuting through Flowing Radiance*, one must present ten taels of superior gold, one golden fish and one jade dragon each, thirty feet of green silk, and forty feet of purple-patterned silk, along with three pairs of golden rings each. For the *Seven Transformations of the Heavenly Dance*, five taels of superior gold, one catty of incense, and thirty-two feet of green silk as oath. The pledge must be made with sincerity of heart; no deficiency is permitted, for deficiency violates the statutes. The master shall cast the celestial pledge into the mountain retreats or riverine sanctuaries to succor the destitute, while the remainder shall be used to furnish the implements for the scriptures. It must not be dispersed elsewhere. Should the master violate the higher statutes, their jade lads and jade maidens shall be revoked, their lifespan and destiny records diminished, and their names inscribed for return to the Northern Feng. Those who receive these teachings without adhering to the statutes shall lose their souls and spirits, suffer the torture of the wind-blade, and within three years, the scriptures shall naturally be lost; they shall never attain immortality.\n\nThe fifth chapter of the *Upper Rank of the Mysterious Metropolis* states: The *Wisdom of Dispelling Demons*, the *Hidden Book of Jade Clarity*, the *Golden Chapters of the Absolute Mystery of the Soaring Empyrean of the Treasure Cavern*, the *Crimson Writ of the Eight Radiant Mornings of the Purple Phoenix*, the *Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance*, the *Numinous Writ of the Purple Text*, the *Golden Pendants and Jade Girdles*, the *Upper Scripture of the Golden Root*, and the *Orthodox Dharma of the Three Heavens*—these are all the treasured scriptures of the Most High Dao Lord, the Primordial Celestial King of Origin, and the Golden Portal Thearch. They are secretly preserved within the Palace of Jade Clarity, in the Golden Chambers and Purple Portals, guarded by three thousand jade lads and jade maidens, each attending the numinous writs.\n\nAt the inception of the Primordial Origin, these were transmitted once every thousand kalpas. After the establishment of the Three Heavens and the Rectification of the Dao, transmission was permitted thrice within seven hundred years, and if a worthy recipient appeared within a hundred years, one transmission was permitted. Jade lads and jade maidens are assigned in accordance with the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*. Transmission requires facing the altar for ninety days of purification, or thirty days, or nine days. Should one transmit these teachings without adhering to the statutes, the sin shall extend to the seven mysteries and nine generations of ancestors, who shall be eternally consigned to ghostly servitude without release. The transgressor’s own body shall suffer the torture of the wind-blade, die to become a lowly ghost, and never attain immortality.\n\nThe sixth chapter of the *Upper Rank of the Mysterious Metropolis* states: For the transmission of the *Wisdom of Dispelling Demons*, the *Golden Chapters of the Absolute Mystery of the Soaring Empyrean of the Treasure Cavern*, and the *Crimson Writ of the Eight Radiant Mornings of the Purple Phoenix*, one must present ten taels of superior gold, one jade tablet, one golden fish, one jade dragon, and forty feet of purple silk. For the *Upper Scripture of the Golden Root* and the *Numinous Writ of the Purple Text*, five taels of superior gold, one golden slip and one jade tablet each, measuring one foot six inches in length and two inches four fen in width, one golden fish, one jade dragon, one hundred feet of purple silk, and forty feet of green-patterned silk. For the *Orthodox Dharma of the Three Heavens*, forty feet of green silk, forty-three feet of green cloth, and five pairs of golden rings as secret oath; ten taels of superior gold as the pledge to commune with the spirits.\n\nFor the *Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance*, the *Jade Pendants and Golden Girdles*, and the *Hidden Book of Jade Clarity*, one golden fish and one jade dragon each shall serve as the pledge of oath. One must adhere to the statutes without deficiency, for deficiency shall cause the master to lose their jade lads and jade maidens, and their names shall be inscribed for return to the Northern Feng. Those who receive these teachings without adhering to the statutes shall lose their souls and spirits, suffer the torture of the wind-blade, and within three years, the scriptures shall naturally be lost; they shall never attain immortality.\n\nThe Seventh Scroll of the Supreme Works of the Mysterious Capital states:\n\n*The Seven Stars’ Transference of Destiny*, *The White-Feathered and Black-Winged Scripture of Aerial Flight*, *Treading the Celestial Net: The Seven Primes’ Stepping Rite*, *The Supreme Hidden Book*, and *The Numinous Flight of the Six Jia* are all the Dao of ascent into the void of the Supreme Lord of the Great Emperor and the Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. They are the secret chapters of hidden transformation, concealed within the Jade Palace of the Supreme Lord, in the Purple Chamber, where jade lads and jade maidens—three thousand in number—stand guard.\n\nAccording to the statutes, they are transmitted once every seven thousand years. After the establishment of the Three Heavens’ orthodoxy, the interval is reduced to seven hundred years, during which three transmissions may be granted. If a worthy recipient appears within a hundred years, the transmission may proceed. The transmission requires a ninety-day or thirty-day purification fast, after which jade lads and jade maidens are bestowed, in accordance with *The Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*. Those who transmit without adherence to the statutes shall incur guilt extending to their sevenfold mysterious ancestors and seven generations of forebears, condemning them to eternal servitude as ghosts in the Northern Feng, enduring the ten torments and eight calamities. Their own bodies shall suffer the torture of the wind-blade, their souls shall be cast into the Dark Abyss, and they shall never attain immortality.\n\nThe Eighth Scroll of the Supreme Works of the Mysterious Capital states:\n\nFor the transmission of *The Seven Stars’ Transference of Destiny*, forty-one feet of green cloth, seventy feet of crimson silk, ninety feet of phoenix-patterned gauze, and one pair of golden buttons shall be offered. For *The White-Feathered Scripture*, two taels of gold, thirty-two feet of green silk, shall replace the oath of cutting hair and smearing blood. For *Treading the Celestial Net*, thirty feet of brocade, one golden fish, and one jade dragon shall serve as the pledge. For *The Supreme Hidden Book*, the oath shall be sworn with a golden fish and jade dragon. For *The Numinous Flight of the Six Jia*, sixty feet of plain silk, six pairs of golden rings, and six taels of green silk thread shall be presented.\n\nThe celestial statutes demand sincerity as the essence of the heart; no deficiency is permitted, for deficiency violates the mysterious statutes. The master shall revoke their jade lads and jade maidens, erase their names from the Azure Register and Jade Roll, and return them to the Northern Feng. Those who receive these teachings without adhering to the statutes shall lose their essence and spirit, suffer the punishment of the wind-blade, and within three years, the scriptures shall naturally be lost; they shall never attain immortality.\n\nThe Ninth Scroll of the Supreme Works of the Mysterious Capital states:\n\nAll the talismans of the various Perfected Ones—*The Divine Resonance of the Square Yard*, *The Expansive Seven Primes*, *The Hidden Writings of the Eight Heavens*, *The Flowing Gold and Fire Bell*, *The Golden Spirit and Tiger Talisman*, *The Demon-Dispelling Branches and Trunks of the Night-Illuminating Divine Candle*, *The Eight Arts of Hidden Retreat: The Purple Clarity Jade Talisman*, *The Upper Talismans of the Six Jia from the Five Registers of the Cavernous Mystery*, *The Secret Writings of the Five Agents*, and *The Jade Regulations of the Mysterious Capital*—number six hundred in total. The Supreme Lord has inscribed their texts within the ancient scriptures to serve as the foundation for practice.\n\nThe statutes of transmission and oaths must fully adhere to the scriptural regulations. Any deficiency in transmission incurs the same punishment as described in the preceding scrolls. Possessing scriptures without talismans invites harm from celestial demons; possessing talismans without scriptures renders thoughts and invocations ineffectual, and the divine Perfected shall not descend. The statutes decree that neither may be practiced in isolation; those who do so shall incur the same punishment. Both scriptures and talismans originate from the qi of spontaneity and the intent of the Void and Nonexistence; thus, they cannot be cultivated separately. Without adherence to the statutes, the Dao shall never be attained.\n\n---\n\n**The Middle Scrolls of the Statutes of the Nine Perfected Ones of the Mysterious Capital: Admonitions on Offenses**\n\nThe First Scroll of the Middle Works of the Mysterious Capital states:\n\nAmong later disciples, those whose seven generations of ancestors or descendants have committed murder, robbery, plunder, treachery, usurpation, or lewdness; whose nine clans have engaged in collusion or plotted rebellion against the Dao—such transgressions are especially grave, their grievances and retributions accumulating in the Nine Yin, beyond absolution by pardon. Their descendants, burdened by residual calamity, may not partake in the true scriptures or secretly receive the sacred texts.\n\nIf one possesses a sincere resolve and aspires to self-discipline, they must first confess to their sevenfold mysterious ancestors, perform meritorious deeds, liberate imprisoned souls, and expose themselves beneath the Three Luminaries, loosening their hair and prostrating in repentance for three years without wearying. They must personally present a substantial pledge to the Nine Rivers to redeem their past transgressions. Only then may they observe a hundred-day purification fast and receive the sacred scriptures to proceed with their practice.\n\nThose who bear such sins yet fail to first punish and reproach themselves, or to confess their offenses to the Heavenly Treasures before receiving the teachings, shall—both master and disciple—suffer the torture of the wind-blade. Their sevenfold mysterious ancestors shall be eternally confined to the Dark Abyss, bearing stones and mountains for ten thousand kalpas without release, their bodies perishing and their scriptures lost. Be vigilant and prudent.\n\nThe Second Scroll of the Middle Works of the Mysterious Capital states:\n\nThose who wish to cultivate the supreme Dao yet bear grave sins—having taken lives with their own hands, perpetrated cruelty and oppression, slaughtered living beings, plundered the common folk, schemed in treachery, colluded with their nine clans, slandered the worthy and capable, or rebelled against their masters—such unforgivable offenses, accumulated in the Nine Yin, may not partake in the wondrous teachings or practice the scriptures.\n\nIf one possesses a sincere resolve, they must confess their initial transgressions, perform meritorious deeds, expose themselves beneath the Three Luminaries, loosen their hair and prostrate in repentance for three years, present a pledge to the river to atone for their faults, and liberate their sevenfold mysterious ancestors, thereby distinguishing themselves in the Three Realms. Only then may they observe a hundred-day purification fast and receive the sacred scriptures to proceed with their practice.\n\nThose who bear such sins yet fail to first confess, reproach themselves, or perform penance before receiving the scriptures shall—both master and disciple—suffer the torture of the wind-blade, endure the ten torments and eight calamities of the soul, and be cast into the Dark Springs. Their scriptures shall naturally be lost, and their seven generations of ancestors and parents shall be eternally bound to the Dark Paths, never to be released for ten thousand kalpas. Disciples, be cautious.\n\nThe Third Scroll of the Middle Works of the Mysterious Capital states:\n\nThose who receive the Three Wonders’ sacred texts or the secret scriptures of the Supreme Clarity, yet carelessly reveal their catalogues, display their contents to the unworthy, or profane the mysteries by disdaining the sacred chapters—if such offenses occur once to ten times, they shall be penalized with three years of severed merit and suspended practice, after which they may resume purification and cultivation. For offenses exceeding this, guilt shall accumulate in the Nine Yin, extending to their sevenfold ancestors, who shall be condemned to servitude in the Three Paths, bearing stones and mountains, enduring the ten torments and eight calamities. After ten thousand kalpas, they may return, but shall be reborn into the realm of the inhuman. Their own bodies shall suffer the torture of the wind-blade, lose their sight, and be maimed in form, dying as lowly ghosts. They shall never attain immortality. Those who transmit these teachings must be vigilant.\n\n**The Fourth Scroll of the Middle Grade of the Mystic Capital states:** All disciples who receive the precious scriptures of the Supreme Clarity or the Three Wondrous Treasure Texts must not weep, approach corpses, or encounter blood and filth. For offenses ranging from one to ten, they shall be penalized with one year of severed merit and suspended practice, after which they may follow the statutes to atone, expiate their sins in the Great Yin, and resume purification and cultivation. For offenses exceeding this up to twenty-four, their lifespan shall be diminished, and their Jade Boys and Jade Maidens shall return to their original palaces. Within three years, they shall lose the scriptures and forfeit their lives, while their sevenfold ancestors shall be consigned to eternal ghostly servitude, never to be released for ten thousand kalpas. Disciples, be vigilant.\n\n**The Fifth Scroll of the Middle Grade of the Mystic Capital states:** All disciples who receive the precious scriptures of the Supreme Clarity or the Three Caverns’ secret texts must not approach women or enter defiled or solitary places, for these pollute the true qi.

Their sevenfold ancestors shall suffer torment. Disciples, be vigilant.\n\n**The Sixth Scroll of the Middle Grade of the Mystic Capital states:** All disciples who receive the precious scriptures of the Supreme Clarity or the Three Caverns’ secret texts yet harbor malicious intent, commit violent acts with their hands, kill living beings, engage in brigandage, rape, or treachery, ( ) envy the worthy and resent the capable, slander those of shared qi, or assault and defame their scripture masters—for offenses ranging from one to ten, they shall be permitted to atone by pledging faith, making amends to the Nine Yin, expiating their sins in the Five Peaks, and enduring ten years of severed merit and suspended practice. They may then resume purification and cultivation of what they have received. For offenses exceeding five up to twenty-four, the Four Administrations shall execute them, seize their souls, and consign them to the Northern Feng. Their sevenfold ancestors shall be condemned to servitude, and after ten thousand kalpas, they may return, but shall be reborn into the realm of the inhuman.

Disciples, be vigilant.\n\n**The Seventh Scroll of the Middle Grade of the Mystic Capital states:** All disciples who receive the precious scriptures of the Supreme Clarity or the Three Caverns’ secret texts must not urinate facing north, consume the five pungent vegetables or the flesh of the six livestock, drink wine to excess, jest about the Dao or slight its laws, or harbor doubts and distractions.

Within five years, they shall lose the scriptures and perish. Disciples, be vigilant.\n\n**The Eighth Scroll of the Middle Grade of the Mystic Capital states:** All disciples who receive the precious scriptures of the Supreme Clarity or the Three Caverns’ secret texts must, in accordance with the statutes, present their pledge and report to their master to perform purification before receiving the scriptures. They must not rashly open the sacred texts without first making a vow. If they obtain the scriptures from ordinary people and then take them as their master, these shall have been bestowed by unseen agents. They must not lightly transcribe or alter the sacred texts, interpret them by their own judgment, corrupt the ancient names and sounds, or devise their own methods. The Four Administrations shall censure them, and their sins shall be recorded in the Nine Yin. For offenses ranging from one to three, they shall endure three years of severed merit and suspended practice, atone according to the statutes, present their pledge to the Nine Rivers, and complete thirty days of purification before resuming cultivation. For offenses exceeding this up to twenty-four, their Jade Boys and Jade Maidens shall each return to their original palaces, their lifespan shall be diminished, their bodies shall be consigned to the ghostly officials, and their sevenfold ancestors shall suffer eternal ghostly servitude. After ten thousand kalpas, they may return, but shall be reborn into the realm of the inhuman. Disciples, be vigilant.\n\n**The Ninth Scroll of the Middle Grade of the Mystic Capital states:** All who receive the precious scriptures of the Supreme Clarity or the Three Caverns’ wondrous texts must prepare a separate chamber with a high bed, four feet and four inches in height and five feet in width, to invite the Three Caverns’ precious scriptures. They shall light lamps, burn incense, and perform morning and evening rites and vows, always making offerings. They must not allow those of impure qi, those who have encountered defilement, or women to enter the chamber, lest they offend the divine perfected. These are the statutes observed in the world. Those who receive the scriptures must not wear clothing, footwear, or engage in improper associations; in rest, sleep, sitting, and rising, they must differ from ordinary beings. For offenses ranging from one to twenty-four, they shall be penalized with one year of severed merit and suspended practice, after which they may resume purification and cultivation. For offenses exceeding this, they shall be seized by the Four Administrations, their transgressions reported to the Jade Clarity, and their names returned to Fengdu. Within seven years, they shall perish, lose the scriptures, and their sevenfold ancestors shall suffer torment. Disciples, be vigilant.\n\n**The Lower Grade of the Mystic Capital’s Nine Perfected Bright Statutes: Scroll on Expiating Sins**\n\n**The First Scroll of the Lower Grade of the Mystic Capital states:** For all later disciples whose sevenfold ancestors or parents committed in their lifetimes the sins described in the first scrolls of the Upper and Middle Grades of the Mystic Capital—whose punishments are especially severe, binding them to the Nine Yin, with their sevenfold ancestors becoming vengeful adversaries, suffering eternal torment in the dark prisons, their misfortunes extending to their descendants, and their unseen punishments never remitted—they must expose themselves beneath the Great Yin, loosen their hair, kowtow, and confess their sins to the Nine Yin for three years. At the end of the year, they shall present nine pairs of gold rings, one tael of green silk, and one golden figurine, casting them into the mouth of the Three Rivers to redeem the sins of their sevenfold ancestors and deliver their souls from the dark prisons. The statute requires a peachwood tablet inscribed in red with five lines, recording:\n\n*On such-and-such a day, month, and year, so-and-so, Wang of such-and-such a county, village, and district, along with his sevenfold ancestors, parents, and himself, having committed the sins described in the first scrolls of the Upper and Middle Grades of the Mystic Capital, whose sins are bound to the Nine Yin, now respectfully follows the statutes, presenting nine pairs of gold rings, one tael of green silk, and one golden figurine to redeem the cruel adversities of the unseen souls. This document is cast to report to the Water Officials, to absolve and deliver them, that their sins may be extinguished in the Three Offices and their souls ascend to the Nine Heavens.*\n\nWhen this is complete, the green silk shall be used to bind the objects and the tablet, which shall then be sunk with a green stone. At the moment of sinking, facing north, they shall raise their heads and pray, saying:\n\nThe Nine Lords of the Great Yin govern the spirit-officials. Now I, Jia, make this declaration, reporting to the Source of Rivers, casting this missive into the Nine Springs, to deliver my sevenfold ancestors, to dissolve their grievous adversities, and that my own person may ascend as an immortal.\n\nWhen this is done, the torments of the seven ancestors shall thus be released and dispersed, allowing them to depart the dark palace and ascend to the Hall of Blessings. My own person shall then be permitted to study the precious scriptures, and after nine years, true numina shall descend in form, ascending together with the gods.\n\nThe Mystic Statutes are most severe—one must not transgress again.\n\nThe second scroll of the Lower Grade of the Mystic Capital states: Those who wish to cultivate the Dao of the Supreme Perfection, if they have previously committed sins described in the second scrolls of the Upper and Middle Grades, whose torments are bound and sins entwined in the Nine Yin, obstructing the netherworld and extending to their seven ancestors, subjecting their suffering souls to relentless interrogation—all such must first, beneath the Great Yin, face north with unbound hair, kowtow, and confess their sins to the Three Luminaries, fulfilling three years of penance.\n\nWhen the year is complete, they shall present one catty of true pearls, one inscribed blade, one tael of green silk, and one golden figurine, casting them into the confluence of the Three Rivers to redeem their own cruel and rebellious transgressions, dissolving the knots in the Three Offices and delivering their seven ancestors. The statute requires a vermilion inscription on a one-chi length of green silk, recording as follows:\n\nOn such-and-such a year, month, and day of the new moon, so-and-so of such-and-such prefecture, county, village, and hamlet, Wang Jia, aged so many years, having no prior witness to his conduct, has violated the Mystic Statutes, committing primordial transgressions and incurring the sins of the second scrolls of the Upper and Middle Grades of the Mystic Capital, whose sins are bound to the Great Yin. Now, in accordance with the statutes, he presents one golden figurine, one catty of true pearls, and one inscribed blade to redeem his own foul and vile sins. This document is cast to report and command, submitting to the numinous, to absolve and deliver himself, that his sins may be extinguished in the Nine Rivers and his person attain longevity.\n\nWhen this is done, the green silk shall be used to bind the objects and the tablet, which shall then be sunk with a green stone. At the moment of sinking, facing north, they shall kowtow and pray, saying:\n\nAbove are the Nine Lords of the Great Yin who govern and execute. Now I, Jia, make this declaration, reporting to the Source of Rivers, to redeem sins and dissolve knots, to deliver from the Nine Calamities. May the grievous souls and their adversaries each return to their natural state, that misfortune may cease and the study of immortality proceed, and my own person ascend.\n\nWhen this is complete, the knots of the Nine Yin shall thus be untied, and the grievous souls shall return to their natural state. They may then study and receive the scriptures of the Supreme Clarity. After nine years without fail, true numina shall descend in form, uniting with the gods in obscurity.\n\nThe Mystic Statutes are most severe—one must not transgress again.\n\nThe third scroll of the Lower Grade of the Mystic Capital states: Those who study the precious scriptures of the Supreme Clarity and the statutes of the Cavernous Mystery, if they have committed sins described in the third scrolls of the Upper and Middle Grades, whose torments are bound to the Great Yang and held by the Four Offices, whose transgressions are reported to the Jade Clarity—those who have committed such offenses must sever their merits and restrain themselves, enter the chamber to burn incense, kowtow, and confess their sins. Facing north, they shall strike their teeth ten times and pray, saying:\n\nO profound and distant Mystic Darkness, rarely heard of in the lower world, lightly divulging the precious truth harms the honor of the Celestial Emperor. I have brought this guilt upon myself, humbly submitting at the numinous gate. I beseech the Most High to graciously bestow Mystic Favor, descending with numinous resonance, awakening the natural.\n\nWhen this is done, they shall kowtow nine times. After three years of such confession, they shall then purify themselves for thirty days, thereby dissolving the Three Offices, releasing the torments of the Nine Yin, and resuming their cultivation of the precious and secret scriptures. Through steadfast devotion, they may attain flight as immortals.\n\nThe Mystic Statutes are most severe—one must not transgress again.\n\nThe fourth scroll of the Lower Grade of the Mystic Capital states: Those who cultivate the Dao of the Supreme Perfection, if they have committed sins described in the fourth scrolls of the Upper and Middle Grades, whose sins are bound to the Nine Yin and whose torments are suspended in the Jade Clarity—such offenders must, in the central courtyard at midnight, light thirty-two lamps to cleanse the defiled qi, purifying both inner and outer. They shall enter the chamber to burn incense, face north, kowtow, and confess their transgressions, striking their teeth thirty-six times and praying:\n\nThe world’s fortunes intersect with decay; flying corpses cast shadows, defiled qi swirls, clashing with the true. Having violated the statutes and sincerity, I have entered the realm of sin. I redeem myself through ritual confession, washing away with bright lamps. May misfortune disperse in the Three Clarities, and blessings fill my prosperity. May the Dao’s shade flow gracefully, its blessings boundless.\n\nWhen this is done, they shall kowtow nine more times. After one year of such practice, they shall then purify themselves for thirty days before resuming their cultivation, carefully observing the statutes, diligently inscribing the true, and after nine years, attaining ascension at dawn.\n\nThe fifth scroll of the Lower Grade of the Mystic Capital states: Those who cultivate the Dao of the Supreme Perfection, if they have committed sins described in the fifth scrolls of the Upper and Middle Grades, whose sins are bound to the Great Yin and whose torments are suspended in the Azure Palace—such offenders must prepare fragrant water for bathing, present oil in the central courtyard, and light twenty-four lamps for ninety days. They shall enter the chamber, face north, kowtow nine times, confess their transgressions, and strike their teeth twenty-four times, praying:\n\nHeaven and Earth, Qian and Kun, the two images intermingle; yin qi blends with the true, while defiled qi fills all. The spirit is lost, the treasure harmed, the Dharma’s countenance diminished. I reverently light bright lamps to illuminate the Mystic Palace. May misfortune vanish in the Nine Yin, and blessings return to the ancestral lineage.\n\nWhen the ninety days are complete, they shall retreat for twenty-four days of purification before resuming their cultivation of the true Dharma. In every petition, they must be cautious, clearly adhering to the statutes, and may attain union with the Mystic Perfection, ascending as immortals in form.\n\nThe Mystic Statutes are most severe—one must not transgress again.\n\nThe sixth scroll of the Lower Grade of the Mystic Capital states: Those who cultivate the Dao of the Supreme Perfection, if they have committed sins described in the sixth scrolls of the Upper and Middle Grades—whose offenses are most grave, held by the Four Offices, whose torments are bound to the Nine Yin and whose adversaries reside in the dark palace—such offenders must, beneath the Great Yin, with unbound hair and kowtowing, confess to the Jade Clarity and deliver themselves from the Great Yin. In accordance with the statutes, they shall distribute their private treasures to beg among the poor, preparing food according to their means to relieve the hungry for ten years.\n\nEntering the chamber, one kowtows in self-reproach, facing north and clicking the teeth nine times. Looking up, one prays:\n\n\"Vast is Heaven, broad is Earth, the Nine Origins unfold in boundless expanse. My body treads the gate of calamity, my offenses hang heavy in the Jade Capital. Enmeshed in net and snare, I stand amidst the clouded precincts of the Mystic Cavern. Scattering treasures to absolve my sins, I offer sustenance to the destitute. My transgressions dissolve in the Great Yin, blessings arise in ten directions. Casting off the old, I embrace the new—may my ascent flourish without end.\"\n\nThis done, one kowtows nine more times to conclude. This is the supreme method of absolution, recorded in the orthodox statutes. Practiced thus for ten years, all lingering offenses and torment in the Great Yin shall be dispelled. Upon completing the year of self-reproach and almsgiving, one observes a hundred-day retreat before resuming cultivation. Examine the self, guard the statutes, and never transgress again.\n\nThe seventh scroll of the Lower Grade of the Mystic Capital states: Those who study the Dao of the Supreme Perfection, if they have committed sins described in the seventh scrolls of the Upper and Middle Grades—whose offenses fill the Upper Clarity—shall offer ten pounds of fine incense to fellow practitioners in ten gatherings, absolving one year of transgressions. Entering the chamber, one burns incense, faces east, and kowtows nine times, confessing to the Supreme Perfection. Clicking the teeth nine times, one looks up and prays:\n\n\"The five qi interweave, yet the Supreme Perfection remains incomplete. My body is tainted with defiled qi, offending the gates of the Mystic Cavern. I harm the treasuries and sever my destiny, unsettling the Three Passes. Violating statutes and precepts, my sins prolong their own torment. With reverent penance, I report to the Imperial Honored Ones, beseeching that I may now proclaim my repentance. Departing the lower realms, I ascend to become a Heavenly Immortal.\"\n\nThis done, one continues thus for a year. Upon its completion, one observes a twenty-four-day retreat before resuming the received practices, thereby attaining the descent of the true essence.\n\nThe gravity of the sacred statutes forbids repeated transgressions. The *Eighth Scroll of the Lower Grade* of the *Mystic Capital* states: Those who study the Dao of the Supreme Perfection and commit sins listed under the eighth entry of the upper or middle grades shall be seized by the supervisory authorities and bound for judgment before the Three Clarities. The offender must burn a *hu* of pure oil as a lamp in the central courtyard, adding more as needed until the oil is exhausted. Additionally, they shall offer ten *jin* of fine incense to a master who holds the scriptures, thereby expiating their transgressions for three years. Entering the chamber, they burn incense, face north, and kowtow nine times, confessing their offenses. Clicking the teeth twelve times, they look up and pray:\n\n\"The Heavenly Perfections are lofty and distant, their mystic radiance descending in clarity. Relying on past blessings, I have beheld the true scriptures, yet failing to grasp the profound statutes, I have slighted the celestial numina. Violating the true and transgressing the precepts, I sink my person into darkness. With rigorous self-reproach, I report to the Supreme Clarity. Henceforth, I shall purify my former form, uphold the mystic truth, and align with the Dao.\"\n\nThis done, upon the completion of three years, one observes a ninety-day retreat. If already initiated by a master, one may resume practice; if not, one must present offerings and seek the master’s transmission to study the scriptures lawfully, thereby attaining ascension.\n\nThe sacred statutes are especially weighty—transgress them not again.\n\nThe *Ninth Scroll of the Lower Grade* of the *Mystic Capital* states: Those who cultivate the Dao of the Supreme Perfection and commit sins listed under the ninth entry of the upper or middle grades shall have their offenses bound to the Great Yin and suspended for judgment before the Jade Clarity. The offender must kindle seven lamps before the hall, enter the chamber, kowtow, and confess their sins before the scriptures. Clicking the teeth twenty-four times, they look up and pray:\n\n\"The jade radiance descends in splendor, illuminating the Supreme Clarity. My conduct has been irreverent, offending the precious scriptures. I fear the Four Administrations will list my sins before the Purple Court. With solemn reverence, I beseech the true numina to condescend and descend, extinguishing my offenses and dissolving my form. I pledge to uphold the profound statutes and eternally preserve my primordial integrity.\"\n\nThis done, one continues thus for a year, then observes a twenty-four-day retreat before resuming the received practices.\n\nThe sacred statutes are especially weighty—one must be vigilant and avoid further transgression.\n\nThe *Nine Perfected Statutes of the Great Mystery*, comprising three grades and twenty-seven clauses, originate from the Palace of the Numinous Capital, treasured and concealed by the Supreme Lord, never disseminated to the world below. Here, the essential methods are excerpted and transmitted to later sages to elucidate the Three Marvels, as recorded in the *Scripture of the Great Primordial Numinous Simplicity*. Those whose bones align with immortality may employ this text to expiate sins, resolve grievances, unbind knots, and dissolve obstructions. The Seven Mysteries shall vanish, and within three years, the true numina will manifest, uniting with the practitioner to ascend the Nine Heavens together. To recklessly divulge the sacred statutes incurs the same punishment as the offenses described herein. They must be treasured in secrecy and practiced discreetly.\n\nThe *Nine Perfected Scrolls of the Mystic Capital* state: The transmission of scriptural titles listed in the three grades of the Nine Perfected Statutes occurred when the Later Sage Thearch first received the scriptures from the Supreme Dao Lord. Upon bestowing the scriptures, the Supreme Lord issued the three grades of luminous statutes to assist the Three Treasures, the marvelous texts, and the scriptures of the Supreme Perfection. The statutes governing their application, along with the thirty-one scrolls, independent matters, and ritual protocols of the various scriptures, are all contained within the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*. The three grades of the Nine Perfected Statutes, with their three primordial upper scrolls, are enshrined in the palaces of the Nine Thearchs. The Four Poles, governed by the officials of the Four Administrations, oversee the prohibitions and penalties for all transgressions.\n\nThe *Luminous Statutes of the Supreme Perfection*, received by the Supreme Thearch from the Celestial King of Primordial Beginning, contain the celestial chapters and ritual protocols of the Supreme Perfection. Their methods are concealed above the Nine Heavens in the hall of the Supreme Thearch, their admonitions stored in the palaces of the Supreme Perfection, never circulated in the world. The *Luminous Statutes of the Nine Perfected* restrain later learners, while the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles* govern the four directions. Their purport is profound and subtle, existing without golden characters or jade inscriptions, unknown and unheard. Those who obtain these scrolls need not study to achieve perfection.\n\nThe statutes exist to restrain transgressions; seeing them, one must reform. To reform is to incur no deficit before Heaven and Earth; to incur no deficit is to align with spontaneity. Aligning with spontaneity enables one to ascend and supplement the ranks of the true immortals. Without the statutes, the path to immortality recedes ever further.\n\nThe *Nine Perfected Scrolls of the Mystic Capital* state: Those of utmost resolve, whose names enter the Mystic Palace and who wish to receive the luminous statutes alone to understand the celestial prohibitions before receiving the scriptures, may do so if their bones align with the Dao. Alternatively, they may first pledge an oath before transmission. The ritual implements and offerings for the oath must conform to the quantities prescribed in the *Scriptures of the Three Marvels*, as must the duration of the term. This knowledge must not be lightly divulged; to transmit it to unworthy recipients, reveal the profound texts, or violate the statutes’ intent is to consign oneself to the offices of the dead, where one’s seven ancestors and parents shall tread upon mountains of blades and forests of swords, never to be redeemed for ten thousand kalpas. Those who outwardly profess devotion but do not adhere to the statutes incur the same punishment as the offenses described therein. The prohibitions herein apply to both parties—practitioners, beware.\n\nThe *Nine Perfected Scrolls of the Mystic Capital* state: Those who receive the supreme methods yet do not uphold the luminous statutes, thereby slighting the celestial prohibitions, shall implicate their seven ancestors and themselves in punishment. Having acknowledged their errors and rigorously atoned, if they resume their practices only to transgress again, their punishment shall double. Such individuals are unaligned in bone and destiny, their forms opposed to the true. Their souls shall dwell among ghosts, and they may never again repent or resume the true scriptures. I now elucidate these statutes to awaken the unawakened. Having known them, to transgress again—what purpose does it serve? Practitioners, be vigilant.\n\n*Hymn of Praise by the Supreme Thearch*\n\nAmidst the unchanging primordial dawn, the faintest morning mist disperses.\nIn the great stillness atop the empty mystery, the Two Modes divide in clarity.\nCongealing essence to embrace the dark womb, coalescing transformation to conceive the numinous vision.\nHolding the true within to nurture the spirit, in a flash the hidden dawn unfolds.\nAt last awakening to the brevity of mortal years, one returns to commune with the Celestial Han.\nWith rustling steps one roams the void, circling to pay homage to the Jade Sovereign.\nBowing deeply to return to the Great Nothingness, riding the wind to scatter sacred incense.\nLooking up and down within the imperial hall, drifting and soaring on the empty breeze.\nExquisite chants resound in wondrous tones, intoning the hymns of the Supreme Perfected.\nFlowing boundlessly through the Four Great Realms, the Ten Heavens stretch immeasurably.\nFrom the Tower of Lang, the dark night is dispelled;

in desolate solitude, one chants the feathered texts.\nVast mindfulness knows no limit; all things abound in felicity.\n\n*Heavenly Thearch’s Hymn*\n\nThe Supreme Dao is born from silence; the dark resonance seeks its echoing sound.\nThe Three Perfected are never without unity, yet the transformations of qi follow distinct principles.\nWithin the shadowless turning of the Dharma-wheel, the ethereal vision flows in purity.\nThe congealed verses require no thought;

divine songs resound in the great void.\nThe form responds in the court of utmost stillness; through contemplation, the subtle and imperceptible commune.\nCloud-light veils the morning glow; the suspended radiance shades the jade chamber.\nThe dark dragon awaits no chariot; with rustling steps, one soars the void.\nHand plucking the seven-jeweled blossoms, the divine wind scatters wondrous fragrance.\nExquisite chants arise from the hidden heart; resplendent, they unfold the jade verses.\nThe myriad qi merge into primordial unity, all returning to the Three Mysteries’ beam.\nRiding the heavens, one does not deem them high; gazing afar, the Nine Mysteries stretch boundlessly.\nFlapping wings, one yearns for the dark reins; longing to ascend, one admires the cloudy empyrean.\nAccumulating mindfulness to invoke divine resonance, one hopes to commune with the Jade Perfected.\nDim and bright, the Celestial Han clears; drifting and floating, the radiant clouds return.\nThe Three Perfected soar into the void, guiding the reins swiftly toward the Purple Tenuity.\nWith luminous chants, they deliver the later-born; all are enabled to ride the radiance in flight.\nDelivering from the Three Paths’ hardships, the Nine Mysteries escape sorrow and lament.\n\n*Supreme Tenuity Heavenly Thearch’s Hymn*\n\nThe Supreme Perfected is born from the hollow vastness; the jeweled gauze illumines the jeweled terrace.\nCircling to pay homage in the dark capital, the host of immortals sings subtle verses.\nTurning within the traceless, the empty songs harmonize with the hidden tryst.\nDelivering the self to ascend and be born in heaven, in recitation, one accumulates the foundation of blessings.\nUrging the reins toward the Terrace of Great Radiance, from time to time one feasts upon the radiant clouds.\nDrifting and floating without bounds, one leaves suffering to enter the dark gate.\nThe mind at ease, the Dao also flows unimpeded; the cinnabar heart and the will are also distinct.\nAccumulating study with each passing day, one chants one’s pristine divine texts.\nThe Eight Radiant chariots traverse the heavens; the flying empyrean luxuriates in dark numinosity.\nThe pristine canopy rides the wind in return; in desolate vastness, one enters the Purple Clarity.\nExquisite praises of the myriad perfected hymns—how crystalline the jade echoes ring!\nUnbinding the registers of the Nine Yin, delivering the self to return to the Southern Court.\nFelicity flows universally to all;

the wondrous essence captivates the heart.\nThe dark chants sow the fields of blessings; the boundless mind delivers without limit.\n\n*Later Sage, Golden Portal Thearch’s Hymn*\n\nVast and boundless, the Primordial Heaven of the Origin; the Three Images merge into the dark unity.\nWith rustling steps, the true Dao flourishes; vast and expansive, the Great Vehicle soars.\nThe Six Qi return to the true court, all converging in the Mud-Pill Chamber.\nEntering and exiting, one roams the imperial palace; flowing essence illumines the sun and clouds.\nCirculating and returning to the Celestial Han, in profound stillness, one rides the dark seven.\nThe circular splendor reflects the luminous pearl; the Two Radiant Ones face the true light.\nThe numinous glow initiates the northern assembly; the dark image intermingles with Fusang.\nIn hidden deliverance, they seek one another; the yin flourishes, illuminating the Eight Directions.\nIf one can consume this essence, one shall long uphold the dark net.\nPlaying amidst the Nine Mysteries’ terraces, one rests at ease in the Western Feathered Mound.\nDivine beasts sing in the jeweled hall; flying phoenixes intermingle in flight.\nThe void gives birth to natural chants; the perfected beings sing in harmonious rhythm.\nTransforming the self in the court of kalpas’ blades, through fragrant incense, one commands the pure song.\nEstablishing merit to erect the fields of blessings, delivering the self to ascend the net.\nThe Seven Mysteries disperse from the dark palace, emerging without hindrance.\nWith flying steps, one treads the empyrean ridge;

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Scripture of Original Cinnabar of the Dao Lord of the Cavern of Perfection**\n\n**Transmission of the Great Youthful Lord**\n\nThe Three Venerable Lords—the Lord of the Grand Thearch, the Lord of the Supreme Heavenly Thearch, and the Lord of the Grand Tenuity Heavenly Thearch—each formerly received the *Supreme Scripture of Original Cinnabar* from the Supreme Dao Lord. Through its practice and cultivation, they attained the Dao, ascending to supplement the authenticity of emperors and kings. On the day of their ascent into the empyrean, the Lord of the Grand Thearch transmitted the true scripture to the Queen Mother of the West; the Lord of the Supreme Heavenly Thearch transmitted it to the Lord of the Upper Prime of the Southern Culmen; and the Lord of the Grand Tenuity Heavenly Thearch transmitted the true scripture to the Sacred Lord of the Golden Portal. The Sacred Lord of the Golden Portal then transmitted the true scripture to the Prime Minister, the Youthful Lord of Azure Lads, who in turn transmitted it to Master Juan.\n\nThis scripture is the *Upper Chapter of the Primordial Numinous*, a Dao of sublime mystery beyond the reach of middling immortals. Unless one’s name is inscribed upon vermilion tablets in green characters of the Great Ultimate, the *Supreme Scripture of Original Cinnabar* will not be encountered or perceived.\n\nIf a Daoist fully cultivates the *Three True Grades of the Supreme*, their rank shall be that of the supreme duke and chief minister above emperors and kings. Should their reception be partial and their understanding of the Dao limited, their station shall be as a king of the lesser numinous palaces, a minister of the divine continent, or a grand master of the middle or lower grades of the Great Ultimate. Yet even they may ride dragons and drive clouds, soaring through the void, escorted by divine officials and scattering their radiance to the eight directions.\n\nSubtle and profoundly mysterious, it must not be lightly disclosed. The catalog of graded scriptures is concealed within the *Eight Primordial Chapters of the Supreme Hidden Writ*, subject to the constraints of reverent restraint. One must cultivate in seclusion and devotion, for the more earnest one’s resolve, the more swiftly the true person’s form shall gradually manifest.\n\nWithout your master’s sanction, do not speak of this to others.\n\nIf you hear the sound of flutes or horns in your ears, it is an auspicious omen of noble fortune. If you hear cries, wails, or shouts, it is an inauspicious omen of base misfortune. If you perceive foul *qi*, it foretells defiling or impure events—such is the verification of malodorous *qi*. Therefore, bathe anew, burn incense, and sweep your chamber in response, for this is the Lord Emperor’s earnest admonition to humankind.\n\nIf you perceive fragrant *qi*, it signifies that divine officials and numinous beings are at your side, observing your conduct. At such times, perform good deeds, practice virtue and kindness, relieve the destitute, accumulate hidden merit, and extend benevolence. The divine officials and numinous beings shall then report your deeds to the Supreme, revealing your virtue or its lack.\n\nThe subtleties of the Dao must not be overlooked, for all such signs are of this nature. If you perceive fragrant *qi*, do not disclose it to others unless they are your master. If you perceive foul *qi*, you should confess it to clarify your transgressions and the impropriety of your defilement.\n\nIf you smell the scent of blood or unexpectedly see pools of blood, it portends military calamity. Immediately retreat into seclusion among mortals, entreat the Three Primordial Lords of the Three Origins for instruction, and observe a three-month retreat in purification—thus may disaster be averted. These are the Lord Emperor’s revelations of fortune and misfortune, meant to inspire caution regarding blessings and woes.\n\nUpon witnessing inauspicious omens, practice hidden virtue, extend kindness to save others, perform deeds beyond the capacity of ordinary people, and walk paths others cannot tread—only then may you escape the fate of certain death. Take heed and do not cling to convention.\n\nThree *fen* inward from the space between the eyebrows lies the *Guardian Inch of the Twin Fields*; one *cun* inward lies the *Hall of Luminosity*; two *cun* inward lies the *Cavern Chamber*; three *cun* inward lies the *Cinnabar Field*; four *cun* inward lies the *Flowing Pearl Palace*; and five *cun* inward lies the *Palace of the Jade Emperor*.\n\nFor all methods of cultivation of the upper practices, first strike the celestial drum, cover your ears with your hands, and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"The Red Child dwells within the palace,\nThe Nine Perfected abide in the chamber.\nHearken to the divine command,\nEver vigilant against misfortune.\nThe Great One’s flowing fire\nExtinguishes ten thousand calamities.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, clap your hands over your ears seven times. If you feel warmth in your face, it is a favorable sign. If you sense cold in your head, neck, or shoulders, it indicates the entry of malign *qi*. Immediately lie down, close your eyes, and visualize the True Lord of the Great One in the *Palace of Original Cinnabar*, casting forth the radiant *Flowing Fire Bell* to expel the malign *qi* from your body. The firelight shall follow behind, illuminating your entire form until, after a long while, you are restored to equilibrium.\n\nIf you suddenly hear the sound of rushing water, thunder, or drumming in your ears, it signifies bodily exhaustion, extreme debilitation of the heart’s storehouse, and an inability to savor the true and nourish life, leading to dissipation. Thus, the six palaces lose their harmony, the hun and po wail in sorrow, and this foreshadows the onset of illness and death.\n\nThe *Muddy Pellet* has lost its method, the Nine Palaces are disordered, sorrow and disturbance reign in confusion, the drumming sounds in chaos, and the spirits seek to abandon their abode, forsaking the body. Upon hearing this, concentrate your thoughts on the True Lord of the Great One, restoring the focused sincerity of your true heart. If your transgressions are not profound, you may yet hear and reform. Deafness arises when the spirit of the ears has departed.\n\nThe ears are the Lord Emperor’s gates of hearing. The eyes are the sun and moon of the Great One. The nose is the hills and mountains of the Three Origins. The mouth is the crimson abyss of the *Vermilion Palace*. The eyebrows are the floral canopy of the White Prime. The hair is the forest essence of the *Hall of Luminosity*. The tongue is the dragon carriage of the *Peerless*. The teeth are the mighty power of the *Stomach Palace*. The hands are the external aid of the gallbladder spirit. The feet are the numinous gates of the kidney origin. The utmost yin is the true mechanism of the *Cavern Chamber*.\n\nThe single body harbors a hundred spirits, each with its proper domain—these must not be overlooked, nor treated with carelessness.\n\nIf you suddenly hear the sounds of gold and jade in your ears, it signifies the arrival of true *qi* and the imminent completion of the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "If you suddenly hear the sounds of stringed music, the Six Ding Jade Maidens come to guard you—this signifies the Dao is about to be accomplished.\n\nAbove the space between the eyebrows lies the *Yellow Gate* and *Purple Portal*, the *Crimson Terrace* and *Azure Chamber*, jointly established to guard the *cun* on either side of the ears. To the left of the *cun* stands the *Crimson Terrace*, and to the right, the *Yellow Gate*. The True Persons of the Nine Palaces enter and exit through the space between the *Yellow Gate* and *Crimson Terrace*, guided by the Dao. Thus, the terraces and gates are placed on either side. These terraces and gates serve to observe extraordinary *qi* conditions and welcome the comings and goings of the True Persons.\n\nThe great spirit of the *Purple Portal* is named *Pingjing* (\"Peaceful Stillness\"), styled *Fawang* (\"Dharma King\"). The great spirit of the *Azure Chamber* is named *Zhengxin* (\"Upright Heart\"), styled *Chufang* (\"Initial Square\"). Both resemble infants, each clad in robes matching the color of their respective chamber or portal, and each holds a *liujin* (\"flowing-gold\") fire-bell.\n\nThe *cun* recedes inward by three *fen*, hence its name, *shoucun* (\"guarding inch\"). At dawn, dusk, and during meditation, first visualize the two great spirits, faintly perceiving their forms. Then call their names thrice, and softly intone:\n\n*\"Purple Portal, Azure Chamber,*\n*Two great spirits, hands grasping flowing bells,*\n*Bodies generating wind and clouds,*\n*Flanking and guarding the true Dao,*\n*Barred to all external intrusions.*\n*May my thoughts and perceptions*\n*Open the numinous gates,*\n*Ensuring smooth and upright passage,*\n*Ascending through the Nine Portals,*\n*To behold the Nine True Ones,*\n*And the august presence of the Most High.\"*\n\nAfter the incantation, proceed to visualize the Three Ones, the Cavern Chambers, the Ninefold Dao, and all essential practices.\n\nThe two great spirits of the *shoucun* heed only the true officials within the Nine Palaces. When these officials, bearing the Mandate of the Supreme Emperor, or the Jade Lads, numinous perfected ones, sages, immortals, or any of the various imperial chariots, come and go, the two great spirits permit their passage. All others, being untrue, are barred from entering the inner palace. Such is the discipline of the *Central Yellow* and *Supreme One*.\n\nThereupon, the Infant Sovereign commands the ear spirits *Jiaonü* (\"Delicate Maiden\") and *Yunyi* (\"Cloud Ornament\") to guide them in. Thus, when one perceives ringing in the ears, it signals the arrival of an external emissary. Depending on whether the visitor is auspicious or inauspicious, *Yunyi* strikes the chime and bell to alert the Nine Palaces, ensuring vigilance against intruders. The chime and bell produce the very sounds that cause the ears to ring.\n\nUpon hearing this, place your hands over your ears and intone:\n\n*\"The Red Child dwells within the palace,*\n*The Nine True Ones abide in the chambers.*\n*I beseech you to heed the divine command,*\n*And ever discern what is inauspicious.\"*\n\nWithin the *Cinnabar Field* resides the *Supreme One True Lord of the Upper Origin*, along with the Sovereign’s ministers—a total of three—who together govern the palace of the *Cinnabar Field* and uphold the Dao of the Three Origins’ True One. This is the essential purport of the *Earthly Perfected* and the scripture of *Mounting the Dragon Chariot*.\n\nThe Heavenly Honored One often delights in becoming an *Earthly Perfected*. The *Earthly Perfected* retreats into official seclusion, untroubled by the toils of courtly banquets, thus moving leisurely and at ease, wandering as the occasion arises. They ascend in the *Seven Chariots* and tread the *Primordial Qi* within the *Great Nonbeing*. Though the *Heavenly Perfected* and *Earthly Perfected* differ slightly in rank, both are equally true. Each abides contentedly in their proper place, no longer aspiring to become officials in the clouds.\n\nWithin the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace* resides the *Mud-Pill Supreme One True Lord*. One *cun* behind the *Cinnabar Field* lies the *Flowing Pearl Palace*, whose true spirit is detailed in a separate scripture and governs the actions of the *Controller of Destiny*. Its Dao is profoundly wondrous; ( ) oaths and silk offerings are pledged, and covenants are sworn before it can be transmitted. This scripture is passed down once every three hundred years, and once bestowed, it may not be disseminated further. Such is the Dao of the *Supreme Polarity’s* ministers and the *Controller of Destiny*.\n\nThe *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace* is located above the *Cinnabar Field*, precisely one *cun* square, a purple chamber with green walls, filled with crimson mist. Within it, the *Mud-Pill Supreme One True Lord* governs the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace*. The True Lord resembles a newborn infant, seated upon a golden bed within a jade canopy, clad in a purple embroidered brocade robe, with a belt bearing *flowing-fire bells*. These *flowing-fire bells* are formless yet radiate crimson light; when moved, their sound resonates for thousands of miles—such is the precious bell of the *Central Yellow Supreme One True Person* of the *Upper Clarity*.\n\nIn the left hand, the True Lord grasps the handle of the *Northern Dipper’s* seven stars, and in the right, the *North Star’s* guiding rope. The *North Star* is the unmoving pole star, known as the *Celestial Guiding Rope*. Seated upright in the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace*, facing outward, the True Lord has no attendants on either side. The absence of attendants is why the title *Supreme One True Lord* is conferred.\n\nAt dawn and dusk, after attending to the Three Ones, one may then proceed to visualize the True Lord. This order—first the light, then the weighty—ensures proper cultivation.\n\nA person’s head contains nine palaces; let us first describe them. Above the space between the eyebrows lies the *Yellow Gate*. After visualizing it, call the names of the Three Lords thrice and strike the *Heavenly Drum* twenty-four times. A thousand demons will submit, and ten thousand ghosts and malevolent spirits will vanish.\n\nIf a Daoist feels hunger or thirst, visualize the Three Lords, and from their mouths exhale crimson *qi* to fill your own mouth. Inhale and swallow it, and soon you will be sated. If a Daoist travels at night and cannot see the path, visualize the Three Lords, causing their mouths to emit three beams of fire to illuminate the way, and the road will instantly become bright and clear.\n\nIf one finds oneself in perilous or treacherous places, amid the dangers of blades and weapons, swiftly visualize the Three Lords, causing them to ring their jade bells. Concentrate and focus your thoughts, and enemies will naturally be seized with fear and awe, no longer harboring malicious or harmful intentions.\n\nIf a Daoist seeks to prolong life, attain longevity, and avoid death, or to be rescued and revived when gravely ill, compose the mind, lie down peacefully, and with focused intent, visualize the Three Lords of the *Hall of Luminosity*. Kneel facing outward, exhale crimson *qi* so that its light envelops your body, encircling your mouth. Swallow the crimson *qi* repeatedly, without count. Close your eyes and gently swallow it. Soon, the crimson *qi* will coil around your body, transforming into fire that burns your form. Body and fire become one, radiating light within and without. After a long while, cease—this is called *Refining the Form with Sun and Moon*, reviving the dead.",

      "translated_text": "At dawn and dusk, when lying down at night, one should regularly practice this, and one will surely attain longevity and avoid death. Frequently visualizing and swallowing crimson *qi* will restore youthful complexion, making one’s countenance like that of a child—this is the Way of immortality, the essential secret of the *Hall of Luminosity* observed by transcendents.\n\nEach morning upon rising, one should swallow saliva thirty times, regularly wiping the face and rubbing the eyes with the hands, visualizing the saliva as crimson fluid. Within the *Cavern Chamber* reside the Three Perfected Lords: to the left is the Lord of Non-Florescence, to the right is the White Prime Lord, and in the center is the Yellow Elder Lord. These Three Perfected Lords together govern the *Cavern Chamber*, and this is the Way of Ascending Transcendence, which is expounded in separate scriptures.\n\nWithin the *Cinnabar Field* resides the Supreme Perfected Unity Lord of the Upper Origin. As for the Three Ones of the *Mud-Pellet Heavenly Emperor*, they are the spiritual essence of the body, the root of the hundred spirits, the mountain source of fluids, and the jade chamber of the ethereal soul. Thus, the *Stomach Pool* is square in form to receive things, while the *Brain Palace* is round and empty to accommodate the true. Myriad hairs stand erect, and a thousand pores emit mist. Virtue fills Heaven and Earth, merging with the Great Mystery—hence it is called the *Mud-Pellet*. The *Mud-Pellet* is the supreme spirit above the bodily form.\n\nThose who only know how to swallow *qi*, gurgle with saliva, click their teeth, and ingest fluids, yet do not understand their origin, merely grasp the overflow of the *Mud-Pellet* and the peripheral branches of the brain. Now I shall reveal to you the secret of guarding the One to hasten progress toward transcendence, so that you may become a Perfected One of the highest immortals.\n\nDisciples who receive this scripture must purify themselves with sincerity for forty-five days before transmission. Offer forty feet of green silk, five bright mirrors, and two pairs of gold rings as the covenant of *Penetrating Unity*, swearing an oath not to disclose it.\n\nOne inch above the space between the eyebrows lies the *Hall of Luminosity*; two inches inward is the *Cavern Chamber*; three inches inward is the *Cinnabar Field*. Directly above the *Cinnabar Field*, one inch square, lies the *Mysterious Cinnabar*, the essence of the brain, the *Mud-Pellet*, and the palace of the ethereal soul.\n\nWithin the *Hall of Luminosity* reside: to the left, the Luminous Youth Perfected Lord; to the right, the Luminous Maiden Perfected Lord; and in the center, the Luminous Mirror Spirit Lord. The Luminous Youth Perfected Lord is named *Mysterious Yang*, styled *Lesser Azure*. The Luminous Maiden Perfected Lord is named *Subtle Yin*, styled *Lesser Origin*. The Luminous Mirror Spirit Lord is named *Illuminating Essence*, styled *Fourfold Luminosity*. These Three Lords together govern the *Hall of Luminosity*, all clad in brocade robes, girded with four jade bells, and holding a jade mirror in their mouths—both the mirrors and bells are of crimson jade. Their heads resemble those of infants, as does their form. They sit facing outward or toward one another.\n\nThis is the Way of the *Hall of Luminosity*, practiced by transcendents and cultivated through the Dao and its virtue. If a Daoist feels fear, they should visualize the Three Spirits, causing the jade bells to chime so that the sound reaches the *Great Ultimate*, and the mouth to emit a crimson light from the jade mirror, extending ten thousand yards.\n\nOne inch above the *Hall of Luminosity* is the *Celestial Court Palace*; one inch above the *Cavern Chamber* is the *Utmost Perfection Palace*; one inch above the *Cinnabar Field* is the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace*; and one inch above the *Flowing Pearl Palace* is the *Supreme August Palace*. Altogether, there are nine palaces within the head.\n\nThe scriptures of the *Hall of Luminosity*, *Cavern Chamber*, *Cinnabar Field*, and *Flowing Pearl* are the Way by which transcendents become Perfected Ones, transmitted through the ages. The scripture of the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace* contains the essential words of the Perfected Officials who oversee destiny, serving as the leader of the four palaces.\n\nThis scripture may only be transmitted when the *Great Ultimate Emperor Lord* deems it permissible, and even then, it is granted only at the proper time. Those who practice the Way of the Five Palaces in the world and possess a true name will encounter it. Without the destined bone and fate, one will not hear these words.\n\nThere is also the *Jade Emperor Palace*, where the *Jade Purity Spirit Mother* resides; the *Celestial Court Palace*, where the *Upper Purity Perfected Maiden* resides; the *Utmost Perfection Palace*, where the *Great Ultimate Empress* resides; and the *Supreme August Palace*, where the *Supreme Lord’s Consort* resides. These four palaces are governed by the Feminine Perfected Unity, whose Way surpasses that of the Masculine Perfected Unity. Each has its own precious scripture, transmitted only to those who have already attained Perfection. Those who have not yet achieved Perfection are unworthy to hear of it. The essentials of the Feminine Perfected Unity are likewise not to be received lightly.\n\nThe *Supreme Lord* emerged from the *Eight Radiant Scenes of the Ultimate*, entered the *Jasper Terrace*, attended by three thousand jade maidens who served the Perfected and supported the chariot, with spirit consorts singing in harmony and divine attendants holding towels—all practiced the Way of the Feminine One, using it to ascend to the grand assembly of the *Mysterious Dawn*. This is the ancestral root of the *Supreme Lord*, transmitted by the *Spiritual Sovereign*.\n\nThese four palaces exist within all people, but those who do not cultivate this Way leave their palaces empty. Those who do not fully cultivate the Nine Palaces also leave their palaces empty—not only the four palaces of the Feminine Perfected. Within the *Cinnabar Field Palace*, the Emperor Lord is always present, and a great spirit guards the center, though one does not perceive them until cultivation reveals their presence. Those who cultivate become transcendents; those who do not merely live out their years and die.\n\nThe Way of the Feminine and Masculine Unity may be cultivated by both men and women, with no exceptions. Only through utmost dedication and perseverance will one reap its benefits.\n\nThe Way of the *Mysterious Cinnabar Supreme Unity Perfected Lord* requires that at dusk and in quiet repose, one dispel all distracting thoughts, sitting or lying as one wishes. First, visualize the purple *qi* of the *Northern Culmen Star* descending into the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace*. Soon, the palace fills, and the *qi* overflows beyond the body, enveloping it and penetrating both within and without, merging with the purple *qi* as one.\n\nThen, visualize the sun entering the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace*, filling it so that it resides at the center of the purple *qi*, appearing like a fiery pearl seen in darkness. Next, visualize the *Middle Yellow Supreme Unity Perfected Lord* of *Upper Purity* descending from the purple *qi* of the *Northern Culmen* into the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace*, seated within the sun. The Lord’s name is *Regulating Florescence*, styled *Transforming Mystery*, with attire and countenance as described above.\n\nFinally, visualize your own body suddenly ascending into the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace*, seated before the *Supreme Unity Perfected Lord*. Clad in whatever garments you envision, bow twice with reverence, kneel, and inquire of the Lord, seeking the Way of transcendence and longevity, speaking as your heart desires.",

Swallow the crimson *qi* repeatedly, without count. Close your eyes and gently swallow it. Soon, the crimson *qi* will coil around your body, transforming into fire that burns your form. Body and fire become one, radiating light within and without. After a long while, cease—this is called *Refining the Form with Sun and Moon*, reviving the dead.",

      "translated_text": "Through such repeated accumulation, one gradually attains the opportunity for encounter. The *Dragon Script of the Supreme* states: \"Sit upright in the *Mysterious Cinnabar*, neither slanted nor deviant.\" This is the essence of the Way—you must constantly visualize the *Supreme Unity’s* purple *qi* swirling around your body and swallow it. You must also visualize the *True Lord of the Supreme Unity* residing within the *Mysterious Cinnabar* Palace. Thus, you shall attain boundless longevity, and no misfortune shall assail you. This is the culmination of the *Mysterious Cinnabar* Dao.\n\nFrom the *Wondrous Scripture of the Pure Numinous Center*:\nThe *Lord of the Grand Thearch*, the *Supreme Celestial Thearch*, and the *Celestial Thearch of the Grand Tenuity*—these Three Venerable Lords—once received the *Upper Scripture of the Mysterious Cinnabar* from the *Lord of the Supreme Dao*. Through its practice and cultivation, they ascended to replenish the true essence of emperors and kings. On the day of their ascent into the heavens, the *Lord of the Grand Thearch* transmitted the true scripture to the *Queen Mother of the West*; the *Supreme Celestial Thearch* transmitted it to the *Upper Prime Lord of the Southern Culmen*; and the *Celestial Thearch of the Grand Tenuity* transmitted it to the *Sacred Lord of the Golden Watchtower*. The *Sacred Lord of the Golden Watchtower* then passed it to the *Prime Minister of the Azure Lad*, who in turn transmitted it to *Master Juan*. This scripture is the *Upper Chapter of the Pure Numinous*, a teaching of profound subtlety, not to be heard by middling immortals. Unless one’s name is inscribed on crimson tablets with emerald characters in the *Great Ultimate*, the *Upper Scripture of the Mysterious Cinnabar* will not be encountered or witnessed.\n\nIf a Daoist fully cultivates the *Three True Scriptures of the Supreme*, their rank shall be that of *Supreme Duke* and *Prime Minister* above emperors and kings. If one’s reception of the teachings is partial or their understanding of the Dao limited, their rank shall be that of a minor king in the *Palace of Numinous Lesser Realms*, a minister of the *Divine Continent*, or a *Grand Master* of the *Great Ultimate’s* middle or lower ranks. Yet even they shall ride dragons and drive clouds, soaring through the void, escorted by divine officials, their radiance dispersing to the eight directions. How subtle and profound—this must not be lightly disclosed.\n\nThe titles of these scriptures derive from the *Hidden Writings of the Supreme* in the *Eight Pure Chapters*, which follow the structure of celestial and terrestrial correspondences. The *Three Ones of the Mud-Pill Palace Thearch* are the spiritual origin of the body, the root of life for the hundred spirits, the mountain source of fluids, and the jade chamber of the *hun* and essence. Thus, the stomach’s reservoir is square to receive matter, while the brain’s palace is round and empty to accommodate the true. Ten thousand hairs stand erect, a thousand pores emit mist, virtue aligns with celestial power, and all merges with the *Great Mystery*. The *Nine Numinous Primes* of the *Pure Origin* are thus called the *Upper Treasury of the Mud-Pill Palace*. The *Upper Treasury of the Mud-Pill Palace* is the supreme spirit within the form of the Great Dao.\n\nYet if you only know how to swallow *qi* and ingest fluids, to sound the *Celestial Drum* and absorb saliva, without understanding their origin—these are but the overflowing foam of the *Mud-Pill Palace’s* upper stream, mere tributaries of the brain’s domain. Now I shall reveal to you the secret of *Guarding the One*, practiced in accordance with the twelve hours. Each spirit possesses a surname, given name, native land, palace, attire, and luminous hue.\n\nIf you wish to compound the *Divine Elixir*, you must visualize these spirits’ forms and colors:\nThe male is nine *cun* and nine *fen* in height, girded with a sash of five colors—mysterious yellow and pure numinous silk. He wears a cap adorned with seven treasures and vermilion jade, crowned with the *Infinite Wisdom* cap. He dwells in the *Crimson Palace of the Supreme Ultimate*, the *Uppermost Treasury of the Five Numinous Realms* in the *Mysterious Origin Hamlet*. His surname is *Lian*, given name *Xian*, courtesy name *Huangyan*.\n\nThe female is six *cun* and six *fen* in height, robed in a nine-colored sash of azure treasure, divine radiance, brocade, frost-silk, and luminous hues. She wears a *Mysterious Yellow Wisdom* cap and resides in the *Supreme Palace of Kunlun’s Great Seclusion*, the *Hall of Brightness* in the *Nine Radiant Realms* of the *Great Transformation Hamlet*. Her surname is omitted, given name *Hui*, courtesy name *Biyu*.\n\nThese two, when beheld, are the parents of the *Divine Elixir* that gives birth to great immortals. Before the primordial *qi* took form, before the five governances were established, before light and shadow were distinguished—there was neither limit nor end, neither above nor below, neither exterior nor interior, neither left nor right, neither before nor after. They are the primal ancestors of the *Supreme*, the parents of primordial *qi*, the ultimate subtlety of the *Mysterious Origin*, the unmanifest of the *Empty Ultimate*. From them, the ten thousand things are born, and heaven and earth endure.\n\nIf they dwell among humans, their lifespan is the longest. Those who can visualize them shall live a thousand years without aging, dwelling also among the Nine Heavens, where the myriad spirits receive their transmission.\n\nWhen compounding the elixir, all ingredients must first be prepared with fasting, purification, and ritual purity. Once the elixir is complete, its efficacy will manifest. It is called the *Mysterious Elixir*, and the essence-water of a virgin girl is also excellent for its preparation. To compound the elixir, you must do so with a virgin girl in a secluded place. Three people should avoid contact with the profane. For three days and nights, erect a yellow altar.\n\nIn the east, place the *Azure Dragon* talisman to subdue wood essence, inscribed in blue;\nIn the south, place the *Vermilion Bird* talisman to subdue fire essence, inscribed in red;\nIn the west, place the *White Tiger* talisman to subdue metal essence, inscribed in white;\nIn the north, place the *Dark Warrior* talisman to subdue water essence, inscribed in black;\nIn the center, place the *Yellow Dragon* talisman to subdue earth essence, inscribed in yellow.\n\nErect the five talismans in their respective forms, then compound the elixir. The essence of numinous sand and herbal medicines may all be combined into the elixir. When a *knife-tip’s* measure enters the mouth, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nDuring compounding, beware of defilement—if the elixir fails, it will cost you your life. The oral instructions for compounding must not neglect the order of the Nine Heavens and Nine Earths. Know their sequence well:\n\nThe *Heaven of Supreme Purity* is the upper treasury of the Nine Heavens, the first generation, its *qi* pure and empty, the abode of the Most Revered.\nThe *Heaven of Pure Tenuity* is the uppermost palace of the first rank, the second generation, its *qi* subtle and wondrous, governed by the next in reverence.\nThe *Great Crimson Heaven* is the upper palace of the northern first rank, the third generation, its *qi* vermilion and cinnabar, ruled by the *Lord of the Great Yang*.\nThe *Great Azure Heaven* is the treasury of the *Mysterious Origin*, the fourth generation, its *qi* profound and distant, ruled by the *Lord of Emptiness and Non-Being*.\nThe *Great Mysterious Dark Heaven* is the palace of the *Northern Capital*, the fifth generation, its *qi* wondrous and obscure, ruled by the *Lord of the Infinite*.",

Its depth is the same as above, where all earthly officials reside.\nThe third land, *Imperial Virtue*, is pervaded by verdant blue, governed by the *Earth Dragon of the Tiger’s Maw*. Its depth is the same as above, where all earthly officials reside.\nThe fourth land, *Kingly Virtue*, is pervaded by yellow, governed by the *Great General of Primal Heart Earth*. Its depth is likewise the same.\nThe fifth land, *Primal Virtue*, is pervaded by red, governed by the *Officer of Primal Blessing Earth*. Its depth is the same as above.\nThe sixth land, *Earthly Virtue*, is pervaded by white, governed by the *One of Primal Bone Earth*. Its depth is the same as above.\nThe seventh land, *Inner Virtue*, is pervaded by purple, governed by the *Parents of the Dawn Earth*. Its depth is the same as above.\nThe eighth land, *Returning Virtue*, is pervaded by azure, governed by the *Ancestral Rectifier of the Worthy Earth*. Its depth is the same as above.\nThe ninth land, *Flourishing Virtue*, is pervaded by green, governed by the *Two Thousand Stone Officers of the Celestial Axle*. Its depth is the same as above.\nThe count of their *qi* derives from the *Frigid Waters of the Great Cold Region*.\n\nIf a Daoist can thoroughly comprehend the two scrolls herein, they will commune with the numinous in Heaven and Earth. Thereafter, in practice, they will not undergo the trials of the Nine Heavens, Nine Lands, or Nine Waters; they will not enter the *Hill of Cold*, nor endure freezing chill, but will join the ranks of the luminous and pure among the six pitch-pipes in Heaven.\nShould a Daoist disregard these teachings, they will descend into the Yellow Springs, undergoing trials in the prisons of the earthly hells, destined for the *Hill of Cold*. Though they may be ghosts, their forms will still suffer venomous torment, agony so intense it cannot be borne—such is the fate of spectral servitude. Their words may be false, but their suffering is real. Their descendants, male and female, will not live out their years but will meet untimely ends.\nMoreover, in the *Ghost Statutes of the Blue Maiden* and the eight scrolls of the imperial decrees, ghosts submit of their own accord.\nThese two sacred texts must not be mingled with others unless inscribed on cinnabar tablets.\n\nOne must fully grasp the palaces and chambers within the body, the dwelling places of the spirits: one hundred eighty palaces, three hundred sixty joints, one thousand two hundred apertures, twelve thousand radiant essences, and thirty-six thousand spirit lords.\nHere dwells the Most Revered, where the *Mysterious Sages* reside. The three *hun* and seven *po*, the twelve bodily forms and shadows, respond to myriad sounds.\nThus the reckoning of yin and yang is complete in the Three Origins: the head as the *Heavenly Origin*, the heart as the *Middle Origin*, and the kidneys as the *Lower Origin*—all governed by thirty-six thousand spirit lords. This is called the *Subtle Mystery of the Three Origins*, distinguished as left and right.\nHence: left is azure, right is white; front is red, back is black; center is true yellow.\nThe six pitch-pipes emerge from this, governed by the twenty-four *qi*, each with its own domain. The *Primal Elders* and their deputies number thirty-six thousand.\nTransformations shift without end; though one may briefly evade a time, this is not death but merely a change of form.\nThus the myriad spirits are established among the myriad beings. When their forces converge and accumulate, they coalesce into human *qi*; when dispersed, the spirits scatter. Once the spirits scatter, the body can no longer move, and the true form naturally conceals itself.\nOrdinary people, growing old, simply do not understand this principle and call it permanent death, wailing in grief. Yet this is no different from the hundred insects: on the first day of the *Beginning of Winter*, they all shed their skins outside their burrows, their forms returning to the earth. At the *Waking of Insects* in mid-spring, they emerge again, unaware of where they shed their skins—just like newborn infants.\n\nI often see you all briefly appear in the world, yet you do not study the Dao of immortality, nor harmonize with divine medicines. Instead, you incur transgressions and endure punishments until your allotted time is complete, then return to your descendants’ bodies, taking form anew—how can you not understand this?\nIf you have committed transgressions, cultivate merit to atone for them, and make amends for past faults by observing the prohibitions and decrees. Thus it is said: when ancestors act with virtue, blessings flow to their descendants; when they act with wickedness, sins befall later generations. This is because their earthly punishments are not yet complete, and when their time is up, they return to the world to repay their debts—not because they themselves committed evil in this life.",

      "translated_text": "Guard your words carefully, for the Examiners watch over you day and night. The mouth is the Gate of Heaven—do not recklessly transmit [these teachings]. To transmit them to the unworthy is to forfeit fifty years of your allotted lifespan.\n\nBy the statutes of the luminous code: on the day of *gengshen*, the six *po*-spirits of the body ascend to the Celestial Treasury and return to the human form. On this day, face east and sit upright—beware of sleeping or lying down. Pray thus: *\"Spirits of the Five Viscera, abide in your palaces and chambers. Together, contemplate the proper method. If any leaks forth, suppress it: if it leaks from the head, press the feet; all depends on the master’s guidance.\"*\n\nThe arts of contemplating the viscera: within my body, the three *hun*-souls dwell in my liver on the left, the seven *po*-spirits in my lungs on the right. One hundred and twenty forms and shadows, twelve thousand rays of essence and light, enter through the Celestial Bridge of my mouth, ascending to Kunlun Mountain, the Prefecture of Fanyang, the Land of Non-Action. The Vermilion Bird leads the way, bearing banners; the Dark Warrior follows, bearing bells and drums. The Azure Dragon attends on the left, the White Tiger on the right. The Yellow Spirit of the Center wields the battle-axe. A thousand ghosts and ten thousand spirits prostrate themselves, none daring to rise. Ahead lies a cauldron of boiling liquid holding ten thousand *shi*; behind, scales bristle and claws reverse. May you, my lord, dissolve my calamities and disperse my misfortunes. As I pass through this time, I tread the Three Bonds and Six Relations, severing the demons—*hasten, as the statutes command!*\n\nAs a Daoist, you must listen and observe within your body. By its radiance and hue, you will know whether it is emaciated and *qi*-depleted, struck by the six vile and malevolent ghosts. At the hour when the sun is at its zenith, retire to a secluded chamber, close your eyes, and gaze inward for a long while. If you see a resplendent glow, bright and flourishing, then your body is robust, and your year will be one of vigor. Stop your ears and listen inwardly: if you hear the sound of metal and stone, or the tones of reed pipes, the five notes, bells, and chimes, these are all auspicious signs. But if the light appears faint and thin, or you hear wailing and lamentation, these are all inauspicious omens.\n\nYou must then compose and harmonize your spirit, and visualize the True Unity Lord returning to govern within your palace-chambers. Recite the incantation: *\"My form is host to ten thousand spirits. Secure my palace-chambers; guard my Jade Hall, and let none wander astray. Guardian warriors at the gates, Central Youths—if any extraordinary being enters or departs, seize them and deliver them to the market square. Bind their heads and cover their faces; let them not stir—hasten, as the statutes command!\"*\n\nIf you perceive your essence-light growing faint and thin, at the hour when the sun or moon first rises, face east and sit upright. Pray thus: *\"Warm and radiant, warm and radiant, essence-light bright! I swallow *qi* and consume shadows, drawing them into my form. Support my body and summon the divine spirits. Let true *qi* return to govern, cutting off perverse essences. Grant me long life and ten thousand years of longevity—hasten, as the statutes command!\"* Swallow nine times and cease.\n\nIf your body suddenly feels disquieted, your heart sorrowful and pensive, as though longing for something yet without clear cause, your mind restless and unable to find peace—this is precisely when the spirits within your body yearn to depart, longing for their palace-chambers. The three *hun* have already gone; the seven *po* take flight. Only the form remains, now mingling with perverse forces. In dreams, you may encounter women or men, exchanging essence and leaking spirit—these are all omens of death. Should such signs appear, you must reform yourself anew. Approach a Daoist libationer to present a memorial, and kneel in supplication to express your sorrow. Establish minor merits to soothe your heart and mind. From this day forward, observe the proper times for cultivation: pay homage to the Four Honored Ones, practice the Three, Five, Seven, Nine; the Two, Four, Six, Eight; the Eight Winds, Twelve Thunders, Twenty-Four Rains, Three Hundred Sixty Lightning Bolts, Nine Palaces, and Eight Trigrams. Do not mingle the true with the false, nor engage in improper conduct, lest the Examiners report you. After death, the Three Offices will grant no pardon.\n\nWhen facing south, the Vermilion Bird of the South should face south, and the talisman likewise. When facing west, the White Tiger of the West should face south, and the talisman should face west.",

When at the center, the Yellow Dragon should face south, and the talisman face east. When facing east, the Azure Dragon should face south, and the talisman face east—all inscribed on peachwood tablets.\n\nThis Azure Dragon talisman severs wood spirits.\nThis Vermilion Bird talisman severs fire spirits.\nThis White Tiger talisman severs metal spirits.\nThis Dark Warrior talisman severs water spirits.\nThis Yellow Dragon talisman severs earth spirits.\n\n*The Threefold Statutes of the Nine Perfected Illuminated Regulations from the Cavern of Perfection*\n\nThe Most High addressed the Celestial Thearchs, the Sagely Sovereigns of Later Ages, the Supreme Ministers and Azure Lads, and the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, saying: All later disciples who obtain sight of the Three Caverns’ precious writs or the first scrolls of the secret scriptures shall have their names inscribed in gold characters in the Eastern Florescence and recorded in the Upper Clarity. Though they may not yet soar to the Purple Court with reins in hand, they are already those destined for transcendence.\n\nYet even if they behold these texts, without knowing the *Nine Perfected Illuminated Regulations*—the protocols and standards of the Three Caverns’ wondrous writs and the Most High’s precious books—they cannot casually unroll them. These illuminated regulations, treasured and secret, are concealed within the Palace of the Dark Capital, in the Golden Chambers of the Jade Metropolis, and are not transmitted to the world. They clarify the profound mysteries of the Three Caverns, mark the rituals of the assembled perfected, deliver those with karmic bonds from the dark palaces, elevate the Seven Mysteries to the registers of immortality, interweave the threads of the ten thousand Dao, and dissolve the heavy burdens of the Nine Yin. Their wonders are attainable; when their statutes are put into practice, they instill solemn discipline.\n\nNow, therefore, I reveal the threefold outline of these regulations to assist in the propagation of the Three Wondrous and Pristine Numinous Scriptures, that they may serve as admonitions to later disciples. Let those who aspire to diligence take heed of these precious statutes.\n\nThe Celestial Thearchs, the Nine Mysteries’ Sagely Sovereigns, the Supreme Ministers and Azure Lads, the Perfected Lads of the Great Ultimate, and the Perfected of the Great Ultimate bowed their heads and dared to inquire of the Most High Heavenly Worthy: The supreme and true methods are lofty, transcendent, and limpid, vast and boundless in their myriad manifestations; they are profoundly still and empty, their wondrous subtleties radiant and resplendent. Their teachings transform the Three Vehicles, pervading countless kalpas—who could be equal to them? How could one neglect the illuminated regulations?\n\nThe Most High replied: Your words are good. As for later generations, unless they are those of luminous emptiness who coalesce spontaneously from the primordial, all are conceived within the primal qi and tainted by the clamor and filth of the world. Their conduct is not purely formed, their natures not single-mindedly refined. Though they may yearn for the profound mysteries, their hearts often turn away from me. In all their actions, they inevitably commit transgressions. Transgressions arise externally, extinguishing life internally. Those who study in this manner—how far do they stray from the true!\n\nIf the Three Offices hold them accountable and their cases lie with the dark bureaus, if their seven generations of ancestors are examined and their sins accumulate upon their persons—those who commit such transgressions, if they awaken to the existence of the illuminated regulations with their systems of correction and punishment, and to the greatness of the sagely transformation that again permits methods of redemption, and apply them according to the statutes, then the time of their perfection will surely draw near.\n\nFor scholars of the Dao who lack these standards, their painstaking contemplation is in vain, and their bitter devotion yields no benefit. Now, therefore, I reveal the *Nine Perfected Threefold Illuminated Regulations* to be transmitted to later disciples who are destined to become perfected.\n\nThe Sagely Sovereigns, the Supreme Ministers and Azure Lads, and the Perfected of the Great Ultimate then withdrew, purified themselves, and journeyed to the Upper Clarity to receive the *Pristine Numinous Great Possession Wondrous Scripture and the Nine Perfected Illuminated Regulations*. They concealed them in golden treasuries and jade coffers, guarded by jade lads and jade maidens—three thousand each—who attended to the numinous texts. Incense wafted through the empty courtyards, flying dragons and venomous beasts, giant serpents a thousand fathoms long, brandished their claws upon the cloud-walls, standing guard at the Jade Pass. Thus did the Ten Heavenly Great Sages and the Perfected Immortals of the Nine Palaces, three times each month, ascend to the Dark Palace to receive the illuminated regulations and pay homage to the numinous texts.\n\nThe Supreme Minister and Azure Lad said: All who possess golden bones and jade bodies, whose names are recorded in the Azure Palace, and who obtain these texts must keep them secret and put them into practice. In this way, the rites of reception harmonize with the supreme canons, the protocols of application align with the true, and the methods of redemption and deliverance dissolve all karmic entanglements. The seven generations of ancestors rejoice, and one’s own person ascends to feast in the Jade Palace.\n\n*The Upper Scroll of the Threefold Statutes of the Nine Perfected Illuminated Regulations of the Dark Capital: The Transmission of Scriptures*\n\nThe first scroll of the Upper Rank of the Dark Capital states: The *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*, the *Precious Scripture of the Feminine One*, and the *Most High Pristine Numinous Great Possession Wondrous Scripture*—the three wondrous chapters and the precious writs of the August Jade Sovereign—are concealed in the Palace of Great Possession above the Nine Heavens, within the Jade Chambers of the Supreme Mystery’s Numinous Terrace. According to the ancient statutes of the August Sovereign of the Highest, these scriptures are transmitted once every ten thousand kalpas. The three true and luminous Dao flourish daily among those who study the perfected.\n\nThe supreme and correct statutes permit three transmissions within seven thousand years. Jade lads and jade maidens, seven thousand each, attend with incense and tend to the numinous texts. According to the statutes governing transmission, one must face the altar and fast for a hundred days, swear an oath with a golden clasp, and assign jade lads and jade maidens in accordance with the statutes of the Four Poles. Those who transmit without following the statutes shall have their sins extend to their seven generations of ancestors, their dark souls condemned to servitude—swallowing fire, eating iron, bearing mountains, and transporting stones to fill the boundless abyss. Their own persons shall suffer the punishment of the wind-blade, their bodies perishing and their forms mutilated, eternally confined to the earthly prisons, never to attain immortality.\n\nThe second scroll of the Upper Rank of the Dark Capital states: For transmitting the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the True Scripture of the Great Cavern* to later disciples, the oath requires ten taels of superior gold, twenty-five catties of bronze, five pairs of golden clasps, one golden fish, one jade dragon, and one tael of green silk to bind the clasps.\n\nFor the *Feminine One*, five taels of superior gold, fifty feet each of five-colored brocade and silk, one catty of incense, and three pairs of golden clasps.\n\nFor the *Most High Pristine Numinous Cavern-True Mysterious Scripture*, two taels of superior gold, one hundred feet of purple-patterned silk, twenty-seven feet of green brocade, five taels of red silk, one catty of incense, and one tael of cinnabar.\n\nThe August Sovereign’s trust and oath must not be deficient; deficiency violates the statutes. If the master transgresses, the jade lads and jade maidens who attend the scriptures shall be returned to their original palaces. Within three years, the master’s body shall suffer the torture of the wind-blade, and the scriptures shall naturally be lost.",

Their seven generations of ancestors and parents shall be consigned to the punishments of the Northern Feng, and for ten thousand kalpas, they shall be reborn into the paths of non-human beings. Let learners be cautious.\n\nThe third chapter of the *Upper Rank of the Mysterious Metropolis* states: All those bearing the golden name *Eastern Florescence* and the jade title *Upper Clarity*, who receive the *Jade Scripture of the Imperial Chapters of the Towering Empyrean*, the *Purple Metamorphosis of the Flaming Radiance of the Pristine and True*, the *Seventy-Four Methods of Upper Clarity Transformation*, the *Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected*, the *Eight Arts of the Hidden Earth of the Cinnabar Landscape’s Daoic Essence*, the *Jade Scripture of Dissolving Form and Transmuting through Flowing Radiance*, and the *Seven Transformations of the Heavenly Dance*—these are all the exalted scriptures of the Nine Heavens’ True Kings, the Primordial Celestial King of Origin, the Most High Celestial Thearch, and the Yellow Elder Lord of the Center. They were received within the Great Void, amid the Nine Mysteries, as the loftiest chapters of Non-Being. All are secretly preserved within the Palace of the Numinous Metropolis of the Great Highest, in the Purple Chambers, governed by the Three Origin Lords, attended by three thousand jade lads and jade maidens.\n\nAt the inception of the Primordial Origin, these scriptures were transmitted once every seven thousand kalpas. After the establishment of the Three Ways and the Rectification of the Dao, transmission was permitted thrice within seven years, and if a worthy recipient appeared within seven hundred years, transmission was also permitted. Transmission requires facing the altar for ninety days of purification, or thirty days, or nine days, and the scriptures are conferred only after a covenant is sworn. Jade lads and jade maidens are assigned in accordance with the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*. Should one transmit these teachings without adhering to the statutes, the sin shall extend to seven generations of ancestors and parents, who shall be consigned to the offices of ghostly servitude, compelled to haul the stones of Mount Meng to fill the River of Eternal Night. For ten thousand kalpas, they shall be reborn into the paths of non-human beings, while the transgressor’s own body shall suffer the torture of the wind-blade, the scriptures shall naturally be lost, and they shall never attain immortality. Let those who transmit be cautious.\n\nThe fourth chapter of the *Upper Rank of the Mysterious Metropolis* states: For the transmission of the *Jade Scripture of the Imperial Chapters*, one must present a golden fish, a jade dragon, thirty-two feet of green silk, and three pairs of golden clasps as oath. For the *Purple Metamorphosis of the Flaming Radiance*, fifty feet each of five-colored brocade, five taels of gold, five catties of aloeswood, one catty of true pearls, one scripture knife, seven golden fish, and seventy feet of crimson-patterned silk as oath. For the *Seventy-Four Methods of Upper Clarity Transformation*, forty feet of green silk, ten taels of superior gold, six pairs of golden clasps, one catty of fine incense, and a golden fish and jade dragon as oath. For the *Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected*, one must follow the statutes and cut off hair as covenant; now, ninety feet of white silk are used to substitute for the covenant, in accordance with the number of the Nine Perfected. One catty of green silk and twenty feet of crimson-patterned silk serve as the oath of the Sun’s Radiance; twenty-four feet of azure silk as the oath of the Moon’s Splendor; and three pairs of golden rings as the pledge of the Eternal Lad’s transformation.\n\nFor the *Eight Arts of the Hidden Earth of the Cinnabar Landscape’s Daoic Essence* and the *Jade Scripture of Dissolving Form and Transmuting through Flowing Radiance*, one must present ten taels of superior gold, one golden fish and one jade dragon each, thirty feet of green silk, and forty feet of purple-patterned silk, along with three pairs of golden rings each. For the *Seven Transformations of the Heavenly Dance*, five taels of superior gold, one catty of incense, and thirty-two feet of green silk as oath. The pledge must be made with sincerity of heart; no deficiency is permitted, for deficiency violates the statutes. The master shall cast the celestial pledge into the mountain retreats or riverine sanctuaries to succor the destitute, while the remainder shall be used to furnish the implements for the scriptures. It must not be dispersed elsewhere. Should the master violate the higher statutes, their jade lads and jade maidens shall be revoked, their lifespan and destiny records diminished, and their names inscribed for return to the Northern Feng. Those who receive these teachings without adhering to the statutes shall lose their souls and spirits, suffer the torture of the wind-blade, and within three years, the scriptures shall naturally be lost; they shall never attain immortality.\n\nThe fifth chapter of the *Upper Rank of the Mysterious Metropolis* states: The *Wisdom of Dispelling Demons*, the *Hidden Book of Jade Clarity*, the *Golden Chapters of the Absolute Mystery of the Soaring Empyrean of the Treasure Cavern*, the *Crimson Writ of the Eight Radiant Mornings of the Purple Phoenix*, the *Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance*, the *Numinous Writ of the Purple Text*, the *Golden Pendants and Jade Girdles*, the *Upper Scripture of the Golden Root*, and the *Orthodox Dharma of the Three Heavens*—these are all the treasured scriptures of the Most High Dao Lord, the Primordial Celestial King of Origin, and the Golden Portal Thearch. They are secretly preserved within the Palace of Jade Clarity, in the Golden Chambers and Purple Portals, guarded by three thousand jade lads and jade maidens, each attending the numinous writs.\n\nAt the inception of the Primordial Origin, these were transmitted once every thousand kalpas. After the establishment of the Three Heavens and the Rectification of the Dao, transmission was permitted thrice within seven hundred years, and if a worthy recipient appeared within a hundred years, one transmission was permitted. Jade lads and jade maidens are assigned in accordance with the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*. Transmission requires facing the altar for ninety days of purification, or thirty days, or nine days. Should one transmit these teachings without adhering to the statutes, the sin shall extend to the seven mysteries and nine generations of ancestors, who shall be eternally consigned to ghostly servitude without release. The transgressor’s own body shall suffer the torture of the wind-blade, die to become a lowly ghost, and never attain immortality.\n\nThe sixth chapter of the *Upper Rank of the Mysterious Metropolis* states: For the transmission of the *Wisdom of Dispelling Demons*, the *Golden Chapters of the Absolute Mystery of the Soaring Empyrean of the Treasure Cavern*, and the *Crimson Writ of the Eight Radiant Mornings of the Purple Phoenix*, one must present ten taels of superior gold, one jade tablet, one golden fish, one jade dragon, and forty feet of purple silk. For the *Upper Scripture of the Golden Root* and the *Numinous Writ of the Purple Text*, five taels of superior gold, one golden slip and one jade tablet each, measuring one foot six inches in length and two inches four fen in width, one golden fish, one jade dragon, one hundred feet of purple silk, and forty feet of green-patterned silk. For the *Orthodox Dharma of the Three Heavens*, forty feet of green silk, forty-three feet of green cloth, and five pairs of golden rings as secret oath; ten taels of superior gold as the pledge to commune with the spirits.\n\nFor the *Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance*, the *Jade Pendants and Golden Girdles*, and the *Hidden Book of Jade Clarity*, one golden fish and one jade dragon each shall serve as the pledge of oath. One must adhere to the statutes without deficiency, for deficiency shall cause the master to lose their jade lads and jade maidens, and their names shall be inscribed for return to the Northern Feng.

They are the secret chapters of hidden transformation, concealed within the Jade Palace of the Supreme Lord, in the Purple Chamber, where jade lads and jade maidens—three thousand in number—stand guard.\n\nAccording to the statutes, they are transmitted once every seven thousand years. After the establishment of the Three Heavens’ orthodoxy, the interval is reduced to seven hundred years, during which three transmissions may be granted. If a worthy recipient appears within a hundred years, the transmission may proceed. The transmission requires a ninety-day or thirty-day purification fast, after which jade lads and jade maidens are bestowed, in accordance with *The Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*. Those who transmit without adherence to the statutes shall incur guilt extending to their sevenfold mysterious ancestors and seven generations of forebears, condemning them to eternal servitude as ghosts in the Northern Feng, enduring the ten torments and eight calamities. Their own bodies shall suffer the torture of the wind-blade, their souls shall be cast into the Dark Abyss, and they shall never attain immortality.\n\nThe Eighth Scroll of the Supreme Works of the Mysterious Capital states:\n\nFor the transmission of *The Seven Stars’ Transference of Destiny*, forty-one feet of green cloth, seventy feet of crimson silk, ninety feet of phoenix-patterned gauze, and one pair of golden buttons shall be offered. For *The White-Feathered Scripture*, two taels of gold, thirty-two feet of green silk, shall replace the oath of cutting hair and smearing blood. For *Treading the Celestial Net*, thirty feet of brocade, one golden fish, and one jade dragon shall serve as the pledge. For *The Supreme Hidden Book*, the oath shall be sworn with a golden fish and jade dragon. For *The Numinous Flight of the Six Jia*, sixty feet of plain silk, six pairs of golden rings, and six taels of green silk thread shall be presented.\n\nThe celestial statutes demand sincerity as the essence of the heart; no deficiency is permitted, for deficiency violates the mysterious statutes. The master shall revoke their jade lads and jade maidens, erase their names from the Azure Register and Jade Roll, and return them to the Northern Feng. Those who receive these teachings without adhering to the statutes shall lose their essence and spirit, suffer the punishment of the wind-blade, and within three years, the scriptures shall naturally be lost; they shall never attain immortality.\n\nThe Ninth Scroll of the Supreme Works of the Mysterious Capital states:\n\nAll the talismans of the various Perfected Ones—*The Divine Resonance of the Square Yard*, *The Expansive Seven Primes*, *The Hidden Writings of the Eight Heavens*, *The Flowing Gold and Fire Bell*, *The Golden Spirit and Tiger Talisman*, *The Demon-Dispelling Branches and Trunks of the Night-Illuminating Divine Candle*, *The Eight Arts of Hidden Retreat: The Purple Clarity Jade Talisman*, *The Upper Talismans of the Six Jia from the Five Registers of the Cavernous Mystery*, *The Secret Writings of the Five Agents*, and *The Jade Regulations of the Mysterious Capital*—number six hundred in total. The Supreme Lord has inscribed their texts within the ancient scriptures to serve as the foundation for practice.\n\nThe statutes of transmission and oaths must fully adhere to the scriptural regulations. Any deficiency in transmission incurs the same punishment as described in the preceding scrolls. Possessing scriptures without talismans invites harm from celestial demons; possessing talismans without scriptures renders thoughts and invocations ineffectual, and the divine Perfected shall not descend. The statutes decree that neither may be practiced in isolation; those who do so shall incur the same punishment. Both scriptures and talismans originate from the qi of spontaneity and the intent of the Void and Nonexistence; thus, they cannot be cultivated separately. Without adherence to the statutes, the Dao shall never be attained.\n\n---\n\n**The Middle Scrolls of the Statutes of the Nine Perfected Ones of the Mysterious Capital: Admonitions on Offenses**\n\nThe First Scroll of the Middle Works of the Mysterious Capital states:\n\nAmong later disciples, those whose seven generations of ancestors or descendants have committed murder, robbery, plunder, treachery, usurpation, or lewdness; whose nine clans have engaged in collusion or plotted rebellion against the Dao—such transgressions are especially grave, their grievances and retributions accumulating in the Nine Yin, beyond absolution by pardon. Their descendants, burdened by residual calamity, may not partake in the true scriptures or secretly receive the sacred texts.\n\nIf one possesses a sincere resolve and aspires to self-discipline, they must first confess to their sevenfold mysterious ancestors, perform meritorious deeds, liberate imprisoned souls, and expose themselves beneath the Three Luminaries, loosening their hair and prostrating in repentance for three years without wearying. They must personally present a substantial pledge to the Nine Rivers to redeem their past transgressions. Only then may they observe a hundred-day purification fast and receive the sacred scriptures to proceed with their practice.\n\nThose who bear such sins yet fail to first punish and reproach themselves, or to confess their offenses to the Heavenly Treasures before receiving the teachings, shall—both master and disciple—suffer the torture of the wind-blade. Their sevenfold mysterious ancestors shall be eternally confined to the Dark Abyss, bearing stones and mountains for ten thousand kalpas without release, their bodies perishing and their scriptures lost. Be vigilant and prudent.\n\nThe Second Scroll of the Middle Works of the Mysterious Capital states:\n\nThose who wish to cultivate the supreme Dao yet bear grave sins—having taken lives with their own hands, perpetrated cruelty and oppression, slaughtered living beings, plundered the common folk, schemed in treachery, colluded with their nine clans, slandered the worthy and capable, or rebelled against their masters—such unforgivable offenses, accumulated in the Nine Yin, may not partake in the wondrous teachings or practice the scriptures.\n\nIf one possesses a sincere resolve, they must confess their initial transgressions, perform meritorious deeds, expose themselves beneath the Three Luminaries, loosen their hair and prostrate in repentance for three years, present a pledge to the river to atone for their faults, and liberate their sevenfold mysterious ancestors, thereby distinguishing themselves in the Three Realms. Only then may they observe a hundred-day purification fast and receive the sacred scriptures to proceed with their practice.\n\nThose who bear such sins yet fail to first confess, reproach themselves, or perform penance before receiving the scriptures shall—both master and disciple—suffer the torture of the wind-blade, endure the ten torments and eight calamities of the soul, and be cast into the Dark Springs. Their scriptures shall naturally be lost, and their seven generations of ancestors and parents shall be eternally bound to the Dark Paths, never to be released for ten thousand kalpas. Disciples, be cautious.\n\nThe Third Scroll of the Middle Works of the Mysterious Capital states:\n\nThose who receive the Three Wonders’ sacred texts or the secret scriptures of the Supreme Clarity, yet carelessly reveal their catalogues, display their contents to the unworthy, or profane the mysteries by disdaining the sacred chapters—if such offenses occur once to ten times, they shall be penalized with three years of severed merit and suspended practice, after which they may resume purification and cultivation. For offenses exceeding this, guilt shall accumulate in the Nine Yin, extending to their sevenfold ancestors, who shall be condemned to servitude in the Three Paths, bearing stones and mountains, enduring the ten torments and eight calamities. After ten thousand kalpas, they may return, but shall be reborn into the realm of the inhuman. Their own bodies shall suffer the torture of the wind-blade, lose their sight, and be maimed in form, dying as lowly ghosts. They shall never attain immortality. Those who transmit these teachings must be vigilant.",

They must not allow those of impure qi, those who have encountered defilement, or women to enter the chamber, lest they offend the divine perfected. These are the statutes observed in the world. Those who receive the scriptures must not wear clothing, footwear, or engage in improper associations; in rest, sleep, sitting, and rising, they must differ from ordinary beings.

May misfortune disperse in the Three Clarities, and blessings fill my prosperity. May the Dao’s shade flow gracefully, its blessings boundless.\n\nWhen this is done, they shall kowtow nine more times.

      "translated_text": "The gravity of the sacred statutes forbids repeated transgressions. The *Eighth Scroll of the Lower Grade* of the *Mystic Capital* states: Those who study the Dao of the Supreme Perfection and commit sins listed under the eighth entry of the upper or middle grades shall be seized by the supervisory authorities and bound for judgment before the Three Clarities. The offender must burn a *hu* of pure oil as a lamp in the central courtyard, adding more as needed until the oil is exhausted. Additionally, they shall offer ten *jin* of fine incense to a master who holds the scriptures, thereby expiating their transgressions for three years. Entering the chamber, they burn incense, face north, and kowtow nine times, confessing their offenses. Clicking the teeth twelve times, they look up and pray:\n\n\"The Heavenly Perfections are lofty and distant, their mystic radiance descending in clarity. Relying on past blessings, I have beheld the true scriptures, yet failing to grasp the profound statutes, I have slighted the celestial numina. Violating the true and transgressing the precepts, I sink my person into darkness. With rigorous self-reproach, I report to the Supreme Clarity. Henceforth, I shall purify my former form, uphold the mystic truth, and align with the Dao.\"\n\nThis done, upon the completion of three years, one observes a ninety-day retreat. If already initiated by a master, one may resume practice; if not, one must present offerings and seek the master’s transmission to study the scriptures lawfully, thereby attaining ascension.\n\nThe sacred statutes are especially weighty—transgress them not again.\n\nThe *Ninth Scroll of the Lower Grade* of the *Mystic Capital* states: Those who cultivate the Dao of the Supreme Perfection and commit sins listed under the ninth entry of the upper or middle grades shall have their offenses bound to the Great Yin and suspended for judgment before the Jade Clarity.

Clicking the teeth twenty-four times, they look up and pray:\n\n\"The jade radiance descends in splendor, illuminating the Supreme Clarity. My conduct has been irreverent, offending the precious scriptures. I fear the Four Administrations will list my sins before the Purple Court. With solemn reverence, I beseech the true numina to condescend and descend, extinguishing my offenses and dissolving my form. I pledge to uphold the profound statutes and eternally preserve my primordial integrity.\"\n\nThis done, one continues thus for a year, then observes a twenty-four-day retreat before resuming the received practices.\n\nThe sacred statutes are especially weighty—one must be vigilant and avoid further transgression.\n\nThe *Nine Perfected Statutes of the Great Mystery*, comprising three grades and twenty-seven clauses, originate from the Palace of the Numinous Capital, treasured and concealed by the Supreme Lord, never disseminated to the world below. Here, the essential methods are excerpted and transmitted to later sages to elucidate the Three Marvels, as recorded in the *Scripture of the Great Primordial Numinous Simplicity*. Those whose bones align with immortality may employ this text to expiate sins, resolve grievances, unbind knots, and dissolve obstructions. The Seven Mysteries shall vanish, and within three years, the true numina will manifest, uniting with the practitioner to ascend the Nine Heavens together. To recklessly divulge the sacred statutes incurs the same punishment as the offenses described herein. They must be treasured in secrecy and practiced discreetly.\n\nThe *Nine Perfected Scrolls of the Mystic Capital* state: The transmission of scriptural titles listed in the three grades of the Nine Perfected Statutes occurred when the Later Sage Thearch first received the scriptures from the Supreme Dao Lord. Upon bestowing the scriptures, the Supreme Lord issued the three grades of luminous statutes to assist the Three Treasures, the marvelous texts, and the scriptures of the Supreme Perfection. The statutes governing their application, along with the thirty-one scrolls, independent matters, and ritual protocols of the various scriptures, are all contained within the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*. The three grades of the Nine Perfected Statutes, with their three primordial upper scrolls, are enshrined in the palaces of the Nine Thearchs. The Four Poles, governed by the officials of the Four Administrations, oversee the prohibitions and penalties for all transgressions.\n\nThe *Luminous Statutes of the Supreme Perfection*, received by the Supreme Thearch from the Celestial King of Primordial Beginning, contain the celestial chapters and ritual protocols of the Supreme Perfection. Their methods are concealed above the Nine Heavens in the hall of the Supreme Thearch, their admonitions stored in the palaces of the Supreme Perfection, never circulated in the world. The *Luminous Statutes of the Nine Perfected* restrain later learners, while the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles* govern the four directions. Their purport is profound and subtle, existing without golden characters or jade inscriptions, unknown and unheard. Those who obtain these scrolls need not study to achieve perfection.\n\nThe statutes exist to restrain transgressions; seeing them, one must reform. To reform is to incur no deficit before Heaven and Earth; to incur no deficit is to align with spontaneity. Aligning with spontaneity enables one to ascend and supplement the ranks of the true immortals. Without the statutes, the path to immortality recedes ever further.\n\nThe *Nine Perfected Scrolls of the Mystic Capital* state: Those of utmost resolve, whose names enter the Mystic Palace and who wish to receive the luminous statutes alone to understand the celestial prohibitions before receiving the scriptures, may do so if their bones align with the Dao. Alternatively, they may first pledge an oath before transmission. The ritual implements and offerings for the oath must conform to the quantities prescribed in the *Scriptures of the Three Marvels*, as must the duration of the term. This knowledge must not be lightly divulged; to transmit it to unworthy recipients, reveal the profound texts, or violate the statutes’ intent is to consign oneself to the offices of the dead, where one’s seven ancestors and parents shall tread upon mountains of blades and forests of swords, never to be redeemed for ten thousand kalpas. Those who outwardly profess devotion but do not adhere to the statutes incur the same punishment as the offenses described therein. The prohibitions herein apply to both parties—practitioners, beware.\n\nThe *Nine Perfected Scrolls of the Mystic Capital* state: Those who receive the supreme methods yet do not uphold the luminous statutes, thereby slighting the celestial prohibitions, shall implicate their seven ancestors and themselves in punishment. Having acknowledged their errors and rigorously atoned, if they resume their practices only to transgress again, their punishment shall double. Such individuals are unaligned in bone and destiny, their forms opposed to the true. Their souls shall dwell among ghosts, and they may never again repent or resume the true scriptures. I now elucidate these statutes to awaken the unawakened. Having known them, to transgress again—what purpose does it serve? Practitioners, be vigilant.\n\n*Hymn of Praise by the Supreme Thearch*",

With reverent penance, I report to the Imperial Honored Ones, beseeching that I may now proclaim my repentance. Departing the lower realms, I ascend to become a Heavenly Immortal.\"\n\nThis done, one continues thus for a year. Upon its completion, one observes a twenty-four-day retreat before resuming the received practices, thereby attaining the descent of the true essence.",

divine candles emit their radiant glow.\nThe jade grove’s blossoms gleam resplendent, their brilliance illuminating the jeweled halls.\nThe void gives birth to natural mist, luxuriant and dense, upholding the dark net.\nThe host of perfected beings, robed in dawn’s light, offer praise; jeweled canopies rise with the wind.\nWith flying steps they chant the empty hymn, their divine songs nurturing the Dao’s growth.\nProfound and vast, the great transformation flourishes; majestic and grand, the mysterious Dao thrives.\nAccumulating study in daily resonance, when merit is complete, one enters the Great Vehicle.\nBlessings and felicity extend to all; the seven ancestors all ascend together.\nOne harnesses the chariot to ascend Mount Taihua, turning the reins toward the celestial palace.\nDivine winds stir the hollow vastness; fragrant blossoms ride the mist in dispersion.\nWith rustling steps one pays homage in the void hall, in orderly ranks one treads the dark Han.\nResonant chants move the hidden heart, delivering from the karmic roots of past afflictions.\nThe Five Sufferings dissolve in their time; flowing fragrance is inscribed in the cleansing stream.\nThe dark pass stands like a cloud-bound net; flying radiance wings the spirit chariot.\nConveying the traceless true, in profound stillness one enters the Great Void.\nRiding the void, one recites the jade scriptures; in desolate solitude, one chants the feathered texts.\nVast mindfulness knows no limit; all things abound in felicity.\n\n*Heavenly Thearch’s Hymn*\n\nThe Supreme Dao is born from silence; the dark resonance seeks its echoing sound.\nThe Three Perfected are never without unity, yet the transformations of qi follow distinct principles.\nWithin the shadowless turning of the Dharma-wheel, the ethereal vision flows in purity.\nThe congealed verses require no thought; coalescing qi merges with the dark tally.\nDivine chants arise as empty songs; in recitation, one roams the void.\nThe mysterious transformation is originally traceless; where traces arise, the Dao’s lineage is born.\nWandering the bounds of the Nine Heavens, one rests the chariot at the Six Ridge Palaces.\nLifting the loftiest guests, one returns to one’s pristine chamber.\nWithin the empty Han, the Supreme Dao resides; divine songs resound in the great void.\nThe form responds in the court of utmost stillness; through contemplation, the subtle and imperceptible commune.\nCloud-light veils the morning glow; the suspended radiance shades the jade chamber.\nThe dark dragon awaits no chariot; with rustling steps, one soars the void.\nHand plucking the seven-jeweled blossoms, the divine wind scatters wondrous fragrance.\nExquisite chants arise from the hidden heart; resplendent, they unfold the jade verses.\nThe myriad qi merge into primordial unity, all returning to the Three Mysteries’ beam.\nRiding the heavens, one does not deem them high; gazing afar, the Nine Mysteries stretch boundlessly.\nFlapping wings, one yearns for the dark reins; longing to ascend, one admires the cloudy empyrean.\nAccumulating mindfulness to invoke divine resonance, one hopes to commune with the Jade Perfected.\nDim and bright, the Celestial Han clears; drifting and floating, the radiant clouds return.\nThe Three Perfected soar into the void, guiding the reins swiftly toward the Purple Tenuity.\nWith luminous chants, they deliver the later-born; all are enabled to ride the radiance in flight.\nDelivering from the Three Paths’ hardships, the Nine Mysteries escape sorrow and lament.\n\n*Supreme Tenuity Heavenly Thearch’s Hymn*\n\nThe Supreme Perfected is born from the hollow vastness; the jeweled gauze illumines the jeweled terrace.\nCircling to pay homage in the dark capital, the host of immortals sings subtle verses.\nTurning within the traceless, the empty songs harmonize with the hidden tryst.\nDelivering the self to ascend and be born in heaven, in recitation, one accumulates the foundation of blessings.\nUrging the reins toward the Terrace of Great Radiance, from time to time one feasts upon the radiant clouds.\nDrifting and floating without bounds, one leaves suffering to enter the dark gate.\nThe mind at ease, the Dao also flows unimpeded; the cinnabar heart and the will are also distinct.\nAccumulating study with each passing day, one chants one’s pristine divine texts.\nThe Eight Radiant chariots traverse the heavens; the flying empyrean luxuriates in dark numinosity.\nThe pristine canopy rides the wind in return; in desolate vastness, one enters the Purple Clarity.\nExquisite praises of the myriad perfected hymns—how crystalline the jade echoes ring!\nUnbinding the registers of the Nine Yin, delivering the self to return to the Southern Court.\nFelicity flows universally to all; the wondrous transformation knows no lack of glory.\nPurity and stillness may be the Dao’s lineage; clarity and brightness illumine the great void.\nThe wondrous transformation arises from silence; in hidden thought, one contemplates the Three Pristine Palaces.\nAccumulating mindfulness to pierce the dark void, subtly and imperceptibly, the Supreme Dao is attained.\nKnocking and chanting, the resonance echoes in the dark stillness; no divine song fails to flourish.\nCinnabar radiance reflects the cloudy court; purple mist illumines the jade grove.\nResplendent, the seven-jeweled blossoms gleam; their brilliance sways the numinous sounds.\nThe palace and the notes naturally harmonize; the wondrous essence captivates the heart.\nThe dark chants sow the fields of blessings; the boundless mind delivers without limit.\n\n*Later Sage, Golden Portal Thearch’s Hymn*\n\nVast and boundless, the Primordial Heaven of the Origin; the Three Images merge into the dark unity.\nWith rustling steps, the true Dao flourishes; vast and expansive, the Great Vehicle soars.\nThe Six Qi return to the true court, all converging in the Mud-Pill Chamber.\nEntering and exiting, one roams the imperial palace; flowing essence illumines the sun and clouds.\nCirculating and returning to the Celestial Han, in profound stillness, one rides the dark seven.\nThe circular splendor reflects the luminous pearl; the Two Radiant Ones face the true light.\nThe numinous glow initiates the northern assembly; the dark image intermingles with Fusang.\nIn hidden deliverance, they seek one another; the yin flourishes, illuminating the Eight Directions.\nIf one can consume this essence, one shall long uphold the dark net.\nPlaying amidst the Nine Mysteries’ terraces, one rests at ease in the Western Feathered Mound.\nDivine beasts sing in the jeweled hall; flying phoenixes intermingle in flight.\nThe void gives birth to natural chants; the perfected beings sing in harmonious rhythm.\nTransforming the self in the court of kalpas’ blades, through fragrant incense, one commands the pure song.\nEstablishing merit to erect the fields of blessings, delivering the self to ascend the net.\nThe Seven Mysteries disperse from the dark palace, emerging without hindrance.\nWith flying steps, one treads the empyrean ridge; soaring on wings, one reaches the Eastern Flower Palace.\nWithin the void, the wind and clouds sing; jade sounds scatter in the jeweled hall.\nThe perfected beings chant the empty hymn; the wondrous resonance transcends the cloudy chambers.\nUnbinding my natural heart, accomplishing my kalpas’ accumulated merit.\nUttering a long cry atop the Nine Mysteries, with clear gaze, one beholds the empty sameness.\nThe dragon’s song ceases in the abode; the phoenix’s cry resounds in the Terrace of Great Radiance.\nThe empty chants leave no lingering flavor; the plaintive sounds ride the wind in dispersion.\nWho can fathom these verses?
