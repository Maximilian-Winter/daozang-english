  "full_translation": "**The Comprehensive Dao of Mystery: An Annotated Edition**\n\n**Volume One**\n*Annotated by Zhu Bian, Probationary Gentleman for Ceremonial Propriety, Acting Magistrate of Jinyun County in Kuozhou, and Trial Secretary of the Court of Judicial Review*\n\n**The Origin of the Dao**\n\nThat which arises from mutual dependence has an origin; that which is mutually attested has a return. The Great Dao has no origin; the utmost principle has no return.\n\nYet when we trace it, the origin of the Dao lies within the realm of phenomena. But to restore the nature of things and trace their origin—how distant is this!\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"Only after life does one grow white-haired; old age precedes the beginning of things.\"*\n\nThere is a thing, unformed yet complete,\nThe meaning of the Dao is this: its principle is rooted in spontaneity, its essence in emptiness and quiescence. Unlike phenomena, how can words be applied to it? Yet when we speak of \"a thing,\" it is to clarify that which is beyond things. \"Unformed\" means it harmonizes the pure and turbid; \"complete\" means it omits not even the finest particle.\n\nBorn before Heaven and Earth,\nHeaven and Earth take darkness and yellow as their colors, square and round as their forms—how could the Dao arise after such shapes and hues? It is formless yet manifest, profound and obscure,\nApprehended by reason, not by sight.\nSilent and desolate, it emits no sound;\nIt responds without echo, is heard without voice.\n\nI forcefully name it the Dao.\nWhen both form and sound are absent, names and words cannot reach it. If we wish to convey its meaning, what choice have we but to force a name? The sages’ reason for calling it the Dao is that its meaning encompasses all without exception.\n\nThe Dao is lofty beyond limit, deep beyond measure.\nGazing up, it grows ever higher; bending down, it grows ever deeper. Thus, that which has a limit is not truly lofty; that which can be measured is not truly deep. It enfolds Heaven and Earth, embracing the formless;\nIt encompasses the Two Modes, giving rise to the myriad things without leaving a trace.\n\nIts source flows forth, empty yet never full.\nFlowing from the profound, it does not sever its origin; abiding in emptiness, it does not overflow into things.\n\nThough turbid, when stilled, it gradually clarifies.\nTo be one with things is called turbidity. Yet if we take its unstained essence and gradually harmonize it, its original clarity returns. \"Gradually\" means to contain principle with ease and composure.\n\nIts application is inexhaustible.\nIt adapts to use like fire.\n\nUnbound by dawn or dusk, enduring through ten thousand ages and a thousand autumns, from now unto all that follows.\nThough its outward form fits within a single grasp, its true essence bears no trace of even the finest particle.\n\nContracted, yet able to expand—this lies in utmost simplicity; engage with it, and its reach becomes vast.\nObscure, yet able to illuminate—though shrouded in stillness and silence, it reveals the clarity of responsive brilliance.\nSupple, yet able to harden—not contending with things is called suppleness; enduring without defeat is called hardness.\n\nIt contains yin and emits yang: concealing its function is yin, manifesting its transformation is yang.\nThus it reveals the three luminaries. Through the sun, moon, and stars it is observed, enabling each to shine in its proper place.\nMountains rise by it, abysses deepen by it; beasts run by it, birds fly by it; the unicorn swims by it, the phoenix soars by it; the celestial bodies course by it.\nAll abide in the Dao of spontaneity.\n\nThe fitting of height and depth, the momentum of flight and movement, the refinement of swimming and soaring, the patterns of warp and weft—these arise without anticipation, arrive without assembly, form their course without appointed overseers.\nAll things receive it and find their proper place, equally partaking in generation and completion. Thus is it called the Great Dao.\n\nBy non-being it grasps being: that which has form is ever subject to decay; yet through formless decay it establishes the existence of the empty body.\nBy lowliness it attains eminence: that which holds rank is ever subject to demotion; yet through rankless lowliness it achieves undemoted eminence.\nBy retreat it takes the lead: that which contends is ever subject to withdrawal; yet through non-contending retreat it secures invincible precedence.\n\nOf old, the Three Sovereigns grasped the thread of the Dao, standing at the center.\nThe Three Sovereigns—Heavenly, Earthly, and Human Sovereigns—embodied the rulers who realized the Dao, perfect in pure harmony. Without governance, they transformed spontaneously; their virtue matched Heaven and Earth, guiding all things as one continuous thread. Thus were they able to lodge at the central pivot, applying its function while roaming freely without straying.\n\nSpirit and transformation prevailed, pacifying the four directions.\nRiding the principle of change and roaming through spirit, the people of the four directions each settled into their nature.\nThus, Heaven moves while Earth abides: the yang nature is firm and dynamic, the yin nature is yielding and inert.\nYet the wheel turns without ceasing, water flows without halt, accompanying things from beginning to end. Wind stirs, clouds condense, thunder roars, rain descends—all respond without end.\n\nWhen virtue harmonizes with spontaneity and governance flows in perfect accord, Heaven and Earth suffer no loss; the principle of cyclical motion remains unobstructed. Wind and rain do not deviate; the rhythms of dryness and moisture are balanced. The five phases do not clash; the six qi naturally harmonize.\nThus the sage moves with the spirit of Heaven, abides with the stillness of Earth; his commands are like wind and thunder, his beneficence like clouds and rain. Though the myriad things generate and transform without limit, he holds to the One and practices non-action, advancing alongside them.\n\nCarved and polished, they return to unhewn simplicity—restoring the nature of the ten thousand things.\nActing through non-action, it accords with the Dao: allowing things to act on their own, there is nothing it does not accomplish.\nThus things flourish in their nature while I remain ever inactive—thereby aligning with the Dao.\n\nSpeaking through non-action, it communicates through virtue: virtue is the function of the Dao; speech is the outward expression of humans.\nSpeech without intent penetrates things; things flourish in their proper order and preserve their peace. Thus, though one speaks all day, one never departs from virtue.\n\nSerene and joyful, without self-importance, one attains harmony: through absence of self-importance, one merges with the Great Harmony.\nThough the myriad things differ, each finds its ease in life: the ten thousand things vary, yet each suits its nature.\nIt harmonizes yin and yang—the Two Modes unite in harmony.\nIt regulates the four seasons—timing does not exceed its proper measure.\nIt balances the five phases—they do not encroach upon one another.\n\nIts moisture nourishes grasses and trees, seeps into metal and stone—its virtuous influence spreads widely, penetrating even the hardest substances.\nBirds and beasts grow large, their fur lustrous; eggs do not spoil, animal fetuses do not miscarry—all fulfill the qi of generation and completion.\nFathers know no grief of lost sons, elder brothers no sorrow of weeping for younger brothers; no child is orphaned, no person dies young.\nNo woman is widowed.\n\nWhen paired in proper kind, the rainbow and mirage vanish—such is the harmony of qi. Thieves and bandits do not arise, for none know the fleeting gains of ill-gotten profit. This is the fruition of embodying virtue. How perfect was the virtue of the Three Sovereigns! They ensured yin and yang never strayed, all beings followed their nature, and all befriended the Dao, becoming one with transformation—beyond naming.\n\nSome say: In the distant antiquity of great antiquity, the primal wind remained pure and unadulterated. The people lived simply, their tools uncarved and unpolished. Thus the five phases did not clash, the four seasons each kept their office, qi was concentrated and naturally softened, and all lived out their full span. Was this not the result of sagely rulers and virtuous governance, where people were transformed by their influence—could it be that the Three Sovereigns’ lack of virtue brought this about?\n\nLet us consider: The world is the body; the ruler is the heart. When the heart is disordered, the body falls ill; when the ruler is tranquil, the state is at peace. To achieve order and preserve life, merit finds its proper place.\n\nYet the Three Sovereigns arose in an age of pristine simplicity, a time entrusted to them, a path of self-governance. Had they not followed the Way of governance, forcing outcomes rather than letting things unfold naturally, temptations would have gradually arisen, and the natures of things would have been lost. The order of today is the subtle work of that primal achievement—its merit lies in non-action, its virtue unproclaimed. This is governance through non-governance, order that is not order.\n\nThe Way of Heaven gives life to things yet does not possess them; it transforms and completes yet does not dominate. Without intent, it gives life, and life arises of itself—thus it does not possess. Without intent, it transforms, and the myriad things complete themselves—thus it does not dominate. All things depend on it for life, yet none know its virtue; they depend on it for death, yet none can resent it. Where no love or aversion intervenes, how could merit or resentment find a place?\n\nIt gathers and stores without growing richer, distributes and bestows without increasing poverty. Winter’s yin consolidates, spring’s yang disperses, yet the qi of generation and destruction never wanes or overflows. Vague and indistinct, it defies representation—emerging from being and non-being, flowing through transformation, not to be grasped by any single form.\n\nElusive and fleeting, its function never exhausted—its use is inexhaustible. Profound and obscure, it responds to change without shape—its response leaves no trace. Penetrating and unobstructed, it never moves in vain—it acts only after being stirred. It coils and unfurls with hardness and softness, rises and falls with yin and yang, taking form in accord with all things.\n\nLaozi said: The \"great man\" is so called for his self-attainment. Serene and free from thought, tranquil and free from care, nothing in the world can sway his essence. He takes heaven as his canopy, earth as his chariot, merging with the all-covering and all-bearing. The four seasons are his horses, yin and yang his charioteers—thus he rides them. He travels where there are no paths, yet all is vast and open. He roams without weariness, his spirit beyond exhaustion. He emerges where there are no gates, proceeding without fixed course.\n\nTaking heaven as his canopy, there is nothing it does not cover; taking earth as his chariot, there is nothing it does not bear. The four seasons as his horses—there is nothing they do not drive. The work of generation and transformation ever operates thus. Yin and yang as his charioteers—there is nothing they do not prepare. The principle of growth and decline is thereby complete.\n\nThus, swift yet unshaken, distant yet untiring, his four limbs unmoving, his spirit roams without disturbance, his nature follows its course without fatigue. His clarity and insight remain undiminished, illuminating all under heaven—grasping the essence of the Dao, he observes the boundless realm.\n\nYet when desires arise, the myriad things surge in confusion, never attaining the mean. The six directions are open and all-pervading—knowing that form and nature meet, yet cannot be exhausted in one direction, only the spirit’s roaming can illuminate all under heaven. Grasping the essence of the Dao, is this not what is meant?\n\nProceeding without end, it is indeed fitting. Thus, the affairs of the world cannot be forced; one must follow their natural course and extend it. Affairs are vast and cannot be compelled by force—only by following the natural tendency can one move in harmony with them. The transformations of the myriad things cannot be fathomed; one must hold fast to the essential and return to it. The changes of things are boundless and cannot be exhausted by wisdom—only by grasping the unchanging essence can one meet the root of transformation.\n\nTherefore, the sage cultivates the root within and does not adorn the branches without. Nature is the root; form and tendency are the branches. He hones his spirit, stills his knowledge and perceptions, clarifies and brightens his essence, and lets his nature flow freely. He does not indulge his heart in pleasing sights nor become entangled in external things.\n\nThus, he is indifferent and non-active, yet nothing is left undone. When nature is one with things, all fulfill their \"doing.\" He does not govern, yet nothing is left ungoverned. Abandoning his own wisdom, he aligns with the self-governance of the myriad things.\n\nWhat is called \"non-action\" does not precede the actions of things—since it does not precede them, it is clear that it is not inaction, but rather acting in accordance with them. What is called \"non-governance\" does not alter the natural—since it does not alter the natural, it is not the absence of governance, but rather governing in accordance with it. \"Nothing is left ungoverned\" follows from the mutual accord of things. When self and things are in harmony, this is the meaning of mutual accord.\n\nLaozi said: He who grasps the Dao to govern the people responds to affairs as they arise and follows things as they move. He governs by following affairs and responds by following movement. The transformations of the myriad things—there is none to which he does not respond. The changes of the hundred affairs—there is none with which he does not coincide. Only with a mind free of intent can he fulfill them all.\n\nThus, the Dao is empty and nonexistent, level and easy, clear and still, soft and weak, pure and unadorned—these five are the form of the Dao. Its traces become form; its principle is the root of its body.\n\nEmptiness and nonexistence are the dwelling of the Dao—unobstructed, it can gather all. Levelness and ease are the plainness of the Dao—following the Dao, it is without ornament. Clarity and stillness are the mirror of the Dao—bright and upright, it can illuminate. Softness and weakness are the function of the Dao—embodying compliance, it pervades all. Reversion is the constancy of the Dao—returning emotion to nature, it attains constancy. Softness is the hardness of the Dao; weakness is its strength—soft, it cannot be broken; weak, it cannot be overcome. Purity and unadorned simplicity are the trunk of the Dao—this is its essence.\n\nEmptiness means nothing is carried within; levelness means the heart is unburdened. Not being laden with desires is the utmost emptiness; having no preferences or aversions is the utmost levelness. Unchanging unity is the utmost stillness—change pertains to movement. Unmixed with things is the utmost purity—mixture prevents it. Without sorrow or joy is the utmost virtue. The man of utmost virtue delights in heaven, thus he does not sorrow. Equalizing things, he has no joy.\n\nThe governance of the utmost man abandons his keen hearing and sharp sight—where there is sight he does not see, where there is hearing he does not hear. Merely exhausting the function of ears and eyes is not yet sufficient. Thus, opening and connecting the seven apertures does not limit their use to one movement. Never being enslaved, he attains the utmost in governing the body.\n\nHe eliminates ornamentation—how much less would he value external adornment beyond plainness and simplicity? He relies on the Dao and discards wisdom—resting in the open and level Dao, he abandons the wisdom of contrivance. He emerges with the people from the public—unlike them, he has no private interests. He simplifies what he holds—dwelling in essentials. He reduces what he seeks—indifferent to desires. He removes allurements and longings—he does not entice the people with cleverness nor admire the achievements of sages. He casts aside desires and discards thoughts.\n\nSimplifying what he holds brings clarity—dwelling in essentials, he is discerning. Reducing what he seeks brings attainment—not seeking, he constantly attains. Thus, with the center controlling the external, the hundred affairs are not neglected—when the center attains it, the external can be shepherded. When spirit is whole and nature complete, he exhausts the principles of nurturing form and guiding things.\n\nAttainment within the center brings peace to the five viscera, leveling thoughts—qi flows without disorder, nature remains unperturbed. Sinews and bones are strong, ears and eyes keen. The great Dao is smooth and broad, not far from the self—where is the Dao not present? How could it be distant from me? Those who seek it afar go forth and return. Deluded, they seek it outwardly; finding it within themselves, they return.\n\nLaozi said: The sage forgets about governing others and focuses on governing himself. Governing others through governance is merely using affairs to resolve affairs, yet affairs never cease. It is better to cultivate one’s nature within to attain spontaneity, so that all under heaven will be so of themselves.\n\nEach rectifies their nature and life-destiny—thus it is said: \"I practice non-action, and the people transform of themselves.\" Value lies not in power and rank, but in self-attainment; when the self is attained, all under heaven attains me. Once self-attainment is reached, there is nothing under heaven that is not attained. Allowing each to govern themselves, the myriad things attain what I have attained. Inner and outer merge in profound unity, and all under heaven fully attains—does this not exalt and illuminate the value of self-attainment above the value of power and rank?\n\nDelight lies not in wealth and nobility, but in harmony. Wealth and nobility bring only care and toil—what joy can they offer? Only those who harmonize and attain themselves wander the path of constant joy.\n\nTo know the greatness of the self and make the world small—this is to approach the Dao. The greatness of the self lies in self-attainment; to make the world small is to forget about governing others—thus one draws near to the Dao.\n\nThus it is said: \"Attain utmost emptiness, guard stillness steadfastly. The myriad things arise together, and I observe their return.\" All things, teeming and abundant, return to their root in emptiness and stillness. Therefore, one whose nature is empty and penetrating may model the ultimate Dao of heaven; one whose body is tranquil and composed may align with the profound virtue of earth.\n\nThe Dao shapes and nurtures the myriad things, beginning and ending without form. Though clay is molded into vessels, starting from something to reach completion, form and number are not without cause—thus the traces of beginning and end are clearly observable. Yet with the great smelting of the Dao, the furnace of yin and yang, the origin of creation is unseen, yet generation never ceases; the limit of its function is unfathomable, yet transformation never halts—thus the forms of beginning and end cannot be recovered.\n\nStill and unmoving, it pervades all in profound obscurity—this obscurity is like yin and yang. Movement brings rest, but stillness knows no limit; only in its quiescence is it the master of generation and transformation. Vast and boundless, it cannot be deemed external; minute and infinitesimal, it cannot be deemed internal—neither great nor small can contain it within or without. It has no walled dwelling, nor can the six directions encompass it. Yet it gives rise to the general name of being and non-being. Though it leaves no trace of coming or going, it lodges the function of being and non-being.\n\nThe Perfected Person embodies it through emptiness, simplicity, clarity, purity, softness, weakness, and unadulterated plainness—unmixed with things. By embodying it, they possess these five virtues. The ultimate virtue is the Dao of all under heaven—thus they are called the Perfected Person. Humans are one of the three powers. When their nature attains pure harmony to unite with all under heaven, they are the Perfected Person.\n\nThe Perfected Person makes the self great and the world small, values governing the self and disdains governing others—this principle has been stated above. They do not allow things to disturb their harmony, nor desires to disorder their emotions—thus preserving their authenticity. They conceal their name and identity, not seeking to display their traces. When the Dao is present, they remain hidden; the highest virtue forgets virtue, thus it is not seen. When the Dao is absent, they appear—unable to forget virtue, they manifest themselves.\n\nThey practice non-action, engage in non-affairs, and externally shepherd all things. Those whose spirit is whole and emotions and nature are complete fully grasp the principles of nurturing form and guiding things. Attainment within the center brings peace to the five viscera, leveling thoughts—qi flows without disorder, nature remains unperturbed. Sinews and bones are strong, ears and eyes keen. The great Dao is smooth and broad, not far from the self—where is the Dao not present? How could it be distant from me? Those who seek it afar go forth and return. Deluded, they seek it outwardly; finding it within themselves, they return.\n\nLaozi said: The sage forgets about governing others and focuses on governing himself.

Though clay is molded into vessels, starting from something to reach completion, form and number are not without cause—thus the traces of beginning and end are clearly observable. Yet with the great smelting of the Dao, the furnace of yin and yang, the origin of creation is unseen, yet generation never ceases; the limit of its function is unfathomable, yet transformation never halts—thus the forms of beginning and end cannot be recovered. Still and unmoving, it pervades all in profound obscurity—this obscurity is like yin and yang. Movement brings rest, but stillness knows no limit; only in its quiescence is it the master of generation and transformation.\n\nVast and boundless, it cannot be deemed external; minute and infinitesimal, it cannot be deemed internal—neither great nor small can contain it within or without. It has no walled dwelling, nor can the six directions encompass it. Yet it gives rise to the general name of being and non-being.\n\nThough it leaves no trace of origin or destination, it lodges within the function of being and non-being. The Perfected Person embodies this—thus embracing emptiness and nothingness, levelness and ease, purity and clarity, softness and weakness, simplicity and unadorned plainness—never mingling with things. By virtue of this embodiment, they possess the five virtues of power.\n\nThe supreme virtue is the Way of all under heaven, hence they are called the Perfected Person. Humanity is one of the Three Powers. When one’s nature attains pure harmony to unite with all under heaven, this is the Perfected Person. The Perfected Person deems the self great and all under heaven small, values the governance of the self and disdains the governance of others—this principle has already been set forth above. They do not allow things to disturb their harmony, for the sage forgets the governance of others and attends only to self-governance. They do not let desires disorder their emotions, thus preserving their authenticity.\n\nThey conceal their name and surname, not wishing to display their traces. When the Way is present, they remain hidden; the highest virtue forgets virtue, hence it is unseen. When the Way is absent, they appear, for they have not yet forgotten virtue and thus reveal themselves.\n\nThey act without action, engage in affairs without affairs. Laozi said: \"Affairs arise in response to change and movement; when things change, I move, and only then do affairs arise. Change is born of the times, of the moment when generation reaches its limit. Those who know the times act without fixed conduct, for they respond to change.\"\n\nThus, the Way that can be spoken is not the constant Way, for the Way is named by its capacity to encompass the ten thousand things, hence it is not confined to one Way. The name that can be named is not the constant name, for names are named by their capacity to designate things, hence they are not confined to one name.\n\nWriting arises from words, for writing records words. Words emerge from knowledge, for knowledge establishes words and records them in writing. Yet those who know do not know—this is not the constant Way. They merely constrain their knowledge to establish words, yet fail to respond to change, hence they are not constant in one Way. The name that can be named is not the repository of books, for books merely record the words of what is known; yet the names that designate things are not constant in one name, hence they cannot be contained in books.\n\nMuch learning leads to frequent exhaustion; it is better to guard the center. Those who cling to books of established words will repeatedly reach dead ends. Only by embracing and guarding harmony can one remain constantly unobstructed.\n\nAbandoning learning brings no sorrow, for worldly learning teaches through classics and rituals, instructs with propriety and righteousness, aiming to adorn the exterior to distinguish the worthy from the foolish, and to lure them toward grand conduct—thus losing their nature. The sage establishes teachings to preserve nature, hence abandoning them brings no sorrow.\n\nRejecting sageliness and discarding wisdom benefits the people a hundredfold, for sageliness is the origin of legal systems, and wisdom the beginning of schemes and plans. Since they initiate traces that disorder things and harm the source of life and nature, abandoning them brings a hundredfold benefit.\n\nHumans are born tranquil—this is the nature of heaven. The Way of heaven is tranquil, hence it generates; nature comes from heaven, hence it is tranquil. Movement follows stimulation—this harms one’s nature. When stimulated, one moves, and this harms the nature. Things arrive and one responds—this is the movement of knowledge. Things are of many kinds, and knowledge arises to distinguish them. When knowledge encounters things, likes and dislikes arise. As likes and dislikes take form, knowledge is drawn outward; knowledge, in distinguishing things, generates desires of attraction and aversion, while things, in stimulating knowledge, form appearances of beauty and ugliness. Once these take root within, one loses what is external.\n\nUnable to return to the self, the principle of heaven is extinguished. This principle is one’s nature. Therefore, the sage does not exchange heaven for humanity, does not replace heavenly nature with human desire. Externally, they transform with things, yet internally, they do not lose their essence—essence being akin to nature. Thus, those who penetrate the Way return to purity and tranquility, while those who exhaustively pursue things ultimately attain non-action. Returning to nature, one communicates with the Way; through non-action, one can exhaustively comprehend things.\n\nThey nurture wisdom with serenity, for stillness is self-reflection. They contain spirit with indifference, for emptiness ensures the spirit’s correctness. They enter through no gate—this principle has already been set forth above.\n\nThose who follow heaven wander with the Way, for yielding to nature, the spirit roams with transformation, never departing from the Way. Those who follow others associate with the vulgar, for conforming to human affairs and engaging with things through emotion is merely mingling with the common world.\n\nThus, the sage does not allow humanity to disturb heaven, does not let desires disorder emotions—this preserves their simplicity. They do not scheme yet are fitting, for without prior planning, they naturally align with affairs. They do not speak yet are trusted, for their responses never miss the mark, hence they are trusted without words. They do not deliberate yet attain, for an empty mind penetrates within, hence they achieve order without deliberation. They do not act yet accomplish, for abiding in uprightness and tranquility, they accomplish all without action.\n\nThus, when they dwell above, people do not feel burdened; when they stand before others, the multitude is not harmed. Covering all with the Way, the myriad kinds find peace—hence they are not burdensome. Guiding with virtue, all natures are harmonized—hence they are not harmed. All under heaven turn to them, and the devious fear them, for they turn to their virtue and fear their impartiality.\n\nSince they do not contend with the ten thousand things, none dare contend with them. They subdue the ten thousand things with softness, overcoming with the Way—who can compare in virtue? Laozi said: \"When people follow desires, they lose their nature, and their movements are never upright. In governing the self, this brings defilement, for desires in the self weary the body and stain conduct. In governing the state, this brings chaos, for desires in the state weary the people and disorder governance.\"\n\nThus, those who have not heard the Way have no means to return to their nature, for the Way reveals nature, and nature returns from desire. Those who are not attuned to things cannot attain purity and tranquility, for attaining principle brings understanding, and non-disturbance brings stillness.\n\nTracing human nature to its origin, it is without inner defilement, for it is received from heaven. Yet prolonged immersion in things leads to change, and change leads to forgetting the root, thus merging with that nature—\"that\" meaning the other. When one engages with things, desires arise.\n\nThe nature of water desires clarity, yet sand and stone defile it; the nature of humans desires equilibrium, yet cravings and desires harm it. Only the sage can forsake things and return to the self, abandoning the objects of craving and desire to return to the pure and tranquil self.\n\nThus the sage does not allow the self to be enslaved by things. Abiding in the wondrous, how can things burden him? How could he accept servitude? He does not let desire disrupt harmony, so his joy is not exuberant—tranquil contentment brings no elation. His sorrow is not mournful—what lament is there in well-ordered governance?\n\nTherefore, though exalted he is not imperiled, though secure he does not topple. Forgetting rank to share the people’s lot, he does not endanger his eminence. Forgetting rank to share their hardships, he does not overturn his stability. Thus, when good counsel and expedient plans are heard, even the foolish delight in them; when the sage’s virtue and lofty conduct are praised, even the unworthy yearn for them. Many delight in such words, yet few employ them; many admire such deeds, yet few practice them. The reason lies in being shackled by things and bound by custom.\n\nIn life, all desire to discern the myriad forms, to stand solitary and noble, to heed teachings of goodness, and to bask in the light of certain strategies. Even the coarse and ignorant—do they lack such aspirations? Yet daily they drift with things, long immersed in custom. Before righteousness prevails, how can it reach them?\n\nThus it is said: \"Practice non-action, and the people transform themselves.\" Follow their actions and act accordingly, and though I do nothing, the people transform themselves. \"I take no action, and the people enrich themselves\"—without the disturbance of taxes and levies, the people naturally prosper. \"I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves\"—without contrived laws and teachings to lure them, the people attain the integrity of their nature. \"I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity\"—without the disruption of passions and cravings, the people preserve the uncarved purity of their nature.\n\nClarity and stillness are the perfection of power; the highest virtue is without virtue, ever clear and still. Gentleness and weakness are the function of the Way, for they can subdue the rigid and violent—this is the Way’s efficacy. Emptiness, tranquility, and contentment are the ancestors of the myriad things, for things arise from nothingness and are nurtured by harmony.\n\nWhen these three are practiced, they merge into formlessness. Though named as three, in essence they are one; yet this one is not a singularity—it may be called formless. Formlessness is the designation of the one, for it lodges the formless within unity. The one, without fixation, harmonizes with all under heaven. Without fixation, it permeates form, yet cannot fully unite with the myriad kinds.\n\nVirtue is ceaselessly bestowed—the one, clothing things to perfect power. Since things are inexhaustible, virtue knows no end. Its use is not toilsome, without labor or rest. It is seen yet unseen—no form is visible. It is heard yet unheard—no sound is audible.\n\nFrom formlessness, forms arise; from soundlessness, the five notes resound; from tastelessness, the five flavors take shape; from colorlessness, the five hues emerge. Thus being arises from non-being, substance from emptiness. The body of the Way is emptiness, yet it gives birth to all forms, sounds, flavors, and colors—none exist without it.\n\nThe number of notes does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five notes are beyond hearing—when gong and zhi form patterns, the ear is confounded. The number of flavors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five flavors are beyond tasting—when sweet and sour harmonize, the palate is refreshed. The number of colors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five colors are beyond viewing—when dark and yellow intermingle, the eye is dazzled.\n\nWhen gong is established, the five notes take shape—gong is the sovereign of sound. When sweetness is established, the five flavors are determined—sweetness is the master of flavor. When white is established, the five colors are complete—white is the root of color. When the one is established, the myriad things are born—the one is the designation of nothingness.\n\nThe multitude or paucity of numbers all arise from the one; the greatness or smallness of things all originate from nothingness. Tracing nothingness, one may grasp the forms of all under heaven. Abiding in the one, one can encompass the root of the myriad names. Thus, when the one is established as the standard, the myriad things are born.\n\nThe principle of the one extends throughout the four seas; the discernment of the one pervades heaven and earth. There is no distance it does not reach, no height or depth it does not illuminate. In its wholeness, it is simple and thick like uncarved wood—complete and undecorated. In its dispersion, it is vast and turbid like muddied water—mingling with things and sharing their dust.\n\nThough turbid, it gradually clarifies; though empty, it gradually fills. Vast and tranquil like great waters, drifting like floating clouds, it seems not to exist yet exists, seems to vanish yet remains. Its form is without substance, its traces gone yet its response present.\n\nLaozi said: \"The sum of the myriad things all passes through one aperture; the root of a hundred affairs all emerges from one gate\"—none do not proceed from it. Thus the sage follows a single standard, unwavering in principle, unchanging in constancy. He follows the tracks of heaven’s Way, not altering his nature with the vicissitudes of affairs. He takes the plumb line as his model, the marking cord as his guide; the crooked conforms to the straight, the straight to the constant.\n\nSince the nature of things is manifold, without abandoning the guiding principles of the Way, he can preserve their integrity in all its curvature. Joy and anger are the Way’s excesses—immoderation is not upright. Sorrow and grief are the loss of power—failure to attain self-mastery. Fondness and aversion are the heart’s transgressions—errors of attachment. Cravings and desires are the burdens of life—excesses in nurturing life.\n\nGreat anger shatters yin; great joy topples yang—yin governs solemnity and decay, yang governs harmony and delight. When these are expressed as joy and anger, they lack restraint. Virtue is ceaselessly bestowed—the one, clothing things to perfect power. Since things are inexhaustible, virtue knows no end. Its use is not toilsome, without labor or rest. It is seen yet unseen—no form is visible. It is heard yet unheard—no sound is audible.\n\nFrom formlessness, forms arise; from soundlessness, the five notes resound; from tastelessness, the five flavors take shape; from colorlessness, the five hues emerge. Thus being arises from non-being, substance from emptiness.\n\nThe essence of the Dao is emptiness and nothingness, yet from it arise all forms, substances, sounds, and colors. The numbers of tones do not exceed five, yet the variations of the five notes are inexhaustible to the ear; when gong and zhi combine into patterns, they confuse the ear. The numbers of flavors do not exceed five, yet the variations of the five tastes are inexhaustible to the palate; when sweet and sour harmonize, they delight the mouth. The numbers of colors do not exceed five, yet the variations of the five hues are inexhaustible to the eye; when dark and yellow intermingle, they dazzle the sight.\n\nIn sound, when gong is established, the five notes take shape—gong is the ruler of tones. In flavor, when sweet is established, the five tastes are determined—sweet is the master of flavors. In color, when white is established, the five colors are completed—white is the root of hues. In the Dao, when the One is established, the myriad things are born. The One is called \"nothingness.\" The multitude or paucity of numbers all arise from the One. The greatness or smallness of things all originate from nothingness. Tracing back to nothingness, one may grasp the forms of all under heaven. Abiding in the One, one can encompass the root of all names. Thus, when the One is established as a term, the myriad things are born.\n\nThe principle of the One extends throughout the four seas; the discernment of the One pervades heaven and earth. There is nowhere it does not reach, no height or depth it does not illuminate. In its wholeness, it is honest and simple as uncarved wood, complete and undecorated. In its dispersion, it is vast and turbid, mingling with things and sharing their dust. Though turbid, it gradually clears; though empty, it gradually fills—this meaning has been shown above. Vast as great waters, drifting like floating clouds, deep and boundless without shore, coming and going without attachment. As if absent yet present, as if perished yet existing—its form is without substance, its traces vanish yet its responses remain.\n\nLaozi said: \"The sum of the myriad things all passes through a single aperture—the Dao is the gateway of generation and transformation. The roots of all affairs emerge from a single gate—none do not proceed from it.\" Thus, the sage follows a single track, not altering what is constant, not changing what is eternal, adhering to the path of heaven’s course without losing constancy amid changing affairs. Setting standards by the plumb line, bending follows the straight, straightness follows the constant. As the natures of things are manifold, without abandoning the Dao’s guiding principles, one can preserve their natures through flexibility.\n\nJoy and anger are the heart of the Dao—excess in them is not upright. Sorrow and grief are the loss of virtue—one cannot attain self-mastery. Likes and dislikes are the transgressions of the heart—errors of attachment. Cravings and desires are the burdens of life—excesses in nurturing life. Great anger shatters yin; great joy topples yang—yin governs solemnity and decay, yang governs harmony and delight. When these are expressed as joy and anger, they lack restraint. When the spirit is profoundly penetrating, it unites with the original true substance. The Dao is inherently possessed by humans, free from even the slightest desire—is this not the perfection of truth? Holding the mysterious virtue in the heart, transformation swiftly flows through the spirit. The transformation of non-action leaves no traces of virtue, hence it is called \"mysterious.\" The true person has no mind, yet things follow—thus their transformation is not swift yet seems to rush.\n\nTherefore, the Dao that cannot be spoken of is vast and boundless. The teaching that cannot be voiced spreads its transformation widely. Issuing commands and decrees to shift customs and mores depends solely on the conduct of the heart. The origin of commands lies in the transformation of virtue. Thus, when mysterious virtue clothes things, there is no need for teaching or decrees, yet customs naturally shift. From this, we know that the mysterious Dao resides in the heart without intention, yet acts.\n\nThe myriad things have their origins, yet only the root is known; all affairs have their sources, yet only the gate is guarded. Stillness can know the root of things; compliance can guard the source of affairs. Thus, one can exhaust the inexhaustible and reach the limitless—for only in clarity and emptiness can one exhaust and reach them. Illuminating things without dazzlement, responding to echoes without cessation—emptiness and stillness can reflect and respond.\n\nLaozi said: \"Those who attain the Dao have weak aspirations yet accomplish strong deeds—their wills, compliant and weak, achieve success through strength. Their hearts are empty yet their responses are fitting—unburdened within, their responses are without error.\" The so-called ultimate weakness is gentle, soft, tranquil, and still. The Dao takes non-change as its aspiration, not the utmost of self-strength. Thus, it is as soft as down, clinging to the body without rising. Concealed in not daring, acting in inability—between action and concealment, there is non-action and no trace. Serene and inactive, movement does not miss its time—action lies in response, so what is lost?\n\nThus, the noble takes the lowly as its root, the high takes the low as its foundation, the small embraces the great—all mean that dwelling in humble weakness and smallness completes the greatness of virtue and power. Being centered controls the external—when the heart attains, things attain. Acting with softness yet strength, power is invincible, and no enemy can overcome it. Responding to transformations and measuring the times, nothing can harm it. Without calculation, it follows the times to respond, so the times do not fail it, and things do not harm it.\n\nThose who desire hardness must guard it with softness; those who desire strength must preserve it with weakness. Accumulating softness becomes hardness; accumulating weakness becomes strength. Observe what is accumulated to know survival or demise—this is the principle and tendency. Hardness conquers what is inferior to itself, yet when it encounters its equal, it is blocked. Softness conquers what surpasses itself—its power is immeasurable. Thus, what it conquers surpasses its equal. Moreover, what hardness conquers is inferior to itself. Now, what softness conquers is its equal—thus, the victory of softness is great, and how can the power of hardness compare?\n\nTherefore, when armies are strong, they perish; when wood is hard, it breaks; when leather is stiff, it splits. Teeth are firmer than the tongue yet perish first. Thus, softness and weakness are the stems of life, while hardness and strength are the companions of death.\n\nQi finds harmony in softness and weakness, while form suffers illness in hardness and strength—how much more so in the human Dao, where likes and dislikes reveal what is beneficial and harmful. To initiate is the path to exhaustion, while to follow is the source of success. Directing affairs often leads to failure; adapting to things brings constant success.\n\nOne who holds to the Dao to meet change—whether first or last—controls the other. Why? Because they do not lose the means to control others, nor can others control them. Holding to the Dao in its fullness to respond to shifting circumstances allows one to correct oneself through adaptation.\n\nThus, abiding in stillness and perceiving change enables the first to control the last. Observing change and returning to stillness enables the last to control the first. In both, control lies within oneself, no longer swayed by the vulgar. The so-called \"later\" aligns with the numerical order and accords with the moment. Following the inevitable pattern and seizing the opportune time for action is the subtlety of holding back.\n\nThe vicissitudes of time allow no pause—change is the transformation of the hour. Principle admits no interruption; there is no gap between them. To act first is to overreach; to act later is to fall short. To control before things change is to miss the moment. To control after they change is to confront a fait accompli.\n\nThe sun revolves and the moon completes its cycle—time does not linger for man. Thus, the sage does not prize jade disks a foot wide but values an inch of shadow, for time is hard to gain and easy to lose. Only the sage seizes the opportune moment. Therefore, the sage acts in accord with the times and achieves success by relying on available resources. Affairs can thus be fully accomplished, and merit can be steadily established.\n\nAbiding in the Dao of stillness and restraining the feminine principle—guarding the Dao of emptiness and quiet enables discernment of the moment; restraining the feminine and yielding principle enables adaptation to things. Responding to change through compliance, always following and never leading, soft and weak in stillness, composed and settled in tranquility—dwelling in constant virtue with ease. Thus, great merit overcomes all obstacles, and none can contend with it.\n\nPossessing yet appearing empty, things naturally submit. Laozi said: \"A mind that harbors schemes and devices within is not pure and unadulterated.\" To act in response to movement is inexhaustible in application. Emptying oneself of all else, one returns to simplicity. Relying on cunning and skill only disturbs stillness and introduces impurity.\n\nOne whose spiritual power is not complete within cannot embrace what is distant. Only with spiritual wholeness can one reach the ultimate transformation; only with complete virtue can one restore things. The beauty of returning to the distant lies entirely within oneself.\n\nWhen the mind is free of harmful intent, one may grasp the tail of a starving tiger—how much more so with men? Alike yet not identical, avoidance lies in resolve. Now, utterly desireless, one takes the Creator as form. Even the fiercest and most resolute, without provocation, cannot harm.\n\nThus, those who embody the Dao are at ease yet never exhausted; those who rely on calculations labor without success. *Calculations here refer to manipulative techniques.*\n\nTo govern through harsh laws and punishments is not the work of true kingship. Relying on harsh laws to refine punishments only proves that spiritual power is incomplete and insufficient to transform the world. Frequent use of the whip and rod is not the way to guide a chariot to distant lands. Excessive reliance on the whip reveals a loss of natural control, rendering one unable to endure the long journey.\n\nExcessive likes and dislikes invite misfortune to follow. Thus, the laws of the former kings were not of their own making but were based on existing conditions. They adapted to the times, adding or subtracting to implement teachings—not creating laws to flaunt their ability. Their prohibitions and punishments were not self-imposed but were upheld. They maintained prohibitions to instill fear in the people, not to display their authority.\n\nThus, adaptation leads to greatness, while contrivance leads to pettiness. Steadfastness ensures stability, while forced action leads to failure. Those who rely on ears and eyes to listen and see exhaust their minds without clarity. Those who govern through cunning and planning wear themselves out without success.\n\nWhen a ruler illuminates the four directions and comprehends the four corners, perfect governance is achieved with ease. Relying on the talent of a single person is insufficient for good governance—for even one person’s ability cannot manage a three-acre homestead. Strength and wisdom extend no further.\n\nFollowing the natural patterns of the Dao and aligning with the inherent nature of heaven and earth, even the six directions cannot be made equal. Moreover, harmonizing with the essence of things and their inherent principles is the inevitable course. Thus, though the world be vast, without exhausting wisdom or strength, the myriad transformations naturally attain balance.\n\nHe who trusts his ears will falter in hearing; he who trusts his eyes will be dazzled by sight. Praise and blame mislead the ear, while dazzling colors seduce the eye. Ritual propriety is insufficient to manifest love, but sincerity of heart can embrace what is distant. Those who scrutinize ritual merely refine its forms; the heart that seeks to love may yet fail to achieve it. Only by extending sincerity throughout the world can one evoke a response.\n\nThus, in warfare, nothing is more perilous than the will sharpened like a sword—such resolve disrupts harmony and poisons the art of war. No enemy is greater than yin and yang, yet the war drum is but a trifle. When joy and anger assail one another, the enemy is at its most severe. The so-called great enemy leaves corpses uncounted, its unchecked commands harming the people. The middle enemy lurks in the mountains, seizing advantage from hidden strongholds. The petty enemy hides among the people, engaging in stealth and theft.\n\nThus it is said: when the people abound in cunning, strange artifices proliferate. Excessive cleverness breeds skill, and skill breeds pride in ability. Carving and adorning the unadorned, they deceive the world with falsity. The more laws and decrees are promulgated, the more thieves and bandits arise. Seeking to halt theft by cutting off profit, even with a profusion of strict laws, only leads to theft of the laws themselves, increasing the number of offenders. Abandon one path and take another, and heavenly calamity will not arise. Forsake the laws of cunning and cleverness, embrace the uncarved simplicity of non-action, and the reproaches of heaven will cease.\n\nThus, to govern the state with cleverness is to plunder it; relying solely on one’s own wisdom is to harm the people. To govern the state without cleverness is to bestow virtue upon it. Governing by following the natural course, all things attain their true nature.\n\nThe formless is vast, the formed is small; spiritual transformation is boundless and thus great, while the myriad things have limits and thus are small. The formless is many, the formed is few; the unfathomable is many, the visible is few. The formless is strong, the formed is weak; it masters things and thus is strong, while things are mastered and thus are weak. The formless is real, the formed is hollow; the enduring is real, the transient is hollow.\n\nThe formed brings things to completion, the formless initiates them. Completion produces vessels, initiation produces the uncarved. The formed has sound, the formless has none. When scattered into vessels, names arise. Returning to the Dao, names cannot be found. The formed arises from the formless, thus the formless is the origin of the formed.\n\nBreadth and thickness bear names, and what bears a name is esteemed and valued. Frugality and thinness are nameless, and the nameless is base and light. Breadth and thickness are the world’s fine reputation. Frugality and thinness are the Daoist’s pure virtue. What the world values is elevated by its name; what I relinquish is entrusted to its reality. The sage holds to the Dao in humility and frugality, making these the foundation of breadth and thickness. Embracing virtue without wavering, he returns to the root of merit and fame.\n\nThe following lines are of the same import: abundance and wealth bear names, and what bears a name is honored and cherished. Poverty and scarcity are nameless, and the nameless is lowly and despised. The male and potent bear names, and what bears a name is manifest and illustrious. The female and yielding are nameless, and the nameless is subtle and restrained. Surplus bears a name, and what bears a name is exalted and wise. Deficiency is nameless, and the nameless is content with lowliness. Merit bears a name, lack of merit is nameless.\n\nBreadth, thickness, abundance, and wealth are the fruits of having. Frugality, thinness, poverty, and scarcity are the fruits of not having. Names arise from visible traces; where traces are faint, names do not reach. Thus the world esteems merit as fine, while the Dao values the nameless as virtue. The named arises from the nameless; the nameless is the mother of the named. Dwelling in the namelessness of frugality and scarcity, one attains the fullness of honor and nobility.\n\nThe Way of heaven is such that being and non-being give rise to one another, and difficulty and ease complete one another. Form and nature arise from the interplay of being and non-being; the principles of affairs arise from the interplay of difficulty and ease. Not knowing how this is so is called the Way of heaven. Therefore, the sage holds to the Dao in emptiness, stillness, subtlety, and mystery, thereby perfecting virtue. To hold to the nameless Dao is to achieve great virtue.\n\nThus, with the Dao comes virtue, with virtue comes merit, with merit comes fame, and with fame one returns to the Dao. Forgetting the fame of saving the world, one reverts to the non-action of the Dao. With enduring merit and fame, one remains free from blame throughout life. The merit of no-merit endures; the fame of forgotten fame—what blame could there be?\n\nKings and dukes possess merit and fame, while the orphaned and widowed have none. Thus the sage calls himself orphaned and widowed, returning to his root. All great achievements and illustrious reputations arise from humility. Therefore, the orphaned and widowed are the titles of kings and dukes, for humility is their foundation.\n\nAchieving merit without claiming it, one uses merit for benefit and the nameless for application. The merit of aiding the world borrows the lives of the multitude for benefit; the nameless Dao entrusts its application to the great. In ancient times, the people were simple and unknowing, unaware of east or west. They were utterly unadorned. Their appearance did not depart from their true nature; form and spirit were united. Words did not outstrip deeds; speech and action were one. Their gait was unadorned, free of affectation. Their speech was plain, unembellished. Their clothes provided warmth without ornament, serving only to ward off the cold. Their weapons were blunt and edgeless, for they knew not the art of cunning harm.\n\nThey walked with carefree abandon, their gaze unfocused and wandering. They drank from wells and ate from the fields they tilled, seeking nothing beyond their immediate needs. They neither gave nor sought, each content with sufficiency. High and low did not vie with one another, long and short did not compare. They harbored no thoughts of right or wrong.\n\nThe winds align with customs, and so one may follow them—when customs are uniform, they may be followed. Affairs match abilities, and so they are easily done—when undertakings suit one’s capacity, they are easily accomplished. To pride oneself on deceit to delude the world, or to act with obstinacy to mislead the multitude—these the sage does not take as the people’s customs.\n\nFor if a ruler exalts false appearances to disorder governance and teaching, or persists in perverse conduct to confuse the masses, then customs will diverge and fail to unify, and affairs will not align with ability. Thus, the sage does not employ such means as the foundation of governance.\n\n*Comprehensive Mystery Scripture, Scroll One (end)*\n*Comprehensive Mystery Scripture, Scroll Two*\n*Annotated by Zhu Bian, Probationary Gentleman for Manifest Propriety, Acting Secretary of the Court of Judicial Review, and Magistrate of Jinyun County in Kuozhou*\n\n**Essay on Refined Sincerity**\n\nRefinement begins with investigating the subtlest truths; sincerity is the perfection of simplicity and utmost clarity. When these two names are fulfilled, one may move all things and penetrate the Dao.\n\nLaozi said: Heaven attains its height, earth attains its depth, the sun and moon shine, the stars and constellations gleam, yin and yang harmonize—not through any deliberate action. This is the response of utmost refinement, yet one knows not how it comes to be, as though a true master were present.\n\nAlign with the Dao, and things are naturally so. All things possess their own inherent Dao; if one can accord with them without transgression, then things attain their nature and govern themselves. Yin and yang, the four seasons—they do not generate the myriad things. Rain and dew fall in their time—not to nurture grasses and trees. Heaven’s constant virtue and things’ regular growth arise without knowledge of their source; each simply grows of itself.\n\nWhen spirit connects and yin-yang harmonizes, the myriad things are born. When spirits interact, mechanisms respond; when qi converges, forms arise. To fathom their origin, refined sincerity may be discerned.\n\nThe Dao conceals essence within, for the sake of ending frivolous song. It lodges spirit in the heart, for the sake of shedding encumbrances. Serene and tranquil, it delights and unites within the breast, harmonious yet without attachment. Vast and formless, silent and soundless.\n\nThose who embody the Dao enact transformations without trace and teachings without words. Offices and courts seem devoid of affairs; courts and halls seem devoid of people. Each governs itself, so there are no affairs; non-action prevails, so there are no people. No recluses, no idle folk—when governance accords with the Dao, where would they hide or stray? No forced labor, no unjust punishments—with non-action and impartiality, how could there be grievances or toil?\n\nThe world looks up to the ruler’s virtue, emulating the sovereign’s intent. When the sage presides above, all under heaven submit to his purity and stillness, mirroring his desireless aim. Distant lands and alien customs, none fail to come through repeated translation—not because he visits each household or meets each person, but because virtue, through compliance, transforms all, near and far.\n\nExtend one’s sincere heart to the world, and that is all. When the heart is sincere, things respond. If a ruler extends sincerity, nothing fails to answer. Thus, rewarding the good and punishing the violent are policies, but what enables their execution is refined sincerity. When trustworthiness and integrity are firmly established, policies will be carried out; when rewards and punishments are impartial, the people know encouragement.\n\nThough commands may be clear, they cannot act alone; they must await refined sincerity. Therefore, to unite the Dao and bestow it upon the people yet fail to be followed is because refined sincerity is not all-encompassing. That which is refined must be excellent; that which is sincere must respond.\n\nLaozi said: Heaven sets the sun and moon, arrays the stars and constellations, unfolds the four seasons, and regulates yin and yang. The three luminaries and four qi never depend on one another; observing their spontaneity, each transforms alone. The sun dries things by day, the night lets them rest, the wind desiccates them, rain and dew moisten them.\n\nIn generating things, none see how they are nourished, yet the myriad things grow—things receive life and grow of themselves, without any nourisher. In destroying things, none see how they perish, yet the myriad things die—things observe their own transformations, without any destroyer. This is called spirit and illumination. That which cannot be fathomed in its origin is called spirit; that which inevitably changes is called illumination.\n\nThus, the sage models himself on this. When fortune arises, one does not see its cause, yet fortune arises—the world’s blessings lie in the sage’s Dao being practiced. When virtue aligns with the times, how can there be traces? When misfortune is removed, one does not see its source, yet misfortune is removed—preserving the fortune of the Dao’s practice, there may be adversity, but when sagely governance nurtures order, nothing can be perceived.\n\nScrutiny finds no origin of removal or rise; investigation confirms the reality of fortune and misfortune. Daily reckoning falls short; yearly reckoning yields surplus. Measuring progress day by day, it seems insufficient; yet in the end, affairs are completed, as virtue is perfected over time. Silent and soundless—only subtle resonance remains.\n\nA single word that profoundly moves all under heaven—this is called utmost sincerity, by which the heart of heaven is stirred to transform. Without intent, it yet elicits response. Sincerity takes form within qi, moving heaven: auspicious stars appear, yellow dragons descend, phoenixes arrive, sweet springs flow, fine grains grow, rivers do not overflow, and seas remain calm without surging waves. When sincerity reaches luminous clarity, such correspondences arise.\n\nTo defy heaven and ravage the world is to invite the sun and moon’s obscuration, the five planets’ errant paths, the four seasons’ disorder—this is called qi exceeding its proper measure. Day darkens while night shines, mountains collapse and rivers run dry, winter thunders and summer frosts—when qi steams upward in excess, such portents occur. Heaven and humanity share a means of mutual resonance; disasters and auspices arise from what is thus evoked.\n\nThus, when a state declines toward ruin, celestial patterns shift, the age falls into chaos, and rainbows appear—all things are interconnected, and essence-qi presses closely upon one another. The entanglement of forms, the encroachment of qi—all are signs of lost alignment. Therefore, the workings of spirit and illumination cannot be achieved through cunning or force, nor can they be attained by sheer effort. Only through perfect sincerity and utmost truth may governance be established.\n\nThus, the great person harmonizes virtue with heaven and earth, luminosity with the sun and moon, numinous power with ghosts and spirits, and trustworthiness with the four seasons. Embracing the heart of heaven, they harbor no private intent; holding the qi of earth, they follow tranquility as their nature. Grasping the central void and embracing harmony, they wield the central void to settle all affairs and contain harmony to govern the myriad beings. Without leaving the hall, their virtue and beneficence extend to the four seas.\n\nThe transformation of customs and the people’s shift toward goodness arise as if naturally—this is the power of spiritual transformation. Governance lies within oneself; without spiritual transformation, who else could be entrusted with it?\n\nLaozi said: \"For the human Way, to preserve one’s nature and safeguard authenticity, never harming the self—this is the constant Dao of humanity. When pressed by urgency or adversity, essence penetrates heaven.\" The supreme mystery’s mirror is impartial and luminous. Utmost sincerity moves it, and there is nothing it does not respond to—thus in conflict or distress, none fail to be resolved through sincerity. Though not yet fully aligned with spontaneity, this is still a momentary attainment. As for those who never depart from their root—what could they not accomplish? To take essence and sincerity as one’s root is to leave nothing unachieved.\n\nDeath and life share the same realm; they cannot be coerced or overborne. One who equalizes life and death cannot be threatened by death. How much more so for those who govern heaven and earth, embrace the myriad beings, reverse creation, and contain utmost harmony—have they ever truly died? Knowing that death and life occupy the same domain, one does not lightly fear; how much less so for those who embody the Dao, encompassing heaven and earth, merging with transformation and harmony, becoming one with the Creator—could they not attain undying longevity?\n\nEssence and sincerity take form within, and their resonance reaches the hearts of others—this is the untransmitted Dao. When essence and sincerity are inwardly manifest and outwardly align with human hearts, this arises from the deepest sincerity, far beyond what words can convey. When the sage occupies the throne, dwelling in the Dao without speech, their beneficence extends to the myriad people—thus the teaching without words is vast indeed.\n\nWhen the center is empty, things follow; when the body is upright, the people emulate. Is not the transformation of daily life equally vast? When ruler and minister diverge in heart, deceit and treachery appear in heaven, and the resonance of spirit and qi grows faint. The ruler embodies the Way of governance and transformation, while the minister carries it to completion—gains and losses are shared, fortunes and misfortunes move as one. Yet if discordant hearts breed cunning, causing perverse qi to rise and steam upward, then the Way of spiritual transformation will find no resonance. This is what is meant by \"the eloquence of silence\" and \"the Dao that cannot be spoken.\"\n\nThe former refers to the teaching without words, the latter to the Dao beyond speech. To summon the distant, let there be non-action; for those nearby, let there be no affairs. When governance and instruction multiply, taxes and labor grow burdensome—then those close at hand cannot attend to their tasks, and those far away cannot hold their duties in mind. Thus the Way of heaven is non-action, responding without call; the sage is without affairs, drawing near without seeking.\n\nOnly the night-walker may possess it—silently employing it in accord with yin, its virtue nears the Dao most closely. Thus the turning back of galloping steeds to manure the fields: the reckless rush of desires is likewise called \"galloping steeds\"; manure, then, can fatten and nourish the sprouting shoots. Therefore the enlightened ruler outwardly turns back the gallop of warhorses to enrich the fields and gardens, and inwardly removes the rushing torrent of desires to cultivate virtue and the Dao. When no chariot tracks reach beyond distant lands, this is called \"sitting still while racing, sinking while afloat.\" With hands folded and seated in governance, transformation spreads to far-off lands—silently acting without trace is to dwell on land yet sink as if submerged.\n\nThe Way of heaven approaches without partiality, departs without partiality; without favor or bias, it does not involve itself in coming or going. The capable have abundance, the clumsy fall short; those who follow it gain advantage, those who oppose it meet misfortune. Those who accord with the principles of nature act with surplus benefit; those who rely on the surface of cunning and calculation find themselves powerless and doomed. Thus those who govern by wisdom struggle to maintain the state; only those who align with the Great Harmony and hold to natural response can truly possess it. When the heart of heaven’s Way accords with the seasons and principles, this is called the Great Harmony.\n\nIf the ruler severs cleverness and artifice to align with harmony, and holds to impartiality in responding to things, then he may be entrusted with safeguarding the world. Laozi said: The Dao and virtue are like rawhide and tanned leather—distance makes them seem near, nearness makes them seem distant; examined, they cannot be grasped; scrutinized, they do not deceive. The Dao and virtue lodge their use in being and non-being; rawhide and leather manifest their sound in emptiness and solidity. They respond when moved, yet when sought, they have no fixed form. Truly, they are beyond the measure of the heart and mind—how much more beyond the reach of ears and eyes?\n\nThus the sage is like a mirror: neither leading nor welcoming, responding yet not storing, leaving the myriad things unharmed. Impartial, he entrusts things to their own nature, and transformation comes to meet him. By following and responding to them, he remains unharmed. What he gains is thus what he loses—if he clings to what he has gained in his breast, he loses its wondrous use. What he loses is thus what he gains—only in utter emptiness can reflection occur.\n\nTherefore, one who penetrates the Great Harmony is darkly serene as if steeped in pure wine, sweetly drifting within it, as if never having left its source—this is called the Great Permeation. The sweet intoxication of rich wine still preserves the portion of perfect peace and rest; in profound accord with inner and outer, it harmonizes with the unity of heaven and earth. If one releases the heart into the realm of self-attained origin, roams the spirit in the boundless expanse, though traces mingle with things, what hindrance remains? This is the feigned disuse that accomplishes its use. The world deems emotion and cleverness as disuse, yet here, this feigned disuse pairs with the uses of a thousand transformations.\n\nLaozi said: In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor’s governance of the world harmonized the movements of the sun and moon, regulated the qi of yin and yang, ordered the measures of the four seasons, corrected the calculations of pitch pipes and calendars, distinguished male and female, and clarified superior and inferior—these were the creations of ritual and law. In the age of the Yellow Emperor, the people had lost their true simplicity, and artifice and deceit arose; cunning and force came to the fore. Thus he looked up to observe and bent down to examine, governing through change and non-action. Though this truly benefited his time, none foresaw the troubles of ten thousand generations.\n\nHe ensured the strong did not overpower the weak, the many did not oppress the few; the people preserved their lives without premature death, the seasons ripened without famine. The hundred officials were upright and impartial, superiors and inferiors harmonized without blame; laws and commands were clear and not obscured, aides were just and not sycophantic. Farmers yielded boundaries, roads left no lost items, markets had no fraudulent pricing—thus the achievements of his governance were manifest. At that time, the sun, moon, and stars did not stray from their courses; wind and rain came in season; the five grains flourished; phoenixes soared in the courtyards, and qilin roamed the outskirts—such were the responses of virtue in action.\n\nWhen Fuxi ruled the world, he rested his head on a square pillow and slept on a straight mat, emulating autumn’s harvest and winter’s storage. The dark sage’s actions did not transgress heaven’s net, so his bedding was square and straight. Autumn’s things reach maturity, winter’s things lie hidden—this is returning to the root. Thus the sage followed the reaping of these two seasons, restraining and completing filial piety, embodying the virtue of returning to the root. Bearing the square earth, embracing the round heaven, the Dao encompasses heaven and earth.\n\nThe yin and yang they embrace. Where there is obstruction and blockage, the apertures and principles regulate it. When virtue harmonizes with the Great Harmony, qi governs itself. Those who oppose qi and violate things, harming the people through excessive accumulation—cut them off. Once heaven and earth are at peace, disasters vanish of themselves.\n\nAt that time, the people were like unknowing children, unaware of east or west, walking unsteadily, seeing dimly, yet content in their simplicity, not knowing whence they came—this has already been seen in the *Dao Yuan* chapter. Floating and drifting, they knew not their origin; without nurture, they knew not their destination. Not yet cherishing their kin, they took things as their root. Since things were but temporary lodgings, their root had nowhere to go. Those who floated without nurture were all unbound and unmoored.\n\nIn that age, birds and beasts, insects and snakes—none failed to sheathe their claws and fangs, conceal their stings and poisons, for they knew not how to prey upon one another. Their merit measured up to heaven and earth. The merit of non-action was thus comparable to heaven and earth.\n\nYet the Yellow Emperor humbled himself beneath the Great Ancestor, though his deeds went unproclaimed, his name unheralded. Not proclaiming his deeds, his deeds were already proclaimed; not heralding his name, his name was already heralded. When the Yellow Emperor vanquished Chiyou on the fields of Zhuolu, though he removed a scourge, he returned to the Great Ancestor, and his traces of reverence and deference were already manifest for posterity. \"Humbled,\" here, denotes a modest and unassuming demeanor.\n\nHe concealed the Way of the True Man, following the inherent order of heaven and earth—heaven’s exaltation, earth’s humility, spring’s generation, autumn’s harvest—these are the natural principles. Yet the Yellow Emperor modeled himself on this exaltation and humility to establish robes and garments, measured the seasons to carry out punishments and campaigns, thereby illuminating the Way of the True Man while obscuring the virtue of the sage, daily renewing himself in the world. Why? Because when the Dao and virtue ascend, cunning and knowledge naturally fade away. If one’s virtue aligns with heaven, then the artifices of wisdom and skill become discarded things.\n\nLaozi said: \"If heaven is unsettled, the sun and moon have nothing to bear them; if earth is unsettled, grasses and trees have nowhere to stand. If the self is not at peace, right and wrong have no form.\" Only when the self is tranquil can it be upright—such is the principle of right and wrong.\n\nThus, only with the True Man does true knowledge arise—casting aside the deluded knowledge of the world to perceive true knowledge. If what one holds is not clear, how can one know that what I call knowledge is not ignorance? To employ the deluded knowledge of the world to clarify true knowledge is difficult indeed.\n\nWhat is called true knowledge is knowledge without right or wrong. How then can the world’s knowledge of right and wrong be true knowledge? It is not true knowledge.\n\nAccumulating wisdom and valuing wealth, making the people joyful and delighting in their lives—this is benevolence. Frugality leads to valuing wealth; abundant grace leads to accumulating kindness. Establishing great deeds, displaying illustrious names, ordering lord and subject, rectifying high and low, clarifying near and far, preserving those in peril, continuing severed lineages, and establishing heirs for the childless—this is righteousness. All these are裁断 to fit what is appropriate.\n\nClosing the nine apertures, concealing the will and intent, discarding cleverness and intelligence, returning to non-discernment—such is the principle of fully preserving life and safeguarding one’s nature. Vague and drifting beyond the dust and grime, carefree in the work of non-action—vague and unknowing, beyond fame and profit, adapting to circumstances, neither gain nor loss able to burden one—this is the bearing of one who inhales yin and exhales yang, merging with the ten thousand things in profound unity. Following the great constancy of yin and yang, harmonizing with the nature of things—this is virtue.\n\nThus, the Dao disperses and becomes virtue; virtue overflows and becomes benevolence and righteousness. \"Overflows\" means to lose. Benevolence and righteousness are established, and the Dao and virtue are abandoned. For to depart from true simplicity and cause things to attain the Dao’s dispersion into virtue is the meaning of this.\n\nTherefore, when emerging from the natural, one attains the position of the Supreme. When virtue is about to be established, the traces upon which it depends become manifest. Once manifest, to preserve them without overflow is impossible. Thus, excess arises from benevolence and righteousness.\n\nTo govern things through benevolence and righteousness is to hang the teachings of allurement and admiration prominently in the world, while the virtue of attaining the natural Dao suffers no loss. Is this not a deficiency?\n\nLaozi said: \"When the spirit scatters, words become flowery; when virtue drifts, conduct becomes false.\" The spirit serves to reflect things, virtue to perfect conduct. Thus, when the spirit is scattered and fleeting, words lose their substance; when virtue flows and drifts, conduct loses its truth.\n\nWhen the utmost essence is lost within, yet words and deeds are observed without, this is inevitably to be enslaved by things. Once scattered and drifting, the inner self lacks sincerity, and one observes external things, uttering words and forming deeds. In this way, one is enslaved by things and cannot preserve oneself.\n\nHe also said: \"When there is no sincerity within, yet words and deeds occupy the realm of observation, this deludes and deceives the people, causing them to follow unprincipled governance and imitate expedient laws. The worthy, through excessive caution, withdraw from the world; the foolish, through daily practice, make it their nature. Thus, those in positions of power are not steadfast and are enslaved by things.\"\n\nWhen essence is exhausted and consumed while conduct knows no limit, what one holds is unstable, and one is led astray by the winds of worldly custom. \"Consumed\" means depleted. Enslaved by things, there comes a time of exhaustion. Yet when all standards are enacted, how can there be a limit? Responding to every kind of conduct with incomplete essence, with an inherently unstable foundation, how can one avoid being led astray by custom?\n\nThus, the sage inwardly cultivates the arts of the Dao and does not outwardly adorn himself with benevolence and righteousness. Knowing the proper use of the nine apertures and four limbs, he wanders in the harmony of spirit—this is the sage’s wandering. One who embodies the Dao to perfect the mind’s expansion will find the merits of benevolence and righteousness naturally manifest without. One who preserves essence and encounters with spirit will find the proper order of the body naturally at peace within. Yet if a single thing is obstructed, it cannot be called wandering. Now, with both inner and outer in accord, is this not the sage’s wandering?\n\nLaozi said: \"As for the True Man’s wandering, it moves in the utmost emptiness, unaware of any obstruction.\"\n\nWandering the mind in the great void, unaware of what exists.\nRacing beyond the bounds, unaware of what burdens.\nMoving through no gate, unaware of whence it comes.\nListening to the soundless, gazing at the formless—\nonly in stillness, only in silence lies the true wandering.\nUnrestrained by the world, unbound by custom.\nOne bound by things is no longer wandering.\n\nThus, what the sage employs to move all under heaven\ndoes not exceed the True Man’s way—\nsaving the age, transforming the people,\nare but traces of deliberate action.\nReturning to virtue, shifting toward goodness,\nis this not movement?\nYet those who embody truth do not go so far as this.\n\nWhat the worthy employ to correct世俗\nthe sage does not observe:\nlofty conduct, pure integrity,\nemotions and nature as outward adornment,\nleading above and entangling below—\nis this not affectation?\nThus, the sage of great transformation does not even glance at such things.\n\nOne constrained by世俗\nmust have the form bound and the spirit dissipated,\nand so cannot escape burden.\nForm bound: restrained by ritual and law.\nSpirit dissipated: scattered by cunning and care.\nDissipated without end, the spirit will be lost.\nBound without end, the essence will be exhausted.\nBoth exhausted and lost—\nis this not a burden upon life’s great root?\n\nIf I can be bound and constrained,\nmy fate must lie in what is external.\nThis is indeed so.\nIf I am surely bound by ritual and law,\nthen the portion of Heaven’s mandate is wholly subject to external things.\n\nLaozi said:\nWhen the ruler’s thoughts\ndo not race within his breast,\nnor his wisdom extend beyond the four quarters,\nhis spirit tranquil and self-transforming,\nhis knowledge then prevents the people’s deceit.\nEmbracing a heart of benevolence and sincerity,\nsweet rain falls in season,\nthe five grains flourish,\nspring’s birth, summer’s growth,\nautumn’s harvest, winter’s storage—\nmonthly inspections, seasonal reviews,\nyear’s end tribute presented.\nWhen the ruler’s sincerity moves Heaven\nand his benevolence nurtures those below,\nHeaven responds, the people comply,\nthe hundred officials do not neglect their duties,\nthe nine provinces yearly offer their local tribute.\nNurturing the people with impartiality,\nnon-action achieves this.\n\nThe stern yet insincere cannot awe without severity;\nlaws concise yet not onerous,\ntransform like the divine.\nWhen laws are lenient and punishments mild,\nprisons stand empty.\nThe realm shares one custom,\nnone harbor deceitful hearts.\nWhen governance accords with the people’s nature\nand rests in their customary livelihoods,\nhow could wickedness arise?\nThis is the grace of the sage.\nThe sage’s governance of the people\nis fully encompassed herein.\n\nWhen the ruler’s desires are boundless,\nhis ministers grow greedy for merit and refuse deference.\nThe ruler’s cravings know no limit,\nand his ministers usurp his fame and achievements.\nWhen the people are impoverished and distressed,\nstrife and contention arise.\nTaxes multiply in form,\nand the people grow impoverished and distressed.\nOppressed and hard-pressed,\nthey inevitably contend.\nLabor is spent in vain,\ncrafting useless implements.\nCunning and deceit sprout,\nthieves and bandits flourish.\nCunning and deceit arise\nbecause the ruler covets profit.\nWhen the pursuit of gain knows no end,\none cannot but steal to satisfy desire.\nRuler and subject grow mutually resentful,\nand decrees go unheeded.\n\nWhen water is turbid, fish gasp;\nwhen governance is harsh, the people rebel.\nMuddy waters cloud the stream,\nand fish cannot swim in ease,\nso they pant and gasp to seek respite.\nWhen governance is vexatious and severe,\nthe people no longer rest in their livelihoods,\nand they drift into disorder to survive.\n\nWhen the ruler’s desires are many,\nhis subjects grow cunning.\nThey devise deceit to serve his cravings.\nWhen the ruler is restless,\nhis subjects grow unsettled.\nWhen the ruler’s demands are many,\nhis subjects contend with one another.\nTo address the branches without curing the root\nis no different from digging a channel to stop water\nor carrying firewood to extinguish fire.\n\nTo govern without virtue and power,\nrelying instead on punishments and laws,\nis a method that only increases chaos.\nThus the sage governs with few affairs yet brings order,\nseeks little yet provides abundance.\nSimplicity is easily followed,\nso order is achieved.\nSeeking little ensures constant sufficiency,\nso all are provided for.\n\nWithout action, there is benevolence—\ntranquility preserves wholeness.\nWithout speech, there is trust—\naccord elicits natural response.\nWithout seeking, there is attainment—\nsufficiency precludes contention.\nWithout effort, there is accomplishment—\ntrusting others brings fulfillment.\n\nEmbracing the natural,\npreserving utmost authenticity,\nholding to the Dao and extending sincerity,\nthe realm follows as echo answers sound,\nas shadow mirrors form.\nWhat is cultivated is the root.\nCultivate the self, and the people are upright;\ninward sincerity elicits outward response.\n\nLaozi said:\nWhen spirit scatters outward\nand wisdom and thought churn within,\none cannot govern the body.\nHumans live by form and qi.\nForm stores essence,\nqi settles spirit.\nIf one is enslaved by things,\nthis harms the spirit,\nexhausting wisdom and thought while the form declines.\nThe principles of life are thus inevitably disrupted.\nWhen spirit is employed afar,\nwhat is neglected is near.\nWhen spirit strays far,\nthe near—one’s form—is neglected.\n\nThus one who does not step beyond the door knows the world,\none who does not peer through the window knows the Dao of Heaven—\nthis speaks of one whose spirit is whole.\nBy listening with qi,\nthe sentiments of the myriad things may be known.\nBy observing with spirit,\nthe principles of the myriad transformations may be verified.\nWithin the three realms,\nsincerity resonates and connects—\nhow could one rely on doors and windows for observation?\n\nThe farther one ventures,\nthe less one knows.\nRestless activity without cease\nfurther loses true knowledge.\nThis speaks of sincerity arising within,\nspirit and qi moving throughout the world.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe winter sun’s warmth,\nthe summer sun’s coolness—\nthe myriad things turn to them\nyet none compel their swift return.\nThis is the natural resonance of utmost essence,\ncoming unbidden, departing without farewell.\nWinter’s warmth and summer’s coolness\nare the nature to which things return.\nThough the four seasons swiftly change,\nthis remains constant—\nthe fullness of the Dao of mutual resonance.\n\nIn profound obscurity,\nunaware of what is done,\nyet success is achieved.\nIf one could grasp its workings,\nit would not be profound obscurity—\nthis speaks of the daily renewal of yin and yang’s unfathomable workings.\n\nTo rely on sight for illumination,\non speech for command,\ngovernance becomes difficult.\nGaoyao was mute yet served as grand judge,\nand the realm knew no cruel punishments—\nwas speech truly necessary?\nShikuang was blind yet served as grand minister,\nand Jin suffered no misrule—\nwas sight truly necessary?\nThis is not relying on sight for illumination.\nCommands without speech,\nperception without sight—\nthis is how the sage serves as teacher.\n\nExtending sincerity elicits unbidden response;\ntrusting ability brings clarity without scrutiny.\nThis is how the sage governs the realm,\nfounding his teaching herein.\n\nThe people’s transformation by their superiors\ndoes not follow their words,\nbut their conduct.\nConduct is the outward sign of sincerity,\nso the people submit to transformation from above.\nWords are the flower of reality,\nso they are not yet trusted below.\n\nThus when the ruler favors valor,\nthough he does not incite strife,\nthe state suffers many calamities,\nand gradually banditry and murder arise.\nWhen the ruler favors beauty,\nthough he does not encourage licentious talk,\nthe state suffers many disorders,\nand over time debauchery and excess follow.\nThe transformation of those below by those above\nfollows this principle.\n\nThus the sage’s sincerity is refined within,\nits distinctions clear.\n\nThe inner radiance is thus called \"distinction.\"\nWhen likes and dislikes are manifest externally,\nwords issue forth to match the emotions,\nand decrees are proclaimed to clarify intent.\n\nTherefore, punishments are insufficient to alter customs,\nand executions are insufficient to suppress villainy—\nwithout inner refinement of sincerity,\nlaws and commands cannot prevail externally.\n\nOnly spiritual transformation is esteemed,\nesteemed for its traceless transformation.\nWhen essence reaches its utmost, it becomes spirit;\nits movement is like the spring’s generation\nand the autumn’s withering.\nThe resonance of essence\nleaves no thing unaligned.\nWithout virtue, there is no resentment—\nlike the ceaseless flow of the two qi.\n\nThus the noble person resembles an archer:\na hairsbreadth’s deviation here\nbecomes a span’s error there.\nA single arrow’s misalignment by a hairsbreadth\nresults in a span’s miss at the target.\nIf even the finest thread or mustard seed presents such difficulty in precision,\nhow much farther does its resonance reach?\nTherefore, those who govern must be cautious in what they evoke.\n\nLaozi said: \"When laws are displayed and rewards established,\nyet customs remain unchanged,\nit is because sincerity is not embraced.\"\nWhen the ruler extends sincerity outward,\nall things trust and transgress not.\nRelying on cunning for governance,\nthe people deceive and seek mere escape.\nThough laws are hung to forbid violence\nand rewards set to encourage goodness,\nthey cannot transform shallow customs and thin morals.\n\nThus, hearing a sound reveals its prevailing wind;\nemotion stirs, and voice arises.\nWhen patterns form, goodness becomes evident.\nYet by listening to sound, one takes its tone;\nby examining tone, one perceives intent.\nIntent bears resentment or harmony,\nand the state’s prevailing customs are thereby known.\n\nObserve its music to know its customs.\nMusic’s essence harmonizes the people and guides governance;\nits notes are pure, gathering all things in order.\nYet it is moved by order or chaos,\nand suited to the climate’s disposition—\nthus the local customs may be discerned.\nSee its customs to know its transformation.\nWhat the common people esteem\narises directly from the ruler’s influence.\n\nThose who embrace truth and offer sincerity\nmove heaven and earth,\ntheir spirit transcending all bounds.\nWith commands issued and prohibitions enforced,\nembracing utmost truth and offering unfeigned sincerity,\nheaven and earth respond to their resonance—\nhow much more so do people?\nThus they transform even beyond the eight directions,\nwherever the heart’s decree reaches.\n\nWhen sincerity penetrates the Dao and conveys its intent,\nthough not a word is spoken,\nthe myriad people, birds and beasts, ghosts and spirits\nall undergo transformation with it.\nIf sincerity can fully penetrate this Dao,\neven the hidden and the alien—\nwho could fail to resonate with it?\n\nThus the highest governance is spiritual transformation,\nwhile below, the worthy are rewarded and the violent punished.\nTo align with things without trace—\nthis is the pinnacle of transformation.\nWhen the people cannot bear to deceive,\nthis is the attainment of governance.\nTo rely solely on punishments and rewards—\nthis is the lowest form of rule.\n\nLaozi said: \"The Great Dao is non-action,\nembodying stillness and tranquility.\nNon-action means non-existence,\nand its embodiment is formless.\nNon-existence does not abide,\nhaving no fixed place or direction.\nNot abiding means dwelling in formlessness,\nomnipresent.\nFormless means unmoving,\nempty and thus uncreated.\nUnmoving means wordless,\nits principle transcending names and traces.\nWordless means silent and formless—\nwith names and traces absent,\nhow could echoes or shadows remain?\nSilent and formless,\nit cannot be seen or heard.\nEyes and ears\nare limited to forms and sounds.\nThis is called the subtle and wondrous,\nits essence hidden and refined,\nits function profoundly mysterious.\nThis is called the utmost spirit,\nfor it bestows life and completion without leaving a trace—\nsuch is the perfection of spirit.\n\nIt endures ceaselessly, as if present—\nthis is called the root of heaven and earth.\nThe Dao’s body is empty and still,\ngenerating and transforming without bound,\nenduring without end—\nthus it is the foundation of the great cosmos.\n\nThe Dao is formless and soundless,\nso the sage forcibly gives it form,\nusing a single phrase as its name.\nThe Dao originally has no substance—\nhow could sound be established?\nYet the sage forcibly adopts the shape of a path\nto designate the nameless body.\nOne phrase unifies the myriad images,\none thread penetrates nature and destiny.\nThough a single phrase surpasses all speech,\nit encompasses form and sound,\nand all under heaven follow its course.\n\nThe Dao of heaven and earth\ntakes the small as its foundation,\nthe many as beginning with the few.\nHeaven and earth, vast as they are,\ntake the minute as their root.\nThe myriad images, boundless as they are,\nbegin with the One.\nThe Son of Heaven takes heaven and earth as his standard,\nthe myriad things as his resources.\nHis merit and virtue are supreme,\nhis power and renown most exalted.\nThe Supreme Heaven sends forth the sage to oversee all beings,\nusing heaven and earth to establish the ranks of honor and lowliness,\nand borrowing the myriad things to complete the resources of nobility and baseness—\nthus he attains utmost virtue.\n\nThe sage’s achievements rescue the world,\nhis illustrious name and majestic power\ncommand reverence across the seas.\nThe beauty of these two virtues\nmatches heaven and earth.\nTaking heaven and earth as his standard\nand the myriad things as his resources,\nhe fulfills these two great virtues of nobility and vastness—\nthus he may be compared to the two primal forces.\n\nYet in relation to heaven,\nthere is no place where virtue is not established—\nand to call this position \"virtue\" is fitting.\nTherefore, one must not deviate\nfrom the Great Dao as the mother of all under heaven.\n\nHaving matched virtue’s position to heaven and earth,\nand equaled its function to creation,\nhow could one fail to uphold the Dao’s law,\nabiding in non-action,\nso that all under heaven use it daily without awareness?\n\nLaozi said: \"Relieving the destitute and aiding the urgent\nis called generating benefit and initiating action;\nremoving harm is called achieving merit.\nMerit and fame arise from action.\"\nRelieving the poor and rescuing the distressed\ninevitably incur the floating reputation of benevolence\nand the minor profit of righteous aid.\nIf the world were free of disasters,\neven the sage would have no place to apply his virtue—\nwere all under heaven to attain their due,\nwhere would the sage’s virtue find expression?\nIf superiors and inferiors were harmonious,\neven the worthy would have no place to establish their merit—\nwere ruler and minister, father and son each to fulfill their roles,\nwhere would the worthy’s merit find realization?\n\nThus the governance of the perfected person\nembraces virtue and holds to the Dao,\nextending sincerity with boundless wisdom,\nrestraining speech without utterance—\nand all under heaven, not knowing its value, honor his silence.\n\nTo leave traces of established virtue\nis not to embrace virtue.\"\n\nTo follow the Dao in one’s course is not to embrace the Dao.\nOnly when one reaches its ultimate state is one called a perfected person—\nfor this is simply to extend sincerity from within,\nletting things right themselves of their own accord.\nThough his discernment knows no bounds,\nhe rests in wordless mystery,\ndwelling in stillness like a corpse within his humble chamber,\nwhile the hundred clans transform themselves.\nHow could the mediocre masses of the world value his wordless Way?\n\nThus, \"The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao;\nthe name that can be named is not the constant name.\"\nThe Dao that can be made into an object is not the constant Dao of spontaneity;\nthe name that can be assigned is not the constant name of quiescent essence.\nTherefore, the perfected person does not abide in such things.\nInscribed on bamboo and silk,\nengraved on metal and stone,\ntransmitted to others—\nall these are but its coarse manifestations.\nMerits and fame recorded on bamboo and silk,\nlaws and canons carved into metal and stone,\nare all traces of achievement,\nnot the Dao of non-action.\nWeighed and debated, they are indeed coarse.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, and Three Kings\npursued different affairs with the same heart,\ntook different paths to the same end.\nTheir hearts shared the same aim of bringing order,\nthough their policies and transformations differed.\nScholars of later ages,\nnot grasping the unity embodied in the Dao\nor the essentials that virtue gathers,\ntake the traces of past deeds,\nkneel and sit to expound them—\nteaching their traces alone fails to encompass all things,\nmerely revering their leftover words.\nEven with broad learning and much knowledge,\nthey cannot avoid disorder.\nThose who hear much of rites and righteousness\nare apt to confuse their times,\nfor these are not the essentials of good governance.\n\nLaozi said:\n\"The essence of the heart can spiritually transform,\nbut cannot be spoken of.\nThe function of essence leaves no trace,\nyet things are transformed—\nbeyond the reach of names and words.\"\nThe sage governs all under heaven without leaving his seat,\nhis influence surpassing the cries of an owl or the shouts of a herald.\nRelying on the power of pure sincerity,\nhis transformation is like an echo.\nThus, the world is rightly ordered.\n\nWords that are alike may be trusted,\nbut trust lies before the words.\nWhen one among many speakers is uniquely trusted,\nit is because his sincerity and trustworthiness were already manifest.\nCommands that are alike may be carried out,\nbut sincerity lies beyond the command.\nWhen one among many issuances is uniquely obeyed,\nit is because his sincerity aligns with the command,\nand the people all follow.\nWhen the sage is above,\nthe people are transformed as if by a spirit—\nhis feelings precede them.\nSince his trust lies before his words\nand his sincerity beyond his commands,\nhis transformation is swift as a spirit.\n\nWhen the ruler acts above but the people do not respond below,\nit is because their feelings and commands diverge.\n\"Feeling\" is akin to sincerity.\nA three-month-old infant knows nothing of benefit or harm,\nyet its loving mother cherishes it all the more—\nthis is feeling.\nHow could the infant understand the advantages of closeness or distance?\nYet the deeper the mother’s love,\nthe clearer the principle of mutual resonance.\nThus, when the hundred clans are without knowledge,\nthe sage remains without name,\nand all respond in harmony.\n\nThe function of words brings small change;\nthe transformation of verbal teaching cannot alter customs.\nThe function of wordlessness brings great change;\nthe resonance of pure sincerity transforms all under heaven.\nTo trust a gentleman’s words\nand be loyal to his intentions—\nthrough trust and sincerity,\nnone fail to follow his words.\nWith sincerity reaching utmost clarity,\nnone fail to align with his intentions.\nLoyalty and trust take form within,\nstirring responses without—\nthis is the transformation of the worthy and the sage.\nThe inner manifestation of the Dao\nelicits its external effects.\nThe worthy are called *junzi*,\nthe sages are called *shengren*—\nthis shared phrasing means:\nthe sage embraces the *junzi*’s abilities,\nwhile the *junzi* unfolds the sage’s transformation.\n\nLaozi said:\n\"When a son dies for his father,\nor a minister for his lord,\nit is not to seek fame through death—\nthe heart’s devotion is hidden within,\nand they do not shirk from peril.\"\nHow could ministers and sons\nangle for the reputation of loyalty and filial piety\nto face their lord’s or father’s peril?\nYet when gratitude and righteousness stir within,\nthey naturally forget life and follow duty.\n\nThe *junzi*’s sorrow for the world\nis not a deliberate act—\nit arises from within,\nand one must examine his conduct.\nThe *junzi* cherishes benevolence,\ngrieving for the age—\nnot arbitrarily upholding it,\nbut letting it emerge from within.\nYet if he does not observe the customs of the time\nand teach accordingly,\nhe will fail in governance.\n\nThe sage walking at night feels no shame before his shadow—\nthus the *junzi* is cautious in solitude.\nThe sage is without partiality,\nthe *junzi* holds office.\nThough dwelling in darkness,\nhe never trembles in fear,\nnor betrays things—\nhow could he feel shame before his shadow?\n\nTo abandon what is near and seek what is distant is obstruction.\nTo forsake self-attainment for distant goals—\nhow can this lead to success?\nThus, when the sage is above,\nthe people delight in his governance;\nwhen below,\nthey long for his intentions,\nhis heart never forgetting the desire to benefit others.\nThe sage has no private attachments,\nyet takes the salvation of all as his aim—\nto save without limit is called \"aspiration.\"\nYet this is not the aspiration of deliberate intent.\n\nThus, when he occupies his position,\nthe hundred clans all find peace in his virtue and teaching,\nadmiring his sincerity and purity.\nLaozi said:\n\"A brave warrior’s cry,\nand the three armies all retreat—\nthis is the power of his sincerity.\"\nBravery is *qi*;\n*qi* arises from sincerity,\nand the hearts of the three armies are swayed.\nWithout the *qi* of righteous bravery\nand the stirring of shared feeling,\neven facing the enemy with weapons in hand,\none could not protect a single life.\n\nWhen a call goes unanswered,\nor an intention is not carried—\nthere must be a lack of harmony within.\n\"Within\" refers to the meeting point of inner and outer resonance.\nIf I call and they do not respond,\nif I intend and they do not carry it out,\nit is because our pure sincerity has not connected.\n\nTo govern all under heaven without leaving one’s seat\nis to seek it within oneself.\nWhen the heart is sincere, things respond;\nwhen the form is upright, things align.\nThus, where words and teachings do not reach,\nthe influence of one’s bearing does.\nWhere the influence of bearing does not reach,\nthe resonance of pure sincerity must.\nThe stirrings of the heart take form,\ncompleting the inner so the outer transforms itself.\nWhen essence and form reach their utmost,\none can connect through form,\nbut cannot rely on it for illumination.\n\nThe form refers to bearing, the essence to emotion. The Way of these two transformations may be connected through kindred forms, yet cannot be suspended and expected to manifest on its own. If this is so, then there is something awaited within—how can essence remain pure or form be upright? There has never been one whose form was upright yet failed to move and transform things.\n\nLaozi said: Words have their root, affairs have their foundation. Words have the root of established teachings, affairs have the foundation of creation. Lose their root and foundation, and though one’s skills be many, it is better to speak little. Once root and foundation are lost, proliferation becomes harm, and one cannot even preserve stillness. Those who harm the many are like Yu the craftsman cutting off his finger to show that great skill cannot be forced. The skill of Ban and Fei is contrived—when there is action, fame is established but fingers are severed. The skill of creation is non-action, thus its use is fulfilled and its body remains whole.\n\nThus, the craftsman knows how to close, yet by closing at the right time does not know closure—hence he must block it before opening. Following transformation, succeeding with the times, relying on knowledge and skill will inevitably lead to ruin.\n\nLaozi said: The sage’s undertakings take different paths yet reach the same end; affairs differ in what they follow, but transformation shares the same destination. Their survival or ruin, stability or collapse, all stem from an unwavering intent to benefit others. Amid these four differences, they do not forget the forgetting of benefiting others.\n\nThus, the songs of Qin, Chu, Yan, and Wei differ in transmission yet all bring joy; the laments of the Nine Yi and Eight Di differ in sound yet all express sorrow. Sorrow and joy reside within—no foreign custom can alter them. Song is the sign of joy, weeping the effect of sorrow. Essence within responds without, thus wherever one is, it moves others. Song and weeping are the proof of gain and loss.\n\nThe Way of governance and transformation: when life is followed, all rejoice; when nature is suppressed, all grieve. The cause of the myriad things’ resentment or harmony lies entirely in what the ruler above moves. The sage’s heart never forgets its desire to benefit others—how far-reaching is the reach of his grace! Thus, Hua and Yi are all transformed.\n\nLaozi said: When people practice non-action, governance is achieved; when nature is still, peace is attained. Those who act harm the governance of non-action, adding knowledge to affairs and thus injuring the original nature. Those who would practice non-action cannot be without action. Where there is intent to preserve, there is action. Those who cannot be without action cannot truly act. Having lost their own still nature, how can they govern things?\n\nPeople are wordless and spirit is present—spirit is the essence of vitality. Only in emptiness and quiescence is its full function realized. When there are words, they injure the spirit of wordlessness, for words analyze things and principles, binding them and thus causing harm. To bear wordlessness is to injure the spirit of spirit. Preserving wordlessness in the heart is the heart’s inability to be empty. With this obstruction, the spirit is inevitably harmed.\n\nWenzi said: Names can be forcibly established, achievements can be forcibly accomplished. Formerly, Nanrong Chou was ashamed that the sagely Way alone was absent in himself. He traveled south to see Laozi and received a single word of teaching. His spirit became clear and bright, his difficulties and distresses smoothed and resolved. Through diligent effort, he went ten days without eating, yet felt as if feasting on a grand sacrifice—tasting the Way and being sated with virtue. Thus, his brilliance illuminated the world, his name endured for generations, his wisdom and strategy encompassed heaven and earth, his discernment reached the finest detail. His praises in the language of Hua continue unceasing to this day—this is what is meant by names being forcibly established. The full account is in the *Kangcangzi*.\n\nThus, the farmer who does not strive will not fill his granary; the official who does not exert himself will not refine his sincerity; the general and minister who do not strive will not accomplish great deeds; the king and marquis who are indolent will leave no name after death. The profound purport of this chapter takes essence and sincerity as its root. Wenzi feared that世 people would merely wish to preserve sincerity while forgetting strenuous study, hence he set forth these examples to illustrate sincerity.\n\nThe perfected person moves in concealment, like thunder hiding beneath the earth—his traces unseen. Acting in accord with the times, establishing merit through available means, advancing and retreating without difficulty, he is unobstructed in all things. Adapting to temporal change, harmonizing with the principles of things.\n\nThe perfected person’s essence and sincerity take inner form, his virtue flows to the four quarters. Seeing benefit in the world, he rejoices yet does not forget; seeing harm in the world, he is startled as if having suffered a loss. His nature and principle are profoundly united, thus he has neither gain nor loss. His form follows things, hence his sorrow and joy are as they are.\n\nOne who grieves the people’s grief is grieved by the people; one who rejoices in the people’s joy is rejoiced by the people. With my sameness to things, things do not differ from me. Thus, to rejoice with all under heaven and grieve with all under heaven—yet fail to become king—has never been.\n\nOnly one who is without intent and merges with all under heaven can be the pen for all under heaven. The perfected person’s method begins where it cannot be seen and ends where it cannot be reached. Moved by inner sincerity, thus its beginning cannot be seen; cutting off its old traces, thus its end cannot be attained.\n\nAbiding in an unshakable position, taking tranquility and stillness as foundation. Accumulating in an inexhaustible storehouse, taking profound virtue as root. Bearing in an unfailing treasury, taking self-sufficiency as resource. Issuing commands like the source of flowing water, benefiting things while ever following. Employing the people in offices of non-contention, governing with emptiness and softness. Opening the gate that must be attained, proceeding from ease and thus not losing. Not doing what cannot be accomplished, not altering the materials of things to act. Not seeking what cannot be obtained, not aspiring to what lies beyond one’s lot. Not dwelling where one cannot remain long, departing from arrogance and excess. Not acting in ways that cannot be repeated, leaving behind attachment to complexity.\n\nThe great person enacts a government that brings joy—none do not follow his commands. When commands follow the times, they proceed from small to great; when commands run counter, even good becomes harm, success becomes failure. The great person’s governance is simple—none do not rejoice and be transformed. Principle naturally flourishes, while the governance of vexatious severity is the opposite of what is fitting.\n\nThe so-called \"great person\" is inwardly strong and outwardly luminous—within, as strong as Heaven and Earth; without, as bright as the sun and moon. Heaven and Earth cover and bear all without exception; the sun and moon illuminate all without exception. The great person displays virtue to the people, neither altering what is constant nor changing what is regular, so that all under Heaven obey his commands as grass follows the wind.\n\nBy embracing the Dao and establishing virtue, virtue may be displayed; by following the times and aligning with nature, commands may be enacted. If governance errs in spring, Jupiter waxes and wanes, not abiding in its regular course. If governance errs in summer, Mars moves in retrogression. If governance errs in autumn, Venus does not appear where it should, its rising and setting irregular. If governance errs in winter, Mercury fails to manifest in its proper region. When governance in all four seasons goes awry, Saturn sways and trembles, the sun and moon show portents, the five planets rebel in disorder, and comets emerge. Only those who cultivate virtue avoid such omens.\n\nWhen spring governance is not lost, millet and grain flourish—heavenly timing and human affairs align, thus the qi of harmony and life prevails, and the five grains grow lush. When summer governance is not lost, rain falls in its season. When autumn governance is not lost, the people prosper and thrive—grains and fruits ripen, and the people naturally abound. When winter governance is not lost, the state enjoys peace and well-being—for winter’s yin is tranquil and still, and governance that follows it brings serenity.\n\n*End of Scroll Two of the* Tongxuan Zhenjing\n*Scroll Three of the* Tongxuan Zhenjing\n\nJudge of the Court of Judicial Review, Probationary Officer of the Supreme Court of Law, and Magistrate of Jinyun County in Kuozhou, Zhu Jingzhengyi’s Annotations on the *Nine Guardings*\n\nThe *guarding* lies in unifying the will, while the *nine* encompasses the utmost in numerical perfection. Thus, nothing lies beyond its domain, and no affair fails to reach completion. This section, from *Guarding Simplicity* to *Guarding Emptiness*, comprises ten chapters. Each bears the word *guarding* in its title, save one, which conceals it. The number nine is embedded within the text, and though we now speak of the *Nine Guardings*, this refers to the application of the principle of nine.\n\nLaozi said: Before heaven and earth took form, all was dark and indistinct, merged as one—undifferentiated primordial qi. Silent and limpid, the heavy and turbid settled to become earth, while the pure and subtle rose to form heaven. When utmost clarity prevailed, the distinction of light and heavy naturally arose. From this arose the four seasons, and from division emerged yin and yang. Qi, stagnant or restless, gave birth to yin and yang; cycles, with their beginnings and ends, produced the four seasons. Refined qi became humans, while coarse qi became creatures. Thus, humans earned the name of the most numinous, while creatures fell among the multitude. Hardness and softness complement each other, and the myriad things are born. Hardness is the nature of yang; softness, the substance of yin. When these two qi interact and converge, life is sustained.\n\nThe spirit originates from heaven, endowed with lightness and clarity to flow freely. The bones and flesh take root in earth, endowed with weight and turbidity to remain grounded. When the spirit enters its gate, the bones and flesh return to their root—what then remains of me? For life and transformation are the constant principles of heaven. In birth, one suddenly becomes form and spirit; in transformation, one silently returns to the root. Coming is not what we esteem, nor is going within our control—so on what basis can the notion of \"I\" stand? The gate is the path of return and transformation.\n\nThus, the sage models himself on heaven and follows earth, unbound by custom or swayed by others. He dares not cling to the \"I,\" but instead aligns with nature’s spontaneity. He takes heaven as father and earth as mother, revering the ultimate of spirit and form, and emulating the virtue of their encompassing embrace. Yin and yang serve as the warp, the four seasons as the weft. Without holding to these as the guiding principles, one cannot harmonize with the great order.\n\nHeaven is tranquil and clear; earth is settled and serene. All things that oppose them perish, while those that follow them live. If even heaven and earth rely on stillness to perfect their virtue, how can the creatures they generate seek survival through restlessness? Thus, stillness and silence are the abode of spirit and illumination; emptiness and nothingness are where the Dao resides. When the spirit is settled and stable, it rests in heaven’s stillness and silence. When the great Dao embodies its essence, it dwells in the heart’s emptiness and nothingness.\n\nThe spirit is what we receive from heaven; the bones and flesh, what we inherit from earth. This is what it means to honor the spirit to preserve the form. Thus it is said: The Dao gives birth to the One. The Dao does not generate, nor does the One stand alone. Yet when we observe the state before existence began, we forcibly name it the Dao. When numbers were still merged, we call it the One. The One gives birth to the Two. It splits to become the two qi of yin and yang. The Two gives birth to the Three. Yang, clear, rises to form heaven; yin, congealed, descends to become earth. The two qi harmonize in the center to create humans. The Three gives birth to the myriad things. Once the Three Powers are established, the ten thousand transformations can arise, and the myriad kinds renew themselves daily.\n\nThe myriad things bear yin on their backs and embrace yang in their fronts, harmonizing through the balancing qi. Turning away from yin and facing yang is the natural course of life. The balancing of qi is the root of vitality.\n\nLaozi said: Humans receive the transformations of heaven and earth to be born, taking in qi to transform and give rise to this form and spirit. In the first month, the essence congeals, its appearance like grease. In the second month, the vessels form, as blood and qi channel into pathways. In the third month, the embryo takes shape, though its interior remains unhardened. In the fourth month, the fetus appears, with faint outlines of features. In the fifth month, the sinews develop—halfway through the ten-month gestation. The sinews, firm yet flexible, lie between hardness and softness, so they form at this time.\n\nAs essence and blood transform to become bones and flesh, the bones harden and the flesh thickens, obstructing the flow of vital qi. Thus, the flesh conceals the vessels, and the bones connect the sinews, allowing the vital qi to circulate and link the limbs and joints. In the sixth month, the bones form as the essence solidifies. In the seventh month, the fetus is complete, with the five viscera fully developed internally and the nine orifices formed externally. In the eighth month, it moves its limbs. In the ninth month, it becomes restless, as movement reaches its peak. In the tenth month, it is born, its form and bones fully developed, the five viscera now manifest. Inner and outer are each properly aligned.\n\nThe liver governs the eyes, the kidneys the ears, the spleen the tongue, the lungs the nose, and the gallbladder the mouth. These assignments may differ from other accounts. Though the five viscera and seven orifices have their designated functions, they are interconnected and responsive in all ways. Thus, the heart is not mentioned here, for as the most numinous of the viscera, its external orifice transcends singular governance.\n\nThe outer is the surface; the inner, the core. The four limbs and nine orifices are the surface; the five viscera and six bowels, the core. The head is round to model heaven; the feet are square to resemble earth. Heaven is round and earth square, so their upper and lower parts each follow their kind.\n\nHeaven has four seasons, five phases, nine divisions, and three hundred sixty-six days. The nine divisions are the nine celestial gates. Humans have four limbs, five viscera, nine orifices, and three hundred sixty joints—all modeled on what is above. Heaven has wind, rain, cold, and heat; humans have taking and giving, joy and anger. Wind disperses, rain bestows—these correspond to taking and giving. Cold governs killing, heat governs harmony—these correspond to joy and anger.\n\nThe gallbladder manifests as clouds, symbolizing courage and awe. The lungs manifest as qi, symbolizing purity and brightness. The spleen manifests as wind, symbolizing movement. The kidneys manifest as rain, symbolizing yin’s moisture. The liver manifests as thunder, symbolizing wrathful shaking. Humans and heaven and earth are mutually resonant, with the heart as their master.\n\nThe heart governs perception and transformation, akin to the fundamental mechanism of the Ninefold Dao. The remaining viscera and bowels all have their correspondences, and thus the resonance between heaven and humanity is complete. Yet the heart, fundamentally master of the tongue’s single orifice, remains unencumbered by external encasement, free from entanglement—hence its lordship over all.\n\nThe ears and eyes are the sun and moon; blood and qi are wind and rain. The eyes mirror the sun, the ears mirror the moon; qi mirrors wind, blood mirrors rain. When the sun and moon deviate from their courses, they suffer obscuration and loss of light; when wind and rain arrive unseasonably, they bring ruin and calamity. If the sun and moon stray from their proper degrees, they reach conjunction and eclipse; if wind and rain come at the wrong time, the five grains are destroyed. Applied to the body, the consequences are self-evident.\n\nWhen the five planets stray from their paths, the provinces and states suffer their misfortune. Each of the five planets governs its own celestial region. Heavenly timing and human affairs interact and give rise to phenomena. Thus, when the feudal lords of a state or the governors of a province commit a single moral lapse, the signs appear above, and the realm below suffers the disaster. From this, we know that humanity and heaven-and-earth are mutually resonant.\n\nThe ears and eyes are the sun and moon; blood and qi are wind and rain. When qi rebels, wind becomes violent; when blood stagnates, rain lingers. When the ears and eyes lack moderation, the sun and moon stray from their degrees. Such is the nature of things.\n\nThe Way of heaven and earth is vast and boundless, yet even it tempers its radiance, cherishing its numinous brightness. How then can human ears and eyes endure endless seeing and hearing without rest, or the spirit gallop without fatigue? Heaven and earth are broad and immeasurable, their limits unfathomable. The sun and moon shine ceaselessly, yet even they suffer the losses of eclipse, moderating their full brilliance. Cold and heat follow their constant cycles, preserving their numinous brightness. How much less can one, confined by the limits of human measure, use them without restraint?\n\nThus the sage guards the internal and does not lose the external. One who excels at guarding the internal is not led astray by externals. Blood and qi are humanity’s splendor—its very countenance. The five viscera are humanity’s essence: the liver stores the *hun*, the lungs store the *po*, the heart stores the spirit, the spleen stores intention and wisdom, the kidneys store essence and will. All are inwardly stored as essence, outwardly expressed as spirit.\n\nWhen blood and qi are concentrated within and do not stray outward, the chest and abdomen are full, and desires diminish. All manifestations of joy and anger in the countenance, all shifts between courage and timidity in the breath—these are signs of blood and qi straying outward. In this way, loss and gain become self-evident. If blood does not rebel within, the muscles and bones are replete; if qi does not wander without, emotions and desires are few. When the qi of the viscera is insufficient, partial cravings arise to harmonize and regulate—how then can desires persist? When desires diminish, the ears and eyes become clear, and hearing and vision grow keen. Desires arise primarily through the ears and eyes; thus, when they are few, clarity arises naturally. Clarity brings unconfused hearing and unswayed vision—this is called illumination.\n\nWhen the five viscera remain aligned with the heart without separation, qi and intention prevail, conduct is not perverse, the spirit flourishes, and qi does not scatter. The five viscera each have their manifestations, their spirits and qi distinct, yet the heart is the master of the hundred spirits and five viscera. If it can keep them aligned, unheard and unresponsive, then the spirit is whole and qi is focused. Yet if the gallbladder’s courage or the spleen’s arrogance act in rebellion, unrestrained by the heart, how can rectitude be achieved? With hearing that misses nothing, vision that sees all, and the power to accomplish everything—the heart’s full potential is realized in its use.\n\nCalamities find no entry, and pathogenic qi cannot invade. Pathogenic qi assails the center only when there is no master; calamities arise externally when the mechanism is obscured. Thus, when qi is upright, evil cannot invade; when the spirit is whole, fortune arrives manifestly. Therefore, those who seek much gain little; those who perceive broadly know narrowly. Only by calming the heart can one govern, and the five viscera reveal themselves—then one knows the world.\n\nThe orifices are the doors and windows of the spirit; through them, clarity is communicated, and by them, ingress and egress occur. Qi and intention are the messengers and signs of the five viscera. When intention and qi serve as messengers, the five viscera can be observed. Thus, when the ears and eyes are indulgent in sound and color, the five viscera become agitated and unsettled, responding as if to an official summons. When blood and qi surge without cease, the spirit gallops unrestrained, and the spirit is burdened by the form.\n\nThough fortune and misfortune arrive like mountains, they cannot be discerned. In stillness, one perceives the subtle; in chaos, one is deluded by the manifest. The sage cherishes and does not transgress—cherishing the form and spirit, not overstepping into sound and color. If the sage ensures that the ears and eyes are keen and profoundly penetrating, unenticed by external allure, then intention and qi do not lose their clarity and stillness, desires are few, and the five viscera are at peace. When the spirit guards the form within and does not stray, one can observe the external events of past ages and the internal affairs of future matters, and the gates of fortune and misfortune become as nothing. If one truly embodies the virtues described above, then the profound mirror is without obstruction—and how much more so when fortune and misfortune have already taken shape, nothing will escape notice.\n\nBy distinguishing categories and naming their relations, by illuminating numbers and their mutual generation, affairs become observable. By cultivating one’s nature to align with the root, by exhausting the spirit to fathom the distant, the past can be traced. The external is the track of what has come before; the internal is the omen of what is to come. The past leaves tracks; by following them, one arrives. What comes from without has not yet taken shape; by attending to its omens, one discerns the internal. Thus, the alternation of mechanisms and their cycles can be known—how then can the gates of fortune and misfortune be worthy of mention?\n\nThe farther one extends outward, the less one knows—this speaks to the spirit’s inability to be externally indulgent. When externally indulgent, it is swept away by others and cannot reflect upon itself. Thus, the five colors confuse the eyes, rendering them unclear; the five sounds enter the ears, rendering them unhearing.\n\n「Hearing mixed sounds brings confusion; the five flavors disorder the palate, causing the mouth to lose its natural sensitivity and thus its true taste. The pursuit of dwelling and avoidance of movement unsettle the heart, leading to erratic conduct—when the mind is disturbed, there is no steadfast purpose. Therefore, indulgence in desires makes one’s *qi* stray, and attachment to likes and dislikes exhausts one’s spirit. Those who do not swiftly abandon them will see their *qi* wasted daily, and how long can such a life endure?\n\nIt is because people cannot complete their natural lifespan that they nurture their lives excessively. All follow their cravings and attachments, over-nourishing themselves and thereby harming their vitality. Only those who do not cling to life as their own can attain longevity. Forgetting joy brings contentment; abandoning life preserves the body. The Dao of heaven and earth flows and unites, all things converge into one—*yin* and *yang* *qi* intermingle, thus maintaining harmony. All things spring from a single origin; to know that origin is to know all things. Unable to grasp the One, one knows nothing. Without adhering to the fundamental Dao, all encounters lead to bewilderment.\n\nI dwell within the world as one of its myriad things, yet things remain distinct from me. Born together between heaven and earth, my body is but one among the ten thousand. How can things truly \"affect\" other things? Only those who share the same essence do not harm each other through opposition. Desire cannot be served, for life arises naturally and cannot be forced. Death cannot be avoided, for time wills it and cannot be defied. To revere the lowly is not to be humble, nor to despise the noble to be virtuous—it is simply following nature’s way. To rest in one’s inherent nature is true ease; to not strain beyond one’s limits is supreme joy. To follow nature’s course without forcing it is to embrace its fullness. What else could be called the ultimate in ease?\n\nTo uphold the virtues of tranquility and contentment, to embrace stillness and thus complete one’s days. Adhering to these four virtues, one rides the transformations of nature to their end. Without partiality or favoritism, this is the Dao’s perfection. Clinging to virtue and nurturing harmony, one aligns with heaven’s will. To embrace the virtue of stillness and harmonize with the *qi* of life, thus conforming to nature’s flow.\n\nTo dwell at the boundary of the Dao, to neighbor with virtue—those who traverse emptiness in response are at the Dao’s utmost. To govern with harmony is to be surrounded by virtue. To not initiate fortune nor provoke misfortune: fortune is not fortune unless one finds ease in it; misfortune is not misfortune unless one is agitated by it. Those who remain tranquil in misfortune will find their fortune distinct from others; those who cannot find ease in fortune will see it turn to misfortune. The essence of fortune and misfortune lies not in wealth or poverty, but in agitation or stillness.\n\nMoreover, the principle of the beginning is rooted in action: evil arises from reckless movement, and peril lurks in the timing of one’s actions. Thus, the sage acts without forcing, faces neither misfortune nor fortune, and moves effortlessly forward and backward. Though fortune and misfortune may appear externally, the sage remains undisturbed by their ebb and flow, unaffected by life and death. To follow nature’s transformations without resistance is to be ever constant—this is the sage’s unchanging state, beyond birth and death. Hence, it is called *至神* (ultimate subtlety of the spirit).\n\nThe spirit seeks without failing, accomplishes without hindrance. Its application knows no limits. To guard emptiness—wandering through all things yet not being bound by them—is to transcend self and object. Laozi says: *\"The sage who lightens the world’s burdens is spirit without encumbrance.\"* When the spirit is vast and balanced, it bears no weight upon the soul’s essence, and thus effortlessly detaches from worldly honors.\n\nTo refine all things—when the heart is undisturbed by external objects—is to not be confused. To perceive the great as the autumn hair and the small as the mighty mountain, to dwell equally in vast or narrow realms, abandoning distinctions of size or insignificance, how could one be confused?\n\nTo equalize life and death—when the mind is unshaken—is to not fear. For awareness ends with dreams, and dreams with waking. Life and death move and rest, each in its own time, and to align with this way is to safeguard what one fears.\n\nTo harmonize with transformation—when one knows that all things share the same essence—is to not be dazzled by heaven’s logic. The ultimate sage stands as an unyielding pillar, traversing paths without obstruction. Virtue is the master that never falters, the Dao ever flows and remains open. Drawing from an inexhaustible source, learning from an unending teacher, the sage fulfills all needs without ever wearying the spirit, or losing the body’s essence. Without action that does not succeed, without response that does not align, bending and extending, rising and falling—embracing fate without confusion, and thus effortlessly navigating fortune and misfortune, while harm and benefit cannot truly disturb.」\n\nTo entrust oneself to Heaven’s command, to adapt with the times—when fortune and misfortune come, they cannot truly become inner turmoil.\n\nTo act with righteousness (*yì*) is to be constrained by virtue (*rén*), yet not coerced by force.\nThose who receive their mandate great of heart, though they tread upon white blades, remain steadfast in their principles.\nShow them virtue, and they cannot be forced to act otherwise.\nThey can be corrected by righteousness, yet not swayed by profit.\nRighteousness lies in what is inherently beneficial.\nA noble (*junzi*) dies for righteousness, not to be detained by wealth or honor—\nas with the likes of Boyi and Shuqi.\n\nTo act with righteousness is not to fear death—\nas with the case of the Qi minister Chen Buzhan.\n\nHow much more so for those of *wuwei*?\nTo uphold a single principle may yet lead to ruin—\nyet with boundless *wuwei*, why burden oneself with form?\nThe practitioner of *wuwei* bears no encumbrance;\nthe unburdened one regards the world as a shadow pillar—\na pillar that stands without obstruction.\n\nThe ultimate sage does not proclaim himself to the world,\nyet all things stand naturally in their place.\nWithout encumbrance in adaptation, all under heaven flows open and clear.\n\nObserving the conduct of the ultimate sage,\ndelving deep into the intent of virtue and Dao,\nexamining the customs of the world—\nonly then can one truly grasp and elucidate.\n\nTo take the world as no burden is the foundation of learning.\nAll who study seek only to restore their true nature.\nTo never take the world as burden is what learning cannot yet reach.\nIf one seeks a child by beating a drum, it proves the child has already gone—\nseeking cannot catch what has already passed.\n\nTo preserve the natural state,\nto abandon what one does—\nthen the Dao becomes effortlessly smooth.\n\nThe Master Laozi said:\n\nTo revere power and hoard wealth—these are what people covet.\nYet when compared to the body, they are base.\nFor the body, what is noble is to preserve its clarity and ease, ensuring tranquility.\n\nThe common crowd knows only to elevate themselves through power and enrich themselves with wealth,\nyet they fail to recognize that those who dwell in such things\ndo not fully possess the completeness of ease and tranquility.\nThus, they devalue what they revere while fortifying their foundation.\n\nTherefore, the sage eats only to fill the void and nourish the *qi*,\nwears only to cover the form and ward off cold.\nWhen desires are met, the belly is content, the body is at ease—\nyet beyond this, it becomes a source of harm to life and essence.\nThus, the sage rejects it.\n\nNot coveting gain, not hoarding excess—\nnaturally attaining what is right, not what is greedily sought.\nThings accumulate by their own nature, not by excessive hoarding.\n\nWith clear eyes that do not gaze, still ears that do not listen,\nnot dominated by sounds and colors, naturally serene and quiet.\nWith a closed mouth that does not speak, a mind that does not deliberate—\nnot rashly asserting words, responding only when pressed.\nNot preemptively scheming, deciding only when confronted.\n\nAbandoning cleverness, returning to the primordial simplicity—\nnot fixating on what lies before the ears and eyes,\nbut aligning with the origin of form and substance.\nResting the spirit, discarding contrivance—\ncontrivance being artifice—\nrest means remaining undistracted externally,\ndiscarding means remaining unperturbed internally.\n\nWithout preference or aversion, this is called Great Harmony.\nEven application to things makes it harmonious.\n\nTo remove filth and burdens, nothing surpasses never departing from the origin.\nWhat need is there for failure?\n\nIf one abides here, grasping the essence of the Dao,\nthen the heart’s impurities are naturally purged,\nthe heart’s burdens naturally removed,\nand peace prevails.\n\nThus, those who understand the harmony of nurturing life\ncannot be swayed by profit.\nProfit lies in harmony and goodness—this the nurturer knows.\nTo cling to profit is to court death’s gain.\n\nThose who harmonize inner and outer cannot be lured by power.\nPower is alignment.\nIf I follow the natural Dao to serve others,\nthen others’ inherent nature is already within me,\nand alignment is achieved—what external power could lure?\n\nThe greatest \"outside\" is boundless, the most noble \"inside\" is supreme.\nTo move in and out without obstruction,\nto merge mystically with all things—\nthis is the boundless \"outside\" and the supreme \"inside.\"\n\nNoble and vast, it cannot be partial—only the Dao suffices.\nTo know the great and noble, where can one fail?\n\nTo guard simplicity is to uphold the natural principle of self-trust,\nand thus simplicity is attained.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe ancients who cultivated the Dao\nregulated emotions and nature,\ngoverned the mind and refined technique.\n\nIf desires do not exceed proper measure,\nthen the fullness of nature’s vitality is preserved.\nIf joy and anger are not reckless,\nthen the mind’s chaos is rectified.\n\nNurture with harmony, govern with moderation—\nharmony to sustain life, moderation to fulfill desires.\nTo rejoice in the Dao and forget poverty,\nto embrace virtue and forget destitution.\n\nThe Dao conquers, so one takes responsibility;\nvirtue suffices, so one attains richness.\nNature has what it does not desire—\nwithout desire, nothing is lacking.\nThe self-sufficient always obtain.\n\nThe heart has what it does not delight in—\nwithout delight, nothing is forced.\nNot delighting in any circumstance,\none can thus become the joy of all under heaven.\n\nWhat harms nature is not burdened upon virtue.\nDesire that does not benefit nature—\nvirtue is achieved only through stillness.\nWhat harms life is not allowed to disrupt harmony.\nStillness benefits life; harmony arises from desire’s regulation.\n\nTo let the body roam freely while observing measure\ncan serve as a model for all under heaven.\nFor the greatest virtue is never excessive—\neven unrestrained freedom can become a model of sorrow.\n\nTo eat according to hunger, clothe according to need,\ndwell comfortably, act in accord with nature—\nthis is the sage’s adherence to simplicity.\n\nTo relinquish the world yet not possess it,\nto entrust all things yet not exploit them—\nhow could poverty, wealth, nobility, or lowliness\ncause one to lose their true nature and life?\n\nThings have their own essence;\nit is unknown whether they fully preserve themselves.\nIf so, one may be said to embody the Dao.\n\n**Guarding Clarity**\nClarity without obstruction can reflect the delusions of desire.\n\nLaozi said:\nWhat humans receive from Heaven—\nthe ears and eyes drawn to sounds and colors,\nthe mouth and nose to fragrances and foul odors,\nthe skin to cold and warmth—\ntheir nature is the same.\n\nSome die, some live;\nsome become noble, some become base—\nthe means of regulation differ.\n\nLife’s essence is uniform in its six adaptations.\nIf externally one does not overindulge,\nand internally one does not violate harmony,\nthen one’s lifespan is determined by Heaven,\nand one’s conduct returns to its natural course.\n\nIf sounds and colors disrupt the will,\nand extremes of cold and heat assail the body,\nthen one naturally becomes a companion of death,\na follower of delusion.\nIs this not Heaven’s gift turned into human loss,\nwhere regulation fails to suit?\n\nThe spirit is the depths of wisdom—\nwith profound stillness, wisdom’s use is inexhaustible.\nClarity of spirit brings clarity of mind—\nif not obscured by things, all actions become discerning.\n\nWisdom is the reflection of the heart—\nwhere the heart reaches, wisdom follows to unravel it.\nPublic wisdom mirrors an even heart.\nThe heart can command, wisdom can strategize;\nwhen empty and responsive, the heart’s rectitude is revealed.\n\nNo one mirrors themselves in flowing water,\nbut in still water—\nbecause it is clear and tranquil.\nNot receiving externally makes it clear,\nnot being disturbed internally makes it still.\nIts reflective power is naturally luminous.\n\nThus, with spirit clear and intent even,\none can discern the nature of all things.\nTo perceive their nature is the work of a still heart.\n\nMoreover, excessive action leaves omissions,\nlabor and agitation leave no reflection.\nClear and even as water,\nthings naturally reveal themselves.\n\nThus, action arises from what is not forced—\nto exhaust with labor is to use without purpose.\nTo stillness comes clarity as a mirror—\nto use without using.\n\nThe mirror’s clarity is not sullied by dust—\nthe spirit’s clarity is not misled by desires.\nA clear spirit brings clear wisdom;\nclear wisdom does not stray from natural virtue,\nand thus there are no burdens.\n\nWhen the heart reaches its limit,\nthe spirit is naturally present within.\nThe heart is direct, the spirit is subtle in its function.\n\nThe mind moves where intent directs,\nand stills where intent rests.\nHow could one not be serene and settled?\n\nReturning to emptiness,\ndryness and agitation dissolve.\nEmptiness is the dwelling of the spirit—\nreturning to it, one hollows the heart and entrusts it to the spirit,\nforgets desires, and attains discernment.\n\nThus, yin and yang, water and fire,\nno longer drag or alter one’s self.\nThis is the play of the Sage.\n\nThe spirit plays with transformation.\nTherefore, to govern the world,\none must first grasp the nature of life and fate.\n\nWithin the realm of life,\nonly nature (*xìng*) and fate (*mìng*) exist.\nWhat all share in preserving,\nyet differ in kind—\nthis cannot be reached without the spirit,\nnor governed without the great harmony.\n\nTo abide in truth,\nadjust the form, and find ease—\nthen ease is without excess;\nto follow nature and proceed—\nthen all actions are genuine.\n\nYet great names and great masters arise from here.\nLaozi said:\n*\"The so-called Sage adjusts their emotions alone.\nThey eat to fill their belly,\nclothe themselves to suit their form,\nmoderate themselves—\nand thus the hearts of greed and filth have no opportunity to arise.\nWhat one cannot avoid in life is food and clothing.\nMeasuring the body, filling the belly—\nthe rest are superfluous things.\nBut if internally and externally there is no defilement,\nthey are called Sages.\nThus, those who can possess the world\nmust not covet the world.\nThe Sage does not use the world to indulge their desires,\nbut forgets the world.\nTherefore, those who can govern it\nare entrusted with its name.\n\nThose who seek great fame and reputation\ndo not adorn themselves with deceit—\nyet petty actions are all deceitful.\nIf one truly grasps the nature of life and fate,\nthen benevolence and righteousness follow naturally.\nThose who understand life and fate\nsee their reputation spontaneously manifest as benevolent and righteous deeds.\n\nWhen the spirit is unobstructed,\nthe heart carries nothing,\ncommuning freely and effortlessly—\nserene, without concern—\ninternally unburdened, they are empty and open.\nWorldly gains cannot entice them—\nno greed.\nSounds and colors cannot seduce them—\nno attachment.\nPersuasive speech cannot deceive them—\nno confusion.\nThe wise cannot manipulate them—\nno deception.\nThe bold cannot frighten them—\nno fear.\nThis is the Way of the True Person,\nthe purest essence.\n\nLife begets life and does not die,\ntransformation transforms and does not cease.\nThe Dao ever endures,\ntransforming all things—\nthus, aligning with Heaven is unseen,\nharmonizing with the Way is unfathomable.\nThose who do not grasp this Dao,\nthough their wisdom encompasses Heaven and Earth,\ntheir brilliance rivals the sun and moon,\ntheir eloquence dissolves like gold and stone—\nstill, they cannot govern the world.\nAs *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"Huizi’s arguments, though intricate, can be unraveled.\"*\nYet such talents profit nothing in ruling the world.\n\nIf one follows Heaven in obscurity,\nharmonizes with things in mystery,\nthen the mechanisms of transformation can be verified,\nand the principles of life and fate understood.\nOnly then, whether at home or in the realm,\ndoes one never fail to act appropriately.\n\nIf one relies on clever schemes,\nsharp perception,\neloquent persuasion, or moral influence—\nthese are but partial achievements,\nnot the complete path to governance.\nThus, the Sage does not abandon their foundation.\nThey guard the origin of life and transformation,\nnot relying on sharp perception for governance—\nand so the world naturally aligns,\nthe people say, *\"This is effortless.\"*\n\nTo guard stillness—\nthe Sage finds ease here,\nas the root of life and the foundation of virtue.\nLaozi said:\n*\"Serene, tranquil, and undisturbed—\nthis is how one nourishes life.\nFulfilling one’s natural span,\nonly then can it be called nourishment.\nHarmonious, joyful, and empty—\nthis is how one establishes virtue.\nReceiving things in emptiness,\nmeeting affairs with harmony—\nvirtue resides here and is complete.\nExternally undisturbed within,\nnature finds its proper place—\nsounds and colors become discarded things,\nnature remains whole.\nInternally unmoved and harmonious,\nvirtue finds its rightful place—\nnot burdened by affection,\nunimpaired in dealing with others—\nthus virtue finds its rest in its place.\nNourishing life to sustain the world,\nembracing virtue to complete one’s years—\nthis is to truly embody the Dao.\"*\n\nWhen nature is not yet complete,\nit is dragged by desires—\nand thus cannot govern the world.\nWhen virtue is about to fail,\nit is weighed down by things—\nand thus cannot complete one’s lifespan.\nYet externally, things assail,\ninjuring the center and altering nature—\neven if one wishes to avoid distress,\nhow could it be possible?\n\nThus, serene stillness preserves life,\nonly then can one venture into action,\nharmony and joy then secure the end.\nThose who embody the Dao are such.\n\nIf so, then blood and vessels flow without obstruction,\nthe five viscera hold no stagnant *qi*—\nform harmonious, nature still—\nwhat ailments could afflict them?\n\nWhen blood and vessels stagnate,\nit is due to insufficient nourishment.\nWhen the five viscera accumulate *qi*,\nit stems from excessive joy and anger.\nFortune and misfortune cannot sway them,\npraise cannot soil them—\nthose who disrupt nature and harmony,\nwho seek fame and fortune,\nare those who harm life.\nWithout their age, who could save them?\n\nThis is the Sage’s discourse with the Dao.\n\nThe Way of serene stillness is the Sage’s path,\nin accord with governance, opposed to chaos—\nthus, without a wise ruler,\nthe self-preserving Way cannot be upheld.\n\nEven if one has talent but lacks the right time,\none’s very life cannot escape peril—\nhow much less so without the Way!\n\nThis is the Sage’s exhortation toward the Way.\n\nMoreover, those with the capacity for office,\nyet unfit for the shifting demands of power,\ncannot escape the troubles of an age.\nHow much less so those who do not uphold stillness\nand tread upon perilous thresholds!\n\nHe who scrutinizes the tip of an autumn hair\ncannot hear the thunder of the heavens;\nhe who attunes to the sound of jade and stone\ncannot perceive the form of Tai Mountain—\nthus, small things fixated upon,\ngreat things are forgotten.\n\nOne indulgence in sensual pleasures,\nand the distant reaches of true nature are lost.\n\nNow, all things converge upon us,\nplucking our vitality,\nconsuming our essence—\nlike springs and wells exhausted.\nThe allure of sound and color,\nfrom every side, cannot be fully resisted—\nthus, even Heaven’s own essence is drained.\n\nThough one might wish to abstain,\nhow could it be possible?\n\nFor these are ever before the ears and eyes.\n\nThe water in a basin, if made clear,\ntakes a day to reveal the brows and lashes;\nif muddied, even a moment’s disturbance\nmakes roundness and squareness invisible.\n\nThe mirror of a tranquil mind exists only for those who attain stillness.\nThus, when one is ensnared by desires,\neven calamities as vast as mountains\nremain unseen.\n\nHuman spirit is hard to purify but easily clouded—\nlike water in a basin.\n\nTo uphold the Dao beyond the Dao,\none must model Heaven.\nThe Dao of modeling Heaven\nhas no end to what it models,\nyet aligns with the Great Harmony.\n\nLaozi said:\n*The Supreme Sage models Heaven,*\n*The sages of antiquity modeled the patterns of Heaven’s Way,*\n*Teaching nothing yet transforming all,*\n*Abandoning cleverness yet achieving success.*\n*Virtue renews daily,*\n*Thus no name can be given to it,*\n*Mysterious function leaves no trace—*\n*Hence, the power of the Sovereign is unknown.*\n\nThe next rank are the superior worthies,\nwho uphold the Dao of virtue as supreme.\nBelow them are the appointed ministers—\nthe path of peril and ruin,\nfor it is the way of relying solely on one’s own strength.\n\nThe superior worthy is the root of delusion,\nfor the superior worthy brings contention,\nand contention is the origin of chaos.\n\nTo model Heaven is the Way to govern Heaven and Earth.\nTo follow the Dao of Nature,\nthen the Two Principles harmonize in governance.\n\nEmptiness and stillness are the essence—\nHeaven’s substance.\nEmpty and receptive to all,\nstill and sustaining all,\nholding back the tumult of myriad things.\n\nKnowing the Dao of emptiness and stillness,\none can complete the beginning and end.\nNever suppressing things,\nyet letting them reach their own extremes—\nlike the seasons passing without end.\n\nThus, the Sage governs through stillness,\nand governs through movement as chaos.\nStillness restores each to its true nature and life.\n\nIt is said:\n*Do not disturb, do not entangle,*\n*And all things will naturally clarify.*\n*Do not alarm, do not terrify,*\n*And all things will naturally order themselves—*\n*Such is the Way of Heaven.*\n\n*\"Entangle\"* means excessive schemes,\n*\"Terrify\"* means imposing harsh decrees.\n\nTo uphold weakness,\nto dwell in the position where none can rival you—\nthus, the Way of great victory is fulfilled.\n\nLaozi says:\n\nWhen the Son of Heaven, the public lords, and the marquises treat the realm and the world as their own home, and all things as their livestock, harboring the vastness of the world, possessing the abundance of myriad things, then their *qi* becomes dissipated and their wills grow arrogant. This is what is meant by: *\"Nobility without arrogance\"*—yet arrogance will inevitably arise.\n\nThe great will invade the small—such as when Jin annihilated You, or Chu attacked Xing. The small will act haughty and domineer—such as Cao Gong and Wei Xian. Their hearts are extravagant and broad, like a sudden wind or violent rain, unable to endure long.\n\nThe *qi* of strength and might—even Heaven and Earth cannot sustain it long, let alone a king who indulges in excess and usurpation. Therefore, the Sage governs with the Dao to restrain them. What else but the Way of emptiness and softness could bring stability?\n\nHolding to One and doing nothing, diminishing the clashing *qi*, balancing the extremes—\nSeeing the small and guarding the soft, withdrawing without possession;\nSeeing the small yet achieving the great, guarding the soft yet controlling the hard.\n\nModeling oneself after the rivers and seas—\nThe rivers and seas do not strive, yet their merit and name naturally manifest.\nThose who dwell in lowliness are honored by the multitude;\nTheir bodies accept counsel, and things accord with them—\nThus, without seeking, their name is fulfilled;\nWithout contending, their deeds are accomplished.\n\nNot forcing, they achieve kingship.\nThose who rely on virtue are at peace; those who rely on force rebel.\n\nAs the mother of the world, they preserve their spirit undying—\nFor the mother is the essence of softness.\nThe Sage follows this to preserve the spirit.\n\nSelf-preservation ensures nobility—\nTo desire noble status, one must first love one’s body.\nThus, by conquering oneself with the Dao, one’s life may be long preserved.\nIf the body is preserved, how could nobility perish?\n\nWith the power of ten thousand chariots, treating all things as instruments for merit and name—\nMerit and name, great or small, are established according to one’s station.\nWith authority so heavy, one cannot treat oneself lightly.\nAs *Zhuangzi* says: *\"To treat one’s body lightly is to lose one’s state.\"*\n\nTo treat oneself lightly is to fail in merit and name.\nThere has never been a case where the body is not at ease yet the state is well-governed.\n\nThe Dao achieves the great through the small, the many through the few—\nThe resources of the great are but a single hair’s breadth.\nThe essence of the many is but a single hairpin’s length.\n\nThus, the Sage governs the world with the Dao:\nThe subtle and mysterious are seen as small,\nThe frugal and diminished are seen as few—\nSeeing small, one achieves the great;\nSeeing few, one achieves perfection.\n\nThe Dao achieves greatness through subtlety and mystery,\nVirtue achieves beauty through diminishment and lack.\n\nThe Way of Heaven lowers the high and raises the low,\nDiminishes the surplus and nourishes the deficient—\nLike drawing a bow, where balance is key.\nThe rivers and seas occupy the world’s deficient places,\nThus all under Heaven return to them and honor them.\n\nTherefore, the Sage maintains humility, modesty, stillness, and yielding—\nThis is to appear lowly,\nTo have an empty heart with nothing—\nThis is to appear deficient.\nFollowing the example of the rivers and seas.\n\nTo appear lowly is to attain the high;\nTo appear deficient is to attract the virtuous.\nThe heart’s constant humility brings virtue’s ever-greater height;\nThe body’s constant retreat brings action’s ever-greater progress.\n\nThe proud cannot stand, the extravagant cannot endure.\nThe forceful perish, the overfull are destroyed.\nSudden winds and torrential rains do not last a day;\nA shallow valley cannot fill in an instant.\nThe valley is narrow and confined—\nIf filled in an instant, it will overflow.\nSudden winds and torrential rains embody forceful *qi*,\nThus they cannot endure and are extinguished.\nThe shallow valley occupies forceful ground,\nThus it cannot avoid being seized.\nSeize their return, honor their virtue.\n\nTherefore, the Sage embraces the feminine and the yielding,\nAbandons arrogance and excess,\nDares not act with forceful *qi*,\nFollowing the warnings of Heaven and Earth.\n\nEmbracing the feminine, they establish the masculine;\nNot daring to be extravagant, they endure long.\nOnly those who embrace the feminine\nCan possess the virtue of standing firm.\n\nLaozi says: *\"The Way of Heaven reaches its extreme and reverses,\nFills and then diminishes—*\nLike the sun and moon.\nAt noon, the sun declines;\nWhen the moon is full, it wanes.\n\nThus, the Sage diminishes daily,\nDaring not to be self-satisfied with clashing *qi*,\nAdvancing daily with the feminine,\nTheir merit and virtue never decay—\nThis is the Way of Heaven.\n\nAdvancing daily with the feminine means\nPushing softness to govern things.\n\nThe Way of Heaven diminishes the full and benefits the humble;\nThe Sage follows this law.\nThus, perfect virtue renews itself daily without replacement.\n\nHuman nature universally desires the high and rejects the low,\nDesires gain and rejects loss,\nDesires profit and rejects illness,\nDesires honor and rejects disgrace,\nDesires nobility and rejects lowliness—\nAll people act this way, yet cannot achieve it.\nTo grasp it tightly is to fail to obtain it.\n\nThings naturally change and transform;\nTheir inherent patterns and forces are balanced.\nIf one waits for completion, success will come.\nIf one waits for completion, one will fail to obtain it.\n\nSuppose those who hold such positions\nHad already determined their proper measure—\nCould they, through partial desires and rigid adherence, truly attain it?\n\nTherefore, the Sage follows Heaven:\nAchieving without action, obtaining without grasping,\nRiding the natural course, thus succeeding with the times,\nGaining with things.\n\nAligning with people’s emotions yet differing in method,\nThey endure long.\nAligning in their desired ends,\nDiffering in their chosen paths,\nReversing their private loves and aversions,\nThus forming the virtue of enduring long.\n\nHence, the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors had warning vessels,\nCalled *yòuzhī*—\nWhen empty, they stand upright;\nWhen full, they overturn.\nThe details are recorded in *Zhōu Yǔ*.\n\nThings flourish then decline,\nThe sun reaches its zenith and moves,\nThe moon is full then wanes,\nJoy reaches its peak and sorrow follows.\n\nTherefore, the keen and wise guard with stupidity,\nThe most discerning have no followers,\nHiding brilliance and blending with the multitude.\nThe well-read and eloquent guard with frugality,\nBoasting of ability brings disgrace,\nHolding back without loss.\n\nThe martial and courageous guard with caution,\nLightly treating enemies leads to defeat,\nCautiousness preserves victory.\n\nThe wealthy and expansive guard with restraint,\nArrogance and excess bring daily peril,\nHumility and diminishment bring daily blessings.\n\nVirtue bestowed upon the world is guarded with yielding,\nSelf-praise leads to ruin,\nPromoting others ensures completeness—\nThese five virtues are how the ancient kings governed the world.\n\nTo hold the world is to reach the utmost.\nIf one clings to extreme desires while holding an extreme position,\nCollapse will follow.\nWithout these five virtues, how could one guard it?\n\nThose who follow this Dao\nDo not desire fullness,\n\nThe essence lies in harmony within constancy—\nLike the disciplined warrior’s tools.\n\nOnly by not being full\nDoes one endure without renewal.\nThrough humility and emptiness, decay occurs,\nYet this decay nurtures the renewal of virtue and power.\n\nLaozi said:\n*The Sage closes with the yin and opens with the yang—*\nThis is called the Great Harmony.\n\nTo reach the point of no delight\nIs to attain the state of no discontent.\nNeither approval nor disapproval,\nThen constancy is achieved.\n\nWithout delight, there is eternal delight.\nWithout delight, the utmost delight is attained.\nWhere delight resides, sorrow follows—\nOnly those who forget their delight\nNeed no prompting to reach its peak.\n\nThus, inner delight transcends the external,\nNot relying on external delight to fill the inner.\nInner delight transcends—\nI am unrestrained beyond things;\nDelight within—\nThings conform to me,\nAnd thus, even in loss, there is gain.\n\nTo possess self-delight is to possess self-will,\nTo be nobly above all things,\nUnseen yet sovereign—\nThis is true nobility.\n\nThe reason for this is:\nTo govern the world by becoming its essential core,\nNot in others, but in oneself,\nNot in people, but in the body.\nWhen the body is attained, all things are complete.\n\nThose who attain themselves\nBring harmony to heaven, earth, and all things.\nThus, those who master the arts of the heart\nTranscend external desires and aversions,\nAbandoning all as discarded things.\n\nTherefore, there is no joy, no anger,\nNo delight, no suffering—\nAll things merge in the Mysterious Unity,\nNeither affirmation nor negation.\nJudgment arises from love and hatred;\nWhen the heart is empty, things naturally merge in the Mysterious Unity.\nThus, one does not know how to abandon,\nAnd all distinctions are exhausted.\n\nTherefore, the scholar has fixed principles,\nThe sage has unchanging conduct—\nThough not forgetting their essence,\nThey attain self-contentment and self-Dao.\n\nThey do not rely on power to be honored,\nNor on wealth to be rich,\nNor on strength to prevail.\nThey do not covet goods or power,\nNor crave fame or status,\nNor take nobility as security,\nNor lowliness as peril.\nIf one’s place is fixed,\nWhat need is there for external support?\n\nForm, spirit, qi, and will\nEach reside in their proper place.\nThe four coexist,\nAnd the path of harmony\nThus avoids contradiction.\n\nEven the scholar’s and sage’s moral integrity\nCan be thus—\nHow much more so for the Sage of complete virtue?\n\nThe body is the dwelling of life,\nResiding in the form.\nQi is the origin of life,\nRooted in essence.\nThe spirit is the governor of life,\nBy governance in the spirit.\nIf one loses its place,\nThe three are harmed.\nIf one loses the proper nourishment of its place,\nAll are harmed together.\n\nThus, those who take the spirit as master\nFind the form benefiting accordingly—\nGoverned so as not to transgress,\nHence its benefit.\nThose who take the form as governor\nHarm the spirit.\nIndulging in excess, overfeeding,\nHarms the spirit.\nThe greedy, gluttonous, and desirous\nAre blinded by power and wealth,\nTempted by fame and status—\nThough their intelligence surpasses others,\nTheir spirit weakens with time,\nLost in excess without return.\nThe body becomes rigid, the center blocked—\nNo passage remains.\n\nRigidity of the form is closure,\nLack of harmonious qi is obstruction.\nThus, there are times of blindness and forgetfulness,\nSelf-loss.\n\nExternal allure and internal depletion\nOver time lead to obscurity.\nGoing forth without knowing the way back,\nThey suffer the affliction of blindness and forgetfulness.\n\nSpirit and will—\nWhen still, they grow daily stronger;\nWhen agitated, they weaken daily, aging.\nA full spirit encompasses all things—\nThis is due to stillness.\nA constrained form falters—\nThis is due to movement.\nHow can one neglect the rhythms of flourishing and decline?\n\nThus, the Sage nurtures the spirit,\nHarmonizes and weakens the qi,\nBalances and levels the form,\nAnd floats with the Dao.\nThough things come and go,\nAll conform to the Dao.\n\nThus, the transformations of all things\nAre without exception,\nAnd all affairs\nAre without resistance.\nIn harmony with what is transformed,\nIn accord with what changes.\n\nTo guard simplicity—\nNot adding desire to the nature of life,\nYet encompassing the roots of transformation—\nThis is called simplicity.\n\nLaozi said:\n*The True Person*\nIs one whose nature aligns with the Dao—\nNot acting of oneself,\nYet in accord with the transformations of the world.\n\nThus, having yet appearing as nonexistent,\nSubstantial yet appearing as empty—\nThough all things are real,\nThe true nature knows no abode.\n\nCultivating the inner without governing the outer—\nThere has never been one who governs the inner yet desires the outer.\n\nClarifying the Great Primordial,\nWithout action, returning to simplicity—\nFor without action, simplicity is achieved,\nThen the virtuous in truth\nMove and rest within the realm of emptiness and whiteness.\n\nEmbodying the origin, embracing the spirit,\nRoaming the roots of heaven and earth—\nEmbodying the essence of primordial qi,\nEmbracing the spirit of transformation,\nResiding before all things.\n\nVague and unassuming beyond dust and filth,\nAdrift in the business of nothingness,\nSeparate from defilement,\nTaking non-action as constancy.\n\nMechanical cleverness is not borne in mind,\nExamined for flaws, unchanging with things—\n*Examined* is also *abandoned*.\nNot borne in mind, what flaws remain?\nThen, as things move of themselves,\nWhy follow along?\n\nConsider this:\nThings are but a moment’s dwelling.\nWhat was not is not now—\nLogic prevents transformation.\nYet those who judge the world,\nWho fixate on doctrine,\nStill uphold their forms,\nNo longer following folly.\nHow much more so for those whose nature aligns with the Dao,\nDrawn along effortlessly?\n\nSeeing the transformations of things,\nYet guarding their origin—\nThis is called not conforming to things.\n\nThe heart and intention are focused inward,\nCommuning with the One through penetration—\nQi unified, unadulterated,\nPenetrating yet unchanging.\n\nDwelling without knowing action,\nMoving without knowing direction—\nWithout action, without cause.\nNot learning yet knowing,\nNot seeing yet perceiving—\nIn harmony with things, yet self-revealing.\nWithout doing, yet accomplished,\nWithout governing, yet discerning.\nFollowing the world yet self-fulfilled,\nConforming to kinds yet self-distinguished.\n\nResponding yet not compelled,\nActing yet not forced,\nMoving only when unavoidable—\n\nThe Way/Dao is never first to begin.\nLike light’s radiance, like shadow’s reflection,\nA body of purity—clear yet illuminating,\nEmpty yet responsive.\n\nFollowing the Dao as its measure,\nYet awaiting the natural unfolding—\nTo follow is to await;\nThis is but metaphorical speech.\n\nVast and empty within,\nClear and still without,\nThis is its true essence.\n\nTaking myriad births as one transformation,\nCountless differences as one origin—\nTo dwell in the origin is to align with it.\n\nQi refined yet unused,\nSpirit potent yet not employed—\nUnused yet aligned, this is called supreme refinement.\nUnmoving yet penetrating, this is called supreme spirit.\n\nStanding within the primordial Great Unity,\nFirm in the center of supreme refinement—\nSleeping without dreams,\nNo fancies in mind.\n\nKnowledge does not stir,\nIt does not precede things;\nMovement is formless—\nThe traces of mysterious response are unseen.\n\nStillness is without substance,\nNot resting upon something to establish stillness.\nExisting yet as if nonexistent,\nLiving yet as if dead—\nNot clinging to life or death,\nYet not without the marvelous use of spirit.\n\nEntering and exiting without obstruction,\nNo hindrance to gold or stone.\nCommanding ghosts and gods—\nThis is but the merging of spirit with emptiness.\n\nThus, the spirit can ascend to the Dao’s realm:\nWith virtue/power above, one may attain the supreme Dao?\n\nTo let the spirit flow freely,\nYet not stray from its source—\nThis is called recovering the essence of one’s nature.\n\nDay and night without pause,\nIn harmony with things like spring’s breath,\nQi meeting all things without gap or breath.\nThis is the merging of times and life within the heart.\n\nThe heart does not generate itself;\nIt merges with times and thus generates.\nHence, form may fade while spirit never transforms—\nForm aligns with things, so it transforms;\nSpirit aligns with the Dao, so it endures.\n\nWith unchanging essence responding to change,\nEndless transformations without cessation—\nFire and water’s functions cannot self-regulate,\nTheir kind is transformed yet cannot transform things;\nThe untransformed alone can transform.\n\nWith an unchanging essence transforming boundless things,\nThus it cannot be exhausted.\n\nTransformation returns to the formless—\nThings born each return to their root.\nThe untransformed arises with heaven and earth—\nThe Dao precedes the forms,\nSo the ever-arising never dies,\nIts arising is death itself;\nThe transformer never transforms,\nIts transformation is the thing itself.\n\nThe meaning has already been revealed above.\nThis is the true person’s play,\nThe pure Dao’s essence.\n\n**End of Scroll Three of the *Tongxuan Zhenjing* (Scripture of Unified Mysterious Truth)**\n**Begin Scroll Four of the *Tongxuan Zhenjing* (Scripture of Unified Mysterious Truth)**\n\n**符言篇**\n\n*符* is *contract*—*speech* is *principle*.\nThus, through speech’s subtle contract with principle,\nOne awakens to the Dao’s mystery beyond words—\nThis is the true accord.\n\nLaozi says:\nThe Dao is supremely high, without surpassing;\nSupremely deep, without descending.\nAbove, it transcends the highest;\nBelow, it descends to the lowest.\nThus it can be high and deep,\nAscend and descend.\n\nLevel as the plumb-line, straight as the square,\nNot because the balance makes it level—\nEverywhere it is even.\nNot because the square makes it straight—\nEverywhere it is true.\n\nRound as the compass, square as the set-square,\nYet not round by being round—no roundness,\nNot square by being square—no squareness.\nIt enfolds heaven and earth yet has no surface or depth,\nIts vastness knows no outside, its subtlety no inside.\nPiercing like a hollow dome, yet unimpeded,\nGreat circle without bounds, great passage without obstruction.\n\nThus those who embody the Dao:\nNeither angry nor joyful,\nTheir sitting free of care, their sleep without dreams,\nThey name things as they see them, respond as events arise.\nThis was explained earlier.\n\nLaozi says:\nThose who crave fame as a corpse must create affairs,\nAnd affairs, once born, abandon the public for the private.\nThose who seek fame as lords must have affairs,\nAnd affairs, once born, breed discord—\nThus one must abandon fame and return to the public.\n\nTo double the Dao and burden oneself,\nTo court praise and do good,\nTo establish a name and be deemed virtuous—\n*Double* means *betray*.\nBetraying the Dao to seek praise is not true goodness.\nChasing convention to gain a name is not true virtue.\n\nGovernance that defies principle brings many reproaches,\nActions that defy the times yield no merit.\nTo follow principle is to act with few concerns yet achieve great deeds;\nTo defy the times is to labor much yet see little fruit.\nFalsely scheming for advantage—\nWhen success fails to justify the effort,\nWhen failure brings ruin—\nThose who seek praise and immediate effect,\nWho curry favor with the times—\nTheir unfinished works bring ruin upon themselves.\n\nLaozi says:\nDo not be a corpse for fame,\nDo not be a treasury for schemes,\nDo not be a burden for affairs,\nDo not be a master of cleverness.\nHide in the formless, act without weariness,\nDo not precede fortune, do not initiate calamity.\nMove without being the master—then no form;\nNo form, then no fortune to welcome or ward off.\nRespond as it is sung—then no weariness;\nNo weariness, then no future calamity.\n\nBegin in the formless, act only when unavoidable.\nTo seek fortune first is to invite calamity;\nTo seek profit first is to court harm.\nTo govern before signs appear is to ensure fortune;\nTo cut off extraordinary gain is to avoid harm.\n\nThus those who act without doing—\nIf they lose their tranquility, they are in peril;\nThose who govern without doing—\nIf they lose their order, they bring chaos.\nTo lose tranquility means to abandon inner peace for outer seeking—\nThen rigidity ensues.\nTo lose order means to forsake self to govern others—\nThen confusion follows.\n\nThus one should not be polished like jade,\nNor rigid like stone.\nFor jade and stone, once divided, spawn contention.\nThe finer the carving, the sharper the blade;\nThe finer the horn, the deadlier the strike.\nSweet springs run dry, straight trees are felled.\nThings of beauty invite harm,\nMen who court fame invite disaster.\nFlowery words bring later regret—\nFirst to flatter with eloquence,\nThen to invite ruin upon oneself.\nStone may wound the mountain that hides it—\nMountains that do not conceal treasure are soon stripped bare,\nMen who do not guard their words soon invite calamity.\nThe peril of silence lies in speech itself.\n\nEarlier, the common folk suffered calamity\nBecause of their reckless debates on state laws and rites.\n\nMoreover, the virtuous are warned thrice to hold their tongues,\nWhile the petty chatter—\nHow could they avoid disaster?\n\nLaozi says:\nTo act in accord with the times,\nMove by following—\nThe unknowing turn fortune to calamity.\nTo follow the times,\nMove by acting—\nThe unknowing lose fortune through it.\n\nThe sage’s governance:\nKnowing beforehand life and death,\nMeasuring gains and losses,\nThus opening and closing doors with precision,\nUnshaken by honor or disgrace,\nOnly then does one attain enduring safety and preserve the self.\n\nAs for the ignorant,\nThey often enjoy fortune then wield power,\nThus when fortune peaks, calamity arises.\nIt is not that fortune and calamity oppose each other—\nRather, their use is misaligned.\n\nHeaven as a canopy, earth as a pivot—\nThose who wield the Dao skillfully\nAre never exhausted.\nEarth as pivot, heaven as canopy—\nThose who wield the Dao skillfully\nAre never harmed.\nTo employ the five phases is to know their victories—\nMetal and fire attack each other,\nAnd declining kings rise in succession.\n\nWhat heaven covers is never unsuited—\nThe Dao’s embrace is all-encompassing.\n\n「Thus, the knowing of the unknown is virtue; the knowing of the known is a flaw.\nThe knowing of the unknowing is beneficial, the knowing of the strong knowing is flawed.\nLaozi says: Mountains produce gold, stones produce jade—\nYet they destroy each other in return;\nWood breeds insects that devour it,\nHumans create affairs that betray them.\nWhen fame is sought, the Dao is lost;\nWhen schemes arise, harm is born.\n\nThose who delight in matters never fail to be entangled,\nThose who vie for profit never fail to be exhausted.\nThere is no crossing water without wetting one’s feet,\nNo passing through dust without staining one’s body.\nSkilled swimmers drown, skilled riders fall—\nEach meets ruin through their own pursuits.\n\nBoast of one’s abilities and lose one’s merit,\nExploit one’s talents and lose one’s life.\nSuccess lies in timing, not in strife,\nGovernance lies in the Dao, not in the sage.\nTiming brings success without forced contention,\nThe Dao thrives in self-respect—why seek the sage’s praise?\n\nEarth rests low yet does not contend for height,\nSo it remains secure without peril.\nWater flows downward yet does not vie for speed,\nSo it departs without delay.\nWhat the Dao values, what virtue esteems,\nIs height without contention, speed without haste.\n\nThus, the sage holds nothing and loses nothing,\nActs without contrivance and meets no defeat.\nThe Dao is formless, elusive—\nTo grasp it is to lose it.\nIt is not a physical body,\nDifficult to carve or shape—\nYet to force it is to invite ruin.\n\nLaozi says: One word cannot be exhausted,\nTwo words make the world follow,\nThree words command the feudal lords,\nFour words sway the world.\nFidelity brings exhaustion’s end,\nVirtue makes the world submit,\nPromoting worthy virtue—\nThe feudal lords rise in power,\nLoving the few while cherishing the many—\nThe world unites in harmony.\nHe who masters all four words\nAscends to emperorship,\nHe who gains but one\nDescends to conquest or aid.\n\nLaozi says: Humans have three deaths,\nNot by fate alone.\nExcess in eating and drinking\nDiminishes the body—\nIllness claims it;\nUnchecked joy in gain\nPursues it endlessly—\nPunishment claims it;\nWith few opposing many,\nWith weak defying the strong—\nWar claims it.\nThus, life and death depend on oneself,\nCalamity and fortune have no fixed gate.\nThey do not descend from heaven,\nBut arise from human competition.\n\nLaozi says: The greater the giving, the fairer the return,\nThe greater the grudge, the deeper the ruin.\nSparse giving yet high expectations,\nNurturing resentment yet hoping for no harm—\nSuch things do not exist.\nObserve how one proceeds,\nAnd one knows how they will return.\nHigh merit brings rich reward,\nDeep grudge invites great retribution.\nFollow their weight—\nLeave behind both debt and grace.\n\nLaozi says: Trace the heavenly command,\nRefine the heart’s art,\nBalance likes and dislikes,\nAlign with nature’s flow—\nAnd the Dao’s governance is complete.\nTrace the heavenly command,\nAnd one is undisturbed by fortune’s shift.\nRefine the heart’s art,\nAnd one does not err in joy or wrath.\nBalance likes and dislikes,\nAnd one does not greedily grasp the vain.\nAlign with nature’s flow,\nAnd one’s desires do not exceed their bounds.\nUndisturbed by fortune’s shift,\nAnd one’s actions follow the natural order.\nNo erring in joy or wrath,\nAnd one’s rewards and punishments are impartial.\nNot greedily grasping the vain,\nAnd one’s desires do not harm one’s nature.\nDesires not exceeding their bounds,\nAnd one knows how to nurture life with contentment.\n\nThese four principles,\nSeek not from others, nor borrow from men,\nBut return within oneself to find.\nUnderstanding these four,\nOne may call it great harmony.\nNot relying on others,\nOnly self-refinement suffices.\n\nLaozi says: Do not seek the blame of others,\nNor hate those who blame you.\nAvoid deceitful actions,\nAnd why would others blame you?\nHold within you compassion and forgiveness,\nAnd you will have no cause to reproach others.\nCultivate the virtue of good reputation,\nAnd do not seek others’ praise for yourself.\nRefine your own virtue,\nAnd do not seek others’ praise.\nIf you cannot prevent calamity from coming,\nTrust in your own non-invitation of it.\nIf you cannot ensure fortune will arrive,\nTrust in your own non-rejection of it.\nIf you cannot guard against unforeseen calamity,\nTrust in fate’s unerring course.\nIf you cannot demand that certain fortune will come,\nReceive what comes as it should.\nWhen calamity arrives, it is not your own creation—\nSo even in ruin, why lament?\nWhen fortune comes, it is not your own doing—\nSo even in gain, why rely?\n\nThus, dwell in ease and find joy in the heart,\nGovern without contrivance.\nSerene, content, and at leisure—\nThis is all.\n\nLaozi says: The Daoist guards what they already possess,\nAnd does not seek what they have not obtained.\nSeeking what they have not obtained,\nThey lose what they already possess;\nClinging to what they possess,\nThey gain what they truly desire.\nWhat they already possess is the spirit of their body,\nWhat they lack are myriad external skills.\nNow, abandoning the spirit of their body,\nThey pray for skills they have not yet attained.\nThe unattained may come,\nBut the spirit they once held is already forgotten.\nNot safeguarding the path to one gain,\nIt is hard to regret the loss of two.\nThus, the perfect one guards their root,\nAnd does not chase after superficial ends;\nThey value what is within,\nAnd do not control what is without.\n\nIf governance is not yet firmly established in avoiding chaos,\nThen those who strive for governance will surely perish.\nIf conduct cannot yet escape blame,\nThen those who rush for fame will surely falter.\nRoot firm, the state is at peace,\nActions aligned, no shame is incurred.\n\nThus, no fortune is greater than avoiding calamity,\nNo profit is greater than not losing.\nFortune without calamity—\nFortune is indeed great.\nProfit without loss—\nProfit is indeed vast.\n\nThus, things may bring gain through loss,\nOr loss through gain.\nOnly without calamity or fortune,\nIs there no loss or gain.\n\nThe Dao cannot be coerced for profit,\nYet it can bring tranquility and avoid harm.\nThe Daoist cannot be lured by profit,\nFor without profit, there is no harm.\nThus, the spirit finds peace,\nAnd the Dao comes naturally.\nThus, one who does not taste calamity will not taste fortune,\nOne who does not commit wrong will not earn merit.\nWithout calamity or fortune,\nWithout wrong or merit—\nThis is called great harmony.\n\nThe Dao says: Vague and obscure,\nFollowing heaven’s majesty,\nHarmonizing with heaven’s *qi*,\nWithout thought or planning,\nThe Dao says: The Dao is sovereign,\nVague and obscure—\nThe Dao’s depths are unfathomable, unseen.»\n\nThe present merely follows Heaven’s Way with emptiness,\nFor the body with non-action,\nFor the mind with no deliberation, thus complete—\nWithout labor, things accumulate naturally.\n\nWhat comes is not welcomed,\nWhat departs is not detained—\nLet it be as it finds itself.\nThough people move east, west, south, or north,\nThey stand alone at the center,\nTheir bodies respond to things yet endless,\nThe Dao abides within yet moves alone.\n\nThus, amid crookedness, they do not lose their straightness,\nTheir fullness lies in their bending.\nFlowing with the world yet never straying from their domain,\nThe vital *qi* circulates and the true essence remains.\n\nThey do not seek virtue,\nNor shun ugliness—\nThey follow Heaven’s Dao,\nNot initiating, not clinging to self,\nThey follow Heaven’s principle,\nNot premeditating, not neglecting the moment,\nThey align with Heaven’s timing—\nNot seeking gain, not rejecting fortune,\nThey conform to Heaven’s natural order.\n\nHeaven has no mind,\nYet speaks not and all things arise;\nHumans act without contrivance,\nYet plan not and all affairs succeed.\nWithin, no strange fortune,\nWithout, no strange calamity—\nThus, calamity and fortune do not arise,\nAnd who would be a thief to others?\n\nAll who have fortune also have calamity,\nNow that calamity and fortune are merged in obscurity,\nWho would harm others?\nThus, supreme virtue:\nWords align with the Way,\nActions align with fortune,\nHearts unite above and below,\nNo divergent paths—\nThose with partial views advance or retreat in error,\nYet open the Way to virtue,\nAnd the people turn toward it.\n\nPartial views are insufficient to transform customs,\nYet the right Way can guide the people.\nLaozi says:\nTo do good is to exhort,\nTo do evil is to observe—\nExhorting breeds blame,\nObserving breeds affliction.\nExhortation is encouragement,\nObservation is scrutiny.\nWhen humans do good,\nThey should daily encourage themselves.\nWhen there are evils,\nThey see their own faults and correct them,\nThus turning toward the right—\nThis is not encouraging others to do good.\nIf one takes themselves as good,\nAnd scrutinizes others’ evils to blame them,\nThen affliction arises.\nThus, exhorting to do good is itself not good.\nHence, the Way cannot be advanced to seek fame,\nNor can it be retreated to cultivate the self.\n\nThus, the Sage does not act to seek fame,\nNor does they use knowledge to seek praise—\nGovernance follows nature,\nThey contribute nothing of their own.\nAdvancing without embellishing wisdom to seek fame,\nRetreating to cultivate the self to govern themselves,\nPushing through naturally—\nHow could they exhaust others’ praise?\n\nThe doer has what may not be completed,\nThe seeker has what may not be obtained—\nHumans have limits, yet the Dao is unobstructed.\nHumans seek yet do not obtain,\nThe Dao acts not yet encompasses all.\nWisdom without action,\nLike lack of wisdom, yields equal results—\nAbility without exertion,\nLike lack of ability, yields equal merit.\nWisdom as if without wisdom,\nAbility as if without ability—\nThe Way is realized while human talents fade.\n\nWhen *virtue/power* fills within,\nHuman talents fade externally—\nThus, they have as if they lack,\nAnd reality as if it were void.\nHumans and the Dao cannot both be clear,\nHumans who love fame cannot use the Dao,\nThe Dao surpassing humans, fame ceases—\nFame flourishes with humans, yet perishes with them.\n\nThe Dao must be unified,\nAffairs cannot be fully dual.\nLaozi says:\nTo make the faithful divide wealth,\nNot knowing their fixed share yet probing the tally—\nWhy so?\nThe scheming mind of the faithful,\nIs not as good as the mindless.\nTo make the virtuous guard wealth,\nIs not as good as sealing the doors and keeping it whole—\nFor the desiring mind of the virtuous,\nIs not as good as the desireless.\nProbing the tally ends doubt with the mindless,\nThe virtuous see suspicion in the desiring.\nHumans highlight their flaws, then harbor resentment,\nYet mirrors reveal their ugliness and they take pride in it.\nThe wise point out faults to prompt change,\nThe foolish adorn themselves and claim virtue.\nHumans can receive things without appropriating them,\nThus free from burdens.\nPrioritize others, then yourself—\nA lifetime without fault.\n\nLaozi says:\nAll who deal with others,\nEither use treasures to corrupt,\nOr humble words to ensnare—\nCorruption is single, yet desires are insatiable.\nThe noble do not hoard treasures,\nBut use gifts and attire with humility and respect—\nIf others can act in accordance with one principle,\nLong-term, they will not grow weary.\nHumble bearing avoids reproach,\nPersuasion without binding oaths—\nYet alliances and pacts,\nMade with fixed terms yet broken before their time,\nAre the way of the petty.\nThe noble’s exchange,\nRequires no oaths or agreements—\nA single word suffices,\nA lifetime unaltered.\n\nThus, the noble do not externally adorn *virtue/power* and righteousness,\nNor internally cultivate false Daoist arts—\nInternally, they hold true sincerity,\nExternally, they display no hollow pretense.\nThey govern affairs within their domain,\nExpand their territory’s breadth,\nStrengthen their people’s loyalty unto death,\nFortify their cities and walls—\nHearts united above and below,\nThey defend the state together.\nThus, those who seek fame do not boast of meritless deeds,\nThose who seek profit do not attack what is hard to obtain—\nThis is the Way that must be preserved whole,\nThe principle that must be advantageous.\nSharing profit with the people,\nThey gladly die for them.\nUniting hearts with the people,\nThey guard the state together.\nSeekers of fame do not greedily overreach,\nSeekers of profit do not arbitrarily divide—\nThis is the Way that must be preserved whole,\nThus the state is jointly defended,\nAnd borders are firmly secured.\n\nLaozi says:\nThe Sage does not conquer their own mind,\nThe common people do not conquer their own desires.\nThe mind conquers, the Way is whole,\nDesires conquer, the body is in peril.\nThe noble act with upright *qi*,\nThe petty act with corrupt *qi*—\nInternally, it suits their nature,\nExternally, it aligns with righteousness—\nThey move according to principle,\nAnd do not clash with things—\nThis is the harmony of one *qi*.\nIndulging in flavors,\nExcess in sounds and colors,\nOutbursts of joy and anger,\nWithout regard for future consequences—\nThis is corrupt *qi*.\nCorrupt and upright injure each other,\nDesires and nature harm each other—\nThey cannot coexist,\nOne arises, the other declines—\nThus, the Sage diminishes desires and follows nature.\n\nThe eyes love colors,\nThe ears love sounds,\nThe nose loves fragrances,\nThe mouth loves flavors—\nAlluring them together,\nThey never stray from desires for profit and harm.\nEyes, ears, nose, and mouth,\nIgnoring what they truly desire,\nAll are controlled by the mind—\nEach finds its place—\nFrom this, it is clear that desires cannot be conquered.\n\nThe six senses’ desires,\nAre all governed by one mind.\n*Qi* upright within,\nThen desires do not harm nature.\nThe mind weakened externally,\nThen falsehood deceives the true self.\n\nThus, one knows that weakening and uprightness lie within,\nAnd gain or loss depend on the mind.\n\n「Yet when the heart itself remains upright,\nWhy should the myriad things weigh upon it?\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"Those who govern the body and nurture their nature*\n*restrict their sleep and dwellings,*\n*moderate their food and drink,*\n*harmonize their joys and angers,*\n*adapt to movement and stillness,*\n*find fulfillment within themselves,*\n*and speak without external seeking.*\n*Thus, perverse qi finds no entry,*\n*but adornment of the exterior harms the interior,*\n*and bolstering one’s emotions damages one’s spirit.*\n*Those who see its form are blinded to its truth.*\n\n*He who forgets his virtue for even a moment,*\n*will surely constrain his nature.*\n*Laozi says: \"A virtuous person cannot forget his virtue,*\n*for even a moment’s departure*\n*will bring suffering and humiliation.\"*\n\n*He who forgets his beauty within a hundred paces,*\n*will surely burden his form.*\n\n*\"To support the body and command the nature,*\n*one must properly moderate consumption*\n*and preserve harmony,*\n*so that inner qi may remain balanced*\n*and the spirit may be preserved.*\n\n*The gentleman guards the subtle—*\n*not in distant things,*\n*but even within ten steps,*\n*he considers the peril of decaying logs;*\n*in the blink of an eye,*\n*an unintended misstep may occur.*\n*How can one afford such negligence?*\n\n*Thus, those whose feathers and wings are splendid*\n*risk harm to their bones and flesh,*\n*and those whose branches and leaves flourish*\n*endanger their roots and stems.*\n*None in the world can possess both beauties.*\n\n*The jade phoenix is harmed by its very colors,*\n*and the spring blossom is broken by its very fragrance.*\n*Things may have dual beauties,*\n*but affairs cannot be fully reconciled—*\n*such is not found.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"Heaven has brightness,*\n*yet does not worry over the people’s darkness,*\n*Earth has wealth,*\n*yet does not worry over the people’s poverty.*\n*The Dao of Heaven,*\n*illuminates the vast and the obscure,*\n*penetrating even the deepest depths.*\n*The Earth’s abundance,*\n*permeates all things,*\n*extending boundless aid to all.\"*\n\n*One who embodies the utmost virtue and the Dao*\n*stands firm as a mountain,*\n*unmoved—*\n*the acting take him as their model,*\n*he remains true to himself,*\n*sufficient unto all things,*\n*yet does not accept gifts from others,*\n*nor do those who use him claim his virtue,*\n*thus he remains stable and enduring,*\n*Heaven and Earth cannot surpass him,*\n*thus he suffers no loss,*\n*no virtue is claimed,*\n*thus no resentment arises.*\n\n*The supreme person*\n*is unaffected by external influence,*\n*cannot be toppled by desires and harm,*\n*stands alone like a mountain,*\n*unshaken—*\n*with his constant sufficiency,*\n*he does not accept gifts or favors,*\n*and when he takes what is his,*\n*he does not apologize.*\n\n*Thus, if one gives to him, it cannot be retained,*\n*and if one takes from him, there is no grievance,*\n*so he is able to endure forever.*\n\n*Those skilled in anger invite many resentments,*\n*those skilled in giving invite taking.*\n*Only by following Heaven and Earth’s natural spontaneity*\n*can one master the principles of life.*\n\n*Beyond the realm of joy and anger,*\n*forgetting the emotions of giving and taking,*\n*letting things unfold naturally,*\n*one preserves the fullness of Heaven’s Dao.*\n\n*Thus, praise appears, and blame follows,*\n*kindness appears, and cruelty follows,*\n*benefit becomes harm,*\n*and fortune becomes disaster—*\n*if one does not seek benefit,*\n*then there is no harm,*\n*if one does not seek fortune,*\n*then there is no disaster.*\n*Preserve the body whole as one’s constant,*\n*for wealth and honor are but transient lodgings.*\n\n*Praise is what others admire and covet.*\n*Yet if one does not wish to display it,*\n*display invites both blame and resentment.*\n*It is not that one must utterly abandon virtue,*\n*but rather that without arrogance or self-aggrandizement,*\n*one naturally avoids both misfortune and fortune,*\n*and virtue and the Dao remain intact.*\n*Preserve the body whole as one’s constant,*\n*for wealth and honor are but transient lodgings.*\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"The Sage wears no strange or ostentatious garments,*\n*nor performs eccentric or bizarre actions.*\n*His attire is simple, his conduct unadorned,*\n*his garments do not startle the masses,*\n*his actions do not deviate from the common way.*\n*He is open yet not showy,*\n*humble yet not intimidated,*\n*honored yet not ostentatious,*\n*obscure yet not confined,*\n*unique yet not contrary.*\n*Open and humble are his fate,*\n*thus he is neither showy nor intimidated.*\n*Honored and obscure are the times,*\n*thus he is neither flaunted nor humiliated.*\n*Though he differs from others,*\n*what is there to find strange in that?*\n*His use is universal,*\n*yet cannot be named—*\n*this is called the Great Harmony.*\n\n*When there is no use,*\n*there is no obstruction—*\n*this is the Great Harmony.*\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"The Dao is to be true to oneself*\n*and await one’s fate.*\n*When time arrives,*\n*one cannot force it forward,*\n*when time departs,*\n*one cannot chase it backward.*\n*Thus the Sage does not advance to seek,*\n*nor retreat to yield.*\n\n*Upright in body, awaiting fate,*\n*following the Dao in truth,*\n*not leading nor following—*\n*within three years, time arrives,*\n*and I go with it;*\n*within three years, time departs,*\n*and I remain behind.*\n*No going, no coming,*\n*balanced in its place.*\n\n*This speaks of the excess of hastening forward*\n*and the deficiency of lagging behind—*\n*only by meeting time can one have no past,*\n*and by following it can one have no future,*\n*standing independent within,*\n*and finding peace in one’s place.*\n\n*The Dao of Heaven favors none,*\n*it bestows only upon virtue.*\n*When fortune comes,*\n*it is not what one sought,*\n*so one does not claim its merit.*\n*When disaster arrives,*\n*it is not what one created,*\n*so one does not regret one’s actions.*\n*This has already been explained.*\n\n*Let the heart be serene,*\n*and do not burden one’s virtue,*\n*for then neither praise nor blame can soil it,*\n*nor can honor or humiliation disturb it.*\n*Dogs bark, yet it does not startle—*\n*self-trusting in one’s nature,*\n*truly without transgression.*\n*Self-illuminating, without fault,*\n*thus no fear nor dread.*\n\n*Thus, those who understand the Dao are not confused,*\n*and those who know fate are not anxious.*\n*To know the Dao and know fate,*\n*what anxiety or fear remains?*\n\n*When the sovereign dies,*\n*his remains are buried in the wild,*\n*yet his spirit is enshrined in the Hall of Light—*\n*the spirit is nobler than the form.*\n*It is said that ancient sovereigns*\n*returned their remains to the wild,*\n*neither sealed nor planted,*\n*to show the people that all must end;*\n*enshrining the spirit in the Hall of Light,*\n*without flattery nor excess,*\n*to show the people that reverence must be known.*\n\n*Thus, when the spirit governs the form,*\n*it prospers,*\n*but when the form overpowers the spirit,*\n*it falters.*\n*Though wisdom and insight are employed,*\n*they must ultimately return to the spirit—*\n*this is called the Great Harmony.*\n\n*Rely on the spirit to preserve the form,*\n*indulge desire and the spirit will fade,*\n*yet none but the enlightened*\n*can guard it thus.*\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"The ancients who preserved themselves*\n*rejoiced in virtue and forgot disgrace,*\n*thus their names did not sway their resolve,*\n*rejoiced in the Dao and forgot poverty,*\n*thus benefit did not sway their hearts.*\n*Hence they could be humble and yet joyful,*\n*quiet and yet unperturbed.*\n\n*Virtue and the Dao complete the body,*\n*poverty and disgrace bring no shame,*\n*the heart and resolve remain unbroken,*\n*names and benefits cause no confusion.*\n*Thus they could find joy in humility,*\n*and remain tranquil in stillness.*\n\n*With few concerns, they gathered their years,*\n*yet they worried over the world’s disorder,*\n*as one might worry over the drying of the Yellow River,*\n*weeping to increase its flow.*\n*Thus, they did not worry over the world’s disorder,*\n*but rejoiced in the harmony of their own lives—*\n*such can speak of the Dao.*\n\n*It is folly to teach others*\n*not to fear the end of their years,*\n*yet to fear the world’s disorder,*\n*as if one could add but a few drops of tears*\n*to swell the vast river’s current—*\n*useless indeed.»\n\n「Only those who forget the governance of others and focus on governing themselves can truly speak of the Dao.\n\nLaozi said: *\"People have three grievances: those with high rank are envied by others, those with great office are despised by their lord, and those with abundant wealth are resented by the people.\"* Yet, if one can be humble despite high rank, generous despite great wealth, they preserve their innate good fortune. For when rank grows ever higher, their intentions become ever lower; when office expands ever greater, their heart grows ever smaller; when wealth thickens ever more, their giving becomes ever broader. Cultivating these three virtues, resentment will not arise.\n\nThus, nobility finds its foundation in humility, and height finds its base in lowliness. If these two are not cultivated, calamity will fall upon oneself.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Speech is the means by which one conveys themselves to others, and hearing is the means by which others convey themselves to one.\"* Expressing one’s own sentiments to reach others’ hearts, and grasping others’ intentions to align with one’s own. If one is both deaf and blind, the Dao cannot pass through them. Therefore, those afflicted with deafness and blindness—whether of body or of mind—cannot know the way of harmony. The eyes that fail to see the great mountains, the ears that do not hear the thunderous peals, are the deafness and blindness of the flesh. But those who mistake a mirror for a deer or a horse, whose wisdom is clouded by beans and grains, are the deafness and blindness of the mind. If one cannot discern even ordinary matters, how much less can they grasp the great Dao? Those who do not know what to convey are of the kind afflicted with deafness and blindness.\n\nThe Dao is the ultimate principle: all things with form arise from it, yet it remains their closest kin—nourished by the Dao, they take form. Those who eat of the grains and breathe the *qi* live long, yet the Dao is their true sovereign—granting life without form. All who learn wisdom draw from it, yet the Dao is their ultimate teacher—bestowing knowledge without instruction. The Dao is their parent, their lord, and their master.\n\nPeople generally harm what is useful by clinging to what is useless. They labor at vain pursuits, injuring the emotions that have bounds. Thus, knowledge that is not broadened leaves one perpetually wanting. The noble one often reflects that their understanding is yet insufficient, and they strive daily to better themselves. If one spends their days on games of chance yet seeks the Dao, their insights will be profound. But if one shifts the labor of games of chance to focus solely on *virtue* and the Dao, they may attain even greater depths.\n\nAsking and not asking differ as much as deafness and blindness separate one from others. Those who neither hear nor ask are truly the deaf and blind of the world.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Human nature must submit to virtue, not to force. One can be governed by virtue, not by coercion.\"* Virtue comes or does not come from without. Virtue given to others does not await their return. Therefore, the sage who wishes to be honored by others first honors others; who wishes to be revered by others first reveres others; who wishes to overcome others first overcomes themselves. The lowly one who humbles others first humbles themselves. Thus, nobility and humility, reverence and lowliness—all are governed by the Dao.\n\nThe ancient sage-kings spoke to others in humility, yet they led by example. Even if all under heaven joyfully followed them without tiring, and revered them without wearying, it was because their virtue was abundant and their *qi* aligned with the Dao. Hence, they knew that giving is taking, and following is leading—thus approaching the Dao itself.\n\nTo honor others is not to honor their persons, but to take honor; to lead others is not to lead their persons, but to take precedence. This is the *qi* aligning with the Dao, and virtue returning to oneself. Thus, they are followed without weariness, and revered without burden.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Those with little virtue yet much favor are scorned; those with inferior talent yet high position are in peril; those with no great deeds yet abundant wealth are despised.\"* Thus, things may sometimes bring gain yet cause loss, or loss yet bring gain. Talent hidden without proper display invites scorn and danger, and such must inevitably follow loss and gain in turn—this is the verification of fate.\n\nThe common folk all know what is profitable as profit, yet they do not know that what is harmful can be profit, and what is profitable can be harm. The common folk know profit as profit, yet they do not know that profit can be harm. The sage knows that profit is harm, and that what is not harm is true profit.\n\nThus, the twice-cut tree will surely wound its roots, and the hoarding family will surely face ruin. Great profit often turns to harm—that is the Way of Heaven. The tree that is felled twice will be wounded at its roots, and the family that buries treasure will face calamity upon itself. These are things gained not by intention—first profit, then harm—that is the Way of Heaven.\n\nLaozi said: *\"The petty man acts daily for mere gain, the noble man acts daily for righteousness.\"* Those who do good are not seeking fame, yet fame follows them; fame does not align with profit, yet profit returns to them. Their aims are the same, but their ends differ. The petty man acts for gain, and profit brings them harm. The noble one follows the Dao, not seeking profit, yet fame comes to them. Thus, they receive the same profit yet face different harms.\n\nTherefore, beneficial action is inevitably followed by loss. Speech that lacks constancy brings no lasting truth, and those who gain without constancy are petty men. They do not uphold their virtue steadfastly, and may later suffer shame for it. To excel in one matter and master one skill is mediocrity. Their vision is not comprehensive, and they are confined to one domain. To cover all and possess all, to employ all abilities and talents—that is the sage. Silent of deceit, free of sorrow, they entrust virtue to the worthy and employ ability to the capable.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Life is borrowed, death is returned. Thus, in times of order, one protects righteousness with their life; in times of chaos, one protects their life with righteousness. On the day of death, the way is fulfilled. In times of order, one safeguards their life with righteousness; in times of chaos, one sacrifices their life for righteousness.\"* Therefore, the noble one benefits others, and even death does not bring regret.\n\nThus, they regard death as returning home—no different from the years of life. Therefore, the noble one is cautious only in their singular use of this life.\n\nTo act in accordance with the Dao is to move without deviating from the right path. Hence, life is received from Heaven, and fate is met with time. One may have talent yet not encounter the age, which is Heaven’s doing. To seek it has a method, and to attain it lies in fate. To meet the time is fortune; to not meet Heaven is misfortune. When they gain, they do not rejoice; when they lose, they do not resent.\n\n「The noble one may act in virtue without necessarily receiving blessings, nor avoid wickedness to escape misfortune. To do good does not always bring fortune, nor does abstaining from evil always prevent calamity—yet they never abandon righteousness to seek blessings. Why? Because their nature cannot be reckless, and their heart remains undivided.\n\nThus, the noble one advances when the time is right, attaining blessings through virtue—what greater fortune could there be? When the time is not ripe, they retreat, yielding with propriety—what greater misfortune could there be? Therefore, though they dwell in poverty and low estate, they still regret nothing, for they hold what is truly precious.\n\nTo advance is not to rejoice in fortune, for virtue is their gain. To fail is not to feel shame, for what cause is there to repent? Their devotion lies in the Dao and righteousness—how could they suffer from mere poverty?\n\nLaozi said: *\"One has the qi of compliance and resistance, which arises from the heart. When the heart is orderly, the qi flows in compliance; when the heart is disordered, the qi resists. The heart’s order or chaos lies in virtue/power (德). To gain the Dao is to order the heart; to lose the Dao is to disorder the heart. An ordered heart brings mutual yielding; a disordered heart brings mutual contention. Yielding is virtue/power; contention breeds thievery. Virtue/power brings compliant qi; thievery spawns resistant qi. To unify the heart is to comply and remain upright; to split the qi is to resist and become perverse. Uprightness elevates the Dao; perversity invites harm.\n\nWhen the Dao endures, the spirit is clear, and clarity brings harmony. When thievery arises, the qi becomes turbid, and turbidity brings contention and chaos. Once turbid and chaotic, destruction comes without delay.\n\nCompliant qi leads one to self-sacrifice for others; resistant qi leads one to harm others for self. The two qi can be governed by the Dao. What cannot be resolved by deeds can be regulated by the Dao. Heaven’s Dao is like the echo that answers sound—virtue accumulated brings blessings, and misdeeds accumulated bring resentment. If humans act in accordance, Heaven can discern it; good and evil intentions are revealed as clearly as reflections in water.\n\nCorruption arises from flourishing corruption; filial piety wanes when children and wives are neglected. Troubles stem from easing worries too soon; illness worsens when desires are unchecked. Thus, one must be as cautious at the end as at the beginning, lest affairs fail.\n\nCorruption fails due to deviation from proper law; filial piety declines when hidden in private matters. Though worries may temporarily ease, one must still fear their recurrence; though illness may briefly abate, restraint of desires remains essential. Therefore, to be as cautious at the end as at the beginning ensures no failure in affairs.\n\nLaozi said: *\"To lift the crooked and make it straight—how could one not gain? To lift the straight and make it crooked, do not comply, lest you share their filth yet differ in your mud.\"* To know others is difficult; to judge them must be clear. Now, if one lifts the crooked as if it were straight and takes the foolish for the wise, how could they share filth while differing in mud?\n\nLaozi said: *\"The sage and the fool share death and life. The sage’s sharing of death and life lies in their understanding of distinctions; the fool’s lies in their ignorance of gain and harm. The sage unifies death and life, neither favoring nor harming either, so they transcend death and life. The fool separates death and life, fixated on gain and loss, thus falling into death and life.\n\nThe Dao originates from Heaven, things are produced by Earth, and harmony resides in humans. Heaven’s qi does not descend, Earth’s qi does not ascend, yin and yang are unbalanced, winds and rains come untimely, and the people suffer from sickness and famine when the ruler is not harmonious.\n\nThe Dao is rooted in Heaven, things are born from Earth, and harmony lies in humans. Humans are Heaven’s essence and Earth’s spirit. Therefore, to rule as a sovereign, one must harmonize the qi, settle all things, and then winds and rains will not err, and calamities will not arise.\n\nLaozi said: *\"To command a hundred thousand soldiers is not as valuable as to hear a single fitting word; to possess the Lord of Hui’s pearl is not as precious as to know the reason for its acquisition; to hold the Heirloom Jade is not as prized as to know the proper use of it. A single beneficial word outweighs a hundred thousand soldiers; a single fitting action surpasses the Heirloom Jade and Lord of Hui’s pearl. Though the world be vast, those who delight in warfare perish; though a nation be secure, those who forget war are in danger. Therefore, small states with few people, though they possess myriad implements, do not use them. Great states do no better than to cultivate virtue/power; small states do no better than to serve their people—then conquest and warfare do not arise, and all ranks dwell in peace.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Those who can become hegemons or kings must be victors; yet they do not oppose without the Dao. Those who can defeat enemies must possess virtue/power; yet without virtue/power, they cannot prevail. Those who can use others’ strength must win their hearts—employing the wise to gain the people’s loyalty. Those who win others’ hearts must also attain self-mastery; self-mastery comes from yielding to those stronger than oneself, yet overcoming those equal or weaker. The victory of yielding surpasses the strength of those equal or weaker—this cannot be measured by ordinary means. Thus, only the sage can use the many’s inability to achieve great victory by preserving humility and yielding.\n\nOnly by preserving humility and yielding can one overcome what the many cannot. Thus, they achieve their great victory.\n\n*End of Volume Four*\n*End of Volume Five of the *Tongxuan Zhenjing* [通玄真经]*」\n\n「The *Master of Literature* from the Song dynasty, **Zhu Bian**, who held the posts of **Chief Clerk of the Grand Court of Justice** and **Magistrate of Jinyun County, Kuizhou**, now annotates the *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power* chapter.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is the inherent principle that pervades all things; **virtue/power** is the comprehensive name for all that is acquired. Moreover, the *Wenzzi* [《文子》] has a total of twelve distinct chapters, yet only the *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power* is repeated—why is this so?\n\nThe **Dao/Way of virtue/power** is the same as the **Dao/Way that can be applied to things**; the virtue/power that arises from what can be spoken of is also the virtue/power that can be relied upon. But this is not the **Ultimate Dao/Way** or the **Mystic Virtue/Power**. Therefore, the first chapter is titled *Dao/Way’s Origin* [《道原》], and the latter *Supreme Virtue/Power* [《上德》]. The former refers to the **root of the Dao/Way**, while the latter denotes the **peak of virtue/power**—this chapter serves as the bridge between the two.\n\nThe essence of **Dao/Way and virtue/power** lies in returning to their natural origins. In the human world, to practice the **Dao/Way**, establish virtue/power, cultivate one’s self, and refine one’s reputation—while living with purpose and dying without decay—there is none like this chapter.\n\nThe *Wenzzi* inquires about the **Dao/Way**. The **Dao/Way** transcends learning; the ultimate principle cannot be questioned. What is queried here is the **Dao/Way of analogical reasoning**.\n\nLaozi said: *\"If one does not master learning and inquiry, one cannot deeply grasp the Dao/Way.\"* Those who study seek to restore their innate nature. By indulging in inquiry, one becomes receptive to answers; by cultivating learning, one reaches the state of *wu xue* [无学, \"beyond learning\"]. If one does not master this, how can they fathom the profound essence?\n\nFor those who listen, the aim is to attain **enlightened wisdom**—the wisdom of the **sage-philosopher**. To cultivate **conduct**—the practice of **benevolence and righteousness**. To achieve **merit and reputation**—the merit of a **worthy minister**. If one does not refine their learning, they will not understand; if they do not delve deeply, they will not grasp. Refined learning leads to clarity; deep inquiry leads to comprehension. Thus, the **superior scholar** listens with **spirit**, the **middle scholar** with **mind**, and the **inferior scholar** with **ear**.\n\nThe **superior scholar** comprehends the **Dao/Way** to attain **enlightened wisdom**; the **middle scholar** appreciates the **Dao/Way** to cultivate **conduct**; the **inferior scholar** wanders in the **Dao/Way** to gain **reputation**. Listening with the **ear** means learning is superficial; listening with the **mind** means learning penetrates to the muscles; listening with the **spirit** means learning reaches the marrow. Shallow and deep are relative.\n\nThus, if one does not listen deeply, their understanding will not be clear; if their understanding is unclear, they cannot exhaust its precision; if they cannot exhaust its precision, their actions will not be sincere. If one does not listen deeply, they lack present clarity—this is the unexcelled state.\n\nHe who does not comprehend within yet acts sincerely without has never been heard of. The principle of listening is to maintain a **vacant and tranquil mind**, diminish one’s **qi** without excess, meaning to **subdue one’s passions to align with the Dao/Way**. To have **no thought, no deliberation**, to **avoid random sight**, and to **avoid indiscriminate hearing**—to restrain both inner and outer faculties and uphold its intent.\n\nTo focus and accumulate with precision, to merge one’s inner intentions fully—once obtained, one must **steadfastly preserve** it and **sustain it enduringly**. To concentrate on what is gained, to have **no divided or wandering thoughts**, then the **nature of clarity** will naturally encompass all principles, exhausting their subtleties. Things cannot alter it; it will always be in harmony with the times.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is the **origin of all things**, giving rise to what has **beginning** and **form**. It begins with **softness and weakness**, yet culminates in **firmness and strength**. It begins as the **Mother of the Dao/Way**, all **qi** being soft and weak; it manifests in **substance and quality**, where nature becomes firm and strong. It begins with **fewness and brevity**, yet becomes **abundance and length**.\n\nThus, **eternal generation** is not few, making it **abundant**; **sustaining life** is not brief, making it **enduring**. A hundred-foot tree begins as a sapling; a thousand-step terrace starts with its foundation. This is the **Dao/Way of Heaven**.\n\nThe **sage** follows it. The **Dao/Way** encompasses the small to make it great; Heaven pairs the lowly to make them high. Observing its **beginning** and its **completion**, one can **revere the subtle origin**. Therefore, the **sage** follows it.\n\nThe **humble** lowers themselves to **gain elevation**; they **honor the lowly** to **attain reverence**. The **retiring** step back to **lead ahead**; they **avoid conflict** to **secure precedence**. The **frugal** embrace **smallness** to **achieve breadth**; their **modest use** leads to **abundance**. The **self-restrained** desire **less** to **attain greatness**; their **cultivation of virtue/power** makes them **vast**.\n\nThis is the **Dao/Way of Heaven** fulfilled. The **Dao/Way of Heaven** diminishes excess and benefits humility; the **sage** conforms to it, naturally achieving **universal benefit**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is the **precedent of virtue/power**; from the **substance of the Dao/Way**, virtue/power is realized. It is the **root of greatness**, the **origin of the Two Polarities** [《两仪》]. It is the **gateway to fortune**, the **means of tranquility**. All things await it to **generate**, await it to **complete**, await it to **rest**.\n\nThey all rely on **nothingness** for this. The **Dao/Way** is **non-action** and **formless**; it does not precede things or leave traces in phenomena. Internally, it cultivates the self; externally, it governs others. When **achievement and conduct** are established, it becomes **neighboring with Heaven**.\n\nHe who practices the **Dao/Way** can **act without doing** yet **accomplish all things**—this meaning has already appeared in the *Dao/Way’s Origin* chapter. Few know its precision; its precision is most true, and within it lies **faith**. It responds to **sensations** and arrives naturally—is this not **faith**?\n\nWhen the **Son of Heaven** [天子] possesses the **Dao/Way**, the **world submits**, and his **reign endures**. The **Dao/Way** is to **adapt to one’s station** and **harmonize accordingly**. Thus, **Emperor Yao** and **Emperor Shun** [尧舜] had it, and their **supreme virtue/power** could be praised. **King Tang** and **King Wu** [汤武] had it, and their **divine achievements** were immortal.\n\nThis is the **Dao/Way that can be spoken of**—is it not so? When the **feudal lords** [诸侯] possess the **Dao/Way**, their **people live in harmony**, and they **do not lose their states**. In ancient times, the **feudal lords** had their **states**.\n\nWhen the **scholar-officials and commoners** [士庶] possess the **Dao/Way**, they **preserve their lives** and **protect their kin**. The **strong and mighty** with the **Dao/Way** **conquer without war**; the **type of Jin and Chu** [晋楚], who possessed the **Dao/Way**, became **hegemons**—not through **outmaneuvering enemies** to **achieve victory**.\n\nThe **weak and small** with the **Dao/Way** **gain without contention**; the **type of Cao and Wei** [曹卫], who possessed the **Dao/Way**, found **allies**—not through **taking the lead** to **secure their position**.\n\nWhen undertaking **actions** with the **Dao/Way**, **achievement is realized**, and **fortune is attained**. Those who **conform to the times** will see their **achievements**; those who **cultivate what is upright** will receive their **fortune**.\n\nBetween **ruler and minister**, the **Dao/Way** manifests as **loyalty and benevolence**—」\n\nThe ruler shows benevolence, the minister displays loyalty. Between father and son, the **Dao/Way** manifests as **filial piety and parental kindness**—the father is kind, the son is filial.\n\nFor the common folk, the **Dao/Way** means mutual love, without transgressing proper order, and harmony arises naturally. Thus, the **Dao/Way** brings harmony; its absence brings harshness.\n\nWhen each upholds their **nature and vital essence (xìngmìng)**, even differing customs can be harmonized. If one oversteps their proper station, even kin will turn cruel. How then can families or states without the **Dao/Way** avoid ruin?\n\nFrom this, it is clear that the **Dao/Way** is universally applicable—whether in small or great matters, it is always fitting.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** brings small virtue and small blessings to those who practice it slightly, great virtue and great blessings to those who practice it greatly, and universal submission when practiced fully. Submission leads to affection. Adapt to circumstances and draw from it without exhaustion.\n\nThose who fully embody the **Dao/Way** will have all under Heaven willingly submit to them. Thus, the **Son of Heaven (Emperor)** is what all under Heaven naturally turn toward, while the **King** is what all under Heaven willingly follow. Though \"turn toward\" and \"follow\" may seem similar, they differ in essence—one is the natural alignment of **nature and vital essence**, the other is compelled necessity. Examining their principles, their superiority or inferiority becomes clear.\n\nWithout natural alignment or willing submission, one cannot be called an **Emperor** or **King**. To hold a position without virtue is unfit.\n\nThus, **Emperors and Kings** cannot succeed without the people, nor can they endure if they lose the **Dao/Way**. Having relied on the masses to establish their rule, they must then depend solely on themselves—how can this be sustained?\n\nThose who abandon the **Dao/Way** indulge in extravagance, arrogance, and insolence. They flaunt their excesses, cling to rigid strength, provoke enmity, and lead armies. They take the blame while others reap the credit—this is the state of one who has strayed from the **Dao/Way**.\n\nWhen the common folk act thus, they bring ruin upon themselves—even to execution. When the great act thus, their families and states perish, and nobles lose their domains, while ministers lose their households. The harm may begin with themselves but extends to their descendants.\n\nThus, no crime is greater than abandoning the **Dao/Way**, and no resentment is deeper than lacking virtue—this is the **Way of Heaven**.\n\nThose without the **Dao/Way** defy Heaven; those without virtue oppress all things. Logic dictates that crime and resentment stem from this.\n\n**Laozi** said: *\"The practitioner of the **Dao/Way** makes even the boldest hesitate to strike, and the most skilled fail to hit their mark. They can restrain hostile **qi**, skillfully respond to circumstances, and master the subtle arts of the **Dao/Way**.\"*\n\nEven if one does not strike or hit, if they still suffer humiliation—though unharmed, they are attacked with insults—this is already evident. It is better to make even the boldest dare not strike, the most skilled dare not hit. Through humility and gentleness in self-preservation, boldness cannot overstep. Without provoking conflict, even the cunning cannot prevail.\n\nIf they do not dare, it is not that they lack intent, but that they cannot make others lack intent. It is better to make others naturally lack such intent.\n\nIf one abandons eccentric displays and strange conduct, embracing boundless naturalness and blending with others like waves, then who under Heaven would harbor ill intentions toward them?\n\nIf others lack such intent, it is because they have no desire for gain or harm. It is not that one can make others’ hearts turn toward themselves, but rather that all under Heaven—men and women alike—willingly embrace them with affection and benefit.\n\nThe ultimate function of the **Dao/Way** is to make all under Heaven willingly submit, and all things find their benefit. Thus, even if external threats are repelled, this is still insufficient.\n\nTrue mastery lies in blending with the masses, mingling with the common folk, making oneself the source of their love and benefit, and standing in the realm of **nature and vital essence**—without personal ambition, yet naturally transforming into the wondrous. This is the pinnacle of the **Dao/Way**.\n\nSuch a one needs no title to rule, no office to lead—all under Heaven, from insects upward, naturally seek what benefits them. Thus, without position or authority, they can govern all under Heaven.\n\nBoldness in daring leads to killing; boldness in restraint leads to life. Boldness in striking and piercing kills in the heart; boldness in gentleness and weakness preserves all things through the **Dao/Way**.\n\n**Wénzǐ** asked about **virtue (dé)**, and **Laozi** replied: *\"Nurture and nourish, guide and grow—comprehensively benefiting without partiality, aligning with Heaven and Earth. This is called **virtue**.\"*\n\nHuman life inherently interacts with things externally and engages with affairs internally—harmony with the outside world is unavoidable. Only by internally abandoning love and hatred, and externally transcending gain and loss, can one govern all things without suppression, and transform the myriad realms without obstruction. Without this **Dao/Way**, comprehensive benefit is unattainable.\n\nTo act violently is to lose the inherent harmony of **virtue**—how can one align with **virtue** in a single act?\n\nWhat is **rén (仁, benevolence)**?\n*\"For the ruler, not to boast of achievements; for the subjects, not to shame their flaws—this is not yet complete. Toward the great, not boastful; toward the small, not stingy. Universally loving without partiality, enduring without decay—this is **rén**.\"*\n\nOnly the most refined **nature** can sustain this without decay. Thus, the wise and sagely find it difficult to rank as the foremost of the Five Teachings.\n\nWhat is **yì (义, righteousness)**?\n*\"For the ruler, to assist the weak; for the subjects, to uphold principle. In prosperity, not to overstep; in adversity, not to abandon resolve. Aligning with the **Dao/Way** and principle, without private deviation or perversion—this is **yì**.\"*\n\n**Principle** is correctness. **Unity** is constancy. To make correctness and constancy the standard, without allowing private deviation, is the only way to endure.\n\nWhat is **lǐ (礼, ritual/propriety)**?\n*\"For the ruler, to be reverent and dignified; for the subjects, to be humble and respectful. Retreating, yielding, and maintaining gentleness—being the feminine complement to Heaven under Heaven. Standing firm in what one does not dare, establishing what one cannot—this is **lǐ**.\"*\n\nThis is not merely bowing and ascending in rank. It is inner harmony and outer decorum.\n\nThus, cultivating **virtue** makes the subjects obey; cultivating **rén** makes the subjects not contend; cultivating **yì** makes the subjects fair; cultivating **lǐ** makes the subjects respectful. When all four are cultivated, the state is stable.\n\n**Life** is the **Dao/Way**; **growth** is **virtue**; **love** is **rén**; **correctness** is **yì**; **respect** is **lǐ**.\n\n「If one does not nurture and provide, one cannot fulfill the growth of all.\nIf one lacks kindness and love, one cannot achieve completion.\nIf one does not uphold correctness and rectify, one cannot endure long.\nIf one does not show respect and honor, one cannot attain nobility and worth.\n\nThus, **virtue** is what the people hold dear—\nwhen **virtue** can secure them, none under Heaven do not cherish their safety.\n**Rén** is what the people cherish—\nall things and emotions naturally gravitate toward its benevolent love.\n**Correctness (Yì)** is what the people fear—\nwhen there is no private gain, none do not fear what is upright.\n**Ritual/Propriety (Lǐ)** is what the people revere—\nwhen dignity and order are observed, none do not respect and honor it.\n\nThese four are the harmonious principles of civilization,\nthe means by which the **Sage** governs all things.\nIf one does not align with the proper order of civilization,\nthen myriad emotions arise chaotically,\nand governance becomes impossible.\n\nA **gentleman** without **virtue** invites resentment from his subjects—\nfor suppressing their nature, resentment arises.\nWithout **rén**, contention arises among the subjects—\nfor lacking benevolent care, they contend.\nWithout **correctness**, brutality arises among the subjects—\nfor overstepping their proper boundaries, they become violent.\nWithout **ritual/propriety**, disorder arises among the subjects—\nfor losing the proper sequence of conduct, they rebel.\n\nWhen these four principles are not established,\nit is called having no **Dao/Way**.\nNot perishing is rare indeed.\n\n**Laozi** said:\nIn the age of **ultimate virtue (至德)**, merchants find profit in trade,\nfarmers take joy in the fields,\ngreat officials fulfill their duties with ease,\nscholars cultivate their **Dao/Way**,\nand common people delight in their occupations.\n\nThus, winds and rains do not destroy or break,\nplants and trees do not wither and die—\n**virtue** extends to all things,\nso **Heaven (天)** and **Earth (地)** harmonize,\nand all living beings fulfill their natural growth.\n\nThe **Yellow River** gave rise to the *Tuguan* (河图),\nthe **Lu River** to the *Shushu* (洛书).\nBut as the age declined,\ntaxes and levies became excessive,\nslaughters and punishments knew no end,\nand those who offered counsel were killed—\nthe **Sage** and the worthy were slain.\nThus, mountains crumbled and rivers dried up,\ncreatures moved restlessly without cease,\nthe wilds lacked even a hundred stalks of grain.\nPoisonous vapors seeped into the people,\nand resentment festered below—\nwhen **qi** rebels against **Heaven** and defies the natural order,\ndisasters and famines emerge.\n\nThus, when the age is well-ordered, even the foolish cannot act alone in disorder,\nand when the age is chaotic, even the wise cannot govern alone.\nThe efficacy of the **Sage** and the worthy cannot override the **Dao/Way** of the times.\n\nTherefore, the **Sage** maintains harmony, pleasure, and tranquility—\nthis is **life**.\nThey never grow anxious or restless to the detriment of their natural **virtue/power**.\n\nWhen one’s **aspirations (志)** align with **Dao/Way** and action,\nthis is **fate (命)**.\nBecause they understand **fate**, they find peace in both adversity and prosperity.\nThus, **life** encounters **fate**, and only then can one act,\n**fate** meets with the right **time (时)**, and only then can one discern its meaning.\nWhen **fate** aligns with **Dao/Way** and proper action,\nand the **time** is favorable,\nthen success is achieved.\n\nThere must be the right age,\nbefore there can be the right person.\nIf the **time** lacks a **clear-minded ruler (明王)**,\nthen the **Sage** and the worthy have no place to stand.\n\nThus, the *Chapter on the Nine Guardians (九守篇)* states:\nWithout the right age, who could succeed?\n\n**Wénzǐ** asked about **Sage**ly wisdom,\nand **Laozi** replied:\nTo hear and know is **Sage**ly;\nto see and know is wise.\nThe **Sage** knows through the **heart (心)**,\nthe wise know through the **eyes (目)**.\n\nThus, the **Sage** always observes where misfortune and blessing originate,\nand chooses their **Dao/Way** accordingly—\nby selecting the **Dao/Way** of tranquility and guarding it,\nthey avoid becoming the cause of calamity.\n\nThe wise always perceive misfortune and blessing in their formed states,\nand choose their actions accordingly—\nby selecting the **Dao/Way** of uprightness and caution and cultivating it,\nthey can preemptively block the seeds of disorder.\n\nThe **Sage** understands the **Dao/Way** of **Heaven** and its auspicious and inauspicious signs,\nand thus knows where misfortune and blessing originate—\nthe **Sage** knows that **lack (不足)** brings auspiciousness,\nwhile **excess (有余)** brings inauspiciousness,\nfor these are the sources of misfortune and blessing.\n\nThus, to guard tranquility is not to act first—\nthe **Sage** does not initiate disturbance.\nThe wise perceive the signs of misfortune and blessing in advance,\nand thus know the gates through which they arise.\nThe wise are not confused by their initial growth,\nand so they avoid sudden and irreversible calamity.\n\nTo hear before it arises is **Sage**ly,\nto see before it forms is wise,\nand to have neither hearing nor seeing is foolish.\n\n**Laozi** said:\nIf a ruler loves knowledge,\nthey will trust the **time** and rely on themselves,\nabandoning **fixed principles (数)** in favor of thought alone.\nThis means trusting the age that confounds them,\nusing it as their own understanding;\ndiscarding the inevitable **fixed principles**,\nand employing only what thought can grasp.\n\nKnowledge is vast, yet wisdom is shallow—\nto govern the vast with shallow wisdom is impossible.\nRelying solely on one’s knowledge,\none will often fail in what is certain.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of things has many proper courses,\nbut wisdom has limits—\nthus, one cannot govern all,\nand many failures ensue.\nLoving knowledge is the **Dao/Way** of exhausting one’s arts,\nloving courage is the **Dao/Way** of peril and ruin.\nThe **Dao/Way** that exhausts one’s arts\nis the **Dao/Way** that leads to ruin.\n\nTo love giving is to have no fixed boundaries—\nbecause they love giving, they lack constancy.\nIf the ruler’s boundaries are not fixed,\nthen the subjects’ expectations know no end—\nwhen the ruler bestows gifts without measure,\nthe subjects hope endlessly in vain.\nIf taxes and levies are excessive,\nthen the ruler becomes the enemy of the people,\nand heavy burdens invert the **Dao/Way** of joy in distribution,\nthus resentment begins as enmity.\n\nTo take little and give much—\nthis is impossible in practice.\nA tax of one-tenth (十一而税)\nwould still fail to meet the unending demands of the state.\n\nThus, to love giving is the **Dao/Way** that invites resentment.\nTo distribute wealth unevenly among the people\ncauses resentment among the officials,\nand to impose heavy taxes on the people\ncauses resentment among the soldiers.\nFrom this, it is clear:\nWhen wealth is insufficient to fulfill its duties,\nthe **Dao/Way** and principles can be illuminated by reflection.\n\n**Wénzǐ** asked:\nHow did the ancient **rulers** govern the world with the **Dao/Way**?\n\n**Laozi** replied:\nHold to **Oneness (一)**, do nothing—\nfollow the transformations of **Heaven** and **Earth**.\n\nTo hold to **Oneness** means to hold to nothing.\nTo do nothing means to dare not act.\nIf one remains thus unassumingly,\nthen they follow the natural disposition of things and govern accordingly,\nand what could be more fitting than to align with **Heaven** and **Earth**,\nsharing in their transformations?\n\nThe world is a great instrument—\nit cannot be seized, nor can it be forced.\nTo seize is to lose it,\nto force is to ruin it.\nTo be able to manage one thing well,\none must fail in managing myriad things.\nTo hold to one disposition,\none must lose the myriad dispositions of all things.\n\nTo hold to **Oneness** is to see the small—\nnot to bear even the weight of a blade of grass,\nis this not humility and modesty?\nTo see the small is to achieve the great.\nAnd when one does not bear the weight of anything,\nyet relies on others to succeed,\nthen they achieve even greater governance.\nTo do nothing is to guard stillness—\nmeaning they do not initiate action.\nBy guarding stillness, they can set the world aright.\n\nThose who love action\ninjure the natural disposition of things.\nThus, to follow the great **Dao/Way** of the world,\nand move with the transformations of the **Way**,\nthen all things find their proper place,\nand their nature is naturally rectified.»\n\nTo dwell in fullness yet overflow not,\nto reside in nobility yet be free from arrogance.\nTo see the small and guard stillness,\nthus there is no arrogance or overflow.\n\nTo dwell in fullness without spilling,\nabundant yet never deficient;\nto reside above without arrogance,\nelevated yet never perilous.\nFor the **Dao/Way** is thus.\n\nAbundant yet never deficient,\nthis is how one endures lasting wealth;\nelevated yet never perilous,\nthis is how one endures lasting nobility.\n\nWealth and nobility do not depart from their person,\nblessings extend to descendants.\nThe ancient **Way** of kings,\naspired to this alone.\n\nOnly by attaining this **Way**,\ncan one establish the world.\n\n**Laozi** said:\n\"The people have the **Dao/Way** they follow in common,\nand laws they uphold in common,\nall revering the **Way** of righteousness,\nyet fearing the **Way** of statutes and punishments.\n\nRighteousness cannot secure them,\nnor can awe compel them,\nthus a ruler is established to unify them.\n\nThe people cannot forever uphold what is righteous,\nnor can they concentrate on what they fear,\nthus a ruler is established to standardize and unify them.\n\nA ruler who holds to **Oneness** is ordered,\nwho deviates from constancy is in chaos.\nChaos arises from governance without constancy.\n\nThe **Way** of the ruler is not to act,\nbut to act without acting.\n\nGovernance values stillness—\nwhy act before things?\nTo guide the people by their nature and transform them,\nthis too is not to act.\n\nThe wise do not use **virtue/power** for personal gain,\nbut those who use the **virtue/power** of governance\nas their own true capacity,\nthese are not the wisdom of a sovereign.\n\nThe brave do not use force for violence,\nbut those who wield coercive might\nas violent thunder,\nthese are not the courage of a ruler.\n\nThe benevolent do not use rank as favor,\nbut those who grant the **Way** of Heaven\nas personal benefit,\nthese are not the kindness of a king.\n\nThis may be called **Oneness**.\nTo embody these three is to hold to **Oneness**.\n\n**Oneness** is the **Way** without partiality,\nthe root of all things.\nPure and still, guarding **Oneness**,\nthey move yet remain unaware.\nAll things trace back to their root,\nand do not depart from this.\n\nA ruler who frequently alters laws,\na nation that frequently replaces rulers—\nfrequent changes in laws and measures,\nthe people cannot endure.\nA nation without roots,\nhow long can a ruler endure?\n\nBy their rank, people express their likes and dislikes,\nthe common path of the lower orders,\ntoo numerous to govern.\nThe Son of Heaven relies on his eminence\nto grant rank without restriction,\nindulging the nature of likes and dislikes,\nand thus fostering private inclinations.\n\nLaws and edicts proliferate,\nthe lower orders follow many divergent paths,\ntoo numerous to govern.\n\nThus, when a ruler loses **Oneness**,\nhis chaos exceeds that of a nation without rulers.\nFor when there is no ruler,\nthe people still uphold righteousness to support one another,\nand all submit to one another.\nBecause they cannot endure, a leader is established.\n\nNow, if a ruler instead becomes the cause of chaos,\nthen it is better to have no ruler at all.\n\nA ruler must hold to **Oneness**,\nand only then can they govern the multitude.\n\n**Wenzzi** asked:\n\"Does the **Way** of kings have many branches?\"\n**Laozi** replied:\n\"**Oneness** alone.\n\nTo attain **Oneness** alone.\n\n**Wenzzi** said:\n\"In antiquity, there were those who ruled by **Dao/Way**,\nand those who ruled by arms—\nwhy is it **Oneness** alone?\"\n\nHe said:\n\"Those who rule by **Dao/Way** rely on **virtue/power**;\nthose who rule by arms also rely on **virtue/power**.\nThe sovereign attains **virtue/power** by **Dao/Way**,\nthe people attain it by righteousness.\n\nThere are five types of warfare:\n**righteous war**, **responsive war**, **wrathful war**, **greedy war**, **arrogant war**.\nTo punish the violent and rescue the weak,\nthis is **righteous war**;\nwhen enemies come to attack,\nand one must use arms to defend oneself,\nthis is **responsive war**;\nto quarrel over trivial matters,\nto wage war for petty reasons,\nthis is **wrathful war**.\"\n\n「When the heart cannot prevail,\nthis is called **wrath**;\nto covet another’s land,\nto desire another’s wealth,\nthis is called **greed**;\nto rely on one’s nation’s grandeur,\nto boast of one’s people’s multitude,\nand seek to surpass rival states—\nthis is called **arrogance**.\n\n**Righteous war** brings sovereignty,\nfor it unites the hearts of all under Heaven.\n**Responsive war** achieves victory,\nfor it strikes only after the enemy moves first.\n**Wrathful war** meets defeat,\nfor it cannot endure even minor setbacks.\n**Greedy war** ends in annihilation,\nfor it cannot defend itself.\n**Arrogant war** leads to extinction,\nfor excess defies the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.\nThis is the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"To abandon the **Dao/Way** and rely on cleverness brings peril;\nto discard the **natural laws** and depend on talent brings ruin.*\n**Release** means to set aside.\n**Natural laws** are Heaven’s constant principles.\nAll who abandon the **Dao/Way** and rely on cleverness\nfind no day secure.\nAll who discard the **natural laws** and depend on talent\nbecome inferior and cannot succeed.\n\nThus, to uphold one’s proper measure and follow what is inevitable—\nwhen lost, one need not grieve,\nwhen gained, one need not rejoice.\nSuccess is not something one strives for,\ngain is not something one seeks.\nHe who adheres to his own **Dao/Way**’s measure\nand follows what must be\nsimply entrusts himself to Heaven’s command,\nremains tranquil amid fate’s unfolding—\nwhether success or gain comes,\nit lies in chance alone.\nThus, there is no grief or joy,\nfor it concerns only the inner self.\n\nTo receive is to accept what comes,\nto give is to bestow without expectation.\nEmbracing the **Dao/Way**, one encompasses all things—\nthough one receives, it is not greedy taking.\nEmbodying **virtue/power**, one benefits all ranks—\nthough one gives, it is not private favor.\n\nLike spring’s birth and autumn’s death,\nwhat is born does not resent its fate,\nwhat is taken does not harbor grudges—\nthis nears the **Dao/Way**.\nTo forget personal desires within,\nto act in harmony with the seasons—\nhow could resentment take root in the heart?\n\n**Wenzzi** asked:\n*\"How does one govern all under Heaven and win their joyful allegiance?\"*\n\nThe Master Laozi said:\n*\"If one is like the great rivers and seas—\nhumble yet not overflowing,\ncapacious yet not discriminating,\nthen one may be said to embody the **Dao/Way**’s return to all things,\nand to exhaust the hearts of the multitude below.\nVague and without fixed taste,\nits use is never exhausted.\nEmpty, tranquil, and detached,\nyet its responses are boundless.\n\nFirst small, then great.\nFirst, bring the small to submission with benevolence,\nthen complete the vast and profound.\nTo elevate oneself above others,\none must first humble oneself in speech;\nto lead others,\none must first place oneself behind them.\nThus, the world must follow its joyful love—\nfor all things below ascend to above,\nand those who hold back take precedence,\nthis is but following the **Dao/Way**’s natural course.\n\nWhat one grants to others,\nthe **Dao/Way** of joyful love will naturally gain their sincerity.\nAdvance their kindness and justice,\nyet without harshness.\nThough one stands above,\nthe people do not feel burdened;\nthough one leads,\nthe masses are not harmed.\nThe world willingly follows and never tires—\neven in distant lands or strange customs,\nas insects flutter or worms crawl,\nnone fail to cherish and love.\n\nWhen principles align with the right,\nthings gravitate toward affection.\nYet with kindness and righteousness as the core,\nall customs and ranks know what to embrace,\nand follow with delight, never weary.\n\nWithout it, nothing flows;\nwithout it, nothing succeeds—\nthus, it is most honored in the world.\nHe who holds this **Dao/Way**,\nhas no need for restrictive laws before him,\nall paths are open,\nwhat is more noble than this?\n\nThe Master Laozi said:\n*\"To cling to laws of a single age,\nand reject customs of successive generations,\nis like gluing a pillar to a zither while tuning it—\nthe five tones must blend and shift to form harmony,\nand laws must adapt to each age’s needs.\nTuning lies in variation,\none cannot glue a pillar;\ngoverning lies in fitting the times,\none cannot rigidly cling to laws.\n\nThe Sage adapts to time’s changes,\nand acts according to circumstances—\nthus avoiding rigid adherence.\nWhen the world shifts, so do affairs;\nwhen times change, so do customs.\nTo analyze the world and establish laws,\nto act in accordance with the times—\nthe myriad peoples’ emotions and deceptions vary,\ncustoms are never uniform.\nThe Emperor’s nature and governance differ,\neach age brings its own gains and losses.\n\nTo establish affairs with the times,\nwho but the Sage can fully grasp?\nThe rulers of antiquity,\ntheir laws and measures varied—\nnot out of contrariness,\nbut because their duties differed.\nThus, one does not follow their fixed laws,\nbut follows how they made them.\nFor how they made them,\nwas in accordance with the shifting transformations.\n\nTheir fixed laws,\nlike sacrifices to Heaven or offerings to Earth,\nare for their own time—\nhow could they be rigidly imposed?\n\nOnly those who follow shifting transformations can be lawful,\nand must be followed.\n\nThe Sage’s laws are visible,\nbut their reasoning cannot be traced.\nLaws are applied outwardly,\nwhere they may be seen,\nyet their inner principles remain unfathomable.\n\nTheir words may be heard,\nbut their true intent cannot be defined.\nThe words of laws may be passed down,\nyet the origins of their intent are inherently obscure.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors\nruled lightly over the world,\ntreated all things with care,\nequalized life and death,\nharmonized with transformation.\nThey abandoned their thrones with ease,\nand met each moment with perfect alignment.\n\nEmbracing the **Dao/Way** and extending sincerity,\nthey mirrored the myriad things’ emotions.\nWhen the **Dao/Way**, laws, and sincerity are clear,\nthey may be universally observed.\n\nAbove, they befriended the **Dao/Way**,\nbelow, they treated transformation as their kin.\nGoing and returning, all is the **Dao/Way**—\nthe **Dao/Way** is their eternal friend.\nMotion and stillness lie in transformation—\ntransformation governs their people.\n\nNow, if one seeks to learn their **Dao/Way**,\nyet does not grasp its purity and clarity,\nthey fail to follow the **Dao/Way** of the pristine and ancient.\nThe Sage of old, if placed in this age,\nstill applying ancient laws,\nwould surely fail to govern.\n\nMoreover, to hold fast to the past while ruling today,\nis to ignore time’s changes;\nto study the past with today’s eyes,\nis to miss its clarity.\n\nIt is best to take the times as one’s guide,\nand expand upon them.\n\n**Wenzzi** asked about governance,\nand the Master Laozi replied:\n*\"Rule them with the **Dao/Way**,\nnurture them with **virtue/power**,\nfor with the **Dao/Way** to rule them,\nthe people find their proper place.\nWith **virtue/power** to nurture them,\nthe people know where to return.\n\nDo not display your wisdom,\ndo not exert your strength—\nif a ruler values the wise,\nthe court becomes a battleground for renown;\nif a ruler relies on coercion,\nhe gathers resentment in one place.\nTo harm while clinging to one thing,\nis to diminish wisdom and strength,\nyet to uphold **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**.\n\nTo exploit opportunities is to lose the virtue of universal love,\nto indulge in visible desires is to disrupt the steadiness of governance.\n\nSquare yet not rigid,\nsharp yet not piercing—\nsquare does not demand cutting,\nsolid does not require carving,\nboth allow things to remain whole.\n\nNo boasting, no self-praise—\nno boasting of ability,\nno self-praise for deeds.\n\nTo rule with the **Dao/Way** is to gain the people’s attachment,\nand their affection.\nTo nurture with **virtue/power** is to gain their submission,\nand their devotion.\n\nTo not display wisdom is to ensure their sufficiency,\neach finding their own.\nTo not exert strength is to keep them simple—\nnone knowing what to resent,\nand all preserving themselves.\n\nTo not display wisdom is to practice frugality,\nto not exert strength is to refrain from arrogance.\nWhen the ruler is frugal in his use,\nthe world lacks nothing.\nWhen the ruler refrains from arrogance,\nall things remain naturally whole.\n\nTo gather from below,\nto take with gifts,\nto preserve through frugality,\nand to secure through restraint—\nthis is the **Dao/Way** of winning the people’s love,\nand gathering them in harmony.\n\nTo provide ample sustenance,\nand return it with benefit—\nwhen frugality ensures sufficiency,\ndesires are extinguished,\nand **virtue/power** is preserved.\nWhen restraint ensures security,\nresentment is absent,\nand all is at peace.\n\nTo not gather is to scatter,\nto not nurture is to rebel.\nTo display wisdom is to invite contention,\nto exert strength is to invite resentment.\nWhen the people scatter, the state’s power declines;\nwhen the people rebel, the ruler’s authority fades;\nwhen the people contend, governance becomes light;\nwhen the people resent their ruler, his position is in danger.\n\nIf these four evils are truly avoided,\nthe **Dao/Way** is nearly complete.\nIf the ruler can perfect all **virtue/power**,\nand eliminate these four harms,\nthen though called the **Dao/Way** of virtuous governance,\nit is also close to the pure winds of antiquity.\n\nThe Master Laozi said:\n*\"When the ruler speaks,\nthe people act;\nwhen the people speak,\nthe ruler acts—\nto accept the people’s words,\nand follow their counsel as water flows.\"*\n\nTo honor the ruler’s words,\nhis actions emerge like silk threads.\n\nThe ruler’s words are always heeded,\nand the people revere antiquity.\n\n**This** is the art of **flexibility**.\n\nTo establish teachings comes from the ruler,\nthus his words are always heeded.\n\nWhen counsel is given and **must** be accepted,\nthe precious thing is to know **flexibility**.\n\nOnly the Sage can truly know **flexibility**—\nhis words are always trusted,\nhis decrees always fulfilled.\n\nWhen words are trusted, the end brings proof,\nwhen decrees are fulfilled, the return ensures harmony.\n\nThe highest conduct in the world—\nto stand upright and defend one’s father,\nto be true and rescue one’s drowning mother—\nwho can truly value this?\n\nA father’s child is seized, and he defends his uprightness;\na mother is drowning, and he fulfills his promise to save—\nif such lofty conduct exists,\nwho would dare to show pity?\n\nThus, the Sage judges the right and wrong of matters,\nand adjusts with them in bending and extending,\nwithout fixed rules or outward forms.\n\nThe Sage follows what is fitting in each circumstance,\nusing it as his model and standard.\nHis actions are for the benefit of the people—\nhow could he be bound by a single moment?\n\nTo **bless** is to honor the ruler,\nto **drown** is to **dishonor** the ancestors and invite retribution.\n\nThe father, compelled by circumstances.\n**Dishonor**, to pull by the hair.\n\nFor the ruler and father’s dignity,\nwhen faced with **blessing** or **drowning**,\nto not honor the ruler is disrespect,\nto not pull by the hair is unfilial.\n\nCircumstances force what is contrary—\nto save what can be saved is all.\n\n**Flexibility** is what only the Sage can truly see.\nThe subtleties of **flexibility** are too refined,\nordinary emotions cannot grasp them.\n\nWhen one first opposes and then aligns—**this** is **flexibility**.\nWhen one first aligns and then opposes—**this** is ignorance of **flexibility**.\nIgnorance of **flexibility** will turn good into shameful.\n\nLet me test this with an argument:\nTo master **flexibility** is to stand between the two realms of **circumstances** and **opportunity**.\n\nBefore **circumstances** arise, one must consider **opportunity**;\nafter **opportunity** is seized, one must act.\n**Circumstances** lie in the matter,\n**opportunity** lies in the heart.\n\nOnly **flexibility** can internally awaken **opportunity**,\nexternally control **circumstances**,\nand uphold the proper **Dao/Way** and teachings\nwhile ensuring that later compliance and prior opposition\nfully realize the **Way** of perfect adaptation.\n\nThe ruler has his **principles**,\nactions have their **advantages** and **disadvantages**—\nto let the people act as if by nature,\nwhile they remain unaware of the reasoning behind it.\n\nThus, the *Book of Changes* praises the **reverence** of **gentle adaptability**,\nand the *Book of Songs* extols the **virtue** of **chastity and splendor**—\nwho but the Sage’s wisdom\ncould alone perceive this?\n\nIf **opportunity** and **circumstances** are not handled carefully,\nthey will harm oneself.\n\nIf **flexibility** is not applied appropriately,\ngood will turn to shame—\nhow can one not be cautious?\n\nWenzi asked:\n\"Master, your teachings say\nthat without **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**,\none cannot govern the world.\nYet rulers of ancient times,\nfollowing the legacy of their predecessors,\nalso had those without **Dao/Way**\nwho perished in their own era\nwithout facing ruin—\nhow does **Dao/Way** explain this?\"\n\nWhat is called\n**\"falling\"** the **virtue/power** of ancestors,\nwhile still avoiding ruin in one’s own time—\nit is because earlier generations had such cases.\n\nThus, I could not help but raise this question,\nto warn rulers of later generations\nwho doubt the **Dao/Way**.\n\nLaozi said:\n\"From the Son of Heaven down to the common people,\neach lives as they please,\nyet their lives vary in richness.\nIn the world, there are times of fallen kingdoms and ruined families—\n**this** is not due to lack of **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**.\n\nWhen one says there are those who perish in their own time\nwithout facing ruin,\nit is only because of the **thickness** of their **fate**.\n\nYet when kingdoms fall and families ruin,\nnone escape without losing **Dao/Way** first.\n\nDay and night without rest,\ntrembling and fearful,\nalways dreading danger and fall—\nthose who have **families** and **kingdoms**,\ntruly must be cautious like this,\nthus it is said:\n'You stand before your ancestors,\nlike a rotting rope guiding six galloping horses.'\n\nIf one indulges desires and neglects duty,\ntheir fall will come without delay—\n**this** is simply impossible to preserve.\n\nEven if **Jie** and **Zhou** practiced **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**,\nthough **Tang** and **Wu** were wise,\nthey would have no foundation for their achievements.\n\nIn the decline of **Xia** and **Yin**,\nit was not only **Jie** and **Zhou** who lost **Dao/Way**—\nyet some perished in their own time\nwithout immediate ruin,\nthough there were differences in **fate**,\nall shared the same cause of destruction.\n\nIf those two rulers had relied on **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**,\nthen how could **Tang** and **Wu** have established their achievements?\n\nIt is rare for one who loses **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** to escape ruin,\nbut none who uphold **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** invite disaster.\n\n**Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** are what\nnurtures and sustains life,\nwhat fosters growth and longevity,\nwhat brings mutual affection,\nwhat earns reverence and honor.\n\nThe **virtue/power** of **Dao/Way**’s nurturing,\nthe beauty of **respect** and **love**,\nare established from here.\n\nEven a deaf worm, though foolish,\ndoes not harm what it loves—\nif the people of the world\nall harbored hearts of **benevolence**,\nhow could calamities arise?\n\nThe world is full of deaf and foolish beings—\nare they not like crawling insects?\nYet they can still avoid harm and seek benefit\nto suit their own nature,\nthen the emotions of the people\ncan surely be understood.\n\nIf one truly follows the **Dao/Way** and **transforms** through **virtue/power**,\nevoking the hearts of mutual affection,\nthe roots of calamities will have no cause to arise.\n\nThose without **Dao/Way** yet without ruin—\n**benevolence** has not yet vanished,\n**righteousness** has not yet perished.\nBecause **benevolence** has not vanished,\nthe **virtue/power** of mutual affection remains;\nbecause **righteousness** has not perished,\nthe **virtue/power** of mutual support remains—\nthough in danger, they are not yet destroyed.\n\nEven if **benevolence** has not vanished,\nand **righteousness** has not perished,\nthe feudal lords already disdain their ruler.\n\nWhen feudal lords disdain their ruler,\nthe court becomes disrespectful,\neven if it does not rebel outright.\n\nThe utmost **reverence** and **obedience** lie in\n**responding** to the ruler’s **virtue/power**.\n\nWhen **benevolence** vanishes and **righteousness** perishes,\nthe feudal lords rebel,\nthe common people rise in force,\nthe strong oppress the weak,\nthe great encroach on the small—\nthe people make violence their occupation,\ndisasters multiply,\ncalamities arise—\ntheir fall will come without delay,\nhow could they hope to avoid ruin?\n\nWhen **Dao/Way** is lost, **virtue/power** is abandoned;\nwhen **virtue/power** is lost, one clings to **benevolence**;\nwhen **benevolence** vanishes, **righteousness** upholds;\nwhen **righteousness** perishes, the kingdom falls.\n\n**This** is how ruin comes—\na gradual process,\nall contributing to disaster.\n\nThus, when one loses **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**,\nthere will be disdain for the ruler and defiance of commands.\n\nFollowing the loss of **benevolence** and **righteousness**,\nthere will be fear of kingdom’s fall and personal humiliation.\n\nYet one’s body has its **fate** of richness or thinness,\na kingdom has its **destiny** of danger or ruin—\nthose with **thick** **fate** may endure danger throughout their lives,\nthose with **thin** **fate** will face ruin at the proper time.\n\nExamining the root cause,\nnone escape without losing **Dao/Way**.\n\nLaozi said:\n\"When laws are excessive and punishments severe,\nthe people resort to deceit.\nWhen the ruler is overburdened with affairs,\nthe people become scheming.\"\n\nNecessarily, they must employ manifold schemes to manage affairs.\nSeeking much yields little, forbidding much results in few obeying—\nfor when transgressions multiply, few are punished,\nand when offenses abound, few are victorious.\nAffairs breed more affairs;\nusing affairs to halt affairs\nis like fanning flames and hoping they will not burn.\nIf one ceases all affairs, then affairs cease.\nBut if one uses affairs to stop affairs,\nthe halted affairs resurge anew.\nTo stop the affairs that generate them\nonly to spawn the affairs that were halted—\nthis is like fanning fire to seek non-burning\nyet only to burn more.\n\n**Wisdom** generates calamity—\nmeaning the wise generate lesser calamities.\nYet they also counter it with wisdom,\nlike agitating water and hoping it will remain clear.\n\nWhen the ruler abandons cleverness,\nthe people preserve their nature whole.\nThe root of calamity lies in manifold schemes—\nonce calamity arises from wisdom,\nthen wisdom is again employed to prevent it.\nYet the way of natural clarity, undisturbed, is far beyond this.\n\nLaozi said:\n\"If a ruler favors benevolence,\nthen the unmeritorious are rewarded,\nand the guilty are pardoned;\nif he favors punishment,\nthen the meritorious are discarded,\nand the innocent are ensnared.\nFor benevolence uses compassion as its merit,\nand punishment uses blame as its function—\nif one has preferences,\nthen rewards and punishments become excessive and indiscriminate,\nand cannot govern the myriad people.\"\n\nLet us examine this:\n**Dao/Way** is the most precious of all things.\nAffairs are all accomplished through what one favors.\nYet if one establishes preferences to seek **Dao/Way**,\nthen preference remains in the heart,\nwhile **Dao/Way** is abandoned in what is sought,\nand thus contradicts its own principle.\n\nIt is also said:\n\"Those who do not lose **virtue/power** are thus without **virtue/power**.\"\nMoreover, **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**—\nthese cannot be achieved by favoring one alone,\nlet alone by partiality toward lesser matters\nto govern the world.\n\nWithout favor or aversion,\none punishes without resentment,\nand gives without expecting gratitude.\nLike the seasons of Heaven,\nhow could anything bear grudges?\n\nFollowing the plumb line and the measuring cord,\nthe body is uninvolved in affairs—\nlike Heaven and Earth,\nhow could they not cover and nourish all?\nTrusting in natural measure without contrivance,\none harmonizes with the two polarities in **virtue/power**.\n\nThe one who harmonizes and unifies is the ruler;\nunifying all in harmony rests with one person.\nWhat differentiates and distinguishes is law.\nThe offender naturally faces varying degrees of penalty—\nthis is the constant law of the state.\nThe people receive punishment without harboring resentment,\nthe ruler shows no partiality,\nand clears the world of guilt—\nthen those who meet punishment gladly accept their fault,\nwithout blame or grudge.\nThis is called **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**.\n\nOnly then does the state have the **Dao/Way** of great peace,\nand the ruler possess **virtue/power** without self-interest.\n\nLaozi said:\n\"The world’s right and wrong cannot be fixed—\neach age upholds what it deems good\nand rejects what it deems evil.\nWhat you deem evil, others may deem good,\nand what you deem good, others may deem evil—\nthis is not a public standard,\nso it cannot be fixed.\n\nThose who seek what is right do not seek **Dao/Way**,\nbut follow the principles of **Dao/Way**—\nthen all things are mysteriously unified, and nothing is wrong.\nTo seek what aligns with oneself is not to reject externality,\nbut to reject what contradicts the heart.\nIf one merely seeks alignment,\nthen partiality attaches to things—\nhow can this be called rejecting evil?\nOne only removes what is hated.\n\nNow, if I wish to choose what is right and dwell in it,\nand reject what is wrong and abandon it,\nI do not know what the world calls right and wrong.\n\nThose who seek what is right cannot make it so,\nand those who reject what is wrong cannot entirely eliminate it.\nIf I choose what is right to dwell in\nand what is wrong to reject,\nhow do I know the world will not cling to its own right\nand accuse me of wrong?\n\nIf so, then my alignment with what is right\nhas not yet escaped bias—\nthis is the art of governing right and wrong,\nyet it cannot be the rule for governing the world.\n\nThus, governing a great state is like poaching a small fish—\none must not disturb it.\nAgitate a small fish, and it will disintegrate;\ndisturb the myriad people, and they will dissolve in chaos.\nTherefore, those who establish laws and ordinances to distinguish right and wrong\ncannot govern effectively.\n\nThose who seek harmony—\nif their words are flattering yet accurate,\nthey grow closer to the ruler,\nbut if they are distant in body yet loyal in counsel,\nthey are met with suspicion.\nThe common sentiment of the world\nhas no public right—\nonly private alignment is deemed right.\n\nThus, flattery that is accurate brings closeness,\nwhile loyalty that is distant invites suspicion.\nEven if I wish to correct myself and await others,\nhow do I know what the world will use to scheme against me?\nIf I wish to correct myself and await others,\nwill there not be those who, because of my non-conformity,\nwill instead hold my correctness against me?\n\nIf I hastily flee with the customs,\nI am like one escaping rain—\nthere is no place untouched by dampness.\nIf I correct the world,\nthe world will also scheme against me—\nto hastily contend for correctness\nis futile in avoiding decline.\nIt is like fleeing rain—\nwherever one goes, one is still wet.\n\nTo dwell in emptiness yet cannot be empty,\nfor the heart has attachments—\nthus it is not empty.\nAs for deliberate correctness,\none’s actions are never truly correct.\n\nBut if one does not strive to be empty yet is empty,\nthis is what one desires and achieves without effort.\nIf one rides the flow of things and follows **Dao/Way**,\nwithout aversion to existence,\nthen one is empty without striving to be empty.\nIf one rests in the world’s ease without rejecting others,\nthen one does not contend for correctness yet is correct.\n\nNow, to attain emptiness without labor,\nand correctness without choice—\nis this not what was desired,\nall achieved effortlessly?\n\nThus, those who penetrate **Dao/Way**\nare like a cart axle that does not move itself,\nyet with the wheel reaches a thousand miles—\nturning at the boundless source.\nRemaining centered and unmoving,\none travels with all things,\nunhindered by distance or proximity.\n\nMoreover, the wheel of ten thousand transformations\nnever ceases—\nyet my responsive essence\nis boundless in its reach.\nThus, the sage embodies **Dao/Way** and returns to its origin,\ndoes not transform to await transformation,\nand acts without doing.\n\nThose who embody **Dao/Way**\nare ever-present yet unchanging.\nWith unchanging transformation,\none governs myriad transformations—\nand this wondrous function\nis not of deliberate action.\n\nLaozi said:\n\"Those who frequently win battles\nwill inevitably bring ruin to their state.\"\n\nThus, frequent warfare exhausts the people,\nand repeated victories breed arrogance in the ruler.\nTo govern with an arrogant ruler and weary people\nand yet avoid national ruin—\nfew such cases exist.\n\nWhen the ruler grows arrogant, he indulges himself,\nand indulgence leads to excess.\nWhen the people are weary, resentment grows,\nand resentment breeds cunning.\nExcess in things leads to ruin,\nand cunning in governance leads to upheaval.\nWhen both ruler and people reach extremes,\nthe state cannot but perish.\n\nThus, when achievements are complete,\nthe sage withdraws—\nthis is the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.\n\n---\n**Volume Five of the *Tongxuan Zhenjing*

Quanzhou Prefecture*.\n\n---\n**Chapter on Supreme Virtue**\n\nThings have no master—\n**Dao/Way** alone is constant.\nIts use harmonizes with all,\nand its mysterious power accumulates naturally.\n\nThus, with gentleness, one governs the world,\nyet never claims possession.\nKnowing how to unite all living beings,\nnothing escapes its proper order.\n\nYet the essence of supreme virtue\npenetrates everywhere—\nhence this chapter’s blend of inclusiveness and emptiness.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe ruler is the heart of the state,\nthe source of its survival or ruin.\nWhen the heart is at ease, all functions align;\nwhen the heart is agitated, all functions falter.\nThe body’s hundred limbs\nare like the state’s hundred offices.\n\nThus, when the body is in order,\nits limbs act without deliberation;\nwhen the state is in order,\nruler and ministers forget their roles.\nWhen limbs act naturally, they find their own ease.\nThus, one forgets what one serves—\nruler and ministers fulfill their roles without effort,\nand so forget their origins.\n\nLaozi’s teacher, *Changshu*,\ntaught: *\"See the tongue and hold to gentleness.\"*\nTeeth are hard, the tongue is soft—\nwhat is rigid perishes first.\nThus, softness is advantageous—\nthis is what should be upheld.\n\nGazing upward at the house’s beams,\nthen withdrawing to gaze at the river—\nsoft branches rise to the roof’s height,\nweak materials occupy the uppermost places.\nThus, one elevates what is before one’s eyes,\nmaking humility a mirror of retreat.\n\nObserving one’s shadow to know how to follow—\nwhat moves behind never strays from propriety,\nlike a shadow following form,\nunbound by tilt or turn,\nfor it does not contend with things—\nthus it remains constant.\n\nHence, the sage embraces emptiness and follows naturally,\nalways yielding yet never leading—\nlike stacked firewood, where the last placed rests above.\nThis is called *\"fulfilling virtue to achieve function.\"*\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"The bell’s sound destroys itself,\nthe candle’s light consumes itself,\nthe tiger’s stripes invite arrows,\nthe monkey’s agility invites capture—\nthus, the valiant die by strength,\nthe eloquent are ensnared by cleverness.\nThese all perish by their own advantages.\nThough one may know cleverness,\none does not know the advantage of not-knowing.\nOnly those who possess cleverness\nfail to grasp the use of not-knowing.\nThus, the bold in one skill,\nthe skilled in one argument,\ncan be led astray with partial truths—\nbut cannot respond to myriad transformations.\nOnly those who do not rely on cleverness,\nwho do not dare to act by skill,\ncan meet all changes.\"*\n\n**Dao/Way** is formless—\nseen, it has no shape;\nheard, it has no sound.\nIt is called *\"profound and obscure.\"*\nThis term describes **Dao/Way**,\nyet is not **Dao/Way** itself.\n\nThe wondrous origin enters the boundless—\nnever for an instant separated from all things.\nIts essence is profound and dim,\nits function manifest and clear.\nThough named with force,\nit claims no dominion.\n\n**Dao/Way** is inward reflection—\nabandoning desire, returning to simplicity,\none finds clarity naturally.\nWhen one finds clarity,\nthe world finds its own.\n\nThus, one is neither slightly awake\nnor deeply lost,\nneither slightly wise\nnor utterly foolish.\nOnly those who cling to knowledge\nfail to return to the vastness of not-knowing.\n\nDo not mirror the flowing stream—\nmirror the still water,\nfor it preserves its stillness without disturbance.\nOnly those who do not let things disturb the heart\ncan then respond to all things.\n\nThe moon wanes when the sun rises—\nopposing vigor with stillness,\nstillness must be complete.\nOnly those without rivals can remain still.\n\nYin does not override yang,\nlow does not transgress high—\nonly then can one preserve its proper place.\nWhen the sun rises, stars vanish—\nthey cannot contend with its light.\nGreat virtue in the world\nhumbly conceals lesser virtue.\n\nThe end cannot surpass the root,\nthe branch cannot exceed the trunk—\nheavy above, light below—\nits fall is inevitable.\n\nIf one seeks to dominate the heart,\nmovement will bring ruin.\nOne pool cannot hold two dragons,\none female cannot mate with two males—\none is fixed, two contend.\nThus, opposites cannot dwell together—\nonly the victorious are settled.\n\nJade in the mountains makes grass and trees lush,\npearls in the depths keep the shores moist—\n**Dao/Way** in the center harmonizes all forms.\n\nThe earthworm, lacking strong bones or sharp claws,\nfeeds on dry soil above and drinks from the Yellow Springs below—\nits power lies in singular focus.\n*Xīkè*—dry, clumped earth.\n\nWhen form has no reliance,\nthe heart has no dependence—\nand without dependence,\neven mud and water can sustain life.\n\nClarity is illumination—\na cup of water reveals the pupil’s depth.\nTurbidity is harm—\nthe Yellow River cannot hide Mount Tai.\nIf one clarifies the mind’s inch,\none can discern all things—\nnot dependent on the size of form or vessel.\n\nOrchids do not lose their fragrance\nfor lack of wearers;\nboats do not sink in the rivers and seas\nfor lack of passengers;\nthe virtuous do not cease their **Dao/Way**\nfor lack of recognition—\nthis is their inherent nature.\n\nGrass and trees bear fruit by natural endowment,\nyet practicing **Dao/Way** diminishes daily.\nThe petty cannot compare—\nonly those who align with their nature\ncan the world truly learn from.\nThis is the sage’s intent:\nto cultivate habit into nature,\nto match Heaven’s nature—\nhow could one settle for fixed fate without cultivation?\n\nTo enter purity from impurity brings constraint,\nto enter impurity from purity brings ruin.\nTo serve when not the proper time is ripe,\nthe wise will inevitably suffer.\n\n「If one advances without the proper talent,\nthe foolish will inevitably meet ruin.\n\nWhen Heaven’s two *qi* meet, they form a rainbow—\n*yin* above, inverted, clashing yet not harmonized,\nresulting in the rainbow’s fleeting appearance.\n\nWhen Earth’s two *qi* meet, they bring floods and drought—\n*yang* below, applied unevenly in virtue,\ninevitably causing floods and drought to stagnate.\n\nIn humans, these two *qi* manifest as illness.\nJoy and anger mingling in the chest—\nthis is the source of disease.\n*Yin* and *yang* do not remain constant,\nsometimes winter, sometimes summer,\nmoons unaware of day,\ndays unaware of night.\n\nFor the *yin* and *yang* of day and month,\nif they lack even a trace of impurity,\nthey fulfill the function of transformation and nurturing,\nestablishing the fixed virtue of alternating light and dark.\nThus, the ranks of ruler and subject,\nthe norms of male and female,\nare inherently distinct in order.\n\nSome say: \"Among the grandest of forms and *qi*,\nnone surpass *yin* and *yang*, day and moon,\nyet they cannot preserve their virtue completely—\nhow much more so for all other things?\"\n\nOnly the **Dao/Way**’s application,\nwhen practiced consistently,\ncan be called supreme.\n\nWide rivers yield great fish,\ntall mountains grow towering trees,\nvast lands nurture deep virtue.\nIf not rooted in principle,\ngrowth will not last.\nHence, one cannot fish without bait,\nnor lure beasts without traps.\nTo achieve one’s aims,\none must first prepare the necessary means.\n\nMountains hold fierce beasts,\nyet their forests remain uncut;\ngardens teem with venomous insects,\nyet their melons and cucumbers are still gathered.\nA realm possesses virtuous ministers,\nwho can resolve conflicts a thousand *li* away—\nas when Yue dared not attack Wu.\n\n---\n\n「Those attuned to the Dao/Way move like a cart axle turning within its hub,\nnever exerting itself yet reaching a thousand *li*,\nendlessly returning to its origin.\n\nAll things move day and night on their own,\nyet none can fully grasp their essence.\nOnly the boundless void that remains motionless\ncan fully align with their nature.\n\nHow much worse for those who fail to understand the Dao/Way,\ntoiling yet unable to govern the distant!\n\nThus, it is better to raise the crooked with the straight,\nthan to fail in raising the straight with the crooked.\nDo not force what cannot be achieved—\nthis principle is revealed in *The Chapter of Talismans*.\n\nA bird approaches, nets are spread to await it—\nhe who catches the bird is the one who holds the net’s eye.\n\nIf one sets only a single net’s eye,\nthey will never catch a bird.\nThe sage establishes teachings,\nnot because there are many paths,\nbut because the nature of all things requires varied approaches,\nthus spreading many net’s eyes.\n\nYet those who enter the true path\nreach a single perfect harmony.\n\nTo govern a family or state,\nto gather and employ diverse talents—\nthis is the same principle.\n\nThus, some matters cannot be preordained,\nsome things cannot be foreseen in advance—\nthe sage stores the Dao/Way and waits for the right moment.\nWhat is meant by storing the Dao/Way and awaiting the time?\nTo lure fish, one must first know the valleys,\nto attract birds, one must first plant trees.\nWater accumulates, and fish gather;\ntrees flourish, and birds assemble.\nIf one recognizes their nature and sets the trap,\neven different kinds will converge.\n\nTo act in accordance with the fish’s virtue,\none does not drag them into the depths—\nto act in accordance with the monkey’s virtue,\none does not carry them up the trees—\none merely releases them to their advantage.\n\nVirtue/Qi applied to things\ndoes not demand perfection of their natural state,\nnor does it value artificial methods to restrain their essence—\nthus it is said: \"Release them to their advantage.\"\n\nWhere one’s feet tread is shallow,\nand shallow is limited,\nyet only by waiting for what has not yet been trodden\ncan one achieve distant governance.\n\nWhere one’s mind seeks is narrow,\nyet only by advancing beyond what is not yet known\ncan one truly comprehend the Dao/Way.\n\nWhen rivers run dry, valleys empty,\nwhen hills are leveled, depths are sealed,\nwhen lips vanish, teeth grow cold,\nand when the Yellow River’s waters are deep,\nits silt lies upon the mountains—\nwherever there is entanglement,\none’s true nature cannot remain intact.\n\nWhen water is still, it is clear,\nwhen clear, it is calm,\nwhen calm, it is simple,\nwhen simple, one sees the forms of things—\nforms cannot coexist,\nthus they can be distinguished.\nOnly by preserving inner clarity and stillness\ndoes one naturally attain comprehensive insight,\nresponding with great constancy.\n\nWhat causes leaves to fall is the wind’s sway,\nwhat causes water to become turbid is external interference—\nthis is what is meant by \"harming their nature.\"\n\nThe shaping of jade into a *bi* disc is the work of a craftsman,\nthe refining of a *jian* mirror is the effort of a polisher,\nthe cutting of *mó* axes is the strength of a whetstone,\nthe grinding of *li* blades is the force of a grindstone.\nWithout carving, jade cannot become an instrument,\nwithout polishing, it cannot be sharp—\nthus, one must apply vigorous study and practice to advance along the Dao/Way.\n\nThe gnat and the steed both reach a thousand *li* yet do not fly,\nthe gnat lacks provisions yet does not starve—\nthose who rely on what they can attach to\nand surrender their essence without reservation\nachieve their aims without seeking them.\n\nThe cunning hare is caught and the hunting dog is cooked,\nthe high-flying bird is exhausted and the fine bow is hidden—\nthis is the Dao/Way of achieving success while preserving oneself.\nMany such cases exist in antiquity,\nwhere opening a realm and establishing merit\nled to death and dishonor—\nexamples abound, too numerous to recount.\n\nThus, those who understand the Dao/Way of Heaven\nknow how to begin and end well.\nAnger arises from what was not anger,\naction from what was not action—\ntrue insight lies in grasping the root of things,\nnot in valuing their superficial outcomes.\n\nThe sage acts with non-action to penetrate this principle,\nnot because past non-anger\nled to creatures growing insolent and then provoking anger,\nnor because past non-action\ncaused matters to decay and neglect until action was forced.\n\nTo see without seeing,\none attains what is seen;\nto listen without hearing,\none attains what is heard.\nTo fixate on what is seen causes constant dazzlement,\nto fixate on what is heard causes constant confusion—\nhow can this be called true perception?\nOnly by reversing this approach\ndoes one fully employ perception.\n\nBirds return to their homelands,\nhares flee back to their burrows,\nfoxes die on their ancestral mounds,\nand cold cicadas seek shelter in the trees—\nall things ultimately return to their roots.\n\nWater and fire repel each other,\nyet the *dǐng* cauldron and *lí* steamer exist between them,\nbalancing the five flavors.\nBone and flesh love each other,\nyet a slanderer placed between them\nmakes father and son endanger one another.\nIf one skillfully employs their methods,\neven opposing natures can be harmonized—\nyet if one harms their Dao/Way,\neven Heaven’s natural order can be corrupted.\n\nDogs and pigs eat without discrimination,\nthus their bodies grow fat,\nand they approach death.\nIf one seeks office without discernment,\neven if wealth enriches their family,\ntheir own lives grow perilous.\n\nThe *fènghuáng* phoenix soars to heights of a thousand *rèn*,\nyet none can harm it—\nit does not enter unstable realms,\nnor dwell in chaotic states—\nwho would dare to use snares and traps upon it?\nWith a hundred spears, one cannot pierce its limits,\nyet its eyes can see a hundred *bù* away—\nits vision does not stop at the corners.\n\nThe world’s pursuits\nall seek distant gains from things,\nyet cannot reflect closely upon themselves.\n\nIf one uses elevation to create mountains,\nthey become stable and not perilous;\nif one uses depression to create ponds,\nthey become deep and fish and turtles gather there.\nTo occupy a position of honor and accumulate virtue/Qi,\none becomes high and unassailable.\nTo dwell in an uncontested place and add humility,\none receives what the world offers.\n\nWhen trenches and ponds overflow,\nthey dry up in times of drought—\nthe source of rivers and seas\nflows endlessly without exhaustion.\nIf one does not grasp the source,\nthey will fluctuate with external conditions—\nonly by knowing the origin\ncan one preserve their constancy.\n\nThe deaf have no ears yet cannot be deceived by sight,\nfor they are refined in clarity—\nthe blind have no eyes yet cannot be deceived by sound,\nfor they are refined in hearing.\nEach use has its proper application,\nand they do not interfere with one another—\nthis is called refined focus in one use,\nnot divided refinement.\n\nMuddled water is turbid,\nyet can it wash my feet?\nA confused world can hide my body and obscure my traces.\nClear water sparkles,\nyet can it wash my *yīng* headband?\nA transparent world allows me to rise in office and take my place.\n\nSilk, when made into *guā* white cloth,\ncan become a crown or a *xiè* sandal.\nA crown is worn upon the head,\na sandal is placed upon the feet—\nthus, one use does not interfere with another.\n\n「Its constancy is thus established.\n　　The deaf have no ears yet their sight cannot be deceived—refined in clarity;\n　　The blind have no eyes yet their hearing cannot be deceived—refined in perception.\n　　Who would then complain or grieve?\n　　Gold’s strength surpasses wood—\n　　Yet one blade cannot harm an entire forest;\n　　Earth’s strength surpasses water—\n　　Yet one dipper cannot dam a river;\n　　Water’s strength surpasses fire—\n　　Yet one sip cannot extinguish a cartload of fuel.\n　　Though one holds the means to control,\n　　If their virtue and power are insufficient,\n　　It is as if they gain no benefit at all.\n\n　　Winter’s thunder, summer’s hail,\n　　Cold and heat do not alter their seasons;\n　　Frost and snow descend in abundance,\n　　Yet melt when the sun rises.\n　　Before the winter solstice, the yang-qi descends and forms thunder;\n　　Before the summer solstice, the yin-qi ascends and congeals into hail.\n　　Even in the months of extreme cold or heat,\n　　Their changes are never entirely cut off.\n　　If frost and snow are applied to them,\n　　They will vanish with the sun’s light—\n　　This is what is called *inner necessity* (*zhōng yǒu bìrán*), which cannot be externally controlled;\n　　*Seasonal necessity* (*shí yǒu bìzhì*), which cannot be altered by things.\n　　Only the wise and enlightened discern this for proper application.\n\n　　Tilt easily topples, lean easily adheres;\n　　A slight push aids, moisture easily brings rain.\n　　Thus, the virtuous act accordingly and pass on their teachings—\n　　Their methods are simple yet effective.\n\n　　The orchid’s fragrance thrives,\n　　Yet if it does not see frost,\n　　It withers in the midst of its prime—\n　　How could those of talent not be cautious?\n\n　　The toad repels soldiers,\n　　Its lifespan ending on the fifth month’s full moon.\n　　If taken at the halfway point of the fifth month and burned,\n　　It can repel soldiers but its poison harms—\n　　This is talent being harmed by misuse.\n　　Is it not said that one can be divine in things yet fail to divine themselves?\n　　Such as the white tortoise dreaming in the Song and Yuan courts—\n　　How lamentable!\n\n　　Those whose *qi* is dissipated are prone to inner decay,\n　　Whose actions invite external harm.\n　　Fruits out of season are inedible.\n　　Even if they possess their own vitality and luster,\n　　They can disrupt my natural constitution.\n\n　　Which comes first to ruin—the tongue or the teeth?\n　　Which is straight—the bowstring or the arrow?\n　　The teeth, being rigid, wear first;\n　　The arrow, being straight, bends first.\n　　What is supple and yielding preserves the virtue of rigidity and straightness.\n\n　　Shadows distort form,\n　　Echoes distort voice—\n　　One must guard their roots.\n\n　　To treat the dead as if they were alive is no good physician,\n　　To serve a fallen kingdom as if it were still standing is no loyal counselor.\n　　Thus, a ruler must be open to medicinal advice.\n\n　　When discussing difficulties,\n　　One can still enforce strict discipline and refine the *qi* to overcome them;\n　　When the proper course is impossible,\n　　One may combine expedients and adapt to changes to assist.\n　　No material is wasted, no principle abandoned—\n　　Seizing intent and harmonizing meaning may lie therein.\n\n　　Therefore, the saying: *\"A ruler governs ministers, ministers serve the ruler—\n　　Each must be cautious in their approach.\"*\n　　If one commands the *chāngchuí* flute yet lacks control,\n　　The ruler’s authority will perish.\n　　*Què*—to fix or determine.\n　　One cannot fix the pitch of music.\n\n　　If a ruler and minister violate proper order,\n　　Or if one usurps political authority,\n　　Even if the punishments are correct,\n　　They cannot be properly enforced.\n　　If one examines positions and laws accordingly,\n　　This is called *\"ruler’s punishments\"*—double gain.\n\n　　The deaf cannot sing to find joy,\n　　The blind cannot observe to engage with the world—\n　　Yet when the heart has its expectations,\n　　Form and sound naturally arise.\n　　Thus, calming the heart means nothing external remains.\n\n　　Walking through the woods cannot follow a straight path,\n　　Treading on perilous ground cannot measure a plumb line.\n　　To be entangled with things is to invite disorder,\n　　To confront calamity is to risk harm.\n　　Yet if one walks through the woods or treads on perilous ground,\n　　How could they then traverse the smooth, abandoned paths,\n　　Or wander the wide, straight avenues?\n\n　　The sea encompasses all within its domain,\n　　Thus it is vast—\n　　This is the virtue of containing all things.\n　　He who does not close their ears and eyes yet embraces sounds and colors,\n　　Who does not lock away their true nature to level all dangers and risks,\n　　Such a person’s Dao aligns with the sea’s capacity—\n　　They embody the virtue of harmonious reception and transformation.\n\n　　The sun does not rise twice in one day,\n　　The fox does not have two lords,\n　　The divine dragon does not pair,\n　　The fierce beast does not gather in groups,\n　　The rapacious bird does not fly in twos.\n　　The virtue of a single ruler,\n　　The singularity of one application,\n　　Still lacks equal or match—\n　　How much more so the Dao of the Sage and the grand transformations,\n　　The singular achievements of their solitary operations?\n\n　　It is not the *liáo* whisk that can obscure the sun,\n　　Nor the *fú* spokes that can outrun swiftness—\n　　Yet even these are not sufficient to rely upon.\n　　All who can influence things\n　　Do so through relative means—\n　　Verification comes from reality,\n　　And this is not enough to depend on.\n　　Thus, the Sage aids the world and benefits its use,\n　　Extending their influence through things,\n　　Riding the momentum while relying on people,\n　　Accomplishing deeds and claiming their rewards.\n\n　　Drawing the bow to shoot,\n　　The string alone cannot release the arrow—\n　　Yet only one in ten strikes its mark.\n　　If shooting aims to hit,\n　　Why shoot if it does not?\n　　A hundred shots, one hit—\n　　Success and failure cancel each other out.\n　　Yet all under heaven build their achievements thus—\n　　They forget their repeated failures,\n　　Only celebrating their one success,\n　　Is this not absurd in balancing reality and expedience?\n\n　　A hungry horse in the stable\n　　Is silent and still;\n　　Yet when hay is placed beside it,\n　　Its competitive spirit awakens.\n　　The nature of blood and *qi* is never without desire—\n　　Thus, when nothing desirable is seen,\n　　The heart does not stir into conflict.\n\n　　A three-inch flute cannot reach its full potential,\n　　Yet the world cannot be filled by it alone;\n　　Ten stones may suffice to block,\n　　Yet a hundred bamboos are needed to reinforce.\n　　The petty-minded have narrow ambitions,\n　　Ever unsatisfied and never fulfilled;\n　　The noble-minded possess spacious virtue,\n　　Dividing what is needed and finding sufficiency.\n\n　　Following the plumb line to cut does not exceed,\n　　Using the balance scale to measure does not err—\n　　Yet if one upholds the Dao directly,\n　　They will not exceed right and wrong;\n　　If one applies virtue evenly,\n　　They will not err in thickness or thinness.\n　　To lean on ancient laws and categories,\n　　Sometimes proves effective,\n　　Yet to rely solely on rigid standards,\n　　Sometimes fails.\n　　To govern the present while adhering to ancient laws and standards,\n　　Though the plumb line and balance may align,\n　　Still cannot definitively settle the world—\n　　Only those who discern the times and know adaptation can.\n\n　　To act thus is called *duàn* (judgment),\n　　To act otherwise is called *luàn* (disorder).」\n\nThe law conforms to the times, it stands firm;\nThe law defies the times, it falls into disuse.\n\nThe farmer toils while the noble is nourished,\nLaboring in cultivation to provide for the sovereign’s tribute—\nThus, if one diligently upholds the Dao,\nThere will be no hardship from lowly servitude.\n\nThe foolish speak, the wise choose.\nBroadly gathering and praising, they select the good and act upon it.\nIf one possesses true wisdom,\nThey can establish themselves by following others.\n\nTo perceive clearly is like holding jade and stone—\nThose who see principles distinctly,\nAre like jade within stone, plainly discernible.\nIf perception is dim, one must preserve their counsel.\nIf vision is murky, action becomes impossible.\n\nThe brilliance of a hundred stars\nCannot match the light of a single moon,\nAnd ten open windows\nCannot rival the clarity of one door.\nThose who accumulate small wisdom, deeming themselves enlightened,\nCannot yet comprehend the myriad categories.\n\nA belly-serpent cannot serve as a foot,\nNor a tiger as wings.\nThe Dao of Heaven diminishes excess,\nYet even so, if it unleashes calamity and venom,\nThose who harm the world—\nShould they not be feared and warned?\n\nNow, the ancient six *chi* (feet),\nIs but a single *bu* (step) of today.\n\nTo lie down and cross it, the lower talent finds no difficulty,\nYet when it lies within a single step and beneath others,\nTo pass over it—how difficult to stride across?\nTalent and material are used in the same way.\n\nTo stand and surmount it, the higher talent is not easily attained;\nIf one seeks to ascend, measuring the six *chi* (feet),\nAs they prepare to rise, the higher talent will not easily be gained.\nThe circumstances differ in their application.\n\nWith the same six *chi* of material,\nYet differing in where the circumstances are applied,\nThen difficulty and ease become separated,\nAnd distinctions between high and low arise.\nThus, the virtuous avoid dwelling in the lowly stream,\nAnd strive endlessly to strengthen themselves.\n\nThe assistant to the sacrificial rites gains a taste,\nThe one who rescues a drowning man gets hurt—\nThose who aid in both good and evil,\nStill suffer harm or benefit from it themselves.\nThus, their own consequences are clear enough.\n\nCovered by an unlucky tree,\nIt is struck by thunder and lightning.\nIf one loses their proper foundation,\nEven without encountering punishment,\nThey will not escape entanglement.\nHence, the virtuous choose their place carefully.\n\nWhen the sun and moon wish to shine,\nFloating clouds obscure them;\nWhen clear waters wish to be pure,\nSand and soil defile them;\nWhen fragrant orchids wish to flourish,\nAutumn winds wither them;\nWhen human nature seeks balance,\nLustful desires corrupt it.\nThus, one must be cautious in their likes and dislikes.\n\nTo be covered in dust yet wish to remain unstained—\nIt cannot be achieved.\nI have never heard of one who avoids transgressing against *yīn-yáng* (陰陽) yet remains whole in nature.\nJade and gold are worn by the worthy as ornaments,\nWhile coarse cloth and earthenware are treasured by the capable as wealth.\nThus, giving gold and jade to the weak\nIs not as good as giving them a length of plain silk.\nThings have no inherent nobility or baseness—\nOnly their proper use at the right time makes them noble.\n\nThose who cannot wear jade or gold,\nNor treasure coarse cloth and earthenware,\nCan truly be called those who have lost the suitability of their place\nAnd neglected the Dao of advancing their virtue.\n\nThirty spokes converge upon one hub,\nEach straight in its own groove,\nYet unable to enter one another—\nJust as ministers each uphold their duties.\nIf one can arrange talents according to their proper stations,\nThey will then employ their strengths to achieve great distances.\n\nThe skillful use of people\nIs like the legs of a centipede—\nMany yet without mutual harm,\nOr the tongue and teeth—\nFirm and soft complementing each other without destruction.\n\nThe skillful use of ministers and subjects\nIs such that officials, though many,\nHave no encroachment upon their ranks;\nThe civil and military, though different,\nAre close and complete their undertakings.\n\nStone is born firm,\nOrchids are born fragrant—\nFrom youth, their qualities are present,\nAnd with age, they become ever clearer.\nIf one governs things according to their nature,\nThey will naturally succeed.\nTo force or restrain them,\nTo take or give them,\nTo accept or decline them—\nThese are as distant as heaven and earth.\n\nSame use, yet differing in suitability,\nThough near, they are far apart.\nThe world is full of such cases.\nHence, the Sage demonstrates them as warnings.\n\nThose who grow twice do not reap the *shēn* (莘) grain,\nWhile leaves that sprout too early fall without frost.\nNobility lies in moderation.\nToo soon, and it loses its proper measure;\nToo late, and it falls short of its due.\n\nTo sully their standard,\nTo powder their foreheads,\nTo have a rotten rat beside them,\nYet burn incense in the hall—\nTo enter water yet hate its dampness,\nTo embrace foulness yet seek fragrance,\nEven the most skilled cannot succeed.\n\nIf methods are not grounded in their proper principles,\nEven those who skillfully apply them\nCannot cleverly achieve their ends.\n\nWinter ice can be bent,\nSummer wood can be tied—\nOpportunity is hard to obtain yet easy to lose.\nIt is more precious than a measure of jade and gold.\n\nWhen trees are in full vigor,\nThey regrow even after daily cutting,\nBut when autumn winds descend and frost arrives,\nThey wither in a single night.\nTo act in accordance with Heaven’s Dao,\nOne will easily achieve their aims;\nTo rely solely on oneself,\nOne will only waste their strength.\n\nThe bowstring drawn and arrows released,\nThe forest dense and axes entering—\nThis is not summoned by any,\nBut the result of form and circumstance.\n\nTo stand out in the world,\nOne must invite universal envy.\nIf blessings overflow in the home,\nThey will not escape being coveted and taken.\nA suckling pup biting a tiger,\nA crouching chicken striking a weasel—\nFavor is bestowed without regard to strength.\nThe world has no one who measures strength and guards their affection,\nOnly those who indulge desire without restraint,\nAnd thus bring harm upon themselves.\n\nThose who wait for profit to rise from drowning,\nWill also drown others for profit.\nTo reward those who rise from drowning,\nAnd to await them with profit—\nThen the world will have none who do not wish to drown and be rescued.\n\nThe reed’s leaves spread and arrows fly in unison,\nThe forest flourishes and axes strike deep—\nNot summoned by any will,\nBut the inevitable consequence of form and circumstance.\n\nTo excel in the world,\nOne must invite universal resentment.\nIf wealth abounds in the household,\nNone will resist its plunder.\n\nA nursling pup daring to bite a tiger,\nA hen striking a weasel while crouching—\nFavor is given without regard to strength.\nThe world knows no one who weighs strength and guards their affection,\nOnly those who trust emotion and indulge desire,\nAnd thus bring ruin upon themselves.\n\nThose who wait for gain from rescuing the drowning,\nWill also drown others for gain.\nTo reward those who rise from drowning,\nAnd to await them with profit—\nThen the world will have none who do not wish to drown and be saved.\n\n---\n\nAs for Jianzi, though he profited from releasing doves,\nHe ended up capturing more—\nThis shows that the true foundation of governance\nDoes not lie in achieving immediate results,\nBut in cutting off its source.\n\nA boat can float, a stone can sink,\nYet the foolish do not comprehend this principle.\nThe Sage understands the fixed laws of sinking and floating,\nThus never acts rashly.\n\nA swift horse does not advance when driven,\nNor halt when pulled—\nA ruler should not seek the Dao in such ways.\nEven if the worthy are talented,\nIf they lack loyalty and do not offer their service,\nThey cannot be relied upon for governance.\n\nThough water is level, waves must arise,\nThough a balance is true, it must tilt,\nThough measures are uniform, they must falter.\nEven if laws and teachings are equal and fair,\nThose who enforce and apply them may still err.\n\nWithout the compass and square, no shape can be defined,\nWithout the plumb line and level, no crookedness can be corrected.\nYet even those who use the compass and square\nMay harbor flaws in their own hearts.\n\nIf one’s inner sincerity is pure,\nAnd external laws and teachings are absent,\nThe people’s natural order will daily reveal its path.\nBut if laws and teachings are widely proclaimed,\nYet inner sincerity fails to match,\nThen neither will the people trust nor the world accept.\n\nThus, the true mastery of laws lies in the heart’s sincerity.\nHence the *Precision and Sincerity* chapter states:\n*\"Words spoken in unison are trustworthy,\nFor trust lies in the speaker’s resolve before utterance;\nOrders given in harmony are obeyed,\nFor sincerity lies beyond the command itself.\"*\nDoes it not mean that genuine sincerity must precede the application of laws?\n\nThe Tai Mountain’s height—\nDoubled, yet still unseen—\nThe autumn hair’s tip—\nExamined, yet clearly discerned.\nThings, great or small,\nIf turned away, become obscured,\nIf scrutinized, become clear.\n\nFire in bamboo and wood—\nWithout drilling, it does not spread.\nWater in the earth—\nWithout digging, it does not emerge.\nThough nature has its ways,\nOnly through diligent study can they be attained.\n\nAn arrow’s speed does not exceed two *li*,\nYet if taken step by step without rest,\nA lame tortoise can traverse a thousand *li*.\nLayered ages without pause,\nAnd hills become mountains.\nTo reach distant goals,\nLies in persistence, not in haste.\n\nThus, steady effort endures without exhaustion,\nLike the foolish old man who could move mountains.\nTo catch fish by the river,\nBetter to return home and cast nets.\nMastering the root alone\nEnsures self-reliance in the long term.\n\nA bow must first be strung before seeking its strength,\nA horse must first be trained before seeking its excellence,\nA person must first be trusted before seeking their ability.\nIf one’s resolve is refined from the start,\nIt cannot later be refined.\nPreserve one’s essence, and splendor will follow naturally.\nA skilled artisan cannot burn wood,\nA master craftsman cannot carve ice—\nThings have their limits; how can the virtuous ignore this?\nDo not fixate on what cannot be achieved.\n\nTo make people never cross the river,\nIs possible;\nTo make the river never have waves,\nIs impossible.\nIf there is no crossing to be made,\nThen peace remains between us and them.\nBut if one must cross and seek to avoid drowning,\nIt cannot be without waves.\n\nIf a pot never falls into a well,\nIt will never be without blame—\nYet the pot on the hearth\nHas no way to fall into the well.\nThose who reproach my actions wish to engage with me,\nThose who offer goods wish to trade with me.\nIf I do not know their true intentions,\nI cannot blame them for their deeds.\nYet since their motives are hard to discern,\nI must treat them with sudden directness.\n\nA single move in chess does not reveal one’s wisdom,\nA single pluck on a string does not express one’s sorrow.\nTo hastily accuse others\nIs to fail to exhaust their potential.\n\nNow, there is a burning coal:\nIf touched, it scorches one’s fingers—\nYet if placed near a pile of ten thousand stones,\nAll may be warmed.\nIf removed ten steps away,\nIt does not kill.\nThough their *qi* is the same,\nTheir accumulated virtue differs—\nFor though their *qi* may be similar,\nThose whose virtue is unevenly stored\nCannot be recklessly paired in their actions.\n\nThere is splendor, there must be decline.\nIf one’s nature is truly settled,\nThen one can remain undisturbed by the world’s changes.\nWhen the upper reaches are strict,\nThe lower must suffer.\nIf a lord refines his nobility,\nThe people will endure the burdens of lowliness.\nIf the lower suffer lowliness,\nThe upper cannot long preserve his nobility.\n\nGreat trees have deep roots,\nHigh mountains have firm foundations—\nNobility rests in its roots.\nLaozi said:\n*\"The drum does not hide its sound,\nThus it can produce sound;\nThe mirror does not conceal its form,\nThus it can reflect form.\nTo hoard and preserve,\nOne cannot always maintain it.\nTo empty and still,\nThen all responses will naturally suffice.\"*\n\nMetal and stone produce sound,\nYet they do not ring unless struck.\nFlutes and shawms emit tones,\nYet they are silent unless blown.\nThus the Sage remains inwardly reserved,\nNever led by external things,\nActing only when matters arise,\nResponding only when things present themselves.\nThe Sage contains responses without prompting,\nLike metal and stone.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven flows without ceasing,\nYet returns to its beginning,\nThus it endures forever.\nThe wheel turns repeatedly,\nThus it reaches distant places.\nIf Heaven’s Dao is never misaligned,\nThere is no excess.\nAbiding in Heaven’s natural course,\nOne attains unchanging virtue.\n\nWhen Heaven’s *qi* descends,\nAnd Earth’s *qi* ascends,\nYin and Yang intermingle,\nAll things harmonize in unity.\nUnity receives the nurturing *qi*,\nAnd all things are born in equal measure.\nThe virtuous thrive, the depraved perish—\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth exchange in harmony,\nThe virtuous support and complement each other to achieve success.\nIf Heaven’s *qi* does not descend,\nAnd Earth’s *qi* does not ascend,\nIf Yin and Yang do not intermingle,\nAll things do not flourish—\nMeaning they do not multiply and grow.\nThe depraved gain influence,\nThe virtuous perish—\nThis is contrary to the natural order,\nThus the virtuous cultivate moderation to avoid calamity.\n\nThe Five Grains do not grow,\nYet the Dao of Virtue remains preserved.\nIf the Dao of Virtue is preserved,\nIt does not flourish—\nThis is the meaning of perishing.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven:\n*\"It diminishes the full and benefits the scarce,\nThe Dao of Earth:\n*\"It diminishes the high and benefits the low,\nBoth returning to balance.\nThe Dao of Ghosts and Spirits:\n*\"It harms the arrogant and benefits the humble.\nThe Dao of Man:\n*\"It shuns the excessive and favors the modest.\nThe Dao of the Sage:\n*\"It is lowly, yet none can surpass it.\nThrough modesty, one attains the heights,\nThus the world cannot claim the heights for itself.\n\nWhen Heaven’s light is clear,\nThen it can illuminate the four directions.\nWhen a ruler is enlightened,\nAnd his ministers are enlightened,\nThe realm will be at peace,\nAnd the four seasons will bring stability.\nThis is the path to enduring prosperity.\n\nThe enlightenment of ruler and minister\nIs not about mutual scrutiny—\nIt is about not obscuring the Dao of governance,\nThus aligning with Heaven’s light and comparing virtues,\nAnd the world will find peace,\nWith the four seasons in harmony.\n\nThe Way of Ruler and Subject yet unaligned,\nEven though Heaven’s light shines over the realm,\nChaos and darkness still prevail.\n\nTo emulate Heaven is to endure.\nThe application of enlightenment lies in its transformative power.\nThe enlightenment applied must first transform those below.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is *wen* (pattern),\nThe Dao of Earth is *li* (principle).\nThe patterns of stars and constellations,\nThe principles of rivers and streams—\nOne unifies them in harmony,\nTime governs their shifts,\nThus all things are completed—\nThis is called the Dao.\n\nQi unifies to generate life,\nThe four seasons faithfully nurture growth.\nPushing through transformations of myriad forms,\nThis is the Dao of the Celestial Sovereign.\n\nThe Great Dao is vast and near—\nThe body, a thing of Heaven and Earth,\nHow could it not be the Dao?\n\nCultivate it within the self,\nAnd virtue becomes true.\nIf one follows naturally and accepts fate,\nUnknowingly aligning with the true essence,\nThen virtue arises spontaneously.\n\nCultivate it in things,\nAnd virtue will never cease.\nThrough expansive interaction with all things,\nFollowing their inherent principles,\nAnd thus aligning with the boundless nature of all things,\nVirtue cannot be constrained.\n\nHeaven covers all things,\nBestowing its virtue to nourish them,\nGiving without taking—\nThus, spirit returns to it.\n\nThe master of nourishment is none other than Heaven’s virtue.\nYet without form, it binds all things—\nHow could it be externally imposed?\n\nSpirit is initially endowed with lightness and clarity,\nThus Heaven possesses virtue without virtue—\nThis is why it is exalted.\nSpirit has the capacity for emptiness and openness—\nThis is why it is honored.\nTo honor and return to the exalted is natural,\nAs things follow their kind.\n\nTo give without taking is the virtue of the exalted—\nThus, it possesses virtue.\nWithout trace yet achieving success,\nWithout virtue yet residing above—\nNothing is higher than Heaven,\nNothing is lower than the marsh.\nHeaven is high, the marsh is low—\nThe Sage follows this,\nEstablishing order of high and low,\nThus the world is settled.\n\nThe marsh should be like the Earth.\nThe Sage follows Heaven and Earth,\nOrdering high and low,\nThus ruler and subject, father and son,\nEach fulfill their proper roles—\nAncient and modern, unchanging,\nThis is called Great Stability.\n\nEarth nourishes and sustains all things,\nGiving and taking—\nThus bones and flesh return to it.\n\nHeaven has the form of sustaining all things,\nEarth has the virtue of providing resources,\nYet when it comes to binding all things,\nWhere does it claim its function?\n\nBones and flesh are initially heavy and turbid,\nUltimately returning to the clods of earth—\nThus Earth has the trace of enduring virtue—\nThis is why it is lowly.\nBones and flesh suffer from stagnation and obstruction—\nThis is why they are base.\nTo base and return to the lowly is natural,\nAs things follow their kind.\n\nTo give and take is the virtue of the lowly—\nThe lowly virtue does not lose virtue,\nThus it has no virtue.\nFully achieving traceable results,\nIt is not the position of exalted virtue—\nThus the Sage’s mysterious virtue aligns with Heaven,\nAnd established virtue aligns with Earth.\n\nEarth supports Heaven,\nThus stability and peace endure.\nEarth is stable and peaceful,\nThus all things take form—\nForm is like birth and growth.\nEarth is vast and thick,\nThus all things gather upon it.\nStability and peace hold nothing unborne,\nVastness and thickness contain nothing unheld.\nEarth’s depth and thickness gather waters and streams,\nEarth’s Dao is broad and square—\nThus it endures.\nBroadness holds great forests,\nSquareness embodies great virtue.\nThe Sage follows this,\nThus virtue contains all things.\nLowliness draws things to it,\nPeace brings self-possession.\n\nWhen Yin harms things, Yang withdraws,\nAnd if Yin advances while Yang retreats,\nThe petty gain influence,\nThe virtuous avoid harm—\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\nMotion and stillness have their times,\nThus to defy Heaven brings great calamity.\n\nWhen Yang-qi moves, all things relax and find their place—\nThus the Sage follows the Dao of Yang.\nTo act in accordance with the times,\nOne can achieve desires without contradiction.\n\nTo follow things, things will follow in return;\nTo oppose things, things will oppose in return.\nTo transform thoroughly, things will not differ;\nIf things differ from me, transformation is incomplete.\nThus, one does not lose the nature and disposition of things.\n\nWhen the marsh overflows, all things grow without measure;\nThings have their inherent nature as their proper form,\nAnd their proper time as their disposition.\nTo govern and teach without losing these two,\nThen all things will flourish with nourishment,\nAll will be trustworthy and mature.\n\nWhen the marsh dries up, all things wither without leaves—\nTheir blossoms and flowers do not appear at their proper times.\nThus, if rains do not fall in season,\nThe world falls into ruin and chaos—\nMountains without paths,\nOppression and neglect,\nThen the people do not bear grain,\nAnd chaos and flight ensue.\n\nYang ascends yet returns below,\nThus it is the master of all things.\nHigh in position yet humble in virtue.\nHighness makes things reverent,\nHumility makes things affectionate—\nThus it can be their master.\n\nNot overreaching possession,\nThus it can end and begin anew.\nIts Dao wanes and flourishes,\nThus it does not reach exhaustion.\nEnding and beginning anew,\nThus it endures—\nThus it is the Mother of the world.\nTo be the Mother of the world,\nWithout this virtue, how could it be?\n\nYang-qi accumulates before it can be bestowed,\nYin-qi accumulates before it can transform—\nThere is none who can transform without accumulation.\nIf one’s own essence is not complete,\nOne cannot establish affairs—\nHow much more to govern all things?\nThus the Sage is cautious in what is accumulated.\nOnly by accumulating virtue and achieving harmony\nCan one be capable of transforming the world.\n\nWhen Yang extinguishes Yin, all things thrive;\nWhen Yin extinguishes Yang, all things decline.\nThus, if kings and nobles uphold the Dao of Yang,\nThe people will flourish—\nMeaning harmonious qi nourishes the people.\nIf they uphold the Dao of Yin, the world will perish—\nMeaning killing qi destroys the state.\n\nIf Yang does not descend to Yin,\nAll things cannot be completed.\nYin is low and still,\nThus Yang’s virtue does not descend—\nThen transformation cannot be achieved.\n\nThe lord does not descend to his ministers,\nAnd virtue’s transformation cannot be enacted—\nThus the ministers’ way comes to an end,\nAnd the lord’s benevolence is not bestowed,\nThen governance cannot be achieved.\n\nTherefore, when the lord descends to his ministers,\nTheir wisdom is heard—\nHe gains the ears and eyes of all under heaven.\nIf he does not descend to his ministers,\nHe becomes deaf and blind.\nA single person’s perception\nCannot be relied upon to govern all.\n\nWhen the sun rises from the earth,\nAll things flourish and grow—\nKings and nobles dwell above the people,\nIlluminating virtue and the Dao.\nWhen great officials occupy high positions,\nThe Way spreads and virtue enfolds the people,\nLike the sun rising from the earth,\nNourishing all things.\n\nWhen the sun sets into the earth,\nAll things rest—\nWhen petty men rule above the people,\nAll things flee and hide.\nWhen petty men occupy high positions,\nThey cannot govern in all directions,\nDriving the people to scatter,\nLike the sun setting into the earth—\nWould all things then perish and cease?\n\nWhen thunder moves, all things awaken;\nWhen rain nourishes, all things unfurl—\nGreat officials act in this manner:\nStirring to awaken the dormant,\nNourishing to bring forth growth.\nWhen the sovereign issues decrees,\nLike heaven’s thunder and rain,\nNone dare disobey his command.\n\nThe movements of Yin and Yang follow fixed seasons,\nYet great officials do not exhaust the people.\nThey follow the heavens and respond to the times,\nThus their actions are never misplaced.\nThose who push beyond the limits of the people\nSuppress their nature and bring ruin.\n\nWhen thunder shakes the earth, all things relax;\nWhen wind sways the trees, grasses and woods scatter.\nGreat officials abandon vice and embrace goodness—\nHeaven and earth spread virtue and remove filth,\nGreat officials reform flaws and enact governance.\nThe people do not flee far,\nThus their coming and going is extreme:\nThey flee when wrongs are extreme,\nThey gather when benefits are greater.\nAll people love their native soil,\nAnd do not wish to migrate—\nOnly when governance is oppressive beyond measure\nAre they forced to depart.\nWhen kindness and blessings reach few,\nThey are compelled to return.\nThis is not because their nature easily shifts.\n\nThe wind does not move, the fire does not emerge,\nThe sage remains silent, the petty do not speak.\nFire emerges only with wind,\nThe people follow the teachings of their superiors.\n\nWhen fire emerges, it must have fuel,\nWhen a person speaks, their words must be true.\nWith truth and sincerity, what cannot be accomplished?\nFire depends on fuel, speech on truth—\nThus they blaze and flourish.\n\nIf one follows teachings with constancy,\nAnd remains true without wavering,\nAll endeavors shall succeed.\n\nThe Yellow River runs deep, its destruction lies in the mountains;\nHigh hills descend into the abyss—\nThe principle is already evident above.\n\nWhen *yang* qi prevails, it transforms into *yin*;\nWhen *yin* qi prevails, it transforms into *yang*.\nThus, desire cannot be overfilled,\nNor joy pushed to its extreme.\nExcess leads to ruin,\nExtremity invites reversal.\n\nAnger without harsh words,\nRage without showing color—\nThis is called *calculating success*.\n\nTo discern the way of retaliation,\nYet not to provoke blame by striking first—\nThis is called *securing safety through strategy*.\n\nFire ascends, water descends;\nThe Sage’s Way seeks its kind—\nThough myriad things may stray,\nThose sharing its principle shall all be found.\n\nThe Sage, relying on *yang*, brings harmony to the world;\nRelying on *yin*, brings stagnation and drowning.\nThe *yang* Way nurtures and flourishes,\nThe *yin* Way is stern and destructive.\nIf virtue and blessings are spread widely,\nThe people shall be harmonious and content;\nIf only the harsh ways of Chu are employed,\nThe people shall sink in misery.\n\nLaozi said:\nThin layers accumulate into thickness,\nLow steps rise to heights.\nNoble conduct and profound virtue arise from steady cultivation,\nWhile initial shame and grave errors stem from repeated transgressions.\nThe virtuous strive earnestly to achieve brilliance,\nThe petty indulge recklessly to invite disgrace.\nEarnest self-strengthening builds virtue daily;\nReckless indulgence in desires leads to self-ruin.\nThe difference lies in what is accumulated.\n\nThough its rise and fall may not be immediately visible,\nThe virtuous heart does not waver in its constancy.\nThe Way of rise and fall lies in emulating goodness and uprightness,\nAdvancing swiftly toward brilliance from the start.\nThus, seeing goodness as if unable to catch up,\nTreating evil as if facing calamity.\nWitnessing virtuous deeds, one hastens to follow;\nEncountering vice, one acts as if in disaster.\nIf one turns toward goodness, even exceeding bounds brings no regret;\nThose who follow the Way, though blamed by others,\nShall bear no resentment toward them.\nFor the virtuous Way has its unchanging practice.\n\nIf one does not turn toward goodness,\nEven loyalty may turn to evil—\nWithout an inherent inclination toward virtue,\nEven if others are loyal, there shall be times of betrayal;\nThough they bring harm, resentment shall arise toward them.\nYet, people and I have mutual expectations,\nAnd constancy in virtue is not easily maintained.\nTo blame others for their inconstancy is unjust.\n\nThus, those who harbor resentment do not blame themselves,\nFor resentment stems from one’s own actions—\nWhy accuse others?\nSeeking virtue in others is less fruitful than seeking it within.\nSelf-mastery ensures all else is obtained—\nWhy rely on others?\nThus, reputation is self-summoned,\nKindred spirits seek one another,\nFame is self-bestowed,\nAnd position is self-assumed—\nNone of it comes from outside oneself.\n\nSelf-assumed position refers to the rank befitting wisdom or folly.\nWielding sharpness to strike, wielding blades to attack—\nWhy blame others?\nHarming others invites retaliation;\nResentment is self-inflicted.\nThus, the virtuous must guard against the subtle beginnings.\n\nAll things bear *yin* while embracing *yang*,\nTheir harmonizing *qi* forming unity.\nWhen the two *qi* blend in balance, it is called *he*.\nThough things may face *yin* or turn toward *yang*,\nTheir vital essence receives harmony.\n*Harmony* resides centrally—\nThus, grains grow in the heart,\nGrasses bear fruit in their stalks,\nFor stalks are the heart of grasses.\nEggs and fetuses form in the center,\nAll born from *harmony* dwelling centrally.\nThough their natures differ,\nThey all receive *qi* and kindred essence\nFrom *harmony*’s central abode.\n\nThose not born from eggs or wombs\nRequire time to gestate,\nMoistened and dried by seasonal shifts to take form—\nThey too arise with *harmony*.\n\nWhen the earth is level, water does not flow;\nWhen light and heavy are balanced, the scale does not tilt.\nAll things’ transformations arise from response.\nWhen *yang* prevails, life emerges;\nWhen *yin* prevails, death ensues.\nLike water in the crossroads,\nIt tilts with each stimulus—\nAttaining *zhonghe* (central harmony),\nIt remains balanced and upright.\n\nLaozi said:\nMountains reach their height, and clouds and rain gather there;\nWaters reach their depth, and dragons take form within.\nThe Sage cultivates the Way,\nAnd virtue flows from it.\nThe Way’s height and depth\nNaturally spread blessings.\n\nThose with hidden virtue shall receive manifest reward,\nThose with concealed deeds shall earn renowned name.\nHidden virtue lacks artifice—\nThis is the truest virtue.\nConcealed deeds seek nothing—\nThis is the most genuine conduct.\nWhen both true and real,\nEven if rewards remain unseen and names unproclaimed,\nThey cannot be withheld.\n\nHe who plants millet reaps not barley,\nHe who sows resentment reaps none in return.\nPlant millet, harvest millet;\nSow resentment, reap resentment.\n\n*Completes the Sixth Scroll of the Treatise on Penetrating the Mysterious*\n*Begins the Seventh Scroll of the Treatise on Penetrating the Mysterious*\n\nThe **Master of the Great Hall of Justice, Jù Biàn**, of the **Song Dynasty**, in his **Proper Conduct and the *Micro-Luminous* Chapter**:\n\n*\"Dao* beyond form is called *micro* (微),\n*Virtue* concealed within propriety is called *luminous* (明).\n\nThus, without *micro* one cannot fathom the True Principle,\nWithout *luminous* one cannot grasp the Mysterious Intent.\nThe essence of *micro-luminous* lies in the duality of *body* and *function*.\n\nLaozi said:\n*The Way* can be weak, can be strong,\nCan be yielding, can be firm,\nCan be yin, can be yang,\nCan be obscure, can be luminous,\nCan enfold Heaven and Earth,\nCan respond without measure.\nThis aligns with the intent of *The Origin of the Way* (《道原篇》).\n\nShallow knowing, deep not-knowing,\nKnowing’s exterior, not-knowing’s interior,\nKnowing’s coarse, not-knowing’s refined,\nKnowing is not-knowing, not-knowing is knowing—\nWho knows knowing as not-knowing,\nNot-knowing as knowing?\n\n*The Way* cannot be heard—heard, it is false;\n*The Way* cannot be seen—seen, it is false;\n*The Way* cannot be spoken—spoken, it is false.\nWho knows the formless as form?\n\nThus, all under Heaven know goodness as goodness—\nAnd so it becomes not-goodness.\nThe wise do not speak; the speaker does not know.\n\n*The Way* transcends form and sound—\nHearing and seeing cannot discern it;\n*Virtue* lacks embellishment—\nGood and evil cannot illuminate it.\n\nThus, the wise do not speak; the speaker does not know—\nThis is the utmost attainment.\n\n**Wénzǐ asked:** Can one be entrusted with *micro-speech*?\nLaozi replied: *Why not?*\nDo you mean *knowing how to speak*?\nHe who knows *how to speak* cannot speak *micro-speech*.\n*Micro-speech* refers to the most exquisite speech.\nOnly when one forgets speech itself\nCan one be entrusted with it.\n\nThe fisherman’s hands grow wet,\nThe hunter’s feet grow swift—\nNot because they take pleasure in it.\nThus, the utmost speech transcends speech,\nThe utmost action transcends action.\nThe shallowly wise contend over trifles.\n\nSpeech has its *root* (宗),\nAction has its *master* (君).\nHe who acts without knowing\nIs why he is not known.\n\n*The Way* is the ineffable marvel of the nameless,\nSpeech is the supreme principle of truth.\nThose who grasp the marvel do not speak,\nThose who illuminate the principle do not vie.\nWhen speech reaches its utmost, it is without speech—\nWhen action reaches its utmost, it is without action—\nYet self-awareness arises naturally.\nOne clings, saying, *\"I know.\"*\n\n**Wénzǐ asked:** Does governing a state also have its *law*?\n\nThe Master Laozi said:\n\nNow, take the driver of a cart:\nHe calls *\"Yā!\"* and *\"Chuò!\"* from the front,\nAnd the sound is answered.\nThe rear also responds in kind—\nThis is the driver’s song urging strength.\nThough the music of Zheng, Wei, Hu, and Chu\nMay differ in tone,\nNone surpasses this in its purpose.\n\nGoverning a state relies on *rites* (礼),\nNot on eloquence or argument.\nWhen laws and decrees grow excessive,\nThieves and bandits multiply.\nThe proper use of things must fit their purpose,\nEach must serve its role—\nLike the driver’s song urging strength,\nYet it would be misplaced to play with the music of Xianchi.\nWhy trouble with ornate speech\nWhen governing a state and calming the people\nRequires only the elevation of simplicity and plainness?\n\nThe Master Laozi said:\n*The Way* has no fixed form yet can be the standard,\nLike mountains and forests that can yield materials—\nMaterials do not encompass mountains and forests,\nMountains and forests do not encompass clouds and rains,\nClouds and rains do not encompass yin and yang,\nYin and yang do not encompass harmony,\nAnd harmony does not encompass *The Way*.\n*The Way* is the formless form, the symbol without substance—\nWithout understanding its intent,\nOne cannot transform and refine between heaven and earth.\n*The Way* has no fixed form,\nYet fixed forms arise from *The Way*,\nJust as materials do not encompass mountains and forests,\nYet mountains and forests yield materials.\nFrom clouds and rains downward,\nThose who speak of what does not encompass *The Way*\nDo so because it is formless and symbol-less,\nYet it embraces all things and encompasses all *Dao* (方).\nOnly those who embody *The Way*\nKnow its boundless transformations.\n\nThe Master Laozi said:\nThe Sage establishes teachings and implements governance,\nYet must observe their beginning and end,\nAnd discern their underlying *virtue/power* (造恩).\n*Constructing virtue/power* means creating laws and teachings.\nThus, when the people know writing, *virtue/power* declines,\nWhen they know calculation, benevolence declines,\nWhen they know bonds and contracts, trust declines,\nWhen they know tools and devices, substance declines.\nThese four arise only after *The Way* has been lost,\nAnd measures are established according to the times.\nThe stricter the measures become,\nThe more they are violated—\nThus, trust and sincerity decline,\nAnd cunning and deceit flourish.\n\nThe zither does not sound,\nYet its twenty-five strings each respond with their own tone;\nThe axle does not turn by itself,\nYet its thirty spokes each exert their force in rotation.\nStrings have slackness and tightness,\nOnly then can they produce melody;\nCarts have labor and rest,\nOnly then can they reach distant places.\nThose who make sound do so without sound,\nThose who make turning do so without turning—\nThe zither has no sound,\nYet sound resides in the strings;\nThe axle does not turn,\nYet turning resides in the wheels.\nThus, there is sound without sound,\nAnd turning without turning—\nOnly then can melody be produced,\nOnly then can distant places be reached.\n\nHigh and low follow different *Dao* (道):\nIf *The Way* is great yet the position is low, it brings disaster;\nIf *The Way* is small yet the task is great, it brings ruin.\nA cap cannot be worn on the feet,\nA subject cannot be honored above his lord.\nWhen high and low are disordered,\nRuination comes without delay.\n\nSmall *virtue/power* harms righteousness,\nSmall goodness harms *The Way*,\nSmall argument harms governance,\nExcessive strictness harms *virtue/power*.\nTo cling to minor kindness while obscuring *The Way*,\nTo indulge minor anger while harming supreme *virtue/power*—\nGreat governance is not harsh,\nThus the people are easily guided;\nSupreme *virtue/power* is effortless,\nThus the lower ranks do not rebel.\nUtmost loyalty returns to simplicity,\nThus the people have no deceit or concealment;\nAbove, there is fairness and rectitude,\nBelow, there is no treachery or guile;\nAbove, there is clarity and frugality,\nBelow, there is no craftiness or falsehood.\n\nThe Master Laozi said:\nWhen the *law* of seating is established,\nThe common people grow resentful;\nWhen the decree of demoting ranks is put forth,\nMeritorious officials rebel.\nLawsuits proliferate and drag others into blame,\nThe innocent suffer their grievances;\nRanks are diminished and meritorious officials harbor resentment,\nThus they plot rebellion.\nThose who examine only the traces of lawsuits\nDo not know the root of order and chaos;\nThose who are skilled in military formations\nDo not know the strategies of decisive victory.\nOrder and chaos are determined by the transformation of *The Way* through non-action,\nNot by the knowledge of officials who supervise and reprimand.\nDecisive victory is achieved through insight in the mind’s realm,\nNot by the understanding of a single soldier.\nThe Sage perceives blessings within fortified gates,\nAnd foresees calamities in the unseen depths.\nWithin fortified gates and in unseen depths—\nThe Sage alone can discern the profound.\n\nThe foolish are bewildered by minor gains,\nYet forget the greater harm—\nThus, some *Dao* bring small profit yet great ruin,\nGain here yet lose there.\nTo see the small and forget the great,\nTo gain profit yet forget harm—\nHow deeply deluded are they!\nHow can they be led astray?\n\nThus, benevolence finds no greater expression than loving others,\nWisdom finds no greater depth than knowing others.\nTo love others as oneself,\nIs to prevent unjust punishment;\nTo know others with sincerity,\nIs to ensure governance remains unerring.\n\nLoving others is like loving oneself,\nThen punishment will not be excessive;\nKnowing others with sincerity,\nThen governance will not be disordered.\n\nThe Master Laozi said:\nThe vastness of the rivers and seas,\nThough they overflow, does not last beyond three days;\nA sudden gust of wind and torrential rain\nDo not persist beyond a moment.\nThis shows that violent rule is brief,\nAnd ruin comes swiftly—\nJust as the wind rages fiercely,\nYet ceases just as quickly.\n\nThose whose *virtue/power* has no foundation\nYet fear no ruin—\nIt is because they have not yet reached it.\nWorry is the means of flourishing,\nJoy is the means of ruin—\nThus, the good turn misfortune into blessing,\nAnd the wise transform calamity into fortune.\n*The Way* is boundless yet can be employed,\nYet never becomes full.\nThe foolish cling to delusion and do not turn back,\nTaking worry as joy,\nAnd thus meet swift ruin;\nThe good uphold *The Way* and preserve simplicity,\nTransforming calamity into fortune,\nAnd thus flourish without fail.\n\nThe Master Laozi said:\nSerene stillness and tranquil harmony\nAre the nature of humankind.\nCeremonial forms and rules\nAre the measures of *Dao*.\nTo know the nature of others,\nIs to cultivate oneself without contradiction;\nTo know the measures of *Dao*,\nIs to ensure one’s actions are not disordered.\nTranquil harmony is the foundation of natural disposition,\nRules are the excess of restraining desire.\nDrawn by desire and profit,\nEven stillness becomes contradiction;\nClarity in *Dao* and measure,\nEven movement remains unerring.\n\nIssue a single command,\nAnd all respond without contention—\nThis is called *The Way*.\nTo grasp the root and know the branches,\nTo hold one principle yet respond to all things—\nThis is called *skill*.\nTo issue a command means to prevent the heart from contention;\nTo prevent the heart from contention\nIs to harmonize all actions and return to their foundation,\nTo respond to all things yet remain unified in *The Way*—\nThis is called *skill*.\n\nTo dwell knowing what to do,\nTo act knowing where to go,\nTo handle affairs knowing what to rely on,\nTo move knowing when to stop—\nThis is called *The Way*.\n\nThe Perfect Person acts and withdraws in due measure,\nKnows when to embrace fortune and when to face misfortune—\nIf otherwise, how could they be said to follow *The Way*?\n\nTo make others praise and honor me as a lofty sage,\nIs the strength of my heart;\nTo make others revile and slander me as lowly and base,\nIs the fault of my heart.\n\nWords issue from the mouth,\nYet cannot be restrained by others;\nActions arise from the near,\nYet cannot be restrained from afar.\n\nGood and evil originate with oneself,\nPraise and blame come from others—\nWhat all mouths proclaim,\nNo one can suppress.\n\nOne flaw in conduct,\nAnd its consequences reach far;\nMatters are hard to complete yet easy to ruin,\nReputation is hard to establish yet easy to lose.\nOrdinary folk all slight minor dangers,\nNeglect small matters,\nAnd thus invite great calamities.\n\nFor when disaster arrives,\nIt is self-generated;\nWhen fortune comes,\nIt is self-created.\nDisaster and fortune share the same threshold,\nBenefit and harm dwell as neighbors—\nWithout the utmost discernment,\nNone can separate them.\nThus, deliberate consideration is the gateway to disaster and fortune,\nAction and stillness are the pivot of benefit and harm—\nThey must not be overlooked.\n\nThe Perfect Person’s every action is deliberate,\nAnd they measure the end from the beginning.\n\nFor where name and profit arise,\nThere too disaster and fortune take root.\nThus, to block the source of name and profit,\nAnd seal the gate of disaster and fortune,\nIs to let wisdom naturally unfold,\nAnd to act and remain still without change.\n\nLaozi said:\nAll know the mechanisms of order and chaos,\nYet none know how to preserve life whole.\nTherefore, the sage assesses the world and acts accordingly,\nWeighs affairs and plans accordingly.\n\nThe sage can be subtle and manifest,\nSoft and firm,\nWeak and strong—\nThey adapt to the times, moving or still,\nAnd establish merit according to their resources.\nThey perceive things in their course\nAnd know their reversals;\nThey embody *The Way* as their form,\nAnd respond to its transformations.\nThus, they act throughout their life\nWithout ever being constrained.\n\nAll can grasp the principles of order and chaos,\nYet none can preserve themselves within their shifting currents.\nTherefore, the sage assesses the world and weighs affairs,\nResponds to endless changes,\nActs in accordance with the times,\nAnd never suffers disgrace.\n\nThus, some matters may be spoken of yet cannot be done,\nSome may be done yet cannot be spoken of,\nSome are hard to complete yet easy to ruin.\n\nWhat is done yet cannot be spoken of—\nTaking and discarding.\nWhat is spoken of yet cannot be done—\nDeceit and trickery.\nWhat is easy yet hard to complete—\nAffairs.\nWhat is hard to complete yet easy to ruin—\nReputation.\nThese four matters,\nThe sage attends to with care,\nAnd the enlightened alone can truly perceive.\n\nTo examine the shifts of action and withdrawal,\nAnd discern the causes of success and failure—\nOnly the sage and the wise can truly see.\n\nLaozi said:\n*The Way* of the common person is—\nTheir heart desires smallness,\nTheir ambition desires greatness,\nTheir wisdom desires completeness,\nTheir conduct desires rectitude,\nTheir capacity desires abundance,\nTheir undertakings desire fewness.\n\nBy \"heart small\" is meant—\nTo guard against disaster before it arises,\nTo be cautious of ruin in its minutiae,\nAnd not to dare indulge their desires.\n\nBy \"ambition great\" is meant—\nTo encompass all under heaven,\nTo unify diverse customs,\nAnd to gather the myriad judgments\nAs the hub of a wheel.\n\nBy \"wisdom complete\" is meant—\nTo know the end and the beginning without limit,\nTo let sound flow in all directions,\nAnd to be like a deep spring never exhausted.\n\nBy \"conduct rect\" is meant—\nTo stand straight yet never bend,\nTo remain pure yet never stain,\nTo endure hardship without altering their principles,\nAnd to achieve success without arrogance.\n\nBy \"capacity abundant\" is meant—\nTo possess both literary and martial arts,\nTo balance movement and stillness with propriety,\nAnd to adapt every action to its fitting measure.\n\nBy \"undertakings few\" is meant—\nTo grasp the essential and align with the multitude,\nTo hold fast to the strict and govern the broad,\nTo maintain stillness amidst chaos.\n\nThus, the small-hearted are restrained by the minute,\nThe great-ambitioned embrace all without exception,\nThe wise-knowing lack no understanding,\nThe rect-conducted have nothing they refuse,\nThe abundant-capacityed govern all without flaw,\nThe few-undertakings hold what is essential.\n\nAll these qualities,\nNone but the most exalted sage and true adept can fully embody.\n\nThus, the sage’s approach to goodness—\nNo minor matter goes undone,\nAnd to their faults—\nNo subtle error remains uncorrected.\nThey act without relying on shamans and sorcerers,\nYet ghosts and spirits dare not act before them—\nThis is the height of nobility.\n\nYet they tremble and guard themselves,\nEach day more cautious than the last,\nAnd thus achieve without doing.\n\nExternally, they do not fail others,\nInternally, they do not shame themselves—\nWhy need they summon shamans and sorcerers?\nWhy fear ghosts and spirits?\nFrom their reverent and wounded heart,\nThey can be preserved to the end.\n\nThe fool’s wisdom is already meager,\nYet their undertakings are many—\nThus their actions must falter.\nIf they employ upright teachings,\nIt is easy and must succeed;\nIf they employ perverse teachings,\nIt is difficult and must fail.\n\nTo abandon what is easy yet certain to succeed,\nAnd to pursue what is difficult yet certain to fail—\nThis is the path of folly and confusion.\n\nWithout measuring gain and loss,\nOne sits and invites peril and ruin.\n\nWhen undertakings are manifold and difficult to govern,\nEven toil will lead to defeat.\n\nWhen things are simple and easily followed,\nYet one does not act—\nThis is the ultimate folly.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"Fortune arises softly and subtly,\nWhile calamity erupts in tumultuous waves.\nThe patterns of fortune and misfortune\nAre faint and unseen by the common eye.*\n\n*The Sage perceives their beginning and end,\nThus one must not fail to observe them.*\n\n*Fortune is as light as a feather—\nOnly the Sage discerns it;\nCalamity looms like a great mountain—\nThe fool sees nothing of it.*\n\n*The enlightened ruler’s rewards and punishments\nAre not for himself alone,\nBut for the realm.\nWhat benefits oneself yet serves no function for the state\nShall not be rewarded;\nWhat harms oneself yet aids the state\nShall not be punished.\nThus the enlightened ruler’s rewards and punishments\nRest upon impartial justice.*\n\n*What benefits the state and aids the people—\nThen it is done;\nWhat profits oneself yet harms the people—\nThen it is halted.*\n\n*Therefore, righteousness lies in what is fitting—\nThis is called the gentleman.\nTo abandon what is fitting—\nThis is called the petty man.*\n\n*Is there a fixed distinction between gentleman and petty man?\nWhen actions and measures align with propriety—\nThen one is a gentleman;\nWhen conduct and use stray from due measure—\nThen one is a petty man.*\n\n*Those of supreme wisdom act without effort—\nThe highest sage attains effortless mastery.\nThe next toil without exhaustion—\nThe middle person strives without weariness.\nThe lowest labor without gain—\nThe vulgar, their minds dull and spirit bewildered,\nThus their toil grows ever heavier,\nTheir affliction ever deeper.*\n\n*The ancients savored the Dao without clinging,\nThe moderns abandon it without tasting.\nNot to cling—this is not dwelling.\nTo savor—this is savoring the Way.*\n\n*The ancients savored the Dao without clinging,\nThe moderns, lacking the Way, yet boast of themselves.*\n\n*Zhou’s tyrant made a ceremonial cap adorned with elephants,\nAnd used ivory chopsticks—\nYet Ji Zi rejoiced,\nFor he delighted in its extravagant splendor.\"*\n\n「The state of Lu buried its dead with *ou-ren*—\n*Ou-ren*, carved wooden figures resembling humans, were used as ritual vessels of the covenant.\nYet Confucius sighed—\nHe lamented their lack of propriety.\nObserving their origin,\nOne could discern their end.\nThe petty man, seeing the ceremonial cap adorned with elephants and the *ou-ren*,\nBelieved that in life they were honored,\nAnd in death they were grandly treated;\nThe noble man, gazing upon them,\nKnew that their Dao was in decline,\nTheir virtue/power extinguished.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"Ren\"* is what people admire,\n*\"Yi\"* is what people esteem.\nTo be admired by people,\nTo be esteemed by people,\nYet sometimes meet with death and the fall of one’s state,\nIs because one does not conform to the times.\nThus, knowing *yi* yet not knowing the world’s power,\nOne does not grasp the Dao.\nMerely extolling the seven virtues of *yi*,\nWithout recognizing the shifts of power and strategy,\nCannot avert ruin and downfall—\nHow could one be truly versed in the Way?\n\nThe Five Emperors valued virtue/power,\nAnd ruled by non-action.\nThe Three Kings upheld *yi*,\nAnd exterminated tyranny to bring peace to the people.\nThe Five Hegemons relied on strength,\nMeaning they depended on the knowledge and force of arms.\nNow, applying the methods of the Five Emperors to the age of the Five Hegemons,\nIs not the proper Dao.\nThus, the wise vary their actions,\nNot because praise is in fashion,\nBut because their conduct aligns with the times—\nSuccess or failure depends on the left or right.\n\nThe times differ, so governance must change.\nIn the age of the Five Hegemons,\nTo practice the Dao of the Five Emperors,\nIs like binding a pillar to a lute or treating thirst with hemlock—\nTruly difficult indeed.\n\nTo know Heaven’s will,\nTo understand humanity’s ways,\nIs to possess the means to navigate the world.\nNavigating the world is the constant way.\nTo know Heaven yet not humanity,\nIs to lack the means to engage with the common.\nTo know humanity yet not Heaven,\nIs to lack the means to play with the Dao.\n\nKnowing Heaven and humanity,\nKnowing the common and the times,\nOne can govern the world,\nAnd play with the Dao.\n\nTo follow one’s true intent and suit one’s nature,\nThe rigid and strong will oppose you,\nAnd to serve others with one’s body,\nThe *yin-yang* forces will consume you.\nTo suit your own intent,\nIs to go against their desires—\nYou must be opposed by the rigid and strong.\nTo yield to others,\nIs to exhaust your body—\nLike ice and fire attacking each other.\n*Yin-yang* refers to agitation and calmness.\n\nThose who attain the Dao,\nTransform outwardly yet remain unaltered within.\nTheir outward transformation reveals humanity,\nTheir inner steadfastness preserves the self.\nThus, within they maintain a fixed principle,\nWhile outwardly they bend and stretch,\nAdjusting with the world—\nActing in all things without falling into error.\nWhat is prized in the Dao,\nIs its *longbian*—\nIts boundless adaptability.\n\nThose who attain the Dao,\nIn motion, they are Heaven itself;\nIn stillness, they are Earth.\nTheir motion and stillness suit the times—\nTheir withdrawal and engagement lie within themselves.\nThus, the common cannot harm them,\nAnd the world cannot ensnare them.\nHence, when Confucius saw the Sage Lao,\nWas he not like a dragon?\nFor his transformations knew no limits.\nTo uphold one principle,\nTo extend one method,\nEven if success is achieved,\nIt remains unyielding—\nClinging to petty gains,\nYet obstructing the great Dao.\nOnce ensnared by one path,\nHow could one speak of the great Dao?\n\nThe Dao is serene and tranquil in its emptiness,\nNot bound by action or affected by things.\nIt does not act upon things for its own sake—\nBetween self and things, the distinction is naturally dissolved;\nIn the stillness and serenity, one’s nature is spontaneously divine.\n\nThus, to undertake actions in accordance with the Dao,\nIs not the doing of one who has attained the Dao—\nIt is the Dao’s own unfolding.\nThe Dao is fundamentally non-action,\nYet now it speaks of \"accordance with the Dao\"—\nThis is action itself.\nAction brings about affairs,\nAffairs bring about calamities.\nMoreover, the Dao has no fixed appearance,\nAnd affairs have no fixed order—\nTo act against the Dao’s flow,\nIs to invite confusion and discord—\nThen misfortune will surely arise.\nHence, it is said that this is not the doing of one who has attained the Dao.\n\n*Shi* means to set up—\nTo establish external rules and measures,\nIs the Dao’s ceremonial form,\nNot its true substance—\nOne cannot cling to it.\nTo cling is to lose it,\nTo act upon it is to fail.\nThe principle can be made clear.\n\nThe heavens and earth cover and load all things,\nThe sun and moon illuminate and clarify them,\nThe yin and yang nurture them,\nThe rain and dew nourish them,\nThe **Dao** and **virtue** sustain and uphold them—\nAll are spoken of as **one harmony**.\n\nHence, he who can bear the Great Circle walks the Great Square—\nThat is, the person who bears the heavens and walks the earth.\nHe who gazes upon the Great Clarity beholds the Great Brightness—\nThat is, the person who sees the sun and moon.\nHe who establishes the Great Peace dwells in the Great Hall—\nThat is, the person who abides in the cosmos between.\n\nHe who can wander in the **succinct** and **profound** (*suoyin*),\nShares light with the sun and moon,\nGives rise without form to what is formed—\nThus, the **True Person** entrusts himself to the **Spiritual Platform** (*lingtai*), and returns to the origin.\nHe reverses what has not yet been born.\n\nTo gaze upon the **succinct** and **profound** (*suoyin*),\nTo listen in the **silent** and **void** (*wusheng*),\nWithin the **succinct** and **profound** (*suoyin*),\nAlone there is **awareness** (*xiao*),\nWithin the **silent** and **void** (*wusheng*),\nAlone there is **illumination** (*zhao*).\n\nIt is said that the **True Person** amid the heavens and earth,\nBeholding the sun and moon’s light,\nWandering in the Great Peace—\nThen where does he not find **suitability** (*shi*)?\nDwelling in the Great Hall,\nYet nothing is excluded from the **succinct** and **profound** (*suoyin*) within;\n**Awareness** (*xiao*) in the **silent** and **void** (*wusheng*),\nAnd all sounds respond within the **silent** and **void** (*wusheng*);\n**Illumination** (*zhao*) in the **formless** (*wuxing*),\nYet all forms appear—\nThen he preserves with the heavens and earth,\nShares brightness with the sun and moon,\nDeposits himself in the **Spiritual Platform** (*lingtai*),\nEncompasses the **ultimate essence** (*zhi jing*),\nAnd is called the **True Person**.\n\nHis **use** is to **not use**,\nTo **not use** is to **then be able to use**;\nHis **knowing** is to **not know**,\nTo **not know** is to **then be able to know**—\nThis has already been expounded.\n\nThe **Dao** is the **Way** by which things are guided,\n**Virtue** (*de*) is the support by which life is sustained,\n**Ren** (*benevolence*) is the **manifestation** of accumulated **en** (*favor/grace*),\n**Yi** (*righteousness*) is the **harmonization** of personal **heart** with the **suitable** for all—\nThese four are the **principles** by which one governs the world and cultivates oneself,\nAnd they must not be lost.\n\nWhen the **Dao** is extinguished, **virtue** (*de*) flourishes;\nWhen **virtue** (*de*) declines, **ren** and **yi** arise.\nThus, in the **upper ages**, the **Dao** was followed without **virtue** (*de*),\nIn the **middle ages**, **virtue** (*de*) was upheld without **ren** and **yi**,\nIn the **lower ages**, **ren** and **yi** were enforced with fear of losing them—\nHence, the **Noble Person** cannot live without **yi** (*righteousness*), for to lose **yi** is to lose the means of living;\nThe **petty person** cannot survive without **li** (*profit*), for to lose **li** is to lose the means of survival.\n\nThe **Noble Person** fears losing **yi** as a **calamity**,\nThe **petty person** desires **li** as **blessing**—\nObserving their fears,\nThe paths to **calamity** and **blessing** diverge.\n\nWhen the **Dao** is lost and **virtue** (*de*) declines,\nThe seven **virtues** (*qi yi*) are slighted and **righteousness** (*yi*) grows thin.\nThe **Noble Person** without **yi** has no way to preserve his **Dao**,\nThe **petty person** without **li** has no way to sustain his life.\nThe **Noble Person** fears losing **yi** as a **calamity**,\nThe **petty person** seeks **li** as **blessing**.\n\nThe **Laozi** said:\nSome desire **profit** (*li*) and thereby harm **righteousness** (*yi*),\nSome desire to harm **righteousness** (*yi*) and thereby bring **profit** (*li*).\nTo feed a **disease** of dampness with **heat**,\nTo quench a **disease** of thirst with **coldness**—\nThis is how the multitude **nourishes** (*yang*) their **ailments** (*bing*),\nYet the **skilled physician** (*liangyi*) knows this as **causing harm**.\n\nPleasure to the eyes,\nDelight to the heart—\nWhat the **foolish** (*yu*) find **profitable** (*li*),\nThe **Daoist** (*youdao*) avoids.\nThe **Sage** governs by **first establishing** and **then harmonizing**,\nThe multitude by **first harmonizing** and **then establishing**—\nThus, the gates of **calamity** and **blessing**,\nThe **reversal** of **profit** and **harm**,\nCannot be overlooked.\n\nTo quench a **disease** of thirst with **water**,\nThe **skilled physician** (*liangyi*) knows this as **calamity**.\nThe **poor** take **wealth** from **unrighteousness** (*buyi*),\nThe **Noble Person** knows this as **harm**.\n**First opposing** and **then harmonizing**—\nThis is the **error** the **foolish** (*yu*) commit;\n**First harmonizing** and **then opposing**—\nThis is what the **Sage** abhors.\n\n**Profit** and **harm** are contrary,\n**Calamity** and **blessing** are inverted—\nOne must not fail to discern them.\n\nThe **Laozi** said:\nThose with **achievements** (*gong*) who abandon **ren** and **yi** will be **suspected**,\nThose with **guilt** (*zui*) who uphold **ren** and **yi** will be **trusted**.\nHence, **ren** and **yi** are the **constant harmony** of affairs,\nAnd the **most honored** (*zun*) **rank** in the world—\nThough **achievements** (*gong*) and **names** (*ming*) are already established,\nThe seven **virtues** (*qi yi*) must not be forsaken.\nTo forsake them invites **guilt** to accumulate,\nTo follow them ensures **rank** and **reward** are honored.\n\nThough one’s **plans** (*mou*) are **correct** and **strategies** (*ji*) are **apt**,\nAnd **worries** (*lü*) are **dispelled** by **schemes** (*tuo*),\nIf the state is preserved,\nYet one’s affairs **depart** from **ren** and **yi**,\nThen one’s **achievements** (*gong*) will surely **not be fulfilled**.\n\nThough one’s **calculations** (*ji*) are **not flawed**,\nYet one’s **strategies** (*ji*) are **no benefit** to the state,\nIf one’s **heart** is **complete** toward the **lord** (*jun*),\nAnd **harmonizes** with **ren** and **yi**,\nThen one’s **life** will surely be **preserved**.\n\nHence it is said:\nA hundred **words** and a hundred **calculations** that are **never apt** (*bu ru bangqi*),\nAre not as good as **abandoning** (*she*) them and **tending** (*qu*) to **ren** and **yi**.\n\nAs a **minister** to the **lord** (*jun*),\nOne who **plans** for the state’s **difficulties** (*nan*),\n**Exalts** the **lord** and **honors** himself,\nYet **achievements** (*gong*) are **not completed**—\nThis is due to **abandoning** **ren** and **yi**.\n\nSome have **wise counsel** (*liangmou*) yet it is **not used**,\n**Unusual strategies** (*qiji*) yet they **do not proceed**,\nThey **serve** the **lord** with all their **strength** (*jin*),\nThough **not observed** (*bujiancha*),\nThey **preserve** **ren** and **yi** without **daring** to **forget** them even for a moment,\nAnd thus their **lives** are **without harm**.\n\nThe **Laozi** said:\n**Teaching** originates with the **Noble Person**,\nThe **petty person** benefits from its **radiance** (*ze*).\n**Profit** originates with the **petty person**,\nThe **Noble Person** **enjoys** its **achievements** (*gong*).\nIf the **Noble Person** and **petty person** each **obtain** their **proper place** (*yi*),\nThen **achievements** and **rewards** are **shared** (*tonggong yishi*), and the **Dao** is **realized**.\n\n**Virtue’s** (*de*) **radiance** (*ze*) extends downward,\n**Rewards** and **profits** are **bestowed** upward—\nThen there are **no officials** yet **governance** is **self-regulating**,\nNo **commands** yet **actions** are **self-executing**,\nEach **dwells** in **their proper place** (*an qi suo*),\nAnd this is the **realization** of the **Dao**.\n\n**Desire** in excess **injures** **righteousness** (*yi*),\n**Worry** in excess **harms** **wisdom** (*zhi*),\n**Desire** gives rise to **righteousness** being **seized** (*yi duo*),\n**Worry** accumulates **wisdom** being **obscured** (*zhi hun*).\nHence, a state **delighted** in **profit** (*li*) will **surely** be **preserved**,\nA state **delighted** in **harm** (*shang*) will **surely** be **destroyed**—\n**Indulging** its **desires** (*zong qi yu*).\n\nWater flows downward and **becomes vast** (*guangda*),\nThe **lord** (*jun*) **subordinates** himself to the **minister** (*chen*) and **becomes wise** (*congming*),\nThe **lord** does not **contend** with the **minister**,\nAnd thus the **Way** of **governance** (*treat*) is **unimpeded**—\nHence, the **lord** is the **root and foundation** (*genben*),\nThe **minister** is the **branches and leaves** (*zhi ye*),\nAnd if the **root and foundation** are **not beautiful** yet the **branches and leaves** flourish—\nThis has never occurred.\n\nThe **Sage’s** (*shengren*) **governance** (*zhi*) is:\nTo **illuminate** the **four eyes** (*ming si mu*),\nTo **penetrate** the **four ears** (*da si cong*),\nTo **exclude** the **wicked** and **depraved** (*ping yie te*),\nTo **employ** the **virtuous** and **capable** (*ren sheneng*),\nThen the **lord** above **hangs** (*chui*) and **does nothing** (*wuwei*) while **transformation** (*hua*) occurs naturally—\nAnd the **ministers** below **exert** their **hearts** (*xin*) fully while **dutifully** (*fengzhi*) **serving**.\n\nHow could there be **mutual contention** (*jiaozheng*)?\nThis is the **root and foundation** **ever-firm** (*ri gu*),\nAnd the **branches and leaves** **prolific** (*fansheng*).\n\nThe **Laozi** said:\nThe **loving father’s** (*ci fu*) **care** for his **son** (*zi*) is,\nNot seeking **recompense** (*bao*),\nYet **cannot** be **internally resolved** (*nei jie*) in the **heart**.\nThe **Sage lord’s** (*sheng zhu*) **nourishment** (*yang*) of the **people** (*min*) is,\nNot for **selfish use** (*ji yong*),\nYet **nature** (*xing*) **cannot** be **restrained** (*bu neng yi*).\nWhen one **relies** on their **strength** (*li*),\nAnd **depends** on their **achievements** (*gong*),\nYet **must** **exhaust** (*qiong*) **all** for **reward** (*wei*),\nThen **favor** (*en*) **does not reach** (*bu jie*).\nThe **father’s** **care** for his **son**,\nThe **lord’s** **shepherding** of the **people**—\nHow could they **seek** **recompense**?\n\nThe **partition of nature** is the **Dao/Way** of **Heaven** (*Tian Dao*).\n\nShould any **lord or father** **rely** on their **strength** (*li*) and **achievements** (*gong*), and **grow arrogant** toward their **subjects or children** (*ci fu*), then **favor** (*en*) **does not reach** (*bu jie*).\n\nThus, **employing** what the **common people** (*zhong ren*) **love**,\nOne **gains** the **common people’s** **strength** (*li*),\n**Elevating** what the **common people** **delight** in (*ju*),\nOne **gains** the **common people’s** **heart** (*xin*).\nThus, **seeing** their **beginning** (*shu*),\nOne **knows** their **end** (*zhong*).\n**Compassionately loving** all **under Heaven** (*tian xia*), though **Heaven** be vast (*qian wei*),\nAll become **members of one family** (*ju wei yi jia*);\n**Not loving** all **under Heaven**,\nEven the **lowliest individual** (*pi fu*), though **mighty insignificant** (*qian wei*),\nYet **remains** an **enemy** to all **lands** (*wan fang*).\nBy this **perspective** (*guan*),\nThen **end and beginning** may be **known** (*zhi zhong shi ke zhi*),\nAnd **life and death** may be **discerned** (*cun wang ke cha*).\n\nThe **Laozi** said:\nWhen **people** **love** with **righteousness** (*yi*),\n**Factions** **strengthen** through **group bonds** (*dang yi qun qiang*),\nThus, **where virtue/power** (*de*) **is applied** (*shi*),\nIf **broad** (*bo*),\nThen **where the influence** (*wei*) **of authority** (*zhi*) **extends**,\nIt **reaches far** (*shi xing zhi yuan*),\nIf **righteousness** (*yi*) **is bestowed** (*jia*) **sparingly** (*bo*),\nThen **what is subdued by force** (*wu zhi zhi xiao*) **remains small** (*shi xiao*).\nThis **speaks** of **virtue/power’s** **bounty** being **without partiality** (*wu si*),\nAnd **those who adhere** (*fu*) **being many** (*zhi zhong*),\nIf **righteousness** is **abandoned** and **force** is **employed** (*qi yi yong wu*),\nThen **what is preserved** (*zhi cun*) **is few** (*zhi shao*).\n\nThis **refers** to **acquiring** without **righteousness** (*yi*),\nYet **not distributing** (*bu shu*),\n**Calamity** (*huan*) **will come** to their **person** (*shi*),\n**Unable** to **benefit** others (*bu neng wei ren*),\nYet **also unable** to **benefit themselves** (*bu neng zi wei*),\n**Such may be called** a **foolish person** (*yu ren*),\n**No different** from the **owl** (*xiao*) **loving** its **young** (*zi*).\n**Taking** without **righteousness** (*qi yi bu yi*),\n**Accumulating** yet **not dispersing** (*ji er bu san*),\nThis is the **so-called** *\"nurturing the tiger only to become its prey\"* (*yang hu zi di*) and *\"rearing the owl only to meet its doom\"* (*yu xiao zi bi*).\n\nThus, **holding** yet **preparing** (*bei*) **is not as good** as **abandoning** (*zhi ji*),\n**Hoarding** yet **sharpening** (*cui*) **cannot long endure** (*bu neng chang bao*).\nYet **even** a **treasure chest** (*ju gu*) or **woven basket** (*xiang lao*),\n**Will ultimately** become **the resource** (*zi*) **of great thieves** (*da dao*).\nHow could it **long persist** (*chang you*)?\n\n**Virtue/power** (*de*) **contains** the **Dao/Way** (*dao*),\nThe **Dao/Way** (*dao*) **contains** **virtue/power** (*de*),\nIts **transformation** (*hua*) **cannot be exhausted** (*ji*).\n**Those** with the **Dao/Way** **must** have **virtue/power** (*you dao zhi bi you de*).\n**Those** with **virtue/power** **must** have the **Dao/Way** (*you de zhi bi you dao*).\nWhen **virtue/power** and the **Dao/Way** are **fully realized** (*chong bei*),\nThey **harmonize** with **limitless change** (*yong bian hua wu ji*).\n\n**Yin** contains **Yang** (*yin zhong you yang*),\n**Yang** contains **Yin** (*yang zhong you yin*),\nAll **affairs** (*wan shi*) **thus follow** (*jin ran*),\n**Cannot be fully illuminated** (*bu ke sheng ming*).\nWhen **auspicious fortune** (*fu*) **arrives** and **blessing** (*xiang*) **is preserved** (*cun*),\nWhen **calamity** (*huo*) **arrives** and **blessing** (*xiang*) **comes first** (*xian*),\n**Seeing** **blessing** yet **acting wickedly** (*wei bu shan*),\nThen **auspicious fortune** **will not come** (*fu bu lai*),\n**Seeing** **inauspiciousness** (*bu xiang*) yet **acting virtuously** (*xing shan*),\nThen **calamity** **will not arrive** (*huo bu zhi*).\n**Benefit** and **harm** share the **same gate** (*tong men*),\n**Calamity** and **fortune** are **neighbors** (*tong lin*),\n**Only** the **divine and sagely** (*shen sheng*) **can distinguish** (*mo zhi neng fen*).\nThus it is said:\n**Calamity** (*huo*), **auspicious fortune**’s **leaning** (*fu xiang yi*),\n**Auspicious fortune** (*fu*), **calamity**’s **hidden presence** (*huo xiang fu*),\nWho **knows** its **limit** (*shi*)?\nThis **speaks** of **Yin** containing **Yang**,\nAnd **Yang** containing **Yin**,\nMeaning **fortune** contains **calamity**,\nAnd **calamity** contains **fortune**.\n\nIf one **sees** **fortune** yet **considers** it **auspicious** (*xiang*),\nThen one **knows** **fortune** as the **beginning** of **calamity** (*huo shi*).\nIf one **sees** **calamity** yet **immediately** **considers** it **good** (*shan*),\nThen one **knows** **calamity** as the **prelude** to **fortune** (*fu xian*).\nThe **arrival** of **calamity** and **fortune** (*huo fu zhi lai*),\n**Is like** **twining strands** (*jiao chan*),\n**Only** the **most sagely** (*zhi sheng*) **can know** their **limit** (*ji*).\n\nWhen **people** are **about to fall ill** (*jiang ji*),\nThey **must first** **relish** the **flavor** of **fish and meat** (*gan yu rou zhi wei*).\nWhen a **country** is **about to perish** (*jiang wang*),\nThey **must first** **abhor** the **words** of **loyal ministers** (*wu zhong chen zhi yu*).\n**The sick** (*ren bing*),\n**Indulge** their **mouth** (*gan qi kou*),\n**Delight** in **tastes** (*mei qi wei*),\n**This is a sign** of **certain death** (*bi si zhi zheng*).\n**The disordered** (*guo luan*),\n**Abhor** **loyal counsel** (*wu zhong yan*),\n**Believe** **deceitful speech** (*xin yi shuo*),\n**This is a sign** of **certain ruin** (*bi wang zhi zhao*).\n\nThus, **when one is near death** (*ren jiang si*),\n**Even** if the **physician** be **skilled** (*yi shi liang*),\nThey **cannot** be **saved** (*mo jiu*).\nWhen a **country** is **near ruin** (*guo jiang wang*),\n**Even** if the **loyalist** **be thorough** (*zhong jin*),\nThey **cannot** be **preserved** (*nan cun*).\n**Only** the **skilled physician** and **loyal minister** (*wei liang yi zhong chen*),\n**Can discern** the **certain death** yet **not treat** (*shen bi si er bu jiu*),\n**Can observe** the **preservable** yet **advise** (*cha ke cun er wei mou*).\n**Refine** it in **oneself** (*xiu zhi shen*),\nThen one **may govern** the **people** (*cai yi zhi min*).\n**Rule** the **household** and **govern** the **country** (*ju jia li zhi*),\nThen one **may** **transfer** their **care** to the **royal court** (*ke yi yi chang*).\n\nThus it is said:\n**Refine** it in **oneself** (*xiu zhi shen*),\nThen their **virtue/power** (*de*) **becomes genuine** (*nai zhen*).\n**Refine** it in the **family** (*xiu zhi jia*),\nThen their **virtue/power** **has surplus** (*nai you yu*).\n**Refine** it in the **country** (*xiu zhi guo*),\nThen their **virtue/power** **becomes abundant** (*nai fei yong*).\nBy **oneself** **observing** others (*yong shen guan bi*),\nAnd **the family** **governing** the **country** (*zi jia xing guo*),\nThe **essence** lies in **refining oneself** (*zhi yao xiu shen*),\nAnd **preserving virtue/power** (*zai yu quan de*).\n\n**People’s** **means** of **livelihood** (*shi*) **are** **clothing** and **food** (*yi yu shi*).\nIf **service** (*shi*) **is thorough** in **clothing** and **food** (*zhi yu yi shi*),\nThen there **is merit** (*you gong*),\nIf **service** is **not thorough** (*bu zhou*),\nThen there **is no merit** (*wu gong*).\nWhen **service** **lacks merit** (*wu gong*),\nThen **virtue/power** **does not endure** (*de bu chang*).\n**Clothing** and **food** are the **vitality** (*ming*) of the **common people** (*fu shi zhi ming*).\nThe **common people** are the **foundation** (*ben*) of **lord and subject** (*jun chen*).\nWhen **clothing** and **food** are **thorough** for **oneself** (*zhi yu yi shi*),\nThen **lord and subject** **are long preserved** in the **country** (*chang bao yu guo*).\n\nThus, **conforming** to the **times** (*su shi*) yet **not succeeding** (*wu cheng*),\n**Do not alter** their **laws** (*wu geng qi xing*),\n**Following** the **times** (*shun shi*) yet **not succeeding**,\n**Do not alter** their **governance** (*wu geng er li*).\nWhen the **times** **will rise again** (*shi jiang fu qi*),\nThis is called the **principle of the Dao/Way** (*dao ji*).\n\nThe **times** have **flourishings** and **declines** (*xing fu shi*),\nThe **course** has **prosperity** and **adversity** (*yun you xiang pi*).\n**One cannot** **use** the **excessive governance** of **past times** (*qian shi zhi fan zhi*) **as** the **essential principles** of the **present age** (*jin shi zhi yao li*).\nThis **speaks** of **laws** **not being abandoned** (*xing bu ke fei*),\nAnd **governance** **not being altered** (*li bu ke yi*).\nIf one **can discern** this (*neng zhi yu ci*),\nThen they **grasp** the **framework of the Dao/Way** (*dao zhi ji gang*).\n\nThe **Emperor** and **King** **enrich** their **people** (*fu qi min*),\nThis is **strengthening** their **foundation** (*dun qi ben*).\n\nThe **Conqueror and King** enrich their **lands**—\nThis is **pursuing** their **expansion** (*wu qi guang ye*).\nA **perilous state** enriches its **officials**—\n**Heavy taxation** leads only to **hardship**.\nTo **govern** a **state** yet **lack sufficiency**,\nTo **pacify** **chaos** yet **lack sufficiency**—\nThis is the **omen** of **impending disorder**.\nA **doomed state** **empties** its **granaries**.\n**Expenditures** **without measure**,\nGranaries **daily depleted**,\nThe **ruler** **impoverished**, the **people** **exhausted**—\nWhat **awaits** it if it does not **perish**?\n\nThus it is said:\nWhen the **sage-ruler** does **nothing** (*wu wei*),\nThe **people** **prosper** of themselves;\nWhen the **sage-ruler** **acts not** (*wu wei*),\nThe **people** **transform** of themselves.\n**Settle** their **dwellings**,\n**Delight** in their **labors**.\nRaise an **army** of **ten thousand**,\n**Daily** consuming **a thousand** in **gold**—\nAfter the **campaign’s** end,\n**Famine** **must** follow.\nThus **arms** are the **ominous tool**,\nNot the **treasure** of the

The Great Dao has no origin; the utmost principle has no return.\n\nYet when we trace it, the origin of the Dao lies within the realm of phenomena. But to restore the nature of things and trace their origin—how distant is this!\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"Only after life does one grow white-haired; old age precedes the beginning of things.\"*\n\nThere is a thing, unformed yet complete,\nThe meaning of the Dao is this: its principle is rooted in spontaneity, its essence in emptiness and quiescence. Unlike phenomena, how can words be applied to it? Yet when we speak of \"a thing,\" it is to clarify that which is beyond things. \"Unformed\" means it harmonizes the pure and turbid; \"complete\" means it omits not even the finest particle.\n\nBorn before Heaven and Earth,\nHeaven and Earth take darkness and yellow as their colors, square and round as their forms—how could the Dao arise after such shapes and hues? It is formless yet manifest, profound and obscure,\nApprehended by reason, not by sight.\nSilent and desolate, it emits no sound;\nIt responds without echo, is heard without voice.\n\nI forcefully name it the Dao.\nWhen both form and sound are absent, names and words cannot reach it. If we wish to convey its meaning, what choice have we but to force a name? The sages’ reason for calling it the Dao is that its meaning encompasses all without exception.\n\nThe Dao is lofty beyond limit, deep beyond measure.\nGazing up, it grows ever higher; bending down, it grows ever deeper. Thus, that which has a limit is not truly lofty; that which can be measured is not truly deep. It enfolds Heaven and Earth, embracing the formless;\nIt encompasses the Two Modes, giving rise to the myriad things without leaving a trace.\n\nIts source flows forth, empty yet never full.\nFlowing from the profound, it does not sever its origin; abiding in emptiness, it does not overflow into things.\n\nThough turbid, when stilled, it gradually clarifies.\nTo be one with things is called turbidity. Yet if we take its unstained essence and gradually harmonize it, its original clarity returns. \"Gradually\" means to contain principle with ease and composure.\n\nIts application is inexhaustible.\nIt adapts to use like fire.",

Through the sun, moon, and stars it is observed, enabling each to shine in its proper place.\nMountains rise by it, abysses deepen by it; beasts run by it, birds fly by it; the unicorn swims by it, the phoenix soars by it; the celestial bodies course by it.\nAll abide in the Dao of spontaneity.\n\nThe fitting of height and depth, the momentum of flight and movement, the refinement of swimming and soaring, the patterns of warp and weft—these arise without anticipation, arrive without assembly, form their course without appointed overseers.\nAll things receive it and find their proper place, equally partaking in generation and completion. Thus is it called the Great Dao.\n\nBy non-being it grasps being: that which has form is ever subject to decay; yet through formless decay it establishes the existence of the empty body.\nBy lowliness it attains eminence: that which holds rank is ever subject to demotion; yet through rankless lowliness it achieves undemoted eminence.\nBy retreat it takes the lead: that which contends is ever subject to withdrawal; yet through non-contending retreat it secures invincible precedence.\n\nOf old, the Three Sovereigns grasped the thread of the Dao, standing at the center.\nThe Three Sovereigns—Heavenly, Earthly, and Human Sovereigns—embodied the rulers who realized the Dao, perfect in pure harmony. Without governance, they transformed spontaneously; their virtue matched Heaven and Earth, guiding all things as one continuous thread. Thus were they able to lodge at the central pivot, applying its function while roaming freely without straying.\n\nSpirit and transformation prevailed, pacifying the four directions.\nRiding the principle of change and roaming through spirit, the people of the four directions each settled into their nature.\nThus, Heaven moves while Earth abides: the yang nature is firm and dynamic, the yin nature is yielding and inert.\nYet the wheel turns without ceasing, water flows without halt, accompanying things from beginning to end. Wind stirs, clouds condense, thunder roars, rain descends—all respond without end.\n\nWhen virtue harmonizes with spontaneity and governance flows in perfect accord, Heaven and Earth suffer no loss; the principle of cyclical motion remains unobstructed. Wind and rain do not deviate; the rhythms of dryness and moisture are balanced. The five phases do not clash; the six qi naturally harmonize.\nThus the sage moves with the spirit of Heaven, abides with the stillness of Earth; his commands are like wind and thunder, his beneficence like clouds and rain. Though the myriad things generate and transform without limit, he holds to the One and practices non-action, advancing alongside them.\n\nCarved and polished, they return to unhewn simplicity—restoring the nature of the ten thousand things.\nActing through non-action, it accords with the Dao: allowing things to act on their own, there is nothing it does not accomplish.\nThus things flourish in their nature while I remain ever inactive—thereby aligning with the Dao.\n\nSpeaking through non-action, it communicates through virtue: virtue is the function of the Dao; speech is the outward expression of humans.\nSpeech without intent penetrates things; things flourish in their proper order and preserve their peace. Thus, though one speaks all day, one never departs from virtue.\n\nSerene and joyful, without self-importance, one attains harmony: through absence of self-importance, one merges with the Great Harmony.\nThough the myriad things differ, each finds its ease in life: the ten thousand things vary, yet each suits its nature.\nIt harmonizes yin and yang—the Two Modes unite in harmony.\nIt regulates the four seasons—timing does not exceed its proper measure.\nIt balances the five phases—they do not encroach upon one another.\n\nIts moisture nourishes grasses and trees, seeps into metal and stone—its virtuous influence spreads widely, penetrating even the hardest substances.\nBirds and beasts grow large, their fur lustrous; eggs do not spoil, animal fetuses do not miscarry—all fulfill the qi of generation and completion.\nFathers know no grief of lost sons, elder brothers no sorrow of weeping for younger brothers; no child is orphaned, no person dies young.\nNo woman is widowed.",

      "translated_text": "When paired in proper kind, the rainbow and mirage vanish—such is the harmony of qi. Thieves and bandits do not arise, for none know the fleeting gains of ill-gotten profit. This is the fruition of embodying virtue. How perfect was the virtue of the Three Sovereigns! They ensured yin and yang never strayed, all beings followed their nature, and all befriended the Dao, becoming one with transformation—beyond naming.\n\nSome say: In the distant antiquity of great antiquity, the primal wind remained pure and unadulterated. The people lived simply, their tools uncarved and unpolished. Thus the five phases did not clash, the four seasons each kept their office, qi was concentrated and naturally softened, and all lived out their full span. Was this not the result of sagely rulers and virtuous governance, where people were transformed by their influence—could it be that the Three Sovereigns’ lack of virtue brought this about?\n\nLet us consider: The world is the body; the ruler is the heart. When the heart is disordered, the body falls ill; when the ruler is tranquil, the state is at peace. To achieve order and preserve life, merit finds its proper place.\n\nYet the Three Sovereigns arose in an age of pristine simplicity, a time entrusted to them, a path of self-governance. Had they not followed the Way of governance, forcing outcomes rather than letting things unfold naturally, temptations would have gradually arisen, and the natures of things would have been lost. The order of today is the subtle work of that primal achievement—its merit lies in non-action, its virtue unproclaimed. This is governance through non-governance, order that is not order.\n\nThe Way of Heaven gives life to things yet does not possess them; it transforms and completes yet does not dominate. Without intent, it gives life, and life arises of itself—thus it does not possess. Without intent, it transforms, and the myriad things complete themselves—thus it does not dominate. All things depend on it for life, yet none know its virtue; they depend on it for death, yet none can resent it. Where no love or aversion intervenes, how could merit or resentment find a place?\n\nIt gathers and stores without growing richer, distributes and bestows without increasing poverty. Winter’s yin consolidates, spring’s yang disperses, yet the qi of generation and destruction never wanes or overflows. Vague and indistinct, it defies representation—emerging from being and non-being, flowing through transformation, not to be grasped by any single form.\n\nElusive and fleeting, its function never exhausted—its use is inexhaustible. Profound and obscure, it responds to change without shape—its response leaves no trace. Penetrating and unobstructed, it never moves in vain—it acts only after being stirred. It coils and unfurls with hardness and softness, rises and falls with yin and yang, taking form in accord with all things.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: The \"great man\" is so called for his self-attainment. Serene and free from thought, tranquil and free from care, nothing in the world can sway his essence. He takes heaven as his canopy, earth as his chariot, merging with the all-covering and all-bearing. The four seasons are his horses, yin and yang his charioteers—thus he rides them. He travels where there are no paths, yet all is vast and open. He roams without weariness, his spirit beyond exhaustion. He emerges where there are no gates, proceeding without fixed course.\n\nTaking heaven as his canopy, there is nothing it does not cover; taking earth as his chariot, there is nothing it does not bear. The four seasons as his horses—there is nothing they do not drive. The work of generation and transformation ever operates thus. Yin and yang as his charioteers—there is nothing they do not prepare. The principle of growth and decline is thereby complete.\n\nThus, swift yet unshaken, distant yet untiring, his four limbs unmoving, his spirit roams without disturbance, his nature follows its course without fatigue. His clarity and insight remain undiminished, illuminating all under heaven—grasping the essence of the Dao, he observes the boundless realm.\n\nYet when desires arise, the myriad things surge in confusion, never attaining the mean. The six directions are open and all-pervading—knowing that form and nature meet, yet cannot be exhausted in one direction, only the spirit’s roaming can illuminate all under heaven. Grasping the essence of the Dao, is this not what is meant?\n\nProceeding without end, it is indeed fitting. Thus, the affairs of the world cannot be forced; one must follow their natural course and extend it. Affairs are vast and cannot be compelled by force—only by following the natural tendency can one move in harmony with them. The transformations of the myriad things cannot be fathomed; one must hold fast to the essential and return to it. The changes of things are boundless and cannot be exhausted by wisdom—only by grasping the unchanging essence can one meet the root of transformation.\n\nTherefore, the sage cultivates the root within and does not adorn the branches without. Nature is the root; form and tendency are the branches. He hones his spirit, stills his knowledge and perceptions, clarifies and brightens his essence, and lets his nature flow freely. He does not indulge his heart in pleasing sights nor become entangled in external things.\n\nThus, he is indifferent and non-active, yet nothing is left undone. When nature is one with things, all fulfill their \"doing.\" He does not govern, yet nothing is left ungoverned. Abandoning his own wisdom, he aligns with the self-governance of the myriad things.\n\nWhat is called \"non-action\" does not precede the actions of things—since it does not precede them, it is clear that it is not inaction, but rather acting in accordance with them. What is called \"non-governance\" does not alter the natural—since it does not alter the natural, it is not the absence of governance, but rather governing in accordance with it. \"Nothing is left ungoverned\" follows from the mutual accord of things. When self and things are in harmony, this is the meaning of mutual accord.\n\nLaozi said: He who grasps the Dao to govern the people responds to affairs as they arise and follows things as they move. He governs by following affairs and responds by following movement. The transformations of the myriad things—there is none to which he does not respond. The changes of the hundred affairs—there is none with which he does not coincide. Only with a mind free of intent can he fulfill them all.\n\nThus, the Dao is empty and nonexistent, level and easy, clear and still, soft and weak, pure and unadorned—these five are the form of the Dao. Its traces become form; its principle is the root of its body.\n\nEmptiness and nonexistence are the dwelling of the Dao—unobstructed, it can gather all. Levelness and ease are the plainness of the Dao—following the Dao, it is without ornament. Clarity and stillness are the mirror of the Dao—bright and upright, it can illuminate. Softness and weakness are the function of the Dao—embodying compliance, it pervades all. Reversion is the constancy of the Dao—returning emotion to nature, it attains constancy. Softness is the hardness of the Dao; weakness is its strength—soft, it cannot be broken; weak, it cannot be overcome. Purity and unadorned simplicity are the trunk of the Dao—this is its essence.\n\nEmptiness means nothing is carried within; levelness means the heart is unburdened. Not being laden with desires is the utmost emptiness; having no preferences or aversions is the utmost levelness. Unchanging unity is the utmost stillness—change pertains to movement. Unmixed with things is the utmost purity—mixture prevents it. Without sorrow or joy is the utmost virtue. The man of utmost virtue delights in heaven, thus he does not sorrow. Equalizing things, he has no joy.\n\nThe governance of the utmost man abandons his keen hearing and sharp sight—where there is sight he does not see, where there is hearing he does not hear. Merely exhausting the function of ears and eyes is not yet sufficient. Thus, opening and connecting the seven apertures does not limit their use to one movement. Never being enslaved, he attains the utmost in governing the body.\n\nHe eliminates ornamentation—how much less would he value external adornment beyond plainness and simplicity? He relies on the Dao and discards wisdom—resting in the open and level Dao, he abandons the wisdom of contrivance. He emerges with the people from the public—unlike them, he has no private interests. He simplifies what he holds—dwelling in essentials. He reduces what he seeks—indifferent to desires. He removes allurements and longings—he does not entice the people with cleverness nor admire the achievements of sages. He casts aside desires and discards thoughts.\n\nSimplifying what he holds brings clarity—dwelling in essentials, he is discerning. Reducing what he seeks brings attainment—not seeking, he constantly attains. Thus, with the center controlling the external, the hundred affairs are not neglected—when the center attains it, the external can be shepherded. When spirit is whole and nature complete, he exhausts the principles of nurturing form and guiding things.\n\nAttainment within the center brings peace to the five viscera, leveling thoughts—qi flows without disorder, nature remains unperturbed. Sinews and bones are strong, ears and eyes keen. The great Dao is smooth and broad, not far from the self—where is the Dao not present? How could it be distant from me? Those who seek it afar go forth and return. Deluded, they seek it outwardly; finding it within themselves, they return.\n\nLaozi said: The sage forgets about governing others and focuses on governing himself. Governing others through governance is merely using affairs to resolve affairs, yet affairs never cease. It is better to cultivate one’s nature within to attain spontaneity, so that all under heaven will be so of themselves.",

Profound and obscure, it responds to change without shape—its response leaves no trace. Penetrating and unobstructed, it never moves in vain—it acts only after being stirred. It coils and unfurls with hardness and softness, rises and falls with yin and yang, taking form in accord with all things.",

      "translated_text": "Though it leaves no trace of origin or destination, it lodges within the function of being and non-being. The Perfected Person embodies this—thus embracing emptiness and nothingness, levelness and ease, purity and clarity, softness and weakness, simplicity and unadorned plainness—never mingling with things. By virtue of this embodiment, they possess the five virtues of power.\n\nThe supreme virtue is the Way of all under heaven, hence they are called the Perfected Person. Humanity is one of the Three Powers. When one’s nature attains pure harmony to unite with all under heaven, this is the Perfected Person. The Perfected Person deems the self great and all under heaven small, values the governance of the self and disdains the governance of others—this principle has already been set forth above. They do not allow things to disturb their harmony, for the sage forgets the governance of others and attends only to self-governance. They do not let desires disorder their emotions, thus preserving their authenticity.\n\nThey conceal their name and surname, not wishing to display their traces. When the Way is present, they remain hidden; the highest virtue forgets virtue, hence it is unseen. When the Way is absent, they appear, for they have not yet forgotten virtue and thus reveal themselves.\n\nThey act without action, engage in affairs without affairs. Laozi said: \"Affairs arise in response to change and movement; when things change, I move, and only then do affairs arise. Change is born of the times, of the moment when generation reaches its limit. Those who know the times act without fixed conduct, for they respond to change.\"\n\nThus, the Way that can be spoken is not the constant Way, for the Way is named by its capacity to encompass the ten thousand things, hence it is not confined to one Way. The name that can be named is not the constant name, for names are named by their capacity to designate things, hence they are not confined to one name.\n\nWriting arises from words, for writing records words. Words emerge from knowledge, for knowledge establishes words and records them in writing. Yet those who know do not know—this is not the constant Way. They merely constrain their knowledge to establish words, yet fail to respond to change, hence they are not constant in one Way. The name that can be named is not the repository of books, for books merely record the words of what is known; yet the names that designate things are not constant in one name, hence they cannot be contained in books.\n\nMuch learning leads to frequent exhaustion; it is better to guard the center. Those who cling to books of established words will repeatedly reach dead ends. Only by embracing and guarding harmony can one remain constantly unobstructed.\n\nAbandoning learning brings no sorrow, for worldly learning teaches through classics and rituals, instructs with propriety and righteousness, aiming to adorn the exterior to distinguish the worthy from the foolish, and to lure them toward grand conduct—thus losing their nature. The sage establishes teachings to preserve nature, hence abandoning them brings no sorrow.\n\nRejecting sageliness and discarding wisdom benefits the people a hundredfold, for sageliness is the origin of legal systems, and wisdom the beginning of schemes and plans. Since they initiate traces that disorder things and harm the source of life and nature, abandoning them brings a hundredfold benefit.\n\nHumans are born tranquil—this is the nature of heaven. The Way of heaven is tranquil, hence it generates; nature comes from heaven, hence it is tranquil. Movement follows stimulation—this harms one’s nature. When stimulated, one moves, and this harms the nature. Things arrive and one responds—this is the movement of knowledge. Things are of many kinds, and knowledge arises to distinguish them. When knowledge encounters things, likes and dislikes arise. As likes and dislikes take form, knowledge is drawn outward; knowledge, in distinguishing things, generates desires of attraction and aversion, while things, in stimulating knowledge, form appearances of beauty and ugliness. Once these take root within, one loses what is external.\n\nUnable to return to the self, the principle of heaven is extinguished. This principle is one’s nature. Therefore, the sage does not exchange heaven for humanity, does not replace heavenly nature with human desire. Externally, they transform with things, yet internally, they do not lose their essence—essence being akin to nature. Thus, those who penetrate the Way return to purity and tranquility, while those who exhaustively pursue things ultimately attain non-action. Returning to nature, one communicates with the Way; through non-action, one can exhaustively comprehend things.\n\nThey nurture wisdom with serenity, for stillness is self-reflection. They contain spirit with indifference, for emptiness ensures the spirit’s correctness. They enter through no gate—this principle has already been set forth above.\n\nThose who follow heaven wander with the Way, for yielding to nature, the spirit roams with transformation, never departing from the Way. Those who follow others associate with the vulgar, for conforming to human affairs and engaging with things through emotion is merely mingling with the common world.\n\nThus, the sage does not allow humanity to disturb heaven, does not let desires disorder emotions—this preserves their simplicity. They do not scheme yet are fitting, for without prior planning, they naturally align with affairs. They do not speak yet are trusted, for their responses never miss the mark, hence they are trusted without words. They do not deliberate yet attain, for an empty mind penetrates within, hence they achieve order without deliberation. They do not act yet accomplish, for abiding in uprightness and tranquility, they accomplish all without action.\n\nThus, when they dwell above, people do not feel burdened; when they stand before others, the multitude is not harmed. Covering all with the Way, the myriad kinds find peace—hence they are not burdensome. Guiding with virtue, all natures are harmonized—hence they are not harmed. All under heaven turn to them, and the devious fear them, for they turn to their virtue and fear their impartiality.\n\nSince they do not contend with the ten thousand things, none dare contend with them. They subdue the ten thousand things with softness, overcoming with the Way—who can compare in virtue? Laozi said: \"When people follow desires, they lose their nature, and their movements are never upright. In governing the self, this brings defilement, for desires in the self weary the body and stain conduct. In governing the state, this brings chaos, for desires in the state weary the people and disorder governance.\"\n\nThus, those who have not heard the Way have no means to return to their nature, for the Way reveals nature, and nature returns from desire. Those who are not attuned to things cannot attain purity and tranquility, for attaining principle brings understanding, and non-disturbance brings stillness.\n\nTracing human nature to its origin, it is without inner defilement, for it is received from heaven. Yet prolonged immersion in things leads to change, and change leads to forgetting the root, thus merging with that nature—\"that\" meaning the other. When one engages with things, desires arise.\n\nThe nature of water desires clarity, yet sand and stone defile it; the nature of humans desires equilibrium, yet cravings and desires harm it. Only the sage can forsake things and return to the self, abandoning the objects of craving and desire to return to the pure and tranquil self.",
      "overlap_context": "ving, it pervades all in profound obscurity—this obscurity is like yin and yang. Movement brings rest, but stillness knows no limit; only in its quiescence is it the master of generation and transformation.\n\nVast and boundless, it cannot be deemed external; minute and infinitesimal, it cannot be deemed internal—neither great nor small can contain it within or without. It has no walled dwelling, nor can the six directions encompass it. Yet it gives rise to the general name of being and non-being.",

      "translated_text": "Thus the sage does not allow the self to be enslaved by things. Abiding in the wondrous, how can things burden him? How could he accept servitude? He does not let desire disrupt harmony, so his joy is not exuberant—tranquil contentment brings no elation. His sorrow is not mournful—what lament is there in well-ordered governance?\n\nTherefore, though exalted he is not imperiled, though secure he does not topple. Forgetting rank to share the people’s lot, he does not endanger his eminence. Forgetting rank to share their hardships, he does not overturn his stability. Thus, when good counsel and expedient plans are heard, even the foolish delight in them; when the sage’s virtue and lofty conduct are praised, even the unworthy yearn for them. Many delight in such words, yet few employ them; many admire such deeds, yet few practice them. The reason lies in being shackled by things and bound by custom.\n\nIn life, all desire to discern the myriad forms, to stand solitary and noble, to heed teachings of goodness, and to bask in the light of certain strategies. Even the coarse and ignorant—do they lack such aspirations? Yet daily they drift with things, long immersed in custom. Before righteousness prevails, how can it reach them?\n\nThus it is said: \"Practice non-action, and the people transform themselves.\" Follow their actions and act accordingly, and though I do nothing, the people transform themselves. \"I take no action, and the people enrich themselves\"—without the disturbance of taxes and levies, the people naturally prosper. \"I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves\"—without contrived laws and teachings to lure them, the people attain the integrity of their nature. \"I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity\"—without the disruption of passions and cravings, the people preserve the uncarved purity of their nature.\n\nClarity and stillness are the perfection of power; the highest virtue is without virtue, ever clear and still. Gentleness and weakness are the function of the Way, for they can subdue the rigid and violent—this is the Way’s efficacy. Emptiness, tranquility, and contentment are the ancestors of the myriad things, for things arise from nothingness and are nurtured by harmony.\n\nWhen these three are practiced, they merge into formlessness. Though named as three, in essence they are one; yet this one is not a singularity—it may be called formless. Formlessness is the designation of the one, for it lodges the formless within unity. The one, without fixation, harmonizes with all under heaven. Without fixation, it permeates form, yet cannot fully unite with the myriad kinds.\n\nVirtue is ceaselessly bestowed—the one, clothing things to perfect power. Since things are inexhaustible, virtue knows no end. Its use is not toilsome, without labor or rest. It is seen yet unseen—no form is visible. It is heard yet unheard—no sound is audible.\n\nFrom formlessness, forms arise; from soundlessness, the five notes resound; from tastelessness, the five flavors take shape; from colorlessness, the five hues emerge. Thus being arises from non-being, substance from emptiness. The body of the Way is emptiness, yet it gives birth to all forms, sounds, flavors, and colors—none exist without it.\n\nThe number of notes does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five notes are beyond hearing—when gong and zhi form patterns, the ear is confounded. The number of flavors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five flavors are beyond tasting—when sweet and sour harmonize, the palate is refreshed. The number of colors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five colors are beyond viewing—when dark and yellow intermingle, the eye is dazzled.\n\nWhen gong is established, the five notes take shape—gong is the sovereign of sound. When sweetness is established, the five flavors are determined—sweetness is the master of flavor. When white is established, the five colors are complete—white is the root of color. When the one is established, the myriad things are born—the one is the designation of nothingness.\n\nThe multitude or paucity of numbers all arise from the one; the greatness or smallness of things all originate from nothingness. Tracing nothingness, one may grasp the forms of all under heaven. Abiding in the one, one can encompass the root of the myriad names. Thus, when the one is established as the standard, the myriad things are born.\n\nThe principle of the one extends throughout the four seas; the discernment of the one pervades heaven and earth. There is no distance it does not reach, no height or depth it does not illuminate. In its wholeness, it is simple and thick like uncarved wood—complete and undecorated. In its dispersion, it is vast and turbid like muddied water—mingling with things and sharing their dust.\n\nThough turbid, it gradually clarifies; though empty, it gradually fills. Vast and tranquil like great waters, drifting like floating clouds, it seems not to exist yet exists, seems to vanish yet remains. Its form is without substance, its traces gone yet its response present.\n\nLaozi said: \"The sum of the myriad things all passes through one aperture; the root of a hundred affairs all emerges from one gate\"—none do not proceed from it. Thus the sage follows a single standard, unwavering in principle, unchanging in constancy. He follows the tracks of heaven’s Way, not altering his nature with the vicissitudes of affairs. He takes the plumb line as his model, the marking cord as his guide; the crooked conforms to the straight, the straight to the constant.\n\nSince the nature of things is manifold, without abandoning the guiding principles of the Way, he can preserve their integrity in all its curvature. Joy and anger are the Way’s excesses—immoderation is not upright. Sorrow and grief are the loss of power—failure to attain self-mastery. Fondness and aversion are the heart’s transgressions—errors of attachment. Cravings and desires are the burdens of life—excesses in nurturing life.\n\nGreat anger shatters yin; great joy topples yang—yin governs solemnity and decay, yang governs harmony and delight. When these are expressed as joy and anger, they lack restraint. Virtue is ceaselessly bestowed—the one, clothing things to perfect power. Since things are inexhaustible, virtue knows no end. Its use is not toilsome, without labor or rest. It is seen yet unseen—no form is visible. It is heard yet unheard—no sound is audible.\n\nFrom formlessness, forms arise; from soundlessness, the five notes resound; from tastelessness, the five flavors take shape; from colorlessness, the five hues emerge.

      "translated_text": "The essence of the Dao is emptiness and nothingness, yet from it arise all forms, substances, sounds, and colors. The numbers of tones do not exceed five, yet the variations of the five notes are inexhaustible to the ear; when gong and zhi combine into patterns, they confuse the ear. The numbers of flavors do not exceed five, yet the variations of the five tastes are inexhaustible to the palate; when sweet and sour harmonize, they delight the mouth. The numbers of colors do not exceed five, yet the variations of the five hues are inexhaustible to the eye; when dark and yellow intermingle, they dazzle the sight.\n\nIn sound, when gong is established, the five notes take shape—gong is the ruler of tones. In flavor, when sweet is established, the five tastes are determined—sweet is the master of flavors. In color, when white is established, the five colors are completed—white is the root of hues. In the Dao, when the One is established, the myriad things are born. The One is called \"nothingness.\" The multitude or paucity of numbers all arise from the One. The greatness or smallness of things all originate from nothingness. Tracing back to nothingness, one may grasp the forms of all under heaven. Abiding in the One, one can encompass the root of all names. Thus, when the One is established as a term, the myriad things are born.\n\nThe principle of the One extends throughout the four seas; the discernment of the One pervades heaven and earth. There is nowhere it does not reach, no height or depth it does not illuminate. In its wholeness, it is honest and simple as uncarved wood, complete and undecorated. In its dispersion, it is vast and turbid, mingling with things and sharing their dust. Though turbid, it gradually clears; though empty, it gradually fills—this meaning has been shown above. Vast as great waters, drifting like floating clouds, deep and boundless without shore, coming and going without attachment. As if absent yet present, as if perished yet existing—its form is without substance, its traces vanish yet its responses remain.\n\nLaozi said: \"The sum of the myriad things all passes through a single aperture—the Dao is the gateway of generation and transformation. The roots of all affairs emerge from a single gate—none do not proceed from it.\" Thus, the sage follows a single track, not altering what is constant, not changing what is eternal, adhering to the path of heaven’s course without losing constancy amid changing affairs. Setting standards by the plumb line, bending follows the straight, straightness follows the constant. As the natures of things are manifold, without abandoning the Dao’s guiding principles, one can preserve their natures through flexibility.\n\nJoy and anger are the heart of the Dao—excess in them is not upright. Sorrow and grief are the loss of virtue—one cannot attain self-mastery. Likes and dislikes are the transgressions of the heart—errors of attachment. Cravings and desires are the burdens of life—excesses in nurturing life. Great anger shatters yin; great joy topples yang—yin governs solemnity and decay, yang governs harmony and delight. When these are expressed as joy and anger, they lack restraint. When the spirit is profoundly penetrating, it unites with the original true substance. The Dao is inherently possessed by humans, free from even the slightest desire—is this not the perfection of truth? Holding the mysterious virtue in the heart, transformation swiftly flows through the spirit. The transformation of non-action leaves no traces of virtue, hence it is called \"mysterious.\" The true person has no mind, yet things follow—thus their transformation is not swift yet seems to rush.\n\nTherefore, the Dao that cannot be spoken of is vast and boundless. The teaching that cannot be voiced spreads its transformation widely. Issuing commands and decrees to shift customs and mores depends solely on the conduct of the heart. The origin of commands lies in the transformation of virtue. Thus, when mysterious virtue clothes things, there is no need for teaching or decrees, yet customs naturally shift. From this, we know that the mysterious Dao resides in the heart without intention, yet acts.\n\nThe myriad things have their origins, yet only the root is known; all affairs have their sources, yet only the gate is guarded. Stillness can know the root of things; compliance can guard the source of affairs. Thus, one can exhaust the inexhaustible and reach the limitless—for only in clarity and emptiness can one exhaust and reach them. Illuminating things without dazzlement, responding to echoes without cessation—emptiness and stillness can reflect and respond.\n\nLaozi said: \"Those who attain the Dao have weak aspirations yet accomplish strong deeds—their wills, compliant and weak, achieve success through strength. Their hearts are empty yet their responses are fitting—unburdened within, their responses are without error.\" The so-called ultimate weakness is gentle, soft, tranquil, and still. The Dao takes non-change as its aspiration, not the utmost of self-strength. Thus, it is as soft as down, clinging to the body without rising. Concealed in not daring, acting in inability—between action and concealment, there is non-action and no trace. Serene and inactive, movement does not miss its time—action lies in response, so what is lost?\n\nThus, the noble takes the lowly as its root, the high takes the low as its foundation, the small embraces the great—all mean that dwelling in humble weakness and smallness completes the greatness of virtue and power. Being centered controls the external—when the heart attains, things attain. Acting with softness yet strength, power is invincible, and no enemy can overcome it. Responding to transformations and measuring the times, nothing can harm it. Without calculation, it follows the times to respond, so the times do not fail it, and things do not harm it.\n\nThose who desire hardness must guard it with softness; those who desire strength must preserve it with weakness. Accumulating softness becomes hardness; accumulating weakness becomes strength. Observe what is accumulated to know survival or demise—this is the principle and tendency. Hardness conquers what is inferior to itself, yet when it encounters its equal, it is blocked. Softness conquers what surpasses itself—its power is immeasurable. Thus, what it conquers surpasses its equal. Moreover, what hardness conquers is inferior to itself. Now, what softness conquers is its equal—thus, the victory of softness is great, and how can the power of hardness compare?\n\nTherefore, when armies are strong, they perish; when wood is hard, it breaks; when leather is stiff, it splits. Teeth are firmer than the tongue yet perish first. Thus, softness and weakness are the stems of life, while hardness and strength are the companions of death.",

      "translated_text": "Qi finds harmony in softness and weakness, while form suffers illness in hardness and strength—how much more so in the human Dao, where likes and dislikes reveal what is beneficial and harmful. To initiate is the path to exhaustion, while to follow is the source of success. Directing affairs often leads to failure; adapting to things brings constant success.\n\nOne who holds to the Dao to meet change—whether first or last—controls the other. Why? Because they do not lose the means to control others, nor can others control them. Holding to the Dao in its fullness to respond to shifting circumstances allows one to correct oneself through adaptation.\n\nThus, abiding in stillness and perceiving change enables the first to control the last. Observing change and returning to stillness enables the last to control the first. In both, control lies within oneself, no longer swayed by the vulgar. The so-called \"later\" aligns with the numerical order and accords with the moment. Following the inevitable pattern and seizing the opportune time for action is the subtlety of holding back.\n\nThe vicissitudes of time allow no pause—change is the transformation of the hour. Principle admits no interruption; there is no gap between them. To act first is to overreach; to act later is to fall short. To control before things change is to miss the moment. To control after they change is to confront a fait accompli.\n\nThe sun revolves and the moon completes its cycle—time does not linger for man. Thus, the sage does not prize jade disks a foot wide but values an inch of shadow, for time is hard to gain and easy to lose. Only the sage seizes the opportune moment. Therefore, the sage acts in accord with the times and achieves success by relying on available resources. Affairs can thus be fully accomplished, and merit can be steadily established.\n\nAbiding in the Dao of stillness and restraining the feminine principle—guarding the Dao of emptiness and quiet enables discernment of the moment; restraining the feminine and yielding principle enables adaptation to things. Responding to change through compliance, always following and never leading, soft and weak in stillness, composed and settled in tranquility—dwelling in constant virtue with ease. Thus, great merit overcomes all obstacles, and none can contend with it.\n\nPossessing yet appearing empty, things naturally submit. Laozi said: \"A mind that harbors schemes and devices within is not pure and unadulterated.\" To act in response to movement is inexhaustible in application. Emptying oneself of all else, one returns to simplicity. Relying on cunning and skill only disturbs stillness and introduces impurity.\n\nOne whose spiritual power is not complete within cannot embrace what is distant. Only with spiritual wholeness can one reach the ultimate transformation; only with complete virtue can one restore things. The beauty of returning to the distant lies entirely within oneself.\n\nWhen the mind is free of harmful intent, one may grasp the tail of a starving tiger—how much more so with men? Alike yet not identical, avoidance lies in resolve. Now, utterly desireless, one takes the Creator as form. Even the fiercest and most resolute, without provocation, cannot harm.\n\nThus, those who embody the Dao are at ease yet never exhausted; those who rely on calculations labor without success. *Calculations here refer to manipulative techniques.*\n\nTo govern through harsh laws and punishments is not the work of true kingship. Relying on harsh laws to refine punishments only proves that spiritual power is incomplete and insufficient to transform the world. Frequent use of the whip and rod is not the way to guide a chariot to distant lands. Excessive reliance on the whip reveals a loss of natural control, rendering one unable to endure the long journey.\n\nExcessive likes and dislikes invite misfortune to follow. Thus, the laws of the former kings were not of their own making but were based on existing conditions. They adapted to the times, adding or subtracting to implement teachings—not creating laws to flaunt their ability. Their prohibitions and punishments were not self-imposed but were upheld. They maintained prohibitions to instill fear in the people, not to display their authority.\n\nThus, adaptation leads to greatness, while contrivance leads to pettiness. Steadfastness ensures stability, while forced action leads to failure. Those who rely on ears and eyes to listen and see exhaust their minds without clarity. Those who govern through cunning and planning wear themselves out without success.\n\nWhen a ruler illuminates the four directions and comprehends the four corners, perfect governance is achieved with ease. Relying on the talent of a single person is insufficient for good governance—for even one person’s ability cannot manage a three-acre homestead. Strength and wisdom extend no further.",

Now, what softness conquers is its equal—thus, the victory of softness is great, and how can the power of hardness compare?\n\nTherefore, when armies are strong, they perish; when wood is hard, it breaks; when leather is stiff, it splits. Teeth are firmer than the tongue yet perish first. Thus, softness and weakness are the stems of life, while hardness and strength are the companions of death.",

      "translated_text": "Following the natural patterns of the Dao and aligning with the inherent nature of heaven and earth, even the six directions cannot be made equal. Moreover, harmonizing with the essence of things and their inherent principles is the inevitable course. Thus, though the world be vast, without exhausting wisdom or strength, the myriad transformations naturally attain balance.\n\nHe who trusts his ears will falter in hearing; he who trusts his eyes will be dazzled by sight. Praise and blame mislead the ear, while dazzling colors seduce the eye. Ritual propriety is insufficient to manifest love, but sincerity of heart can embrace what is distant. Those who scrutinize ritual merely refine its forms; the heart that seeks to love may yet fail to achieve it. Only by extending sincerity throughout the world can one evoke a response.\n\nThus, in warfare, nothing is more perilous than the will sharpened like a sword—such resolve disrupts harmony and poisons the art of war. No enemy is greater than yin and yang, yet the war drum is but a trifle. When joy and anger assail one another, the enemy is at its most severe. The so-called great enemy leaves corpses uncounted, its unchecked commands harming the people. The middle enemy lurks in the mountains, seizing advantage from hidden strongholds. The petty enemy hides among the people, engaging in stealth and theft.\n\nThus it is said: when the people abound in cunning, strange artifices proliferate. Excessive cleverness breeds skill, and skill breeds pride in ability. Carving and adorning the unadorned, they deceive the world with falsity. The more laws and decrees are promulgated, the more thieves and bandits arise. Seeking to halt theft by cutting off profit, even with a profusion of strict laws, only leads to theft of the laws themselves, increasing the number of offenders. Abandon one path and take another, and heavenly calamity will not arise. Forsake the laws of cunning and cleverness, embrace the uncarved simplicity of non-action, and the reproaches of heaven will cease.\n\nThus, to govern the state with cleverness is to plunder it; relying solely on one’s own wisdom is to harm the people. To govern the state without cleverness is to bestow virtue upon it. Governing by following the natural course, all things attain their true nature.\n\nThe formless is vast, the formed is small; spiritual transformation is boundless and thus great, while the myriad things have limits and thus are small. The formless is many, the formed is few; the unfathomable is many, the visible is few. The formless is strong, the formed is weak; it masters things and thus is strong, while things are mastered and thus are weak. The formless is real, the formed is hollow; the enduring is real, the transient is hollow.\n\nThe formed brings things to completion, the formless initiates them. Completion produces vessels, initiation produces the uncarved. The formed has sound, the formless has none. When scattered into vessels, names arise. Returning to the Dao, names cannot be found. The formed arises from the formless, thus the formless is the origin of the formed.\n\nBreadth and thickness bear names, and what bears a name is esteemed and valued. Frugality and thinness are nameless, and the nameless is base and light. Breadth and thickness are the world’s fine reputation. Frugality and thinness are the Daoist’s pure virtue. What the world values is elevated by its name; what I relinquish is entrusted to its reality. The sage holds to the Dao in humility and frugality, making these the foundation of breadth and thickness. Embracing virtue without wavering, he returns to the root of merit and fame.\n\nThe following lines are of the same import: abundance and wealth bear names, and what bears a name is honored and cherished. Poverty and scarcity are nameless, and the nameless is lowly and despised. The male and potent bear names, and what bears a name is manifest and illustrious. The female and yielding are nameless, and the nameless is subtle and restrained. Surplus bears a name, and what bears a name is exalted and wise. Deficiency is nameless, and the nameless is content with lowliness. Merit bears a name, lack of merit is nameless.\n\nBreadth, thickness, abundance, and wealth are the fruits of having. Frugality, thinness, poverty, and scarcity are the fruits of not having. Names arise from visible traces; where traces are faint, names do not reach. Thus the world esteems merit as fine, while the Dao values the nameless as virtue. The named arises from the nameless; the nameless is the mother of the named. Dwelling in the namelessness of frugality and scarcity, one attains the fullness of honor and nobility.\n\nThe Way of heaven is such that being and non-being give rise to one another, and difficulty and ease complete one another. Form and nature arise from the interplay of being and non-being; the principles of affairs arise from the interplay of difficulty and ease. Not knowing how this is so is called the Way of heaven. Therefore, the sage holds to the Dao in emptiness, stillness, subtlety, and mystery, thereby perfecting virtue. To hold to the nameless Dao is to achieve great virtue.\n\nThus, with the Dao comes virtue, with virtue comes merit, with merit comes fame, and with fame one returns to the Dao. Forgetting the fame of saving the world, one reverts to the non-action of the Dao. With enduring merit and fame, one remains free from blame throughout life. The merit of no-merit endures; the fame of forgotten fame—what blame could there be?\n\nKings and dukes possess merit and fame, while the orphaned and widowed have none. Thus the sage calls himself orphaned and widowed, returning to his root. All great achievements and illustrious reputations arise from humility. Therefore, the orphaned and widowed are the titles of kings and dukes, for humility is their foundation.\n\nAchieving merit without claiming it, one uses merit for benefit and the nameless for application. The merit of aiding the world borrows the lives of the multitude for benefit; the nameless Dao entrusts its application to the great. In ancient times, the people were simple and unknowing, unaware of east or west. They were utterly unadorned. Their appearance did not depart from their true nature; form and spirit were united. Words did not outstrip deeds; speech and action were one. Their gait was unadorned, free of affectation. Their speech was plain, unembellished. Their clothes provided warmth without ornament, serving only to ward off the cold. Their weapons were blunt and edgeless, for they knew not the art of cunning harm.\n\nThey walked with carefree abandon, their gaze unfocused and wandering. They drank from wells and ate from the fields they tilled, seeking nothing beyond their immediate needs. They neither gave nor sought, each content with sufficiency. High and low did not vie with one another, long and short did not compare. They harbored no thoughts of right or wrong.",

      "translated_text": "The winds align with customs, and so one may follow them—when customs are uniform, they may be followed. Affairs match abilities, and so they are easily done—when undertakings suit one’s capacity, they are easily accomplished. To pride oneself on deceit to delude the world, or to act with obstinacy to mislead the multitude—these the sage does not take as the people’s customs.\n\nFor if a ruler exalts false appearances to disorder governance and teaching, or persists in perverse conduct to confuse the masses, then customs will diverge and fail to unify, and affairs will not align with ability. Thus, the sage does not employ such means as the foundation of governance.\n\n*Comprehensive Mystery Scripture, Scroll One (end)*\n*Comprehensive Mystery Scripture, Scroll Two*\n*Annotated by Zhu Bian, Probationary Gentleman for Manifest Propriety, Acting Secretary of the Court of Judicial Review, and Magistrate of Jinyun County in Kuozhou*\n\n**Essay on Refined Sincerity**\n\nRefinement begins with investigating the subtlest truths; sincerity is the perfection of simplicity and utmost clarity. When these two names are fulfilled, one may move all things and penetrate the Dao.\n\nLaozi said: Heaven attains its height, earth attains its depth, the sun and moon shine, the stars and constellations gleam, yin and yang harmonize—not through any deliberate action. This is the response of utmost refinement, yet one knows not how it comes to be, as though a true master were present.\n\nAlign with the Dao, and things are naturally so. All things possess their own inherent Dao; if one can accord with them without transgression, then things attain their nature and govern themselves. Yin and yang, the four seasons—they do not generate the myriad things. Rain and dew fall in their time—not to nurture grasses and trees. Heaven’s constant virtue and things’ regular growth arise without knowledge of their source; each simply grows of itself.\n\nWhen spirit connects and yin-yang harmonizes, the myriad things are born. When spirits interact, mechanisms respond; when qi converges, forms arise. To fathom their origin, refined sincerity may be discerned.\n\nThe Dao conceals essence within, for the sake of ending frivolous song. It lodges spirit in the heart, for the sake of shedding encumbrances. Serene and tranquil, it delights and unites within the breast, harmonious yet without attachment. Vast and formless, silent and soundless.\n\nThose who embody the Dao enact transformations without trace and teachings without words. Offices and courts seem devoid of affairs; courts and halls seem devoid of people. Each governs itself, so there are no affairs; non-action prevails, so there are no people. No recluses, no idle folk—when governance accords with the Dao, where would they hide or stray? No forced labor, no unjust punishments—with non-action and impartiality, how could there be grievances or toil?\n\nThe world looks up to the ruler’s virtue, emulating the sovereign’s intent. When the sage presides above, all under heaven submit to his purity and stillness, mirroring his desireless aim. Distant lands and alien customs, none fail to come through repeated translation—not because he visits each household or meets each person, but because virtue, through compliance, transforms all, near and far.\n\nExtend one’s sincere heart to the world, and that is all. When the heart is sincere, things respond. If a ruler extends sincerity, nothing fails to answer. Thus, rewarding the good and punishing the violent are policies, but what enables their execution is refined sincerity. When trustworthiness and integrity are firmly established, policies will be carried out; when rewards and punishments are impartial, the people know encouragement.\n\nThough commands may be clear, they cannot act alone; they must await refined sincerity. Therefore, to unite the Dao and bestow it upon the people yet fail to be followed is because refined sincerity is not all-encompassing. That which is refined must be excellent; that which is sincere must respond.\n\nLaozi said: Heaven sets the sun and moon, arrays the stars and constellations, unfolds the four seasons, and regulates yin and yang. The three luminaries and four qi never depend on one another; observing their spontaneity, each transforms alone. The sun dries things by day, the night lets them rest, the wind desiccates them, rain and dew moisten them.\n\nIn generating things, none see how they are nourished, yet the myriad things grow—things receive life and grow of themselves, without any nourisher. In destroying things, none see how they perish, yet the myriad things die—things observe their own transformations, without any destroyer. This is called spirit and illumination. That which cannot be fathomed in its origin is called spirit; that which inevitably changes is called illumination.\n\nThus, the sage models himself on this. When fortune arises, one does not see its cause, yet fortune arises—the world’s blessings lie in the sage’s Dao being practiced. When virtue aligns with the times, how can there be traces? When misfortune is removed, one does not see its source, yet misfortune is removed—preserving the fortune of the Dao’s practice, there may be adversity, but when sagely governance nurtures order, nothing can be perceived.\n\nScrutiny finds no origin of removal or rise; investigation confirms the reality of fortune and misfortune. Daily reckoning falls short; yearly reckoning yields surplus. Measuring progress day by day, it seems insufficient; yet in the end, affairs are completed, as virtue is perfected over time. Silent and soundless—only subtle resonance remains.",

      "translated_text": "A single word that profoundly moves all under heaven—this is called utmost sincerity, by which the heart of heaven is stirred to transform. Without intent, it yet elicits response. Sincerity takes form within qi, moving heaven: auspicious stars appear, yellow dragons descend, phoenixes arrive, sweet springs flow, fine grains grow, rivers do not overflow, and seas remain calm without surging waves. When sincerity reaches luminous clarity, such correspondences arise.\n\nTo defy heaven and ravage the world is to invite the sun and moon’s obscuration, the five planets’ errant paths, the four seasons’ disorder—this is called qi exceeding its proper measure. Day darkens while night shines, mountains collapse and rivers run dry, winter thunders and summer frosts—when qi steams upward in excess, such portents occur. Heaven and humanity share a means of mutual resonance; disasters and auspices arise from what is thus evoked.\n\nThus, when a state declines toward ruin, celestial patterns shift, the age falls into chaos, and rainbows appear—all things are interconnected, and essence-qi presses closely upon one another. The entanglement of forms, the encroachment of qi—all are signs of lost alignment. Therefore, the workings of spirit and illumination cannot be achieved through cunning or force, nor can they be attained by sheer effort. Only through perfect sincerity and utmost truth may governance be established.\n\nThus, the great person harmonizes virtue with heaven and earth, luminosity with the sun and moon, numinous power with ghosts and spirits, and trustworthiness with the four seasons. Embracing the heart of heaven, they harbor no private intent; holding the qi of earth, they follow tranquility as their nature. Grasping the central void and embracing harmony, they wield the central void to settle all affairs and contain harmony to govern the myriad beings.

      "translated_text": "The transformation of customs and the people’s shift toward goodness arise as if naturally—this is the power of spiritual transformation. Governance lies within oneself; without spiritual transformation, who else could be entrusted with it?\n\nLaozi said: \"For the human Way, to preserve one’s nature and safeguard authenticity, never harming the self—this is the constant Dao of humanity. When pressed by urgency or adversity, essence penetrates heaven.\" The supreme mystery’s mirror is impartial and luminous. Utmost sincerity moves it, and there is nothing it does not respond to—thus in conflict or distress, none fail to be resolved through sincerity. Though not yet fully aligned with spontaneity, this is still a momentary attainment. As for those who never depart from their root—what could they not accomplish? To take essence and sincerity as one’s root is to leave nothing unachieved.\n\nDeath and life share the same realm; they cannot be coerced or overborne. One who equalizes life and death cannot be threatened by death. How much more so for those who govern heaven and earth, embrace the myriad beings, reverse creation, and contain utmost harmony—have they ever truly died? Knowing that death and life occupy the same domain, one does not lightly fear; how much less so for those who embody the Dao, encompassing heaven and earth, merging with transformation and harmony, becoming one with the Creator—could they not attain undying longevity?\n\nEssence and sincerity take form within, and their resonance reaches the hearts of others—this is the untransmitted Dao. When essence and sincerity are inwardly manifest and outwardly align with human hearts, this arises from the deepest sincerity, far beyond what words can convey. When the sage occupies the throne, dwelling in the Dao without speech, their beneficence extends to the myriad people—thus the teaching without words is vast indeed.\n\nWhen the center is empty, things follow; when the body is upright, the people emulate. Is not the transformation of daily life equally vast? When ruler and minister diverge in heart, deceit and treachery appear in heaven, and the resonance of spirit and qi grows faint. The ruler embodies the Way of governance and transformation, while the minister carries it to completion—gains and losses are shared, fortunes and misfortunes move as one. Yet if discordant hearts breed cunning, causing perverse qi to rise and steam upward, then the Way of spiritual transformation will find no resonance. This is what is meant by \"the eloquence of silence\" and \"the Dao that cannot be spoken.\"\n\nThe former refers to the teaching without words, the latter to the Dao beyond speech. To summon the distant, let there be non-action; for those nearby, let there be no affairs. When governance and instruction multiply, taxes and labor grow burdensome—then those close at hand cannot attend to their tasks, and those far away cannot hold their duties in mind. Thus the Way of heaven is non-action, responding without call; the sage is without affairs, drawing near without seeking.",

      "translated_text": "Only the night-walker may possess it—silently employing it in accord with yin, its virtue nears the Dao most closely. Thus the turning back of galloping steeds to manure the fields: the reckless rush of desires is likewise called \"galloping steeds\"; manure, then, can fatten and nourish the sprouting shoots. Therefore the enlightened ruler outwardly turns back the gallop of warhorses to enrich the fields and gardens, and inwardly removes the rushing torrent of desires to cultivate virtue and the Dao. When no chariot tracks reach beyond distant lands, this is called \"sitting still while racing, sinking while afloat.\" With hands folded and seated in governance, transformation spreads to far-off lands—silently acting without trace is to dwell on land yet sink as if submerged.\n\nThe Way of heaven approaches without partiality, departs without partiality; without favor or bias, it does not involve itself in coming or going. The capable have abundance, the clumsy fall short; those who follow it gain advantage, those who oppose it meet misfortune. Those who accord with the principles of nature act with surplus benefit; those who rely on the surface of cunning and calculation find themselves powerless and doomed. Thus those who govern by wisdom struggle to maintain the state; only those who align with the Great Harmony and hold to natural response can truly possess it. When the heart of heaven’s Way accords with the seasons and principles, this is called the Great Harmony.\n\nIf the ruler severs cleverness and artifice to align with harmony, and holds to impartiality in responding to things, then he may be entrusted with safeguarding the world. Laozi said: The Dao and virtue are like rawhide and tanned leather—distance makes them seem near, nearness makes them seem distant; examined, they cannot be grasped; scrutinized, they do not deceive. The Dao and virtue lodge their use in being and non-being; rawhide and leather manifest their sound in emptiness and solidity. They respond when moved, yet when sought, they have no fixed form. Truly, they are beyond the measure of the heart and mind—how much more beyond the reach of ears and eyes?\n\nThus the sage is like a mirror: neither leading nor welcoming, responding yet not storing, leaving the myriad things unharmed. Impartial, he entrusts things to their own nature, and transformation comes to meet him. By following and responding to them, he remains unharmed. What he gains is thus what he loses—if he clings to what he has gained in his breast, he loses its wondrous use. What he loses is thus what he gains—only in utter emptiness can reflection occur.\n\nTherefore, one who penetrates the Great Harmony is darkly serene as if steeped in pure wine, sweetly drifting within it, as if never having left its source—this is called the Great Permeation. The sweet intoxication of rich wine still preserves the portion of perfect peace and rest; in profound accord with inner and outer, it harmonizes with the unity of heaven and earth. If one releases the heart into the realm of self-attained origin, roams the spirit in the boundless expanse, though traces mingle with things, what hindrance remains? This is the feigned disuse that accomplishes its use. The world deems emotion and cleverness as disuse, yet here, this feigned disuse pairs with the uses of a thousand transformations.\n\nLaozi said: In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor’s governance of the world harmonized the movements of the sun and moon, regulated the qi of yin and yang, ordered the measures of the four seasons, corrected the calculations of pitch pipes and calendars, distinguished male and female, and clarified superior and inferior—these were the creations of ritual and law. In the age of the Yellow Emperor, the people had lost their true simplicity, and artifice and deceit arose; cunning and force came to the fore. Thus he looked up to observe and bent down to examine, governing through change and non-action. Though this truly benefited his time, none foresaw the troubles of ten thousand generations.\n\nHe ensured the strong did not overpower the weak, the many did not oppress the few; the people preserved their lives without premature death, the seasons ripened without famine. The hundred officials were upright and impartial, superiors and inferiors harmonized without blame; laws and commands were clear and not obscured, aides were just and not sycophantic. Farmers yielded boundaries, roads left no lost items, markets had no fraudulent pricing—thus the achievements of his governance were manifest. At that time, the sun, moon, and stars did not stray from their courses; wind and rain came in season; the five grains flourished; phoenixes soared in the courtyards, and qilin roamed the outskirts—such were the responses of virtue in action.\n\nWhen Fuxi ruled the world, he rested his head on a square pillow and slept on a straight mat, emulating autumn’s harvest and winter’s storage. The dark sage’s actions did not transgress heaven’s net, so his bedding was square and straight. Autumn’s things reach maturity, winter’s things lie hidden—this is returning to the root. Thus the sage followed the reaping of these two seasons, restraining and completing filial piety, embodying the virtue of returning to the root. Bearing the square earth, embracing the round heaven, the Dao encompasses heaven and earth.",

      "translated_text": "The yin and yang they embrace. Where there is obstruction and blockage, the apertures and principles regulate it. When virtue harmonizes with the Great Harmony, qi governs itself. Those who oppose qi and violate things, harming the people through excessive accumulation—cut them off. Once heaven and earth are at peace, disasters vanish of themselves.\n\nAt that time, the people were like unknowing children, unaware of east or west, walking unsteadily, seeing dimly, yet content in their simplicity, not knowing whence they came—this has already been seen in the *Dao Yuan* chapter. Floating and drifting, they knew not their origin; without nurture, they knew not their destination. Not yet cherishing their kin, they took things as their root. Since things were but temporary lodgings, their root had nowhere to go. Those who floated without nurture were all unbound and unmoored.\n\nIn that age, birds and beasts, insects and snakes—none failed to sheathe their claws and fangs, conceal their stings and poisons, for they knew not how to prey upon one another. Their merit measured up to heaven and earth. The merit of non-action was thus comparable to heaven and earth.\n\nYet the Yellow Emperor humbled himself beneath the Great Ancestor, though his deeds went unproclaimed, his name unheralded. Not proclaiming his deeds, his deeds were already proclaimed; not heralding his name, his name was already heralded. When the Yellow Emperor vanquished Chiyou on the fields of Zhuolu, though he removed a scourge, he returned to the Great Ancestor, and his traces of reverence and deference were already manifest for posterity. \"Humbled,\" here, denotes a modest and unassuming demeanor.\n\nHe concealed the Way of the True Man, following the inherent order of heaven and earth—heaven’s exaltation, earth’s humility, spring’s generation, autumn’s harvest—these are the natural principles. Yet the Yellow Emperor modeled himself on this exaltation and humility to establish robes and garments, measured the seasons to carry out punishments and campaigns, thereby illuminating the Way of the True Man while obscuring the virtue of the sage, daily renewing himself in the world. Why? Because when the Dao and virtue ascend, cunning and knowledge naturally fade away. If one’s virtue aligns with heaven, then the artifices of wisdom and skill become discarded things.\n\nLaozi said: \"If heaven is unsettled, the sun and moon have nothing to bear them; if earth is unsettled, grasses and trees have nowhere to stand. If the self is not at peace, right and wrong have no form.\" Only when the self is tranquil can it be upright—such is the principle of right and wrong.\n\nThus, only with the True Man does true knowledge arise—casting aside the deluded knowledge of the world to perceive true knowledge. If what one holds is not clear, how can one know that what I call knowledge is not ignorance? To employ the deluded knowledge of the world to clarify true knowledge is difficult indeed.\n\nWhat is called true knowledge is knowledge without right or wrong. How then can the world’s knowledge of right and wrong be true knowledge? It is not true knowledge.\n\nAccumulating wisdom and valuing wealth, making the people joyful and delighting in their lives—this is benevolence. Frugality leads to valuing wealth; abundant grace leads to accumulating kindness. Establishing great deeds, displaying illustrious names, ordering lord and subject, rectifying high and low, clarifying near and far, preserving those in peril, continuing severed lineages, and establishing heirs for the childless—this is righteousness. All these are裁断 to fit what is appropriate.\n\nClosing the nine apertures, concealing the will and intent, discarding cleverness and intelligence, returning to non-discernment—such is the principle of fully preserving life and safeguarding one’s nature. Vague and drifting beyond the dust and grime, carefree in the work of non-action—vague and unknowing, beyond fame and profit, adapting to circumstances, neither gain nor loss able to burden one—this is the bearing of one who inhales yin and exhales yang, merging with the ten thousand things in profound unity. Following the great constancy of yin and yang, harmonizing with the nature of things—this is virtue.\n\nThus, the Dao disperses and becomes virtue; virtue overflows and becomes benevolence and righteousness. \"Overflows\" means to lose. Benevolence and righteousness are established, and the Dao and virtue are abandoned. For to depart from true simplicity and cause things to attain the Dao’s dispersion into virtue is the meaning of this.\n\nTherefore, when emerging from the natural, one attains the position of the Supreme. When virtue is about to be established, the traces upon which it depends become manifest. Once manifest, to preserve them without overflow is impossible. Thus, excess arises from benevolence and righteousness.\n\nTo govern things through benevolence and righteousness is to hang the teachings of allurement and admiration prominently in the world, while the virtue of attaining the natural Dao suffers no loss. Is this not a deficiency?\n\nLaozi said: \"When the spirit scatters, words become flowery; when virtue drifts, conduct becomes false.\" The spirit serves to reflect things, virtue to perfect conduct. Thus, when the spirit is scattered and fleeting, words lose their substance; when virtue flows and drifts, conduct loses its truth.\n\nWhen the utmost essence is lost within, yet words and deeds are observed without, this is inevitably to be enslaved by things. Once scattered and drifting, the inner self lacks sincerity, and one observes external things, uttering words and forming deeds. In this way, one is enslaved by things and cannot preserve oneself.\n\nHe also said: \"When there is no sincerity within, yet words and deeds occupy the realm of observation, this deludes and deceives the people, causing them to follow unprincipled governance and imitate expedient laws. The worthy, through excessive caution, withdraw from the world; the foolish, through daily practice, make it their nature. Thus, those in positions of power are not steadfast and are enslaved by things.\"\n\nWhen essence is exhausted and consumed while conduct knows no limit, what one holds is unstable, and one is led astray by the winds of worldly custom. \"Consumed\" means depleted. Enslaved by things, there comes a time of exhaustion. Yet when all standards are enacted, how can there be a limit? Responding to every kind of conduct with incomplete essence, with an inherently unstable foundation, how can one avoid being led astray by custom?\n\nThus, the sage inwardly cultivates the arts of the Dao and does not outwardly adorn himself with benevolence and righteousness. Knowing the proper use of the nine apertures and four limbs, he wanders in the harmony of spirit—this is the sage’s wandering. One who embodies the Dao to perfect the mind’s expansion will find the merits of benevolence and righteousness naturally manifest without. One who preserves essence and encounters with spirit will find the proper order of the body naturally at peace within. Yet if a single thing is obstructed, it cannot be called wandering. Now, with both inner and outer in accord, is this not the sage’s wandering?\n\nLaozi said: \"As for the True Man’s wandering, it moves in the utmost emptiness, unaware of any obstruction.\"",

humble chamber,\nwhile the hundred clans transform themselves.\nHow could the mediocre masses of the world value his wordless Way?\n\nThus, \"The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao;\nthe name that can be named is not the constant name.\"\nThe Dao that can be made into an object is not the constant Dao of spontaneity;\nthe name that can be assigned is not the constant name of quiescent

manifestations.\nMerits and fame recorded on bamboo and silk,\nlaws and canons carved into metal and stone,\nare all traces of achievement,\nnot the Dao of non-action.\nWeighed and debated, they are indeed coarse.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, and Three Kings\npursued different affairs with the same heart,\ntook different paths to the same end.\nTheir hearts shared the same aim of bringing order,\nthough their policies and transformations differed.\nScholars of later ages,\nnot grasping the unity embodied in the Dao\nor the essentials that virtue gathers,\ntake the traces of past deeds,\nkneel and sit to expound them—\nteaching their traces alone fails to encompass all things,\nmerely revering their leftover words.\nEven with broad learning and much knowledge,\nthey cannot avoid disorder.\nThose who hear much of rites and righteousness\nare apt to confuse their times,\nfor these are not the essentials of good governance.\n\nLaozi said:\n\"The essence of the heart

without leaving his seat,\nhis influence surpassing the cries of an owl or the shouts of a herald.\nRelying on the power of pure sincerity,\nhis transformation is like an echo.\nThus, the world is rightly ordered.\n\nWords that are alike may be trusted,\nbut trust lies before the words.\nWhen one among many speakers is uniquely trusted,\nit is because his sincerity and trustworthiness were already manifest.\nCommands that are alike may be carried out,\nbut sincerity lies beyond the command.\nWhen one among many issuances is uniquely obeyed,\nit is because his sincerity aligns with the command,\nand the people all follow.\nWhen the sage is above,\nthe people are transformed as if by a spirit—\nhis feelings precede them.\nSince his trust lies before his words\nand his sincerity beyond his commands,\nhis transformation is swift as a spirit.\n\nWhen the ruler acts above but the people do not respond below,\nit is because their feelings and commands diverge.\n\"Feeling\" is akin to sincerity.\nA three-month-old infant knows nothing of benefit or harm,\nyet its loving mother cherishes it all the more—\nthis is feeling.\nHow could the infant understand the advantages of

the Dao\nelicits its external effects.\nThe worthy are called *junzi*,\nthe sages are called *shengren*—\nthis shared phrasing means:\nthe sage embraces the *junzi*’s abilities,\nwhile the *junzi* unfolds the sage’s transformation.\n\nLaozi said:\n\"When a son dies for his father,\nor a minister for his lord,\nit is not to seek fame through death—\nthe heart’s devotion is hidden within,\nand they do not shirk from peril.\"\nHow could ministers and sons\nangle for the reputation of loyalty and filial piety\nto face their lord’s or father’s peril?\nYet when gratitude and righteousness stir within,\nthey naturally forget life and follow duty.\n\nThe *junzi*’s sorrow for the world\nis not a deliberate act—\nit arises from within,\nand one must examine his conduct.\nThe *junzi* cherishes benevolence,\ngrieving for the age—\nnot arbitrarily upholding it,\nbut letting it emerge from within.\nYet if he does not observe the customs of the time\nand teach accordingly,\nhe will fail in governance.\n\nThe sage walking at night feels no shame before his shadow—\nthus the *junzi* is cautious in solitude.\nThe sage is without partiality,\nthe *junzi* holds office.\nThough dwelling in darkness,\nhe never trembles in fear,\nnor betrays things—\nhow could he feel shame before his shadow?\n\nTo abandon what is near and seek what is distant is obstruction.\nTo forsake self-attainment

      "translated_text": "The form refers to bearing, the essence to emotion. The Way of these two transformations may be connected through kindred forms, yet cannot be suspended and expected to manifest on its own. If this is so, then there is something awaited within—how can essence remain pure or form be upright? There has never been one whose form was upright yet failed to move and transform things.\n\nLaozi said: Words have their root, affairs have their foundation. Words have the root of established teachings, affairs have the foundation of creation. Lose their root and foundation, and though one’s skills be many, it is better to speak little. Once root and foundation are lost, proliferation becomes harm, and one cannot even preserve stillness. Those who harm the many are like Yu the craftsman cutting off his finger to show that great skill cannot be forced. The skill of Ban and Fei is contrived—when there is action, fame is established but fingers are severed. The skill of creation is non-action, thus its use is fulfilled and its body remains whole.\n\nThus, the craftsman knows how to close, yet by closing at the right time does not know closure—hence he must block it before opening. Following transformation, succeeding with the times, relying on knowledge and skill will inevitably lead to ruin.\n\nLaozi said: The sage’s undertakings take different paths yet reach the same end; affairs differ in what they follow, but transformation shares the same destination. Their survival or ruin, stability or collapse, all stem from an unwavering intent to benefit others. Amid these four differences, they do not forget the forgetting of benefiting others.\n\nThus, the songs of Qin, Chu, Yan, and Wei differ in transmission yet all bring joy; the laments of the Nine Yi and Eight Di differ in sound yet all express sorrow. Sorrow and joy reside within—no foreign custom can alter them. Song is the sign of joy, weeping the effect of sorrow. Essence within responds without, thus wherever one is, it moves others. Song and weeping are the proof of gain and loss.\n\nThe Way of governance and transformation: when life is followed, all rejoice; when nature is suppressed, all grieve. The cause of the myriad things’ resentment or harmony lies entirely in what the ruler above moves. The sage’s heart never forgets its desire to benefit others—how far-reaching is the reach of his grace! Thus, Hua and Yi are all transformed.\n\nLaozi said: When people practice non-action, governance is achieved; when nature is still, peace is attained. Those who act harm the governance of non-action, adding knowledge to affairs and thus injuring the original nature. Those who would practice non-action cannot be without action. Where there is intent to preserve, there is action. Those who cannot be without action cannot truly act. Having lost their own still nature, how can they govern things?\n\nPeople are wordless and spirit is present—spirit is the essence of vitality. Only in emptiness and quiescence is its full function realized. When there are words, they injure the spirit of wordlessness, for words analyze things and principles, binding them and thus causing harm. To bear wordlessness is to injure the spirit of spirit. Preserving wordlessness in the heart is the heart’s inability to be empty. With this obstruction, the spirit is inevitably harmed.\n\nWenzi said: Names can be forcibly established, achievements can be forcibly accomplished. Formerly, Nanrong Chou was ashamed that the sagely Way alone was absent in himself. He traveled south to see Laozi and received a single word of teaching. His spirit became clear and bright, his difficulties and distresses smoothed and resolved. Through diligent effort, he went ten days without eating, yet felt as if feasting on a grand sacrifice—tasting the Way and being sated with virtue. Thus, his brilliance illuminated the world, his name endured for generations, his wisdom and strategy encompassed heaven and earth, his discernment reached the finest detail. His praises in the language of Hua continue unceasing to this day—this is what is meant by names being forcibly established. The full account is in the *Kangcangzi*.\n\nThus, the farmer who does not strive will not fill his granary; the official who does not exert himself will not refine his sincerity; the general and minister who do not strive will not accomplish great deeds; the king and marquis who are indolent will leave no name after death. The profound purport of this chapter takes essence and sincerity as its root. Wenzi feared that世 people would merely wish to preserve sincerity while forgetting strenuous study, hence he set forth these examples to illustrate sincerity.\n\nThe perfected person moves in concealment, like thunder hiding beneath the earth—his traces unseen. Acting in accord with the times, establishing merit through available means, advancing and retreating without difficulty, he is unobstructed in all things. Adapting to temporal change, harmonizing with the principles of things.\n\nThe perfected person’s essence and sincerity take inner form, his virtue flows to the four quarters. Seeing benefit in the world, he rejoices yet does not forget; seeing harm in the world, he is startled as if having suffered a loss. His nature and principle are profoundly united, thus he has neither gain nor loss. His form follows things, hence his sorrow and joy are as they are.\n\nOne who grieves the people’s grief is grieved by the people; one who rejoices in the people’s joy is rejoiced by the people. With my sameness to things, things do not differ from me. Thus, to rejoice with all under heaven and grieve with all under heaven—yet fail to become king—has never been.\n\nOnly one who is without intent and merges with all under heaven can be the pen for all under heaven. The perfected person’s method begins where it cannot be seen and ends where it cannot be reached. Moved by inner sincerity, thus its beginning cannot be seen; cutting off its old traces, thus its end cannot be attained.\n\nAbiding in an unshakable position, taking tranquility and stillness as foundation. Accumulating in an inexhaustible storehouse, taking profound virtue as root. Bearing in an unfailing treasury, taking self-sufficiency as resource. Issuing commands like the source of flowing water, benefiting things while ever following. Employing the people in offices of non-contention, governing with emptiness and softness. Opening the gate that must be attained, proceeding from ease and thus not losing. Not doing what cannot be accomplished, not altering the materials of things to act. Not seeking what cannot be obtained, not aspiring to what lies beyond one’s lot. Not dwelling where one cannot remain long, departing from arrogance and excess. Not acting in ways that cannot be repeated, leaving behind attachment to complexity.\n\nThe great person enacts a government that brings joy—none do not follow his commands. When commands follow the times, they proceed from small to great; when commands run counter, even good becomes harm, success becomes failure. The great person’s governance is simple—none do not rejoice and be transformed. Principle naturally flourishes, while the governance of vexatious severity is the opposite of what is fitting.",

      "translated_text": "Judge of the Court of Judicial Review, Probationary Officer of the Supreme Court of Law, and Magistrate of Jinyun County in Kuozhou, Zhu Jingzhengyi’s Annotations on the *Nine Guardings*\n\nThe *guarding* lies in unifying the will, while the *nine* encompasses the utmost in numerical perfection. Thus, nothing lies beyond its domain, and no affair fails to reach completion. This section, from *Guarding Simplicity* to *Guarding Emptiness*, comprises ten chapters. Each bears the word *guarding* in its title, save one, which conceals it. The number nine is embedded within the text, and though we now speak of the *Nine Guardings*, this refers to the application of the principle of nine.\n\nLaozi said: Before heaven and earth took form, all was dark and indistinct, merged as one—undifferentiated primordial qi. Silent and limpid, the heavy and turbid settled to become earth, while the pure and subtle rose to form heaven. When utmost clarity prevailed, the distinction of light and heavy naturally arose. From this arose the four seasons, and from division emerged yin and yang. Qi, stagnant or restless, gave birth to yin and yang; cycles, with their beginnings and ends, produced the four seasons. Refined qi became humans, while coarse qi became creatures. Thus, humans earned the name of the most numinous, while creatures fell among the multitude. Hardness and softness complement each other, and the myriad things are born. Hardness is the nature of yang; softness, the substance of yin. When these two qi interact and converge, life is sustained.\n\nThe spirit originates from heaven, endowed with lightness and clarity to flow freely. The bones and flesh take root in earth, endowed with weight and turbidity to remain grounded. When the spirit enters its gate, the bones and flesh return to their root—what then remains of me? For life and transformation are the constant principles of heaven. In birth, one suddenly becomes form and spirit; in transformation, one silently returns to the root. Coming is not what we esteem, nor is going within our control—so on what basis can the notion of \"I\" stand? The gate is the path of return and transformation.\n\nThus, the sage models himself on heaven and follows earth, unbound by custom or swayed by others. He dares not cling to the \"I,\" but instead aligns with nature’s spontaneity. He takes heaven as father and earth as mother, revering the ultimate of spirit and form, and emulating the virtue of their encompassing embrace. Yin and yang serve as the warp, the four seasons as the weft. Without holding to these as the guiding principles, one cannot harmonize with the great order.\n\nHeaven is tranquil and clear; earth is settled and serene. All things that oppose them perish, while those that follow them live. If even heaven and earth rely on stillness to perfect their virtue, how can the creatures they generate seek survival through restlessness? Thus, stillness and silence are the abode of spirit and illumination; emptiness and nothingness are where the Dao resides. When the spirit is settled and stable, it rests in heaven’s stillness and silence. When the great Dao embodies its essence, it dwells in the heart’s emptiness and nothingness.\n\nThe spirit is what we receive from heaven; the bones and flesh, what we inherit from earth. This is what it means to honor the spirit to preserve the form. Thus it is said: The Dao gives birth to the One. The Dao does not generate, nor does the One stand alone. Yet when we observe the state before existence began, we forcibly name it the Dao. When numbers were still merged, we call it the One. The One gives birth to the Two. It splits to become the two qi of yin and yang. The Two gives birth to the Three. Yang, clear, rises to form heaven; yin, congealed, descends to become earth. The two qi harmonize in the center to create humans. The Three gives birth to the myriad things. Once the Three Powers are established, the ten thousand transformations can arise, and the myriad kinds renew themselves daily.\n\nThe myriad things bear yin on their backs and embrace yang in their fronts, harmonizing through the balancing qi. Turning away from yin and facing yang is the natural course of life. The balancing of qi is the root of vitality.\n\nLaozi said: Humans receive the transformations of heaven and earth to be born, taking in qi to transform and give rise to this form and spirit. In the first month, the essence congeals, its appearance like grease. In the second month, the vessels form, as blood and qi channel into pathways. In the third month, the embryo takes shape, though its interior remains unhardened. In the fourth month, the fetus appears, with faint outlines of features. In the fifth month, the sinews develop—halfway through the ten-month gestation. The sinews, firm yet flexible, lie between hardness and softness, so they form at this time.\n\nAs essence and blood transform to become bones and flesh, the bones harden and the flesh thickens, obstructing the flow of vital qi. Thus, the flesh conceals the vessels, and the bones connect the sinews, allowing the vital qi to circulate and link the limbs and joints. In the sixth month, the bones form as the essence solidifies. In the seventh month, the fetus is complete, with the five viscera fully developed internally and the nine orifices formed externally. In the eighth month, it moves its limbs. In the ninth month, it becomes restless, as movement reaches its peak. In the tenth month, it is born, its form and bones fully developed, the five viscera now manifest. Inner and outer are each properly aligned.\n\nThe liver governs the eyes, the kidneys the ears, the spleen the tongue, the lungs the nose, and the gallbladder the mouth. These assignments may differ from other accounts. Though the five viscera and seven orifices have their designated functions, they are interconnected and responsive in all ways. Thus, the heart is not mentioned here, for as the most numinous of the viscera, its external orifice transcends singular governance.\n\nThe outer is the surface; the inner, the core. The four limbs and nine orifices are the surface; the five viscera and six bowels, the core. The head is round to model heaven; the feet are square to resemble earth. Heaven is round and earth square, so their upper and lower parts each follow their kind.\n\nHeaven has four seasons, five phases, nine divisions, and three hundred sixty-six days. The nine divisions are the nine celestial gates. Humans have four limbs, five viscera, nine orifices, and three hundred sixty joints—all modeled on what is above. Heaven has wind, rain, cold, and heat; humans have taking and giving, joy and anger. Wind disperses, rain bestows—these correspond to taking and giving. Cold governs killing, heat governs harmony—these correspond to joy and anger.\n\nThe gallbladder manifests as clouds, symbolizing courage and awe. The lungs manifest as qi, symbolizing purity and brightness. The spleen manifests as wind, symbolizing movement. The kidneys manifest as rain, symbolizing yin’s moisture. The liver manifests as thunder, symbolizing wrathful shaking. Humans and heaven and earth are mutually resonant, with the heart as their master.",

      "translated_text": "The heart governs perception and transformation, akin to the fundamental mechanism of the Ninefold Dao. The remaining viscera and bowels all have their correspondences, and thus the resonance between heaven and humanity is complete. Yet the heart, fundamentally master of the tongue’s single orifice, remains unencumbered by external encasement, free from entanglement—hence its lordship over all.\n\nThe ears and eyes are the sun and moon; blood and qi are wind and rain. The eyes mirror the sun, the ears mirror the moon; qi mirrors wind, blood mirrors rain. When the sun and moon deviate from their courses, they suffer obscuration and loss of light; when wind and rain arrive unseasonably, they bring ruin and calamity. If the sun and moon stray from their proper degrees, they reach conjunction and eclipse; if wind and rain come at the wrong time, the five grains are destroyed. Applied to the body, the consequences are self-evident.\n\nWhen the five planets stray from their paths, the provinces and states suffer their misfortune. Each of the five planets governs its own celestial region. Heavenly timing and human affairs interact and give rise to phenomena. Thus, when the feudal lords of a state or the governors of a province commit a single moral lapse, the signs appear above, and the realm below suffers the disaster. From this, we know that humanity and heaven-and-earth are mutually resonant.\n\nThe ears and eyes are the sun and moon; blood and qi are wind and rain. When qi rebels, wind becomes violent; when blood stagnates, rain lingers. When the ears and eyes lack moderation, the sun and moon stray from their degrees. Such is the nature of things.\n\nThe Way of heaven and earth is vast and boundless, yet even it tempers its radiance, cherishing its numinous brightness. How then can human ears and eyes endure endless seeing and hearing without rest, or the spirit gallop without fatigue? Heaven and earth are broad and immeasurable, their limits unfathomable. The sun and moon shine ceaselessly, yet even they suffer the losses of eclipse, moderating their full brilliance. Cold and heat follow their constant cycles, preserving their numinous brightness. How much less can one, confined by the limits of human measure, use them without restraint?\n\nThus the sage guards the internal and does not lose the external. One who excels at guarding the internal is not led astray by externals. Blood and qi are humanity’s splendor—its very countenance. The five viscera are humanity’s essence: the liver stores the *hun*, the lungs store the *po*, the heart stores the spirit, the spleen stores intention and wisdom, the kidneys store essence and will. All are inwardly stored as essence, outwardly expressed as spirit.\n\nWhen blood and qi are concentrated within and do not stray outward, the chest and abdomen are full, and desires diminish. All manifestations of joy and anger in the countenance, all shifts between courage and timidity in the breath—these are signs of blood and qi straying outward. In this way, loss and gain become self-evident. If blood does not rebel within, the muscles and bones are replete; if qi does not wander without, emotions and desires are few. When the qi of the viscera is insufficient, partial cravings arise to harmonize and regulate—how then can desires persist? When desires diminish, the ears and eyes become clear, and hearing and vision grow keen. Desires arise primarily through the ears and eyes; thus, when they are few, clarity arises naturally. Clarity brings unconfused hearing and unswayed vision—this is called illumination.\n\nWhen the five viscera remain aligned with the heart without separation, qi and intention prevail, conduct is not perverse, the spirit flourishes, and qi does not scatter. The five viscera each have their manifestations, their spirits and qi distinct, yet the heart is the master of the hundred spirits and five viscera. If it can keep them aligned, unheard and unresponsive, then the spirit is whole and qi is focused. Yet if the gallbladder’s courage or the spleen’s arrogance act in rebellion, unrestrained by the heart, how can rectitude be achieved? With hearing that misses nothing, vision that sees all, and the power to accomplish everything—the heart’s full potential is realized in its use.\n\nCalamities find no entry, and pathogenic qi cannot invade. Pathogenic qi assails the center only when there is no master; calamities arise externally when the mechanism is obscured. Thus, when qi is upright, evil cannot invade; when the spirit is whole, fortune arrives manifestly. Therefore, those who seek much gain little; those who perceive broadly know narrowly. Only by calming the heart can one govern, and the five viscera reveal themselves—then one knows the world.\n\nThe orifices are the doors and windows of the spirit; through them, clarity is communicated, and by them, ingress and egress occur. Qi and intention are the messengers and signs of the five viscera. When intention and qi serve as messengers, the five viscera can be observed. Thus, when the ears and eyes are indulgent in sound and color, the five viscera become agitated and unsettled, responding as if to an official summons. When blood and qi surge without cease, the spirit gallops unrestrained, and the spirit is burdened by the form.\n\nThough fortune and misfortune arrive like mountains, they cannot be discerned. In stillness, one perceives the subtle; in chaos, one is deluded by the manifest. The sage cherishes and does not transgress—cherishing the form and spirit, not overstepping into sound and color. If the sage ensures that the ears and eyes are keen and profoundly penetrating, unenticed by external allure, then intention and qi do not lose their clarity and stillness, desires are few, and the five viscera are at peace. When the spirit guards the form within and does not stray, one can observe the external events of past ages and the internal affairs of future matters, and the gates of fortune and misfortune become as nothing. If one truly embodies the virtues described above, then the profound mirror is without obstruction—and how much more so when fortune and misfortune have already taken shape, nothing will escape notice.\n\nBy distinguishing categories and naming their relations, by illuminating numbers and their mutual generation, affairs become observable. By cultivating one’s nature to align with the root, by exhausting the spirit to fathom the distant, the past can be traced. The external is the track of what has come before; the internal is the omen of what is to come. The past leaves tracks; by following them, one arrives. What comes from without has not yet taken shape; by attending to its omens, one discerns the internal. Thus, the alternation of mechanisms and their cycles can be known—how then can the gates of fortune and misfortune be worthy of mention?\n\nThe farther one extends outward, the less one knows—this speaks to the spirit’s inability to be externally indulgent. When externally indulgent, it is swept away by others and cannot reflect upon itself. Thus, the five colors confuse the eyes, rendering them unclear; the five sounds enter the ears, rendering them unhearing.",

      "translated_text": "「Hearing mixed sounds brings confusion; the five flavors disorder the palate, causing the mouth to lose its natural sensitivity and thus its true taste. The pursuit of dwelling and avoidance of movement unsettle the heart, leading to erratic conduct—when the mind is disturbed, there is no steadfast purpose. Therefore, indulgence in desires makes one’s *qi* stray, and attachment to likes and dislikes exhausts one’s spirit. Those who do not swiftly abandon them will see their *qi* wasted daily, and how long can such a life endure?\n\nIt is because people cannot complete their natural lifespan that they nurture their lives excessively. All follow their cravings and attachments, over-nourishing themselves and thereby harming their vitality. Only those who do not cling to life as their own can attain longevity. Forgetting joy brings contentment; abandoning life preserves the body. The Dao of heaven and earth flows and unites, all things converge into one—*yin* and *yang* *qi* intermingle, thus maintaining harmony. All things spring from a single origin; to know that origin is to know all things. Unable to grasp the One, one knows nothing. Without adhering to the fundamental Dao, all encounters lead to bewilderment.\n\nI dwell within the world as one of its myriad things, yet things remain distinct from me. Born together between heaven and earth, my body is but one among the ten thousand. How can things truly \"affect\" other things? Only those who share the same essence do not harm each other through opposition. Desire cannot be served, for life arises naturally and cannot be forced. Death cannot be avoided, for time wills it and cannot be defied. To revere the lowly is not to be humble, nor to despise the noble to be virtuous—it is simply following nature’s way. To rest in one’s inherent nature is true ease; to not strain beyond one’s limits is supreme joy. To follow nature’s course without forcing it is to embrace its fullness. What else could be called the ultimate in ease?\n\nTo uphold the virtues of tranquility and contentment, to embrace stillness and thus complete one’s days. Adhering to these four virtues, one rides the transformations of nature to their end. Without partiality or favoritism, this is the Dao’s perfection. Clinging to virtue and nurturing harmony, one aligns with heaven’s will. To embrace the virtue of stillness and harmonize with the *qi* of life, thus conforming to nature’s flow.\n\nTo dwell at the boundary of the Dao, to neighbor with virtue—those who traverse emptiness in response are at the Dao’s utmost. To govern with harmony is to be surrounded by virtue. To not initiate fortune nor provoke misfortune: fortune is not fortune unless one finds ease in it; misfortune is not misfortune unless one is agitated by it. Those who remain tranquil in misfortune will find their fortune distinct from others; those who cannot find ease in fortune will see it turn to misfortune. The essence of fortune and misfortune lies not in wealth or poverty, but in agitation or stillness.\n\nMoreover, the principle of the beginning is rooted in action: evil arises from reckless movement, and peril lurks in the timing of one’s actions. Thus, the sage acts without forcing, faces neither misfortune nor fortune, and moves effortlessly forward and backward. Though fortune and misfortune may appear externally, the sage remains undisturbed by their ebb and flow, unaffected by life and death. To follow nature’s transformations without resistance is to be ever constant—this is the sage’s unchanging state, beyond birth and death. Hence, it is called *至神* (ultimate subtlety of the spirit).\n\nThe spirit seeks without failing, accomplishes without hindrance. Its application knows no limits. To guard emptiness—wandering through all things yet not being bound by them—is to transcend self and object. Laozi says: *\"The sage who lightens the world’s burdens is spirit without encumbrance.\"* When the spirit is vast and balanced, it bears no weight upon the soul’s essence, and thus effortlessly detaches from worldly honors.\n\nTo refine all things—when the heart is undisturbed by external objects—is to not be confused. To perceive the great as the autumn hair and the small as the mighty mountain, to dwell equally in vast or narrow realms, abandoning distinctions of size or insignificance, how could one be confused?\n\nTo equalize life and death—when the mind is unshaken—is to not fear. For awareness ends with dreams, and dreams with waking. Life and death move and rest, each in its own time, and to align with this way is to safeguard what one fears.\n\nTo harmonize with transformation—when one knows that all things share the same essence—is to not be dazzled by heaven’s logic. The ultimate sage stands as an unyielding pillar, traversing paths without obstruction. Virtue is the master that never falters, the Dao ever flows and remains open. Drawing from an inexhaustible source, learning from an unending teacher, the sage fulfills all needs without ever wearying the spirit, or losing the body’s essence. Without action that does not succeed, without response that does not align, bending and extending, rising and falling—embracing fate without confusion, and thus effortlessly navigating fortune and misfortune, while harm and benefit cannot truly disturb.」",
      "overlap_context": "ts omens, one discerns the internal. Thus, the alternation of mechanisms and their cycles can be known—how then can the gates of fortune and misfortune be worthy of mention?\n\nThe farther one extends outward, the less one knows—this speaks to the spirit’s inability to be externally indulgent. When externally indulgent, it is swept away by others and cannot reflect upon itself. Thus, the five colors confuse the eyes, rendering them unclear; the five sounds enter the ears, rendering them unhearing.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi says:\n\nWhen the Son of Heaven, the public lords, and the marquises treat the realm and the world as their own home, and all things as their livestock, harboring the vastness of the world, possessing the abundance of myriad things, then their *qi* becomes dissipated and their wills grow arrogant. This is what is meant by: *\"Nobility without arrogance\"*—yet arrogance will inevitably arise.\n\nThe great will invade the small—such as when Jin annihilated You, or Chu attacked Xing. The small will act haughty and domineer—such as Cao Gong and Wei Xian. Their hearts are extravagant and broad, like a sudden wind or violent rain, unable to endure long.\n\nThe *qi* of strength and might—even Heaven and Earth cannot sustain it long, let alone a king who indulges in excess and usurpation. Therefore, the Sage governs with the Dao to restrain them. What else but the Way of emptiness and softness could bring stability?\n\nHolding to One and doing nothing, diminishing the clashing *qi*, balancing the extremes—\nSeeing the small and guarding the soft, withdrawing without possession;\nSeeing the small yet achieving the great, guarding the soft yet controlling the hard.\n\nModeling oneself after the rivers and seas—\nThe rivers and seas do not strive, yet their merit and name naturally manifest.\nThose who dwell in lowliness are honored by the multitude;\nTheir bodies accept counsel, and things accord with them—\nThus, without seeking, their name is fulfilled;\nWithout contending, their deeds are accomplished.\n\nNot forcing, they achieve kingship.\nThose who rely on virtue are at peace; those who rely on force rebel.\n\nAs the mother of the world, they preserve their spirit undying—\nFor the mother is the essence of softness.\nThe Sage follows this to preserve the spirit.\n\nSelf-preservation ensures nobility—\nTo desire noble status, one must first love one’s body.\nThus, by conquering oneself with the Dao, one’s life may be long preserved.\nIf the body is preserved, how could nobility perish?\n\nWith the power of ten thousand chariots, treating all things as instruments for merit and name—\nMerit and name, great or small, are established according to one’s station.\nWith authority so heavy, one cannot treat oneself lightly.\nAs *Zhuangzi* says: *\"To treat one’s body lightly is to lose one’s state.\"*\n\nTo treat oneself lightly is to fail in merit and name.\nThere has never been a case where the body is not at ease yet the state is well-governed.\n\nThe Dao achieves the great through the small, the many through the few—\nThe resources of the great are but a single hair’s breadth.\nThe essence of the many is but a single hairpin’s length.\n\nThus, the Sage governs the world with the Dao:\nThe subtle and mysterious are seen as small,\nThe frugal and diminished are seen as few—\nSeeing small, one achieves the great;\nSeeing few, one achieves perfection.\n\nThe Dao achieves greatness through subtlety and mystery,\nVirtue achieves beauty through diminishment and lack.\n\nThe Way of Heaven lowers the high and raises the low,\nDiminishes the surplus and nourishes the deficient—\nLike drawing a bow, where balance is key.\nThe rivers and seas occupy the world’s deficient places,\nThus all under Heaven return to them and honor them.\n\nTherefore, the Sage maintains humility, modesty, stillness, and yielding—\nThis is to appear lowly,\nTo have an empty heart with nothing—\nThis is to appear deficient.\nFollowing the example of the rivers and seas.\n\nTo appear lowly is to attain the high;\nTo appear deficient is to attract the virtuous.\nThe heart’s constant humility brings virtue’s ever-greater height;\nThe body’s constant retreat brings action’s ever-greater progress.\n\nThe proud cannot stand, the extravagant cannot endure.\nThe forceful perish, the overfull are destroyed.\nSudden winds and torrential rains do not last a day;\nA shallow valley cannot fill in an instant.\nThe valley is narrow and confined—\nIf filled in an instant, it will overflow.\nSudden winds and torrential rains embody forceful *qi*,\nThus they cannot endure and are extinguished.\nThe shallow valley occupies forceful ground,\nThus it cannot avoid being seized.\nSeize their return, honor their virtue.\n\nTherefore, the Sage embraces the feminine and the yielding,\nAbandons arrogance and excess,\nDares not act with forceful *qi*,\nFollowing the warnings of Heaven and Earth.\n\nEmbracing the feminine, they establish the masculine;\nNot daring to be extravagant, they endure long.\nOnly those who embrace the feminine\nCan possess the virtue of standing firm.\n\nLaozi says: *\"The Way of Heaven reaches its extreme and reverses,\nFills and then diminishes—*\nLike the sun and moon.\nAt noon, the sun declines;\nWhen the moon is full, it wanes.\n\nThus, the Sage diminishes daily,\nDaring not to be self-satisfied with clashing *qi*,\nAdvancing daily with the feminine,\nTheir merit and virtue never decay—\nThis is the Way of Heaven.\n\nAdvancing daily with the feminine means\nPushing softness to govern things.\n\nThe Way of Heaven diminishes the full and benefits the humble;\nThe Sage follows this law.\nThus, perfect virtue renews itself daily without replacement.\n\nHuman nature universally desires the high and rejects the low,\nDesires gain and rejects loss,\nDesires profit and rejects illness,\nDesires honor and rejects disgrace,\nDesires nobility and rejects lowliness—\nAll people act this way, yet cannot achieve it.\nTo grasp it tightly is to fail to obtain it.\n\nThings naturally change and transform;\nTheir inherent patterns and forces are balanced.\nIf one waits for completion, success will come.\nIf one waits for completion, one will fail to obtain it.\n\nSuppose those who hold such positions\nHad already determined their proper measure—\nCould they, through partial desires and rigid adherence, truly attain it?\n\nTherefore, the Sage follows Heaven:\nAchieving without action, obtaining without grasping,\nRiding the natural course, thus succeeding with the times,\nGaining with things.\n\nAligning with people’s emotions yet differing in method,\nThey endure long.\nAligning in their desired ends,\nDiffering in their chosen paths,\nReversing their private loves and aversions,\nThus forming the virtue of enduring long.\n\nHence, the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors had warning vessels,\nCalled *yòuzhī*—\nWhen empty, they stand upright;\nWhen full, they overturn.\nThe details are recorded in *Zhōu Yǔ*.\n\nThings flourish then decline,\nThe sun reaches its zenith and moves,\nThe moon is full then wanes,\nJoy reaches its peak and sorrow follows.\n\nTherefore, the keen and wise guard with stupidity,\nThe most discerning have no followers,\nHiding brilliance and blending with the multitude.\nThe well-read and eloquent guard with frugality,\nBoasting of ability brings disgrace,\nHolding back without loss.\n\nThe martial and courageous guard with caution,\nLightly treating enemies leads to defeat,\nCautiousness preserves victory.\n\nThe wealthy and expansive guard with restraint,\nArrogance and excess bring daily peril,\nHumility and diminishment bring daily blessings.\n\nVirtue bestowed upon the world is guarded with yielding,\nSelf-praise leads to ruin,\nPromoting others ensures completeness—\nThese five virtues are how the ancient kings governed the world.\n\nTo hold the world is to reach the utmost.\nIf one clings to extreme desires while holding an extreme position,\nCollapse will follow.\nWithout these five virtues, how could one guard it?\n\nThose who follow this Dao\nDo not desire fullness,",

      "translated_text": "The essence lies in harmony within constancy—\nLike the disciplined warrior’s tools.\n\nOnly by not being full\nDoes one endure without renewal.\nThrough humility and emptiness, decay occurs,\nYet this decay nurtures the renewal of virtue and power.\n\nLaozi said:\n*The Sage closes with the yin and opens with the yang—*\nThis is called the Great Harmony.\n\nTo reach the point of no delight\nIs to attain the state of no discontent.\nNeither approval nor disapproval,\nThen constancy is achieved.\n\nWithout delight, there is eternal delight.\nWithout delight, the utmost delight is attained.\nWhere delight resides, sorrow follows—\nOnly those who forget their delight\nNeed no prompting to reach its peak.\n\nThus, inner delight transcends the external,\nNot relying on external delight to fill the inner.\nInner delight transcends—\nI am unrestrained beyond things;\nDelight within—\nThings conform to me,\nAnd thus, even in loss, there is gain.\n\nTo possess self-delight is to possess self-will,\nTo be nobly above all things,\nUnseen yet sovereign—\nThis is true nobility.\n\nThe reason for this is:\nTo govern the world by becoming its essential core,\nNot in others, but in oneself,\nNot in people, but in the body.\nWhen the body is attained, all things are complete.\n\nThose who attain themselves\nBring harmony to heaven, earth, and all things.\nThus, those who master the arts of the heart\nTranscend external desires and aversions,\nAbandoning all as discarded things.\n\nTherefore, there is no joy, no anger,\nNo delight, no suffering—\nAll things merge in the Mysterious Unity,\nNeither affirmation nor negation.\nJudgment arises from love and hatred;\nWhen the heart is empty, things naturally merge in the Mysterious Unity.\nThus, one does not know how to abandon,\nAnd all distinctions are exhausted.\n\nTherefore, the scholar has fixed principles,\nThe sage has unchanging conduct—\nThough not forgetting their essence,\nThey attain self-contentment and self-Dao.\n\nThey do not rely on power to be honored,\nNor on wealth to be rich,\nNor on strength to prevail.\nThey do not covet goods or power,\nNor crave fame or status,\nNor take nobility as security,\nNor lowliness as peril.\nIf one’s place is fixed,\nWhat need is there for external support?\n\nForm, spirit, qi, and will\nEach reside in their proper place.\nThe four coexist,\nAnd the path of harmony\nThus avoids contradiction.\n\nEven the scholar’s and sage’s moral integrity\nCan be thus—\nHow much more so for the Sage of complete virtue?\n\nThe body is the dwelling of life,\nResiding in the form.\nQi is the origin of life,\nRooted in essence.\nThe spirit is the governor of life,\nBy governance in the spirit.\nIf one loses its place,\nThe three are harmed.\nIf one loses the proper nourishment of its place,\nAll are harmed together.\n\nThus, those who take the spirit as master\nFind the form benefiting accordingly—\nGoverned so as not to transgress,\nHence its benefit.\nThose who take the form as governor\nHarm the spirit.\nIndulging in excess, overfeeding,\nHarms the spirit.\nThe greedy, gluttonous, and desirous\nAre blinded by power and wealth,\nTempted by fame and status—\nThough their intelligence surpasses others,\nTheir spirit weakens with time,\nLost in excess without return.\nThe body becomes rigid, the center blocked—\nNo passage remains.\n\nRigidity of the form is closure,\nLack of harmonious qi is obstruction.\nThus, there are times of blindness and forgetfulness,\nSelf-loss.\n\nExternal allure and internal depletion\nOver time lead to obscurity.\nGoing forth without knowing the way back,\nThey suffer the affliction of blindness and forgetfulness.\n\nSpirit and will—\nWhen still, they grow daily stronger;\nWhen agitated, they weaken daily, aging.\nA full spirit encompasses all things—\nThis is due to stillness.\nA constrained form falters—\nThis is due to movement.\nHow can one neglect the rhythms of flourishing and decline?\n\nThus, the Sage nurtures the spirit,\nHarmonizes and weakens the qi,\nBalances and levels the form,\nAnd floats with the Dao.\nThough things come and go,\nAll conform to the Dao.\n\nThus, the transformations of all things\nAre without exception,\nAnd all affairs\nAre without resistance.\nIn harmony with what is transformed,\nIn accord with what changes.\n\nTo guard simplicity—\nNot adding desire to the nature of life,\nYet encompassing the roots of transformation—\nThis is called simplicity.\n\nLaozi said:\n*The True Person*\nIs one whose

high and deep,\nAscend and descend.\n\nLevel as the plumb-line, straight as the square,\nNot because the balance makes it level—\nEverywhere it is even.\nNot because the square makes it straight—\nEverywhere it is true.\n\nRound as the compass, square as the set-square,\nYet not round by being round—no roundness,\nNot square by being square—no squareness.\nIt enfolds heaven and earth yet has no surface or depth,\nIts vastness knows no outside, its subtlety no inside.\nPiercing like a hollow dome, yet unimpeded,\nGreat circle without bounds, great passage without obstruction.\n\nThus those who embody the Dao:\nNeither angry nor joyful,\nTheir sitting free of care, their sleep without dreams,\nThey name things as they see them, respond as events arise.\nThis was explained earlier.\n\nLaozi says:\nThose who crave fame as a corpse must create affairs,\nAnd affairs, once born, abandon the public for the private.\nThose who seek fame as lords must have affairs,\nAnd affairs, once born, breed discord—\nThus one must abandon fame and return to the public.\n\nTo double the Dao and burden oneself,\nTo court praise and do good,\nTo establish a name and be deemed virtuous—\n*Double* means *betray*.\nBetraying the Dao to seek praise is not true goodness.\nChasing convention to gain a name is not true virtue.\n\nGovernance that defies principle brings many reproaches,\nActions that defy the times yield no merit.\nTo follow principle is to act with few concerns yet achieve great deeds;\nTo defy the times is to labor much yet see little fruit.\nFalsely scheming for advantage—\nWhen success fails to justify the effort,\nWhen failure brings ruin—\nThose who seek praise and immediate effect,\nWho curry favor with the times—\nTheir

harm.\nTo govern before signs appear is to ensure fortune;\nTo cut off extraordinary gain is to avoid harm.\n\nThus those who act without doing—\nIf they lose their tranquility, they are in peril;\nThose who govern without doing—\nIf they lose their order, they bring chaos.\nTo lose tranquility means to abandon inner peace for outer seeking—\nThen rigidity ensues.\nTo lose order means to forsake self to govern others—\nThen confusion follows.\n\nThus one should not be polished like jade,\nNor rigid like stone.\nFor jade and stone, once divided, spawn contention.\nThe finer the carving, the sharper the blade;\nThe finer the horn, the deadlier the strike.\nSweet springs run dry, straight trees are felled.\nThings of beauty invite harm,\nMen who court fame invite disaster.\nFlowery words bring later regret—\nFirst to flatter with eloquence,\nThen to invite ruin upon oneself.\nStone may wound the mountain that hides it—\nMountains that do not conceal treasure are soon stripped bare,\nMen who do not guard their words soon invite calamity.\nThe peril of silence lies in speech itself.\n\nEarlier, the common folk suffered calamity\nBecause of their reckless

sought, the Dao is lost;\nWhen schemes arise, harm is born.\n\nThose who delight in matters never fail to be entangled,\nThose who vie for profit never fail to be exhausted.\nThere is no crossing water without wetting one’s feet,\nNo passing through dust without staining one’s body.\nSkilled swimmers drown, skilled riders fall—\nEach meets ruin through their own pursuits.\n\nBoast of one’s abilities and lose one’s merit,\nExploit one’s talents and lose one’s life.\nSuccess lies in timing, not in strife,\nGovernance lies in the Dao, not in the sage.\nTiming brings success without forced contention,\nThe Dao thrives in self-respect—why seek the sage’s praise?\n\nEarth rests low yet does not contend for height,\nSo it remains secure without peril.\nWater flows downward yet does not vie for speed,\nSo it departs without delay.\nWhat the Dao values, what virtue esteems,\nIs height without contention, speed without haste.\n\nThus, the sage holds nothing and loses nothing,\nActs without contrivance and meets no defeat.\nThe Dao is formless, elusive—\nTo grasp it is to lose it.\nIt is not a physical body,\nDifficult to carve or shape—\nYet to force it is to invite ruin.\n\nLaozi says: One word cannot be exhausted,\nTwo words make the world follow,\nThree words command the feudal lords,\nFour words sway the world.\nFidelity brings exhaustion’s end,\nVirtue makes the world submit,\nPromoting worthy virtue—\nThe feudal lords rise in power,\nLoving the few while cherishing the many—\nThe world unites in harmony.\nHe who masters all four words\nAscends to emperorship,\nHe who gains but one\nDescends to conquest or aid.\n\nLaozi says: Humans have three deaths,\nNot by fate alone.\nExcess in eating and drinking\nDiminishes the body—\nIllness claims it;\nUnchecked joy in gain\nPursues it endlessly—\nPunishment claims it;\nWith few opposing many,\nWith weak defying the strong—\nWar claims it.\nThus, life and death depend on oneself,\nCalamity and fortune have no fixed gate.\nThey do not descend from heaven,\nBut arise from human competition.\n\nLaozi says: The greater the giving, the fairer the return,\nThe greater the grudge, the deeper the ruin.\nSparse giving yet high expectations,\nNurturing resentment yet hoping for no harm—\nSuch things do not exist.\nObserve how one proceeds,\nAnd one knows how they will return.\nHigh merit brings rich reward,\nDeep grudge invites great retribution.\nFollow their weight—\nLeave behind both debt and grace.\n\nLaozi says: Trace the heavenly command,\nRefine the heart’s art,\nBalance likes and dislikes,\nAlign with nature’s flow—\nAnd the Dao’s governance is complete.\nTrace the heavenly command,\nAnd one is undisturbed by fortune’s shift.\nRefine the heart’s art,\nAnd one does not err in joy or wrath.\nBalance likes and dislikes,\nAnd one does not greedily grasp the vain.\nAlign with nature’s flow,\nAnd one’s desires do not exceed their bounds.\nUndisturbed by fortune’s shift,\nAnd one’s actions follow the natural order.\nNo erring in joy or wrath,\nAnd one’s rewards and punishments are impartial.\nNot greedily grasping the vain,\nAnd one’s desires do not harm one’s nature.\nDesires not exceeding their bounds,\nAnd one knows how to nurture life with contentment.\n\nThese four principles,\nSeek not from others, nor borrow from men,\nBut return within oneself to find.\nUnderstanding these four,\nOne may call it great harmony.\nNot relying on others,\nOnly self-refinement suffices.\n\nLaozi says: Do not seek the blame of others,\nNor hate those who blame you.\nAvoid deceitful actions,\nAnd why would others blame you?\nHold within you compassion and forgiveness,\nAnd you will have no cause to reproach others.\nCultivate the virtue of good reputation,\nAnd do not seek others’ praise for yourself.\nRefine your own virtue,\nAnd do not seek others’ praise.\nIf you cannot prevent calamity from coming,\nTrust in your own non-invitation of it.\nIf you cannot ensure fortune will arrive,\nTrust in your own non-rejection of it.\nIf you cannot guard against unforeseen calamity,\nTrust in fate’s unerring course.\nIf you cannot demand that certain fortune will come,\nReceive what comes as it should.\nWhen calamity arrives, it is not your own creation—\nSo even in ruin, why lament?\nWhen fortune comes, it is not your own doing—\nSo even in gain, why rely?\n\nThus, dwell in ease and find joy in the heart,\nGovern without contrivance.\nSerene, content, and at leisure—\nThis is all.\n\nLaozi says: The Daoist guards what they already possess,\nAnd does not seek what they have not obtained.\nSeeking what they have not obtained,\nThey lose what they already possess;\nClinging to what they possess,\nThey gain what they truly desire.\nWhat they already possess is the spirit of their body,\nWhat they lack are myriad external skills.\nNow, abandoning the spirit of their body,\nThey pray for skills they have not yet attained.\nThe unattained may come,\nBut the spirit they once held is already forgotten.\nNot safeguarding the path to one gain,\nIt is hard to regret the loss of two.\nThus, the perfect one guards their root,\nAnd does not chase after superficial ends;\nThey value what is within,\nAnd do not control what is without.\n\nIf governance is not yet firmly established in avoiding chaos,\nThen those who strive for governance will surely perish.\nIf conduct cannot yet escape blame,\nThen those who rush for fame will surely falter.\nRoot firm, the state is at peace,\nActions aligned, no shame is incurred.\n\nThus, no fortune is greater than avoiding calamity,\nNo profit is greater than not losing.\nFortune without calamity—\nFortune is indeed great.\nProfit without loss—\nProfit is indeed vast.\n\nThus, things may bring gain through loss,\nOr loss through gain.\nOnly without calamity or fortune,\nIs there no loss or gain.\n\nThe Dao cannot be coerced for profit,\nYet it can bring tranquility and avoid harm.\nThe Daoist cannot be lured by profit,\nFor without profit, there is no harm.\nThus, the spirit finds peace,\nAnd the Dao comes naturally.\nThus, one who does not taste calamity will not taste fortune,\nOne who does not commit wrong will not earn merit.\nWithout calamity or fortune,\nWithout wrong or merit—\nThis is called great harmony.\n\nThe Dao says: Vague and obscure,\nFollowing heaven’s majesty,\nHarmonizing with

naturally.\n\nWhat comes is not welcomed,\nWhat departs is not detained—\nLet it be as it finds itself.\nThough people move east, west, south, or north,\nThey stand alone at the center,\nTheir bodies respond to things yet endless,\nThe Dao abides within yet moves alone.\n\nThus, amid crookedness, they do not lose their straightness,\nTheir fullness lies in their bending.\nFlowing with the world yet never straying from their domain,\nThe vital *qi* circulates and the true essence remains.\n\nThey do not seek virtue,\nNor shun ugliness—\nThey follow Heaven’s Dao,\nNot initiating, not clinging to self,\nThey follow Heaven’s principle,\nNot premeditating, not neglecting the moment,\nThey align with Heaven’s timing—\nNot seeking gain, not rejecting fortune,\nThey conform to Heaven’s natural order.\n\nHeaven has no mind,\nYet speaks not and all things arise;\nHumans act without contrivance,\nYet plan not and all affairs succeed.\nWithin, no strange fortune,\nWithout, no strange calamity—\nThus, calamity and fortune do not arise,\nAnd who would be a thief to others?\n\nAll who have fortune also have calamity,\nNow that calamity and fortune are merged in obscurity,\nWho would harm others?\nThus, supreme virtue:\nWords align with the Way,\nActions align with fortune,\nHearts unite above and below,\nNo divergent paths—\nThose with partial views advance or retreat in error,\nYet open the Way to virtue,\nAnd the people turn toward it.\n\nPartial views are insufficient to transform customs,\nYet the right Way can guide the people.\nLaozi says:\nTo do good is to exhort,\nTo do evil is to observe—\nExhorting breeds blame,\nObserving breeds affliction.\nExhortation is encouragement,\nObservation is scrutiny.\nWhen humans do good,\nThey should daily encourage themselves.\nWhen there are evils,\nThey see their own faults and correct them,\nThus turning toward the right—\nThis is not encouraging others to do good.\nIf one takes themselves as good,\nAnd scrutinizes others’ evils to blame them,\nThen affliction arises.\nThus, exhorting to do good is itself not good.\nHence, the Way cannot be advanced to seek fame,\nNor can it be retreated to cultivate the self.\n\nThus, the Sage does not act to seek fame,\nNor does they use knowledge to seek praise—\nGovernance follows nature,\nThey contribute nothing of their own.\nAdvancing without embellishing wisdom to seek fame,\nRetreating to cultivate the self to govern themselves,\nPushing through naturally—\nHow could they exhaust others’ praise?\n\nThe doer has what may not be completed,\nThe seeker has what may not be obtained—\nHumans have limits, yet the Dao is unobstructed.\nHumans seek yet do not obtain,\nThe Dao acts not yet encompasses all.\nWisdom without action,\nLike lack of wisdom, yields equal results—\nAbility without exertion,\nLike lack of ability, yields equal merit.\nWisdom as if without wisdom,\nAbility as if without ability—\nThe Way is realized while human talents fade.\n\nWhen *virtue/power* fills within,\nHuman talents fade externally—\nThus, they have as if they lack,\nAnd reality as if it were void.\nHumans and the Dao cannot both be clear,\nHumans who love fame cannot use the Dao,\nThe Dao surpassing humans, fame ceases—\nFame flourishes with humans, yet perishes with them.\n\nThe Dao must be unified,\nAffairs cannot be fully dual.\nLaozi says:\nTo make the faithful divide wealth,\nNot knowing their fixed share yet probing the tally—\nWhy so?\nThe scheming mind of the faithful,\nIs not as good as the mindless.\nTo make the virtuous guard wealth,\nIs not as good as sealing the doors and keeping it whole—\nFor the desiring mind of the virtuous,\nIs not as good as the desireless.\nProbing the tally ends doubt with the mindless,\nThe virtuous see suspicion in the desiring.\nHumans highlight their flaws, then harbor resentment,\nYet mirrors reveal their ugliness and they take pride in it.\nThe wise point out faults to prompt change,\nThe foolish adorn themselves and claim virtue.\nHumans can receive things without appropriating them,\nThus free from burdens.\nPrioritize others, then yourself—\nA lifetime without fault.\n\nLaozi says:\nAll who deal with others,\nEither use treasures to corrupt,\nOr humble words to ensnare—\nCorruption is single, yet desires are insatiable.\nThe noble do not hoard treasures,\nBut use gifts and attire with humility and respect—\nIf others can act in accordance with one principle,\nLong-term, they will not grow weary.\nHumble bearing avoids reproach,\nPersuasion without binding oaths—\nYet alliances and pacts,\nMade with fixed terms yet broken before their time,\nAre the way of the petty.\nThe noble’s exchange,\nRequires no oaths or agreements—\nA single word suffices,\nA lifetime unaltered.\n\nThus, the noble do not externally adorn *virtue/power* and righteousness,\nNor internally cultivate false Daoist arts—\nInternally, they hold true sincerity,\nExternally, they display no hollow pretense.\nThey govern affairs within their domain,\nExpand their territory’s breadth,\nStrengthen their people’s loyalty unto death,\nFortify their cities and walls—\nHearts united above and below,\nThey defend the state together.\nThus, those who seek fame do not boast of meritless deeds,\nThose who seek profit do not attack what is hard to obtain—\nThis is the Way that must be preserved whole,\nThe principle that must be advantageous.\nSharing profit with the people,\nThey gladly die for them.\nUniting hearts with the people,\nThey guard the state together.\nSeekers of fame do not greedily overreach,\nSeekers of profit do not arbitrarily divide—\nThis is the Way that must be preserved whole,\nThus the state is jointly defended,\nAnd borders are firmly secured.\n\nLaozi says:\nThe Sage does not conquer their own mind,\nThe common people do not conquer their own desires.\nThe mind conquers, the Way is whole,\nDesires conquer, the body is in peril.\nThe noble act with upright *qi*,\nThe petty act with corrupt *qi*—\nInternally, it suits their nature,\nExternally, it aligns with righteousness—\nThey move according to principle,\nAnd do not clash with things—\nThis is the harmony of one *qi*.\nIndulging in flavors,\nExcess in sounds and colors,\nOutbursts of joy and anger,\nWithout regard for future consequences—\nThis is corrupt *qi*.\nCorrupt and upright injure each other,\nDesires and nature harm each other—\nThey cannot coexist,\nOne arises, the other declines—\nThus, the Sage diminishes desires and follows nature.\n\nThe eyes love colors,\nThe ears love sounds,\nThe nose loves fragrances,\nThe mouth loves flavors—\nAlluring them together,\nThey never stray from desires for profit and harm.\nEyes, ears, nose, and mouth,\nIgnoring what they truly desire,\nAll are controlled by the mind—\nEach finds its place—\nFrom this, it is clear that desires cannot be conquered.\n\nThe six senses’ desires,\nAre all governed by one mind.\n*Qi* upright within,\nThen desires do not harm nature.\nThe mind weakened externally,\nThen falsehood deceives the true self.\n\nThus, one knows that weakening and uprightness lie within,\nAnd gain or loss depend on the mind.",

      "translated_text": "「Only those who forget the governance of others and focus on governing themselves can truly speak of the Dao.\n\nLaozi said: *\"People have three grievances: those with high rank are envied by others, those with great office are despised by their lord, and those with abundant wealth are resented by the people.\"* Yet, if one can be humble despite high rank, generous despite great wealth, they preserve their innate good fortune. For when rank grows ever higher, their intentions become ever lower; when office expands ever greater, their heart grows ever smaller; when wealth thickens ever more, their giving becomes ever broader. Cultivating these three virtues, resentment will not arise.\n\nThus, nobility finds its foundation in humility, and height finds its base in lowliness. If these two are not cultivated, calamity will fall upon oneself.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Speech is the means by which one conveys themselves to others, and hearing is the means by which others convey themselves to one.\"* Expressing one’s own sentiments to reach others’ hearts, and grasping others’ intentions to align with one’s own. If one is both deaf and blind, the Dao cannot pass through them. Therefore, those afflicted with deafness and blindness—whether of body or of mind—cannot know the way of harmony. The eyes that fail to see the great mountains, the ears that do not hear the thunderous peals, are the deafness and blindness of the flesh. But those who mistake a mirror for a deer or a horse, whose wisdom is clouded by beans and grains, are the deafness and blindness of the mind. If one cannot discern even ordinary matters, how much less can they grasp the great Dao? Those who do not know what to convey are of the kind afflicted with deafness and blindness.\n\nThe Dao is the ultimate principle: all things with form arise from it, yet it remains their closest kin—nourished by the Dao, they take form. Those who eat of the grains and breathe the *qi* live long, yet the Dao is their true sovereign—granting life without form. All who learn wisdom draw from it, yet the Dao is their ultimate teacher—bestowing knowledge without instruction. The Dao is their parent, their lord, and their master.\n\nPeople generally harm what is useful by clinging to what is useless. They labor at vain pursuits, injuring the emotions that have bounds. Thus, knowledge that is not broadened leaves one perpetually wanting. The noble one often reflects that their understanding is yet insufficient, and they strive daily to better themselves. If one spends their days on games of chance yet seeks the Dao, their insights will be profound. But if one shifts the labor of games of chance to focus solely on *virtue* and the Dao, they may attain even greater depths.\n\nAsking and not asking differ as much as deafness and blindness separate one from others. Those who neither hear nor ask are truly the deaf and blind of the world.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Human nature must submit to virtue, not to force. One can be governed by virtue, not by coercion.\"* Virtue comes or does not come from without. Virtue given to others does not await their return. Therefore, the sage who wishes to be honored by others first honors others; who wishes to be revered by others first reveres others; who wishes to overcome others first overcomes themselves. The lowly one who humbles others first humbles themselves. Thus, nobility and humility, reverence and lowliness—all are governed by the Dao.\n\nThe ancient sage-kings spoke to others in humility, yet they led by example. Even if all under heaven joyfully followed them without tiring, and revered them without wearying, it was because their virtue was abundant and their *qi* aligned with the Dao. Hence, they knew that giving is taking, and following is leading—thus approaching the Dao itself.\n\nTo honor others is not to honor their persons, but to take honor; to lead others is not to lead their persons, but to take precedence. This is the *qi* aligning with the Dao, and virtue returning to oneself. Thus, they are followed without weariness, and revered without burden.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Those with little virtue yet much favor are scorned; those with inferior talent yet high position are in peril; those with no great deeds yet abundant wealth are despised.\"* Thus, things may sometimes bring gain yet cause loss, or loss yet bring gain. Talent hidden without proper display invites scorn and danger, and such must inevitably follow loss and gain in turn—this is the verification of fate.\n\nThe common folk all know what is profitable as profit, yet they do not know that what is harmful can be profit, and what is profitable can be harm. The common folk know profit as profit, yet they do not know that profit can be harm. The sage knows that profit is harm, and that what is not harm is true profit.\n\nThus, the twice-cut tree will surely wound its roots, and the hoarding family will surely face ruin. Great profit often turns to harm—that is the Way of Heaven. The tree that is felled twice will be wounded at its roots, and the family that buries treasure will face calamity upon itself. These are things gained not by intention—first profit, then harm—that is the Way of Heaven.\n\nLaozi said: *\"The petty man acts daily for mere gain, the noble man acts daily for righteousness.\"* Those who do good are not seeking fame, yet fame follows them; fame does not align with profit, yet profit returns to them. Their aims are the same, but their ends differ. The petty man acts for gain, and profit brings them harm. The noble one follows the Dao, not seeking profit, yet fame comes to them. Thus, they receive the same profit yet face different harms.\n\nTherefore, beneficial action is inevitably followed by loss. Speech that lacks constancy brings no lasting truth, and those who gain without constancy are petty men. They do not uphold their virtue steadfastly, and may later suffer shame for it. To excel in one matter and master one skill is mediocrity. Their vision is not comprehensive, and they are confined to one domain. To cover all and possess all, to employ all abilities and talents—that is the sage. Silent of deceit, free of sorrow, they entrust virtue to the worthy and employ ability to the capable.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Life is borrowed, death is returned. Thus, in times of order, one protects righteousness with their life; in times of chaos, one protects their life with righteousness. On the day of death, the way is fulfilled. In times of order, one safeguards their life with righteousness; in times of chaos, one sacrifices their life for righteousness.\"* Therefore, the noble one benefits others, and even death does not bring regret.\n\nThus, they regard death as returning home—no different from the years of life. Therefore, the noble one is cautious only in their singular use of this life.\n\nTo act in accordance with the Dao is to move without deviating from the right path. Hence, life is received from Heaven, and fate is met with time. One may have talent yet not encounter the age, which is Heaven’s doing. To seek it has a method, and to attain it lies in fate. To meet the time is fortune; to not meet Heaven is misfortune. When they gain, they do not rejoice; when they lose, they do not resent.",

      "translated_text": "「The noble one may act in virtue without necessarily receiving blessings, nor avoid wickedness to escape misfortune. To do good does not always bring fortune, nor does abstaining from evil always prevent calamity—yet they never abandon righteousness to seek blessings. Why? Because their nature cannot be reckless, and their heart remains undivided.\n\nThus, the noble one advances when the time is right, attaining blessings through virtue—what greater fortune could there be? When the time is not ripe, they retreat, yielding with propriety—what greater misfortune could there be? Therefore, though they dwell in poverty and low estate, they still regret nothing, for they hold what is truly precious.\n\nTo advance is not to rejoice in fortune, for virtue is their gain. To fail is not to feel shame, for what cause is there to repent? Their devotion lies in the Dao and righteousness—how could they suffer from mere poverty?\n\nLaozi said: *\"One has the qi of compliance and resistance, which arises from the heart. When the heart is orderly, the qi flows in compliance; when the heart is disordered, the qi resists. The heart’s order or chaos lies in virtue/power (德). To gain the Dao is to order the heart; to lose the Dao is to disorder the heart. An ordered heart brings mutual yielding; a disordered heart brings mutual contention. Yielding is virtue/power; contention breeds thievery. Virtue/power brings compliant qi; thievery spawns resistant qi. To unify the heart is to comply and remain upright; to split the qi is to resist and become perverse. Uprightness elevates the Dao; perversity invites harm.\n\nWhen the Dao endures, the spirit is clear, and clarity brings harmony. When thievery arises, the qi becomes turbid, and turbidity brings contention and chaos. Once turbid and chaotic, destruction comes without delay.\n\nCompliant qi leads one to self-sacrifice for others; resistant qi leads one to harm others for self. The two qi can be governed by the Dao. What cannot be resolved by deeds can be regulated by the Dao. Heaven’s Dao is like the echo that answers sound—virtue accumulated brings blessings, and misdeeds accumulated bring resentment. If humans act in accordance, Heaven can discern it; good and evil intentions are revealed as clearly as reflections in water.\n\nCorruption arises from flourishing corruption; filial piety wanes when children and wives are neglected. Troubles stem from easing worries too soon; illness worsens when desires are unchecked. Thus, one must be as cautious at the end as at the beginning, lest affairs fail.\n\nCorruption fails due to deviation from proper law; filial piety declines when hidden in private matters. Though worries may temporarily ease, one must still fear their recurrence; though illness may briefly abate, restraint of desires remains essential. Therefore, to be as cautious at the end as at the beginning ensures no failure in affairs.\n\nLaozi said: *\"To lift the crooked and make it straight—how could one not gain? To lift the straight and make it crooked, do not comply, lest you share their filth yet differ in your mud.\"* To know others is difficult; to judge them must be clear. Now, if one lifts the crooked as if it were straight and takes the foolish for the wise, how could they share filth while differing in mud?\n\nLaozi said: *\"The sage and the fool share death and life. The sage’s sharing of death and life lies in their understanding of distinctions; the fool’s lies in their ignorance of gain and harm. The sage unifies death and life, neither favoring nor harming either, so they transcend death and life. The fool separates death and life, fixated on gain and loss, thus falling into death and life.\n\nThe Dao originates from Heaven, things are produced by Earth, and harmony resides in humans. Heaven’s qi does not descend, Earth’s qi does not ascend, yin and yang are unbalanced, winds and rains come untimely, and the people suffer from sickness and famine when the ruler is not harmonious.\n\nThe Dao is rooted in Heaven, things are born from Earth, and harmony lies in humans. Humans are Heaven’s essence and Earth’s spirit. Therefore, to rule as a sovereign, one must harmonize the qi, settle all things, and then winds and rains will not err, and calamities will not arise.\n\nLaozi said: *\"To command a hundred thousand soldiers is not as valuable as to hear a single fitting word; to possess the Lord of Hui’s pearl is not as precious as to know the reason for its acquisition; to hold the Heirloom Jade is not as prized as to know the proper use of it. A single beneficial word outweighs a hundred thousand soldiers; a single fitting action surpasses the Heirloom Jade and Lord of Hui’s pearl. Though the world be vast, those who delight in warfare perish; though a nation be secure, those who forget war are in danger. Therefore, small states with few people, though they possess myriad implements, do not use them. Great states do no better than to cultivate virtue/power; small states do no better than to serve their people—then conquest and warfare do not arise, and all ranks dwell in peace.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Those who can become hegemons or kings must be victors; yet they do not oppose without the Dao. Those who can defeat enemies must possess virtue/power; yet without virtue/power, they cannot prevail. Those who can use others’ strength must win their hearts—employing the wise to gain the people’s loyalty. Those who win others’ hearts must also attain self-mastery; self-mastery comes from yielding to those stronger than oneself, yet overcoming those equal or weaker. The victory of yielding surpasses the strength of those equal or weaker—this cannot be measured by ordinary means. Thus, only the sage can use the many’s inability to achieve great victory by preserving humility and yielding.\n\nOnly by preserving humility and yielding can one overcome what the many cannot. Thus, they achieve their great victory.\n\n*End of Volume Four*\n*End of Volume Five of the *Tongxuan Zhenjing* [通玄真经]*」",

      "translated_text": "「The *Master of Literature* from the Song dynasty, **Zhu Bian**, who held the posts of **Chief Clerk of the Grand Court of Justice** and **Magistrate of Jinyun County, Kuizhou**, now annotates the *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power* chapter.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is the inherent principle that pervades all things; **virtue/power** is the comprehensive name for all that is acquired. Moreover, the *Wenzzi* [《文子》] has a total of twelve distinct chapters, yet only the *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power* is repeated—why is this so?\n\nThe **Dao/Way of virtue/power** is the same as the **Dao/Way that can be applied to things**; the virtue/power that arises from what can be spoken of is also the virtue/power that can be relied upon. But this is not the **Ultimate Dao/Way** or the **Mystic Virtue/Power**. Therefore, the first chapter is titled *Dao/Way’s Origin* [《道原》], and the latter *Supreme Virtue/Power* [《上德》]. The former refers to the **root of the Dao/Way**, while the latter denotes the **peak of virtue/power**—this chapter serves as the bridge between the two.\n\nThe essence of **Dao/Way and virtue/power** lies in returning to their natural origins. In the human world, to practice the **Dao/Way**, establish virtue/power, cultivate one’s self, and refine one’s reputation—while living with purpose and dying without decay—there is none like this chapter.\n\nThe *Wenzzi* inquires about the **Dao/Way**. The **Dao/Way** transcends learning; the ultimate principle cannot be questioned. What is queried here is the **Dao/Way of analogical reasoning**.\n\nLaozi said: *\"If one does not master learning and inquiry, one cannot deeply grasp the Dao/Way.\"* Those who study seek to restore their innate nature. By indulging in inquiry, one becomes receptive to answers; by cultivating learning, one reaches the state of *wu xue* [无学, \"beyond learning\"]. If one does not master this, how can they fathom the profound essence?\n\nFor those who listen, the aim is to attain **enlightened wisdom**—the wisdom of the **sage-philosopher**. To cultivate **conduct**—the practice of **benevolence and righteousness**. To achieve **merit and reputation**—the merit of a **worthy minister**. If one does not refine their learning, they will not understand; if they do not delve deeply, they will not grasp. Refined learning leads to clarity; deep inquiry leads to comprehension. Thus, the **superior scholar** listens with **spirit**, the **middle scholar** with **mind**, and the **inferior scholar** with **ear**.\n\nThe **superior scholar** comprehends the **Dao/Way** to attain **enlightened wisdom**; the **middle scholar** appreciates the **Dao/Way** to cultivate **conduct**; the **inferior scholar** wanders in the **Dao/Way** to gain **reputation**. Listening with the **ear** means learning is superficial; listening with the **mind** means learning penetrates to the muscles; listening with the **spirit** means learning reaches the marrow. Shallow and deep are relative.\n\nThus, if one does not listen deeply, their understanding will not be clear; if their understanding is unclear, they cannot exhaust its precision; if they cannot exhaust its precision, their actions will not be sincere. If one does not listen deeply, they lack present clarity—this is the unexcelled state.\n\nHe who does not comprehend within yet acts sincerely without has never been heard of. The principle of listening is to maintain a **vacant and tranquil mind**, diminish one’s **qi** without excess, meaning to **subdue one’s passions to align with the Dao/Way**. To have **no thought, no deliberation**, to **avoid random sight**, and to **avoid indiscriminate hearing**—to restrain both inner and outer faculties and uphold its intent.\n\nTo focus and accumulate with precision, to merge one’s inner intentions fully—once obtained, one must **steadfastly preserve** it and **sustain it enduringly**. To concentrate on what is gained, to have **no divided or wandering thoughts**, then the **nature of clarity** will naturally encompass all principles, exhausting their subtleties. Things cannot alter it; it will always be in harmony with the times.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is the **origin of all things**, giving rise to what has **beginning** and **form**. It begins with **softness and weakness**, yet culminates in **firmness and strength**. It begins as the **Mother of the Dao/Way**, all **qi** being soft and weak; it manifests in **substance and quality**, where nature becomes firm and strong. It begins with **fewness and brevity**, yet becomes **abundance and length**.\n\nThus, **eternal generation** is not few, making it **abundant**; **sustaining life** is not brief, making it **enduring**. A hundred-foot tree begins as a sapling; a thousand-step terrace starts with its foundation. This is the **Dao/Way of Heaven**.\n\nThe **sage** follows it. The **Dao/Way** encompasses the small to make it great; Heaven pairs the lowly to make them high. Observing its **beginning** and its **completion**, one can **revere the subtle origin**. Therefore, the **sage** follows it.\n\nThe **humble** lowers themselves to **gain elevation**; they **honor the lowly** to **attain reverence**. The **retiring** step back to **lead ahead**; they **avoid conflict** to **secure precedence**. The **frugal** embrace **smallness** to **achieve breadth**; their **modest use** leads to **abundance**. The **self-restrained** desire **less** to **attain greatness**; their **cultivation of virtue/power** makes them **vast**.\n\nThis is the **Dao/Way of Heaven** fulfilled. The **Dao/Way of Heaven** diminishes excess and benefits humility; the **sage** conforms to it, naturally achieving **universal benefit**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is the **precedent of virtue/power**; from the **substance of the Dao/Way**, virtue/power is realized. It is the **root of greatness**, the **origin of the Two Polarities** [《两仪》]. It is the **gateway to fortune**, the **means of tranquility**. All things await it to **generate**, await it to **complete**, await it to **rest**.\n\nThey all rely on **nothingness** for this. The **Dao/Way** is **non-action** and **formless**; it does not precede things or leave traces in phenomena. Internally, it cultivates the self; externally, it governs others. When **achievement and conduct** are established, it becomes **neighboring with Heaven**.\n\nHe who practices the **Dao/Way** can **act without doing** yet **accomplish all things**—this meaning has already appeared in the *Dao/Way’s Origin* chapter. Few know its precision; its precision is most true, and within it lies **faith**. It responds to **sensations** and arrives naturally—is this not **faith**?\n\nWhen the **Son of Heaven** [天子] possesses the **Dao/Way**, the **world submits**, and his **reign endures**. The **Dao/Way** is to **adapt to one’s station** and **harmonize accordingly**. Thus, **Emperor Yao** and **Emperor Shun** [尧舜] had it, and their **supreme virtue/power** could be praised. **King Tang** and **King Wu** [汤武] had it, and their **divine achievements** were immortal.\n\nThis is the **Dao/Way that can be spoken of**—is it not so? When the **feudal lords** [诸侯] possess the **Dao/Way**, their **people live in harmony**, and they **do not lose their states**. In ancient times, the **feudal lords** had their **states**.\n\nWhen the **scholar-officials and commoners** [士庶] possess the **Dao/Way**, they **preserve their lives** and **protect their kin**. The **strong and mighty** with the **Dao/Way** **conquer without war**; the **type of Jin and Chu** [晋楚], who possessed the **Dao/Way**, became **hegemons**—not through **outmaneuvering enemies** to **achieve victory**.\n\nThe **weak and small** with the **Dao/Way** **gain without contention**; the **type of Cao and Wei** [曹卫], who possessed the **Dao/Way**, found **allies**—not through **taking the lead** to **secure their position**.\n\nWhen undertaking **actions** with the **Dao/Way**, **achievement is realized**, and **fortune is attained**. Those who **conform to the times** will see their **achievements**; those who **cultivate what is upright** will receive their **fortune**.\n\nBetween **ruler and minister**, the **Dao/Way** manifests as **loyalty and benevolence**—」",

      "translated_text": "The ruler shows benevolence, the minister displays loyalty. Between father and son, the **Dao/Way** manifests as **filial piety and parental kindness**—the father is kind, the son is filial.\n\nFor the common folk, the **Dao/Way** means mutual love, without transgressing proper order, and harmony arises naturally. Thus, the **Dao/Way** brings harmony; its absence brings harshness.\n\nWhen each upholds their **nature and vital essence (xìngmìng)**, even differing customs can be harmonized. If one oversteps their proper station, even kin will turn cruel. How then can families or states without the **Dao/Way** avoid ruin?\n\nFrom this, it is clear that the **Dao/Way** is universally applicable—whether in small or great matters, it is always fitting.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** brings small virtue and small blessings to those who practice it slightly, great virtue and great blessings to those who practice it greatly, and universal submission when practiced fully. Submission leads to affection. Adapt to circumstances and draw from it without exhaustion.\n\nThose who fully embody the **Dao/Way** will have all under Heaven willingly submit to them. Thus, the **Son of Heaven (Emperor)** is what all under Heaven naturally turn toward, while the **King** is what all under Heaven willingly follow. Though \"turn toward\" and \"follow\" may seem similar, they differ in essence—one is the natural alignment of **nature and vital essence**, the other is compelled necessity. Examining their principles, their superiority or inferiority becomes clear.\n\nWithout natural alignment or willing submission, one cannot be called an **Emperor** or **King**. To hold a position without virtue is unfit.\n\nThus, **Emperors and Kings** cannot succeed without the people, nor can they endure if they lose the **Dao/Way**. Having relied on the masses to establish their rule, they must then depend solely on themselves—how can this be sustained?\n\nThose who abandon the **Dao/Way** indulge in extravagance, arrogance, and insolence. They flaunt their excesses, cling to rigid strength, provoke enmity, and lead armies. They take the blame while others reap the credit—this is the state of one who has strayed from the **Dao/Way**.\n\nWhen the common folk act thus, they bring ruin upon themselves—even to execution. When the great act thus, their families and states perish, and nobles lose their domains, while ministers lose their households. The harm may begin with themselves but extends to their descendants.\n\nThus, no crime is greater than abandoning the **Dao/Way**, and no resentment is deeper than lacking virtue—this is the **Way of Heaven**.\n\nThose without the **Dao/Way** defy Heaven; those without virtue oppress all things. Logic dictates that crime and resentment stem from this.\n\n**Laozi** said: *\"The practitioner of the **Dao/Way** makes even the boldest hesitate to strike, and the most skilled fail to hit their mark. They can restrain hostile **qi**, skillfully respond to circumstances, and master the subtle arts of the **Dao/Way**.\"*\n\nEven if one does not strike or hit, if they still suffer humiliation—though unharmed, they are attacked with insults—this is already evident. It is better to make even the boldest dare not strike, the most skilled dare not hit. Through humility and gentleness in self-preservation, boldness cannot overstep. Without provoking conflict, even the cunning cannot prevail.\n\nIf they do not dare, it is not that they lack intent, but that they cannot make others lack intent. It is better to make others naturally lack such intent.\n\nIf one abandons eccentric displays and strange conduct, embracing boundless naturalness and blending with others like waves, then who under Heaven would harbor ill intentions toward them?\n\nIf others lack such intent, it is because they have no desire for gain or harm. It is not that one can make others’ hearts turn toward themselves, but rather that all under Heaven—men and women alike—willingly embrace them with affection and benefit.\n\nThe ultimate function of the **Dao/Way** is to make all under Heaven willingly submit, and all things find their benefit. Thus, even if external threats are repelled, this is still insufficient.\n\nTrue mastery lies in blending with the masses, mingling with the common folk, making oneself the source of their love and benefit, and standing in the realm of **nature and vital essence**—without personal ambition, yet naturally transforming into the wondrous. This is the pinnacle of the **Dao/Way**.\n\nSuch a one needs no title to rule, no office to lead—all under Heaven, from insects upward, naturally seek what benefits them. Thus, without position or authority, they can govern all under Heaven.\n\nBoldness in daring leads to killing; boldness in restraint leads to life. Boldness in striking and piercing kills in the heart; boldness in gentleness and weakness preserves all things through the **Dao/Way**.\n\n**Wénzǐ** asked about **virtue (dé)**, and **Laozi** replied: *\"Nurture and nourish, guide and grow—comprehensively benefiting without partiality, aligning with Heaven and Earth. This is called **virtue**.\"*\n\nHuman life inherently interacts with things externally and engages with affairs internally—harmony with the outside world is unavoidable. Only by internally abandoning love and hatred, and externally transcending gain and loss, can one govern all things without suppression, and transform the myriad realms without obstruction. Without this **Dao/Way**, comprehensive benefit is unattainable.\n\nTo act violently is to lose the inherent harmony of **virtue**—how can one align with **virtue** in a single act?\n\nWhat is **rén (仁, benevolence)**?\n*\"For the ruler, not to boast of achievements; for the subjects, not to shame their flaws—this is not yet complete. Toward the great, not boastful; toward the small, not stingy. Universally loving without partiality, enduring without decay—this is **rén**.\"*\n\nOnly the most refined **nature** can sustain this without decay. Thus, the wise and sagely find it difficult to rank as the foremost of the Five Teachings.\n\nWhat is **yì (义, righteousness)**?\n*\"For the ruler, to assist the weak; for the subjects, to uphold principle. In prosperity, not to overstep; in adversity, not to abandon resolve. Aligning with the **Dao/Way** and principle, without private deviation or perversion—this is **yì**.\"*\n\n**Principle** is correctness. **Unity** is constancy. To make correctness and constancy the standard, without allowing private deviation, is the only way to endure.\n\nWhat is **lǐ (礼, ritual/propriety)**?\n*\"For the ruler, to be reverent and dignified; for the subjects, to be humble and respectful. Retreating, yielding, and maintaining gentleness—being the feminine complement to Heaven under Heaven. Standing firm in what one does not dare, establishing what one cannot—this is **lǐ**.\"*\n\nThis is not merely bowing and ascending in rank. It is inner harmony and outer decorum.\n\nThus, cultivating **virtue** makes the subjects obey; cultivating **rén** makes the subjects not contend; cultivating **yì** makes the subjects fair; cultivating **lǐ** makes the subjects respectful. When all four are cultivated, the state is stable.\n\n**Life** is the **Dao/Way**; **growth** is **virtue**; **love** is **rén**; **correctness** is **yì**; **respect** is **lǐ**.",

**virtue/power**.\n\nWhen one’s **aspirations (志)** align with **Dao/Way** and action,\nthis is **fate (命)**.\nBecause they understand **fate**, they find peace in both adversity and prosperity.\nThus, **life** encounters **fate**, and only then can one act,\n**fate** meets with the right **time (时)**, and only then can one discern its meaning.\nWhen **fate** aligns with

cultivating it,\nthey can preemptively block the seeds of disorder.\n\nThe **Sage** understands the **Dao/Way** of **Heaven** and its auspicious and inauspicious signs,\nand thus knows where misfortune and blessing originate—\nthe **Sage** knows that **lack (不足)** brings auspiciousness,\nwhile **excess (有余)** brings inauspiciousness,\nfor these are the sources of misfortune and blessing.\n\nThus, to guard tranquility is not to act first—\nthe **Sage** does not initiate disturbance.\nThe wise perceive the signs of misfortune and blessing in advance,\nand thus know the gates through which they arise.\nThe wise are not confused by their initial growth,\nand so they avoid sudden and irreversible calamity.\n\nTo hear before it arises is **Sage**ly,\nto see before it forms is wise,\nand to have neither hearing nor seeing is foolish.\n\n**Laozi** said:\nIf a ruler loves knowledge,\nthey will trust the **time** and rely on themselves,\nabandoning **fixed principles (数)** in favor of thought alone.\nThis means trusting the age that confounds them,\nusing it as their own understanding;\ndiscarding the inevitable **fixed principles**,\nand employing only what thought can grasp.\n\nKnowledge is vast, yet wisdom is shallow—\nto govern the vast with shallow wisdom is impossible.\nRelying solely on one’s knowledge,\none will often fail in what is certain.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of things has many proper courses,\nbut wisdom has limits—\nthus, one cannot govern all,\nand many failures ensue.\nLoving knowledge is the **Dao/Way** of exhausting one’s arts,\nloving courage is the **Dao/Way** of peril and ruin.\nThe **Dao/Way** that exhausts one’s arts\nis the **Dao/Way** that leads to ruin.\n\nTo love giving is to have no fixed boundaries—\nbecause they love giving, they lack constancy.\nIf the ruler’s boundaries are not fixed,\nthen the subjects’ expectations know no end—\nwhen the ruler bestows gifts without measure,\nthe subjects hope endlessly in vain.\nIf taxes and levies are excessive,\nthen the ruler becomes the enemy of the people,\nand heavy burdens invert the **Dao/Way** of joy in distribution,\nthus resentment begins as enmity.\n\nTo take little and give much—\nthis is impossible in practice.\nA tax of one-tenth (十一而税)\nwould still fail to meet the unending demands of the state.\n\nThus, to love giving is the **Dao/Way** that invites resentment.\nTo distribute wealth unevenly among the people\ncauses resentment among the officials,\nand to impose heavy taxes on the people\ncauses resentment among the soldiers.\nFrom this, it is clear:\nWhen wealth is insufficient to fulfill its duties,\nthe **Dao/Way** and principles can be illuminated by reflection.\n\n**Wénzǐ** asked:\nHow did the ancient **rulers** govern the world with the **Dao/Way**?\n\n**Laozi** replied:\nHold to **Oneness (一)**, do nothing—\nfollow the transformations of **Heaven** and **Earth**.\n\nTo hold to **Oneness** means to hold to nothing.\nTo do nothing means to dare not act.\nIf one remains thus unassumingly,\nthen they follow the natural disposition of things and govern accordingly,\nand what could be more fitting than to align with

**flexibility**.\n\nTo establish teachings comes from the ruler,\nthus his words are always heeded.\n\nWhen counsel is given and **must** be accepted,\nthe precious thing is to know **flexibility**.\n\nOnly the Sage can truly know **flexibility**—\nhis words are always trusted,\nhis decrees always fulfilled.\n\nWhen words are trusted, the end brings proof,\nwhen decrees are fulfilled, the return ensures harmony.\n\nThe highest conduct in the world—\nto stand upright and defend one’s father,\nto be true and rescue one’s drowning mother—\nwho can truly value this?\n\nA father’s child is seized, and he defends his uprightness;\na mother is drowning, and he fulfills his promise to save—\nif such lofty conduct exists,\nwho would dare to show pity?\n\nThus, the Sage judges the right and wrong of matters,\nand adjusts with them in bending and extending,\nwithout fixed rules or outward forms.\n\nThe Sage follows what is fitting in each circumstance,\nusing it as his model and standard.\nHis actions are for the benefit of the people—\nhow could he be bound by a single moment?\n\nTo **bless** is to honor the ruler,\nto **drown** is to **dishonor** the ancestors and invite retribution.\n\nThe father, compelled by circumstances.\n**Dishonor**, to pull by the hair.\n\nFor the ruler and father’s dignity,\nwhen faced with **blessing** or **drowning**,\nto not honor the ruler is disrespect,\nto not pull by the hair is unfilial.\n\nCircumstances force what is contrary—\nto save what can be saved is all.\n\n**Flexibility** is what only the Sage can truly see.\nThe subtleties of **flexibility** are too refined,\nordinary emotions cannot grasp them.\n\nWhen one first opposes and then aligns—**this** is **flexibility**.\nWhen one first aligns and then opposes—**this** is ignorance of **flexibility**.\nIgnorance of **flexibility** will turn good into shameful.\n\nLet me test this with an argument:\nTo master **flexibility** is to stand between the two realms of **circumstances** and **opportunity**.\n\nBefore **circumstances** arise, one must consider **opportunity**;\nafter **opportunity** is seized, one must act.\n**Circumstances** lie in the matter,\n**opportunity** lies in the heart.\n\nOnly **flexibility** can internally awaken **opportunity**,\nexternally control **circumstances**,\nand uphold the proper **Dao/Way** and teachings\nwhile ensuring that later compliance and prior opposition\nfully realize the **Way** of perfect adaptation.\n\nThe ruler has his **principles**,\nactions have their **advantages** and **disadvantages**—\nto let the people act as if by nature,\nwhile they remain unaware of the reasoning behind it.\n\nThus, the *Book of Changes* praises the **reverence** of **gentle adaptability**,\nand the *Book of Songs* extols the **virtue** of **chastity and splendor**—\nwho but the Sage’s wisdom\ncould alone perceive this?\n\nIf **opportunity** and **circumstances** are not handled carefully,\nthey will harm oneself.\n\nIf **flexibility** is not applied appropriately,\ngood will turn to shame—\nhow can one not be cautious?\n\nWenzi asked:\n\"Master, your teachings say\nthat without **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**,\none cannot govern the world.\nYet rulers of ancient times,\nfollowing the legacy of their predecessors,\nalso had those without **Dao/Way**\nwho perished in their own era\nwithout facing ruin—\nhow does **Dao/Way** explain this?\"\n\nWhat is called\n**\"falling\"** the **virtue/power** of ancestors,\nwhile still avoiding ruin in one’s own time—\nit is because earlier generations had such cases.\n\nThus, I could not help but raise this question,\nto warn rulers of later generations\nwho doubt the **Dao/Way**.\n\nLaozi said:\n\"From the Son of Heaven down to the common people,\neach lives as they please,\nyet their lives vary in richness.\nIn the world, there are times of fallen kingdoms and ruined families—\n**this** is not due to lack of **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**.\n\nWhen one says there are those who perish in their own time\nwithout facing ruin,\nit is only because of the **thickness** of their **fate**.\n\nYet when kingdoms fall and families ruin,\nnone escape without losing **Dao/Way** first.\n\nDay and night without rest,\ntrembling and fearful,\nalways dreading danger and fall—\nthose who have **families** and **kingdoms**,\ntruly must be cautious like this,\nthus it is said:\n'You stand before your ancestors,\nlike a rotting rope guiding six galloping horses.'\n\nIf one indulges desires and neglects duty,\ntheir fall will come without delay—\n**this** is simply impossible to preserve.\n\nEven if **Jie** and **Zhou** practiced **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**,\nthough **Tang** and **Wu** were wise,\nthey would have no foundation for their achievements.\n\nIn the decline of **Xia** and **Yin**,\nit was not only **Jie** and **Zhou** who lost **Dao/Way**—\nyet some perished in their own time\nwithout immediate ruin,\nthough there were differences in **fate**,\nall shared the same cause of destruction.\n\nIf those two rulers had relied on **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**,\nthen how could **Tang** and **Wu** have established their achievements?\n\nIt is rare for one who loses **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** to escape ruin,\nbut none who uphold **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** invite disaster.\n\n**Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** are what\nnurtures and sustains life,\nwhat fosters growth and longevity,\nwhat brings mutual affection,\nwhat earns reverence and honor.\n\nThe **virtue/power** of **Dao/Way**’s nurturing,\nthe beauty of **respect** and **love**,\nare established from here.\n\nEven a deaf worm, though foolish,\ndoes not harm what it loves—\nif the people of the world\nall harbored hearts of **benevolence**,\nhow could calamities arise?\n\nThe world is full of deaf and foolish beings—\nare they not like crawling insects?\nYet they can still avoid harm and seek benefit\nto suit their own nature,\nthen the emotions of the people\ncan surely be understood.\n\nIf one truly follows the **Dao/Way** and **transforms** through **virtue/power**,\nevoking the hearts of mutual affection,\nthe roots of calamities will have no cause to arise.\n\nThose without **Dao/Way** yet without ruin—\n**benevolence** has not yet vanished,\n**righteousness** has not yet perished.\nBecause **benevolence** has not vanished,\nthe **virtue/power** of mutual affection remains;\nbecause **righteousness** has not perished,\nthe **virtue/power** of mutual support remains—\nthough in danger, they are not yet destroyed.\n\nEven if **benevolence** has not vanished,\nand **righteousness** has not perished,\nthe feudal lords already disdain their ruler.\n\nWhen feudal lords disdain their ruler,\nthe court becomes disrespectful,\neven if it does not rebel outright.\n\nThe utmost **reverence** and **obedience** lie in\n**responding** to the ruler’s **virtue/power**.\n\nWhen **benevolence** vanishes and **righteousness** perishes,\nthe feudal lords rebel,\nthe common people rise in force,\nthe strong oppress the weak,\nthe great encroach on the small—\nthe people make violence their occupation,\ndisasters multiply,\ncalamities arise—\ntheir fall will come without delay,\nhow could they hope to avoid ruin?\n\nWhen **Dao/Way** is lost, **virtue/power** is abandoned;\nwhen **virtue/power** is lost, one clings to **benevolence**;\nwhen **benevolence** vanishes, **righteousness** upholds;\nwhen **righteousness** perishes, the kingdom falls.\n\n**This** is how ruin comes—\na gradual process,\nall contributing to disaster.\n\nThus, when one loses **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**,\nthere will be disdain for the ruler and defiance of commands.\n\nFollowing the loss of **benevolence** and **righteousness**,\nthere will be fear of kingdom’s fall and personal humiliation.\n\nYet one’s body has its **fate** of richness or thinness,\na kingdom has its **destiny** of danger or ruin—\nthose with **thick** **fate** may endure danger throughout their lives,\nthose with **thin** **fate** will face ruin at the proper time.\n\nExamining the root cause,\nnone escape without losing **Dao/Way**.\n\nLaozi said:\n\"When laws are excessive and punishments severe,\nthe people resort to deceit.\nWhen the ruler is overburdened with

affairs, then affairs cease.\nBut if one uses affairs to stop affairs,\nthe halted affairs resurge anew.\nTo stop the affairs that generate them\nonly to spawn the affairs that were halted—\nthis is like fanning fire to seek non-burning\nyet only to burn more.\n\n**Wisdom** generates calamity—\nmeaning the wise generate lesser calamities.\nYet they also counter it with wisdom,\nlike agitating water and hoping it will remain clear.\n\nWhen the ruler abandons cleverness,\nthe people preserve their nature whole.\nThe root of calamity lies in manifold schemes—\nonce calamity arises from wisdom,\nthen wisdom is again employed to prevent it.\nYet the way of natural clarity, undisturbed, is far beyond this.\n\nLaozi said:\n\"If a ruler favors benevolence,\nthen the unmeritorious are rewarded,\nand the guilty are pardoned;\nif he favors punishment,\nthen the meritorious are discarded,\nand the innocent are ensnared.\nFor benevolence uses compassion as its merit,\nand punishment uses blame as its function—\nif one has preferences,\nthen rewards and punishments become excessive and indiscriminate,\nand cannot govern the myriad people.\"\n\nLet us examine this:\n**Dao/Way** is the most precious of all things.\nAffairs are all accomplished through what one favors.\nYet if one establishes preferences to seek **Dao/Way**,\nthen preference remains in the heart,\nwhile **Dao/Way** is abandoned in what is sought,\nand thus contradicts its own principle.\n\nIt is also said:\n\"Those who do not lose **virtue/power** are thus without **virtue/power**.\"\nMoreover, **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**—\nthese cannot be achieved by favoring one alone,\nlet alone by partiality toward lesser matters\nto govern the world.\n\nWithout favor or aversion,\none punishes

who harmonizes and unifies is the ruler;\nunifying all in harmony rests with one person.\nWhat differentiates and distinguishes is law.\nThe offender naturally faces varying degrees of penalty—\nthis is the constant law of the state.\nThe people receive punishment without harboring resentment,\nthe ruler shows no partiality,\nand clears the world of guilt—\nthen those who meet punishment gladly accept their fault,\nwithout blame or grudge.\nThis is called **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**.\n\nOnly then does the state have the **Dao/Way** of great peace,\nand the ruler possess **virtue/power** without self-interest.\n\nLaozi said:\n\"The world’s right and wrong cannot be fixed—\neach age upholds what it deems good\nand rejects what it deems evil.\nWhat you deem evil, others may deem good,\nand what you deem good, others may deem evil—\nthis is not a public standard,\nso it cannot be fixed.\n\nThose who seek what is right do not seek **Dao/Way**,\nbut follow the principles of **Dao/Way**—\nthen all things are mysteriously unified, and nothing is wrong.\nTo seek what aligns with oneself is not to reject externality,\nbut to reject what contradicts the heart.\nIf one merely seeks alignment,\nthen partiality attaches to things—\nhow can this be called rejecting evil?\nOne only removes what is hated.\n\nNow, if I wish to choose what is right and dwell in it,\nand reject

others,\nwill there not be those who, because of my non-conformity,\nwill instead hold my correctness against me?\n\nIf I hastily flee with the customs,\nI am like one escaping rain—\nthere is no

possession.\nKnowing how to unite all living beings,\nnothing escapes its proper order.\n\nYet the essence of supreme virtue\npenetrates everywhere—\nhence this chapter’s blend of inclusiveness and emptiness.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe ruler is the heart of the state,\nthe source of its survival or ruin.\nWhen the heart is at ease, all functions align;\nwhen the heart is agitated, all functions falter.\nThe body’s hundred limbs\nare like the state’s hundred offices.\n\nThus, when the body is in order,\nits limbs act without deliberation;\nwhen the state is in order,\nruler and ministers forget their roles.\nWhen limbs act naturally, they find their own ease.\nThus, one forgets what one serves—\nruler and ministers fulfill their roles without effort,\nand so forget their origins.\n\nLaozi’s teacher, *Changshu*,\ntaught: *\"See the tongue and hold to gentleness.\"*\nTeeth are hard, the tongue is soft—\nwhat is rigid perishes first.\nThus, softness is advantageous—\nthis is what should be upheld.\n\nGazing upward at the house’s beams,\nthen withdrawing to gaze at the river—\nsoft branches rise to the roof’s height,\nweak materials occupy the uppermost places.\nThus, one elevates what is before one’s eyes,\nmaking humility a mirror of retreat.\n\nObserving one’s shadow to know how to follow—\nwhat moves behind never strays from propriety,\nlike a shadow following form,\nunbound by tilt or turn,\nfor it does not contend with things—\nthus it remains constant.\n\nHence, the sage embraces emptiness and follows naturally,\nalways yielding yet never leading—\nlike stacked firewood, where the last placed rests above.\nThis is called *\"fulfilling virtue to achieve function.\"*\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"The bell’s sound destroys itself,\nthe candle’s light consumes itself,\nthe tiger’s stripes invite arrows,\nthe monkey’s agility invites capture—\nthus, the valiant die by strength,\nthe eloquent are ensnared by cleverness.\nThese all perish by their own advantages.\nThough one may know cleverness,\none does not know the advantage of not-knowing.\nOnly those who possess cleverness\nfail to grasp the use of not-knowing.\nThus, the bold in one skill,\nthe skilled in one argument,\ncan be led astray with partial truths—\nbut cannot respond to myriad transformations.\nOnly those who do not rely on cleverness,\nwho do not dare to act by skill,\ncan meet all changes.\"*\n\n**Dao/Way** is formless—\nseen, it has no shape;\nheard, it has no sound.\nIt is called *\"profound and obscure.\"*\nThis term describes **Dao/Way**,\nyet is not **Dao/Way** itself.\n\nThe wondrous origin enters the boundless—\nnever for an instant separated from all things.\nIts essence is profound and dim,\nits function manifest and clear.\nThough named with force,\nit claims no dominion.\n\n**Dao/Way** is inward reflection—\nabandoning desire, returning to simplicity,\none finds clarity naturally.\nWhen one finds clarity,\nthe world finds its own.\n\nThus, one is neither slightly awake\nnor deeply lost,\nneither slightly wise\nnor utterly foolish.\nOnly those who cling to knowledge\nfail to return to the vastness of not-knowing.\n\nDo not mirror the flowing stream—\nmirror the still water,\nfor it preserves its stillness without disturbance.\nOnly those who do not let things disturb the heart\ncan then respond to all things.\n\nThe moon wanes when the sun rises—\nopposing vigor with stillness,\nstillness must be complete.\nOnly those without rivals can remain still.\n\nYin does not override yang,\nlow does not transgress high—\nonly then can one preserve its proper place.\nWhen the sun rises, stars vanish—\nthey cannot contend with its light.\nGreat virtue in the world\nhumbly conceals lesser virtue.\n\nThe end cannot surpass the root,\nthe branch cannot exceed the trunk—\nheavy above, light below—\nits fall is inevitable.\n\nIf one seeks to dominate the heart,\nmovement will bring ruin.\nOne pool cannot hold two dragons,\none female cannot mate with two males—\none is fixed, two contend.\nThus, opposites cannot dwell together—\nonly the victorious are settled.\n\nJade in the mountains makes grass and trees lush,\npearls in the depths keep the shores moist—\n**Dao/Way** in the center harmonizes all forms.\n\nThe earthworm, lacking strong bones or sharp claws,\nfeeds on dry

deceived—refined in perception.\n　　Who would then complain or grieve?\n　　Gold’s strength surpasses wood—\n　　Yet one blade cannot harm an entire forest;\n　　Earth’s strength surpasses water—\n　　Yet one dipper cannot dam a river;\n　　Water’s strength surpasses fire—\n　　Yet one sip cannot extinguish a cartload of fuel.\n　　Though one holds the means to control,\n　　If their virtue and power are insufficient,\n　　It is as if they gain no benefit at all.\n\n　　Winter’s thunder, summer’s hail,\n　　Cold and heat do not alter their seasons;\n　　Frost and snow descend in abundance,\n　　Yet melt when the sun rises.\n　　Before the winter solstice, the yang-qi descends and forms thunder;\n　　Before the summer solstice, the yin-qi ascends and congeals into hail.\n　　Even in the months of extreme cold or heat,\n　　Their changes are never entirely cut off.\n　　If frost and snow are applied to them,\n　　They will vanish with the sun’s light—\n　　This is what is called *inner necessity* (*zhōng yǒu bìrán*), which cannot be externally controlled;\n　　*Seasonal necessity* (*shí yǒu bìzhì*), which cannot be altered by things.\n　　Only the wise and enlightened discern this for proper application.\n\n　　Tilt easily topples, lean easily adheres;\n　　A slight push aids, moisture easily brings rain.\n　　Thus, the virtuous act accordingly and pass on their teachings—\n　　Their methods are simple yet effective.\n\n　　The orchid’s fragrance thrives,\n　　Yet if it does not see frost,\n　　It withers in the midst of its prime—\n　　How could those of talent not be cautious?\n\n　　The toad repels soldiers,\n　　Its lifespan ending on the fifth month’s full moon.\n　　If taken at the halfway point of the fifth month and burned,\n　　It can repel soldiers but its poison harms—\n　　This is talent being harmed by misuse.\n　　Is it not said that one can be divine in things yet fail to divine themselves?\n　　Such as the white tortoise dreaming in the Song and Yuan courts—\n　　How lamentable!\n\n　　Those whose *qi* is dissipated are prone to inner decay,\n　　Whose actions invite external harm.\n　　Fruits out of season are inedible.\n　　Even if they possess their own vitality and luster,\n　　They can disrupt my natural constitution.\n\n　　Which comes first to ruin—the tongue or the teeth?\n　　Which is straight—the bowstring or the arrow?\n　　The teeth, being rigid, wear first;\n　　The arrow, being straight, bends first.\n　　What is supple and yielding preserves the virtue of rigidity and straightness.\n\n　　Shadows distort form,\n　　Echoes distort voice—\n　　One must guard their roots.\n\n　　To treat the dead as if they were alive is no good physician,\n　　To serve a fallen kingdom as if it were still standing is no loyal counselor.\n　　Thus, a ruler must be open to medicinal advice.\n\n　　When discussing difficulties,\n　　One can still enforce strict discipline and refine the *qi* to overcome them;\n　　When the proper course is impossible,\n　　One may combine expedients and adapt to changes to assist.\n　　No material is wasted, no principle abandoned—\n　　Seizing intent and harmonizing meaning may lie therein.\n\n　　Therefore, the saying: *\"A ruler governs ministers, ministers serve the ruler—\n　　Each must be cautious in their approach.\"*\n　　If one commands the *chāngchuí* flute yet lacks control,\n　　The ruler’s authority will perish.\n　　*Què*—to fix or determine.\n　　One cannot fix the pitch of music.\n\n　　If a ruler and minister violate proper order,\n　　Or if one usurps political authority,\n　　Even if the punishments are correct,\n　　They cannot be properly enforced.\n　　If one examines positions and laws accordingly,\n　　This is called *\"ruler’s punishments\"*—double gain.\n\n　　The deaf cannot sing to find joy,\n　　The blind cannot observe to engage with the world—\n　　Yet when the heart has its expectations,\n　　Form and sound naturally arise.\n　　Thus, calming the heart means nothing external remains.\n\n　　Walking through the woods cannot follow a straight path,\n　　Treading on perilous ground cannot measure a plumb line.\n　　To be entangled with things is to invite disorder,\n　　To confront calamity is to risk harm.\n　　Yet if one walks through the woods or treads on perilous ground,\n　　How could they then traverse the smooth, abandoned paths,\n　　Or wander the wide, straight avenues?\n\n　　The sea encompasses all within its domain,\n　　Thus it is vast—\n　　This is the virtue of containing all things.\n　　He who does not close their ears and eyes yet embraces sounds and colors,\n　　Who does not lock away their true nature to level all dangers and risks,\n　　Such a person’s Dao aligns with the sea’s capacity—\n　　They embody the virtue of harmonious reception and transformation.\n\n　　The sun does not rise twice in one day,\n　　The fox does not have two lords,\n　　The divine dragon does not pair,\n　　The fierce beast does not gather in groups,\n　　The rapacious bird does not fly in twos.\n　　The virtue of a single ruler,\n　　The singularity of one application,\n　　Still lacks equal or match—\n　　How much more so the Dao of the Sage and the grand transformations,\n　　The singular achievements of their solitary operations?\n\n　　It is not the *liáo* whisk that can obscure the sun,\n　　Nor the *fú* spokes that can outrun swiftness—\n　　Yet even these are not sufficient to rely upon.\n　　All who can influence things\n　　Do so through relative means—\n　　Verification comes from reality,\n　　And this is not enough to depend on.\n　　Thus, the Sage aids the world and benefits its use,\n　　Extending their influence through things,\n　　Riding the momentum while relying on people,\n　　Accomplishing deeds and claiming their rewards.\n\n　　Drawing the bow to shoot,\n　　The string alone cannot release the arrow—\n　　Yet only one in ten strikes its mark.\n　　If shooting aims to hit,\n　　Why shoot if it does not?\n　　A hundred shots, one hit—\n　　Success and failure cancel each other out.\n　　Yet all under heaven build their achievements thus—\n　　They forget their repeated failures,\n　　Only celebrating their one success,\n　　Is this not absurd in balancing reality and expedience?\n\n　　A hungry horse in the stable\n　　Is silent and still;\n　　Yet when hay is placed beside it,\n　　Its competitive spirit awakens.\n　　The nature of blood and *qi* is never without desire—\n　　Thus, when nothing desirable is seen,\n　　The heart does not stir into conflict.\n\n　　A three-inch flute cannot reach its full potential,\n　　Yet the world cannot be filled by it alone;\n　　Ten stones may suffice to block,\n　　Yet a hundred bamboos are needed to reinforce.\n　　The petty-minded have narrow ambitions,\n　　Ever unsatisfied and never fulfilled;\n　　The noble-minded possess spacious virtue,\n　　Dividing what is needed and finding sufficiency.\n\n　　Following the plumb line to cut does not exceed,\n　　Using the balance scale to measure does not err—\n　　Yet if one upholds the Dao directly,\n　　They will not exceed right and wrong;\n　　If one applies virtue evenly,\n　　They will not err in thickness or thinness.\n　　To lean on ancient laws and categories,\n　　Sometimes proves effective,\n　　Yet to rely solely on rigid standards,\n　　Sometimes fails.\n　　To govern the present while adhering to ancient laws and standards,\n　　Though the plumb line and balance may align,\n　　Still cannot definitively settle the world—\n　　Only those who discern the times and know adaptation can.\n\n　　To act thus is called *duàn* (judgment),\n　　To act otherwise is called *luàn* (disorder).」",

to rise, the higher talent will not easily be gained.\nThe circumstances differ in their application.\n\nWith the same six *chi* of material,\nYet differing in where the circumstances are applied,\nThen difficulty and ease become separated,\nAnd distinctions between high and low arise.\nThus, the virtuous avoid dwelling in the lowly stream,\nAnd strive endlessly to strengthen themselves.\n\nThe assistant to the sacrificial rites gains a taste,\nThe one who rescues a drowning man gets hurt—\nThose who aid in both good and evil,\nStill suffer harm or benefit from it themselves.\nThus, their own consequences are clear enough.\n\nCovered by an unlucky tree,\nIt is struck by thunder and lightning.\nIf one loses their proper foundation,\nEven without encountering

application of enlightenment lies in its transformative power.\nThe enlightenment applied must first transform those below.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is *wen* (pattern),\nThe Dao of Earth is *li* (principle).\nThe patterns of stars and constellations,\nThe principles of rivers and streams—\nOne unifies them in harmony,\nTime governs their shifts,\nThus all things are completed—\nThis is called the Dao.\n\nQi unifies to generate life,\nThe four seasons faithfully nurture growth.\nPushing through transformations of myriad forms,\nThis is the Dao of the Celestial Sovereign.\n\nThe Great Dao is vast and near—\nThe body, a thing of Heaven and Earth,\nHow could it not be the Dao?\n\nCultivate it within the self,\nAnd virtue becomes true.\nIf one follows naturally and accepts fate,\nUnknowingly aligning with the true essence,\nThen virtue arises spontaneously.\n\nCultivate it in things,\nAnd virtue will never cease.\nThrough expansive interaction with all things,\nFollowing their inherent principles,\nAnd thus aligning with the boundless nature of all things,\nVirtue cannot be constrained.\n\nHeaven covers all things,\nBestowing its virtue to nourish them,\nGiving without taking—\nThus, spirit returns to it.\n\nThe master of nourishment is none other than Heaven’s virtue.\nYet without form, it binds all things—\nHow could it be externally imposed?\n\nSpirit is initially endowed with lightness and clarity,\nThus Heaven possesses virtue without virtue—\nThis is why it is exalted.\nSpirit has the capacity for emptiness and openness—\nThis is why it is honored.\nTo honor and return to the exalted is natural,\nAs things follow their kind.\n\nTo give without taking is the virtue of the exalted—\nThus, it possesses virtue.\nWithout trace yet achieving success,\nWithout virtue yet residing above—\nNothing is higher than Heaven,\nNothing is lower than the marsh.\nHeaven is high, the marsh is low—\nThe Sage follows this,\nEstablishing order of high and low,\nThus the world is settled.\n\nThe marsh should be like the Earth.\nThe Sage follows Heaven and Earth,\nOrdering high and low,\nThus ruler and subject, father and son,\nEach fulfill their proper roles—\nAncient and modern, unchanging,\nThis is called Great Stability.\n\nEarth nourishes and sustains all things,\nGiving and taking—\nThus bones and flesh return to it.\n\nHeaven has the form of sustaining all things,\nEarth has the virtue of providing resources,\nYet when it comes to binding all things,\nWhere does it claim its function?\n\nBones and flesh are initially heavy and turbid,\nUltimately returning to the clods of earth—\nThus Earth has the trace of enduring virtue—\nThis is why it is lowly.\nBones and flesh suffer from stagnation and obstruction—\nThis is why they are base.\nTo base and return to the lowly is natural,\nAs things follow their kind.\n\nTo give and take is the virtue of the lowly—\nThe lowly virtue does not lose virtue,\nThus it has no virtue.\nFully achieving traceable results,\nIt is not the position of exalted virtue—\nThus the Sage’s mysterious virtue aligns with Heaven,\nAnd established virtue aligns with Earth.\n\nEarth supports Heaven,\nThus stability and peace endure.\nEarth is stable and peaceful,\nThus all things take form—\nForm is like birth and growth.\nEarth is vast and thick,\nThus all things gather upon it.\nStability and peace hold nothing unborne,\nVastness and thickness contain nothing unheld.\nEarth’s depth and thickness gather waters and streams,\nEarth’s Dao is broad and square—\nThus it endures.\nBroadness holds great forests,\nSquareness embodies great virtue.\nThe Sage follows this,\nThus virtue contains all things.\nLowliness draws things to it,\nPeace brings self-possession.\n\nWhen Yin harms things, Yang withdraws,\nAnd if Yin advances while Yang retreats,\nThe petty gain influence,\nThe virtuous avoid harm—\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\nMotion and stillness have their times,\nThus to defy Heaven brings great calamity.\n\nWhen Yang-qi moves, all things relax and find their place—\nThus the Sage follows the Dao of Yang.\nTo act in accordance with the times,\nOne can achieve desires without contradiction.\n\nTo follow things, things will follow in return;\nTo oppose things, things will oppose in return.\nTo transform thoroughly, things will not differ;\nIf things differ from me, transformation is incomplete.\nThus, one does not lose the nature and disposition of things.\n\nWhen the marsh overflows, all things grow without measure;\nThings have their inherent nature as their proper form,\nAnd their proper time as their disposition.\nTo govern and teach without losing these two,\nThen all things will flourish with nourishment,\nAll will be trustworthy and mature.\n\nWhen the marsh dries up, all things wither without leaves—\nTheir blossoms and flowers do not appear at their proper times.\nThus, if rains do not fall in season,\nThe world falls into ruin and chaos—\nMountains without paths,\nOppression and neglect,\nThen the people do not bear grain,\nAnd chaos and flight ensue.\n\nYang ascends yet returns below,\nThus it is the master of all things.\nHigh in position yet humble in virtue.\nHighness makes things reverent,\nHumility makes things affectionate—\nThus it can be their master.\n\nNot overreaching possession,\nThus it can end and begin anew.\nIts Dao wanes and flourishes,\nThus it does not reach exhaustion.\nEnding and beginning anew,\nThus it endures—\nThus it is the Mother of the world.\nTo be the Mother of the world,\nWithout this virtue, how could it be?\n\nYang-qi accumulates before it can be bestowed,\nYin-qi accumulates before it can transform—\nThere is none who can transform without accumulation.\nIf one’s own essence is not complete,\nOne cannot establish affairs—\nHow much more to govern all things?\nThus the Sage is cautious in what is accumulated.\nOnly by accumulating virtue and achieving harmony\nCan one be capable of transforming the world.\n\nWhen Yang extinguishes Yin, all things thrive;\nWhen Yin extinguishes Yang, all things decline.\nThus, if kings and nobles uphold the Dao of Yang,\nThe people will flourish—\nMeaning harmonious qi nourishes the people.\nIf they uphold the Dao of Yin, the world will perish—\nMeaning killing qi destroys the state.\n\nIf

superiors.\n\nWhen fire emerges, it must have fuel,\nWhen a person speaks, their words must be true.\nWith truth and sincerity, what cannot be accomplished?\nFire depends on fuel, speech on truth—\nThus they blaze and flourish.\n\nIf one follows teachings with constancy,\nAnd remains true without wavering,\nAll endeavors shall succeed.\n\nThe Yellow River runs deep, its destruction lies in the mountains;\nHigh hills descend into the abyss—\nThe principle is already evident above.\n\nWhen *yang* qi prevails, it transforms into *yin*;\nWhen *yin* qi prevails, it transforms into *yang*.\nThus, desire cannot be overfilled,\nNor joy pushed to its extreme.\nExcess leads to ruin,\nExtremity invites reversal.\n\nAnger without harsh words,\nRage without showing color—\nThis is called *calculating success*.\n\nTo discern the way of retaliation,\nYet not to provoke blame by striking first—\nThis is called *securing safety through strategy*.\n\nFire ascends, water descends;\nThe Sage’s Way seeks its kind—\nThough myriad things may stray,\nThose sharing its principle shall all be found.\n\nThe Sage, relying on *yang*, brings harmony to the world;\nRelying on *yin*, brings stagnation and drowning.\nThe *yang* Way nurtures and flourishes,\nThe *yin* Way is stern and destructive.\nIf virtue and blessings are spread widely,\nThe people shall be harmonious and content;\nIf only the harsh ways of Chu are employed,\nThe people shall sink in misery.\n\nLaozi said:\nThin layers accumulate into thickness,\nLow steps rise to heights.\nNoble conduct and profound virtue arise from steady cultivation,\nWhile initial shame and grave errors stem from repeated transgressions.\nThe virtuous strive earnestly to achieve brilliance,\nThe petty indulge recklessly to invite disgrace.\nEarnest self-strengthening builds virtue daily;\nReckless indulgence in desires leads to self-ruin.\nThe difference lies in what is accumulated.\n\nThough its rise and fall may not be immediately visible,\nThe virtuous heart does not waver in its constancy.\nThe Way of rise and fall lies in emulating goodness and uprightness,\nAdvancing swiftly toward brilliance from the start.\nThus, seeing goodness as if unable to catch up,\nTreating evil as if facing calamity.\nWitnessing virtuous deeds, one hastens to follow;\nEncountering vice, one acts as if in disaster.\nIf one turns toward goodness, even exceeding bounds brings no regret;\nThose who follow the Way, though blamed by others,\nShall bear no resentment toward them.\nFor the virtuous Way has its unchanging practice.\n\nIf one does not turn toward goodness,\nEven loyalty may turn to evil—\nWithout an inherent inclination toward virtue,\nEven if others are loyal, there shall be times of betrayal;\nThough they bring harm, resentment shall arise toward them.\nYet, people and I have mutual expectations,\nAnd constancy in virtue is not easily maintained.\nTo blame others for their inconstancy is unjust.\n\nThus, those who harbor resentment do not blame themselves,\nFor resentment stems from one’s own actions—\nWhy accuse others?\nSeeking virtue in others is less fruitful than seeking it within.\nSelf-mastery ensures all else is obtained—\nWhy rely on others?\nThus, reputation is self-summoned,\nKindred spirits seek one another,\nFame is self-bestowed,\nAnd position is self-assumed—\nNone of it comes from outside oneself.\n\nSelf-assumed position refers to the rank befitting wisdom or folly.\nWielding sharpness to strike, wielding blades to attack—\nWhy blame others?\nHarming others invites retaliation;\nResentment is self-inflicted.\nThus, the virtuous must guard against the subtle beginnings.\n\nAll things bear *yin* while embracing *yang*,\nTheir harmonizing *qi* forming unity.\nWhen the two *qi* blend in balance, it is called *he*.\nThough things may face *yin* or turn toward *yang*,\nTheir vital essence receives harmony.\n*Harmony* resides centrally—\nThus, grains grow in the heart,\nGrasses bear fruit in their stalks,\nFor stalks are the heart of grasses.\nEggs and fetuses form in the center,\nAll born from *harmony* dwelling centrally.\nThough their natures differ,\nThey all receive *qi* and kindred essence\nFrom *harmony*’s central abode.\n\nThose not born from eggs or wombs\nRequire time to gestate,\nMoistened and dried by seasonal shifts to take form—\nThey too arise with *harmony*.\n\nWhen the earth is level, water does not flow;\nWhen light and heavy are balanced, the scale does not tilt.\nAll things’ transformations arise from response.\nWhen *yang* prevails, life emerges;\nWhen *yin* prevails, death ensues.\nLike water in the crossroads,\nIt tilts with each stimulus—\nAttaining *zhonghe* (central harmony),\nIt remains balanced and upright.\n\nLaozi said:\nMountains reach their height, and clouds and rain gather there;\nWaters reach their depth, and dragons take form within.\nThe Sage cultivates the Way,\nAnd virtue flows from it.\nThe Way’s height and depth\nNaturally spread blessings.\n\nThose with hidden virtue shall receive manifest reward,\nThose with concealed deeds shall earn renowned name.\nHidden virtue lacks artifice—\nThis is the truest virtue.\nConcealed deeds seek nothing—\nThis is the most genuine conduct.\nWhen both true and real,\nEven if rewards remain unseen and names unproclaimed,\nThey cannot be withheld.\n\nHe who plants millet reaps not barley,\nHe who sows resentment reaps none in return.\nPlant millet, harvest millet;\nSow resentment, reap

      "translated_text": "The Master Laozi said:\n\nNow, take the driver of a cart:\nHe calls *\"Yā!\"* and *\"Chuò!\"* from the front,\nAnd the sound is answered.\nThe rear also responds in kind—\nThis is the driver’s song urging strength.\nThough the music of Zheng, Wei, Hu, and Chu\nMay differ in tone,\nNone surpasses this in its purpose.\n\nGoverning a state relies on *rites* (礼),\nNot on eloquence or argument.\nWhen laws and decrees grow excessive,\nThieves and bandits multiply.\nThe proper use of things must fit their purpose,\nEach must serve its role—\nLike the driver’s song urging strength,\nYet it would be misplaced to play with the music of Xianchi.\nWhy trouble with ornate speech\nWhen governing a state and calming the people\nRequires only the elevation of simplicity and plainness?\n\nThe Master Laozi said:\n*The Way* has no fixed form yet can be the standard,\nLike mountains and forests that can yield materials—\nMaterials do not encompass mountains and forests,\nMountains and forests do not encompass clouds and rains,\nClouds and rains do not encompass yin and yang,\nYin and yang do not encompass harmony,\nAnd harmony does not encompass *The Way*.\n*The Way* is the formless form, the symbol without substance—\nWithout understanding its intent,\nOne cannot transform and refine between heaven and earth.\n*The Way* has no fixed form,\nYet fixed forms arise from *The Way*,\nJust as materials do not encompass mountains and forests,\nYet mountains and forests yield materials.\nFrom clouds and rains downward,\nThose who speak of what does not encompass *The Way*\nDo so because it is formless and symbol-less,\nYet it embraces all things and encompasses all *Dao* (方).\nOnly those who embody *The Way*\nKnow its boundless transformations.\n\nThe Master Laozi said:\nThe Sage establishes teachings and implements governance,\nYet must observe their beginning and end,\nAnd discern their underlying *virtue/power* (造恩).\n*Constructing virtue/power* means creating laws and teachings.\nThus, when the people know writing, *virtue/power* declines,\nWhen they know calculation, benevolence declines,\nWhen they know bonds and contracts, trust declines,\nWhen they know tools and devices, substance declines.\nThese four arise only after *The Way* has been lost,\nAnd measures are established according to the times.\nThe stricter the measures become,\nThe more they are violated—\nThus, trust and sincerity decline,\nAnd cunning and deceit flourish.\n\nThe zither does not sound,\nYet its twenty-five strings each respond with their own tone;\nThe axle does not turn by itself,\nYet its thirty spokes each exert their force in rotation.\nStrings have slackness and tightness,\nOnly then can they produce melody;\nCarts have labor and rest,\nOnly then can they reach distant places.\nThose who make sound do so without sound,\nThose who make turning do so without turning—\nThe zither has no sound,\nYet sound resides in the strings;\nThe axle does not turn,\nYet turning resides in the wheels.\nThus, there is sound without sound,\nAnd turning without turning—\nOnly then can melody be produced,\nOnly then can distant places be reached.\n\nHigh and low follow different *Dao* (道):\nIf *The Way* is great yet the position is low, it brings disaster;\nIf *The Way* is small yet the task is great, it brings ruin.\nA cap cannot be worn on the feet,\nA subject cannot be honored above his lord.\nWhen high and low are disordered,\nRuination comes without delay.\n\nSmall *virtue/power* harms righteousness,\nSmall goodness harms *The Way*,\nSmall argument harms governance,\nExcessive strictness harms *virtue/power*.\nTo cling to minor kindness while obscuring *The Way*,\nTo indulge minor anger while harming supreme *virtue/power*—\nGreat governance is not harsh,\nThus the people are easily guided;\nSupreme *virtue/power* is effortless,\nThus the lower ranks do not rebel.\nUtmost loyalty returns to simplicity,\nThus the people have no deceit or concealment;\nAbove, there is fairness and rectitude,\nBelow, there is no treachery or guile;\nAbove, there is clarity and frugality,\nBelow, there is no craftiness or falsehood.\n\nThe Master Laozi said:\nWhen the *law* of seating is established,\nThe common people grow resentful;\nWhen the decree of demoting ranks is put forth,\nMeritorious officials rebel.\nLawsuits proliferate and drag others into blame,\nThe innocent suffer their grievances;\nRanks are diminished and meritorious officials harbor resentment,\nThus they plot rebellion.\nThose who examine only the traces of lawsuits\nDo not know the root of order and chaos;\nThose who are skilled in military formations\nDo not know the strategies of decisive victory.\nOrder and chaos are determined by the transformation of *The Way* through non-action,\nNot by the knowledge of officials who supervise and reprimand.\nDecisive victory is achieved through insight in the mind’s realm,\nNot by the understanding of a single soldier.\nThe Sage perceives blessings within fortified gates,\nAnd foresees calamities in the unseen depths.\nWithin fortified gates and in unseen depths—\nThe Sage alone can discern the profound.\n\nThe foolish are bewildered by minor gains,\nYet forget the greater harm—\nThus, some *Dao* bring small profit yet great ruin,\nGain here yet lose there.\nTo see the small and forget the great,\nTo gain profit yet forget harm—\nHow deeply deluded are they!\nHow can they be led astray?\n\nThus, benevolence finds no greater expression than loving others,\nWisdom finds no greater depth than knowing others.\nTo love others as oneself,\nIs to prevent unjust punishment;\nTo know others with sincerity,\nIs to ensure governance remains unerring.\n\nLoving others is like loving oneself,\nThen punishment will not be excessive;\nKnowing others with sincerity,\nThen governance will not be disordered.\n\nThe Master Laozi said:\nThe vastness of the rivers and seas,\nThough they overflow, does not last beyond three days;\nA sudden gust of wind and torrential rain\nDo not persist beyond a moment.\nThis shows that violent rule is brief,\nAnd ruin comes swiftly—\nJust as the wind rages fiercely,\nYet ceases just as quickly.\n\nThose whose *virtue/power* has no foundation\nYet fear no ruin—\nIt is because they have not yet reached it.\nWorry is the means of flourishing,\nJoy is the means of ruin—\nThus, the good turn misfortune into blessing,\nAnd the wise transform calamity into fortune.\n*The Way* is boundless yet can be employed,\nYet never becomes full.\nThe foolish cling to delusion and do not turn back,\nTaking worry as joy,\nAnd thus meet swift ruin;\nThe good uphold *The Way* and preserve simplicity,\nTransforming calamity into fortune,\nAnd thus flourish without fail.\n\nThe Master Laozi said:\nSerene stillness and tranquil harmony\nAre the nature of humankind.\nCeremonial forms and rules\nAre the measures of *Dao*.\nTo know the nature of others,\nIs to cultivate oneself without contradiction;\nTo know the measures of *Dao*,\nIs to ensure one’s actions are not disordered.\nTranquil harmony is the foundation of natural disposition,\nRules are the excess of restraining desire.\nDrawn by desire and profit,\nEven stillness becomes contradiction;\nClarity in *Dao* and measure,\nEven movement remains unerring.\n\nIssue a single command,\nAnd all respond without contention—\nThis is called *The Way*.\nTo grasp the root and know the branches,\nTo hold one principle yet respond to all things—\nThis is called *skill*.\nTo issue a command means to prevent the heart from contention;\nTo prevent the heart from contention\nIs to harmonize all actions and return to their foundation,\nTo respond to all things yet remain unified in *The Way*—\nThis is called *skill*.\n\nTo dwell knowing what to do,\nTo act knowing where to

Way*?\n\nTo make others praise and honor me as a lofty sage,\nIs the strength of my heart;\nTo make others revile and slander me as lowly and base,\nIs the fault of my heart.\n\nWords issue from the mouth,\nYet cannot be restrained by others;\nActions arise from the near,\nYet cannot be restrained from afar.\n\nGood and evil originate with oneself,\nPraise and blame come from others—\nWhat all mouths proclaim,\nNo one can suppress.\n\nOne flaw in conduct,\nAnd its consequences reach far;\nMatters are hard to complete yet easy to ruin,\nReputation is hard to establish yet easy to lose.\nOrdinary folk all slight minor dangers,\nNeglect small matters,\nAnd thus invite great calamities.\n\nFor when disaster arrives,\nIt is self-generated;\nWhen fortune comes,\nIt is self-created.\nDisaster and fortune share the same threshold,\nBenefit and harm dwell as neighbors—\nWithout the utmost discernment,\nNone can separate them.\nThus, deliberate consideration is the gateway to disaster and fortune,\nAction and stillness are the pivot of benefit and harm—\nThey must not be overlooked.\n\nThe Perfect Person’s every action is deliberate,\nAnd they measure the end from the beginning.\n\nFor where name and profit arise,\nThere too disaster and fortune take root.\nThus, to block the source of name and profit,\nAnd seal the gate of disaster and fortune,\nIs to let wisdom naturally unfold,\nAnd to act and remain still without change.\n\nLaozi said:\nAll know the mechanisms of order and chaos,\nYet none know how to preserve life whole.\nTherefore, the sage assesses the world and acts accordingly,\nWeighs affairs and plans accordingly.\n\nThe sage can be subtle and manifest,\nSoft and firm,\nWeak and strong—\nThey adapt to the times, moving or still,\nAnd establish merit according to their resources.\nThey perceive things in their course\nAnd know their reversals;\nThey embody *The Way* as their form,\nAnd respond to its transformations.\nThus, they act throughout their life\nWithout ever being constrained.\n\nAll can grasp the principles of order and chaos,\nYet none can preserve themselves within their shifting currents.\nTherefore, the sage assesses the world and weighs affairs,\nResponds to endless changes,\nActs in accordance with the times,\nAnd never suffers disgrace.\n\nThus, some matters may be spoken of yet cannot be done,\nSome may be done yet cannot be spoken of,\nSome are hard to complete yet easy to ruin.\n\nWhat is done yet cannot be spoken of—\nTaking and discarding.\nWhat is spoken of yet cannot be done—\nDeceit and trickery.\nWhat is easy yet hard to complete—\nAffairs.\nWhat is hard to complete yet easy to ruin—\nReputation.\nThese four matters,\nThe sage attends to with care,\nAnd the enlightened alone can truly perceive.\n\nTo examine the shifts of action and withdrawal,\nAnd discern the causes of success and failure—\nOnly the sage and the wise can truly see.\n\nLaozi said:\n*The Way* of the common person is—\nTheir heart desires smallness,\nTheir ambition desires greatness,\nTheir wisdom desires completeness,\nTheir conduct desires rectitude,\nTheir capacity desires abundance,\nTheir undertakings desire fewness.\n\nBy \"heart small\" is meant—\nTo guard against disaster before it arises,\nTo be cautious of ruin in its minutiae,\nAnd not to dare indulge their desires.\n\nBy \"ambition great\" is meant—\nTo encompass all under heaven,\nTo unify diverse customs,\nAnd to gather the myriad judgments\nAs the hub of a wheel.\n\nBy \"wisdom complete\" is meant—\nTo know the end and the beginning without limit,\nTo let sound flow in all directions,\nAnd to be like a deep spring never exhausted.\n\nBy \"conduct rect\" is meant—\nTo stand straight yet never bend,\nTo remain pure yet never stain,\nTo endure hardship without altering their principles,\nAnd to achieve success without arrogance.\n\nBy \"capacity abundant\" is meant—\nTo possess both literary and martial arts,\nTo balance movement and stillness with propriety,\nAnd to adapt every action to its fitting measure.\n\nBy \"undertakings few\" is meant—\nTo grasp the essential and align with the multitude,\nTo hold fast to the strict and govern the broad,\nTo maintain stillness amidst chaos.\n\nThus, the small-hearted are restrained by the minute,\nThe great-ambitioned embrace all without exception,\nThe wise-knowing lack no understanding,\nThe rect-conducted have nothing they refuse,\nThe abundant-capacityed govern all without flaw,\nThe few-undertakings hold what is essential.\n\nAll these qualities,\nNone but the most exalted sage and true adept can fully embody.\n\nThus, the sage’s approach to goodness—\nNo minor matter goes undone,\nAnd to their faults—\nNo subtle error remains uncorrected.\nThey act without relying on shamans and sorcerers,\nYet ghosts and spirits dare not act before them—\nThis is the height of nobility.\n\nYet they tremble and guard themselves,\nEach day more cautious than the last,\nAnd thus achieve without doing.\n\nExternally, they do not fail others,\nInternally, they do not shame themselves—\nWhy need they summon shamans and sorcerers?\nWhy fear ghosts and spirits?\nFrom their reverent and wounded heart,\nThey can be preserved to the end.\n\nThe fool’s wisdom is already meager,\nYet their undertakings are many—\nThus their actions must falter.\nIf they employ upright teachings,\nIt is easy and must succeed;\nIf they employ perverse teachings,\nIt is difficult and must fail.\n\nTo abandon what is easy yet certain to succeed,\nAnd to pursue what is difficult yet certain to fail—\nThis is the path of folly and confusion.",

Peace—\nThen where does he not find **suitability** (*shi*)?\nDwelling in the Great Hall,\nYet nothing is excluded from the **succinct** and **profound** (*suoyin*) within;\n**Awareness** (*xiao*) in the **silent** and **void** (*wusheng*),\nAnd all sounds respond within the **silent** and **void** (*wusheng*);\n**Illumination** (*zhao*) in the **formless** (*wuxing*),\nYet all forms appear—\nThen he preserves with the heavens and earth,\nShares brightness with the sun and moon,\nDeposits himself in the **Spiritual Platform** (*lingtai*),\nEncompasses the **ultimate essence** (*zhi jing*),\nAnd is called the **True Person**.\n\nHis **use** is to **not use**,\nTo **not use** is to **then be able to use**;\nHis **knowing** is to **not know**,\nTo **not know** is to **then be able to know**—\nThis has already been expounded.\n\nThe **Dao** is the **Way** by which things are guided,\n**Virtue** (*de*) is the support by which life is sustained,\n**Ren** (*benevolence*) is the **manifestation** of accumulated **en** (*favor/grace*),\n**Yi** (*righteousness*) is the **harmonization** of personal **heart** with the **suitable** for all—\nThese four are the **principles** by which one governs the world and cultivates oneself,\nAnd they must not be lost.\n\nWhen the **Dao** is extinguished, **virtue** (*de*) flourishes;\nWhen **virtue** (*de*) declines, **ren** and **yi** arise.\nThus, in the **upper ages**, the **Dao** was followed without **virtue** (*de*),\nIn the **middle ages**, **virtue** (*de*) was upheld without **ren** and **yi**,\nIn the **lower ages**, **ren** and **yi** were enforced with fear of losing them—\nHence, the **Noble Person** cannot live without **yi** (*righteousness*), for to lose **yi** is to lose the means of living;\nThe **petty person** cannot survive without **li** (*profit*), for to lose **li** is to lose the means of survival.\n\nThe **Noble Person** fears losing **yi** as a **calamity**,\nThe **petty person** desires **li** as **blessing**—\nObserving their fears,\nThe paths to **calamity** and **blessing** diverge.\n\nWhen the **Dao** is lost and **virtue** (*de*) declines,\nThe seven **virtues** (*qi yi*) are slighted and **righteousness** (*yi*) grows thin.\nThe **Noble Person** without **yi** has no way to preserve his **Dao**,\nThe **petty person** without **li** has no way to sustain his life.\nThe **Noble Person** fears losing **yi** as a **calamity**,\nThe **petty person** seeks **li** as **blessing**.\n\nThe **Laozi** said:\nSome desire **profit** (*li*) and thereby harm **righteousness** (*yi*),\nSome desire to harm **righteousness** (*yi*) and thereby bring **profit** (*li*).\nTo feed a **disease** of dampness with **heat**,\nTo quench a **disease** of thirst with **coldness**—\nThis is how the multitude **nourishes** (*yang*) their **ailments** (*bing*),\nYet the **skilled physician** (*liangyi*) knows this as **causing harm**.\n\nPleasure to the eyes,\nDelight to the heart—\nWhat the **foolish** (*yu*) find **profitable** (*li*),\nThe **Daoist** (*youdao*) avoids.\nThe **Sage** governs by **first establishing** and **then harmonizing**,\nThe multitude by **first harmonizing** and **then establishing**—\nThus, the gates of **calamity** and **blessing**,\nThe **reversal** of **profit** and **harm**,\nCannot be overlooked.\n\nTo quench a **disease** of thirst with **water**,\nThe **skilled physician** (*liangyi*) knows this as **calamity**.\nThe **poor** take **wealth** from **unrighteousness** (*buyi*),\nThe **Noble Person** knows this as **harm**.\n**First opposing** and **then harmonizing**—\nThis is the **error** the **foolish** (*yu*) commit;\n**First harmonizing** and **then opposing**—\nThis is what the **Sage** abhors.\n\n**Profit** and **harm** are contrary,\n**Calamity** and **blessing** are inverted—\nOne must not fail to discern them.\n\nThe **Laozi** said:\nThose with **achievements** (*gong*) who abandon **ren** and **yi** will be **suspected**,\nThose with **guilt** (*zui*) who uphold **ren** and **yi** will be **trusted**.\nHence, **ren** and **yi** are the **constant harmony** of affairs,\nAnd the **most honored** (*zun*) **rank** in the world—\nThough **achievements** (*gong*) and **names** (*ming*) are already established,\nThe seven **virtues** (*qi yi*) must not be forsaken.\nTo forsake them invites **guilt** to accumulate,\nTo follow them ensures **rank** and **reward** are honored.\n\nThough one’s **plans** (*mou*) are **correct** and **strategies** (*ji*) are **apt**,\nAnd **worries** (*lü*) are **dispelled** by **schemes** (*tuo*),\nIf the state is preserved,\nYet one’s affairs **depart** from **ren** and **yi**,\nThen one’s **achievements** (*gong*) will surely **not be fulfilled**.\n\nThough one’s **calculations** (*ji*) are **not flawed**,\nYet one’s **strategies** (*ji*) are **no benefit** to the state,\nIf one’s **heart** is **complete** toward the **lord** (*jun*),\nAnd **harmonizes** with **ren** and **yi**,\nThen one’s **life** will surely be **preserved**.\n\nHence it is said:\nA hundred **words** and a hundred **calculations** that are **never apt** (*bu ru bangqi*),\nAre not as good as **abandoning** (*she*) them and **tending** (*qu*) to **ren** and **yi**.\n\nAs a **minister** to the **lord** (*jun*),\nOne who **plans** for the state’s **difficulties** (*nan*),\n**Exalts** the **lord** and **honors** himself,\nYet **achievements** (*gong*) are **not completed**—\nThis is due to **abandoning** **ren** and **yi**.\n\nSome have **wise counsel** (*liangmou*) yet it is **not used**,\n**Unusual strategies** (*qiji*) yet they **do not proceed**,\nThey **serve** the **lord** with all their **strength** (*jin*),\nThough **not observed** (*bujiancha*),\nThey **preserve** **ren** and **yi** without **daring** to **forget** them even for a moment,\nAnd thus their **lives** are **without harm**.\n\nThe **Laozi** said:\n**Teaching** originates with the **Noble Person**,\nThe **petty person** benefits from its **radiance** (*ze*).\n**Profit** originates with the **petty person**,\nThe **Noble Person** **enjoys** its **achievements** (*gong*).\nIf the **Noble Person** and **petty person** each **obtain** their **proper place** (*yi*),\nThen **achievements** and **rewards** are **shared** (*tonggong yishi*), and the **Dao** is **realized**.\n\n**Virtue’s** (*de*) **radiance** (*ze*) extends downward,\n**Rewards** and **profits** are **bestowed** upward—\nThen there are **no officials** yet **governance** is **self-regulating**,\nNo **commands** yet **actions** are **self-executing**,\nEach **dwells** in **their proper place** (*an qi suo*),\nAnd this is the **realization** of the **Dao**.\n\n**Desire** in excess **injures** **righteousness** (*yi*),\n**Worry** in excess **harms** **wisdom** (*zhi*),\n**Desire** gives rise to **righteousness** being **seized** (*yi duo*),\n**Worry** accumulates **wisdom** being **obscured** (*zhi hun*).\nHence, a state **delighted** in **profit** (*li*) will **surely** be **preserved**,\nA state **delighted** in **harm** (*shang*) will **surely** be **destroyed**—\n**Indulging** its **desires** (*zong qi yu*).\n\nWater flows downward and **becomes vast** (*guangda*),\nThe **lord** (*jun*) **subordinates** himself to the **minister** (*chen*) and **becomes wise** (*congming*),\nThe **lord** does not **contend** with the **minister**,\nAnd thus the **Way** of **governance** (*treat*) is **unimpeded**—\nHence, the **lord** is the **root and foundation** (*genben*),\nThe **minister** is the **branches and leaves** (*zhi ye*),\nAnd if the **root and foundation** are **not beautiful** yet the **branches and leaves** flourish—\nThis has never occurred.\n\nThe **Sage’s** (*shengren*) **governance** (*zhi*) is:\nTo **illuminate** the **four eyes** (*ming si mu*),\nTo **penetrate** the **four ears** (*da si cong*),\nTo **exclude** the **wicked** and **depraved** (*ping yie te*),\nTo **employ** the **virtuous** and **capable** (*ren sheneng*),\nThen the **lord** above **hangs** (*chui*) and **does nothing** (*wuwei*) while **transformation** (*hua*) occurs naturally—\nAnd the **ministers** below **exert** their **hearts** (*xin*) fully while **dutifully** (*fengzhi*) **serving**.\n\nHow could there be **mutual contention** (*jiaozheng*)?\nThis is the **root and foundation** **ever-firm** (*ri gu*),\nAnd the **branches and leaves** **prolific** (*fansheng*).\n\nThe **Laozi** said:\nThe **loving father’s** (*ci fu*) **care** for his **son** (*zi*) is,\nNot seeking **recompense** (*bao*),\nYet **cannot** be **internally resolved** (*nei jie*) in the **heart**.\nThe **Sage lord’s** (*sheng zhu*) **nourishment** (*yang*) of the **people** (*min*) is,\nNot for **selfish use** (*ji yong*),\nYet **nature** (*xing*) **cannot** be **restrained** (*bu neng yi*).\nWhen one **relies** on

      "translated_text": "The **Conqueror and King** enrich their **lands**—\nThis is **pursuing** their **expansion** (*wu qi guang ye*).\nA **perilous state** enriches its **officials**—\n**Heavy taxation** leads only to **hardship**.\nTo **govern** a **state** yet **lack sufficiency**,\nTo **pacify** **chaos** yet **lack sufficiency**—\nThis is the **omen** of **impending disorder**.\nA **doomed state** **empties** its **granaries**.\n**Expenditures** **without measure**,\nGranaries **daily depleted**,\nThe **ruler** **impoverished**, the **people** **exhausted**—\nWhat **awaits** it if it does not **perish**?\n\nThus it is said:\nWhen the **sage-ruler** does **nothing** (*wu wei*),\nThe **people** **prosper** of themselves;\nWhen the **sage-ruler** **acts not** (*wu wei*),\nThe **people** **transform** of themselves.\n**Settle** their **dwellings**,\n**Delight** in their **labors**.\nRaise an **army** of **ten thousand**,\n**Daily** consuming **a thousand** in **gold**—\nAfter the **campaign’s** end,\n**Famine** **must** follow.\nThus **arms** are the **ominous tool**,\nNot the **treasure** of the **noble**.\n\nWhen **warfare** **arises** in **front**,\n**Famine** **follows** in **rear**;\nThe **state** **spends** **ten thousand** in **gold**,\nThe **people** **exhausted** by **toil**.\nThus it is known:\nThe **ominous tool** is **not** the **treasure** of the **sage**.\n\nTo **conciliate** **great grievances** **must** **leave** **residual grievances**—\nHow can this be **not evil**?\nHe who **conciliates grievances** is one whose **ruler** is **unclear**.\nTo **demote** a **meritorious minister**,\nTo **diminish** a **virtuous lord**,\nTo **not endure** a **moment’s anger**,\nYet **make** it a **source of calamity**.\nWhen the **ruler’s wrath** **flares above**,\nAnd the **minister’s pride** **smolders below**—\nHow can this be **not evil**, **accumulating** **residual grievances**?\n\nIn **ancient times**, the **near** were **not** **summoned** by **words**,\nThe **distant** were **not** **commanded** by **words**.\nThe **near** **take delight**,\nThe **distant** **come**.\nTo **delight the near** and **attract the distant**—\nThis lies in **virtue**, not in **words**.\n\nTo **share desire** with the **people** is to **harmonize**,\nTo **share defense** with the **people** is to **strengthen**,\nTo **share thought** with the **people** is to **know** them.\nHe who **gains the people’s strength** is **rich**,\nHe who **gains the people’s praise** is **illustrious**.\n\n**Actions** **invite bandits**,\n**Words** **bring calamity**.\nDo not **speak before others**,\nNor **follow after others** have spoken.\n**Whispered words**—\nThese are **transmitted**.\n**Spoken first**, then **repeated** to the **ears**—\n**Echoing** a **thousand li**.\n**Speech** is **calamity**,\nThe **tongue** is the **trigger**.\nOnce **words** are **ill-spoken**,\n**Four horses cannot** **retrieve** them.\nBandits **love** what is **loved**,\nCalamity **arises** from what is **spoken**.\nYet **speech** **runs** **without feet**,\n**Flies** **without wings**—\nThe **blemish** on **white jade**,\n**Four horses cannot** **pursue** it.\nThus **speech’s** **swift calamity**.\n\nIn **ancient times**, **Zhonghuangzi** said:\nThe **Heaven** has **five directions**—\n**Four directions** and the **center**.\nThe **Earth** has **five phases**—\n**Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth**.\n**Sound** has **five tones**—\n**Gong, Shang, Jiao, Zhi, Yu**.\n**Flavors** have **five tastes**—\n**Sweet, Bitter, Spicy, Sour, Salty**.\n**Colors** have **five hues**—\n**Blue, Yellow, Red, White, Black**.\n**Humans** have **five organs**—\nThe **five viscera**.\n\nThus between **Heaven and Earth** there are **twenty-five kinds** of **people**.\nTwenty-five **ranks** of **human kind**—\nEach **type** **differs**.\n\nThe **upper five** are:\n**Divine Persons, True Persons, Dao-Persons, Perfect Persons, Sage-Persons**—\n**Unfathomable transformation** is called **Divine**,\n**Pure and unadulterated** is called **True**,\n**Unobstructed penetration** is called **Dao**,\n**Piercing the profound mysteries** is called **Perfect**,\n**Knowledge encompassing all things** is called **Sage**.\n\nThe **next five** are:\n**Virtuous Persons, Exemplary Persons, Wise Persons, Benevolent Persons, Eloquent Persons**—\n**Nurturing** is called **Virtue**,\n**Loved by others** is called **Exemplary**,\n**Clear and insightful** is called **Wise**,\n**Compassionate and forgiving** is called **Benevolent**,\n**Persuasive in speech** is called **Eloquent**.\n\nThe **middle five** are:\n**Public Persons, Loyal Persons, Trustworthy Persons, Righteous Persons, Ceremonious Persons**—\n**Without self-interest** is called **Public**,\n**Serving the ruler** is called **Loyal**,\n**Without fault** is called **Trustworthy**,\n**Appropriate conduct** is called **Righteous**,\n**Respectful and yielding** is called **Ceremonious**.\n\nThe **next five** are:\n**Scholar-Persons, Artisan-Persons, Park-Keepers, Farmers, Merchants**—\n**Serving superiors** is the **Scholar**,\n**Overseeing tools** is the **Artisan**,\n**Managing forests and marshes** is the **Park-Keeper**,\n**Cultivating fields** is the **Farmer**,\n**Facilitating trade** is the **Merchant**.\n\nThe **lower five** are:\n**Common Persons, Slave-Persons, Foolish Persons, Sensual Persons, Petty Persons**—\n**Multitude** is the **Common**,\n**Subjugation** is the **Slave**,\n**Obtuse** is the **Foolish**,\n**Without wisdom** is the **Sensual**,\n**Without discernment** is the **Petty**.\n\nThe **upper five** and the **lower five**—\nLike **humans** and **oxen/horses**.\n**Exemplary and foolish** **differ**—\nAs **Heaven and Earth** are **separated**.\n\nThe **Sage**—\n**Sees** with **eyes**,\n**Hears** with **ears**,\n**Speaks** with **mouth**,\n**Acts** with **feet**.\nThe **Sage in the world**—\n**Six senses** **obstructed**,\nYet **still relies** on **artifice**.\n\nThe **True Person**—\n**Sees without clarity** yet is **clear**,\n**Hears without listening** yet is **acute**,\n**Moves without action** yet is **followed**,\n**Speaks without words** yet is **public**.\nThe **Sage beyond the world**—\n**The heart already emptied**,\n**No obstruction in passage**.\n\nThus the **Sage’s** **movement** through the **world**—\nThe **True Person** **never exceeds** it;\nThe **Exemplary’s** **correction** of **customs**—\nThe **Sage** **never observes** it.\n\nTo **govern the age** and **preserve the True**—\nEach **fulfills its role**.\nThus **Emperor Yao’s** **sage-virtue** **matched Heaven**,\nAnd **Zhongwu’s** **lofty rectitude** **corrected customs**.\n\nThe **Dao**—\n**No before, no after**,\n**No left, no right**,\n**All things** in **profound unity**,\n**Neither this nor that**.\n\n**Approach it**—**no before**,\n**Follow it**—**no after**,\nWho **knows its left**?\nWho **knows its right**?\n**Erased** in **profound unity**—\n**Forcibly named** as **Dao**.\n\n**The
