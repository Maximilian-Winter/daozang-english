Yet its faint ripples endure, for among the various masters, none fail to trace their lineage to the Dao and virtue, mending the ruptures of a hundred generations.\n\nWenzi was a man of the time of King Ping of Zhou. He composed a work in twelve fascicles. The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: \"Wenzi is also called Jiran, the teacher of Fan Li. His surname was Xin, given name Yan, styled Wenzi, a native of Pu in Caiqiu. A descendant of the Duke of Jin, he twice journeyed abroad, and Fan Li followed and served him. He was also a disciple of Laozi.\"\n\nKing Ping asked Wenzi: \"I have heard that you received the Dao from the Old Master. Though a worthy possesses the Dao, if he lives in an age of debauchery and chaos, relying on the authority of one man to transform a people long steeped in disorder—can this truly be done?\"\n\nWenzi replied: \"When the Dao and virtue correct the perverse to govern, and restore order from chaos, reviving sagely virtue so that all under Heaven is at peace, the key lies in one man. Thus, the accumulation of virtue brings kingship, while the accumulation of resentment leads to ruin. By this, Yao and Shun flourished, while Jie and Zhou perished.\"\n\nKing Ping trusted his words and employed him, and in that time, all under Heaven was well-governed. Yet whether a state stands secure or falls, its fate does not descend from Heaven—it rests solely on whether the ruler employs the worthy.\n\nThus, the sage, ever vigilant for the world, cherishes its people as an infant, seeking to bring benefit, remove harm, and secure their peace—not for any private gain. His work first recounts the signs of rise and fall among the sage-kings and hegemons, then traces the causes of the waxing and waning of the Dao, virtue, propriety, and righteousness. In all, it ascends to the profoundest mysteries and extends to the myriad things. Its purport is vast and abstruse, its language refined yet true. Therefore, for those who govern a state, even in an age of decadence and decline, it can return them to the simplicity of primordial purity. For those who cultivate themselves, even burdened by the weight of cares, it can restore them to the spontaneity of their inherent nature. How great indeed!\n\nThe gentleman cannot but carve out his heart to receive it.\n\nIn the eleventh generation of our Tang, the Emperor, with robes flowing and transformation spreading, harmonizes and nurtures all things, embracing the myriad states with gentle grace, uniting diverse customs under one rule. Thus, those in high office all exhaust their loyalty and devotion, while those dwelling in obscurity also find peace in their labors.\n\nIn the fourth year of the Yuanhe reign, I, Moxi, withdrew to the distant slopes of Mount Heng, where I built my hut before the Hua Gai peak. Eight years have since passed, during which I have diligently cultivated the winds of simplicity and unobtrusively savored the subtle purport of the Way. Though I remain unfit for silent reverence, I have nonetheless forced myself to compose this commentary—an endeavor as daunting as measuring the vastness of the Milky Way or gauging the depths of the boundless sea. Thus, I offer this preface.\n\n*Preface by Master Moxi*\n\n**The Scripture of Penetrating the Mystery, Scroll One**\n*Commentary by Master Moxi*\n\n**The Origin of the Dao**\n\nOf all things esteemed, none surpasses man.\nYet failing to settle the mind’s restlessness and illuminate its clarity, or to sever the net of attachment at the crossroads of desire, man’s nature drifts with craving, his life dissolving into the flux of things—much to the sorrow of the perfected.\nThus, the origin of the Great Dao is set forth here at the head of these chapters, that one may trace the source to ascend the Way and, in every encounter, touch the real. How could this not be fitting?\n\nLaozi said:\nThere is a thing, chaotically complete, profoundly still and ever-abiding—hence it is called “a thing.”\nIt shapes and nurtures the ten thousand kinds, hence it is called “chaotically complete.”\nBorn before heaven and earth, it stands foremost among all things.\nIts image is formless, like the heavens’ height bearing great signs, while the Dao’s vastness knows no fixed shape.\nIt congeals in emptiness as the One, and as qi disperses, it unfolds into the ten thousand things.\n\nAbysmally dark, profoundly still, utterly serene and indifferent—such is the nature of the Dao, subtle and unfathomable.\nNo sound is heard, for it transcends sound; no form is seen, for it transcends color. Yet I am compelled to name it, calling it the Dao.\nSince it is neither sound nor color, it is nameless, wordless, beyond speech or description.\nWhat is spoken here is not its true designation, hence it is called a “forced name.”\n\nThe Dao is lofty beyond reach, deep beyond measure.\nDevoid of form or image, how could its height or depth be gauged?\nIt enfolds heaven and earth, bestowing without shape.\nIts source flows ceaselessly like water, ever full yet never overflowing, ever drawn yet never depleted.\n*Chuochuo*: the appearance of water welling forth.\nWhen turbid, it gradually clarifies through stillness—so too does motion settle into quiet, and murkiness into clarity.\nIts bounty is inexhaustible, unbound by time, its generosity extending beyond any single dawn or dusk.\nThough manifest, it does not fill a grasp; though tangible, it eludes form.\nContracted, it can expand; obscure, it can illuminate; supple, it can be firm.\nIt embraces yin and exhales yang, revealing the three luminaries.\nSpoken in obscurity, its brightness rivals the three celestial lights.\nSpoken in softness, its sharpness cuts through metal and stone.\nThus, it can be yin or yang, soft or hard, great or small, short or long.\nTurn toward it, and it abides; turn away, and it vanishes.\nIt is neither this nor that, its transformations boundless.\nBy it, mountains rise in height, abysses plumb their depths.\nBy it, beasts run, birds fly, unicorns swim, phoenixes soar, and the stars traverse their courses.\nHow could the loftiness of mountains, the profundity of abysses, the swimming of unicorns, the soaring of phoenixes, or the unerring movements of celestial bodies arise from anything but the mysterious resonance of perfect governance?\n\nThrough nonbeing, it attains being; through humility, it gains honor; through retreat, it takes the lead.\nThis means: by relinquishing life, one preserves the self; by humbling oneself, one is exalted; by yielding, one advances.\nThe nature of the Dao delights in modesty, and thus modesty brings benefit.\n\nIn ancient times, the Three Sovereigns grasped the thread of the Dao, standing at the center and roaming in spirit with transformation to govern the four directions—the Three Sovereigns being Fuxi, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor.\nIn ruling the world, their spirit moved within, while their virtue and grace overflowed without.\nThus, they could emulate the heavens’ motion and the earth’s stillness, their wheel turning without cease, their waters flowing without end, accompanying all things from beginning to end.\nWinds arose and clouds gathered, thunder resounded and rain descended, all responding without limit.\n*The heavens move; the earth rests.*\nThis speaks of the sage who models the heavens’ activity and the earth’s tranquility, aligning with the beginnings and endings of the ten thousand things.\nIssuing decrees and commands, thunder rolls and winds rise, clouds drift and rain falls, nurturing and sustaining all beings, responding to change without end.\n\nCarved and polished, it returns to simplicity.\nCultivating truth and prudence in conduct—this is what is meant by “polishing.” Yet when one severs dependence and congeals in emptiness, one naturally reverts to simplicity.\nActing without acting, it harmonizes with life and death.\nThe Great Dao is without intent, allowing things to follow their nature—hence it is called “nonaction.”\nLife cannot but live, for life is natural.\nDeath cannot but die, for death is natural—thus it harmonizes with life and death.\nSpeaking without speaking, it communicates virtue; tranquil and unassuming, it attains harmony.\nThis means: without words, it reaches virtue; without affectation, it achieves harmony.\nThough the ten thousand things differ, they all thrive in accord with their nature.\nIt harmonizes yin and yang, regulates the four seasons, and adjusts the five phases.\nYin and yang harmonize the four seasons, which in turn regulate the five phases—this is the constant Way.\nThis does not mean the sage alters or creates anew, but rather that he humbly observes human affairs, emulates the heavens’ timing, and discerns the people’s sentiments, preventing wickedness and ushering in great peace.\nIt moistens grasses and trees, seeps into metal and stone.\nBirds and beasts grow large, their fur lustrous; eggs do not spoil, and animal fetuses do not miscarry.\n*Sound: dú.*\nThe Dao’s efficacy prevails, and all things fulfill their growth without harming one another.\n\nFathers know no grief of losing sons, elder brothers no day of weeping for younger brothers. Above, governance flows smoothly; below, none rebel. Children are not orphaned, nor do they die untimely. Women are not widowed, all secure in their bonds. Rainbows and miasmas vanish, evil qi conceals itself. Bandits and thieves cease their ways, and the world attains great harmony—all brought forth by the power of embodied virtue.\n\nThe blessings just named all arise from the sage’s nurturing influence. The constant Way of heaven generates and transforms without end, giving life yet possessing nothing, perfecting transformations yet ruling nothing. In \"possessing nothing\" lies the wondrous presence of being; in \"ruling nothing\" appears the true ruler. The ten thousand things depend on it to live, yet none know its virtue; they depend on it to die, yet none can resent it. Life is not mine to claim—whom should I thank? Death is not mine to inflict—whom should I blame? It gathers and stores yet grows no richer, distributes and bestows yet suffers no poverty. Hoarded, it never overflows; scattered, it never empties.\n\nVague and elusive, it defies representation; fleeting and indistinct, its use knows no limit. Profound and obscure, it responds to transformations without form. In the space between fleeting and indistinct, its responses are inexhaustible. At the threshold of the profound and obscure, its changes are boundless. Traced to its source, it seems to hold something; pursued further, it has no shape. Flowing and unobstructed, it never acts in vain. Its spiritual workings complete, its principles never respond falsely.\n\nIt coils and unfurls with hardness and softness, rises and falls with yin and yang, bending and stretching with the seasons. Laozi said: \"The great man who embodies the Dao is serene, without thought; tranquil, without worry. Moving with the Dao, why trouble with thoughts and concerns?\"\n\nTaking heaven as his canopy, earth as his chariot, the four seasons as his horses, and yin and yang as his charioteer, he travels where there are no roads, roams without rest, and exits where there are no gates. With heaven as his canopy, nothing is left uncovered; with earth as his chariot, nothing is left uncarried. With the four seasons as his horses, nothing is left uncommanded; with yin and yang as his charioteer, nothing is left unprepared. The great man rides the uprightness of heaven and earth, harnesses the movements of yin and yang, traverses boundless realms, and roams the inexhaustible Dao—how magnificent is this!\n\nThus, swift yet unshaken, distant yet untiring, his four limbs unmoved, his clarity and insight undiminished, he illuminates all under heaven—grasping the essence of the Dao to observe the limitless. Holding fast to the Dao’s essence, he surveys the eight directions as if in his palm. The subtlety of perfect governance resides in the square inch of the heart. How could he exhaust himself racing near and far?\n\nTherefore, the affairs of the world cannot be forced; those who force them invite failure. Push forward by following their natural course, and nothing will fail to flourish. The changes of the ten thousand things cannot be rescued; grasp their essence and return to it. Though their transformations are manifold, their essence can be precisely discerned.\n\nThus, the sage cultivates his root within and does not adorn his branches without. He rectifies his heart within and rejects extraneous arts without. He sharpens his spirit to attain inner clarity and stills his knowledge and perceptions to halt what is not the Dao. Thus, he is effortlessly inactive yet accomplishes everything, governs without governing yet nothing is left ungoverned. The so-called \"non-action\" does not precede the things themselves; \"non-governance\" does not alter the natural. \"Nothing is left ungoverned\" follows the mutual arising of things. When things are allowed to be as they may, then nothing is not as it should be. When governance follows what can be governed, then nothing is left ungoverned.\n\nLaozi said: \"He who holds the Dao to govern the people responds to matters as they arise, follows things as they move. The transformations of the ten thousand things all find their response; the changes of a hundred affairs all find their match.\" This means that when the sage governs the world, he stabilizes human affairs according to their convenience, and thus the people cannot but be transformed, and all things cannot but harmonize.\n\nThus, the Dao is empty and formless, level and easy, clear and still, soft and weak, pure and unadorned—these five are the forms and images of the Dao. Without possessing these five virtues, one cannot perceive the form of the formless or the image of the imageless.\n\nEmptiness and formlessness are the dwelling of the Dao. \"Dwelling\" means residence. Levelness and ease are the simplicity of the Dao. \"Simplicity\" means essence. Clarity and stillness are the mirror of the Dao. \"Mirror\" means illumination. Softness and weakness are the function of the Dao. \"Function\" means penetration. Reversal is the constant of the Dao. The common use is action; the Dao’s use is non-action. Softness is the hardness of the Dao; weakness is the strength of the Dao. Accumulated softness becomes hardness; accumulated weakness becomes strength. Purity, simplicity, and unadornedness are the trunk of the Dao.\n\nEmptiness means the center holds nothing; levelness means the heart bears no burdens. Desire and craving do not burden—this is the perfection of emptiness. Having no likes or dislikes—this is the perfection of levelness. Unchanging unity—this is the perfection of stillness. Unmixed with things—this is the perfection of purity. Free from sorrow and joy—this is the perfection of virtue. These resolve the five meanings.\n\nIn the governance of the perfected man, he discards his cleverness and does not adorn his wisdom. He erases his embellishments and preserves his simplicity. Following the Dao, he abandons cunning and fulfills the way of clarity and emptiness, casting off deluded and false wisdom. He emerges with the people from the public, without private motives. He restricts what he holds, reduces what he seeks, relinquishes his temptations and longings, removes his desires and avarice, and casts aside his thoughts and concerns.\n\nRestricting what he holds leads to discernment; reducing what he seeks leads to attainment. When the heart attains unity, it masters the arts of the ten thousand things. Restriction enables subtle understanding; reduction enables the governance of the many. Thus, controlling the external with the internal, nothing is left undone. If the internal attains it, the external can be shepherded. The attainment of the internal—\"internal\" refers to the ruler in a state and the heart in a person. When the ruler is enlightened, the state is at peace; when the heart is upright, the body is governed. Thus, controlling the external with the internal, the world has no equal. Controlling the internal with the external leads to success or failure. Knowing both internal and external, no action fails.\n\nThe great man rides the uprightness of heaven and earth, harnesses the movements of yin and yang, traverses boundless realms, and roams the inexhaustible Dao—how could this not be magnificent?\n\nThe five viscera at peace, thoughts and reflections balanced, sinews and bones firm and strong, ears and eyes keen and bright—all arise from guarding the center. The great Dao is smooth and broad, not far from the self; those who seek it afar go forth only to return. To wade far and lose the ford, not knowing to seek it near within oneself—\n\nLaozi said: The sage forgets governing others and attends to self-cultivation; values forgetting power and rank and attends to self-attainment. In self-attainment, the world attains me. Never has one whose own person is ungoverned been able to govern others, nor one in power who does not overbear others. Only in self-attainment does one not overbear. In self-attainment, what I love, others also love. With my feelings, I grasp theirs—thus it is called self-attainment. In self-attainment, the feelings of the world are all attained by me. Joy forgets wealth and nobility and resides in harmony; only one who does not overbear preserves harmony and joy amid wealth and nobility.\n\nTo know the greatness of the self and make the world small is near to the Dao. Attaining the Dao, though the self is slight, one may possess the world—thus the self is great. Losing the Dao, though the world is vast, there is nowhere to contain the self—thus the world is small.\n\nThus it is said: Utmost emptiness, profound stillness—all things arise together, and I observe their return. Things arise from emptiness and stillness, thus returning to the root is called stillness. Stillness is called the restoration of life, meaning the endless cycle of going and returning, where the myriad things never end.\n\nThe Dao shapes and nurtures the myriad things, beginning and ending without form, motionless and silent, vast and boundlessly obscure. The Dao is tranquil and vast, a great furnace molding clay, beginning in formlessness. Within it lies something, yet it ends without form. Who knows its limit? It resides in boundless obscurity, beyond the ken of gods and spirits.\n\nVast and deep, broad and great, it cannot be made external; minute and subtle, it cannot be made internal. Without walls or enclosure, the greatest cannot be sought outside, the smallest cannot be grasped within. It gives rise to the general name of being and non-being. Speak of non-being, and all categories teem forth; speak of being, and no shape or sign appears. This is the essence of non-action, the subtlety of existing things—the general name of the myriad things arises between being and non-being.\n\nThe true person embodies emptiness and non-being, simplicity and ease, purity and stillness, softness and weakness, unadulterated plainness, not mingling with things. This is the virtue and Dao of heaven and earth—thus they are called true persons. Their body aligns with emptiness and non-being, their virtue harmonizes with heaven and earth—thus they are true persons.\n\nThe true person knows the greatness of the self and makes the world small, values governing the self and disdains governing others. From the human perspective, the world seems vast; from the Dao’s perspective, the world is small. Viewed from afar, governing others seems base; viewed from near, governing the self is noble.\n\nNot allowing things to disturb harmony, not allowing desires to disorder the feelings—if the heart is not moved by things, how can feelings be disordered by desires? They conceal their name and identity, drifting with the times, flowing with the俗, yet none know them—this is the utmost concealment. When the Dao prevails, they withdraw and remain silent; when the Dao is absent, they exert themselves and cultivate it. They act without acting, engage in affairs without affairs, know without knowing. They act without reliance, engage without pride, know without display.\n\nEmbracing the heavenly Dao, encompassing the heart of heaven, they exhale and inhale yin and yang, expel the old and take in the new. With yin, they close; with yang, they open. With hardness and softness, they contract and extend; with yin and yang, they bow and rise. Their heart is one with heaven, their body one with the Dao. Exhaling and inhaling follow principle, contraction and extension are fitting, movement and stillness have rhythm, bending and stretching accord with the seasons.\n\nNo joy, no sorrow, no delight, no anger—the myriad things are profoundly the same, without right or wrong. Sorrow and joy do not cling to the heart, delight and anger do not show on the face. Encountering things, they remain true—thus it is called profound sameness.\n\nWhen the body is harmed by the ravages of cold, heat, dryness, and dampness, the form is exhausted and the spirit blocked. When the spirit is harmed by the afflictions of joy, anger, thought, and worry, the spirit is spent and the form remains in excess. Cold and heat assail from without, joy and anger arise within. As the spirit departs, though the remaining form persists—how can it endure long?\n\nThus the true person employs the heart-mind to restore nature, relying on spirit for mutual support, and so attains wholeness from beginning to end. Therefore, their sleep is dreamless, and their waking is carefree.\n\nThe true person knows how yin and yang harm the upright, discards partial and biased emotions, and nurtures a nature of tranquility and indifference—thus body and spirit sustain each other, and worry and dreams do not intrude.\n\nWhen Confucius asked about the Dao, Laozi said: \"Correct your form, unify your gaze, and the harmony of Heaven will arrive. When the form is unified and upright, the four limbs are all proper; when the heart-mind is level, no deviant influences oppose it; when perception is unified, all encounters are real. Cut off all deliberation, and the harmony of Heaven will come of itself.\n\n\"Gather in your knowledge, rectify your measure, and spirit will come to dwell. Virtue will become your countenance, the Dao will become your dwelling. Without other knowledge, abiding by constant measure—then spirit will respond without fail, virtue will embrace all, and the Dao will be present everywhere.\n\n\"Bright-eyed as a newly born calf, without seeking its former state—this is called concentrating qi to attain suppleness, seeking only nourishment from the mother, with no other concerns.\n\n\"Form like withered wood, heart-mind like dead ashes—unaware of form as form, heart-mind as heart-mind. Is it withered wood? Dead ashes? Truly, they know reality without distortion, thus they maintain a vast and unfettered state, with no heart-mind to scheme, luminous in all four directions—can they be without knowledge?\n\n\"This is called the formless form, the heart-mindless heart-mind, which cannot be described in appearance or sought in location. Vast and unbounded, it cannot be planned; measured, it attains its singularity in all four directions—can it be without knowledge? This is called true knowledge.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Those who attend to life respond to change and act; change arises from the times, and those who know the times follow no fixed course. They must respond to what comes, adapting to the moment—what is prized is knowing the moment; how could there be a constant way?\n\n\"Thus, the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name. Responding to the times, how could there be a fixed method? Writing arises from words, and words emerge from wisdom—but the wise do not know, for it is not the constant Dao.\n\n\"By 'writing' is meant the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music*; by 'words' are meant the sayings of former kings and sages. All are like straw dogs used in sacrifice—not the constant Dao. The name that can be named is not the one who treasures books.\n\n\"Inscribing on bamboo and silk, engraving on metal and jade—this is the name that can be named. Yet once names arise, there is truth and falsehood. Thus, writing does not convey true names; it is not real.\n\n\"Much learning leads to exhaustion; it is better to guard the center. Much learning exhausts one’s strength; guarding the One requires no labor. Abandon learning and there is no worry; discard sagacity and renounce knowledge, and the people benefit a hundredfold. Cease what is not the Dao, remove ostentation and bias, know and rely on the One Origin—thus there is a hundredfold benefit.\n\n\"Human beings are tranquil at birth—this is Heaven’s nature. Stirred by things, they move—this is the desire of nature. When things arrive and one responds, this is the movement of wisdom. When wisdom engages with things, likes and dislikes arise; when likes and dislikes take shape, wisdom is externalized, and one cannot return to oneself—Heavenly principle is extinguished.\n\n\"Nature is tranquil, but desire moves; when things are sensed, harm follows. Wisdom gives rise to calamity, desire disorders the real; likes and dislikes are born, and gain and loss arise. Unable to reflect and return to true nature, one brings about self-destruction.\n\n\"Therefore, the sage does not exchange Heaven for man, externally transforming with things while inwardly not losing their true state. Thus, those who penetrate the Dao return to clarity and stillness; those who possess the Dao are clear and still. Those who exhaust themselves in things ultimately attain non-action. External things—hence, non-action.\n\n\"Nurture wisdom with tranquility, unite spirit with indifference—then one enters the gateless gate. Wisdom does not arise without stillness; spirit does not respond without quiescence. Response emerges from the gateless gate. One roams the gateless gate, following Heaven and wandering with the Dao—this means guarding emptiness and stillness. Those who follow others exchange with the vulgar—this means clinging to fame and power.\n\n\"Thus, the sage does not disturb Heaven with affairs, does not disorder the true state with desires, does not deliberate yet is fitting, does not speak yet is trusted—like the Heavenly Dao, without intention, like the four seasons, mysteriously attuned. Without thought, they attain; without action, they accomplish. Attainment is not through toiling thought; accomplishment is not through effort.\n\n\"Therefore, though they dwell above, the people do not find them burdensome; though they stand before others, none are harmed. The world turns to them, and the treacherous and perverse fear them—because they do not contend with the myriad things, none dare contend with them. Where utmost virtue extends, the treacherous decline and hide. The myriad people bear them without burden; none in the world dare contend with them.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"When people follow desire and lose their nature, their movements are never upright. With this, to govern a state is to bring chaos; to cultivate the self is to bring defilement. The harm of desire—destroying states and ruining lives—its response is like an echo. How can one not be warned?\n\n\"Thus, those who do not hear the Dao cannot return to their nature; those who do not understand things cannot attain clarity and stillness. Unclear about the principles of the Dao, unenlightened about the conditions of things, they cannot return to the origin and restore simplicity.\n\n\"The original nature of human beings is without depravity or defilement. Long immersed in things, it changes; changed and forgetting its root, it merges with what seems like its nature. The original human nature is utterly still and unaware; stirred by things, it moves—this is desire harming the real, decline obscuring the upright. The deluded do not awaken, taking this as their true nature. If they do not transform throughout their lives, how grievous is this?\n\n\"The nature of water desires clarity, but sand and stone defile it; the nature of human beings desires equilibrium, but cravings and desires harm it. Only the sage can forsake things and return to the self. The nature of water is originally clear—defilement lies in sand and stone. The nature of human beings is originally balanced—harm lies in cravings and desires. Only the sage can forsake things and return to the self.\n\n\"Therefore, the sage does not employ wisdom to enslave things, does not use desire to disturb harmony. Their joy is not exultant, their sorrow is not mournful. *Wū guàn qiē*—taking joy in joy, when joy reaches its extreme, sorrow follows.\"\n\nThose who take sorrow as sorrow never forget their sorrow. Thus, they stand high yet do not peril, rest secure yet do not topple, preserving emptiness and purity—what fear have they of collapse or danger?\n\nTherefore, when good counsel and sound plans are heard, even fools delight in them; when the sagely virtue and lofty conduct are praised, even the unworthy yearn for them. If fools still know to turn toward and admire such things, how much more the worthy and virtuous? Many delight in such words, yet few put them into practice; many admire such ways, yet few walk them. Though those who rejoice and yearn number in the tens of thousands, none advance in cultivation. Why is this? Because they are shackled by things and struck by custom, ensnared by gluttony for flavors and fettered by the shackles of fame and profit.\n\nThus it is said: \"I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I remain without affairs, and the people enrich themselves; I love stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I am without desire, and the people return to simplicity.\" This makes clear that when the ruler models these four principles, governing from above, the people are transformed below.\n\nStillness and purity are the perfection of virtue; softness and weakness are the function of the Dao. Emptiness, tranquility, and joy are the ancestors of the ten thousand things. When these three are practiced, one merges into formlessness—formlessness is called \"the One.\" The One is the mindless union with all under heaven. The One is non-being. It speaks of the formless moving through the world, pervading the ten thousand things without end.\n\nVirtue is spread without exhaustion, employed without toil; no moisture can moisten it, no mind can weary it. It cannot be seen, cannot be heard. So subtle it transcends sound—how could it be heard or seen? From formlessness, form arises; from soundlessness, the five tones resound; from tastelessness, the five flavors take shape; from colorlessness, the five colors emerge. Thus, being arises from non-being, substance from emptiness.\n\nThe number of tones does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five tones cannot be fully heard; the number of flavors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five flavors cannot be fully tasted; the number of colors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five colors cannot be fully seen. Form, sound, color, and flavor all arise from nothing. Tracing them to their fundamental number, they do not exceed five. Yet from these five, endless transformations arise, losing their constancy. Pushed to excess and decadence, they surpass what sight and hearing can fathom, what constant observation can discern.\n\nWhen the tone *gong* is established, the five tones take shape; when sweetness is established, the five flavors are fixed; when whiteness is established, the five colors are formed; when the One is established, the ten thousand things are born. All the above take the One as their foundation. Thus, things attain constancy through the One, and people attain transformation and brilliance through their master. The Dao unifies as One, and the ten thousand things flourish abundantly. Therefore, the principle of the One extends throughout the four seas without difference; the scrutiny of the One pervades heaven and earth.\n\nThose who comprehend the One understand the root of heaven and earth’s creation and the nature of the ten thousand things. In its wholeness, it is thick and uncarved; outwardly, it appears foolish to others. When dispersed, it is vast and turbid, its traces obscured by custom. Though turbid, it gradually clears; though empty, it gradually fills. Turbid yet able to clear, empty yet able to fill. Vast and still like the great sea, boundless and without shore. Drifting like floating clouds, whither does it go? As if non-being yet being, as if perishing yet enduring. Neither non-being nor being, yet able to endure or vanish—this describes the one who embodies the Dao.\n\nLaozi said: \"The sum of the ten thousand things all passes through a single aperture; the root of a hundred affairs all emerges from a single gate.\" The ten thousand things and ten thousand affairs all issue from the gate of manifold subtleties. Thus, the sage follows a single track, never altering its constancy, never changing its regularity, aligning with the plumb line and following the carpenter’s square, bending to accommodate its constancy.\n\nThe sage follows the origin of the great Dao, examining the nature of the ten thousand things, not forcing land-dwellers into the depths or tree-nesters into caves—this is not altering their constancy. Each attaches to what brings ease, all benefiting their nature—this is bending to accommodate its constancy.\n\nJoy and anger are the deviations of the Dao; sorrow and grief are the losses of virtue; likes and dislikes are the transgressions of the heart; cravings and desires are the burdens of life. These eight are what the great man does not dwell in. Great anger shatters *yin*; great joy topples *yang*; thin *qi* brings dimness; terror and fear induce madness; sorrow and grief scorch the heart, giving rise to accumulations of illness. If one can eliminate these five, they align with spirit illumination. These five are the utmost sincerity in cultivating the self.\n\nPeople know to refine gold and smelt stone in pursuit of longevity, yet cannot moderate desires and pacify harmony to preserve their heavenly nature. Moreover, joy and anger arise recklessly—what use are medicinal stones? If one truly grasps this principle, they naturally align with spirit illumination. Spirit illumination is attained internally. Those who attain it internally have peaceful organs, balanced thoughts, keen hearing and sight, and strong sinews and bones.\n\nThose who attain internally embrace emptiness and guard the One, their spirit at ease and thoughts serene—thus their ears and eyes are keen, their sinews and bones strong. Open and unobstructed, they do not contend with things; firm yet not exhausted, they employ softness without lack. Never excessive, never deficient. Desires do not exceed measure, and nothing they do fails to succeed.\n\nNothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet water embodies the Dao. This is a metaphor to convey principle, using water to clarify the Dao. Its breadth cannot be fathomed, its depth cannot be measured; its length extends without end, its reach pervades without limit. Its ebb and flow, increase and decrease surpass all reckoning. Above, it becomes heaven’s rain and dew; below, it becomes earth’s moisture and nourishment. The ten thousand things cannot but live, the hundred affairs cannot but succeed. It embraces all life without partiality, bestowing its blessings even upon the lowliest creatures without seeking repayment. It enriches all under heaven without exhaustion, bestows virtue upon the people without cost. Its course cannot be exhausted, its subtlety cannot be grasped. Struck, it is not wounded; pierced, it is not injured; severed, it is not cut; scorched, it is not burned. Supple and flowing, it cannot be scattered. It penetrates metal and stone, overcomes all under heaven. Abundant or scant, it allows all to take or give. It endows the ten thousand things without precedence or delay, without partiality or impartiality, vast and equal with heaven and earth—this is called utmost virtue.\n\nThat by which water fulfills its utmost virtue lies in its supple smoothness. Thus it is said: \"The softest under heaven courses through the hardest under heaven, entering where there are no crevices.\" Water, foremost among the Five Phases, attains the One and thus the Dao succors all under heaven, its virtue harmonizing with the ten thousand kinds. Its benevolence extends to grasses and trees, its righteousness hardens like metal and stone, its trustworthiness aligns with the four seasons, its wisdom flows without end. Thus the soft cannot be severed, the hard cannot be broken; in motion it commands awe, in strength it knows no rival. Scattered, it becomes rain and dew; gathered, it forms springs and fountains. Used, it is never exhausted; bestowed, its reach is boundless. Defiled, it remains unstained; purified, it preserves its wholeness. How vast is the virtue of water, in harmony with the Dao!\n\nThat which is formless is the great ancestor of things; that which is soundless is the great progenitor of kinds. All things arise from the formless, the five tones emerge from the soundless. Thus the utmost void, though ungiving, gives birth—hence the void is the ancestor and progenitor of things. The Perfected Person, penetrating the numinous treasury, becomes one with the Creator, holding fast to dark virtue in the heart, transforming with spirit-like swiftness. Therefore, the Dao that is not a Dao—how vast and indistinct! Without issuing commands or decrees, it shifts customs and alters mores—this is the work of the heart’s conduct.\n\nAll things have their source yet alone return to their root; all affairs have their origin yet alone guard their gate. Thus one may exhaust the inexhaustible, reach the unreachable, illuminate things without dazzling, respond to echoes without knowing. Within, one attains the unity of the heart; without, one connects with the ten thousand existences. The Dao of submerging and floating transforms like a spirit, its responses boundless—who knows its limit?\n\nLaozi said: \"Those who attain the Dao have wills that are weak yet affairs that are strong, hearts that are empty yet responses that are fitting.\" A weak will is gentle, tranquil, and serene, concealed in non-acquisition, acting in incapacity, tranquil in non-action, moving without missing the moment—this is what it means to attain. The Dao of non-action follows what is fitting for things, moving in accord with the proper time. Thus the noble must take the lowly as its root, the high must take the low as its foundation. Dust gathers to form mountains, streams accumulate to become seas. Entrusting the small to encompass the great, residing within to govern without, acting with softness yet firmness—strength knows no defeat, no enemy can overpower. With an empty heart, one precedes things: though without force, one is strong, and wherever one goes, all is accomplished, none dare encroach or insult. Adapting to transformations and measuring the times, none can harm. Moving in tandem with the Dao, what thing could cause harm?\n\nThose who desire firmness must guard it with softness; those who desire strength must preserve it with weakness. Accumulate softness and it becomes firm; accumulate weakness and it becomes strong. Observe what is accumulated, and you will know survival or ruin. Know firmness, know softness—then virtue is truly cultivated. Know survival, know ruin—then the self will surely flourish. Strength can overcome those weaker than oneself, but when it encounters its equal, it is checked. The strong cannot be overcome, the weak cannot be oppressed—this is the Dao of acting with softness. Softness can overcome those stronger than oneself—its power is immeasurable. Do not lightly scorn, for it may surpass you.\n\nThus when armies are strong, they perish; when wood is hard, it snaps; when leather is stiff, it splits. Those who rely on strength do not preserve their material whole. Teeth are harder than the tongue yet perish first—observing the principle of teeth and tongue, one may discern the Dao of firmness and softness. Thus the firm meets ruin, while the soft obtains wholeness. Therefore, softness and weakness are the pivot of life, while firmness and strength are the companions of death. Circumstances summon one another, and life and death may be verified.\n\nThe one who leads falls into exhaustion; the one who follows reaches the source. Holding to the latter ensures one is not subdued. Those who grasp the Dao to pair with change—whether first or last, each controls the other. How can one fail to master others when others cannot master them? This is to seize the mechanism of transformation, which none can comprehend. Preceding others invites no resistance; following others accords with what is fitting. Mastering both precedence and subsequence, acting and resting in non-action—this is grasping the Dao to pair with change.\n\nThe so-called \"following\" is to harmonize one’s measures with the proper time. When the time changes, there is no gap for even a breath. Preceding it is excessive; following it is insufficient. Affairs have their proper moments, things have their successes and failures, movements in perilous mechanisms allow no pause for a breath. It lies in harmonizing measures and awaiting the time, aiming for the mean without error.\n\nThe sun revolves, the moon orbits—time does not tarry with man. Thus the sage does not value a foot-long jade but treasures an inch of time. Time is hard to obtain yet easily lost, so the sage acts in accord with the time and establishes merit based on resources. The sage does not prize amassing treasures but values preserving the Dao. Cherishing the fleeting light of time, the rare encounter of opportunity—when acting to achieve success, one must not miss the moment.\n\nAbide by the pure Dao, restrain oneself with feminine restraint, follow along and respond to change, always remaining behind and never ahead. Soft and weak in stillness, composed and settled in tranquility—great achievements know no firmness, none can contend with them. Thus embodying purity and stillness, holding to feminine weakness, one attacks the strong under heaven—does this not mean seizing the proper time without contention?\n\nLaozi said: \"When the heart harbors the mechanisms of cunning, even purity and whiteness are not unsullied.\" If scheming and cleverness are not forgotten, the dark Dao grows ever more distant. When numinous virtue is not complete within the self, how can one know what distant harm may befall? Near, one loses the self; far, one loses others.\n\nWhen the heart forgets the desire to harm, even a starving tiger may be tailed—how much more so with people! When the desire to harm is forgotten within, though one treads upon a starving tiger’s tail or stands before a violent man, one will ultimately suffer no harm.\n\nThose who embody the Dao are at ease yet never exhausted; those who attain the governance of the Dao never rest even in death. Those who rely on calculations labor without achievement. Those who exhaust numerological arts labor without benefit.\n\nRuling through harsh laws and punishments is not the work of emperors and kings; frequent use of the whip and rod is not the way to drive far. Excessive punishments breed resentment among the people; frequent whipping makes horses unruly. Excessive likes and dislikes invite calamity to follow—this is the principle of nature.\n\nThus, the laws of the former kings were not what they created but what they followed; their prohibitions and punishments were not what they enacted but what they upheld. They did not rely solely on execution and killing to seek the people’s welfare—expelling the wicked, meting small punishments to admonish great faults, which is the blessing of petty men.\n\nTherefore, following brings greatness, while contriving brings pettiness; upholding brings stability, while acting brings ruin. As when Great Yu governed the waters: he followed the people’s plight, for their suffering could not be endured. He dredged rivers along the mountains, cut channels to guide the flow, rescuing the times and saving from peril, ensuring no harm befell them. How majestic was his success—this was the power of following. When Shang Yang of Qin created laws and altered standards, rewarding those who obeyed the present and punishing those who violated the statutes, in a single day he executed over seven hundred, turning the Wei River red. Later, he himself died by dismemberment—what he harmed was great, what he achieved was small, and what he upheld was not secure. Those who act bring ruin.\n\nRelying on ears and eyes to hear and see wearies the mind yet brings no clarity; governing through cunning and calculation exhausts the heart yet yields no success. If one’s ears and eyes, mind and thoughts are spent, how can one speak of sufficiency? To hear without listening, to see without looking, to act without intention, to succeed without deliberation—this is what the perfected person values.\n\nRelying on the talent of one person is insufficient to achieve perfect governance; the ability of one person cannot manage even three acres of land. If one overreaches, strength is dispersed and cannot suffice. Following the principles of the Dao and the natural order of heaven and earth, even the six directions are not too vast to harmonize. By adapting to what is fitting and measuring one’s strength, even the vastness of the six directions can be balanced, and the multitude of the ten thousand things can be thoroughly mastered.\n\nHearing is misled by praise and blame, confused by likes and dislikes. The eyes are seduced by colors and beauty; ritual and propriety are insufficient to restrain desire, but sincerity of heart can embrace what is distant. Words and rites cannot guard against transgression, but the heart alone can illuminate the subtle.\n\nThus, no weapon is sharper than the will, yet *Mo Ye* and *Po Ya* are inferior; no enemy is greater than yin and yang, yet war drums are trivial. The so-called great enemy leaves corpses without restraint; the middling enemy hides in the mountains; the petty enemy lurks among the people. The five weapons are but the dregs of the Dao. Yin and yang are the greatest enemies—this is the Dao. *Mo Ye*, *Po Ya*, drums, and gongs have form and sharpness, sound and might. The supreme Dao has no sharpness yet can sever, no might yet can subdue. Thus, though *Mo Ye* is sharp, the Dao is inferior to it; though drums retain their sound, they are trivial beside the Dao.\n\nYin and yang are the love and aversion of male and female. Wherever desire for profit arises, the heart follows emotion, and in the space between acceptance and rejection, there must be the peril of life and death. Thus, the great enemy hides in the breast, and the petty enemy lurks among the people. Therefore, the perfected person is cautious within and restrained without.\n\nThus it is said: when the people abound in cleverness and skill, strange things proliferate; when laws and decrees multiply, thieves and bandits increase. Abandoning one to take the other prevents heavenly calamity from arising. Governing a state with excessive laws brings chaos to the people—chaos is the omen of ruin. Governing the self with excessive rules wearies the body—weariness is the sign of decay. Abandoning that cleverness and those laws, embracing this clarity and stillness, heavenly calamity naturally ceases.\n\nThus, governing a state with cleverness is the state’s bane; not governing a state with cleverness is the state’s virtue. The perfected person sees cleverness as a bane; the worldly see it as virtue. Using it brings harm; not using it brings blessing.\n\nThe formless is great; the formed is small. The formless is many; the formed is few. The formless is strong; the formed is weak. The formless is solid; the formed is hollow. Where there is great and small, there is many and few; where there is few, form is small—this is the smallness of the formed. Where there is no great or small, there is no many or few. Where there is no few, there is no form—this is the greatness of the formless.\n\nThe great and small, many and few, strong and weak, solid and hollow—all arise from this. The formed is the completion of affairs; it originates from the formless, whose name cannot be known. Following things, it is named the completion of affairs. The formless is the beginning of creation; the completion of affairs is the making of vessels. The beginning is simplicity; simplicity scatters and becomes vessels.\n\nThe formed has sound; the formless has no sound. The formed is born of the formless—thus, the formless is the beginning of the formed. The Dao is not nothing; what is born is something. Through birth, one awakens to the Dao; when the body exists, there is nothingness. Thus, sound emerges without inquiry; form exists with a beginning.\n\nVastness and thickness have names—what has a name is prized for its wholeness. This speaks of the named as the name of the nameless, not seeking a name. If one seeks a name, how can wholeness be prized? Frugality and thinness have no name—what has no name is base and light. This speaks of the nameless not as the name of the nameless, but as one who cuts oneself off in ignorance, not knowing the name of the great Dao.\n\nAbundance and wealth have names—what has a name is honored and cherished. Poverty and scarcity have no name—what has no name is lowly and despised. With the Dao, one is honored; without the Dao, one is disgraced. The male has a name—what has a name is manifest and bright. The female has no name—what has no name is hidden and subtle. If not for the use of the male, how could the name be whole? If not for embracing the female, how could the nameless be whole? Obscurity and clarity, concealment and display—all rest in my having or lacking, my abiding or stagnating.\n\nSurplus has a name—what has a name is exalted and wise. Deficiency has no name—what has no name is tasked with the lowly. Not prizing one’s name is surplus; not exalting oneself yet being exalted is not wisdom. Not cultivating one’s name is deficiency; not lowering oneself yet being lowly is folly.\n\nMerit brings a name; lack of merit brings no name. The Dao does not respond in vain. The named is born of the nameless—the nameless is the mother of the named. Thus, the Dao gives rise to being and non-being, difficulty and ease complete each other.\n\nBeing does not arise from being but is born of non-being. Difficulty does not arise from difficulty but is completed through ease. Knowing that being is insufficient, one must guard the mother to preserve the child.\n\nKnowing that difficulty does not arise from difficulty, one must make the difficult through the easy.\nYet things do not move in isolation—matters depend on mutual support.\nThus the sage holds to the Dao in emptiness, stillness, subtlety, and wonder, thereby perfecting their virtue.\nForgetting the mechanism, illumination arises.\nTherefore, where there is the Dao, there is virtue; where there is virtue, there is merit; where there is merit, there is a name; where there is a name, it returns once more to the Dao.\nWhen Dao and virtue are cultivated, merit and name naturally follow.\nWhat is possessed is not truly mine—it is possessed of itself.\nNot knowing to whom it belongs, it returns to the Dao.\nMerit and name endure long, and one remains free from blame throughout life.\nPreserving merit and name wholly, one is naturally free from regret.\nKings and dukes possess merit and name; the orphaned and widowed possess no merit and name.\nThus the sage calls themselves orphaned and widowed, returning to their root.\nOnly the sage can establish merit without merit, a name without a name.\nThough possessing such merit and name, they still style themselves orphaned and widowed—this is to guard the feminine, the yielding, and return to simplicity.\n\nMerit is achieved yet not possessed.\nThus merit is used for benefit, and namelessness is employed for function.\nMerit benefits things yet does not display itself; namelessness is constantly employed yet inexhaustible.\nIn ancient times, the people were simple and unlearned.\nThough their words were established, they remained like children.\nThey knew not east from west, making no distinctions.\nTheir appearance did not depart from their nature, and heaven’s harmony followed.\nWords did not exceed actions; actions proceeded without pretense.\nMovement accorded with the Dao, and speech was unadorned—valuing substance.\nTheir clothing was warm yet without ornament, adding no embellishment.\nTheir weapons were blunt and without edge, not fashioning instruments of harm.\nTheir gait was halting and deliberate.\nTheir gaze was dim and unfocused, like that of an infant.\nThey drank from the well they dug, ate from the fields they tilled.\nBeyond clothing and food, they sought nothing more.\nThey did not bestow charity nor seek virtue.\nHigh and low did not vie with one another; long and short did not compare.\nExternally, they sought no repayment; internally, they did not pray for virtue.\nSilently aligning with the true Dao, they obscurely accorded with heaven’s principle.\nWhen the wind conforms to custom, it may be followed; when affairs match one’s ability, they are easily done.\nCommands need not be issued, yet customs naturally align; people have no desires, and affairs naturally simplify.\nThose who flaunt deceit to delude the world, or act perversely to mislead the multitude—\nthe sage does not take them as the people’s norm.\nFor to engage in deception and falsity, to act with perversity and crookedness, is to delude the world and mislead the multitude—\nthis is what the sage does not do.\n\nPurity and sincerity—purity is clarity, sincerity is trust. Sincerity is heaven’s nature; purity is man’s clarity. Sincerity is upheld by the will, clarity is distinguished by discernment. Without the utmost sincerity under heaven, how could one fully realize the natures of all beings and unite with heaven and earth’s virtue? Thus it is said: without purity and sincerity, one cannot move others—this is what it means.\n\nLaozi said: Heaven attains its height, earth attains its depth; the sun shines, the stars gleam; yin and yang harmonize—not through deliberate action. What is achieved by non-action arises not from desire. Align with the Dao, and things naturally follow. When the ruler rectifies himself, the people are transformed as if by spirit; the teaching of no words has no equal.\n\nThe four seasons and yin-yang do not generate the myriad things; timely rain and dew do not nourish grasses and trees. Yet when spirit and clarity connect, when yin and yang harmonize, the myriad things are born. When heaven and earth are harmonious and at peace, when spirit and clarity intermingle and descend—this is not a matter of intention. The four seasons cannot but follow their course, and the myriad things cannot but be born.\n\nThe Dao conceals purity within, harbors spirit in the heart, abides in stillness and tranquility, delights in harmony within the breast. Vast and formless, silent and soundless—this is how the sage embraces heaven’s heart, bestows virtue, and nurtures the Dao. Inwardly, spirit is stored; outwardly, no trace of beings appears. Without omen or sign, how could there be form or sound?\n\nGovernment offices are as if empty of affairs; the court is as if empty of people. There are no harsh policies, no flatterers, no recluses, no idle folk. The court is filled with loyal and steadfast men, the wilderness holds no hidden worthies. There are no corvée labors, no unjust punishments; the people are employed in season, laws are applied without excess.\n\nUnder heaven, none do not look up to the ruler’s virtue, emulate the sovereign’s intent. Even distant lands and foreign customs, none do not come through repeated translation. The ruler possesses the Dao, and the people rely on his virtue. His influence extends to the eight directions, flowing even to alien customs. It is not that he visits every household in person—he merely extends his sincere heart to all under heaven. Thus, though distant peoples and foreign customs come to submit, it is not that the ruler visits each home himself; rather, his sincere heart issues forth, and distant peoples naturally arrive.\n\nThus, rewarding the good and punishing the violent is proper governance, but what enables it to be carried out is purity and sincerity. Though commands may be clear, they cannot act alone—they must await purity and sincerity. Purity is clarity; sincerity is trust. Without clarity and trust, none can reward the good and punish the evil.\n\nTherefore, when the Dao is universally applied yet the people do not follow, it is because purity and sincerity have not reached them. As when Yu attacked the Miao, they did not submit, and he withdrew—only when he danced with shields and feathers did the Miao come to terms. This was the power of purity and sincerity.\n\nLaozi said: Heaven establishes the sun’s brightness, arrays the stars, extends the four seasons, regulates yin and yang. By day it exposes things, by night it lets them rest; the wind dries them, rain and dew moisten them. In generating things, none see how they are nourished, yet the myriad things grow. In destroying things, none see how they perish, yet the myriad things die—this is called spirit and clarity. The Dao of heaven operates in hiddenness; it is difficult to express in words.\n\nWhen things are born, it is their time, and they cannot but be born. When things die, it is their time, and they cannot but die. Thus, the living align with life, the dead align with death. Therefore, the living do not thank heaven, the dead do not resent the Dao—it is simply natural. This is what is meant by spirit and clarity.\n\nThus, the sage emulates this. When fortune arises, none see how it begins; when misfortune is removed, none see its cause. It cannot be traced, yet it is not false. Above, it was said that heaven follows the Dao; here, it is said that the sage follows heaven. Heaven’s life and death correspond to the ruler’s rewards and punishments. \"Fortune arising\" refers to employing the worthy; \"misfortune removed\" refers to eliminating the evil. The evil cannot but be punished; the worthy cannot but be advanced. Thus, the worthy advance of themselves, not because I advance them; the violent are punished of themselves, not because I punish them. Therefore, fortune does not arise from me, nor does misfortune originate from me. None know its source; none see its form.\n\nDaily reckoning seems insufficient, but yearly reckoning shows surplus. The sage does not scheme over trifles; daily use may seem inadequate, but yearly accounting shows abundance. Silent and soundless, a single word stirs all under heaven—this is how heaven’s heart moves and transforms.\n\nWhen the sage is still, all under heaven is silent. When he moves, the myriad things return to him. Thus, Gaozong did not speak for three years, yet when he spoke, his words were revered. Such was the case.\n\nThus, purity and sincerity take form within, moving heaven. Auspicious stars appear, yellow dragons descend, phoenixes arrive, sweet springs flow, fine grains grow. Rivers do not overflow, seas do not surge—this is how the sage embodies the Dao and nurtures beings. Only virtue moves heaven. Issuing from the heart, it responds above to heaven. Thus, dragons and phoenixes soar and gather; rivers and seas become clear and still. Without pure sincerity, how could this be achieved?\n\nTo defy heaven and harm beings brings solar and lunar eclipses, wandering stars, seasons out of joint, days darkened and nights lit, mountains collapsing and rivers drying, winter thunder and summer frost. Heaven and man communicate thus. Above, it was shown how heaven responds with auspicious omens; here, it is shown how defiance brings calamity and disaster.\n\nThus, know that misfortune and fortune have no fixed gate—they are summoned by man. Heaven and man communicate; qi and kindred types resonate—this cannot be mistaken. Therefore, when a state is about to perish, celestial signs change, customs grow chaotic, rainbows appear. All things are interconnected; pure qi presses upon one another. When perverse qi prevails, calamities transform beings, responding with misfortune.\n\nThus, the sage examines his own person and understands the myriad kinds. Diligent and cautious, he dares not be negligent. He would rather align above with heaven’s heart to pacify the black-haired people than dare to be remiss. Therefore, matters of spirit and clarity cannot be achieved by cleverness or force. Spirit and clarity are upright—how could they tolerate deceit and falsity?\n\nOnly with utmost sincerity can there be response—how could force ever penetrate? Thus, the great person’s virtue merges with heaven and earth, his clarity merges with sun and moon, his numinosity merges with ghosts and spirits, his trustworthiness merges with the four seasons. Only the supreme sage can embody the perfect Dao and align with heaven’s heart; thus, his power leaves nothing unencompassed, his illumination leaves nothing unillumined, his numinosity responds without emptiness, his trustworthiness never transgresses the proper time. One who can attain this may be called great indeed.\n\nHe embraces heaven’s heart, holds earth’s qi, grasps the balanced and contains harmony. When heart and qi communicate, heaven and earth unite in peace—how could one who does not embody balance and harmony ever reach such a state? Without descending the hall, he travels the four seas—this is the work of spiritual transformation. Changing taboos and customs, the people are transformed toward goodness as if it arose from themselves—this is the power of spiritual transformation.\n\nThe sage does not alter himself for high or low, nor change his feelings for barbarian or Chinese. Thus, without descending the hall, he transforms diverse customs; without extending his spirit, envoys from distant lands arrive. His virtue extends to others as if it arose from themselves.\n\nLaozi said: \"For the person who follows the Dao, preserving nature and safeguarding authenticity, nothing harms his person. One who comprehends the Dao’s essence and aligns with heaven’s principle remains unharmed by things and uninjured in himself. When pressed by urgent peril, his essence communicates with heaven. Sincerity reaches its utmost without deviation.\"\n\nShould one never depart from their fundamental source, what could they not accomplish? Death and life share the same domain, and none can coerce or oppress them. Never departing from their source means the mind merges with the Dao, the body equalizes with transformations—where could they not go, what could they not achieve? Death and life are already dissolved; how could they be coerced or oppressed?\n\nMoreover, to govern heaven and earth, to encompass the myriad things, to return to the workings of creation, and to contain perfect harmony—this is to have never died. The Dao models itself on heaven and earth, embraces yin and exhales yang, distributes the five agents, and envelops the ten thousand kinds. Alone, it operates above the potter’s wheel of creation, circulating beyond the bounds of transformation—it has never been born, so who could speak of its death?\n\nSincerity takes form within and outwardly resonates in the hearts of others—this is the untransmitted Dao. This speaks of nurturing sincerity within and externally moving others; can it be transmitted? When the sage resides above, embracing the Dao without speaking, his beneficence extends to the myriad people. Thus, the teaching without words is vast indeed.\n\nWhen ruler and minister diverge in heart, deceit and treachery manifest in heaven, and the correspondence of spirit and qi is evident—this is called the eloquence of the wordless, the Dao of the unspoken. The supreme Dao is without speech; its mysterious workings do not dominate. Therefore, when ruler and minister preserve one another, chanting and extolling virtue, it reaches heaven above and communicates in secret with the spirits. The eloquence of the wordless, the Dao of the unspoken—these are what they attain.\n\nTo summon the distant, let there be non-action; to draw near, let speech be without affairs. The height and remoteness of heaven can only be moved by non-action to respond, and by non-affairs to be made close. Only those who walk in the night can attain this—walking in the night means diligent practice, like traveling at night, not yet reaching the destination, yet accompanying the journey without ceasing. Thus, the spirit is inwardly aroused and ascends to heaven.\n\nTherefore, dismiss the galloping horse to manure the fields—\"dismiss\" means to cease. The \"horse\" is the heart. The heart, like a runaway horse, is difficult to control. People all gallop after their hearts, chasing distant fame and profit to glorify themselves. I, however, do not act thus: I cease the galloping of my heart, preserving emptiness and stillness to nourish my person.\n\nWhen the tracks of chariots do not reach beyond distant lands, this is called \"sitting in motion and sinking into obscurity.\" To arrive without traveling is called \"sitting in motion\"; to remain hidden without emerging is called \"sinking into obscurity.\" The Way of heaven is impartial in approach and departure; the capable have abundance, the inept fall short. The Way of heaven is impartial: those with virtue it approaches, those without it departs.\n\nObserve how choosing this and abandoning that involves partiality, yet when forsaking evil and embracing good, the principle aligns with nature. Without desire, there is abundance; with desire, there is insufficiency. Following it brings benefit; opposing it brings misfortune. Only through impartiality and non-action is there neither benefit nor merit.\n\nThus, those who govern with cunning find it difficult to maintain the state—this was already explained in the previous section. Only those who harmonize with the great harmony and uphold natural responsiveness can possess it. Only by preserving the great harmony and naturally responding can one attain it.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao and virtue are like rawhide and leather—distance makes them seem near, closeness makes them seem far. Scrutiny finds nothing, yet investigation is not in vain. Rawhide and leather form a drum: strike it, and it responds. The Dao and virtue sustain the person: employ them, and they function. The resonance is inexhaustible, the spiritual transformation boundless. Thus, examination finds nothing, yet investigation is not in vain.\n\nTherefore, the sage is like a mirror: neither advancing nor retreating, responding without concealing. The myriad things do not harm him; his heart is like a mirror, reflecting all without omission. He does not seek to illuminate by approaching things but constantly reflects and responds to them. No image escapes; what harm could come from encounters?\n\nWhat is gained is thereby lost; what is lost is thereby gained. Gain and loss reveal insubstantiality; without gain or loss, there is true unity. Thus, one who penetrates the great harmony is dim as if drunk, sweetly reclining and roaming within it—never having departed from their source, this is called great penetration. Embracing the Dao and containing harmony, forgetting form and relinquishing burdens, like drinking fine wine, delighting in its midst, merging indistinguishably—this is the great Dao. This is the use of non-use to accomplish its function. This is awakening to the Dao through non-birth, like forgetting form through drunkenness.\n\nLaozi said: In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor governed the world by harmonizing the movements of the sun and moon, regulating the qi of yin and yang, moderating the measures of the four seasons, rectifying the calculations of pitch pipes and calendars, distinguishing male and female, clarifying superior and inferior, ensuring the strong did not oppress the weak, and the many did not tyrannize the few. The people preserved their lives without premature death; the years were abundant without famine. The hundred officials were upright and impartial; superiors and inferiors were harmonious without blame. Laws and commands were clear and not obscure; assistants were just and not obsequious. Farmers yielded boundaries; roads were free of lost items; markets did not engage in speculative pricing. Thus, at that time, the sun, moon, and stars did not deviate from their courses; wind and rain came in season; the five grains flourished; phoenixes soared in the courtyards, and qilin roamed the outskirts. Such was the Yellow Emperor’s governance of the world through the Dao, and the transformation through virtue.\n\nFuxi ruled the world resting his head on stone and sleeping on ropes, killing in autumn and executing in winter, bearing the square earth and embracing the round heaven, embraced by yin and yang. Where stagnation and blockage did not flow, the qi of obstructed principles and perverse things that harmed the people and accumulated excessively were cut off. His people were like unlearned children, not knowing east from west, their vision dim, their steps faltering, yet content and self-assured, unaware of their drifting, floating without knowing their origin, nurturing themselves without knowing where to go.\n\nAt that time, birds, beasts, insects, and snakes all sheathed their claws and fangs, concealed their stings and poisons. Though they harbored the nature of venom and sting, they had no intent to harm—such was the reach of supreme virtue.\n\nAt the time of the Yellow Emperor, the essential subtleties remained obscure beneath the Great Ancestor, yet his achievements went uncelebrated, his name unproclaimed. Concealing the Way of the True Person, he followed the inherent constancy of heaven and earth. What, then, of the Dao and its virtue? When the upper reaches are penetrated, cunning and artifice vanish.\n\nThe Great Ancestor preceded the Yellow Emperor. His people were unadorned, their nature untamed. Though he accomplished works, he claimed no virtue; though he bore a name, he did not exalt it. Thus it is said: he concealed the Way of the True Person, severed the clamor of superficial wisdom, and accorded with the natural communion of heaven and earth.\n\nLaozi said: If heaven is unsettled, the sun and moon have nothing to bear them; if earth is unsettled, grasses and trees have nowhere to stand; if the self is not at peace, right and wrong take no shape. When the Three Powers are not at peace, the myriad things lose their place. If one does not cultivate single-minded devotion, turning inward to listen and reflect, then the True Person remains unseen, and true wisdom does not arise.\n\nThus, only with the True Person does true wisdom emerge. If what one holds is not illuminated, how can one know whether what I call knowledge is not ignorance? If what one preserves is not clear, how can one know the Dao?\n\nThis is to know that the knower does not fail to know the Dao.\n\nAccumulating kindness and valuing wealth, bringing joy to the myriad people so that they delight in life—this is *ren* (benevolence). Achieving great deeds, making one’s illustrious name known, embodying the proper relationship between ruler and minister, rectifying the hierarchy of high and low, clarifying the distinctions of near and far, preserving imperiled states, continuing severed lineages, and establishing heirs where none exist—this is *yi* (righteousness). Through *ren* one establishes things, and through *yi* one preserves sincerity; thus, none fail to cherish it, and no affair goes unaccomplished. This is the Way of kings and hegemons in governing the world.\n\nClosing the nine apertures, concealing one’s will and intentions, relinquishing cleverness and insight, returning to non-discernment, wandering in boundless vagueness beyond the dust and grime, roaming freely in the realm of non-action, inhaling yin and exhaling yang to harmonize with the myriad things—this is *de* (virtue/power). Inwardly obscure yet outwardly compliant, concealing essence to nurture the true, acting without contrivance while remaining untouched by external defilements—thus, the Dao disperses and becomes *de*, and *de* overflows into *ren* and *yi*. Yet once *ren* and *yi* are established, the Dao and *de* are abandoned. What was once pure essence scatters, leaving only dregs.\n\nLaozi said: When the spirit scatters, words become florid; when *de* dissipates, conduct becomes false. When the utmost essence is obscured within, yet words and actions are scrutinized without, one cannot avoid being enslaved by things. When inner essence overflows, external embellishments arise; when the mind is ensnared by affairs, how can the body escape harm? Essence may be exhausted, but actions know no end; if what one preserves is unstable, one becomes externally entangled in worldly customs. If inner preservation is unsteady, one reaches a dead end and sinks into mire; if external pursuits never cease, one is perpetually tormented by storms and waves. Therefore, the sage cultivates the arts of the Dao within and does not outwardly adorn himself with *ren* and *yi*. He understands the proper use of the nine apertures and four limbs, yet roams in the harmony of spirit—this is the sage’s wandering.\n\nThe sage inwardly guards the true essence while outwardly responding to things as they are; thus, he attains the harmony of spirit and roams in the boundless. Laozi said: As for the sage’s wandering, he moves in perfect emptiness, his mind roams in the great void, gallops beyond the four directions, acts without gateways, listens without sound, and sees without form. Unconstrained by the world, unbound by custom—moving in perfect emptiness, there is nothing he does not penetrate; roaming in the great void, there is nothing he does not possess. What gate or door could confine him? How could sight or hearing be clouded? Thus, what the sage employs to move the world is not what the True Person surpasses, and what the worthy use to correct世俗 is not what the sage observes. The traces of the True and the sagely differ, their achievements and undertakings diverge—like ancestral sacrifices and kitchen duties, each attends to their proper place.\n\nThose bound by世俗 must manifest their form and dissipate their spirit, and thus cannot escape entanglement. None who dwell in glory and prominence avoid enslavement of the spirit; having received their emoluments, they must also bear their burdens. If I can be fettered, it is because my fate lies beyond myself. Once shackled, my fate is no longer mine.\n\nLaozi said: When the ruler’s thoughts do not scatter in his breast, nor his wisdom extend beyond the four domains; when he cherishes a heart of benevolence and sincerity, sweet rains fall in season, the five grains flourish, spring brings growth, summer brings maturity, autumn brings harvest, winter brings storage, and monthly reviews and seasonal assessments culminate in annual tribute—such is the ruler with the Dao. He does not exhaust his spirit in deliberation nor flaunt his wisdom and ability, yet distant lands are drawn to him. Thus, he aligns above with the heart of heaven and below with the proper order of things, and the myriad people offer their allegiance, their tribute unceasing. He nurtures the people with impartiality, his majesty is awe-inspiring yet not harsh, his laws are few and punishments lenient. Transformation occurs as if by spirit, laws are broad and penalties mild, prisons stand empty, the world shares a single custom, and none harbor treacherous hearts—this is the sage’s grace.\n\nImpartial yet not selfish, majestic yet not fierce, laws concise and punishments mild, people follow his transformation—this may be called the utmost spirit. Thus, all directions are united, diverse customs follow a single path—this is the sage’s grace in governing the world. If those above covet without measure, those below will vie for merit without restraint; the people grow impoverished and distressed, disputes arise, toil yields no fruit, cunning and deceit sprout, and bandits and thieves proliferate. Above and below resent one another, decrees go unheeded. The aforementioned conditions are not how the sage governs the world. To rule thus is to court ruin without delay.\n\nWhen water is turbid, fish gasp; when governance is harsh, the people rebel. When those above are full of desires, those below are full of deceit; when those above are restless, those below are unsettled; when those above make many demands, those below contend with one another. To neglect the root and seek remedy at the branches is no different from digging a channel to stop water or carrying firewood to extinguish a fire. Grasping the root to govern the branches yields effortless success and a well-ordered world; clinging to the branches to seek the root brings labor to the self and chaos to the world—like trying to stop overflowing water by digging channels or quell a raging fire by adding fuel, it cannot be saved.\n\nThe sage’s affairs are few yet well-ordered, his demands are few yet sufficient. Without acting, he is benevolent; without speaking, he is trusted; without seeking, he obtains; without striving, he accomplishes. Embracing the natural, preserving the utmost true, holding to the Dao and extending sincerity, the world follows him as echo follows sound, as shadow follows form—what he cultivates is the root. The principle of the utmost sage lies in simplicity and ease, and thus the world reveres him, responding like echo to sound, like shadow to form—none fail to answer.\n\nLaozi said: When the spirit scatters outward and wisdom and deliberation dissipate within, one cannot govern. When the uses of form and spirit extend too far, what is neglected lies close at hand. Pursuing what is not one’s portion and indulging without restraint injures the spirit within and abandons the body without. Thus, one who does not step beyond the door yet knows the world, who does not peer through the window yet knows the Way of heaven— the farther he ventures, the less he knows. This speaks of sincerity issuing from within and spirit and qi moving heaven.\n\nGrasping the essentials to observe the world, the sentiments of people can be discerned. Holding the jade pivot to observe the great movements, the Way of heaven can be illuminated. When sincere words issue from within, essence and qi respond to heaven. What one guards is near, yet what one illuminates is distant; the more one busies oneself, the less one knows.\n\nLaozi said: The yang of winter’s sun, the yin of summer’s shade—things turn to them without being driven to excess. This is the spontaneous arrival of utmost refinement, unsummoned yet come, departing without going. In the profound and obscure, though one knows not how it is done, success is achieved of itself.\n\nThe yang of winter’s sun—those who are cold draw near. The yin of summer’s shade—those who are scorched find relief. Thus the sage governs the world: yin and yang are without sentiment, and the sage too is without sentiment. Things embrace of themselves, people return of themselves. Thus they come without being summoned, depart without being sent away.\n\nTo await the eye before seeing, to await speech before issuing commands—governance becomes difficult. Gaoyao was mute yet served as Grand Judge, and the world knew no cruel punishments—what need was there for words? Shikuang was blind yet served as Grand Minister, and the state of Jin knew no disorder—what need was there for sight? The command that requires no speech, the vision that requires no seeing—this is how the sage becomes a teacher.\n\nTo transform without speaking, so that below there are no cruel punishments—why trouble with words? To govern without seeing, so that Jin knows no disorder—what need is there for sight? Thus, without awaiting the eye to see, without needing speech to command—this is how the sage becomes a teacher.\n\nThe people’s transformation by their superior does not follow his words but follows his conduct. In high antiquity, one acted without speaking; in later ages, one speaks without acting. Thus when a ruler favors valor, though he does not incite strife, the state will face many crises, and gradually there will arise the chaos of robbery and murder. When a ruler favors beauty, though he does not encourage licentious talk, the state will fall into darkness and disorder, and over time there will come the calamity of debauchery and ruin.\n\nThe people’s transformation by their superior is like water flowing downward. One must block the source and be vigilant in small matters. Thus Duke Zhuang of Qin suffered the disaster of forced abdication, and Jie of Xia brought about the chaos of Daji. Therefore the sage refines sincerity within and clarifies likes and dislikes without. His words match his feelings, his decrees make his intent clear. Within, there is no partiality; without, there is no favoritism or aversion. Words issue and echoes respond; commands go forth and the wind carries them.\n\nThus punishments are not enough to shift customs, executions are not enough to suppress villainy. One may transform through virtue, but it is difficult to control through penalties. Only spiritual transformation is precious. Utmost refinement is spirit. Where refinement moves, it is like the qi of spring giving life or the qi of autumn bringing death. In life, it is warm as spring things receiving their growth. In death, it is solemn as autumn things reaching their end.\n\nThus in life there is no seeking of reward, in death no harboring of resentment. Life and death come from its being without intent. Therefore the noble person is like an archer: here, a hair’s breadth; there, a span’s mark. Thus one who governs others must be cautious in how he influences them.\n\nTherefore the noble person governing others is like an archer: when the arrow is loosed, he aims for the target, and when it reaches the butt, he measures the span’s mark. A deviation of a hair’s breadth is as distant as heaven from earth.\n\nLaozi said: To hang laws and set rewards yet fail to shift customs and change habits is because sincerity is not embraced. Laws cannot restrain the people; only utmost virtue can transform customs. Thus by listening to their music one knows their customs; by observing their music one knows their manners; by seeing their manners one knows their transformation.\n\nExamine the sound to know the music, examine the music to know the governance, observe the governance to know the customs, observe the customs to know the transformation. One who embraces truth and offers sincerity moves heaven and earth, and spirits transcend beyond the four directions. Commands are obeyed and prohibitions observed. Sincerity penetrates the Way and conveys its intent. Though not a word is spoken, the myriad people of the world, birds and beasts, ghosts and spirits, all change with him.\n\nThus the sage’s governance of the world: the people follow his transformation as if rolling a ball. To forbid villainy and error is like halting a square object. Therefore, with virtue that does not rely on force, with teachings that require no words, even birds and beasts, spirits and ghosts, have none who are not pleased and submissive—how much more so for people?\n\nThus the highest is spiritual transformation, returning to spontaneity. Next is enabling people not to do wrong, establishing laws to regulate. The lowest is rewarding the worthy and punishing the violent. When the Way and virtue are abandoned, rewards and punishments begin. When the path to advancing the worthy is opened, the unworthy also find places. When their positions are lost, the seeds of violence arise, and even the worthy may suffer execution.\n\nThus one knows that without clear laws, those who uphold them become excessive; without an even balance, those who use it become weak.\n\nLaozi said: The great Way is non-action. Non-action is non-possession. One who does not possess does not abide. One who does not abide dwells in formlessness. One who is formless does not move. One who does not move does not speak. One who does not speak is still and without sound or form. Without sound or form, it cannot be seen when looked at, cannot be heard when listened to. This is called the subtle and wondrous, the utmost spirit. Continuous as if existing—this is called the root of heaven and earth.\n\nNon-action is acting without reliance, thus it is called non-action. No speech is speaking without pride, thus it is called no sound. Without form, what is there to hear? Without color, what is there to see? This may be called spiritually subtle. Standing alone without change, continuous and ever-present—it is the root of heaven and earth.\n\nThe Way is without form or sound, thus the sage forcibly gives it form, using a single word to name the Way of heaven and earth. This speaks of grasping the essentials of the Way. The great takes the small as its root, the many take the few as their beginning. Being arises from non-being, the many arise from the one.\n\nTracing back to the origin returns to formlessness; pursuing the branches leads to confusion by multiplicity. Thus knowing to return takes non-being as its foundation; sensing multiplicity seeks the one as its master.\n\nThe Son of Heaven takes heaven and earth as his standard—this speaks of their vastness. He takes the myriad things as his resources—there is nothing he does not possess. His merit and virtue are utmost, his power and name are most noble. The beauty of these two virtues matches heaven and earth. Thus he cannot but follow the great Way as the mother of the world.\n\nFrom the honor of the four seas to matching heaven and earth—how could he not follow it to avoid disorder? This is the heavenly constant.\n\nLaozi said: Relieving poverty and aiding the urgent brings forth fame and profit, yet one should not practice petty kindness. Removing harm is where merit is accomplished. Not claiming merit as one’s own—this is goodness.\n\nWhen the world knows no disasters or harms, even sages have no virtue to apply; when superiors and inferiors are in harmony, even the worthy have no merit to establish. When disasters arise, sages pacify them; when a state falls into calamity and chaos, the worthy settle it. Yet if disasters do not arise and chaos does not stir, even sages have no throne from which to act as sages, and even the worthy have no ground on which to establish merit.\n\nThus the governance of the perfected person embraces virtue and holds to the Dao, extending sincerity and delighting in bestowal. With boundless wisdom, they rest in silence and do not speak, and none in the world know the value of their non-speaking. They drum their bellies and strike the earth, unaware of the emperor’s power.\n\nThus the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name. The Dao without name is the utmost Dao; the Dao with name is the name of the world. Therefore, the Dao that can be spoken is not the Dao; the name that can be named is not the name.\n\nThat which is inscribed on bamboo and silk, carved into metal and stone, and transmitted to others—all these are but its coarse aspects, flowery and overly adorned. The Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, and Three Kings followed different affairs yet shared the same heart, took different paths yet reached the same destination. Though their words differed and their governance varied with the times, their return to the Dao was one.\n\nScholars of the latter age do not know that the Dao is embodied in unity, that virtue gathers in essentials. They seize upon the immediacy of accomplished matters, kneel and sit to discourse upon them—though learned and widely informed, they cannot escape disorder. Scholars of today do not trace back to the root, do not embody the essentials, do not investigate the principle, but instead follow the traces, striving for broad knowledge, only adding to the chaos.\n\nLaozi said: The essence of the heart can work spiritual transformations but cannot be spoken of as the Dao. Its spiritual transformations cannot be explained as non-Dao. The sage does not descend from his seat yet rectifies the world, his care surpassing even a shout. A shout can be heard, but only by a few; when a decree is issued, the whole world submits.\n\nThus when words are the same, trust lies before the words; when commands are the same, sincerity lies beyond the command. Sharing the people’s sorrows, words reach trust, for trust is established beforehand—none dare not respond. Sharing the people’s benefits, commands are carried out with sincerity, for sincerity arises externally—none dare disobey.\n\nWhen the sage is above, the people are transformed as if by spirit, for sentiment precedes them. Grasping their intent, responses come as if by spirit. If one acts above yet receives no response below, it is because sentiment and decree diverge. The hungry seek food, the cold long for fur. If one gives fur to the hungry and food to the cold, the decree is already contrary—how can the people’s sentiment attach to it?\n\nA three-month-old infant knows not of benefit or harm, yet the loving mother’s care grows ever more earnest—this is sentiment. The heart of a newborn child does not speak of hunger or fullness, yet the compassionate mother observes its signs, discerns its dryness or dampness, and nurtures it with kindness. If the ruler of men cherishes the hundred clans as he loves a newborn child, what worry is there that the world will not be governed, that the four seas will not be at peace?\n\nThus the use of words brings change—change in small matters. The use of non-words brings change—change in great matters. Words that speak of words are small; words that speak of no-words are great. Trusting a noble person’s words, being loyal to a noble person’s intent, loyalty and trust take shape within and move responses without—this is the transformation of the worthy and sage.\n\nLoyalty and trust arise from the noble person’s original intent, not from forgetfulness. Thus when they take shape within and move without, even the worthy and sage cannot but follow.\n\nLaozi said: A son’s death for his father, a minister’s death for his lord—these are not acts of seeking fame through death. The heart’s kindness is stored within, and they do not shirk from difficulty. A son dies for his father’s peril, a minister dies for his lord’s peril—not to feign virtue for the world’s praise, but because kindness covers them so deeply that they forget themselves, rushing straight into peril. Their sincerity arises from within.\n\nThe noble person’s sorrow is not for outward correctness but arises from within. One must examine their conduct.\n\nSorrow and distress refer to penal law. Execution and punishment are not the proper Way. They are employed only to punish evil and encourage good, as a last resort, and must not be wantonly applied. The sage feels no shame before the sun and moon; the noble do not commit wrongdoing. The noble person is cautious in solitude, meaning they do not deceive even in darkness and seclusion. To abandon what is near and seek what is distant is to invite obstruction. To neglect self-cultivation while demanding it of others is to invite blockage.\n\nThus when the sage is in high position, the people delight in their governance; when in low position, the people admire their intent, for their resolve never wavers from desiring to benefit others. With their resolve set on benefiting others, all people rejoice and admire them.\n\nLaozi said: When a brave warrior lets out a single cry, the entire army retreats—such is the power of his sincerity. A single shout from the brave strikes terror into ten thousand. The worthy govern the age, and all under heaven look to them. If one sings and none respond, or offers counsel and none bear it, there must be discord within. For their principles differ from others’. One who corrects all under heaven without leaving their seat seeks the cause within themselves. When joy and sorrow are shared with the people, and likes and dislikes are aligned with them, then by examining oneself, one can transform others.\n\nThus where persuasion does not reach, one’s demeanor does; though it may not convey the subtlest essence, it can approximate one’s bearing. Where demeanor does not reach, subtle influence does—arising from the heart and taking form, it moves through spiritual resonance, not through outward appearance. The utmost refinement can be perceived through form, yet cannot be forced into clarity. Though form arises from the formless, the purest essence gives birth to all forms, making them manifest. One does not seek refinement, yet refinement resides within.\n\nLaozi said: Words have their source, affairs have their root. Lose the source and root, and no matter how many skills one possesses, it is better to speak little. Take the Dao as the source and virtue as the root; depart from them, and abundance is no match for simplicity. To harm the many, Yu the craftsman would sever his own finger to demonstrate that great skill cannot be forced. True skill resides in the heart, not in the fingers—cutting off what cannot be attained. When the Dao is in the heart, clarity does not depend on grand words. To value words as if they were the Dao is to hope in vain for the Dao.\n\nThus the craftsman’s wisdom lies not in their ability but in knowing when to close. The craftsman—an artisan—closes with skill, for the most adept know how to seal tightly, so none can open. The unskilled rely solely on brute force, and though strong, they will inevitably fail. This illustrates the exhaustion of subtle wisdom, for strength alone is insufficient.\n\nLaozi said: The sage’s undertakings may follow different paths, yet they converge in the same end. Though past and present differ, governance remains the same. Preservation and ruin, stability and collapse—if one’s resolve never wavers from desiring to benefit others, then the ruined are preserved, the collapsed are stabilized. Is this concern only for oneself? It is always for the benefit of others.\n\nThus the songs of Qin, Chu, Yan, and Wei differ in sound yet all express joy; the wails of the Nine Yi and Eight Di differ in sound yet all convey sorrow. Song is the manifestation of joy, weeping the expression of sorrow—concealed within, it emerges without, and thus the means of moving others. Sound and breath resonate, sorrow and joy summon one another. Therefore, though songs differ by nation, all share in joy; though wails vary by region, all share in grief.\n\nThe sage’s heart never ceases, day or night, from desiring to benefit others. The reach of their virtue is thus vast. By unceasingly benefiting others, their influence extends far and wide.\n\nLaozi said: When people act without contrivance, there is governance. To act is to harm the governance of non-action. To practice non-action is to act; those who cannot act without contrivance cannot truly act. To speak of non-action is still to act; to act is to depart from the governance of non-action. Only by acting without acting is there true non-action.\n\nWhen people remain silent, the spirit speaks—yet to cling to silence harms the spirit’s true nature. The spirit values silence; even the sage does not force speech. Words reveal traces, actions reveal the coarse. Only when both are unharmed can the Dao be preserved whole.\n\nWenzi said: A name can be forcibly established, merit can be forcibly achieved—this is the way of encouragement. Formerly, Nanrong Chu, a disciple of Laozi, felt shame that the sagely Dao was absent within himself. He traveled south to see Laozi and received a single teaching. His spirit became enlightened, and though he endured hardship and toil, fasting for ten days, he savored the Dao as if feasting on the finest delicacies. Having received a single teaching, he meditated for ten days, forgetting hunger and tasting the Dao as if enjoying a grand banquet.\n\nThus his wisdom illuminated all within the seas, his name endured through later generations, his intelligence and strategy spanned heaven and earth, his discernment was as keen as distinguishing autumn down. His praises and eloquent words continue unceasing to this day—this is what it means for a name to be forcibly established. The ultimate teaching, once received, dissolves all doubts like the sun’s reflection illuminating a dark room.\n\nThus the farmer who does not exert himself will not fill his granary; the official who does not strive will not refine their sincerity; the general and minister who do not exert themselves will not achieve great deeds; the king and lord who are indolent will leave no name for posterity. From commoners to kings and lords, none have filled their granaries or made their names illustrious without diligence and effort.\n\nThe perfected person acts in concealment, like thunder hidden away. They act in accordance with the times, establish merit through available resources, advance and retreat without difficulty, and nothing is impassable. The great person’s Dao is hidden and still—none under heaven can perceive their actions. Yet when thunder strikes, none under heaven fail to hear it. They advance without elation, retreat without shame—this is the great Dao.\n\nThe perfected person’s essence and sincerity take form within, their virtue flowing to the four directions. Seeing benefit for all under heaven, they rejoice yet do not forget the harm that may befall them, trembling as if in mourning. They welcome benefit yet fear encountering harm. One who sorrows with the people’s sorrow will have the people sorrow with their sorrow; one who rejoices with the people’s joy will have the people rejoice with their joy. Thus to sorrow with all under heaven and rejoice with all under heaven—yet fail to become king—has never been.\n\nTo sorrow with the people is to have the people sorrow with you; to rejoice with the people is to have the people rejoice with you. One who shares sorrow and joy with the people yet fails to win their allegiance has never been.\n\nThe sage’s law begins where it cannot be seen and ends where it cannot be reached. Their virtue and righteousness know no bounds, their beginning and end no limits. They dwell in unshakable ground, stand where non-action prevails. They amass from inexhaustible granaries, using without depletion; they draw from unfailing treasuries, circulating without end.\n\nTheir decrees flow like the source of a river, guiding the people to offices of no contention. When commands are issued, the people know the prohibitions; when affairs are simplified, officials have no disputes. They open doors that must be entered, secure the people in their occupations. They do not attempt what cannot be accomplished, do not seek what cannot be obtained, do not dwell where they cannot endure, do not act where they cannot recover.\n\nThe great person’s decrees bring only benefit when enacted, and what they establish endures. They do not dwell where they cannot last, do not seek what cannot be regained. The great person enacts governance that brings joy, and none fail to follow their commands. When commands are obeyed, one advances from small to great; when commands are defied, good becomes harm and success becomes failure.\n\nIn their governance and teaching, obedience turns misfortune to fortune, while defiance reduces the great to the small. The one called a true great person is inwardly strong and outwardly luminous—internally as steadfast as heaven and earth, externally as radiant as sun and moon. Heaven and earth cover and bear all, sun and moon illuminate all. To be like heaven and earth in covering and bearing, like sun and moon in illumination—this is the true great person.\n\nThe great person shows goodness to others without altering their fundamental ways, without changing their constant principles. All under heaven follow their commands as grass bends to the wind. To alter the fundamentals unsettles customs; to follow nature makes the people easy to govern. Grass bends to the wind—none dare defy it.\n\nWhen governance errs in spring, Jupiter waxes and wanes, abandoning its regular path. When governance errs in summer, Mars moves in reverse. When governance errs in autumn, Venus appears where it should not, its movements erratic. When governance errs in winter, Mercury fails to appear in its proper place. When the four seasons lose their order, Saturn sways unsteadily, the sun and moon display omens, the five planets move in chaos, and comets appear. When the seasons are disordered and the five planets lose their regularity, celestial omens appear in the heavens, and disaster befalls humanity.\n\nIf spring governance is not lost, millet and grain flourish; if summer governance is not lost, rain falls in season; if autumn governance is not lost, the people prosper; if winter governance is not lost, the state enjoys peace and well-being. Thus the enlightened ruler must not lose proper governance. When the ruler loses governance, heaven sends down a hundred calamities. When the ruler upholds governance, heaven sends down a hundred blessings. The joy of one becomes the joy of ten thousand.\n\n**The Nine Guardians**\n\nThis chapter contains nine sections, hence the title *The Nine Guardians*. Nine is the culminating number of the *Yi*. When clarity reaches its limit, change occurs, and change leads to deviation from the Dao. Those who guard it abide in stillness—like the dragon at its zenith, free from regret—and may transcend the Three Pure Realms. Those who neglect it, like a barren mare, will sink beneath the Nine Dark Abysses. Thus, one must guard the Dao and never lose constancy.\n\nLaozi said: Before heaven and earth took form, all was dark and indistinct, merged as one, the qi and its manifestations undivided. Silent and limpid, the heavy and turbid settled as earth, the refined and subtle rose as heaven—thus were shapes and substances established. Separating, they became the four seasons: spring’s birth, summer’s growth, autumn’s harvest, winter’s storage. Dividing, they became yin and yang, and hardness and softness were set forth. Refined qi became humans, coarse qi became creatures. Their origin is one, yet their endowment differs; qi has purity and turbidity, things have refinement and coarseness. Through the interplay of hardness and softness, the myriad things are born. From this, transformations extend endlessly.\n\nSpirit and essence derive from heaven; bones and flesh root in earth. That which derives from heaven inclines upward; that which derives from earth inclines downward. When spirit enters its gate and bones return to their root, what remains of me? Entering the gate of the boundless, returning to the root of creation, who, if not utterly sincere in their truth, can claim a self? Thus, the sage models heaven and follows earth, unbound by custom, unenticed by others. Heaven is their father, earth their mother; yin and yang their warp, the four seasons their weft. Soaring between heaven and earth, they tread the warp and weft, roaming in the realm of self-attainment, dwelling in the abode of non-action. Custom cannot bind them, the world cannot entice them.\n\nHeaven is still and clear; earth is settled and tranquil. The myriad things that oppose them perish; those that accord with them live. Heaven has no intent regarding opposition or accord—yet humans bring upon themselves calamity and ruin. Thus, stillness and silence are the dwelling of spirit and clarity; emptiness and nothingness are the abode of the Dao. The Dao resides in quietude; spirit wanders in the utmost void.\n\nSpirit and essence are received from heaven; bones and flesh are endowed by earth. Heaven’s qi, clear and transformative, becomes spirit; earth’s qi, heavy and congealing, becomes bones and flesh—hence the term \"endowment.\" The Dao gives birth to the One: heaven. The One gives birth to the Two: earth. The Two give birth to the Three: humanity. The Three give birth to the myriad things. Their transformations are vast. The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, harmonized by the qi between them. All are softened and harmonized by qi.\n\nLaozi said: Humans receive the transformations of heaven and earth and are born between them, dwelling above the myriad things. In the first month, the essence congeals. In the second, blood and vessels form, and the embryo’s shape appears. In the third, the embryo takes form, and the residence of spirit is fixed. In the fourth, the fetus develops; in the fifth, the sinews; in the sixth, the bones; in the seventh, the form is complete, and the orifices open, granting clarity. In the eighth, movement begins, and spirit descends with its numinous power. In the ninth, restlessness arises as the palaces and chambers arrange themselves to secure the essence. In the tenth, birth occurs, and the myriad images are complete.\n\nOnce the physical form is fully shaped, the five viscera divide. The liver governs the eyes, the kidneys the ears, the spleen the tongue, the lungs the nose, and the gallbladder the mouth. Here, only four viscera are mentioned—modern accounts differ, and the details remain unclear. The exterior is the surface; the interior is the core. The head is round, modeling heaven; the feet are square, resembling earth. A single human body encompasses the myriad images—it must not be treated lightly.\n\nHeaven has four seasons, five phases, nine luminaries, and three hundred sixty days; humans have four limbs, five viscera, nine orifices, and three hundred sixty joints. Heaven has wind, rain, cold, and heat; humans have taking and giving, joy and anger. The gallbladder corresponds to clouds, the lungs to qi, the spleen to wind, the kidneys to rain, and the liver to thunder. Humans resemble heaven and earth, with the heart as their master.\n\nThe heart governs the body, overseeing the five viscera, six bowels, four limbs, and nine orifices. Above, it connects to heaven; below, it responds to earth; in between, it harmonizes with the myriad things. This is what is called \"spirit.\" The common people use it daily yet do not know it; those who understand this Dao are few.\n\nThe ears and eyes are the sun and moon; blood and qi are wind and rain. When the sun and moon lose their course, they dim and eclipse; when wind and rain are untimely, they destroy and bring disaster. Heaven has sun and moon, which must not be dim; wind and rain, which must be regulated. When they are untimely or unregulated, disaster follows. Humans have ears and eyes, which must be clear; blood and vessels, which must be balanced. When they are disharmonious or unbalanced, illness arises.\n\nWhen the five stars lose their course, the states and regions suffer their misfortune. Where the five stars trespass, the corresponding lands endure calamity. When the five viscera are afflicted by evil, the whole body falls ill. The Dao of heaven and earth is vast and great, yet it still regulates its brilliance and cherishes its spirit and clarity. How can human ears and eyes endure constant stimulation without rest, or spirit and essence gallop without exhaustion?\n\nHeaven and earth, though vast, regulate the four seasons and harmonize the five planets, protecting their spirit and clarity. How much more so for humans, who employ their ears and eyes and let their hearts and thoughts race—can they preserve their nature and spirit? Thus, the sage guards the inner and does not lose the outer, preserving spirit within and protecting the physical form without.\n\nBlood and qi are humanity’s splendor; the five viscera are humanity’s essence. When blood and qi focus inward and do not stray outward, the chest and abdomen are full, and desires diminish. Observing the surface reveals the interior; seeing the root reveals the branch. When desires arise within, splendor fades without; when essence and qi harmonize within, the flesh and skin flourish without.\n\nWhen desires are few, the ears and eyes are clear, and hearing and sight are keen—this is called \"clarity.\" Clarity leaves nothing unperceived; brightness leaves nothing unilluminated. All arise from restraining passions and cutting off desires. When the five viscera remain aligned with the heart and do not stray, qi and intent prevail, and conduct is not perverse. When spirit is abundant and qi does not scatter, hearing leaves nothing unheard, sight leaves nothing unseen, and nothing is left unaccomplished.\n\nBy rightly settling the heart, the five viscera remain free from evil, wayward qi disperses, and the function of spirit and essence becomes bright. Nothing subtle is left unilluminated, nothing hidden is left unexamined, no affair is left unfinished, and no task is left unaccomplished.\n\nTroubles and misfortunes have no means to enter, and wayward qi cannot invade. In movement and action, constancy in rectitude ensures calamities vanish of themselves. When inner essence does not dissipate, external evils cannot penetrate. Thus, those who seek much gain little, and those who perceive broadly know narrowly. To seek abundance from scarcity, to infer the great from the small—this is clarity.\n\nThe orifices are the doors and windows of spirit; blood and qi are the messengers and sentinels of the five viscera. Open the doors and windows, and spirit becomes luminous, its dark mirror bright; unobstruct the messengers, and the five viscera flow freely, free from disorder. When ears and eyes are indulgent in sounds and sights, the five viscera tremble and cannot settle, blood and qi surge and do not rest, spirit gallops and does not abide. Though blessings and misfortunes arrive like mountains, there is no means to perceive them.\n\nBewildered by sounds and sights, one enslaves the spirit, forgetting both self and other. Like still water, where even a hair’s breadth is visible, when one is obscured, even mountain-like calamities go unseen. Thus, the sage cherishes without transgressing; though desires may flow, they are ever restrained and regulated, never seeking what lies beyond. If the sage ensures ears and eyes are keen and profoundly penetrating, free from allure and longing, intent and qi unerring in clarity, with few desires, the five viscera find peace. Spirit guards within the form without straying, and one may observe beyond past ages, within future affairs, and between fortune and misfortune—all becomes fully visible.\n\nThe sage knows that desires obscure and obstruct clarity, so they unify heart and qi to halt disorder, guard spirit without transgression, and thus the truths of inner and outer become visible, the omens of fortune and misfortune naturally clear. Therefore, the farther one strays, the less one knows. Chasing distant things, prizing the near and valuing the self—what is discarded is great, what is gained is small. This speaks to spirit: it must not be allowed to stray outward. The five colors confuse the eyes, rendering them unclear; the five tones enter the ears, dulling their acuity; the five flavors disorder the mouth, causing sores and decay.\n\nExternal desires bring internal harm. Pursuits and aversions disturb the heart, making conduct reckless. Desires cause qi to overflow, likes and dislikes exhaust the essence. If not swiftly abandoned, aspiration and qi daily diminish. When essence and qi leak away, form and spirit daily fade. The reason people cannot fulfill their natural lifespan is their excessive indulgence in life. \"Excessive indulgence\" means insatiable craving, seeking only gratification—truly, self-estrangement.\n\nOnly those who do not treat life as paramount attain longevity. Not treating life as paramount means not indulging excessively; not indulging excessively means not dwelling in places of certain death. Heaven and earth move and interpenetrate; the myriad things converge as one. To know the One is to know all; not to know the One is to know nothing. From heaven and earth to the myriad things, endless cycles all ride upon the One, giving rise to the ten thousand kinds. Though diverse, they share a root in the One. Thus, to know the myriad things as One is to comprehend all principles; not to know them as One is to fail in every encounter.\n\nI dwell in the world as one thing among things—yet things are also things. How can things be distinguished from one another? This reveals the profound unity of self and other, where preferences and aversions have no ground. Thus, I dwell in the world as but one thing among the world’s things. Being of the same kind, how can they be distinguished? When self and other are both forgotten, right and wrong dissolve, and the blade glides through emptiness—this is the great mastery of preserving the true.\n\nDesire for life cannot be served; aversion to death cannot be refused. Desires cannot be indulged, affairs cannot be multiplied. The lowly cannot be despised, nor the noble rejoiced in. Nobility and baseness find their proper place—where then lie likes and dislikes? Follow one’s endowment and find tranquility, daring not to exceed. Not exceeding, one attains the utmost joy.\n\nThis passage summarizes the Nine Guardians as the utmost sincerity for governing the state and cultivating the self. Those who turn toward the Dao should carefully ponder its essence.\n\n**The Nine Guardians of Unity**\nLaozi said: The so-called sage accords with the times and finds peace in their position, delights in their work amid the age. What others find uneasy, they make supremely peaceful; what others find joyless, they make supremely joyful. Grief and joy are deviations of virtue; likes and dislikes are burdens of the heart; pleasure and anger are transgressions of the Dao. The common person has them; the Daoist does not. In life, they follow the movement of heaven; in death, they transform with things. Life is not mine to possess—thus it is called \"heaven’s movement.\" Death is not my end—thus it is called \"transformation with things.\"\n\nAt rest, they unite with yin in virtue; in motion, they harmonize with yang in its current—this is movement and stillness without losing their rectitude. The heart is the life of the form; spirit is the treasure of the heart. Spirit is the abode of the heart, what people hold most precious. When the form labors without rest, it withers; when essence is used without cease, it depletes. Thus, the sage honors this and dares not transgress. The form is the dwelling of spirit; essence is the numen of qi. They depend on one another to preside; if they part, death follows. The sage values them and dares not use them lightly.\n\nResponding to being with non-being, one must exhaust its principles; receiving the full with emptiness, one must fathom its limits. The myriad things arise from nothing, and nothing is not possessed. Heaven and earth receive with emptiness, and nothing is not contained. Serene, joyful, empty, and still, one fulfills their mandate. Preserving emptiness and stillness, one penetrates life and death. Nothing is estranged, nothing is favored. In nobility, one is not favored; in baseness, one is not estranged. Embracing virtue and kindling harmony, one accords with heaven, joins with the Dao as their boundary, and neighbors with virtue. They do not initiate fortune, nor precede calamity. Death and life bring no change to them—thus they are called \"utterly spirit-like.\"\n\nAccordant with the Dao and virtue, equal in death and life, fortune cannot aid them, nor calamity overthrow them. If not utterly spirit-like, how could one be thus?\n\nThe spirit-like attains all it seeks and accomplishes all it undertakes. Able to align with the Dao of heaven and earth, to unite in virtue with the numinous, whatever it seeks is attained, whatever it does is accomplished—this may be called \"utterly spirit-like.\" Abiding in nothingness, Laozi said: \"Lightening the world, the spirit remains unburdened; refining the myriad things, the mind is not deluded. If one does not treat the world as a thief of the myriad things, how can the spirit be burdened? If one is not a thief of the myriad things, how can the mind be deceived?\"\n\nEqualizing life and death, the will is not cowed; harmonizing with transformation, clarity is not dazzled. Knowing that life and death are but provisional names, one is not terrified; recognizing that transformation is but empty illusion, one is not startled. The perfected person leans upon an unshakable pillar, walks an unbounded path—the unshakable pillar is the Dao, the unbounded path is virtue. With the Dao as their pillar, they do not topple; with virtue as their path, all destinations are fitting.\n\nDrawing from an inexhaustible storehouse, the spirit’s use is limitless. Learning from an undying teacher, their foundation is non-arising. There is nowhere they do not succeed, nothing they do not penetrate. In bending and stretching, bowing and rising, they embrace their mandate without confusion, navigating fortune and misfortune with ease. Profit and harm cannot trouble their heart; life and death do not press upon them—how could profit and harm weigh upon their mind?\n\nThose who uphold righteousness may be pressed by benevolence but cannot be coerced by force; those who preserve righteousness may be exhorted by the Way of benevolence but cannot be threatened by military might. They may be guided by righteousness but cannot be lured by profit—valuing righteousness, they disdain profit. The noble person dies for righteousness and cannot be detained by wealth or honor; they would rather tread the path of righteousness unto death than live in ignoble prosperity. Those who act for righteousness cannot be frightened by death, for they die for righteousness and forget life—how much more so for those who practice non-action?\n\nThe non-acting are without burden; the unburdened take the world as a shadow pillar—a shadow pillar is emptiness and nothingness. Devoid of form and substance, where can burdens cling? If those who preserve righteousness cannot be threatened by force, how much less can those who embody the Dao be frightened by death?\n\nGazing upward at the ranks of the perfected, deeply tracing the intent of the Dao and virtue, and examining below the conduct of the vulgar world, one finds ample cause for advancement. To advance is to progress. Observing the past and present, embracing the Dao and guarding virtue, deeply understanding the purport—this is sufficient for cultivation.\n\nThose who do not treat the world as their own are like striking a drum to silence it. The rulers of high antiquity, without exception, took the world as their own, not contemplating the ultimate Dao, acting with blatant self-interest—they were like one who beats a drum seeking silence, yet no response comes.\n\nLaozi said: \"High rank and great profit are what people covet, yet compared to the self, they are base. Those who value rank esteem the world and belittle the self. Those who cultivate the Dao treasure the self and disdain wealth. Thus, the sage eats enough to fill the void and join qi, wears enough to cover the body and ward off cold, satisfies their nature and rejects excess, neither coveting gain nor hoarding abundance, content with sufficiency and discarding the surplus.\n\n\"With eyes clear, they do not see; with ears still, they do not hear; with mouth closed, they do not speak; with mind released, they do not ponder. They discard cleverness and return to primal simplicity, rest the spirit and abandon knowledge, without likes or dislikes—this is called 'great penetration.' To remove defilement and cast off burdens, nothing surpasses never having departed from one’s origin. What could not be accomplished? Never having departed from one’s origin means abiding in original emptiness and quiescence, without craving or attachment—thus the myriad entanglements, all defilements and burdens, arise. Therefore, to dispel and cleanse, return to the origin and restore simplicity.\n\n\"Those who know the harmony of nurturing life cannot be lured by profit; those who align the inner and outer tokens cannot be enticed by power. Coveting profit harms life; yearning for the world obstructs the Dao—these are what the perfected do not do. The outer of the without-outer is supremely great; the inner of the without-inner is supremely noble. Able to know the great and noble, where do they not succeed? The great Dao emerges without outer, enters without inner—nothing it does not penetrate, and this may be called 'supremely noble.'\"\n\nLaozi said: \"The ancients who embodied the Dao ordered their nature and emotions, governed their mind and techniques, nurtured them with harmony, and maintained them with suitability. Delighting in the Dao, they forgot baseness; content in virtue, they forgot poverty. Attaining the harmony of nature and emotions, they forgot the distinctions of poverty and lowliness.\n\n\"Nature has what it does not desire; without desire, nothing is unattained. The heart has what it does not delight in; without delight, all that suits is achieved. With desire, what is desired is never enough; without delight, all that is fitting is fulfilled. What does not benefit nature is not used to burden virtue; what does not aid life is not used to disturb harmony. Fame and profit harm virtue; cravings and desires injure life—thus they are not pursued.\n\n\"Not indulging the self or giving free rein to desires, yet their standards can serve as models for the world. Naturally able to be reverent and cautious, they may serve as exemplars. Eating according to the belly’s measure, clothing according to the body’s form, dwelling to shelter the self, acting to suit the emotions, possessing the world without claiming it, entrusting the myriad things without profiting from them—how could they lose their nature and life over poverty or wealth, nobility or baseness? Those who are thus may be said to embody the Dao.\n\n\"Only those who embody the Dao and know contentment possess the world in surplus without profiting from the myriad things—how could they follow desires and harm their nature and life?\"\n\nLaozi said: \"People receive qi from heaven—the ears and eyes in relation to sounds and sights, the nose and mouth in relation to fragrances and odors, the skin and flesh in relation to cold and warmth—their nature is one. Noble and base share this. Some die, some live; some become noble persons, some petty persons—the means by which they are governed differ. What they desire is the same; what they attain is different. Following the heart’s desires, they are controlled by things.\n\n\"Nature has worthy and foolish, emotions have thick and thin. Thus some are noble, some base; some die, some live—it is not uniform. The spirit is the abyss of wisdom; when the spirit is clear, wisdom is bright, and nothing is left unreflected. Wisdom is the storehouse of the heart; when wisdom is impartial, the heart is level.\"\n\nThe mind moves without private gain.\nNo one gazes into flowing water to see their reflection,\nbut gazes into still water—\nbecause it is clear and tranquil.\nWater does not become clear by itself to reflect,\nnor does the spirit reside without clarity.\n\nThus, when the spirit is clear and the mind is level,\none can discern the true nature of things.\nOnly clarity and levelness\ncan perceive the essence of things.\n\nTherefore, those who act must rely on those who do not act.\nThis is the interplay of *you* and *wu* (having and non-having),\nof form and spirit in mutual preservation.\n\nA mirror’s clarity means dust cannot soil it,\na spirit’s clarity means desires cannot mislead.\nClarity preserves the body from defilement,\npurity preserves the spirit from error.\n\nWhen the heart reaches its limit,\nthe spirit responds with presence—\nheart and spirit in communion,\nso when the heart arrives, the spirit abides.\n\nReturning to emptiness,\nagitation dissolves, breath hides—\nthis is the play of the Sage.\n\nThe heart knows no restlessness, the spirit’s luminosity drifts freely.\nThus, to govern the world,\none must first grasp the nature of life and destiny.\n\n**On Upholding the True:**\nLaozi said:\nThe so-called Sage adapts to nature alone.\nEating to fill the belly, clothing to suit the body,\nrestraining oneself—\nthus, the heart of greed cannot arise.\nCutting off greed, nature finds its ease;\nrestraining food, vitality remains whole.\n\nTherefore, those who can possess the world\nmust not cling to the world.\nThose who can possess the world\ndo not cling to it;\nthose who earn renown\ndo not seek it through transgression.\nThose who attain great renown and govern the world\ndo not act with arrogance.\nThus, the world willingly follows without exhaustion,\nand though praised, the Sage does not boast—\nso the people revere him without burden.\n\nWhen one truly understands life and destiny,\nbenevolence and righteousness follow naturally.\n\nUnless one discerns the divisions of success and failure,\nthe dispositions of people and things,\nthe world will come of its own accord,\nand the people will attach themselves naturally.\n\nAs for the spirit unobstructed, the heart unburdened,\nopen and uncluttered, serene and unconcerned—\npower and profit cannot tempt,\nsounds and colors cannot seduce,\neloquence cannot persuade,\nwisdom cannot sway,\ncourage cannot frighten—\nthis is the play of the True Person.\n\nThe spirit’s clarity is such that things cannot obscure it,\naffairs cannot confuse it.\nThough power may topple kings and nobles,\nwealth accumulate like mountains,\nsounds linger like clouds,\ncolors bewitch nations,\neloquence flows like chains,\nwisdom rushes like rivers,\ncourage surpasses lifting weights—\neven an ordinary man cannot be swayed,\nhow much less the True Person?\n\nThe ever-generating does not generate,\nthe ever-transforming does not transform.\nOnly the non-generating can generate,\nthe non-transforming can transform.\nNeither generating nor transforming,\nyet it is the root of all generation.\n\nThose who do not grasp this Dao,\nthough they may organize heaven and earth,\nilluminate sun and moon,\nunravel intricate arguments,\nor polish words like gold and stone—\nit profits nothing in governing the world.\n\nNot knowing the principles of life and destiny,\nnot heeding the subtle shifts of danger—\nthough they may revel in qi that swallows the cosmos,\nor debate like rivers—\nthough called divine, they are rotten.\nWhat use are they to the world?\n\nThus, the Sage does not abandon his foundation.\nWhat he despises is power and fame;\nwhat he values is virtue and the Dao.\n\n**On Cultivating Stillness:**\nLaozi said:\nStillness, tranquility, and simplicity—\nthese nourish life.\nHarmony, ease, and emptiness—\nthese establish virtue.\n\nWithout tranquility and ease,\nhow could one preserve the Dao?\nExternal chaos does not disturb the internal—\nnature finds its proper place.\nStillness and non-action bring harmony—\nvirtue settles into its rightful position.\nNourishing life to sustain the world,\nembracing virtue to complete one’s years—\nthis is to embody the Dao.\n\nExternal things cannot disrupt,\ninternal harmony arises naturally.\nNurtured with substance,\nit returns to its natural state.\n\nThus, blood and vessels flow without stagnation,\nthe five viscera gather no excess qi.\nCalamity and fortune cannot sway,\npraise and blame cannot soil.\nBody and mind are open and unrestrained,\nemotions and qi flow freely.\nFortune and misfortune are indistinct,\npraise and blame are irrelevant.\n\nWithout its age, who could save it?\nEven with talent but no fitting time,\nthe body itself cannot escape—\nhow much less without the Dao?\n\nWhen ruler and subject meet,\nit is like dragons responding—\nextraordinary rulers use extraordinary people,\na rare encounter, once in a thousand years.\nNow, talent may suffice for the age,\nyet the times lack virtue—\nthe heart should transcend conventions,\nwithout further seeking.\nThus, Wen Zheng met his end,\nFan Li drifted on the river.\n\nHence, the wise and foolish differ by vast distances.\n\nHe who examines the tip of autumn hair\ncannot hear the thunder’s roar.\nHe who tunes to the sounds of gold and jade\ncannot see Tai Shan’s form.\nThus, when one focuses on the small,\nthe great is forgotten.\n\nConcentrating the eyes blinds the ears,\nfixing the gaze dulls hearing.\nThough thunder’s roar is not faint,\nthe deaf do not hear it—\nnot because they are deaf,\nbut because the heart does not divide its attention.\nThough Tai Shan’s form is not small,\nthe blind do not see it—\nnot because they are blind,\nbut because the will does not serve multiple purposes.\n\nThus, those who see profit forget the Dao,\nwho submit to things abandon their bodies—\nmany are such cases.\n\nNow, all things come and seize our life,\npluck our essence like springs—\nthough one might wish to avoid them,\nhow could it be done?\n\nThe pleasures of sound and color,\nthe delights of taste,\nthe allure of gold and jade—\nthey bewilder and dim the mind,\nobscure the spirit.\nThey gather like wine cups,\ndeepening into vast chasms.\nUnless one is a True Person,\nhow could they rise like wings to the heavens,\nor soar like hairpins over the sea of wisdom?\n\nNow, if water in a basin is made clear,\nit takes days to see one’s eyebrows—\nyet if muddy, even a moment’s disturbance\nprevents seeing even a square inch.\n\nHuman spirit is hard to clarify but easy to muddy—\nlike water in a basin.\nCommon emotions are easily stained by convention.\nKnowing that which is easily stained,\none must fortify the difficult path.\n\nWater’s nature resists clarity in a vessel.\nUnderstanding that which resists clarity,\none must remove the easy-to-dim mirror.\n\n**On Upholding the Law:**\nLaozi said:\nThe highest Sage follows Heaven,\ndoing nothing.\n\n「Next, they honor the worthy—this is artificial teaching. Below that, they entrust their ministers. Entrusting ministers is the path of peril and decline, for political power lies with men, and peril and decline have no fixed day.\n\nHonoring the worthy is the root of folly and bewilderment, for when the ruler honors the worthy, those beneath him will distort their nature to conform. Those who distort their nature are not true to their essence, hence the saying: \"folly and bewilderment.\"\n\nFollowing the Dao of Heaven is the Way to govern the cosmos. The Way of ruling the world is to align with Heaven’s movement. To be empty and tranquil is the foundation—empty, so as not to receive; tranquil, so as to hold. By upholding purity and stillness, one can sustain the world and become its sovereign.\n\nKnowing the Way of emptiness and tranquility, one may achieve both beginning and end. Therefore, the Sage rules through stillness and is undone by action. Those who remain in stillness have minds unperturbed; those who govern rightly thus prevent the world from chaos.\n\nHence it is said:\nDo not disturb, do not entangle—\nand all things will naturally clarify.\nDo not alarm, do not terrify—\nand all things will naturally settle.\nThis is called the Dao of Heaven.\n\nDisturbance is agitation; alarm is disorder.\nTo speak of the Way to govern the people thus,\nthen all the myriad folk and myriad things will not lose their place.\n\n**On Guarding Weakness:**\nLaozi said:\nThe Son of Heaven, princes, and dukes\ntreat the world and a single state as their home,\nand all things as their livestock.\nWith the vastness of the world in their embrace,\nand the abundance of all things,\ntheir *qi* becomes overbearing, and their wills grow arrogant.\nThey boast of their greatness—\nthough great, they must perish;\nthey fear their peril—\nthough perilous, they may endure.\n\nThe great act with military force against the small,\nwhile the small defy and oppress those beneath them.\nThose who rely on strength perish,\nand those who oppress others are extinguished.\n\nIf one’s heart is extravagant and broad,\nit is like a gusting wind or violent rain—\nunable to last long.\n\nThe Sage knows that strength and violence cannot endure,\nthus he governs with Dao and virtue,\nholding to the One without action,\nand does not harm the natural flow of *qi*.\nOnly the Sage understands that strength and violence cannot last,\nso he restrains them with virtue and power,\naligning with the natural inclinations of love and dislike—\nthus the harmonious *qi* is unharmed, and great peace is attained.\n\nTo see the small and uphold the weak,\nto retreat without leaving traces,\nis the way to avoid ruin and achieve grandeur.\n\nModel oneself after the rivers and seas:\nthe rivers and seas do not force their way,\nso their achievements and renown naturally manifest.\nThey do not rely on strength,\nso they can fulfill their sovereignty.\nThe Sage’s virtue is not seized,\nand all things come to him naturally.\n\nAs the female principle of Heaven,\nhe endures without death.\nThe Sage’s spirit—\nunclouded in the Nine Abysses,\nunfading in the Three Purities—\noriginates from the boundless beginning,\nhow could it have an end?\n\nHe cherishes himself,\nso his nobility is complete.\nThe might of a thousand chariots,\nwith all things as his achievements and renown,\nholds the heaviest of responsibilities—\nhe cannot treat himself lightly.\nTo treat oneself lightly is to lose one’s achievements and renown.\n\nThe Dao of the Sage is vast,\nyet it completes itself through the small,\nand abundant through the few.\nThe Dao achieves the great through the small,\nand all things follow the multitude while revering the One.\n\nThus, the Sage governs the world with the Dao:\nthe weak, gentle, and subtle—\nthis is seeing the small.\nThe frugal and restrained—\nthis is seeing the few.\nSeeing the small, he achieves the great;\nseeing the few, he fulfills the perfect.\n\nHe who holds the world\ndoes not abandon the ministers of small states,\nso he achieves the great.\nHe who governs himself\ndoes not discard even a fragment of good,\nso he attains perfection.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven\npresses down the high and raises the low,\nreduces the surplus and supplements the deficient.\nHeaven’s Dao abhors excess while favoring humility,\nso the rivers and seas occupy the world’s lowly places,\nand thus all things return to them and revere them.\n\nThe Sage practices humility, purity, and stillness,\ndeclining honors—\nthis is seeing the low.\nThe rivers and seas regard vast capacity as their greatness,\nand the Sage regards humility as supreme.\n\nTo be empty of the heart and without possession—\nthis is seeing insufficiency.\nSeeing the low, one attains the high;\nseeing insufficiency, one fulfills one’s worth.\n\nThe proud cannot endure;\nthe extravagant cannot last;\nthe forceful and rigid perish;\nthe full and self-satisfied are doomed.\nThose who preserve emptiness and weakness endure long,\nwhile the proud and extravagant meet swift ruin.\n\nGusting winds and violent rains do not last a day,\nsmall valleys cannot remain full even for a moment.\nGusting winds and violent rains embody the *qi* of forcefulness,\nso they cannot endure and are extinguished.\nSmall valleys occupy the land of the forceful,\nso they cannot help but be seized.\n\nThus, the Sage holds to the female principle,\nrejecting extravagance and arrogance,\ndaring not to act with the *qi* of forcefulness.\nBy holding to the female principle,\nhe establishes his masculine sovereignty.\nBy not daring to be extravagant or arrogant,\nhe endures long.\n\nOnly when a man does not indulge in arrogance,\nholding to the female principle while embodying the masculine,\ndoes he become the King of the Many Heroes.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe Dao of Heaven reaches its extreme and turns back;\nexcess leads to depletion.\nThe sun and moon are examples of this.\nThus, the Sage daily diminishes himself,\nso his natural *qi* does not dare to be full.\nHe daily advances with the female principle,\nand his virtue and merit do not decline—\nthis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nHeaven’s Dao abhors excess while favoring humility,\nso the Tang and Yu followed it and became great men.\nThe Dao abhors violence and forbids arrogance,\nso Jie and Zhou disregarded it and met ruin.\n\nHuman nature and inclinations\nall favor the high and abhor the low,\nfavor gain and abhor loss,\nfavor profit and abhor harm,\nfavor honor and abhor disgrace,\nfavor nobility and abhor meanness.\nThe common folk act thus,\nso they cannot achieve greatness.\nTo grasp thus is to lose what one seeks.\n\nTherefore, the Sage follows Heaven:\nhe does not act yet achieves,\nhe does not grasp yet attains.\nThe common folk follow convention,\nfavoring high and honor,\nabhorring low and disgrace,\nso they seek to be high yet cannot elevate themselves.\n\nThe Sage follows Heaven,\nneither favoring high and honor\nnor abhorring low and disgrace,\nso he is not honored yet is naturally honored,\nnot high yet is naturally high.\n\nHe shares emotions with others yet differs in the Dao,\nso he endures long.\n\nHe dims his brilliance,\naligning himself with the dust of the common.\nHence, the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors had vessels of warning,\ncalled *yòuzhī* cups.\nWhen they were empty, they stood upright;\nwhen they were full, they overturned.\n\nSuch vessels exist even today,\nto preserve the utmost warning.\nHence, knowing emptiness brings self-preservation,\nwhile excess cannot endure long.»\n\nThe Way of things is such:\nWhen full, it decays;\nwhen the sun is at its zenith, it declines;\nwhen the moon is full, it wanes;\nwhen joy reaches its end, sorrow follows.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven has its waxing and waning,\nThe Way of humanity has its rise and fall—\nsome begin with fortune yet end in misfortune,\nsome find joy in the front yet sorrow in the back.\n\nThus, the wise and learned guard their brilliance with simplicity,\nfor excess in knowledge leads to overanalysis.\nThose with vast learning and eloquence guard with frugality,\nfor unrestrained speech harms what is true.\n\nThe strong and valiant guard with caution,\nfor relying on courage leads to recklessness.\nThe wealthy and noble guard with humility,\nfor clinging to arrogance brings many regrets.\n\nThe Sage who bestows virtue upon the world guards with modesty—\nthese five principles are how the ancient Kings preserved the world.\n\nThose who embody this Way do not seek excess,\nfor only by avoiding excess can one prevent ruin from arising anew.\nDiligently guarding one’s flaws and shortcomings,\nnot allowing them to swell into arrogance—\none who upholds this Way can preserve the world,\nhow much more so a single life?\n\nLaozi said:\nThe Sage closes with yin and opens with yang.\nWhat can be hidden is hidden,\nwhat can be revealed is revealed.\n\nTo reach the state of no joy,\none must first attain the utmost joy—\nno joy, then the highest joy is realized.\nThis is the joy within,\nnot the joy without;\nthus, there is self-joy,\nand thereby self-purpose.\n\nTo be cherished by the world,\none must first be the world’s necessity.\nWhat is prized is not clanging music,\nnor the eight tones,\nnor refined colors or ornate beauty.\n\nWhat is prized is clarity and emptiness,\nthe absence of action and desire—\nthis is the highest joy, yet not sought.\n\nThe joy within, outward,\nbrings joy to others,\nand aligns one with Heaven.\nThe joy without, inward,\nbrings joy to oneself alone,\nand becomes an enemy to the body.\n\nThus, to follow one’s own joy in joying others,\nthis is the essential Way of the world.\nIt does not lie in the external,\nbut in the self;\nnot in others,\nbut in the body.\nWhen the body is at ease,\nall things are gathered in harmony.\n\nTo seek it externally is to oppose the Dao;\nto cultivate it within is to neighbor virtue.\nHence, those who grasp the principles of the heart’s cultivation\nturn their cravings and aversions outward,\nand thus find:\nno delight, no anger,\nno joy, no sorrow—\nall things merge in the mysterious Oneness,\nneither affirming nor denying.\nWhen the heart’s cultivation is clear,\nvirtue and power will naturally form.\n\nSorrow and joy both forgotten,\nlikes and dislikes left in suspension—\nall things unchanging,\nnaturally merge in the mysterious.\n\nThus, the scholar has fixed principles,\nthe woman has unyielding conduct.\nThe scholar’s Way is unshaken—\na thousand deceits cannot alter his resolve.\nThe woman’s conduct is steadfast—\na thousand gold cannot change her virtue.\n\nHe does not need rank to be honored,\nnor wealth to be rich,\nnor strength to be powerful.\nHe does not profit from goods and money,\nnor crave worldly fame.\nHe does not find security in nobility,\nnor peril in lowliness.\nForm and body, qi and purpose,\neach abides in its proper place.\n\nHonoring the Dao, enriching virtue,\nlightening rank, relinquishing profit—\npurpose and qi clear, form and body harmonized.\n\nThe body is the dwelling of life,\nqi is its foundation,\nthe spirit is its ruler.\nIf one loses its place,\nall three are harmed.\n\nThese three—form, spirit, qi—\nif the spirit departs,\nform and qi wither.\nIf one loses its proper place,\nwhere can the three find support?\n\nThus, those who take the spirit as master,\nthe body follows in benefit.\nThose who take the body as master,\nthe spirit follows in harm.\nNurturing the spirit as master,\npeace and stillness reside in the root—\nthen the spirit flows and qi is complete.\n\nNurturing the body as master,\nif desires and harm have not yet taken hold,\nthe body perishes and the spirit flees.\n\nAs for life:\nThe gluttonous, greedy, and desirous,\nare deluded by rank and profit,\nbewitched by fame and position,\nand though they possess others’ wisdom,\ntheir spirit is consumed by worldly pursuits—\nindulging without return,\nthe body’s gates closed in resistance,\nand thus no way to enter.\nHence, there are times of utter forgetfulness and self-loss.\n\nThe spirit and purpose are hard to govern,\nrank and fame are easy to be deceived by.\nOne must guard against inner resistance,\nnever opening to external influences—\nyet still fear losing the means to serve the world,\nand thus never be saved in life.\n\nThe spirit and purpose:\nstillness makes them grow strong each day,\nagitation makes them wither and grow old.\nStillness returns to no agitation,\nand thus loses life.\nTherefore, the Sage nurtures his spirit,\nharmonizes and weakens his qi,\nlevels and smooths his form,\nand rides the Dao’s rise and fall—\nthus, all transformations of things\noccur in perfect accord,\nall changes of affairs\nrespond without fail.\n\nWhen the spirit is harmonized,\nqi is level,\npurpose is strong,\nand form is serene,\none can ride the Dao’s rise and fall,\nadapt to the times’ changes,\nand respond without doubt.\n\n**Embodying Simplicity**\n\nLaozi said:\nThe True Person’s nature aligns with the Dao—\nthus, though he has, he seems without,\nthough he is real, he seems empty.\nHe cultivates within yet does not govern without,\nilluminates the Great Simplicity,\nacts without action and returns to the root.\nHe holds the origin and embraces the spirit,\nwandering in the root of Heaven and Earth—\ndimly resembling the dust and filth,\nfreely roaming in the business of no business.\n\nTo return to the root and embody truth,\nis to wander in the root of Heaven and Earth.\nTo act without action, to have no business,\nis to freely roam in the dust and filth.\n\nMechanical cleverness and contrived skill\nare not carried in the heart.\nHe is certain in the unassumed,\ndoes not shift with things.\nTrue nature is already established,\nexternal things cannot alter it.\nSeeing the transformations of things,\nhe guards their essence—\nhis mind and intent focused within,\npenetrating the unity of calamity and fortune.\nGuarding the root without change,\nseeing transformations without doubt,\nfortune and calamity naturally clear—\nhow can elevation or decline bring burden?\n\nHe dwells without knowing what to do,\nmoves without knowing where to go—\nhis cultivation is effortless, without intent.\nHe knows without learning,\nsees without looking,\naccomplishes without doing,\ndiscerns without governing.\n\nKnowledge comes from the unknown,\nvision from the unseen,\naction from the inaction,\ndiscernment from the undiscerned.\n\nTo know the unknown is true,\nto know the known is false.\nTo respond and move,\nto be pressed and act—\nnot to find one’s own way yet go,\nlike light’s reflection,\nlike shadow’s imitation—\nmoving like light,\nflowing without stagnation.\n\nThe stillness is like a shadow,\ndwelling while following the heart’s intent.\n\nWith the Dao as his guide,\nhe seems to have needs yet remains natural—\nvast and empty,\nclear and tranquil, yet nothing in particular.\n\nHe dwells alone in boundless openness,\nyet suddenly appears to have needs.\n\nHe drifts without attachment,\nyet truly has no concern at all.\n\nA thousand lives as one transformation,\nten thousand forms as one root—\nthough the thousand lives differ,\nthey all ride upon the same transformation;\nthough the ten thousand forms vary,\nthey all emerge from the same emptiness.\n\nHe holds his essence yet does not expend it,\npossesses spirit yet does not employ it,\npreserving within an undisturbed depth,\nwithout outward use or labor.\n\nHe upholds the pristine simplicity of *Taihun*,\nestablishing the utmost refinement within.\nNurturing truth and cultivating spirit,\nhis essence is pure, his spirit refined.\n\nHis sleep knows no dreams,\ncutting off all thought.\nHis wisdom does not sprout,\nholding no other concerns.\nHis movement is formless,\nhis spirit’s work subtle.\nHis stillness is bodiless—\nexisting yet as if nonexistent,\nalive yet as if dead—\nentering and exiting without obstruction,\ncommanding ghosts and spirits,\nascending to the Dao’s borrowed forms—\nthose who now say \"existing is nonexistent,\nliving is death\"\ncall it abandoning the body, discarding intelligence,\nforsaking form and severing wisdom.\n\nThus, entering and exiting without obstruction,\ncommanding ghosts and spirits—\nthis is ascending to the Dao’s borrowed forms.\n\nHe lets his spirit flow freely,\nyet does not lose his original *yuan*—\nthe *yuan* being the refined *qi*.\nDay and night without pause,\nhe harmonizes with all things as spring—\nlike the sun of spring illuminating the ten thousand forms,\nhow could there be any boundary to shift?\n\nThis is the merging of life and transformation within the heart.\nNot relying on external techniques,\nonly the heart aligning with the Dao.\n\nThus, though the body may weaken,\nthe spirit never transforms;\nthough the body may vanish,\nthe spirit remains ever present.\nWith the untransformed responding to transformation,\nthrough myriad changes and endless turns,\nyet never reaching an end—\nonly the untransformed can transform,\nso hidden and revealed are boundless,\nchanges and transformations endless.\n\nTransformation returns to the formless,\nthe untransformed coexists with Heaven and Earth—\nso the ever-emerging never truly emerges,\nits emergence is the very transformation;\ntransformation never truly transforms,\nits transformation is the very transformation.\nAll things receive life and transformation,\nyet cannot help but be born and transformed.\nThus, it sinks into the formless,\nyet Heaven and Earth can generate and transform without ceasing.\nTherefore, it is always generating, always transforming.\n\nThis is the true person’s wandering,\nthe pure and refined Dao.\n\nSpeaking of pure *qi* and exquisite subtlety,\nwandering the path of neither birth nor transformation—\nthus he is called the true person.\n\n**End of Scroll Three of *Tongxuan Zhenjing***\n#1 Love: Original *\"Shòu\"* (授), corrected to *\"Zhě\"* (者) per the Qú edition.\n#2 *Zhě*: Original *\"Yě\"* (也), corrected per the Qú edition.\n\n**Scroll Four of *Tongxuan Zhenjing*, with notes by Mòxī Zǐ.**\n\n**Scroll Four of *Tongxuan Zhenjing* (Continued)**\n\n**On the Symbol (符):**\nThe *symbol* is the *contract* (契).\nThe *word* is the *principle* (理).\nThus, through the subtle interplay of words and principles,\none awakens to the Dao and forgets the words—\nthis is indeed profound.\n\nLaozi says:\nThe Dao is most exalted, without surpassing above,\nmost profound, without limit below.\nAbove, it transcends the highest;\nbelow, it reaches the lowest—\nthus it can be both lofty and profound,\nascending and descending.\n\nLevel as the plumb-line, straight as the square.\nIt is not the balance that makes it level,\nyet there is no place not even.\nIt is not the square that makes it straight,\nyet there is no place not upright.\n\nRound as the compass, square as the carpenter’s rule—\nit is not roundness that makes it round,\nyet there is no roundness;\nit is not squareness that makes it square,\nyet there is no square.\n\nIt encompasses Heaven and Earth,\nyet has no exterior or interior.\nIts greatness knows no outer bound,\nits subtlety knows no inner void.\nPiercing as a covering, yet unobstructed—\nthe great circle has no edge,\nthe great passage has no hindrance.\n\nThus, those who embody the Dao:\nneither angry nor joyful,\nsitting without care,\nsleeping without dreams,\nseeing things yet naming them not,\nactions arising yet responding naturally.\n*(As previously explained.)*\n\nLaozi says:\nThose who cling to fame as a corpse\nmust generate affairs—\nwhen affairs arise, they abandon the public for the private.\nThose who cling to fame as a master\nmust have affairs—\nwhen affairs arise, they lose harmony.\nThus, abandon fame and seek harmony.\n\nTo double the Dao and trust oneself,\nto see praise and act virtuously,\nto stand and be called \"accomplished\"—\n*double* means to betray.\nBetraying the Dao to seek praise is not true joy.\nConforming to trends to gain fame is not true virtue.\n\nIf governance does not align with principle,\nand actions do not follow the times,\ngovernance misaligned with principle brings many reproaches,\nactions misaligned with the times yield no merit.\nTo align with principle is to use little effort yet achieve great deeds;\nto ride the times is to expend much force yet see little gain.\n\nTo contrive for centrality—\nwhen success is achieved, it is insufficient to fulfill obligations,\nwhen failure occurs, it brings ruin to oneself.\nThose who seek fame and immediate results,\nwho pursue harmony with the times—\ntheir undertakings are unfinished,\ntheir failures extend to themselves.\n\nLaozi says:\nDo not be a corpse of fame,\ndo not be a treasury of schemes,\ndo not be a burden of affairs,\ndo not be a master of cleverness.\nHide in the formless,\nact without weariness.\nDo not precede blessings,\ndo not initiate calamities.\nMove without taking the lead—\nthen there is no form,\nand no form means no welcome of fortune.\nRespond only when called—\nthen there is no weariness,\nand no weariness means no future calamities.\n\nBegin in the formless,\nact only when unavoidable.\nTo desire blessings first is to invite calamities;\nto seek profit first is to court harm.\nTo govern before signs appear is to invite blessings;\nto cut off extraordinary gains is to avoid harm.\n\nThus, those who act without action yet find peace—\nif they lose what they rest in, they become perilous.\nThose who govern without action yet rule—\nif they lose what they govern, they bring chaos.\nTo lose what one rests in means\nabandoning inner peace to seek it externally—\nthen one is constrained.\nTo lose what one governs means\nforsaking oneself to govern others—\nthen one is deluded.\n\nThus, do not be like jade, polished and coveted,\nnor like stone, rejected and ignored.\nFor jade and stone have their distinctions,\nyet contention arises from them.\nThe finest carvings strip the skin,\nthe most beautiful horns bring slaughter.\nSweet springs will dry up,\nstraight trees will be felled.\nThings of beauty invite harm,\npeople who crave fame summon misfortune.\n\nFine words bring later regret—\nfirst to adorn speech,\nthen to invite ruin upon oneself.\nMountains yield jade, yet their peaks are scarred;\nmountains that hide treasure are dug up.\nPeople who speak carelessly invite calamities.\nThe commoner’s woes begin with idle words.\n\nMoreover, the virtuous must be cautious—\neven then, they have threefold silence.\nThe petty-minded, with their loose tongues,\nhow can they avoid disaster?\n\nLaozi says:\nThe times move, and actions follow—\nthose who do not know Dao turn blessings into calamities.\nPeople follow the times in their actions,\nyet those who do not know Dao perish in their blessings.\n\nThe sage governs through the Dao:\nknowing beforehand life and death,\nmeasuring beforehand gain and loss.\nThus, expanding or contracting is without fixed form,\nhonor and disgrace do not disturb—\nonly then does one attain completion,\nand good fortune preserves the body.\n\nAs for the ignorant,\nthey often receive blessings yet act tyrannically—\nthus, when blessings reach their peak, calamities arise.\nIt is not that blessings and calamities cancel each other,\nbut that their actions are misaligned with their use.\n\nHeaven is the covering, Earth is the axle—\nthose who skillfully use the Dao will never be exhausted.\nEarth as the axle, Heaven as the covering—\nthose who skillfully use the Dao will never be harmed.\nTo use Earth as the axle is to cover without limit, all beneficent.\nTo use Heaven as the covering is to move without end, yet cause no harm.\n\nThe Five Phases are arranged—\neach has its victor:\nMetal and Fire attack each other.\nThe King of Chu succeeded in turn.\n\nWhat Heaven covers is without exception,\nHeaven’s Dao is vast and all-inclusive.\n\nThus, to know without knowing is superior,\nto not know while knowing is illness.\nTo know the unknown is virtue,\nto not know while knowing is folly.\n\nLaozi says:\nMountains produce metal,\nstones produce jade—\nyet they erode each other.\nTrees breed worms,\nwhich devour them.\nPeople create affairs,\nwhich destroy themselves.\nFame brings the Dao’s decline,\nundertakings invite harm.\n\nThose who love affairs never fail to be entangled,\nthose who seek profit never fail to be exhausted.\nNo one crosses water without wetting their feet,\nno one walks in dust without staining their body.\nSkilled swimmers drown,\nskilled riders fall—\neach perishes by their own inclination.\n\nBoasting of ability destroys their merit,\nflaunting strength destroys their lives.\nIt must be so.\n\nSuccess lies in timing, not in struggle,\ngovernance lies in the Dao, not in the sage.\nTiming is naturally obtained,\nno need for forced contention.\nThe Dao lies in self-respect—\nwhy bother with boasting of wisdom?\n\nEarth dwells low yet does not vie for height,\nthus it is stable and not perilous.\nWater flows downward yet does not compete for speed,\nthus it departs and is not delayed.\n\nWhat makes the Dao precious,\nwhat the virtuous hold in esteem—\nis to be high without contending,\nto be swift without haste.\n\nThus, the sage holds nothing fast and so loses nothing,\nacts without action and so meets no defeat.\nThe Dao has no form or shape,\ncannot be grasped—\nto seize it is to lose it.\nIt is not a physical body,\ncannot be carved—\nto force it is to fail.\n\nLaozi says:\nOne word cannot be exhausted,\ntwo words make the world’s foundation,\nthree words make the feudal lords mighty,\nfour words make the world’s pairs.\n\nSincerity and trust cannot be exhausted,\nvirtue and Dao make the world’s foundation,\npromoting the worthy makes the feudal lords mighty,\nhating the few and loving the many makes the world’s pairs.\n\n「Whoever attains all four phrases,\nascends to become the **Emperor** or **Son of Heaven**,\nwhile those who grasp only one\ndescend to become **Conquerors** or **Assistants**.\n\nLaozi says:\nHumans have three deaths,\nthough not by fate.\n\nThose who speak of \"not by fate\"\nare themselves the cause.\n\nExcessive indulgence in food and drink,\ndespising one’s own worth,\nbrings illness that kills;\nunrestrained pleasure,\nendless craving,\ninvites punishment that kills;\nto assault the many with few,\nto challenge the strong with weakness,\ninvokes war that kills.\n\nThus, death and life lie within us,\nmisfortune and blessing have no gate—\nthey do not descend from Heaven,\nbut arise from human deeds.\n\nLaozi says:\nThe greater the gift,\nthe finer the return;\nthe deeper the grudge,\nthe graver the calamity.\n\nTo give little yet expect much,\nto harbor resentment yet seek no harm—\nsuch things do not exist.\n\nObserve how one proceeds,\nand one shall know whence they came.\n\nGreat deeds bring great rewards,\ndeep grudges invite great woes;\naccording to their weight,\none leaves behind neither favor nor enmity.\n\nLaozi says:\nFathom **Heavenly Fate** (*tiān mìng*),\nrefine one’s **inner cultivation** (*xīn shù*),\nbalance **affection and aversion** (*hào zēng*),\nharmonize **emotions and nature** (*qíng xìng*),\nand the **Dao** is thus mastered.\n\nTo fathom **Heavenly Fate** (*tiān mìng*)\nis to remain undisturbed by misfortune and blessing;\nto refine one’s **inner cultivation** (*xīn shù*)\nis to neither recklessly rejoice nor rage;\nto balance **affection and aversion** (*hào zēng*)\nis to avoid wasteful greed;\nto harmonize **emotions and nature** (*qíng xìng*)\nis to restrain desire without excess;\nto remain undisturbed by misfortune and blessing\nis to move and rest in accordance with **Nature’s Way** (*lǐ*);\nto neither recklessly rejoice nor rage\nis to neither favor nor punish arbitrarily;\nto avoid wasteful greed\nis to not let desire harm one’s **True Nature** (*xìng*);\nto restrain desire without excess\nis to nurture life by knowing contentment.\n\nAll these four principles\nrequire no external seeking,\nno reliance on others—\nthey are attained by turning inward.\n\nTo comprehend these four is to be **greatly enlightened** (*dà tōng*).\n\nDo not depend on others,\nonly simplify and purify oneself.\n\nLaozi says:\nDo not seek to justify one’s actions,\ndo not resent others for criticizing you—\nif one acts without deceit,\nwhy would others blame you?\n\nCultivate the **virtue of benevolence and forgiveness** (*rén shù*),\nand you will have no cause to reproach others.\nIf you strive for **unfailing reputation** (*rú*),\nyet do not seek others’ praise,\nand trust only in your own self-cultivation—\nyou cannot ensure misfortune will not come,\nnor that blessing will always arrive.\nYou cannot prevent unforeseen calamity,\nnor can you compel fate to grant your wishes.\nBlessing that must come,\nyou must receive when it arrives.\nMisfortune that comes,\nis not of your own making—\nso though in straits, why worry?\nBlessing that comes,\nis not of your own doing—\nso though prosperous, why boast?\n\nThus, one finds joy in **idleness and ease** (*xián jū*),\ngoverns without **action** (*wéi*),\nand drifts content in **tranquility and freedom** (*yōu yóu*).\n\nLaozi says:\nThe **Dao**-practitioner guards what they already possess,\nand does not seek what they have not yet attained.\nTo seek what they have not yet attained\nis to lose what they already possess;\nto follow what they already possess\nis to gain what they desire.\n\nWhat one already possesses is the **spirit of the body** (*shēn qíng*),\nwhat one has not yet attained are **multifarious techniques** (*qí shù*).\nNow, if one abandons the **spirit of the body** (*shēn qíng*)\nand begs for **multifarious techniques** (*qí shù*),\nthe unattained will not arrive,\nand what was attained will be forgotten.\nOne cannot safeguard the **origin of attainment** (*dé yī*),\nnor can one undo the **regret of double loss** (*liáng shī*).\n\nThus, the **Perfect Person** (*zhì rén*) holds fast to their **root** (*běn*),\ndoes not chase after **external methods** (*mò*),\nvalues what is **innerly attained** (*nèi*),\nand governs what is **externally imposed** (*wài*).\n\nIf governance is not yet **firmly established** (*wèi gu*),\nyet one acts as if governing—\nthis is perilous.\nIf conduct is not yet **free from fault** (*wú fēi*),\nyet one rushes to seek fame—\nthis is self-destructive.\n\nWhen the **root is firm**, the state is at peace;\nwhen conduct is **comprehensive**, one suffers no disgrace.\n\nThus, no blessing is greater than **freedom from misfortune**,\nno gain is greater than **avoiding loss**.\n\nTo be free from misfortune is the **height of blessing**,\nto avoid loss is the **greatest of gains**.\n\nThus, some things may seem to bring **benefit** yet cause **harm**,\nwhile others may seem to bring **harm** yet cause **benefit**.\nOnly when free from misfortune and blessing\ndoes one escape both **harm** and **benefit**.\n\nWhat cannot be **urged** to seek **gain**\nis the way to **settle the spirit** (*ān shén*)\nand **avoid peril**.\n\nThe **Dao** cannot be **lured** by **gain**,\nfor without **gain**, there is no **harm**—\nthus the spirit is naturally at ease,\nand the **Dao** comes effortlessly.\n\nTherefore, one who **tastes no misfortune** does not **taste blessing**,\none who **commits no wrong** does not **earn merit**.\n\nTo be free from misfortune and blessing,\nfree from wrong and merit—\nthis is called **great enlightenment** (*dà tōng*).\n\nThe **Dao** speaks thus:\n**\"Vague and indistinct** (*máng máng mèi mèi*),\nfollow **Heaven’s majesty** (*tīan wēi*),\nalign with **Heaven’s qi** (*tīan qì*),\nwithout thought or calculation,\nwithout scheming or storing.\"\n\nThe **Dao** says:\n\"Is the **Dao** a **ruler** (*jūn*)?\"\n\n**\"Vague and indistinct\"** (*máng mèi*)\nrefers to the **Dao’s profound mystery** (*yǎo míng*), unseen by mortals.\n\nNow, if one merely **imitates Heaven** (*fǎ tiān*) with **emptiness** (*xū*),\n**preserves the body** (*shēn*) with **non-action** (*wú*),\nand **refines the heart** (*xīn*) without **scheming** (*lǜ*)—\nthen **virtues accumulate** (*wù jī*) without effort,\nand **things manifest** (*shí chéng*) without labor.\n\n**Departing** is not **forced away**,\n**arriving** is not **summoned**—\none simply **allows it to unfold naturally** (*rèn zī zì dé*).\n\nThough humans move **east, west, south, or north**,\nthey stand **alone at the center** (*zì yú zhōng yāng*),\ntheir **bodies respond to things** (*shēn yìng wù*) yet **endure without limit** (*wú qióng*),\nwhile the **Dao abides in the center** (*zhēn qì liú zhuǎn*) and **moves alone** (*dú yùn*).\n\nThus, though surrounded by **crookedness** (*qū*),\none does not lose their **straightness** (*zhí*),\nfor **completeness in flexibility** (*qū quán*) is **greatness**.\n\nTo flow with the **world** (*tiān xià*) yet **never stray** (*bìng liú bù lí qí yù*)\nis the **Dao’s vital breath** (*zhī qì liú zhuǎn*),\nits **true essence** (*zhēn jīng*) ever preserved.\n\nNeither **pursuing goodness** nor **avoiding ugliness**,\none follows **Heaven’s Way** (*tiān dào*),\ndoes not **begin with oneself** (*bù wéi shǐ*),\ndoes not **cling to self** (*bù zhuān jǐ*),\nconforms to **Nature’s principles** (*tiān lǐ*),\ndoes not **prematurely plot** (*bù yù móu*),\ndoes not **reject the appointed time** (*bù qì shí*),\naligns with **Heaven’s decree** (*yǔ tiān wéi qī*),\ndoes not **seek what is obtained** (*bù qiú dé*),\ndoes not **spurn what is blessed** (*bù cí fú*),\nand follows **Heaven’s natural order** (*cóng tiān zhī zé*).\n\n**Heaven** has no **intent** (*wú xīn*) nor **speaks** (*wú yán*),\nyet all **things are born** (*wàn wù shēng rén*).\n**Non-action** (*wú wéi*) and **no scheming** (*wú móu*)\nyet all **affairs are accomplished** (*bǎi shì suì*).\n\nWithin, there is no **extraordinary blessing** (*qí fú*),\nwithout, there is no **extraordinary misfortune** (*qí huò*),\nso misfortune and blessing **do not arise** (*wú huò fú*),\nand thus there is no **human thief** (*rén zéi*).\n\nAll blessings inevitably bring misfortune,\nbut now misfortune and blessing are **concealed** (*yǐ míng*),\nwho then **harms others** (*zéi hài*)?\n\nThus, **great virtue** (*zhì dé*)—\nits words are **like a single axle** (*shìng biāo*),\nits deeds are **like a single blessing** (*shìng fú*),\nthe **hearts of all** (*shàng xià yī xīn*) are unified,\nthere is no **divergence in paths** (*wú qí dào*),\nand those who **perceive things partially** (*piān jiàn*) are **drawn back to error** (*tuì zhī yú xié*).\n\nOpen the **Way** to **goodness** (*kāi dào zhī yú shàn*),\nand the people will **turn toward uprightness** (*mín xiàng fāng yǐ*).\n\nPartial perception is insufficient to **persuade the common folk** (*huà sú*),\nbut the **true Way** (*zhèng dào*) can **guide the people** (*yǒu kě yòu mín*).\n\nLaozi says:\nTo **do good** (*wéi shàn*) is to **exhort** (*quàn*),\nto **do evil** (*wéi bù shàn*) is to **observe and restrain** (*guān quàn*).\nTo **exhort** (*quàn*) is to **invite censure** (*shēng zé*),\nto **observe and restrain** (*guān*) is to **incite resentment** (*shēng huàn*).\n\n**Exhortation** (*quàn*) means **encouraging oneself** (*rén wéi shàn*),\nwhile **observation and restraint** (*guān*) means **seeing one’s own faults** (*chá jiàn jǐ guò*).\nIf one sees their own faults,\nthey will **turn toward uprightness** (*xiàng fāng yǐ*).\n\nOne cannot avoid doing good.\n\nIf one examines their own goodness while seeking out others’ faults to censure them, then misfortune will arise.\nThus, exhorting to goodness while failing to practice it—this is misfortune.\n\nTherefore, the Way cannot be advanced to seek fame,\nbut can be withdrawn to cultivate the self.\nThus, the Sage does not act to seek fame,\nnor does he display knowledge to gain praise.\nGovernance follows natural order,\nand he remains uninvolved in external affairs.\n\nTo advance without embellishing wisdom to seek fame,\nto withdraw and cultivate the self to govern oneself—\nto push matters along naturally,\nhow could one seek human praise?\n\nThe doer may fail to succeed,\nthe seeker may fail to obtain,\nwhile humans may reach their limits,\nthe Way remains unobstructed.\n\nHumans may seek without attaining the Way,\nbut non-action (*wuwei*) suffices to encompass all.\n\nWith wisdom yet without action, one’s efficacy equals that of the unwisely;\nwith ability yet without exertion, one’s virtue equals that of the incapable.\nHaving wisdom yet appearing unwisely,\nhaving ability yet appearing unable—\nwhen the Dao is realized, human talent is extinguished.\n\nThe Sage’s supreme virtue fills within,\nwhile human talent vanishes without—\nthus, having yet appearing as lacking,\nsubstantial yet seeming empty.\n\nHumans and the Way cannot both be manifest;\nif humans love fame, they will not use the Way.\nIf the Way surpasses humans, fame will cease;\nif the Way ceases, human fame will flourish—then danger and ruin follow.\n\nThe Way must be unified;\naffairs cannot be fully dual.\nLaozi says:\nTo let honest men divide wealth,\nit is better to fix portions by casting lots—\nwhy?\nThose with intent in leveling wealth\nare inferior to those without intent.\n\nTo let virtuous men guard wealth,\nit is better to seal the doors and keep it intact—\nfor those with desires among the common folk\nare inferior to those without desires.\n\nCasting lots resolves doubt through non-intent,\nwhile the common folk are constrained by desire.\n\nIf one’s flaws are exposed, resentment arises;\nif one’s ugliness is reflected, one will improve.\nThe wise, when their faults are pointed out, reflect and amend.\nThe foolish, self-praising, claim goodness.\n\nIf one interacts with others without entangling oneself,\none avoids burdens.\nPrioritizing others over oneself,\none will never incur blame.\n\nLaozi says:\nWhen dealing with people,\none does not rely on treasures or gifts,\nbut on humble words—\nsimple offerings yet desires are never exhausted.\nThe noble do not value treasures;\nthey use modest attire and demeanor to show respect.\nIf one practices this,\nover time, desires will not be sated.\n\nHumble bearing avoids reproach;\ndiscourse without entanglement—\nbinding oaths and alliances,\nonce agreed, are fulfilled as originally promised.\nThe noble’s bonds are not forged by oaths;\na single word suffices to settle matters for life.\nThe petty’s bonds rely on pledges,\nyet within days, they betray their former agreements.\n\nThus, the noble do not externally display virtue and righteousness\nwhile internally cultivating morality and virtue.\nInternally, they embody sincerity and purity;\nexternally, they have no false adornment.\n\nThey govern affairs within their domain,\nexpand their territory’s reach,\nexhort the people to defend to the death,\nstrengthen their walls and fortifications,\nand unite the people to protect the ancestral altars.\nThey do not attack the innocent for gain,\nnor do they assault what is difficult to obtain—\nthis is the Way of absolute preservation,\nthe principle of absolute benefit.\n\nSharing benefits with the people,\nthe people will gladly die for them.\nSharing intentions with the people,\nthe people will steadfastly defend them.\n\nThose who seek fame are not greedy;\nthose who seek profit do not overstep boundaries—\nthis is the Sage-King’s Way,\nthe shared defense of the ancestral altars,\nthe unified fortification of borders.\n\nLaozi says:\nThe Sage does not conquer his heart,\nwhile the common folk do not conquer their desires.\nWhen the heart prevails, the Way is complete;\nwhen desires prevail, the heart is in peril.\n\nThe noble act with upright qi,\nthe petty act with perverse qi.\nInternally, it aligns with nature;\nexternally, it conforms to righteousness—\nmoving according to principle,\nunconstrained by external things—this is upright qi.\n\nIndulging in tastes and sounds,\nerupting in joy and anger,\nwithout regard for future consequences—this is perverse qi.\n\nPerverse and upright qi harm each other;\ndesires and nature conflict—\nthey cannot coexist,\none flourishes while the other declines.\nThus, the Sage reduces desires and follows nature.\n\nThe eyes love color,\nthe ears love sound,\nthe nose loves fragrance,\nthe mouth loves flavor—\nwhen combined, they bring delight,\nyet never separate from harm and desire.\n\nThe ears, eyes, nose, and mouth\nknow not what they truly desire—\nall are governed by the heart,\neach finding its place.\n\nFrom this, it is clear that desires cannot be fully satisfied.\n\nThe six senses’ desires are all governed by the heart.\nIf qi is upright within,\ndesires will not harm nature.\nIf the heart is perverse externally,\nfalsehood will confuse the true.\n\nThus, uprightness and perversity lie within oneself;\ngain and loss depend on the heart.\nIf the heart is upright,\nhow can external things burden it?\n\nLaozi says:\nTo govern the body and nurture nature,\none must regulate sleep and rest,\nmoderate eating and drinking,\nharmonize joy and anger,\nadapt movement and stillness—\nwhat is internal to oneself is attained,\nand goodness is not sought externally.\nThus, perverse qi has no way to enter.\n\nAdorning the exterior harms the interior;\nindulging emotions harms the spirit—\nthose who see only surface appearances obscure the true.\n\nHe who never forgets his virtue as an honorable man\nwill surely exhaust his nature.\nTo speak of a man’s virtue without pause,\nif even for a moment he is separated from it,\nhe will surely suffer humiliation.\n\nWithin a hundred paces, one must not forget they are a guest,\nlest they burden their form.\n\nTo assist the body and govern nature,\none must moderate drinking and maintain harmony,\nso that the heart’s qi remains balanced within,\nand the spirit may be preserved.\nThe noble are cautious of subtle matters,\nnot because they are distant—\neven within ten steps,\none must consider the danger of rotting wood;\nin the blink of an eye,\nunexpected misfortune may strike—\nhow can one be negligent?\n\nThus, those with splendid plumage are harmed by their bones,\nthose with lush foliage are harmed by their roots—\nnone under heaven can possess dual perfections.\n\nThe phoenix is harmed by its plumage,\nspring blossoms are plucked for their fragrance.\nThings with dual beauties,\naffairs with dual benefits—\nsuch things do not exist.\n\nLaozi says:\nHeaven has light,\nyet does not fear the people’s darkness.\nEarth has wealth,\nyet does not fear the people’s poverty.\n\nHeaven’s Way is bright and expansive,\npenetrating even the deepest obscurity.\nEarth’s bounty nourishes all things,\nits benefits are boundless and reach everywhere.\n\nThe Sage’s supreme virtue and Way\nstands like a towering mountain, unmoving—\nthe traveler takes it as their destination.\nStraightening oneself while fulfilling others,\nnot bestowing, nor receiving in return—\nthus, it is stable and enduring,\nuninvolved with Heaven and Earth,\nand thus cannot be taken,\ncannot be repaid,\nand thus cannot incur resentment.\n\nThe Perfect Person,\nby name and reputation cannot be swayed,\nby harm and desire cannot be toppled—\nsteadfast alone, immovable as a mountain.\n\nWith their constant sufficiency, they do not accept gifts;\nwhen they take, they suffer no loss—\nthus, when given to, they lack no virtue,\nwhen taken from, they incur no resentment,\nand thus they endure forever.\n\nThe skillful in anger must bear many grudges;\nthe skillful in giving must be skillful in taking.\nOnly by following the natural Way of Heaven and Earth\ncan one overcome the rules of the world.\n\nTranscending the realm of joy and anger,\nforgetting the feelings of giving and taking,\nletting things unfold naturally,\nto preserve the fullness of Heaven’s Way.\n\nThus, praise arrives and destruction follows,\ngood fortune comes and misfortune follows—\nbenefits become harms at their outset,\nblessings become calamities before they unfold.\nNot seeking benefit means no harm,\nnot seeking fortune means no misfortune—\nthe body remains whole as its natural state,\nwealth and honor are but transient lodgings.\n\nPraise is what people admire,\ngood fortune is what people covet.\nBut if one does not crave display,\nthere will be slander and resentment—\nunless one utterly rejects praise and good fortune,\nthere will be no slander or resentment.\nIf one neither boasts nor flaunts,\nnaturally there is no calamity nor blessing,\nand virtue and Way remain intact.\n\nThe body remains whole as its natural state,\nwealth and honor are but transient lodgings.\n\nLaozi says:\nThe Sage wears no strange or wondrous garments,\nnor adopts bizarre or ostentatious conduct.\nTheir attire is simple, their actions unobserved—\nthey do not startle the crowd, nor act contrary to others.\nThey are open yet not extravagant,\nhumble yet not fearful,\nhonored yet not flamboyant,\nhidden yet not humiliated,\ndifferent yet not strange—\npoverty and prosperity are but fate.\n\nThus, they are not extravagant nor constrained.\nHonor and obscurity are but the times—\nthus, they are neither flamboyant nor humiliated.\nThough they differ from others,\nwhat is there to find strange?\nTo act in harmony without distinction—\nthis is called Great Harmony.\nWhen actions are without distinction,\nthere is no obstruction—\nthis is Great Harmony.\n\nLaozi says:\nThe Way is to straighten oneself and await fate,\nwhen time arrives, one cannot force it forward,\nwhen time departs, one cannot summon it back—\nthus, the Sage does not advance to seek nor retreat to yield.\nStraightening the body, awaiting fate,\nfollowing the Way, conforming to time—\nnot leading, not resisting.\n\nThree years in accordance with time,\ntime departs and I follow,\nthree years in its absence,\ntime returns and I linger behind—\nneither going nor coming,\nsteadfast in their place.\n\nThis speaks of the excess of going too far ahead,\nthe inadequacy of falling too far behind—\nonly by meeting time without resistance\ncan one stand firm in their place.\n\nThe Dao/Way has no favorites,\nonly virtue does it bestow.\nWhen fortune arrives,\nit is not what one sought—\nthus, they do not boast of their merit.\nWhen calamity comes,\nit is not what one created—\nthus, they do not regret their actions.\nThis has already been explained.\n\nThe mind remains tranquil and unburdened,\nvirtue is not weighed down—\nwithout praise, they do not strive,\nwithout honor or disgrace, they are not shaken.\nThe barking of dogs does not disturb them,\nthey trust in their own nature—\ntruly without excessive desires.\nSelf-illuminated, they have no falsehood—\nthus, they are not shaken nor afraid.\n\nTherefore, those who understand the Way are not confused,\nthose who know fate are not anxious.\nTo know the Way and know fate,\nwhat anxiety, what fear?\n\nWhen the Emperor’s death occurs,\ntheir remains are left in the wild—\ntheir spirits are enshrined in the Hall of Brightness,\nfor the spirit is nobler than the form.\nThis shows the ancient Emperors returning their remains to the wild,\nnot sealing nor erecting tombs,\nto teach the people that all things must end;\nenshrining spirits in the Hall of Brightness,\nnot flattering nor being extravagant,\nto teach the people to know solemnity.\n\nThus, when the spirit governs the form, it prospers;\nwhen the form overcomes the spirit, it declines.\nThough wisdom is employed,\nit must return to the spirit—\nthis is called Great Harmony.\n\nRelying on the spirit, the form remains whole;\nindulging desires, the spirit departs.\nUnless one is truly enlightened,\nhow can they preserve it?\n\nLaozi says:\nThe ancients who preserved themselves\nrejoiced in virtue and forgot disgrace—\nthus, their names did not sway their resolve.\nThey rejoiced in the Way and forgot poverty—\nthus, benefits did not sway their hearts.\nHence, they could be humble yet joyful,\nquiet yet unperturbed.\n\nVirtue and Way complete the body,\npoverty and deficiency bring no shame—\nthe heart and resolve remain unbroken,\nbenefits and fame do not confuse them.\nThus, they can be humble,\njoyful in stillness,\nand unperturbed.\n\nCounting life by numbers,\nworrying over the world’s chaos,\nis like worrying over the drying of the Yellow River—\nweeping to increase it, yet to no avail.\nThus, they do not worry over the world’s chaos,\nbut rejoice in their own self-order—\nsuch a person can speak of the Way.\n\nIt is like one who does not worry over their life’s end,\nbut worries over the world’s disorder—\nweeping a few drops of tears,\ndesiring to augment the Yellow River’s flow—\nthis is of no benefit.\nOnly by forgetting to rule others\nand instead ordering oneself\ncan one speak of the Way.\n\nLaozi says:\nPeople have three resentments—\nthose of high rank are envied by others,\nthose of great office are despised by their superiors,\nthose of abundant wealth are resented by the people.\nHigh yet able to be humble,\nabundant yet able to disperse—\nthis is how one preserves their elemental good fortune.\n\nThe higher the rank, the lower the intent,\nthe greater the office, the smaller the heart,\nthe richer the wealth, the broader the giving—\ncultivating these three, resentment does not arise.\n\nThus, nobility takes humility as its root,\nheight takes lowliness as its foundation.\nIf these three are not cultivated,\ncalamity befalls oneself.\n\nLaozi says:\nWords are used to convey one’s own nature to others,\nlistening is used to receive others’ nature into oneself.\nExpressing one’s own nature to reach others’,\nobtaining others’ intentions to harmonize with one’s own.\n\nIf one is both blind and deaf,\nthe Way of humanity is blocked—\nthus, those afflicted with blindness and deafness\ndo not know how to harmonize.\nIs it only the body that can be blind and deaf?\nThe heart also has its own obstructions—\nthe eyes cannot see the great mountains,\nthe ears cannot hear the thunder—\nthis is the body’s blindness and deafness.\nTo discern a deer or a horse but not their reflections,\nto know chili and wheat yet not their distinctions—\nthis is the blindness and deafness of humanity.\n\nIf one cannot discern even ordinary matters,\nhow much less can they grasp the Great Way?\nThose who do not know how to harmonize\nare of the kind blind and deaf.\n\nThe Way as the ultimate source,\nall things with form arise from it—\nits kinship is vast.\nThose who nourish on grains and breathe on *qi*,\nall attain longevity—\nits lordship is vast.\nAll who possess wisdom learn from it—\nits guidance is vast.\n\nLife arises from the Way as its kin,\nformless yet forming—\nits kinship is great.\nGrains and *qi* are its lords,\nnot conferring longevity—\nits lordship is vast.\nWisdom is its teacher,\nnot conferring enlightenment—\nits guidance is vast.\n\nThe virtue’s generosity is profound,\nwisdom takes learning as its teacher—\nnot a teacher yet teaching—\nits clarity is supreme.\n\nAll men harm the useful with the useless,\ntoiling in vain while wounding deep affections.\nThus knowledge unbroadened knows no end,\nthe noble man ever laments his limits,\nstriving to spur himself onward.\n\nTo ask of *weiqi* while playing *yìshí*,\none’s hearing and seeing grow profound.\nTo redirect *yìshí*’s efforts toward Dao and virtue,\none may attain profound subtlety.\n\nNot to hear nor ask is like the blind and deaf among men.\nTo hear yet not question—this is true blindness and deafness.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"By nature, men’s hearts submit to virtue,\nnot to force—\none may govern with virtue,\nbut never with force.\"*\n\nVirtue comes or does not come of its own accord.\nVirtue bestowed upon others expects no return.\n\nThus the Sage who desires to be honored by others\nfirst honors them,\nwho desires to be esteemed by others\nfirst esteems them,\nwho desires to overcome others\nfirst overcomes himself,\nwho desires to be humble before others\nfirst humbles himself.\nHence nobility and humility, esteem and lowliness—\nDao governs them.\n\nThe ancient Sage-Kings spoke humbly to the people,\nplaced themselves behind them,\nand though the world joyfully pushed them forward,\nthey bore it without resentment,\nthough the world burdened them,\nthey carried it without weariness—\nthis is virtue’s abundance and *qi*’s harmony.\nThus, to give is to take,\nto follow is to lead—\nthis is the subtle Dao.\n\nTo honor others is not to take honor from them,\nto precede others is not to take precedence from them—\nthis is *qi* harmonized with Dao,\nvirtue returning to oneself.\nThus they are pushed forward without resentment,\nborne without burden.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"Few virtues yet many honors—reproach,\nlittle talent yet high rank—danger,\ngreat rewards without great deeds—disaster.\nThus some gain is loss,\nsome loss is gain.\nWhen talent and office do not align,\nruin is inevitable.\nGain and loss follow one another—\ncalamity and fortune verify this.\"*\n\nThe common man knows only to profit from profit,\nyet does not know that harm is profit’s disease.\nOnly the Sage knows harm as profit,\nprofit as harm.\n\nThe common man knows profit as profit,\nyet does not know profit as harm’s root.\nThe Sage knows profit as harm,\ntakes non-harm as profit.\n\nThus twice-planted trees wound their roots,\nhouses hoarding wealth invite later calamity.\nGreat profit turns to harm—\nthis is Heaven’s Way.\nTrees replanted must wound their roots;\nhouses storing treasures must invite ruin upon themselves.\nWhat comes not by intent—\nfirst profit, then harm—\nthis is Heaven’s Way.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"The petty man acts for ‘mere gain,’\nthe noble man acts for ‘mere righteousness.’\nHe who does good does not seek fame,\nyet fame follows him.\nFame does not await profit,\nyet profit comes to him.\nTheir aims are the same,\ntheir ends differ.\nThe petty man acts for ‘mere gain’ as profit,\nand profit follows him.\nThe noble man walks the straight path,\nnot awaiting profit,\nyet profit comes to him.\nThus receiving profit is the same,\nyet meeting harm differs.\nHence action brings benefit—\nloss follows it.\nWords without fixed truth,\nactions without fixed propriety—\nthis is the petty man.\nUnsteady in virtue,\nhe invites shame.\nTo perceive one thing,\nto master one skill—\nthis is the mediocre man.\nHis vision unbroadened,\nhe is confined to one domain.\nTo encompass all and possess all,\nto wield skills and employ talents—\nthis is the Sage.\nTo dismiss the wicked, banish evil,\nto employ the worthy, use the capable—\nthis is the Sage.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"Life is what we borrow,\ndeath is our return.\nThus in times of order, one guards the body with righteousness;\nin times of chaos, one guards righteousness with the body.\nThe day of death is the end of one’s path.\nIn ordered times, one preserves the body with righteousness;\nin chaotic times, one dies for righteousness.\nThus the noble man benefits others—\nthough he dies, he regrets nothing.\nHe views death as returning home,\njust as life’s years.\nThus the noble man need only be cautious in one thing:\nto act in accordance with Dao,\nnever straying from the true path.\n\nLife is what we receive from Heaven,\nfate what we encounter in time.\nTo have talent yet not meet the age—\nthis is Heaven.\nTo seek it has its method,\nto obtain it lies in fate.\nTo meet the time—\nnot to meet Heaven—\nto gain it without joy,\nto lose it without blame.\nThe noble man can do good,\nyet cannot guarantee fortune.\nHe cannot bear to do wrong,\nyet cannot be certain to avoid calamity.\nThe noble man does good,\nyet does not necessarily receive blessing.\nTo abandon evil does not necessarily distance calamity,\nyet he never forsakes righteousness to seek fortune.\nEasy to practice, easy to escape calamity—\nwhy?\nBecause righteousness cannot be altered,\nand the heart harbors no duplicity.\nThus the noble man meets the time and advances,\nobtaining it through righteousness—\nwhat fortune is there?\nHe does not meet the time and retreats,\nyielding with propriety—\nwhat misfortune is there?\nThus though he dwells in poverty and lowliness,\nhe never regrets it—\nhe has found what is truly noble.\nThe noble man does not consider advancement fortune,\nfor righteousness has given it to him.\nHe does not consider misfortune shame,\nfor what is there to regret?\nWhat is cherished—Dao and righteousness—\nhow can it compare to poverty and lowliness?\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"Man has harmonious and discordant *qi*,\nborn from the heart.\nWhen the heart is orderly, *qi* is harmonious;\nwhen the heart is disordered, *qi* is discordant.\nThe heart’s order or disorder lies in Dao and virtue.\nTo attain Dao, the heart is orderly;\nto lose Dao, the heart is disordered.\nAn orderly heart brings yielding,\na disordered heart brings contention.\nYielding brings virtue,\ncontention breeds bandits.\nVirtue brings harmonious *qi*,\nbandits bring discordant *qi.\nUnified in heart, *qi* is harmonious and upright;\ndivided in *qi*, it is discordant and perverse.\nUprightness elevates Dao,\nperversity breeds harm.\nDao persists, the spirit clears,\nclarity brings harmony and order.\nBandits arise, *qi* grows turbid,\nturbidity brings contention and chaos.\nOnce turbid and chaotic,\nruin is inevitable.\nHarmonious *qi* diminishes itself to nourish others,\ndiscordant *qi* diminishes others to nourish itself.\nThese two *qi* may be mastered by Dao\nand governed by oneself.\"*\n\nThe governance of trifles is difficult,\nyet it can be mastered through Dao.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is like the echo responding to sound:\nvirtue accumulates, and blessings arise;\ncalamity accumulates, and grievances arise.\nHumans may act upon it,\nHeaven may observe it—\ngood and evil will surely manifest,\njust as echo follows sound.\n\nOfficial virtue declines when office prospers,\nfilial piety wanes when wives and children thrive.\nCalamity arises from neglecting worry,\ndisease recurs when near recovery.\nThus, to treat the end as the beginning,\nthere will be no failed undertakings.\n\nOfficial virtue fails when law is abandoned,\nfilial piety fades when hidden in private matters.\nThough worry may briefly ease,\ncalamity still lurks.\nWhen near recovery, restraint must still be observed—\nthus, to treat the end as the beginning,\nthere will be no failed undertakings.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"To raise the crooked with the straight—\nhow can this not be wrong?\nTo raise the straight with the crooked—\ndo not let it proceed,\nfor this is like mixing filth with different muds.\"*\n\nKnowing people is not easy;\nwhen selecting them, clarity is essential.\nNow to raise the crooked as straight,\nthe foolish as wise—\nhow can this be like mixing filth with different muds?\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"The sage unifies life and death,\nthe fool also unifies life and death.\nThe sage unifies life and death,\nknowing the distinctions of principle;\nthe fool unifies life and death,\nunaware of where harm and benefit lie.\nThe sage transcends life and death,\nneither benefiting nor harming others,\nthus there is no life or death.\nThe fool distinguishes life and death,\nfixating on gain,\nthus he fears death and life.\"*\n\nDao hangs from Heaven,\nthings spread across Earth,\nharmony rests in humans.\nIf the ruler is not harmonious,\nthen Heaven’s *qi* does not descend,\nEarth’s *qi* does not ascend,\nyin and yang are unbalanced,\nwinds and rains are untimely,\nand the people suffer hunger and sickness.\nDao depends on Heaven,\nthings arise from Earth,\nharmony lies in humans.\n\nHumans are Heaven’s essence,\nEarth’s spirit.\nThus, as ruler over humans,\none must cultivate harmony,\nstabilize *qi*,\nnurture all things—\nthen winds and rains will not falter,\nand calamities will not arise.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"To command ten thousand soldiers\nis not as valuable as hearing one correct word;\nto possess the Huisi pearl\nis not as valuable as knowing the origin of things;\nto possess the He Shi jade\nis not as valuable as knowing the proper course of things.\nOne beneficial word surpasses ten thousand soldiers,\none proper action surpasses precious jade.\nThough the world be vast,\nthose who love war perish;\nthough a state be secure,\nthose who love conflict are endangered.\nThus, small states with few people,\nthough possessing tenfold weapons,\nshould not use them.\nGreat states should cultivate virtue,\nsmall states should serve others—\nthen conquest and war will not arise,\nand all will be at peace.\"*\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"Those who can achieve hegemony and kingship\nmust be certain victors—\nthey do not lead unless first.\nThose who can defeat enemies\nmust be strong—\nwithout virtue, they cannot prevail.\nThose who are strong\nmust rely on human strength,\nand those who rely on human strength\nmust win the people’s hearts—\nusing the worthy’s strength,\ngaining the masses’ loyalty.\nThose who win the people’s hearts\nmust first be self-possessed—\nself-possessed, they are gentle and yielding,\nable to conquer those weaker than themselves,\nyet when facing equals, they yield.\nGentle strength emerges from yielding to equals,\nand their affairs cannot be altered—\nthus, though many oppose them,\nthey achieve great victory.\nOnly through preserving humility and gentleness\ncan they not be bent by the masses,\nthus securing their triumph.\"*\n\nThe *Tongxuan Zhenjing* concludes, Volume Four. #1 [□], the original text unclear.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Zhenjing* concludes, Volume Five. **Defaulted Son’s Annotation** on *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power*:\n\nThis chapter first inquires into *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power*, then returns to *rites and wisdom*.\nThough the previous volume has already made this clear, the inquiry is raised again—\nfor its profound and subtle nature,\nit demands meticulous examination,\nto establish the path for future disciples to awaken to the Way.\n\nThe *Wenzi* asked of *Dao/Way*,\nand the *Laozi* replied:\n*\"Learning and inquiry must be precise,\nlistening to the Way must be profound.\nWithout learning, one does not know;\nwithout precision, one does not reach.\nAll who listen seek to attain wisdom,\nto perfect action,\nor to achieve merit and renown.\nDoubt leads to inquiry,\nlistening demands scrutiny—\nlike striking a bell,\nits resonance must not be hollow.\nOnly then will there be true benefit\nin attaining merit and renown.\nWithout precision, it remains unclear;\nwithout depth, it is not comprehended.\nThus, the highest learning listens with the *spirit*#1,\nscanning the profound without omission.\nThe middle learning listens with the *heart*,\nsometimes retaining, sometimes losing.\nThe lowest learning listens with the *ears*,\nfleeting as the wind passes.\nThose who listen with the *ears*\nhave learning only on the surface,\nthose who listen with the *heart*\nhave learning in the sinews,\nthose who listen with the *spirit*\nhave learning in the marrow.\nThus, if one’s listening is not profound,\none’s knowledge will be unclear;\nif one’s knowledge is unclear,\none cannot exhaust its precision;\nif one cannot exhaust its precision,\none’s actions will not be perfected.\nThe *Dao/Way* and *Virtue/Power* are lofty and wondrous—\nif one sees them clearly,\nthen one’s achievements will stand firm.\n\nThe principle of listening is this:\nan empty mind, serene and tranquil,\ndiminished *qi* without excess,\nno thought, no concern,\neyes never forgetting their gaze,\nears never heedlessly listening—\nconcentrating with unwavering focus#1,\ninternalizing intent fully.\nOnce obtained, it must be steadfastly held,\nenduring forever.\nThis is the method of *spirit-listening*,\nthe path to awakening to the Way.\nOnce obtained, it must be guarded well—\ngood listeners do not forget,\ngood embrace#2 does not slip away.\n\nThe *Dao/Way* originates from the beginningless;\nto listen to its principles, one must first clarify its source.\nIt begins with *gentleness and yielding*,\nyet culminates in *firmness and strength*—\nbegins with *fewness and smallness*,\nyet culminates in *abundance and greatness*.\nA ten-encircled tree begins with a sapling,\na hundred-foot-high terrace begins with a foundation.\nThis is the *Dao/Way* of Heaven.\nFrom non-being to being,\nfrom subtlety to manifestation,\nHeaven’s *Dao/Way* is ever thus—\nhow much more so for humans?\n\nThe Sage follows this *Dao/Way*,\nand thus the humble *lower themselves*#3,\nthe retiring *step back*#3,\nthe frugal *remain modest*#3,\nthe self-diminishing *keep their numbers few*#3.\nBy humbling themselves, they are exalted;\nby stepping back, they take precedence;\nby remaining modest, they grow vast;\nby keeping their numbers few, they become great—\nthis is the *Dao/Way* of Heaven.\n\nMost people exalt themselves while belittling others,\nthus losing what others hold dear.\nThe Sage places others before himself,\nthus gaining what others hold dear.\nThus, to oppose the natural order brings no response,\nwhile to align with Heaven brings spontaneous devotion without coercion.\n\nThe *Dao/Way* is the source of *virtue/power*,\nthe root of Heaven,\nthe gateway to blessings—\nall things await it to arise,\nawait it to flourish,\nawait it to rest in peace.\nThe *Dao/Way* is the sovereign of life and transformation,\n*virtue/power* is the nourishment for cultivation.\nThe root of all things must await it to manifest,\nthe gateway of all blessings must pass through it to unfold.\n\nThe *Dao/Way* is actionless and formless,\nyet through actionlessness all things arise,\nthrough formlessness all things transform.\nInternally, it cultivates the self;\nexternally, it governs the people—\nachievements stand firm,\naffairs are established.\nIn harmony with Heaven,\nit does nothing yet accomplishes all.\nCultivating the self, governing the people—\nactionless and formless,\nin harmony with Heaven,\nin unity with the *Dao/Way*,\nand thus all is at peace.\nNone know its essence,\nnone know its truth—\nyet within its depths, faith resides.\nThough its substance is not perceptible,\nnor its truth recognizable,\nyet within its mysterious expanse,\nfaith is indeed present.\n\nIf the *Son of Heaven*#4 has the *Dao/Way*,\nthen all under Heaven submit,\nand he endures with the *altars of soil and grain*#5.\nIf the *dukes and marquises*#6 have the *Dao/Way*,\nthen the people are harmonious,\nand their states remain unlost.\nIf the *commoners and scholars*#7 have the *Dao/Way*,\nthen they preserve their lives,\nand safeguard their kin.\nFrom the *Son of Heaven* above\nto the commoners below—\nall should guard the *Dao/Way*,\nsecure the state,\nharmonize the people,\npreserve their lives,\nand safeguard their kin.\n\nThe strong and mighty with the *Dao/Way*\nconquer without battle;\nthe weak and small with the *Dao/Way*\ngain without strife;\nundertaking affairs with the *Dao/Way*\nbrings success and blessings.\nRulers and ministers with the *Dao/Way* are loyal and benevolent,\nfathers and sons with the *Dao/Way* are affectionate and filial,\nscholars and commoners with the *Dao/Way* love one another—\nthus, with the *Dao/Way* there is harmony#2,\nwithout the *Dao/Way* there is harshness.\n\nFrom this, it is evident:\nthe *Dao/Way* is fitting for all people.\nTo practice the *Dao/Way* in small ways brings small blessings,\nto practice it in great ways brings great blessings,\nto practice it fully brings all under Heaven’s submission—\nsubmission leads to devotion.\nAll who practice the *Dao/Way*\ntrace their blessings to its roots.\nThus, the *Emperor*#8 is the fitting destination of all under Heaven,\nthe *King*#8 is the path all under Heaven follows—\nif all under Heaven do not find fitting destination or path,\nthen one cannot be called *Emperor* or *King*.\nThis is because they lack the *Dao/Way*—\nthe people do not come of their own accord.\nThough they occupy their positions,\nhow long can they endure?\nThus, without the people, even *Emperors* and *Kings* cannot succeed—\nthe state depends on the people,\nand a stable foundation ensures lasting peace.\nTo gain the people yet lose the *Dao/Way*\nis also unable to endure.\nTo have the people but lack the *Dao/Way*\nis called an *empty state*.\n\nThe greatest crime is to lose the *Dao/Way*,\nthe deepest grudge is to lose *virtue/power*—\nthis is the *Dao/Way* of Heaven.\nGreat crimes and deep grudges\ncannot fail to bring ruin to those who hold states,\ncannot fail to bring death to those who hold lives—\nfor their *Dao/Way* is lost,\ntheir *virtue/power* extinguished—\nthis is Heaven’s reason for their destruction.\n\nThe *Laozi* says:\n*\"Those who practice the *Dao/Way*\nmake others, though bold,\nunable to pierce them with a blade;\nthough cunning,\nunable to strike them.\nIf they are bold yet do not dare to pierce,\nor cunning yet do not dare to strike—\nthis is better than making them, though bold,\nsuffer humiliation without fear of piercing,\nor though cunning,\nsuffer scorn without fear of striking.\nFor those who do not dare to act,\nit is not because they lack intent—\nbut rather to make others lack intent entirely.\"*\n\n「Thus, those who lack intent\nare without hearts of affection or harm—\nthe *Dao/Way*-practitioner is bold yet unharmed by piercing,\nis cunning yet never struck.\nThough called harmless,\nthey are already shamed by the deaf and mocked by the vulgar,\nwhile the extraordinary lies in the *Dao/Way* itself,\nand such is termed child’s play.\n\nBetter is to make others not even conceive the intent to pierce or strike,\nwhile I hold no affection for gain or harm,\nforgetting the artifice of the world—\nthus the *Dao/Way* remains whole.\n\nBetter still is to make all men and women of the world\nwillingly embrace love for gain and harm,\nas if they were naturally inclined—\nfor then, without territory, I may be lord,\nwithout office, I may be chief.\nAll under Heaven willingly seek security and benefit,\nand thus the *Regan* (Regan) of *Shi* (Shi) lineage\nand the *Sucai* (Sucai) of *Kong* (Kong) family\nare but such men.\n\nThus, boldness in daring brings death,\nboldness in not daring brings life.\nBoldness in daring leads to ruin,\nboldness in not daring ensures survival.\n\nWhen *Wenzi* (Wenzi) inquired about *virtue/power*,\n*Xiang* (Xiang) already knew the *Dao/Way*.\nNow he asks again of *virtue/power*,\nwhich includes *ren* (仁) and *yi* (义),\nand follows with *li* (礼) and *zhi* (智).\nUnless he asks broadly,\nhow could he grasp the whole?\n\nThe *Laozi* says:\n*\"To nurture and rear,\nto fulfill and grow—\ncomprehensive benefit without discrimination,\naligning with Heaven and Earth—\nthis is called *virtue/power* (德).\nTo nurture and complete,\nwithout action or selfishness,\nspreading beneficence to all things,\nharmonizing with Heaven and Earth—\nthis is called *ultimate virtue/power* (至德).\n\nWhat is *ren* (仁)?\nIt is: when ruling, not boasting of one’s achievements,\nwhen serving, not shaming one’s faults.\nToward the great, not boasting,\ntoward the small, not deceiving—\ncomprehensive love without selfishness,\nenduring without decay—\nthis is called *ren* (仁).\nThough noble as a Son of Heaven, one does not grow proud,\nthough lowly as a commoner, one does not fret—\nkindness and grace without favor,\nbroadly bestowing and aiding all—\nthis is *ren* (仁).\n\nWhat is *yi* (义)?\nIt is: when ruling, to support the weak,\nwhen serving, to uphold one’s principles.\nWhen prosperous, not to indulge recklessly,\nwhen in adversity, not to abandon one’s integrity—\none course in accordance with reason,\nnever perverting or distorting for private gain—\nthis is called *yi* (义).\nTo uphold the fallen and rescue the drowning,\nto remain steadfast in hardship and guard one’s principles,\nto follow what is appropriate and act in accordance with reason—\nthis is *yi* (义).\n\nWhat is *li* (礼)?\nIt is: when ruling, to be reverent and stern,\nwhen serving, to be humble and respectful.\nTo withdraw and yield, to uphold softness,\nto be the feminine complement to the world—\nto stand where one does not dare,\nto establish where one cannot—\nthis is called *li* (礼).\nTo honor and cherish, to comfort those below,\nto humble oneself and prioritize others,\nto embody the *virtue/power* of modesty and gentleness,\nwithout slackness or arrogance—\nthis is *li* (礼).\n\nThus, refining one’s *virtue/power* makes those below obey,\ncultivating *ren* (仁) makes those below not contend,\npracticing *yi* (义) makes those below fair and upright,\nobserving *li* (礼) makes those below honor and respect.\nWhen all four are refined,\nthe state is secure and peaceful.\nIf any of the four are lacking,\nruling with them brings state collapse,\npracticing them brings self-ruin.\n\nThus, *Dao/Way* is the source of all things,\n*virtue/power* is what sustains growth,\n*ren* (仁) is what brings love,\n*yi* (义) is what brings order,\n*li* (礼) is what brings reverence.\nWhen all five are cultivated,\nthere is none under Heaven who can rival them.\n\nWithout nurturing or rearing,\none cannot fulfill growth.\nWithout kindness or love,\none cannot achieve completion.\nWithout order or rectification,\none cannot endure long.\nWithout reverence or esteem,\none cannot attain nobility and worth.\nThus, *virtue/power* is what the people hold dear,\n*ren* (仁) is what the people cherish,\n*yi* (义) is what the people fear,\n*li* (礼) is what the people revere.\nThese four are the harmonious sequence of *Wenzi* (Wenzi),\nthe means by which the Sage governs all things.\n\nPossessing these four *virtues/powers*,\none is called a Sage—\nthus they can follow Heaven’s will,\nand rule all beings.\n\nIf a *junzi* (君子) lacks *virtue/power*,\nthose below will resent them.\nIf they lack *ren* (仁),\nthose below will contend.\nIf they lack *yi* (义),\nthose below will act violently.\nIf they lack *li* (礼),\nthose below will rebel.\nWhen all four are absent,\nthey are called without *Dao/Way* (无道).\nNone without *Dao/Way* can endure.\n\nWhen the *Dao/Way* is hidden,\nthe four *virtues/powers* are abandoned.\n*Wenzi* (Wenzi) inquired of its beginning and end,\nand the *Laozi* expounded its gains and losses.\nIf all four are neglected,\nresentment and violence will arise,\ncontention and disorder must follow—\nthus, without *Dao/Way*,\nruin is immediate.\n\nThe *Laozi* says:\n*\"In the age of *ultimate virtue/power*,\nmerchants find profit in trade,\nfarmers take joy in the fields,\ngreat officials are content in their duties,\nscholars refine their *Dao/Way*,\nand the people delight in their work.\nWithout the transformation of *ultimate virtue/power*,\nhow could each find joy in their station,\nand take delight in their work?\nThus, the winds and rains do not wither or break,\ngrass and trees do not die young,\nthe Yellow River bears the *Tuxing* (图) [i.e., *Yijing* (易经) eight trigrams],\nthe Luo River yields the *Hongfan* (洪范) [i.e., *Shu* (书) Nine Categories].\nOnly *virtue/power* moves Heaven,\nand beneficence touches all things—\nthis is the Sage’s ultimate governance achieved.\n\nAs the age declines,\ntaxes and levies are without measure,\nslaughter and executions know no end,\nand those who counsel with punishments\nkill the virtuous scholars.\nThus, mountains crumble and rivers dry up,\nserpents writhe without rest,\nand the wilds lack even a hundred stalks of grain.\nThe rulers of the *Jiji* (季) age\nundermine the fundamental principles,\ndestroy the traditions,\nslay the virtuous and favor the flatterers,\nhoard wealth without restraint,\nand neglect duties without end.\n\nDefying *qi* and provoking calamity,\ntheir deeds reach Heaven above,\nwhile stars and constellations behave strangely,\nand their effects manifest on Earth below—\nthus, mountains crumble and rivers run dry,\npeople have no means to survive,\nand all insects and plants lose their proper place.\nOnly the ruler must be warned against this.\n\nThus, in times of order,\nthe foolish cannot act alone in disorder,\nand righteousness does not tolerate the crooked.\nIn times of chaos,\nthe virtuous cannot rule alone.\nFew cannot overcome many.\n\nThe Sage is harmonious, joyful, and tranquil—\nthis is their life.\nThe *Dao/Way* of *ultimate virtue/power* is realized—\nthis is their fate.\nThus, life meets fate,\nand only then can they act.\nFate is obtained,\nand only then can they be clear.\nThere must be their age,\nbefore there can be their person.\n\nLife meets fate,\nand the Sage arises.\nThe lofty *wudi* (梧) tree naturally draws the *lingfeng* (灵凤),\nwhile the shallow pool cannot contain the great scales.\n*Wenzi* (Wenzi) inquired of the Sage’s wisdom,\nasking of the Sage and of wisdom.\n\nThe *Laozi* says:\n*\"To hear and know is wisdom (圣);\nto see and know is insight (智).\nThus, the Sage always hears where misfortune and fortune originate,\nand chooses their *Dao/Way*.\nThe wise always observe where misfortune and fortune take form,\nand choose their actions.\nTo act when one sees opportunity,\nto know difficulty and cease—\nThe Sage knows the *Dao/Way* of Heaven’s auspicious and inauspicious,\nand thus knows where misfortune and fortune originate...\"」\n\nThe wise see the form before it takes shape,\nand thus know the gates of misfortune and fortune.\n\nThe Sage discerns Heaven’s auspicious and inauspicious *borrowing and covering* (倚伏),\nobserving their formlessness before they manifest,\nand thus governs before disorder arises.\n\nThe wise know misfortune and fortune *leaning against each other*,\nand guard against their signs once they appear,\nso they do not wander into their gates.\n\nTo hear what has not yet emerged—this is the Sage.\nTo see the form before it takes shape—this is wisdom.\nThose who neither hear nor see are truly *qumi* (愚迷).\n\nTo hear of what has not yet emerged,\nwho but the Sage could do so?\n\nTo perceive the misfortune already formed,\nwho but the wise could recognize it?\n\nWithout hearing or seeing,\none is indeed *qumi* (愚迷).\n\nThe *Laozi* says:\n*\"If a ruler cherishes *virtue/rightness* (義),\nhe will trust the times and rely on himself,\nabandon the *fate/number* (數) and employ *kindness* (惠).\nPeople act upon the *virtue/rightness* (義) of a single moment,\nwithout considering future calamities,\nneglecting the great *Dao/Way*’s *fate/number* (數),\nand boasting of clever *kindness* (惠).\n\nThis is not the way of an *accomplished ruler* (賢君).\nTo have vast knowledge yet shallow wisdom,\nand to nourish vastness with shallowness—this is impossible.\nPointing to a cup and calling it the sea,\nusing a short rope to draw deep water—\nhow could this ever succeed?\n\nTo rely solely on one’s wisdom,\none’s failures will surely multiply.\nRelying solely on wisdom leads to ruin;\nseeking counsel from many yields approval.\nCherishing wisdom exhausts one’s *skills/arts* (術);\ncherishing valor is the path to peril and destruction.\nTo dazzle in what one knows will bring exhaustion and frustration;\nto act solely on valor without prudence will invite danger and ruin.\n\nTo give freely without fixed measure—\nif the upper levels lack fixed measure,\nthen the lower levels’ expectations will have no end.\nIf one takes much and gives little,\nthe people will become his *enemies* (仇).\nTo take little and give much—\nif the *fate/number* (數) is not just,\nthen giving will be the path to resentment.\n\nIn all giving,\none must first take.\nTo take is to have limits;\nto give is to exhaust.\nTo provide from what is already exhausted\nto meet boundless demands—\nthis is difficult to sustain.\n\nYet to exchange this with that,\none gains here and loses there.\nWhat if taking is not by the *Dao/Way*,\nand giving is not to those who deserve it?\nThe recipient will not rejoice,\nthe giver will make an enemy.\n\nThus, the *virtuous/powerful* (志) Sage abandons the mind of taking and giving,\nand upholds the balanced measure.\nWhere would resentment arise from?\n\nBy this, it is clear:\n*Wealth* (財) is insufficient to govern the *Dao/Way*,\nbut the *Dao/Way* and *skills/arts* (術) can be followed for illumination.\n\nObserving the measures of taking and giving,\none sees that they are the source of enmity and resentment.\nThus, when *wealth* (財) cannot save the times,\nonly the *Dao/Way* can assist the multitudes.\n\n*Wenzi* asked:\n*\"The ancient kings ruled the world through the *Dao/Way*—\nhow did they do so?\"*\n\nAsking about the *Dao/Way* of the ancient kings,\nand admonishing the rulers of their time;\nspeaking of the present’s flaws,\nyet not mentioning the governance of the past—\nwhat should they do?\n\nThe *Laozi* said:\n*\"To hold fast to the One without *action* (為),\nand to follow the transformations of Heaven and Earth—\nthe world is a great vessel.\nThe sovereigns of antiquity did not rule through *divine wonders*,\nbut by conforming to Heaven and Earth,\nholding fast to the One without *action*,\nand harmonizing with the *times* (時).\n\nThe world is a great vessel—\nit cannot be grasped,\nit cannot be made.\nTo make is to ruin it;\nto grasp is to lose it.\nThe *Dao/Way* is subtle yet formless—\nit cannot be grasped;\nto grasp is to err.\nIt is minute yet without fixed shape—\nit cannot be made;\nto make is to ruin it.\n\nTo hold fast to the One is to see the small—\nto see the small is to achieve the great.\nOnly through the One can one govern the multitudes and control things;\nonly through the great can one see the small without neglect.\n\nTo act without *action* is to guard stillness—\nto guard stillness is to bring order to the world.\nTo move without overstepping one’s measure,\nto remain still without stagnating—\nthis is the utmost stillness,\nand thus one can bring order to the world.\n\nTo dwell in fullness yet not overflow,\nto occupy high position yet not be arrogant—\nto dwell in fullness without overflowing,\nto be full yet not depleted;\nto occupy high position without arrogance,\nto be elevated yet not perilous.\nTo be full yet not depleted,\nthis is how one long guards *wealth* (富);\nto be elevated yet not perilous,\nthis is how one long guards *nobility* (貴).\n\n*Wealth* and *nobility* do not depart from one’s person,\nand blessings extend to one’s descendants.\nThe ancient kings’ *Dao/Way* was complete in this.\n\nTo align with the *Dao/Way* of non-*action*,\nand to resonate with the ultimate *Dao/Way*—\nto dwell in fullness yet not overflow,\nto tread in high position yet not be perilous,\nto let *virtue/rightness* (德) permeate all things,\nand to bestow *virtue/power* (德) upon descendants—\nthe bright kings of old\nall upheld this *Dao/Way* to transform the world.\"*\n\nThe *Laozi* says:\n*\"The people have a shared *Dao/Way* to follow,\nand shared laws to uphold.\n*Virtue/Rightness* (義) cannot fix them,\nand *authority* (威) cannot compel them.\nThus, a ruler is established to unify them.\n\nIn corrupt customs and *thin-hearted* (浇薄) people,\nthere is no adherence to the *Dao/Way*,\nno unity in the laws.\nExternally, they adorn themselves with *virtue/rightness* (義) to seek praise,\ninternally, they wield *authority* (威) to subdue the multitudes.\nWithout establishing a ruler,\nhow could they be brought into order?\n\nWhen the ruler holds fast to the One, governance is achieved;\nwhen there is no constancy, disorder arises.\nIf the One is unclear,\nthe ten thousand people lose their foundation.\n\nThe ruler’s *Dao/Way* is not about *action*,\nbut about non-*action*.\nThe wise do not use *virtue/power* (德) for personal gain,\nthe brave do not use strength to oppress,\nthe benevolent do not use their position to bestow favors—\nthis can be called the One.\n\nNot to choose *idle wanderings* (逍) and act recklessly,\nnot to rely on one’s position to indulge in *kindness* (惠),\nbut to preserve all five—\nthis can be called the One.\n\nThe One is the *Dao/Way* of no *adaptation* (適),\nthe root of all things.\nThe One is the law.\n*Adaptation* means *going* (往).\nIf the ruler implements the law to govern,\nthen all things will naturally turn toward the ruler,\nand there will be none that do not *adapt*.\n\nIf the ruler frequently changes his laws,\nthe state will frequently change its rulers,\nand laws will frequently shift,\nwhile rulers will frequently change.\n\nIf the ruler lacks the One,\nthen the people and things will toil in exhaustion,\nand the world will not be at peace.\nIf the ruler has no fixed laws,\nand alters them with each passing time,\nthen there will be no fixed ruler,\nand this will also ruin the people.\n\nBy one’s position,\none’s *likes and dislikes* (好惡) are revealed,\nwhile the lower classes fear and tremble,\nand cannot be governed.\n\nFor all who would be rulers,\nit is proper to steady them with *virtue/power* (德) and *Dao/Way*,\nand not to indulge in arbitrary *likes and dislikes*.\nTo indulge their hearts and minds,\nto exceed proper *rewards and punishments* (賞罰),\nif this is not appropriate,\nthen the lower officials will tremble in fear,\nand fear will lead to excessive *punishments* (刑).\nHow could this be governed?\n\nThus, when a ruler loses the One,\nhis disorder is worse than having no ruler.\nThe ruler must hold fast to the One,\nand only then can the multitudes be united.\n\nThe world submits to the ruler above\nbecause the ruler has the *Dao/Way*.\nNow, if a state has a ruler yet lacks the *Dao/Way*,\nit is as if the people have no master.\nThough they have their master,\nif *wicked ministers* (奸臣) steal his authority,\nand the *virtuous* (賢) suffer harm,\nif *taxation* (敛) is excessive without end,\nand the people and things labor in suffering—\nthus it is said that this is worse than having no ruler.\"*\n\n「文子问曰：王道有几？\n*Wénzǐ asked: What are the number of the Kingly Dao/Way?*\n\n老子曰：一而已矣。\n*Lǎozǐ replied: There is but one.*\n\n皇王之号虽殊，古今之道唯一也。\n*The titles of the sovereigns differ, yet the Dao/Way of antiquity and the present is singular.*\n\n文子曰：古有以道王者，有以兵王者，何其一也？\n*Wénzǐ asked: In antiquity, there were those who ruled by the Dao/Way and those who ruled by force—how can they be singular?*\n\n唐虞揖让，汤武征伐，其不一也。\n*The Sage Kings of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, Tang and Yu, yielded power through humility, while the later kings, Tang of Shang and Wu of Zhou, conquered through warfare—how they differ!*\n\n曰：以道王者，德也；\n*He replied: Those who rule by the Dao/Way do so through virtue/power;*\n\n以兵王者亦德也。\n*those who rule by force also do so through virtue/power.*\n\n道无升降，时有浇淳，\n*The Dao/Way does not rise or fall, yet times shift from corruption to purity,*\n理在变通，义非胶柱，\n*principles lie in adaptability, and righteousness is not rigid like a bound pillar,*\n故适时而举，因资济物，\n*thus, actions are raised to suit the times, and resources are harnessed to benefit the people,*\n大矣哉，其谁知之。\n*great indeed! Who truly understands it?*\n\n且结绳而理，用道以化者，德也。\n*Moreover, even in the age of knotted cords for record-keeping, governing through the Dao/Way is virtue/power.*\n\n夷暴殄逆，用兵而治，亦德也。\n*To pacify the violent and extinguish rebellion through warfare is also virtue/power.*\n\n动不逾正，静不乖道，\n*When in action, one does not exceed propriety; when at rest, one does not stray from the Dao/Way,*\n虽曰凶器，实为至德也。\n*though called a cruel tool, it is truly the utmost virtue/power.*\n\n用兵有五：有义兵，有应兵，有忿兵，有贪兵，有骄兵。\n*The use of arms has five categories: righteous warfare, defensive warfare, vengeful warfare, greedy warfare, and arrogant warfare.*\n\n夫兵者，动有危亡，用有可否也。\n*Warfare, when employed, carries risk of ruin; its use may be just or unjust.*\n\n诛暴救弱，谓之义；\n*To punish the violent and aid the weak is called righteousness;*\n敌来加己，不得已而用之，谓之应；\n*when an enemy attacks and one must defend oneself, using force is called defensive;*\n争小故不胜其心，谓之忿；\n*to fight over petty grievances without overcoming the enemy’s resolve is called vengeful;*\n利人土地，欲人财货，谓之贪；\n*to covet another’s land or wealth is called greedy;*\n恃其国家之大，矜其人民之众，欲见贤於敌国者，谓之骄。\n*to rely on one’s own nation’s strength or populace, seeking to appear more virtuous than the enemy, is called arrogant.*\n\n义兵王，应兵胜，忿兵败，贪兵死，骄兵灭，\n*Righteous warfare brings kingship; defensive warfare brings victory; vengeful warfare brings defeat; greedy warfare brings death; arrogant warfare brings annihilation—*\n此天道也。\n*this is the natural order of the cosmos.*\n\n国有五兵，轻用则死。\n*A nation with these five types of warfare, if used recklessly, will perish.*\n\n败身有五，贼轻用之，则危亡。\n*Self-destruction has five forms: when a ruler employs warfare lightly, his nation faces peril and ruin.*\n\n天道赏善惩奸，其理不差，\n*The Dao/Way of Heaven rewards the virtuous and

rhythms of fortune and misfortune, and to unleash the talents of trickery,*\n抑本趋末，得不危亡也？\n*to suppress the fundamental and pursue the superficial—how could such a ruler not face ruin?*\n\n故守分循理，失之不忧，\n*Thus, one who adheres to one’s proper role and follows principles,*\n得之不喜，\n*does not grieve over loss nor rejoice in gain,*\n成者非所为，得者非所求。\n*success is not something one

sovereign who governs without interference*\n远违其理，近失其道。\n*will stray far from principle and lose the Dao/Way nearby.*\n\n文子问曰：王者得其欢心，为之奈何？\n*Wénzǐ asked: How does a kingly ruler win the people’s affection?*\n\n帝王之理，何以得百姓欢心？\n*The principles of sovereigns—how do they earn the joy of the common folk?*\n\n老子曰：若江海即是也，\n*Lǎozǐ replied: It is like the vastness of rivers and seas—*\n淡兮无味，\n*calm and

measures,*\n非古相返也，\n*not because they rejected antiquity,*\n时务异也，\n*but because the affairs of the times were distinct,*\n是故不法其已成之法，\n*thus, they did not follow the laws already established,*\n而法其所以为法者，\n*but followed the reasons behind those laws,*\n与化推移。\n*adapting them to the changing world.*\n\n道无隆替，而俗有变革，\n*The Dao/Way does not wax or wane, yet customs undergo transformation,*\n是以五帝不同治，\n*that is why the Five Emperors ruled differently,*\n三王不共法。\n*and the Three Kings did not share the same laws.*\n非欲相返，\n*Not because they sought to contradict one another,*\n因时宜者也。\n*but because they followed what suited the times.*\n\n圣人法之可观也，\n*The Sage establishes laws that are observable,*\n其所以作法，不可原也，\n*yet the reasons behind them cannot be traced

did not seek to seize the world,*\n而天下归；\n*yet the world submitted to them;*\n无心利万物，\n*they had no intent to benefit all things,*\n万物自附者也。\n*yet all things naturally attached to them.*\n齐死生则忧惧不能入，\n*Equalizing life and death, their fears could not penetrate,*\n同变化则诡异不能移也。\n*aligning with transformation, their strange schemes could not sway them.*\n\n抱道推诚，\n*Embracing the Dao/Way and extending sincerity,*\n以镜万物之情，\n*like a mirror reflecting the sentiments of all things,*\n神而为镜，\n*a divine mirror,*\n照无不得。\n*nothing escapes its illumination.*\n\n上与道为友，\n*Above, he befriends the Dao/Way,*\n下与化为人。\n*below, he aligns with transformation to be among the people.*\n上与道交，\n*He exchanges with the Dao/Way above,*\n下与化游。\n*and plays with transformation below.*\n\n「Now wishing to learn their Dao/Way, one cannot attain their pristine clarity and lofty sanctity, nor uphold their legal codes and enact their decrees, and thus will assuredly fail to govern effectively.\n\nIndeed, preserving their classics and implementing their laws and institutions relies upon the pristine clarity and lofty sanctity to expound and guide, so that later scholars may know to honor their guidance, applying it internally to cultivate their own bodies and externally to govern the nation.\n\nWhen Wenzi asked about politics, he meant: *politics and teaching*.\n\nLaozi said: *Rule them with the Dao/Way, nurture them with virtue/power, do not display your wisdom, do not exert your strength. Teach them with the Dao/Way, yet do not show them your cleverness. Approach them with virtue/power, yet do not flaunt your authority or might. Subtract from excess and hold fast to the singular, so that there is no advantage to be exploited, no desires to be gratified. The essence lies in purity and emptiness; desires and benefits will naturally perish.*\n\nSquare yet unsevered, sharp yet not piercing—\n*Square yet unsevered,*\n*sharp yet not piercing—*\n*the upright does not harm things,*\n*the sharp does not injure righteousness.*\n*Without arrogance, without self-aggrandizement.*\n\nRule them with the Dao/Way and the people will attach themselves,\nNurture them with virtue/power and they will submit,\nDo not display your wisdom and they will suffice,\nDo not exert your strength and they will remain sincere.\n\nDo not display your wisdom—*this is frugality*,\nDo not exert your strength—*this is restraint*.\nBelow, he gathers them with generosity,\nAbove, he takes them with guile.\nFrugality preserves himself,\nRestraint keeps him secure.\n\nIf he does not gather below, they will disperse,\nIf he does not nurture above, they will rebel,\nIf he displays his wisdom, they will contend,\nIf he exerts his strength, they will resent him.\nTheir dispersion weakens the nation’s might,\nTheir rebellion leaves the ruler without authority,\nTheir contention makes virtue/power seem trivial,\nTheir resentment endangers the ruler’s position.\n\nIf these four are truly cultivated—\n*frugality, nurturing, wisdom without display, authority without violence—*\nthen the true Dao/Way is nearly achieved.\n\nFrugal yet self-preserving,\nNurturing to win the people’s affection,\nWise yet not serving self-interest,\nAuthoritative yet not cruel—\nif these four are all cultivated,\nthen the true Dao/Way is preserved.\n\nLaozi said: *The words spoken above are used below, the words spoken below are used above. The words spoken above are constant usage, the words spoken below are expedient usage.* Only the sage can know how to use expedient measures, speaking yet always trustworthy, setting terms yet always meeting them. Above, the sage speaks of the Dao/Way; below, he employs expedient measures. Only the sage can know how to use them without losing the Dao/Way, skillfully applying expedient measures.\n\nThe petty man uses them and loses his life—\n*he does not understand expedient measures.*\nOnly expedient measures are trustworthy without words,\nand meet expectations without prior agreement.\n\nWhat is the highest conduct in the world?\n*To be upright yet honor one’s father,*\n*to be trustworthy yet die for one’s daughter—*\nwho could value such things?\n\nThe world knows that honoring one’s father is wisdom,\ndying for one’s daughter is trustworthiness,\nyet none can truly esteem them.\nThis is not so.\nTo force one’s nature for uprightness,\nto restrain conduct for sincerity—\nthese are but the deceptive methods of the end times,\nnot the true intent of supreme virtue/power.\nThus, they are not worthy of honor or trust.\n\nTherefore, the sage judges matters as crooked or straight,\nbending or extending with others,\nwithout fixed forms or appearances,\nadjusting to the occasion.\nIf a ruler is praised as virtuous yet drowned,\nor a father reviled as cruel yet buried,\nthis is due to circumstances alone.\n*\"Drowned\"* is pronounced *nà* (祚骨切).\nA ruler praised as virtuous is not so by nature—\n*only when praised does he seem virtuous*,\n*a father reviled as cruel is not so by nature—*\n*only when drowned does he seem acceptable*.\nCircumstances dictate the event—\nwho claims that this is fitting to propriety?\n\nExpedient measures are what the sage alone understands.\n*To first oppose then later conform*—\nthis is called expedient measures.\nTo first conform then oppose—\nthis is not to understand expedient measures,\nand not to understand them is to invite disaster.\n\nThe skilled user of expedient measures—\n*first deceptive, then enlightening*.\nThe unskilled user—\n*begins fortunate, ends calamitous*.\n\nWenzi asked: *Master, without virtue/power and the Dao/Way, one cannot govern the world. The rulers of antiquity, inheriting their predecessors’ achievements, also had those without the Dao/Way yet did not suffer ruin or defeat. How could this be?*\n\nLaozi replied: *From the Son of Heaven down to the common people, each lives as they will. Yet their vitality differs in measure—some flourish, others decline. When nations fall and families break, it is not due to external calamity but to losing the Dao/Way.*\n\nIf virtue/power and the Dao/Way exist,\nthen day and night one remains vigilant,\never fearful of peril and ruin.\nIf they do not exist,\nthen desires run wild and laziness prevails—\ntheir ruin comes without warning.\n\nTo dwell as though already ruined is to leave no remnant of calamity for the nation.\nTo rest in safety and forget danger is to court death at any moment.\nIf Jie and Zhou followed the Dao/Way and practiced virtue/power,\neven if Tang and Wu were wise,\nthey could not have established their achievements.\nWith the Dao/Way, one becomes king;\nwithout it, one faces ruin.\nIt is known that good and evil do not determine kingship.\nThe rise or fall lies with the people—\nthe August Heaven aids virtue/power,\nthis is the natural order.\nHow could it be otherwise?\n\nVirtue/power and the Dao/Way are what nurtures and sustains life,\nwhat fosters growth and affection,\nwhat inspires reverence and esteem.\nEven the deaf worm and blind turtle,\nthough lacking ears,\ndo not harm what they love.\nIf all under heaven harbored hearts of benevolence and righteousness,\nhow could calamity and disaster arise?\n\nThe Dao/Way is vast and encompassing,\nthick and heavy—\nit gives life, sustains it,\nnurtures it, loves it,\nwithout distinction among things,\nfully extending itself to all.\nIf all things were thus,\neven the deaf worm’s stupidity would feel the grace of benevolence—\nwhy fear the rise of calamity and disaster?\n\nWithout the Dao/Way yet free from harm—\nthis is because benevolence has not yet been extinguished\nand righteousness has not yet perished.\nThough benevolence may linger\nand righteousness not yet vanish,\nthe feudal lords will already scorn their ruler.\nWhen feudal lords scorn their ruler,\nthe court will not show proper respect,\neven if they do not openly defy him.\n\nIf a king lacks the Dao/Way,\nyet his lineage and position remain unbroken,\nit is because benevolence and righteousness still linger.\nYet the seeds of misfortune and calamity have already taken root here—\nthe people’s resentment toward their ruler has begun.\nThus, the ruler of Qi descends from his hall to meet the feudal lords,\nand the Duke of Jin convenes alliances at the borderlands—\nthese are signs of a declining age.\n\nWhen benevolence is extinguished and righteousness perishes,\nthe feudal lords rebel,\nand the common people seize power through force and coercion.\nThe strong oppress the weak,\nthe great encroach upon the small—\nthe people take up arms as their livelihood.\nDisasters multiply,\ncalamities arise—\ntheir ruin is inevitable.\nWhy speak of being free from misfortune?»\n\n「When the Dao/Way is lost and virtue/power extinguished,\nwhen benevolence is extinguished and righteousness perishes,\nthere are rulers who are not true rulers,\nand ministers who are not true ministers.\nSuperior and inferior lose their proper stations,\nthe strong oppress the weak—\nthus the Second Emperor of Qin and the later sovereigns of Han,\nthese are the times when states are destroyed and perish.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"When laws are intricate and punishments severe,\nthe people will resort to deceit.\nWhen laws are intricate, they cannot be fully followed,\nand when they are not fully followed,\none enforces severity through punishments—\nbut when punishments are not just,\nthe innocent are ensnared in guilt.\"*\n\nThus, the common people grow reckless, risking death to defy the law,\nand the peril of the world arises from this.\nThe more the ruler acts, the more the subjects rebel;\nthe more he seeks, the less he attains;\nthe more he prohibits, the fewer obey.\nHe creates troubles through his actions,\nyet seeks to suppress them through further actions—\nthis is like fanning flames to extinguish them;\nusing wisdom to breed calamity,\nthen using wisdom to defend against it—\nlike stirring water to seek its clarity.\n\nWhen people are burdened with many affairs, their hearts grow restless,\nand when a state enforces many prohibitions, its people grow weary—\njust as fire cannot be quenched by constant fanning,\nnor water purified by repeated stirring.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"If a ruler favors benevolence,\nhe rewards those without merit\nand pardons those with crimes.\nIf he favors severity,\nhe discards those with merit\nand punishes the innocent.\nWithout fixed preferences,\nhe executes without resentment,\nand gives without expecting virtue in return.\nWhen a ruler has no fixed preferences,\nhis ministers face no unjust punishments,\nthose rewarded do not avoid their fate,\nand those executed hold no grudges.\nHe follows the square and the plumb line,\nuninvolved in affairs,\nlike Heaven and Earth—\nwhy should they not sustain and cover all?\"*\n\nWhen he unites and harmonizes, he is the ruler;\nwhen he separates and punishes, he is the law.\nIf the people are punished without complaint,\nthis is called virtue/power and Dao/Way.\n\nActions follow law and measure,\nvirtue aligns with Heaven and Earth—\nwhen the ruler is enlightened, principles are never obscured,\nand when the law is just, the people suffer no wrongful fate.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"The world’s judgments of right and wrong are not fixed;\neach age upholds what it deems good\nand rejects what it deems evil.\nThose who seek what is right\ndo not seek the Dao/Way,\nbut what aligns with themselves.\nThose who reject what is wrong\ndo not reject evil,\nbut what contradicts their hearts.\nIf I wish to choose what is right and dwell in it,\nor reject what is wrong and discard it,\nI do not know what the world calls right and wrong.\n\nThe world’s people praise what I uphold as right,\nand condemn what I reject as wrong;\nthey also condemn what I praise as good,\nand reject what I uphold as right.\nIf what I uphold is not truly right,\nand what I praise as good is not truly good,\nthen good and evil are undefined,\nand right and wrong are nowhere to be found.\nYet those who satisfy their own desires,\nthough they condemn, still consider it good,\nand though they praise what is good,\nthey do not abandon decay.\nWhat they reject as wrong\nis what contradicts their own hearts—\nthus, there is no right without wrong,\nand no wrong without right.\nThere is no good without evil,\nnor evil without good—\nso the enlightened do not fixate on good and evil,\nnor on right and wrong.\nThus, they govern great states like simmering a delicate broth—\ndo not stir it, lest it spoil.\nGreat states cannot endure chaotic governance?\nDelicate broths cannot bear repeated stirring?\nThose who seek harmony\nmust speak truthfully to foster closeness,\nyet when their bodies are distant and they plot,\nthey invite suspicion.\nSeeking harmony means aligning with the ruler’s favor.\nIf their words are truthful yet their bodies are distant,\nthe ruler will not fully trust them,\nand they will surely be suspected.\nNow I wish to uphold my integrity\nand await the world’s response—\nhow can I know what the world will use to measure me?\nIf I rush to conform with the world,\nI am like one fleeing rain without shelter—\nyet still, I am drenched.\nNow I wish to be the world’s measure and model,\nyet others will also make me their teacher and guide—\nlike one sprinting to avoid rain,\nexhausted and labored,\nyet still unable to escape being wet.\nTo dwell in emptiness is impossible,\nunless one does not seek emptiness and yet emptiness comes naturally—\nthis is how desires are fulfilled without effort.\nEmptiness is without desire;\ndesire is not emptiness.\nWithout the heart’s attachment,\none attains all things.\n\nThus, those who grasp the Dao/Way\nare like a cart’s axle that does not turn for itself,\nyet enables the wheel to reach a thousand miles,\nturning endlessly on the boundless plain.\nThe adept of the Dao/Way\nis the hub of the cart—\nhis body mingles with the world yet finds rest,\nhis spirit dwells in the center yet remains ever still.\nHe does not stray beyond words,\nnor toil for himself—\nthus he turns upon boundless paths,\nand wanders in realms of utter darkness.\nTherefore, the sage embodies the Dao/Way and returns to its source,\ndoes not transform to await transformation,\nand acts without contrivance.\n\nThe sage internally returns to truth,\nexternally adapts to change,\ntouched by emotions yet unstained—\nhe moves and acts without contrivance.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"He who often wages war and frequently wins\nwill surely bring his state to ruin.\nFrequent warfare exhausts the people,\nfrequent victories breed arrogance in the ruler—\nwith an arrogant ruler governing exhausted subjects,\nhow few states can avoid ruin?\nArrogance leads to excess,\nexcess leads to depletion of resources,\nexhaustion breeds resentment,\nresentment leads to extreme measures—\nwhen both ruler and subjects reach extremes,\nno state remains unfallen.\"*\n\nThus, when achievements are complete, the sage withdraws—\nthis is the Dao/Way of Heaven.\nWar should not be waged often,\nthe ruler should not grow arrogant,\nthe people should not be exhausted,\nresources should not be depleted—\nfor when extremes are reached,\nthey return to extremes without ruin.\nWhen King Ping asked Wenzi:\n*\"I have heard that you attained the Dao/Way from Lao Dan.\nNow, though wise men may possess the Dao/Way,\nthey face a depraved and chaotic age—\nwith the authority of one man alone,\nhow can he transform the long-suffering people?\nIs this possible?\"*\nKing Ping refers to the Zhou King Ping.\nThe \"one man\" speaks of the king himself.\nWenzi, the wise man, is the speaker here—\n*\"Though the Dao/Way of virtue/power\nrectifies evil to establish order,\nrestores chaos to bring governance,\nand transforms depravity to return to simplicity,\npure virtue revives,\nand the world attains peace—\nthis depends on one man.\nFor righteousness resides in the heart,\nand governance stems from the ruler.\nWhen the heart weakens, decay follows;\nwhen the ruler governs rightly, order prevails.\nThus, prosperity and decline are not decreed by Heaven,\nsuccess and failure rest within ourselves—\nthey do not depend on external things,\nbut on the Dao/Way we uphold.\nThe value lies in the Dao/Way.\"*\n\nThe Dao/Way rests with one man,\nthen licentious customs may be transformed,\npure virtue revived—\nwhat cause for worry that governance will fail?\n\nThe sovereign is the people’s teacher,\nthe ruler, their model.\nWhen the ruler is virtuous, the people follow;\nwhen the ruler possesses virtue/power,\nthe people cultivate benevolence and righteousness,\nand thus there is no age of licentious chaos.\n\nHence, all under Heaven, bright and clear,\ntake the ruler as their teacher,\nlook to him as their model—\nas water from a thousand-fathom gorge\nmust flow downward, so too do all turn to him.\n\nAccumulate virtue/power and become a sage-king,\naccumulate resentment and court ruin,\naccumulate stones and mountains rise,\naccumulate water and seas form—\nnothing great is achieved without accumulation.\nVirtue unaccumulated is insufficient to earn renown,\nevil unaccumulated is insufficient to destroy oneself.\nThus, the sage-king follows what is accumulated.\n\nHe who accumulates virtue/power\nreceives Heaven’s favor,\ngains Earth’s assistance,\nand is aided by spirits and gods—\nphoenixes soar in his courtyard,\nqilin roam his suburbs,\nand dragons repose in his ponds.\nThus, by accumulating virtue/power,\nhe moves Heaven and Earth,\nand the four spirits manifest auspicious signs,\nwhile all things rejoice in their proper roles.\n\nTo govern under Heaven with the Dao/Way\nis the virtue/power of the world;\nto govern under Heaven without the Dao/Way\nis the world’s ruin.\nTo set oneself against the world as an enemy,\neven if one seeks longevity, it cannot be attained.\n\n*Governing* (莅) means to preside over.\nWhen the ruler governs under Heaven with the Dao/Way,\nthe world willingly bears him without burden.\nWhen one governs without the Dao/Way,\nthe world resents him and his rule does not endure.\n\nEmperor Yao and Shun flourished through this,\nwhile Jie and Zhou perished by it.\nObserve the good and the evil\nto discern survival and ruin.\n\nKing Ping said: \"Your servant reverently obeys.\"\nKing Ping, a virtuous ruler of Zhou,\ngrieved over the decline of the Dao/Way in his age,\nand thus questioned Wenzi,\nseeking the path to governance.\n\nWenzi replied: \"It depends on one man,\nnot on others.\"\nThus, King Ping refined his governance,\nand the Zhou Dao/Way revived,\nearning praise in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*,\nand later historians honored him as King Ping.\n\n*End of Volume Five of the Treatise on Penetrating the Mysterious and True*\n*Volume Six begins: The Silent Child’s Commentary*\n\nThe **Supreme Virtue/Power**—The **Supreme Virtue/Power** refers to the virtuous rulers of their time. When the Dao/Way of the Three Dynasties declined and the virtue/power of the Five Hegemons waned, it was fitting to cultivate virtue/power to rectify the world. Those with virtue/power are honored, and those with merit are praised, hence the term **Supreme Virtue/Power**.\n\nLaozi said: *\"The ruler is the heart of the state; a tranquil heart brings order to all limbs, while a disturbed heart brings chaos.\"* Governing the state depends on the ruler’s clarity—when he is clear, all the people take joy in their pursuits. Governing oneself depends on a rectified heart—when it is rectified, all limbs find their proper place. Thus, when a man’s self is well-governed, his limbs move without effort; he knows no sickness or pain. When a state is well-governed, its ruler and ministers forget each other; there is no worry or anxiety.\n\nLaozi said: *\"He learned from Master Changzhu [常枞]—Laozi’s teacher, surnamed Chang, named Zhu.\"* Laozi himself recounted receiving instruction from his teacher, whose words were thus: *\"The unlettered one—when he sees the tongue, he guards softness; when he sees the ancient Dao/Way, he upholds the yielding and gentle.\"* The ancient character (古) can also be written as the tongue character (舌), meaning softness. Gazing upward at the house beams, he laments that light does not linger. Retreating by the river, he sighs that the past does not cease flowing. Observing shadows to know how to grasp what comes after, he does not act before its time.\n\nThus, the Sage follows the Way of **emptiness and non-action**, always yielding to what comes later rather than forcing what comes first. It is like kindling a pile of wood—when the fire reaches the top, the lower logs are consumed. What comes later is what comes first; what is below is what is above. This is the natural order of things. If one seeks to act before others, he cannot act before others.\n\nLaozi said: *\"The clapper of a bell, though loud, destroys itself; the candle, though bright, consumes itself. The markings of tigers and leopards invite arrows; the swiftness of monkeys and gibbons invites traps. Thus, the bold perish by their strength; the eloquent are ensnared by their cleverness. Though one knows cleverness, he cannot know when to refrain from it.\"* This is the harm of knowing, the inability to preserve oneself by not knowing. Though one is wise in speech, he can only be given partial truths, not broad responses. Holding to the courage of an ordinary man, he cannot defend against multitudes; clinging to one-sided arguments, he does not speak of universal principles.\n\nLaozi said: *\"The Dao/Way is founded on non-existence; to embody the Dao/Way is to be empty and without form—this is called **subtle and mysterious**.\"* It cannot be seen in form, nor heard in sound; this is called **profound and dark**. **Profound and dark** describes the Dao/Way, yet is not the Dao/Way itself. It is like a net—used to catch fish, yet not the fish itself; or words—used to speak of the Dao/Way, yet not the Dao/Way itself.\n\nThe Dao/Way is to look inward and reflect; to listen within and reflect, thus attaining self-knowledge. Therefore, a man is neither slightly awakened nor deeply confused; neither slightly kind nor greatly foolish. He who clutches a glowworm and compares it to the sun is not confused how? He who holds a piece of jade and compares it to the King of Fu is not foolish how?\n\nDo not take your mirror from flowing water, but from still water, for its stillness preserves within and does not sway without. Dust in the heart scatters outward—it flows and forever dims. Water’s nature is inward emptiness—its stillness reflects itself. The moon wanes when the sun shines; darkness cannot endure against light. Stars vanish when the sun rises—nothing can contend with its radiance. The end cannot be stronger than the root; branches cannot surpass the trunk. When the upper is heavy and the lower is light, its fall is inevitable.\n\nThis means: the Great Ruler has his decree, the lesser men should not presume to act. If they do, it is like darkness seizing light or stars challenging the sun—root and branch must be used in harmony, each in its proper place, to avoid peril and overthrow.\n\nOne pool does not nurture two dragons; one female does not mate with two males. Unity is fixed; duality invites contention. When the ruler is unified, the state is secure. When a man is unified, his heart is at peace. Jade rests in the mountain, and grass and trees grow moist. Pearls arise from the depths, and the shore does not wither. Mountains and rivers hold jade and pearls, thus nourished and graceful. The gentleman accumulates virtue/power, thus radiant and illustrious.\n\nThe earthworm lacks the strength of sinews and bones nor the sharpness of claws and teeth, yet it feeds above on the soil and drinks below from the Yellow Spring—its heart is unified. The earthworm eats when hungry and drinks when thirsty—no conflicting thoughts, no need for sinews, bones, claws, or teeth. When a man unifies his heart in the Dao/Way, why should he rely on fame and profit to find satisfaction?\n\nClarity is brightness—even a cup of water reveals the pupil. Turbidity is harm—a river cannot obscure a great mountain. Though clarity is small, it can discern the finest hairs; though turbidity is vast, it cannot reveal peaks and valleys. Orchids and sweetgrass do not cease their fragrance because they are not worn; a boat floats on the rivers and seas, not sinking because it is not boarded; the gentleman follows the good Dao/Way, not stopping because it is unrecognized—this is their inherent nature.\n\nOrchids and sweetgrass are fragrant by nature; they cannot help but be fragrant. The gentleman follows the good Dao/Way—he cannot but act. To bring clarity into turbidity is to invite suffering; to bring turbidity into clarity is to invite ruin. The virtuous and foolish cannot stand together; purity and filth do not mix in the same vessel. Heaven’s two *qi* forms the rainbow; Earth’s two *qi* causes leakage and concealment; man’s two *qi* brings illness. The three transformations of Heaven, Earth, and Man value life above all.\n\nDarkness and light cannot remain constant—winter follows summer, and summer follows winter. The moon does not know day; the sun does not know\n\nThe gentleman who is attuned to the Dao/Way is like a cart axle turning within its hub, not moving by itself, yet reaching a thousand *li*—its motion endless, returning yet beginning anew. This has already been explained.\n\nThus, when raising the crooked and the straight, one may not always succeed; when raising the straight and the crooked, do not force it to proceed.\nThis is to elucidate the *Fu* and *Yan* sections.\n\nWhen a bird is about to come, setting nets and waiting for it—he who catches the bird gains one eye of the net. If one makes a net of a single eye, he will never catch a bird.\nRelying on one man’s talent alone is hard to govern the multitude.\nA net of a single eye cannot trap a bird.\nThus, some matters cannot be preordained, some things cannot be foreseen—\ntherefore the Sage stores the Dao/Way and awaits the proper time.\n\nThe Sage’s conduct is Heavenly, his actions follow the times;\nbefore the time arrives, he guards the Dao/Way—when the time comes, he acts accordingly.\nThe Duke of Zhou’s establishment of the Zhou Dao, and the Emperor Gaozu’s flourishing of the Han dynasty.\n\nTo gain fish, one must first open the valleys;\nto attract birds, one must first plant the trees.\nWater gathers, and fish assemble;\ntrees flourish, and birds congregate.\nHe who gains fish does not drag them into the depths—\nhe who gains monkeys does not carry them up the trees.\nHe merely lets them go where it is advantageous.\n\nThe relationship between ruler and subject is like fish returning to water,\nbirds relying on forests—\nletting them act as they will, they come without being summoned.\nA wise ruler governs, and loyal and virtuous ministers naturally arrive.\n\nThe foot treads shallow ground, yet waits for what it cannot tread before it can move;\nthe mind knows little, yet waits for what it does not know before it can be enlightened.\nThe foot’s familiar ground is little, its unfamiliar ground is much.\nThe mind’s known things are few, its unknown things are many.\nThus, though he does not act, his actions are fulfilled;\nthough he does not know, his knowledge is complete.\n\nWhen streams run dry, the valleys become empty;\nwhen hills are leveled, the depths are sealed.\nWhen lips are lost, teeth grow cold;\nwhen the Yellow River is deep, its nourishment lies in the mountains.\nThis illustrates how the ruler and people rely on each other,\njust as mountains and rivers are interconnected.\nA deep Yellow River brings fertility to the mountains,\na ruler’s heavy taxation drains the people’s wealth.\nWhen the ruler demands more, the people are exhausted;\nwhen the people’s strength is spent, the ruler’s position is perilous—\nthis is the meaning of \"lips lost, teeth grow cold.\"\n\nWater still yields clarity;\nclarity brings evenness;\nevenness brings ease;\nease reveals the form of things.\nForms cannot coexist—\nthus clarity can be used as a standard.\nWhen the sovereign’s wisdom is established,\nit is like the stillness of water.\nDeeply discerning the nature of things,\nno state of good or evil escapes him;\nprofoundly observing human nature,\nhis policies of peace and harmony spread naturally.\n\nWhen leaves fall, it is the wind that shakes them;\nwhen water becomes turbid, it is objects that stir it.\nThe wind does not shake yet leaves fall,\nobjects always stir yet water remains clear—this has never been seen.\nThe *Bi* and *Zhuó* vessels are refined by the *Chuàn* and *Zhuàn* processes;\nthe *Léng* and *Zhuó* blades are honed by *dǐlì* and *lìlì*.\nThough jade and fine swords possess beautiful qualities,\nthey must rely on the *dǐlì* and *lìlì* processes\nto become extraordinary tools.\nThe gentleman and the virtuous man,\nthough possessing talent and innate qualities,\nmust rely on teachers and mentors\nto perfect their undertakings.\n\nThe *Fènghuáng* soars at heights of a thousand *rèn*—\nnone can summon

and men achieve without labor;\nexploit what is familiar, and things come without being called.\n\nDitches and ponds overflow in floods,\ndry up in droughts—\nbut the sources of the Yellow River and the seas,\ndeep and inexhaustible, do not fail.\nStore them, and they do not brim;\nlet them flow, and they do not run dry—\nnever have I heard of woes from overflow or drought,\nfor their depths are ever thus.\n\nThe tortoise has no ears, yet its eyes cannot be covered—\nit is keen in sight.\nThe blind man has no eyes, yet his ears cannot be covered—\nhe is keen in hearing.\n\nThe *Fènghuáng* returns to its native land,\nthe hare flees back to its burrow,\nthe fox dies with its head toward its hill,\nthe cicada finds refuge in the trees—\neach returns to its origin.\n\nThings do not forget their roots,\nbut men sometimes stray from the Dao/Way.\nWater and fire repel each other,\nyet the *Dǐng* and *Lì* vessels exist between them,\nand the five flavors are harmonized.\nBone and flesh love each other,\nyet slanderers come between them,\nand father and son grow suspicious.\nThis shows how things have opposing natures—\nthough water and fire attack each other,\nwhen used properly, they yield harmony.\nThough bone and flesh love each other,\nslander and deceit come between them,\nand doubt arises.\nThe virtuous must be vigilant.\n\nDogs and pigs eat without discrimination,\ngrowing fat in body,\nyet they are near death.\nThis illustrates how the petty man seeks fame and profit in haste—\nthough he may prosper temporarily, he will ultimately fail.\nThe virtuous man stores the Dao/Way and awaits the proper time—\nthough he may suffer temporarily, he will ultimately thrive.\n\nThe *Fènghuáng* soars at heights of a thousand *rèn*—\nnone can summon it;\nthe *Zhuī* is fixed within a hundred layers—\nyet it cannot rise by itself.\nAscend the heights, and they become mountains;\ndescend the depths, and they become abysses.\nAct upon what is easy,

cannot make it resound—\nthe master’s prestige is lost.\n\nThe *chāng* (倡) is the one who plays the *yǒu* (竽),\nthe craftsman is the one who adjusts the *quǎn* (窍).\nThough the notes may fit the scale,\ntheir actions ultimately conflict with purpose—\nthe heart does not respond,\nso how can they achieve harmony?\nThis illustrates how the master’s authority is forgotten.\n\nThe deaf cannot sing to find their own joy,\nthe blind cannot gaze to engage with the world.\nSound does not reach their ears,\nso they abandon all thought of music,\nand sight does not reach their eyes,\nso they cease all contemplation of beauty.\n\nWalking through forests, one cannot follow straight paths,\ntraversing perilous terrain, one cannot measure with a plumb line.\nTo walk through forests, one seeks only to pass through,\nto traverse dangers, one seeks only to rescue the lost.\n\nThe sea’s greatness lies in its abundance—\nit is vast because it does not cease to give birth,\nand boundless because its use never ends.\n\nThe sun does not rise twice in one day,\nthe fox does not have two masters,\nthe divine dragon does not pair,\nthe fierce beasts do not gather in groups,\nand startled birds do not fly in twos.\n\nThese all stand alone, unpaired—\nthus they become the leaders of all beasts and birds.\nIt is not the whisk that obscures the sun,\nnor the spokes that follow swiftness—\none must rely on the proper tools.\n\nTo draw a bow and shoot,\none cannot release the arrow without the string,\nand only one in ten shots strikes true.\nThough the bow may be strong,\nwithout the string, it cannot hit the mark.\nThough a ruler may be sage,\nwithout ministers, his deeds cannot be completed.\n\nAmong those who seek office,\nmany are unworthy—\nyet among those who seek virtue,\nonly one in ten thousand is found.\n\nA hungry horse in the stable\nremains silent and still,\nbut when fed grain beside it,\nit immediately becomes restless.\n\nWhen one lacks fodder in the stable,\nit is given and they will contend.\nWhen one craves fame and position,\nbut dwells in them, they will strive—\nthus the noble man yields his fortune,\nwhile the petty man competes for rank.\n\nA three-*cùn* (寸) tube, though open,\ncannot fill the world,\nyet a ten-*dàn* (石) vessel has its limits,\nand a hundred *dòu* (斗) measure is sufficient.\n\nThis illustrates how the greedy never have enough,\nthough their vessels are bottomless.\n\nTo follow the plumb line and cut—\nit will not go astray,\nto suspend the balance and weigh—\nit will not err.\nTo apply ancient principles by analogy,\nthere are times when they succeed,\nand to wield the *gè* (格) rod,\nthere are times when it is appropriate.\nTo act thus is called *duàn* (断, \"decision\"),\nto act otherwise is called *luàn* (乱, \"chaos\").\n\nFollowing the plumb line in action,\nthings cannot exceed its measure,\nsuspending the balance in governance,\nno matter goes unaddressed.\n\nSince ancient and modern times differ,\nlaws and measures must also vary—\nadapting to the times brings order,\nclinging to the past brings ruin.\n\nThe farmer toils while the nobleman is nourished,\nthe foolish speak while the wise deliberate.\n\nWhen matters are clear,\ntreat them like jade or stone—\nno doubt remains.\nWhen understanding is murky,\nleave room for counsel.\n\nA hundred stars’ brightness\ndoes not match the moon’s single light,\nten windows fully opened\ndo not match the clarity of one.\nThough petty men may be many,\nthey are insufficient to rely upon,\nthough virtuous men may be few,\none is more than enough.\n\nKing Wen secured Lü Wang (吕望),\nEmperor Gaozu secured Zi Fang (子房)—\nwere they few in number?\n\nThe *fùshé* (蝮蛇) cannot be a foot,\nnor the tiger’s a wing.\nNo man is fully capable,\nno thing possesses dual perfection.»\n\nThe six-foot mat—\nwhen lying upon it, even the lowly may cross it with ease,\nbut standing to step over it, even the gifted find it difficult.\nDifferent circumstances demand different efforts.\n\nMen’s talents vary—\nwhat suits one may fail another,\nfor their abilities differ.\n\nThe assistant at sacrifice gains a taste,\nthe one who breaks up a fight takes a wound.\nSeeing goodness brings blessing,\nencountering evil brings harm—\nhow much more so when one acts personally?\n\nSheltering beneath an ill-omened tree,\none is struck by thunder.\nHiding beneath an ill-omened tree,\nyet the heavenly wrath cannot be evaded;\nconcealing a wicked man,\nyet the state’s law will surely punish.\n\nThe sun and moon wish to shine,\nbut floating clouds obscure them;\nthe river longs to be clear,\nbut sand and silt defile it;\nclusters of orchids strive to flourish,\nbut autumn winds wither them;\nhuman nature seeks balance,\nyet desires corrupt it.\nCovered in dust yet hoping for purity—\nit cannot be achieved.\n\nDwelling in murky darkness,\nhow can one perceive brightness?\nResiding in the field of desires,\none must follow their stain.\n\nFrost and hail descend together,\nand orchids cannot preserve their fragrance;\nsandy soil flows with mud,\nand the river’s source cannot retain its purity.\n\nYellow gold and tortoiseshell,\nthe virtuous wear as ornaments;\ncommon earth and clay,\nthe capable use for wealth.\nIf one does not know their proper use,\neven gold and jade become worthless as dung.\nIf one knows how to apply them,\neven earth and clay become priceless as pearls.\n\nThus, giving gold and jade to the weak\nis not as good as giving them writing paper.\n*Weak* refers to the foolish and feeble.\nGiving them paper may still be preserved,\nbut giving them gold and jade will bring harm—\njust as placing a petty man in high office\nwill surely bring danger and ruin.\n\nA hub holds thirty spokes,\neach pulling straight toward its own slot,\nyet none can enter another’s place—\njust as ministers each hold their own duties.\nThe meaning does not differ from the earlier explanation.\n\nThe skilled user of men\nis like the *xiān*’s foot—\nmany yet causing no harm,\nlike the tongue and teeth,\nfirm and soft grinding together without destruction.\n*The xiān* is the centipede.\nThose who skillfully employ many\nare like the centipede, are they not?\nThe tongue and teeth,\nhard and soft working together,\ngather both the wise and foolish.\nLet each follow its proper place,\nand their talents will not be wasted.\n\nStone is born firm,\norchids are born fragrant—\nif possessed in youth, their virtue grows clearer with age.\nThis is their inherent nature:\nstone is firm, orchids are fragrant,\nbecause the virtuous become ever clearer,\nwhile the foolish grow ever dimmer.\nThus, firmness and fragrance cannot be taken away,\nnor can foolishness and darkness be moved—\nthose who possess them in youth\nsee them only deepen with time.\n\nSupporting and lifting,\ndeclining and yielding,\ngaining and losing,\nagreeing and refusing—\nthese differ as heaven and earth.\nHow can they be the same?\n\nTwice-born plants bear no fruit,\nthose that bloom too early fall before frost.\nDouble-honored yet barren,\nthe sun at its peak scorches its own standard,\ndusting its brow—\nthe standard is the nose.\nA nose stained with dust while its forehead is powdered—\nlike treating a hand’s ailment while neglecting the foot.\nThis is most unnatural.\n\nA rotting rat in the ancestral hall,\nits stench burning the hall’s beams—\nplunging into water only to grow more drenched,\nclutching foulness while seeking fragrance—\neven the skilled cannot remedy it.\n*The rotting rat* is like the deceitful and flattering.\nThe ruler who favors such men while seeking good governance\nis like one drowning in water or burning the hall—\nthe calamity will not be small.\n\nWinter ice can be broken,\nsummer wood can be knotted—\nopportune moments are hard to find yet easy to lose.\nTime is precious, fate fleeting—\nwarn the virtuous to act when the moment comes,\nlest they lose it.\n\nWood in full growth may be cut all day and regrow,\nbut when autumn frost descends,\nit withers in a single night.\nThose who build merit and achieve great deeds\nmust not delay.\n\nA bowstring drawn tight while arrows gather,\ntrees lush while axes enter—\nnot summoned, yet they come.\nThe bowstring does not seek to strike yet the arrows gather,\nthe forest does not call for felling yet the axes arrive—\nthis is the work of natural forces.\n\nA suckling pup bites a tiger,\na crouching chicken strikes a weasel—\nfavor bestowed does not measure their strength.\nYet those who nurture such favor\nwill forget their own lives.\n\nThose who wait for profit to rescue the drowning\nwill surely drown them with their own greed.\n\nA boat can float or sink—\nthe foolish do not know where to place their trust.\n\nThe vessel rides upon the water and may also sink it.\nMan thrives by advantage yet may also be drowned by it.\nOnly by discerning the measure of sufficiency\nmay one avoid the calamity of sinking.\n\nA fine steed urged forward does not advance,\npulled back does not halt—\na ruler does not seek the Dao of distance.\n\nThe people are exhausted to their limits,\nyet the sovereign’s greed knows no end;\na weary steed is driven further—\nhow can one chart a distant path?\n\nWater, though level, must have ripples,\na balance, though true, must have deviation,\na ruler’s measure, though uniform, must have flaws.\n\nWithout the compass and square, one cannot define the square and round;\nwithout the plumb and level, one cannot rectify the crooked and straight.\nYet those who wield the compass and square\nalso bear the mind of the compass and square.\n\nWhen the sovereign establishes just and upright laws,\nyet the people give rise to perverse and rebellious factions,\nit is as though ripples arise from level water,\nor a crooked mind stems from the upright balance—\nthe seeds of favor and aversion take root,\nand the signs of chaos unfold.\nIt is not that the sovereign lacks laws and regulations,\nbut that the subjects have lost their compass and square.\n\nThe grandeur of Tai Mountain, though doubled, is unseen,\nyet the tip of an autumn hair, though minute, may be discerned.\nWhen one’s gaze is fixed upon the autumn hair,\nthough small, it may be perceived—\nbut when one’s path turns away from Tai Mountain,\nthough vast, it remains unseen.\n\nThe bamboo and wood, when struck by fire, do not ignite unless pierced or scorched;\nThe earth holds water within, yet without digging, it does not emerge.\nWood is concealed within fire, earth within water—\nWithout piercing or digging, they cannot be revealed.\n\nThe Dao resides within humanity—\nWithout study, it remains unknown.\nAn arrow’s swiftness does not exceed two *li*,\nYet with each halting step, the tortoise reaches a thousand *li*.\nAccumulated grains, though small, form hills and mountains.\n\nFor those who seek the Way,\nIt is not the speed of their initial resolve that matters,\nNor the beauty of their prolonged devotion—\nBut that through perseverance, they reach a thousand *li*,\nAnd through steadfastness, they build mountains.\n\nTo stand by the river and desire fish\nIs not as wise as returning to weave nets.\nThe river’s fish are caught by nets,\nAnd humanity’s Dao is grasped by the heart.\n\nA bow must first be tuned before seeking strength,\nA horse must first be guided before seeking excellence,\nA person must first be trusted before seeking ability.\nTo grasp these three principles\nIs to discern the essentials of all affairs.\n\nA skilled smith cannot melt wood,\nA master craftsman cannot carve ice—\nSome things are beyond their capacity.\nHow then can the virtuous not reflect upon this?\n\nWhat cannot be shaped cannot become an instrument,\nThough the craftsman be skilled, his art finds no use.\nWhat cannot be taught cannot be turned,\nThough the sage speak, their intent remains unheeded.\n\nTo command people not to cross the river is possible,\nBut to command the river to have no waves is impossible.\nSpeak of the river’s waves, and speak of the world’s calamities—\nTo prevent people from inviting disaster is easy,\nBut to command the river to have no waves is difficult.\nSay not that one is blameless—\nThe pot will not fall into the well.\n*Gu* means guilt.\nIt speaks not of innocence,\nBut of the fate one invites.\nThe pot will not fall into the well—\nHow then can one avoid consequence?\n\nThose who strike me in my path wish me to yield,\nThose who snatch my goods wish me to trade.\nDesire stirs within, and its form appears without.\nA single chess move does not reveal one’s skill,\nA single plucked string does not express one’s sorrow.\nA single provocation, though met, does not exhaust justice.\nA single string, though drawn, is not yet called mastery.\n\nNow, take a burning ember—\nTo grasp it risks scorching one’s fingers,\nYet a thousand *dan* of charcoal may be warmed at a distance.\nSame *qi*, yet differing accumulation—\nThere is splendor, and there is decay.\nSplendor and decay alternate,\nProsperity and adversity oppose.\nAbove, there is fine silk,\nBelow, there must be coarse hemp.\nExcessive indulgence cuts deep.\nWhen the sovereign is extravagant, adorning himself in fine silks,\nThe common folk freeze and starve, lacking sustenance.\nHow can the ruler not take heed?\n\nGreat trees have deep roots,\nHigh mountains have firm foundations.\nThe sovereign takes the people as his root,\nAnd humility as his foundation.\n\nLaozi said:\n*The drum does not store sound, yet it produces sound;\nThe mirror does not contain form, yet it reveals form.*\nThe drum does not store sound, the mirror does not contain form—\nYet they produce sound and reveal form.\n\nMetal and stone have sound, yet without striking, they do not ring;\nFlutes and pipes have music, yet without blowing, they are silent.\nMetal, stone, flutes, and pipes cannot sound of their own accord—\nAll require striking or blowing to produce sound.\nThus, all beings inherit virtue and power,\nYet without cultivation, they remain incomplete.\n\nTherefore, the sage conceals within,\nDoes not lead others by example,\nActs only when circumstances demand,\nResponds only when things present themselves.\nThe sage’s words are not spoken lightly,\nHis actions are not taken in vain.\n\nHeaven’s motion never ceases,\nEnding only to begin anew—\nThus it endures.\nA wheel turns where it ought,\nThus it reaches distant places.\nHeaven’s motion is divine and unfathomable,\nFlowing endlessly without measure.\nHeaven’s motion never errs,\nThus it knows no failure.\n\nHeaven’s *qi* descends, earth’s *qi* ascends,\nYin and yang intermingle, harmonizing all things.\nHeaven’s motion, unerring, the sovereign’s governance, unflawed—\nThus, when Heaven and Earth’s exchange is unobstructed,\nAll creatures flourish,\nRuler and subject are content,\nAnd all levels of society thrive.\n\nThe virtuous thrive in their endeavors,\nThe petty perish—\nThis is the Way of Heaven and Earth.\nTo remove the wicked and employ the worthy\nIs to align with Heaven and Earth’s Way.\n\nWhen Heaven’s *qi* does not descend, earth’s *qi* does not ascend,\nYin and yang do not communicate,\nAll things do not prosper,\nThe petty gain influence, the virtuous decline,\nThe five grains do not grow,\nVirtue and power are concealed within.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth’s *qi* do not exchange,\nYin and yang’s *qi* does not flow—\nIt is because the sovereign’s virtue and power are unused,\nThe deceitful and flatterers prevail,\nThe petty hold office, the virtuous are exiled,\nCausing all things to wither and the five grains to fail.\n\nThe Way of Heaven: it gathers the abundant to benefit the scarce,\nThe Way of Earth: it reduces the high to elevate the low—\nThis is the Way of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Way of spirits: the proud and overflowing are humbled,\nThe arrogant and overflowing meet the humble.\nHumanity’s Way: the abundant do not hoard,\nThe wealthy do not increase their wealth.\n\nThe sage’s Way: though lowly, none can surpass him.\nHe never seeks to be above others,\nThus he is honored by all.\n\nWhen Heaven’s light shines bright, it illuminates the four quarters,\nWhen the sovereign is enlightened, his ministers are enlightened,\nAnd the realm is at peace.\nThe realm has four enlightened ones,\nAnd thus it endures.\nTo enlighten those who enlighten others—\nThis is to enlighten their transformations.\nWhen the four enlightened ones are complete,\nAll the people are transformed.\n\nHeaven’s Way is manifest in the *wen*—the sun, moon, and stars.\nEarth’s Way is manifest in the *li*—mountains, marshes, rivers, and seas.\nOne harmonizes them, blending with the undifferentiated *qi*.\nTime governs them, responding without disorder,\nGiving rise to all things—\nThis is called the Dao.\n\nIt nourishes and sustains all things,\nYet does not rule as their master—\nThus it is called the Dao.\n\nThe Great Dao is vast and near,\nNot distant from the self.\nCultivate it within oneself,\nAnd its virtue becomes true.\nCultivate it in all things,\nAnd its virtue is unbroken.\nTo cultivate its truth within is called *zhen*,\nTo nurture its virtue externally is called *de*.\n\nHeaven covers all things,\nBestowing its virtue and nourishing them,\nGiving without taking—\nThus all spirits return to it.\nTo give without taking is the highest virtue,\nThus it is called *de*.\n\nNone is higher than Heaven,\nNone is lower than the marshes.\nHeaven is high, the marshes are low—\nThe sage follows this model,\nEstablishing distinctions of honor and humility,\nAnd thus the realm is settled.\n\nThe low and the high are arranged in order,\nThe noble and the base are positioned accordingly.\n\nThe Earth bears all things and nurtures them,\nGiving and taking in return—\nThus the flesh and bones return to it.\nGiving and taking is the lower virtue,\nYet the lower virtue does not lose its virtue—\nThus it is called *virtue*.\n\nNot taking is called the Dao of Heaven:\nHeaven generates all things,\nYet only nourishes and sustains them,\nNot claiming their substance—\nThus the spirits return to the upper realm.\nThe one who does not take is the highest virtue,\nThus it is called *virtue*.\n\nThe one who takes is called the Dao of the Earth:\nThough it completes the forms of all things,\nIt returns them to their original nature—\nThus the flesh and bones descend to the lower realm,\nAnd this is called *without virtue*.\n\nThe Earth receives from Heaven,\nThus it is settled and tranquil;\nThe Earth is settled and tranquil,\nThus all things take form;\nThe Earth is vast and thick,\nThus all things gather.\nSettled and tranquil, it bears nothing it does not,\nVast and thick, it contains nothing it does not.\nThe Earth’s power is deep and enduring,\nAnd the waters’ sources converge within it;\nThe Earth’s Dao is broad and long-lasting,\nThus it can endure and flourish eternally.\nThe sage follows this model,\nAnd virtue knows no limit in its embrace.\n\nIt is said: Heaven and Earth support one another,\nTo achieve boundless breadth and thickness.\nThe ruler and minister trust one another,\nThus they can govern in harmony.\n\nWhen *yin* overcomes *yang*,\nAll things thrive;\nWhen *yang* overcomes *yin*,\nAll things stagnate.\nWhen all things thrive, none lacks sustenance;\nWhen all things stagnate, none lacks joy.\nWhen all things are joyful, none remains ungoverned.\n\nWhen *yin* harms things, *yang* bends itself,\nWhen *yin* advances, *yang* retreats—\nThen the petty man gains influence,\nAnd the virtuous withdraw from harm.\nThe Way is thus clear:\nIf *yang* is restrained by *yin*,\nThen the realm is harmonious and governed;\nIf the minister overcomes the ruler,\nThen the petty man holds power.\n\nWhen *yang qi* moves, all things relax and find their place—\nThus the sage follows the Dao of *yang*.\n\nTo follow things, they will follow in return;\nTo oppose things, they will oppose in return—\nThus one does not lose the nature and disposition of things.\n\nThe *yin* sound is like the *wu* bird.\nWhen the marshes are full, all things flourish in due season;\nWhen the marshes are dry, all things wither.\nThus if the rains do not come,\nThe land becomes barren and abandoned.\nWhen *yang* ascends and then descends again,\nIt becomes the master of all things.\nIt does not overindulge in growth,\nThus it can end and begin anew;\nEnding and beginning anew,\nThus it can endure forever.\nTo endure forever,\nThus it is the mother of all things.\n\nThe sage follows the Dao of Heaven,\nActing without effort to endure eternally;\nTo oppose the nature of things,\nEven one in high position cannot hold it.\n\nThe *yang qi* must accumulate before it can be applied,\nThe *yin qi* must gather before it can transform—\nNone can apply or transform without first accumulating.\nThus the sage is cautious in what he gathers.\n\nGather *virtue* and blessings follow,\nGather evil and ruin comes.\nWhen *yang* extinguishes *yin*,\nAll things grow fat;\nWhen *yin* extinguishes *yang*,\nAll things decay.\nThus, if kings and nobles uphold the Dao of *yang*,\nAll things thrive;\nIf they uphold the Dao of *yin*,\nThe realm perishes.\n\nThe *yang* is upright, life-giving—\nThus all things grow fat.\nFatness brings thriving;\nThe *yin* is perverse, death-dealing—\nThus all things decay.\nDecay leads to ruin.\n\nIf *yang* does not descend to *yin*,\nThen all things cannot form;\nIf the ruler does not descend to the minister,\nThen the virtue of transformation does not flow—\nThus the ruler descends to the minister and becomes wise,\nOr does not descend and becomes dull and deaf.\n\nThe ruler is not the utmost sage,\nYet cannot descend to the minister;\nThe minister is not the utmost worthy,\nYet cannot assist the ruler.\nYu Shun bowed to Bo Cheng,\nKing Wen deferred to Shangfu—\nThis is called wisdom.\n\nThe sun rises from the Earth,\nAnd all things multiply and grow;\nKings and nobles dwell above the people,\nTo manifest *virtue* and the Way.\nThe sun sets into the Earth,\nAnd all things rest and recover;\nThe petty man dwells among the people,\nAnd above them flee in hiding.\n\nIt is said:\nIf *yang* does not descend to *yin*,\nThen all things cannot thrive;\nIf the ruler does not descend to the minister,\nThen all things are concealed.\n\nWhen thunder moves, all things awaken,\nWhen dew moistens, all things are refreshed—\nThe great man’s actions are like this.\n\nThe movements of *yin* and *yang* have constant rhythms,\nYet the great man’s actions do not exhaust things.\nWhen the great man is at his peak,\nIt is like spring’s thunder.\nWhen he issues his commands,\nIt is like the gentle wind.\nBoth are harmonious and follow the Way,\nThus they do not exhaust things.\n\nThunder stirs the Earth,\nAnd all things relax;\nWind sways the trees,\nAnd grasses and woods flourish.\nThe great man abandons evil and pursues goodness,\nAnd the people do not stray far—\nThus the people have paths of departure and return.\nThe more they depart, the more they regret;\nThe less they return, the more they are at ease.\n\nMoreover, when the great man has goodness,\nThe people flock to him.\nLike the Great King’s departure from Bi,\nHow distant was it?\n\nFire moves only with fuel,\nThe great man’s words must have truth.\nWith truth and sincerity,\nWhere can he not succeed?\nFire spreads as fuel is passed on;\nWords take effect as truth is upheld.\nThus, when the great man speaks,\nHis actions follow without delay,\nAnd his truth is like the four seasons.\n\nThe Yellow River is deep,\nIts banks lie against the mountains;\nThe hills and mounds are high,\nTheir depths sink into the abyss.\nWhen *yang qi* is strong, it transforms into *yin*;\nWhen *yin qi* is strong, it transforms into *yang*—\nThus desire cannot be fully satisfied,\nAnd joy cannot be pushed to its extreme.\nThe Dao of Heaven is sublime and elevated,\nYet only moderates desire to maintain harmony,\nTo follow Heaven’s principles,\nAnd not let things reach their limits.\n\nAnger without harsh words,\nRage without changing countenance—\nThis is called *calculating* (obtaining) virtue.\nThough anger and rage remain,\nYet harsh words and perverse expressions are not uttered.\nIf they do not manifest externally,\nThen virtue is obtained within—\nThis is called *calculating* virtue through the Way.\n\nThe *yang* spreads harmoniously throughout the realm,\nThe *yin* sinks and drowns the realm in chaos.\nTo lean toward *yang* is to align with loyal and virtuous,\nThus harmony prevails.\nTo lean toward *yin* is to align with flatterers and deceivers,\nThus chaos descends.\n\nLaozi said:\nAccumulating thinness forms thickness,\nAccumulating lowliness forms height.\nThe noble man strives daily to achieve brilliance,\nThe petty man strives daily to reach disgrace.\nThe noble man diligently cultivates himself to follow the Dao,\nAnd his radiance increases daily.\nThe petty man rides on the threshold to indulge his desires,\nAnd ultimately meets ruin and shame.\n\nThough these changes may not be seen,\nYet to see goodness as if it were not attainable,\nAnd to regard past evil as if it were not ominous—\nIf one turns toward goodness,\nEven past mistakes bring no blame;\nIf one does not turn toward goodness,\nEven loyalty cannot avert coming misfortune.\nThus blaming others is not as grave as blaming oneself,\nAnd striving to win others is not as effective as striving within oneself.\n\nSound is self-summoned,\nKindred spirits seek one another,\nReputation is self-bestowed,\nAnd people are self-appointed—\nNone of these are beyond oneself.\n\nWith a sharp blade to pierce, with an edge to strike—\nWhat cause for blame against others?\n\nThus the noble man guards against the subtle.\nTo guard the subtle means words need not be grand.\nIf one turns toward goodness,\nThen virtue comes not from others—\nStrive within oneself.\n\nIf one does not turn toward goodness,\nThen calamity returns to oneself—\nWhat cause for blame against others?\nTo do evil is like wielding a blade to cut oneself,\nOr piling fire upon fire to douse it—\nWho then would censure you?\n\nAll things embrace yin while cradling yang,\nTheir clashing qi harmonized.\nThis harmony dwells at the center—\nThus grains bear fruit in their husks,\nGrasses bear fruit in their pods,\nEggs and wombs gestate within the center,\nAnd those without eggs or wombs\nTake time to manifest.\nThough forms and kinds differ,\nIn their generation,\nAll arise from central harmony to form their essence,\nAnd thus require time to complete.\n\nYet what they become through transformation\nIs what must unfold in due course.\n\nWhen the earth is level, water does not flow;\nWhen light and heavy are balanced, the scale does not tilt.\nThe earth level, and water has no rushing force;\nThe scale balanced, and things have no weighty tilt.\n\nThe generation and transformation of things\nCome from response—\nNot without cause.\nAll things in their birth\nHave their own triggers—\nNot in vain.\n\nLaozi said:\nWhen mountains reach their height,\nThen clouds and rain arise there.\nWhen waters reach their depth,\nThen dragons and serpents take form.\nWhen the noble man fulfills the Dao,\nThen virtue and blessings flow from him.\n\nThose who harbor hidden virtue\nShall receive manifest reward,\nThose who act in secret\nShall gain renowned name.\nThe mountains’ spirits, when most potent,\nDescend as clouds and rain.\nThe Dao’s heights, when most sublime,\nBestow virtue and blessings.\n\nNever does reward come before the deed.\nHe who plants millet does not reap barley,\nHe who sows resentment gains no gratitude.\nPlant millet and reap barley—\nReturn resentment for virtue.\n\n*End of Volume Six of the Treatise on the Mysterious and True*\n#1 *Bì*: The *Qú* text reads *\"deep.\"*\n#2 *Niǎn*: The

Treatise on the Mysterious and True*\n*Commentary by Mò Xīzǐ*\n\nThe subtle luminosity—\nDao encompasses what lies beyond form, hence *subtle*;\nvirtue conceals itself within the unseen, hence *luminous*.\n\nThus, without subtlety, one cannot fathom its origin;\nwithout luminosity, one cannot grasp its essence.\nThe meaning of *subtle luminosity* lies in its embodiment and function.\n\nLaozi says:\n*The Dao may be weak or strong,\nsoft or hard,\nyin or yang,\nobscure or luminous,\nenveloping heaven and earth,\nresponding without fixed form.*\nThis aligns with the intent of *\"The Origin of the Dao.\"*\n\nShallow knowledge knows not the depths,\nouter knowledge knows not the inner,\ncoarse knowledge knows not the refined,\nknown knowledge is but unknown,\nunknown knowledge is true knowing—\nwho then knows knowing as unknown,\nunknown as knowing?\n\nThe Dao cannot be heard—heard, it is not;\nthe Dao cannot be seen—seen, it is not;\nthe Dao cannot be spoken—spoken, it is not.\nWho then knows the formless form?\n\nThus, all under heaven know goodness as goodness—\nand so it ceases to be good.\nThe wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise.\n\nThe Dao transcends form and sound—\nhow then can hearing and seeing discern it?\nVirtue requires no adornment—\nhow can good and evil define it?\nThus, the wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise—\nthis is the utmost truth.\n\n**Wénzǐ asked:** Can one speak in subtlety?\n**Laozi replied:** Why not?\nDo you mean *speaking of knowing*?\nHe who speaks of knowing does not speak through words.\n*Subtle speech* is speech of the utmost refinement.\nOnly when one forgets the words can one truly speak.\n\nChasing fish, one’s hands grow wet;\nhunting beasts, one’s feet grow swift—\nnot for joy’s sake.\nThus, the utmost speech transcends speech,\nthe utmost action transcends action.\nThe shallow-minded contend over trifles.\n\nSpeech has its root; affairs have their master.\nTo act without knowing is why one is not known.\n\nThe Dao is the nameless mystery;\nspeech is the root of ultimate truth.\nThose who grasp the mystery speak not;\nthose who clarify the root contend not.\nThus, speech reaches its peak in silence,\naction in inaction—\nand knowing knows itself.\nWho then departs from my knowing?\n\n**Wénzǐ asked:** Does governing a state also have its method?\n**Laozi replied:** Observe the wagon-driver:\nHe calls forward *\"Yā!\"* and *\"Xī!\"*—\nthe fire must be stoked.\nThe rear echoes in response—\nthis is the driver’s song to spur the horses.\nThough the music of Zhèng, Wèi, Hú, or Chǔ\ncannot match its purpose.\n\nGoverning a state relies on ritual propriety,\nnot on eloquence.\nThe more laws proliferate, the more thieves arise.\nWhat is used must suit its purpose;\neach must meet its necessity—\nlike the wagon-driver’s song,\nyet not performed with the music of *Xiánqí*.\n\nGoverning a state and nourishing the people\nprioritizes simplicity—\nwhy adorn with ornate colors?\n\nLaozi says:\n*The Dao has no fixed form yet can be the standard;\nlike mountains and forests yielding timber,\nbut timber does not equal mountains and forests,\nmountains and forests do not equal clouds and rain,\nclouds and rain do not equal yin and yang,\nyin and yang do not equal harmony,\nharmony does not equal the Dao.*\nThe Dao is the form without form,\nthe image without substance—\nits intent cannot be exhausted.\nYet between heaven and earth,\nit can be shaped and transformed without end.\n\nThe great Dao has no fixed origin;\njust as timber arises from mountains and forests,\nthough mountains and forests are not timber.\nFrom clouds and rain onward,\nwhat is spoken falls short of the Dao—\nfor it lacks form and image,\nyet embraces all things,\nencompassing all directions.\nOnly those who embody the Dao know its boundless transformation.\n\nLaozi says:\n*The sage establishes teachings and governs,\never mindful of beginning and end,\nobserving the creation of virtue.*\n*Creation of virtue* means establishing laws.\nThus, when the people know writing, virtue declines;\nwhen they know calculations, benevolence declines;\nwhen they know contracts, trust declines;\nwhen they know machinery, substance declines.\nThese four arise only when the Dao is lost.\nAs times change, laws must adapt—\nthe stricter the laws, the more they are transgressed.\nThus, as trust declines and machinery is devised,\ngovernance and teaching flourish—\nyet deceit and corruption worsen.\n\nThe *sè* does not sound, yet its twenty-five strings each respond in harmony;\nthe axle does not turn itself, yet its thirty spokes each contribute their strength.\nStrings must differ in tension to compose melody;\nwheels must vary in labor to travel far.\nWhat appears to make sound is silent;\nwhat appears to turn is still.\nThe *sè* has no sound—sound lies in the strings.\nThe axle does not turn—turning lies in the wheels.\nThus, silence yields sound, stillness yields motion—\nsilence’s sound completes the melody,\nstillness’s turning achieves distance.\n\nSuperior and inferior follow different paths—\nease in governance leads to disorder.\nHigh position with great virtue follows;\ngreat affairs with petty virtue bring ruin.\nA cap cannot be trodden upon the feet;\na subject cannot be honored above the sovereign.\nWhen superior and inferior are disordered—\nruin is imminent.\n\nMinor virtue harms righteousness,\nminor goodness harms the Dao,\nminor eloquence harms governance,\nharshness injures virtue.\nClinging to petty kindness obscures the great Dao;\nindulging petty anger harms supreme virtue.\n\nThe greatest rectitude is unassailable,\nthus the people are easily guided.\nThe utmost governance is effortless,\nthus the lower ranks do not rebel.\nThe utmost loyalty returns to simplicity,\nthus the people harbor no deceit.\nWhen the superior is balanced and just,\nthe lower ranks harbor no deceit.\nWhen the superior is pure and unadorned,\nthe lower ranks harbor no craftiness.\n\nLaozi says:\n*If laws of mutual guarantee are established,\nthe people will resent them;\nif decrees reducing rank proliferate,\nmeritorious ministers will rebel.*\nLitigation spreads—\nthe innocent bear the blame.\nRanks are diminished in silence—\nthe meritorious harbor resentment.\n\nThe sagacious discern only the traces of legal documents yet fail to grasp the\n\nThe Sage dwells in seclusion to avoid calamity, remains silent and still to await the proper moment;\nThe petty man knows not the gates of fortune and misfortune—he acts and falls into punishment. Though he makes every effort to prepare, it is insufficient to preserve his body.\n\nThus, the superior man first avoids calamity and then pursues advantage, first shuns disgrace and only then seeks fame.\nTherefore, the Sage always attends to what lies beyond the formless, yet does not dwell on what is already manifest within—thus, calamity has no means to arrive, and praise cannot soil him.\n\nWhen one is ensnared by gain and harm, it arises from love and hatred.\nIf love and hatred do not arise, where do slander and praise come from?\n\nThe noble man sees what is yet unformed and finds it easy to govern; the petty man, though he makes every effort to prepare, ultimately meets disaster.\nTo rescue what is already formed—once it is complete, escape is difficult.\n\nLaozi said: The Way of the common man—his heart should be small, his aspirations great, his wisdom encompassing, his conduct upright, his abilities manifold, his undertakings few.\nBy \"heart small,\" it means to anticipate misfortune before it arises, to guard against disaster with utmost caution, and to dare not indulge his desires.\nBy \"aspirations great,\" it means to embrace all under heaven, to unify disparate customs, to gather all judgments and make them converge at the center.\nBy \"wisdom encompassing,\" it means to have no beginning or end, to flow in all directions, to be deep and inexhaustible like a fountain.\nBy \"conduct upright,\" it means to stand firm and unyielding, to remain pure and unstained, to hold fast to principles in adversity and not to boast in prosperity.\nBy \"abilities manifold,\" it means to possess both literary and martial virtues, to act and rest in accordance with propriety, to wield and discard things with fitting measure.\nBy \"undertakings few,\" it means to grasp the essential and govern the multitude, to hold fast to simplicity and manage the vast, to remain still and thus control the restless.\n\nThus, the one whose heart is small is restrained by the subtle;\nThe one whose aspirations are great embraces all within his bosom;\nThe one whose wisdom is encompassing knows all without effort;\nThe one whose conduct is upright has nothing he will not do;\nThe one whose abilities are manifold governs all without fail;\nThe one whose undertakings are few holds fast to what is essential.\n\nThese six virtues—none but the most exalted Sage or High True One can fully embody them.\n\nThus, when the Sage encounters goodness, he does not deem it too small to act upon, nor does he overlook even the slightest fault without correction. His actions require no shamans or sorcerers, yet ghosts and spirits dare not act before him—this is the height of nobility.\nYet he remains ever vigilant, cautious each day, and thus achieves unity through non-action.\nExternally, he does not fail the world; internally, he feels no shame.\nWhy invoke shamans? Why fear ghosts and spirits?\nBy maintaining constant reverence, one may preserve his end.\n\nThe wisdom of the foolish is already meager, yet their actions are many—thus, they are bound to fail.\nTherefore, governing through proper instruction and teaching is easy and certain to succeed;\nGoverning through perverse teaching is difficult and certain to fail.\nTo abandon what is easy and certain to succeed, and instead engage in what is difficult and certain to fail—this is the folly of the confused.\nWithout measuring gain and loss, one sits and invites ruin.\nWhen undertakings are complex and difficult, though labored, they will fail.\nWhen things are simple and easy to follow, they will succeed—yet to not act upon them is the height of folly.\n\nLaozi said: The rise of fortune is gradual and unbroken, while the birth of calamity is sudden and chaotic. The patterns of fortune and misfortune are subtle and unseen.\nThe Sage perceives their beginning and end—thus, they cannot be ignored.\nFortune is as light as a feather, yet only the Sage discerns it;\nCalamity is as vast as Tai Mountain, yet the foolish see it not.\n\nThe enlightened ruler’s rewards and punishments are not for himself, but for the state.\nWhat benefits himself but serves no function for the state—he does not bestow reward upon it;\nWhat harms himself but aids the state—he does not inflict punishment upon it.\nThe enlightened ruler’s rewards and punishments are based on impartial justice.\nWhat benefits the state and aids the people—he implements it;\nWhat profits himself but harms the people—he halts it.\n\nThus, to uphold propriety in accordance with what is fitting is called a noble man;\nTo abandon propriety’s fitting measure is called a petty man.\nAre noble and petty men fixed in their nature?\nWhen actions and conduct align with what is fitting, he is a noble man;\nWhen actions and conduct defy what is fitting, he is a petty man.\n\nThe highest wisdom is obtained without effort—this is the esoteric understanding of the superior man.\nThe next level is to labor without exhaustion—the diligent common man, striving without weariness.\nThe lowest is to labor while sick—\nThe inferior man’s heart is sluggish and confused, his spirit dull and muddled, thus his labor is excessive and his illness worsens.\n\nThe ancients savored the Dao without clinging to it;\nThe people of today abandon the Dao and yet boast of themselves.\nNot to cling is not to dwell.\nTo savor the Way is to savor.\nThe ancients savored the Way without dwelling, while today’s people have no Way yet praise themselves.\n\nZhou’s ruler made ivory chopsticks—\nChopsticks crafted from elephant tusk—\nAnd Ji Zi sighed, lamenting their extravagant splendor.\nLu buried their dead with wooden effigies—\nEffigies, carved wooden figures resembling humans, used as ritual vessels—\nAnd Confucius sighed, mourning their violation of propriety.\n\nSee where it begins, and you will know where it ends.\n\nThe petty man sees ivory chopsticks—\nchopsticks crafted from elephant tusk—\nand wooden effigies—\ncarved wooden figures resembling humans, used as ritual vessels—\nand assumes that their life is one of honor and their death one of grandeur.\n\nThe gentleman examines them and knows that their Dao is in decline, their fortune lost.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Ren* is what men admire, *yi* is what men hold in high regard.\nTo be admired by men and held in high regard by men—\nyet sometimes one’s own death and one’s country’s ruin—\nis because one did not conform to the times.\n\nThus, he who knows *ren* and *yi* yet does not know the world’s power—\nis not versed in the Dao.\n\nTo vainly extol the virtues of *ren* and *yi*—\nyet fail to recognize the shifts of opportunity and strategy—\nis of no use in averting defeat and ruin.\nHow can such a one be called a man of comprehensive understanding?\n\nThe Five Emperors valued *de* and ruled without action;\nThe Three Kings employed *yi* and punished the violent to pacify the people.\n\nThe Five Hegemons relied on strength—\nstrength in terms of martial and intellectual prowess.\n\nNow, if one applies the methods of the Five Emperors and Three Kings to the age of the Five Hegemons,\nit is not their proper Dao.\n\nThus, what is good or bad is the same,\nyet praise or blame lies in convention;\nwhat is proper or improper is equal,\nyet conformity or rebellion depends on the times.\n\nSpeaking of times being different and governance varying,\nto practice the Dao of the most ancient era in the age of the Five Hegemons\nis like gluing a column to a tuning peg—\na fixed and unyielding approach—\nor quenching thirst with poison.\nIndeed, it is difficult.\n\nHe who knows the Heaven’s workings and understands human affairs\ncan thereby govern the world and traverse the Dao.\n\nTo govern is to maintain the norm.\n\nHe who knows Heaven yet does not know man\nwill fail to engage with the world’s conventions;\nhe who knows man yet does not know Heaven\nwill fail to wander in the Dao.\n\nKnowing Heaven and knowing man,\nknowing convention and knowing the times—\none can govern the world and wander in the Dao.\n\nTo align one’s resolve with true nature and suit one’s emotions,\nif one insists rigidly, one becomes a thief to the Dao—\nusing one’s body to serve external things.\nIf one succumbs to external things, one exhausts one’s vital *qi*—\nlike ice and fire clashing,\nor the extremes of *yin* and *yang* disrupting balance.\n\nThe man who attains the Dao,\nthough outwardly transformed, inwardly remains unaltered.\nOutward transformation is to know man;\ninward constancy is to preserve one’s self.\nThus, within he holds firm to his principles,\nwhile without he bends and adapts,\nmoves with the world without falling into harm—\nthe precious quality of the Dao lies in its *long* variation.\n\nThe man who attains the Dao,\nwhen he acts, does so in harmony with Heaven;\nwhen he is still, he rests upon Earth.\nHis actions and stillness are lost without timing,\nyet his withdrawal and engagement lie within himself—\nthus, convention cannot harm him,\nand the world cannot constrain him.\n\nHence, Master Kong saw the Old Sage—\nLaozi—\nas though he were a *long*.\nVariation without fixed form.\n\nTo uphold a single principle and follow one course of action,\neven if it leads to fulfillment,\nit is still inflexible—\nclinging to petty preferences while obstructing the great Dao.\n\nIf one is stuck in one way,\nhow can one speak of the great Dao?\n\nThe Dao is serene and tranquil, void and formless—\nit does not act upon things,\nnor does it act upon itself.\nBetween things and self, distinction is naturally erased.\n\nThe serene and tranquil state of the Dao\nis effortless yet profound.\n\nThus, to undertake actions while conforming to the Dao—\nis not the Dao’s own doing,\nbut the Dao’s application.\n\nThe Dao is inherently without action,\nyet now it is said to conform to the Dao—\nthis is indeed action.\nAction brings about strife,\nand strife spawns calamity.\n\nSince the Dao has no fixed appearance\nand actions have no fixed conformity,\nto insist upon them is to rebel against them—\nthen disputes arise in confusion,\nand misfortune is the result.\nHence, it is said that this is not the Dao’s own doing.\n\n*Shi* is to set forth—\nto establish norms and rituals as the Dao’s outward expressions,\nnot its true essence.\nThey cannot be rigidly adhered to.\n\nTo adhere is to lose its meaning;\nto act upon it is to fail in its purpose.\n\nThe principle can be made clear.\n\nThe heavens and earth enfold and bear all things,\nthe sun and moon illuminate them,\nthe yin and yang nurture them,\nthe rain and dew nourish them,\nand virtue and the Dao uphold them—\nall share in the same harmony.\n\nThus, those who bear the great round\nand tread the great square\nare said to wear the heavens and walk upon the earth.\nThose who gaze upon the utmost purity\nsee the great brightness—\nto behold the sun and moon.\nThose who establish the utmost peace\ndwell in the great hall—\nto be within the cosmos.\n\nThose who wander in the boundless dark\nshine with the sun and moon,\ngiving life to form from formlessness—\nthus, the true person entrusts themselves to the spirit platform\nand returns to the origin of things,\nreverting to the unborn.\n\nTo gaze into the boundless dark,\nto listen to the soundless—\nwithin the boundless dark, there is alone clarity,\nwithin the stillness, there is alone illumination.\n\nThe true person, dwelling between heaven and earth,\nwitnessing the light of sun and moon,\nwandering in the utmost peace—\nwhere could they go without finding ease?\nResiding in the great hall,\nthey are contained within no boundless dark,\ndiscerning the soundless,\nwhile all sounds respond within the stillness,\nilluminating the formless,\nwhile all forms appear—\nthus, they preserve with heaven and earth,\nshine with the sun and moon,\nentrust themselves to the spirit platform,\nand contain the utmost essence.\nThey are the true person.\n\nTheir use is in non-use,\nand only when not using can they truly use.\nTheir knowing is in non-knowing,\nand only when not knowing can they truly know.\n\n「Before, this was explained.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is what gives rise to all things,\n**Virtue/Power** is what sustains life,\n**Ren** is the proof of accumulated benevolence,\n**Yi** is what aligns with the heart yet harmonizes with the masses, fittingly so.\n\nThese four—used to govern the world and cultivate oneself—must not be abandoned.\n\nWhen the **Dao/Way** is lost, **Virtue/Power** flourishes;\nwhen **Virtue/Power** declines, **Ren** and **Yi** arise.\nThus, in the upper age, the **Dao/Way** prevails yet **Virtue/Power** is not yet established,\nin the middle age, **Virtue/Power** is upheld yet **Ren** and **Yi** are not cherished,\nin the lower age, **Ren** and **Yi** are clung to, fearing their loss—\nso the **Junzi** (noble person) cannot live without **Yi**, and losing **Yi** means losing what sustains their life;\nthe **xiaoren** (petty person) cannot survive without profit, and losing profit means losing what sustains their existence.\nThus, the **Junzi** fears losing **Yi** as misfortune,\nwhile the **xiaoren** seeks profit as fortune.\nObserving their fears, the paths to calamity and blessing diverge.\n\nWhen the **Dao/Way** is abandoned, **Virtue/Power** perishes;\nwhen **Ren** is severed, **Yi** grows thin.\nThe **Junzi** without **Yi** cannot preserve their **Dao/Way**,\nthe **xiaoren** without profit cannot sustain their life.\nThe **Junzi** fears losing **Yi** as misfortune,\nwhile the **xiaoren** pursues profit as fortune.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"If one seeks profit in affairs,\nit only brings harm;\nif one seeks harm in affairs,\nit only brings profit.\"*\n\nTo feed the **hot** (excessive heat) when one suffers from **dampness** (湿),\nto drink the **cold** (excessive cold) when one is parched—\nthis is how the common folk nourish their ailments,\nyet the skilled physician knows it as the cause of disease.\nDelight in the eyes, delight in the heart—\nthe advantage of the foolish,\nthe avoidance of those with the **Dao/Way**.\n\nThe **sage** (圣人) first meets and then aligns,\nthe common folk first align and then meet—\nthus, the gates of misfortune and fortune,\nthe inversion of harm and profit,\nmust be carefully observed.\n\nTo quench thirst with water—\nthe skilled physician sees it as misfortune;\nto take wealth from unjust means—\nthe **Junzi** sees it as harm.\n\nTo first oppose and then align—\nthe folly of the foolish;\nto first align and then oppose—\nthe abhorrence of the sage.\n\nFor harm and profit are contrary,\nmisfortune and fortune are interdependent—\nthey must be carefully observed.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"One with merit who abandons **Ren** and **Yi** will be met with suspicion,\none with guilt who possesses **Ren** and **Yi** will be met with trust.\"*\n\nThus, **Ren** and **Yi** are the natural order of affairs,\nthe most honored rank in the world.\nThough one’s achievements and name may already be established,\n**Ren** and **Yi** must not be abandoned—\nto abandon them invites guilt,\nto uphold them secures honor.\nThough one’s schemes may succeed,\nthey should consider releasing their ambitions to preserve **Yi**—\nif a state exists yet its affairs abandon **Yi**,\nits merit will not be fulfilled.\nThough one’s plans may not align with strategy,\nif they benefit the state,\nand if one’s heart is devoted to the ruler,\nharmonizing with **Ren** and **Yi**,\nthen their life will be preserved.\nHence it is said:\n*\"A hundred words, a hundred schemes,\nthough often misplaced,\nare not as good as abandoning them\nand carefully upholding **Ren** and **Yi**.\"*\n\nAs a subject of the ruler,\nif one schemes to resolve difficulties,\narrogantly honors oneself,\nyet their merit does not succeed—\nit is because they abandoned **Ren** and **Yi**.\nSome may have wise counsel,\nyet it is not used;\nsome may have extraordinary schemes,\nyet they fail to be implemented;\nsome may serve the ruler with all their might,\nthough not noticed,\nyet they preserve **Ren** and **Yi**,\nnever daring to forget them for a moment,\nand thus their life remains unharmed.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"Teaching originates from the **Junzi**,\nwhile the **xiaoren** benefit from its influence;\nprofit originates from the **xiaoren**,\nwhile the **Junzi** enjoy its merit.\nIf the **Junzi** and **xiaoren** each find their proper place,\nthen governance is effortless,\nthe **Dao/Way** is fulfilled.\n**Virtue/Power’s** influence reaches below,\nwealth and profit are offered above—\nthen there is no need for officials,\nyet all things are governed;\nno need for commands,\nyet all things proceed in order.\nEach finds their proper place—\nthis is the fulfillment of the **Dao/Way**.*\n\n**Virtue/Power** (德) as the root, **subordinates** (臣) as the branches—\nif the root is not strong yet the branches flourish,\nsuch a thing has never existed.\n\nThe **sage’s** governance is clear in their **four eyes** (四目),\nperceptive in their **four ears** (四聪),\nrejecting deceit and evil,\ntrusting the virtuous and capable—\nthen the ruler may sit back with hands folded,\ndoing nothing yet all is transformed,\nand the subjects may give their utmost effort,\nfulfilling their duties without strife.\nHow could there be logic in contention?\nThus, the root grows ever stronger,\nthe branches flourish abundantly.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"A benevolent father’s love for his child\nis not for seeking repayment—\nif it were, it could not be sincere.\nA sagely ruler’s care for the people\nis not for personal use—\nby nature, it cannot be otherwise.\nYet if one relies on their strength,\ndepends on their merits,\nand must exhaust them for gain,\nthen benevolence is not extended.\nThe father’s love for his child,\nthe ruler’s care for his people—\nwhy seek repayment?\nThis is the natural division,\nthe **Dao/Way** of heaven.\nSome rulers and fathers,\nrelying on their strength,\narrogant toward their subjects and children—\ntheir benevolence is not extended.\nThus, to use what the common folk love,\none gains the common folk’s strength;\nto raise what the common folk delight in,\none gains the common folk’s hearts.\nHence, by observing their beginning,\none knows their end.\nTo love all under heaven,\nthough the world be vast,\nit is as one family—\nnot to love all under heaven,\nthough the individual be humble,\nthey are like a lone gate in a million fields.\nBy this, the end and beginning may be known,\nlife and death may be discerned.*\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"People rely on **Yi** for love,\ncliques rely on **group strength** (群强) for power—\nthus, the broader the application of **Yi**,\nthe farther the influence of **wei** (威/authority) extends;\nthe thinner the application of **Yi**,\nthe smaller the reach of **wu** (武/force) becomes.\nThis means:\n**Virtue/Power’s** influence is impartial,\nthose who attach to it are many;\nto abandon **Yi** and use **force**,\nthose who remain are few.\"*\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"To take by unjust means yet not distribute—\ndisaster will come to their own person,\nthey cannot benefit others,\nnor can they benefit themselves—\nthis is truly foolish,\nno different from the owl’s love for its young.\nTo take unjustly and hoard without dispersing—\nthis is called **self-destructive nourishment** (养自喷),\n**self-inflicted calamity** (育枭自祸).\nHence, to hold and let it overflow—\nit is better to let it be;\nto grasp and make it sharp—\nit cannot be long preserved.\n\n*(#5: \"热\" and \"寒\" retain their TCM meanings—excessive heat and cold respectively.\n\"盈\" retains its original meaning of \"overflowing\" or \"excessive\" in the context of hoarding.)*\n\nThe gates may be firmly barred and the granaries filled,\nyet they will ultimately become the resources of great thieves—\nhow can such wealth endure?\n\nWithin **virtue/power** lies the **Way/Dao**, and within the **Way/Dao** lies **virtue/power**—\nits transformations are boundless.\n\nThose who embody the **Way/Dao** must possess **virtue/power**,\nand those who possess **virtue/power** must embody the **Way/Dao**.\nWhen **virtue/power** and the **Way/Dao** are fully realized,\nthey align with the boundless transformations of nature.\n\nWithin the bright (yang) lies the dark (yin),\nand within the dark (yin) lies the bright (yang)—\nall things are thus,\ninexhaustible in their manifestations.\n\nWhen fortune arrives, auspicious signs appear;\nwhen calamity strikes, ominous signs precede it.\nTo see auspicious signs yet fail to act virtuously—\nfortune will not come.\nTo see ominous signs yet act virtuously—\ncalamity will not strike.\n\nBenefit and harm share the same threshold,\nmisfortune and fortune dwell as neighbors—\nnone but the sage can distinguish them.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Misfortune is fortune’s shadow,\nfortune is misfortune’s hidden seed—\nwho can fathom their limits?\"*\n\nWithin the bright (yang) lies the dark (yin),\nand within the dark (yin) lies the bright (yang)—\nspeaking of fortune concealed in misfortune,\nand misfortune lurking in fortune.\n\nTo see fortune and deem it auspicious—\none knows fortune is the beginning of misfortune;\nto see misfortune and hastily act virtuously—\none knows misfortune is the precursor to fortune.\n\nThe coming of misfortune and fortune\nis like intertwined strands—\nnone but the sage can discern their limits.\n\nWhen a person’s illness approaches,\nthey first crave the taste of fish and meat;\nwhen a nation is on the verge of ruin,\nit first rejects the words of loyal ministers.\n\nThe sick delight in flavors,\nrevel in delicacies—\na sure sign of impending death.\nA disordered state despises loyal counsel,\ntrusts flatterers—\na clear omen of impending collapse.\n\nThus, when death is near,\neven the finest physician cannot save.\nWhen a nation teeters on ruin,\neven the most loyal counsel cannot preserve it.\n\nOnly the finest physicians and loyal ministers\ncan recognize the inevitable—\nthat which cannot be saved should not be treated,\nthat which can be salvaged must be acted upon.\n\nCultivate oneself first,\nthen one may govern the people.\nManage the household with order,\nthen one may lead the officials.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Cultivate oneself, and **virtue/power** becomes genuine;\ncultivate the family, and **virtue/power** overflows;\ncultivate the nation, and **virtue/power** flourishes.*\nTo observe others through oneself,\nto govern family and state—\nthe essence lies in perfecting **virtue/power**,\nthe key in preserving its integrity.\n\nThe people’s livelihood depends on clothing and food.\nIf these are adequately provided, there is merit;\nif neglected, there is none.\nWhen merit is absent, **virtue/power** does not endure.\n\nClothing and food are the lifeblood of the common folk,\nand the common folk are the foundation of ruler and subject.\nWhen clothing and food are secured for the people,\nthe ruler and officials flourish in the state.\n\nThus, if policies fail despite proper timing,\ndo not alter the laws;\nif governance fails despite proper timing,\ndo not change the principles.\nWhen the time returns, this is called the **Way/Dao**’s rhythm.\n\nThere are rises and falls in the times,\ncycles of prosperity and decline.\nOne cannot use the excessive governance of past eras\nas the essential principles for today—\nsaying laws must not be abolished,\nprinciples must not be altered.\nTo understand this is to grasp the **Way/Dao**’s framework.\n\nThe sage-king enriches his people—\nthis is to strengthen the roots.\nThe hegemon enriches his lands—\nthis is to seek expansion.\nA failing state enriches its officials—\nheavy taxation brings only ruin.\nIf governance seems insufficient in order,\nit will also be insufficient in chaos—\nthis is the subtle beginning of disorder.\n\nA doomed state empties its granaries.\nUnchecked expenditures drain the stores daily,\nthe ruler grows impoverished, the people exhausted—\nwhat more awaits but collapse?\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"When the ruler does nothing, the people prosper;\nwhen the ruler acts minimally, the people transform naturally.\nLet them dwell in contentment,\nlet them take joy in their work.*\n\nTo raise an army of ten thousand costs a thousand gold daily—\nafter the campaign, famine will follow.\nThus war is an inauspicious instrument,\nnot the treasure of the virtuous.\n\nWhen arms are raised, famine follows;\nwhen expenditures are vast, the people grow weary of service.\nThus it is known that weapons are not the sage’s treasure.\n\nTo reconcile great grudges leaves lingering resentment—\nhow can this be called virtuous?\nTo reconcile resentment is to say the ruler is unclear.\nTo demote meritorious ministers,\nto strip territorial lords of their lands—\nto act on a moment’s anger,\nonly to sow future calamity.\nWhen the ruler rages above,\nwhen ministers grow insolent below—\nhow can this be called virtuous, yet accumulate resentment?\n\nIn ancient times, those close were not swayed by words,\nthose distant were not commanded by speech—\nnearby subjects were pleased,\ndistant subjects came willingly.\nTo please the near and attract the far#6—\nthis depends on **virtue/power**, not words.\n\nTo share desires with the people brings harmony,\nto share safeguards with the people brings stability,\nto share concerns with the people brings wisdom,\nto harness the people’s strength brings wealth,\nto earn the people’s praise brings prestige.\n\nActions invite bandits,\nwords invite calamity.\nDo not speak before others,\nfor by the time you act, they have already spoken.\nWhispered words, once spoken, spread far—\nthis is called *transmission*.\nTo speak before others is to have it reach their ears first.\nRumors travel a thousand *li*.\n\nWords are calamity,\nthe tongue is a trigger—\nonce spoken inappropriately, not even four horses can chase them back.\nBandits act from desire,\ncalamity arises from words.\n\nYet words, once spoken, run without feet,\nfly without wings.\nA single blemish on a white jade—\nwhat four horses could chase it away?\nThis is the swiftness of spoken calamity.\n\nThe Yellow Court Master once said:\nThe heavens have five directions—\nthe four cardinals and the center.\nThe earth has five phases—\nmetal, wood, water, fire, and earth.\nSounds have five tones—\n*gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, and *yu*.\nFlavors have five tastes—\nsweet, bitter, spicy, sour, and salty.\nColors have five hues—\nblue, yellow, red, white, and black.\nHumans have five ranks—\nthe five constants.\n\nThus between heaven and earth there are twenty-five kinds of people.\nTwenty-five grades of human worth,\neach with distinct classifications.\n\nThe highest five are:\nthe **Divine Person** (神人), the **True Person** (真人), the **Dao Person** (道人), the **Perfect Person** (至人), and the **Sage** (圣人).\nTo transform without measure is divine,\nto be pure and unadulterated is true,\nto traverse without obstruction is the **Dao**,\nto penetrate profound mysteries is perfect,\nto comprehend all things is sage.\n\nThe next five are:\nthe **Virtuous Person** (德人), the **Exemplary Person** (贤人), the **Wise Person** (智人), the **Kind Person** (善人), and the **Persuasive Person** (辩人).\nTo nurture inwardly is virtue,\nto be benevolent and loving is exemplary,\nto be enlightened and merciful is wisdom,\nto be gentle and harmonious is kindness,\nto possess discernment is persuasive.\n\nThe middle five are:\nthe **Public Person** (公人), the **Loyal Person** (忠人), the **Trustworthy Person** (信人), the **Righteous Person** (义人), and the **Proprietous Person** (礼人).\nTo be without self-interest is public,\nto serve one’s lord with devotion is loyalty,\nto never deceive is trustworthiness,\nto act in accordance with propriety is righteousness,\nto be respectful and yielding is propriety.\n\nThe next five are:\nthe **Scholar** (士人), the **Artisan** (工人), the **Forester** (虞人), the **Farmer** (农人), and the **Merchant** (商人).\nTo serve superiors is the scholar,\nto craft tools is the artisan,\nto oversee mountains and marshes is the forester,\nto cultivate fields is the farmer,\nto facilitate trade is the merchant.\n\nThe lowest five are:\nthe **Common Folk** (众人), the **Servant** (奴人), the **Foolish Person** (愚人), the **Brute** (肉人), and the **Petty Person** (小人).\nThe multitude are the common folk,\nthose bound to labor are servants,\nthose dull and tasteless are foolish,\nthose lacking wisdom are brutes,\nthose lacking discernment are petty.\n\nThe highest five and the lowest five—\nas distant as humans are from cattle and horses.\nTo speak of the wise and foolish is to mark vast disparity,\nas vast as the gulf between heaven and earth.\n\nThe **Sage** moves through the world:\nwith eyes to see, ears to hear, a mouth to speak, and feet to walk.\nA Sage in the world is still entangled by the six passions,\nyet still relies on borrowed forms.\n\nThe **True Person** transcends:\nseeing without eyes, hearing without ears,\nmoving without obstruction, speaking without words.\nA Sage beyond the world—\nthe heart already emptied, all traces erased.\n\nThus, though the Sage stirs the world,\nthe True Person never surpasses them;\nthough the Virtuous Person adorns the age,\nthe Sage never deigns to observe them.\n\nTo govern the world and preserve the True—\neach fulfills their proper measure.\nThus, the sage-king **Tang** and **Yao** aligned their virtue with heaven,\nwhile **Zhong Wu** stood tall to rectify the age.\n\nThe **Dao** is without before or after,\nwithout left or right.\nAll things merge in the Mysterious Oneness—\nneither this nor that.\n\nTo welcome it, there is no before;\nto follow it, there is no after.\nWho can grasp its left?\nWho knows its right?\nErased in the Mysterious Oneness,\nyet named **Dao** by force.\n\n*End of Volume Seven of the **True Classic of the Mysterious Oneness***\n*Volume Eight of the **True Classic of the Mysterious Oneness**, with annotations by **Mo Xi Zi**.*\n\nThe **Dao** is naturally so—\nthis is its supreme designation.\nUnknown yet so, neither is it not so.\nAll things are thus;\nthey cannot but be so.\nYet naturally so,\nnot by any doing or dependence#1,\nhence it is called *natural*.\n\nThe *Laozi* says:\n*\"The clear and empty—this is heaven’s luminosity,\nthe non-doing—this is governance’s constant.\"*\n\nWithin the void, there is spirit;\nwithin darkness, there is light.\nWho can perceive it?\nIt aligns with the **Dao**—\nnon-doing governs itself,\nand all things are thereby perfected.\n\nAbandon favor and wisdom,\nset aside sagehood and intelligence,\nreject the virtuous and the capable,\nabolish ritual and propriety,\nextinguish customs and precepts,\ndiscard flattery and sophistry,\nprohibit deceit and falsehood—\nthen the virtuous and the base alike return to the **Dao**.\nRemove these seven things,\nand the wise have nothing to exalt,\nthe foolish nothing to regret—\nall merge into the Great **Dao**,\nrestoring naturalness.\n\nStillness brings unity,\nemptiness brings harmony.\nSupreme virtue is non-doing—\nall things find their place within it.\nThe **Dao** of emptiness and stillness\nendures as heaven and earth endure,\nits subtlety pervades all things,\nyet it does not dominate.\n\nWhen the heart is empty,\nit is open to all.\nWhen virtue is full,\nit contains all.\nThus it moves with divine efficacy yet has no master,\ncirculates endlessly without weariness.\n\nThe twelve months revolve,\nbeginning anew—\nthe eternal turning of the twelve-month wheel.\nEnd and beginning—\nthis is the **Dao** of heaven.\n\nMetal, wood, water, fire, earth:\ntheir forces may clash,\nyet their **Dao** depends on one another.\nThe Five Phases propel each other—\none ascends, one declines.\nCold and heat alternate,\nadvancing and retreating in their time.\nLife and death follow the **Dao**,\nnever straying from their due.\n\nThus extreme cold harms things—\nyet without cold, it would be impossible;\nextreme heat harms things—\nyet without heat, it would be impossible.\nThus both what is possible and what is not\nare possible.\nHence the Great **Dao** knows no impossibility—\nwhat is fitting is fitting;\nsee what is fitting and act,\nsee what is not and cease.\nPossible and impossible\nare like left and right,\nlike exterior and interior.\n\nCold and heat succeed each other—\nthis is the **Dao** of heaven and earth.\nRites and punishments are the Sage’s laws.\nYet though cold and heat may be harsh,\nthey cannot be absent.\nWhen timing is right, what harm is there?\nThough punishments may be severe,\nthey cannot be abolished.\nWhat is right is not harmful.\nSee what is fitting and act,\nsee what is not and stop.\n\nAll things begin with unity,\ntime marks their measure—\nfrom ancient times to now, unchanging—\nthis is called *heavenly principle*.\nUnity is the **Dao**’s child,\nthe ruler’s grasp.\nThough ages differ,\ntheir operations do not.\nLike an axle turning the hub,\ninner governs outer—\nthe wheel revolves endlessly,\nmatching heaven’s eternal cycle.\n\nAbove, it holds the Great Clarity;\nbelow, it wields its light.\nThe **Dao** generates all things,\nits principle lies in yin and yang,\ntransforming into the four seasons,\ndividing into the Five Phases—\neach finds its place.\nFollowing time’s flow,\nlaws have their constants.\nEven the lowly are included,\nthe **Dao** remains unshaken,\nministers act in harmony—\nheaven’s **Dao** is complete without doing,\nobtained without seeking.\nThus it is known:\nnon-doing yet beneficial.\n\nHeaven displays its symbols to illuminate the four quarters,\nthe ruler establishes laws to govern the world.\nThe *dìchóng*#2 awakens, the people revive with blessings—\nyin and yang never err,\nall things have their constancy.\nWithout non-doing,\nhow could there be benefit to the state?\n\nIn ancient times, **Yao** governed the world while perfecting himself.\nThe *Laozi* says:\n*\"The most pristine is formless,\nthe most vast is boundless.\nThus heaven’s roundness does not fit the compass,\nearth’s square does not fit the ruler.\nPast and future—this is *zhou*,\nthe four directions and above and below—this is *yu*.\nThe **Dao** dwells within yet is nowhere known.\"*\n\nThus those who see not far cannot speak of the great,\nthose who know not broadly cannot discuss the ultimate.\nHe who aligns with the **Dao** and harmonizes with things\ncannot be contradicted.\nMoral **Dao** is vast and formless,\nheaven and earth are boundless yet measureless;\nnear as a hair’s breadth yet unseen,\nfar as the cosmos yet unfathomable.\nUnless one is broadly enlightened and harmonious with things,\nnone can clarify the origin of the ultimate **Dao**,\nnor penetrate the realm of indistinct right and wrong.\n\nThus the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors,\nthough their laws varied by region,\nall won the people’s hearts.\nThough their statutes differed,\ntheir reverence for the people was one.\n\nRules and measures, hooks and lines—\ntools of skill,\nyet not the skill itself.\nThus *Wén* the lute-maker, though skilled,\ncould not compose melodies—\nonly strings could weep alone.\nThus strings are tools of sorrow,\nnot sorrow itself.\nAll things, though called natural,\nhave causes and supports;\nnone act in isolation.\nThe hook and line are skill’s contrivance,\nyet not skill itself.\nPerfection lies in the artisan—\nwithout the line, nothing is straight.\nStrings are sorrow’s tool,\nyet not sorrow itself—\nwithout strings, there is no sorrow.\n\nWhen divine harmony plays between heart and hand,\nspontaneous expression flows,\nmelodies arise from the strings—\nfather cannot teach son,\nson cannot learn from father.\nThis is the **Dao** that cannot be transmitted.\n\n*Wén* played the lute:\nhis fingers plucked the strings,\nhis spirit flowed freely between hand and heart,\nharmonizing with yin and yang’s rhythms,\nthus the music shifted with the seasons.\nQi moved all things—\nso profound that even father and son,\nthough close, could not pass it on.\nThis is the pinnacle of subtlety.\nThus it is also like the **Dao**—\nincapable of transmission.\n\nReverence is the sovereign of form,\nyet silence is the master of sound.\nReverence is stillness—\nthus form arises from stillness, ruled by it.\nSilence holds sound—\nthus emptiness governs it.\n\nThe *Laozi* says:\n*\"Heaven and earth’s **Dao** takes virtue as its master,\nthe **Dao** gives it its name.\nThings regulate themselves;\nthe most subtle penetrates deeply,\nnot relying on affairs or rank.\nThus it stands without merit,\nis not honored by position,\nis not made manifest by name,\ndoes not depend on rites for dignity,\nnor on arms for strength.\"*\n\nThe **Dao** gives birth as its decree,\nvirtue nurtures as its master.\n\nWhen humans harmonize the **suōng** (冲) qi,\nrectify life and nature,\npreserve the essence within,\ndiscard external burdens—\nwhy seek name or rank for self-exaltation?\nWhy rely on arms when all submit?\n\nThus the **Dao** stands without teaching,\nillumination shines without scrutiny.\nThe **Dao** stands without teaching—\nit does not usurp others’ abilities;\nillumination shines without scrutiny—\nit does not harm their affairs.\nWhen the **Dao** exists, teaching fades;\nwhen clarity is absolute, scrutiny ceases—\nonly then can one bear great responsibilities without harm.\n\nThose who teach the **Dao** act contrary to virtue,\nharming all things.\nThus yin and yang, the four seasons,\nmetal, wood, water, fire, and earth—\nall share the **Dao** yet differ in principle.\nAll things share sentiment yet differ in form.\nThe wise do not instruct one another;\nthe capable do not receive from one another.\nThus the Sage establishes laws to guide the people’s hearts,\nletting each return to its natural state.\nThus the living have no cause for virtue,\nthe dead no cause for grievance.\n\nTo act contrary to virtue means\nvirtue declines while teaching flourishes;\nto harm things means\nto first diminish oneself while benefiting others.\nFor the Five Phases differ in nature,\nall things vary in form—\nteaching has its origins and ends,\npeople differ in wisdom and folly.\nThe Sage enacts laws and teachings,\nopens the confused and guides the ignorant,\nso that the wise may pass knowledge forward,\nthe capable may not conceal their talents,\neach fulfilling their role,\nreturning to nature.\nThe living do not boast of their virtue,\nthe dead do not blame Heaven.\n\nHeaven and Earth are not kind—\nthey treat all things as sacrificial dogs.\nThe Sage is not kind—\nthey treat the people as sacrificial dogs.\nHeaven and Earth give birth to all things,\nthe Sage nourishes the people—\nhow could they have intentions toward things,\nor favoritism toward people?\nViewed as one, they are like sacrificial dogs.\n\nCompassion, love, benevolence, and righteousness—\nthese are narrow paths.\nThe narrow confines the great and leads to confusion;\nthe near obscures the distant and causes bewilderment.\nThe Sage’s **Dao** enters the great without confusion,\ntravels far without bewilderment,\nconstantly empty and self-guarded—\nthis is the ultimate, called Heaven’s virtue.\n\n**Dao** and virtue are profound and subtle,\nbenevolence and righteousness are shallow and narrow.\nThe *Zhongyong* (中庸) takes a minor path to lead to confusion,\nthe highest Sage ascends the broad way without obstruction.\nUnless the spirit is ever-clear,\nhow could one align with Heaven’s ultimate?\n\nThe *Laozi* says:\nThe Sage covers like Heaven, bears like Earth,\nis illuminated by the sun and moon,\nharmonizes yin and yang,\ntransforms through the four seasons,\nembraces all things yet does not favor them—\nwithout partiality or preference,\nwithout neglect or closeness.\nThis is the Sage’s virtue.\n\nCovering and bearing like Heaven and Earth,\nilluminating like the sun and moon,\ncycling like the four seasons—\nall creatures, diverse in kind,\ngrasses, trees, insects—\neach finds rest in its place,\nfulfills its nature.\nHow could there be partiality or preference among them?\n\nThus those who model Heaven\nknow Heaven does not act in one season,\nEarth does not rely on one material,\nhumans do not serve one purpose.\nThus undertakings are manifold,\nactions are varied.\nSpeaking of Heaven in one season cannot complete a year,\nusing Earth with one material exhausts its use.\nA single human talent is insufficient for nobility.\nThus in warfare, some are light, some heavy,\nsome greedy, some frugal—\nthese four opposites cannot be unified.\nEach has its advantage,\nso they cannot be one.\n\nThe light wish to strike,\nthe heavy wish to hold firm,\nthe greedy wish to take,\nthe frugal find no gain—\nnot their own.\nWhen armies unite in purpose,\nyet the heavy wish to hold,\nthe light wish to strike,\neach pursues their own advantage—\nthis is not unity.\nWithout unity, defeat awaits when meeting the enemy.\nBut if one measures their talents,\nbalances light and heavy in deployment,\nthen victory is assured.\n\nThus the bold may be ordered to advance and fight,\nbut not to hold firm;\nthe heavy may be ordered to defend resolutely,\nbut not to provoke the enemy;\nthe greedy may be ordered to seize and take,\nbut not to divide spoils;\nthe frugal may be ordered to keep their share,\nbut not to advance and take;\nthe trustworthy may be ordered to keep agreements,\nbut not to adapt to changes.\n\nThe Sage employs these five talents together,\nusing each according to their strength—\nthus the world has no rival.\n\nHeaven and Earth do not cherish any single thing,\nyin and yang do not produce any single kind.\nThus the sea does not refuse the tiniest stream to become vast,\nmountains and forests do not refuse the crooked and bent to become towering.\nThe Sage does not reject the humble words of firewood-gathering\nto broaden their renown.\n\nTo guard one corner while abandoning the rest,\nto take one thing while discarding others—\nthen what is gained is little,\nand what is governed is shallow.\nIf the **Dao** is not broad,\nit cannot embrace all things.\nIf the Sage’s virtue is not profound,\nthey cannot receive subtle words.\n\nThus a single talent is insufficient to serve,\na single region is insufficient to govern.\nThose who guard narrowly are limited,\nthose who serve shallowly are constrained.\n\nThe *Laozi* says:\nWhat Heaven covers, what Earth bears,\nwhat the sun and moon illuminate—\nforms differ, natures vary,\neach finds its place of rest.\nWhat brings joy as joy\nis also what brings sorrow.\nWhat brings security as security\nis also what brings danger.\nTo impose one’s joy upon others brings sorrow,\nto follow their joy brings joy.\nTo impose one’s security upon others brings danger,\nto follow their life brings security.\n\nThus the Sage shepherds the people:\nletting each follow their nature,\nsettle where they belong,\nact according to their ability,\nfulfill their proper role,\napply what is suitable—\nthen all things align in harmony,\nnone transgressing.\n\nThe Sage shepherds the people:\nletting diverse natures and forms\neach find their proper place—\nthough myriad kinds exist,\nthey function as one body,\nnone overstepping.\nThus it is called *one harmony*.\n\nThings under Heaven have no inherent nobility or baseness.\nTo honor what is honored makes all things honored.\nTo degrade what is degraded makes all things degraded.\nNobility and baseness have no fixed measure,\nprosperity and ruin no constant standard—\nthey depend on fortune and misfortune,\nuse and disuse.\n\nThus those who do not exalt the wise\ndo not cast fish onto trees,\ndo not drown birds in the deep.\nSpeak of releasing them to fly in the woods,\nof casting them where they swim in water—\nthen flying and swimming find their place,\nthrough the wise and foolish working together.\n\nThe Sage-Kings of old governed the realm:\n\nWhen Yao ruled the world,\nShun served as Minister of Instruction,\nXiè as Minister of War,\nYu as Minister of Works—\nthe Three Ministers,\ndiscussing the Dao and administering the state,\nharmonizing the principles of yin and yang,\nacting as the sovereign’s limbs and voice.\n\nLater, Xièyì cultivated the fields,\nteaching the people to sow seeds.\nXī Zhōng became the Master of Works,\ncrafting tools to meet the people’s needs.\nThus did the Sage employ the worthy.\n\nTheir achievements reached to the cosmos,\ntheir virtue flowed to the four seas—\nonly Heaven was greater,\nand Yao followed it alone.\n\nHe guided the people:\nthose dwelling by water fished,\nthose in the woods gathered,\nthose in the valleys herded,\nthose on the hills tilled the land.\nThe land suited the work,\nthe work suited the tools,\nthe tools suited the materials.\nGāo and Zé wove nets,\nLíng and Jí plowed the fields—\nthus the people exchanged what they lacked\nfor what they possessed,\ntheir skills for their deficiencies.\nSo few deserted, many obeyed,\nlike wind passing through reeds—\nsuddenly stirring all.\n\nEach responded to purity or turbidity,\nseeking what benefited them,\navoiding what harmed them.\nThus neighboring states lay within sight,\nthe sounds of roosters and dogs carried on the breeze,\nyet no footsteps crossed the borders of the lords,\nno chariot tracks stretched beyond a thousand li—\nall content in their homes.\n\nThe Sage’s Way governed the people:\nsettling them where their strengths lay,\nestablishing them where it suited them,\nso that abundance and scarcity supported one another,\nskill and clumsiness complemented each other.\nLike wind passing through a reed,\nmoistening what it touched,\nits sound followed what it stirred,\nthings responded to what benefited them.\nThus neighboring states lay within sight—\nweapons unused,\nthe people living out their days in peace.\n\nSo chaotic states seemed full,\nwell-ordered ones seemed empty,\ndeclining ones seemed lacking,\nthriving ones seemed abundant.\nThe \"empty\" were not without people,\nbut each held to their duties;\nthe \"full\" were not overpopulated,\nbut all were fixated on trifles;\nthe \"abundant\" were not rich in wealth,\nbut their desires were restrained and their undertakings few;\nthe \"lacking\" were not poor in goods,\nbut their people were few and their expenditures great.\n\nUnderstanding these four truths\nreveals the roots of order and chaos,\ndiscerns the fate of survival and ruin.\n\nThus the ancient kings’ laws were not their own creation,\nbut what they followed.\nTheir punishments were not their own invention,\nbut what they upheld—\nthe Way of Supreme Virtue.\n\nPunishments were not meant to kill,\nbut to set boundaries.\nYet the foolish did not heed their commands,\nand multiplied their transgressions—\nthus they invited death.\n\nLaozi said:\nTo govern the world with the Dao\nis not to alter human nature,\nbut to nurture what already exists,\nexpanding it fully—\nthus following is vast,\nforcing is small.\n\nAncient dike-builders followed the river’s flow,\nfarmers followed the land’s suitability,\nwarriors followed the people’s will—\nto follow is to be unconquerable under Heaven.\n\nThings must first exist naturally\nbefore human affairs can be ordered.\nObserving that all things have inherent natures,\none then aligns with their suitability,\nfollows the people’s desires—\nthen undertakings succeed without fail,\nactions bring no harm.\n\nThus the ancient kings’ laws\nregulated human nature with measured restraints.\nWhat lacked that nature could not be made to conform,\nwhat had it but lacked resources could not be made to obey the Way.\nWood cannot be made to rise from water,\nmetal cannot be made to generate fire.\n\nHumans possess the potential for benevolence and righteousness,\nyet without the Sage’s guidance,\nlaws and measures cannot make them align.\nBy prohibiting what they hate,\ndelinquency is checked—\npunishments unused, authority moves like a god.\n\nFollow their nature, and the world obeys;\ncontradict it, and laws are issued in vain.\nMorality and virtue,\nthough rooted in human nature,\nrequire the Sage-King’s laws to take form.\nBy wielding rewards and punishments,\nguiding with virtue,\naligning with ritual,\nenforcing with law—\nonly then can nature be bent to purpose,\nthough it resists.\n\nFollow their nature, and response is divine;\ncontradict it, and even commands go unheeded.\n\nMorality and virtue\nare the foundation of merit and renown,\nwhat the people cherish—\nwhen cherished, merit and renown stand firm.\nWithout morality and virtue,\nno merit or renown can be established.\n\nThe ancient wise rulers modeled themselves on the rivers and seas:\nthe rivers and seas act without effort to become great,\nhumble themselves to become vast—\nthus they endure as Heaven’s valleys,\ntheir virtue sufficient.\nWithout action, they receive all streams;\nwithout seeking, they obtain;\nwithout striving, they arrive—\nthus they hold the world.\nThey do not claim what they possess,\nso they grow rich;\nthey do not flaunt what they know,\nso they become clear;\nthey do not boast of their strength,\nso they endure;\nthey dwell in what is not theirs,\nso they rule the world.\nThey do not contend,\nso none can contend with them.\nThey do not vie for greatness,\nso they achieve it.\n\nThe rivers and seas are close to the Dao,\nthus they endure alongside Heaven and Earth,\ntheir virtue complete.\nWithout claiming,\nthey grow strong;\nstrong yet not violent toward others,\ntheir Dao deep,\ntheir virtue profound—\nthus their merit and renown are fulfilled.\nThis is called the Mysterious Virtue,\nprofound and distant,\ncontrary to all things.\n\nThe world values the exalted,\nI embrace the lowly;\nthe world prizes boasting,\nI avoid contention;\nI dwell where none claim to be—\nthus I am contrary to all things.\n\nThe world has a beginning,\nyet none knows its principle—\nonly the Sage understands its source.\nNeither male nor female,\nneither yin nor yang,\nit generates yet does not die.\n\nHeaven and Earth were completed,\nyin and yang took form,\nand all things were born.\nThus yin and yang have round and square,\nshort and long,\nexistence and nonexistence—\nthe Dao names them.\n\nObscure and deep,\nyet without action,\nin the heart it is subtle,\nin the Dao it is right.\nLife and death share the same principle,\nall transformations merge into the One Way.\nForgotten in birth,\nunaware of death—\nwhere could one not live long?\n\nAbandon deeds and words,\nbe cautious in non-action.\nGuard the Dao with thoroughness,\ndo not lord over things.\nThe most subtle, formless—\nthis is the end.\n\nThe beginning of Heaven and Earth,\nall things align with the Dao yet manifest in diverse forms.\nThe most subtle holds nothing within,\nthus it can encompass and care for all.\nThe most vast has no outer limit,\nthus it becomes all things.\nThe most minute contains nothing inside,\nthus it is the source of all things’ worth.\nThe Dao preserves life,\nvirtue stabilizes form.\nThe utmost Dao’s measure:\nabandoning preference and aversion,\nwithout knowing—\nharmonizing intent, calming the heart,\nnever opposing the Dao.\n\nHeaven and Earth have a beginning—\nthis is the Dao.\nNone in the world can recognize it,\nfor it cannot be distinguished as male or female,\nnor traced through form and color.\nYet though sought, it is nowhere found,\nthough spoken of, it cannot be grasped—\nand yet it endures eternally.\nHeaven and Earth have high and low positions,\nthe sun and moon have day and night’s order,\nyin and yang have firm and yielding principles,\nall things have long and short natures—\nyet the Dao is neither obscure nor clear,\nneither existent nor nonexistent,\nneither vast nor minute,\nneither round nor square.\nIts revolutions know no end,\nits transformations have no fixed pattern.\n\nYet those who revere it\npreserve life and stabilize form,\nabandon deeds and words,\nvast and effortless, serene and yielding—\nthus they return to the Great Primordial,\nentering the realm of boundless virtue and longevity.\n\nHeaven and Earth, when unified, become One;\nwhen divided, they become Two.\nWhen reversed, they reunite,\nabove and below unbroken.\nWhen unified, they become One;\nwhen divided, they become Five.\nWhen reversed, they reunite—\nnecessarily conforming to the compass and square.\n\nOne is the diffusion of *qi*,\nTwo is the flow of form,\nFive are the Five Phases.\nAbove and below are Heaven and Earth,\nand the person between them—\nif they harmonize with Heaven and Earth’s virtue,\nunify their essence into One,\nthey necessarily conform to the laws,\nand return to the origin.\n\nThe Dao is most intimate yet cannot be neglected,\nmost near yet cannot be distanced.\nSeeking it far away,\none goes forth and returns in vain.\nSeeking it in things,\nnone know to seek it within oneself.\n\nLaozi said:\n*The Emperor* has a name,\nyet none know its essence.\n*The Emperor* values virtue,\nthe King upholds righteousness,\nthe Conqueror grasps principle.\nVirtue nurtures all things,\nrighteousness rescues the drowning and aids the endangered,\nprinciple responds to circumstances and numbers.\n\nThe Sage’s Way in things is nonexistent.\nOnly when virtue is insufficient does one employ intelligence,\nwhen virtue is thin does one resort to punishment,\nwhen wisdom is shallow does one rely on scrutiny.\nThose who rely on intelligence bring chaos to the heart,\nthose who rely on punishment invite grievance from above and below,\nthose who rely on scrutiny prompt the lower ranks to feign virtue to please above—\nthus harming the truth.\nIntelligence spawns deception,\npunishment breeds legal trickery,\nvirtue arises from hypocrisy.\nWhen these three corrupt,\nthe Sage prohibits them—\nnone can overcome them.\nThe harm of straying from the Dao lies here.\n\nThus the Sage follows Heaven and Earth’s transformations,\nadapting virtue accordingly.\nHeaven covers, Earth bears,\nguiding by season—\nits nourishment is profound,\nand profound nourishment brings order.\nOrder and chaos—\nthough there be sages and gods,\nhow could they alter it?\n\nAbandon the mind’s schemes,\nreduce punishments,\nreturn to clarity and stillness—\nthings will self-regulate.\nThe Dao as ruler,\nlike a solemn corpse in silent repose,\nyet the world receives its blessings.\nOne person benefits without favor,\nten thousand benefit without partiality.\n\nThus excessive kindness is folly,\nexcessive severity is tyranny—\nboth oppose the Dao.\nKindness is giving without measure.\nThe Sage observes the times’ corruption,\nthe reliance on deceitful intelligence.\nThus he steadies with virtue and morality,\nreturns to clarity and stillness,\nleaving things to self-regulate,\nguarding the mysterious and silent.\nRestoring them to simplicity,\nkindness is not recklessly bestowed,\npunishment not recklessly imposed—\nthus tyranny and chaos do not arise,\nand all conform to the Dao.\n\nBestowing rewards without merit,\ngranting honors without labor—\nthose who fulfill their duties grow negligent in office,\nwhile the idle rush forward in ambition.\nTyranny is unjust slaughter,\nthe innocent dying,\nthose who follow the Dao being punished—\nthus those who cultivate themselves are discouraged from virtue,\nwhile the wicked dare to defy above.\n\nThus excessive kindness breeds deceit,\nexcessive severity breeds chaos—\ndeceit and chaos are the customs of a dying state.\n\nPunishment cannot be imposed on the virtuous,\nhonors cannot be bestowed without merit—\nthus those who fulfill their duties show signs of neglect,\nthose who follow the Dao harbor resentment.\nThis is the deceit and chaos,\nthe customs of a dying state.\n\nThus when the state executes,\nthe ruler feels no anger;\nwhen the court rewards,\nthe sovereign takes no credit.\nThe executed bear no grudge—\npunishment is justly meted out—\nthe rewarded do not feel indebted to above—\nmerit is naturally achieved.\nThe people know\nthat executions and rewards arise from their own actions,\nthus they strive for merit and cultivate their endeavors,\nnot relying on others’ gifts.\nHence the court is uncluttered, with no traces of corruption,\nfields lie fallow without filth.\n\nRewards suffice to encourage virtue,\npunishments suffice to deter deceit.\nThe rewarded feel no danger from arrogance,\nthe punished feel no pity—\nthus the near benefit from its grace,\nthe distant submit to its virtue.\nIf they perfect their endeavors and exhaust their strength,\nthe court knows no disputes,\nthe fields flourish with crops.\n\nThus the *Taishang* knows and possesses it.\nSpeaking of the ancient *Taishang*’s Dao,\nlater kings took it as their model.\n\nThe Way of the King\nhandles affairs of non-action,\npractices teaching without words,\nremains serene and unmoved,\nmeasures once and does not waver,\nfollows naturally without forcing,\nachieves results without labor,\nplans without error,\nacts without fault,\nspeaks without rhetoric,\nmoves without display—\nadvancing and retreating suit the time,\naction and stillness follow principle.\n\nNeither praising beauty nor hating ugliness,\nneither rewarding nor punishing with joy or anger,\neach name is self-bestowed,\neach category self-classified,\nmatters proceed naturally—\nnone originate from the self.\n\nIf one seeks to constrain it,\none only drives it away.\nIf one seeks to adorn it,\none only robs it of its essence.\n\nThe King, unless vast, cannot contain all things,\nunless still, cannot harmonize the people.\nAbandoning preference and aversion,\ncherishing simplicity and authenticity—\nnarrowness without intimacy,\nornament without harming substance,\nall things, diverse in kind,\nnaturally return to their own.\n\nHeaven’s *qi* is the spirit,\nEarth’s *qi* is the vital breath—\nreversed, they are profound and mysterious,\neach occupying its dwelling,\nguarded without loss,\nascending to the Supreme Unity.\nThe essence of the Supreme Unity\nunifies and merges with Heaven.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is silent and indistinct,\nwithout measure or standard.\nIts greatness cannot be fathomed,\nits depth cannot be plumbed.\nIt ever transforms with humanity,\nyet wisdom cannot grasp it.\nIts turning is endless like a wheel,\nits transformation as wondrous as the divine.\nIn emptiness it follows naturally,\nalways acting after, never before.\n\nThe human *hun* is yang, life, received from Heaven.\nThe *po* is yin, death, received from Earth.\nEach guards its own dwelling.\nThe *hun* is the spirit of yang,\nthe *po* is the essence of yin.\n*Hun* and *po* are the utmost essence of Heaven and Earth—\nthus they are called profound and mysterious.\nHeaven gains them and remains ever luminous,\nhumans gain them and remain ever alive—\nthus it is said: *guard them lest they be lost*,\nand ascend to the Supreme Unity.\nThe Supreme Unity is the Sovereign of the Highest Dao.\nWhat humans receive from it—\nif one guards one’s spirit and essence,\nlest they abandon the body,\nthen one unites above with Heaven.\n\nThe Supreme Unity focuses its essence and accumulates its thoughts,\nthus it is able to communicate.\nThe method of guarding it:\nonly stillness, only silence,\nwithout measure or standard,\nwithout greatness or boundary—\nits subtlety is unfathomable.\nThus it is said:\nit ever transforms with humanity,\nyet wisdom cannot grasp it.\nIts turning is like a wheel,\nits transformation as wondrous as the divine.\nIn emptiness it acts after, never before.\nIn obscurity it enlightens—\nthus it is called the utmost truth.\n\nIn governing, it maintains a vacant heart and weak will,\nclear and bright without darkness,\nthus ministers gather like spokes to the hub.\nWhether wise or foolish, virtuous or base,\nall exhaust their abilities.\nThe ruler gains the means to govern his ministers,\nthe ministers gain the means to serve their ruler—\nthus the governance of the state becomes manifest.\n\nHe who possesses a clear mirror\nwill see the purest essence.\nIn governing the state, ministers vie to honor him.\nIf he does not lightly risk his body,\nthen ten thousand armies will guard him without abandon.\n\nLaozi said:\nHe who knows and loves to ask is sage,\nhe who is courageous and loves to ask is victorious.\nHe who rides upon the wisdom of the masses\ncan undertake any task,\nhe who employs the strength of the masses\ncan overcome any challenge.\nTo employ the strength of the masses,\neven Wu Ge is insufficient to rely upon.\nTo ride upon the momentum of the masses,\neven the world is insufficient to use.\nThe skilled user of the masses\nfinds none stronger than himself.\n\nEmploying the masses’ strength,\neven mountains and hills, though heavy,\ncan be moved by their momentum.\nEmploying the masses’ wisdom,\neven ghosts and gods, though hidden,\ncan be clarified by their reasoning.\nWithout strategy, no force can prevail,\nyet without adhering to principle,\neven the sage cannot succeed.\n\nWhen schemes are laid bare,\neven a commoner can wield a crossbow of ten thousand *jin*.\nWhen reason is perverted,\neven the sage cannot bend a child’s words.\n\nThus the sage, in all undertakings,\nnever fails to utilize their resources.\n\nHe who has one talent occupies one post,\nhe who has one ability serves one task.\nIf strength exceeds the task, the burden is not heavy,\nif ability exceeds the task, the labor is not difficult.\nThe sage employs all together,\nthus no person is discarded,\nno material wasted.\nUtilizing their talents, all exhaust their abilities.\nUtilizing their strengths, all give their utmost.\n\nLaozi said:\nSo-called *wuwei* is not\nthat which, when pulled, does not come,\nwhen pushed, does not go,\nwhen pressed, does not respond,\nwhen moved, does not stir,\nwhen stagnant, does not flow,\nwhen gathered, does not disperse.\nOnly he who adapts and follows the times,\nresponding to things without obstruction,\nis called *wuwei*.\nIt is said:\nhis private desires do not intrude upon public duty,\nhis appetites do not cling to proper conduct.\nHe acts in accordance with principle,\nachieves success through resources,\npushes natural momentum—\nartifice finds no place.\nWhen deeds are accomplished, he does not boast,\nwhen merit is established, he does not claim it.\n\nAs water uses a boat,\nsand uses a plow,\nearth uses a cart,\nmountains use a ladder—\nsummer floods, winter pools,\nusing height to make mountains,\nusing low to make ponds—\nthese are not my doings.\nEach employs what is advantageous,\nall gain their convenience.\nThus it is said: *not my doing*.\n\nThe sage does not shame his humble station,\nbut despises the Dao’s obstruction.\nHe does not grieve over short life,\nbut over the people’s hardship.\nThus he remains ever vacant and does nothing,\nembracing simplicity, seeing purity,\nnot mingling with things.\nEver aligning with the Dao,\nnot mingling with things.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe ancient emperors were not established\nto indulge their desires,\nthe sages who ascended the throne\ndid not seek ease for themselves.\nFor the people of the world,\nthe strong oppressed the weak,\nthe many oppressed the few,\nthe cunning deceived the simple,\nthe brave intimidated the timid.\nAgain, the wise hoarded knowledge without teaching,\naccumulated wealth without sharing—\nthus the Son of Heaven was established to unify them.\nFor one man’s wisdom could not illuminate the land,\nthus the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers were established to assist.\nFor isolated states and disparate customs could not receive his blessings,\nthus the feudal lords were established to instruct them.\nThus Heaven and Earth, the four seasons—\nnone fail to respond.\nNo official hides his duties,\nno state neglects its benefits.\nThus the cold are clothed, the hungry fed,\nthe aged and weak cared for,\nthe weary rested—\nnone are left unprovided.\n\nThe sage in high station\ndoes not seek to exalt his position or delight his body,\nbut to rest the people and relieve their hardships.\nThus the Son of Heaven holds the One to unify,\nthe Three Dukes discuss the Dao to rectify,\nthe Nine Ministers uphold the law to assist,\nthe feudal lords proclaim teachings to honor.\nThus near and far follow the same winds,\nruler and ministers share one intent,\nofficials hold no false emoluments,\nmarkets know no deceitful profits.\n\nThus the *Shijing* says:\n*\"With enlightened virtue and conduct,\nthe four quarters submit to it.\"*\n\nShennong’s form was emaciated,\nYao was gaunt and withered,\nShun was swarthy and black,\nYu’s hands and feet were calloused.\nYi Yin carried a cauldron to serve Tang,\nJiang Ziya wielded a butcher’s cleaver to enter Zhou,\nBai Li Xi was sold as a slave,\nGuan Zhong was bound in chains,\nConfucius lacked a black ox for sacrifice,\nMozi had no warm seat—\nnot for greed of office or lust for rank,\nbut to awaken the world’s benefits,\nto remove the people’s harms.\n\nFrom the Son of Heaven down to the common people,\ntheir bodies unexerted, their minds untroubled,\nyet they seek ease in all matters—\nthis has never been heard of.\n\nFrom Shennong onward,\ntheir forms were emaciated, their hands and feet calloused,\nnot to seek honor by dwelling above the people,\nbut to fulfill the intent of saving all things.\n\nNever has there been one who sat in ease and awaited emolument,\nor who reaped millet without tilling the fields.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"What is called the Son of Heaven*\nis one who upholds the **Dao/Way** to establish the world.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of establishing the world\nis to grasp the One as its foundation,\nto return to the root and act without contrivance,\nto remain empty and tranquil, without possession,\nto drift beyond measure, without boundary,\nto extend infinitely, without end—\nto observe it, there is no form,\nto listen to it, there is no sound.\nThis is called the **Great Dao/Way’s** essence.\n\nIt aligns with the previous explanation.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe **Dao/Way** is\na rounded body yet square in its methods,\na back that shelters darkness while embracing brightness,\na left that yields softness and a right that wields firmness,\na tread upon the unseen while bearing the luminous—\nits transformations are without constancy,\nyet it draws from the origin of the One to respond without fixed form.\nThis is called **Divine Mystery**.\n\nNow, humanity—\nits head is round like Heaven,\nits feet are square like Earth,\nits back shelters darkness while its face embraces brightness,\nits left hand holds softness, its right hand holds firmness,\nits feet traverse the Nine Abysses,\nits head bears the Three Luminaries—\nendlessly revolving, its brilliance illuminating the four quarters;\nunchanging yet ever-turning,\nthis is called **Divine Mystery**.\nThose who behold it prosper.\n\nHeaven is round yet without end,\nso its form cannot be observed.\nEarth is square yet without boundary,\nso its gate cannot be glimpsed.\nHeaven’s transformations follow without defined shape,\nEarth’s growth extends without measure.\nEndless in their transformations,\neven the most enlightened cannot see their forms.\nBoundless in their generation,\neven the most skilled cannot calculate their numbers.\n\nAmong things, there is none that surpasses the **Dao/Way**,\nyet the **Dao/Way** itself has no surpassing—\nfor it is without constant form or measure.\nEndlessly revolving,\nit mirrors the cycles of the sun and moon,\nor the succession of the four seasons—\nday and night, the sun and moon,\nend and begin again,\nbrightness and then obscurity,\nshaping form yet remaining formless—\nthus its work can be accomplished.\nIt nourishes all things yet is not possessed by them—\nthus it prevails without bending.\n\nForm arises from the formless,\nso form persists without cessation.\nThings arise from the **Dao/Way** yet are not constrained by it,\nso it nourishes all things without end.\n\nThe **Emperor** is one who wages war in the **Temple of Dao/Way**,\nthe **King** is one who manifests **Divine Mystery**.\nThe **Emperor** wages war in the **Temple of Dao/Way** by aligning with Heaven’s **Dao/Way**,\nthe **King** manifests **Divine Mystery** by illuminating the four seasons,\nadjusting governance within his realm,\nwhile distant lands reverence his virtue.\nHe prevails in battle before it is fought,\nand the feudal lords come as guests, submitting in service.\n\nThe **Emperor** wages war in the **Temple of Dao/Way** by wielding the **Dao/Way** to conquer,\nthe **King** manifests **Divine Mystery** by triumphing in battle.\nWhen forced to use them, they are employed.\n\nThe ancient ones who attained the **Dao/Way**\nwere tranquil yet governed Heaven and Earth,\nactive yet harmonized with the sun and moon,\ntheir joy and anger conformed to the four seasons,\ntheir commands echoed like thunder and lightning,\ntheir breath and **qi** aligned with the Eight Winds,\ntheir yielding and firmness never transgressed the Five Degrees.\n\nThose who attained the **Dao/Way**,\ntheir joy and anger never issued without cause,\ntheir commands never applied without reason—\nthey governed like Heaven and Earth,\nthey followed like the sun and moon.\nThus the Eight Winds did not clash,\nand the Five Stars did not stray.\n\nThey followed the people’s desires,\nthey harnessed the people’s strength,\nto remove their excesses and eliminate their harms.\n\nThose who share the same benefits\nperish together,\nthose who share the same emotions\nare fulfilled together,\nthose who share the same actions\nassist each other—\nif each follows their own path,\nthe world becomes a battleground.\n\nThus, the adept in warfare\nuses the people’s own strength for their own ends,\nwhile the incompetent\nuses the people’s strength for their own ends.\nUsing the people’s strength for their own ends,\nthe world cannot fail to be employed.\nUsing the people’s strength for one’s own ends,\nno single person can be employed.\n\nRemove their harms,\nand though the world is vast,\nthey will serve you of their own accord.\nDeny their desires,\nand though you are few,\nthey will not submit to you.\n\n**Volume Eight of the *Tongxuan Zhenjing*** concludes here.\n\n**Volume Nine of the *Tongxuan Zhenjing***—\n*Annotated by Mo Xizi*—\n\n#1 **Leaving**: Ho’s version reads *\"Borrowing\"*.\n#2 **Condition**: Huo’s version reads

and low.\n\nThe **Dao/Way**-less sovereigns shine with manifest virtue,\nyet this does not mean supreme virtue—\nthus it is called *lesser virtue*.\n\nLaozi says:\nTo govern the self, the highest is the ancient, mysterious sovereign.\nTo nurture the spirit, take emptiness and clarity as the foundation.\nNext, to nurture the form, take desires as the foundation.\n\nWhen the spirit is clear and the mind is even,\nall limbs are at peace—\nthis is the foundation of nurturing life.\n\nPlump flesh, filled intestines,\nsatisfying desires—\nthese are the trivialities of nurturing life.\n\nThe spirit is the foundation of life,\nthe form is the triviality of life.\nAttaining the foundation preserves the form and aligns with the **Dao/Way**,\nwhile overvaluing the triviality causes the form to perish and return to the earth.\n\nThe sages of antiquity prioritized the foundation and did not indulge the trivial,\nfinding balance in moderation.\nLater ages abandoned the spirit and indulged the form—\nthis is truly excessive.\n\nTo govern the realm, the highest is to nurture transformation.\nThis is to transform through the **Dao/Way**.\nNext is to rectify the laws—\nmeaning penal codes.\n\nWhen people naturally yield to one another,\nstrive for humility,\ncontend for lesser gains,\nand take on laborious tasks,\nday by day they transform toward the superior,\nunaware of how it happens—\nthis is the foundation of governance,\nthe highest transformation.\n\nWith generous rewards encouraging virtue\nand fear of punishment preventing wrongdoing,\nwhen laws are properly established above,\nthe people submit below—\nthis is the triviality of governance.\n\nLater ages govern through the trivial,\nwhile earlier ages nurtured the foundation.\nFirst, one discusses governing the self,\nthen one can govern the realm.\n\nHaving a foundation means having a triviality,\njust as a whole form brings blessing to the body.\nThus, when one knows the **Dao/Way** and virtue is complete,\nthe roots of right and wrong are severed,\nbut when laws are enforced, paths of contention open.\n\nThe sage suppresses the trivial and upholds the foundation—\nhow could this not have its reasons?\n\nLaozi says:\nThe ruler who seeks to govern does not appear in every age,\nthe capable minister who can assist does not appear in every thousand.\nTo seek such a ruler with such a minister—\nthis is why perfect governance appears only once in a thousand years.\n\nThis speaks of the rarity of enlightened rulers and virtuous ministers,\nnot that they never exist in any dynasty.\nTo discuss the worthy and the unworthy,\ntheir use or disuse,\nis not like the case of King Wen’s teacher, Ji Fang,\nor King Wu Ding’s search for the oracle bone master.\n\nIf one seeks such figures exhaustively,\none would not encounter a single ruler in ten thousand years,\nnor a single minister in a thousand—\nwho then would govern the world?\n\nThe achievements of hegemons and kings\nare not established in every age.\nThis means they do not arise in every generation,\nbut the wise occupy them.\n\nIf one follows their good intentions\nand guards against their corrupt hearts,\naligning with the people in the same **Dao/Way**,\nthen the people can be made virtuous,\nand customs refined.\n\nWhat makes the sage noble is not their imposition of punishments for crimes,\nbut their understanding of where disorder arises.\n\nIf one opens the sharp edges of vice\nand lets them run wild in licentiousness,\nthen abandons them to laws and follows with punishments,\neven if they destroy the world,\nthey cannot suppress their deceit.\n\nLaws prevent what has not yet occurred,\npunishments correct what has already happened.\nYet laws must not be乱 (*luàn*—chaotic),\npunishments must not be滥 (*làn*—excessive),\nfor chaos makes them hard to uphold,\nand excess harms the innocent—\neven if they slaughter ten thousand households,\nthe wickedness will not cease.\n\nLaozi says:\nTo stand above the rivers and seas,\nyet have the heart beneath the imperial gate—\nthis is to *heavy life*.\nTo *heavy life* is to burden one’s existence.\nTo *heavy life* is to be burdened by desires,\nyet still unable to overcome them—\nif one follows them, the spirit suffers no harm.\nIf one cannot overcome them yet forcibly resists,\nthis is called *double injury*.\nThose with *double injury* have no longevity.\n\nThe mind cannot serve two purposes at once,\nnor can two affairs arise simultaneously.\nJust as one stands in a secluded, open place\nyet longs for a scene of splendor and honor—\nif one abandons the body to follow the mind,\none can avoid burden.\nBut if one suppresses the body and defies the mind,\nthe two hearts war within—\nthis is called *double injury*.\nTo pray for longevity while bearing *double injury*—\nthis is no empty boast.\n\nThus it is said:\nTo know harmony is to know constancy,\nto know constancy is to know enlightenment.\nTo increase life is auspicious,\nto let the mind direct the *qi* is strength—\nthis is called *mysterious unity*.\n\nUsing its radiance,\nit returns to its clarity.\nBathing the spirit in harmony,\nharmony makes one constant with Heaven and Earth;\nunifying the *qi* with enlightenment,\nenlightenment makes one luminous with the sun and moon.\n\nLaozi says:\nNothing is easier than doing good,\nnothing is harder than doing evil.\n\nWhat is called *doing good* is\nto be still and do nothing,\nto follow nature and avoid excess,\nto avoid temptations,\nto follow one’s true nature and preserve integrity,\nto remain unchanging in oneself—\nthus it is said that *doing good is easy*.\n\nWhat is called *doing evil* is difficult—\nusurpation, regicide, deceit, and haste,\nwith many desires—\nthese are not human nature,\nthus it is said that *doing evil is hard*.\n\nGenerally, people find it easy to do good\nbut difficult to do evil.\nYet what is now considered a great calamity\narises from the lack of constancy in moderation.\n\nThus, in places of gain and loss,\nat the juncture of fortune and misfortune,\none must be discerning.\n\nThe sage has no desires,\nno evasions.\nIf one desires something,\npursuing it only leads to its loss;\nif one avoids something,\navoiding it only leads to its approach.\n\nWhen the will has desires,\nit forgets its purpose.\nThus the sage examines the shifts between action and stillness,\nadjusting the measure of giving and receiving,\nbalancing love and hate,\nharmonizing joy and anger.\n\nIf action and stillness are balanced,\ncalamity will not assail.\nIf giving and receiving are measured,\nguilt will not burden.\nIf love and hate are reasoned,\nworry will not approach.\nIf joy and anger are harmonized,\ngrievance will not offend.\n\nThose who embody the **Dao/Way**\ndo not seek gain lightly,\ndo not shun disaster,\nand what they do not abandon, they do not control.\nThey are always full yet never overflowing,\nconstantly empty yet easily sustained.\n\nThus, if one governs by **Dao/Way** and measure,\nfood fills the empty,\nclothing wards off cold,\nsufficient for warmth and nourishment in a seven-foot frame.\nWithout **Dao/Way** and measure,\neven with the power of a great state,\nit is insufficient for satisfaction;\neven with the wealth of the world,\nit is insufficient for joy.\n\nIf one truly knows contentment,\neven a single gourd’s worth is abundant,\nbut if one is insatiable,\neven ruling the world is insufficient.\n\nThus the sage’s mind is even,\ntheir will is simple,\ntheir spirit internally guarded—\nexternal things cannot deceive them.\n\nWhen the mind is preserved in tranquility and harmony,\nhow can external things overwhelm one’s emotions and desires?\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"He who overcomes others has strength,\nbut he who overcomes himself is truly powerful.\"*\n\nOne who can be powerful must rely on others’ strength;\none who relies on others’ strength must win their hearts;\none who wins hearts must first attain self-mastery.\nThere has never been one who gained others while losing themselves,\nnor one who lost themselves while gaining others.\n\nThis is to say:\n*\"The soft overcomes the hard,\nthe weak obtains the strong.\"*\n\nStrength lies not in oneself but in the multitude—\nso I embrace all strength without losing others’ strength.\nDominion lies not in oneself but in the hearts of the people—\nso all hearts become mine, and thus I win their hearts.\n\nTherefore, the foundation of governance lies in calming the people;\nthe means to calm them is in ensuring their sufficiency;\nthe root of sufficiency is in not disrupting the seasons;\nthe way to not disrupt the seasons is in reducing labor;\nthe root of reducing labor is in moderating expenditure;\nthe root of moderating expenditure is in eliminating arrogance;\nthe root of eliminating arrogance is in embracing emptiness and nothingness.\n\nThis means the ruler does not build lofty pavilions or expand vast parks—\nthen the people will diligently farm without their time being stolen.\n\nThe nature of arrogance and excess,\nthe craving for splendor and luxury,\ncannot be abandoned unless rooted in emptiness and **Dao/Way-virtue**.\nThus, one who understands the nature of life\ndoes not pursue what life cannot provide;\none who understands the nature of fate\ndoes not worry over what fate cannot alter.\n\nKnowing life and fate—\nwhat need is there for worry or fear?\nDelighting in the five colors,\nindulging in flavors,\nlistening to the five tones—\nthe seven orifices contend,\nharming the single **qi-nature**.\nDaily indulging in perverse desires,\nexhausting the natural harmony—\nthe body cannot even be governed,\nhow much less the world?\n\nThe one who truly gains the world\ndoes not claim it by seizing power or titles,\nbut by aligning the world’s heart and harnessing its strength.\n\nTo have the name of ruler without a single person’s loyalty—\nthis is to have lost the world.\nThus, Jie and Zhou were not true kings,\nwhile Tang and Wu were not rebels.\n\nWhen the world follows the **Dao/Way**,\nits defense lies in the four frontier regions;\nwhen the world loses the **Dao/Way**,\nits defense lies with the feudal lords.\nWhen feudal lords follow the **Dao/Way**,\ntheir defense lies in their borders;\nwhen they lose the **Dao/Way**,\ntheir defense lies with their closest retainers.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Do not rely on others not taking from you,\nbut on your inability to be taken from.\"*\nTo practice a path that can be seized\nwhile rejecting usurpation and regicide\nis of no benefit in holding the world.\n\nThe sage governs the world\nby cultivating the self and calming the people,\nnot by chasing titles or power.\nThus, those who follow the **Dao/Way** are revered,\nwhile those without **virtue/power** are abandoned.\nThe world is not a private possession—\nonly the good are worthy of it.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"The wise ruler does not alter established ways,\nnor change what is constant.\"*\n\nAnger is contrary to **virtue/power**,\nweapons are instruments of calamity,\nand contention is the source of disorder.\nPlotting in secret goes against **virtue/power**,\ndelighting in weapons exacerbates disorder,\nand governing through contention is the height of perversity.\n\nNo one can bring calamity upon others\nwithout first cultivating it within themselves.\nInstead, blunt their sharpness,\nresolve their conflicts,\nharmonize their brilliance,\nand blend their dust.\nHuman nature desires to excel over others\nand resents those who surpass them.\nDesiring to excel breeds contention;\nresenting others breeds grievance and strife.\nGrievance and strife disrupt the mind and invert the **qi**.\nThus, ancient sage-kings eliminated contention and grievance—\nwhen grievance and strife do not arise,\nthe mind is ordered and the **qi** flows smoothly.\n\nTherefore it is said:\n*\"Do not exalt the worthy,\nso that the people do not contend.\"*\n\nTo uphold the **Dao/Way** and guard constancy is the sage’s governance;\nto indulge in confusion and invert **virtue/power** is the fool’s rule.\nIf the path of exalting the worthy is not opened,\nhow can the calamity of resentment be avoided?\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"To govern things, one does not rely on things to achieve harmony;\nto govern harmony, one does not rely on harmony to govern people;\nto govern people, one does not rely on people to govern the ruler;\nto govern the ruler, one does not rely on the ruler to govern desires;\nto govern desires, one does not rely on desires to govern nature;\nto govern nature, one does not rely on nature to govern **virtue/power**;\nto govern **virtue/power**, one does not rely on **virtue/power** to govern the **Dao/Way**.*\n\nWithout harmony, one cannot govern things;\nwithout the ruler, one cannot govern people;\nwithout nature, one cannot fulfill **virtue/power**;\nwithout **virtue/power**, one cannot illuminate the **Dao/Way**.\n\nRooting the **Dao/Way** in human nature—\nuntainted, enduring in all things—\nthis is to return to its origin and align with its true nature.\n\nClothing, food, rites, and customs\nare not inherent to human nature;\nthey are acquired from without.\nThe **Dao/Way** serves to tranquilize the spirit,\nwhile things nourish the nature.\n\nNature is the inner self;\nthings are the external world.\nSeeking external things with the inner nature,\nwhen they arrive, they fulfill its inherent demands,\nbecoming the natural order of that nature.\n\nThus, those who follow the **Dao/Way** can abandon things and return to the self.\nReturning to the self reveals the sincere desires of one’s original nature—\nthen all things rest in harmony.\n\nHuman nature is inherently balanced;\ndesires corrupt it.\nOnly those who follow the **Dao/Way** can abandon things and return to the self.\nWith self-awareness, one does not lose sight of things’ true essence;\nwithout self-awareness, one is misled by constant scheming.\n\nTo indulge desires is to lose one’s nature;\nevery action is misaligned—\ngoverning life leads to self-ruin,\ngoverning the state leads to chaos.\nThus, without understanding the **Dao/Way**, one cannot return to nature.\nFrom governing things to cultivating the **Dao/Way**,\nnone have ever been properly aligned.\n\nIllness arises from desire.\nDesire is the root of calamity,\nthe gateway to disaster—\nwithout clarifying **Dao/Way-virtue**, one cannot restore the true self.\n\nAncient sages attained this from within themselves,\nthus their commands were obeyed and prohibitions respected.\nIn all undertakings, one must first calm the mind and clarify the spirit.\nOnly when the spirit is clear and the mind composed\ncan affairs be properly ordered.\nIf judgment is clouded by praise or blame,\nif the eyes are dazzled by colors,\nhow can affairs be rightly governed?\nThus, emptiness is held in highest regard.\n\nWater, when stirred, creates waves;\n**qi**, when disordered, brings confusion.\nConfused wisdom cannot be relied upon for rectitude,\nturbulent water cannot be still.\nThus, the sage-king holds to the One\nto regulate the emotions and nature of things.\n\nThe One is the most precious—\nit has no fixed place in the world.\nThe sage-king entrusts himself to this boundlessness,\nthus commanding the world’s fate.\n\n「The attainment of **Dao/Way** within oneself lies in calming the mind.\nThe mind’s composure comes from the heart not being swayed by external things,\nthe eyes not fixated on colors,\nunifying the spirit and harmonizing joy and anger,\nthus attaining to the **qi**’s purity untainted by passions,\nand the passions’ waves not rising.\nAll follow their nature in reverse,\nyet none dare defy the sovereign’s command.\n\nLaozi said:\nYin and Yang nurture all things,\nall born riding upon the **One Qi**.\nWhen ruler and subject are estranged, **qi** ascends and churns above;\nWhen the sovereign and ministers are discordant, the five grains fail to flourish.\nSpring’s harshness and autumn’s withering,\nwinter’s thunder and summer’s frost—\nall these are born of the **Dao/Way**’s violators.\n\nBetween heaven and earth, a single person’s body;\nWithin the six extremes, a single person’s form.\nOne person—**the Son of Heaven**.\nOne person upright, and the world attains peace;\nOne person corrupt, and all peoples suffer harm.\nThus, bound to heaven and earth,\npenetrating the six extremes,\nhow can one be too cautious?\n\nThose who are clear about their nature\ncannot be coerced by heaven and earth;\nThose who are precise with **symbols/rituals**\ncannot be misled by strange creatures.\nWhen nature aligns with truth,\nthunder and lightning press yet do not frighten.\nWhen clarity illuminates all things,\nYin and Yang confuse yet none dare doubt.\n\nThe sage discerns the near to know the far,\ntreating ten thousand miles as one realm.\nWhat is gained within is made manifest without;\nWhat is mastered in the One permeates all.\nWhen **qi** churns within heaven and earth,\nrituals and propriety are not established,\nand all peoples dare to encroach and oppress,\narising from the depths of **mixed chaos**.\nAccumulated virtue receives the **spirit’s** aid,\naccumulated vice incurs the **spirit’s** blame.\nYet **qi** of like kind calls to like—\nvirtue and vice hold no distinction.\nDo not say that within **mixed chaos** there is no effect of retribution.\n\nWhen shame and modesty decline,\nand in times of societal decay,\nefforts multiply yet wealth dwindles,\nlabor is excessive yet sustenance insufficient,\nthe people grow poor and wrathful, strife arising—\nthus, **ren** is held in highest regard.\n**Ren** brings peace.\n\nWhen people are coarse and unaligned,\nclustering in factions and cliques,\neach advancing their own,\nnurturing deceitful and cunning schemes—\nthus, **yì/rightness** is held in highest regard.\n**Yì** cuts through the excess.\n\nWhen men and women dwell together in groups,\nunrestrained and without distinction—\nthus, **lǐ/ritual** is held in highest regard.\n**Lǐ** brings order.\n\nWhen natural impulses grow wild,\npressing upon one another beyond restraint,\ndisharmony arises—\nthus, **yuè/music** is held in highest regard.\n**Yuè** brings moderation.\n\nThus, **ren**, **yì**, **lǐ**, and **yuè**—\nthese are means to remedy failure,\nnot universal paths to governance.\nTo value **ren** alone\nis not to save what is flawed—\nthis is not the **ultimate virtue/power**.\n\nIf truly one can establish the **spirit’s** clarity throughout the world,\nand return the heart to its origin,\nthen the people’s nature becomes good.\nWhen the people’s nature is good,\nheaven and earth, Yin and Yang, follow and embrace them,\nthen wealth is abundant and people are nourished,\nand the hearts of greed, coarseness, and strife cannot arise.\n**Ren** and **yì** are not needed,\nyet **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way** are established in the world,\nand the people do not indulge in colors.\n\nThus, when **virtue/power** declines, **ren** and **yì** are adorned;\nWhen harmony is lost, music is praised;\nWhen **ritual/lǐ** grows licentious, outward decorum is emphasized.\nHence, one must first know **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**\nbefore understanding that **ren** and **yì** are insufficient to practice;\nOne must first know **ren** and **yì**\nbefore understanding that **ritual/lǐ** and **yuè/music** are insufficient to cultivate.\n\n**Virtue/power** and **Dao/Way** encompass all beneath heaven.\nThus, those who possess the **Dao/Way** include **ren**, **yì**, **lǐ**, and **yuè**,\nholding them all in readiness.\n\nSome say to abandon and extinguish these four\nand claim to possess the **Dao/Way**—\nthis is not a comprehensive view.\n\nThe sage-king pities the world’s decline,\nyet without **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**,\nthus values **ren**, **yì**, **lǐ**, and **yuè**,\nrestraining nature and harmonizing emotions,\npreserving propriety and reverence,\nexalting respect and yielding,\nso none dare overstep—\nto restore **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**.\n\nLaozi said:\nGovernance through **qīngjìng**—\nharmonious and yielding, yet tranquil and still,\nsimple and true, natural and unadorned,\nquiet and undisturbed—\nwithin, it aligns with the **Dao/Way**;\nwithout, it conforms with **yì/rightness**.\nIts words are few yet follow reason;\nIts actions are pleasing yet accord with nature;\nIts heart is harmonious yet unfeigned;\nIts deeds are plain yet not ostentatious.\nIt does not plot beginnings,\nnor debate endings.\nAt peace, it remains; when stirred, it acts.\nIts body permeates heaven and earth,\nits essence unites with Yin and Yang,\nits harmony aligns with the four seasons,\nits clarity shines like the sun and moon.\nIt follows the **Dao/Way**’s transformations—\nthis is the **true person**.\n\nThis is the **true person** who governs with **qīngjìng**,\naligning with heaven’s **Dao/Way** and harmonizing with the **Way**.\n**Ren** is free from **jīqìao**—\ndeceit and artifice.\n\nThus, heaven covers with **virtue/power**,\nearth bears with **yuè/music**,\nthe four seasons do not lose their order,\nwinds and rains do not act as disasters,\nthe sun and moon remain clear and radiant,\nthe five stars do not stray in their courses—\nthis is the clarity of **qīngjìng**.\n\nThe **true person**’s governance\nresponds to heaven and earth.\nThus, the sun and moon shine brightly yet do not force,\nand calamities do not arise.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe duties of governance in a **harmonious age** are easy to uphold,\nits affairs are simple to execute,\nits **ritual/lǐ** is straightforward to practice,\nits rewards are clear to bestow.\nThus, one person does not hold multiple offices,\noffices do not overlap with scholars,\nscholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants\nkeep to their own districts and states.\n\nThus, farmers speak with farmers of **cáng/hidden matters**,\nscholars speak with scholars of conduct,\nartisans speak with artisans of skill,\nmerchants speak with merchants of calculations—\nso scholars lack no proper action,\nartisans suffer no laborious toil,\nfarmers waste no effort,\nmerchants lose no goods,\neach finding contentment in their nature.\n\nDiverse forms and natures,\nsimple yet not contradictory,\nlose their occupation and become despised,\ngain their ambition and become honored.\nThe *Easy Words of the Yi* say:\n**Qián** is easy to know,\n**Kūn** is simple in ability.\nThe sage governs without action,\nthe people do not weary of their labors,\neach finding contentment in their work,\nall rejoicing in their lives.\n\nThus, governance is easy yet not chaotic,\nthe four classes gain their due—\nthis is honored;\nlose their standing—\nthis is degraded.\n\nThose with foresight and distant vision\nare the most talented,\nyet in a **harmonious age**, no blame is assigned to them.\nNo blame is placed upon them.\nThose with vast knowledge and strong resolve,\neloquent and quick-witted,\nare those whose understanding overflows,\nyet the wise ruler does not demand from those below.\nThe clever and quick are not necessarily loyal and upright—\nthis is because the ruler does not seek from those beneath him.\n\nTo abandon the world’s coarse and despised,\nnot conforming to common customs,\nis the conduct of scholars,\nyet in a **harmonious age**, this is not how the people are transformed.»\n\nThe age of extravagance and neglect of customs cannot serve as a model.\n\nThus, those whose heights are unattainable should not be the measure for all;\nthose whose conduct is beyond imitation should not be the standard for the realm.\n\nTherefore, talent cannot be monopolized or constrained by rigid measures,\nwhile the Dao/Way and its methods may be passed down through generations.\n\nThese principles in a harmonious age—\nscholars must discern their talents and employ them accordingly.\nOnly those who grasp the luminous Dao/Way and adapt with the times\ncan assist in governance.\n\nThus, when the realm is well-ordered, even the unlearned can uphold its ways,\nand military formations can be standardized by law.\n\nWithout awaiting ancient sages, the people suffice in their own right—\nutilizing what they possess and combining their strengths.\n\nGovernance lies in timely adaptation, not in seeking novelty;\neloquence should emphasize substance, not empty rhetoric or debate.\n\nYet if one measures ability and assigns positions appropriately,\nthere will never be a time without capable rulers.\n\nWhy wait for ancient worthies when the world is already well-ordered?\n\nThe laws of the declining age\nset lofty standards yet fail to reach their mark,\nimpose heavy burdens yet cannot bear the punishment,\nand create peril yet dare not execute.\nThe people, burdened by these three oppressions,\nadorn their cunning to deceive the ruler,\npursue vice while courting danger—\nthough harsh laws and severe punishments are enforced,\nthey cannot suppress their deceit.\n\nWhen beasts are cornered, they strike;\nwhen birds are cornered, they peck;\nwhen people are cornered, they deceive—\nthis is their nature.\n\nTo apply the law and punish only when crimes are committed\nis to kill by law, not to govern.\n\nThose filled with anxiety and fear\nadorn their cunning, distort the truth, and scheme to gain advantage—\nlike birds and beasts driven to desperation,\ntheir defiant hearts disregard their own lives.\n\nThus, the Sage values the Dao/Way over laws.\n\nLaozi said:\n*The thunder’s roar can be imitated by bells and drums;\nthe shifts of wind and rain can be understood through music’s tones.\nWhat is vast and visible can be measured;\nwhat is bright and apparent can be exhausted;\nwhat is audible can be tuned;\nwhat is discernible can be distinguished.\n\nYet the utmost vastness—heaven and earth cannot contain it;\nthe utmost subtlety—spirit and clarity cannot perceive it.\n\nWind, rain, thunder, and lightning—\ntheir forms, sounds, colors, and symbols\ncan be categorized and applied to affairs.\n\nBut when it comes to the utmost vastness and subtlety—\nthis is the Dao/Way,\nwhich heaven and earth cannot encompass,\nwhich spirit and clarity cannot fathom.\n\nWhen establishing laws and calendars,\ndistinguishing the five colors,\nseparating purity and turbidity,\ndiscerning sweet and bitter tastes—\nthen the undifferentiated is dispersed into tools.\n\nWhen establishing benevolence and righteousness,\nrefining rituals and music—\nthen virtue shifts into artifice.\n\nThe people adorn their cunning to astonish the ignorant,\nemploy deceit to attack their superiors—\nthough some may uphold these ways,\nnone can truly govern with them.\n\nThe more cleverness abounds, the more virtue declines—\nthus, the perfect one remains pure and undivided.\n\nThe perfect one’s governance is\nempty, silent, and tranquil—\nseeing no desires,\nthe heart and spirit dwell in harmony,\nthe form and nature align,\nstillness embodies virtue,\naction flows with principle,\nfollowing the Dao/Way of nature\nonly when necessity arises.\n\nVague and effortless, yet the world harmonizes;\nindifferent and desireless, yet the people return to simplicity.\nWithout contention, resources suffice.\nThe giver does not hoard,\nthe receiver does not refuse—\nvirtue returns naturally,\nyet none can claim credit.\n\nSpeech without words,\nthe Dao/Way beyond explanation—\nif one attains this,\nit is called the Celestial Storehouse.\n\nTake from it without depletion,\ndraw from it without exhaustion—\nnone know its source,\nfor the undifferentiated disperses and loses its origin.\nThus, the Sage acts and refines,\nrestoring them to their natural state,\nconcealing them in the Celestial Storehouse,\ntaking without diminishing,\ngiving without excess.\n\nThis is called *Yao Guang* [Shaking Brilliance].\n*Yao Guang* is the resource for all things.\nIts luminous radiance and luminous standard\nare displayed within,\ngoverning the ten thousand things of the four quarters,\ncommanding them as its provision.\n\nLaozi said:\n*Heaven cherishes its purity,\nearth cherishes its levelness,\nhumans cherish their sincerity.\nHeaven’s purity—\nthe sun, moon, stars, and constellations,\nthunder and wind, rain and mist.\nEarth’s levelness—\nwater, fire, metal, wood, and soil.\nHuman sincerity—\nthought, perception, cleverness, joy, and anger.\n\nThus, closing the four gates,\nhalting the five pathways—\nthis aligns with the Dao/Way.\n\nSpirit and clarity are hidden in the formless,\nqi returns to its true essence.\nThe eyes see clearly yet do not gaze,\nthe ears hear keenly yet do not listen,\nthe mouth speaks appropriately yet does not speak,\nthe heart’s pathways are open yet do not deliberate.\nAbandoning action, knowing without arrogance,\nfollowing nature’s essence,\none knows yet cannot be harmed.\n\nWhen essence resides in the eyes, vision is clear;\nwhen it resides in the ears, hearing is acute;\nwhen it lingers in the mouth, speech is precise;\nwhen gathered in the heart, thought is lucid.\n\nThus, closing the four gates\nensures a life free from calamity—\nthe limbs and orifices neither die nor live,\nthis is called the True Person.\n\nHeaven’s four gates are the sun, moon, stars, and constellations.\nThe five pathways are the five phases.\n\nSpeaking of the four seasons having their due,\nthe five phases having their measure—\nthen heaven and earth are clear and bright,\nand the people and creatures flourish.\n\nHuman four gates are the heart, mouth, ears, and eyes.\nThe five pathways are the five viscera.\n\nWhen essence and spirit are preserved,\nthe four gates do not move recklessly;\nthe five pathways do not receive false stimuli—\nvision is clear, hearing is acute,\nspeech and action are without fault—\nthus, calamity and harm cannot reach the body,\nand death does not dwell in the mind.\nThis is the domain where the True Person dwells in the Dao/Way.\n\nEarth’s production of wealth\nhas no greater foundation than the five phases.\nThe Sage regulates the five phases,\nand thus governance does not falter.\n\nThe Sage, by harmonizing the five emotions with the five phases,\nprevents chaos in the world—\nhow much more so for ordinary people?\n\nLaozi said:\n*When balanced left and right,\nthere is no private preference for light or heavy,\nthus it can serve as level.\nWhen measured within and without,\nthere is no private bias for crooked or straight,\nthus it can serve as upright.\nWhen the ruler applies law,\nthere is no private favor or aversion,\nthus it can serve as command.\n\nVirtue has no fixed place,\ngrudges have no place to hide—\nthis is to entrust oneself to the Dao/Way\nand align with human hearts.\n\nThese three principles—\nrelying on impartiality—\nestablish levelness,\npreserve uprightness,\nand enact command;\n\nThe Sage does not abandon virtue to the external world,\nnor conceal grudges within.\nTo entrust oneself to the Dao/Way even unto death—\nthe common people remain unaware.\n\nThus, those who govern know not to interfere.\n\nWater capsizes a boat, wood snaps an axle—\nyet one does not blame the wood and stone,\nbut punishes the clumsy and the skilled.\nThis is not wisdom.\n\nWater has no intent to capsize a boat,\nwood no mind to snap an axle—\nyet one blames the clumsy and the skilled,\nfor this is not the work of wisdom.\n\nTo govern a state with wisdom is to be its ruin.\n\nThus, when the Dao/Way is mixed with wisdom, there is chaos;\nwhen virtue is mixed with intent, there is peril;\nwhen the mind is mixed with perception, there is dizziness.\nTo cease wisdom is to avoid chaos,\nto forget intent is to avoid peril,\nto sever perception is to avoid dizziness—\nall are acts of forgetting.\n\nThe scales and compasses, the square and the circle—\nfixed and unchanging,\never consistent and never crooked,\nmoving straight without hesitation.\nOnce shaped, they endure for ten thousand generations—\nthis is the Way of *wuwei* (non-action).\n\nThe scales are not unbalanced,\nthe plumb line not crooked—\nyet those who wield them err.\n\nThe Dao/Way is not empty,\nvirtue not obscure—\nyet those who cultivate it stray.\n\nThe One is *wuwei*—\nused by a hundred kings,\ntransmitted for ten thousand generations,\nyet never altered.\n\nThe One is *wuwei*—\nused by a hundred kings,\ntransmitted for ten thousand generations without change.\n\nAll who act without emotion or private bias,\nmeeting the One in all things—\nthough they act all day,\nnever once do they act.\n\nThis Dao brings governance—\ncorrect and unchanging.\n\nOtherwise, how could the balance and measure\nbe crafted in a single day\nyet never altered for ten thousand generations?\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"The people say:\n'A kingdom has a lost ruler,\nan age has lost the Dao/Way.'\n\nA person may reach exhaustion,\nyet reason remains unblocked.\nThus, *wuwei* is the essence of the Dao/Way.\n\nTo grasp the essence of the Dao/Way\nis to respond to the boundless.\nThen why do kingdoms perish?\nBecause they lack the correct Dao/Way.\n\nHe who reaches exhaustion yet remains unblocked—\nthis is the Dao/Way.\nTo act without clinging—\nthis is virtue.\nThe essence of *wuwei* responds to the boundless.\n\nThus, if one does not follow the numbers of Dao/Way\nand instead relies solely on one’s own ability,\nexhaustion will come swiftly.\n\nTo pride oneself in one’s own virtue\nwhile neglecting the Dao/Way—\nruin and humiliation will soon follow.\n\nThe sovereign need not leave his door\nto know the world—\nby observing things, he knows things;\nby observing people, he knows people.\n\nThus, where strength is gathered, nothing is unconquerable;\nwhere many minds unite, nothing is unachievable.\n\nA thousand-strong force lacks no provisions,\na ten-thousand-strong host lacks no purpose.\nCraftsmen have no conflicting skills,\nscholars hold no dual offices—\neach guards their duty,\nnone overstepping their bounds.\nPeople find their proper place,\nthings find their natural rest—\nthus tools are not despised,\nduties not neglected.\n\nBy observing one thing, one knows the nature of another;\nby measuring oneself, one discerns the nature of others.\n\nHe who skillfully uses the many\ncan divert rivers and fill seas;\nhe who skillfully uses people\ncan exhaust their hearts and strength.\n\nDebt is light when few,\nduties are easy when simple,\nburdens are light when light—\nthus the sovereign enforces minimal demands,\nand the people perform with ease.\nHence, ruler and subjects endure without weariness.\n\nThis is the virtue of simplicity—\nthus there is no labor or fatigue.\n\nLaozi said:\n*The Sage embodies the Great Unity.\nThe Great Unity takes emptiness and nothingness as its origin,\ncleanness and stillness as its essence—\nthus the Sage and king should embody it.\n\nThe king follows the patterns of yin and yang,\nmoving with measured rhythm.\n\nThe hegemon aligns with the four seasons,\nnever departing from their due.\n\nThe ruler applies the six *lü* (musical pitches),\nharmonizing with all things in moderation.\n\nTo embody the Great Unity is to understand\nthe nature of Heaven and Earth,\nto harmonize with the principles of virtue and the Dao/Way;\nto shine with the clarity of sun and moon,\nto resonate with the spirit of all things;\nto move and rest in accord with yin and yang,\nto rejoice and anger in harmony with the four seasons;\nto cover all things with the Dao/Way,\nspreading broadly without favor—\neven the smallest creatures,\ncreeping or flying,\nall depend on virtue to live.\n\nVirtue extends beyond the realm,\nand fame endures through the ages.\nThus, the ancient Sage-kings governed the world with the Dao/Way.\n\nTo follow yin and yang is to inherit\nthe harmony of Heaven and Earth,\nto share brilliance with Heaven and Earth,\nto shine with the radiance of sun and moon,\nto resonate with the spirits of gods and ghosts;\nto wear the round and tread the square,\nto embrace the standard and sleep with the plumb line—\nwithin, to govern the body;\nwithout, to win the hearts of people.\nWhen orders are issued, the world follows like the wind.\n\nThe Five Emperors governed the world with virtue.\n\nTo align with the four seasons is to\ntake and give in due measure,\nto enter and exit with restraint—\njoy and anger, firmness and gentleness,\nnever straying from principle.\nGentle yet unbreakable,\nfirm yet unfractured,\nbroad yet not licentious,\nsolemn yet not rebellious—\nto nurture all things with ease and submission,\nto abandon folly and embrace the unworthy,\nwithout private favor.\n\nThe Three Kings governed the world with benevolence.\n\nTo apply the six *lü* is to\ngive life and take it,\nto reward and punish,\nto bestow and withhold—\nthis is the Dao/Way.\nTo subdue chaos and restrain violence,\nto elevate the worthy and discard the unworthy,\nto correct the crooked and establish the straight,\nto clarify the paths of opening and closing,\nto ride the times and leverage circumstances,\nto serve and govern the hearts of people—\nthis is the way of the Five Hegemons governing with righteousness.\n\nThe Sage who does not embody yin and yang will be overrun;\nthe king who does not follow the four seasons will be diminished;\nthe hegemon who does not use the six *lü* will be humiliated;\nthe ruler who loses the plumb line and square will be deposed.\n\nThus, the small acting as the great\nwill reach exhaustion without intimacy;\nthe great acting as the small\nwill become narrow and unyielding.\n\nIn the age of the Sage-kings,\nvirtue and the Dao/Way had degrees of excellence;\nin the age of the Five Hegemons,\nbenevolence and righteousness had varying depths.\nGreat and small could not transgress their bounds.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"Though a land be vast and its people numerous,\nthis is not true strength;\nthough armor be sturdy and weapons sharp,\nthis is not reliable victory;\nthough walls be high and moats deep,\nthis is not true defense;\nthough punishments be severe and laws harsh,\nthis is not true authority.\"*\n\nThe three cannot be relied upon—only the virtuous/powerful can rule.\n\nFor those who preserve governance, though small, they endure;\nfor those who abandon governance, though great, they perish.\n\nThus, the skilled in defense need no resistance—*yin* and *yang* suffice.\nThe skilled in war need no battle—\nthey ride the times and follow the people’s desires,\nand all under Heaven submits.\n\nTherefore, the skilled in governance accumulate virtue/power;\nthe skilled in wielding arms cultivate forbearance.\nWhen virtue/power is accumulated, the people may be used;\nwhen anger is restrained, authority may be established.\n\nWhere the *wen* (cultural refinement) extends deeply,\nthe *quan* (authoritative measures) command greatly;\nwhere virtue/power is broadly applied,\nthe authority controls widely—\nthis is to strengthen oneself while weakening others.\n\nThe skilled in wielding arms first weaken the enemy, then engage—\nthus, their expenditures are halved while their achievements are tenfold.\n\nA thousand-chariot state practicing *wen* (cultural governance) rules;\na ten-thousand-chariot state fond of war perishes.\n\nThe victorious army wins first, then fights;\nthe defeated army fights first, then seeks victory—\nthis is ignorance of the Dao/Way.\n\nLightly wielding arms, though great, will perish;\nskillfully employing governance, though small, will flourish.\n\nPreserving the myriad households in the land of no death—this is victory;\ndriving the people into the land of corpses—this is certain defeat.\n\n*[End of Volume Nine of the Treatise on the Mysterious and True]*\n*[Volume Ten of the Treatise on the Mysterious and True, with annotations by Mo Xi Zi]*\n\nThe benevolent sovereign of **upper virtue** and the virtuous/powerful sovereign of **upper Dao** will have all under heaven flock to him;\nthe sovereign of **upper virtue** will have all within the seas come to him;\nthe sovereign of **upper righteousness** will have one state unite under him;\nthe sovereign of **upper propriety** will have one village follow him.\nWithout these four, the people will not flock to him.\nFrom *\"Upper Virtue\"* onward, no chapter annotations are given—its meaning is similar.\n\nThe *Laozi* says:\nThe **Dao/Way** of the gentleman is to cultivate stillness to refine oneself,\nto practice frugality to nourish life.\nStillness means not disturbing below—\nif below is not disturbed, the people will not grumble;\nif below is disturbed, governance will falter—\nthe people grumble when virtue/power is thin.\nWhen governance falters, the wise do not offer counsel;\nwhen virtue/power is thin, the brave do not fight.\nThe enlightened sovereign cultivates stillness to refine himself,\npractices frugality to nourish life,\nso that above there is no chaotic governance and below there are no grumbling people.\nThen the wise offer counsel of their own accord,\nand the brave fight for their own sake.\nThe chaotic sovereign is not thus:\nIn one day, he may possess the wealth of all under heaven,\ncommand the power of one sovereign,\nexhaust the people’s strength to gratify his senses,\nwhile his ambitions fix on palaces and pavilions,\nmoats and ponds, gardens and enclosures,\ntigers and rare beasts.\nThe poor suffer hunger and cold,\nwhile the halls are decked in embroidered silks.\nThus, though the sovereign hoards these useless things,\nthe world does not rest beneath his rule.\nThis is the dark sovereign in his single day of power,\nextorting the wealth of the world,\npoisoning the four seas,\nexhausting the people’s livelihoods,\nindulging his eyes and ears in pleasure—\nlike the Second Emperor of Qin, whose use of power led only to folly.\n\nThe *Laozi* says:\nWithout simplicity, one cannot clarify virtue/power;\nwithout tranquility, one cannot attain the distant;\nwithout magnanimity, one cannot embrace and cover all;\nwithout fairness, one cannot make decisive judgments.\nTo see with the eyes of all under heaven,\nto hear with the ears of all under heaven,\nto deliberate with the hearts of all under heaven,\nto contend with the strength of all under heaven—\nthus, his commands reach their full extent,\nand the sentiments of his ministers ascend to his ears.\nOfficials diligently perform their duties,\nwhile ministers gather like spokes to the hub.\nHe does not reward for joy,\nnor punish for anger.\nHis laws are discerning yet not harsh;\nhis senses are keen yet not obscured.\nThe truth and falsehood of matters are laid bare before him daily,\nand he does not resist them.\nThus, the wise exhaust their intelligence,\nthe unworthy strain their strength,\nthe near feel secure in their nature,\nthe distant cherish his virtue/power—\nthis is the **Dao/Way** of employing people.\nSuch is how the enlightened sovereign governs his state,\nand how he employs his people—\nlike the Han’s Emperor Gaozu or the Tang’s Emperor Taizong.\n\nHe who rides in the imperial carriage and on fine horses\ntravels a thousand *li* without labor;\nhe who sails on ships and steers oars\ncrosses rivers and seas without swimming.\nIf one’s words are true, though he be a merchant or a humble laborer,\nhe should not be discarded;\nif one’s words are false, though he be a sovereign, minister, or high official,\nhe should not be employed.\nThe judgment of truth and falsehood\ncannot be decided by rank or status.\nIf one’s plans are useful, he need not be ashamed of his station;\nif one’s words are practical, he need not be prized for his eloquence.\nWhen employing people in accord with the **Dao/Way**,\none achieves results without effort,\nand reaches understanding without action.\nThus, the Yellow Emperor was moved by the words of a shepherd boy\nand brought order to all under heaven—\nwas he truly of low and weak status?\nHu Hai trusted the schemes of Zhao Gao\nand lost all under heaven—\nwas Zhao Gao truly of noble rank?\nThe dark sovereign is not thus:\nFew ministers offer sincere loyalty,\nfor he does not employ their talents.\nHe favors those close and familiar with deceit,\nso the wise cannot be seen;\nhe spurns those distant, humble, and lowly,\nso those who strain their strength and offer loyal counsel cannot be heard.\nIf one speaks, he exhausts them with words;\nif one remonstrates, he executes them with charges.\n\n「Thus yet seeking to bring peace to all under heaven,\nto preserve the myriad lands,\nhis distance from wisdom and sagacity is already vast.\n\nWithout **saintly** virtue, one cannot still the four seas;\nwithout **sagacity**, one cannot bring peace to the myriad lands.\n\n**Laozi** said:\n*\"He who can honor life,\nthough rich and noble does not harm his body with sustenance,\nthough poor and humble does not burden his form with gain.\nThough he spends ten thousand gold daily,\nhe does not indulge his mouth to harm life;\nthough his home lacks even a single grain,\nhe does not begrudgingly seek to injure **virtue/power**.\nThis may be called honoring life indeed.*\n\nNow, receiving the hereditary noble rank of one’s ancestors,\none must surely place great weight on not losing it—\nyet life’s origin has endured for ages,\nand to lightly risk losing it, is this not perplexing?\n\nTo govern the world with noble rank is to entrust it with the world;\nto govern the world with love is to rely upon it with the world.\n\nThose who inherit the legacy of their ancestors yet lose it,\nmust surely do so through careless neglect.\n\nThus, if one does not blame oneself,\nthere is no way to entrust the world with oneself.\n\n**Wenzzi** asked about the foundation of ruling a state,\nand **Laozi** replied:\n*\"The foundation lies in governing oneself.\nNever have I heard of a state in disorder while the self is governed,\nnor has there ever been a state in order while the self is disordered.\nHence it is said:\nRefine oneself, and one’s **virtue/power** shall be true.\nIf one’s self is not yet governed, how much less the state?\"*\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is so supremely wondrous,\nthat a father cannot teach it to his son,\nnor can a son receive it from his father.\nThus, the **Dao/Way** that can be spoken of is not the constant **Dao/Way**;\nthe name that can be named is not the constant name.\nThe constant **Dao/Way** has no name—\nwhat can be named is not the **Dao/Way**.\nHence, what words and discourse cannot encompass,\nfathers and sons cannot pass it on.\n\n**Wenzzi** asked:\n*\"What conduct ensures the people love their ruler?\"*\n**Laozi** replied:\n*\"Lead them with proper timing,\nand treat them with reverence and caution,\nas though standing at the edge of a deep abyss,\nor walking on thin ice.\nBetween heaven and earth,\nthe good become my nurtured subjects,\nthe unworthy become my **enemies**.\nIn ancient times, the ministers of Xia and Shang,\navenged the wrongs of Jie and Zhou\nand served as subjects to Tang and Wu.\nThe people of Huosha,\nattacked their own lord\nand joined the followers of **Shennong**.*\n\nHence it is said:\n*\"What the people fear,\none must not fail to fear.\nWhat is truly fearsome is not the ruler,\nwhat is truly fearsome is not mere goodness.\"*\n\n**Laozi** said:\n*\"To govern the great,\nthe **Dao/Way** cannot be trifling;\nto rule vast lands,\nthe measures cannot be narrow;\nto occupy high station,\nthe duties cannot be burdensome;\nto lead many people,\nthe teachings cannot be harsh.\nBurdensome duties are hard to govern,\nharsh laws are hard to implement,\ndemands that are excessive are hard to satisfy.\nMeasure an inch with a ruler,\nand by a yard it will surely be off;\nweigh a **qian** with a balance,\nand by a **dan** it will surely be excessive.\nYet weigh with a balance and measure with a ruler,\nand even by a **dan** or a yard,\nthe errors will be few.\nIt is easy to be wise in broad strokes,\nbut subtle reasoning is hard to make sagacious.\nThe **Dao/Way** lies hidden in small things yet achieves greatness,\nwords lie hidden in simplicity yet reveal superficiality.\nThus, what does not benefit governance\nbut instead harms it,\nthe **saintly** does not practice;\nwhat does not benefit utility\nbut instead wastes it,\nthe wise do not employ.\n\nHence, deeds are not to be scorned for being too restrained,\ntasks are not to be scorned for being too few,\ndemands are not to be scorned for being too sparse.\nRestrained deeds are easy to accomplish,\nfew tasks are easy to govern,\nsparse demands are easy to satisfy,\nand entrusting matters to the people makes it easy.\nThus, petty reasoning harms **righteousness**,\npetty **righteousness** breaks the **Dao/Way**,\nand the **Dao/Way** must be simple to be comprehensive.\nThe **saintly** are comprehensive in wisdom,\nperceiving what has not yet come to pass,\nnot allowing small things to obscure the great,\nnor burdensome matters to replace simplicity.\n\nThe river flows far because of its winding course,\nnot because it is a single ladle of water.\nThe mountain rises high because of its gradual ascent,\nnot because it is a single handful of soil.\nThe **Dao/Way** transforms because of its ease and flow,\nnot because of what is achieved in an instant.\n\nHe who excels in one skill,\nis meticulous in one matter,\nand discerning in one ability,\ncan employ clever arguments,\nbut cannot broadly apply them.\n\nThe tuner of music,\ntightens the small strings,\nand loosens the large ones;\nthe establisher of affairs,\nmakes the lowly labor,\nand lets the noble rest.\nWords say:\n*\"Balance the strings, fit the large and small—\nin governing a state, noble and lowly alike must be justly treated.\"*\n\nThe words of the **Dao/Way** say:\n*\"Vague and indistinct,\nalign with heaven’s might,\nand harmonize with heaven’s **qi**.\nHe who harmonizes with **qi** becomes **Emperor**,\nhe who harmonizes with **righteousness** becomes **King**,\nhe who harmonizes with deeds becomes **Hegemon**.\nHe who lacks all three perishes.\nHe who harmonizes with **qi** is without **virtue/power** yet is called so;\nhe who harmonizes with **righteousness** rescues the peril of the age;\nhe who harmonizes with deeds shares benefits with the people.\nWithout one of these three,\nthe peril of ruin is inevitable.\nHence, one does not speak yet is believed,\ndoes not act yet is benevolent,\ndoes not rage yet is awe-inspiring—\nthus, the **heavenly heart** moves and transforms.\n\nThe Five **Emperors** acted naturally without effort,\nharmonizing with heaven’s will.\nAll things received their life from them,\nand responded in transformation.\n\nTo act yet be benevolent,\nto speak yet be trustworthy,\nto rage yet be awe-inspiring—\nthis is what is achieved through **sincerity** and **inner power**.\n\nThe Three **Kings**’ **sincerity** and **inner power** emanated from within,\nresponding outwardly in action,\nyet still left traces,\nnot yet fully harmonized with the **heartless**.\n\nTo act yet lack benevolence,\nto speak yet lack trustworthiness,\nto rage yet lack awe—\nthis is what is achieved through mere outward appearance.\n\nThe Five **Hegemons**’ **sincerity** did not arise from the heart,\nand thus nothing responded to them.\nHence, though they raged, they were not awe-inspiring.\n\nThus, with the **Dao/Way** to guide them,\neven few laws suffice for governance;\nwithout the **Dao/Way** to guide them,\neven many laws suffice only for chaos.\nGovernance depends on the **Dao/Way** being essential,\nchaos depends on laws being excessive.\n\n**Laozi** said:\n*\"A whalefish out of water is controlled by ants;\na ruler who abandons his **Dao/Way**\nand disputes matters with his ministers,\nis controlled by his officials.\nFish cannot be out of water,\nnor can a ruler abandon the **Dao/Way**.\nTo uphold one’s station with **non-action**,\nthose who guard their duties take refuge in obedience,\nwhile ministers conceal their wisdom and do not act—\ninstead, they allow their superiors to monopolize affairs.\nA ruler who does not entrust capable ministers\nbut prefers to act himself,\nshall find his wisdom daily constrained\nwhile he bears the blame alone.\nIf justice is exhausted below,\nhe cannot extend proper governance;\nif his conduct falters in his station,\nhe cannot maintain authority.\nIf wisdom is insufficient for governance,\nand awe is insufficient to enforce punishment,\nthen there is no way to interact with his subjects.\n\nIf joy and anger manifest in the heart,\nand desires appear outwardly,\nthen those who guard their duties\nshall abandon principle to curry favor,\nand officials shall pervert the law to follow the wind.\nIf rewards do not match deeds,\nand punishments do not fit crimes,\nthen ruler and subjects shall be at odds,\nand sovereign and ministers shall harbor mutual resentment.»\n\nThe myriad officials grow chaotic, yet wisdom cannot disentangle them;\nPraise does not arise, yet sagacity cannot illuminate it.\nNot one’s own fault, yet he blames himself alone—\nThen the sovereign’s labors increase, while ministers grow more negligent.\n\nThis is like the artisan who carves in place of the master.\nHe who carves in place of the master,\nRarely fails to harm his own hands.\n\nWhen the sovereign entrusts the worthy and selects the capable,\nAnd does not monopolize decisions for himself,\nThen wisdom has its source, and sagacity need not always shine—\nThe guardians of duty shall not flatter above,\nAnd the ministers shall uphold the law.\nYet still the innocent are slain,\nAnd those with merit are not rewarded—\nThe sovereign’s labors increase, while ministers grow more negligent.\n\nThis is like the artisan who carves in place of the master,\nAnd sits, harming his own hands.\n\nTo chase horses with their swiftness,\nOne’s sinews shall snap and fail to keep up—\nTo seize the reins from the chariot,\nThe horse shall die beneath the yoke.\n\nThe **Bólé** discerns them, the **Wángliáng** drives them,\nA wise sovereign rides them—\nWithout the effort of discernment or driving,\nYet reaches a thousand *lǐ*—\nThis is the art of leveraging others’ strengths.\n\nThe sovereign, seated above, governs the multitude below;\nHis trust lies in loyalty and rectitude,\nNot in outward form or inner spirit.\nAs with riding a horse,\nHe relies on the **shì** [discerning official] and the **yù** [driver],\nAchieving a thousand *lǐ* without exertion—\nThis is no hardship.\n\nThe **Way** of the sovereign:\nTo act without attachment, to establish without preference.\nTo act is to debate,\nTo prefer is to flatter—\nDebate invites usurpation,\nFlattery invites corruption.\nCorrupting his private inclinations,\nUsurping his rightful governance—\nHe who submits to others’ control,\nCannot sustain the realm.\n\nThus, the master of governance does not pluck [at will];\nThis is because governance is formless.\nOnly those who embody **shénhuà** [transformation of the spirit],\nNo force can overcome.\n\nThe sovereign who governs,\nEver controls others—\nNever controlled by others—\nThis is the master of governance who does not pluck [at will].\nTo use without visible form,\nHence the term **shénhuà**.\n\nWhen inner desires do not manifest,\nThis is called **\"jīng\"** [restraining];\nWhen outer evils do not enter,\nThis is called **\"bì\"** [closing].\nTo restrain within and close without,\nWhat matter cannot be moderated?\nTo close without and restrain within,\nWhat task cannot be accomplished?\nTo restrain within and close without,\nThere are no desires, no harms.\n\nThus, he does not act for them,\nNor does he act against them—\nYet they act for him,\nAnd he acts through them.\nWords that are not refuted,\nDeeds that are not thwarted—\nFollowing names to assess reality,\nLetting each minister bear responsibility—\nTo regard ignorance as the **Way**,\nTo forbid cruelty as the sovereign’s principle—\nThen the myriad officials’ affairs,\nEach shall find their proper measure.\n\nThe sovereign preserves the grand framework,\nEntrusts it to the myriad officials,\nExamines their deliberations,\nAnd determines their merits and faults—\nThat is all.\n\n**Lǎozǐ** said:\n*\"The nourished are the people’s foundation;\nThe people are the realm’s base.\nThus the sovereign,\nAbove, follows the **Dao** of Heaven and its seasons,\nBelow, exhausts the logic of Earth,\nWithin, employs the strength of the people.\nHence the myriad creatures thrive—\nGrowth and abundance flourish.\nSpring, he prunes the withered;\nSummer, he harvests the fruits;\nAutumn, he stores the vegetables and grains;\nWinter, he gathers firewood and salt.\nAs the people’s resources,\nThey lack nothing in life,\nAnd in death, no orphaned descendants mourn.\nThe corpse of the sovereign can preserve harmony,\nLife and death are both in order.\"*\n\nThe **Way** of the ancient kings:\nDoes not net the multitude while seeking the **máo** [wild boar],\nNor flood the marshes while hunting fish.\nDoes not net the multitude while seeking the **máo** [wild boar],\nNor flood the marshes while hunting fish.\nDoes not exhaust the creatures.\n\nThe **yáo** [wolf] has not yet been sacrificed,\nYet the **zhì** [noose] resounds with empty sounds—\nIt cannot reach the wilds;\nThe **tǎ** [otter] has not yet been sacrificed,\nYet the nets do not enter the waters—\nThe **yīng** [eagle] and **sǔn** [hawk] have not yet struck,\nYet the snares are not spread upon the **gāo** [highlands];\nThe grasses and trees have not yet fallen,\nYet the axes and blades do not enter the forests—\nThe insects have not yet been roasted,\nNor the pregnant slain—\nThe **zhèn** [nest] is not yet explored,\nThe fish not yet grown to a *chǐ* [foot] in length are taken,\nNor the dogs and swine allowed to starve—\nThe year’s harvest is not yet ripe.\n\nAll follow their proper time,\nAnd do not recklessly harm.\n\nThus, the myriad creatures’ births,\nLike the **zhēng** [breath] of **yīn-yáng** [yin-yang],\nAre said to rise when their **jīng-qì** [vital essence] is slain,\nAnd their **dào** [proper measure] is taken—\nThen the myriad creatures’ vital essence and **qì** surge upward,\nReaching the heavens,\nAnd shall bring harm to mankind.\n\nThis is the **Way** of the ancient kings\nTo respond to the seasons in preparation,\nTo enrich the realm and benefit the people.\n\nTo nourish with propriety,\nTo take in due measure—\nNot to disrupt their **Way**—\nThis is how the realm is enriched,\nAnd the family preserved.\n\nIt is not a matter of what the eyes see\nAnd the feet can reach—\nIf he desires to benefit the people,\nAnd does not harbor resentment in his heart,\nThen the people shall naturally provide.\n\nTo measure things by the heart,\nTo observe others by the body—\nWhat need to raise brows or move feet,\nBefore all is complete?\n\n**Lǎozǐ** said:\n*\"The ancient sovereigns,\nWhen taking from below, had moderation;\nWhen nourishing themselves, had restraint.\nThey calculated the year’s harvest,\nMeasured the people’s stored wealth,\nKnew the surplus and the deficit—\nThen they took and offered.\nThus they received what Heaven and Earth bestowed,\nAnd avoided the perils of hunger and cold.\nTheir grief for the people was profound—\nWhen the realm had famine,\nTheir food lacked savor;\nWhen the people were cold,\nTheir winter cloaks were not fur-lined—\nSharing the people’s joys and sorrows,\nThus the world had no grieving subjects—\nThis was the ancient sovereign’s governance of the realm.\"*\n\nThe **dark sovereign** is not so.\nWhen taking from the people,\nHe does not limit their strength;\nWhen demanding from below,\nHe does not measure their stores—\nMen and women cannot till and weave\nTo meet his endless demands.\nTheir labor is exhausted, their wealth depleted—\nThey have no dawn without dusk,\nAnd sovereign and ministers alike grow weary.\n\nMoreover, when a man plows,\nOne *zhǐ* [fathom] of grain does not benefit ten *mǔ* [mu] of land—\nThe yield of average fields,\nDoes not exceed four *dàn* [bushels].\nHis aged wife, children, and infirm dependents,\nRely on him for sustenance.\nIf calamity or disaster strikes,\nThey cannot meet the sovereign’s demands.\nThen the sovereign pities them—\nBut the greedy tyrant,\nDraining the people like a fisherman in drought,\nTo satisfy his insatiable desires—\nThen the common folk do not enjoy Heaven’s harmony,\nNor walk upon Earth’s **virtue** [de].\n\nThis is the **dark sovereign’s** governance of the realm.\n\n**Lǎozǐ** said:\n*\"The **qì** of Heaven and Earth,\nNone greater than **harmony**.\n**Harmony** is the balance of **yīn-yáng** [yin-yang],\nThe division of day and night.\nThus, when spring arrives, all things are born,\nWhen autumn comes, all things mature—\nBirth and maturity must draw from **harmony’s** essence.\nHence, accumulated **yīn** does not give life,\nAccumulated **yáng** does not transform—\nOnly when **yīn-yáng** intermingle,\nDoes **harmony** arise.\"*\n\nThis is the **harmony** of Heaven and Earth’s **qì**,\nThus all things attain birth and maturity.\n\nTherefore, the **Dao** of the Sage\nIs broad yet cautious,\nStern yet warm,\nSoft yet upright,\nFierce yet benevolent.\n\nExcessive rigidity breaks,\nExcessive softness curls inward—\nThe **Dao** lies between **just** and **yielding**.\n\nLike a measuring line,\nIt can be rolled and held,\nStretched and laid straight—\nLong yet not sprawling,\nShort yet not confined,\nStraight yet not rigid—\nThus the Sage embodies it.\n\nThis is the Sage’s **harmony**.\n\nSoft yet able to stand firm—\nThe carpenter’s square and compass.\nCoiled yet able to unfold—\nThe Sage’s laws and measures.\n\nPush benevolence too far, it becomes weakness—\nWeakness lacks authority.\nPush sternness too far, it becomes brutality—\nBrutality lacks **harmony**.\nPush love too far, it becomes indulgence—\nIndulgence lacks order.\nPush punishment too far, it becomes calamity—\nCalamity breeds estrangement.\nThus, **harmony** is most valued.\n\n**Lǎozǐ** said:\n*\"A realm endures by attaining the **Dao**;\nIt perishes by obstruction of principle.\nThus the Sage observes transformations to discern their omens.\n**Virtue** waxes or wanes—\nThe winds first stir its signs.\nThose who grasp the **Dao** of life,\nThough small, shall grow great;\nThose who bear signs of ruin,\nThough established, shall fall.\nA realm’s ruin does not lie in vastness;\nThe **Dao**’s practice cannot be slighted.\nThus survival lies in attaining the **Dao**,\nNot in size;\nRuination lies in losing the **Dao**,\nNot in grandeur.\nRulers of chaotic realms\nSeek only broad lands,\nYet neglect **virtue** and **righteousness**;\nStrive for high stations,\nYet neglect **Dao** and **moral power**.\nThey abandon what sustains them,\nAnd court their own destruction.\n\nThe wise observe the wise and foolish\nTo judge the rise and fall of states—\n**Virtue** and **moral power** endure,\nNot in their scale, but in their depth.\nIf the sovereign above disrupts the **Three Lights**’ radiance,\nAnd loses the people’s hearts below—\nWho cannot fail to crumble?\n\nThus those who scrutinize themselves\nNeed not fear others.\n\nIn ancient times,\nDeep practice was called **Dao** and **virtue**,\nShallow practice, **righteousness** and **benevolence**,\nThin practice, **rites** and **wisdom**.\nThese six are the state’s vital threads.\nDeep practice brings thick blessings;\nShallow practice, thin blessings;\nFull practice—all under Heaven submits.\nIn antiquity,\nCultivating **Dao** and **virtue** rectified all under Heaven,\nCultivating **righteousness** and **benevolence** rectified a realm,\nCultivating **rites** and **wisdom** rectified a village.\nThick **virtue** brings greatness,\nThin **virtue** brings smallness—\nThus the **Dao** does not rely on martial prowess,\nNor on strength or greed to prevail,\nNor on competition to gain.\nTo stand in all under Heaven is to push oneself outward,\nTo prevail is to let all under Heaven submit of its own accord,\nTo gain is to give to all under Heaven—\nNot to seize for oneself.\nThus the yielding attains firmness,\nThe weak attain victory,\n**Righteousness** and **benevolence** attain success,\nThe non-contentious cannot be contended with.\nThus the **Dao** in all under Heaven\nIs like the great rivers and seas.\n\nHeaven’s **Dao**:\nThose who act against it perish,\nThose who grasp it lose it.\nTo covet great fame while striving for it—\nI see it as inevitable failure.\nYet even if grasped, it does not remain.\nGreat fame cannot be seized—\nIt is given by all under Heaven.\nTo give is to receive.\nAll under Heaven’s allegiance is to **virtue**.\nThus it is said:\nThe **virtue** of the highest **Dao** draws all under Heaven,\nThe **benevolence** of the highest **Dao** draws all within the seas,\nThe **righteousness** of the highest **Dao** draws a realm,\nThe **rites** of the highest **Dao** draw a village.\nWithout these four, the people will not submit.\nIf they do not submit, arms are used—\nThis is the perilous **Dao**.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Weapons are the most ominous tools.\nUsed only when unavoidable,\nVictory brings no joy in slaughter.\nThus it is said:\nIn the land of death, thorns and brambles grow—\nMournful weeping fills the air,\nFuneral rites mark the dwellings.\nTherefore the **Junzi** prioritizes **Dao** and **virtue**,\nAnd rarely resorts to arms.\nPractice varies in depth,\n**Virtue** in thickness—\n**Dao** and **virtue** cannot be momentarily abandoned,\nWarlike tools should not be recklessly wielded.\"*\n\n**Wénzǐ** asked:\n*\"Why are **righteousness**, **benevolence**, and **rites** inferior to **Dao** and **virtue**?\"*\n\n**Lǎozǐ** said:\n*\"Those who practice **benevolence** must weigh it by sorrow and joy;\nThose who practice **righteousness** must clarify giving and taking.\nWithin the Four Seas, sorrow and joy cannot reach all,\nAnd exhausting the treasury’s wealth cannot suffice for the people.\nThus kindness cannot be universal.\nTherefore, it is better to cultivate the **Dao** and practice **virtue**,\nAligning with Heaven and Earth’s nature—\nAll things then self-regulate,\nAnd all under Heaven is nourished,\nWhile **righteousness** and **benevolence** follow naturally.\n\nThus the **true man** dwells in the thick,\nNot the thin.\nKnowing the **Dao**’s **virtue** is profound while **righteousness** is shallow,\nThe Sage abides in the thick,\nNot the thin.\n\n**Rites** are the adornment of substance;\n**Benevolence** is the manifestation of kindness.\nThus **rites** follow human nature without excess,\n**Benevolence** does not overflow kindness—\nMourning the dead aligns with **benevolence**,\nFuneral rites fulfill **rites**.\nNurturing life does not force what cannot be borne,\nNor sever what cannot be abandoned—\nMeasure and moderation never stray from balance,\nAnd unearned praise finds no root.\n\nThus music suffices to unite joy,\nYet never strays from **harmony**,\nClarifying the division of life and death,\nAnd the balance of extravagance and frugality.\nWhen human nature loses **harmony**,\n**Righteousness** and **benevolence** arise,\nRegulated by **rites** and music,\nEach made clear in their place without overstepping.\n\nIn the later ages, it is not so—\nWords and deeds contradict,\nEmotions and appearances clash,\n**Rites** become burdensome adornments,\nMusic turns to licentious chaos,\nCustoms drown in worldly excess,\nPraise and blame converge in court,\nThus the **true man** is abandoned and unused.\n\nThe later age is marked by:\nMusic’s licentiousness,\n**Rites**’ corruption,\n**Rites** becoming burdensome,\nEmotions masked in pretense—\nWhen the **true man** sees this,\nHe embraces simplicity,\nTransforming customs.\nIf he races with the swift horse on foot,\nMan cannot outpace the horse;\nBut mounted in a chariot,\nThe horse cannot outpace man.\"*\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is well-used when:\n\nOne rides upon the people’s strengths to achieve great deeds,\nLeveraging what they can do to overcome what they cannot.\n\nWhen the ruler gives them favorable timing,\nThe people repay him with wealth;\nWhen the ruler treats them with **rites**,\nThe people repay him with death.\n\nThus, there are states in peril yet no secure ruler;\nThere are rulers in sorrow yet no contented ministers.\n\nIf **virtue/power** exceeds one’s station,\nHe is honored;\nIf **reward/luck** exceeds one’s **virtue/power**,\nHe is doomed.\n\n**Virtue/power** is valued without limit,\n**Righteousness** is sought without excess.\nTo hold **virtue/power** yet not be honored is to usurp one’s place;\nTo take **righteousness** yet not earn it is to steal wealth.\n\nTo be honored without **virtue/power** is doomed,\nTo take without **righteousness** is theft.\n\nThe **sage** finds contentment in poverty and joy in the **Dao/Way**,\nDoes not let desire harm life,\nDoes not let profit burden himself—\nThus he does not violate **righteousness** nor presumptuously seize what belongs to others.*\n\nWithout **virtue/power**, he is not honored;\nWithout ability, he is not appointed;\nWithout merit, he is not rewarded;\nWithout guilt, he is not punished.\n\nIn advancing men, he relies on **rites**;\nIn dismissing men, he relies on **righteousness**.\n\nIn the age of the petty man,\nTo advance him is like ascending to heaven;\nTo dismiss him is like descending into the abyss.\nThe **sage** in using men does not lightly advance nor easily dismiss;\nThe petty man fears advancement may not be lofty enough,\nRegrets dismissal may not be deep enough.\n\nTo speak of the ancient is to criticize the present.\nThe present age is shallow and deceitful—\nHe loves those he wishes to live,\nHates those he wishes to die.\n\nIn judging horses, he errs by favoring the fat;\nIn selecting ministers, he errs by favoring the wealthy.\nA plump pig fills the kitchen,\nA gaunt one is heard in the temple.\nThus, the unworthy are appointed.\n\nThough a horse be lean, if it is of fine breed,\nIt can still travel far;\nThough a minister be poor, if he is loyal,\nHe can still accomplish great deeds.\n\nThe **noble man** discerns reality,\nAnd does not trust slanderous words.\nIf a minister does not remonstrate when the ruler errs,\nHe is not a loyal servant;\nIf the ruler does not heed remonstrance,\nHe is not enlightened.\n\nThe one who does not remonstrate is called a **living corpse** (taking salary without duty),\nThe one who does not heed is a **tyrannical ruler**.\n\nIf the people sink in dissipation yet the ruler feels no concern,\nHe is not an **accomplished ruler**.\nThus, to uphold **rites** and die in hardship is the duty of a minister;\nTo endure cold and hunger is the kindness of a **benevolent father**.\n\nIf a ruler is thus, why fear the peril of the state?\nIf a minister is thus, why fear the lack of rank and reward?\n\nTo serve the great with the small is called **perverting** (changing nature);\nTo offend the great with the small is called **defying the Dao/Way**—\nThough one may ascend to heaven beforehand,\nHe will surely plunge into the abyss thereafter.\n\nThus, in the village, elders are honored by seniority,\nAnd the aged and destitute are never abandoned;\nIn court, rank determines precedence,\nWith distinctions between high and low.\n\nTherefore, when the old and young uphold their proper **rites**,\nCalamities have no cause to arise.\n\nThe exalted are honored because they are near the ruler;\nThe aged are revered because they are near kin;\nThe elders are respected because they are near brothers.\nThus, one honors the noble through the ruler,\nRespects the aged through kinship,\nAnd reveres the elder through **rites**.\n\nThose born noble grow arrogant,\nThose born rich grow extravagant.\nThus, few who are rich and noble,\nWithout the **Dao/Way** to reflect upon,\nCan avoid wrongdoing.\n\nNobility without humility invites arrogance,\nWealth without restraint invites extravagance.\nTo dwell in nobility yet fail to uphold **virtue/power**,\nAnd not commit wrongdoing—how rare!\n\nTo study without surfeit is the way to cultivate oneself;\nTo teach without weariness is the way to govern the people.\nWith wise mentors and virtuous friends,\nFew would abandon **rites** and still not err.\n\nTo observe learning is to know the **Dao/Way**,\nTo receive instruction is to embrace all without distinction—\nEntering a garden of orchids and immortals,\nOne must surely inhale their fragrant **qi**.\n\nTo recognize the worthy is **wisdom**,\nTo love the worthy is **benevolence**,\nTo honor **benevolence** is **righteousness**,\nTo revere the worthy is **rites**,\nTo delight in the worthy is **music**.\n\nThe ancients who governed the world well\nDid nothing yet accomplished all—\nNot creating affairs for the people,\nThus called **non-action**,\nYet following what benefits the people,\nThus nothing was left undone.\n\nTherefore, governing the world requires **tolerance**—\nTo obtain this **tolerance** is to achieve **non-action** yet fulfill all;\nTo fail in this **tolerance** is to act and invite disaster.\n\nThe **tolerance** of governing the world is thus:\n**Cautious**, as if crossing a great river in winter;\n**Wary**, as if fearing injury from all sides;\n**Dignified**, as if maintaining **rites**;\n**Dissolved**, as if ice melting;\n**Sincere**, as if uncarved wood;\n**Mingled**, as if turbid water;\n**Vast**, as if a valley.\n\nThis is the **tolerance** of governing the world.\n**Tolerance** means encompassing all.\n\nThe **Dao/Way**’s appearance is thus:\nThe ruler governs with diligence, never slacking.\n\n---\n**Explanations of the above:**\n\n**Cautious**, as if crossing a great river in winter—\nNot daring to act rashly;\n\n**Wary**, as if fearing injury from all sides—\nFearful of harm on every front;\n\n**Dignified**, as if maintaining **rites**—\nHumility, respect, and deference;\n\n**Dissolved**, as if ice melting—\nNot daring to hoard;\n\n**Sincere**, as if uncarved wood—\nNot daring to be artificially perfected;\n\n**Mingled**, as if turbid water—\nNot daring to seek clarity alone;\n\n**Vast**, as if a valley—\nNot daring to be full to overflowing.\n\nTo advance without daring to act,\nTo retreat without daring to lead—\nTo fear self-harm,\nTo cling to gentleness and not presume strength—\nTo humble oneself and honor others—\nTo diminish oneself and thus truly endure—\nTo be deficient and thus remain whole—\nTo endure filth and humiliation yet remain fresh—\nTo see insufficiency and thus not claim superiority.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** retreats yet leads,\nClings to weakness yet prevails,\nHumbles itself yet rises above others,\nDiminishes itself yet stands firm,\nLacks yet remains complete,\nEndures filth yet remains pure,\nSees insufficiency yet is worthy.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** does nothing yet accomplishes all.\n\nThese are the inversions of the **Dao/Way**.\nTo place oneself last is to be first for others,\nTo diminish oneself is to gain from others.\n\nThus, the world reveres it without burden,\nAnd the people willingly follow without exhaustion.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of clarity—Laozi says:\n\nAll who study the **Dao/Way**,\nIf they can discern the distinction between Heaven and humanity,\nAnd grasp the root of order and chaos,\nIf they purify the heart and clarify the mind to preserve it,\nAnd observe its beginning and end,\nReturning to the emptiness and stillness—\nThen they may be said to have attained it.\n\nOnly those who embody purity,\nAnd clearly return to emptiness and tranquility,\nCan truly discern the distinction between Heaven and humanity,\nAnd fathom the origins of all confusion.\n\nThe root of governance is **virtue/power** and righteousness;\nIts branches are laws and statutes.\nWhat gives birth to humanity is the root;\nWhat does not is the branch.\nRoot and branch are one in essence,\nYet their dual nature is love and desire.\n\nPrioritizing root over branch—this is the **君子** (junzi/noble one);\nPrioritizing branch over root—this is the **小人** (xiao ren/commoner).\n\nIn the birth of humanity,\nSpirit is the root,\nForm is the branch.\nThus, in the **太上** (Great Sage) era, nurturing of spirit prevails,\nAnd emotions and inclinations are regulated;\nIn the **末世** (Later Age), form is cherished,\nAnd appetites and desires run wild.\nRegulating desire clarifies the spirit,\nIndulging desire harms the body.\n\nWhen the spirit is clear and the body harmonious,\nRoot and branch mutually support,\nThen one preserves the whole body and safeguards the spirit,\nWithout diminishing its true essence.\nAll methods of cultivation and discipline vary,\nAnd inherent capacities differ—\nThus arise the distinctions between noble and common.\n\nWhen laws arise,\nThey serve to aid **virtue/power** and righteousness;\nIf laws are exalted and **virtue/power** abandoned,\nThis is like valuing one’s cap and shoes\nWhile neglecting one’s head and feet.\n\nIn governing a state,\nOne must first establish **virtue/power** and righteousness,\nThen laws and decrees to bring order.\nIf laws and decrees are emphasized,\nAnd **virtue/power** and righteousness neglected,\nThis is like neglecting one’s head and feet\nWhile valuing one’s cap and shoes.\n\n**Virtue/power** and righteousness are broad and profound.\nTo increase their height without broadening their foundation—this is ruin;\nTo extend their reach without deepening their root—this is destruction.\n\nThus, without great beams,\nOne cannot bear heavy burdens;\nTo bear burdens, none surpass **楝** (yuán, a strong tree);\nTo govern a state, none surpass **德** (virtue).\n\nThe ruler’s people are like the foundation of a city,\nOr the roots of a tree.\nDeep roots mean a firm foundation,\nA thick base means a secure height.\nFoundation and roots are like **德** (virtue) and the **Dao/Way**.\n\nWhen a foundation is deep and broad,\nYet it is destroyed—this has never occurred.\nWhen the **Dao/Way** is high and **德** (virtue) flourishes,\nYet the people do not revere it—this has never been heard.\n\nThus, what is not rooted in **德** (virtue) and the **Dao/Way**\nCannot be called a true principle;\nWhat does not align with the ancient kings\nCannot be called the **Dao/Way**.\n\nIf one does not learn from antiquity,\nAnd does not follow the **Dao/Way**,\nThen it cannot be the law of the state.\nTo merely recite the methods of one deed or one merit,\nThis is not the universal **Dao/Way**.\nTo employ bizarre and deceptive techniques,\nThis is not the great **Dao/Way** of the world.\n\nLaozi says:\nThe **Dao/Way** of governing people\nIs like **造父** (Zào Fǔ, a legendary charioteer) guiding his four horses.\nIn the time of King **周穆王** (Zhōu Mù Wáng, King Mu of Zhou),\nZào Fǔ drove his horses.\nWith reins and bit in hand,\nHe aligned their movements with his own chest,\nGained their trust from within,\nAnd harmonized their wills from without.\nThus he could take the **Dao/Way** and travel far,\nWith energy and strength to spare.\nAdvancing or retreating, turning or bending—\nAll went as he intended.\nTruly, he mastered the technique!\n\nNow, **权势** (authority and influence) are the ruler’s carriage;\nGreat ministers are the ruler’s four horses.\nThe body cannot abandon the carriage’s stability,\nThe hands cannot lose the horses’ hearts.\nThus, if the four horses are not attuned,\nZào Fǔ cannot guide them along the **Dao/Way**;\nIf ruler and ministers are not in harmony,\nEven the **圣人** (sage) cannot govern with them.\n\nTo grasp the **Dao/Way** and guide with it—\nEven mediocre talent can achieve this;\nTo clearly distinguish and demonstrate—\nEven the wicked can be restrained.\nThings come to completion while observing their changes,\nAffairs unfold while responding to their transformations.\nIf the near are not disordered,\nThen the far will naturally be governed.\nWithout employing contrived teachings,\nYet attaining the natural **Dao/Way**,\nAll actions will be without error.\n\nWith **造父**’s skill in guiding,\nOne need not fear the horses’ wild galloping;\nWith the **圣人**’s supreme governance,\nOne need not fear the people’s peril and ruin.\n\nLaozi says:\nAll who practice the **Dao/Way**,\nMust block the paths of evil and unseen forces,\nAnd prevent what has not yet occurred.\nThey value not their own self-righteousness,\nBut rather their inability to act wrongly.\nThus it is said:\nDo not allow what is desired to exist,\nOr there will be no day without strife;\nDo not allow what is to be taken to exist,\nOr there will be no day without contention.\nThus, when desires are released,\nThe public **Dao/Way** prevails.\n\nThose in excess are stopped by measure;\nThose in deficiency are urged by use.\nThus, the world can be governed by one.\n\nIf one abandons official duties\nAnd listens to praise and blame,\nIf one discards merit and labor\nAnd relies on factions and cliques,\nThen even with extraordinary talents,\nOne will not advance in office;\nWhile the people’s customs decay in the state,\nAnd ministers vie for power in court.\n\nThus, with the **Dao/Way** to guide people,\nOne is not guided by people;\nWithout the **Dao/Way**, one is constrained by people.\n**舜** (Shùn, a virtuous ruler) as a commoner\nWas revered by all under Heaven—\nBecause his **Dao/Way** endured,\nAnd thus he could guide others.\n**纣** (Zhòu, the tyrannical last king of Xia) as a ruler\nLost the loyalty of the four seas—\nBecause his **Dao/Way** perished,\nAnd thus he was constrained by others.\n\nLaozi says:\nIn governing a state, there are constants,\nYet benefiting the people is the root;\nIn governance and teaching, there is a **Dao/Way**,\nYet decrees and conduct follow antiquity.\nIf it benefits the people,\nIt need not strictly adhere to the old ways;\nIf it harmonizes with affairs,\nIt need not blindly follow custom.\n\nThus, the **圣人** adapts laws to the times,\nAnd rituals to the customs.\nClothing and tools,\nEach serve their purpose;\nLaws and decrees,\nEach suit their needs.\nThus, changing antiquity is not wrong,\nNor is following custom always commendable.\n\nWhat is valued in governance\nIs only fitting the times.\nIt is not a matter of frequent alteration.\n\nReading the books of ancient kings,\nIs not as good as hearing their words;\nHearing their words,\nIs not as good as understanding their intent.\nTo grasp their intent—\nTheir words cannot fully express it.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** that can be spoken of\nIs not the constant **Dao/Way**;\nThe name that can be named\nIs not the constant name.\nTo hold words as the **Dao/Way**,\nIs to hold words while not possessing the **Dao/Way**;\nTo cling to stone as jade,\nIs to cling to stone while not possessing jade.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** spoken of by the **圣人**\nIs like metal and stone—\nOnce refined, it cannot be altered.\nThe principles of sound and rhythm\nAre fixed and cannot be changed.\nGovernance is like the **琴瑟** (qin se, musical instruments);\nWhen the melody ends, the tuning shifts.\nSince the notes differ,\nThus it is fitting to change and adapt.\nLaws, statutes, rituals, and music\nAre the tools of governance,\nNot the governance itself.\n\nThus, those who are skilled in technique\nCannot be consulted on the ultimate **Dao/Way**,\nFor they are bound by doctrine and awaken only to the common.\n\nThe ascent to Mount Langfeng is not within the reach of ordinary means,\nNor can those skilled in technique grasp the ultimate **Dao/Way**.\n\nLaozi said: *\"How few are the fixed laws under Heaven!*\nWhen aligning with worldly affairs,\nAttaining human principles,\nConforming to Heaven and Earth,\nAnd scrutinizing spirits and gods,\nThen governance may be rightly established.\n\nTo act conveniently in affairs,\nTo conform to humanity,\nIs sufficient to govern the world.\nNaturally harmonizing with the divine—\nWhy should there be fixed laws at all?\n\nIn ancient times, the Three Sovereigns ruled without decrees, yet the people obeyed;\nThe Five Emperors established decrees but had no punishments.\nThe Xia ruler did not break his word,\nThe Yin people took oaths,\nThe Zhou people made alliances.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns were Fu Xi, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor.\nThe Five Emperors were Shaohao, Zhuantu, Gaoxin, Tang, and Yu.\nThe Three Kings were the Xia, Yu, Tang of Yin, and King Wen of Zhou.\n\nIn the distant past, without decrees the people obeyed;\nIn later times, harsh laws bred deceit.\nThus, *wuwei* transforms effortlessly,\nWhile forced action governs with difficulty.\nOaths and alliances, once broken, invite punishment.\n\nIn the decadent age, men endure filth yet scorn humiliation,\nHoard gain yet lack shame.\nThus, laws and statutes are crafted according to customs,\nAdjusting urgency and moderation.\nTools and implements adapt to the times,\nMade suitable for their purpose.\n\nThose bound by law cannot comprehend comprehensive governance;\nThose constrained by ritual cannot respond to change.\nOnly those with singular insight and acute hearing\nCan then wield the **Dao/Way** and act accordingly.\n\nThose bound by law and text move stiffly and stagnant;\nThose with singular perception and hearing\nDo not stray from the **Dao/Way**.\n\nTo know the origin of laws is to adapt with the times;\nTo ignore the source of governance, though obedient, leads only to chaos.\n\nNow, scholars cling to tradition,\nGrasp texts and hold fast to doctrine,\nHoping to govern thereby—\nAs if without this, governance is impossible—\nLike forcing a square peg into a round hole,\nSeeking suitability is difficult indeed.\n\nTo cling to law and text without flexibility,\nBelieving oneself to govern,\nIs like forcing a square into a circle—\nHow could it ever fit?\n\nTo preserve danger and govern chaos,\nRequires wisdom beyond the ordinary,\nYet the **Dao/Way** precedes antiquity—\nEven the foolish may grasp it.\n\nThus, laws untested the **圣人** does not employ;\nWords unverified the wise ruler does not heed.\nIf matters demand it, even the foolish must act;\nIf principles conflict, even the virtuous must abandon them.\n\nWenzi asked: *\"Where do laws derive their authority?\"*\nLaozi replied: *\"Laws arise from righteousness,\nRighteousness from what benefits the many.\nWhen benefits align with the people’s heart,\nThis is the essence of governance.\n\nLaws do not descend from Heaven,\nNor emerge from Earth—\nThey arise from humanity,\nReturning to self to be rectified.\nIf one attains their root,\nDisorder is averted before it begins.\nKnowing the essentials,\nOne is not confounded by doubt;\nIf it exists within oneself,\nOne does not criticize others;\nIf it does not exist within oneself,\nOne does not blame those who establish it.\n\nThose below must not neglect what is above;\nWhat is forbidden to the people must not be practiced by the ruler.\nThus, when the ruler establishes laws,\nFirst, they must govern themselves.\n\nIf restraint begins with the self,\nThen the people will be restrained.\nThe county’s laws—\nLaws that are not laws—\nAre laws that govern the laws.\nOnce laws are established,\nThose who conform are rewarded,\nThose who deviate are punished—\nEven the noble must not lightly receive reward,\nEven the lowly must not suffer excessive punishment.\n\nThose who violate the law,\nThough virtuous, must be punished;\nThose who conform,\nThough unworthy, are guiltless.\nThus, public virtue prevails while private desires are checked.\n\nIn ancient times, officials were appointed\nTo restrain the people,\nSo they might not act wantonly;\nThe ruler was established\nTo restrain officials,\nSo they might not act unilaterally.\nLaws and the **Dao/Way** restrain the ruler,\nSo he may not act arbitrarily.\n\nWhen none act wantonly,\nThen the **Dao/Way** prevails and principles are fulfilled.\nThus, return to simplicity and *wuwei*.\n\n*Wuwei* does not mean inaction—\nIt means action arising from the self.\n\nEstablish rulers with officials,\nSo the sovereign does not act wantonly,\nAnd the people do not act unilaterally.\nThus, the sovereign upholds proper conduct,\nAnd the people do not pervert the law.\nHow difficult is it to govern the world?\n\nLaozi said:\n*The skilled in rewards spend little yet inspire many;\nThe skilled in punishments reduce crime while deterring vice;\nThe skilled in encouraging virtue use minimal means yet cultivate **德** (virtue/power);\nThe skilled in taking resources gather much yet breed no resentment.\n\nThus, the **圣人** follows what the people naturally favor to encourage virtue,\nAnd what they naturally abhor to restrain vice.\nReward one, and the world rushes to emulate;\nPunish one, and the world fears to transgress.\nThus, the greatest rewards cost nothing,\nAnd the greatest punishments are never excessive.\nThe **圣人** governs with brevity yet achieves vast results—\nThis is what is meant.\n\nThis is how the **圣人** fulfills governance.\n\nLaozi said:\n*The **臣道** (subject’s path) is to speak truthfully when appropriate,\nTo lead in action,\nTo uphold duty and clarify distinctions,\nThus achieving success.\n\nThus, when ruler and subject follow distinct paths, governance is established;\nWhen they share the same path, chaos ensues.\nEach attaining their proper place,\nActing appropriately,\nThen above and below can govern one another.\n\nThus, branches must not exceed the trunk,\nNor ends surpass the root—\nSpeech and action must balance in weight and measure.\nWhen ruler and subject are clearly distinguished,\nThen great and small do not overstep.\n\nThose who wield authority hold little yet command much,\nStand in a small place yet influence broadly,\nAdhere strictly to principle yet govern extensively.\nA tree ten *zhang* in girth supports a thousand-*jin* house—\nThis is the power of leverage.\nA five-*cun* hinge controls the opening and closing—\nThis is the power of position.\n\nWhat the people must obey today,\nThose who conform prosper,\nThose who resist perish—\nNone dare disobey—\nThis is the power of conformity.\n\nIssuing decrees and enforcing prohibitions\nRelies on the multitude for authority.\n\nRighteousness is not about exhausting the world’s benefits for the people—\nIt is about benefiting one, and the world follows.\"\n\nThe tyrant does not exhaust harm upon the realm—\nHe harms one, and the world rebels.\nThus, every action and decision must be weighed with care.\n\nBe cautious in your actions and affections,\nGrant rewards without partiality,\nInflict punishments without bias.\n\nAs Laozi says:\n*\"Bend an inch to straighten a foot,\nA small crookedness yields great rectitude—\nThe sage acts thus.\"*\n\nYet rulers today judge their ministers\nNot by their grand achievements or broad conduct,\nBut by trifling virtues—\nThus losing the way to true merit.\n\nThus, when a man has great virtue,\nHis minor flaws are overlooked;\nWhen a man has great renown,\nHis small faults are forgotten.\n\nHuman nature is never without flaw—\nWhat matters is his grand purpose.\nThough he has small errors,\nThey should not be held against him.\n\nIf his grand purpose fails,\nHis common virtues are insignificant.\nTo speak of a man’s talents as flawless is folly—\nOne must not doubt his minor faults\nBut uphold his great use.\n\nCommon virtues and slanderous words\nAre not to be trusted.\nThus, the overly meticulous fail in great success,\nWhile those who scorn conduct are shunned by the multitude.\n\nThe grand in stature has loose restraints,\nThe vast in measure earns distant praise—\nThis is the way to judge ministers.\n\nIf one judges ministers thus,\nHe will not lose the right man.\n\nAs Laozi says:\n*\"From ancient times to now,\nNo one has ever been flawless in conduct.\"*\n\nThus, the noble does not demand perfection of one man.\nNo man is fully capable—\nMeasure his talents and assign him accordingly.\n\nSquare yet not rigid,\nSharp yet not jagged,\nStraight yet not reckless,\nBroad yet not vulgar—\nIn virtue, culture, and martial prowess,\nDo not demand perfection of others.\n\nCultivate oneself with the Dao,\nAnd do not demand of others—\nThis is easy to reward.\n\nCultivate oneself with the Dao,\nAnd there will be no regrets.\n\nTo cultivate oneself without demanding of others,\nYet act in the world—\nIs this not possible?\n\nThe jade of the Xia sovereigns cannot be without blemish,\nThe moon’s pearl cannot be without impurity—\nYet the world treasures them,\nNot letting minor flaws obscure their great beauty.\n\nNow, if one fixates on another’s shortcomings\nAnd forgets their strengths,\nYet seeks merit in the world—\nThis is difficult indeed.\n\nThe jade of the Xia sovereigns and the moon’s pearl\nStill have flaws—\nHow can the worthy and noble be entirely flawless?\n\nAbandon their flaws,\nTake their strengths—\nThen no talent will be wasted.\n\nThe common view sees only\nLowly station, humble birth,\nHumiliating tasks—\nYet fails to grasp their grand purpose.\n\nMost men despise what is lowly and shameful;\nThe noble judges men by their grand purpose.\n\nThus, the way to judge a man:\nWhen he rises, observe his actions—\nThis reveals his talent.\nWhen he is wealthy, observe his generosity—\nThis reveals his virtue in aiding others.\nWhen he is impoverished, observe his principles—\nHe does not act against righteousness.\nWhen he is lowly, observe his conduct—\nHe does not dwell where the Dao is absent.\nObserve his response to calamity—\nThis reveals his courage.\nIn adversity, true benevolence and bravery are seen.\nWhen he rejoices, observe his restraint—\nHe does not overstep.\nWhen entrusted with wealth, observe his benevolence—\nHe does not take what is not his.\nWhen threatened, observe his resolve—\nHe would sacrifice himself for righteousness.\n\nThus, one may discern human nature.\n\nIf one aspect is present, he is capable;\nIf all seven are complete, he is a hero of the age.\nBy this, the worthy and foolish may be known,\nAnd loyalty and sincerity revealed.\n\nAs Laozi says:\n*\"To bend is to seek straightening,\nTo be crooked is to seek rectitude.\nBend an inch to straighten a foot,\nA small crookedness yields great rectitude—\nThe noble acts thus.\"*\n\nAll rivers flow toward the sea—\nThose that do not are not valleys.\nMen pursue different paths—\nThose who do not return to the good are not noble.\n\nNoble speech must be practicable,\nNoble action must be rooted in benevolence and righteousness.\n\nThe noble’s errors,\nLike eclipses of the sun and moon,\nDo not obscure their brilliance.\nErrors are seen by all,\nBut when corrected, all revere them.\n\nThus, the wise do not act recklessly,\nThe brave do not kill recklessly—\nChoose what must be done,\nAct according to ritual propriety,\nSo that deeds are accomplished and merit is assured,\nAnd though death comes, his name endures.\n\nDo what must be done,\nKill what must be killed—\nThen success is achieved and name is established,\nPraised by future generations.\n\nThough one may be intelligent,\nHe must ground himself in benevolence and righteousness\nBefore he stands firm.\n\nIntelligence and ability must align—\nThe sage uses benevolence and righteousness as his measure.\nThose who meet the measure are noble;\nThose who do not are petty.\n\nThough the noble may die,\nHis name does not perish;\nThough the petty may gain power,\nTheir guilt is not erased.\n\nThus, Yao and Shun did good,\nAnd the worthy praised them;\nJie and Zhou did evil,\nAnd their names were not established.\n\nThe names of good and evil endure—\nThus, the noble is cautious in avoiding evil deeds.\n\nTo hold the map of the world in one hand\nAnd slit one’s own throat with the other—\nEven the foolish would not do this,\nFor life is precious above all.\n\nTo be a guest of the \"Lone Sovereign\" at dawn\nAnd a corpse cast aside by dusk—\nThese are the actions of the foolish and petty,\nNot the conduct of the noble.\n\nTo die for one’s lord and parents is to return home—\nRighteousness is heavier than life itself.\n\nThus, the greatest benefit in the world,\nCompared to the self, is small;\nThe self, compared to righteousness, is light.\n\nThis is to take benevolence and righteousness as the measure.\n\nIs this not a lament for the times lacking in benevolence and righteousness?\n\nThus, it is fitting to speak of the noble dying for righteousness,\nAnd the petty dying for gain.\n\nAs Laozi says:\n*\"The completeness of virtue and the Dao\nIs like the sun and moon—\nEven barbarians cannot alter their course.\nIf one has the Dao,\nEven in barbarian lands, it will prevail.\nWithout the Dao,\nWhat use is the Central States?\"*\n\nIf aspirations and actions align,\nThen praise or blame depends on custom;\nIf intentions and conduct are balanced,\nThen poverty or prosperity depends on fate.\n\nIf one’s deeds are complete in the world,\nThen success is achieved;\nIf one’s efforts accord with the times,\nThen name is established.\n\nThus, those who establish merit and name\nAre simple in the world yet cautious in the times.\nWhen the time arrives,\nEven a breath’s delay is too late.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of rescuing the fallen and the weak while establishing merit and name\nMust seize its opportunity—no time for hesitation, not even a breath.\n\nThe ancient warriors who wielded arms\nDid not covet land or treasure—\nThey sought to preserve life and quell disorder,\nTo remove harm from the people.\n\nMen greedy for wealth and pleasure,\nDevouring the world’s resources,\nDisturb the masses—\nNone can rest in their homes.\n\nWhen a **sage** arises in fury,\nPunishing the strong and violent,\nRestoring order to the chaotic age,\nRemoving the world’s calamities,\nTurning turbidity into clarity,\nTransforming peril into peace—\nThen they must be cut down.\n\nThe **Red Sovereign** became a fire disaster,\nSo the **Yellow Sovereign** subdued him.\n**Gonggong** brought water ruin,\nSo **Zhuanxu** slew him.\n\nThese two **sages** who rose in wrath\nDid not seek to exalt their power,\nTo profit from the land,\nTo hoard wealth,\nOr to spare the wicked—\nThey removed the world’s cruel afflictions,\nActing only when forced.\n\nTeach the people with the **Dao/Way**,\nGuide them with **virtue/power (de)**,\nYet if they do not heed,\nThen confront them with martial might.\nIf they still refuse,\nThen suppress them with arms.\n\nTo slaughter the innocent,\nTo sustain the unrighteous—\nNo greater harm exists.\nTo amass the world’s wealth,\nTo satisfy one man’s desires—\nNo deeper misfortune could be.\n\nTo indulge one man’s desires,\nYet prolong the nation’s suffering—\nThis is what **Heaven’s order (天伦)**** rejects.\n\nWhen **Heaven** destroys them,\n**Jie** and **Zhou** are the examples.\n\nThe purpose of establishing rulers\nIs to restrain violence and chaos.\nYet now, they exploit the people’s strength,\nOnly to become the very wickedness—\nSo, even with wings attached,\nHow can they claim to be unchecked?\n\nThe man who breeds fish\nMust remove the **bats (蝙蝠)** and **otters (獭)**,\nThe man who tends birds and beasts\nMust eliminate the **wolves (豺)** and **wild dogs (狼)**.\nHow much more so the shepherd of the people?\n\nThus, the reason arms are raised.\n\nNo **Dao/Way** is greater than punishing the violent,\nNo **virtue/power (de)** surpasses calming the people.\n\nWhen rulers are cruel and without the **Dao/Way**,\nThe masses are restless.\nIf they are not removed,\nIt is like letting ferocious beasts harm humanity,\nOr raising fish and turtles to feed the **bats** and **otters**—\nNo greater crime exists.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"The **Dao/Way** of governing a state\nIs to have no harsh decrees above,\nNo burdensome administration in office,\nNo deceptive conduct among the scholars,\nNo excessive craftsmanship among the artisans.\n\nTheir tasks are fulfilled without disturbance,\nTheir tools are complete without ornamentation—\nThis is the age of perfect governance.\"*\n\nIn times of disorder, it is not so.\nThose who pursue **achievement (行)**,\nCompete to exalt themselves in falsehood;\nThose who uphold **ritual (礼)**,\nVainly display their hypocrisy.\n\nChariots and carriages are over-carved,\nUtensils are excessively filigreed.\nSeekers of wealth vie for scarce treasures,\nCalling them precious;\nThose who follow **music (音)**,\nChase after frivolous complications,\nClaiming them urgent.\n\nDebates become deceitful,\nCases drag on endlessly—\nNo benefit to governance,\nOnly harm to order—\nThis is the logic of a declining age.\n\nArtisans craft bizarre tools,\nTaking years to complete,\nYet they fail to meet practical needs.\n\nThus, **Shennong’s law** states:\n*\"If men of prime vigor do not till the fields,\nThe world will have those who suffer hunger;\nIf women of their years do not weave,\nThe world will have those who endure cold.\"*\n\nTherefore, the **sage** plows in person,\nHis wife weaves by hand,\nSetting an example for all.\n\nIn guiding the people,\nThe **Son of Heaven** plows the fields to encourage farming,\nThe **Empress** personally spins to inspire weaving—\nHow much more so the common folk,\nWho grow slack in tilling and weaving,\nYet suffer from hunger and cold?\n\nPrecious things are not valued for their scarcity,\nUseless objects are not prized for their weight.\nThus, the plowman does not strain,\nFor there is no way to sustain life;\nThe weaver does not exert herself fully,\nFor there is no way to clothe the body.\n\nWith neither surplus nor lack,\nEach returns to their own needs.\nWhen food and clothing are abundant,\nWickedness does not arise.\nIn peace and ease,\nNo calamity occurs—\nThe world is harmonious.\n\nThe wise have no schemes to employ,\nThe brave have no strength to display.\nThe wise act to avert danger,\nThe brave act to suppress violence.\nWhen danger and violence cease,\nWhat need is there for them?\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"The **Dao/Way** of the **Conqueror** and **King**\nIs to plan with strategy,\nTo scheme with foresight.\nTo act under the banner of righteousness—\nNot to preserve his own state,\nBut to save the doomed.\n\nHe who saves the doomed—\nThus, when hearing of a ruler from another state\nWho oppresses his people,\nHe raises his army and marches to their borders,\nAccusing them of unrighteousness,\nExposing their misdeeds.\n\nAt the enemy’s outskirts,\nHe commands his generals:\n'Do not cut down trees,\nDo not dig up graves,\nDo not destroy crops,\nDo not burn stores,\nDo not capture the people,\nDo not seize livestock.'\n\nThen he proclaims:\n'That ruler\nDefies **Heaven and Earth**,\nInsults **spirits and gods**,\nJudges cases unjustly,\nSlaughters the innocent—\n**Heaven** condemns him,\nThe people seek vengeance.\n\nThe army comes\nTo abolish unrighteousness\nAnd enthrone the virtuous.\n\nIf any dare defy **Heaven’s order**,\nDisturb the people—\nDeath to themselves,\nExtinction of their kin.\nIf they heed the call as a family,\nReward the family;\nIf they heed as a neighborhood,\nReward the neighborhood;\nIf they heed as a village,\nReward the village;\nIf they heed as a county,\nReward the county.\n\nConquer the state,\nYet spare its people;\nDepose the ruler,\nYet reform his governance;\nHonor the talented,\nDisplay the virtuous;\nSupport the orphaned and widowed,\nRelieve the poor;\nFree the imprisoned,\nReward the meritorious.\n\nThe common folk open their doors to welcome them,\nOffer grain to store for them—\nOnly fearing they will not come.\n\nA **righteous army**, arriving at the border,\nStops without battle.\n\nWhere a **righteous army** passes,\n**Heaven and Earth** are made aware;\nThe **spirits and gods** are informed,\n**Virtue/power (de)** extends to all things.\nThey address the multitudes with words of peace,\nThey question the enemy with charges of guilt—\nYet they do not easily wield weapons of slaughter.\n\nThe people rejoice and submit,\nOnly fearing they will not arrive.\n\n**Yin Tang** and **Wen Wu**\nPunished violence with **righteousness**.\n\nAn **unrighteous army**\nArrives amid corpses and rivers of blood,\nFacing enemies in relentless combat.\nThus, those who fight for land\nCannot achieve kingship;\nThose who fight for themselves\nCannot establish merit.\n\nIf one raises arms for others,\nThe multitude will aid them;\nIf one raises arms for themselves,\nThe multitude will abandon them.\n\nWhere the multitude is moved,\nEven the weak will grow strong;\nWhere the multitude departs,\nEven the great will perish.\n\n「The unrighteous army, with its strength, dredges the weak,\nrelying on its greatness to encroach upon the small,\nslaughters the innocent, and harms the virtuous.\nThough it may butcher ten thousand in a city,\nplunder lands a thousand leagues wide,\nits fate shall be like that of Xiang Yu—\nwhose **Way (Dao)** dominated the seas and lands,\nwhose **qi** swallowed the cosmos,\nwhose might towered over hills and valleys—\nyet was ultimately crushed by Gaozu.\nThis is because he did not follow the **Way (Dao)** and righteousness;\nthough great, he must fall;\nthough strong, he must perish.\nEven the ambition for tyranny could not be fulfilled—\nhow much less could he achieve kingship?\n\n**Laozi** said:\n*\"The highest **virtue/power (de)** in governance*\nis to rule the state,\norder the realm,\npractice benevolence and righteousness,\nbestow virtue and kindness,\nestablish just laws,\nand block unrighteous paths.\nThen the ministers will be loyal and attached,\nthe people will be harmonious and unified,\nand the ruler and subjects will share a single heart,\ntheir ministers working in concert.\nThe feudal lords will submit to his authority,\nand the four quarters will embrace his **virtue/power (de)**.\nHe will rectify the halls of power,\nand vanquish his enemies a thousand leagues away.\nWhen he issues commands,\nthe world responds in unison—\nthis is the highest form of governance.\n\nWhen a state is vast and its people numerous,\nits ruler wise and its generals capable,\nits wealth abundant and its armies strong,\nits laws trusted and its orders clear,\nand its enemies balanced in strength,\nthen even without battle or blade,\nthe foe will flee in disarray—\nthis is the second form of governance.\n\nTo know the suitability of the land,\nto master the advantages of rugged passes,\nto discern the flaws of oppressive rule,\nand to study the movements of armies.\nWhen blades clash and arrows fly,\nto bear the dead and tend the wounded,\nto see rivers of blood and corpses strewn across the fields—\nthis is the lowest form of governance.\n\nTo govern through **virtue/power (de)** is the highest;\nto govern through law is the middle;\nto govern through force is the lowest.\n\nThe victory or defeat of armies\nlies in governance.\nWhen governance overcomes the people,\nthe lower ranks submit to the upper—\nthen the army is strong.\nWhen the people overcome governance,\nthe lower ranks rebel against the upper—\nthen the army is weak.\n\nIf **righteousness** is sufficient to embrace the people of the world,\nif undertakings are sufficient to meet the world’s crises,\nif appointments are sufficient to win the hearts of the worthy,\nand if deliberations are sufficient to weigh the light and heavy—\nthen this is the **Way (Dao)** of the highest **virtue/power (de)**.\n\n**Laozi** said:\n*\"The reason a state is strong*\nis because of its resolve to die.\nThe reason it resolves to die*\nis because of **righteousness**.\nThe reason **righteousness** prevails*\nis because of its **威 (威)** [awe/authority].\nThus, to govern with words of **virtue/power (de)**,\nand to unify with the might of **威 (威)** [awe/authority]—\nthis is called inevitable victory.\nWhen **威 (威)** and **righteousness** are both wielded—\nthis is called inevitable strength.\n\nWhen blades clash and stones rain down,\nyet soldiers vie to strike first—\nthis is because rewards are trusted and punishments are clear.\nIf a ruler regards his subjects as his children,\nhis subjects will serve him as their father;\nif a ruler regards his subjects as his younger brothers,\nhis subjects will serve him as their elder brothers.\nIf a ruler regards his subjects as his children,\nhe will surely reign over the four seas;\nif his subjects serve him as their father,\nhe will surely govern the world.\nIf a ruler regards his subjects as his younger brothers,\nthen he will surely die for them;\nif his subjects serve him as their elder brothers,\nthen he will surely perish for them.\nThus, when a ruler’s enemies are his own father, son, or brothers,\nhe cannot fight them.\nIf a ruler is thus,\nthen the world is like one family.\nTen thousand armies united in heart,\nthen even enemies are not feared,\nand death is not shunned.\nWhen **恩 (恩)** [favor] and **义 (义)** [righteousness] are felt,\nmen will regard death as returning home.\nWho would see their father in peril\nand grudge their own life to save him?\nWho would see their ruler in danger\nand fear death rather than remain loyal?\n\nThus, a **righteous ruler** refines his governance within,\nto accumulate his **virtue/power (de)**;\nand blocks the unrighteous without,\nto display his **威 (威)** [awe/authority].\nHe observes their labor and ease,\nto know their hunger and fullness.\nWhen war is decided upon,\nhe treats death as returning home—\nthis is the favor bestowed upon them.\nWhen **信 (信)** [trustworthiness] and **义 (义)** [righteousness] are established,\neven death is not shunned.\nWhen **恩 (恩)** [favor] and **威 (威)** [awe/authority] are both wielded,\nno distance is beyond their reach.\n\nThus concludes the eleventh volume of the *通玄真经 (Tongxuan Zhenjing)* [The Authentic Scripture of the Perfected Way].」\n\nThe Authentic Scripture of the Perfected Way, Volume Twelve\n*Commentary by Mo Xi Zi*, Part One: *On Rites*\n\nLaozi said:\n\nIn the ancient age, the True Person was the sovereign of the Mysterious Old Dao.\nThrough his breathing, he harmonized the yin and yang,\nand all things born under heaven naturally revered his **virtue/power (de)** for its gentleness and compliance.\nAt that time, **领理 (lingli)** [natural governance] and **隐密 (yinmi)** [subtle mystery] were spontaneously formed,\nand the pure, unrefined essence remained undispersed,\nwhile all things flourished in great ease.\nWithin, he concealed his bright **德 (virtue)**, without, he harmonized all things,\nand the world knew no strife—\neach followed its nature, without mutual harm,\nthus all lived in perfect ease.\n\nWhen the age declined to the time of **伏羲 (Fu Xi)**,\nthe people, dimly enlightened, all sought to abandon their childlike hearts\nand awaken to the Dao of heaven and earth.\nTheir **virtue/power (de)** became complex and inconsistent.\nThen the Eight Trigrams were first drawn,\nto connect with the divine and to categorize all emotions.\nKnotted ropes were made as nets and snares,\nto hunt and fish.\nThe sovereign of the world, having abandoned childlike simplicity,\ngradually lost his original Dao—\nhis **virtue/power (de)** became complex and inconsistent,\ncompared to the Mysterious Old time, making it an age of decline.\n\nWhen **神农 (Shennong)** and **黄帝 (Huangdi)** took leadership of the world,\nthey regulated the four seasons,\nharmonized the yin and yang,\nand thus all the people refined their bodies and minds,\nlistened and observed with reverence—\nyet governance remained harsh, not harmonious.\n\n**伏羲 (Fu Xi)** created the **未耜 (weiji)** [plowshare],\nto teach the people how to sow seeds;\n**黄帝 (Huangdi)** invented the **轩冕 (xuānmìan)** [ceremonial robes],\nand **窍领 (qiàolǐng)** [to regulate with subtle governance],\nmeaning to open the blocked and to harmonize the yin and yang,\nto stop the rebellious **气 (qi)** and to cease the harming of things.\nHe established writing and contracts,\nestablished laws and calendars,\nregulated the four seasons,\nharmonized the Five Phases,\nfearing the loss of their essence—\nhe made all things refine their bodies,\nand all focused their ears and eyes,\nlistening and observing to **德化 (dehua)** [virtuous transformation],\nto uphold their sovereign.\nThus, he spoke of governance being unharmonious.\n\nIn the ages of **夏 (Xia)** and **殷 (Yin)**,\ntheir desires extended to all things,\ntheir cleverness was enticed by the external world,\nand their true nature was lost.\nWhen desires for things arose in **夏 (Xia)** and **殷 (Yin)**,\nthey were enticed by the external world;\nwhen cleverness was indulged,\ntheir true nature was lost within.\nThis spread to the **周室 (Zhou Dynasty)**,\nwhere **浇 (Jiao)** and **醇 (chún)** [debauched and refined] diluted the pure,\nabandoned the Dao for falsehood,\ntook **险 (xian)** [deceitful] **德 (virtue)** as conduct,\nand gave rise to cleverness and cunning.\nThey schemed to imitate the sages,\nadorned falsehood to please the crowd,\npolished poetry and scriptures\nto purchase fame and reputation.\nEach sought to display their cleverness,\nto use falsehood to fit into the world,\nand thus lost the true essence of the great Dao.\nHence, the world has long been losing its true nature,\nand the decline has been gradual for ages.\n\nBy the time of the **周室 (Zhou Dynasty)**,\n**Dao/Way (Dao)** and **virtue/power (de)** were completely lost.\n**浇 (Jiao)** [debauched] and **酿 (niàng)** [refined] grew even more extreme,\ntaking falsehood and deceit as the Dao,\ntaking cleverness and cunning as **贤 (xian)** [virtuous excellence],\ndisplaying the Dao and boasting of **德 (virtue)**,\npurchasing fame and seeking reputation—\nthus losing the true essence of the great Dao.\nThe decline of the age began from **Fu Xi (伏羲)** and **Xuānmìan (轩冕)**,\ncounting thousands of years—\nthus it is said that the decline has been long,\nnot that it suddenly began in the **周室 (Zhou Dynasty)**.\n\nTherefore, the study of the **至人 (zhiren)** [perfected/sage] is to return to the **无 (wu)** [non-being/emptiness] of true nature,\nand to wander the mind in the **虚 (xu)** [void].\nThe study of the common world, however,\nis to **擢德 (zhuóde)** [flaunt virtue] and **攓性 (nièxìng)** [constrain nature],\nto torment the five **藏 (zang)** [organs],\nto act rashly beyond wisdom,\nand thus to **譊 (yǒu)** [create discord] with their cleverness and cunning.\nThey clamor and shout for fame in the world—\nthis is what the perfected do not do.\n**擢德 (zhuóde)** [flaunting virtue] is self-promotion,\n**攓性 (nièxìng)** [constraining nature] is to sever life.\nIf the perfected are steadfast in the meaning of death and life,\nand comprehend the logic of honor and disgrace,\nthen even if the whole world praises them, they are not further encouraged,\nand even if the whole world criticizes them, they are not discouraged.\nThis is the essence of attaining the **至道 (zhiDao)** [perfected Dao/Way].\n\nThe **至人 (zhiren)** [perfected/sage] exist in every age,\nbut they are rare.\nOne in ten thousand is already considered many.\nThe study of the perfected is to return to the **华伪 (huapí)** [false and ornate] realm of nature,\nand to bathe in the divine within the **虚静 (xūjìng)** [void and tranquil] domain.\nThey do not boast of their **德 (virtue)**,\nnor do they flaunt their talents—\ndeath and life bring no change to them,\nand harm and benefit do not affect their hearts.\nNow, the scholars of the world\nabandon true nature to seek enlightenment,\npursue fame to elevate their reputation—\nthus, the rise of deceit and decline of loyalty,\nand the concealment of the true and upright.\nIf one seeks governance of the world\nor personal peace and comfort,\nit cannot be attained.\n\nLaozi said:\n\nIn ancient times, those who ruled wore their hair unbound and had no **卷领 (juǎnlǐng)** [collared garments],\nyet they governed all under heaven.\nTheir **德 (virtue)** was born without killing,\nand they gave without taking.\nThough the people did not wear their ceremonial robes,\nthey all shared the same heart of **德 (virtue)**.\nAt that time, yin and yang were in harmony,\nand all things thrived and grew.\nThe nests of flying birds could be approached without alarm,\nand wild beasts could be tethered and followed.\nThe sovereign of the Mysterious Old Dao\ndid not wear a hat or comb his hair,\nbut let his hair flow unbound,\nand thus governed all under heaven.\nHe allowed the people to live in peace,\ndid not take their benefits—\nthus the four seasons were harmonious,\nand all things followed their nature.\nHence, the birds nested without fear,\nand the beasts were tethered without alarm.\nThis was the peak of **德 (virtue)**.\n\nWhen the age declined,\nbirds, beasts, insects, and serpents all became harm to the people,\nso iron was cast and blades were forged to repel their dangers.\nThus, when the people were pressed by their difficulties,\nthey sought convenience and ease,\nand when faced with calamities,\nthey took precautions.\nEach used their cleverness to avoid what harmed them,\nand to seek what benefited them.\nCustoms were no longer fixed,\nand tools could not be relied upon as before—\nthus the laws of the ancient kings were subject to change.\nHence it is said:\n*\"The nameable can be named,\nbut it is not the constant name.\"*\nIn the decline of the age,\nthings were no longer pure and singular,\nbut each gave rise to strange emotions,\nharming one another in succession.\nCleverness and deceit were used to deceive,\nand tools were made for defense,\nto avoid what harmed and to seek what benefited.\nThus the ancient kings changed their laws,\nnot because there was a fixed standard—\nhence, laws have no constant name.\n\nThe Five Emperors held different **Dao/Way (Dao)**,\nyet their **德 (virtue)** covered the world;\nthe Three Kings had distinct affairs,\nyet their names endured in posterity—\nall adapted to the times.\nIt is like the **师旷 (Shiguang)** [Master Musician] tuning the Five Notes,\nwhere the adjustments rise and fall without fixed measurement,\nyet all are in harmony.\nThus, those who understand the emotions of music\ncan compose the sounds.\n\nThe root principle lies within,\nand though the Five Emperors and Three Kings differed in their laws,\nthey were like Shiguang tuning the Five Notes,\nmastering the essence of music,\nand knowing the essence of harmony.\n\nThe Five Notes take *gong* as their root,\nand the myriad households take the sovereign as their root.\nWithout a central root, there is chaos—\nthus, a root is established to unify them.\n\nThose who understand the use of compasses, squares, hooks, and cords\ncan govern the people.\n\nHence, when the ancient kings’ institutions were no longer fitting,\nthey were discarded;\nwhen later ages’ affairs were good,\nthey were recorded.\n\nThus, the Sage’s establishment of rites and music\nwas not constrained by rites and music,\nthose who govern things are not constrained by things,\nthose who establish laws are not constrained by laws—\nto establish rites contrary to rites,\nto establish music contrary to music,\nis to go against the Dao.\n\nTo let things be governed by things is tolerable;\nto let laws be established contrary to laws\nis to exceed proper governance.\n\nHence it is said:\n*The Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.*\n\nLaozi said:\n*The ancient Sage-Kings looked upward to the patterns of Heaven,\nlooked downward to the measures of Earth,\nand took their laws from humanity.\nThey harmonized the yin and yang qi,\nbalanced the seasons’ rhythms,\nand observed the suitability of highlands, lowlands, waters, marshes, and fertile plains.\nThey established affairs and generated wealth according to elevation and terrain,\neliminating the calamities of hunger and cold,\nand warding off the disasters of sickness and misfortune.\nWithin, they received human affairs to establish rites and music,\npracticed the Way of benevolence and righteousness to govern human relations;\nthey arranged the natures of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth\nto establish filial piety and form the family;\nthey listened to the clear and turbid tones of the Five Notes,\nand the generative cycles of the Six *Lü*,\nto establish the proper relations of ruler and subject and form the state;\nthey observed the sequence of the four seasons—beginning, middle, and end—\nto establish the order of seniority and juniority and form the bureaucracy;\nthey divided the land into regions and governed the states;\nthey established the Grand Academy to teach—\nthese are the fundamental principles of governance.\n\nThese are the six fundamental principles for governing the world.\nWhen the Dao is attained, they are implemented;\nwhen the Dao is lost, they are abandoned.\n\nThings have never existed without tension and relaxation,\nwithout flourishing and decline—\nonly the Sage can flourish without decline.\n\nWhen the Sage first composed music,\nit was to return the spirit and suppress licentiousness,\nrestoring the natural heart.\nBut when it declined,\nit became excessive and unreturning,\nindulging in sensuality and disregarding proper law,\nspreading to later ages until kingdoms fell.\n\nWhen they established writing,\nit was to organize all affairs,\nso the foolish would not forget,\nand the wise would record events;\nbut when it declined,\nit became a tool for deceit,\nexcusing the guilty and condemning the innocent.\n\nWhen they established hunting grounds,\nit was to prepare for ancestral temples\nand to train soldiers against unforeseen dangers;\nbut when it declined,\nthey indulged in hunting and falconry,\nwasting the people’s time\nand exhausting their strength in leather and fur.\n\nWhen they honored the worthy,\nit was to spread teaching and justice,\nplacing the capable in office,\nthe skilled in their posts,\nand letting their virtue descend to the people,\nso all under Heaven cherished their virtue;\nbut when it declined,\nthey formed cliques and factions,\neach promoting their own,\nabandoning the public for private gain,\nwith outsiders and insiders aiding one another,\nthe unworthy in office,\nand the worthy in hiding.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth:\nwhen pushed to extremes, it reverses;\nwhen increased, it diminishes.\nThus, the Sage corrects flaws and changes institutions,\nand when matters conclude, they are renewed.\nTheir excellence lies in harmony,\ntheir failure in expedience.\n\nThe Sage’s Way states:\nWithout cultivating rites and righteousness,\nthere is no establishment of propriety and shame—\nand without propriety and shame, the people cannot be governed.\nWithout knowing rites and righteousness,\nlaws cannot be properly enforced.\nWithout elevating the good and abolishing the base,\none cannot turn toward rites and righteousness.\nWithout law, governance is impossible,\nand without knowing rites and righteousness,\none cannot implement law.\n\nLaw can punish the unfilial,\nbut cannot make people filial;\nit can punish thieves,\nbut cannot make people virtuous.\n\nWhen the Sage-King rules above,\nhe clearly demonstrates good and evil to guide the people,\npraises the worthy and censures the unworthy,\nadvances the worthy and demotes the unworthy,\nand though punishments are set,\nrites and virtue are cultivated,\nand the worthy are entrusted with governance.\n\nThus, the highest in the world are the Three Dukes,\nthe highest in a region are the Nine Ministers,\nthe highest in a state are the Twenty-Seven Great Officers,\nand the highest in a village are the Eighty-One Commoners.\n\nOfficials are appointed and duties divided,\nthe worthy are entrusted, and the corrupt removed,\nto serve as the king’s limbs and senses,\nharmonizing the myriad households\nand pacifying the four quarters.\n\nOne who surpasses ten thousand is called *ying* (heroic),\none who surpasses a thousand is called *jun* (exceptional),\none who surpasses a hundred is called *jie* (outstanding),\none who surpasses ten is called *hao* (talented).\n\nTo understand the Dao of Heaven and Earth,\nto grasp the principles of human nature,\nto be vast enough to contain the many,\nto be benevolent enough to embrace the distant,\nto be wise enough to know expedience—\nthis is the *ying* person.\n\nTo have virtue sufficient for teaching,\nconduct sufficient to uphold righteousness,\ntrust sufficient to win the people,\nclarity sufficient to illuminate below—\nthis is the *jun* person.\n\nTo have conduct worthy of emulation,\nwisdom sufficient to resolve doubts,\ntrust sufficient to keep agreements,\nintegrity sufficient to distribute wealth fairly,\nactions worthy of imitation,\nwords worthy of following—\nthis is the *jie* person.\n\nTo fulfill one’s duties without neglect,\nto act righteously without cliquishness,\nto face danger without cowardice,\nto reject gain without greed—\nthis is the *hao* person.\n\nThis is the method of selecting talent,\nthe means of knowing people.\nIf one possesses even one of these,\nthey can be used.\nIf they possess them all,\nthey are a Sage.\n\nThe heroic, exceptional, outstanding, and talented\nare placed according to their greatness and smallness,\nfrom root to branch,\nwith the heavy governing the light,\nthe ruler setting the tone and the people responding in harmony,\nso all under Heaven unite in one heart,\nturning away from greed and vulgarity,\ntoward benevolence and righteousness—\ntheir influence on the people\nis like the wind swaying the grass.\n\nNow, if the unworthy rule over the worthy,\neven severe punishments cannot restrain their deceit.\nThe weak cannot control the strong,\nthe small cannot govern the great—\nthis is the nature of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThus, the Sage selects the worthy to establish merit,\nwhile the unworthy ruler promotes those like themselves.\nBy observing whom they promote,\none can discern order or chaos;\nby examining their factions,\none can judge the worthy from the unworthy.\n\nThe Sage’s use of people\nmatches their talents,\nand when officials do not overstep their ranks,\nthe world is governed.\n\nThe Master Laozi says:\n\nThose who make **rites** carve and polish human nature,\nstraightening and restraining their feelings—\nthough the eyes may covet them,\nthey are checked by measure.\nThough the heart may delight in them,\nthey are moderated by **rites**—\ncircumambulating, bowing low,\nflesh stiff with hunger yet not eating,\nwine offered yet not drinking,\nthe body bound in form,\nthe mind troubled, its voice imprisoned.\nTheir **virtue** restrains the harmony of yin and yang,\nforcing the natural inclinations of life and death—\nthus, they become sorrowful men all their days.\n\nWhy so? They do not root out the source of what is desired,\nyet they restrain what is desired;\nthey do not trace the origin of what brings delight,\nyet they prevent what brings delight—\nthis is like enclosing a beast without blocking its den,\nrestraining its wild heart,\nor damning the flow of a river while trying to stop it with one’s hand.\nHence it is said:\n*\"Open its mouth, aid its work—\nyet its life will never be saved.\"*\n\nWhen the flaws of **rites** and **music** arise,\nand the artifice of feelings is exposed,\nthey do not root out the absence of desire,\nyet they restrict what is desired;\nthey do not trace the absence of delight,\nyet they prevent what is delighted in—\nthen desire cannot be stopped,\ndelight cannot be restrained.\nDelight, when unrestrained, leads to excess;\n**rites**, when not properly observed, lead to neglect.\nAnd from opening the pen to release the beasts,\nfrom damning the river to halt its flow,\nonce truth is lost, all are bewildered and cannot return.\n\nNow, **rites** are meant to curb feelings and close desires,\nto defend oneself with **righteousness**—\nthough the feelings and heart may choke,\nand desires may burst forth,\nthe body and nature hunger and thirst,\nyet they endure what cannot be avoided—\nthus, none can complete their natural lifespan.\n\nTo uphold **rites** is to be bound and constrained,\nforced by feelings and nature,\nall striving to endure—\nthus, none complete their natural lifespan.\n\n**Rites** do not make people not desire,\nbut they restrain desire;\n**music** does not make people not delight,\nbut it restrains delight.\n\nIf one makes all under Heaven fear punishment\nand thus dare not steal or rob,\nis it not better to make them have no thieving heart?\nIf one does not open their cravings,\nwhat need is there for dikes and walls?\nIf one does not amass wealth and goods,\nthere will be no thieves to steal or rob.\n\nThus, when one knows what is truly useless,\neven the greedy will abandon it;\nwhen one does not know what is truly useful,\nthe virtuous cannot yield to it.\n\nThat which causes the ruin of states,\ndeath at the hands of others,\nand laughter from all under Heaven—\nhas it not been desire?\nThe harm of desire is so great.\n\nWho knows the uselessness of summer furs\nand winter fans\nwill see all things turn to dust and filth.\nWho knows the uselessness of all things\nwill see them become dung and soil.\n\nHence the Way teaches:\n*\"The harm lies with those who have desire.\"*\n\nThus, to cool boiling water with a ladle,\nthe boiling only worsens—\nbut to know its root,\none need only remove the fire.\nNone know the Way better than those who have no desire;\nto stop the boiling lies in removing the kindling.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"To follow one’s nature and act is called the Dao;\nto attain one’s natural essence is called **virtue**.*\n\nOnce nature is lost,\nthen **righteousness** and **benevolence** are prized—\nbut when **righteousness** and **benevolence** stand,\nthe Dao and **virtue** are abandoned.\nPurity is scattered, **rites** and **music** take their place—\ndistinctions arise, the people are dazzled,\nand jade and pearls are treasured—\nall under Heaven contend.\n\nWhen the Dao and **virtue** are gone,\n**righteousness** and **benevolence** are insufficient to restrain their feelings,\n**rites** and **music** are insufficient to curb their desires—\none man upholds them, yet a hundred men contend—\nthen chaos ensues.\n\nNow, **rites** are meant to distinguish high and low, noble and base;\n**righteousness** is meant to harmonize the relations of\nruler and subject, father and son, elder and younger brothers,\nhusband and wife, and all human interactions.\n\nIn the **end times**, **rites** become mere etiquette,\nand **righteousness** is practiced through charity—\nrulers and subjects criticize each other,\nand kin bear grudges.\n\nThus, when water accumulates, it breeds devouring insects;\nwhen earth accumulates, it spawns self-consuming hunters—\nwhen **rites** and **music** are merely decorative,\ndeceit and falsehood arise.\nLike one who fans a fire to burn oneself,\nor throws oneself into water to drown.\n\nMoreover, **rites** and **righteousness** originally have no nature of harming others;\nwater and fire, too, have no intent to harm—\nbut when they are used contrary to their proper Way,\nthey bring disaster;\nwhen they are used in accord with their proper Way,\nthey bring blessing.\n\nIn the **end times**, governance does not accumulate means for nurturing life,\nbut pours out the pure and scatters the genuine—\nit confuses the people,\ntaking what is clear for what is turbid,\nand life and nature are scattered.\nAll strive to create chaos,\nfaith and sincerity decay,\npeople lose their nature—\nlaw contradicts **righteousness**, actions oppose profit,\nthe poor and rich vie with each other,\nand rulers and commoners are no longer distinguishable.\n\nWhen there is excess, there is yielding;\nwhen there is lack, there is contention—\nyielding gives rise to **rites** and **righteousness**,\ncontention spawns violence and disorder.\nThus, many desires lead to unchecked actions,\nand seeking indulgence brings endless strife.\n\nHence, in times of order, the petty man upholds propriety,\nand profit cannot tempt him;\nin times of chaos, the noble man becomes deceitful,\nand law cannot restrain him.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"The rulers of the **end times**,\ndrill through mountains for stones,\npluck gold and jade,\ndig up tortoises and turtles,\nmelt copper and iron—\nyet all things do not flourish.\n\nThey hollow out wombs and burn the fields,\nupset nests and destroy eggs—\nphoenixes do not fly,\nqilin do not roam.\n\nThey pile wood to build high platforms,\nburn forests for hunting,\ndrain ponds for fishing,\nheap earth to make artificial hills,\ndig wells for drinking,\ndredge rivers to make pools,\nbuild walls for defense—\nthey trap beasts as livestock—\nthen yin and yang are disrupted,\nthe four seasons lose their order,\nthunder and lightning are shattered,\nhail and frost bring harm—\nall things wither and die,\nhalf of them perish,\nand grasses and trees dry up in summer.*\n\nThe rulers of the **end times**,\nsplit rocks to find jade,\ndig clamshells for pearls,\nburn the fields and drain the ponds,\nhollow out wombs and destroy eggs—\nthey indulge the desires of their nature,\nsatisfy the pleasures of their ears and eyes—\nthus, they bring about discord,\nand all things lose their proper place.\nThunder and lightning strike in terror,\nhail and frost bring ruin—\nnot the fault of all the lands,\nbut the crime of one man alone.\n\nHence, Xia Jie and Shang Zhou,\nthough their cities were not unhigh,\ntheir jade and silk not few,\ntheir allure not lacking,\ntheir granaries not empty—\nsuddenly their ancestral lines were cut off,\ntheir states ruined,\nthey died at the hands of others,\nbecame the laughingstock of all under Heaven—\nhow painful was it not?\n\nThe **Way of Heaven** is not distant—it was in the **Xia** and **Shang** dynasties.\n\nThe Three Rivers ceased to flow.\nThe mountains and valleys were divided,\ngiving them boundaries and limits—\nwhen the **Zhou** declined, the Three Rivers dried up.\nWhen the **Jin** weakened, the **Sandu** and **Lu** lands collapsed.\n\nWhen a state is about to rise,\nit must have auspicious omens;\nwhen a state is about to fall,\nit must have **demonic portents** and calamities.\n\nCounting the people’s numbers,\nestablishing ranks and divisions,\nsetting up traps and obstacles as defenses,\nregulating the colors of clothing,\ndistinguishing noble and ignoble,\ndifferentiating the worthy from the unworthy,\nand enacting rewards and punishments—\nthen wars arise and contentious strife is born,\nthe innocent are slaughtered,\nthe guilty are executed without crime,\nand thus, decline begins.\n\nThe **Heaven and Earth** cannot help but shift,\nand the people cannot help but suffer disaster and peril.\n\n**Laozi** said:\n*\"When the world is about to lose its **Dao/Way** and its life,\nit is like the rise of the **yin** qi—\nthe ruler is dark and unclear,\nthe **Dao/Way** is abandoned and not followed,\n**virtue/power** is extinguished and not displayed.\nActions go against **Heaven**,\ncommands defy the four seasons.\nSpring and autumn shrink their harmony,\n**Heaven and Earth** remove their **virtue/power**,\nthe sovereign sits uneasily in his position,\nthe ministers withdraw in seclusion and speak no more,\nthe officials twist the ruler’s intentions to ruin the norms,\nthey sever ties with kin to preserve their own safety,\nwicked men flatter while secretly plotting,\nthey load the arrogant ruler with his own chaos,\nand people act to fulfill his schemes.\nTherefore, the ruler and his ministers are estranged and not affectionate,\nkin are distant and not attached.\nFields yield no sprouts,\nroads have no leisurely travelers,\nstockpiled gold becomes tarnished,\nwalls crumble without repair,\ntortoiseshells have no inner lining,\ndivination stalks are used daily,\nand the world is divided yet made into one household.*\n\nThe feudal lords enact laws that differ,\ncustoms become perverse,\nthey uproot their foundations and abandon their roots,\nengrave the Five Punishments like carvings,\nquibbling over the minutest details,\nthey slaughter and reap their people, taking half of them,\nraise armies for destruction,\nassault cities with indiscriminate killing,\noverthrow the high and secure the low,\nuse heavy chariots,\nbuild tall ramparts,\ndismantle battle formations,\nforce soldiers into death paths,\nconfront stern enemies,\nwith ten attacks and one retreat,\ntheir reputation may be grand,\nthey conquer lands and hold territories,\nbut the number of fallen corpses reaches tens of thousands,\nand those who die from hunger and cold in their old age cannot be counted.\n\nFrom this point onward,\nthe world has never known peace in its **Dao/Way** and life,\nnor joy in its customs.\"*\n\nThe degenerate rulers of the end times,\nrelying on their might and expanding their lands,\nexhausting the lives of the common folk,\nquibbling over trifles,\nwith corpses piled and blood flowing without respite,\nuntil this very day—\nhow could this be the **Dao/Way**?\n\nThe worthy and sagely rise in vigor,\nupholding **virtue/power** and supplementing with **ren** and **yi**,\ndrawing near to enlighten the wise,\nwinning over the distant with their **virtue/power**,\nunifying the world into one.\nTheir descendants succeed in assisting one another,\nbanishing the origins of slanderous flatterers,\nsilencing unproven arguments,\nabolishing harsh laws,\nremoving burdensome regulations,\nshutting out idle gossip,\nsealing the gates of factions,\ndulling sharp intellects,\nfollowing the Great Constant,\ndemolishing superficial forms,\ndiscarding cleverness,\ngreatly harmonizing the obscure,\nallowing all things to return to their roots.\n\nThe Sage does not create the times;\nwhen the times arrive, they do not fail—\nthus they cannot be interrupted.\nThe Sage perceives the moment,\nseizes the time,\nrises in vigor,\nrectifying Heaven and Earth,\nextinguishing brutality,\ngreatly sheltering the common folk.\n\nWhen Heaven bestows great responsibility upon one,\nthey cannot be interrupted—\nwords must have their master.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"The depth of the Ying River,\nten *ren* deep yet untainted by dust,\ngold and stone within reveal their forms without—\nnot because it is not deep and pure.\nTurtles, fish, dragons, and serpents do not dwell there.\nFor water too pure, fish will not swim;\na man too scrutinizing, none will follow him.\nNo grains grow on barren rock,\nno deer roam the bald mountain—\nthere is no shelter.\nThus, governing with harshness as scrutiny,\nseverity as clarity,\ncruelty as loyalty,\nand scheming as merit—\nsuch methods are like stretching leather too wide,\nthe path to great ruin and splitting.\nGoverning with poetry leads to defeat,\nstretching leather too wide leads to splitting.\nWhen governance is stifling, the people are sincere;\nwhen governance is probing, the people are depleted.\nExcessive scrutiny above brings unrest below.\"*\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"To govern a state, to employ strategy in war,\nfirst establish an unbeatable governance,\nthen seek victory over the enemy—\nto attack disorder with what is untamed\nis like answering fire with fire, water with water.\nThe same cannot govern itself.\nThus, the strange is made effective:\nstrange stillness as agitation,\nstrange order as chaos,\nstrange abundance as hunger,\nstrange ease as toil,\nstrange rectitude clashing like water, fire, metal, wood—\nwhere can one not prevail?\n\nThus, when **virtue/power** is balanced, the many defeat the few;\nwhen strength is equal, the wise overcome the foolish;\nwhen wisdom is matched, the calculated ensnare the incalculable.\nThis shows how rectitude and the strange attack each other,\nthe worthy and foolish contend.\nThough great gains may be equal,\nthose who lead the multitude prevail;\nthough strength may be matched,\nwisdom subdues the foolish;\nthough wisdom may be equal,\nthe cunning ensnare the uncunning.\nStrategy and calculation—\nthese are all arts of mutual conquest,\nalternately capturing and controlling,\nyet not the **Dao/Way**—\nthis is the art of expedience.\"\n\nThe *Tongxuan Zhenjing* concludes its twelfth scroll.",

Yet its faint ripples endure, for among the various masters, none fail to trace their lineage to the Dao and virtue, mending the ruptures of a hundred generations.\n\nWenzi was a man of the time of King Ping of Zhou. He composed a work in twelve fascicles. The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: \"Wenzi is also called Jiran, the teacher of Fan Li. His surname was Xin, given name Yan, styled Wenzi, a native of Pu in Caiqiu. A descendant of the Duke of Jin, he twice journeyed abroad, and Fan Li followed and served him. He was also a disciple of Laozi.\"\n\nKing Ping asked Wenzi: \"I have heard that you received the Dao from the Old Master. Though a worthy possesses the Dao, if he lives in an age of debauchery and chaos, relying on the authority of one man to transform a people long steeped in disorder—can this truly be done?\"\n\nWenzi replied: \"When the Dao and virtue correct the perverse to govern, and restore order from chaos, reviving sagely virtue so that all under Heaven is at peace, the key lies in one man. Thus, the accumulation of virtue brings kingship, while the accumulation of resentment leads to ruin. By this, Yao and Shun flourished, while Jie and Zhou perished.\"\n\nKing Ping trusted his words and employed him, and in that time, all under Heaven was well-governed. Yet whether a state stands secure or falls, its fate does not descend from Heaven—it rests solely on whether the ruler employs the worthy.\n\nThus, the sage, ever vigilant for the world, cherishes its people as an infant, seeking to bring benefit, remove harm, and secure their peace—not for any private gain. His work first recounts the signs of rise and fall among the sage-kings and hegemons, then traces the causes of the waxing and waning of the Dao, virtue, propriety, and righteousness. In all, it ascends to the profoundest mysteries and extends to the myriad things. Its purport is vast and abstruse, its language refined yet true. Therefore, for those who govern a state, even in an age of decadence and decline, it can return them to the simplicity of primordial purity. For those who cultivate themselves, even burdened by the weight of cares, it can restore them to the spontaneity of their inherent nature. How great indeed!\n\nThe gentleman cannot but carve out his heart to receive it.\n\nIn the eleventh generation of our Tang, the Emperor, with robes flowing and transformation spreading, harmonizes and nurtures all things, embracing the myriad states with gentle grace, uniting diverse customs under one rule. Thus, those in high office all exhaust their loyalty and devotion, while those dwelling in obscurity also find peace in their labors.",

      "translated_text": "In the fourth year of the Yuanhe reign, I, Moxi, withdrew to the distant slopes of Mount Heng, where I built my hut before the Hua Gai peak. Eight years have since passed, during which I have diligently cultivated the winds of simplicity and unobtrusively savored the subtle purport of the Way. Though I remain unfit for silent reverence, I have nonetheless forced myself to compose this commentary—an endeavor as daunting as measuring the vastness of the Milky Way or gauging the depths of the boundless sea. Thus, I offer this preface.\n\n*Preface by Master Moxi*\n\n**The Scripture of Penetrating the Mystery, Scroll One**\n*Commentary by Master Moxi*\n\n**The Origin of the Dao**\n\nOf all things esteemed, none surpasses man.\nYet failing to settle the mind’s restlessness and illuminate its clarity, or to sever the net of attachment at the crossroads of desire, man’s nature drifts with craving, his life dissolving into the flux of things—much to the sorrow of the perfected.\nThus, the origin of the Great Dao is set forth here at the head of these chapters, that one may trace the source to ascend the Way and, in every encounter, touch the real. How could this not be fitting?\n\nLaozi said:\nThere is a thing, chaotically complete, profoundly still and ever-abiding—hence it is called “a thing.”\nIt shapes and nurtures the ten thousand kinds, hence it is called “chaotically complete.”\nBorn before heaven and earth, it stands foremost among all things.\nIts image is formless, like the heavens’ height bearing great signs, while the Dao’s vastness knows no fixed shape.\nIt congeals in emptiness as the One, and as qi disperses, it unfolds into the ten thousand things.\n\nAbysmally dark, profoundly still, utterly serene and indifferent—such is the nature of the Dao, subtle and unfathomable.\nNo sound is heard, for it transcends sound; no form is seen, for it transcends color. Yet I am compelled to name it, calling it the Dao.\nSince it is neither sound nor color, it is nameless, wordless, beyond speech or description.\nWhat is spoken here is not its true designation, hence it is called a “forced name.”\n\nThe Dao is lofty beyond reach, deep beyond measure.\nDevoid of form or image, how could its height or depth be gauged?\nIt enfolds heaven and earth, bestowing without shape.\nIts source flows ceaselessly like water, ever full yet never overflowing, ever drawn yet never depleted.\n*Chuochuo*: the appearance of water welling forth.\nWhen turbid, it gradually clarifies through stillness—so too does motion settle into quiet, and murkiness into clarity.\nIts bounty is inexhaustible, unbound by time, its generosity extending beyond any single dawn or dusk.\nThough manifest, it does not fill a grasp; though tangible, it eludes form.\nContracted, it can expand; obscure, it can illuminate; supple, it can be firm.\nIt embraces yin and exhales yang, revealing the three luminaries.\nSpoken in obscurity, its brightness rivals the three celestial lights.\nSpoken in softness, its sharpness cuts through metal and stone.\nThus, it can be yin or yang, soft or hard, great or small, short or long.\nTurn toward it, and it abides; turn away, and it vanishes.\nIt is neither this nor that, its transformations boundless.\nBy it, mountains rise in height, abysses plumb their depths.\nBy it, beasts run, birds fly, unicorns swim, phoenixes soar, and the stars traverse their courses.\nHow could the loftiness of mountains, the profundity of abysses, the swimming of unicorns, the soaring of phoenixes, or the unerring movements of celestial bodies arise from anything but the mysterious resonance of perfect governance?\n\nThrough nonbeing, it attains being; through humility, it gains honor; through retreat, it takes the lead.\nThis means: by relinquishing life, one preserves the self; by humbling oneself, one is exalted; by yielding, one advances.\nThe nature of the Dao delights in modesty, and thus modesty brings benefit.\n\nIn ancient times, the Three Sovereigns grasped the thread of the Dao, standing at the center and roaming in spirit with transformation to govern the four directions—the Three Sovereigns being Fuxi, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor.\nIn ruling the world, their spirit moved within, while their virtue and grace overflowed without.\nThus, they could emulate the heavens’ motion and the earth’s stillness, their wheel turning without cease, their waters flowing without end, accompanying all things from beginning to end.\nWinds arose and clouds gathered, thunder resounded and rain descended, all responding without limit.\n*The heavens move; the earth rests.*\nThis speaks of the sage who models the heavens’ activity and the earth’s tranquility, aligning with the beginnings and endings of the ten thousand things.\nIssuing decrees and commands, thunder rolls and winds rise, clouds drift and rain falls, nurturing and sustaining all beings, responding to change without end.\n\nCarved and polished, it returns to simplicity.\nCultivating truth and prudence in conduct—this is what is meant by “polishing.” Yet when one severs dependence and congeals in emptiness, one naturally reverts to simplicity.\nActing without acting, it harmonizes with life and death.\nThe Great Dao is without intent, allowing things to follow their nature—hence it is called “nonaction.”\nLife cannot but live, for life is natural.\nDeath cannot but die, for death is natural—thus it harmonizes with life and death.\nSpeaking without speaking, it communicates virtue; tranquil and unassuming, it attains harmony.\nThis means: without words, it reaches virtue; without affectation, it achieves harmony.\nThough the ten thousand things differ, they all thrive in accord with their nature.\nIt harmonizes yin and yang, regulates the four seasons, and adjusts the five phases.\nYin and yang harmonize the four seasons, which in turn regulate the five phases—this is the constant Way.\nThis does not mean the sage alters or creates anew, but rather that he humbly observes human affairs, emulates the heavens’ timing, and discerns the people’s sentiments, preventing wickedness and ushering in great peace.\nIt moistens grasses and trees, seeps into metal and stone.\nBirds and beasts grow large, their fur lustrous; eggs do not spoil, and animal fetuses do not miscarry.\n*Sound: dú.*\nThe Dao’s efficacy prevails, and all things fulfill their growth without harming one another.",

Thus, those in high office all exhaust their loyalty and devotion, while those dwelling in obscurity also find peace in their labors.",

      "translated_text": "Fathers know no grief of losing sons, elder brothers no day of weeping for younger brothers. Above, governance flows smoothly; below, none rebel. Children are not orphaned, nor do they die untimely. Women are not widowed, all secure in their bonds. Rainbows and miasmas vanish, evil qi conceals itself. Bandits and thieves cease their ways, and the world attains great harmony—all brought forth by the power of embodied virtue.\n\nThe blessings just named all arise from the sage’s nurturing influence. The constant Way of heaven generates and transforms without end, giving life yet possessing nothing, perfecting transformations yet ruling nothing. In \"possessing nothing\" lies the wondrous presence of being; in \"ruling nothing\" appears the true ruler. The ten thousand things depend on it to live, yet none know its virtue; they depend on it to die, yet none can resent it. Life is not mine to claim—whom should I thank? Death is not mine to inflict—whom should I blame? It gathers and stores yet grows no richer, distributes and bestows yet suffers no poverty. Hoarded, it never overflows; scattered, it never empties.\n\nVague and elusive, it defies representation; fleeting and indistinct, its use knows no limit. Profound and obscure, it responds to transformations without form. In the space between fleeting and indistinct, its responses are inexhaustible. At the threshold of the profound and obscure, its changes are boundless. Traced to its source, it seems to hold something; pursued further, it has no shape. Flowing and unobstructed, it never acts in vain. Its spiritual workings complete, its principles never respond falsely.\n\nIt coils and unfurls with hardness and softness, rises and falls with yin and yang, bending and stretching with the seasons. Laozi said: \"The great man who embodies the Dao is serene, without thought; tranquil, without worry. Moving with the Dao, why trouble with thoughts and concerns?\"\n\nTaking heaven as his canopy, earth as his chariot, the four seasons as his horses, and yin and yang as his charioteer, he travels where there are no roads, roams without rest, and exits where there are no gates. With heaven as his canopy, nothing is left uncovered; with earth as his chariot, nothing is left uncarried. With the four seasons as his horses, nothing is left uncommanded; with yin and yang as his charioteer, nothing is left unprepared. The great man rides the uprightness of heaven and earth, harnesses the movements of yin and yang, traverses boundless realms, and roams the inexhaustible Dao—how magnificent is this!\n\nThus, swift yet unshaken, distant yet untiring, his four limbs unmoved, his clarity and insight undiminished, he illuminates all under heaven—grasping the essence of the Dao to observe the limitless. Holding fast to the Dao’s essence, he surveys the eight directions as if in his palm. The subtlety of perfect governance resides in the square inch of the heart. How could he exhaust himself racing near and far?\n\nTherefore, the affairs of the world cannot be forced; those who force them invite failure. Push forward by following their natural course, and nothing will fail to flourish. The changes of the ten thousand things cannot be rescued; grasp their essence and return to it. Though their transformations are manifold, their essence can be precisely discerned.\n\nThus, the sage cultivates his root within and does not adorn his branches without. He rectifies his heart within and rejects extraneous arts without. He sharpens his spirit to attain inner clarity and stills his knowledge and perceptions to halt what is not the Dao. Thus, he is effortlessly inactive yet accomplishes everything, governs without governing yet nothing is left ungoverned. The so-called \"non-action\" does not precede the things themselves; \"non-governance\" does not alter the natural. \"Nothing is left ungoverned\" follows the mutual arising of things. When things are allowed to be as they may, then nothing is not as it should be. When governance follows what can be governed, then nothing is left ungoverned.\n\nLaozi said: \"He who holds the Dao to govern the people responds to matters as they arise, follows things as they move. The transformations of the ten thousand things all find their response; the changes of a hundred affairs all find their match.\" This means that when the sage governs the world, he stabilizes human affairs according to their convenience, and thus the people cannot but be transformed, and all things cannot but harmonize.\n\nThus, the Dao is empty and formless, level and easy, clear and still, soft and weak, pure and unadorned—these five are the forms and images of the Dao. Without possessing these five virtues, one cannot perceive the form of the formless or the image of the imageless.\n\nEmptiness and formlessness are the dwelling of the Dao. \"Dwelling\" means residence. Levelness and ease are the simplicity of the Dao. \"Simplicity\" means essence. Clarity and stillness are the mirror of the Dao. \"Mirror\" means illumination. Softness and weakness are the function of the Dao. \"Function\" means penetration. Reversal is the constant of the Dao. The common use is action; the Dao’s use is non-action. Softness is the hardness of the Dao; weakness is the strength of the Dao. Accumulated softness becomes hardness; accumulated weakness becomes strength. Purity, simplicity, and unadornedness are the trunk of the Dao.\n\nEmptiness means the center holds nothing; levelness means the heart bears no burdens. Desire and craving do not burden—this is the perfection of emptiness. Having no likes or dislikes—this is the perfection of levelness. Unchanging unity—this is the perfection of stillness. Unmixed with things—this is the perfection of purity. Free from sorrow and joy—this is the perfection of virtue. These resolve the five meanings.\n\nIn the governance of the perfected man, he discards his cleverness and does not adorn his wisdom. He erases his embellishments and preserves his simplicity. Following the Dao, he abandons cunning and fulfills the way of clarity and emptiness, casting off deluded and false wisdom. He emerges with the people from the public, without private motives. He restricts what he holds, reduces what he seeks, relinquishes his temptations and longings, removes his desires and avarice, and casts aside his thoughts and concerns.\n\nRestricting what he holds leads to discernment; reducing what he seeks leads to attainment. When the heart attains unity, it masters the arts of the ten thousand things. Restriction enables subtle understanding; reduction enables the governance of the many. Thus, controlling the external with the internal, nothing is left undone. If the internal attains it, the external can be shepherded. The attainment of the internal—\"internal\" refers to the ruler in a state and the heart in a person. When the ruler is enlightened, the state is at peace; when the heart is upright, the body is governed. Thus, controlling the external with the internal, the world has no equal. Controlling the internal with the external leads to success or failure. Knowing both internal and external, no action fails.\n\nThe great man rides the uprightness of heaven and earth, harnesses the movements of yin and yang, traverses boundless realms, and roams the inexhaustible Dao—how could this not be magnificent?",

      "translated_text": "The five viscera at peace, thoughts and reflections balanced, sinews and bones firm and strong, ears and eyes keen and bright—all arise from guarding the center. The great Dao is smooth and broad, not far from the self; those who seek it afar go forth only to return. To wade far and lose the ford, not knowing to seek it near within oneself—\n\nLaozi said: The sage forgets governing others and attends to self-cultivation; values forgetting power and rank and attends to self-attainment. In self-attainment, the world attains me. Never has one whose own person is ungoverned been able to govern others, nor one in power who does not overbear others. Only in self-attainment does one not overbear. In self-attainment, what I love, others also love. With my feelings, I grasp theirs—thus it is called self-attainment. In self-attainment, the feelings of the world are all attained by me. Joy forgets wealth and nobility and resides in harmony; only one who does not overbear preserves harmony and joy amid wealth and nobility.\n\nTo know the greatness of the self and make the world small is near to the Dao. Attaining the Dao, though the self is slight, one may possess the world—thus the self is great. Losing the Dao, though the world is vast, there is nowhere to contain the self—thus the world is small.\n\nThus it is said: Utmost emptiness, profound stillness—all things arise together, and I observe their return. Things arise from emptiness and stillness, thus returning to the root is called stillness. Stillness is called the restoration of life, meaning the endless cycle of going and returning, where the myriad things never end.\n\nThe Dao shapes and nurtures the myriad things, beginning and ending without form, motionless and silent, vast and boundlessly obscure. The Dao is tranquil and vast, a great furnace molding clay, beginning in formlessness. Within it lies something, yet it ends without form. Who knows its limit? It resides in boundless obscurity, beyond the ken of gods and spirits.\n\nVast and deep, broad and great, it cannot be made external; minute and subtle, it cannot be made internal. Without walls or enclosure, the greatest cannot be sought outside, the smallest cannot be grasped within. It gives rise to the general name of being and non-being. Speak of non-being, and all categories teem forth; speak of being, and no shape or sign appears. This is the essence of non-action, the subtlety of existing things—the general name of the myriad things arises between being and non-being.\n\nThe true person embodies emptiness and non-being, simplicity and ease, purity and stillness, softness and weakness, unadulterated plainness, not mingling with things. This is the virtue and Dao of heaven and earth—thus they are called true persons. Their body aligns with emptiness and non-being, their virtue harmonizes with heaven and earth—thus they are true persons.\n\nThe true person knows the greatness of the self and makes the world small, values governing the self and disdains governing others. From the human perspective, the world seems vast; from the Dao’s perspective, the world is small. Viewed from afar, governing others seems base; viewed from near, governing the self is noble.\n\nNot allowing things to disturb harmony, not allowing desires to disorder the feelings—if the heart is not moved by things, how can feelings be disordered by desires? They conceal their name and identity, drifting with the times, flowing with the俗, yet none know them—this is the utmost concealment. When the Dao prevails, they withdraw and remain silent; when the Dao is absent, they exert themselves and cultivate it. They act without acting, engage in affairs without affairs, know without knowing. They act without reliance, engage without pride, know without display.\n\nEmbracing the heavenly Dao, encompassing the heart of heaven, they exhale and inhale yin and yang, expel the old and take in the new. With yin, they close; with yang, they open. With hardness and softness, they contract and extend; with yin and yang, they bow and rise. Their heart is one with heaven, their body one with the Dao. Exhaling and inhaling follow principle, contraction and extension are fitting, movement and stillness have rhythm, bending and stretching accord with the seasons.\n\nNo joy, no sorrow, no delight, no anger—the myriad things are profoundly the same, without right or wrong. Sorrow and joy do not cling to the heart, delight and anger do not show on the face. Encountering things, they remain true—thus it is called profound sameness.\n\nWhen the body is harmed by the ravages of cold, heat, dryness, and dampness, the form is exhausted and the spirit blocked. When the spirit is harmed by the afflictions of joy, anger, thought, and worry, the spirit is spent and the form remains in excess. Cold and heat assail from without, joy and anger arise within. As the spirit departs, though the remaining form persists—how can it endure long?",

      "translated_text": "Thus the true person employs the heart-mind to restore nature, relying on spirit for mutual support, and so attains wholeness from beginning to end. Therefore, their sleep is dreamless, and their waking is carefree.\n\nThe true person knows how yin and yang harm the upright, discards partial and biased emotions, and nurtures a nature of tranquility and indifference—thus body and spirit sustain each other, and worry and dreams do not intrude.\n\nWhen Confucius asked about the Dao, Laozi said: \"Correct your form, unify your gaze, and the harmony of Heaven will arrive. When the form is unified and upright, the four limbs are all proper; when the heart-mind is level, no deviant influences oppose it; when perception is unified, all encounters are real. Cut off all deliberation, and the harmony of Heaven will come of itself.\n\n\"Gather in your knowledge, rectify your measure, and spirit will come to dwell. Virtue will become your countenance, the Dao will become your dwelling. Without other knowledge, abiding by constant measure—then spirit will respond without fail, virtue will embrace all, and the Dao will be present everywhere.\n\n\"Bright-eyed as a newly born calf, without seeking its former state—this is called concentrating qi to attain suppleness, seeking only nourishment from the mother, with no other concerns.\n\n\"Form like withered wood, heart-mind like dead ashes—unaware of form as form, heart-mind as heart-mind. Is it withered wood? Dead ashes? Truly, they know reality without distortion, thus they maintain a vast and unfettered state, with no heart-mind to scheme, luminous in all four directions—can they be without knowledge?\n\n\"This is called the formless form, the heart-mindless heart-mind, which cannot be described in appearance or sought in location. Vast and unbounded, it cannot be planned; measured, it attains its singularity in all four directions—can it be without knowledge? This is called true knowledge.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Those who attend to life respond to change and act; change arises from the times, and those who know the times follow no fixed course. They must respond to what comes, adapting to the moment—what is prized is knowing the moment; how could there be a constant way?\n\n\"Thus, the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name. Responding to the times, how could there be a fixed method? Writing arises from words, and words emerge from wisdom—but the wise do not know, for it is not the constant Dao.\n\n\"By 'writing' is meant the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music*; by 'words' are meant the sayings of former kings and sages. All are like straw dogs used in sacrifice—not the constant Dao. The name that can be named is not the one who treasures books.\n\n\"Inscribing on bamboo and silk, engraving on metal and jade—this is the name that can be named. Yet once names arise, there is truth and falsehood. Thus, writing does not convey true names; it is not real.\n\n\"Much learning leads to exhaustion; it is better to guard the center. Much learning exhausts one’s strength; guarding the One requires no labor. Abandon learning and there is no worry; discard sagacity and renounce knowledge, and the people benefit a hundredfold. Cease what is not the Dao, remove ostentation and bias, know and rely on the One Origin—thus there is a hundredfold benefit.\n\n\"Human beings are tranquil at birth—this is Heaven’s nature. Stirred by things, they move—this is the desire of nature. When things arrive and one responds, this is the movement of wisdom. When wisdom engages with things, likes and dislikes arise; when likes and dislikes take shape, wisdom is externalized, and one cannot return to oneself—Heavenly principle is extinguished.\n\n\"Nature is tranquil, but desire moves; when things are sensed, harm follows. Wisdom gives rise to calamity, desire disorders the real; likes and dislikes are born, and gain and loss arise. Unable to reflect and return to true nature, one brings about self-destruction.\n\n\"Therefore, the sage does not exchange Heaven for man, externally transforming with things while inwardly not losing their true state. Thus, those who penetrate the Dao return to clarity and stillness; those who possess the Dao are clear and still. Those who exhaust themselves in things ultimately attain non-action. External things—hence, non-action.\n\n\"Nurture wisdom with tranquility, unite spirit with indifference—then one enters the gateless gate. Wisdom does not arise without stillness; spirit does not respond without quiescence. Response emerges from the gateless gate. One roams the gateless gate, following Heaven and wandering with the Dao—this means guarding emptiness and stillness. Those who follow others exchange with the vulgar—this means clinging to fame and power.\n\n\"Thus, the sage does not disturb Heaven with affairs, does not disorder the true state with desires, does not deliberate yet is fitting, does not speak yet is trusted—like the Heavenly Dao, without intention, like the four seasons, mysteriously attuned. Without thought, they attain; without action, they accomplish. Attainment is not through toiling thought; accomplishment is not through effort.\n\n\"Therefore, though they dwell above, the people do not find them burdensome; though they stand before others, none are harmed. The world turns to them, and the treacherous and perverse fear them—because they do not contend with the myriad things, none dare contend with them. Where utmost virtue extends, the treacherous decline and hide. The myriad people bear them without burden; none in the world dare contend with them.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"When people follow desire and lose their nature, their movements are never upright. With this, to govern a state is to bring chaos; to cultivate the self is to bring defilement. The harm of desire—destroying states and ruining lives—its response is like an echo. How can one not be warned?\n\n\"Thus, those who do not hear the Dao cannot return to their nature; those who do not understand things cannot attain clarity and stillness. Unclear about the principles of the Dao, unenlightened about the conditions of things, they cannot return to the origin and restore simplicity.\n\n\"The original nature of human beings is without depravity or defilement. Long immersed in things, it changes; changed and forgetting its root, it merges with what seems like its nature. The original human nature is utterly still and unaware; stirred by things, it moves—this is desire harming the real, decline obscuring the upright. The deluded do not awaken, taking this as their true nature. If they do not transform throughout their lives, how grievous is this?\n\n\"The nature of water desires clarity, but sand and stone defile it; the nature of human beings desires equilibrium, but cravings and desires harm it. Only the sage can forsake things and return to the self. The nature of water is originally clear—defilement lies in sand and stone. The nature of human beings is originally balanced—harm lies in cravings and desires. Only the sage can forsake things and return to the self.\n\n\"Therefore, the sage does not employ wisdom to enslave things, does not use desire to disturb harmony. Their joy is not exultant, their sorrow is not mournful. *Wū guàn qiē*—taking joy in joy, when joy reaches its extreme, sorrow follows.\"",

      "translated_text": "Those who take sorrow as sorrow never forget their sorrow. Thus, they stand high yet do not peril, rest secure yet do not topple, preserving emptiness and purity—what fear have they of collapse or danger?\n\nTherefore, when good counsel and sound plans are heard, even fools delight in them; when the sagely virtue and lofty conduct are praised, even the unworthy yearn for them. If fools still know to turn toward and admire such things, how much more the worthy and virtuous? Many delight in such words, yet few put them into practice; many admire such ways, yet few walk them. Though those who rejoice and yearn number in the tens of thousands, none advance in cultivation. Why is this? Because they are shackled by things and struck by custom, ensnared by gluttony for flavors and fettered by the shackles of fame and profit.\n\nThus it is said: \"I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I remain without affairs, and the people enrich themselves; I love stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I am without desire, and the people return to simplicity.\" This makes clear that when the ruler models these four principles, governing from above, the people are transformed below.\n\nStillness and purity are the perfection of virtue; softness and weakness are the function of the Dao. Emptiness, tranquility, and joy are the ancestors of the ten thousand things. When these three are practiced, one merges into formlessness—formlessness is called \"the One.\" The One is the mindless union with all under heaven. The One is non-being. It speaks of the formless moving through the world, pervading the ten thousand things without end.\n\nVirtue is spread without exhaustion, employed without toil; no moisture can moisten it, no mind can weary it. It cannot be seen, cannot be heard. So subtle it transcends sound—how could it be heard or seen? From formlessness, form arises; from soundlessness, the five tones resound; from tastelessness, the five flavors take shape; from colorlessness, the five colors emerge. Thus, being arises from non-being, substance from emptiness.\n\nThe number of tones does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five tones cannot be fully heard; the number of flavors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five flavors cannot be fully tasted; the number of colors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five colors cannot be fully seen. Form, sound, color, and flavor all arise from nothing. Tracing them to their fundamental number, they do not exceed five. Yet from these five, endless transformations arise, losing their constancy. Pushed to excess and decadence, they surpass what sight and hearing can fathom, what constant observation can discern.\n\nWhen the tone *gong* is established, the five tones take shape; when sweetness is established, the five flavors are fixed; when whiteness is established, the five colors are formed; when the One is established, the ten thousand things are born. All the above take the One as their foundation. Thus, things attain constancy through the One, and people attain transformation and brilliance through their master. The Dao unifies as One, and the ten thousand things flourish abundantly. Therefore, the principle of the One extends throughout the four seas without difference; the scrutiny of the One pervades heaven and earth.\n\nThose who comprehend the One understand the root of heaven and earth’s creation and the nature of the ten thousand things. In its wholeness, it is thick and uncarved; outwardly, it appears foolish to others. When dispersed, it is vast and turbid, its traces obscured by custom. Though turbid, it gradually clears; though empty, it gradually fills. Turbid yet able to clear, empty yet able to fill. Vast and still like the great sea, boundless and without shore. Drifting like floating clouds, whither does it go? As if non-being yet being, as if perishing yet enduring. Neither non-being nor being, yet able to endure or vanish—this describes the one who embodies the Dao.\n\nLaozi said: \"The sum of the ten thousand things all passes through a single aperture; the root of a hundred affairs all emerges from a single gate.\" The ten thousand things and ten thousand affairs all issue from the gate of manifold subtleties. Thus, the sage follows a single track, never altering its constancy, never changing its regularity, aligning with the plumb line and following the carpenter’s square, bending to accommodate its constancy.\n\nThe sage follows the origin of the great Dao, examining the nature of the ten thousand things, not forcing land-dwellers into the depths or tree-nesters into caves—this is not altering their constancy. Each attaches to what brings ease, all benefiting their nature—this is bending to accommodate its constancy.\n\nJoy and anger are the deviations of the Dao; sorrow and grief are the losses of virtue; likes and dislikes are the transgressions of the heart; cravings and desires are the burdens of life. These eight are what the great man does not dwell in. Great anger shatters *yin*; great joy topples *yang*; thin *qi* brings dimness; terror and fear induce madness; sorrow and grief scorch the heart, giving rise to accumulations of illness. If one can eliminate these five, they align with spirit illumination. These five are the utmost sincerity in cultivating the self.\n\nPeople know to refine gold and smelt stone in pursuit of longevity, yet cannot moderate desires and pacify harmony to preserve their heavenly nature. Moreover, joy and anger arise recklessly—what use are medicinal stones? If one truly grasps this principle, they naturally align with spirit illumination. Spirit illumination is attained internally. Those who attain it internally have peaceful organs, balanced thoughts, keen hearing and sight, and strong sinews and bones.\n\nThose who attain internally embrace emptiness and guard the One, their spirit at ease and thoughts serene—thus their ears and eyes are keen, their sinews and bones strong. Open and unobstructed, they do not contend with things; firm yet not exhausted, they employ softness without lack. Never excessive, never deficient. Desires do not exceed measure, and nothing they do fails to succeed.\n\nNothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet water embodies the Dao. This is a metaphor to convey principle, using water to clarify the Dao. Its breadth cannot be fathomed, its depth cannot be measured; its length extends without end, its reach pervades without limit. Its ebb and flow, increase and decrease surpass all reckoning. Above, it becomes heaven’s rain and dew; below, it becomes earth’s moisture and nourishment. The ten thousand things cannot but live, the hundred affairs cannot but succeed. It embraces all life without partiality, bestowing its blessings even upon the lowliest creatures without seeking repayment. It enriches all under heaven without exhaustion, bestows virtue upon the people without cost. Its course cannot be exhausted, its subtlety cannot be grasped. Struck, it is not wounded; pierced, it is not injured; severed, it is not cut; scorched, it is not burned. Supple and flowing, it cannot be scattered. It penetrates metal and stone, overcomes all under heaven. Abundant or scant, it allows all to take or give. It endows the ten thousand things without precedence or delay, without partiality or impartiality, vast and equal with heaven and earth—this is called utmost virtue.",

How vast is the virtue of water, in harmony with the Dao!\n\nThat which is formless is the great ancestor of things; that which is soundless is the great progenitor of kinds. All things arise from the formless, the five tones emerge from the soundless. Thus the utmost void, though ungiving, gives birth—hence the void is the ancestor and progenitor of things. The Perfected Person, penetrating the numinous treasury, becomes one with the Creator, holding fast to dark virtue in the heart, transforming with spirit-like swiftness. Therefore, the Dao that is not a Dao—how vast and indistinct! Without issuing commands or decrees, it shifts customs and alters mores—this is the work of the heart’s conduct.\n\nAll things have their source yet alone return to their root; all affairs have their origin yet alone guard their gate. Thus one may exhaust the inexhaustible, reach the unreachable, illuminate things without dazzling, respond to echoes without knowing. Within, one attains the unity of the heart; without, one connects with the ten thousand existences. The Dao of submerging and floating transforms like a spirit, its responses boundless—who knows its limit?\n\nLaozi said: \"Those who attain the Dao have wills that are weak yet affairs that are strong, hearts that are empty yet responses that are fitting.\" A weak will is gentle, tranquil, and serene, concealed in non-acquisition, acting in incapacity, tranquil in non-action, moving without missing the moment—this is what it means to attain. The Dao of non-action follows what is fitting for things, moving in accord with the proper time. Thus the noble must take the lowly as its root, the high must take the low as its foundation. Dust gathers to form mountains, streams accumulate to become seas. Entrusting the small to encompass the great, residing within to govern without, acting with softness yet firmness—strength knows no defeat, no enemy can overpower. With an empty heart, one precedes things: though without force, one is strong, and wherever one goes, all is accomplished, none dare encroach or insult. Adapting to transformations and measuring the times, none can harm. Moving in tandem with the Dao, what thing could cause harm?\n\nThose who desire firmness must guard it with softness; those who desire strength must preserve it with weakness. Accumulate softness and it becomes firm; accumulate weakness and it becomes strong. Observe what is accumulated, and you will know survival or ruin. Know firmness, know softness—then virtue is truly cultivated. Know survival, know ruin—then the self will surely flourish. Strength can overcome those weaker than oneself, but when it encounters its equal, it is checked. The strong cannot be overcome, the weak cannot be oppressed—this is the Dao of acting with softness. Softness can overcome those stronger than oneself—its power is immeasurable. Do not lightly scorn, for it may surpass you.\n\nThus when armies are strong, they perish; when wood is hard, it snaps; when leather is stiff, it splits. Those who rely on strength do not preserve their material whole. Teeth are harder than the tongue yet perish first—observing the principle of teeth and tongue, one may discern the Dao of firmness and softness. Thus the firm meets ruin, while the soft obtains wholeness. Therefore, softness and weakness are the pivot of life, while firmness and strength are the companions of death. Circumstances summon one another, and life and death may be verified.\n\nThe one who leads falls into exhaustion; the one who follows reaches the source. Holding to the latter ensures one is not subdued. Those who grasp the Dao to pair with change—whether first or last, each controls the other. How can one fail to master others when others cannot master them? This is to seize the mechanism of transformation, which none can comprehend. Preceding others invites no resistance; following others accords with what is fitting. Mastering both precedence and subsequence, acting and resting in non-action—this is grasping the Dao to pair with change.\n\nThe so-called \"following\" is to harmonize one’s measures with the proper time. When the time changes, there is no gap for even a breath. Preceding it is excessive; following it is insufficient. Affairs have their proper moments, things have their successes and failures, movements in perilous mechanisms allow no pause for a breath. It lies in harmonizing measures and awaiting the time, aiming for the mean without error.\n\nThe sun revolves, the moon orbits—time does not tarry with man. Thus the sage does not value a foot-long jade but treasures an inch of time. Time is hard to obtain yet easily lost, so the sage acts in accord with the time and establishes merit based on resources. The sage does not prize amassing treasures but values preserving the Dao. Cherishing the fleeting light of time, the rare encounter of opportunity—when acting to achieve success, one must not miss the moment.\n\nAbide by the pure Dao, restrain oneself with feminine restraint, follow along and respond to change, always remaining behind and never ahead. Soft and weak in stillness, composed and settled in tranquility—great achievements know no firmness, none can contend with them. Thus embodying purity and stillness, holding to feminine weakness, one attacks the strong under heaven—does this not mean seizing the proper time without contention?\n\nLaozi said: \"When the heart harbors the mechanisms of cunning, even purity and whiteness are not unsullied.\" If scheming and cleverness are not forgotten, the dark Dao grows ever more distant. When numinous virtue is not complete within the self, how can one know what distant harm may befall? Near, one loses the self; far, one loses others.\n\nWhen the heart forgets the desire to harm, even a starving tiger may be tailed—how much more so with people! When the desire to harm is forgotten within, though one treads upon a starving tiger’s tail or stands before a violent man, one will ultimately suffer no harm.\n\nThose who embody the Dao are at ease yet never exhausted; those who attain the governance of the Dao never rest even in death. Those who rely on calculations labor without achievement. Those who exhaust numerological arts labor without benefit.\n\nRuling through harsh laws and punishments is not the work of emperors and kings; frequent use of the whip and rod is not the way to drive far. Excessive punishments breed resentment among the people; frequent whipping makes horses unruly. Excessive likes and dislikes invite calamity to follow—this is the principle of nature.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the laws of the former kings were not what they created but what they followed; their prohibitions and punishments were not what they enacted but what they upheld. They did not rely solely on execution and killing to seek the people’s welfare—expelling the wicked, meting small punishments to admonish great faults, which is the blessing of petty men.\n\nTherefore, following brings greatness, while contriving brings pettiness; upholding brings stability, while acting brings ruin. As when Great Yu governed the waters: he followed the people’s plight, for their suffering could not be endured. He dredged rivers along the mountains, cut channels to guide the flow, rescuing the times and saving from peril, ensuring no harm befell them. How majestic was his success—this was the power of following. When Shang Yang of Qin created laws and altered standards, rewarding those who obeyed the present and punishing those who violated the statutes, in a single day he executed over seven hundred, turning the Wei River red. Later, he himself died by dismemberment—what he harmed was great, what he achieved was small, and what he upheld was not secure. Those who act bring ruin.\n\nRelying on ears and eyes to hear and see wearies the mind yet brings no clarity; governing through cunning and calculation exhausts the heart yet yields no success. If one’s ears and eyes, mind and thoughts are spent, how can one speak of sufficiency? To hear without listening, to see without looking, to act without intention, to succeed without deliberation—this is what the perfected person values.\n\nRelying on the talent of one person is insufficient to achieve perfect governance; the ability of one person cannot manage even three acres of land. If one overreaches, strength is dispersed and cannot suffice. Following the principles of the Dao and the natural order of heaven and earth, even the six directions are not too vast to harmonize. By adapting to what is fitting and measuring one’s strength, even the vastness of the six directions can be balanced, and the multitude of the ten thousand things can be thoroughly mastered.\n\nHearing is misled by praise and blame, confused by likes and dislikes. The eyes are seduced by colors and beauty; ritual and propriety are insufficient to restrain desire, but sincerity of heart can embrace what is distant. Words and rites cannot guard against transgression, but the heart alone can illuminate the subtle.\n\nThus, no weapon is sharper than the will, yet *Mo Ye* and *Po Ya* are inferior; no enemy is greater than yin and yang, yet war drums are trivial. The so-called great enemy leaves corpses without restraint; the middling enemy hides in the mountains; the petty enemy lurks among the people. The five weapons are but the dregs of the Dao. Yin and yang are the greatest enemies—this is the Dao. *Mo Ye*, *Po Ya*, drums, and gongs have form and sharpness, sound and might. The supreme Dao has no sharpness yet can sever, no might yet can subdue. Thus, though *Mo Ye* is sharp, the Dao is inferior to it; though drums retain their sound, they are trivial beside the Dao.\n\nYin and yang are the love and aversion of male and female. Wherever desire for profit arises, the heart follows emotion, and in the space between acceptance and rejection, there must be the peril of life and death. Thus, the great enemy hides in the breast, and the petty enemy lurks among the people. Therefore, the perfected person is cautious within and restrained without.\n\nThus it is said: when the people abound in cleverness and skill, strange things proliferate; when laws and decrees multiply, thieves and bandits increase. Abandoning one to take the other prevents heavenly calamity from arising. Governing a state with excessive laws brings chaos to the people—chaos is the omen of ruin. Governing the self with excessive rules wearies the body—weariness is the sign of decay. Abandoning that cleverness and those laws, embracing this clarity and stillness, heavenly calamity naturally ceases.\n\nThus, governing a state with cleverness is the state’s bane; not governing a state with cleverness is the state’s virtue. The perfected person sees cleverness as a bane; the worldly see it as virtue. Using it brings harm; not using it brings blessing.\n\nThe formless is great; the formed is small. The formless is many; the formed is few. The formless is strong; the formed is weak. The formless is solid; the formed is hollow. Where there is great and small, there is many and few; where there is few, form is small—this is the smallness of the formed. Where there is no great or small, there is no many or few. Where there is no few, there is no form—this is the greatness of the formless.\n\nThe great and small, many and few, strong and weak, solid and hollow—all arise from this. The formed is the completion of affairs; it originates from the formless, whose name cannot be known. Following things, it is named the completion of affairs. The formless is the beginning of creation; the completion of affairs is the making of vessels. The beginning is simplicity; simplicity scatters and becomes vessels.\n\nThe formed has sound; the formless has no sound. The formed is born of the formless—thus, the formless is the beginning of the formed. The Dao is not nothing; what is born is something. Through birth, one awakens to the Dao; when the body exists, there is nothingness. Thus, sound emerges without inquiry; form exists with a beginning.\n\nVastness and thickness have names—what has a name is prized for its wholeness. This speaks of the named as the name of the nameless, not seeking a name. If one seeks a name, how can wholeness be prized? Frugality and thinness have no name—what has no name is base and light. This speaks of the nameless not as the name of the nameless, but as one who cuts oneself off in ignorance, not knowing the name of the great Dao.\n\nAbundance and wealth have names—what has a name is honored and cherished. Poverty and scarcity have no name—what has no name is lowly and despised. With the Dao, one is honored; without the Dao, one is disgraced. The male has a name—what has a name is manifest and bright. The female has no name—what has no name is hidden and subtle. If not for the use of the male, how could the name be whole? If not for embracing the female, how could the nameless be whole? Obscurity and clarity, concealment and display—all rest in my having or lacking, my abiding or stagnating.\n\nSurplus has a name—what has a name is exalted and wise. Deficiency has no name—what has no name is tasked with the lowly. Not prizing one’s name is surplus; not exalting oneself yet being exalted is not wisdom. Not cultivating one’s name is deficiency; not lowering oneself yet being lowly is folly.\n\nMerit brings a name; lack of merit brings no name. The Dao does not respond in vain. The named is born of the nameless—the nameless is the mother of the named. Thus, the Dao gives rise to being and non-being, difficulty and ease complete each other.\n\nBeing does not arise from being but is born of non-being. Difficulty does not arise from difficulty but is completed through ease. Knowing that being is insufficient, one must guard the mother to preserve the child.",

      "translated_text": "Purity and sincerity—purity is clarity, sincerity is trust. Sincerity is heaven’s nature; purity is man’s clarity. Sincerity is upheld by the will, clarity is distinguished by discernment. Without the utmost sincerity under heaven, how could one fully realize the natures of all beings and unite with heaven and earth’s virtue? Thus it is said: without purity and sincerity, one cannot move others—this is what it means.\n\nLaozi said: Heaven attains its height, earth attains its depth; the sun shines, the stars gleam; yin and yang harmonize—not through deliberate action. What is achieved by non-action arises not from desire. Align with the Dao, and things naturally follow. When the ruler rectifies himself, the people are transformed as if by spirit; the teaching of no words has no equal.\n\nThe four seasons and yin-yang do not generate the myriad things; timely rain and dew do not nourish grasses and trees. Yet when spirit and clarity connect, when yin and yang harmonize, the myriad things are born. When heaven and earth are harmonious and at peace, when spirit and clarity intermingle and descend—this is not a matter of intention. The four seasons cannot but follow their course, and the myriad things cannot but be born.\n\nThe Dao conceals purity within, harbors spirit in the heart, abides in stillness and tranquility, delights in harmony within the breast. Vast and formless, silent and soundless—this is how the sage embraces heaven’s heart, bestows virtue, and nurtures the Dao. Inwardly, spirit is stored; outwardly, no trace of beings appears. Without omen or sign, how could there be form or sound?\n\nGovernment offices are as if empty of affairs; the court is as if empty of people. There are no harsh policies, no flatterers, no recluses, no idle folk. The court is filled with loyal and steadfast men, the wilderness holds no hidden worthies. There are no corvée labors, no unjust punishments; the people are employed in season, laws are applied without excess.\n\nUnder heaven, none do not look up to the ruler’s virtue, emulate the sovereign’s intent. Even distant lands and foreign customs, none do not come through repeated translation. The ruler possesses the Dao, and the people rely on his virtue. His influence extends to the eight directions, flowing even to alien customs. It is not that he visits every household in person—he merely extends his sincere heart to all under heaven. Thus, though distant peoples and foreign customs come to submit, it is not that the ruler visits each home himself; rather, his sincere heart issues forth, and distant peoples naturally arrive.\n\nThus, rewarding the good and punishing the violent is proper governance, but what enables it to be carried out is purity and sincerity. Though commands may be clear, they cannot act alone—they must await purity and sincerity. Purity is clarity; sincerity is trust. Without clarity and trust, none can reward the good and punish the evil.\n\nTherefore, when the Dao is universally applied yet the people do not follow, it is because purity and sincerity have not reached them. As when Yu attacked the Miao, they did not submit, and he withdrew—only when he danced with shields and feathers did the Miao come to terms. This was the power of purity and sincerity.\n\nLaozi said: Heaven establishes the sun’s brightness, arrays the stars, extends the four seasons, regulates yin and yang. By day it exposes things, by night it lets them rest; the wind dries them, rain and dew moisten them. In generating things, none see how they are nourished, yet the myriad things grow. In destroying things, none see how they perish, yet the myriad things die—this is called spirit and clarity. The Dao of heaven operates in hiddenness; it is difficult to express in words.\n\nWhen things are born, it is their time, and they cannot but be born. When things die, it is their time, and they cannot but die. Thus, the living align with life, the dead align with death. Therefore, the living do not thank heaven, the dead do not resent the Dao—it is simply natural. This is what is meant by spirit and clarity.\n\nThus, the sage emulates this. When fortune arises, none see how it begins; when misfortune is removed, none see its cause. It cannot be traced, yet it is not false. Above, it was said that heaven follows the Dao; here, it is said that the sage follows heaven. Heaven’s life and death correspond to the ruler’s rewards and punishments. \"Fortune arising\" refers to employing the worthy; \"misfortune removed\" refers to eliminating the evil. The evil cannot but be punished; the worthy cannot but be advanced. Thus, the worthy advance of themselves, not because I advance them; the violent are punished of themselves, not because I punish them. Therefore, fortune does not arise from me, nor does misfortune originate from me. None know its source; none see its form.\n\nDaily reckoning seems insufficient, but yearly reckoning shows surplus. The sage does not scheme over trifles; daily use may seem inadequate, but yearly accounting shows abundance. Silent and soundless, a single word stirs all under heaven—this is how heaven’s heart moves and transforms.\n\nWhen the sage is still, all under heaven is silent. When he moves, the myriad things return to him. Thus, Gaozong did not speak for three years, yet when he spoke, his words were revered. Such was the case.\n\nThus, purity and sincerity take form within, moving heaven. Auspicious stars appear, yellow dragons descend, phoenixes arrive, sweet springs flow, fine grains grow. Rivers do not overflow, seas do not surge—this is how the sage embodies the Dao and nurtures beings. Only virtue moves heaven. Issuing from the heart, it responds above to heaven. Thus, dragons and phoenixes soar and gather; rivers and seas become clear and still. Without pure sincerity, how could this be achieved?\n\nTo defy heaven and harm beings brings solar and lunar eclipses, wandering stars, seasons out of joint, days darkened and nights lit, mountains collapsing and rivers drying, winter thunder and summer frost. Heaven and man communicate thus. Above, it was shown how heaven responds with auspicious omens; here, it is shown how defiance brings calamity and disaster.\n\nThus, know that misfortune and fortune have no fixed gate—they are summoned by man. Heaven and man communicate; qi and kindred types resonate—this cannot be mistaken. Therefore, when a state is about to perish, celestial signs change, customs grow chaotic, rainbows appear. All things are interconnected; pure qi presses upon one another. When perverse qi prevails, calamities transform beings, responding with misfortune.\n\nThus, the sage examines his own person and understands the myriad kinds. Diligent and cautious, he dares not be negligent. He would rather align above with heaven’s heart to pacify the black-haired people than dare to be remiss. Therefore, matters of spirit and clarity cannot be achieved by cleverness or force. Spirit and clarity are upright—how could they tolerate deceit and falsity?",

      "translated_text": "Should one never depart from their fundamental source, what could they not accomplish? Death and life share the same domain, and none can coerce or oppress them. Never departing from their source means the mind merges with the Dao, the body equalizes with transformations—where could they not go, what could they not achieve? Death and life are already dissolved; how could they be coerced or oppressed?\n\nMoreover, to govern heaven and earth, to encompass the myriad things, to return to the workings of creation, and to contain perfect harmony—this is to have never died. The Dao models itself on heaven and earth, embraces yin and exhales yang, distributes the five agents, and envelops the ten thousand kinds. Alone, it operates above the potter’s wheel of creation, circulating beyond the bounds of transformation—it has never been born, so who could speak of its death?\n\nSincerity takes form within and outwardly resonates in the hearts of others—this is the untransmitted Dao. This speaks of nurturing sincerity within and externally moving others; can it be transmitted? When the sage resides above, embracing the Dao without speaking, his beneficence extends to the myriad people. Thus, the teaching without words is vast indeed.\n\nWhen ruler and minister diverge in heart, deceit and treachery manifest in heaven, and the correspondence of spirit and qi is evident—this is called the eloquence of the wordless, the Dao of the unspoken. The supreme Dao is without speech; its mysterious workings do not dominate. Therefore, when ruler and minister preserve one another, chanting and extolling virtue, it reaches heaven above and communicates in secret with the spirits. The eloquence of the wordless, the Dao of the unspoken—these are what they attain.\n\nTo summon the distant, let there be non-action; to draw near, let speech be without affairs. The height and remoteness of heaven can only be moved by non-action to respond, and by non-affairs to be made close. Only those who walk in the night can attain this—walking in the night means diligent practice, like traveling at night, not yet reaching the destination, yet accompanying the journey without ceasing. Thus, the spirit is inwardly aroused and ascends to heaven.\n\nTherefore, dismiss the galloping horse to manure the fields—\"dismiss\" means to cease. The \"horse\" is the heart. The heart, like a runaway horse, is difficult to control. People all gallop after their hearts, chasing distant fame and profit to glorify themselves. I, however, do not act thus: I cease the galloping of my heart, preserving emptiness and stillness to nourish my person.\n\nWhen the tracks of chariots do not reach beyond distant lands, this is called \"sitting in motion and sinking into obscurity.\" To arrive without traveling is called \"sitting in motion\"; to remain hidden without emerging is called \"sinking into obscurity.\" The Way of heaven is impartial in approach and departure; the capable have abundance, the inept fall short. The Way of heaven is impartial: those with virtue it approaches, those without it departs.\n\nObserve how choosing this and abandoning that involves partiality, yet when forsaking evil and embracing good, the principle aligns with nature. Without desire, there is abundance; with desire, there is insufficiency. Following it brings benefit; opposing it brings misfortune. Only through impartiality and non-action is there neither benefit nor merit.\n\nThus, those who govern with cunning find it difficult to maintain the state—this was already explained in the previous section. Only those who harmonize with the great harmony and uphold natural responsiveness can possess it. Only by preserving the great harmony and naturally responding can one attain it.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao and virtue are like rawhide and leather—distance makes them seem near, closeness makes them seem far. Scrutiny finds nothing, yet investigation is not in vain. Rawhide and leather form a drum: strike it, and it responds. The Dao and virtue sustain the person: employ them, and they function. The resonance is inexhaustible, the spiritual transformation boundless. Thus, examination finds nothing, yet investigation is not in vain.\n\nTherefore, the sage is like a mirror: neither advancing nor retreating, responding without concealing. The myriad things do not harm him; his heart is like a mirror, reflecting all without omission. He does not seek to illuminate by approaching things but constantly reflects and responds to them. No image escapes; what harm could come from encounters?\n\nWhat is gained is thereby lost; what is lost is thereby gained. Gain and loss reveal insubstantiality; without gain or loss, there is true unity. Thus, one who penetrates the great harmony is dim as if drunk, sweetly reclining and roaming within it—never having departed from their source, this is called great penetration. Embracing the Dao and containing harmony, forgetting form and relinquishing burdens, like drinking fine wine, delighting in its midst, merging indistinguishably—this is the great Dao. This is the use of non-use to accomplish its function. This is awakening to the Dao through non-birth, like forgetting form through drunkenness.\n\nLaozi said: In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor governed the world by harmonizing the movements of the sun and moon, regulating the qi of yin and yang, moderating the measures of the four seasons, rectifying the calculations of pitch pipes and calendars, distinguishing male and female, clarifying superior and inferior, ensuring the strong did not oppress the weak, and the many did not tyrannize the few. The people preserved their lives without premature death; the years were abundant without famine. The hundred officials were upright and impartial; superiors and inferiors were harmonious without blame. Laws and commands were clear and not obscure; assistants were just and not obsequious. Farmers yielded boundaries; roads were free of lost items; markets did not engage in speculative pricing. Thus, at that time, the sun, moon, and stars did not deviate from their courses; wind and rain came in season; the five grains flourished; phoenixes soared in the courtyards, and qilin roamed the outskirts. Such was the Yellow Emperor’s governance of the world through the Dao, and the transformation through virtue.\n\nFuxi ruled the world resting his head on stone and sleeping on ropes, killing in autumn and executing in winter, bearing the square earth and embracing the round heaven, embraced by yin and yang. Where stagnation and blockage did not flow, the qi of obstructed principles and perverse things that harmed the people and accumulated excessively were cut off. His people were like unlearned children, not knowing east from west, their vision dim, their steps faltering, yet content and self-assured, unaware of their drifting, floating without knowing their origin, nurturing themselves without knowing where to go.\n\nAt that time, birds, beasts, insects, and snakes all sheathed their claws and fangs, concealed their stings and poisons. Though they harbored the nature of venom and sting, they had no intent to harm—such was the reach of supreme virtue.",

Inwardly obscure yet outwardly compliant, concealing essence to nurture the true, acting without contrivance while remaining untouched by external defilements—thus, the Dao disperses and becomes *de*, and *de* overflows into *ren* and *yi*. Yet once *ren* and *yi* are established, the Dao and *de* are abandoned. What was once pure essence scatters, leaving only dregs.\n\nLaozi said: When the spirit scatters, words become florid; when *de* dissipates, conduct becomes false. When the utmost essence is obscured within, yet words and actions are scrutinized without, one cannot avoid being enslaved by things. When inner essence overflows, external embellishments arise; when the mind is ensnared by affairs, how can the body escape harm? Essence may be exhausted, but actions know no end; if what one preserves is unstable, one becomes externally entangled in worldly customs. If inner preservation is unsteady, one reaches a dead end and sinks into mire; if external pursuits never cease, one is perpetually tormented by storms and waves. Therefore, the sage cultivates the arts of the Dao within and does not outwardly adorn himself with *ren* and *yi*. He understands the proper use of the nine apertures and four limbs, yet roams in the harmony of spirit—this is the sage’s wandering.\n\nThe sage inwardly guards the true essence while outwardly responding to things as they are; thus, he attains the harmony of spirit and roams in the boundless. Laozi said: As for the sage’s wandering, he moves in perfect emptiness, his mind roams in the great void, gallops beyond the four directions, acts without gateways, listens without sound, and sees without form. Unconstrained by the world, unbound by custom—moving in perfect emptiness, there is nothing he does not penetrate; roaming in the great void, there is nothing he does not possess. What gate or door could confine him? How could sight or hearing be clouded? Thus, what the sage employs to move the world is not what the True Person surpasses, and what the worthy use to correct世俗 is not what the sage observes. The traces of the True and the sagely differ, their achievements and undertakings diverge—like ancestral sacrifices and kitchen duties, each attends to their proper place.\n\nThose bound by世俗 must manifest their form and dissipate their spirit, and thus cannot escape entanglement. None who dwell in glory and prominence avoid enslavement of the spirit; having received their emoluments, they must also bear their burdens. If I can be fettered, it is because my fate lies beyond myself. Once shackled, my fate is no longer mine.\n\nLaozi said: When the ruler’s thoughts do not scatter in his breast, nor his wisdom extend beyond the four domains; when he cherishes a heart of benevolence and sincerity, sweet rains fall in season, the five grains flourish, spring brings growth, summer brings maturity, autumn brings harvest, winter brings storage, and monthly reviews and seasonal assessments culminate in annual tribute—such is the ruler with the Dao. He does not exhaust his spirit in deliberation nor flaunt his wisdom and ability, yet distant lands are drawn to him. Thus, he aligns above with the heart of heaven and below with the proper order of things, and the myriad people offer their allegiance, their tribute unceasing. He nurtures the people with impartiality, his majesty is awe-inspiring yet not harsh, his laws are few and punishments lenient. Transformation occurs as if by spirit, laws are broad and penalties mild, prisons stand empty, the world shares a single custom, and none harbor treacherous hearts—this is the sage’s grace.\n\nImpartial yet not selfish, majestic yet not fierce, laws concise and punishments mild, people follow his transformation—this may be called the utmost spirit. Thus, all directions are united, diverse customs follow a single path—this is the sage’s grace in governing the world. If those above covet without measure, those below will vie for merit without restraint; the people grow impoverished and distressed, disputes arise, toil yields no fruit, cunning and deceit sprout, and bandits and thieves proliferate. Above and below resent one another, decrees go unheeded. The aforementioned conditions are not how the sage governs the world. To rule thus is to court ruin without delay.\n\nWhen water is turbid, fish gasp; when governance is harsh, the people rebel. When those above are full of desires, those below are full of deceit; when those above are restless, those below are unsettled; when those above make many demands, those below contend with one another. To neglect the root and seek remedy at the branches is no different from digging a channel to stop water or carrying firewood to extinguish a fire. Grasping the root to govern the branches yields effortless success and a well-ordered world; clinging to the branches to seek the root brings labor to the self and chaos to the world—like trying to stop overflowing water by digging channels or quell a raging fire by adding fuel, it cannot be saved.\n\nThe sage’s affairs are few yet well-ordered, his demands are few yet sufficient. Without acting, he is benevolent; without speaking, he is trusted; without seeking, he obtains; without striving, he accomplishes. Embracing the natural, preserving the utmost true, holding to the Dao and extending sincerity, the world follows him as echo follows sound, as shadow follows form—what he cultivates is the root. The principle of the utmost sage lies in simplicity and ease, and thus the world reveres him, responding like echo to sound, like shadow to form—none fail to answer.\n\nLaozi said: When the spirit scatters outward and wisdom and deliberation dissipate within, one cannot govern. When the uses of form and spirit extend too far, what is neglected lies close at hand. Pursuing what is not one’s portion and indulging without restraint injures the spirit within and abandons the body without. Thus, one who does not step beyond the door yet knows the world, who does not peer through the window yet knows the Way of heaven— the farther he ventures, the less he knows. This speaks of sincerity issuing from within and spirit and qi moving heaven.\n\nGrasping the essentials to observe the world, the sentiments of people can be discerned. Holding the jade pivot to observe the great movements, the Way of heaven can be illuminated. When sincere words issue from within, essence and qi respond to heaven. What one guards is near, yet what one illuminates is distant; the more one busies oneself, the less one knows.",

If what one holds is not illuminated, how can one know whether what I call knowledge is not ignorance? If what one preserves is not clear, how can one know the Dao?\n\nThis is to know that the knower does not fail to know the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: The yang of winter’s sun, the yin of summer’s shade—things turn to them without being driven to excess. This is the spontaneous arrival of utmost refinement, unsummoned yet come, departing without going. In the profound and obscure, though one knows not how it is done, success is achieved of itself.\n\nThe yang of winter’s sun—those who are cold draw near. The yin of summer’s shade—those who are scorched find relief. Thus the sage governs the world: yin and yang are without sentiment, and the sage too is without sentiment. Things embrace of themselves, people return of themselves. Thus they come without being summoned, depart without being sent away.\n\nTo await the eye before seeing, to await speech before issuing commands—governance becomes difficult. Gaoyao was mute yet served as Grand Judge, and the world knew no cruel punishments—what need was there for words? Shikuang was blind yet served as Grand Minister, and the state of Jin knew no disorder—what need was there for sight? The command that requires no speech, the vision that requires no seeing—this is how the sage becomes a teacher.\n\nTo transform without speaking, so that below there are no cruel punishments—why trouble with words? To govern without seeing, so that Jin knows no disorder—what need is there for sight? Thus, without awaiting the eye to see, without needing speech to command—this is how the sage becomes a teacher.\n\nThe people’s transformation by their superior does not follow his words but follows his conduct. In high antiquity, one acted without speaking; in later ages, one speaks without acting. Thus when a ruler favors valor, though he does not incite strife, the state will face many crises, and gradually there will arise the chaos of robbery and murder. When a ruler favors beauty, though he does not encourage licentious talk, the state will fall into darkness and disorder, and over time there will come the calamity of debauchery and ruin.\n\nThe people’s transformation by their superior is like water flowing downward. One must block the source and be vigilant in small matters. Thus Duke Zhuang of Qin suffered the disaster of forced abdication, and Jie of Xia brought about the chaos of Daji. Therefore the sage refines sincerity within and clarifies likes and dislikes without. His words match his feelings, his decrees make his intent clear. Within, there is no partiality; without, there is no favoritism or aversion. Words issue and echoes respond; commands go forth and the wind carries them.\n\nThus punishments are not enough to shift customs, executions are not enough to suppress villainy. One may transform through virtue, but it is difficult to control through penalties. Only spiritual transformation is precious. Utmost refinement is spirit. Where refinement moves, it is like the qi of spring giving life or the qi of autumn bringing death. In life, it is warm as spring things receiving their growth. In death, it is solemn as autumn things reaching their end.\n\nThus in life there is no seeking of reward, in death no harboring of resentment. Life and death come from its being without intent. Therefore the noble person is like an archer: here, a hair’s breadth; there, a span’s mark. Thus one who governs others must be cautious in how he influences them.\n\nTherefore the noble person governing others is like an archer: when the arrow is loosed, he aims for the target, and when it reaches the butt, he measures the span’s mark. A deviation of a hair’s breadth is as distant as heaven from earth.\n\nLaozi said: To hang laws and set rewards yet fail to shift customs and change habits is because sincerity is not embraced. Laws cannot restrain the people; only utmost virtue can transform customs. Thus by listening to their music one knows their customs; by observing their music one knows their manners; by seeing their manners one knows their transformation.\n\nExamine the sound to know the music, examine the music to know the governance, observe the governance to know the customs, observe the customs to know the transformation. One who embraces truth and offers sincerity moves heaven and earth, and spirits transcend beyond the four directions. Commands are obeyed and prohibitions observed. Sincerity penetrates the Way and conveys its intent. Though not a word is spoken, the myriad people of the world, birds and beasts, ghosts and spirits, all change with him.\n\nThus the sage’s governance of the world: the people follow his transformation as if rolling a ball. To forbid villainy and error is like halting a square object. Therefore, with virtue that does not rely on force, with teachings that require no words, even birds and beasts, spirits and ghosts, have none who are not pleased and submissive—how much more so for people?\n\nThus the highest is spiritual transformation, returning to spontaneity. Next is enabling people not to do wrong, establishing laws to regulate. The lowest is rewarding the worthy and punishing the violent. When the Way and virtue are abandoned, rewards and punishments begin. When the path to advancing the worthy is opened, the unworthy also find places. When their positions are lost, the seeds of violence arise, and even the worthy may suffer execution.\n\nThus one knows that without clear laws, those who uphold them become excessive; without an even balance, those who use it become weak.\n\nLaozi said: The great Way is non-action. Non-action is non-possession. One who does not possess does not abide. One who does not abide dwells in formlessness. One who is formless does not move. One who does not move does not speak. One who does not speak is still and without sound or form. Without sound or form, it cannot be seen when looked at, cannot be heard when listened to. This is called the subtle and wondrous, the utmost spirit. Continuous as if existing—this is called the root of heaven and earth.\n\nNon-action is acting without reliance, thus it is called non-action. No speech is speaking without pride, thus it is called no sound. Without form, what is there to hear? Without color, what is there to see? This may be called spiritually subtle. Standing alone without change, continuous and ever-present—it is the root of heaven and earth.\n\nThe Way is without form or sound, thus the sage forcibly gives it form, using a single word to name the Way of heaven and earth. This speaks of grasping the essentials of the Way. The great takes the small as its root, the many take the few as their beginning. Being arises from non-being, the many arise from the one.\n\nTracing back to the origin returns to formlessness; pursuing the branches leads to confusion by multiplicity. Thus knowing to return takes non-being as its foundation; sensing multiplicity seeks the one as its master.\n\nThe Son of Heaven takes heaven and earth as his standard—this speaks of their vastness. He takes the myriad things as his resources—there is nothing he does not possess. His merit and virtue are utmost, his power and name are most noble. The beauty of these two virtues matches heaven and earth. Thus he cannot but follow the great Way as the mother of the world.\n\nFrom the honor of the four seas to matching heaven and earth—how could he not follow it to avoid disorder? This is the heavenly constant.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: Relieving poverty and aiding the urgent brings forth fame and profit, yet one should not practice petty kindness. Removing harm is where merit is accomplished. Not claiming merit as one’s own—this is goodness.\n\nWhen the world knows no disasters or harms, even sages have no virtue to apply; when superiors and inferiors are in harmony, even the worthy have no merit to establish. When disasters arise, sages pacify them; when a state falls into calamity and chaos, the worthy settle it. Yet if disasters do not arise and chaos does not stir, even sages have no throne from which to act as sages, and even the worthy have no ground on which to establish merit.\n\nThus the governance of the perfected person embraces virtue and holds to the Dao, extending sincerity and delighting in bestowal. With boundless wisdom, they rest in silence and do not speak, and none in the world know the value of their non-speaking. They drum their bellies and strike the earth, unaware of the emperor’s power.\n\nThus the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name. The Dao without name is the utmost Dao; the Dao with name is the name of the world. Therefore, the Dao that can be spoken is not the Dao; the name that can be named is not the name.\n\nThat which is inscribed on bamboo and silk, carved into metal and stone, and transmitted to others—all these are but its coarse aspects, flowery and overly adorned. The Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, and Three Kings followed different affairs yet shared the same heart, took different paths yet reached the same destination. Though their words differed and their governance varied with the times, their return to the Dao was one.\n\nScholars of the latter age do not know that the Dao is embodied in unity, that virtue gathers in essentials. They seize upon the immediacy of accomplished matters, kneel and sit to discourse upon them—though learned and widely informed, they cannot escape disorder. Scholars of today do not trace back to the root, do not embody the essentials, do not investigate the principle, but instead follow the traces, striving for broad knowledge, only adding to the chaos.\n\nLaozi said: The essence of the heart can work spiritual transformations but cannot be spoken of as the Dao. Its spiritual transformations cannot be explained as non-Dao. The sage does not descend from his seat yet rectifies the world, his care surpassing even a shout. A shout can be heard, but only by a few; when a decree is issued, the whole world submits.\n\nThus when words are the same, trust lies before the words; when commands are the same, sincerity lies beyond the command. Sharing the people’s sorrows, words reach trust, for trust is established beforehand—none dare not respond. Sharing the people’s benefits, commands are carried out with sincerity, for sincerity arises externally—none dare disobey.\n\nWhen the sage is above, the people are transformed as if by spirit, for sentiment precedes them. Grasping their intent, responses come as if by spirit. If one acts above yet receives no response below, it is because sentiment and decree diverge. The hungry seek food, the cold long for fur. If one gives fur to the hungry and food to the cold, the decree is already contrary—how can the people’s sentiment attach to it?\n\nA three-month-old infant knows not of benefit or harm, yet the loving mother’s care grows ever more earnest—this is sentiment. The heart of a newborn child does not speak of hunger or fullness, yet the compassionate mother observes its signs, discerns its dryness or dampness, and nurtures it with kindness. If the ruler of men cherishes the hundred clans as he loves a newborn child, what worry is there that the world will not be governed, that the four seas will not be at peace?\n\nThus the use of words brings change—change in small matters. The use of non-words brings change—change in great matters. Words that speak of words are small; words that speak of no-words are great. Trusting a noble person’s words, being loyal to a noble person’s intent, loyalty and trust take shape within and move responses without—this is the transformation of the worthy and sage.\n\nLoyalty and trust arise from the noble person’s original intent, not from forgetfulness. Thus when they take shape within and move without, even the worthy and sage cannot but follow.\n\nLaozi said: A son’s death for his father, a minister’s death for his lord—these are not acts of seeking fame through death. The heart’s kindness is stored within, and they do not shirk from difficulty. A son dies for his father’s peril, a minister dies for his lord’s peril—not to feign virtue for the world’s praise, but because kindness covers them so deeply that they forget themselves, rushing straight into peril. Their sincerity arises from within.\n\nThe noble person’s sorrow is not for outward correctness but arises from within. One must examine their conduct.",

      "translated_text": "Sorrow and distress refer to penal law. Execution and punishment are not the proper Way. They are employed only to punish evil and encourage good, as a last resort, and must not be wantonly applied. The sage feels no shame before the sun and moon; the noble do not commit wrongdoing. The noble person is cautious in solitude, meaning they do not deceive even in darkness and seclusion. To abandon what is near and seek what is distant is to invite obstruction. To neglect self-cultivation while demanding it of others is to invite blockage.\n\nThus when the sage is in high position, the people delight in their governance; when in low position, the people admire their intent, for their resolve never wavers from desiring to benefit others. With their resolve set on benefiting others, all people rejoice and admire them.\n\nLaozi said: When a brave warrior lets out a single cry, the entire army retreats—such is the power of his sincerity. A single shout from the brave strikes terror into ten thousand. The worthy govern the age, and all under heaven look to them. If one sings and none respond, or offers counsel and none bear it, there must be discord within. For their principles differ from others’. One who corrects all under heaven without leaving their seat seeks the cause within themselves. When joy and sorrow are shared with the people, and likes and dislikes are aligned with them, then by examining oneself, one can transform others.\n\nThus where persuasion does not reach, one’s demeanor does; though it may not convey the subtlest essence, it can approximate one’s bearing. Where demeanor does not reach, subtle influence does—arising from the heart and taking form, it moves through spiritual resonance, not through outward appearance. The utmost refinement can be perceived through form, yet cannot be forced into clarity. Though form arises from the formless, the purest essence gives birth to all forms, making them manifest. One does not seek refinement, yet refinement resides within.\n\nLaozi said: Words have their source, affairs have their root. Lose the source and root, and no matter how many skills one possesses, it is better to speak little. Take the Dao as the source and virtue as the root; depart from them, and abundance is no match for simplicity. To harm the many, Yu the craftsman would sever his own finger to demonstrate that great skill cannot be forced. True skill resides in the heart, not in the fingers—cutting off what cannot be attained. When the Dao is in the heart, clarity does not depend on grand words. To value words as if they were the Dao is to hope in vain for the Dao.\n\nThus the craftsman’s wisdom lies not in their ability but in knowing when to close. The craftsman—an artisan—closes with skill, for the most adept know how to seal tightly, so none can open. The unskilled rely solely on brute force, and though strong, they will inevitably fail. This illustrates the exhaustion of subtle wisdom, for strength alone is insufficient.\n\nLaozi said: The sage’s undertakings may follow different paths, yet they converge in the same end. Though past and present differ, governance remains the same. Preservation and ruin, stability and collapse—if one’s resolve never wavers from desiring to benefit others, then the ruined are preserved, the collapsed are stabilized. Is this concern only for oneself? It is always for the benefit of others.\n\nThus the songs of Qin, Chu, Yan, and Wei differ in sound yet all express joy; the wails of the Nine Yi and Eight Di differ in sound yet all convey sorrow. Song is the manifestation of joy, weeping the expression of sorrow—concealed within, it emerges without, and thus the means of moving others. Sound and breath resonate, sorrow and joy summon one another. Therefore, though songs differ by nation, all share in joy; though wails vary by region, all share in grief.\n\nThe sage’s heart never ceases, day or night, from desiring to benefit others. The reach of their virtue is thus vast. By unceasingly benefiting others, their influence extends far and wide.\n\nLaozi said: When people act without contrivance, there is governance. To act is to harm the governance of non-action. To practice non-action is to act; those who cannot act without contrivance cannot truly act. To speak of non-action is still to act; to act is to depart from the governance of non-action. Only by acting without acting is there true non-action.\n\nWhen people remain silent, the spirit speaks—yet to cling to silence harms the spirit’s true nature. The spirit values silence; even the sage does not force speech. Words reveal traces, actions reveal the coarse. Only when both are unharmed can the Dao be preserved whole.\n\nWenzi said: A name can be forcibly established, merit can be forcibly achieved—this is the way of encouragement. Formerly, Nanrong Chu, a disciple of Laozi, felt shame that the sagely Dao was absent within himself. He traveled south to see Laozi and received a single teaching. His spirit became enlightened, and though he endured hardship and toil, fasting for ten days, he savored the Dao as if feasting on the finest delicacies. Having received a single teaching, he meditated for ten days, forgetting hunger and tasting the Dao as if enjoying a grand banquet.\n\nThus his wisdom illuminated all within the seas, his name endured through later generations, his intelligence and strategy spanned heaven and earth, his discernment was as keen as distinguishing autumn down. His praises and eloquent words continue unceasing to this day—this is what it means for a name to be forcibly established. The ultimate teaching, once received, dissolves all doubts like the sun’s reflection illuminating a dark room.\n\nThus the farmer who does not exert himself will not fill his granary; the official who does not strive will not refine their sincerity; the general and minister who do not exert themselves will not achieve great deeds; the king and lord who are indolent will leave no name for posterity. From commoners to kings and lords, none have filled their granaries or made their names illustrious without diligence and effort.\n\nThe perfected person acts in concealment, like thunder hidden away. They act in accordance with the times, establish merit through available resources, advance and retreat without difficulty, and nothing is impassable. The great person’s Dao is hidden and still—none under heaven can perceive their actions. Yet when thunder strikes, none under heaven fail to hear it. They advance without elation, retreat without shame—this is the great Dao.\n\nThe perfected person’s essence and sincerity take form within, their virtue flowing to the four directions. Seeing benefit for all under heaven, they rejoice yet do not forget the harm that may befall them, trembling as if in mourning. They welcome benefit yet fear encountering harm. One who sorrows with the people’s sorrow will have the people sorrow with their sorrow; one who rejoices with the people’s joy will have the people rejoice with their joy. Thus to sorrow with all under heaven and rejoice with all under heaven—yet fail to become king—has never been.",

A son dies for his father’s peril, a minister dies for his lord’s peril—not to feign virtue for the world’s praise, but because kindness covers them so deeply that they forget themselves, rushing straight into peril. Their sincerity arises from within.\n\nThe noble person’s sorrow is not for outward correctness but arises from within. One must examine their conduct.",

      "translated_text": "To sorrow with the people is to have the people sorrow with you; to rejoice with the people is to have the people rejoice with you. One who shares sorrow and joy with the people yet fails to win their allegiance has never been.\n\nThe sage’s law begins where it cannot be seen and ends where it cannot be reached. Their virtue and righteousness know no bounds, their beginning and end no limits. They dwell in unshakable ground, stand where non-action prevails. They amass from inexhaustible granaries, using without depletion; they draw from unfailing treasuries, circulating without end.\n\nTheir decrees flow like the source of a river, guiding the people to offices of no contention. When commands are issued, the people know the prohibitions; when affairs are simplified, officials have no disputes. They open doors that must be entered, secure the people in their occupations. They do not attempt what cannot be accomplished, do not seek what cannot be obtained, do not dwell where they cannot endure, do not act where they cannot recover.\n\nThe great person’s decrees bring only benefit when enacted, and what they establish endures. They do not dwell where they cannot last, do not seek what cannot be regained. The great person enacts governance that brings joy, and none fail to follow their commands. When commands are obeyed, one advances from small to great; when commands are defied, good becomes harm and success becomes failure.\n\nIn their governance and teaching, obedience turns misfortune to fortune, while defiance reduces the great to the small. The one called a true great person is inwardly strong and outwardly luminous—internally as steadfast as heaven and earth, externally as radiant as sun and moon. Heaven and earth cover and bear all, sun and moon illuminate all. To be like heaven and earth in covering and bearing, like sun and moon in illumination—this is the true great person.\n\nThe great person shows goodness to others without altering their fundamental ways, without changing their constant principles. All under heaven follow their commands as grass bends to the wind. To alter the fundamentals unsettles customs; to follow nature makes the people easy to govern. Grass bends to the wind—none dare defy it.\n\nWhen governance errs in spring, Jupiter waxes and wanes, abandoning its regular path. When governance errs in summer, Mars moves in reverse. When governance errs in autumn, Venus appears where it should not, its movements erratic. When governance errs in winter, Mercury fails to appear in its proper place. When the four seasons lose their order, Saturn sways unsteadily, the sun and moon display omens, the five planets move in chaos, and comets appear. When the seasons are disordered and the five planets lose their regularity, celestial omens appear in the heavens, and disaster befalls humanity.\n\nIf spring governance is not lost, millet and grain flourish; if summer governance is not lost, rain falls in season; if autumn governance is not lost, the people prosper; if winter governance is not lost, the state enjoys peace and well-being. Thus the enlightened ruler must not lose proper governance. When the ruler loses governance, heaven sends down a hundred calamities. When the ruler upholds governance, heaven sends down a hundred blessings. The joy of one becomes the joy of ten thousand.",

      "translated_text": "**The Nine Guardians**\n\nThis chapter contains nine sections, hence the title *The Nine Guardians*. Nine is the culminating number of the *Yi*. When clarity reaches its limit, change occurs, and change leads to deviation from the Dao. Those who guard it abide in stillness—like the dragon at its zenith, free from regret—and may transcend the Three Pure Realms. Those who neglect it, like a barren mare, will sink beneath the Nine Dark Abysses. Thus, one must guard the Dao and never lose constancy.\n\nLaozi said: Before heaven and earth took form, all was dark and indistinct, merged as one, the qi and its manifestations undivided. Silent and limpid, the heavy and turbid settled as earth, the refined and subtle rose as heaven—thus were shapes and substances established. Separating, they became the four seasons: spring’s birth, summer’s growth, autumn’s harvest, winter’s storage. Dividing, they became yin and yang, and hardness and softness were set forth. Refined qi became humans, coarse qi became creatures. Their origin is one, yet their endowment differs; qi has purity and turbidity, things have refinement and coarseness. Through the interplay of hardness and softness, the myriad things are born. From this, transformations extend endlessly.\n\nSpirit and essence derive from heaven; bones and flesh root in earth. That which derives from heaven inclines upward; that which derives from earth inclines downward. When spirit enters its gate and bones return to their root, what remains of me? Entering the gate of the boundless, returning to the root of creation, who, if not utterly sincere in their truth, can claim a self? Thus, the sage models heaven and follows earth, unbound by custom, unenticed by others. Heaven is their father, earth their mother; yin and yang their warp, the four seasons their weft. Soaring between heaven and earth, they tread the warp and weft, roaming in the realm of self-attainment, dwelling in the abode of non-action. Custom cannot bind them, the world cannot entice them.\n\nHeaven is still and clear; earth is settled and tranquil. The myriad things that oppose them perish; those that accord with them live. Heaven has no intent regarding opposition or accord—yet humans bring upon themselves calamity and ruin. Thus, stillness and silence are the dwelling of spirit and clarity; emptiness and nothingness are the abode of the Dao. The Dao resides in quietude; spirit wanders in the utmost void.\n\nSpirit and essence are received from heaven; bones and flesh are endowed by earth. Heaven’s qi, clear and transformative, becomes spirit; earth’s qi, heavy and congealing, becomes bones and flesh—hence the term \"endowment.\" The Dao gives birth to the One: heaven. The One gives birth to the Two: earth. The Two give birth to the Three: humanity. The Three give birth to the myriad things. Their transformations are vast. The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, harmonized by the qi between them. All are softened and harmonized by qi.\n\nLaozi said: Humans receive the transformations of heaven and earth and are born between them, dwelling above the myriad things. In the first month, the essence congeals. In the second, blood and vessels form, and the embryo’s shape appears. In the third, the embryo takes form, and the residence of spirit is fixed. In the fourth, the fetus develops; in the fifth, the sinews; in the sixth, the bones; in the seventh, the form is complete, and the orifices open, granting clarity. In the eighth, movement begins, and spirit descends with its numinous power. In the ninth, restlessness arises as the palaces and chambers arrange themselves to secure the essence. In the tenth, birth occurs, and the myriad images are complete.\n\nOnce the physical form is fully shaped, the five viscera divide. The liver governs the eyes, the kidneys the ears, the spleen the tongue, the lungs the nose, and the gallbladder the mouth. Here, only four viscera are mentioned—modern accounts differ, and the details remain unclear. The exterior is the surface; the interior is the core. The head is round, modeling heaven; the feet are square, resembling earth. A single human body encompasses the myriad images—it must not be treated lightly.\n\nHeaven has four seasons, five phases, nine luminaries, and three hundred sixty days; humans have four limbs, five viscera, nine orifices, and three hundred sixty joints. Heaven has wind, rain, cold, and heat; humans have taking and giving, joy and anger. The gallbladder corresponds to clouds, the lungs to qi, the spleen to wind, the kidneys to rain, and the liver to thunder. Humans resemble heaven and earth, with the heart as their master.\n\nThe heart governs the body, overseeing the five viscera, six bowels, four limbs, and nine orifices. Above, it connects to heaven; below, it responds to earth; in between, it harmonizes with the myriad things. This is what is called \"spirit.\" The common people use it daily yet do not know it; those who understand this Dao are few.\n\nThe ears and eyes are the sun and moon; blood and qi are wind and rain. When the sun and moon lose their course, they dim and eclipse; when wind and rain are untimely, they destroy and bring disaster. Heaven has sun and moon, which must not be dim; wind and rain, which must be regulated. When they are untimely or unregulated, disaster follows. Humans have ears and eyes, which must be clear; blood and vessels, which must be balanced. When they are disharmonious or unbalanced, illness arises.\n\nWhen the five stars lose their course, the states and regions suffer their misfortune. Where the five stars trespass, the corresponding lands endure calamity. When the five viscera are afflicted by evil, the whole body falls ill. The Dao of heaven and earth is vast and great, yet it still regulates its brilliance and cherishes its spirit and clarity. How can human ears and eyes endure constant stimulation without rest, or spirit and essence gallop without exhaustion?\n\nHeaven and earth, though vast, regulate the four seasons and harmonize the five planets, protecting their spirit and clarity. How much more so for humans, who employ their ears and eyes and let their hearts and thoughts race—can they preserve their nature and spirit? Thus, the sage guards the inner and does not lose the outer, preserving spirit within and protecting the physical form without.\n\nBlood and qi are humanity’s splendor; the five viscera are humanity’s essence. When blood and qi focus inward and do not stray outward, the chest and abdomen are full, and desires diminish. Observing the surface reveals the interior; seeing the root reveals the branch. When desires arise within, splendor fades without; when essence and qi harmonize within, the flesh and skin flourish without.\n\nWhen desires are few, the ears and eyes are clear, and hearing and sight are keen—this is called \"clarity.\" Clarity leaves nothing unperceived; brightness leaves nothing unilluminated. All arise from restraining passions and cutting off desires. When the five viscera remain aligned with the heart and do not stray, qi and intent prevail, and conduct is not perverse. When spirit is abundant and qi does not scatter, hearing leaves nothing unheard, sight leaves nothing unseen, and nothing is left unaccomplished.\n\nBy rightly settling the heart, the five viscera remain free from evil, wayward qi disperses, and the function of spirit and essence becomes bright. Nothing subtle is left unilluminated, nothing hidden is left unexamined, no affair is left unfinished, and no task is left unaccomplished.",

      "translated_text": "Troubles and misfortunes have no means to enter, and wayward qi cannot invade. In movement and action, constancy in rectitude ensures calamities vanish of themselves. When inner essence does not dissipate, external evils cannot penetrate. Thus, those who seek much gain little, and those who perceive broadly know narrowly. To seek abundance from scarcity, to infer the great from the small—this is clarity.\n\nThe orifices are the doors and windows of spirit; blood and qi are the messengers and sentinels of the five viscera. Open the doors and windows, and spirit becomes luminous, its dark mirror bright; unobstruct the messengers, and the five viscera flow freely, free from disorder. When ears and eyes are indulgent in sounds and sights, the five viscera tremble and cannot settle, blood and qi surge and do not rest, spirit gallops and does not abide. Though blessings and misfortunes arrive like mountains, there is no means to perceive them.\n\nBewildered by sounds and sights, one enslaves the spirit, forgetting both self and other. Like still water, where even a hair’s breadth is visible, when one is obscured, even mountain-like calamities go unseen. Thus, the sage cherishes without transgressing; though desires may flow, they are ever restrained and regulated, never seeking what lies beyond. If the sage ensures ears and eyes are keen and profoundly penetrating, free from allure and longing, intent and qi unerring in clarity, with few desires, the five viscera find peace. Spirit guards within the form without straying, and one may observe beyond past ages, within future affairs, and between fortune and misfortune—all becomes fully visible.\n\nThe sage knows that desires obscure and obstruct clarity, so they unify heart and qi to halt disorder, guard spirit without transgression, and thus the truths of inner and outer become visible, the omens of fortune and misfortune naturally clear. Therefore, the farther one strays, the less one knows. Chasing distant things, prizing the near and valuing the self—what is discarded is great, what is gained is small. This speaks to spirit: it must not be allowed to stray outward. The five colors confuse the eyes, rendering them unclear; the five tones enter the ears, dulling their acuity; the five flavors disorder the mouth, causing sores and decay.\n\nExternal desires bring internal harm. Pursuits and aversions disturb the heart, making conduct reckless. Desires cause qi to overflow, likes and dislikes exhaust the essence. If not swiftly abandoned, aspiration and qi daily diminish. When essence and qi leak away, form and spirit daily fade. The reason people cannot fulfill their natural lifespan is their excessive indulgence in life. \"Excessive indulgence\" means insatiable craving, seeking only gratification—truly, self-estrangement.\n\nOnly those who do not treat life as paramount attain longevity. Not treating life as paramount means not indulging excessively; not indulging excessively means not dwelling in places of certain death. Heaven and earth move and interpenetrate; the myriad things converge as one. To know the One is to know all; not to know the One is to know nothing. From heaven and earth to the myriad things, endless cycles all ride upon the One, giving rise to the ten thousand kinds. Though diverse, they share a root in the One. Thus, to know the myriad things as One is to comprehend all principles; not to know them as One is to fail in every encounter.\n\nI dwell in the world as one thing among things—yet things are also things. How can things be distinguished from one another? This reveals the profound unity of self and other, where preferences and aversions have no ground. Thus, I dwell in the world as but one thing among the world’s things. Being of the same kind, how can they be distinguished? When self and other are both forgotten, right and wrong dissolve, and the blade glides through emptiness—this is the great mastery of preserving the true.\n\nDesire for life cannot be served; aversion to death cannot be refused. Desires cannot be indulged, affairs cannot be multiplied. The lowly cannot be despised, nor the noble rejoiced in. Nobility and baseness find their proper place—where then lie likes and dislikes? Follow one’s endowment and find tranquility, daring not to exceed. Not exceeding, one attains the utmost joy.\n\nThis passage summarizes the Nine Guardians as the utmost sincerity for governing the state and cultivating the self. Those who turn toward the Dao should carefully ponder its essence.\n\n**The Nine Guardians of Unity**\nLaozi said: The so-called sage accords with the times and finds peace in their position, delights in their work amid the age. What others find uneasy, they make supremely peaceful; what others find joyless, they make supremely joyful. Grief and joy are deviations of virtue; likes and dislikes are burdens of the heart; pleasure and anger are transgressions of the Dao. The common person has them; the Daoist does not. In life, they follow the movement of heaven; in death, they transform with things. Life is not mine to possess—thus it is called \"heaven’s movement.\" Death is not my end—thus it is called \"transformation with things.\"\n\nAt rest, they unite with yin in virtue; in motion, they harmonize with yang in its current—this is movement and stillness without losing their rectitude. The heart is the life of the form; spirit is the treasure of the heart. Spirit is the abode of the heart, what people hold most precious. When the form labors without rest, it withers; when essence is used without cease, it depletes. Thus, the sage honors this and dares not transgress. The form is the dwelling of spirit; essence is the numen of qi. They depend on one another to preside; if they part, death follows. The sage values them and dares not use them lightly.\n\nResponding to being with non-being, one must exhaust its principles; receiving the full with emptiness, one must fathom its limits. The myriad things arise from nothing, and nothing is not possessed. Heaven and earth receive with emptiness, and nothing is not contained. Serene, joyful, empty, and still, one fulfills their mandate. Preserving emptiness and stillness, one penetrates life and death. Nothing is estranged, nothing is favored. In nobility, one is not favored; in baseness, one is not estranged. Embracing virtue and kindling harmony, one accords with heaven, joins with the Dao as their boundary, and neighbors with virtue. They do not initiate fortune, nor precede calamity. Death and life bring no change to them—thus they are called \"utterly spirit-like.\"\n\nAccordant with the Dao and virtue, equal in death and life, fortune cannot aid them, nor calamity overthrow them. If not utterly spirit-like, how could one be thus?",
      "overlap_context": " do not stray, qi and intent prevail, and conduct is not perverse. When spirit is abundant and qi does not scatter, hearing leaves nothing unheard, sight leaves nothing unseen, and nothing is left unaccomplished.\n\nBy rightly settling the heart, the five viscera remain free from evil, wayward qi disperses, and the function of spirit and essence becomes bright. Nothing subtle is left unilluminated, nothing hidden is left unexamined, no affair is left unfinished, and no task is left unaccomplished.",

      "translated_text": "The spirit-like attains all it seeks and accomplishes all it undertakes. Able to align with the Dao of heaven and earth, to unite in virtue with the numinous, whatever it seeks is attained, whatever it does is accomplished—this may be called \"utterly spirit-like.\" Abiding in nothingness, Laozi said: \"Lightening the world, the spirit remains unburdened; refining the myriad things, the mind is not deluded. If one does not treat the world as a thief of the myriad things, how can the spirit be burdened? If one is not a thief of the myriad things, how can the mind be deceived?\"\n\nEqualizing life and death, the will is not cowed; harmonizing with transformation, clarity is not dazzled. Knowing that life and death are but provisional names, one is not terrified; recognizing that transformation is but empty illusion, one is not startled. The perfected person leans upon an unshakable pillar, walks an unbounded path—the unshakable pillar is the Dao, the unbounded path is virtue. With the Dao as their pillar, they do not topple; with virtue as their path, all destinations are fitting.\n\nDrawing from an inexhaustible storehouse, the spirit’s use is limitless. Learning from an undying teacher, their foundation is non-arising. There is nowhere they do not succeed, nothing they do not penetrate. In bending and stretching, bowing and rising, they embrace their mandate without confusion, navigating fortune and misfortune with ease. Profit and harm cannot trouble their heart; life and death do not press upon them—how could profit and harm weigh upon their mind?\n\nThose who uphold righteousness may be pressed by benevolence but cannot be coerced by force; those who preserve righteousness may be exhorted by the Way of benevolence but cannot be threatened by military might. They may be guided by righteousness but cannot be lured by profit—valuing righteousness, they disdain profit. The noble person dies for righteousness and cannot be detained by wealth or honor; they would rather tread the path of righteousness unto death than live in ignoble prosperity. Those who act for righteousness cannot be frightened by death, for they die for righteousness and forget life—how much more so for those who practice non-action?\n\nThe non-acting are without burden; the unburdened take the world as a shadow pillar—a shadow pillar is emptiness and nothingness. Devoid of form and substance, where can burdens cling? If those who preserve righteousness cannot be threatened by force, how much less can those who embody the Dao be frightened by death?\n\nGazing upward at the ranks of the perfected, deeply tracing the intent of the Dao and virtue, and examining below the conduct of the vulgar world, one finds ample cause for advancement. To advance is to progress. Observing the past and present, embracing the Dao and guarding virtue, deeply understanding the purport—this is sufficient for cultivation.\n\nThose who do not treat the world as their own are like striking a drum to silence it. The rulers of high antiquity, without exception, took the world as their own, not contemplating the ultimate Dao, acting with blatant self-interest—they were like one who beats a drum seeking silence, yet no response comes.\n\nLaozi said: \"High rank and great profit are what people covet, yet compared to the self, they are base. Those who value rank esteem the world and belittle the self. Those who cultivate the Dao treasure the self and disdain wealth. Thus, the sage eats enough to fill the void and join qi, wears enough to cover the body and ward off cold, satisfies their nature and rejects excess, neither coveting gain nor hoarding abundance, content with sufficiency and discarding the surplus.\n\n\"With eyes clear, they do not see; with ears still, they do not hear; with mouth closed, they do not speak; with mind released, they do not ponder. They discard cleverness and return to primal simplicity, rest the spirit and abandon knowledge, without likes or dislikes—this is called 'great penetration.' To remove defilement and cast off burdens, nothing surpasses never having departed from one’s origin. What could not be accomplished? Never having departed from one’s origin means abiding in original emptiness and quiescence, without craving or attachment—thus the myriad entanglements, all defilements and burdens, arise. Therefore, to dispel and cleanse, return to the origin and restore simplicity.\n\n\"Those who know the harmony of nurturing life cannot be lured by profit; those who align the inner and outer tokens cannot be enticed by power. Coveting profit harms life; yearning for the world obstructs the Dao—these are what the perfected do not do. The outer of the without-outer is supremely great; the inner of the without-inner is supremely noble. Able to know the great and noble, where do they not succeed? The great Dao emerges without outer, enters without inner—nothing it does not penetrate, and this may be called 'supremely noble.'\"\n\nLaozi said: \"The ancients who embodied the Dao ordered their nature and emotions, governed their mind and techniques, nurtured them with harmony, and maintained them with suitability. Delighting in the Dao, they forgot baseness; content in virtue, they forgot poverty. Attaining the harmony of nature and emotions, they forgot the distinctions of poverty and lowliness.\n\n\"Nature has what it does not desire; without desire, nothing is unattained. The heart has what it does not delight in; without delight, all that suits is achieved. With desire, what is desired is never enough; without delight, all that is fitting is fulfilled. What does not benefit nature is not used to burden virtue; what does not aid life is not used to disturb harmony. Fame and profit harm virtue; cravings and desires injure life—thus they are not pursued.\n\n\"Not indulging the self or giving free rein to desires, yet their standards can serve as models for the world. Naturally able to be reverent and cautious, they may serve as exemplars. Eating according to the belly’s measure, clothing according to the body’s form, dwelling to shelter the self, acting to suit the emotions, possessing the world without claiming it, entrusting the myriad things without profiting from them—how could they lose their nature and life over poverty or wealth, nobility or baseness? Those who are thus may be said to embody the Dao.\n\n\"Only those who embody the Dao and know contentment possess the world in surplus without profiting from the myriad things—how could they follow desires and harm their nature and life?\"\n\nLaozi said: \"People receive qi from heaven—the ears and eyes in relation to sounds and sights, the nose and mouth in relation to fragrances and odors, the skin and flesh in relation to cold and warmth—their nature is one. Noble and base share this. Some die, some live; some become noble persons, some petty persons—the means by which they are governed differ. What they desire is the same; what they attain is different. Following the heart’s desires, they are controlled by things.\n\n\"Nature has worthy and foolish, emotions have thick and thin. Thus some are noble, some base; some die, some live—it is not uniform. The spirit is the abyss of wisdom; when the spirit is clear, wisdom is bright, and nothing is left unreflected. Wisdom is the storehouse of the heart; when wisdom is impartial, the heart is level.\"",

Entrusting ministers is the path of peril and decline, for political power lies with men, and peril and decline have no fixed day.\n\nHonoring the worthy is the root of folly and bewilderment, for when the ruler honors the worthy, those beneath him will distort their nature to conform. Those who distort their nature are not true to their essence, hence the saying: \"folly and bewilderment.\"\n\nFollowing the Dao of Heaven is the Way to govern the cosmos. The Way of ruling the world is to align with Heaven’s movement. To be empty and tranquil is the foundation—empty, so as not to receive; tranquil, so as to hold. By upholding purity and stillness, one can sustain the world and become its sovereign.\n\nKnowing the Way of emptiness and tranquility, one may achieve both beginning and end. Therefore, the Sage rules through stillness and is undone by action. Those who remain in stillness have minds unperturbed; those who govern rightly thus prevent the world from chaos.\n\nHence it is said:\nDo not disturb, do not entangle—\nand all things will naturally clarify.\nDo not alarm, do not terrify—\nand all things will naturally settle.\nThis is called the Dao of Heaven.\n\nDisturbance is agitation; alarm is disorder.\nTo speak of the Way to govern the people thus,\nthen all the myriad folk and myriad things will not lose their place.\n\n**On Guarding Weakness:**\nLaozi said:\nThe Son of Heaven, princes, and dukes\ntreat the world and a single state as their home,\nand all things as their livestock.\nWith the vastness of the world in their embrace,\nand the abundance of all things,\ntheir *qi* becomes overbearing, and their wills grow arrogant.\nThey boast of their greatness—\nthough great, they must perish;\nthey fear their peril—\nthough perilous, they may endure.\n\nThe great act with military force against the small,\nwhile the small defy and oppress those beneath them.\nThose who rely on strength perish,\nand those who oppress others are extinguished.\n\nIf one’s heart is extravagant and broad,\nit is like a gusting wind or violent rain—\nunable to last long.\n\nThe Sage knows that strength and violence cannot endure,\nthus he governs with Dao and virtue,\nholding to the One without action,\nand does not harm the natural flow of *qi*.\nOnly the Sage understands that strength and violence cannot last,\nso he restrains them with virtue and power,\naligning with the natural inclinations of love and dislike—\nthus the harmonious *qi* is unharmed, and great peace is attained.\n\nTo see the small and uphold the weak,\nto retreat without leaving traces,\nis the way to avoid ruin and achieve grandeur.\n\nModel oneself after the rivers and seas:\nthe rivers and seas do not force their way,\nso their achievements and renown naturally manifest.\nThey do not rely on strength,\nso they can fulfill their sovereignty.\nThe Sage’s virtue is not seized,\nand all things come to him naturally.\n\nAs the female principle of Heaven,\nhe endures without death.\nThe Sage’s spirit—\nunclouded in the Nine Abysses,\nunfading in the Three Purities—\noriginates from the boundless beginning,\nhow could it have an end?\n\nHe cherishes himself,\nso his nobility is complete.\nThe might of a thousand chariots,\nwith all things as his achievements and renown,\nholds the heaviest of responsibilities—\nhe cannot treat himself lightly.\nTo treat oneself lightly is to lose one’s achievements and renown.\n\nThe Dao of the Sage is vast,\nyet it completes itself through the small,\nand abundant through the few.\nThe Dao achieves the great through the small,\nand all things follow the multitude while revering the One.\n\nThus, the Sage governs the world with the Dao:\nthe weak, gentle, and subtle—\nthis is seeing the small.\nThe frugal and restrained—\nthis is seeing the few.\nSeeing the small, he achieves the great;\nseeing the few, he fulfills the perfect.\n\nHe who holds the world\ndoes not abandon the ministers of small states,\nso he achieves the great.\nHe who governs himself\ndoes not discard even a fragment of good,\nso he attains perfection.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven\npresses down the high and raises the low,\nreduces the surplus and supplements the deficient.\nHeaven’s Dao abhors excess while favoring humility,\nso the rivers and seas occupy the world’s lowly places,\nand thus all things return to them and revere them.\n\nThe Sage practices humility, purity, and stillness,\ndeclining honors—\nthis is seeing the low.\nThe rivers and seas regard vast capacity as their greatness,\nand the Sage regards humility as supreme.\n\nTo be empty of the heart and without possession—\nthis is seeing insufficiency.\nSeeing the low, one attains the high;\nseeing insufficiency, one fulfills one’s worth.\n\nThe proud cannot endure;\nthe extravagant cannot last;\nthe forceful and rigid perish;\nthe full and self-satisfied are doomed.\nThose who preserve emptiness and weakness endure long,\nwhile the proud and extravagant meet swift ruin.\n\nGusting winds and violent rains do not last a day,\nsmall valleys cannot remain full even for a moment.\nGusting winds and violent rains embody the *qi* of forcefulness,\nso they cannot endure and are extinguished.\nSmall valleys occupy the land of the forceful,\nso they cannot help but be seized.\n\nThus, the Sage holds to the female principle,\nrejecting extravagance and arrogance,\ndaring not to act with the *qi* of forcefulness.\nBy holding to the female principle,\nhe establishes his masculine sovereignty.\nBy not daring to be extravagant or arrogant,\nhe endures long.\n\nOnly when a man does not indulge in arrogance,\nholding to the female principle while embodying the masculine,\ndoes he become the King of the Many Heroes.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe Dao of Heaven reaches its extreme and turns back;\nexcess leads to depletion.\nThe sun and moon are examples of this.\nThus, the Sage daily diminishes himself,\nso his natural *qi* does not dare to be full.\nHe daily advances with the female principle,\nand his virtue and merit do not decline—\nthis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nHeaven’s Dao abhors excess while favoring humility,\nso the Tang and Yu followed it and became great men.\nThe Dao abhors violence and forbids arrogance,\nso Jie and Zhou disregarded it and met ruin.\n\nHuman nature and inclinations\nall favor the high and abhor the low,\nfavor gain and abhor loss,\nfavor profit and abhor harm,\nfavor honor and abhor disgrace,\nfavor nobility and abhor meanness.\nThe common folk act thus,\nso they cannot achieve greatness.\nTo grasp thus is to lose what one seeks.\n\nTherefore, the Sage follows Heaven:\nhe does not act yet achieves,\nhe does not grasp yet attains.\nThe common folk follow convention,\nfavoring high and honor,\nabhorring low and disgrace,\nso they seek to be high yet cannot elevate themselves.\n\nThe Sage follows Heaven,\nneither favoring high and honor\nnor abhorring low and disgrace,\nso he is not honored yet is

subtle interplay of words and principles,\none awakens to the Dao and forgets the words—\nthis is indeed profound.\n\nLaozi says:\nThe Dao is most exalted, without surpassing above,\nmost profound, without limit below.\nAbove, it transcends the highest;\nbelow, it reaches the lowest—\nthus it can be both lofty and profound,\nascending and descending.\n\nLevel as the plumb-line, straight as the square.\nIt is not the balance that makes it level,\nyet there is no place not even.\nIt is not the square that makes it straight,\nyet there is no place not upright.\n\nRound as the compass, square as the carpenter’s rule—\nit is not roundness that makes it round,\nyet there is no roundness;\nit is not squareness that makes it square,\nyet there is no square.\n\nIt encompasses Heaven and Earth,\nyet has no exterior or interior.\nIts greatness knows no outer bound,\nits subtlety knows no inner void.\nPiercing as a covering, yet unobstructed—\nthe great circle has no edge,\nthe great passage has no hindrance.\n\nThus, those who embody the Dao:\nneither angry nor joyful,\nsitting without care,\nsleeping without dreams,\nseeing things yet naming them not,\nactions arising yet responding naturally.\n*(As previously explained.)*\n\nLaozi says:\nThose who cling to fame as a corpse\nmust generate affairs—\nwhen affairs arise, they abandon the public for the private.\nThose who cling to fame as a master\nmust have affairs—\nwhen affairs arise, they lose harmony.\nThus, abandon fame and seek harmony.\n\nTo double the Dao and trust oneself,\nto see praise and act virtuously,\nto stand and be called \"accomplished\"—\n*double* means to betray.\nBetraying the Dao to seek praise is not true joy.\nConforming to trends to gain fame is not true virtue.\n\nIf governance does not align with principle,\nand actions do not follow the times,\ngovernance misaligned with principle brings many reproaches,\nactions misaligned with the times yield no merit.\nTo align with principle is to use little effort yet achieve great deeds;\nto ride the times is to expend much force yet see little gain.\n\nTo contrive for centrality—\nwhen success is achieved, it is insufficient to fulfill obligations,\nwhen failure occurs, it brings ruin to oneself.\nThose who seek fame and immediate results,\nwho pursue harmony with the times—\ntheir undertakings are unfinished,\ntheir failures extend to themselves.\n\nLaozi says:\nDo not be a corpse of fame,\ndo not be a treasury of schemes,\ndo not be a burden of affairs,\ndo not be a master of cleverness.\nHide in the formless,\nact without weariness.\nDo not precede blessings,\ndo not initiate calamities.\nMove without taking the lead—\nthen there is no form,\nand no form means no welcome of fortune.\nRespond only when called—\nthen there is no weariness,\nand no weariness means no future calamities.\n\nBegin in the formless,\nact only when unavoidable.\nTo desire blessings first is to invite calamities;\nto seek profit first is to court harm.\nTo govern before signs appear is to invite blessings;\nto cut off extraordinary gains is to avoid harm.\n\nThus, those who act without action yet find peace—\nif they lose what they rest in, they become perilous.\nThose who govern without action yet rule—\nif they lose what they govern, they bring chaos.\nTo lose what one rests in means\nabandoning inner peace to seek it externally—\nthen one is constrained.\nTo lose what one governs means\nforsaking oneself to govern others—\nthen one is deluded.\n\nThus, do not be like jade, polished and coveted,\nnor like stone, rejected and ignored.\nFor jade and stone have their distinctions,\nyet contention arises from them.\nThe finest carvings strip the skin,\nthe most beautiful horns bring slaughter.\nSweet springs will dry up,\nstraight trees will be felled.\nThings of beauty invite harm,\npeople who crave fame summon misfortune.\n\nFine words bring later regret—\nfirst to adorn speech,\nthen to invite ruin upon oneself.\nMountains yield jade, yet their peaks are scarred;\nmountains that hide treasure are dug up.\nPeople who speak carelessly invite calamities.\nThe commoner’s woes begin with idle words.\n\nMoreover, the virtuous must be cautious—\neven then, they have threefold silence.\nThe petty-minded, with their loose tongues,\nhow can they avoid disaster?\n\nLaozi says:\nThe times move, and actions follow—\nthose who do not know Dao turn blessings into calamities.\nPeople follow the times in their actions,\nyet those who do not know Dao perish in their blessings.\n\nThe sage governs through the Dao:\nknowing beforehand life and death,\nmeasuring beforehand gain and loss.\nThus, expanding or contracting is without fixed form,\nhonor and disgrace do not disturb—\nonly then does one attain completion,\nand good fortune preserves the body.\n\nAs for the ignorant,\nthey often receive blessings yet act tyrannically—\nthus, when blessings reach their peak, calamities arise.\nIt is not that blessings and calamities cancel each other,\nbut that their actions are misaligned with their use.\n\nHeaven is the covering, Earth is the axle—\nthose who skillfully use the Dao will never be exhausted.\nEarth as the axle, Heaven as the covering—\nthose who skillfully use the Dao will never be harmed.\nTo use Earth as the axle is to cover without limit, all beneficent.\nTo use Heaven as the covering is to move without end, yet cause no harm.\n\nThe Five Phases are arranged—\neach has its victor:\nMetal and Fire attack each other.\nThe King of Chu succeeded in turn.\n\nWhat Heaven covers is without exception,\nHeaven’s Dao is vast and all-inclusive.\n\nThus, to know without knowing is superior,\nto not know while knowing is illness.\nTo know the unknown is virtue,\nto not know while knowing is folly.\n\nLaozi says:\nMountains produce metal,\nstones produce jade—\nyet they erode each other.\nTrees breed worms,\nwhich devour them.\nPeople create affairs,\nwhich destroy themselves.\nFame brings the Dao’s decline,\nundertakings invite harm.\n\nThose who love affairs never fail to be entangled,\nthose who seek profit never fail to be exhausted.\nNo one crosses water without wetting their feet,\nno one walks in dust without staining their body.\nSkilled swimmers drown,\nskilled riders fall—\neach perishes by their own inclination.\n\nBoasting of ability destroys their merit,\nflaunting strength destroys their lives.\nIt must be so.\n\nSuccess lies in timing, not in struggle,\ngovernance lies in the Dao, not in the sage.\nTiming is naturally obtained,\nno need for forced contention.\nThe Dao lies in self-respect—\nwhy bother with boasting of wisdom?\n\nEarth dwells low yet does not vie for height,\nthus it is stable and not perilous.\nWater flows downward yet does not compete for speed,\nthus it departs and is not delayed.\n\nWhat makes the Dao precious,\nwhat the virtuous hold in esteem—\nis to be high without contending,\nto be swift without haste.\n\nThus, the sage holds nothing fast and so loses nothing,\nacts without action and so meets no defeat.\nThe Dao has no form or shape,\ncannot be grasped—\nto seize it is to lose it.\nIt is not a physical body,\ncannot be carved—\nto force it is to fail.\n\nLaozi says:\nOne word cannot be exhausted,\ntwo words make the world’s foundation,\nthree words make the feudal lords mighty,\nfour words make the world’s pairs.\n\nSincerity and trust cannot be exhausted,\nvirtue and Dao make the world’s foundation,\npromoting the worthy makes the feudal lords mighty,\nhating the few and loving the many makes the world’s pairs.",

while failing to practice it—this is misfortune.\n\nTherefore, the Way cannot be advanced to seek fame,\nbut can be withdrawn to cultivate the self.\nThus, the Sage does not act to seek fame,\nnor does he display knowledge to gain praise.\nGovernance follows natural order,\nand he remains uninvolved in external affairs.\n\nTo advance without embellishing wisdom to seek fame,\nto withdraw and cultivate the self to govern oneself—\nto push matters along naturally,\nhow could one seek human praise?\n\nThe doer may fail to succeed,\nthe seeker may fail to obtain,\nwhile humans may reach their limits,\nthe Way remains unobstructed.\n\nHumans may seek without attaining the Way,\nbut non-action (*wuwei*) suffices to encompass all.\n\nWith wisdom yet without action, one’s efficacy equals that of the unwisely;\nwith ability yet without exertion, one’s virtue equals that of the incapable.\nHaving wisdom yet appearing unwisely,\nhaving ability yet appearing unable—\nwhen the Dao is realized, human talent is extinguished.\n\nThe Sage’s supreme virtue fills within,\nwhile human talent vanishes without—\nthus, having yet appearing as lacking,\nsubstantial yet seeming empty.\n\nHumans and the Way cannot both be manifest;\nif humans love fame, they will not use the Way.\nIf the Way surpasses humans, fame will cease;\nif the Way ceases, human fame will flourish—then danger and ruin follow.\n\nThe Way must be unified;\naffairs cannot be fully dual.\nLaozi says:\nTo let honest men divide wealth,\nit is better to fix portions by casting lots—\nwhy?\nThose with intent in leveling wealth\nare inferior to those without intent.\n\nTo let virtuous men guard wealth,\nit is better to seal the doors and keep it intact—\nfor those with desires among the common folk\nare inferior to those without desires.\n\nCasting lots resolves doubt through non-intent,\nwhile the common folk are constrained by desire.\n\nIf one’s flaws are exposed, resentment arises;\nif one’s ugliness is reflected, one will improve.\nThe wise, when their faults are pointed out, reflect and amend.\nThe foolish, self-praising, claim goodness.\n\nIf one interacts with others without entangling oneself,\none avoids burdens.\nPrioritizing others over oneself,\none will never incur blame.\n\nLaozi says:\nWhen dealing with people,\none does not rely on treasures or gifts,\nbut on humble words—\nsimple offerings yet desires are never exhausted.\nThe noble do not value treasures;\nthey use modest attire and demeanor to show respect.\nIf one practices this,\nover time, desires will not be sated.\n\nHumble bearing avoids reproach;\ndiscourse without entanglement—\nbinding oaths and alliances,\nonce agreed, are fulfilled as originally promised.\nThe noble’s bonds are not forged by oaths;\na single word suffices to settle matters for life.\nThe petty’s bonds rely on pledges,\nyet within days, they betray their former agreements.\n\nThus, the noble do not externally display virtue and righteousness\nwhile internally cultivating morality and virtue.\nInternally, they embody sincerity and purity;\nexternally, they have no false adornment.\n\nThey govern affairs within their domain,\nexpand their territory’s reach,\nexhort the people to defend to the death,\nstrengthen their walls and fortifications,\nand unite the people to protect the ancestral altars.\nThey do not attack the innocent for gain,\nnor do they assault what is difficult to obtain—\nthis is the Way of absolute preservation,\nthe principle of absolute benefit.\n\nSharing benefits with the people,\nthe people will gladly die for them.\nSharing intentions with the people,\nthe people will steadfastly defend them.\n\nThose who seek fame are not greedy;\nthose who seek profit do not overstep boundaries—\nthis is the Sage-King’s Way,\nthe shared defense of the ancestral altars,\nthe unified fortification of borders.\n\nLaozi says:\nThe Sage does not conquer his heart,\nwhile the common folk do not conquer their desires.\nWhen the heart prevails, the Way is complete;\nwhen desires prevail, the heart is in peril.\n\nThe noble act with upright qi,\nthe petty act with perverse qi.\nInternally, it aligns with nature;\nexternally, it conforms to righteousness—\nmoving according to principle,\nunconstrained by external things—this is upright qi.\n\nIndulging in tastes and sounds,\nerupting in joy and anger,\nwithout regard for future consequences—this is perverse qi.\n\nPerverse and upright qi harm each other;\ndesires and nature conflict—\nthey cannot coexist,\none flourishes while the other declines.\nThus, the Sage reduces desires and follows nature.\n\nThe eyes love color,\nthe ears love sound,\nthe nose loves fragrance,\nthe mouth loves flavor—\nwhen combined, they bring delight,\nyet never separate from harm and desire.\n\nThe ears, eyes, nose, and mouth\nknow not what they truly desire—\nall are governed by the heart,\neach finding its place.\n\nFrom this, it is clear that desires cannot be fully satisfied.\n\nThe six senses’ desires are all governed by the heart.\nIf qi is upright within,\ndesires will not harm nature.\nIf the heart is perverse externally,\nfalsehood will confuse the true.\n\nThus, uprightness and perversity lie within oneself;\ngain and loss depend on the heart.\nIf the heart is upright,\nhow can external things burden it?\n\nLaozi says:\nTo govern the body and nurture nature,\none must regulate sleep and rest,\nmoderate eating and drinking,\nharmonize joy and anger,\nadapt movement and stillness—\nwhat is internal to oneself is attained,\nand goodness is not sought externally.\nThus, perverse qi has no way to enter.\n\nAdorning the exterior harms the interior;\nindulging emotions harms the spirit—\nthose who see only surface appearances obscure the true.\n\nHe who never forgets his virtue as an honorable man\nwill surely exhaust his nature.\nTo speak of a man’s virtue without pause,\nif even for a moment he is separated from it,\nhe will surely suffer humiliation.\n\nWithin a hundred paces, one must not forget they are a guest,\nlest they burden their form.\n\nTo assist the body and govern nature,\none must moderate drinking and maintain harmony,\nso that the heart’s qi remains balanced within,\nand the spirit may be preserved.\nThe noble are cautious of subtle matters,\nnot because they are distant—\neven within ten steps,\none must consider the danger of rotting wood;\nin the blink of an eye,\nunexpected misfortune may strike—\nhow can one be negligent?\n\nThus, those with splendid plumage are harmed by their bones,\nthose with lush foliage are harmed by their roots—\nnone under heaven can possess dual perfections.\n\nThe phoenix is harmed by its plumage,\nspring blossoms are plucked for their fragrance.\nThings with dual beauties,\naffairs with dual benefits—\nsuch things do not exist.\n\nLaozi says:\nHeaven has light,\nyet does not

things,\nits benefits are boundless and reach everywhere.\n\nThe Sage’s supreme virtue and Way\nstands like a towering mountain, unmoving—\nthe traveler takes it as their destination.\nStraightening

says:\nThe Sage wears no strange or wondrous garments,\nnor adopts bizarre or ostentatious conduct.\nTheir attire is simple, their actions unobserved—\nthey do not startle the crowd, nor act contrary to others.\nThey are open yet not extravagant,\nhumble yet not fearful,\nhonored yet not flamboyant,\nhidden yet not humiliated,\ndifferent yet not strange—\npoverty and prosperity are but fate.\n\nThus, they are not extravagant nor constrained.\nHonor and obscurity are but the times—\nthus, they are neither flamboyant nor humiliated.\nThough they differ from others,\nwhat is there to find strange?\nTo act in harmony without distinction—\nthis is called Great Harmony.\nWhen actions are without distinction,\nthere is no obstruction—\nthis is Great Harmony.\n\nLaozi says:\nThe Way is to straighten oneself and await fate,\nwhen time arrives, one cannot force it forward,\nwhen time departs, one cannot summon it back—\nthus, the Sage does not advance to seek nor retreat to yield.\nStraightening the body, awaiting fate,\nfollowing the Way, conforming to time—\nnot leading, not resisting.\n\nThree years in accordance with time,\ntime departs and I follow,\nthree years in its absence,\ntime returns and I linger behind—\nneither going nor coming,\nsteadfast in their place.\n\nThis speaks of the excess of going too far ahead,\nthe inadequacy of falling too far behind—\nonly by meeting time without resistance\ncan one stand firm in their place.\n\nThe Dao/Way has no favorites,\nonly virtue does it bestow.\nWhen fortune arrives,\nit is not what one sought—\nthus, they do not boast of their merit.\nWhen calamity comes,\nit is not what one created—\nthus, they do not regret their actions.\nThis has already been explained.\n\nThe mind remains tranquil and unburdened,\nvirtue is not weighed down—\nwithout praise, they do not strive,\nwithout honor or disgrace, they are not shaken.\nThe barking of dogs does not disturb them,\nthey trust in their own nature—\ntruly without excessive desires.\nSelf-illuminated, they have no falsehood—\nthus, they are not shaken nor afraid.\n\nTherefore, those who understand the Way are not confused,\nthose who know fate are not anxious.\nTo know the Way and know fate,\nwhat anxiety, what fear?\n\nWhen the Emperor’s death occurs,\ntheir remains are left in the wild—\ntheir spirits are enshrined in the Hall of Brightness,\nfor the spirit is nobler than the form.\nThis shows the ancient Emperors returning their remains to the wild,\nnot sealing nor erecting tombs,\nto teach the people that all things must end;\nenshrining spirits in the Hall of Brightness,\nnot flattering nor being extravagant,\nto teach the people to know solemnity.\n\nThus, when the spirit governs the

remains whole;\nindulging desires, the spirit departs.\nUnless one is truly enlightened,\nhow can they preserve it?\n\nLaozi says:\nThe ancients who preserved themselves\nrejoiced in virtue and forgot disgrace—\nthus, their names did not sway their resolve.\nThey rejoiced in the Way and forgot poverty—\nthus, benefits did not sway their hearts.\nHence, they could be humble yet joyful,\nquiet yet unperturbed.\n\nVirtue and Way complete the body,\npoverty and deficiency bring no shame—\nthe heart and resolve remain unbroken,\nbenefits and fame do not confuse them.\nThus, they can be humble,\njoyful in stillness,\nand unperturbed.\n\nCounting life by numbers,\nworrying over the world’s chaos,\nis like worrying over the drying of the Yellow River—\nweeping to increase it, yet to no avail.\nThus, they do not worry over the world’s chaos,\nbut rejoice in their own self-order—\nsuch a person can speak of the Way.\n\nIt is like one who does not worry over their life’s end,\nbut worries over the world’s disorder—\nweeping a few drops of tears,\ndesiring to augment the Yellow River’s flow—\nthis is of no benefit.\nOnly by forgetting to rule others\nand instead ordering oneself\ncan one speak of the Way.\n\nLaozi says:\nPeople have three resentments—\nthose of high rank are envied by others,\nthose of great office are despised by their superiors,\nthose of abundant wealth are resented by the people.\nHigh yet able to be humble,\nabundant yet able to disperse—\nthis is how one preserves their elemental good fortune.\n\nThe higher the rank, the lower the intent,\nthe greater the office, the smaller the heart,\nthe richer the wealth, the broader the giving—\ncultivating these three, resentment does not arise.\n\nThus, nobility takes humility as its root,\nheight takes lowliness as its foundation.\nIf these three are not cultivated,\ncalamity befalls oneself.\n\nLaozi says:\nWords are used to convey one’s own nature to others,\nlistening is used

establish the path for future disciples to awaken to the Way.\n\nThe *Wenzi* asked of *Dao/Way*,\nand the *Laozi* replied:\n*\"Learning and inquiry must be precise,\nlistening to the Way must be profound.\nWithout learning, one does not know;\nwithout precision, one does not reach.\nAll who listen seek to attain wisdom,\nto perfect action,\nor to achieve merit and renown.\nDoubt leads to inquiry,\nlistening demands scrutiny—\nlike striking a bell,\nits resonance must not be hollow.\nOnly then will there be true benefit\nin attaining merit and renown.\nWithout precision, it remains unclear;\nwithout depth, it is not comprehended.\nThus, the highest learning listens with the *spirit*#1,\nscanning the profound without omission.\nThe middle learning listens with the *heart*,\nsometimes retaining, sometimes losing.\nThe lowest learning listens with the *ears*,\nfleeting as the wind passes.\nThose who listen with the *ears*\nhave learning only on the surface,\nthose who listen with the *heart*\nhave learning in the sinews,\nthose who listen with the *spirit*\nhave learning in the marrow.\nThus, if one’s listening is not profound,\none’s knowledge will be unclear;\nif one’s knowledge is unclear,\none cannot exhaust its precision;\nif one cannot exhaust its precision,\none’s actions will not be perfected.\nThe *Dao/Way* and *Virtue/Power* are lofty and wondrous—\nif one sees them clearly,\nthen one’s achievements will stand firm.\n\nThe principle of listening is this:\nan empty mind, serene and tranquil,\ndiminished *qi* without excess,\nno thought, no concern,\neyes never forgetting their gaze,\nears never heedlessly listening—\nconcentrating with unwavering focus#1,\ninternalizing intent fully.\nOnce obtained, it must be steadfastly held,\nenduring forever.\nThis is the method of *spirit-listening*,\nthe path to awakening to the Way.\nOnce obtained, it must be guarded well—\ngood listeners do not forget,\ngood embrace#2 does not slip away.\n\nThe *Dao/Way* originates from the beginningless;\nto listen to its principles, one must first clarify its source.\nIt begins with *gentleness and yielding*,\nyet culminates in *firmness and strength*—\nbegins with *fewness and smallness*,\nyet culminates in *abundance and greatness*.\nA ten-encircled tree begins with a sapling,\na hundred-foot-high terrace begins with a foundation.\nThis is the *Dao/Way* of Heaven.\nFrom non-being to being,\nfrom subtlety to manifestation,\nHeaven’s *Dao/Way* is ever thus—\nhow much more so for humans?\n\nThe Sage follows this *Dao/Way*,\nand thus the humble *lower themselves*#3,\nthe retiring *step back*#3,\nthe frugal *remain modest*#3,\nthe self-diminishing *keep their numbers few*#3.\nBy humbling themselves, they are exalted;\nby stepping back, they take precedence;\nby remaining modest, they grow vast;\nby keeping their numbers few, they become great—\nthis is the *Dao/Way* of Heaven.\n\nMost people exalt themselves while belittling others,\nthus losing what others hold dear.\nThe Sage places others before himself,\nthus gaining what others hold dear.\nThus, to oppose the natural order

whole?\n\nThe *Laozi* says:\n*\"To nurture and rear,\nto fulfill and grow—\ncomprehensive benefit without discrimination,\naligning with Heaven and Earth—\nthis is called *virtue/power* (德).\nTo nurture and complete,\nwithout action or selfishness,\nspreading beneficence to all things,\nharmonizing with Heaven and Earth—\nthis is called *ultimate virtue/power* (至德).\n\nWhat is *ren* (仁)?\nIt is: when ruling, not boasting of one’s achievements,\nwhen serving, not shaming one’s faults.\nToward the great, not boasting,\ntoward the small, not deceiving—\ncomprehensive love without

recklessly,\nwhen in adversity, not to abandon one’s integrity—\none course in accordance with reason,\nnever perverting or distorting for private gain—\nthis is called *yi* (义).\nTo uphold the fallen and rescue the drowning,\nto remain steadfast in hardship and guard one’s principles,\nto follow what is appropriate and act in accordance with reason—\nthis is *yi* (义).\n\nWhat is *li* (礼)?\nIt is: when ruling, to be reverent and stern,\nwhen serving, to be humble and respectful.\nTo withdraw and yield, to uphold softness,\nto be the feminine complement to the world—\nto stand where one does not

ministers who are not true ministers.\nSuperior and inferior lose their proper stations,\nthe strong oppress the weak—\nthus the Second Emperor of Qin and the later sovereigns of Han,\nthese are the times when states are destroyed and perish.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"When laws are intricate and punishments severe,\nthe people will resort to deceit.\nWhen laws are intricate, they cannot be fully followed,\nand when they are not fully followed,\none enforces severity through punishments—\nbut when punishments are not just,\nthe innocent are ensnared in guilt.\"*\n\nThus, the common people grow reckless, risking death to defy the law,\nand the peril of the world arises from this.\nThe more the ruler acts, the more the subjects rebel;\nthe more he seeks, the less he attains;\nthe more he prohibits, the fewer obey.\nHe creates troubles through his actions,\nyet seeks to suppress them through further actions—\nthis is like fanning flames to extinguish them;\nusing wisdom to breed calamity,\nthen using wisdom to defend against it—\nlike stirring water to seek its clarity.\n\nWhen people are burdened with many affairs, their hearts grow restless,\nand when a state enforces many prohibitions, its people grow weary—\njust as fire cannot be quenched by constant fanning,\nnor water purified by repeated stirring.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"If a ruler favors benevolence,\nhe rewards those without merit\nand pardons those with crimes.\nIf he favors severity,\nhe discards those with merit\nand punishes the innocent.\nWithout fixed preferences,\nhe executes without resentment,\nand gives without expecting virtue in return.\nWhen a ruler has no fixed preferences,\nhis ministers face no unjust punishments,\nthose rewarded do not avoid their fate,\nand those executed hold no grudges.\nHe follows the square and the plumb line,\nuninvolved in affairs,\nlike Heaven and Earth—\nwhy should they not sustain and cover all?\"*\n\nWhen he unites and harmonizes, he is the ruler;\nwhen he separates and punishes, he is the law.\nIf the people are punished without complaint,\nthis is called virtue/power and Dao/Way.\n\nActions follow law and measure,\nvirtue aligns with Heaven and Earth—\nwhen the ruler is enlightened, principles are never obscured,\nand when the law is just, the people suffer no wrongful fate.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"The world’s judgments of right and wrong are not fixed;\neach age upholds what it deems good\nand rejects what it deems evil.\nThose who seek what is right\ndo not seek the Dao/Way,\nbut what aligns with themselves.\nThose who reject what is wrong\ndo not reject evil,\nbut what contradicts their hearts.\nIf I wish to choose what is right and dwell in it,\nor reject what is wrong and discard it,\nI do not know what the world calls right and wrong.\n\nThe world’s people praise what I uphold as right,\nand condemn what I reject as wrong;\nthey also condemn what I praise as good,\nand reject what I uphold as right.\nIf what I uphold is not truly right,\nand what I praise as good is not truly good,\nthen good and evil are undefined,\nand right and wrong are nowhere to be found.\nYet those who satisfy their own desires,\nthough they condemn, still consider it good,\nand though they praise what is good,\nthey do not abandon decay.\nWhat they reject as wrong\nis what contradicts their own hearts—\nthus, there is no right without wrong,\nand no wrong without right.\nThere is no good without evil,\nnor evil without good—\nso the enlightened do not fixate on good and evil,\nnor on right and wrong.\nThus, they govern great states like simmering a delicate broth—\ndo not stir it, lest it spoil.\nGreat states cannot endure chaotic governance?\nDelicate broths cannot bear repeated stirring?\nThose who seek harmony\nmust speak truthfully to foster closeness,\nyet when their bodies are distant and they plot,\nthey invite suspicion.\nSeeking harmony means aligning with the ruler’s favor.\nIf their words are truthful yet their bodies are distant,\nthe ruler will not fully trust them,\nand they will surely be suspected.\nNow I wish to uphold my integrity\nand await the world’s response—\nhow can I know what the world will use to measure me?\nIf I rush to conform with the world,\nI am like one fleeing rain without shelter—\nyet still, I am drenched.\nNow I wish to be the world’s measure and model,\nyet others will also make me their teacher and guide—\nlike one sprinting to avoid rain,\nexhausted and labored,\nyet still unable to escape being wet.\nTo dwell in emptiness is impossible,\nunless one does not seek emptiness and yet emptiness comes naturally—\nthis is how desires are fulfilled without effort.\nEmptiness is without desire;\ndesire is not emptiness.\nWithout the heart’s attachment,\none attains all things.\n\nThus, those who grasp the Dao/Way\nare like a cart’s axle that does not turn for itself,\nyet enables the wheel to reach a thousand miles,\nturning endlessly on the boundless plain.\nThe adept of the Dao/Way\nis the hub of the cart—\nhis body mingles with the world yet finds rest,\nhis spirit dwells in the center yet remains ever still.\nHe does not stray beyond words,\nnor toil for himself—\nthus he turns upon boundless paths,\nand wanders in realms of utter darkness.\nTherefore, the sage embodies the Dao/Way and returns to its source,\ndoes not transform to await transformation,\nand acts without contrivance.\n\nThe sage internally returns to truth,\nexternally adapts to change,\ntouched by emotions yet unstained—\nhe moves and acts without contrivance.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"He who often wages war and frequently wins\nwill surely bring his state to ruin.\nFrequent warfare exhausts the people,\nfrequent victories breed arrogance in the ruler—\nwith an arrogant ruler governing exhausted subjects,\nhow few states can avoid ruin?\nArrogance leads to excess,\nexcess leads to depletion of resources,\nexhaustion breeds resentment,\nresentment leads to extreme measures—\nwhen both ruler and subjects reach extremes,\nno state remains unfallen.\"*\n\nThus, when achievements are complete, the sage withdraws—\nthis is the Dao/Way of Heaven.\nWar should not be waged often,\nthe ruler should not grow arrogant,\nthe people should not be exhausted,\nresources should not be depleted—\nfor when extremes are reached,\nthey return to extremes without ruin.\nWhen King Ping asked Wenzi:\n*\"I have heard that you attained the Dao/Way from Lao Dan.\nNow, though wise men may possess the Dao/Way,\nthey face a depraved and chaotic age—\nwith the authority of one man alone,\nhow can he transform the long-suffering people?\nIs this possible?\"*\nKing Ping refers to the Zhou King Ping.\nThe \"one man\" speaks of the king himself.\nWenzi, the wise man, is the speaker here—\n*\"Though the Dao/Way of virtue/power\nrectifies evil to establish order,\nrestores chaos to bring governance,\nand transforms depravity to return to simplicity,\npure virtue revives,\nand the world attains peace—\nthis depends on one man.\nFor righteousness resides in the heart,\nand governance stems from the ruler.\nWhen the heart weakens, decay follows;\nwhen the ruler governs rightly, order prevails.\nThus, prosperity and decline are not decreed by Heaven,\nsuccess and failure rest within ourselves—\nthey do not depend on external things,\nbut on the Dao/Way we uphold.\nThe value lies in the Dao/Way.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The **Supreme Virtue/Power**—The **Supreme Virtue/Power** refers to the virtuous rulers of their time. When the Dao/Way of the Three Dynasties declined and the virtue/power of the Five Hegemons waned, it was fitting to cultivate virtue/power to rectify the world. Those with virtue/power are honored, and those with merit are praised, hence the term **Supreme Virtue/Power**.\n\nLaozi said: *\"The ruler is the heart of the state; a tranquil heart brings order to all limbs, while a disturbed heart brings chaos.\"* Governing the state depends on the ruler’s clarity—when he is clear, all the people take joy in their pursuits. Governing oneself depends on a rectified heart—when it is rectified, all limbs find their proper place. Thus, when a man’s self is well-governed, his limbs move without effort; he knows no sickness or pain. When a state is well-governed, its ruler and ministers forget each other; there is no worry or anxiety.\n\nLaozi said: *\"He learned from Master Changzhu [常枞]—Laozi’s teacher, surnamed Chang, named Zhu.\"* Laozi himself recounted receiving instruction from his teacher, whose words were thus: *\"The unlettered one—when he sees the tongue, he guards softness; when he sees the ancient Dao/Way, he upholds the yielding and gentle.\"* The ancient character (古) can also be written as the tongue character (舌), meaning softness. Gazing upward at the house beams, he laments that light does not linger. Retreating by the river, he sighs that the past does not cease flowing. Observing shadows to know how to grasp what comes after, he does not act before its time.\n\nThus, the Sage follows the Way of **emptiness and non-action**, always yielding to what comes later rather than forcing what comes first. It is like kindling a pile of wood—when the fire reaches the top, the lower logs are consumed. What comes later is what comes first; what is below is what is above. This is the natural order of things. If one seeks to act before others, he cannot act before others.\n\nLaozi said: *\"The clapper of a bell, though loud, destroys itself; the candle, though bright, consumes itself. The markings of tigers and leopards invite arrows; the swiftness of monkeys and gibbons invites traps. Thus, the bold perish by their strength; the eloquent are ensnared by their cleverness. Though one knows cleverness, he cannot know when to refrain from it.\"* This is the harm of knowing, the inability to preserve oneself by not knowing. Though one is wise in speech, he can only be given partial truths, not broad responses. Holding to the courage of an ordinary man, he cannot defend against multitudes; clinging to one-sided arguments, he does not speak of universal principles.\n\nLaozi said: *\"The Dao/Way is founded on non-existence; to embody the Dao/Way is to be empty and without form—this is called **subtle and mysterious**.\"* It cannot be seen in form, nor heard in sound; this is called **profound and dark**. **Profound and dark** describes the Dao/Way, yet is not the Dao/Way itself. It is like a net—used to catch fish, yet not the fish itself; or words—used to speak of the Dao/Way, yet not the Dao/Way itself.\n\nThe Dao/Way is to look inward and reflect; to listen within and reflect, thus attaining self-knowledge. Therefore, a man is neither slightly awakened nor deeply confused; neither slightly kind nor greatly foolish. He who clutches a glowworm and compares it to the sun is not confused how? He who holds a piece of jade and compares it to the King of Fu is not foolish how?\n\nDo not take your mirror from flowing water, but from still water, for its stillness preserves within and does not sway without. Dust in the heart scatters outward—it flows and forever dims. Water’s nature is inward emptiness—its stillness reflects itself. The moon wanes when the sun shines; darkness cannot endure against light. Stars vanish when the sun rises—nothing can contend with its radiance. The end cannot be stronger than the root; branches cannot surpass the trunk. When the upper is heavy and the lower is light, its fall is inevitable.\n\nThis means: the Great Ruler has his decree, the lesser men should not presume to act. If they do, it is like darkness seizing light or stars challenging the sun—root and branch must be used in harmony, each in its proper place, to avoid peril and overthrow.\n\nOne pool does not nurture two dragons; one female does not mate with two males. Unity is fixed; duality invites contention. When the ruler is unified, the state is secure. When a man is unified, his heart is at peace. Jade rests in the mountain, and grass and trees grow moist. Pearls arise from the depths, and the shore does not wither. Mountains and rivers hold jade and pearls, thus nourished and graceful. The gentleman accumulates virtue/power, thus radiant and illustrious.\n\nThe earthworm lacks the strength of sinews and bones nor the sharpness of claws and teeth, yet it feeds above on the soil and drinks below from the Yellow Spring—its heart is unified. The earthworm eats when hungry and drinks when thirsty—no conflicting thoughts, no need for sinews, bones, claws, or teeth. When a man unifies his heart in the Dao/Way, why should he rely on fame and profit to find satisfaction?\n\nClarity is brightness—even a cup of water reveals the pupil. Turbidity is harm—a river cannot obscure a great mountain. Though clarity is small, it can discern the finest hairs; though turbidity is vast, it cannot reveal peaks and valleys. Orchids and sweetgrass do not cease their fragrance because they are not worn; a boat floats on the rivers and seas, not sinking because it is not boarded; the gentleman follows the good Dao/Way, not stopping because it is unrecognized—this is their inherent nature.\n\nOrchids and sweetgrass are fragrant by nature; they cannot help but be fragrant. The gentleman follows the good Dao/Way—he cannot but act. To bring clarity into turbidity is to invite suffering; to bring turbidity into clarity is to invite ruin. The virtuous and foolish cannot stand together; purity and filth do not mix in the same vessel. Heaven’s two *qi* forms the rainbow; Earth’s two *qi* causes leakage and concealment; man’s two *qi* brings illness. The three transformations of Heaven, Earth, and Man value life above all.\n\nDarkness and light cannot remain constant—winter follows summer, and summer follows winter. The moon does not know day; the sun does not know",

This has already been explained.\n\nThus, when raising the crooked and the straight, one may not always succeed; when raising the straight and the crooked, do not force it to proceed.\nThis is to elucidate the *Fu* and *Yan* sections.\n\nWhen a bird is about to come, setting nets and waiting for it—he who catches the bird gains one eye of the net. If one makes a net of a single eye, he will never catch a bird.\nRelying on one man’s talent alone is hard to govern the multitude.\nA net of a single eye cannot trap a bird.\nThus, some matters cannot be preordained, some things cannot be foreseen—\ntherefore the Sage stores the Dao/Way and awaits the proper time.\n\nThe Sage’s conduct is Heavenly, his actions follow the times;\nbefore the time arrives, he guards the Dao/Way—when the time comes, he acts accordingly.\nThe Duke of Zhou’s establishment of the Zhou Dao, and the Emperor Gaozu’s flourishing of the Han dynasty.\n\nTo gain fish, one must first open the valleys;\nto attract birds, one must first plant the trees.\nWater gathers, and fish assemble;\ntrees flourish, and birds congregate.\nHe who gains fish does not drag them into the depths—\nhe who gains monkeys does not carry them up the trees.\nHe merely lets them go where it is advantageous.\n\nThe relationship between ruler and subject is like fish returning to water,\nbirds relying on forests—\nletting them act as they will, they come without being summoned.\nA wise ruler governs, and loyal and virtuous ministers naturally arrive.\n\nThe foot treads shallow ground, yet waits for what it cannot tread before it can move;\nthe mind knows little, yet waits for what it does not know before it can be enlightened.\nThe foot’s familiar ground is little, its unfamiliar ground is much.\nThe mind’s known things are few, its unknown things are many.\nThus, though he does not act, his actions are fulfilled;\nthough he does not know, his knowledge is complete.\n\nWhen streams run dry, the valleys become empty;\nwhen hills are leveled, the depths are sealed.\nWhen lips are lost, teeth grow cold;\nwhen the Yellow River is deep, its nourishment lies in the mountains.\nThis illustrates how the ruler and people rely on each other,\njust as mountains and rivers are interconnected.\nA deep Yellow River brings fertility to the mountains,\na ruler’s heavy taxation drains the people’s wealth.\nWhen the ruler demands more, the people are exhausted;\nwhen the people’s strength is spent, the ruler’s position is perilous—\nthis is the meaning of \"lips lost, teeth grow cold.\"\n\nWater still yields clarity;\nclarity brings evenness;\nevenness brings ease;\nease reveals the form of things.\nForms cannot coexist—\nthus clarity can be used as a standard.\nWhen the sovereign’s wisdom is established,\nit is like the stillness of water.\nDeeply discerning the nature of things,\nno state of good or evil escapes him;\nprofoundly observing human nature,\nhis policies of peace and harmony spread naturally.\n\nWhen leaves fall, it is the wind that shakes them;\nwhen water becomes turbid, it is objects that stir it.\nThe wind does not shake yet

their roots,\nbut men sometimes stray from the Dao/Way.\nWater and fire repel each other,\nyet the *Dǐng* and *Lì* vessels exist between them,\nand the five flavors are harmonized.\nBone and flesh love each other,\nyet slanderers come between them,\nand father and son grow suspicious.\nThis shows how things have opposing natures—\nthough water and fire attack each other,\nwhen used properly, they yield harmony.\nThough bone and flesh love each other,\nslander and deceit come between them,\nand doubt arises.\nThe virtuous must be vigilant.\n\nDogs and pigs eat without

two *li*,\nYet with each halting step, the tortoise reaches a thousand *li*.\nAccumulated grains, though small, form hills and mountains.\n\nFor those who seek the Way,\nIt is not the speed of their initial resolve that matters,\nNor the beauty of their prolonged devotion—\nBut that through perseverance, they reach a thousand *li*,\nAnd through steadfastness, they build mountains.\n\nTo stand by the river and desire fish\nIs not as wise as returning to weave nets.\nThe river’s fish are caught by nets,\nAnd humanity’s Dao is grasped by the heart.\n\nA bow must first be tuned before seeking strength,\nA horse must first be guided before seeking excellence,\nA person must first be trusted before seeking ability.\nTo grasp these three principles\nIs to discern the essentials of all affairs.\n\nA skilled smith cannot melt wood,\nA master craftsman cannot carve ice—\nSome things are beyond their capacity.\nHow then can the virtuous not reflect upon this?\n\nWhat cannot be shaped

worthy\nIs to align with Heaven and Earth’s Way.\n\nWhen Heaven’s *qi* does not descend, earth’s *qi* does not ascend,\nYin and yang do not communicate,\nAll things do not prosper,\nThe petty gain influence, the virtuous decline,\nThe five grains do not grow,\nVirtue and power are concealed within.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth’s *qi* do not exchange,\nYin and yang’s *qi* does not flow—\nIt is because the sovereign’s virtue and power are unused,\nThe deceitful and flatterers prevail,\nThe petty hold office, the virtuous are exiled,\nCausing all things to wither and the five grains to fail.\n\nThe Way of Heaven: it gathers the abundant to benefit the scarce,\nThe Way of Earth: it reduces the high to elevate the low—\nThis is the Way of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Way of spirits: the proud and overflowing are humbled,\nThe arrogant and overflowing meet the humble.\nHumanity’s Way: the abundant do not hoard,\nThe wealthy do not increase their wealth.\n\nThe sage’s Way: though

*li*—mountains, marshes, rivers, and seas.\nOne harmonizes them, blending with the undifferentiated *qi*.\nTime governs them, responding without disorder,\nGiving rise to all things—\nThis is called the Dao.\n\nIt nourishes and sustains all things,\nYet does not rule as their master—\nThus it is called the Dao.\n\nThe Great Dao is vast and near,\nNot distant from the self.\nCultivate it within oneself,\nAnd its virtue becomes true.\nCultivate it in all things,\nAnd its virtue is unbroken.\nTo cultivate its truth within is called *zhen*,\nTo nurture its virtue externally is called *de*.\n\nHeaven covers all things,\nBestowing its virtue and nourishing them,\nGiving without taking—\nThus all spirits return to it.\nTo give without taking is the highest virtue,\nThus it is called *de*.\n\nNone is higher than Heaven,\nNone is lower than the marshes.\nHeaven is high, the marshes are low—\nThe sage follows this model,\nEstablishing distinctions of honor and humility,\nAnd thus

      "translated_text": "The low and the high are arranged in order,\nThe noble and the base are positioned accordingly.\n\nThe Earth bears all things and nurtures them,\nGiving and taking in return—\nThus the flesh and bones return to it.\nGiving and taking is the lower virtue,\nYet the lower virtue does not lose its virtue—\nThus it is called *virtue*.\n\nNot taking is called the Dao of Heaven:\nHeaven generates all things,\nYet only nourishes and sustains them,\nNot claiming their substance—\nThus the spirits return to the upper realm.\nThe one who does not take is the highest virtue,\nThus it is called *virtue*.\n\nThe one who takes is called the Dao of the Earth:\nThough it completes the forms of all things,\nIt returns them to their original nature—\nThus the flesh and bones descend to the lower realm,\nAnd this is called *without virtue*.\n\nThe Earth receives from Heaven,\nThus it is settled and tranquil;\nThe Earth is settled and tranquil,\nThus all things take form;\nThe Earth is vast and thick,\nThus all things gather.\nSettled and tranquil, it bears nothing it does not,\nVast and thick, it contains nothing it does not.\nThe Earth’s power is deep and enduring,\nAnd the waters’ sources converge within it;\nThe Earth’s Dao is broad and long-lasting,\nThus it can endure and flourish eternally.\nThe sage follows this model,\nAnd virtue knows no limit in its embrace.\n\nIt is said: Heaven and Earth support one another,\nTo achieve boundless breadth and thickness.\nThe ruler and minister trust one another,\nThus they can govern in harmony.\n\nWhen *yin* overcomes *yang*,\nAll things thrive;\nWhen *yang* overcomes *yin*,\nAll things stagnate.\nWhen all things thrive, none lacks sustenance;\nWhen all things stagnate, none lacks joy.\nWhen all things are joyful, none remains ungoverned.\n\nWhen *yin* harms things, *yang* bends itself,\nWhen *yin* advances, *yang* retreats—\nThen the petty man gains influence,\nAnd the virtuous withdraw from harm.\nThe Way is thus clear:\nIf *yang* is restrained by *yin*,\nThen the realm is harmonious and governed;\nIf the minister overcomes the ruler,\nThen the petty man holds power.\n\nWhen *yang qi* moves, all things relax and find their place—\nThus the sage follows the Dao of *yang*.\n\nTo follow things, they will follow in return;\nTo oppose things, they will oppose in return—\nThus one does not lose the nature and disposition of things.\n\nThe *yin* sound is like the *wu* bird.\nWhen the marshes are full, all things flourish in due season;\nWhen the marshes are dry, all things wither.\nThus if the rains do not come,\nThe land becomes barren and abandoned.\nWhen *yang* ascends and then descends again,\nIt becomes the master of all things.\nIt does not overindulge in growth,\nThus it can end and begin anew;\nEnding and beginning anew,\nThus it can endure forever.\nTo endure forever,\nThus it is the mother of all things.\n\nThe sage follows the Dao of Heaven,\nActing without effort to endure eternally;\nTo oppose the nature of things,\nEven one in high position cannot hold it.\n\nThe *yang qi* must accumulate before it can be applied,\nThe *yin qi* must gather before it can transform—\nNone can apply or transform without first accumulating.\nThus the sage is cautious in what he gathers.\n\nGather *virtue* and blessings follow,\nGather evil and ruin comes.\nWhen *yang* extinguishes *yin*,\nAll things grow fat;\nWhen *yin* extinguishes *yang*,\nAll things decay.\nThus, if kings and nobles uphold the Dao of *yang*,\nAll things thrive;\nIf they uphold the Dao of *yin*,\nThe realm perishes.\n\nThe *yang* is upright, life-giving—\nThus all things grow fat.\nFatness brings thriving;\nThe *yin* is perverse, death-dealing—\nThus all things decay.\nDecay leads to ruin.\n\nIf *yang* does not descend to *yin*,\nThen all things cannot form;\nIf the ruler does not descend to the minister,\nThen the virtue of transformation does not flow—\nThus the ruler descends to the minister and becomes wise,\nOr does not descend and becomes dull and deaf.\n\nThe ruler is not the utmost sage,\nYet cannot descend to the minister;\nThe minister is not the utmost worthy,\nYet cannot assist the ruler.\nYu Shun bowed to Bo Cheng,\nKing Wen deferred to Shangfu—\nThis is called wisdom.\n\nThe sun rises from the Earth,\nAnd all things multiply and grow;\nKings and nobles dwell above the people,\nTo manifest *virtue* and the Way.\nThe sun sets into the Earth,\nAnd all things rest and recover;\nThe petty man dwells among the people,\nAnd above them flee in hiding.\n\nIt is said:\nIf *yang* does not descend to *yin*,\nThen all things cannot thrive;\nIf the ruler does not descend to the minister,\nThen all things are concealed.\n\nWhen thunder moves, all things awaken,\nWhen dew moistens, all things are refreshed—\nThe great man’s actions are like this.\n\nThe movements of *yin* and *yang* have constant rhythms,\nYet the great man’s actions do not exhaust things.\nWhen the great man is at his peak,\nIt is like spring’s thunder.\nWhen he issues his commands,\nIt is like the gentle wind.\nBoth are harmonious and follow the Way,\nThus they do not exhaust things.\n\nThunder stirs the Earth,\nAnd all things relax;\nWind sways the trees,\nAnd grasses and woods flourish.\nThe great man abandons evil and pursues goodness,\nAnd the people do not stray far—\nThus the people have paths of departure and return.\nThe more they depart, the more they regret;\nThe less they return, the more they are at ease.\n\nMoreover, when the great man has goodness,\nThe people flock to him.\nLike the Great King’s departure from Bi,\nHow distant was it?\n\nFire moves only with fuel,\nThe great man’s words must have truth.\nWith truth and sincerity,\nWhere can he not succeed?\nFire spreads as fuel is passed on;\nWords take effect as truth is upheld.\nThus, when the great man speaks,\nHis actions follow without delay,\nAnd his truth is like the four seasons.\n\nThe Yellow River is deep,\nIts banks lie against the mountains;\nThe hills and mounds are high,\nTheir depths sink into the abyss.\nWhen *yang qi* is strong, it transforms into *yin*;\nWhen *yin qi* is strong, it transforms into *yang*—\nThus desire cannot be fully satisfied,\nAnd joy cannot be pushed to its extreme.\nThe Dao of Heaven is sublime and elevated,\nYet only moderates desire to maintain harmony,\nTo follow Heaven’s principles,\nAnd not let things reach their limits.\n\nAnger without harsh words,\nRage without changing countenance—\nThis is called *calculating* (obtaining) virtue.\nThough anger and rage remain,\nYet harsh words and perverse expressions are not uttered.\nIf they do not manifest externally,\nThen virtue is obtained within—\nThis is called *calculating* virtue through the Way.\n\nThe *yang* spreads harmoniously throughout the realm,\nThe *yin* sinks and drowns the realm in chaos.\nTo lean toward *yang* is to align with loyal and virtuous,\nThus harmony prevails.\nTo lean toward *yin* is to align with flatterers and deceivers,\nThus chaos descends.\n\nLaozi said:\nAccumulating thinness forms thickness,\nAccumulating lowliness forms height.\nThe noble man strives daily to achieve brilliance,\nThe petty man strives daily to reach disgrace.\nThe noble man diligently cultivates himself to follow the Dao,\nAnd his radiance increases daily.\nThe petty man rides on the threshold to indulge his desires,\nAnd ultimately meets ruin and shame.\n\nThough these changes may not be seen,\nYet to see goodness as if it were not attainable,\nAnd to regard past evil as if it were not ominous—\nIf one turns toward goodness,\nEven past mistakes bring no blame;\nIf one does not turn toward goodness,\nEven loyalty cannot avert coming misfortune.\nThus blaming others is not as grave as blaming oneself,\nAnd striving to win others is not as effective as striving within oneself.\n\nSound is self-summoned,\nKindred spirits seek one another,\nReputation is self-bestowed,\nAnd people are self-appointed—\nNone of these are beyond oneself.",

      "translated_text": "The Sage dwells in seclusion to avoid calamity, remains silent and still to await the proper moment;\nThe petty man knows not the gates of fortune and misfortune—he acts and falls into punishment. Though he makes every effort to prepare, it is insufficient to preserve his body.\n\nThus, the superior man first avoids calamity and then pursues advantage, first shuns disgrace and only then seeks fame.\nTherefore, the Sage always attends to what lies beyond the formless, yet does not dwell on what is already manifest within—thus, calamity has no means to arrive, and praise cannot soil him.\n\nWhen one is ensnared by gain and harm, it arises from love and hatred.\nIf love and hatred do not arise, where do slander and praise come from?\n\nThe noble man sees what is yet unformed and finds it easy to govern; the petty man, though he makes every effort to prepare, ultimately meets disaster.\nTo rescue what is already formed—once it is complete, escape is difficult.\n\nLaozi said: The Way of the common man—his heart should be small, his aspirations great, his wisdom encompassing, his conduct upright, his abilities manifold, his undertakings few.\nBy \"heart small,\" it means to anticipate misfortune before it arises, to guard against disaster with utmost caution, and to dare not indulge his desires.\nBy \"aspirations great,\" it means to embrace all under heaven, to unify disparate customs, to gather all judgments and make them converge at the center.\nBy \"wisdom encompassing,\" it means to have no beginning or end, to flow in all directions, to be deep and inexhaustible like a fountain.\nBy \"conduct upright,\" it means to stand firm and unyielding, to remain pure and unstained, to hold fast to principles in adversity and not to boast in prosperity.\nBy \"abilities manifold,\" it means to possess both literary and martial virtues, to act and rest in accordance with propriety, to wield and discard things with fitting measure.\nBy \"undertakings few,\" it means to grasp the essential and govern the multitude, to hold fast to simplicity and manage the vast, to remain still and thus control the restless.\n\nThus, the one whose heart is small is restrained by the subtle;\nThe one whose aspirations are great embraces all within his bosom;\nThe one whose wisdom is encompassing knows all without effort;\nThe one whose conduct is upright has nothing he will not do;\nThe one whose abilities are manifold governs all without fail;\nThe one whose undertakings are few holds fast to what is essential.\n\nThese six virtues—none but the most exalted Sage or High True One can fully embody them.\n\nThus, when the Sage encounters goodness, he does not deem it too small to act upon, nor does he overlook even the slightest fault without correction. His actions require no shamans or sorcerers, yet ghosts and spirits dare not act before him—this is the height of nobility.\nYet he remains ever vigilant, cautious each day, and thus achieves unity through non-action.\nExternally, he does not fail the world; internally, he feels no shame.\nWhy invoke shamans? Why fear ghosts and spirits?\nBy maintaining constant reverence, one may preserve his end.\n\nThe wisdom of the foolish is already meager, yet their actions are many—thus, they are bound to fail.\nTherefore, governing through proper instruction and teaching is easy and certain to succeed;\nGoverning through perverse teaching is difficult and certain to fail.\nTo abandon what is easy and certain to succeed, and instead engage in what is difficult and certain to fail—this is the folly of the confused.\nWithout measuring gain and loss, one sits and invites ruin.\nWhen undertakings are complex and difficult, though labored, they will fail.\nWhen things are simple and easy to follow, they will succeed—yet to not act upon them is the height of folly.\n\nLaozi said: The rise of fortune is gradual and unbroken, while the birth of calamity is sudden and chaotic. The patterns of fortune and misfortune are subtle and unseen.\nThe Sage perceives their beginning and end—thus, they cannot be ignored.\nFortune is as light as a feather, yet only the Sage discerns it;\nCalamity is as vast as Tai Mountain, yet the foolish see it not.\n\nThe enlightened ruler’s rewards and punishments are not for himself, but for the state.\nWhat benefits himself but serves no function for the state—he does not bestow reward upon it;\nWhat harms himself but aids the state—he does not inflict punishment upon it.\nThe enlightened ruler’s rewards and punishments are based on impartial justice.\nWhat benefits the state and aids the people—he implements it;\nWhat profits himself but harms the people—he halts it.\n\nThus, to uphold propriety in accordance with what is fitting is called a noble man;\nTo abandon propriety’s fitting measure is called a petty man.\nAre noble and petty men fixed in their nature?\nWhen actions and conduct align with what is fitting, he is a noble man;\nWhen actions and conduct defy what is fitting, he is a petty man.\n\nThe highest wisdom is obtained without effort—this is the esoteric understanding of the superior man.\nThe next level is to labor without exhaustion—the diligent common man, striving without weariness.\nThe lowest is to labor while sick—\nThe inferior man’s heart is sluggish and confused, his spirit dull and muddled, thus his labor is excessive and his illness worsens.\n\nThe ancients savored the Dao without clinging to it;\nThe people of today abandon the Dao and yet boast of themselves.\nNot to cling is not to dwell.\nTo savor the Way is to savor.\nThe ancients savored the Way without dwelling, while today’s people have no Way yet praise themselves.\n\nZhou’s ruler made ivory chopsticks—\nChopsticks crafted from elephant tusk—\nAnd Ji Zi sighed, lamenting their extravagant splendor.\nLu buried their dead with wooden effigies—\nEffigies, carved wooden figures resembling humans, used as ritual vessels—\nAnd Confucius sighed, mourning their violation of propriety.",

      "translated_text": "「Before, this was explained.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is what gives rise to all things,\n**Virtue/Power** is what sustains life,\n**Ren** is the proof of accumulated benevolence,\n**Yi** is what aligns with the heart yet harmonizes with the masses, fittingly so.\n\nThese four—used to govern the world and cultivate oneself—must not be abandoned.\n\nWhen the **Dao/Way** is lost, **Virtue/Power** flourishes;\nwhen **Virtue/Power** declines, **Ren** and **Yi** arise.\nThus, in the upper age, the **Dao/Way** prevails yet **Virtue/Power** is not yet established,\nin the middle age, **Virtue/Power** is upheld yet **Ren** and **Yi** are not cherished,\nin the lower age, **Ren** and **Yi** are clung to, fearing their loss—\nso the **Junzi** (noble person) cannot live without **Yi**, and losing **Yi** means losing what sustains their life;\nthe **xiaoren** (petty person) cannot survive without profit, and losing profit means losing what sustains their existence.\nThus, the **Junzi** fears losing **Yi** as misfortune,\nwhile the **xiaoren** seeks profit as fortune.\nObserving their fears, the paths to calamity and blessing diverge.\n\nWhen the **Dao/Way** is abandoned, **Virtue/Power** perishes;\nwhen **Ren** is severed, **Yi** grows thin.\nThe **Junzi** without **Yi** cannot preserve their **Dao/Way**,\nthe **xiaoren** without profit cannot sustain their life.\nThe **Junzi** fears losing **Yi** as misfortune,\nwhile the **xiaoren** pursues profit as fortune.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"If one seeks profit in affairs,\nit only brings harm;\nif one seeks harm in affairs,\nit only brings profit.\"*\n\nTo feed the **hot** (excessive heat) when one suffers from **dampness** (湿),\nto drink the **cold** (excessive cold) when one is parched—\nthis is how the common folk nourish their ailments,\nyet the skilled physician knows it as the cause of disease.\nDelight in the eyes, delight in the heart—\nthe advantage of the foolish,\nthe avoidance of those with the **Dao/Way**.\n\nThe **sage** (圣人) first meets and then aligns,\nthe common folk first align and then meet—\nthus, the gates of misfortune and fortune,\nthe inversion of harm and profit,\nmust be carefully observed.\n\nTo quench thirst with water—\nthe skilled physician sees it as misfortune;\nto take wealth from unjust means—\nthe **Junzi** sees it as harm.\n\nTo first oppose and then align—\nthe folly of the foolish;\nto first align and then oppose—\nthe abhorrence of the sage.\n\nFor harm and profit are contrary,\nmisfortune and fortune are interdependent—\nthey must be carefully observed.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"One with merit who abandons **Ren** and **Yi** will be met with suspicion,\none with guilt who possesses **Ren** and **Yi** will be met with trust.\"*\n\nThus, **Ren** and **Yi** are the natural order of affairs,\nthe most honored rank in the world.\nThough one’s achievements and name may already be established,\n**Ren** and **Yi** must not be abandoned—\nto abandon them invites guilt,\nto uphold them secures honor.\nThough one’s schemes may succeed,\nthey should consider releasing their ambitions to preserve **Yi**—\nif a state exists yet its affairs abandon **Yi**,\nits merit will not be fulfilled.\nThough one’s plans may not align with strategy,\nif they benefit the state,\nand if one’s heart is devoted to the ruler,\nharmonizing with **Ren** and **Yi**,\nthen their life will be preserved.\nHence it is said:\n*\"A hundred words, a hundred schemes,\nthough often misplaced,\nare not as good as abandoning them\nand carefully upholding **Ren** and **Yi**.\"*\n\nAs a subject of the ruler,\nif one schemes to resolve difficulties,\narrogantly honors oneself,\nyet their merit does not succeed—\nit is because they abandoned **Ren** and **Yi**.\nSome may have wise counsel,\nyet it is not used;\nsome may have extraordinary schemes,\nyet they fail to be implemented;\nsome may serve the ruler with all their might,\nthough not noticed,\nyet they preserve **Ren** and **Yi**,\nnever daring to forget them for a moment,\nand thus their life remains unharmed.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"Teaching originates from the **Junzi**,\nwhile the **xiaoren** benefit from its influence;\nprofit originates from the **xiaoren**,\nwhile the **Junzi** enjoy its merit.\nIf the **Junzi** and **xiaoren** each find their proper place,\nthen governance is effortless,\nthe **Dao/Way** is fulfilled.\n**Virtue/Power’s** influence reaches below,\nwealth and profit are offered above—\nthen there is no need for officials,\nyet all things are governed;\nno need for commands,\nyet all things proceed in order.\nEach finds their proper place—\nthis is the fulfillment of the **Dao/Way**.*\n\n**Virtue/Power** (德) as the root, **subordinates** (臣) as the branches—\nif the root is not strong yet the branches flourish,\nsuch a thing has never existed.\n\nThe **sage’s** governance is clear in their **four eyes** (四目),\nperceptive in their **four ears** (四聪),\nrejecting deceit and evil,\ntrusting the virtuous and capable—\nthen the ruler may sit back with hands folded,\ndoing nothing yet all is transformed,\nand the subjects may give their utmost effort,\nfulfilling their duties without strife.\nHow could there be logic in contention?\nThus, the root grows ever stronger,\nthe branches flourish abundantly.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"A benevolent father’s love for his child\nis not for seeking repayment—\nif it were, it could not be sincere.\nA sagely ruler’s care for the people\nis not for personal use—\nby nature, it cannot be otherwise.\nYet if one relies on their strength,\ndepends on their merits,\nand must exhaust them for gain,\nthen benevolence is not extended.\nThe father’s love for his child,\nthe ruler’s care for his people—\nwhy seek repayment?\nThis is the natural division,\nthe **Dao/Way** of heaven.\nSome rulers and fathers,\nrelying on their strength,\narrogant toward their subjects and children—\ntheir benevolence is not extended.\nThus, to use what the common folk love,\none gains the common folk’s strength;\nto raise what the common folk delight in,\none gains the common folk’s hearts.\nHence, by observing their beginning,\none knows their end.\nTo love all under heaven,\nthough the world be vast,\nit is as one family—\nnot to love all under heaven,\nthough the individual be humble,\nthey are like a lone gate in a million fields.\nBy this, the end and beginning may be known,\nlife and death may be discerned.*\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"People rely on **Yi** for love,\ncliques rely on **group strength** (群强) for power—\nthus, the broader the application of **Yi**,\nthe farther the influence of **wei** (威/authority) extends;\nthe thinner the application of **Yi**,\nthe smaller the reach of **wu** (武/force) becomes.\nThis means:\n**Virtue/Power’s** influence is impartial,\nthose who attach to it are many;\nto abandon **Yi** and use **force**,\nthose who remain are few.\"*\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"To take by unjust means yet not distribute—\ndisaster will come to their own person,\nthey cannot benefit others,\nnor can they benefit themselves—\nthis is truly foolish,\nno different from the owl’s love for its young.\nTo take unjustly and hoard without dispersing—\nthis is called **self-destructive nourishment** (养自喷),\n**self-inflicted calamity** (育枭自祸).\nHence, to hold and let it overflow—\nit is better to let it be;\nto grasp and make it sharp—\nit cannot be long preserved.\n\n*(#5: \"热\" and \"寒\" retain their TCM meanings—excessive heat

Ministers,\ndiscussing the Dao and administering the state,\nharmonizing the principles of yin and yang,\nacting as the sovereign’s limbs and voice.\n\nLater, Xièyì cultivated the fields,\nteaching the people to sow seeds.\nXī Zhōng became the Master of Works,\ncrafting tools to meet the people’s needs.\nThus did the Sage employ the worthy.\n\nTheir achievements reached to the cosmos,\ntheir virtue flowed to the four seas—\nonly Heaven was greater,\nand Yao followed it alone.\n\nHe guided the people:\nthose dwelling by water fished,\nthose in the woods gathered,\nthose in the valleys herded,\nthose on the hills tilled the land.\nThe land suited the work,\nthe work suited the tools,\nthe tools suited the materials.\nGāo and Zé wove nets,\nLíng and Jí plowed the fields—\nthus the people exchanged what they lacked\nfor what they possessed,\ntheir skills for their deficiencies.\nSo few deserted, many obeyed,\nlike wind passing through reeds—\nsuddenly stirring all.\n\nEach responded to purity or turbidity,\nseeking what benefited them,\navoiding what harmed them.\nThus neighboring states lay within sight,\nthe sounds of roosters and dogs carried on the breeze,\nyet no footsteps crossed the borders of the lords,\nno chariot tracks stretched beyond a thousand li—\nall content in their homes.\n\nThe Sage’s Way governed the people:\nsettling them where their strengths lay,\nestablishing them where it suited them,\nso that abundance and scarcity supported one another,\nskill and clumsiness complemented each other.\nLike wind passing through a reed,\nmoistening what it touched,\nits sound followed what it stirred,\nthings responded to what benefited them.\nThus neighboring states lay within sight—\nweapons unused,\nthe people living out their days in peace.\n\nSo chaotic states seemed full,\nwell-ordered ones seemed empty,\ndeclining ones seemed lacking,\nthriving ones seemed abundant.\nThe \"empty\" were not without people,\nbut each held to their duties;\nthe \"full\" were not overpopulated,\nbut all were fixated on trifles;\nthe \"abundant\" were not rich in wealth,\nbut their desires were restrained and their undertakings few;\nthe \"lacking\" were not poor in goods,\nbut their people were few and their expenditures great.\n\nUnderstanding these four truths\nreveals the roots of order and chaos,\ndiscerns the fate of survival and ruin.\n\nThus the ancient kings’ laws were not their own creation,\nbut what they followed.\nTheir punishments were not their own invention,\nbut what they upheld—\nthe Way of Supreme Virtue.\n\nPunishments were not meant to kill,\nbut to set boundaries.\nYet the foolish did not heed their commands,\nand multiplied their transgressions—\nthus they invited death.\n\nLaozi said:\nTo govern the world with the Dao\nis not to alter human nature,\nbut to nurture what already exists,\nexpanding it fully—\nthus following is vast,\nforcing is small.\n\nAncient dike-builders followed the river’s flow,\nfarmers followed the land’s suitability,\nwarriors followed the people’s will—\nto follow is to be unconquerable under Heaven.\n\nThings must first exist naturally\nbefore human affairs can be ordered.\nObserving that all things have inherent natures,\none then aligns with their suitability,\nfollows the people’s desires—\nthen undertakings succeed without fail,\nactions bring no harm.\n\nThus the ancient kings’ laws\nregulated human nature with measured restraints.\nWhat lacked that nature could not be made to conform,\nwhat had it but lacked resources could not be made to obey the Way.\nWood cannot be made to rise from water,\nmetal cannot be made to generate fire.\n\nHumans possess the potential for benevolence and righteousness,\nyet without the Sage’s guidance,\nlaws and measures cannot make them align.\nBy prohibiting what they hate,\ndelinquency is checked—\npunishments unused, authority moves like a god.\n\nFollow their nature, and the world obeys;\ncontradict it, and laws are issued in vain.\nMorality and virtue,\nthough rooted in human nature,\nrequire the Sage-King’s laws to take form.\nBy wielding rewards and punishments,\nguiding with virtue,\naligning with ritual,\nenforcing with law—\nonly then can nature be bent to purpose,\nthough it resists.\n\nFollow their nature, and response is divine;\ncontradict it, and even commands go unheeded.\n\nMorality and virtue\nare the foundation of merit and renown,\nwhat the people cherish—\nwhen cherished, merit and renown stand firm.\nWithout morality and virtue,\nno merit or renown can be established.\n\nThe ancient wise rulers modeled themselves on the rivers and seas:\nthe rivers and seas act without effort to become great,\nhumble themselves to become vast—\nthus they endure as Heaven’s valleys,\ntheir virtue sufficient.\nWithout action, they receive all streams;\nwithout seeking, they obtain;\nwithout striving, they arrive—\nthus they hold the world.\nThey do not claim what they possess,\nso they grow rich;\nthey do not flaunt what they know,\nso they become clear;\nthey do not boast of their strength,\nso they endure;\nthey dwell in what is not theirs,\nso they rule the world.\nThey do not contend,\nso none can contend with them.\nThey do not vie for greatness,\nso they achieve it.\n\nThe rivers and seas are close to the Dao,\nthus they endure alongside Heaven and Earth,\ntheir virtue complete.\nWithout claiming,\nthey grow strong;\nstrong yet not violent toward others,\ntheir Dao deep,\ntheir virtue profound—\nthus their merit and renown are fulfilled.\nThis is called the Mysterious Virtue,\nprofound and distant,\ncontrary to all things.\n\nThe world values the exalted,\nI embrace the lowly;\nthe world prizes boasting,\nI avoid contention;\nI dwell where none claim to be—\nthus I am contrary to all things.\n\nThe world has a beginning,\nyet none knows its principle—\nonly the Sage understands its source.\nNeither male nor

who possesses a clear mirror\nwill see the purest essence.\nIn governing the state, ministers vie to honor him.\nIf he does not lightly risk his body,\nthen ten thousand armies will guard him without abandon.\n\nLaozi said:\nHe who knows and loves to ask is sage,\nhe who is courageous and loves to ask is victorious.\nHe who rides upon the wisdom of the masses\ncan undertake any task,\nhe who employs the strength of the masses\ncan overcome any challenge.\nTo employ the strength of the masses,\neven Wu Ge is insufficient to rely upon.\nTo ride upon the momentum of the masses,\neven the

momentum.\nEmploying the masses’ wisdom,\neven ghosts and gods, though hidden,\ncan be clarified by their reasoning.\nWithout strategy, no force can prevail,\nyet without adhering to principle,\neven the sage cannot succeed.\n\nWhen schemes are laid bare,\neven a commoner can wield a crossbow of ten thousand *jin*.\nWhen reason is perverted,\neven the sage cannot bend a child’s words.\n\nThus the sage, in all undertakings,\nnever fails to utilize their resources.\n\nHe who has one talent occupies one post,\nhe who has one ability serves one task.\nIf strength exceeds the task, the burden is not heavy,\nif ability exceeds the task, the labor is not difficult.\nThe sage employs all together,\nthus no person is discarded,\nno material wasted.\nUtilizing their talents, all exhaust their abilities.\nUtilizing their strengths, all give their utmost.\n\nLaozi said:\nSo-called *wuwei* is not\nthat which, when pulled, does not come,\nwhen pushed, does not go,\nwhen pressed, does not respond,\nwhen moved, does not stir,\nwhen stagnant, does not flow,\nwhen gathered, does not disperse.\nOnly he who adapts and follows the times,\nresponding to things without obstruction,\nis called *wuwei*.\nIt is said:\nhis private desires do not intrude upon public duty,\nhis appetites do not cling to proper conduct.\nHe acts in accordance with principle,\nachieves success through resources,\npushes natural momentum—\nartifice finds no place.\nWhen deeds are accomplished, he does not boast,\nwhen merit is established, he does not claim it.\n\nAs water uses a boat,\nsand uses a plow,\nearth uses a cart,\nmountains use a ladder—\nsummer floods, winter pools,\nusing height to make mountains,\nusing low to make ponds—\nthese are not my doings.\nEach employs what is advantageous,\nall gain their convenience.\nThus it is said: *not my doing*.\n\nThe sage does not shame his humble station,\nbut despises the Dao’s obstruction.\nHe does not grieve over short life,\nbut over the people’s hardship.\nThus he remains ever vacant and does nothing,\nembracing simplicity, seeing purity,\nnot mingling with things.\nEver aligning with the Dao,\nnot mingling with things.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe ancient emperors were not established\nto indulge their desires,\nthe sages who ascended the throne\ndid not seek ease for themselves.\nFor the people of the world,\nthe strong oppressed the weak,\nthe many oppressed the few,\nthe cunning deceived the simple,\nthe brave intimidated the timid.\nAgain, the wise hoarded knowledge without teaching,\naccumulated wealth without sharing—\nthus the Son of Heaven was established to unify them.\nFor one man’s wisdom could not illuminate the land,\nthus the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers were established to assist.\nFor isolated states and disparate customs could not receive his blessings,\nthus the feudal lords were established to instruct them.\nThus Heaven and Earth, the four seasons—\nnone fail to respond.\nNo

      "translated_text": "The **virtue/power** of lesser attainment\nhas its times of decline and excess,\nhence virtue has its high and low.\n\nThe **Dao/Way**-less sovereigns shine with manifest virtue,\nyet this does not mean supreme virtue—\nthus it is called *lesser virtue*.\n\nLaozi says:\nTo govern the self, the highest is the ancient, mysterious sovereign.\nTo nurture the spirit, take emptiness and clarity as the foundation.\nNext, to nurture the form, take desires as the foundation.\n\nWhen the spirit is clear and the mind is even,\nall limbs are at peace—\nthis is the foundation of nurturing life.\n\nPlump flesh, filled intestines,\nsatisfying desires—\nthese are the trivialities of nurturing life.\n\nThe spirit is the foundation of life,\nthe form is the triviality of life.\nAttaining the foundation preserves the form and aligns with the **Dao/Way**,\nwhile overvaluing the triviality causes the form to perish and return to the earth.\n\nThe sages of antiquity prioritized the foundation and did not indulge the trivial,\nfinding balance in moderation.\nLater ages abandoned the spirit and indulged the form—\nthis is truly excessive.\n\nTo govern the realm, the highest is to nurture transformation.\nThis is to transform through the **Dao/Way**.\nNext is to rectify the laws—\nmeaning penal codes.\n\nWhen people naturally yield to one another,\nstrive for humility,\ncontend for lesser gains,\nand take on laborious tasks,\nday by day they transform toward the superior,\nunaware of how it happens—\nthis is the foundation of governance,\nthe highest transformation.\n\nWith generous rewards encouraging virtue\nand fear of punishment preventing wrongdoing,\nwhen laws are properly established above,\nthe people submit below—\nthis is the triviality of governance.\n\nLater ages govern through the trivial,\nwhile earlier ages nurtured the foundation.\nFirst, one discusses governing the self,\nthen one can govern the realm.\n\nHaving a foundation means having a triviality,\njust as a whole form brings blessing to the body.\nThus, when one knows the **Dao/Way** and virtue is complete,\nthe roots of right and wrong are severed,\nbut when laws are enforced, paths of contention open.\n\nThe sage suppresses the trivial and upholds the foundation—\nhow could this not have its reasons?\n\nLaozi says:\nThe ruler who seeks to govern does not appear in every age,\nthe capable minister who can assist does not appear in every thousand.\nTo seek such a ruler with such a minister—\nthis is why perfect governance appears only once in a thousand years.\n\nThis speaks of the rarity of enlightened rulers and virtuous ministers,\nnot that they never exist in any dynasty.\nTo discuss the worthy and the unworthy,\ntheir use or disuse,\nis not like the case of King Wen’s teacher, Ji Fang,\nor King Wu Ding’s search for the oracle bone master.\n\nIf one seeks such figures exhaustively,\none would not encounter a single ruler in ten thousand years,\nnor a single minister in a thousand—\nwho then would govern the world?\n\nThe achievements of hegemons and kings\nare not established in every age.\nThis means they do not arise in every generation,\nbut the wise occupy them.\n\nIf one follows their good intentions\nand guards against their corrupt hearts,\naligning with the people in the same **Dao/Way**,\nthen the people can be made virtuous,\nand customs refined.\n\nWhat makes the sage noble is not their imposition of punishments for crimes,\nbut their understanding of where disorder arises.\n\nIf one opens the sharp edges of vice\nand lets them run wild in licentiousness,\nthen abandons them to laws and follows with punishments,\neven if they destroy the world,\nthey cannot suppress their deceit.\n\nLaws prevent what has not yet occurred,\npunishments correct what has already happened.\nYet laws must not be乱 (*luàn*—chaotic),\npunishments must not be滥 (*làn*—excessive),\nfor chaos makes them hard to uphold,\nand excess harms the innocent—\neven if they slaughter ten thousand households,\nthe wickedness will not cease.\n\nLaozi says:\nTo stand above the rivers and seas,\nyet have the heart beneath the imperial gate—\nthis is to *heavy life*.\nTo *heavy life* is to burden one’s existence.\nTo *heavy life* is to be burdened by desires,\nyet still unable to overcome them—\nif one follows them, the spirit suffers no harm.\nIf one cannot overcome them yet forcibly resists,\nthis is called *double injury*.\nThose with *double injury* have no longevity.\n\nThe mind cannot serve two purposes at once,\nnor can two affairs arise simultaneously.\nJust as one stands in a secluded, open place\nyet longs for a scene of splendor and honor—\nif one abandons the body to follow the mind,\none can avoid burden.\nBut if one suppresses the body and defies the mind,\nthe two hearts war within—\nthis is called *double injury*.\nTo pray for longevity while bearing *double injury*—\nthis is no empty boast.\n\nThus it is said:\nTo know harmony is to know constancy,\nto know constancy is to know enlightenment.\nTo increase life is auspicious,\nto let the mind direct the *qi* is strength—\nthis is called *mysterious unity*.\n\nUsing its radiance,\nit returns to its clarity.\nBathing the spirit in harmony,\nharmony makes one constant with Heaven and Earth;\nunifying the *qi* with enlightenment,\nenlightenment makes one luminous with the sun and moon.\n\nLaozi says:\nNothing is easier than doing good,\nnothing is harder than doing evil.\n\nWhat is called *doing good* is\nto be still and do nothing,\nto follow nature and avoid excess,\nto avoid temptations,\nto follow one’s true nature and preserve integrity,\nto remain unchanging in oneself—\nthus it is said that *doing good is easy*.\n\nWhat is called *doing evil* is difficult—\nusurpation, regicide, deceit, and haste,\nwith many desires—\nthese are not human nature,\nthus it is said that *doing evil is hard*.\n\nGenerally, people find it easy to do good\nbut difficult to do evil.\nYet what is now considered a great calamity\narises from the lack of constancy in moderation.\n\nThus, in places of gain and loss,\nat the juncture of fortune and misfortune,\none must be discerning.\n\nThe sage has no desires,\nno evasions.\nIf one desires something,\npursuing it only leads to its loss;\nif one avoids something,\navoiding it only leads to its approach.\n\nWhen the will has desires,\nit forgets its purpose.\nThus the sage examines the shifts between action and stillness,\nadjusting the measure of giving and receiving,\nbalancing love and hate,\nharmonizing joy and anger.\n\nIf action and stillness are balanced,\ncalamity will not assail.\nIf giving and receiving are measured,\nguilt will not burden.\nIf love and hate are reasoned,\nworry will not approach.\nIf joy and anger are harmonized,\ngrievance will not offend.\n\nThose who embody the **Dao/Way**\ndo not seek gain lightly,\ndo not shun disaster,\nand what they do not abandon, they do not control.\nThey are always full yet never overflowing,\nconstantly empty yet easily sustained.\n\nThus, if one governs by **Dao/Way** and measure,\nfood fills the empty,\nclothing wards off cold,\nsufficient for warmth and nourishment in a seven-foot frame.\nWithout **Dao/Way** and measure,\neven with the power of a great state,\nit is insufficient for satisfaction;\neven with the wealth of the world,\nit is insufficient for joy.\n\nIf one truly knows contentment,\neven a single gourd’s worth is abundant,\nbut if one is insatiable,\neven ruling the world is insufficient.\n\nThus the sage’s mind is even,\ntheir will is simple,\ntheir spirit internally guarded—\nexternal things cannot deceive them.",

      "translated_text": "When the mind is preserved in tranquility and harmony,\nhow can external things overwhelm one’s emotions and desires?\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"He who overcomes others has strength,\nbut he who overcomes himself is truly powerful.\"*\n\nOne who can be powerful must rely on others’ strength;\none who relies on others’ strength must win their hearts;\none who wins hearts must first attain self-mastery.\nThere has never been one who gained others while losing themselves,\nnor one who lost themselves while gaining others.\n\nThis is to say:\n*\"The soft overcomes the hard,\nthe weak obtains the strong.\"*\n\nStrength lies not in oneself but in the multitude—\nso I embrace all strength without losing others’ strength.\nDominion lies not in oneself but in the hearts of the people—\nso all hearts become mine, and thus I win their hearts.\n\nTherefore, the foundation of governance lies in calming the people;\nthe means to calm them is in ensuring their sufficiency;\nthe root of sufficiency is in not disrupting the seasons;\nthe way to not disrupt the seasons is in reducing labor;\nthe root of reducing labor is in moderating expenditure;\nthe root of moderating expenditure is in eliminating arrogance;\nthe root of eliminating arrogance is in embracing emptiness and nothingness.\n\nThis means the ruler does not build lofty pavilions or expand vast parks—\nthen the people will diligently farm without their time being stolen.\n\nThe nature of arrogance and excess,\nthe craving for splendor and luxury,\ncannot be abandoned unless rooted in emptiness and **Dao/Way-virtue**.\nThus, one who understands the nature of life\ndoes not pursue what life cannot provide;\none who understands the nature of fate\ndoes not worry over what fate cannot alter.\n\nKnowing life and fate—\nwhat need is there for worry or fear?\nDelighting in the five colors,\nindulging in flavors,\nlistening to the five tones—\nthe seven orifices contend,\nharming the single **qi-nature**.\nDaily indulging in perverse desires,\nexhausting the natural harmony—\nthe body cannot even be governed,\nhow much less the world?\n\nThe one who truly gains the world\ndoes not claim it by seizing power or titles,\nbut by aligning the world’s heart and harnessing its strength.\n\nTo have the name of ruler without a single person’s loyalty—\nthis is to have lost the world.\nThus, Jie and Zhou were not true kings,\nwhile Tang and Wu were not rebels.\n\nWhen the world follows the **Dao/Way**,\nits defense lies in the four frontier regions;\nwhen the world loses the **Dao/Way**,\nits defense lies with the feudal lords.\nWhen feudal lords follow the **Dao/Way**,\ntheir defense lies in their borders;\nwhen they lose the **Dao/Way**,\ntheir defense lies with their closest retainers.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Do not rely on others not taking from you,\nbut on your inability to be taken from.\"*\nTo practice a path that can be seized\nwhile rejecting usurpation and regicide\nis of no benefit in holding the world.\n\nThe sage governs the world\nby cultivating the self and calming the people,\nnot by chasing titles or power.\nThus, those who follow the **Dao/Way** are revered,\nwhile those without **virtue/power** are abandoned.\nThe world is not a private possession—\nonly the good are worthy of it.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"The wise ruler does not alter established ways,\nnor change what is constant.\"*\n\nAnger is contrary to **virtue/power**,\nweapons are instruments of calamity,\nand contention is the source of disorder.\nPlotting in secret goes against **virtue/power**,\ndelighting in weapons exacerbates disorder,\nand governing through contention is the height of perversity.\n\nNo one can bring calamity upon others\nwithout first cultivating it within themselves.\nInstead, blunt their sharpness,\nresolve their conflicts,\nharmonize their brilliance,\nand blend their dust.\nHuman nature desires to excel over others\nand resents those who surpass them.\nDesiring to excel breeds contention;\nresenting others breeds grievance and strife.\nGrievance and strife disrupt the mind and invert the **qi**.\nThus, ancient sage-kings eliminated contention and grievance—\nwhen grievance and strife do not arise,\nthe mind is ordered and the **qi** flows smoothly.\n\nTherefore it is said:\n*\"Do not exalt the worthy,\nso that the people do not contend.\"*\n\nTo uphold the **Dao/Way** and guard constancy is the sage’s governance;\nto indulge in confusion and invert **virtue/power** is the fool’s rule.\nIf the path of exalting the worthy is not opened,\nhow can the calamity of resentment be avoided?\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"To govern things, one does not rely on things to achieve harmony;\nto govern harmony, one does not rely on harmony to govern people;\nto govern people, one does not rely on people to govern the ruler;\nto govern the ruler, one does not rely on the ruler to govern desires;\nto govern desires, one does not rely on desires to govern nature;\nto govern nature, one does not rely on nature to govern **virtue/power**;\nto govern **virtue/power**, one does not rely on **virtue/power** to govern the **Dao/Way**.*\n\nWithout harmony, one cannot govern things;\nwithout the ruler, one cannot govern people;\nwithout nature, one cannot fulfill **virtue/power**;\nwithout **virtue/power**, one cannot illuminate the **Dao/Way**.\n\nRooting the **Dao/Way** in human nature—\nuntainted, enduring in all things—\nthis is to return to its origin and align with its true nature.\n\nClothing, food, rites, and customs\nare not inherent to human nature;\nthey are acquired from without.\nThe **Dao/Way** serves to tranquilize the spirit,\nwhile things nourish the nature.\n\nNature is the inner self;\nthings are the external world.\nSeeking external things with the inner nature,\nwhen they arrive, they fulfill its inherent demands,\nbecoming the natural order of that nature.\n\nThus, those who follow the **Dao/Way** can abandon things and return to the self.\nReturning to the self reveals the sincere desires of one’s original nature—\nthen all things rest in harmony.\n\nHuman nature is inherently balanced;\ndesires corrupt it.\nOnly those who follow the **Dao/Way** can abandon things and return to the self.\nWith self-awareness, one does not lose sight of things’ true essence;\nwithout self-awareness, one is misled by constant scheming.\n\nTo indulge desires is to lose one’s nature;\nevery action is misaligned—\ngoverning life leads to self-ruin,\ngoverning the state leads to chaos.\nThus, without understanding the **Dao/Way**, one cannot return to nature.\nFrom governing things to cultivating the **Dao/Way**,\nnone have ever been properly aligned.\n\nIllness arises from desire.\nDesire is the root of calamity,\nthe gateway to disaster—\nwithout clarifying **Dao/Way-virtue**, one cannot restore the true self.\n\nAncient sages attained this from within themselves,\nthus their commands were obeyed and prohibitions respected.\nIn all undertakings, one must first calm the mind and clarify the spirit.\nOnly when the spirit is clear and the mind composed\ncan affairs be properly ordered.\nIf judgment is clouded by praise or blame,\nif the eyes are dazzled by colors,\nhow can affairs be rightly governed?\nThus, emptiness is held in highest regard.\n\nWater, when stirred, creates waves;\n**qi**, when disordered, brings confusion.\nConfused wisdom cannot be relied upon for rectitude,\nturbulent water cannot be still.\nThus, the sage-king holds to the One\nto regulate the emotions and nature of things.\n\nThe One is the most precious—\nit has no fixed place in the world.\nThe sage-king entrusts himself to this boundlessness,\nthus commanding the world’s fate.",

is beyond imitation should not be the standard for the realm.\n\nTherefore, talent cannot be monopolized or constrained by rigid measures,\nwhile the Dao/Way and its methods may be passed down through generations.\n\nThese principles in a harmonious age—\nscholars must discern their talents and employ them accordingly.\nOnly those who grasp the luminous Dao/Way and adapt with the times\ncan assist in governance.\n\nThus, when the realm is well-ordered, even the unlearned can uphold its ways,\nand military formations can be standardized by law.\n\nWithout awaiting ancient sages, the people suffice in their own right—\nutilizing what they possess and combining their strengths.\n\nGovernance lies in timely adaptation, not in seeking novelty;\neloquence should emphasize substance, not empty rhetoric or debate.\n\nYet if one measures ability and assigns positions appropriately,\nthere will never be a time without capable rulers.\n\nWhy wait for ancient worthies when the world is already well-ordered?\n\nThe laws of the declining age\nset lofty standards yet fail to reach their mark,\nimpose heavy burdens yet cannot bear the punishment,\nand create peril yet dare not execute.\nThe people, burdened by these three oppressions,\nadorn their cunning to deceive the ruler,\npursue vice while courting danger—\nthough harsh laws and severe punishments are enforced,\nthey cannot suppress their deceit.\n\nWhen beasts are cornered, they strike;\nwhen birds are cornered, they peck;\nwhen people are cornered, they deceive—\nthis is their nature.\n\nTo apply the law and punish only when crimes are committed\nis to kill by law, not to govern.\n\nThose filled with anxiety and fear\nadorn their cunning, distort the truth, and scheme to gain advantage—\nlike birds and beasts driven to desperation,\ntheir defiant hearts disregard their own lives.\n\nThus, the Sage values the Dao/Way over laws.\n\nLaozi said:\n*The thunder’s roar can be imitated by bells and drums;\nthe shifts of wind and rain can be understood through music’s tones.\nWhat is vast and visible can be measured;\nwhat is bright and apparent can be exhausted;\nwhat is audible can be tuned;\nwhat is discernible can be distinguished.\n\nYet the utmost vastness—heaven and earth cannot contain it;\nthe utmost subtlety—spirit and clarity cannot perceive it.\n\nWind, rain, thunder, and lightning—\ntheir forms, sounds, colors, and symbols\ncan be categorized and applied to affairs.\n\nBut when it comes to the utmost vastness and subtlety—\nthis is the Dao/Way,\nwhich heaven and earth cannot encompass,\nwhich spirit and clarity cannot fathom.\n\nWhen establishing laws and calendars,\ndistinguishing the five colors,\nseparating purity and turbidity,\ndiscerning sweet and bitter tastes—\nthen the undifferentiated is dispersed into tools.\n\nWhen establishing benevolence and righteousness,\nrefining rituals and music—\nthen virtue shifts into artifice.\n\nThe people adorn their cunning to astonish the ignorant,\nemploy deceit to attack their superiors—\nthough some may uphold these ways,\nnone can truly govern with them.\n\nThe more cleverness abounds, the more virtue declines—\nthus, the perfect one remains pure and undivided.\n\nThe perfect one’s governance is\nempty, silent, and tranquil—\nseeing no desires,\nthe heart and spirit dwell in harmony,\nthe form and nature align,\nstillness embodies virtue,\naction flows with principle,\nfollowing the Dao/Way of nature\nonly when necessity arises.\n\nVague and effortless, yet the world harmonizes;\nindifferent and desireless, yet the people return to simplicity.\nWithout contention, resources suffice.\nThe giver does not hoard,\nthe receiver does not refuse—\nvirtue returns naturally,\nyet none can claim credit.\n\nSpeech without words,\nthe Dao/Way beyond explanation—\nif one attains this,\nit is called the Celestial Storehouse.\n\nTake from it without depletion,\ndraw from it without exhaustion—\nnone know its source,\nfor the undifferentiated disperses and loses its origin.\nThus, the Sage acts and refines,\nrestoring them to their natural state,\nconcealing them in the Celestial Storehouse,\ntaking without diminishing,\ngiving without excess.\n\nThis is called *Yao Guang* [Shaking Brilliance].\n*Yao Guang* is the resource for all things.\nIts luminous radiance and luminous standard\nare displayed within,\ngoverning the ten thousand things of the four quarters,\ncommanding them as its provision.\n\nLaozi said:\n*Heaven cherishes its purity,\nearth cherishes its levelness,\nhumans cherish their sincerity.\nHeaven’s purity—\nthe sun, moon, stars, and constellations,\nthunder and wind, rain and mist.\nEarth’s levelness—\nwater, fire, metal, wood, and soil.\nHuman sincerity—\nthought, perception, cleverness, joy, and anger.\n\nThus, closing the four gates,\nhalting the five pathways—\nthis aligns with the Dao/Way.\n\nSpirit and clarity are hidden in the formless,\nqi returns to its true essence.\nThe eyes see clearly yet do not gaze,\nthe ears hear keenly yet do not listen,\nthe mouth speaks appropriately yet does not speak,\nthe heart’s pathways are open yet do not deliberate.\nAbandoning action, knowing without arrogance,\nfollowing nature’s essence,\none knows yet cannot be harmed.\n\nWhen essence resides in the eyes, vision is clear;\nwhen it resides in the ears, hearing is acute;\nwhen it lingers in the mouth, speech is precise;\nwhen gathered in the heart, thought is lucid.\n\nThus, closing the four gates\nensures a life free from calamity—\nthe limbs and orifices neither die nor live,\nthis is called the True Person.\n\nHeaven’s four gates are the sun, moon, stars, and constellations.\nThe five pathways are the five phases.\n\nSpeaking of the four seasons having their due,\nthe five phases having their measure—\nthen heaven and earth are clear and bright,\nand the people and creatures flourish.\n\nHuman four gates are the heart, mouth, ears, and eyes.\nThe five pathways are the five viscera.\n\nWhen essence and spirit are preserved,\nthe four gates do not move recklessly;\nthe five pathways do not receive false stimuli—\nvision is clear, hearing is acute,\nspeech and action are without fault—\nthus, calamity and harm cannot reach the body,\nand death does not dwell in the mind.\nThis is the domain where the True Person dwells in the Dao/Way.\n\nEarth’s production of wealth\nhas no greater foundation than the five phases.\nThe Sage regulates the five phases,\nand thus governance does not falter.\n\nThe Sage, by harmonizing the five emotions with the five phases,\nprevents chaos in the world—\nhow much more so for ordinary people?\n\nLaozi said:\n*When balanced left and right,\nthere is no private preference for light or heavy,\nthus it can serve as level.\nWhen measured within and without,\nthere is no private bias for crooked or straight,\nthus it can serve as upright.\nWhen the

one cannot still the four seas;\nwithout **sagacity**, one cannot bring peace to the myriad lands.\n\n**Laozi** said:\n*\"He who can honor life,\nthough rich and noble does not harm his body with sustenance,\nthough poor and humble does not burden his form with gain.\nThough he spends ten thousand gold daily,\nhe does not indulge his mouth to harm life;\nthough his home lacks even a single

great weight on not losing it—\nyet life’s origin has endured for ages,\nand to lightly risk losing it, is this not perplexing?\n\nTo govern the world with noble rank is to entrust it with the world;\nto govern the world with love is to rely upon it with the world.\n\nThose who inherit the legacy of their ancestors yet lose it,\nmust surely do so through careless neglect.\n\nThus, if one does not blame oneself,\nthere is no way to entrust the world with oneself.\n\n**Wenzzi** asked about the foundation of ruling a state,\nand **Laozi** replied:\n*\"The foundation lies in governing oneself.\nNever have I heard of a state in disorder while the self is governed,\nnor has there ever been a state in order while the self is disordered.\nHence it is said:\nRefine oneself, and one’s **virtue/power** shall be true.\nIf one’s self is not yet governed, how much less the state?\"*\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is so supremely wondrous,\nthat a father cannot teach it to his son,\nnor can a son receive it from his father.\nThus, the **Dao/Way** that can be spoken of is not the constant **Dao/Way**;\nthe name that can be named is not the constant name.\nThe constant **Dao/Way** has no name—\nwhat can be named is not the **Dao/Way**.\nHence, what words and discourse cannot encompass,\nfathers and sons cannot pass it on.\n\n**Wenzzi** asked:\n*\"What conduct ensures the people love their ruler?\"*\n**Laozi** replied:\n*\"Lead them with proper timing,\nand treat them with reverence and caution,\nas though standing at the edge of a deep abyss,\nor walking on thin ice.\nBetween heaven and earth,\nthe good become my nurtured subjects,\nthe unworthy become my **enemies**.\nIn ancient times, the ministers of Xia and Shang,\navenged the wrongs of Jie and Zhou\nand served as subjects to Tang and Wu.\nThe people of Huosha,\nattacked their own lord\nand joined the followers of **Shennong**.*\n\nHence it is said:\n*\"What the people fear,\none must not fail to fear.\nWhat is truly fearsome is not the ruler,\nwhat is truly fearsome is not mere goodness.\"*\n\n**Laozi** said:\n*\"To govern the great,\nthe **Dao/Way** cannot be trifling;\nto rule vast lands,\nthe measures cannot be narrow;\nto occupy high station,\nthe duties cannot be burdensome;\nto lead many people,\nthe teachings cannot be harsh.\nBurdensome duties are hard to govern,\nharsh laws are hard to implement,\ndemands that are excessive are hard to satisfy.\nMeasure an inch with a ruler,\nand by a yard it will surely be off;\nweigh a **qian** with a balance,\nand by a **dan** it will surely be excessive.\nYet weigh with a balance and measure with a ruler,\nand even by a **dan** or a yard,\nthe errors will be few.\nIt is easy to be wise in broad strokes,\nbut subtle reasoning is hard to make sagacious.\nThe **Dao/Way** lies hidden in small things yet achieves greatness,\nwords lie hidden in simplicity yet reveal superficiality.\nThus, what does not benefit governance\nbut instead harms it,\nthe **saintly** does not practice;\nwhat does not benefit utility\nbut instead wastes it,\nthe wise do not employ.\n\nHence, deeds are not to be scorned for being too restrained,\ntasks are not to be scorned for being too few,\ndemands are not to be scorned for being too sparse.\nRestrained deeds are easy to accomplish,\nfew tasks are easy to govern,\nsparse demands are easy to satisfy,\nand entrusting matters to the people makes it easy.\nThus, petty reasoning harms **righteousness**,\npetty **righteousness** breaks the **Dao/Way**,\nand the **Dao/Way** must be simple to be comprehensive.\nThe **saintly** are comprehensive in wisdom,\nperceiving what has not yet come to pass,\nnot allowing small things to obscure the great,\nnor burdensome matters to replace simplicity.\n\nThe river flows far because of its winding course,\nnot because it is a single ladle of water.\nThe mountain rises high because of its gradual ascent,\nnot because it is a single handful of soil.\nThe **Dao/Way** transforms because of its ease and flow,\nnot because of what is achieved in an instant.\n\nHe who excels in one skill,\nis meticulous in one matter,\nand discerning in one ability,\ncan employ clever arguments,\nbut cannot broadly apply them.\n\nThe tuner of music,\ntightens the small strings,\nand loosens the large ones;\nthe establisher of affairs,\nmakes the lowly labor,\nand lets the noble rest.\nWords say:\n*\"Balance the strings, fit the large and small—\nin governing a state, noble and lowly alike must be justly treated.\"*\n\nThe words of the **Dao/Way** say:\n*\"Vague and indistinct,\nalign with heaven’s might,\nand harmonize with heaven’s **qi**.\nHe who harmonizes with **qi** becomes **Emperor**,\nhe who harmonizes with **righteousness** becomes **King**,\nhe who harmonizes with deeds becomes **Hegemon**.\nHe who lacks all three perishes.\nHe who harmonizes with **qi** is without **virtue/power** yet is called so;\nhe who harmonizes with **righteousness** rescues the peril of the age;\nhe who harmonizes with deeds shares benefits with the people.\nWithout one of these three,\nthe peril of ruin is inevitable.\nHence, one does not speak yet is believed,\ndoes not act yet is benevolent,\ndoes not rage yet is awe-inspiring—\nthus, the **heavenly heart** moves and transforms.\n\nThe Five **Emperors** acted naturally without effort,\nharmonizing with heaven’s will.\nAll things received their life from them,\nand responded in transformation.\n\nTo act yet be benevolent,\nto speak yet be trustworthy,\nto rage yet be awe-inspiring—\nthis is what is achieved through **sincerity** and **inner power**.\n\nThe Three **Kings**’ **sincerity** and **inner power** emanated from within,\nresponding outwardly in action,\nyet still left traces,\nnot yet fully harmonized with the **heartless**.\n\nTo act yet lack benevolence,\nto speak yet lack trustworthiness,\nto rage yet lack awe—\nthis is what is achieved through mere outward appearance.\n\nThe Five **Hegemons**’ **sincerity** did not arise from the heart,\nand thus nothing responded to them.\nHence, though they raged, they were not awe-inspiring.\n\nThus, with the **Dao/Way** to guide them,\neven few laws suffice for governance;\nwithout the **Dao/Way** to guide them,\neven many laws suffice only for

warm,\nSoft yet upright,\nFierce yet benevolent.\n\nExcessive rigidity breaks,\nExcessive softness curls inward—\nThe **Dao** lies between **just** and **yielding**.\n\nLike a measuring line,\nIt can be rolled and held,\nStretched and laid straight—\nLong yet not sprawling,\nShort yet not confined,\nStraight yet not rigid—\nThus the Sage embodies it.\n\nThis is the Sage’s **harmony**.\n\nSoft yet able to stand firm—\nThe carpenter’s square and compass.\nCoiled yet able to unfold—\nThe Sage’s laws and measures.\n\nPush benevolence too far, it becomes weakness—\nWeakness lacks authority.\nPush sternness too far, it becomes brutality—\nBrutality lacks **harmony**.\nPush love too far, it becomes indulgence—\nIndulgence lacks order.\nPush punishment too far, it becomes calamity—\nCalamity breeds estrangement.\nThus, **harmony** is most valued.\n\n**Lǎozǐ** said:\n*\"A realm endures by attaining the **Dao**;\nIt perishes by obstruction of principle.\nThus the Sage observes transformations to discern their omens.\n**Virtue** waxes or wanes—\nThe winds first stir its signs.\nThose who grasp the **Dao** of life,\nThough small, shall grow great;\nThose who bear signs of ruin,\nThough established, shall fall.\nA realm’s ruin does not lie in vastness;\nThe **Dao**’s practice cannot be slighted.\nThus survival lies in attaining the **Dao**,\nNot in size;\nRuination lies in losing the **Dao**,\nNot in grandeur.\nRulers of chaotic realms\nSeek only broad lands,\nYet neglect **virtue** and **righteousness**;\nStrive for high stations,\nYet neglect **Dao** and **moral power**.\nThey abandon what sustains them,\nAnd court their own destruction.\n\nThe wise observe the wise and foolish\nTo judge the rise and fall of states—\n**Virtue** and **moral power** endure,\nNot in their scale, but in their depth.\nIf the sovereign above disrupts the **Three Lights**’ radiance,\nAnd loses the people’s hearts below—\nWho cannot fail to crumble?\n\nThus those who scrutinize themselves\nNeed not fear others.\n\nIn ancient times,\nDeep practice was called **Dao** and **virtue**,\nShallow practice, **righteousness** and **benevolence**,\nThin practice, **rites** and **wisdom**.\nThese six are the state’s vital threads.\nDeep practice brings thick blessings;\nShallow practice, thin blessings;\nFull practice—all under Heaven submits.\nIn antiquity,\nCultivating **Dao** and **virtue** rectified all under Heaven,\nCultivating **righteousness** and **benevolence** rectified a realm,\nCultivating **rites** and **wisdom** rectified a village.\nThick **virtue** brings greatness,\nThin **virtue** brings smallness—\nThus the **Dao** does not rely on martial prowess,\nNor on strength or greed to prevail,\nNor on competition to gain.\nTo stand in all under Heaven is to push oneself outward,\nTo prevail is to let all under Heaven submit of its own accord,\nTo gain is to give to all under Heaven—\nNot to seize for oneself.\nThus the yielding attains firmness,\nThe weak attain victory,\n**Righteousness** and **benevolence** attain success,\nThe non-contentious cannot be contended with.\nThus the **Dao** in all under Heaven\nIs like the great rivers and seas.\n\nHeaven’s **Dao**:\nThose who act against it perish,\nThose who grasp it lose it.\nTo covet great fame while striving for it—\nI see it as inevitable failure.\nYet even if grasped, it does not remain.\nGreat fame cannot be seized—\nIt is given by all under Heaven.\nTo give is to receive.\nAll under Heaven’s allegiance is to **virtue**.\nThus it is said:\nThe **virtue** of the highest **Dao** draws all under Heaven,\nThe **benevolence** of the highest **Dao** draws all within the seas,\nThe **righteousness** of the highest **Dao** draws a realm,\nThe **rites** of the highest **Dao** draw a village.\nWithout these four, the people will not submit.\nIf they do not submit, arms are used—\nThis is the perilous **Dao**.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Weapons are the most ominous tools.\nUsed only when unavoidable,\nVictory brings no joy in slaughter.\nThus it is said:\nIn the land of death, thorns and brambles grow—\nMournful weeping fills the air,\nFuneral rites mark the dwellings.\nTherefore the **Junzi** prioritizes **Dao** and **virtue**,\nAnd rarely resorts to arms.\nPractice varies in depth,\n**Virtue** in thickness—\n**Dao** and **virtue** cannot be momentarily abandoned,\nWarlike tools should not be recklessly wielded.\"*\n\n**Wénzǐ** asked:\n*\"Why are **righteousness**, **benevolence**, and **rites** inferior to **Dao** and **virtue**?\"*\n\n**Lǎozǐ** said:\n*\"Those who practice **benevolence** must weigh it by sorrow and joy;\nThose who practice **righteousness** must clarify giving and taking.\nWithin the Four Seas, sorrow and joy cannot reach all,\nAnd exhausting the treasury’s wealth cannot suffice for the people.\nThus kindness cannot be universal.\nTherefore, it is better to cultivate the **Dao** and practice **virtue**,\nAligning with Heaven and Earth’s nature—\nAll things then self-regulate,\nAnd all under Heaven is nourished,\nWhile **righteousness** and **benevolence** follow naturally.\n\nThus the **true man** dwells in the thick,\nNot the thin.\nKnowing the **Dao**’s **virtue** is profound while **righteousness** is shallow,\nThe Sage abides in the thick,\nNot the thin.\n\n**Rites** are the adornment of substance;\n**Benevolence** is the manifestation of kindness.\nThus **rites** follow human nature without excess,\n**Benevolence** does not overflow kindness—\nMourning the dead aligns with **benevolence**,\nFuneral rites fulfill **rites**.\nNurturing life does not force what cannot be borne,\nNor sever what cannot be abandoned—\nMeasure and moderation never stray from balance,\nAnd unearned praise finds no root.\n\nThus music suffices to unite joy,\nYet never strays from **harmony**,\nClarifying the division of life and death,\nAnd the balance of extravagance and frugality.\nWhen human nature loses **harmony**,\n**Righteousness** and **benevolence** arise,\nRegulated by **rites** and music,\nEach made clear in their place without overstepping.\n\nIn the later ages, it is not so—\nWords and deeds contradict,\nEmotions and appearances clash,\n**Rites** become burdensome adornments,\nMusic turns to licentious chaos,\nCustoms drown in worldly excess,\nPraise and blame converge in court,\nThus the **true man** is abandoned and unused.\n\nThe later age is marked by:\nMusic’s licentiousness,\n**Rites**’ corruption,\n**Rites** becoming burdensome,\nEmotions

      "translated_text": "The **Dao/Way** of clarity—Laozi says:\n\nAll who study the **Dao/Way**,\nIf they can discern the distinction between Heaven and humanity,\nAnd grasp the root of order and chaos,\nIf they purify the heart and clarify the mind to preserve it,\nAnd observe its beginning and end,\nReturning to the emptiness and stillness—\nThen they may be said to have attained it.\n\nOnly those who embody purity,\nAnd clearly return to emptiness and tranquility,\nCan truly discern the distinction between Heaven and humanity,\nAnd fathom the origins of all confusion.\n\nThe root of governance is **virtue/power** and righteousness;\nIts branches are laws and statutes.\nWhat gives birth to humanity is the root;\nWhat does not is the branch.\nRoot and branch are one in essence,\nYet their dual nature is love and desire.\n\nPrioritizing root over branch—this is the **君子** (junzi/noble one);\nPrioritizing branch over root—this is the **小人** (xiao ren/commoner).\n\nIn the birth of humanity,\nSpirit is the root,\nForm is the branch.\nThus, in the **太上** (Great Sage) era, nurturing of spirit prevails,\nAnd emotions and inclinations are regulated;\nIn the **末世** (Later Age), form is cherished,\nAnd appetites and desires run wild.\nRegulating desire clarifies the spirit,\nIndulging desire harms the body.\n\nWhen the spirit is clear and the body harmonious,\nRoot and branch mutually support,\nThen one preserves the whole body and safeguards the spirit,\nWithout diminishing its true essence.\nAll methods of cultivation and discipline vary,\nAnd inherent capacities differ—\nThus arise the distinctions between noble and common.\n\nWhen laws arise,\nThey serve to aid **virtue/power** and righteousness;\nIf laws are exalted and **virtue/power** abandoned,\nThis is like valuing one’s cap and shoes\nWhile neglecting one’s head and feet.\n\nIn governing a state,\nOne must first establish **virtue/power** and righteousness,\nThen laws and decrees to bring order.\nIf laws and decrees are emphasized,\nAnd **virtue/power** and righteousness neglected,\nThis is like neglecting one’s head and feet\nWhile valuing one’s cap and shoes.\n\n**Virtue/power** and righteousness are broad and profound.\nTo increase their height without broadening their foundation—this is ruin;\nTo extend their reach without deepening their root—this is destruction.\n\nThus, without great beams,\nOne cannot bear heavy burdens;\nTo bear burdens, none surpass **楝** (yuán, a strong tree);\nTo govern a state, none surpass **德** (virtue).\n\nThe ruler’s people are like the foundation of a city,\nOr the roots of a tree.\nDeep roots mean a firm foundation,\nA thick base means a secure height.\nFoundation and roots are like **德** (virtue) and the **Dao/Way**.\n\nWhen a foundation is deep and broad,\nYet it is destroyed—this has never occurred.\nWhen the **Dao/Way** is high and **德** (virtue) flourishes,\nYet the people do not revere it—this has never been heard.\n\nThus, what is not rooted in **德** (virtue) and the **Dao/Way**\nCannot be called a true principle;\nWhat does not align with the ancient kings\nCannot be called the **Dao/Way**.\n\nIf one does not learn from antiquity,\nAnd does not follow the **Dao/Way**,\nThen it cannot be the law of the state.\nTo merely recite the methods of one deed or one merit,\nThis is not the universal **Dao/Way**.\nTo employ bizarre and deceptive techniques,\nThis is not the great **Dao/Way** of the world.\n\nLaozi says:\nThe **Dao/Way** of governing people\nIs like **造父** (Zào Fǔ, a legendary charioteer) guiding his four horses.\nIn the time of King **周穆王** (Zhōu Mù Wáng, King Mu of Zhou),\nZào Fǔ drove his horses.\nWith reins and bit in hand,\nHe aligned their movements with his own chest,\nGained their trust from within,\nAnd harmonized their wills from without.\nThus he could take the **Dao/Way** and travel far,\nWith energy and strength to spare.\nAdvancing or retreating, turning or bending—\nAll went as he intended.\nTruly, he mastered the technique!\n\nNow, **权势** (authority and influence) are the ruler’s carriage;\nGreat ministers are the ruler’s four horses.\nThe body cannot abandon the carriage’s stability,\nThe hands cannot lose the horses’ hearts.\nThus, if the four horses are not attuned,\nZào Fǔ cannot guide them along the **Dao/Way**;\nIf ruler and ministers are not in harmony,\nEven the **圣人** (sage) cannot govern with them.\n\nTo grasp the **Dao/Way** and guide with it—\nEven mediocre talent can achieve this;\nTo clearly distinguish and demonstrate—\nEven the wicked can be restrained.\nThings come to completion while observing their changes,\nAffairs unfold while responding to their transformations.\nIf the near are not disordered,\nThen the far will naturally be governed.\nWithout employing contrived teachings,\nYet attaining the natural **Dao/Way**,\nAll actions will be without error.\n\nWith **造父**’s skill in guiding,\nOne need not fear the horses’ wild galloping;\nWith the **圣人**’s supreme governance,\nOne need not fear the people’s peril and ruin.\n\nLaozi says:\nAll who practice the **Dao/Way**,\nMust block the paths of evil and unseen forces,\nAnd prevent what has not yet occurred.\nThey value not their own self-righteousness,\nBut rather their inability to act wrongly.\nThus it is said:\nDo not allow what is desired to exist,\nOr there will be no day without strife;\nDo not allow what is to be taken to exist,\nOr there will be no day without contention.\nThus, when desires are released,\nThe public **Dao/Way** prevails.\n\nThose in excess are stopped by measure;\nThose in deficiency are urged by use.\nThus, the world can be governed by one.\n\nIf one abandons official duties\nAnd listens to praise and blame,\nIf one discards merit and labor\nAnd relies on factions and cliques,\nThen even with extraordinary talents,\nOne will not advance in office;\nWhile the people’s customs decay in the state,\nAnd ministers vie for power in court.\n\nThus, with the **Dao/Way** to guide people,\nOne is not guided by people;\nWithout the **Dao/Way**, one is constrained by people.\n**舜** (Shùn, a virtuous ruler) as a commoner\nWas revered by all under Heaven—\nBecause his **Dao/Way** endured,\nAnd thus he could guide others.\n**纣** (Zhòu, the tyrannical last king of Xia) as a ruler\nLost the loyalty of the four seas—\nBecause his **Dao/Way** perished,\nAnd thus he was constrained by others.\n\nLaozi says:\nIn governing a state, there are constants,\nYet benefiting the people is the root;\nIn governance and teaching, there is a **Dao/Way**,\nYet decrees and conduct follow antiquity.\nIf it benefits the people,\nIt need not strictly adhere to the old ways;\nIf it harmonizes with affairs,\nIt need not blindly follow custom.\n\nThus, the **圣人** adapts laws to the times,\nAnd rituals to the customs.\nClothing and tools,\nEach serve their purpose;\nLaws and decrees,\nEach suit their needs.\nThus, changing antiquity is not wrong,\nNor is following custom always commendable.\n\nWhat is valued in governance\nIs only fitting the times.\nIt is not a matter of frequent alteration.\n\nReading the books of ancient kings,\nIs not as good as hearing their words;\nHearing their words,\nIs not as good as understanding their intent.\nTo grasp their intent—\nTheir words cannot fully express it.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** that can be spoken of\nIs not the constant **Dao/Way**;\nThe name that can be named\nIs not the constant name.\nTo hold words as the **Dao/Way**,\nIs to hold words while not possessing the **Dao/Way**;\nTo cling to stone as jade,\nIs to cling to stone while not possessing jade.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** spoken of by the **圣人**\nIs like metal and stone—\nOnce refined, it cannot be altered.\nThe principles of sound and rhythm\nAre fixed and cannot be changed.\nGovernance is like the **琴瑟** (qin se, musical instruments);\nWhen the melody ends, the tuning shifts.\nSince the notes differ,\nThus it is fitting to change and adapt.\nLaws, statutes, rituals, and music\nAre the tools of governance,\nNot the governance itself.\n\nThus, those who are skilled in technique\nCannot be consulted on the ultimate **Dao/Way**,\nFor they are bound by doctrine and awaken only to the common.",

      "translated_text": "The ascent to Mount Langfeng is not within the reach of ordinary means,\nNor can those skilled in technique grasp the ultimate **Dao/Way**.\n\nLaozi said: *\"How few are the fixed laws under Heaven!*\nWhen aligning with worldly affairs,\nAttaining human principles,\nConforming to Heaven and Earth,\nAnd scrutinizing spirits and gods,\nThen governance may be rightly established.\n\nTo act conveniently in affairs,\nTo conform to humanity,\nIs sufficient to govern the world.\nNaturally harmonizing with the divine—\nWhy should there be fixed laws at all?\n\nIn ancient times, the Three Sovereigns ruled without decrees, yet the people obeyed;\nThe Five Emperors established decrees but had no punishments.\nThe Xia ruler did not break his word,\nThe Yin people took oaths,\nThe Zhou people made alliances.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns were Fu Xi, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor.\nThe Five Emperors were Shaohao, Zhuantu, Gaoxin, Tang, and Yu.\nThe Three Kings were the Xia, Yu, Tang of Yin, and King Wen of Zhou.\n\nIn the distant past, without decrees the people obeyed;\nIn later times, harsh laws bred deceit.\nThus, *wuwei* transforms effortlessly,\nWhile forced action governs with difficulty.\nOaths and alliances, once broken, invite punishment.\n\nIn the decadent age, men endure filth yet scorn humiliation,\nHoard gain yet lack shame.\nThus, laws and statutes are crafted according to customs,\nAdjusting urgency and moderation.\nTools and implements adapt to the times,\nMade suitable for their purpose.\n\nThose bound by law cannot comprehend comprehensive governance;\nThose constrained by ritual cannot respond to change.\nOnly those with singular insight and acute hearing\nCan then wield the **Dao/Way** and act accordingly.\n\nThose bound by law and text move stiffly and stagnant;\nThose with singular perception and hearing\nDo not stray from the **Dao/Way**.\n\nTo know the origin of laws is to adapt with the times;\nTo ignore the source of governance, though obedient, leads only to chaos.\n\nNow, scholars cling to tradition,\nGrasp texts and hold fast to doctrine,\nHoping to govern thereby—\nAs if without this, governance is impossible—\nLike forcing a square peg into a round hole,\nSeeking suitability is difficult indeed.\n\nTo cling to law and text without flexibility,\nBelieving oneself to govern,\nIs like forcing a square into a circle—\nHow could it ever fit?\n\nTo preserve danger and govern chaos,\nRequires wisdom beyond the ordinary,\nYet the **Dao/Way** precedes antiquity—\nEven the foolish may grasp it.\n\nThus, laws untested the **圣人** does not employ;\nWords unverified the wise ruler does not heed.\nIf matters demand it, even the foolish must act;\nIf principles conflict, even the virtuous must abandon them.\n\nWenzi asked: *\"Where do laws derive their authority?\"*\nLaozi replied: *\"Laws arise from righteousness,\nRighteousness from what benefits the many.\nWhen benefits align with the people’s heart,\nThis is the essence of governance.\n\nLaws do not descend from Heaven,\nNor emerge from Earth—\nThey arise from humanity,\nReturning to self to be rectified.\nIf one attains their root,\nDisorder is averted before it begins.\nKnowing the essentials,\nOne is not confounded by doubt;\nIf it exists within oneself,\nOne does not criticize others;\nIf it does not exist within oneself,\nOne does not blame those who establish it.\n\nThose below must not neglect what is above;\nWhat is forbidden to the people must not be practiced by the ruler.\nThus, when the ruler establishes laws,\nFirst, they must govern themselves.\n\nIf restraint begins with the self,\nThen the people will be restrained.\nThe county’s laws—\nLaws that are not laws—\nAre laws that govern the laws.\nOnce laws are established,\nThose who conform are rewarded,\nThose who deviate are punished—\nEven the noble must not lightly receive reward,\nEven the lowly must not suffer excessive punishment.\n\nThose who violate the law,\nThough virtuous, must be punished;\nThose who conform,\nThough unworthy, are guiltless.\nThus, public virtue prevails while private desires are checked.\n\nIn ancient times, officials were appointed\nTo restrain the people,\nSo they might not act wantonly;\nThe ruler was established\nTo restrain officials,\nSo they might not act unilaterally.\nLaws and the **Dao/Way** restrain the ruler,\nSo he may not act arbitrarily.\n\nWhen none act wantonly,\nThen the **Dao/Way** prevails and principles are fulfilled.\nThus, return to simplicity and *wuwei*.\n\n*Wuwei* does not mean inaction—\nIt means action arising from the self.\n\nEstablish rulers with officials,\nSo the sovereign does not act wantonly,\nAnd the people do not act unilaterally.\nThus, the sovereign upholds proper conduct,\nAnd the people do not pervert the law.\nHow difficult is it to govern the world?\n\nLaozi said:\n*The skilled in rewards spend little yet inspire many;\nThe skilled in punishments reduce crime while deterring vice;\nThe skilled in encouraging virtue use minimal means yet cultivate **德** (virtue/power);\nThe skilled in taking resources gather much yet breed no resentment.\n\nThus, the **圣人** follows what the people naturally favor to encourage virtue,\nAnd what they naturally abhor to restrain vice.\nReward one, and the world rushes to emulate;\nPunish one, and the world fears to transgress.\nThus, the greatest rewards cost nothing,\nAnd the greatest punishments are never excessive.\nThe **圣人** governs with brevity yet achieves vast results—\nThis is what is meant.\n\nThis is how the **圣人** fulfills governance.\n\nLaozi said:\n*The **臣道** (subject’s path) is to speak truthfully when appropriate,\nTo lead in action,\nTo uphold duty and clarify distinctions,\nThus achieving success.\n\nThus, when ruler and subject follow distinct paths, governance is established;\nWhen they share the same path, chaos ensues.\nEach attaining their proper place,\nActing appropriately,\nThen above and below can govern one another.\n\nThus, branches must not exceed the trunk,\nNor ends surpass the root—\nSpeech and action must balance in weight and measure.\nWhen ruler and subject are clearly distinguished,\nThen great and small do not overstep.\n\nThose who wield authority hold little yet command much,\nStand in a small place yet influence broadly,\nAdhere strictly to principle yet govern extensively.\nA tree ten *zhang* in girth supports a thousand-*jin* house—\nThis is the power of leverage.\nA five-*cun* hinge controls the opening and closing—\nThis is the power of position.\n\nWhat the people must obey today,\nThose who conform prosper,\nThose who resist perish—\nNone dare disobey—\nThis is the power of conformity.\n\nIssuing decrees and enforcing prohibitions\nRelies on the multitude for authority.\n\nRighteousness is not about exhausting the world’s benefits for the people—\nIt is about benefiting one, and the world follows.\"",

sage acts thus.\"*\n\nYet rulers today judge their ministers\nNot by their grand achievements or broad conduct,\nBut by trifling virtues—\nThus losing the way to true merit.\n\nThus, when a man has great virtue,\nHis minor flaws are overlooked;\nWhen a man has great renown,\nHis small faults are forgotten.\n\nHuman nature is never without flaw—\nWhat matters is his grand purpose.\nThough he has small errors,\nThey should not be held against him.\n\nIf his grand purpose fails,\nHis common virtues are insignificant.\nTo speak of a man’s talents as flawless is folly—\nOne must not doubt his minor faults\nBut uphold his great use.\n\nCommon virtues and slanderous words\nAre not to be trusted.\nThus, the overly meticulous fail in great success,\nWhile those who scorn conduct are shunned by the multitude.\n\nThe grand in stature has loose restraints,\nThe vast in measure earns distant praise—\nThis is the way to judge ministers.\n\nIf one judges ministers thus,\nHe will not lose the right man.\n\nAs Laozi says:\n*\"From ancient times to now,\nNo one has ever been flawless in conduct.\"*\n\nThus, the noble does not demand perfection of one man.\nNo man is fully capable—\nMeasure his talents and assign him accordingly.\n\nSquare yet not rigid,\nSharp yet not jagged,\nStraight yet not reckless,\nBroad yet not vulgar—\nIn virtue, culture, and martial prowess,\nDo not demand perfection of others.\n\nCultivate oneself with the Dao,\nAnd do not demand of others—\nThis is easy to reward.\n\nCultivate oneself with the Dao,\nAnd there will be no regrets.\n\nTo cultivate oneself without demanding of others,\nYet act in the world—\nIs this not possible?\n\nThe jade of the Xia sovereigns cannot be without blemish,\nThe moon’s pearl cannot be without impurity—\nYet the world treasures them,\nNot letting minor flaws obscure their great beauty.\n\nNow, if one fixates on another’s shortcomings\nAnd forgets their strengths,\nYet seeks merit in the world—\nThis is difficult indeed.\n\nThe jade of the Xia sovereigns and the moon’s pearl\nStill have flaws—\nHow can the worthy and noble be entirely flawless?\n\nAbandon their flaws,\nTake their strengths—\nThen no talent will be wasted.\n\nThe common view sees only\nLowly station, humble birth,\nHumiliating tasks—\nYet fails to grasp their grand purpose.\n\nMost men despise what is lowly and shameful;\nThe noble judges men by their grand purpose.\n\nThus, the way to judge a man:\nWhen he rises, observe his actions—\nThis reveals his talent.\nWhen he is wealthy, observe his generosity—\nThis reveals his virtue in aiding others.\nWhen he is impoverished, observe his principles—\nHe does not act against righteousness.\nWhen he is lowly, observe his conduct—\nHe does not dwell where the Dao is absent.\nObserve his response to calamity—\nThis reveals his courage.\nIn adversity, true benevolence and bravery are seen.\nWhen he rejoices, observe his restraint—\nHe does not overstep.\nWhen entrusted with wealth, observe his benevolence—\nHe does not take what is not his.\nWhen threatened, observe his resolve—\nHe would sacrifice himself for righteousness.\n\nThus, one may discern human nature.\n\nIf one aspect is present, he is capable;\nIf all seven are complete, he is a hero of the age.\nBy this, the worthy and foolish may be known,\nAnd loyalty and sincerity revealed.\n\nAs Laozi says:\n*\"To bend is to seek straightening,\nTo be crooked is to seek rectitude.\nBend an inch to straighten a foot,\nA small crookedness yields great rectitude—\nThe noble acts thus.\"*\n\nAll rivers flow toward the sea—\nThose that do not are not valleys.\nMen pursue different paths—\nThose who do not return to the good are not noble.\n\nNoble speech must be practicable,\nNoble action must be rooted in benevolence and righteousness.\n\nThe noble’s errors,\nLike eclipses of the sun and moon,\nDo not obscure their brilliance.\nErrors are seen by all,\nBut when corrected, all revere them.\n\nThus, the wise do not act recklessly,\nThe brave do not kill recklessly—\nChoose what must be done,\nAct according to ritual propriety,\nSo that deeds are accomplished and merit is assured,\nAnd though death comes, his name endures.\n\nDo what must be done,\nKill what must be killed—\nThen success is achieved and name is established,\nPraised by future generations.\n\nThough one may be intelligent,\nHe must ground himself in benevolence and righteousness\nBefore he stands firm.\n\nIntelligence and ability must align—\nThe sage uses benevolence and righteousness as his measure.\nThose who meet the measure are noble;\nThose who do not are petty.\n\nThough the noble may die,\nHis name does not perish;\nThough the petty may gain power,\nTheir guilt is not erased.\n\nThus, Yao and Shun did good,\nAnd the worthy praised them;\nJie and Zhou did evil,\nAnd their names were not established.\n\nThe names of good and evil endure—\nThus, the noble is cautious in avoiding evil deeds.\n\nTo hold the map of the world in one hand\nAnd slit one’s own throat with the other—\nEven the foolish would not do this,\nFor life is precious above all.\n\nTo be a guest of the \"Lone Sovereign\" at dawn\nAnd a corpse cast aside by dusk—\nThese are the actions of the foolish and petty,\nNot the conduct of the noble.\n\nTo die for one’s lord and parents is to return home—\nRighteousness is heavier than life itself.\n\nThus, the greatest benefit in the world,\nCompared to the self, is small;\nThe self, compared to righteousness, is light.\n\nThis is to take benevolence and righteousness as the measure.\n\nIs this not a lament for the times lacking in benevolence and righteousness?\n\nThus, it is fitting to speak of the noble dying for righteousness,\nAnd the petty dying for gain.\n\nAs Laozi says:\n*\"The completeness of virtue and the Dao\nIs like the sun and moon—\nEven barbarians cannot alter their course.\nIf one has the Dao,\nEven in barbarian lands, it will prevail.\nWithout the Dao,\nWhat use is the Central States?\"*\n\nIf aspirations and actions align,\nThen praise or blame depends on custom;\nIf intentions and conduct are balanced,\nThen poverty or prosperity depends on fate.\n\nIf one’s deeds are complete in the world,\nThen success is achieved;\nIf one’s efforts accord with the times,\nThen name is established.\n\nThus, those who establish merit and name\nAre simple in the world yet cautious in the times.\nWhen the time arrives,\nEven a breath’s delay is too late.",

      "translated_text": "The Authentic Scripture of the Perfected Way, Volume Twelve\n*Commentary by Mo Xi Zi*, Part One: *On Rites*\n\nLaozi said:\n\nIn the ancient age, the True Person was the sovereign of the Mysterious Old Dao.\nThrough his breathing, he harmonized the yin and yang,\nand all things born under heaven naturally revered his **virtue/power (de)** for its gentleness and compliance.\nAt that time, **领理 (lingli)** [natural governance] and **隐密 (yinmi)** [subtle mystery] were spontaneously formed,\nand the pure, unrefined essence remained undispersed,\nwhile all things flourished in great ease.\nWithin, he concealed his bright **德 (virtue)**, without, he harmonized all things,\nand the world knew no strife—\neach followed its nature, without mutual harm,\nthus all lived in perfect ease.\n\nWhen the age declined to the time of **伏羲 (Fu Xi)**,\nthe people, dimly enlightened, all sought to abandon their childlike hearts\nand awaken to the Dao of heaven and earth.\nTheir **virtue/power (de)** became complex and inconsistent.\nThen the Eight Trigrams were first drawn,\nto connect with the divine and to categorize all emotions.\nKnotted ropes were made as nets and snares,\nto hunt and fish.\nThe sovereign of the world, having abandoned childlike simplicity,\ngradually lost his original Dao—\nhis **virtue/power (de)** became complex and inconsistent,\ncompared to the Mysterious Old time, making it an age of decline.\n\nWhen **神农 (Shennong)** and **黄帝 (Huangdi)** took leadership of the world,\nthey regulated the four seasons,\nharmonized the yin and yang,\nand thus all the people refined their bodies and minds,\nlistened and observed with reverence—\nyet governance remained harsh, not harmonious.\n\n**伏羲 (Fu Xi)** created the **未耜 (weiji)** [plowshare],\nto teach the people how to sow seeds;\n**黄帝 (Huangdi)** invented the **轩冕 (xuānmìan)** [ceremonial robes],\nand **窍领 (qiàolǐng)** [to regulate with subtle governance],\nmeaning to open the blocked and to harmonize the yin and yang,\nto stop the rebellious **气 (qi)** and to cease the harming of things.\nHe established writing and contracts,\nestablished laws and calendars,\nregulated the four seasons,\nharmonized the Five Phases,\nfearing the loss of their essence—\nhe made all things refine their bodies,\nand all focused their ears and eyes,\nlistening and observing to **德化 (dehua)** [virtuous transformation],\nto uphold their sovereign.\nThus, he spoke of governance being unharmonious.\n\nIn the ages of **夏 (Xia)** and **殷 (Yin)**,\ntheir desires extended to all things,\ntheir cleverness was enticed by the external world,\nand their true nature was lost.\nWhen desires for things arose in **夏 (Xia)** and **殷 (Yin)**,\nthey were enticed by the external world;\nwhen cleverness was indulged,\ntheir true nature was lost within.\nThis spread to the **周室 (Zhou Dynasty)**,\nwhere **浇 (Jiao)** and **醇 (chún)** [debauched and refined] diluted the pure,\nabandoned the Dao for falsehood,\ntook **险 (xian)** [deceitful] **德 (virtue)** as conduct,\nand gave rise to cleverness and cunning.\nThey schemed to imitate the sages,\nadorned falsehood to please the crowd,\npolished poetry and scriptures\nto purchase fame and reputation.\nEach sought to display their cleverness,\nto use falsehood to fit into the world,\nand thus lost the true essence of the great Dao.\nHence, the world has long been losing its true nature,\nand the decline has been gradual for ages.\n\nBy the time of the **周室 (Zhou Dynasty)**,\n**Dao/Way (Dao)** and **virtue/power (de)** were completely lost.\n**浇 (Jiao)** [debauched] and **酿 (niàng)** [refined] grew even more extreme,\ntaking falsehood and deceit as the Dao,\ntaking cleverness and cunning as **贤 (xian)** [virtuous excellence],\ndisplaying the Dao and boasting of **德 (virtue)**,\npurchasing fame and seeking reputation—\nthus losing the true essence of the great Dao.\nThe decline of the age began from **Fu Xi (伏羲)** and **Xuānmìan (轩冕)**,\ncounting thousands of years—\nthus it is said that the decline has been long,\nnot that it suddenly began in the **周室 (Zhou Dynasty)**.\n\nTherefore, the study of the **至人 (zhiren)** [perfected/sage] is to return to the **无 (wu)** [non-being/emptiness] of true nature,\nand to wander the mind in the **虚 (xu)** [void].\nThe study of the common world, however,\nis to **擢德 (zhuóde)** [flaunt virtue] and **攓性 (nièxìng)** [constrain nature],\nto torment the five **藏 (zang)** [organs],\nto act rashly beyond wisdom,\nand thus to **譊 (yǒu)** [create discord] with their cleverness and cunning.\nThey clamor and shout for fame in the world—\nthis is what the perfected do not do.\n**擢德 (zhuóde)** [flaunting virtue] is self-promotion,\n**攓性 (nièxìng)** [constraining nature] is to sever life.\nIf the perfected are steadfast in the meaning of death and life,\nand comprehend the logic of honor and disgrace,\nthen even if the whole world praises them, they are not further encouraged,\nand even if the whole world criticizes them, they are not discouraged.\nThis is the essence of attaining the **至道 (zhiDao)** [perfected Dao/Way].\n\nThe **至人 (zhiren)** [perfected/sage] exist in every age,\nbut they are rare.\nOne in ten thousand is already considered many.\nThe study of the perfected is to return to the **华伪 (huapí)** [false and ornate] realm of nature,\nand to bathe in the divine within the **虚静 (xūjìng)** [void and tranquil] domain.\nThey do not boast of their **德 (virtue)**,\nnor do they flaunt their talents—\ndeath and life bring no change to them,\nand harm and benefit do not affect their hearts.\nNow, the scholars of the world\nabandon true nature to seek enlightenment,\npursue fame to elevate their reputation—\nthus, the rise of deceit and decline of loyalty,\nand the concealment of the true and upright.\nIf one seeks governance of the world\nor personal peace and comfort,\nit cannot be attained.\n\nLaozi said:\n\nIn ancient times, those who ruled wore their hair unbound and had no **卷领 (juǎnlǐng)** [collared garments],\nyet they governed all under heaven.\nTheir **德 (virtue)** was born without killing,\nand they gave without taking.\nThough the people did not wear their ceremonial robes,\nthey all shared the same heart of **德 (virtue)**.\nAt that time, yin and yang were in harmony,\nand all things thrived and grew.\nThe nests of flying birds could be approached without alarm,\nand wild beasts could be tethered and followed.\nThe sovereign of the Mysterious Old Dao\ndid not wear a hat or comb his hair,\nbut let his hair flow unbound,\nand thus governed all under heaven.\nHe allowed the people to live in peace,\ndid not take their benefits—\nthus the four seasons were harmonious,\nand all things followed their nature.\nHence, the birds nested without fear,\nand the beasts were tethered without alarm.\nThis was the peak of **德 (virtue)**.\n\nWhen the age declined,\nbirds, beasts, insects, and serpents all became harm to the people,\nso iron was cast and blades were forged to repel their dangers.\nThus, when the people were pressed by their difficulties,\nthey sought convenience and ease,\nand when faced with calamities,\nthey took precautions.\nEach used their cleverness to avoid what harmed them,\nand to seek what benefited them.\nCustoms were no longer fixed,\nand tools could not be relied upon as before—\nthus the laws of the ancient kings were subject to change.\nHence it is said:\n*\"The nameable can be named,\nbut it is not the constant name.\"*\nIn the decline of the age,\nthings were no longer pure and singular,\nbut each gave rise to strange emotions,\nharming one another in succession.\nCleverness and deceit were used to deceive,\nand tools were made for defense,\nto avoid what harmed and to seek what benefited.\nThus the ancient kings changed their laws,\nnot because there was a fixed standard—\nhence, laws have no constant name.\n\nThe Five Emperors held different **Dao/Way (Dao)**,\nyet their **德 (virtue)** covered the world;\nthe Three Kings had distinct affairs,\nyet their names endured in posterity—\nall adapted to the times.\nIt is like the **师旷 (Shiguang)** [Master Musician] tuning the Five Notes,\nwhere the adjustments rise and fall without fixed measurement,\nyet all are in harmony.\nThus, those who understand the emotions of music\ncan compose the sounds.",

without knowing rites and righteousness,\none cannot implement law.\n\nLaw can punish the unfilial,\nbut cannot make people filial;\nit can punish thieves,\nbut cannot make people virtuous.\n\nWhen the Sage-King rules above,\nhe clearly demonstrates good and evil to guide the people,\npraises the worthy and censures the unworthy,\nadvances the worthy and demotes the unworthy,\nand though punishments are set,\nrites and virtue are cultivated,\nand the worthy are entrusted with governance.\n\nThus, the highest in the world are the Three Dukes,\nthe highest in a region are the Nine

the Dao of Heaven and Earth,\nto grasp the principles of human nature,\nto be vast enough to contain the many,\nto be benevolent enough to embrace the distant,\nto be wise enough to know

fairly,\nactions worthy of imitation,\nwords worthy of following—\nthis is the *jie* person.\n\nTo fulfill one’s duties without neglect,\nto act righteously without cliquishness,\nto face danger without cowardice,\nto reject gain without greed—\nthis is the *hao* person.\n\nThis is the method of selecting talent,\nthe means of knowing people.\nIf one possesses even one of these,\nthey can be used.\nIf they possess them all,\nthey are a Sage.\n\nThe heroic, exceptional, outstanding, and talented\nare placed according to their greatness and smallness,\nfrom root to branch,\nwith the heavy

      "translated_text": "The Master Laozi says:\n\nThose who make **rites** carve and polish human nature,\nstraightening and restraining their feelings—\nthough the eyes may covet them,\nthey are checked by measure.\nThough the heart may delight in them,\nthey are moderated by **rites**—\ncircumambulating, bowing low,\nflesh stiff with hunger yet not eating,\nwine offered yet not drinking,\nthe body bound in form,\nthe mind troubled, its voice imprisoned.\nTheir **virtue** restrains the harmony of yin and yang,\nforcing the natural inclinations of life and death—\nthus, they become sorrowful men all their days.\n\nWhy so? They do not root out the source of what is desired,\nyet they restrain what is desired;\nthey do not trace the origin of what brings delight,\nyet they prevent what brings delight—\nthis is like enclosing a beast without blocking its den,\nrestraining its wild heart,\nor damning the flow of a river while trying to stop it with one’s hand.\nHence it is said:\n*\"Open its mouth, aid its work—\nyet its life will never be saved.\"*\n\nWhen the flaws of **rites** and **music** arise,\nand the artifice of feelings is exposed,\nthey do not root out the absence of desire,\nyet they restrict what is desired;\nthey do not trace the absence of delight,\nyet they prevent what is delighted in—\nthen desire cannot be stopped,\ndelight cannot be restrained.\nDelight, when unrestrained, leads to excess;\n**rites**, when not properly observed, lead to neglect.\nAnd from opening the pen to release the beasts,\nfrom damning the river to halt its flow,\nonce truth is lost, all are bewildered and cannot return.\n\nNow, **rites** are meant to curb feelings and close desires,\nto defend oneself with **righteousness**—\nthough the feelings and heart may choke,\nand desires may burst forth,\nthe body and nature hunger and thirst,\nyet they endure what cannot be avoided—\nthus, none can complete their natural lifespan.\n\nTo uphold **rites** is to be bound and constrained,\nforced by feelings and nature,\nall striving to endure—\nthus, none complete their natural lifespan.\n\n**Rites** do not make people not desire,\nbut they restrain desire;\n**music** does not make people not delight,\nbut it restrains delight.\n\nIf one makes all under Heaven fear punishment\nand thus dare not steal or rob,\nis it not better to make them have no thieving heart?\nIf one does not open their cravings,\nwhat need is there for dikes and walls?\nIf one does not amass wealth and goods,\nthere will be no thieves to steal or rob.\n\nThus, when one knows what is truly useless,\neven the greedy will abandon it;\nwhen one does not know what is truly useful,\nthe virtuous cannot yield to it.\n\nThat which causes the ruin of states,\ndeath at the hands of others,\nand laughter from all under Heaven—\nhas it not been desire?\nThe harm of desire is so great.\n\nWho knows the uselessness of summer furs\nand winter fans\nwill see all things turn to dust and filth.\nWho knows the uselessness of all things\nwill see them become dung and soil.\n\nHence the Way teaches:\n*\"The harm lies with those who have desire.\"*\n\nThus, to cool boiling water with a ladle,\nthe boiling only worsens—\nbut to know its root,\none need only remove the fire.\nNone know the Way better than those who have no desire;\nto stop the boiling lies in removing the kindling.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"To follow one’s nature and act is called the Dao;\nto attain one’s natural essence is called **virtue**.*\n\nOnce nature is lost,\nthen **righteousness** and **benevolence** are prized—\nbut when **righteousness** and **benevolence** stand,\nthe Dao and **virtue** are abandoned.\nPurity is scattered, **rites** and **music** take their place—\ndistinctions arise, the people are dazzled,\nand jade and pearls are treasured—\nall under Heaven contend.\n\nWhen the Dao and **virtue** are gone,\n**righteousness** and **benevolence** are insufficient to restrain their feelings,\n**rites** and **music** are insufficient to curb their desires—\none man upholds them, yet a hundred men contend—\nthen chaos ensues.\n\nNow, **rites** are meant to distinguish high and low, noble and base;\n**righteousness** is meant to harmonize the relations of\nruler and subject, father and son, elder and younger brothers,\nhusband and wife, and all human interactions.\n\nIn the **end times**, **rites** become mere etiquette,\nand **righteousness** is practiced through charity—\nrulers and subjects criticize each other,\nand kin bear grudges.\n\nThus, when water accumulates, it breeds devouring insects;\nwhen earth accumulates, it spawns self-consuming hunters—\nwhen **rites** and **music** are merely decorative,\ndeceit and falsehood arise.\nLike one who fans a fire to burn oneself,\nor throws oneself into water to drown.\n\nMoreover, **rites** and **righteousness** originally have no nature of harming others;\nwater and fire, too, have no intent to harm—\nbut when they are used contrary to their proper Way,\nthey bring disaster;\nwhen they are used in accord with their proper Way,\nthey bring blessing.\n\nIn the **end times**, governance does not accumulate means for nurturing life,\nbut pours out the pure and scatters the genuine—\nit confuses the people,\ntaking what is clear for what is turbid,\nand life and nature are scattered.\nAll strive to create chaos,\nfaith and sincerity decay,\npeople lose their nature—\nlaw contradicts **righteousness**, actions oppose profit,\nthe poor and rich vie with each other,\nand rulers and commoners are no longer distinguishable.\n\nWhen there is excess, there is yielding;\nwhen there is lack, there is contention—\nyielding gives rise to **rites** and **righteousness**,\ncontention spawns violence and disorder.\nThus, many desires lead to unchecked actions,\nand seeking indulgence brings endless strife.\n\nHence, in times of order, the petty man upholds propriety,\nand profit cannot tempt him;\nin times of chaos, the noble man becomes deceitful,\nand law cannot restrain him.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"The rulers of the **end times**,\ndrill through mountains for stones,\npluck gold and jade,\ndig up tortoises and turtles,\nmelt copper and iron—\nyet all things do not flourish.\n\nThey hollow out wombs and burn the fields,\nupset nests and

wells for drinking,\ndredge rivers to make pools,\nbuild walls for defense—\nthey trap beasts as livestock—\nthen yin and yang are disrupted,\nthe four seasons lose their order,\nthunder and lightning are shattered,\nhail and frost bring harm—\nall things wither and die,\nhalf of them perish,\nand grasses and trees dry up in summer.*\n\nThe rulers of the **end times**,\nsplit rocks to find

eyes—\nthus, they bring about discord,\nand all things lose their proper place.\nThunder and lightning strike in terror,\nhail and frost bring ruin—\nnot the fault of all the lands,\nbut the crime of one man alone.\n\nHence, Xia Jie and Shang Zhou,\nthough their cities were not unhigh,\ntheir jade and silk not few,\ntheir allure not lacking,\ntheir granaries not empty—\nsuddenly their ancestral
