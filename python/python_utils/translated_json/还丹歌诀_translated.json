  "full_translation": "**Verses on the Returned Elixir**\n\n**Title:** *Verses on the Returned Elixir*\nOriginally compiled by Yuanyangzi, likely composed in the late Tang or Five Dynasties period. Two fascicles: the first collects ten verses on the returned elixir from various masters; the second contains *The Song of Golden Liquor* by Yuanyangzi (Yang Canwei). Though the verses align with those in *Yuanyangzi’s Collected Writings on Golden Liquor*, the annotations differ. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* section, *Methods* category.\n\n**Fascicle One of *Verses on the Returned Elixir***\n*Compiled by Yuanyangzi*\n\n**The Song of the Ancient Immortals’ Affairs**\n\nThe world knows not the Dao’s depth or shallowness,\nScorning its subtle signs, faith wavers thin.\nFaith itself lacks firmness from the start,\nErroneous study leaves the Dao ungrasped within.\nBlind transmission, credulous belief—all goes awry,\nWho ponders the gate of life and death’s mystery?\nThe primal mechanism holds sixteen thousand doors,\nRefining the po, refining form, refining the medicine too.\nThose who master heaven and man must perfect all,\nThus the heavens promote them to celestial office true.\nThe narrow-minded, ignorant common folk,\nSeek to become immortals—how hard the task they view!\n\nSome may chance upon a single method’s shield,\nYet of the Dao’s ten thousand arts, not one they know.\nSince ancient times, those who fail to cultivate immortality\nMostly err in practice, their paths askew.\nDo not trust the idle Daoists of the bustling market,\nWho knead butter, spit filth, and swallow saliva’s flow.\nProud of \"River Chariot\" guiding breaths as novices,\nThey grasp not the subtle, bending limbs in vain.\nBoasting of \"chamber arts\" with exotic claims,\nYet never reversing yellow or turning black again.\nStumbling in the current, they surely harm their primal qi,\nDivining by hexagrams, they stray from the law’s domain.\nWhen fire-toxins blaze, deafness must ensue,\nWithout the elixir, vainly forcing qi to rise in vain.\nFew thoughts, few desires—no illness takes root,\nAll arts pale before the four great emptinesses’ truth.\nSuddenly ceasing alchemy, wasting years in idle drift,\nMedicine stilled, qi stilled—no moment’s pause allowed.\nThe root of death’s decay is not as they suppose,\nThe five viscera must be thoroughly refined and drained.\nSpitting a crimson cherry from the mouth,\nThis is not the five phases within the body’s frame.\nFailing to harmonize yin and yang into the supreme medicine,\nLife and death remain bound to the Three Worms’ claim.\nSome feast on rosy clouds, swallowing the two luminaries,\nBlinding their eyes, spinning like echoes in a mirror’s game.\nThose who practice qi-circulation follow countless rules,\nYet invite wind-evil, unaware of their own blame.\nSome wield talismans to command ghosts and spirits,\nWhile the golden elixir eludes them, their bodies frail as dreams.\nWhen the hundred bones scatter, they return to dust,\nA single thing reversed—ghosts and kin lament in vain.\n\nOr they speak of \"exiting the spirit\" through meditative vision,\nYet the wondrous true emptiness remains unseen.\nFalsely claiming to borrow a dwelling or enter a womb,\nThey cycle through the four births, bound to rebirth’s wheel.\nSome binge on food and wine, their faces ruddy, strength immense,\nVoices like thunder, boasting of true immortal arts.\nYet this is but the vigor of innate yang’s abundance,\nNot the fruit of alchemy’s transformative part.\nSome sleep drunk through wind and rain,\nTheir warmth but the wine’s fire, their cold the winter’s bane.\nSober, they shiver in thin robes,\nNo different from ordinary folk in their suffering’s pain.\n\nSpeaking of inner elixirs—mere illusions, empty forms,\nDeluded minds chase phantoms, lost in vain.\nThinking of a virgin girl will not conceive a child,\nA hen’s egg holds no life within.\nSome claim to be long-lived men of distant ages,\nHaving received the sword’s secret from Dongbin’s hand.\nThey deceive the foolish and ignorant,\nPassing days in wine and chess, their bonds unplanned.\nSome boast of \"yellow and white\" arts to cheat and steal,\nA thousand herbs and stones spawn illusions grand.\nThe immortals’ medicine lies within the five phases,\nWho can fathom its workings, its blessings command?\nSuch charlatans abound,\nStaving off hunger and cold, avoiding life’s hard span.\nUnknowing of the Dao’s true root and stem,\nThey age and die like hemp—what recourse remains?\n\nEven ancient immortals repaid past debts,\nDisguised in humble guise, they begged in secret ways.\nAmidst mud, tiles, and rubble they dwelt,\nYet within, their jade and treasures lay.\nThose who feign the Dao in Yan’s land follow this path,\nMute, their silence startles none.\nUnlettered, their conduct unrefined,\nTheir poverty and suffering mark them as the fallen one.\n\nTo cultivate immortality, first perfect merit and conduct,\nWhen deeds are full, heaven and man refine life’s thread.\nEmpty words of longing for the Dao, without cultivating the heart,\nAt death, the unrectified heart is to blame instead.\nSome, with scant knowledge, hastily erect a hut,\nSeeking fame and praise, emulating the southern flight’s aim.\nFailing, they turn back—only to die,\nLeaving behind slander for later men to proclaim.\n\nOthers, with shallow grasp of Chan’s words,\nCling to the ten thousand images in their minds.\nOne day, their walking corpses suddenly perish,\nThe crowd calls it \"transformation\" or \"corpse-liberation\" in kind.\nThe great Dao’s true principle is not so,\nAscending with one’s dwelling—this is the ancient, enduring lore.\nMisled by deviant arts, they die in vain,\nYet still they speak of immortals whose forms transcend the mortal shore.\n\nConsider the deceptive, heterodox, and illusory arts,\nWalking on water, flying through space—yet all is known.\nHow can such \"immortals\" transform their bodies’ gate,\nIf they cannot reverse aging, preserving form and bone?\nTo cross the living, save the dead—only the elixir suffices,\nTransmuting the five phases, qi and form made whole again.\nThe golden elixir grants heaven and man’s longevity,\nAll other arts but briefly extend the span of years’ chain.\n\nThe immortal formulas are clearly transmitted in the world,\nThe Three Caverns, Four Supplements—how can they be counted?\nHigh immortals since ancient times arose from kings and lords,\nThe biased views of common fools—how can they be anointed?\nOf old, the Heavenly Master met the Old Lord,\nReceiving a thousand scrolls, celestial texts descended.\nGe Hong’s ten thousand volumes were deemed few,\nSun Simiao’s reclusion—all were widely learned.\n\nThe ancients’ enlightenment came through texts and meaning,\nYet today’s men cling to poor teachers’ creeds.\nThe wise, through texts, find their masters,\nThe dull seek in vain—how hard the path proceeds!\nScholars past and present pore over the *Cantong Qi*,\nIts purport lies within, yet differences abound.\nFailing to grasp the source, the true intent,\nEven in old age, its meaning remains shrouded, unsound.\n\nCall it \"inner\"—speaking of tripods and furnaces, they seem to know,\nCall it \"outer\"—generating form from formlessness, they fail to see.\nThe *Cantong Qi*’s meaning is fundamentally clear,\nWithout a master’s transmission, it remains obscure eternally.\nHeaven bestows subtle guidance for a reason,\nMeeting a master, receiving the formula—true lead is seen.\nTrue lead is the metal within water,\nBorn from the indistinct, before heaven and earth’s sheen.\n\nThe northern sun, the southern moon,\nYellow silver, white gold—each in its eightfold measure.\nDragon and tiger wage war, metal and wood intertwine,\nFirst liquid, then congealed—the ointment’s body smooth and pure.\nEighty-one hues of true Kan and Li,\nThe medicine arises, the three and five unite in one’s cure.\n\nAt times, one opens their mouth to ask fellow practitioners—\nWho truly knows the White Tiger’s pivotal refining?\nThe *Huangzhong* pitch far surpasses *Dacu*,\nDirect signs and affairs follow the stars and cleaving water-clocks.\nThe *wu-yin* and *shen* offices mark solstices and equinoxes,\nThe *jiazi* and *jisi* divide the primal seasons.\nHexagrammic fire waxes and wanes through nine cycles,\nBlue, yellow, red, white revolve in turn.\nWithin the furnace lies another heaven and earth,\nCold and heat, dawn and dusk traverse Fan Mountain.\nThe thief of creation comes—hard to speak plainly—\nThe Five Phases engender and yet assail one another.\nIn a single day, a year is seized;\nIn a year’s exchange, a month is found.\nWhen the moon moves to *ding*, the medicine rises and falls—\nThis is metal’s journey from the land of fire.\nWhen the moon moves to *bing*, the Returned Elixir submits;\nAt *si*, metal is born, mercury’s nature perishes.\nFrom *zi* to *si*, the Qian body is complete;\nFrom *wu* to *hai*, it begins anew.\nInverting and balancing, refining yin and yang—\nWho discerns the true Metal and Wood?\nAt *mao* and *you*, Metal and Wood appear,\nThe bodies of *jia* and *geng* inherently float and sink.\nA full cycle lacks but thirty spokes,\nYet in a month’s reckoning, the hub is seen.\nIn the second month, the Dipper’s handle turns west,\nFour yang respond to the season—elm flowers fall.\nIn the eighth month, the *Kui* star stands at due *you*,\nShepherd’s purse and wheat sprout—Wood’s work is known.\nThe *Bo* hexagram: the elixir is complete, yet it slays;\nThe Nine Returns revive and restore the soul.\nWhere Bo Yang’s white dog briefly vanished—\nHave you heard of this matter or not?\nWhen ingested, old illnesses arise one by one,\nTransforming skin, hair, bones, and marrow.\nJade-like skin, gleaming teeth—youth returns,\nAnother immortal from the Peach Blossom Spring.\nA knife-tip of powder transmutes mercury into gold,\nWhen lead and tin are touched, their hue deepens.\nThe divine elixir at the elbow roams the eight poles,\nTraversing mountains and seas, ghosts and spirits revere it.\nThe divine cinnabar is utterly real, yet without form—\nThe three scrolls of the *Cantong Qi* bear no single mark.\nLearn well to recognize the sun’s radiance and the moon’s glow,\nClearly they are not of this world’s things.\nThe deluded take cinnabar and mercury,\nOr even minerals and metals, to be the true.\nTrue gold, when dead, is like ash and dust,\nThus it earns the name \"Bright Window Dust.\"\nI once concealed myself until a master’s guidance—\nIt was the true divine water of the Flowery Pond.\nAttaining the Dao depends on natural affinity,\nWho in halls of wealth would believe this?\nThe world’s eyes see my afflicted frame,\nAnd say illness burdens me—these words are false.\nThey know not that I am tested by heavenly demons,\nWhen the great medicine touches me, ailments vanish of themselves.\nMy affinity has led me to know this one truth,\nYet I remain unattached, tending no small defense.\nThis heart has reached the immortals’ gate,\nThough this mortal body still bears mortal ills.\nTo become a sage or immortal is the highest mechanism—\nThose with a share in it know it all.\nThe three poisons—greed, wrath, delusion—arise from illusion,\nWho can fathom their predestination in the Three Palaces?\nThings follow fortune and misfortune, coming and going,\nWhere are those of old when their things remain?\nWorldly people are shackled by form and appearance,\nFailing to roam freely or refine the self.\nFleeting glory and the ten thousand things are fundamentally empty,\nGaining only a cycle of honor and disgrace in death.\nI once dwelled in simplicity for many years,\nStudying the classics until I met my master at last.\nA single crucible yields flowing pearls—the celestial medicine,\nWhen grape wine ripens, the sea and mountain tryst awaits.\n\nBehold—\nHeavenly beings must choose the learning of heavenly beings,\nJade tablets must be carved from fine jade.\nHeaven does not hasten the foolish below,\nA master craftsman does not select bricks and tiles for casting.\nI urge you to read widely and seek broadly,\nOne arrow cannot raise an army.\nAn immortal master must be steeped in the learning of heavenly beings—\nTruly recognize the red orb and the azure robe.\nWu the True Lord’s song:\nThe arts of immortals and transcendents are hard to encounter,\nEven with toil and suffering, one must endure to see.\n\nSwiftly cultivate hidden virtue while swiftly seeking the classics,\nWhen merit ripens, sudden enlightenment arrives in a single dawn.\nThe Great Return Elixir is no trifling matter—\nThose who ingest it roam heaven and earth.\n\nDo not mistake dead treasure for living gold,\nFor common mercury and lead are not the true ingredients.\nIf you wish to know what exists in the world,\nPonder it carefully as one ferments wine:\nWood essence becomes rice steamed seven times,\nGolden liquid becomes yeast refined over time.\nWestern earth and the Pool of Hua’s waters—\nThis substance has ever moved gods and ghosts.\nSeal the crucible’s mouth and circulate it once,\nAnd he who ingests it will exchange his bones and marrow.\n\nIf you recognize the yellow sprout yeast,\nRefine it, and it will resemble chrysanthemum blossoms.\nOrdinary folk do not know the world’s lead,\nFor the root of worldly lead is inherently different.\nWood essence and golden liquid are not two flavors—\nYin and yang, at their darkest extreme, naturally refine.\nThough lead, mercury, rice, and yeast may seem alike,\nThey must be tempered with the Four Yellows and firewood water.\nWithout firewood water, transformation is difficult—\nHow can the Nine Cycles and Seven Returns be achieved?\nThe ancient immortals spoke only of two flavors,\nNever mentioning the matter of refinement and subjugation.\nNow the secret is revealed, yet it is not much—\nOnly the Nine Origins and the Fire Record must be sought.\nAlchemists vainly pore over a thousand scrolls,\nOnly then will they know this song holds true meaning.\n\nWood becomes the Azure Dragon, gold the White Tiger,\nThe sun the Vermilion Bird, the moon the Dark Warrior.\nWhen the Four Symbols harmonize in the Central Palace,\nLong life is no longer difficult in one’s own body.\nMetal, wood, water, and fire form dust—\nWho knows which to discard and which to master?\nWorldly folk do not grasp the words of perfected beings,\nTrusting instead their own hearts and emulating the ancients.\nThey mislead others onto lost paths,\nUnaware that their own bodies will turn to dust.\nI urge you to refine the medicine and recognize the tiger—\nWhen yang meets yin, they naturally unite.\nThree hundred and sixty like congealed silk,\nThe chaste maiden becomes the mother of long life.\nWhen the work is complete, rely on the Ninefold City,\nIngest it for a thousand days, and the body ascends.\n\n**Lead and Mercury, Three-Five Chant**\nLead emerges from within lead,\nThough of the same nature, they differ.\nIf you can discern black from white,\nThe white sun is the immortal’s palace.\n*First: Red.*\n\nDo not mistake water for silver,\nNor befriend its lead.\nOnly when the Azure Dragon emerges\nWill transformation be truly natural.\n*Second: Black.*\n\nFire two, water one,\nThe three return to the east,\nThe dragon brings rain,\nWaiting for the tiger to stir the wind.\n*Third: Azure.*\n\nFive is the earth’s position,\nThe work of wu and ji,\nThe emperor governs all things,\nNothing is beyond its reach.\n*Fourth: Yellow.*\n\nWithin the one is another one,\nThe true one is yang,\nThe mother of wood,\nArrayed in the west.\n*Fifth: White.*\n\nThe Perfected One truly understands:\nGold and water become silver,\nQuicksilver, white water, earth become gold,\nCinnabar.\nYin and yang, with the great medicine,\nAre refined at its heart.\nThe Four Symbols and Five Phases\nAll reside within it.\nWhen these two substances transform and succeed,\nThey become the adepts of the Three Clarities.\n\n**Song of the Perfected One Wei**\nZhen, Li, Kan, and Dui take their forms,\nLead and mercury must first distinguish false from true.\nWhen the dragon parts the eastern dawn, though its traces are hidden,\nThe tiger departs the western wastes, then the spirit is freed.\nIn the south, fire awaits its descent and control,\nIn the north, springs arise to unlock the gate of exchange.\nOnly these two forge creation—\nDo not recklessly mix the Eight Stones with mundane dust.\n\n**The Gathering of the Return Elixir by Master Xiaoyao**\nMaster Xiaoyao gathers the Return Elixir,\nBorrowing the analogy of marriage to illustrate its completion.\nWith its ingredients—ruler, minister, host, and guest—\nResonating and harmonizing, three matters are arranged.\nListen well, for there is substance in what follows:\nA substance dark and profound, chaotic and indistinct,\nPure and numinous—\nHeaven cannot kill it, earth cannot punish it.\nWhy does it exist? From whence does it arise?\nOnce formed, it does not die—hence it is called long life.\nThe tortoise must undergo nine transformations,\nThe rooster seven returns.\nWhen the bones are strong and the flesh at ease,\nThe spirit bright and the countenance preserved,\nOne knows the maiden is ready for marriage,\nThe man fit for union.\nA skilled matchmaker arranges the meeting,\nThe uncle represents heaven and earth.\nOn an auspicious day, with kin gathered like clouds,\nFeasts are laid, seats arranged, inside and out abuzz.\nAh! How splendid and resplendent!\n\nThey spread yellow gold for mats, white jade for carpets,\nSeating arranged by rank, the worthy and wise in order.\nThe bold-hearted sit beside the great tiger,\nWhile the other gallant guests stretch out in a line.\nRed and radiant, filling the chambers,\nThe white-haired elder presides over the game,\nThe Azure Dragon youth guards the door.\nBefore the gate, carriages and horses crowd the courtyard,\nPurple clouds swirl, golden censers burn,\nFragrance thick and rich, ascending to the nine heavens.\nNaturally, the kitchen prepares roasted and boiled delicacies,\nAt the table, calls and laughter intertwine.\nThe Ghostly Lu Brother pours wine,\nThe Eastern Family’s disciples tend the fire,\nThe Ochre Gentleman is summoned to beat time,\nThe various clans’ youths are ordered to tune their strings.\nLong melodies draw out the spring willows,\nAll at once, purple mist swirls,\nThe two yellows and four whites are fully present.\nComing and going, rushing and dashing,\nBefore the people and behind the horses, inhaling and swallowing warmth,\nWith propriety and justice, no factions or bias.\nSome chant \"Ten thousand years,\"\nOthers sing of joy for a thousand.\nThe hall resounds with song, the room with merriment,\nThe host, seeing this, is delighted and at ease.\nHe calls for the Unburnt Ash Child to tend the furnace,\nThe Elm Sweet Child to wipe the table,\nAdd vegetables, adjust salt and sour,\nWarm the wine, let it not grow cold.\nThe doorkeeper stands watch,\nThe guests linger, reluctant to part.\n\"Dear friends, few days remain before we must bid farewell,\nDo not fear the deep night or the late hour.\"\nThe host harmonizes his voice to soothe the guests’ weariness,\nEncouraging the worthy.\nA poor household’s gathering,\nYet it is the karma of past lives—\nWith nothing more to offer, he deeply thanks their kindness.\nThen the guests leap up,\nResponding with humble words.\nHalf claim drunkenness, apologizing for their clamor,\nEmpty-handed and flushed, disturbing the wise.\nFor three days and six nights, no rest is found.\nTo serve such poor brothers brings shame beyond measure.\nThe host says: \"We grow like trees, brothers sharing the same root.\"\n\nGirls who reach marriageable age must be wed,\nBoys who come of age must take a wife.\nToday we bear witness to this union,\nIn days to come, remember this deep kindness.\nThe host remains, the guests depart,\nTheir hearts still lingering, suspended in longing.\nFor eight or nine days the door stayed shut,\nOnly today was it first flung open.\nAt this moment, rites are complete.\nThe music has passed its time, kinfolk disperse,\nThe bride returns to her chamber—\nOnly the man and woman remain,\nClinging to each other in tender reluctance.\nLike sun and moon,\nThey follow each other through kalpas unending.\nThis is the one method,\nThe root and foundation of the Dao.\nNot even sages and worthies can fathom it,\nNor gods and spirits comprehend.\nOnly my master and I have grasped it—\nGuard it closely, practice it in secret.\nKeep it hidden without fail,\nAnd you will never stray from the Dao.\nLet no triple leak occur,\nNor the five know of it.\nIf you hold to this and the Dao,\nKeep it secret, secret—\nSuch wonders are beyond thought.\n\nMaster Xiaoyao says:\nOnce hidden in mystery, now fierce as a tiger,\nPity the Five Agents—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth.\nYet within them dwells a white-haired elder,\nPointing the way to the azure sky all day long.\nIf a scholar of the Dao should meet him,\nExert every effort to cherish and grasp this truth.\n\nHe also says:\nThe Dao may be transmitted,\nBut if kept secret, Heaven’s Way flourishes.\nThose who seek long life,\nHonor and obey father and mother.\n\n**Ode on the Nine Cycles of the Yellow Lady of Mount Emei**\nThe old hermit, favored by grace,\nRefines the elixir within the forbidden chamber.\nIn the crucible, all medicines transform,\nAbove the furnace, mercury takes flight.\nLike autumn frost in hue, the jade unites,\nIts radiance holding the moon’s nightly glow.\nAll arises from the Enlightened Lord’s inspiration,\nEnabling the Dao’s subtleties to unfold.\n\nFirst, draw forth the mercury,\nThen burn it back into cinnabar.\nThe method of the immortals is most secret,\nThe essence of alchemy in the inner court.\nPurple-black bears the true color,\nCrimson light mingles with dawn’s rosy clouds.\nTo merge into one body,\nOne must fiercely refine the Three Flowers.\nCycle upon cycle, delving into the profound,\nLayer upon layer, entering the boundless void.\nThe cinnabar’s body now shifts,\nReturning to mercury’s form.\nBlack as autumn frost, still,\nCrimson light like stars at dusk.\nNaturally it becomes the marvelous maiden—\nWhat fear is there of failing to attain the numinous?\n\nThough white tin first melts,\nThe yellow sprout has already congealed.\nLike snow descending from heaven,\nOr ice forming on a pool’s surface.\nGrind the dry earth and stir-fry,\nSift the ash and steam with moisture.\nStill, watch for the black hue,\nThen wait for the brine to settle.\nRegulate the fire with civil and martial balance,\nSeal the furnace with yin and yang.\nIn the crucible, observe the black pass,\nIn the pot, discern true emptiness.\nReinforce with repeated nurturing,\nGuard against the six medicines’ corruption.\nOnce hardened like joined jade,\nWhere can one find a straying pearl?\n\nNiter poured into boiling water,\nBorax steeped in simmering brew.\nSalt’s excess merely transforms,\nAlum’s fine grains need no grinding.\nOld white hardens at first,\nNew yellow’s hue not yet firm.\nBefore placing it in the fire,\nFear the mercury’s fumes.\nCease the fire, open the elixir’s cauldron,\nRefine the gold, remove the medicinal mud.\nAuspicious light joins sun and moon,\nTrue qi mingles with rainbow’s sheen.\nIts form excels the golden tripod,\nIts essence gathers toward the horse’s hoof.\nOnly after nine cycles are complete,\nBehold the single *dao* knife’s measure.\n\nGround to powder, refined anew,\nTest its worth before the furnace.\nLike dust, half-purple startles the eye,\nLike silk, all-yellow evokes wonder.\nAuspicious as three stalks of grain,\nNuminous with five-colored light.\nWait until the gold’s poison is fully drawn,\nThen present it beside the jade steps.\n\nWhen the jade pitchpipe heralds spring’s return,\nThe golden elixir responds to the Emperor’s devotion.\nMay the Southern Mountains share the Sage’s longevity,\nThe Eastern Sea match the age’s purity.\nBlessings flow from the Mysterious Origin’s virtue,\nMerit arises from the Supreme Dao’s manifestation.\nThough this humble servant possesses the art,\nThe immortal transcends the thatched hut’s bounds.\n\n**Song of the Lesser Return Elixir of White Metal**\nThe Emperor asked the Perfected One:\n\"The Dao is fundamentally without duality,\nAll converging in the One.\nMedicines have many functions,\nYet how can the body be aided and blessed?\nI beg your compassion,\nHasten to save my life.\"\n\nThe Perfected One replied:\n\"Body in harmony with the black,\nMedicine sharing the primordial essence—\nThe two Dao align with the mechanism,\nAnd decrepitude naturally recedes.\nDo not seek the great elixir,\nFor sun and moon’s timing is hard to await.\nA single taste of white metal\nProlongs life and augments years.\nThe immortals guard this secret,\nNever transmitting it lightly.\nIf you can keep it hidden,\nDo not lightly disclose it.\"\n\nIn all twelve verses,\nThe transformations of medicines and methods\nAre none other than water’s essence.\nThe Six Fungi lend their hues,\nThe yellow sprout grows naturally.\nYang’s light does not rise,\nYin’s flow makes no sound.\nThe Dao’s method is secret yet simple,\nYet scholars find it hard to achieve.\n\nFirst nurture the yellow youth,\nBegin by restraining the household ghosts.\nExhaust death to support metal,\nLet remaining life restrain water.\nIf one can grasp this principle,\nAll will penetrate its truth.\nReceive the Sage’s words in person,\nFor the matter is hard to fathom alone.\n\nHollow the base to avoid scorching,\nKnow the white, guard the black,\nRefine the yellow into one branch.\nAvoid yin’s filth,\nAnd within a hundred days,\nThe great Dao of longevity—\nEasy to understand, hard to know.\n\nThe Yellow Lad, pure and refined,\nWeds the Mysterious Consort.\nGold’s power grows strong,\nThe medicine matures, the body flourishes.\nThe earthen dwelling holds three parts,\nThe fire chamber embodies the Two Modes.\nSupreme virtue dissolves yin,\nPure yang abides in subtlety.\nA single taste of white metal\nFortifies human decrepitude.\nMixed natures are hard to guard,\nBut shared resolve is easy to maintain.\nConsume a thousand grains,\nAnd for a hundred days, no harm will come.\nTen thousand illnesses gradually fade,\nHeaven’s years, Earth’s longevity.\n\nFollow the oral instructions,\nCherish the transmission in person.\nAfter seven days, it naturally subdues,\nTen thousand moments, firmly secured.\nRefined a thousand times, boiled ten thousand,\nEntrusted to the Five Worthies.\nStore it well in a golden vessel,\nNever sever the Mysterious Pass.\nDaub the four walls with ochre,\nGuard the cinnabar at the round door.\nOne resides in the fire’s coffer,\nTwo in the ash pit.\nFive toads can be preserved,\nThree crows, no doubt.\nThe Dao’s essence unfolds slowly,\nEach day growing more wondrous.\n\nOne yellow, two white,\nThree *zhu*, two made.\nNurture until the toad is full,\nRaise the lofty crane.\nAvoid other distractions,\nThe Dao and body will naturally rejoice.\nTransmit to the unworthy,\nAnd heaven’s calamity, earth’s cruelty will follow.\n\nThe sprout belongs to the Yellow Lad,\nThe medicine resides in the Mysterious Maiden.\nExternal aids are none other than\nJade fungi and pure vinegar.\nVulgar scholars hear much,\nDao Lords speak little.\nDiscrepancies in materials\nBring vain suffering.\nCopper and iron mar the form,\nCinnabar ash saps strength.\nTo verify its numinous power,\nOne must preserve its original nature.\n\nOne yin, one yang—\nThe matter is easy, the timing is the key.\n\nWithin strange clans, they herd as one,\nEach kind sharpens its own thorns.\nTo slay the Green Dragon, summon the White Tiger—\nNaturally transformed, no wind nor rain.\nSnowflakes fly.\nSnowflakes fly, the soul returns, the spirit already home,\nGathering and scattering both ruled by the waters of *ren* and *gui*.\nBeneath the Jade Canopy’s radiant bloom, the body abides in non-action.\n\nBubbling Spring’s waters,\nBubbling Spring’s waters—\nThrough spring, summer, autumn, winter, depth without end.\nWhen the time comes to traverse the world,\nThick warmth naturally governs.\n\n*Tai Bai Han Yun Zhong Huo Ji Ge*\nThe Great Dao is vast and boundless,\nYin and yang beyond fathoming.\nCreation’s unfolding, generation’s arising—\nThe world’s people cannot perceive.\nFoolishly discoursing on emptiness, they age with white hair;\nErroneously crafting, they squander their wealth.\nSeeking to prolong life and halt the years,\nThey instead wound and shorten their span.\nFrom ancient times to now, those who have loved this path\nHave brought ruin to countless lives.\nGrasping at misguided methods, ignorant of the true aim,\nWhen facing the furnace’s fire, they merely refine cinnabar to draw mercury,\nMatching yin to yellow stone,\nOr adding lead to mercury,\nOr flying mercury into streams,\nOr refining earth to claim gold,\nOr mistaking crow’s milk for honey.\nMelting lead into mercury, they call it \"Yellow Sprout\";\nMercury entering *geng* and *xin*, they name it \"Dragon and Tiger.\"\nMercury as the Great Dao—all is false.\nIf the heart is moved by profit, how can it be embraced?\nTo forge the elixir is a grave error.\n\nI, having long loved the Dao, failed to awaken to the true origin.\nSuch methods of subjugation—\nAll were personally tested.\nWitnessing the world’s people perish from plague,\nI felt deep sorrow and grief.\nObserving life and death’s fleeting passage,\nWhere could one seek the Dao?\nThus, I set forth these essential mysteries,\nTo reveal them to fellow learners.\nI meticulously detail yin and yang,\nHoping all may awaken to the Dao.\n\nNow, lead is the male within *kan*,\nRightly belonging to *ren* and *gui*.\nRefining yin to dissolve and smelt,\nNine cycles of floating and sinking—\nWhen the count is complete, it becomes *qian*,\nThus paired with the western position.\nThe world’s people see it often,\nYet do not comprehend its true origin.\n\nThe Tiger, too, manifests its form,\nFierce, sharp, and black.\nAscending to heaven, it becomes clouds and rain;\nDescending to earth, it becomes springs and sources.\nIts jade essence returns nine times,\nThe Metal Elder extinguishes fire—\nAll through the White Snow.\n\nMercury is the female within *li*,\nRightly belonging to *bing* and *ding*.\nAll things flourish and thrive,\nReceiving its darkness.\nAbove, it responds to the Azure Yang with constancy;\nBelow, it hides in the White Storehouse, sinking in concealment.\nThe Dragon soars to heaven, revealing the essence of wood;\nSpring’s arrival brings forth flowers and herbs.\nVague and indistinct, yet right before the eyes—\nSeven returns to revive the soul,\nMysterious blossoms and azure waters.\nIf one awakens to this,\nAll profound secrets become clear.\nThose who close their eyes\nWill find it hard to glimpse.\n\nThus, the Tiger of the moon’s dark phase,\nRefining the Dragon of the sun’s radiant essence,\nSubduing the shadows of the twin blacks,\nThey mutually attract and unite as husband and wife.\n*Kan* resides in the Three Flowers,\nBecoming the ultimate principle.\nTherefore, I reveal these essential mysteries\nTo those who would understand.\n\nI also chant the *Thirteen Celestial Talismans*—\nLet later learners study them closely,\nAnd they will surely grasp the true origin.\nIf you obtain this text,\nDo not recklessly disclose it.\n\nThe returning yang begins to stir,\nFollowing the cycle, the seasons shift.\nThe Dragon lurks, unable to soar,\nThe Tiger crouches, its cries rare.\nThe two blacks meet at last!\nThe Three Flowers foretell the dawn.\nFire fills the ninefold count,\nThen wanes and returns again.\n\nOn the eighteenth day before the furnace,\nHeaven and earth’s qi intermingle.\nThe Metal Youth comes to restrain wood,\nEarth stabilizes the water’s embryonic sac.\nResonance and response mutually consume and gaze,\nHarmony and unity lie in attunement.\nAdvance with the measured dripping,\nRetreat according to the hexagram’s lines.\n\nWhen the Dao prospers, await the proper moment,\nYang’s harmony begins to arise.\nThe pitch shifts in the first month,\nThe Dipper’s handle guards *yin*’s course.\nThe nobleman’s heart remains vigilant,\nYin and yang follow the seasonal sprouts.\nAfter thirty days, step forth,\nPray and refine, then return to the fire.\n\nThe Elm’s death, the *Kui* star nears *mao*—\nThe third absence marks the right time.\nThe sun’s essence and moon’s spirit,\nThese two essences unite to form the Great Dao.\nDragon and Tiger naturally contend.\nGreat Strength completes the compass and square,\nBlossoms open toward the cassia branches.\nCease the furnace, halt the fire’s timing,\nThe azure hue transforms into radiant light.\n\nAll trees contain yang,\nBlossoms open, fragrance fills the path.\nThe Golden Rooster rides the great fire,\nThe Vermilion Fire’s essence.\nThe Jade Hare wanes and is harmed,\nThe Water’s essence.\nThe wise grieve over life and death,\nHigh and low vanish in an instant.\nWhen the medicine is complete, pay homage to the Great Emperor,\nIngesting it dispels calamities.\n\nThrough bitter discipline, *qian* is refined,\nCultivating the elixir requires steadfast resolve.\nIf the Tiger wounds the Dragon, blood flows,\nIf metal slays wood, no smoke rises.\nWhen yang flourishes, yin approaches,\nProsperity gives way to decline naturally.\nStrike the sound, let it ring like a chime,\nObserve and gain extended years.\n\nAt *Chu Liu*, reaching the southern palace,\nYin ascends, pregnancy begins.\nThe pitch pipes shift frequently,\nHolding the nodes, they alternately attack.\nAfter five days, the count wanes,\nThe Three Flowers’ fate is supplied.\nBring it to the door to see—\nBloodstains, thousands deep.\n\n*Xiao Ji* wields the celestial talisman,\nYin comes, retreating in accumulated trust.\nThe Metal Elder replenishes marrow and sinew,\nThe Vermilion Bird grasps the pivotal mechanism.\nThe Dao’s body mirrors heaven and earth,\nThe harmonious medicine resides in the furnace.\nDo not treat it as mere transformation—\nIngesting it, even the dead revive.\n\nWhen *Pi* closes, the three yins descend,\nThe general slays the many blacks.\nThe Herdboy meets the Weaving Maiden at the Celestial River.\n*Jia* and *yi* injure wood,\n*Geng* and *xin* begin to sharpen the sword.\nCommands circulate through the seasonal nodes,\nCold and heat all pass through.\nWhen the moon aligns with heaven’s hardness,\nWind stirs the shepherd’s purse and wheat sprouts.\nThe Earth Lord personally conducts the sacrifice,\nThe saliva altar nurtures golden sand.\n\nThe cassia’s shadow rounds the Milky Way,\nThe sun’s harmony rhymes with purple clouds.\nThe swan arrives, the dark crow departs—\nSoon, one will see plants growing in water.\nCold yin harms the season’s beings,\nYin’s arrival withers all trees.\nSeek chrysanthemums at *wu* and *ji*,\nCrimson blood severs the Dragon’s waist.\nDecaying into earth,\nWhen lead is separated, it vanishes.\nWith a steadfast heart, cultivate the ultimate Dao,\nDo not resent the distant path.\n\nAt *Shang Liu*, dwelling in *kun*’s position,\nYin and yang encompass the beginning and end.\nThe Emperor’s son’s work becomes marrow,\nThe *Li* maiden’s blood is deep red.\nWhen two and eight unite,\nThe three differ in principle.\nOpen the furnace to behold the supreme treasure—\nIngesting it, the withered elder transforms.\n\nRevisiting the land of pure origin,\nYang hides, creating the six colds.\nAfter thirty days of refinement,\nThe nine-six elixir is complete.\nInscribe the name on the golden tablet,\nErect the altar in the immortal’s palace.\n\nRenouncing the world’s afflictions, one ascends on wings to ride the simurgh.\nSalt, gallbladder, and rice—boil the Emperor’s son and daughter with left-flavored herbs for three days and nights. Left-flavored herbs blend with yellow to form a vessel, nurtured for one seven-day cycle.\n\n*Song of Perfected Yang Xing:*\nAll in the world love elixirs,\nYet none truly find them.\nSome say use lead, some say not—\nEven when lead is used, it is still wrong.\nIf you cannot find it, do not grow angry;\nIt is because the true Yellow Sprout eludes you.\nOnly those with faith and conduct are worthy of transmission—\nThose unstained by wealth or lust are true adepts.\n\nWork in secret to aid others, never flaunt your skill,\nFor seeking immortality may instead shorten your years.\nBeware of wandering among the halls of the noble;\nLeave divination and healing to idle hands.\nIf you cannot yet retreat, with no place of leisure,\nThen seek remedies for illness—\nWhy fret over the joy of the Dao and long life?\n\nLead is the sovereign, mercury the minister,\nFire the messenger.\nThe Crimson Blood General guards yin and yang,\nCommanding and subduing the medicine.\nWhen the elixir is complete, first use it to refine mercury—\nOnce mercury is transmuted, it may be ingested.\nNo ghostly officials will pursue you, nor will you die.\nIf you attain this, seek it in quietude, not among the powerful.\n\nThe secret lies in the heart, transmitted through hand and eye.\nIf heart and mouth do not align, if hand and eye are not passed down,\nIndulging in wine and lust severs all ties to the Dao.\nWhen water in the Cinnabar Field congeals, the Yellow Sprout arises;\nAfter a hundred days of nurturing, it submits to fire.\nYin dwelling in the yang crucible is the Golden Elixir—\nAfter ten months of refinement, it is ready for ingestion.\nIngesting it preserves your complexion,\nYour hair and temples never wither, your resolve never falters.\nSelling elixirs and medicines among men,\nA thousand years of life go unrecognized.\n\nThe elixir of long life, the pill of immortality—\nThe world desires them, yet they are hard to find.\nHesitant in heart, wavering in intent,\nThe eight methods of elixir-making have long existed—\nWhy not master even one?\n\nTwo converse, plotting together,\nDay and night seeking the formula of immortality.\nIf you obtain black lead and the Old Woman,\nYou will soar into the heavens on your own wings.\nOne is left, one is right—\nWhen yin and yang are complete, the Returned Elixir is achieved.\nTruly refine it, and you will surely live long,\nRoaming freely in the purple courtyards of the immortals.\n\nThe world’s bustling crowds, with their carriages and horses,\nTheir rosy cheeks and black hair do not endure.\nAlchemical arts have been passed down for ten thousand years,\nYet seekers rush about, never finding the truth.\nIf everyone recognized the Yellow Sprout,\nHow could there be poverty in the world?\n\nOld men and women craft the great medicine—\nLead and mercury, the two metals, are not misused.\nEmerging from water, entering fire, they lose vitality,\nHalf-alive, half-dead, bound in mutual accord.\nThrough this accord, a sixty-year cycle is completed—\nAbove yin, below yang, they submit to one another.\nIf you attain this in the world’s clamor,\nNo ghostly officials will claim you, sparing you from death.\n\nLead is lead, mercury is mercury—\nYet all in the world think they can use them.\nThe Yellow Sprout of herbs, the Yellow Sprout of wood—\nAll in the world boast of them idly.\nSince ancient times, secrets were passed mouth to ear, never written—\nThose who burn offerings labor in vain, ruining their families.\n\nThe White Emperor of the West dwells in Wu Du,\nAdorned with a parrot-feathered crown, as all require.\nThe Flowery Pond is sealed for seven days—\nThe maid, through a matchmaker, finds her husband.\nWatch the furnace closely, tending to the four seasons’ darkness;\nCold and warmth, heat and chill—do not let your heart sleep.\nHonor the immortals with perfect ritual—\nA single drop of yellow gold fills the earth.\n\nLead and mercury, the two yin,\nAre the heart of the Returned Elixir.\nTheir mutual restraint is not difficult,\nYet people remain lost, never seeking.\nScholars see nothing, wasting a thousand gold pieces.\nIf you receive guidance, you create blessings and relieve poverty.\nSuch is its use—\nNeither heaven nor immortals will resent you.\nIf you recklessly reveal the Dao,\nHeaven’s wrath will be great.\nPlagues will strike, and you will face official punishment.\n\nBlack kinds do not dwell together—\nMother and child are bound in mutual accord.\nWithout lead and the Yellow Sprout,\nSubjugation is impossible.\nThe Yellow Sprout submits within yin,\nWhite Snow arises within yang.\nPlaced into the fire to burn,\nYin and yang are bound together.\nMother and child cannot escape,\nNever parting in life or death.\n\nCinnabar, oh cinnabar,\nIt saves lives and families.\nIf it can save my life,\nIt can save my family.\nIt can give birth to a wondrous maiden,\nTo wed the Yellow Sprout.\nShe serves her husband with purity,\nNeither joyful nor angry.\nShe observes rites and music, morning and evening,\nWith measured discipline.\n\nGold may be made, the world may be transcended—\nBut if gold is not achieved, you wait in vain.\nMercury’s essence lies first in the Cinnabar Field,\nThen in the yang crucible, where darkness connects.\nHarmonized for three days, it finally settles—\nKnow then that the great medicine resides in lead.\nFirst entering the yin furnace, it becomes Great White;\nLater dwelling in the yang crucible, it transforms into the Golden Elixir.\nIf people grasp this principle,\nRefining mercury will not be difficult.\n\nCinnabar and mercury enter the lead pool,\nYielding the Yellow Sprout, unknown to others.\nThis is the oral secret left by immortals—\nEven if you encounter it, you still need a teacher.\nThe teacher must clearly transmit the oral secret—\nFew in the world’s clamor speak of it.\nIn seventy years, it is passed to one—\nOnly those with immortal bones receive it clearly.\n\nThose in the world who seek the Dao\nAre foolish with wine and meat,\nWasting a hundred years in ignorance.\nThe Metal Lord is subdued—\nA single branch of the Returned Elixir.\nCinnabar subdues fire,\nCuring illness without doubt.\nLong life is within reach,\nUnshakably firm.\nNot aging, not dying—\nLike Peng Zu of old.\n\nAncient immortals obtained the essence of red copper,\nOne tael of mercury, one tael of essence.\nHalf a tael of roasted cinnabar, boiled in rice water from dawn to dusk—\nThe body becomes strong.\nCast into copper or iron, its power is like a mirror—\nGhosts and spirits fear it, unable to speak.\nIf you receive the oral secret from a perfected one,\nYou must cherish it to attain long life.\n\nWhen yang essence is firm, the hun-spirit stands;\nWhen yin essence is firm, the po-soul is complete.\nWhen hun and po are strong, the heart becomes sagely—\nRed lead and cinnabar mercury grow even more potent.\nIf you encounter an immortal who leaves this art,\nYour hun and po will stand, and you will live long.\n\nThose who know the Maiden will surely return essence;\nThose who subdue the Vermilion Child will surely remain steadfast.\nThe essence of metal, the marrow of stone—\nThese are the numinous spirits of the hun.\nThose who cultivate become sages;\nThose who subdue become potent.\nNo ghostly officials will pursue them,\nAnd their names will be recorded in the immortal registers.\n\nAt fifty or sixty, it may be passed on—\nOnly then does it first become firm and enduring.\nYet still one must conceal one’s path through medicine and divination,\nMoving or staying, sitting or lying without care.\nSince ancient times, how many have come,\nOnly to harm themselves through this art?\nOne must study yin and yang, along with divination and physiognomy,\nBlending with the world, seeking outwardly while inwardly poor.\n\nWorthy of transmission, passed down in turn,\nThis Dao-gate originally saves and delivers.\nThose who recklessly transmit it bring calamity—\nFather and son grow distant, speech no longer shared.\nTo seek the true lead of the cinnabar field,\nCinnabar, when refined, makes the body firm.\nIf only you receive the oral secret from a perfected one,\nRed lead enters water, and the great elixir is complete.\n\nEach matter must be remembered in heart and word,\nYet creation still requires hand and eye to transmit.\nThe river chariot bears and carries within the cinnabar field,\nFire-taming rests entirely at the edge of yellow sprouts.\nThe Metal Lord can dwell in water,\nBlack lead holds yellow sprouts.\nTransform these yellow sprouts into water,\nUse water to make the river chariot.\nThe marrow of the southern Crimson Emperor—\nThis is the essence of Grand Yin.\nAncient immortals could seize and refine it,\nTaking the form of mercury.\nWhen the two essences unite,\nThis is the heart of the returned elixir.\nIf you encounter this principle,\nNo need for distant seeking.\nFrom black lead, take yang;\nFrom cinnabar, take yin.\n\n*End of the Upper Scroll of the \"Song of the Returned Elixir\"*\n*Beginning of the Lower Scroll of the \"Song of the Returned Elixir\"*\n*Collected by Master Primal Yang*\n\nSong says:\n\nThe true Yin and true Yang are the true Dao,\nThis true Yin-Yang is true water and fire,\nNot the water and fire of the mundane world.\nIt lies right before your eyes—why seek afar?\nPeople daily witness this Dao yet fail to awaken.\n\nYear after year, the common crowd burns divine elixirs,\nSuddenly seeing blue and yellow, they deem it fine.\nYet they know not the correct Way,\nMistakenly using lead and mercury.\n\nThose of resolve must seek the method and model,\nUnderstand the compass and torch, then follow their path.\nDo not harm the spirit-heart with vain visions of old age.\nWithout the true formula, white-haired years bring no gain.\n\nBut if you obtain the true yellow sprouts,\nOne who ingests them attains ageless life.\nShould you gain the true yellow sprouts,\nConsuming them, you naturally achieve the Dao.\n\nThe Green Dragon pursues the Tiger, the Tiger seeks the Dragon—\nThe Dragon is mercury, the Tiger is lead;\nMercury loves to fly and move, yet is restrained by lead and cannot rise.\nThe Crimson Phoenix joins in union, their voices singing in harmony—\nMercury, swallowed by the Vermilion Bird, naturally emits the cry of the infant.\n\nRegulate the qi and timing,\nCirculate the fire without missing the seasonal nodes.\nMove through the Palace of Li—\nLi Palace is the spirit of fire.\nWhen the numinous medicine enters the bowels, the body ascends of itself—\nThe elixir of spirit enters the mouth, becoming the true person.\n\nThe yellow sprouts are not the same as worldly lead,\nThe yellow sprouts are the root of the great medicine,\nBeyond the grasp of the vulgar.\nIn vain they labor their spirits, seeing no merit.\n\nFrom an empty chamber, white-haired age arises alone.\n\nWhere does one wander in search of Red Pine?\nRed Pine—the name of an immortal.\nThe divine water and flowery pond are rare in the world,\nThe divine water and flowery pond, the root of the great medicine,\nNot the common lead and mercury of the mortal realm.\nIts transmission forbids the knowledge of vulgar men.\nAs the *Baopuzi* says: Were this joy known to the dead,\nImmortals would fill the earth.\n\nYet they take the world’s base lead and mercury,\nMaking them seem alike to dispel all doubt.\nThe immortals guard this secret,\nSpeaking only of the world’s lead and mercury.\n\nThe subtleties of the Five Phases are hard to fathom—\nDragon concealed, Tiger hidden, originally Kan and Li.\nThe arts of the Returned Elixir number in the hundreds,\nBut the most essential is the Golden Flower Pond.\nThe Dao of yin and yang is difficult to trace to its source;\nIf one trusts ancient formulas, success will never come.\nThe *Can* says: The Yellow Emperor prized the Golden Flower.\nThus, lead’s outer blackness cradles the Golden Flower within.\n\nCinnabar’s position is not inherently red,\nYet it aligns with the southern palace through the four seasons.\nCinnabar is not red, its place in the south—\nThus, the world’s people cannot grasp its origin.\nVermilion’s nature has no fixed abode,\nBut know its source as autumn stone.\nThe true essence of the sun’s soul and moon’s spirit—\nThese two mysteries of the black elixirs, beyond mortal comprehension.\n\nThey nurture the embryo and rear the child, the body most divine.\nWhen the transformation nears its end, you shall see for yourself—\nClearly, it becomes the dust upon the bright window.\n\nThe *Can* states: It resembles the dust upon the bright window.\nLead and mercury belong to one gate, yet none may rely upon them;\nThe golden elixir’s secret teachings remain unknown even to sages.\nThis secret Dao of sages, none comprehend—\nThe world calls salt \"sage,\" a mark of ignorance.\n\nDo not take common gold and stone of the world,\nTo measure years and fire in vain contention.\nIf one uses worldly lead and mercury,\nRefinement will yield no benefit.\n\nHeaven births these things in response to emptiness and nothingness,\nThese things coalesce from subtle and wondrous radiance,\nNot through artificial craft or forced creation.\nAs wife, as child, and again as husband—\nThis medicine is lord and minister, mother and child,\nHusband and wife, fish and water.\n\nThe gate of the Three and Five lies only in the sun and moon,\nClearly, the positions of *mao* and *you* serve as the beginning.\nIf one knows the Three and Five, lifelong worries cease.\nFor *mao* and *you* are the stations of long life,\nWhere yang’s radiance is born and yin’s essence takes its seat.\nHeaven and Earth cannot evade one another;\nAll matters ultimately return to the realm of Heaven and Earth.\nHeaven and Earth are the great Dao,\nYet people use them daily without awareness.\n\nAfter ten months of gestation, mother and child part,\nBut how could the wise ever abandon them?\nWhen the cycle of transformation ends,\nThe refined numinous medicine stands alone,\nThe child dwelling apart while the mother is cast aside—\nThus, the wise never truly discard them.\n\nNurtured by nature’s endowment of purest truth,\nThe harmonious blackness coalesces into form.\nThe *Can* says: Heaven births the Dark Maiden,\nEarth produces the Yellow Lad.\nWealth and nobility all stem from embracing the five hues,\nHow could lead and mercury ever be kin?\n\nMysterious and obscure, beyond all distinction—\nPeople do not recognize lead and mercury.\nThe gate of lead and mercury’s meaning remains hard to reveal,\nFor people do not grasp the essence of yin and yang.\nIf the world cannot fathom its origin,\nExamine the five phases closely, and you shall see for yourself.\nThe five phases are metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.\nThe infant, restless and elusive, cannot be grasped;\nIn vain, one wearies the spirit, suffering empty toil.\nPeople fail to recognize the wondrous essentials,\nExpending spirit in futility, seeing no effect.\n\nBut if one knows to heed the words of sages,\nClearly, this is the path to Heaven.\nThe Three and Five dwell together in one chamber—\nThe Dragon and Tiger are called the Three and Five.\nOne husband and two wives form a pair.\nOne and two are the numbers of water and fire; five is earth.\nOnly with a good matchmaker may they be joined,\nThus fostering intimate bonds of friendship.\nThe Way of yin and yang requires a good matchmaker,\nThe matchmaker being divine water.\nWith a good matchmaker, husband and wife naturally harmonize.\n\nYin and yang, obscure and unfathomable,\nThe Azure Dragon and White Tiger contend of themselves.\nWhen the Dragon and Tiger enter the chamber, none can comprehend.\nAs the year draws to its end, transformations unfold in mutual devouring;\nThe White Tiger restrains the Dragon, and the Dragon gradually wanes.\nAt year’s end, the cycle completes—\nMercury is gradually congealed into treasure.\n\nHeaven is yang, the old mother is Earth—\nFor one yin and one yang are called the Dao.\nThe Vermilion Bird of the south, the Dark Warrior of the north.\nThe south is the spirit of fire, the north the spirit of water.\nAs the years pass, all become earth—\nWhere then shall people seek the Dragon and Tiger?\nWater and fire together become earth.\n\nThree persons unite in shared purpose as one clan—\nThe three persons are the three legs of the tripod.\nEver revering the sun and moon shining within.\nThe two radiances of sun and moon enter the tripod and die.\nHaving encountered the Three Flowers, now they liquefy again;\nNine revolutions complete the work of years and months.\nNine revolutions mark the exhaustion of yang numbers,\nThe Three Flowers are fire.\n\nThe Azure Dragon’s essence lies in the east—\nThe east is *jia-yi* wood, mercury, the image of the Dragon in *zhen*.\nIt joins with Heaven and Earth, borrowing their positions.\nAfter the White Tiger appears from this,\nThe White Tiger is lead, the Yellow Sprout its form.\nHow could flowing cinnabar refuse to follow?\nFlowing cinnabar is mercury,\nBy nature fond of flying and fleeing—\nBound by lead, it cannot escape.\n\nTo know that cinnabar is the essence of wood,\nMove it to the west to join with metal.\nCinnabar, the essence of wood, unites with leaden gold to complete the great Dao.\nWhere shall ordinary people seek its traces?\nIn the realm of the indistinct and obscure.\nLaozi said: Dim and dark, within it lies essence;\nVague and elusive, within it lies substance.\n\nWhen the Dragon and Tiger are refined through five revolutions,\nGradually, the fragrance of chrysanthemums arises in the furnace—\nThe medicine in the tripod emits a scent like chrysanthemums.\nNow is the proper time for refinement;\nDo not resent the long passage of days and months.\nIn refinement and circulation, one must observe the firing times.\n\nThose who awaken return as if retracing their path,\nWhile the lost find no easy way to seek its traces.\nAwakening is not difficult; the lost struggle in vain.\nThree persons move in harmony, sharing one source—\nThe three persons are the three substances: water, fire, and metal.\nTheir nature has never departed from the ancestral origin.\n\nOne person is, one person is not—\nThe White Tiger of the west is \"is,\" the Azure Dragon of the east is \"not.\"\nMetal is the wife, wood the husband.\nMetal is yin, the wife; wood is yang, the husband.\nProfound and abstruse, beyond all measure—\nThe great Dao is deep and mysterious, beyond all systems.\n\nThe supreme work has never consented to be mapped in diagrams.\nGuard the great Dao in secrecy—it cannot be made clear through illustrations.\nHeaven’s profound mystery matches Earth’s yellow essence,\nHeaven’s mystery and Earth’s yellow.\nThe two essences harmonize and return to the chamber of fusion.\nThe two breaths together enter the crucible.\n\nIn the furnace of white liquid, transformation follows the moon,\nChanging with the waxing and waning of sun and moon.\nThose who partake of it find their hearts clarified, as if frozen in purity.\nThose who consume it can banish all illness.\n\nWho can determine the source when metal and wood wound each other?\nHeaven and Earth move in harmony, naturally interconnected.\nMetal restrains wood, wood generates fire, fire melts metal—\nGeneration and restraint intertwine, yet the world fails to grasp their root.\n\nThe world conceals the great white of yin—\nWho can comprehend the yellow sprout of lead?\nThe yellow sprout is not of this world, so none can fathom it.\nIn the eleventh month, when the water phase of *ren* and *gui* holds sway,\nA single yang stirs, yet it is called the great white of yin.\n\nThe supreme work fundamentally resides in *kan* and *li*,\nSpeaking of true water and true fire—this is the yellow sprout,\nNot the water and fire of the mundane world.\nMundane lead and mercury must not cling to each other—\nIf one employs the lead and mercury of this world, it will kill.\n\nThe wise conceal it where none can see.\nThe wise practice it in seclusion, so few ever witness it.\nThe King of Huai refined the golden flower in his pool,\nThe King of Huai concocted thirty-six waters,\nAble to transform the five metals entirely into treasures.\n\nWhen the nine cycles of lead essence near their end,\nOpening the furnace, one suddenly beholds the red blossom of the elixir.\nThe nine revolutions of the great elixir complete, its hue is like the red lotus.\n\nWater and fire transform together into earth,\nWater and fire contend, naturally becoming ash and soil.\nWhere then can one seek the Golden Elder?\nRefined to the ninth cycle, all perishes into ash and soil—this is not the true color.\n\nThe transmission of lead and mercury is rare in the world.\nIf one encounters the numinous elixir, it must not be recklessly shown to the unworthy—\nThe Most High’s statutes mete out punishment, and seven generations suffer the consequences.\n\nCinnabar’s jade-like substance wears a robe of snow,\nThe cinnabar is white, and the perfected call it \"autumn stone.\"\nDay after day it rests in your dwelling,\nYet day after day you gaze upon it without knowing its source.\n\nWhen the returning elixir enters the mouth, the body becomes light,\nThe great elixir, once ingested, grants one the lightness of feathered transformation.\nIt can dispel long-standing illness and expel malevolent spirits,\nThe great elixir, upon entering the mouth, expels the Three Corpses and Nine Worms,\nHarmonizing the five viscera and six bowels, leaving no room for disease.\n\nFrom this point, greed and attachment fade away,\nIt can transform the foolish into the wise, altering their nature and emotions.\nThe foolish become sages, their names ranked alongside the ancient immortals.\n\nDrifting and floating, indistinct—its nature is hard to discern,\nMistaking it leads the spirit astray, wasting years and months in vain.\nTo know when the numinous medicine will be complete,\nYin and yang must undergo nine full transformations.\n\nWho could have foreseen that the numinous cinnabar would emerge from worldly dust?\nThe three flowers unite, and tiger and dragon become kin.\nBehold those who have refined the elixir before and after—\nHow many thousands, even tens of thousands, have perished in the attempt?\n\nThe *Song of the Returning Elixir*, Scroll the Lower, concludes.",

      "translated_text": "**Verses on the Returned Elixir**\n\n**Title:** *Verses on the Returned Elixir*\nOriginally compiled by Yuanyangzi, likely composed in the late Tang or Five Dynasties period. Two fascicles: the first collects ten verses on the returned elixir from various masters; the second contains *The Song of Golden Liquor* by Yuanyangzi (Yang Canwei). Though the verses align with those in *Yuanyangzi’s Collected Writings on Golden Liquor*, the annotations differ. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* section, *Methods* category.\n\n**Fascicle One of *Verses on the Returned Elixir***\n*Compiled by Yuanyangzi*\n\n**The Song of the Ancient Immortals’ Affairs**\n\nThe world knows not the Dao’s depth or shallowness,\nScorning its subtle signs, faith wavers thin.\nFaith itself lacks firmness from the start,\nErroneous study leaves the Dao ungrasped within.\nBlind transmission, credulous belief—all goes awry,\nWho ponders the gate of life and death’s mystery?\nThe primal mechanism holds sixteen thousand doors,\nRefining the po, refining form, refining the medicine too.\nThose who master heaven and man must perfect all,\nThus the heavens promote them to celestial office true.\nThe narrow-minded, ignorant common folk,\nSeek to become immortals—how hard the task they view!\n\nSome may chance upon a single method’s shield,\nYet of the Dao’s ten thousand arts, not one they know.\nSince ancient times, those who fail to cultivate immortality\nMostly err in practice, their paths askew.\nDo not trust the idle Daoists of the bustling market,\nWho knead butter, spit filth, and swallow saliva’s flow.\nProud of \"River Chariot\" guiding breaths as novices,\nThey grasp not the subtle, bending limbs in vain.\nBoasting of \"chamber arts\" with exotic claims,\nYet never reversing yellow or turning black again.\nStumbling in the current, they surely harm their primal qi,\nDivining by hexagrams, they stray from the law’s domain.\nWhen fire-toxins blaze, deafness must ensue,\nWithout the elixir, vainly forcing qi to rise in vain.\nFew thoughts, few desires—no illness takes root,\nAll arts pale before the four great emptinesses’ truth.\nSuddenly ceasing alchemy, wasting years in idle drift,\nMedicine stilled, qi stilled—no moment’s pause allowed.\nThe root of death’s decay is not as they suppose,\nThe five viscera must be thoroughly refined and drained.\nSpitting a crimson cherry from the mouth,\nThis is not the five phases within the body’s frame.\nFailing to harmonize yin and yang into the supreme medicine,\nLife and death remain bound to the Three Worms’ claim.\nSome feast on rosy clouds, swallowing the two luminaries,\nBlinding their eyes, spinning like echoes in a mirror’s game.\nThose who practice qi-circulation follow countless rules,\nYet invite wind-evil, unaware of their own blame.\nSome wield talismans to command ghosts and spirits,\nWhile the golden elixir eludes them, their bodies frail as dreams.\nWhen the hundred bones scatter, they return to dust,\nA single thing reversed—ghosts and kin lament in vain.\n\nOr they speak of \"exiting the spirit\" through meditative vision,\nYet the wondrous true emptiness remains unseen.\nFalsely claiming to borrow a dwelling or enter a womb,\nThey cycle through the four births, bound to rebirth’s wheel.\nSome binge on food and wine, their faces ruddy, strength immense,\nVoices like thunder, boasting of true immortal arts.\nYet this is but the vigor of innate yang’s abundance,\nNot the fruit of alchemy’s transformative part.\nSome sleep drunk through wind and rain,\nTheir warmth but the wine’s fire, their cold the winter’s bane.\nSober, they shiver in thin robes,\nNo different from ordinary folk in their suffering’s pain.\n\nSpeaking of inner elixirs—mere illusions, empty forms,\nDeluded minds chase phantoms, lost in vain.\nThinking of a virgin girl will not conceive a child,\nA hen’s egg holds no life within.\nSome claim to be long-lived men of distant ages,\nHaving received the sword’s secret from Dongbin’s hand.\nThey deceive the foolish and ignorant,\nPassing days in wine and chess, their bonds unplanned.\nSome boast of \"yellow and white\" arts to cheat and steal,\nA thousand herbs and stones spawn illusions grand.\nThe immortals’ medicine lies within the five phases,\nWho can fathom its workings, its blessings command?\nSuch charlatans abound,\nStaving off hunger and cold, avoiding life’s hard span.\nUnknowing of the Dao’s true root and stem,\nThey age and die like hemp—what recourse remains?\n\nEven ancient immortals repaid past debts,\nDisguised in humble guise, they begged in secret ways.\nAmidst mud, tiles, and rubble they dwelt,\nYet within, their jade and treasures lay.\nThose who feign the Dao in Yan’s land follow this path,\nMute, their silence startles none.\nUnlettered, their conduct unrefined,\nTheir poverty and suffering mark them as the fallen one.\n\nTo cultivate immortality, first perfect merit and conduct,\nWhen deeds are full, heaven and man refine life’s thread.\nEmpty words of longing for the Dao, without cultivating the heart,\nAt death, the unrectified heart is to blame instead.\nSome, with scant knowledge, hastily erect a hut,\nSeeking fame and praise, emulating the southern flight’s aim.\nFailing, they turn back—only to die,\nLeaving behind slander for later men to proclaim.\n\nOthers, with shallow grasp of Chan’s words,\nCling to the ten thousand images in their minds.\nOne day, their walking corpses suddenly perish,\nThe crowd calls it \"transformation\" or \"corpse-liberation\" in kind.\nThe great Dao’s true principle is not so,\nAscending with one’s dwelling—this is the ancient, enduring lore.\nMisled by deviant arts, they die in vain,\nYet still they speak of immortals whose forms transcend the mortal shore.\n\nConsider the deceptive, heterodox, and illusory arts,\nWalking on water, flying through space—yet all is known.\nHow can such \"immortals\" transform their bodies’ gate,\nIf they cannot reverse aging, preserving form and bone?\nTo cross the living, save the dead—only the elixir suffices,\nTransmuting the five phases, qi and form made whole again.\nThe golden elixir grants heaven and man’s longevity,\nAll other arts but briefly extend the span of years’ chain.\n\nThe immortal formulas are clearly transmitted in the world,\nThe Three Caverns, Four Supplements—how can they be counted?\nHigh immortals since ancient times arose from kings and lords,\nThe biased views of common fools—how can they be anointed?\nOf old, the Heavenly Master met the Old Lord,\nReceiving a thousand scrolls, celestial texts descended.\nGe Hong’s ten thousand volumes were deemed few,\nSun Simiao’s reclusion—all were widely learned.\n\nThe ancients’ enlightenment came through texts and meaning,\nYet today’s men cling to poor teachers’ creeds.\nThe wise, through texts, find their masters,\nThe dull seek in vain—how hard the path proceeds!\nScholars past and present pore over the *Cantong Qi*,\nIts purport lies within, yet differences abound.\nFailing to grasp the source, the true intent,\nEven in old age, its meaning remains shrouded, unsound.\n\nCall it \"inner\"—speaking of tripods and furnaces, they seem to know,\nCall it \"outer\"—generating form from formlessness, they fail to see.\nThe *Cantong Qi*’s meaning is fundamentally clear,\nWithout a master’s transmission, it remains obscure eternally.\nHeaven bestows subtle guidance for a reason,\nMeeting a master, receiving the formula—true lead is seen.\nTrue lead is the metal within water,\nBorn from the indistinct, before heaven and earth’s sheen.\n\nThe northern sun, the southern moon,\nYellow silver, white gold—each in its eightfold measure.\nDragon and tiger wage war, metal and wood intertwine,\nFirst liquid, then congealed—the ointment’s body smooth and pure.\nEighty-one hues of true Kan and Li,\nThe medicine arises, the three and five unite in one’s cure.",

kindness.\nThe host remains, the guests depart,\nTheir hearts still lingering, suspended in longing.\nFor eight or nine days the door stayed shut,\nOnly today was it first flung open.\nAt this moment, rites are complete.\nThe music has passed its time, kinfolk disperse,\nThe bride returns to her chamber—\nOnly the man and woman remain,\nClinging to each other in tender reluctance.\nLike sun and moon,\nThey follow each other through kalpas unending.\nThis is the one method,\nThe root and foundation of the Dao.\nNot even sages and worthies can fathom it,\nNor gods and spirits comprehend.\nOnly my master and I have grasped it—\nGuard it closely, practice it in secret.\nKeep it hidden without fail,\nAnd you will never stray from the Dao.\nLet no triple leak occur,\nNor the five know of it.\nIf you hold to this and the Dao,\nKeep it secret, secret—\nSuch wonders are beyond thought.\n\nMaster Xiaoyao says:\nOnce hidden in mystery, now fierce as a tiger,\nPity the Five Agents—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth.\nYet within them dwells a white-haired elder,\nPointing the way to the azure sky all day long.\nIf a scholar of the Dao should meet him,\nExert every effort to cherish and grasp this truth.\n\nHe also says:\nThe Dao may be transmitted,\nBut if kept secret, Heaven’s Way flourishes.\nThose who seek long life,\nHonor and obey father and mother.\n\n**Ode on the Nine Cycles of the Yellow Lady of Mount Emei**\nThe old hermit, favored by grace,\nRefines the elixir within the forbidden chamber.\nIn the crucible, all medicines transform,\nAbove the furnace, mercury takes flight.\nLike autumn frost in hue, the jade unites,\nIts radiance holding the moon’s nightly glow.\nAll arises from the Enlightened Lord’s inspiration,\nEnabling the Dao’s subtleties to unfold.\n\nFirst, draw forth the mercury,\nThen burn it back into cinnabar.\nThe method of the immortals is most secret,\nThe essence of alchemy in the inner court.\nPurple-black bears the true color,\nCrimson light mingles with dawn’s rosy clouds.\nTo merge into one body,\nOne must fiercely refine the Three Flowers.\nCycle upon cycle, delving into the profound,\nLayer upon layer, entering the boundless void.\nThe cinnabar’s body now shifts,\nReturning to mercury’s form.\nBlack as autumn frost, still,\nCrimson light like stars at dusk.\nNaturally it becomes the marvelous maiden—\nWhat fear is there of failing to attain the numinous?\n\nThough white tin first melts,\nThe yellow sprout has already congealed.\nLike snow descending from heaven,\nOr ice forming on a pool’s surface.\nGrind the dry earth and stir-fry,\nSift the ash and steam with moisture.\nStill, watch for the black hue,\nThen wait for the brine to settle.\nRegulate the fire with civil and martial balance,\nSeal the furnace with yin and yang.\nIn the crucible, observe the black pass,\nIn the pot, discern true emptiness.\nReinforce with repeated nurturing,\nGuard against the six medicines’ corruption.\nOnce hardened like joined jade,\nWhere can one find a straying pearl?\n\nNiter poured into boiling water,\nBorax steeped in simmering brew.\nSalt’s excess merely transforms,\nAlum’s fine grains need no grinding.\nOld white hardens at first,\nNew yellow’s hue not yet firm.\nBefore placing it in the fire,\nFear the mercury’s fumes.\nCease the fire, open the elixir’s cauldron,\nRefine the gold, remove the medicinal mud.\nAuspicious light joins sun and moon,\nTrue qi mingles with rainbow’s sheen.\nIts form excels the golden tripod,\nIts essence gathers toward the horse’s hoof.\nOnly after nine cycles are complete,\nBehold the single *dao* knife’s measure.\n\nGround to powder, refined anew,\nTest its worth before the furnace.\nLike dust, half-purple startles the eye,\nLike silk, all-yellow evokes wonder.\nAuspicious as three stalks of grain,\nNuminous with five-colored light.\nWait until the gold’s poison is fully drawn,\nThen present it beside the jade steps.\n\nWhen the jade pitchpipe heralds spring’s return,\nThe golden elixir responds to the Emperor’s devotion.\nMay the Southern Mountains share the Sage’s longevity,\nThe Eastern Sea match the age’s purity.\nBlessings flow from the Mysterious Origin’s virtue,\nMerit arises from the Supreme Dao’s manifestation.\nThough this humble servant possesses the art,\nThe immortal transcends the thatched hut’s bounds.\n\n**Song of the Lesser Return Elixir of White Metal**\nThe Emperor asked the Perfected One:\n\"The Dao is fundamentally without duality,\nAll converging in the One.\nMedicines have many functions,\nYet how can the body be aided and blessed?\nI beg your compassion,\nHasten to save my life.\"\n\nThe Perfected One replied:\n\"Body in harmony with the black,\nMedicine sharing the primordial essence—\nThe two Dao align with the mechanism,\nAnd decrepitude naturally recedes.\nDo not seek the great elixir,\nFor sun and moon’s timing is hard to await.\nA single taste of white metal\nProlongs life and augments years.\nThe immortals guard this secret,\nNever transmitting it lightly.\nIf you can keep it hidden,\nDo not lightly disclose it.\"\n\nIn all twelve verses,\nThe transformations of medicines and methods\nAre none other than water’s essence.\nThe Six Fungi lend their hues,\nThe yellow sprout grows naturally.\nYang’s light does not rise,\nYin’s flow makes no sound.\nThe Dao’s method is secret yet simple,\nYet scholars find it hard to achieve.\n\nFirst nurture the yellow youth,\nBegin by restraining the household ghosts.\nExhaust death to support metal,\nLet remaining life restrain water.\nIf one can grasp this principle,\nAll will penetrate its truth.\nReceive the Sage’s words in person,\nFor the matter is hard to fathom alone.\n\nHollow the base to avoid scorching,\nKnow the white, guard the black,\nRefine the yellow into one branch.\nAvoid yin’s filth,\nAnd within a hundred days,\nThe great Dao of longevity—\nEasy to understand, hard to know.\n\nThe Yellow Lad, pure and refined,\nWeds the Mysterious Consort.\nGold’s power grows strong,\nThe medicine matures, the body flourishes.\nThe earthen dwelling holds three parts,\nThe fire chamber embodies the Two Modes.\nSupreme virtue dissolves yin,\nPure yang abides in subtlety.\nA single taste of white metal\nFortifies human decrepitude.\nMixed natures are hard to guard,\nBut shared resolve is easy to maintain.\nConsume a thousand grains,\nAnd for a hundred days, no harm will come.\nTen thousand illnesses gradually fade,\nHeaven’s years, Earth’s longevity.\n\nFollow the oral instructions,\nCherish the transmission in person.\nAfter seven days, it naturally subdues,\nTen thousand moments, firmly secured.\nRefined a thousand times, boiled ten thousand,\nEntrusted to the Five Worthies.\nStore it well in a golden vessel,\nNever sever the Mysterious Pass.\nDaub the four walls with ochre,\nGuard the cinnabar at the round door.\nOne resides in the fire’s coffer,\nTwo in the ash pit.\nFive toads can be preserved,\nThree crows, no doubt.\nThe Dao’s essence unfolds slowly,\nEach day growing more wondrous.\n\nOne yellow, two white,\nThree *zhu*, two made.\nNurture until the toad is full,\nRaise the lofty crane.\nAvoid other distractions,\nThe Dao and body will naturally rejoice.\nTransmit to the unworthy,\nAnd heaven’s calamity, earth’s cruelty will follow.\n\nThe sprout belongs to the Yellow Lad,\nThe medicine resides in the Mysterious Maiden.\nExternal aids are none other than\nJade fungi and pure vinegar.\nVulgar scholars hear much,\nDao Lords speak little.\nDiscrepancies in materials\nBring vain suffering.\nCopper and iron mar the form,\nCinnabar ash saps strength.\nTo verify its numinous power,\nOne must preserve its original nature.\n\nOne yin, one yang—\nThe matter is easy, the timing is the key.",

rain.\nSnowflakes fly.\nSnowflakes fly, the soul returns, the spirit already home,\nGathering and scattering both ruled by the waters of *ren* and *gui*.\nBeneath the Jade Canopy’s radiant bloom, the body abides in non-action.\n\nBubbling Spring’s waters,\nBubbling Spring’s waters—\nThrough spring, summer, autumn, winter, depth without end.\nWhen the time comes to traverse the world,\nThick warmth naturally governs.\n\n*Tai Bai Han Yun Zhong Huo Ji Ge*\nThe Great Dao is vast and boundless,\nYin and yang beyond fathoming.\nCreation’s unfolding, generation’s arising—\nThe world’s people cannot perceive.\nFoolishly discoursing on emptiness, they age with white hair;\nErroneously crafting, they squander their wealth.\nSeeking to prolong life and halt the years,\nThey instead wound and shorten their span.\nFrom ancient times to now, those who have loved this path\nHave brought ruin to countless lives.\nGrasping at misguided methods, ignorant of the true aim,\nWhen facing the furnace’s fire, they merely refine cinnabar to draw mercury,\nMatching yin to yellow stone,\nOr adding lead to mercury,\nOr flying mercury into streams,\nOr refining earth to claim gold,\nOr mistaking crow’s milk for honey.\nMelting lead into mercury, they call it \"Yellow Sprout\";\nMercury entering *geng* and *xin*, they name it \"Dragon and Tiger.\"\nMercury as the Great Dao—all is false.\nIf the heart is moved by profit, how can it be embraced?\nTo forge the elixir is a grave error.\n\nI, having long loved the Dao, failed to awaken to the true origin.\nSuch methods of subjugation—\nAll were personally tested.\nWitnessing the world’s people perish from plague,\nI felt deep sorrow and grief.\nObserving life and death’s fleeting passage,\nWhere could one seek the Dao?\nThus, I set forth these essential mysteries,\nTo reveal them to fellow learners.\nI meticulously detail yin and yang,\nHoping all may awaken to the Dao.\n\nNow, lead is the male within *kan*,\nRightly belonging to *ren* and *gui*.\nRefining yin to dissolve and smelt,\nNine cycles of floating and sinking—\nWhen the count is complete, it becomes *qian*,\nThus paired with the western position.\nThe world’s people see it often,\nYet do not comprehend its true origin.\n\nThe Tiger, too, manifests its form,\nFierce, sharp, and black.\nAscending to heaven, it becomes clouds and rain;\nDescending to earth, it becomes springs and sources.\nIts jade essence returns nine times,\nThe Metal Elder extinguishes fire—\nAll through the White Snow.\n\nMercury is the female within *li*,\nRightly belonging to *bing* and *ding*.\nAll things flourish and thrive,\nReceiving its darkness.\nAbove, it responds to the Azure Yang with constancy;\nBelow, it hides in the White Storehouse, sinking in concealment.\nThe Dragon soars to heaven, revealing the essence of wood;\nSpring’s arrival brings forth flowers and herbs.\nVague and indistinct, yet right before the eyes—\nSeven returns to revive the soul,\nMysterious blossoms and azure waters.\nIf one awakens to this,\nAll profound secrets become clear.\nThose who close their eyes\nWill find it hard to glimpse.\n\nThus, the Tiger of the moon’s dark phase,\nRefining the Dragon of the sun’s radiant essence,\nSubduing the shadows of the twin blacks,\nThey mutually attract and unite as husband and wife.\n*Kan* resides in the Three Flowers,\nBecoming the ultimate principle.\nTherefore, I reveal these essential mysteries\nTo those who would understand.\n\nI also chant the *Thirteen Celestial Talismans*—\nLet later learners study them closely,\nAnd they will surely grasp the true origin.\nIf you obtain this text,\nDo not recklessly disclose it.\n\nThe returning yang begins to stir,\nFollowing the cycle, the seasons shift.\nThe Dragon lurks, unable to soar,\nThe Tiger crouches, its cries rare.\nThe two blacks meet at last!\nThe Three Flowers foretell the dawn.\nFire fills the ninefold count,\nThen wanes and returns again.\n\nOn the eighteenth day before the furnace,\nHeaven and earth’s qi intermingle.\nThe Metal Youth comes to restrain wood,\nEarth stabilizes the water’s embryonic sac.\nResonance and response mutually consume and gaze,\nHarmony and unity lie in attunement.\nAdvance with the measured dripping,\nRetreat according to the hexagram’s lines.\n\nWhen the Dao prospers, await the proper moment,\nYang’s harmony begins to arise.\nThe pitch shifts in the first month,\nThe Dipper’s handle guards *yin*’s course.\nThe nobleman’s heart remains vigilant,\nYin and yang follow the seasonal sprouts.\nAfter thirty days, step forth,\nPray and refine, then return to the fire.\n\nThe Elm’s death, the *Kui* star nears *mao*—\nThe third absence marks the right time.\nThe sun’s essence and moon’s spirit,\nThese two essences unite to form the Great Dao.\nDragon and Tiger naturally contend.\nGreat Strength completes the compass and square,\nBlossoms open toward the cassia branches.\nCease the furnace, halt the fire’s timing,\nThe azure hue transforms into radiant light.\n\nAll trees contain yang,\nBlossoms open, fragrance fills the path.\nThe Golden Rooster rides the great fire,\nThe Vermilion Fire’s essence.\nThe Jade Hare wanes and is harmed,\nThe Water’s essence.\nThe wise grieve over life and death,\nHigh and low vanish in an instant.\nWhen the medicine is complete, pay homage to the Great Emperor,\nIngesting it dispels calamities.\n\nThrough bitter discipline, *qian* is refined,\nCultivating the elixir requires steadfast resolve.\nIf the Tiger wounds the Dragon, blood flows,\nIf metal slays wood, no smoke rises.\nWhen yang flourishes, yin approaches,\nProsperity gives way to decline naturally.\nStrike the sound, let it ring like a chime,\nObserve and gain extended years.\n\nAt *Chu Liu*, reaching the southern palace,\nYin ascends, pregnancy begins.\nThe pitch pipes shift frequently,\nHolding the nodes, they alternately attack.\nAfter five days, the count wanes,\nThe Three Flowers’ fate is supplied.\nBring it to the door to see—\nBloodstains, thousands deep.\n\n*Xiao Ji* wields the celestial talisman,\nYin comes, retreating in accumulated trust.\nThe Metal Elder replenishes marrow and sinew,\nThe Vermilion Bird grasps the pivotal mechanism.\nThe Dao’s body mirrors heaven and earth,\nThe harmonious medicine resides in the furnace.\nDo not treat it as mere transformation—\nIngesting it, even the dead revive.\n\nWhen *Pi* closes, the three yins descend,\nThe general slays the many blacks.\nThe Herdboy meets the Weaving Maiden at the Celestial River.\n*Jia* and *yi* injure wood,\n*Geng* and *xin* begin to sharpen the sword.\nCommands circulate through the seasonal nodes,\nCold and heat all pass through.\nWhen the moon aligns with heaven’s hardness,\nWind stirs the shepherd’s purse and wheat sprouts.\nThe Earth Lord personally conducts the sacrifice,\nThe saliva altar nurtures golden sand.\n\nThe cassia’s shadow rounds the Milky Way,\nThe sun’s harmony rhymes with purple clouds.\nThe swan arrives, the dark crow departs—\nSoon, one will see plants growing in water.\nCold yin harms the season’s beings,\nYin’s arrival withers all trees.\nSeek chrysanthemums at *wu* and *ji*,\nCrimson blood severs the Dragon’s waist.\nDecaying into earth,\nWhen lead is separated, it vanishes.\nWith a steadfast heart, cultivate the ultimate Dao,\nDo not resent the distant path.\n\nAt *Shang Liu*, dwelling in *kun*’s position,\nYin and yang encompass the beginning and end.\nThe Emperor’s son’s work becomes marrow,\nThe *Li* maiden’s blood is deep red.\nWhen two and eight unite,\nThe three differ in principle.\nOpen the furnace to behold the supreme treasure—\nIngesting it, the withered elder transforms.\n\nRevisiting the land of pure origin,\nYang hides, creating the six colds.\nAfter thirty days of refinement,\nThe nine-six elixir is complete.\nInscribe the name on the golden tablet,\nErect the altar in the immortal’s palace.",

Left-flavored herbs blend with yellow to form a vessel, nurtured for one seven-day cycle.\n\n*Song of Perfected Yang Xing:*\nAll in the world love elixirs,\nYet none truly find them.\nSome say use lead, some say not—\nEven when lead is used, it is still wrong.\nIf you cannot find it, do not grow angry;\nIt is because the true Yellow Sprout eludes you.\nOnly those with faith and conduct are worthy of transmission—\nThose unstained by wealth or lust are true adepts.\n\nWork in secret to aid others, never flaunt your skill,\nFor seeking immortality may instead shorten your years.\nBeware of wandering among the halls of the noble;\nLeave divination and healing to idle hands.\nIf you cannot yet retreat, with no place of leisure,\nThen seek remedies for illness—\nWhy fret over the joy of the Dao and long life?\n\nLead is the sovereign, mercury the minister,\nFire the messenger.\nThe Crimson Blood General guards yin and yang,\nCommanding and subduing the medicine.\nWhen the elixir is complete, first use it to refine mercury—\nOnce mercury is transmuted, it may be ingested.\nNo ghostly officials will pursue you, nor will you die.\nIf you attain this, seek it in quietude, not among the powerful.\n\nThe secret lies in the heart, transmitted through hand and eye.\nIf heart and mouth do not align, if hand and eye are not passed down,\nIndulging in wine and lust severs all ties to the Dao.\nWhen water in the Cinnabar Field congeals, the Yellow Sprout arises;\nAfter a hundred days of nurturing, it submits to fire.\nYin dwelling in the yang crucible is the Golden Elixir—\nAfter ten months of refinement, it is ready for ingestion.\nIngesting it preserves your complexion,\nYour hair and temples never wither, your resolve never falters.\nSelling elixirs and medicines among men,\nA thousand years of life go unrecognized.\n\nThe elixir of long life, the pill of immortality—\nThe world desires them, yet they are hard to find.\nHesitant in heart, wavering in intent,\nThe eight methods of elixir-making have long existed—\nWhy not master even one?\n\nTwo converse, plotting together,\nDay and night seeking the formula of immortality.\nIf you obtain black lead and the Old Woman,\nYou will soar into the heavens on your own wings.\nOne is left, one is right—\nWhen yin and yang are complete, the Returned Elixir is achieved.\nTruly refine it, and you will surely live long,\nRoaming freely in the purple courtyards of the immortals.\n\nThe world’s bustling crowds, with their carriages and horses,\nTheir rosy cheeks and black hair do not endure.\nAlchemical arts have been passed down for ten thousand years,\nYet seekers rush about, never finding the truth.\nIf everyone recognized the Yellow Sprout,\nHow could there be poverty in the world?\n\nOld men and women craft the great medicine—\nLead and mercury, the two metals, are not misused.\nEmerging from water, entering fire, they lose vitality,\nHalf-alive, half-dead, bound in mutual accord.\nThrough this accord, a sixty-year cycle is completed—\nAbove yin, below yang, they submit to one another.\nIf you attain this in the world’s clamor,\nNo ghostly officials will claim you, sparing you from death.\n\nLead is lead, mercury is mercury—\nYet all in the world think they can use them.\nThe Yellow Sprout of herbs, the Yellow Sprout of wood—\nAll in the world boast of them idly.\nSince ancient times, secrets were passed mouth to ear, never written—\nThose who burn offerings labor in vain, ruining their families.\n\nThe White Emperor of the West dwells in Wu Du,\nAdorned with a parrot-feathered crown, as all require.\nThe Flowery Pond is sealed for seven days—\nThe maid, through a matchmaker, finds her husband.\nWatch the furnace closely, tending to the four seasons’ darkness;\nCold and warmth, heat and chill—do not let your heart sleep.\nHonor the immortals with perfect ritual—\nA single drop of yellow gold fills the earth.\n\nLead and mercury, the two yin,\nAre the heart of the Returned Elixir.\nTheir mutual restraint is not difficult,\nYet people remain lost, never seeking.\nScholars see nothing, wasting a thousand gold pieces.\nIf you receive guidance, you create blessings and relieve poverty.\nSuch is its use—\nNeither heaven nor immortals will resent you.\nIf you recklessly reveal the Dao,\nHeaven’s wrath will be great.\nPlagues will strike, and you will face official punishment.\n\nBlack kinds do not dwell together—\nMother and child are bound in mutual accord.\nWithout lead and the Yellow Sprout,\nSubjugation is impossible.\nThe Yellow Sprout submits within yin,\nWhite Snow arises within yang.\nPlaced into the fire to burn,\nYin and yang are bound together.\nMother and child cannot escape,\nNever parting in life or death.\n\nCinnabar, oh cinnabar,\nIt saves lives and families.\nIf it can save my life,\nIt can save my family.\nIt can give birth to a wondrous maiden,\nTo wed the Yellow Sprout.\nShe serves her husband with purity,\nNeither joyful nor angry.\nShe observes rites and music, morning and evening,\nWith measured discipline.\n\nGold may be made, the world may be transcended—\nBut if gold is not achieved, you wait in vain.\nMercury’s essence lies first in the Cinnabar Field,\nThen in the yang crucible, where darkness connects.\nHarmonized for three days, it finally settles—\nKnow then that the great medicine resides in lead.\nFirst entering the yin furnace, it becomes Great White;\nLater dwelling in the yang crucible, it transforms into the Golden Elixir.\nIf people grasp this principle,\nRefining mercury will not be difficult.\n\nCinnabar and mercury enter the lead pool,\nYielding the Yellow Sprout, unknown to others.\nThis is the oral secret left by immortals—\nEven if you encounter it, you still need a teacher.\nThe teacher must clearly transmit the oral secret—\nFew in the world’s clamor speak of it.\nIn seventy years, it is passed to one—\nOnly those with immortal bones receive it clearly.\n\nThose in the world who seek the Dao\nAre foolish with wine and meat,\nWasting a hundred years in ignorance.\nThe Metal Lord is subdued—\nA single branch of the Returned Elixir.\nCinnabar subdues fire,\nCuring illness without doubt.\nLong life is within reach,\nUnshakably firm.\nNot aging, not dying—\nLike Peng Zu of old.\n\nAncient immortals obtained the essence of red copper,\nOne tael of mercury, one tael of essence.\nHalf a tael of roasted cinnabar, boiled in rice water from dawn to dusk—\nThe body becomes strong.\nCast into copper or iron, its power is like a mirror—\nGhosts and spirits fear it, unable to speak.\nIf you receive the oral secret from a perfected one,\nYou must cherish it to attain long life.\n\nWhen yang essence is firm, the hun-spirit stands;\nWhen yin essence is firm, the po-soul is complete.\nWhen hun and po are strong, the heart becomes sagely—\nRed lead and cinnabar mercury grow even more potent.\nIf you encounter an immortal who leaves this art,\nYour hun and po will stand, and you will live long.\n\nThose who know the Maiden will surely return essence;\nThose who subdue the Vermilion Child will surely remain steadfast.\nThe essence of metal, the marrow of stone—\nThese are the numinous spirits of the hun.\nThose who cultivate become sages;\nThose who subdue become potent.\nNo ghostly officials will pursue them,\nAnd their names will be recorded in the immortal registers.",
