  "full_translation": "**The Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning’s Sutra of Manifest Responses of Lord Zitong**\n\n**Sutra Title:** *The Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning’s Sutra of Manifest Responses of Lord Zitong*. Author unknown, approximately dating to the Yuan dynasty. Falsely attributed to the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning, who expounds to Lord Zitong the karmic causes of sentient beings’ transgressions, exhorting them to abandon evil and embrace goodness. One fascicle.\n\n**Source:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Benwen* Category.\n\n---\n\n**The Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning’s Sutra of Manifest Responses of Lord Zitong**\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning resided within the Jade Capital Mountain of the Palace of Radiant Clarity in the Heaven of Luminous Darkness. He wove a canopy of five-colored clouds, leading the assembly of celestial immortals. The sun, moon, and stars shone with dazzling brilliance, while mountains, rivers, ghosts, and spirits joined hands in praise, saying: \"We, who dwell in the turbid world of dust and defilement, rarely encounter the compassion of Heaven. May it broadly awaken us.\"\n\nThen, Lord Zitong advanced with dignified steps, prostrated twice before the Heavenly Worthy, knelt, and spoke: \"Your disciple, through kalpas uncounted, has lost his original body and been exiled to the land of Shu. I reflect upon the myriad trials of the mortal realm—some born among birds and beasts, others dwelling among barbarians. Distinctions of wealth and poverty abound; they suffer disasters of flood, fire, and warfare, endure the torments of cyclic rebirth, and remain unaware of Heaven and Earth, sun, moon, and stars. They slander the teachings, disrespect the Three Treasures, teachers, and parents. Though they may enjoy fleeting happiness, they inevitably fall into the Five Destinies and Three Wretched Realms, revolving through kalpas without awakening. Witnessing these people suffer manifold retributions, I now encounter the Heavenly Worthy’s descent. I pray you proclaim the Dharma to dispel their ignorance.\"\n\nAt that moment, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning emanated a radiant light from his brow, illuminating ten thousand miles. The assembly of celestial immortals, along with the deities of the heavens above, the earth below, the waterways, and the hells, each took their places within the lapis lazuli and five-colored realms to hear the Dharma proclaimed.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning said: \"Excellent! O Imperial Son, you compassionately contemplate sentient beings and expound these karmic causes, seeking to awaken their hearts. The alternation of yin and yang, the movement of sun and moon, the flow and concealment of stars, the collapse of lands—all belong to the transformations of Heaven.\n\n\"Common folk, born between Heaven and Earth, receive the qi of yin and yang, are perfected by the Five Phases, and formed by the union of the Two Qi. Yet they know not the rarity of the human body, the preciousness of birth in the Central Land. Envy, greed, and avarice fill them, and they remain ignorant of repentance. Thus, they suffer the calamities of warfare, pestilence, flood, and fire—all arising from this.\n\n\"I, your servant, bow my head and implore the Heavenly Worthy: The people endure disasters and misfortunes, yet none pity or heed them. How may they be absolved?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy, leaning upon his armrest, replied: \"You, who assist in the governance of the Vast Heaven, share the august rank of the Great Unity, your name exalted in the Southern Culmen, your virtue extending to the Four Quarters. You oversee the revolutions of the Primordial Unity and administer the official ranks and emoluments of the flowing stream. The Six Registers are all examined, the Five Peaks all informed. Contemplating these mortal beings, you should deliver them.\"\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy proclaimed a hymn of praise:\n\nThus the Primordial Worthy,\nEnthroned within lapis lazuli,\nPities the evils of sentient beings,\nWho flow from the Three Wretched Realms to the Five Destinies.\nVast and unknowing, they remain,\nEver as the sun and moon wane.\nUnmindful of the Five Phases they receive,\nThe stars govern their transitions.\n\nAt that time, Lord Zitong,\nFrom his seat, proclaimed compassion.\nManifesting transformations through his person,\nRevealing samādhi within his brush.\nDispelling misfortune and opening the gate,\nHe conversed at the Jade Capital’s armrest.\nGazing below at the people of the world,\nEnduring suffering without end.\nUnawakened and unknowing,\nNow I urge you to repent.\nListen, sentient beings, to this guidance,\nThe Five Peaks hold no obstructions.\nThe Wheel-Turning Lord delivers from suffering,\nHell holds no escape.\nFortune and misfortune both transmitted,\nGood and ill foretold in advance.\nCherish life and uphold the Great Dao,\nCompassion removes harm.\nForever open the gate of immortal teachings,\nAbiding by the teachings is supreme.\"\n\nHe further intoned:\n\n\"The register of official ranks is your charge,\nLiterary arts are your perfection.\nShould one seek the path to office,\nThey rely on you as the balance.\nGood and evil determine fortune and misfortune,\nUnderstanding lies in karmic causes.\nWield the brush to record truthfully,\nProsperity and decline are no accident.\nWith merit comes reward,\nWithout goodness, no partiality.\nThe heavens praise this as good—\nHow else may one ascend?\"\n\nWhen the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning had finished speaking this sutra, he addressed Lord Zitong: \"You reside in the heart of Western Shu, atop Phoenix Mountain, manifesting numinous signs in the mortal realm, all taking form. You observe the conduct and concealment of the ninety-four transformations, reveal the changes of billions of kalpas, hold the office of delivering from suffering, and govern fortune and misfortune in the Four Quarters. Hear my few words to augment even the smallest goodness, and with reverence respond to compassion.\"\n\nLord Zitong then knelt in gratitude, bowed again before the Heavenly Worthy, and said: \"Your servant now encounters this compassion and vows to deliver the people. Not a single affair shall escape my brush, not a single person shall remain unsaved by my manifestations. Together, we uphold the Great Dao to inspire cherishing of life, and I pray the Heavenly Countenance will open the path of expedient means.\"\n\nThereupon, the assembly of celestial immortals each voiced their praise.\n\nThey again addressed the Heavenly Worthy, entreating that the sutra be entrusted to the world for recitation, to dispel disasters and misfortunes.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Excellent! Excellent! Those who recite it shall have a hundred blessings arrive, their descendants prosper, and their lives flourish. Those who slander it shall bring calamity upon nine generations and extend misfortune to themselves.\"\n\nThen the assembly of celestial immortals proclaimed a hymn:\n\nSilent and profound, the human path,\nDim and distant, the foolish.\nToday, beholding the Heavenly Worthy’s teachings,\nThe foolish are freed from anger and delusion.\n\nWhen this hymn was finished, the assembly of celestial immortals and Lord Zitong bowed again before the Heavenly Worthy, paid their respects, and withdrew, faithfully receiving and upholding the teachings.\n\n**Thus concludes *The Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning’s Sutra of Manifest Responses of Lord Zitong*.**\n\n**The Sacred Title of the Imperial Lord**\n\nThe Inner Auxiliary of the Primordial Beginning, Grand Supervisor of the Three Clarities’ Inner Administration, Commander-in-Chief of the Three Realms’ Yin Soldiers, Executor of Expedient Affairs, Overseer of the Prisons of Heaven, Earth, and Water, Collector of the True Forms, Tiger Tallies, and Dragon Charters of the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, Director of All Celestial Stellar Luminaries, Arbiter of the Registers of Osmanthus and Emolument, Supreme Immortal, Illustrious and Radiant Primordial Sovereign Perfected, True Lord of the Bureau of Emolument and Tribute Examinations, Pre-Enrolled in the Flying Immortals’ Roster, Controller of the Revolutions of Primordial Heaven’s Transformations, Savior of Suffering, Unobstructed Treasure Radiance, Pure Unity Heavenly Worthy, Nine Heavens’ Determiner of Destiny, Protector of Life, Upholder of the Dao, Opener of Civilization, Supreme Ruler, Eternally Joyous, Everlasting Blessing, Numinous Response Great Emperor.",
