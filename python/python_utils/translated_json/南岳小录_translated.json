  "full_translation": "**Southern Marchmount Minor Record**\n\n**Title:** *Southern Marchmount Minor Record*\nBy Li Kunzhao of the Tang dynasty. Two texts in one fascicle.\nSource edition: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Cavern Mystery Division*, *Genealogical and Registral Category*.\n\n**Southern Marchmount Minor Record with Preface**\nRecorded by the Daoist Li Chongzhao\n\nIn my youth, I awakened to the Dao. In recent years, I have followed my master to the gates of the Marchmount, repeatedly seeking its numinous traces. I sought ancient records of wondrous and extraordinary events, but none could be found. It is said that after the ravages of war and fire, texts were scattered and lost. Thus, I examined ancient steles, the *Illustrated Classic of Mount Heng*, and local gazetteers, and consulted with venerable masters, elders at the foot of the mountain, and senior Daoists. Whatever I obtained, I promptly stored in baskets. Now, based on what I have gathered—from the Five Peaks and Three Gorges, the ancient temples and medicinal halls, to the lineages of those who attained the Dao and ascended in broad daylight, and the origins of its numinous marvels—I have abridged and recorded them directly, compiling this single fascicle under the title *Southern Marchmount Minor Record*. May those who chant the Dao and wander the mountains, upon perusing this, roughly understand the origins of its numinous traces.\n\nPreface composed in the winter of the *renxu* year, tenth month.\n\n**Account of the Marchmount**\n\nThe Southern Marchmount, as recorded in the *Rites of Zhou*: \"The mountain that guards the south is called Heng.\" It stands at the position of the *Yi* and *Zhen* constellations, radiating its light to assist the Purple Palace. It governs the root of the three *qi*, harmonizes the virtue of the five numina, aligns above with the constellations that bestow life, and below corresponds to the work of nurturing growth. As it apportions things with impartiality, it is called Mount Heng.\n\nThe *True Forms of the Five Marchmounts* states: \"The ten mountains—Qian, Huo, Lu, Shi, Ma, Jade Bamboo, Cavern Yang, Little Wei, Jiuyi, and Luofu—serve as its auxiliary peaks.\" There is also the divine immortal realm known as the *Crimson Mound Cavern*, a grotto-heaven. It further states: \"The mountain is endowed with numinous *qi*, and from time to time, extraordinary persons appear.\"\n\nThe *Records of the Court of Blessings* states: \"The Heaven of Crimson Mound spans seven hundred *li*, with seventy great peaks, five lesser peaks, and two altars: Dewlight and Bluemound. Those who study the Dao and dwell here ascend to transcend the world.\" The Bluemound Altar and the Cavern Numinous Source Dewlight Altar are both places of blessing.\n\nThe Five Marchmounts serve as guardians, each governed by a perfected transcendent, for they guide the clouds and rain, nourish the myriad beings, and bestow grace upon all living things.\n\n**The Five Peaks**\n\n1. **Zhurong Peak**\n2. **Purple Canopy Peak**\n3. **Cloudy Screen Peak**\n4. **Heavenly Pillar Peak**\n5. **Stone Granary Peak**\n\n**Zhurong Peak** rises 9,780 *zhang* above the earth. Located to the north of the other peaks, it is the tallest, towering above them. It contains the foundations of the Zhurong Temple, the Bluemound Altar, the Dewlight Altar, the White Jade Altar, the Thunder Duke’s Pool, the Wind Cave, the Immortal Pear Tree, and the foundations of the Upper Clarity Abbey. To the southeast of the peak lies the study hall of Li Bi.\n\n**Purple Canopy Peak** rises 4,500 *zhang* and nine *chi* above the earth. Its form is lofty and imposing, resembling a banner and canopy, hence its name. At its summit lies the Immortal’s Pool and the Pavilion of the Seven Perfected; below are the foundations of the Purple Canopy Abbey and the medicinal hall of the Wang family.\n\n**Cloudy Screen Peak**: In ancient times, when Yu the Great controlled the floods, he ascended this peak and erected a stele, recording the mountain’s height in tadpole script. Woodcutters in recent times have occasionally encountered it. The stele is profoundly numinous, concealing itself from view. There is also Yu’s Creek, Hidden Perfection Flat, Broken Stone Spring, Crimson Mound Cavern, Cinnabar Cliff, and the stone chamber of the immortals.\n\n**Heavenly Pillar Peak** resembles a pillar in form, hence its name; it is also called Pillar-Bracket Peak. Below it lies the stone altar of Lady Wei. Some say Lady Wei attained the Dao at this place.\n\n**Stone Granary Peak** appears from afar like a granary. Its summit is flat, spanning ten *zhang*. It is said to connect to a grotto palace. In ancient times, there was the Cavern Gate Abbey, where Master Hu Fu often rode a white leopard to wander. There is also a lesser Stone Granary Peak, below which stands the Temple of Shun. Additionally, there are the minor peaks: Flowery Canopy, Firefly, Alms Bowl Toss, and Returning Crow.\n\n**The Three Gorges**\n\n1. **Numinous Gorge**\n2. **Longevity Gorge**\n3. **Cavern Perfection Gorge**\n\n**Numinous Gorge** derives its name from its connection to the immortal source and its abundance of numinous herbs. It flows from the west of Purple Canopy Peak, passes the Abbey of Sagely Longevity, merges with Longevity Gorge, descends southward past the Marchmount Abbey, and branches to irrigate the plains, eventually joining the Cavern Perfection Gorge.\n\n**Temple of the Celestial Governor Huo**\n\nThe Temple of the Celestial Governor Huo stands before the Marchmount Abbey, over a hundred paces away. Originally, the south was associated with fire, and the deity Zhurong was matched to it. Emperor Xuanzong enfeoffed him as the Celestial Governor to correspond with the summer sacrifices. The temple has a temple warden and attendants. The original temple was on Zhurong Peak, but during the Sui dynasty, it was relocated, and the Abbey of Flourishing Marsh was dismantled to construct it. Today, the foundations of the ancient temple remain atop Zhurong Peak.\n\n**Temple of the Perfected Lords**\n\nThe Temple of the Perfected Lords stands fifty paces east of the Marchmount Abbey. Originally, it shared a temple with the Celestial Governor in separate halls. During the Kaiyuan era, Celestial Master Sima memorialized: \"Each of the Five Marchmounts’ grotto-heavens is governed by a perfected transcendent; they cannot share the same rain-prayer sacrifices with deities who partake of blood offerings.\" In accordance with the imperial decree, a pure temple was established for this marchmount. During the summer’s beginning, fasting and purification are observed, and offerings are made. Additionally, five Daoists are ordained to perpetually maintain the incense fires and sweeping. This was the decree issued on the fifteenth day of the fifth month in the fifteenth year of the Kaiyuan era.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Five Numinous Ones* states: \"Nine assistants serve the governor, with three hundred attending officials and thirty thousand feathered guards, making this a place for the state to pray to the perfected and petition for destiny.\"\n\nThe *Records of the Supreme Perfected* states: \"The Supreme Void Perfected governs the life-destiny of the Southern Marchmount; he is the Venerable Lord of Flame.\" The Perfected Lord Bao of Hidden Mountain serves as vice-governor, and the Perfected Lord Han of Huo Mountain assists. The Perfected Lord Huang of Golden Flower, Zuo Yuanfang of Heavenly Pillar, Zheng Siyuan of Southern Huo, Xu Ying of Huo Forest, Zhou Yang of Cinnabar Huo, and the Primordial Lady of Purple Void, Lady Wei Huacun, all reside in the offices of the auxiliary peaks. They oversee the convergence of Wu, Yue, Chu, and Shu, each charged with supervisory duties.\n\nThe Hengyue Abbey\n\nThe Hengyue Abbey stands at the foot of Huagai Peak. According to an ancient stele, it was established in the eighth year of the Taikang reign of the Jin dynasty by the Perfected Lord Xu Lingqi and the Perfected Lord Deng Yu. In the second year of the Tianjian reign of the Liang dynasty, the Perfected Lord Zhou Jingzhen further expanded and renovated it. Emperor Wu bestowed three hundred households of manor fields to serve as its endowment. By the eighth year of the Daye reign of the Sui dynasty, an imperial edict summoned Celestial Master Cai Fatao and Celestial Master Li Fachao to reside at the abbey, where they performed the incense-burning rites and propagated the teachings of the Dao. The fields, granaries, and miscellaneous properties of Hengzhou Prefecture were all granted to the abbey for its sustenance.\n\nIn the second year of the Zhenguan reign of the Tang dynasty, Emperor Taizong personally inscribed the abbey’s plaque and invited Celestial Master Zhang Huilang to ordain forty-nine Daoists for state-sponsored incense-burning rites. In the first year of the Hongdao reign of Emperor Gaozong, Celestial Master Ye Fashan was summoned to perform the feng rites for the Marchmount, designating a forty-li expanse as sacred ground for the abbey’s perpetual cultivation. Logging, hunting, and tribute offerings were henceforth prohibited as permanent statutes.\n\nWithin the abbey stands the Hall of Attained Dao and Descended Perfection of Master Tian, as well as the True Hall of Celestial Master Liu. Behind these lies the Ascension Altar of the Perfected Lord Yin. The abbey’s stele inscription was composed by the Sui scholar Cao Xian and remains extant today.\n\nThe Zhaoxian Abbey\n\nAccording to an ancient stele inscription, the Zhaoxian Abbey traces its origins to the Liu-Song dynasty, with its halls later partitioned during the Xiao-Qi dynasty. An alternate tradition holds that it was founded by the Perfected Lord Xu during the Xianheng reign of the Jin dynasty. On the second day of the seventh month in the first year of the Yuanxing reign of the Qi dynasty, the abbey’s abbot, the Ascended Mystery Daoist Zhang Tanyao, ascended to heaven on a crane in broad daylight. That night, thunder roared and lightning flashed, shaking heaven and earth. Roughly one li behind the present abbey stands the extant Ascending Heaven Incense Altar.\n\nIn the second year of the Zhenguan reign of the Tang dynasty, Celestial Master Xiao Linghu—a native of Luling—resided at the Marchmount. After the Zhaoxian Abbey had fallen into ruin and desolation, the Celestial Master, skilled in the arts of transmutation, transformed base metals into gold and silver. He then presented these to foreign envoys in exchange for funds to rebuild the abbey’s halls. Within a few years, the restoration was completed. In the fifth year of the Zhenguan reign, the Pavilion of Seeking the True was constructed.\n\nThe Abbey of Ninefold Perfection\n\nAccording to stele inscriptions, the Abbey of Ninefold Perfection was established by the Perfected One Deng during the Taikang reign of the Jin dynasty as a shrine to the Perfected One Xu. In the Kaiyuan reign of the Tang, the Heavenly Master Wang Xianqiao resided here.\n\nInitially, the Heavenly Master served as a wandering Daoist. His nature was profoundly attuned to the Dao, and he harbored extraordinary aspirations. He once carried over two hundred bundles of tea from Mount Heng to the capital, where he would set up his tea implements within the city gates to offer tea to passersby. One day, he unexpectedly encountered Gao Lishi, who regarded him with astonishment. Upon inquiring about his origins, the Heavenly Master replied, “I am a wandering Daoist from the Southern Marchmount. The halls of my home abbey, the Abbey of Ninefold Perfection, have fallen into disrepair, so I have brought this tea to seek benefactors.”\n\nThereupon, Gao Lishi reported this to the emperor. Emperor Xuanzong summoned the Heavenly Master and marveled at him for some time. The emperor then asked, “Do you have any wishes?” The Heavenly Master replied, “I wish for the flourishing of the imperial house and the prosperity of the sacred Dao.” Deeply impressed, the emperor bestowed upon him the rites of ordination within the inner palace, generously providing gold, silk, and funds for construction. He then sent the Heavenly Master back to Mount Heng to restore the abbey. Within a few years, the reconstruction was completed.\n\nThe Master’s Daoist practice grew ever more profound, and his reputation spread throughout the imperial realm. Soon came an imperial edict, bestowing upon him the title of Heavenly Master. On the thirtieth day of the third month in the second year of the Qianyuan era, he attained the Way.\n\nThere was also Heavenly Master Xue Jichang, formerly a magistrate of Mianzhu County in Mianzhou. He resigned his post in the capital to enter the Dao, his aspirations and conduct standing apart from the common. As he prepared to return to Mount Heng, the emperor learned of him. Emperor Xuanzong praised him and bestowed upon him generous gifts of gold and silk. The emperor then took up his brush to compose a poem in farewell, prefaced by a preface that read: “The Master of Refinement first doffed his official’s cap, his heart set upon the Southern Marchmount. Upon his elevation to the Register of Daoists, he came here with solemn resolve. Now he wishes to return to his former abode, there to dwell in emptiness and purity, neither forsaking his noble aspirations nor ceasing his earnest cultivation. By chance, he encountered an elixir of transcendence, and thus a man of his resolve has come to the imperial city.” Thereupon, he composed a poem to honor his departure:\n\nA guest refining truth in grottoes deep,\nTo Hengyang’s peaks his thoughts of home now turn.\nHe pledges to fulfill the golden palace’s decree,\nAnd offer scriptures of the Jade Clarity in return.\nThe cloud-laden path to the Three Heavens lies near,\nWhile pines by the stream in ten thousand silences yearn.\nStill he awaits the transmission of secret texts,\nTo come and go, awaiting the immortal’s chariot in turn.\n\nLater, he too was enfeoffed as Heavenly Master. This Heavenly Master took as his teacher Heavenly Master Sima, whom Emperor Xuanzong held in such high regard that he addressed him as “Daoist Brother.” All the furnishings and implements within the abbey were largely bestowed by imperial favor. Upon his departure, the emperor further presented him with one hundred gold vessels, two hundred silver vessels, and a vast quantity of silk, each accompanied by an imperial note. Heavenly Master Xue attained the Way on the sixth day of the second month in the second year of the Qianyuan era.\n\nAfter the chaos of war, the abbey was burned and laid waste. Though its halls were later rebuilt, they were never fully restored. Only one imperial gift remained—a bronze bell weighing four thousand catties. During the Xiantong era, Master Wang (styled Yinjie) served as abbot. His Daoist practice was exceptional, and his renovations extensive. His reputation reached the capital, and he was held in high esteem by princes and nobles. Today, he resides at Mount Heng, where he has been enfeoffed as Grand Master of the Comprehensive Teachings.\n\nBehind the abbey stands the Hall of Master Baiyun, where elixirs were once refined. Nearby lies a small pool called Sweet Spring, its waters sweet to the taste, and when used to brew tea, resembling milk. In former times, there was also a Sweet Spring Abbey.\n\n**Western Numinous Abbey**\nAccording to the *Illustrated Classic*, the Western Numinous Abbey was established in the fifth year of the Tianjian era of the Liang dynasty, originally under the stewardship of female Daoists. After the ravages of war, it has yet to be restored.\n\nTo the west stands the Altar of Lady Wei. During the Kaiyuan era, a female Daoist named Master Xue resided in the abbey and attained the Way. She later constructed a separate abbey by Morning Stream. Whenever she came and went, a white leopard would follow her, accompanying her on her journeys through the grotto-heavens. Heavenly Master Xue often visited her, though they never met. Later, she vanished without a trace.\n\n**Sacred Longevity Abbey**\nSacred Longevity Abbey was originally the study hall of Minister Lu of Lingxia. In the sixth year of the Xiantong era, he submitted a memorial to the throne, offering it as Sacred Longevity Abbey. Within the abbey, the Hall of Lord Lu’s True Self and the altar halls remain intact. There are also towering cliffs, sheer precipices, tall bamboo, and lush pines, with a murmuring stream and extraordinary scenery.\n\n**Palace of the Nine Immortals**\nThe Palace of the Nine Immortals was originally the residence of Perfected Zhang (named Shizhen). There is a stone altar, over a *zhang* square. In the third year of the Tianjian era of the Liang dynasty, eight immortals welcomed Perfected Zhang upon the altar, and together they ascended to heaven. In the ninth year of the Xiantong era, the prefect of Hengzhou, Magistrate Shi, memorialized to establish the palace’s nameplate. In the tenth month of the tenth year, an imperial edict was issued, approving the request.\n\n**Central Palace**\nThe Central Palace was originally the place where Perfected Wang of the Liang dynasty cultivated the Way and ascended. Later, during the Dali era, Master Li Delin resided here and attained the Dao.\n\n**Palace of Primordial Yang**\nThe Palace of Primordial Yang was originally the place where Perfected Chen Xingming of the Jin dynasty cultivated the Way and ascended.\n\n**Palace of Supreme Purity**\nThe Palace of Supreme Purity was originally the place where Perfected Xu Lingqi cultivated the Way and ascended. In the seventh year of the Dali era, Master Zhang Taikong of the Mystic Harmony resided here and attained the Dao. Later, in the first year of the Dazhong era, Han Weiyi also resided here and attained the Dao.\n\n**Purple Void Pavilion**\nThe Purple Void Pavilion houses the altar of Lady Wei, standing twelve *chi* high, its top round and flat, spanning roughly one *zhang*. It is also called the Flying Flow Altar. Tradition holds that Lady Wei rode a dragon here from Fuzhou. She was the daughter of the Jin dynasty’s Grand Commandant Shu, named Huacun, and was titled the Supreme Perfected Purple Void Princess. There are pavilions and statues, all solemnly arrayed. It is also said that during the Xianhe era of the Jin, she cultivated the Dao here. Half a *li* to the north lies the Divine Stream Dragon-Offering Pool, where golden dragons were cast after the completion of rituals.\n\n**Stone Chamber Hidden Perfection Palace**\nThe Stone Chamber Hidden Perfection Palace was where Master Liu Xuanjing of Guangcheng cultivated the Way during the Dali era. After ascending three or five steps along the ridge, he seized a tiger’s den and made it his dwelling, naming it Hidden Perfection Palace. Prefect Han Gao donated his salary to construct the Meeting Perfection Pavilion. Initially, the master cultivated the Dao here for over fifteen years, unknown to others. Later, an imperial astronomer divined that a star of a perfected one had appeared, and a hidden cultivator resided on this mountain, his attainment reflected in the celestial patterns. Upon hearing this, Emperor Wuzong swiftly issued an edict, instructing the local military commissioner to dispatch envoys with an imperial summons. The envoys searched the mountain thoroughly, leaving no place unvisited. One day, as they reached a spot over three *li* southwest of the Central Palace, they climbed the cliffs and grasped the vines, discovering a stone chamber, deep and winding, with signs of habitation. Parting the vines to enter, they found the master sitting in serene composure. The imperial envoy delivered the decree. At first, the master feigned madness, but later he accepted the summons and soon arrived at the imperial court. He was appointed as the Emperor’s Teacher and granted the title Master of Guangcheng. He later returned to this place and, not long after, achieved transcendence. Today, the stone chamber still bears the carved altar for rituals, the Terrace of Heavenly Treasure, the stone steps, the ritual jars, the gaming board, the tea kettle, and the lampstand, all hewn from stone and still preserved.\n\n**Tower of Soaring Void**\nThe Tower of Soaring Void was successively inhabited by Dao Master Xue Jichang and Venerable Zhou Hunwu, who both attained the Dao here.\n\n**Terrace of Grotto Spirits**\nThe Terrace of Grotto Spirits was where Dao Master Li Mingjun resided and attained the Dao. It is also a blessed land.\n\n**Incense-Adding Terrace**\nThe Incense-Adding Terrace was once inhabited by a female Daoist who attained the Dao. Today, the terrace and its sacred site remain.\n\n**Master Liu Gen’s Medicine Cliff**\nMaster Liu Gen’s Medicine Cliff was once inhabited by the immortal Liu Gen. The cultivation site lies northwest of the Palace of the Nine Immortals, deep and secluded, a place of extraordinary wonder.\n\n**Purple Canopy Abbey**\nThe Purple Canopy Abbey was once established by a Daoist. After the chaos of war, only its foundations remain.\n\n**White Cloud Master’s Medicine Hall**\nThe White Cloud Master’s Medicine Hall lies west of the Nine Perfected Abbey. During the Kaiyuan era, Dao Master Sima Chengzhen—originally titled the White Cloud Master and later granted the title Master of True Unity—once cultivated the Dao here.\n\n**Altar of Perfected Yin**\nThe Altar of Perfected Yin lies over a hundred paces north of the Yue Abbey. The perfected one, named Daoquan, ascended from this place.\n\n**Master Tian’s Medicine Cliff**\nMaster Tian’s Medicine Cliff lies over a hundred paces east of the Central Palace. The master, named Liangyi, cultivated the Dao here during the Yuanhe era and later attained it.\n\n**Northern Emperor Abbey**\nThe Northern Emperor Abbey lies northeast of the Yue Abbey, three *li* away. Once, the female Daoist Master Hou resided here, diligently tending the incense and later attaining the Dao.\n\n**Grotto Perfection Waterfall**\nThe Grotto Perfection Waterfall lies north of the Zhaoxian Abbey, three *li* away. The waterfall cascades like a curtain, descending to the pavilions. An inscribed stele records its marvels. Above it stands the Altar of Facing Heaven, where Perfected Zhang Tanyao once ascended. Below lies the Dragon-Offering Pool, where golden dragons were cast after the completion of rituals.\n\n**Wang Family Medicine Abbey**\nThe Wang Family Medicine Abbey was inhabited by the alchemist Wang during the Xiantong era. It boasted lush pines, tall bamboo, flowing streams, and distant vistas, along with many *gui* trees and tea gardens. Today, only its foundations remain.\n\n**Radiant Heaven Abbey**\nRadiant Heaven Abbey is said to have been built upon the foundations of the Rongfeng Abbey.\n\n**Hidden Perfection Plateau**\nThe Hidden Perfection Plateau lies amid the Cloud-Dense Peak, level and expansive, spanning five *li*. It is a place where immortals roam, yet few who seek it ever arrive.\n\n**Broken Stone Spring**\nThe Broken Stone Spring lies within the Hidden Perfection Plateau. Its source is a stone several *zhang* high and several *chi* wide, split in the middle. Carved upon it are the words: *\"Here flows cinnabar water, milky and sweetly fragrant. Whoever drinks it may live a thousand years.\"*\n\nThose who come seeking the spring hear only the sound of flowing water beneath the stone—when they listen from the left, it seems to fall on the right, and when they listen from the right, it shifts to the left. Few ever succeed in finding it.\n\n**Crimson Mound Grotto**\nThe Crimson Mound Grotto, also known as the Third Mao Cave-Heaven, lies three *li* due west of the Nine Immortals Palace. A stone cliff stands above, and below it lies a level slab of stone, two *zhang* square, where gold memorial tablets were once cast in ancient times. It is said to be the eastern gate of the Crimson Mound Grotto.\n\n**Nine Perfected of Former Ages**\nFrom the old stele of the Nine Immortals Palace:\n\n- Perfected Chen Xingming, who dwelt in the Yuan-Yang Abbey, ascended on the first day of the third month in the first year of Emperor Wu of Jin’s *Taishi* era.\n- Master Hu Fu, surnamed Shi and named Cun, resided in the Lofty Pavilion he built on the western peak of the Grotto Gate Abbey and ascended in the fourth month of the ninth year of Emperor Hui of Jin’s *Yongkang* era.\n- Perfected Yin Daoquan, who dwelt by the Stream of the Sacred Peak Abbey, ascended on the ninth day of the first month in the first year of Emperor Huai of Jin’s *Yuanjia* era.\n- Perfected Xu Lingqi, who dwelt in the Supreme Clarity Abbey, ascended on the ninth day of the ninth month in the second year of Emperor Ming of Song’s *Yuanhui* era.\n- Perfected Chen Huidu, who dwelt in the Ancient Jade Clarity Abbey, ascended on the thirteenth day of the fifth month in the second year of Emperor Wu of Qi’s *Yongming* era.\n- Perfected Zhang Tanyao, who dwelt in the Summoning Immortals Abbey, ascended on the third day of the seventh month in the first year of Emperor Gao of Qi’s *Yanxing* era.\n- Perfected Zhang Shihan, who dwelt in the Nine Immortals Palace, ascended on the thirteenth day of the seventh month in the third year of Emperor Wu of Liang’s *Tianjian* era.\n- Perfected Wang Lingyu, who dwelt in the Central Abbey, ascended on the thirteenth day of the seventh month in the eleventh year of Emperor Wu of Liang’s *Tianjian* era.\n- Perfected Deng Yuzhi, styled Xuanji, who dwelt in the Grotto Gate Abbey, ascended on the thirtieth day of the twelfth month in the tenth year of Emperor Wu of Liang’s *Tianjian* era.\n\nAdditionally, the two brothers Shuang Xi and Shuang Zibian attained the Dao in succession.\n\n**Attained the Dao in the Tang Dynasty**\nFourteen attained the Dao on the Sacred Peak:\n\n- Master Ao Jingtong ascended on the third day of the seventh month in the seventeenth year of the *Tianbao* era.\n- Master Xiao Linghu ascended on the fifteenth day of the eighth month in the third year of the *Hongdao* era.\n- Celestial Master Li Simu ascended on the twenty-sixth day of the eighth month in the fourteenth year of the *Tianbao* era.\n- Venerable He, who concealed his name, ascended on the fifteenth day of the tenth month in the second year of the *Tianbao* era.\n- Celestial Master Xue Jichang ascended on the sixth day of the second month in the second year of the *Qianyuan* era.\n- Celestial Master Wang Xianqiao ascended on the thirtieth day of the third month in the second year of the *Qianyuan* era.\n- Celestial Master Fu Daixian ascended on the seventh day of the eleventh month in the third year of the *Qianyuan* era.\n- Master Dong Qinxian ascended on the sixth day of the eleventh month in the first year of the *Dali* era.\n- Master Zhang Taikong of Xuanhe Abbey ascended at the Supreme Clarity Abbey on the eighth day of the second month in the seventh year of the *Dali* era.\n- Master Li Delin ascended at the Central Abbey on the fifth day of the ninth month in the twelfth year of the *Dali* era.\n- Master Tian Liangyi ascended at the Descending Perfection Abbey on the seventh day of the first month in the sixth year of the *Yuanhe* era.\n- Master Liu Xuanjing of Broad Clarity ascended on the eleventh day of the fifth month in the fifth year of the *Dazhong* era.\n- Venerable Zhou Hunwu ascended in the first month of the second year of the *Huichang* era.\n- Han Weiyi ascended at the Supreme Clarity Abbey in the first year of the *Dazhong* era.\n\nMaster Tian had three disciples—Recluse Chen, Recluse Feng, and Recluse Zhang—who all declined imperial summons and attained the Dao in succession on Mount Tiantai.\n\n**Biographies of the Perfected Lords**\nCompiled by Liu Xiang, Commandant of the Central Arsenal of Han.\n\nThe Master Red Pine was the Rain Master during the time of the Divine Farmer. He ingested *shuiyu* (water jade) to instruct the Divine Farmer and could enter fire to burn himself. He frequently journeyed to Mount Kunlun, often dwelling in the stone chamber of the Queen Mother of the West. Riding the winds and rains, he ascended and descended; the youngest daughter of the Flame Emperor pursued him and likewise departed with him. By the time of High Ancestor Xin, he again served as the Rain Master.\n\nThe Queen Mother had the face of a divine being, unbound hair adorned with a *sheng* (victory crown), tiger claws, and a mastery of the piercing cry. She dwelled in the cliffs, known as the Queen Mother, residing in the wilds of Kunlun.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nVast and distant, Master Red Pine,\nLight and fleeting, the maiden fair.\nHand in hand, they soar and wheel,\nTogether aloft, serene they rise.\nTheir bodies ride the endless winds,\nIn an instant, their wings span the Dark Garden.\nProfoundly attaining *kan* and *xun* (the trigrams of water and wind),\nThey set the model for the masters of rain.\n\n**Eulogy of Master Tian’s Portrait**\nComposed by Master Zhuge Huang of Meng Valley\n\nMaster Tian was a man of Mount Heng’s domain, born into the world with innate true *qi*, understanding the Dao from birth. Pure in filial piety, he nurtured his parents, grasping the principle of uncarved simplicity and naturalness. His words and appearance were unadorned; his furs and coarse robes were worn and tattered. Though lords and kings honored him with rites, he felt no glory. Though servants and laborers treated him lightly, he felt no disgrace. He commanded ghosts and spirits, and they arrived at his will. Once he entered Mount Heng, he concealed himself for fifty years. His nine hundred disciples were all men of high rank. They entreated him to be their master of the Dao, even to serve as the emperor’s teacher. He was the Master of Broad Clarity.\n\nAs for the Dao of this master, it may indeed be known. His form and bearing may be captured in portraits to endure from ancient times to the present—yet none have praised him. Huang, bearing this omission, composes this eulogy:\n\nA spirit-root uniquely flourishing,\nA perfected one born into the world.\nImmortality is not through accumulated study,\nThe Dao is naturally attained.\nVast in virtue and appearance,\nUnfettered in spirit and mien.\nThough this form remains as if present,\nIt may yet serve as a model.\n\n*Southern Marchmount Records* concludes. #1 The character 『史』 is likely superfluous.",

      "translated_text": "**Southern Marchmount Minor Record**\n\n**Title:** *Southern Marchmount Minor Record*\nBy Li Kunzhao of the Tang dynasty. Two texts in one fascicle.\nSource edition: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Cavern Mystery Division*, *Genealogical and Registral Category*.\n\n**Southern Marchmount Minor Record with Preface**\nRecorded by the Daoist Li Chongzhao\n\nIn my youth, I awakened to the Dao. In recent years, I have followed my master to the gates of the Marchmount, repeatedly seeking its numinous traces. I sought ancient records of wondrous and extraordinary events, but none could be found. It is said that after the ravages of war and fire, texts were scattered and lost. Thus, I examined ancient steles, the *Illustrated Classic of Mount Heng*, and local gazetteers, and consulted with venerable masters, elders at the foot of the mountain, and senior Daoists. Whatever I obtained, I promptly stored in baskets. Now, based on what I have gathered—from the Five Peaks and Three Gorges, the ancient temples and medicinal halls, to the lineages of those who attained the Dao and ascended in broad daylight, and the origins of its numinous marvels—I have abridged and recorded them directly, compiling this single fascicle under the title *Southern Marchmount Minor Record*. May those who chant the Dao and wander the mountains, upon perusing this, roughly understand the origins of its numinous traces.\n\nPreface composed in the winter of the *renxu* year, tenth month.\n\n**Account of the Marchmount**\n\nThe Southern Marchmount, as recorded in the *Rites of Zhou*: \"The mountain that guards the south is called Heng.\" It stands at the position of the *Yi* and *Zhen* constellations, radiating its light to assist the Purple Palace. It governs the root of the three *qi*, harmonizes the virtue of the five numina, aligns above with the constellations that bestow life, and below corresponds to the work of nurturing growth. As it apportions things with impartiality, it is called Mount Heng.\n\nThe *True Forms of the Five Marchmounts* states: \"The ten mountains—Qian, Huo, Lu, Shi, Ma, Jade Bamboo, Cavern Yang, Little Wei, Jiuyi, and Luofu—serve as its auxiliary peaks.\" There is also the divine immortal realm known as the *Crimson Mound Cavern*, a grotto-heaven. It further states: \"The mountain is endowed with numinous *qi*, and from time to time, extraordinary persons appear.\"\n\nThe *Records of the Court of Blessings* states: \"The Heaven of Crimson Mound spans seven hundred *li*, with seventy great peaks, five lesser peaks, and two altars: Dewlight and Bluemound. Those who study the Dao and dwell here ascend to transcend the world.\" The Bluemound Altar and the Cavern Numinous Source Dewlight Altar are both places of blessing.\n\nThe Five Marchmounts serve as guardians, each governed by a perfected transcendent, for they guide the clouds and rain, nourish the myriad beings, and bestow grace upon all living things.\n\n**The Five Peaks**\n\n1. **Zhurong Peak**\n2. **Purple Canopy Peak**\n3. **Cloudy Screen Peak**\n4. **Heavenly Pillar Peak**\n5. **Stone Granary Peak**\n\n**Zhurong Peak** rises 9,780 *zhang* above the earth. Located to the north of the other peaks, it is the tallest, towering above them. It contains the foundations of the Zhurong Temple, the Bluemound Altar, the Dewlight Altar, the White Jade Altar, the Thunder Duke’s Pool, the Wind Cave, the Immortal Pear Tree, and the foundations of the Upper Clarity Abbey. To the southeast of the peak lies the study hall of Li Bi.\n\n**Purple Canopy Peak** rises 4,500 *zhang* and nine *chi* above the earth. Its form is lofty and imposing, resembling a banner and canopy, hence its name. At its summit lies the Immortal’s Pool and the Pavilion of the Seven Perfected; below are the foundations of the Purple Canopy Abbey and the medicinal hall of the Wang family.\n\n**Cloudy Screen Peak**: In ancient times, when Yu the Great controlled the floods, he ascended this peak and erected a stele, recording the mountain’s height in tadpole script. Woodcutters in recent times have occasionally encountered it. The stele is profoundly numinous, concealing itself from view. There is also Yu’s Creek, Hidden Perfection Flat, Broken Stone Spring, Crimson Mound Cavern, Cinnabar Cliff, and the stone chamber of the immortals.\n\n**Heavenly Pillar Peak** resembles a pillar in form, hence its name; it is also called Pillar-Bracket Peak. Below it lies the stone altar of Lady Wei. Some say Lady Wei attained the Dao at this place.\n\n**Stone Granary Peak** appears from afar like a granary. Its summit is flat, spanning ten *zhang*. It is said to connect to a grotto palace. In ancient times, there was the Cavern Gate Abbey, where Master Hu Fu often rode a white leopard to wander. There is also a lesser Stone Granary Peak, below which stands the Temple of Shun. Additionally, there are the minor peaks: Flowery Canopy, Firefly, Alms Bowl Toss, and Returning Crow.\n\n**The Three Gorges**\n\n1. **Numinous Gorge**\n2. **Longevity Gorge**\n3. **Cavern Perfection Gorge**\n\n**Numinous Gorge** derives its name from its connection to the immortal source and its abundance of numinous herbs. It flows from the west of Purple Canopy Peak, passes the Abbey of Sagely Longevity, merges with Longevity Gorge, descends southward past the Marchmount Abbey, and branches to irrigate the plains, eventually joining the Cavern Perfection Gorge.\n\n**Temple of the Celestial Governor Huo**\n\nThe Temple of the Celestial Governor Huo stands before the Marchmount Abbey, over a hundred paces away. Originally, the south was associated with fire, and the deity Zhurong was matched to it. Emperor Xuanzong enfeoffed him as the Celestial Governor to correspond with the summer sacrifices. The temple has a temple warden and attendants. The original temple was on Zhurong Peak, but during the Sui dynasty, it was relocated, and the Abbey of Flourishing Marsh was dismantled to construct it. Today, the foundations of the ancient temple remain atop Zhurong Peak.\n\n**Temple of the Perfected Lords**\n\nThe Temple of the Perfected Lords stands fifty paces east of the Marchmount Abbey. Originally, it shared a temple with the Celestial Governor in separate halls. During the Kaiyuan era, Celestial Master Sima memorialized: \"Each of the Five Marchmounts’ grotto-heavens is governed by a perfected transcendent; they cannot share the same rain-prayer sacrifices with deities who partake of blood offerings.\" In accordance with the imperial decree, a pure temple was established for this marchmount. During the summer’s beginning, fasting and purification are observed, and offerings are made. Additionally, five Daoists are ordained to perpetually maintain the incense fires and sweeping. This was the decree issued on the fifteenth day of the fifth month in the fifteenth year of the Kaiyuan era.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Five Numinous Ones* states: \"Nine assistants serve the governor, with three hundred attending officials and thirty thousand feathered guards, making this a place for the state to pray to the perfected and petition for destiny.\"\n\nThe *Records of the Supreme Perfected* states: \"The Supreme Void Perfected governs the life-destiny of the Southern Marchmount; he is the Venerable Lord of Flame.\" The Perfected Lord Bao of Hidden Mountain serves as vice-governor, and the Perfected Lord Han of Huo Mountain assists. The Perfected Lord Huang of Golden Flower, Zuo Yuanfang of Heavenly Pillar, Zheng Siyuan of Southern Huo, Xu Ying of Huo Forest, Zhou Yang of Cinnabar Huo, and the Primordial Lady of Purple Void, Lady Wei Huacun, all reside in the offices of the auxiliary peaks. They oversee the convergence of Wu, Yue, Chu, and Shu, each charged with supervisory duties.",

      "translated_text": "The Hengyue Abbey\n\nThe Hengyue Abbey stands at the foot of Huagai Peak. According to an ancient stele, it was established in the eighth year of the Taikang reign of the Jin dynasty by the Perfected Lord Xu Lingqi and the Perfected Lord Deng Yu. In the second year of the Tianjian reign of the Liang dynasty, the Perfected Lord Zhou Jingzhen further expanded and renovated it. Emperor Wu bestowed three hundred households of manor fields to serve as its endowment. By the eighth year of the Daye reign of the Sui dynasty, an imperial edict summoned Celestial Master Cai Fatao and Celestial Master Li Fachao to reside at the abbey, where they performed the incense-burning rites and propagated the teachings of the Dao. The fields, granaries, and miscellaneous properties of Hengzhou Prefecture were all granted to the abbey for its sustenance.\n\nIn the second year of the Zhenguan reign of the Tang dynasty, Emperor Taizong personally inscribed the abbey’s plaque and invited Celestial Master Zhang Huilang to ordain forty-nine Daoists for state-sponsored incense-burning rites. In the first year of the Hongdao reign of Emperor Gaozong, Celestial Master Ye Fashan was summoned to perform the feng rites for the Marchmount, designating a forty-li expanse as sacred ground for the abbey’s perpetual cultivation. Logging, hunting, and tribute offerings were henceforth prohibited as permanent statutes.\n\nWithin the abbey stands the Hall of Attained Dao and Descended Perfection of Master Tian, as well as the True Hall of Celestial Master Liu. Behind these lies the Ascension Altar of the Perfected Lord Yin. The abbey’s stele inscription was composed by the Sui scholar Cao Xian and remains extant today.\n\nThe Zhaoxian Abbey\n\nAccording to an ancient stele inscription, the Zhaoxian Abbey traces its origins to the Liu-Song dynasty, with its halls later partitioned during the Xiao-Qi dynasty. An alternate tradition holds that it was founded by the Perfected Lord Xu during the Xianheng reign of the Jin dynasty. On the second day of the seventh month in the first year of the Yuanxing reign of the Qi dynasty, the abbey’s abbot, the Ascended Mystery Daoist Zhang Tanyao, ascended to heaven on a crane in broad daylight. That night, thunder roared and lightning flashed, shaking heaven and earth. Roughly one li behind the present abbey stands the extant Ascending Heaven Incense Altar.\n\nIn the second year of the Zhenguan reign of the Tang dynasty, Celestial Master Xiao Linghu—a native of Luling—resided at the Marchmount. After the Zhaoxian Abbey had fallen into ruin and desolation, the Celestial Master, skilled in the arts of transmutation, transformed base metals into gold and silver. He then presented these to foreign envoys in exchange for funds to rebuild the abbey’s halls. Within a few years, the restoration was completed. In the fifth year of the Zhenguan reign, the Pavilion of Seeking the True was constructed.",

In the Kaiyuan reign of the Tang, the Heavenly Master Wang Xianqiao resided here.\n\nInitially, the Heavenly Master served as a wandering Daoist. His nature was profoundly attuned to the Dao, and he harbored extraordinary aspirations. He once carried over two hundred bundles of tea from Mount Heng to the capital, where he would set up his tea implements within the city gates to offer tea to passersby. One day, he unexpectedly encountered Gao Lishi, who regarded him with astonishment. Upon inquiring about his origins, the Heavenly Master replied, “I am a wandering Daoist from the Southern Marchmount. The halls of my home abbey, the Abbey of Ninefold Perfection, have fallen into disrepair, so I have brought this tea to seek benefactors.”\n\nThereupon, Gao Lishi reported this to the emperor. Emperor Xuanzong summoned the Heavenly Master and marveled at him for some time. The emperor then asked, “Do you have any wishes?” The Heavenly Master replied, “I wish for the flourishing of the imperial house and the prosperity of the sacred Dao.” Deeply impressed, the emperor bestowed upon him the rites of ordination within the inner palace, generously providing gold, silk, and funds for construction. He then sent the Heavenly Master back to Mount Heng to restore the abbey. Within a few years, the reconstruction was completed.",

Soon came an imperial edict, bestowing upon him the title of Heavenly Master. On the thirtieth day of the third month in the second year of the Qianyuan era, he attained the Way.\n\nThere was also Heavenly Master Xue Jichang, formerly a magistrate of Mianzhu County in Mianzhou. He resigned his post in the capital to enter the Dao, his aspirations and conduct standing apart from the common. As he prepared to return to Mount Heng, the emperor learned of him. Emperor Xuanzong praised him and bestowed upon him generous gifts of gold and silk. The emperor then took up his brush to compose a poem in farewell, prefaced by a preface that read: “The Master of Refinement first doffed his official’s cap, his heart set upon the Southern Marchmount. Upon his elevation to the Register of Daoists, he came here with solemn resolve. Now he wishes to return to his former abode, there to dwell in emptiness and purity, neither forsaking his noble aspirations nor ceasing his earnest cultivation. By chance, he encountered an elixir of transcendence, and thus a man of his resolve has come to the imperial city.” Thereupon, he composed a poem to honor his departure:\n\nA guest refining truth in grottoes deep,\nTo Hengyang’s peaks his thoughts of home now turn.\nHe pledges to fulfill the golden palace’s decree,\nAnd offer scriptures of the Jade Clarity in return.\nThe cloud-laden path to the Three Heavens lies near,\nWhile pines by the stream in ten thousand silences yearn.\nStill he awaits the transmission of secret texts,\nTo come and go, awaiting the immortal’s chariot in turn.\n\nLater, he too was enfeoffed as Heavenly Master. This Heavenly Master took as his teacher Heavenly Master Sima, whom Emperor Xuanzong held in such high regard that he addressed him as “Daoist Brother.” All the furnishings and implements within the abbey were largely bestowed by imperial favor. Upon his departure, the emperor further presented him with one hundred gold vessels, two hundred silver vessels, and a vast quantity of silk, each accompanied by an imperial note. Heavenly Master Xue attained the Way on the sixth day of the second month in the second year of the Qianyuan era.\n\nAfter the chaos of war, the abbey was burned and laid waste. Though its halls were later rebuilt, they were never fully restored. Only one imperial gift remained—a bronze bell weighing four thousand catties. During the Xiantong era, Master Wang (styled Yinjie) served as abbot. His Daoist practice was exceptional, and his renovations extensive. His reputation reached the capital, and he was held in high esteem by princes and nobles. Today, he resides at Mount Heng, where he has been enfeoffed as Grand Master of the Comprehensive Teachings.\n\nBehind the abbey stands the Hall of Master Baiyun, where elixirs were once refined. Nearby lies a small pool called Sweet Spring, its waters sweet to the taste, and when used to brew tea, resembling milk. In former times, there was also a Sweet Spring Abbey.\n\n**Western Numinous Abbey**\nAccording to the *Illustrated Classic*, the Western Numinous Abbey was established in the fifth year of the Tianjian era of the Liang dynasty, originally under the stewardship of female Daoists. After the ravages of war, it has yet to be restored.\n\nTo the west stands the Altar of Lady Wei. During the Kaiyuan era, a female Daoist named Master Xue resided in the abbey and attained the Way. She later constructed a separate abbey by Morning Stream. Whenever she came and went, a white leopard would follow her, accompanying her on her journeys through the grotto-heavens. Heavenly Master Xue often visited her, though they never met. Later, she vanished without a trace.",

In the ninth year of the Xiantong era, the prefect of Hengzhou, Magistrate Shi, memorialized to establish the palace’s nameplate. In the tenth month of the tenth year, an imperial edict was issued, approving the request.\n\n**Central Palace**\nThe Central Palace was originally the place where Perfected Wang of the Liang dynasty cultivated the Way and ascended.

It is also called the Flying Flow Altar. Tradition holds that Lady Wei rode a dragon here from Fuzhou. She was the daughter of the Jin dynasty’s Grand Commandant Shu, named Huacun, and was titled the Supreme Perfected Purple Void Princess. There are pavilions and statues, all solemnly arrayed.

Half a *li* to the north lies the Divine Stream Dragon-Offering Pool, where golden dragons were cast after the completion of rituals.\n\n**Stone Chamber Hidden Perfection Palace**\nThe Stone Chamber Hidden Perfection Palace was where Master Liu Xuanjing of Guangcheng cultivated the Way during the Dali era. After ascending three or five steps along the ridge, he seized a tiger’s den and made it his dwelling, naming it Hidden Perfection Palace. Prefect Han Gao donated his salary to construct the Meeting Perfection Pavilion. Initially, the master cultivated the Dao here for over fifteen years, unknown to others. Later, an imperial astronomer divined that a star of a perfected one had appeared, and a hidden cultivator resided on this mountain, his attainment reflected in the celestial patterns. Upon hearing this, Emperor Wuzong swiftly issued an edict, instructing the local military commissioner to dispatch envoys with an imperial summons. The envoys searched the mountain thoroughly, leaving no place unvisited. One day, as they reached a spot over three *li* southwest of the Central Palace, they climbed the cliffs and grasped the vines, discovering a stone chamber, deep and winding, with signs of habitation. Parting the vines to enter, they found the master sitting in serene composure. The imperial envoy delivered the decree. At first, the master feigned madness, but later he accepted the summons and soon arrived at the imperial court. He was appointed as the Emperor’s Teacher and granted the title Master of Guangcheng. He later returned to this place and, not long after, achieved transcendence.

Once, the female Daoist Master Hou resided here, diligently tending the incense and later attaining the Dao.\n\n**Grotto Perfection Waterfall**\nThe Grotto Perfection Waterfall lies north of the Zhaoxian Abbey, three *li* away.

He ingested *shuiyu* (water jade) to instruct the Divine Farmer and could enter fire to burn himself. He frequently journeyed to Mount Kunlun, often dwelling in the stone chamber of the Queen Mother of the West. Riding the winds and rains, he ascended and descended; the youngest daughter of the Flame Emperor pursued him and likewise departed with him. By the time of High Ancestor Xin, he again served as the Rain Master.\n\nThe Queen Mother had the face of a divine being, unbound hair adorned with a *sheng* (victory crown), tiger claws, and a mastery of the piercing cry.

Pure in filial piety, he nurtured his parents, grasping the principle of uncarved simplicity and naturalness. His words and appearance were unadorned; his furs and coarse robes were worn and tattered. Though lords and kings honored him with rites, he felt no glory. Though servants and laborers treated him lightly, he felt no disgrace. He commanded ghosts and spirits, and they arrived at his will. Once he entered Mount Heng, he concealed himself for fifty years. His nine hundred disciples were all men of high rank. They entreated him to be their master of the Dao, even to serve as the emperor’s teacher. He was the Master of Broad Clarity.\n\nAs for the Dao of this master, it may indeed be known. His form and bearing may be captured in portraits to endure from ancient times to the present—yet none have praised him. Huang, bearing this omission, composes this eulogy:\n\nA spirit-root uniquely flourishing,\nA perfected one born into the world.\nImmortality is not through accumulated study,\nThe Dao is naturally attained.\nVast in virtue and appearance,\nUnfettered in spirit and mien.\nThough this form remains as if present,\nIt may yet serve as a model.\n\n*Southern Marchmount Records* concludes. #1 The character 『史』 is likely superfluous.",
