  "full_translation": "**Oral Instructions of the Orthodox Celestial Master to Zhao Sheng**\n\n**Title:** *Oral Instructions of the Orthodox Celestial Master to Zhao Sheng*\n**Author:** Unknown, approximately dated to the Northern and Southern Dynasties.\n**Attributed to:** The Orthodox Celestial Master Zhang Ling, instructing his disciple Zhao Sheng.\n**Volume:** One.\n**Source:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\n---\n\nThe Orthodox Celestial Master addressed Minister Zhao, saying: \"I wish to impart to you these oral instructions, yet I hesitate to speak.\"\nSheng kowtowed a thousand times, pleading for compassion and begging for even a single word.\nThe Master replied: \"Enough. I shall tell you next year.\"\n\nOn the seventh day of the first month in the *renwu* year, at midday, within the closed chamber of the Cloud Terrace Abbey, Sheng kowtowed a thousand times.\nThe Master spoke: \"The Most High has me, and I have you. Yet the covenant of office is most essential—difficult to fully declare. The Dao is weighty, its principles profound, and must not be recklessly transmitted. Now, the Nine Heavens stand in place, dispatching the Six Heavens to govern, distributing their influence across the ages. The Three Ways rectify disorder but cannot attain perfect balance. The *qi* of the Three and Five ascends to the Upper Three Heavens, provoking their wrath. Without the primordial Father and Mother presiding in rectitude, the Most High Lord Lao cut off the world and established anew the Orthodox Unity Alliance of Majestic Might. The Most High, in His transformative grace, did not scorn me—a lowly and insignificant man—bestowing upon me the true method to become Lord of the Hundred Spirits. He commanded me to open the Twenty-Four Abbeys to correspond with the Twenty-Four *qi*, establishing offices and registers to convert those of deviant customs. The Yellow and Elder Registers and the Red Script were given to cultivate immortality. My discourse on the Great Dao is now complete.\n\nFormerly, before the Most High Lord Lao, I stood with Yin by the Mengjin Ford. He revealed to me that Heaven follows a constant cycle of great epochs in transition. Previously, the Three Heavens had not been governed in accordance with the great deities, the Primordial Father and Mother. Now, He personally assumes the orthodox mandate to govern the Upper Three Heavens, dispatching Lord Li to shepherd the myriad people. Though I wished to decline this duty, the commands of the celestial offices were stern. They ordered the release of the residual *qi* of the Six Heavens, and the Three Offices and Hundred Spirits, wielding great weapons, diseases, tigers, wolves, serpents, vipers, and all poisons, to purge the world. At that time, the wrongfully afflicted were many, their suffering buried in the yellow springs. Good and evil were indistinguishable, and lamentations filled the earth. Of the twenty-four myriad people designated as the Seed People, only those who had previously attained the Dao and become immortals were exempt. The Sages had previously decreed the reckoning of the Three Yangs: from the great river in the south to the northern shores, from the eastern Yi to the western Mengfan. Already, the names of one myriad people were inscribed in the Supreme Mystery’s Purple Register. The remaining fourteen myriad were to be sought among the Three Eras. Twelve Immortals, riding flying dragons and accompanied by twenty-four officials and twelve jade maidens, were dispatched to traverse the world, examining prefectures, commanderies, villages, and hamlets. They sought those of purity, integrity, compassion, filial piety, loyalty, trustworthiness, simplicity, and sincerity to replenish the ranks of the Seed People and the immortal officials. I was first entrusted with registers to observe human nature, then with the Yellow and Elder Registers and the Red Script to distinguish the good and supplement the Seed People and immortal officials. As I conducted my inspections, the great epoch neared its end. On the *jiazi* day of the Metal Horse, as the sun tilted westward, I stood without pause. My virtue resonated with the lord of humanity, and I first appeared as a worldly minister. This *jiazi* marked the final reckoning. From this point, the Great Register was fixed, and no further registrations were needed. On the *jiashen* day, a great flood would scour away filth and impurity. The immortal officials, riding dragons, would not advance even an inch, nor would they see the Seed People. Only those wearing the Yellow and Elder Registers and presiding over abbeys, along with the Three Offices and Hundred Spirits, would be visible. Their documents would proliferate, mutually slandering and despising one another, muddying the pure texts. Many would wear the registers of office, falsely styling themselves as Perfected Ones, selling their arts for self-aggrandizement, deluding the foolish, and amassing wealth—seeking a foot of silk, ten coins, or a peck of rice—hoarding goods and valuing only immediate comfort, heedless of the great mandate’s approach. The Three Offices would record their transgressions: accepting bribes without shame, calling it plunder; failing to uphold trust and righteousness, sharing in the guilt. Those who committed improprieties were branded as lewd and licentious, their names inscribed in the black registers of the Three Paths. Not a single name was entered into the Supreme Mystery’s Purple Register. Even I, personally engaged in this work, witnessed such corruption. In later ages, the transmission of the Yellow and Red Scripts would become commonplace, indistinguishable from one another. The Most High, pitying the common people and cherishing the good as dearly as an infant, sought to extend the epoch. By the *renchen* and *guisi* years, the selection of the Seed People would be urgent. Now, the Supreme Mystery’s Nine Radiant Luminants and the Ten-Thousand-Named Life Talismans are issued to examine and distinguish the True Unity and the Seed People. The Most High dispatches the Twelve Immortal Officials to traverse the world. Upon seeing those who wear my Ten-Thousand-Named Nine Radiant Talismans, they will inscribe their names as the fixed number of Seed People in the Supreme Mystery’s Jade Register, with no further inquiries. When the era of Great Peace arrives, the Sage Lord will personally examine and select according to virtue, commanding the myriad ghostly soldiers, generals, and all poisons to protect the Seed People, ensuring their families remain whole until the age of Great Peace. Should any harm befall them, the offenders will be immediately executed upon discovery. Now, in this era of the Three Calamities, strife is rising. Great Peace lies at the end of the Metal Horse epoch, though the years remain distant. This world is no place for the worthy. I cannot bear to first ascend to heaven in broad daylight with the earthly households. You must refine the divine elixir and, with Sheng, retreat to seclusion, gathering the essence of stones, marrow of jade, rare pearls, phoenix brains, and sacred mushrooms—extraordinary and unparalleled substances. Following the four seasons, you will compound the Thousand-Day Elixir. Each of you will ingest a knife-tip’s measure, your bodies transforming into five colors, feathers sprouting instantly, your forms suffused with golden light. The Most High will dispatch immortal officials riding cranes and deer to welcome you. Ascending on emerald plumes, you will mount your steeds, lightly soaring. Ying and Zhi, the two youths, will grasp the dragons and ascend together. Zhao Sheng will attend me as we reach the Boundless Cliff amid the azure clouds. Leaping upon the dragons, we will linger on the celestial path. I shall call to you, Zhao Sheng: 'I now assume my position. Gather all matters with reverence, distinguishing life from death. The great epoch draws near, and I cannot return midway. Take the era of Great Peace as your term.' You must return to manage the abbey and broadly inform the faithful men and women, all disciples: those of loyalty and integrity must hasten, for the great epoch is imminent. Devote yourselves to loyalty and trustworthiness. Do not covet wealth or sensual pleasures. All things under heaven are born with a beginning and an end.\"\n\nLaozi adapts with the times, ever responding to the great epoch. When a person’s lifespan reaches one hundred and twenty years, they must pass through the Earthly Gate. Those who undergo the Ten Refinements and Nine Transformations, whose names are inscribed in the Supreme Mystery’s Purple Register, though their lives end, also traverse the Earthly Gate—yet their souls ascend at once to the Purple Palace, where they attend the Sacred Lord. Only when the era of Great Peace arrives will their essence and spirit return to their original form: white bones rise again, blood and qi flow anew. In but a single night, they lie down at dusk and rise at dawn, manifesting to the world. At such a time, even those who have received this talisman and hold office in the teachings of the Yellow and the Old must wield the Purple Gold Vajra. Without the talisman of the Nine Radiant Myriad Names, they cannot escape the Three Officials’ exorcism, nor avoid descending to the Yellow Springs in death. They will not pass through the Earthly Gate; their bones and flesh will turn to ash, and their souls will be delivered to the Three Officials for torment—suffering beyond words.\n\nThose who do not seek liberation through the corpse must conjoin the divine elixir. Thus, they must obtain the talisman of the Nine Radiant Myriad Names. Without this talisman, their names cannot be entered into the Supreme Mystery’s Register of the Living. This talisman is as the jade seal to the Son of Heaven, as the yellow battle-axe to the Three Dukes, as the seal and sash to the feudal lords. If there are virtuous and worthy persons who die without having seen this talisman in life, it may be conferred upon them posthumously. When the era of Great Peace comes, their corpses will revive, and they shall emerge with the Sacred Lord.\n\nAs I speak of this talisman, my mouth cannot bear to utter it, nor my hand to bestow it upon disciples. It is not of this world. Those who receive this talisman must cultivate their conduct, purify themselves, and embody filial piety, loyalty, integrity, sincerity, and faith. They must hold fast to truth and entrust themselves to the Dao. The examining officials arrive daily at the gates and thresholds, observing the hearts of men. If one faces peril or the last moment of life, let them rectify their heart, turn toward the Dao, and grasp the talisman of the Nine Radiant Myriad Names—the Most Revered, the Deliverer of humankind.\n\nAt this juncture of grace, the Sacred Lord humbles himself, drawing near to those he has endowed. Before the Sacred Lord descends, those who receive this talisman will not pass through the Earthly Gate but will naturally attain a lifespan of eighteen thousand years. Yet the Sacred Lord will examine and select among them, each according to their station.\n\nThose who received my talisman of the Nine Radiant Myriad Names before the years *renchen* and *guisi* are counted among the seed people. Those who receive it after *renchen* and *guisi* will no longer have the chance. Once the assembled officials gather at the Purple Palace and the immortals return to the Heavenly Bureau, it will no longer be conferred upon mortals.\n\nThese are the secret words from the heart and mouth of the Sage, the concealed talisman not lightly revealed. Yet the urgency of the times leaves me no choice but to empty my bag and pour out my heart. I dispatch one Attendant Minister to deliver the world and one Jade Maiden to accompany this talisman. Those who are unfilial, disloyal, impure, insincere, or untrustworthy—should they even glimpse this talisman, the Attendant Minister and Jade Maiden will cloud their minds so they cannot receive it. For those who are destined to receive it, the gods will open their hearts and incline them toward it. They will seek it with diligence and earnest entreaty.\n\nAmong the Three Ones, there may be a hundred; among the Nine Radiant Myriad Names, one. Among the Three Ones, a thousand; among the Nine Radiant Myriad Names, ten. You, whose form and shadow pervade the myriad spirits under heaven, must together guard this talisman, making it rarely seen. The world does not comprehend my words. Look to future generations: among ten thousand who receive the Dao, scarcely one will bear this talisman. Now I entrust it to you—this is my utmost.\n\nCommand your successors to select those of loyalty, integrity, purity, and single-minded devotion. According to the statutes, they must swear an oath and offer a thousand pieces of gold; do not display it lightly. In thirty years, I will send someone to welcome you.\n\nZhao Sheng bowed twice, prostrating himself, and received the command to take his leave.\n\nThe Orthodox Celestial Master concluded his oral instructions to Zhao Sheng.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi adapts with the times, ever responding to the great epoch. When a person’s lifespan reaches one hundred and twenty years, they must pass through the Earthly Gate. Those who undergo the Ten Refinements and Nine Transformations, whose names are inscribed in the Supreme Mystery’s Purple Register, though their lives end, also traverse the Earthly Gate—yet their souls ascend at once to the Purple Palace, where they attend the Sacred Lord. Only when the era of Great Peace arrives will their essence and spirit return to their original form: white bones rise again, blood and qi flow anew. In but a single night, they lie down at dusk and rise at dawn, manifesting to the world. At such a time, even those who have received this talisman and hold office in the teachings of the Yellow and the Old must wield the Purple Gold Vajra.
