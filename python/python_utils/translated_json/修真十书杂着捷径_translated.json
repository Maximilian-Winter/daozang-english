  "full_translation": "**The Seventeenth Scroll of *Ten Books on Cultivating the True: Miscellaneous Shortcuts*\n**The Emerald Void Chapter**\n**Biography of Master Mud-Pill Chen Pu**\n**The Secret Formula of the Ninefold Golden Elixir**\n\n**First Transformation: Descending the Elixir**\n**Second Transformation: Union of Yin and Yang**\n**Third Transformation: Nurturing Yang**\n**Fourth Transformation: Nurturing Yin**\n**Fifth Transformation: Transmuting the Bones**\n**Sixth Transformation: Transmuting the Flesh**\n**Seventh Transformation: Transmuting the Five Viscera and Six Bowels**\n**Eighth Transformation: Cultivating the Fire**\n**Ninth Transformation: Ascending in Flight**\n\n---\n\n### **First Transformation**\nBeneath the tongue lie four apertures: two connect to the heart, two to the fluids.\n\nThe work of the first transformation resembles a precious pearl,\nPenetrating the mountains, rivers, and cosmos with a numinous body.\nBeneath the red lotus leaves lies the elixir cave;\nCrimson waters flow, perfusing the ninefold pearl.\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe work of the inner elixir begins with the One and is completed in the Nine. The One is that from which the myriad things are born. Heaven generates Water as the One; Earth generates Fire as the Two; Heaven generates Wood as the Three; Earth generates Metal as the Four; Heaven generates Earth as the Five. The sequence of the Five Phases arises from the One. Thus, the work of the inner elixir also begins with the One, transforming to completion in the Nine—for Nine is the utmost of yang numbers. When the number reaches Nine, the Dao’s fruit is achieved.\n\nThe phrase *\"resembles a precious pearl\"* refers to the True Water of Heavenly One stored in the gallbladder. When yin and yang harmonize and descend, they form the elixir. The initial descent appears like a single dewdrop of luminous pearl. The pearl signifies the reverence due to the elixir.\n\nMoreover, the human body is formed through the union of father’s essence and mother’s blood—this is *formal union*. The descent of the elixir arises from the union of heart-fire and kidney-water—this is *qi union*. Thus it is said: formal union gives birth to humans, while qi union gives birth to the elixir. After the elixir descends, the spirit roams beyond the mundane; yin and yang achieve great harmony. One forgets the body in seated oblivion, and the mountains, rivers, cosmos, six directions, and ten thousand things all reside within one’s own body. One’s body exists beyond the cosmos, sensing only a single point of radiance within the heart—this is the descent of the elixir. Hence it is said: *\"the mountains, rivers, and cosmos penetrate the numinous body.\"* The body encompasses the mountains and rivers within itself.\n\nThe *\"red lotus\"* refers to the tongue. The two apertures connect to the heart, and the two apertures connect to the fluids. When a person is ill, the tongue’s fluids dry, and their true qi is depleted. The first step of the first transformation is to seal the two apertures beneath the tongue, preventing the true qi from leaking outward and allowing the divine water to flow. The *\"crimson waters\"* are the fluids of the heart. At the outset of each of the nine transformations, on every ninth day, one inhales nine times, with nine breaths per inhalation. Naturally, the fluids flow and generate beneath the tongue, irrigating the five viscera—hence the name *\"ninefold pearl.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Lyrics to *\"Gazing at the Jiangnan\"*:**\nSeal the apertures beneath the tongue,\nTo circulate the gallbladder’s qi.\nThe Yellow Center’s treasure\nMust be sought within the gallbladder.\nSpring’s qi engenders the ten thousand things;\nHeaven and Earth lie beneath my knees, my peers.\nThe hundred vessels flow freely.\nCreation is enacted,\nAs the twin fires are drawn left and right.\nVast and boundless, they illuminate the cosmos;\nA bitter mist ascends, veiling the encircling towers.\nHusband and wife gradually conspire.\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe qi of Heavenly One is called the *Yellow Center*. This qi is stored in the gallbladder as the root of life and destiny. Its flavor is bitter, and thus the gallbladder’s qi is also bitter—just as the roots and blossoms of plants are bitter. From this, we know that nothing can be born without generative qi.\n\nThe medicine of the inner elixir first seals the apertures beneath the tongue, internally connecting to the gallbladder’s generative qi. When it reaches the space between the throat and tongue, a faint bitter taste is sensed—this is the circulation of the elixir’s qi. Then, the mercury-water congeals to form the elixir.\n\nThe generative qi of Heaven and Earth sprouts in spring. The ten thousand things receive this qi before they can be born. Humans receive generative qi, storing it in the gallbladder. When one circulates the gallbladder’s qi, the inner elixir is accomplished. The work of the first transformation resembles spring among the four seasons. As the generative qi ascends, a bitter sensation arises. When yin and yang achieve great harmony and the spirit dwells beyond the heavens, even the cosmos lies beneath one’s knees. A vast qi fills Heaven and Earth; the hundred vessels flow freely, and the myriad apertures open and close. This is the descent of the inner elixir.\n\n*\"Creation is enacted\"* refers to the initial steps. First, seal the two apertures beneath the tongue to prevent qi from leaking outward. The qi on the left side penetrates the left Greater Yang and enters the brain; the qi on the right penetrates the right Greater Yin and enters the brain. Both pass through the brain and enter the Mud-Pill Palace atop the head, merging into one. They descend through the twelve-storied tower of the throat, enter the heart meridian, and transmit to the gallbladder, unsealing the gallbladder’s aperture. This allows the gallbladder’s generative qi to ascend, following the heart and gallbladder meridians to the tongue’s apertures. When the tongue tastes bitterness, it is the influx of generative qi, signaling the imminent descent of the elixir.\n\nThen, firmly seal the tongue’s apertures. The qi on both sides ascends, creating a surging sensation. Once the gallbladder’s aperture is sealed, the generative qi wafts upward through the twelve-storied tower of the throat, rising from the apertures beneath the tongue. The mouth fills with bitterness—this is the circulation of generative qi.\n\n*\"Husband and wife\"* refer to yin and yang. The husband is yang; the wife is yin. When generative qi flows freely, yin and yang achieve great harmony, and the heart and kidneys unite. Thus, it is said they *\"gradually conspire.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Oral Instructions:**\nAt the outset of practice, one must first harmonize the five viscera through diet—neither hungry nor sated. The field of the heart must be tranquil, free from worry or distraction, before one may enter the Dao.\n\nAt the end of the second watch, at the beginning of the third, wash and rinse, settle the spirit, enter the chamber, burn incense, sit cross-legged, close the eyes, and concentrate the spirit. Wait until the breath is even, then first curl the tongue upward, sealing the two apertures at its root. Gradually, one will sense two streams of qi along the Greater Yang meridians, surging upward from the roots of the molars to penetrate the two Greater Yang points, then entering the crown of the head. When the two qi merge, count this as one cycle. Then close the eyes for a long while, and again curl the tongue as before, waiting until the qi reaches the Mud-Pill Palace. Perform this three times each night before stopping.\n\nAfter several nights or days of practice, one gradually senses the qi flowing from the Mud-Pill Palace into the twelve-storied tower beneath the brain, piercing the spine, threading through the tailgate, then surging forward to the heart, passing through the gallbladder and navel. The stomach feels gently warm, and a subtle harmony and ease arise—this is the true descent.\n\nAfter several more nights, the qi reaches the heart, which begins to feel mildly warm, or the heart’s qi stirs slightly. Then, a warm qi rises from the heart, passing the twelve-storied tower, and the mouth tastes faint bitterness—this is the Central Yellow qi emerging from the gallbladder. When yin and yang achieve great harmony, the descent of the elixir draws near.\n\nFrom this point onward, at the start of each night’s practice, have someone stand guard outside the door to prevent anyone from entering, or cats and dogs from startling you. When practicing two or three times each night, place a small table before you. If suddenly the qi surges, the body feels gradually expanding, the spirit soaring, and one perceives that houses, people, mountains, and rivers all lie within one’s own body, while hands and feet seem to vanish. Quickly press your hands on the table, close your eyes, and you will distinctly sense a luminous orb, round as the sun, at the heart’s center. Suddenly, it plunges into the cinnabar field—this is the descent of the elixir.\n\nAfter the elixir descends, do not open your eyes at once. Gradually gather the spirit, settle the four limbs, and restore them to stillness. If the hands or feet feel numb, wait until fully composed before opening the eyes. Then drink ginseng broth, sleep until morning, and take congee. Nourish yourself for one or two days, as if the elixir has descended.\n\nOnce the elixir descends, all illnesses vanish, and no suffering or affliction remains.\n\n**Second Cycle**\nThe second cycle begins with yang’s completion, weaving yin;\nKidney’s light and heart’s fluid merge as ding and ren.\nThe spirit-pearl, swift as lightning, returns to the Eastern Sea,\nIts radiant glow, in bursts, illumines purple gold.\n\n**Explanation:**\nAt the start of the second cycle, it is like a woman two months with child. The initial descent of the embryo is the true yang’s spirit forming the elixir. The heart, belonging to fire, is yin and corresponds to the southern ding fire—ding being fire’s yin. The kidneys, belonging to water, are yang and correspond to the northern ren water—ren being water’s yang.\n\nMaster Lü says:\n*Fire draws the cinnabar phoenix’s marrow from the south,\nWater seeks the black turtle’s essence from the northern sea.*\n\nThus, in the second cycle, one nurtures yang, allowing the heart’s fire-light to stir below. In the third cycle, one nurtures yin, enabling the kidney’s water-fluid to unite above. True water and true fire, above and below, pair as ding and ren, cradling the true elixir to complete the transformation.\n\nWhen the elixir first descends, it is nurtured in the heart, cultivated by true fire to quicken its growth. Once the first cycle succeeds, the elixir flows down from the heart’s network and is stored in the cinnabar field, where it is nurtured by true water—this is the work of the second cycle.\n\nAfter the elixir is stored in the cinnabar field, sitting in quietude within an empty chamber, one may suddenly perceive a luminous glow emanating from the embryo, like a golden orb—this is the moonlight.\n\n**To the Tune of \"Gazing at the Yangtze\"**\nThe dark pearl descends,\nThe elixir’s chamber lies within the Central Palace.\n\nNine breaths harmonized, the count of nine repeated ninefold,\nCrimson waves may surge, bound by the solar plexus.\nHeart and kidney then commune.\nAt each sixth shift, six breaths compound the yin work.\nFire from the Sea Gate ascends to the Emperor’s Seat,\nWater from the lotus calyx aids Lord Ding.\nA purple lightning pierces the crystalline.\n\nExplanation: The dark pearl is the true elixir. At the first turning’s outset, the elixir descends into the heart’s network—hence, “the elixir’s chamber lies within the Central Palace.” Each descent marks one turning. After the elixir descends, whenever nine days pass, one closes the breath for nine breaths as one cycle, reaching nine nines—eighty-one—as nine cycles, thus called “the count of nine repeated ninefold.” When the nine nines’ work is complete, true yang elixir is full, flowing from the heart’s network into the cinnabar field, where the elixir is stored in the water palace to nurture its yin. The “solar plexus” is the water palace’s image, the cinnabar field’s kidney-water. The elixir’s spirit is stored in the heart to nourish true fire; the elixir’s turning returns to the kidney to nurture true water. With water and fire in harmony, yin and yang greatly balanced, this is called “heart and kidney commune,” the accomplishment of the second turning. At the third turning’s outset, at each sixth day, one closes the breath, six breaths as one cycle, six sixes—thirty-six—as one round, to nurture its yin, thus called “six breaths compound the yin work.” The Sea Gate is the cinnabar field’s kidney palace. When the true elixir is stored in the cinnabar field and the elixir’s yang number is full, at each noon, the spirit from the cinnabar field’s heat reaches upward to ascend to the heart. The Emperor’s Seat is the heart; the lotus calyx, the tongue. When the inner yin number of six sixes is full, then the lower lotus pool’s spirit-water irrigates the heart’s network to nourish the elixir’s qi—thus, “aids Lord Ding.” Ding is the heart’s fire. Here, true water and true fire achieve the work of harmony. With yin and yang in harmony and the true elixir’s qi full, at times a spirit-light emerges from the face and eyes. At midnight, sitting in stillness, one inwardly gazes at the viscera, inside and out distinct, directly perceiving the dark pearl nurtured in the cinnabar field—thus, “pierces the crystalline.”\n\n**Oral Instructions:**\nAfter the elixir descends and the first turning is complete, whenever the ninth, nineteenth, or twenty-ninth day arrives at noon, sit in quietude within an empty chamber, cross the legs, close the eyes, sit upright, and tap the teeth nine times. With spirit and qi communing, then close the breath. Each closure counts nine breaths as one cycle; open the eyes for a long while. Close the breath again as before, nine breaths as one cycle. At first, one or two closures may bring warmth; by the fifth closure, extreme heat arises. Using nine closures, continue without pause until the inner fire’s work is full, resonating with heaven and earth, regardless of distance. Or, when the breath reaches nine and the heart feels warmth, the four spirits harmonize and flourish, the heart-spirit stirs, and a stream of heat descends to the cinnabar field—this marks the second turning’s completion. Thereafter, do not practice the nine-breath count. The third turning...\n\nThe third turning conducts yang into the left palace, where the Mystic Pearl’s fetal hue gradually brightens to crimson. The numinous fire nurtures and divides its forms, while celestial tones spur the work of creation.\n\nExplanation: Upon the third turning’s completion, when heaven’s yin movement arrives, one nourishes the true yin qi. Once the inner yin’s count is full, the elixir enters the cinnabar field and flows to the left flank, causing the four limbs to perspire and thereby restrain the corpse-qi. With the third turning’s work accomplished, the Three Worms are no more. The luminous pearl is the inner elixir. Thereafter, the yang qi becomes abundant, and even urine, nasal mucus, and sleep drool all take on a pink hue, corresponding to the pure yang essence. When the elixir’s radiance reveals a single bright pearl like a wheel of fire beneath the left knee, the third turning’s count is complete. At each month’s end, one uses the left hand to stroke the crown while drawing breath to stir the elixir fire, heating the five viscera—this is called nurturing the fire to circulate the elixir. From this point, the cinnabar field gradually feels as though it contains an object, and with each inhalation, the elixir stirs—hence the phrase “dividing its forms.” When heaven and earth harmonize, their stirring produces sound, known as the celestial tone. If the nine orifices are blocked, one does not hear it. After the third turning, the nine orifices become keenly perceptive, and the celestial tone is heard day and night.\n\n*To the tune of \"Gazing at the Southern River\"*\nHair and skin grow fine,\nas the third turning moves yang.\n\nThe fetal hue gradually reddens as yin recedes, contracting and shifting with the year’s cyclical movement to aid yang’s firmness—nurturing the fire to cultivate the center. As the manifestation takes form, the fifth turning discerns the subtle and indistinct. Its ingress and egress remain slow, its form still small; at dawn and dusk, one drinks the jade potion’s nectar. The celestial tone plays the reed pipes.\n\nExplanation: When the third turning completes the yang count, the yin tortoise gradually contracts, and the intestines and stomach slowly coil. Within a month, there are ten movements of both stool and urine. One gradually enters the earth’s position, nearing the attainment of the Dao of no leakage. The *Qian* hexagram is wholly yang, symbolizing pure yang. Stroking the crown while drawing breath inwardly nurtures the fire; the elixir embraces the sacred embryo, which begins to take shape, though the five peaks remain incomplete. At the eighth turning, its form stirs like that of a small child of three or four inches, yet not distinctly visible. As yang qi is now full but has not yet nurtured yin, the sacred embryo possesses a soul but not yet a corporeal spirit—thus its ingress and egress remain slow, its form still small. When the sacred embryo takes shape, during seated meditation one constantly sees the radiance of the face and eyes, and the sweet dew of the bubbling spring flows forth. Drinking it, the seven orifices grow keen, and one hears the music of immortals.\n\nOral Instructions:\nAfter the elixir enters the left cheek, the work of the third turning is complete. On the sixth, sixteenth, and twenty-sixth days of each month—these three sixes—at midnight of the *zi* hour, one washes and rinses, enters a pure chamber, sits upright with legs crossed, and taps the teeth six times. Collecting the spirit and settling the qi, one closes the mouth and draws breath six times as one cycle, repeating this six times to finish. Within the month, performing this on the three sixes completes three full cycles. At midnight of the *zi* hour on the month’s last day, as before, one sits in the pure chamber with eyes closed and legs crossed. First, the left hand strokes the crown, while the right hand strokes the tailbone at the spine’s end, turning seventy-seven times (seven by seven, forty-nine). While stroking, one holds the breath tightly; when the count is complete, one rests briefly, then resumes when the qi settles. After doing this twice, one feels the qi of heart and kidney merging at the diaphragm, gently stirring the elixir qi, which fills the five viscera. When the five viscera grow warm as fire, it is the sign to activate the fire. On the three sixes or the month’s end, one may suddenly feel the elixir stirring beneath the left rib, with a faint thread of hot qi passing through the cinnabar field straight into the rib’s underside—its heat like fire, shaking for a long while before settling. This completes the work of the fourth turning. From this point onward, one no longer follows the heavy heaven’s count. The Fourth Turning.\n\nClosing the yang gate’s qi.\nThe nose is heaven’s aperture; the mouth, earth’s aperture.\nAt the fourth turning, yin enters the right pass—\nthe sacred embryo’s numinous work blooms in crimson countenance.\nA halo of radiance fills the chamber, yet the spirit remains untraceable,\ndrifting to the strains of celestial music, departing and returning at will.\n\nExplanation:\nThe left pertains to yang; the right, to yin.\nAfter the fourth turning, the inner elixir resides in the right flank,\naligning with the inner yin’s measure—\nfrom this point, both inner yin and yang are complete.\nThe third turning nurtures yang, and the sacred embryo generates the hun-soul;\nthe fourth turning nurtures yin, and the sacred embryo generates the po-soul.\nAt the elixir’s fourth turning, the sacred embryo’s hun and po settle within the five peaks,\nwhile spirit and inner visage merge with my own—\nthis is the true body for spirit’s emergence.\nAfter the fourth turning, with yin and yang qi replete,\none sits upright, closes the breath, and the inner spirit-light issues from the crown gate,\nlike a bright moon encircling the body.\nThe spirit roams beyond the mundane, entering and exiting without obstruction,\nsitting in the chamber yet perceiving the four seas and discerning fortune or misfortune.\n\n*To the tune of \"Wang Jiangnan\"*\nThe elixir has returned—\nat the fourth turning, yin is set in motion.\nOn the sixth day, seal the yang gate’s qi;\nthe three passes fully open, uniting ding and ren.\nThe turtle drifts as it pleases, rising and sinking.\nAt times it emerges, untraceable, piercing others’ hearts.\nPlayfully, the spirit-sage often appears before one’s face,\na halo of radiance spanning a thousand fathoms.\nNeither cold nor heat can assail.\n\nExplanation:\nThe fourth turning nurtures inner yin, and the elixir is stored in the right flank.\nThe nose is heaven’s aperture; the mouth, earth’s aperture.\nQi exhaled through the nose pertains to yang; qi exhaled through the mouth, to yin.\nOn the nights of the three sixes, one seals the nose’s breath,\ncutting off the breath’s coming and going—\nyang qi descends within, filling the five viscera,\nthus nurturing yin with yang.\nClosing the nose’s aperture fills the flower pond with water,\nwhich descends to moisten the heart’s network—\nwater and fire intermingle within.\nHeart qi descends; kidney qi ascends.\nDing and ren unite, and the sacred embryo’s yin and yang measures are complete.\nThe elixir in the right flank rises and falls with the qi,\nlike a turtle in water, drifting freely.\nThe inner elixir’s brilliance envelops my body,\nappearing like the moon—\nneither cold nor heat can invade.\nMy heart connects with others’ hearts, discerning good and evil.\nThe infant brother enters and exits, playfully roaming the four seas—\none’s name is recorded in the immortal register.\n\nOral Instructions:\nAfter the elixir enters the right cheek,\nthe work of the fourth turning is cultivated.\nOn the nights of the sixth, sixteenth, and twenty-sixth of each month,\nat the midnight hour of *zi*,\none washes and rinses, then enters a quiet chamber,\nsitting cross-legged with eyes closed.\nOne clicks the teeth thirty-six times,\ngathering the spirit and settling the qi,\nsealing the nose’s breath and remaining utterly still,\nwaiting until the true qi and inner elixir field’s qi interpenetrate.\nThe tongue’s aperture is the flower pond.\nWhen saliva wells up to fill the mouth, nearly overflowing,\none slowly swallows it, guiding it to the heart.\n\nWhen the divine water reaches the heart, it stirs the divine fire, warming the five viscera. Sweat bathes the entire body, and the four limbs feel refreshed. This occurs on the nights of the first, second, and third *yuan*. Perform this practice three times in succession before ceasing—this is the divine water and divine fire embracing and nurturing the primordial essence.\n\nAfter this nurturing, during the cultivation of the three passes’ inner elixir, a sound like thunder may arise from the face, and a stream of hot qi enters the elixir field. Firelight flashes from the nose, whereupon the inner elixir returns to the elixir field, completing the fifth turning. From this point onward, the method of sealing the yang gate is no longer practiced.\n\n**Fifth Turning**\nThe fifth turning: yin and yang’s transformation is complete,\nA foot-long infant plays with yang essence.\nIn sleep, it roams the four seas; awake, it knows its place,\nComing and going without effort, walking at will.\n\nExplanation:\nThe fourth turning nurtures inner yin,\nThe third turning nurtures inner yang.\nIn the fifth turning, the numbers of inner and outer yin and yang are fulfilled,\nAnd the work of transformation is accomplished.\nThe sacred embryo is nurtured to completion,\nAnd spiritual powers arise spontaneously—hence, \"transformation is complete.\"\n\nAfter the fifth turning, the inner elixir’s sacred embryo matures into a numinous body, growing over a foot in length. From this point, one absorbs the essence of the sun to nourish outer yang, seizing the transformative power of Heaven and Earth.\n\nOrdinary people, lacking inner cultivation, scatter their spirit and essence without refuge. By day, their spirit dwells in the heart; by night, it departs the body. When they fall asleep, their spirit has no anchor, unaware even of their own form or whereabouts. It follows the hun and po into dark realms, mingling with ghosts. In dreams, they see all things, their four great elements decaying. The spirit follows ghosts, reborn according to their fortune—heaven or hell, all beyond their control. This is the fate of those whose spirit does not recognize its body, adrift like waves in the current.\n\nThe perfected one who attains the Dao, having completed the inner elixir, unites spirit with body. External things cannot tempt them. Thus, the hun and po lie dormant, and the myriad evils cannot intrude. Free from care, they transcend life and death—all is within their mastery. Entering and exiting the spirit, their movements are unfathomable. Hence, the elixir scriptures say: *\"The perfected one has no dreams.\"* This is what it means.\n\nThe perfected one who attains the Dao has a spirit unobstructed, the hun dwelling within them, walking at will without attachment.\n\n*Wang Jiang Nan*\nThe pearl from the right,\nA purple lightning enters the elixir city.\n\nThe inner infant nurtures into a crimson elephant,\nAt the hour of the fifth revolution, gather the yang essence.\nFire arises from water.\nBurning the ghostly mountain,\nPurple lightning surges, towering and majestic.\nRoaming freely within the seas of the world,\nAsleep like a long whale resting on sandy shoals.\nThe seasons move in harmony with it.\n\nExplanation: When the fifth revolution is complete, yin and yang numbers are fulfilled, and the mysterious pearl of the inner elixir suddenly emits a true fire from the right flank into the cinnabar field, roaring like thunder, blazing like flame. This is the pearl’s inner yin and yang returning to the cinnabar field to fulfill the fifth revolution’s position. Within the sacred embryo, the perfected one is accomplished, entering and exiting through the crown gate, over a foot in length. The third revolution nurtures yang, the fourth nurtures yin; when the inner yin and yang are both fulfilled, the cinnabar field’s work is complete. The fifth revolution seizes the creative power of heaven and earth, drawing the essence of the sun to perfect the path of outer yang cultivation—proceeding from inner to outer, following the natural order. Thus, after the fifth revolution, within a single month, on the days of the three nines, one draws the essence of the sun and moon to nurture the sacred embryo. The method of practice is to seek fire through water, seek yang through yin; when water and fire are in harmony, yin and yang achieve great balance—hence, \"fire arises from water.\" Ordinary people accumulate yin qi below the cinnabar field, calling it the ghostly mountain. When the body is wholly yang, the yin mountain and ghostly peak are incinerated, the yang palace is established, and the divine court is erected. Master Lü said: *\"The mountain-burning talisman makes ghosts hard to see.\"* This is what it means. The spirit moves at will, traveling the four seas, coming and going as one desires. In sleep, one recognizes the body; in waking, one knows its place. Moving the spirit out of the body, one observes one’s true form, like a long whale beyond the sandy shoals. After the fifth revolution, the creative work is complete, aligning virtue with heaven and earth, brightness with the sun and moon. The inner elixir’s creation moves in step with time.\n\nOral Instructions:\nWhen the inner elixir returns to the cinnabar field, the fifth revolution’s work is accomplished. When the inner yin and yang numbers are fulfilled, one must gather the outer yin and yang to complete the great Dao. Whenever encountering the ninth, nineteenth, or twenty-ninth day of each month—the three nines—at high noon, face south, sit cross-legged with eyes closed, and sit opposite the sun. Wait for the qi to settle, cut off nasal breathing, so that qi does not come or go, true yang is not lost, and fills the interior. The inner true fire communicates, and one feels the entire body suffused with redness, light filling the room. After one or two moments, a stream of true water from the cinnabar field, like a jade-like qi, rises straight to the heart, like nine floating water crystals above the heart. Then, close the eyes and open the breath, inhaling through the nose—eighty-one breaths in nine sets of nine—drawing them into the heart. Once the sunlight reaches the heart, one gradually feels the qi at the heart stirring, like a fish leaping in the cinnabar field. This is the great harmony of yin and yang, stopping at eighty-one breaths. Practice this for three years to complete it. After three years, cease gathering the sun’s essence and instead gather the moon’s radiance.\n\nSixth Revolution:\nThe sun has five colors over three years,\nThe moon has nine rays over one year.\nIn the sixth revolution, the cinnabar field plays with the moon’s radiance,\nTransforming the embryo’s hun and po, their shadows subtly vanishing.\nYang cinnabar changes the bones, yin dissolves the flesh,\nExchanging all for true suchness, flawless as jade.\n\nExplanation: When the elixir reaches the sixth revolution, inner and outer yin and yang are both complete, the sacred embryo fully formed, and the perfected one becomes one with the inner body. On every full moon night, one gathers the moon’s radiance to accumulate yin—hence, \"playing with the moon’s radiance.\" In the fifth revolution, true yang is complete, and the hun transforms into spirit; in the sixth, true yin is complete, and the po transforms into qi. With hun and po fully integrated inside and out, one roams within the sun, leaving no shadow, becoming one with the sun’s pure yang. Thereafter, ghosts and spirits cannot be seen, yin and yang cannot be fathomed, achieving the path of true immortality—hence, \"their shadows subtly vanish.\" The ordinary person’s impure bones and turbid embryo, with unclean yin and yang, cannot ascend to attain the Dao. When the perfected one’s elixir is complete, from the fourth to the fifth revolution, one gathers the sun’s essence into the cinnabar field to form yang cinnabar. The cinnabar congeals within, entering the bone marrow, dissolving with sweat—hence, \"yang cinnabar changes the bones.\" After the bone change, in the sixth revolution, one gathers the moon’s radiance into the cinnabar field to form yin powder. After a year of gathering the moon’s radiance, the yin powder transforms within, entering the body to nurture immortal flesh. One feels blood constantly flowing with urine—this is yin dissolving the ordinary flesh, immortal flesh naturally growing—hence, \"yin dissolves the flesh.\" Jade with flaws is not true jade; a person with an ordinary embryo and turbid bones is not a true person. After the sixth revolution, one exchanges the old bones for immortal bones, sheds the ordinary flesh to grow immortal flesh, exchanging all for flawlessness, pure as a divine immortal.\n\n*Wang Jiang Nan*\nThe sun’s essence fills,\nThe yin po transforms into formlessness.\n\nAt each full moon, open the earthly gate,\nThe sacred tortoise drinks the azure jade’s essence.\nPure and clean as ice once more,\nYang cinnabar glows red,\nYin powder bears a faint blue-green hue.\nPowder replaces flesh, cinnabar replaces bone,\nThe ordinary embryo is wholly exchanged for the sacred embryo’s numen.\nAscending swift as a shooting star.\n\nExplanation: When yin and yang numbers are complete, the hun and po unite within and without, the body casts no shadow—this is the Dao of ascending as a perfected one. In the sixth revolution, at each fifteenth day, the internal and external water and fire achieve harmony to congeal yin powder, flowing in communion with heaven and earth’s creative transformations to nurture the sacred embryo’s substance. The \"sacred tortoise\" is the tortoise within kidney water. Master Lü said: \"The sea-tortoise child men do not recognize; the mountain-sealing talisman ghosts dare not behold\"—this is what it means. The moon’s radiant essence is gathered into the palace of divine water, and the sacred tortoise drinks it, becoming as pure and clear as jade, crystalline as formed ice. Yin powder arises within the northern pole, hence its likeness to the tortoise. Yang cinnabar is congealed from the sun’s essence, thus belonging to yang; its red hue likewise mirrors the sun. The color of yin powder is congealed from the moon’s radiance, thus belonging to yin; its blue-green hue mirrors the moon. When bone and flesh are wholly exchanged, the embryo’s interior transforms—muscle, bone, skin, and flesh all dissolve, entirely becoming immortal substance. The hun transforms to merge with spirit, the po transforms to merge with qi, all becoming cool and clear. Within the unified body, form and spirit are both wondrous, uniting with the Dao in truth. Those who study the Dao may preserve their spirit but cannot exchange their form, burdened by the body—thus when the spirit departs, the body cannot move; when the corpse remains, the form cannot be forgotten. Upon completing the six revolutions of the elixir, one exchanges the mortal form for immortal substance, where form and spirit are both wondrous. Wherever the spirit directs, the body follows, ascending to the nine heavens with the swiftness of clouds and stars.\n\nOral Instructions:\nUpon completing the six revolutions of the elixir, gather the moon’s radiance. At each full moon’s fifteenth night, at the midnight hour of *zi*, wash and rinse, then sit facing the moon. Close the breath and seal the mouth, cutting off the flow of respiration, ensuring true qi does not leak outward while the inner true qi fills the six palaces. The kidney’s true yin and the great yang’s essence—internal and external true qi—gleam like crystal, limpid and luminous. After one or two moments, the kidney’s true water stirs the heart’s fire, and the heart spirit rests within the lapis lazuli dish. Then gently open the eyes, release the breath through the nose, and facing the moon, inhale the moon’s qi into the cinnabar field, drawing eighty-one breaths before stopping. After half the breaths are drawn, the moon’s radiant true yin excites the true fire within the cinnabar field; water and fire harmonize like boiling water, the four limbs perspire, and the hundred vessels flow freely—ceasing at eighty-one breaths. Practicing thus for three years completes the work, advancing the achievement to the seventh revolution.\n\nSeventh Revolution:\nIn the seventh revolution, the body flies, the four limbs light,\nDivine radiance seals the breath, filling the cinnabar city.\nAfter a thousand mornings of grain abstention, fire naturally arises,\nThe *kun*-gate opens and closes, bathing the sea whale.\n\nExplanation: Upon completing the six revolutions of the elixir, yin and yang within and without are both fulfilled; mortal bones are exchanged for immortal bones, mortal flesh for immortal flesh. The four limbs and hundred bones harbor no mortal substance—the immortal body is light and pure, flight arising naturally. The inner elixir has refined the divine skeleton, thus the entire body is transformed. In the seventh revolution of the elixir, yin and yang within and without harmonize; one should seal the breath for ten mornings to fulfill the wondrous Dao’s function. Upon completing the seventh revolution, sealing the breath for a thousand mornings harmonizes yin and yang to perfection. When the thousand days are complete, spirit and qi unite, the five viscera are renewed, internal and external become pure and unified, the elixir’s radiance shines through the six palaces, and true fire illuminates the five interiors. The worms within the viscera and bowels transform into water; henceforth, the intestines and stomach are replete, free from the taint of smoke and fire, no longer consuming cooked food. One hungers for immortal fruits, thirsts for jade nectar, becoming unlike the worldly. After the inner elixir wholly transforms, the yin stem withers away, leaving but one aperture, called the *kun*-gate, symbolizing yin. Whenever the divine elixir’s fire flourishes, on the days of the three nines, one immerses the body in water, circulating the elixir pearl to emerge from the *kun*-gate, inhaling and exhaling to play in the water with freedom. After one or two hours, one returns the elixir to its chamber to temper the fire’s vigor.\n\n*Wang Jiang Nan*\nThe form penetrates the sun,\nIn the seventh revolution, soaring at will.\n\nSecluded in the depths of silent cliffs, one sits in tranquil repose, breath stilled without ebb or flow, qi firm and congealed. Grain is relinquished—such is its power. The fire of life refines, returning to the root, qi clarified and limpid.\n\nWhen bathing at the ninefold junctures, the earth-gate opens; from the moon one draws fire, from the sun seeks ice. The five viscera are renewed anew.\n\n*Exegesis:*\nAfter the seven revolutions, form and spirit attain perfection, the inner palace wholly transmuted into immortal vessels. Roaming at midday, the body becomes luminous, its hue like crimson jade, soaring and ascending through space, moving freely at will. In essence, one must harmonize inner and outer, allowing the radiance of sun and moon to converge in the heart and kidneys, water and fire, yin and yang interpenetrating, spirit and qi uniting in harmony. One retreats deep into mountain valleys, sitting in repose for hundreds of days, sealing the nostrils to sever the breath, so that primal harmony congeals and settles. Then the inner self is replete, no longer consuming the dust of the mortal world, thereby realizing the Dao of carefree wandering.\n\nAs for the relinquishing of grain and abstention from food—this is a wondrous art and extraordinary Dao. With breath sealed for a thousand days, the divine fire stirs within, scouring away the qi of grain, eradicating all craving for food. Returning to the root and restoring the origin, embracing the One and guarding stillness, hence it is said: \"returning, qi is clarified and limpid.\"\n\nWhenever the divine fire stirs, the five viscera grow hot; one then enters water on the days of the three nines to purify the true elixir. Resplendent as a wheel of fire, it emerges from the earth-gate—hence it is said: \"the earth-gate opens.\" The moon is the emblem of yin; the divine fire is a thing of utmost yang. The gate is the yin aperture, through which yang light passes, issuing from the yin cavern of the earth-gate—hence it is said: \"from the moon one draws fire.\" The sun is the emblem of yang; the divine water is a thing of utmost clarity. The tongue is the yang aperture, through which the divine water flows, issuing from the yang cavern of the tongue’s orifice—hence it is said: \"from the sun seeks ice.\"\n\nAt the fifth revolution, the bones are transformed; at the sixth, the flesh; at the seventh, the five viscera. The five viscera are the five sacred peaks—hence it is said: \"the five viscera are renewed anew.\"\n\n*Oral Instructions:*\nWhen the elixir reaches the seventh revolution, one must depart the mortal world and enter the depths of mountains or the seclusion of cliffs and valleys. Sitting in repose, sealing the breath, one severs the spirit, mouth, and nostrils from the ebb and flow of respiration, allowing true yin and true yang to merge within the abdomen, seizing the creative power of heaven and earth and returning it to the four limbs. After a thousand days, the five viscera are wholly transformed, the fetal qi transmuted into an immortal palace. One then senses the aperture at the crown of the head opening, emitting black and crimson qi—this is the dispersal of fetal qi. When the thousand days are complete, the aperture at the crown closes—this signifies the full expulsion of fetal qi and the fulfillment of the seventh revolution.\n\nThereafter, the five viscera become solid and impervious, no longer accepting the taint of smoke and fire. Should the elixir fire within the viscera flare, one enters water, seals the nostrils, and allows the elixir pearl and divine fire to emerge from the earth-gate, floating upon the water’s surface like a cow playing with yellow. Only when the divine water beneath the tongue flows like a spring does the elixir fire subside. One then draws the elixir pearl back into the earth-gate, continuing until the eighth revolution and the completion of the earthen belt, after which the fire’s toxicity ceases and bathing is no longer required.\n\n*The Eighth Revolution*\nAt the eighth revolution, the earthen belt hangs low, returning to the origin;\nCirculating fetal breath, one nurtures the infant.\n*(Partial lacuna)*\nAt times, fire flares, scorching the elixir chamber;\nPlunging deep into icy springs, one plays with the crimson turtle.\n\n*Exegesis:*\nWhen the infant lies within the mother’s womb, enveloped in the fetal sac, its qi is settled and cannot enter or exit, thus suffering no harm. If the infant’s navel connects to an umbilical cord, held in its mouth, the breath flows ceaselessly—this is the natural fetal breath, hence no harm befalls it. After the elixir reaches the eighth revolution, an umbilical cord-like belt forms at the navel, resembling the infant’s state, returning to the Dao of its original beginning—hence it is said: \"the earthen belt hangs low, returning to the origin.\"\n\nThe infant, possessing the umbilical cord, practices fetal breathing and suffers no harm; the perfected one, possessing the earthen belt, circulates the qi of the celestial revolution and thus attains longevity. The crimson turtle is the elixir pearl. After the eighth revolution, one refines the true fire within, eliminating its heat and toxicity. Whenever fire flares, one grasps the earthen belt and seals the breath for nine days. On the ninth day, true water surges from the elixir field like a gushing spring, rising to the twelve-storied tower. The elixir pearl plays within this divine water like a turtle frolicking in the waves. Thereafter, the true fire is free of toxicity, and the elixir’s heat no longer stirs—hence it is said: \"At times, fire flares, scorching the elixir chamber; plunging deep into icy springs, one plays with the crimson turtle.\"\n\n*Wang Jiang Nan*\nTransformed within and without,\nThe eighth revolution begins the return to the origin.\n\nThe earthen belt hangs long, presiding over the Kan Gate;\nCircling the embryo-breath, it pierces the Celestial Gate.\nHere the Dao of the Great Beginning abides.\nA body of pure unity,\nCrimson and black qi ever spout forth.\n\nWhen the cinnabar fire flares, it scorches the inner landscape;\nWhere the tinkling spring surges, the monkey-children bathe.\nThe divine water swallows the crimson turtle.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen the elixir reaches the eighth revolution, the outer form and the five viscera within are wholly transformed, and the earthen belt regenerates like that of an infant—hence it is said: \"returning to the origin and restoring the root.\" The earthen belt lies below the navel, born from the navel’s center, belonging to the northern Kan trigram—thus called the Kan Gate, the aperture of the Celestial Pool. The earthen belt connects to the mouth, circulating the breath of the celestial cycle to regulate the fire’s timing—hence called the \"circulating breath.\" The Dao of the Great Beginning generates the inception of heaven and earth; when the elixir completes its eighth revolution, it resembles the primordial creation of heaven and earth. The inner elixir is pure yang, without a trace of yin qi—hence called \"a body of pure unity.\" Crimson and black are the qi of the spirit-fire; when the elixir completes its eighth revolution, it arises from the heart and constantly enters and exits through the nose, where one perpetually sees the two qi of crimson and black—hence it is said: \"qi ever spout forth.\" The breath of the cinnabar fire moves the divine water to restrain it, and thereafter, the cinnabar fire’s timing no longer arises. Now, the elixir is the heart-pearl, the household of the heart, the monkey-children. The crimson turtle is the fire-spirit. When the elixir floats upon the water, it resembles a turtle swallowing water—this describes its form.\n\nOral Instructions:\nWhen the elixir completes its eighth revolution, the earthen belt is born within the navel. If the cinnabar fire still flares with heat, causing the five viscera to burn and parch, one should close the eyes and sit in repose, connecting the earthen belt to the aperture below the Celestial Pool, allowing the breath to flow inward and circulate throughout. After closing the breath, the true water of the elixir field gradually grows day by day. By the ninth day, the divine water rises to the twelve-storied tower, and the elixir pearl conceals itself within the divine water, expelling the fire’s toxicity. Thereafter, there is no further affliction of flaring heat. At the midnight hour of the ninth night, close the breath and draw in the divine water, passing it from the Mud Pill Palace through the spinal bridge back to the elixir field, thus completing the work.\n\nWhen the ninth revolution’s work is done:\nThe nine revolutions’ carefree Dao-fruit is complete;\nThree thousand merits and deeds make one a divine immortal.\nGolden script and jade tablets proclaim the imperial decree,\nTreading auspicious clouds to pay homage at the Nine Heavens.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen the elixir completes its ninth revolution, the transformation is perfected, and the Dao-fruit is rounded. Having further accumulated three thousand external merits, the external fruit is also fulfilled—only then may one ascend. Thus, after Master Xu Jingyang refined his elixir, he eradicated the harm of flood dragons before ascending; after Sun Simiao refined his elixir, he saved the myriad people from illness before ascending. All must establish merit and achieve renown before ascending. On the day of ascension, celestial music arrives in welcome, flutes and zithers harmonize, passing through the Celestial Pass. According to one’s merits and deeds, one is ranked among the immortal hosts, enduring as long as heaven and earth.\n\n*Collected Writings on Cultivating the True: Shortcuts, Scroll Seventeen* concludes.\n*Collected Writings on Cultivating the True: Shortcuts, Scroll Eighteen* begins.\n\n**Song of the Corporeal Shell**\n*Composed by Yanluozi*\n\nThis wretched shell I now reproach—\nall for past loves of wayward paths.\nThe Three Corpses and karmic ghosts conspire,\nthis body and heart slip from my grasp.\nThe Six Bandits stir chaos all day long,\nsight of beauty or wealth—life gambled away.\nUnseen, karma coils round this frame,\nparading before others as a saintly show.\nBoasting schemes and cunning hands,\nwealth amassed through ceaseless toil.\nRich as Wang Kai or Shi Chong,\nyet after death, alone you tread the dark springs.\nFond of foul stench and filth,\nthis body whittled down like carved wood.\nMouth ever claiming the upper hand—\nfool, you play the ignorant oaf.\nOaf, lend ear a moment:\nendless barren fields piled with tombs.\nAlas!

These two passages, though distinct, lie close together—the larynx in front, the pharynx behind. The larynx governs the intake and expulsion of breath, while the pharynx merely swallows. The character for \"larynx\" (喉) derives from \"marquis\" (侯), for what exits from within is conveyed outward through the larynx, and what enters from without is conveyed inward through it. What we call exhalation follows the Yang as it departs; inhalation follows the Yin as it enters. The pharynx, however, only swallows when there is something to swallow, hence the character for \"pharynx\" (咽) includes the element \"cause\" (因). The pharynx corresponds to Earth-qi and serves as the conduit of the stomach, connecting downward to the gastric cavity as the passage for water and grain. From the pharyngeal gate, food enters the stomach, making the pharynx a critical juncture, also called the \"mute gate.\"\n\nThe larynx corresponds to Heaven-qi and serves as the conduit of the lungs, linking downward to the lung meridian as the pathway for respiration. From the laryngeal passage, breath reaches the lungs. The lungs have no lower orifice but are hollow within, distributing the clear and turbid qi through the trachea. Below the lungs lies the heart, and beneath the heart, the diaphragm adheres to the spine, encircling and shielding the heart and lungs from the upward fumigation of turbid qi—this is what is called the \"chest center\" (膻中). Below the diaphragm lie the spleen, stomach, liver, and gallbladder.\n\nThe spleen, associated with Earth, rests above the stomach, connected to it by membranes, thus supporting the stomach. The liver, associated with Wood, responds to the exhalation of Yin before it retreats, hence its governance is on the left, though its position is on the right. Below the stomach lies the small intestine, to the right of which is the large intestine, and beside the large intestine, the bladder.\n\nThe small intestine is the \"official of reception and transformation,\" where essence is extracted. All the fermented and ripened water and grain in the stomach—its qi ascends from the stomach’s upper opening, the \"cardiac orifice\" (贲门), to the lungs, where it is distributed throughout the body. Its waste and turbidity descend from the stomach’s lower opening, the \"pyloric orifice\" (幽门), into the small intestine. From the small intestine’s lower opening, the \"ileocecal valve\" (阑门), the water is separated and enters the bladder, while the waste proceeds into the large intestine. The large intestine, with its four bends, receives the grain from the small intestine—it is the \"official of transmission.\"\n\nThe bladder, also called the \"bladder sac\" (胞), is hollow to receive water and serves as the repository of fluids. Thus, it is said: the bladder is the chamber of the bladder sac. When the bladder’s function is impaired, it causes strangury; when its restraint fails, it leads to enuresis.\n\nHearts vary—some are large, some crooked, some straight, some with orifices, some without—no two are alike. The true heart is not susceptible to evil; when affliction arises, it is the heart’s envelope (心包) that is affected—this is what is called the \"Hand Reverting Yin\" (手心主). It lies above the transverse membrane beneath the heart and below the firm membrane, adhering to the transverse membrane. The yellow fat that envelops it is the true heart. Beyond this fatty layer, fine membranous threads like silk connect to the heart and lungs—this is the pericardium.\n\nLivers may have one lobe, two lobes, or three lobes. The kidneys are two, the dwelling place of essence. They govern the primordial qi (元气), shaped like paired kidney beans curving along the spine. Externally, they are wrapped in fat—white on the outside, purple within—with two threads ascending to the heart and descending to the kidneys, forming a single circuit. This is what is meant by \"Kan in the north, Li in the south, water and fire interacting.\"\n\nThough the kidneys are two, one is called the \"Gate of Life\" (命门), opposite the navel. The *Huangting Jing* states: \"The two water sovereigns face the Gate of Life,\" and also: \"Behind lies the secret gate, before lies the Gate of Life.\" The Gate of Life is the navel. When an infant is in the womb, it draws qi through the umbilical cord—when the mother exhales, the infant exhales; when the mother inhales, the infant inhales—directly opposite the secret gate. Such is the nature of the navel, and it does not differ from the *Yanluozi Illustrations*.\n\nIn recent times, when criminals were executed in the marketplace and dissected, some claimed there were three passages in the throat—one for water, one for food, and one for qi—this is a grave error. Others asserted that one kidney lies slightly below the liver’s right side, and the other slightly above the spleen’s left side, thereby dismissing the *Yanluozi’s Illustration of Morning Audience with the True*. How could they know that when the Foot Reverting Yin (足厥阴) is afflicted, the tongue curls and the testicles retract—let alone the terror of the blade and saw?\n\n**Yanluozi’s Scripture of Inner Observation**\nHeaven and Earth unite their essences, and the myriad things are transformed and born. When father and mother join, a person comes into being. In the first month, it is a blastocyst; in the second, an embryo; in the third, the soul forms; in the fourth, the corporeal soul forms; in the fifth, the organs divide; in the sixth, the bowels divide; in the seventh, the orifices open; in the eighth, the spirit is complete; in the ninth, the essence is fixed; in the tenth, the qi is full.\n\nAt birth, the spirit’s source is pure and untainted. Once it inhabits form, the form is stained by the six emotions: the eyes covet color, the ears cling to sound, the mouth indulges in flavor, the nose receives fragrance, the mind harbors envy, and the body desires plumpness and lightness. From this, one drifts and wanders, unable to awaken. The sages, in their compassion, teach one to inwardly observe the self and settle the heart. When the heart is settled, the spirit is still; no chaotic thoughts intrude, no evil delusions assail, and all worries and afflictions dissolve. The empty chamber generates brightness—this depends solely on settling the heart.\n\n**Oral Formula for Guarding the Nine Palaces**\nThe head has nine palaces, corresponding above to the nine heavens and below to the nine earths. The body has nine orifices and twelve towers. Between the two eyebrows, one *cun* inward, lies the Palace of the Bright Hall (明堂宫), where the Lord of the Great One (太乙君) resides. To the left is the Purple Chamber, to the right the Vermilion Gate, clad in brocade and appearing like an infant—this is the master of the body’s form.\n\nTwo *cun* inward lies the Palace of the Grotto Chamber (洞房宫), where three perfected ones dwell: on the left, the Peerless One (无英); on the right, the White Prime (白元); and in the center, the Yellow Cloud. Three *cun* inward lies the Palace of the Cinnabar Field (丹田宫); four *cun* inward, the Palace of the Flowing Pearl (流珠宫); five *cun* inward, the Palace of the Jade Emperor (玉帝宫).\n\nOne *cun* above the Bright Hall lies the Palace of the Heavenly Court (天庭宫); one *cun* above the Grotto Chamber, the Palace of the Utmost Perfected (极真宫); one *cun* above the Cinnabar Field, the Palace of the Mysterious Cinnabar (玄丹宫); one *cun* above the Flowing Pearl, the Palace of the Heavenly Sovereign (天皇宫).\n\n**Treatise on the Three Cinnabar Fields and Three Elixir Fields**\nWithin qi, spirit is born; the spirit resides in the Upper Elixir Field...\n\nWithin essence, qi is born; qi resides in the Middle Elixir Field. True Water and true qi merge to form essence, which dwells in the Lower Elixir Field. The Upper Field is the abode of spirit, the Middle Field the palace of qi, and the Lower Field the domain of essence.\n\n**Treatise on Outer and Inner Elixirs**\nQi mirrors heaven and earth, transforming through yin and yang. The yang dragon and yin tiger, Wood’s liquid and Metal’s essence—when these two qi unite, it is called the Outer Elixir. Embracing harmony, refining and storing, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, ascending to the Mud Pill Palace, descending to the Cinnabar Field, and converging at the Crimson Palace—this is called the Inner Elixir. The Inner Elixir can prolong life, while the Outer Elixir can ascend one to the heavens; those who study the Dao should strive for these.\n\n**Comprehensive Treatise on the Heart**\nSpirit resides in the heart as the sovereign, also known as the Crimson Palace, the Spirit Terrace, or the Middle Elixir Field. It pertains to Fire, the essence of Great Yang, corresponding above to Mars, flourishing in summer. Its color is red, its direction south (bing-ding), its symbol the Vermilion Bird, its Dao virtue propriety, and its trigram Li. Its form resembles an unopened three-petaled lotus. Internally, it manifests as the pulse; externally, as complexion. The mouth and tongue serve as its gates, the small intestine as its palace. It is subdued by the kidney and mobilized by the lung. When supported by the liver, it thrives; when encountered by the spleen, it wanes. As the ruler of the five viscera, it repels evil when balanced. Yet excessive salt harms the heart—one must be cautious.\n\n**Comprehensive Treatise on the Liver**\nThe ethereal soul resides in the liver, which serves as the minister. It pertains to Wood, flourishing in spring. Its color is green, its direction east (jia-yi), its symbol the Azure Dragon, its Dao virtue benevolence, and its trigram Zhen. Its form has seven lobes. The gallbladder, the general, lies within the fourth lobe on the liver’s left. Internally, it manifests as sinews; externally, as nails. The eyes serve as its gates, the gallbladder as its palace. It is subdued by the lung and mobilized by the spleen. When supported by the kidney, it thrives; when encountered by the heart, it wanes. Yet excessive pungent flavors harm the liver—one must abstain.\n\n**Comprehensive Treatise on the Spleen**\nThe will resides in the spleen, which governs the body. It pertains to Earth, flourishing in all seasons. Its color is yellow, its direction the center, its Dao virtue sincerity, and its form resembles a knife’s edge. Internally, it manifests as the viscera, nourishing the heart, kidney, liver, and lung; externally, as flesh. The lips and teeth serve as its gates. It is subdued by the liver and mobilized by the kidney. When supported by the heart, it thrives; when encountered by the lung, it wanes. It favors sweetness and warmth, with the stomach spirit attached to it. It fears cold and dislikes chill; when harmonized, it aids digestion and ensures bodily peace, but otherwise, illness arises. Excessive sour flavors harm the spleen—one must be mindful.\n\n**Comprehensive Treatise on the Lung**\nThe corporeal soul resides in the lung, which serves as the minister of state. It pertains to Metal, flourishing in autumn. Its color is white, its direction west (geng-xin), its symbol the White Tiger, its Dao virtue righteousness, and its trigram Dui. Its form resembles a canopy. Internally, it manifests as skin; externally, as body hair. The nose serves as its gate, the large intestine as its palace. It is subdued by the heart and mobilized by the liver. When supported by the spleen, it thrives; when encountered by the kidney, it wanes. It fears chill, which causes coughing, and excessive bitter flavors harm the lung.\n\n**Comprehensive Treatise on the Kidney**\nEssence resides in the kidney, also called the Dark Flower. It pertains to Water, flourishing in winter. Its color is black, its direction north (ren-gui), its symbol the Dark Warrior, its Dao virtue wisdom, and its trigram Kan. It has two pairs: on the left, the Fierce Maiden, and on the right, the Gate of Life, from which the birth cord extends into the Mud Pill Palace. Internally, it manifests as bones; externally, as hair. The ears serve as its gates, the bladder as its palace. It is subdued by the spleen and mobilized by the heart. When supported by the lung, it thrives; when encountered by the liver, it wanes. Excessive sweet flavors harm the kidney.\n\n**The Mud Pill Palace**\nThe Mud Pill is called the Valley Spirit, also known as the Lower Dark Palace. The Celestial Brain is the origin of the body and the gathering place of the hundred spirits.\n\n**The Three Elixir Fields**\nThe space between the eyebrows is the Upper Elixir Field; the heart is the Middle Elixir Field; three *cun* below the navel is the Lower Elixir Field.\n\n**The Three Burners**\nThe Yongquan point lies at the center of the sole. From the heart upward to the Mud Pill Palace is the Upper Burner. From the heart downward to the navel is the Middle Burner. From the navel to the Yongquan is the Lower Burner.\n\n**Method for Controlling the Three Ethereal Souls**\nOn the third, thirteenth, and twenty-third days of each lunar month, the ethereal souls depart the body to report to the celestial bureaus on one’s good deeds. On these nights, before retiring, knock the teeth together three times and call their names:\n*\"Scorching Radiance, Enhance Fortune; Womb Light, Prolong Life; Hidden Essence, Repel Death.\"*\n*\"By the command of the Most High Lord Lao, swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!\"*\nRegularly practicing this ensures longevity.\n\n**Method for Controlling the Seven Corporeal Souls**\nOn the new moon, full moon, and final day of each lunar month, the corporeal souls depart the body to report one’s misdeeds to heaven. On these nights, before retiring, knock the teeth together and call their names to absolve transgressions:\n*\"Corpse Hound, Crouching Arrow, Sparrow Shade, Swarming Poison, Ravenous Thief, Expunger of Filth, Fetid Lung!\"*\n\n**Talisman for Controlling the Three Worms**\nThe spirit-names are Peng Shan, who delights in carriages, horses, and fine robes; Peng Zhi, who delights in wine; and Peng Jiao, who delights in lust. These spirits share one’s lifespan and incite the Three Defilements, hastening one’s demise. On the final and first days of each lunar month, they ascend to heaven to make their reports. If one can master them, longevity is immediately attained.\n\nHere follows the *Talisman of Mount Taibai for Controlling the Three Worms and Nine Parasites*:\n*Upper Worm Talisman, Middle Worm Talisman, Lower Worm Talisman*\nOn every Gengshen night, inscribe and ingest this talisman—the Three Worms and Nine Parasites will naturally perish, calming the ethereal and corporeal souls. It is most auspicious to call their names in quietude during the night.\n\nOn all Jiazi and Gengshen days, strictly avoid conjugal union and gluttony; maintain purity, and the Three Worms will self-destruct.\n\n*Collected Writings on Cultivating the Dao: Shortcuts, Scroll 18 Concluded*\n*Collected Writings on Cultivating the Dao: Shortcuts, Scroll 19*\n\n**Zhongli’s Eight Brocade

not be far off.\n\nClap the teeth thirty-six times to gather the spirit,\nEmbrace Kunlun with both hands,\nStrike the Heavenly Drum twenty-four times with both hands.\n\n**Second Section**\nShake the Heavenly Pillar left and right, twenty-four times each.\n\n**Third Section**\nStir the upper palate with the tongue thirty-six times to the left and right,\nRinse thirty-six times,\nDivide into three mouthfuls and swallow as if it were a solid substance,\nOnly then may the fire be activated.\n\n**Fourth Section**\nRub the Kidney Hall thirty-six times with both hands—more repetitions are even better.\n\n**Fifth Section**\nSingle Gate *Huaigu* left and right, thirty-six times each.\n\n**Sixth Section**\nDouble Gate *Shuailu* thirty-six times.\n\n**Seventh Section**\nRub both hands together, then exhale with five *he* breaths,\nFollow with hands pressing upward to the heavens and pressing down upon the crown,\nThree or nine times each.\n\n**Eighth Section**\nWith both hands hooked, reach forward to grasp the soles of the feet, twelve times,\nThen withdraw the feet and sit upright.\n\n**Six-Character Method for Dispelling Illness and Prolonging Life**\nThis method involves exhaling through the mouth and inhaling through the nose.\n\n**General Formula**\nWhen *xu* for the liver, the eyes brighten with essence,\nWhen *si* for the lungs, both hands rise with the qi.\nWhen *he* for the heart, hands interlock above the crown,\nWhen *chui* for the kidneys, embrace the knees level.\nWhen *hu* for the spleen, purse the lips,\nWhen *xi* for the Triple Burner, expel heat with a sigh.\n\n**Blowing Qi for the Kidneys**\nThe kidneys govern water diseases and the Gate of Life,\nWhen ill, one becomes emaciated, the complexion dull.\nFrowning, ringing ears, dark and gaunt—\nBlow away the perverse, and it flees at once.\n\n**Exhaling Qi for the Heart**\nWhen the heart’s source is vexed and restless, hasten to *he*,\nNo method surpasses this in divine efficacy.\nSores in the throat, mouth ulcers, heat and pain—\nFollow this, and peace comes swiftly.\n\n**Hissing Qi for the Liver**\nThe liver governs the Dragon’s Path, its position the heart,\nWhen illness comes, one feels sour and bitter.\nRed eyes and excessive tears—\nHiss, and the ailment vanishes like magic.\n\n**Sipping Qi for the Lungs**\nFrequent *si* generates saliva,\nRelieving chest fullness and upper burner phlegm.\nIf lung disease arises, hasten to *si*—\nUse it, and peace comes at once.\n\n**Exhaling Qi for the Spleen**\nThe spleen pertains to earth, called the Great Granary,\nWith phlegm, no remedy is complete.\nDiarrhea, borborygmus, vomiting water—\nHasten to regulate with *hu*, and the elixir forms.\n\n**Sighing for the Triple Burner**\nWhen the Triple Burner is afflicted, hasten to *xi*,\nThe ancient sages left this as the supreme medicine.\nIf you know how to clear blockages,\nWhat other method could compare?\n\n**Sun Zhenren’s Seasonal Practice Song for Nourishing Life**\nIn spring, *xu* brightens the eyes and supports the liver,\nBy summer solstice, *he* calms the heart’s fire.\nIn autumn, *si* stabilizes and moistens the metal lungs,\nFor the kidneys, *chui* secures the Kan’s peace.\n*Xi* for the Triple Burner dispels vexing heat,\nIn all seasons, *hu* for the spleen transforms food.\nBeware of letting the sound reach mouth or ears—\nIts merit surpasses even the elixir of spirit.\n\n*Collected Writings on the Shortcuts of Cultivating the Dao, Volume Nineteen of the Ten Books on Cultivating the Dao—Concluded*\n*Collected Writings on the Shortcuts of Cultivating the Dao,

through.\nTo test if the six palaces gather qi,\nObserve the flush upon both cheeks.\n\n2\nThe Five Phases hold true transformation,\nCircling in mutual conquest and generation.\nA yellow cloud veils the crucible—\nWithin, the golden elixir is complete.\n\n3\nSit in stillness, quiet thoughts and curb desires,\nCalm the mind to nurture qi and preserve spirit.\nThis is the essential secret of cultivating the Dao—\nLet scholars inscribe it upon their sashes.\n\n4\nSitting in meditation is like forging iron,\nDemanding unbroken effort day and night.\nHow much better to let it flow freely,\nSo the pulse courses through the body.\n\n5\nThe lofty \"Thousand Mouths Water Method,\"\nLü’s \"Eight Pieces of Brocade,\"\nAnd the Six-Character Qi Formula—\nAll are gates to peace and ease.\n\n6\nThe nose, blocked by the five fragrances,\nThe eyes, blinded by the five colors.\nThis is the separation of metal and wood,\nWhere yin’s po severs yang’s hun.\n\n7\nNurture qi as you would a child,\nSever desire as you would creeping weeds.\nWhen the seven passions do not arise in *ding-jia*,\nThe pure and effortless is the Dao.\n\n8\nWithin the body burns the samadhi fire,\nTended well, it strengthens and grants long life.\nRestrain its scattering, prevent its flaring upward—\nOnly then will ears and eyes grow keen.\n\n9\nThough the body be wrapped in black,\nWhy not dwell in ease and transcendence?\nBodhidharma attained the fetal breath method,\nThus he could face the wall for nine years.\n\n10\nTrue qi never leaves the cinnabar crucible,\nPrimal harmony ever fills the Jade Pool.\n\n11\nIn eating and drinking, moderation is essential—\nNever starve when hungry, nor overeat when full.\n\n12\nAfter meals, walk a hundred paces,\nMassaging the belly with both hands.\nAt midnight and the fifth watch, upon waking,\nExpel the turbid blackness from the five viscera.\n\n13\nWhen the two fluids wither, the eyes grow dim;\nWhen brain qi leaks, the ears turn deaf.\nThe wise harmonize the five viscera,\nSo the triple burner and six bowels flow freely.\n\n14\nWhen sitting outside, close the earthly gate,\nIn ascent and descent, restrain the yang pass.\nSeize the true dragon and true tiger—\nNaturally, the nine-fold cyclical elixir forms.\n\n15\nBy day, absorb the sun’s essence and refine it;\nAt night, take in the moon’s radiance.\nWhen true fire and true water merge in harmony,\nThe yellow sprout will spontaneously grow.\n\n16\nThe Dao is not apart from the heart—\nAll wonders gather in the one true.\nTo age without dying is to be an immortal;\nTo die without illness is to be a mortal.\n\n17\nLearning the Dao is no difficult task,\nYet the human heart lacks steadfastness.\nAt first, refining brings bitterness and toil,\nBut achievement comes in just a year or two.\n\n18\nFollow the monthly changes of the *Yi*’s hexagrams,\nWhere yin and yang wax and wane through the six lines.\nThis method is not the simplest—\nThe celestial truth holds another realm of freedom.\n\nThree things must be avoided in cultivation:\nRage, excessive desire, and drunkenness.\nShould any one of these arise,\nTrue qi is instantly lost.\n\n19\nWhat makes a Buddha a Buddha,\nWhat makes an immortal an immortal,\nIs nothing but establishing sincerity—\nDiligently study the *Doctrine of the Mean*.\n\n20\nFrom *yin* to *shen* is the sevenfold return;\nFrom *mao* to *kun* is the ninefold restoration.\nIn small terms, this is a single day;\nIn great terms, this is a full year.\n\n21\nAbide in darkness, harmonizing a thousand breaths;\nAscend the body, piercing the three barriers.\nWhen form and spirit are both refined to wonder,\nYou will know the golden field is full of fire.\n\n22\nDo not forcefully swallow saliva or circulate qi,\nFor this only brings self-inflicted toil and strain.\nThere is already a crimson tower, a jeweled pagoda—\nFive clouds weave together the yellow court.\n\n23\nThe spiritual root holds yin and yang marrow;\nHarmonized, they enter the crucible for refinement.\nGhee ascends to the vermilion palace,\nWhile surging qi descends to the bubbling spring.\n\n24\nIn subtlety, forget the four images;\nIn penetration, why ask of the five phases?\nTo embrace the origin and guard the one,\nNaturally, jade chimes and golden tones resound.\n\n25\nAt times, the celestial drum is heard in the void;\nThe primordial pearl ever shines in the deep abyss.\nWhite snow is refined into crimson water,\nAnd the fire dragon plows the field of mushrooms.\n\n26\nThe supreme Dao is not bound by *zi* or *wu*;\nThe effortless Way asks not of dawn or dusk.\nIf you seek the three flowers to gather at the crown,\nFirst let the five qi return to the origin.\n\n27\nEmerging from the azure, entering the profound—how radiant!\nAll returns to the gate of the mysterious female.\nIf you truly desire long life without death,\nI urge you to cultivate Kunlun.\n\n28\nLet the spirit terrace hold no single thing;\nGather the spirit back into the spirit.\nBefore the twelve towers, spring waters flow—\nThe red dragon’s snowy waves grind the void.\n\n29\nHow could the numinous being ever fall ill?\nThe nine orifices and hundred bones are naturally at peace.\nIf illness arises, no medicine is needed—\nSimply turn inward and contemplate.\n\n30\nThe wondrous work circulates without cease;\nWhy rely on the river chariot for transport?\nThe elixir’s spark is ever present—\nNaturally, cinnabar forms in the golden crucible.\n\n31\nTo study the Dao, one must accumulate hidden virtue;\nOtherwise, obstacles and demons will arise.\nIf you have planted roots in past lives,\nYou will naturally harmonize with fortune’s power.\n\n32\nGuangcheng lived twelve hundred years,\nPreserving the one and abiding in harmony.\nYesterday, there was an infant boy and a maiden girl—\nTheir union must be aided by the yellow matron.\n\n33\nUntil all beings attain Buddhahood,\nDo not grasp at this clod of earth.\nThis Dao, though diverse in paths, is one in essence—\nLaozi is none other than Gautama.\n\n34\nThe Tathāgata’s teaching is all-pervading;\nWith a tranquil mind, observe the whiteness at the tip of the nose.\nWhen the message of body and mind becomes inwardly luminous,\nThis is the foremost in perfect penetration.\n\n35\nForget the feet, forget the waist, forget the heart—\nThe one nature is serene and ever still.\nYan Hui could forget what was to be forgotten,\nThus he could attain his proper state.\n\n36\nA short life and death are not misfortune—\nIt is but the spirit’s journey beyond the shell.\nEven if one is heaven-endowed, a general or sage,\nOne must still yield to those who transcend.\n\n37\nZhongli’s *Lingbao Bifa*\nGuides true cultivation to transcendence.\nEarnestly and clearly, it instructs the learner—\nThe only hindrance is the inability to practice.\n\n38\nThe learner must seek a renowned teacher,\nYet such teachers are rare in the world.\nWhen the time for cultivation is ripe,\nImmortals will naturally come to aid.\n\n39\nChen Tuan’s spirit soared beyond his withered form,\nThough his worldly merits were not yet complete.\nAlone, he returned to Penglai’s clouds—\nOnly when the three thousand deeds are fulfilled can one ascend.\n\n40\nLearner, beware of excessive sleep,\nFor in dreams, all manner of demons may enter.\nIf you wish to preserve true essence,\nHook out the poisonous snake from your heart.\n\n41\nIn studying the Dao, do not be greedy for much—\nDiligently and sincerely guard the one.\nThe *Lingyuan Zhi* states:\nOnce attained, do not lose it in favorable times.\n\n42\nWhen you feel cold, first put on clothes;\nWhen you sense warmth, gradually shed them.\nSit away from dampness, thieves, and drafts;\nAvoid raw, cold, and hard foods.\n\n43\nPure yin without yang is called a ghost;\nPure yang without yin is called an immortal.\nLord Lü was named the Pure Yang Master—\nThus he achieved his celestial destiny.\n\n44\nThe great Dao is like walking the correct path;\nTo walk blindly is to enter many detours.\nGather your spirit and bring it to its abode—\nWithout emptiness, you cannot avoid stumbling.\n\n45\nBravery with cunning harbors scheming;\nOnly when settled can one respond.\nUse your will undivided to concentrate the spirit,\nFulfill your nature to reach the mandate.\n\n46\nTo comprehend principles, one must understand adaptability;\nWithout adaptability, clinging to the mean is futile.\nThe sage is cautious in what he affirms—\nWith adaptability, all methods become accessible.\n\n47\nDwelling in a humble alley, he did not alter his joy;\nUnperturbed all day, he seemed like a fool.\nDetached from form, transcendent, and self-forgotten—\nThis is the way of the immortal and the leaping Confucian.\n\n48\nThe learner must first clarify the true one;\nBegin by recognizing the root and origin.\nThe root is like the root of a tree;\nThe origin is like Kunlun’s peak.\n\n49\nWithin the yang dragon’s qi is true liquid;\nWithin the yin tiger’s liquid is true qi.\nWhen the two intermingle and harmonize,\nThey form the true embryo, the crimson child.\n\n50\nWithin two vessels, a single scene—\nPulling nine oxen up the mountain.\nAscend the peak to attain long life;\nLose your footing, and you wait at the gate.\n\n51\nThe metal wind blows the yang within *kan*—\nThis is the origin of the noisy Dao.\nThere was one who lived over two hundred years—\nTo this day, he practices this single phrase.\n\n52\n\nTo unite heaven, earth, and humanity is the Confucian way—\nYet one must also penetrate Buddhism and Daoism.\nMaster Lü was of the same fellowship,\nHaving read the *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* and awakened to the Dao.\n\n53\nTo perfect the adamantine seed of wisdom,\nThis sūtra’s secrets run profoundly deep.\nOf old, one grasped but a single phrase—\n“With no abiding, let the mind arise.”\n\n54\nLet the intent reside always in the cinnabar field,\nGently nurturing the lower origin.\nNo other action or contrivance is needed—\nLet it be, and let it follow nature.\n\n55\nThe learner must purify the three karmas,\nLike a tortoise withdrawing to guard the six senses.\nIn samādhi, when water and fire penetrate,\nBeyond the true, there is no true.\n\n56\nForm refines qi, qi refines spirit,\nThe Dao gathers in emptiness, emptiness births whiteness.\nAbove and below, heaven and earth flow as one,\nIts wondrous function pervades the four directions.\n\n57\nThe twelve jade towers extend the tiger,\nThe nine-tiered cinnabar palace holds the *geng* power.\nHeavenly light pierces Kunlun’s peak,\nThe formless enters the palace of water essence.\n\n58\nWithin purity, even “non-being” is absent;\nIn perfect enlightenment, even illusion ceases.\nTranscendent, the Dao arises and unites with the real—\nTo see one’s nature is to be Buddha.\n\n59\nThe father is the mud-pill palace, the mother the feminine one—\nTo guard the One is to complete ten thousand affairs.\nThe primordial radiance abides in suchness, unmoving;\nWhy labor with swallowing, rinsing, or breath?\n\n60\nThe Supreme’s Dao is simply the One,\nThe Tathāgata’s other two are not true.\nOnce you recognize the original face,\nThe fire of suffering is but this embodied self.\n\n61\nThe gate of the mysterious female is most secret,\nIts sacred key forges the embryo of creation.\nOnce you know it is not the mouth or nose,\nNobly and courageously, tread it open.\n\n62\n\nThe Crescent Moon Crucible is hardest to find,\nNoble ones of old have spoken of this.\nIt lies only within this mountain,\nYet deep in the clouds, its place remains unknown.\n\n63\nWith spirit concealed, roam beyond the four directions,\nAt ease, you become Heaven’s companion.\nBoast not of nine years’ great subtlety—\nAll comes in but a moment’s effort.\n\n64\nInner elixir must be refined with outer elixir,\nNeither can be neglected.\nOnce the elixir is formed, accumulate hidden merit—\nSuch a person will surely abide in the world.\n\n65\nIn sleep, the Jade Maiden divides the embryo;\nUpon rising, the turtle and fish sway their tails.\nWhen true breath settles and lengthens,\nThe mirror shines, unstained by dust.\n\n66\nOn Western Mountain lies the *Record of Meeting the Real*,\nDistinguishing dragon and tiger, yin and yang.\nFive senses, five supplements—subtle secrets,\nLet scholars ponder them carefully.\n\n67\nTo nourish yang with yang is still yang;\nTo admonish yang with yin is most difficult.\nOpen the Heavenly Gate and Earthly Door,\nBalance the spine, pierce the twin passes.\n\n68\nWhen the Dao is lofty, wealth and rank grow light;\nWhen the heart is pure, one may learn to be an immortal.\nVainly contending with others over pride—\nFree and at ease, nurture long life.\n\n69\nFocus the mind to accumulate essence and harmonize spirit,\nLet not thoughts and cares flutter restlessly.\nFrom emptiness and nothingness, the Dao naturally arises;\nIn true stillness, forever preserve long life.\n\n70\nThere is movement within non-movement,\nAnd action within non-action.\nWhen form is upright, appearance naturally aligns;\nWhen virtue is complete, the spirit remains unharmed.\n\n71\nThe supreme Dao is vast, admitting no sound,\nYet through form’s awakening, one silently comprehends.\nEntering the realm of neither death nor life,\nThrough endless kalpas, Heaven and Earth become one.\n\n72\nThe image is the image of no-image,\nThe body is the body of all things’ bodies.\nWhen it abides, the hundred bones all live;\nWhen it departs, the nine orifices all die.\n\n73\nHeaven and Earth, the ten thousand things—all are thieves,\nYet the sage discerns the mechanism of theft.\nHarm gives rise to kindness, kindness to harm—\nExamine this again and again to know what is fitting.\n\n74\nIn the loss of both grain and sheep,\nThe historian’s records and mason’s bricks alike lose their nature.\nConceal it within the traceless axis,\nRegulate it with the correctness of spontaneity.\n\n75\nDaily diminish, diminish again and again,\nDeepen, deepen ever more profoundly.\nWhen the numinous terrace is free of affairs, samādhi arises—\nBeware of wearying the body or startling the heart.\n\n76\nSober now, chastise past drunkenness;\nRight today, awaken to yesterday’s errors.\nMy life has its own nature and destiny—\nWho can discuss with me the true mechanism?\n\n77\nThe supreme Dao is dark and obscure,\nYet within obscurity, alone one sees the dawn.\nAll turn their backs on awakening, embracing dust—\nWho will turn the light inward in reflection?\n\n78\nFrom precepts and samādhi, wisdom is born;\nFrom small accomplishment, one enters great achievement.\nAwakening to the Great One, embrace true darkness—\nKnow the flying golden essence behind the elbow.\n\n79\nThe three officials ascend and descend,\nGathering the five blacks to return as one.\nThe Golden Crow captures the Jade Hare,\nThe tortoise-child transforms into the snake-child.\n\n80\nQian revolves leftward through its strength,\nKun turns rightward through its compliance.\nThe eight trigrams and nine nines cycle endlessly—\nWhen aspiration is full, the spirit’s radiance appears of itself.\n\n81\nI have heard that the wise do not speak,\nYet how can I claim true knowledge today?\nThough I speak on and on without cease,\nI merely point the way for seekers.\n\n*Miscellaneous Writings on Cultivating the Real: Shortcuts, Scroll Twenty* concludes.\n\n*Miscellaneous Writings on Cultivating the Real: Shortcuts, Scroll Twenty-One*\n*Master Dou of Mount Hua’s Guide to Cultivating the Real*\n\nThe Ignorant One asked the Recluse of Linwu:\nThough I know the Dao resides within emptiness and nothingness, I have not recognized the gate of emptiness and nothingness. Though I dwell within life and death, I have not discerned the gate of life and death. I wish to clarify this principle and offer guidance, that later learners may hear of it.\n\nThe Recluse replied:\nThose who seek emptiness and nothingness must turn their gaze inward; those who seek without go far from the Dao.\n\nI once recalled that long ago, the Five Noble Sons asked the Most High about the realm of emptiness and nothingness. The Most High said:\nThe realm of emptiness and nothingness has five aspects:\nThe city gate is the space between your five fingers;\nThe land of heavy burdens is your two feet;\nThe light courtyard’s chamber is your two knees;\nThe outer land of the boundless is your two cheeks;\nThe land of boundless spontaneity is your navel;\nThe chamber of Great Clarity and emptiness is your abdomen.\nThe Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior are your large and small intestines and stomach.\nThe east, Jia and Yi Wood, is your liver;\nThe south, Bing and Ding Fire, is your heart;\nThe west, Geng and Xin Metal, is your lungs;\nThe north, Ren and Gui Water, is your kidneys;\nThe center, Wu and Ji Earth, is your spleen.\nThe twelve lands are the twelve meridians of your two hands;\nThe nine-tiered terrace is your throat;\nThe Heavenly Lord sitting at the gate is your tongue;\nThe twenty-eight prime ministers are your teeth;\nThe sun and moon at either side are your two eyes;\nThe Heavenly Gate and Earthly Door are your two ears;\nThe space between the pine and wu-tung rivers is your eyebrows;\nAbove, the vast and broad slab of stone is your forehead.\nWhen the cultivator of the real contemplates the spirit and qi leaving the palace, this refers to the spirit within the body.\nThe three and five functionaries are the spirits of the three islands and five numinous palaces;\nThe five-body true officials are the spirits of the five bodies;\nThe five qi lords are the spirits of the five viscera;\nThe left and right palace attendants are your two feet;\nThe left and right incense-bearers are your two thumbs;\nThe jade maiden who transmits words is your little finger;\nThe five emperors’ direct talismans are your five fingers;\nThe thirty-six who emerge are the twenty-four qi spirits of the twelve palaces within the body;\nThe three qi true spirits are the spirit, qi, and form.\nThus, form is not at peace without spirit, does not move without qi, and qi does not stand without form.\nThe four seas:\nThe heart is the sea of blood,\nThe kidneys are the sea of qi,\nThe brain is the sea of marrow,\nThe spleen is the sea of the five grains.\nThe five lakes are the fluids of the five viscera, each governing their respective positions—east, west, south, north, and center.\nThe nine rivers are the nine bends of the small intestine.\nThe top is called the Upper Field,\nThe heart is called the Middle Field,\nThe kidneys are called the Lower Field—\nThese are the three islands.\n\nThe Inner Park is the root-source.\nThe Flowery Pond lies between the teeth and tongue,\nThe Primordial Pool beneath the small intestine,\nThe Jasper Pond emerges before the Crimson Palace,\nKunlun ascends to join Jade Capital,\nThe Celestial Pool fills the inner courtyard,\nThe Phoenix Pond lies between heart and lungs,\nThe Jade Pool resides within the lips and teeth.\n\nSpirit-water arises within qi,\nGolden waves descend from the heavens.\nWhere the Crimson Dragon dwells,\nThere are nectar springs and jade fountains.\nThe Crescent Moon’s Winding River—these are the left and right eyes;\nThe Magpie Bridge is precisely the bridge of the nose;\nThe Liberation Tower is none other than the Mud Pill Palace;\nThe Tower of Joy is the philtrum.\nSuch names and designations cannot all be exhaustively recounted.\n\nWhen a person is born,\nAt first, father and mother unite essence and blood,\nAnd through transformation, form is completed.\nIf the father’s essence arrives first and the mother’s blood follows,\nBlood envelops essence to form a male—\nHe first generates the right kidney, thus belonging to yang,\nCorresponding to the sun, governing the descent of the three *hun* with crimson essence-qi to guard the Cinnabar Field.\nThus, the life pulse resides in the *chi* region of the right hand.\nIf the mother’s blood arrives first and the father’s essence follows,\nEssence envelops blood to form a female—\nShe first generates the left kidney, thus belonging to yin,\nCorresponding to the moon, governing the descent of the seven *po* with black true qi to guard the Palace of the Child.\nThus, the life pulse resides in the *chi* region of the left hand.\n\nFor males, the right kidney is generated first,\nThe right kidney generates the spleen,\nThe spleen generates the liver,\nThe liver generates the lungs,\nThe lungs generate the heart,\nThe heart generates the small intestine,\nThe small intestine generates the large intestine,\nThe large intestine generates the gallbladder,\nThe gallbladder generates the stomach,\nThe stomach generates the bladder,\nThe bladder generates the left kidney,\nThe left kidney generates the Triple Burner,\nThe Triple Burner generates the Three Primes.\nFor females, the stomach generates the Triple Burner,\nThe Triple Burner generates the right kidney,\nThe right kidney generates the bladder,\nThe bladder generates the Three Primes.\n\nThe Three Primes generate the Eight Vessels,\nThe Eight Vessels generate the Twelve Channels,\nThe Twelve Channels generate the Fifteen Collaterals,\nThe Fifteen Collaterals generate the One Hundred Eight Branch Collaterals,\nThe Branch Collaterals generate the One Hundred Eighty-Five Minute Collaterals,\nThe Minute Collaterals generate the One Hundred Eighty-Five Network Collaterals,\nThe Network Collaterals generate the Three Hundred Sixty-Five Points,\nThe Points generate the Three Hundred Sixty-Five Bones.\nAfter ten months in the womb, birth occurs.\n\nIn the first month, it is called the *bao*, where essence and blood congeal.\nIn the second month, it is called the embryonic form, the beginning of the germ.\nIn the third month, the yang spirit becomes the three *hun*, moving to give life.\nIn the fourth month, the yin numen becomes the seven *po*, stillness to stabilize form.\nIn the fifth month, the Five Phases divide into the five viscera to settle the spirit.\nIn the sixth month, the Six Pitch Pipes determine the six bowels to nourish the numinous.\nIn the seventh month, the Seven Essences open the seven orifices to connect with luminosity.\nIn the eighth month, the Eight Effulgences of the spirit descend in full, the true numen.\nIn the ninth month, palaces and chambers are arrayed to secure essence.\nIn the tenth month, qi is full, and the myriad images are complete.\n\nWithin are the five viscera,\nExternally corresponding to the Five Phases.\nThe Classic states:\nAt the beginning of conception, the two kidneys are generated—\nThe left is called *xuan*, *xuan* ascends qi and transmits it upward to the liver;\nThe right is called *pin*, *pin* receives fluids and transmits them downward to the bladder.\n*xuan* and *pin* originate from nonbeing,\nTransforming nonbeing into being—\nThis is the true qi of father and mother received into the realm of pure yin.\nThus it is said: “The valley spirit does not die, this is called *xuan-pin*;\nThe gate of *xuan-pin* may be compared to the root of heaven and earth.”\nFrom the kidneys, the five viscera are generated, and the six bowels reside therein.\n\nThe liver is called the Azure Dragon of Wood, located on the left,\nWhere *Wu-Ying* dwells, governing the three *hun*.\nIts qi ascends along the left side of the spine into the eyes, transforming into tears—\nThis is called True Wood.\nThe remaining qi flows into the left side of the upper palate, called Jade Fluid.\n\nThe lungs are called the White Tiger of Metal, located on the right,\nWhere *Bai-Yuan* dwells, governing the seven *po*.\nIts qi ascends along the right side of the spine into the nose, transforming into nasal mucus—\nThis is called True Metal.\nThe remaining qi flows into the upper palate, called Golden Fluid.\n\nThe heart is called the Vermilion Bird of Fire, located above,\nWhere *Si-Ming* dwells, receiving the source of life.\nIts qi ascends along the left side of the chest into the tongue, then enters the heart, transforming into blood—\nThis is called True Fire.\nThe remaining qi flows into the left side beneath the tongue, called Spirit-Water.\n\nThe kidneys are called the Dark Warrior of Water, located below,\nWhere *Tao-Kang* dwells, protecting the root of essence.\nIts qi ascends along the right side of the spleen into the ears, transforming into earwax, then descends to the kidneys—\nThis is called True Water.\nThe remaining qi flows into the right side beneath the tongue, called the Flowery Pond.\n\nThe spleen is called the Curved Array of Earth, located at the center,\nWhere the Great Lord of Longevity dwells.\nIts qi ascends along the right side of the spine into the brain, transforming into saliva—\nThis is called True Earth.\nThe remaining qi flows into the inner cheeks, called the Jade Pool.\n\nThe Classic states:\nBeneath the brows, the Five Wheels arise fully within concentration.\nThe Five Wheels are the eyes—\nComprising the Blood Wheel, Qi Wheel, Water Wheel, Metal Wheel, and Pupil Wheel,\nWhich govern the breath entering concentration.\nThe Perfected One says:\nWithin concentration, water and fire are circulated in the eyes.\nThus, Master Cui regarded the eyes as mirrors, essential to the Five Powers—\nThe source of the Great Dao lies entirely in the power of the eyes.\nThe white of the eye pertains to the lungs,\nThe red vessels pertain to the heart,\nThe black of the eye pertains to the kidneys,\nThe eyelids’ yellow pertains to the spleen,\nThe single luminous point within pertains to the liver.\nThe essence of the five viscera gathers in the eyes.\nWhen the qi of the five viscera is complete, the five-colored spirit-light appears;\nWhen the five viscera embrace their treasures, the eyes inwardly perceive true scenes, bright as broad daylight.\nWhen the five viscera decline, the spirit-light dims;\nWhen the five viscera are exhausted, the spirit-light departs, and death follows.\n\nIt is also said:\nThe eyes are the gate of the vajra,\nThe nose is the gate of the furnace and crucible for refining gold,\nThe nostrils govern the ingress and egress of breath, serving as the root of qi and the bolt of the *chong* vessel.\nThe vajra is the primordial spirit—\nExiting and entering through the eyes,\nIf one can inwardly gaze and gaze long, one attains longevity.\nThe Golden Lord is the saliva in the lungs;\nThe Alchemical Maiden is the blood in the heart.\nThe Infant is the essence in the kidneys;\nThe Yellow Dame is the saliva in the spleen.\nThe Seven Treasures are spirit, qi, vessels, essence, blood, saliva, and fluids.\n\nHere follows the translation:\n\n---\n\nThis is also the method of the Sevenfold Return to the True. First, moisten the entire body, then one can generate water; when water flourishes, it generates saliva; when saliva flourishes, it transforms into blood; when blood flourishes, it refines essence; when essence flourishes, it replenishes the brain; when the brain flourishes, it strengthens qi; when qi flourishes, the spirit becomes whole.\n\nThe human body corresponds to the generative numbers of the Five Phases. Above the heart lies the Nine Heavens; below the kidneys lies the Nine Earths. From the kidneys to the heart measures eight *cun* and four *fen*; from the heart to the first ring of the *chonglou* and thence to the crown measures eight *cun* and four *fen*—this is called the *Niwan* and *Jianggong*, where the Supreme One, the Lord of Emperors, resides, governing all spirits. From the kidneys to the crown totals two *chi*, five *cun*, and two *fen*, comprising eighty-one *zhang* of primordial qi, corresponding to the pure yang number of nine nines.\n\nIn a full day and night, the water clock descends one hundred *ke*. Each *ke* is divided into sixty *fen*, totaling six thousand *fen*. In every ten *fen*, a person’s breath undergoes twelve and a half cycles of ingress and egress. Within these hundred *ke*, heaven rotates left while earth turns right; human qi and blood harmonize with the Three Powers, and *ying* and *wei* circulate the upright qi of heaven and earth.\n\nOne exhalation and one inhalation constitute a single breath. The meridians open and close, breath flows in and out, and in the span of day and night, there are thirteen thousand five hundred breaths, with exhalation and inhalation in perfect balance. What is exhaled is one’s own primordial qi, issuing from within; what is inhaled is the upright qi of heaven and earth, entering from without. When the root is firm and robust, and primordial yang remains undiminished, one can seize the upright qi of heaven and earth between breaths.\n\nThe pure becomes *ying*, the turbid becomes *wei*, all flowing unimpeded; the transverse are the *luo*, the vertical are the meridians, all attaining free circulation. Thereafter, cold and heat cannot invade, toil and hardship cannot harm; the body is strong, the bones are sturdy, the qi is fresh, and the spirit is clear. One becomes a person of unaging vitality, forever preserving boundless longevity.\n\nThe True Dragon and True Tiger are *Kan* and *Li*, heart and kidneys. When Dragon and Tiger unite in intercourse, they refine the Golden Elixir. As the *Neijing of Heavenly Treasure* states: \"The Infant and the Alchemical Maiden, their qi merging in the *Huangting*,\" this is the way. When merit is accomplished and conduct perfected, one becomes an immortal, attaining the Dao of longevity and deathlessness.\n\n---\n\n*The Mirror of Heavenly Origin and Human Elixir*\nBy the Perfected Master Cui Xifan\n\nIn my youth, I wandered as a cloud upon the waters and once encountered a perfected one who discoursed on the extensions of nurturing life. To grasp the essentials of Dragon and Tiger, one must know the Three Rivers’ blessed land, the wondrous realms and sacred altars, endure the trials of mist and rosy clouds, and traverse the traces of all sages. Often, when meeting those who initiate the Dao, we mutually recognize the resonance of bells.\n\nThough I have not personally tended the tripod and furnace, I have slightly unveiled the mysteries and compiled the secret methods of the Heavenly Origin, revealing the wondrous Dao of Dragon and Tiger, the root-source of Lead and Mercury. May fellow seekers of the Dao peruse this with fortune.\n\nOriginally, when the Great Simplicity divided, darkness descended upon the myriad things, binding them to life and death. The dead do not comprehend life; the living retain form, while the dead lose their bodies. Life and death may be relinquished to merge with the Dao and unite with the True.\n\nLife arises from spirit, is governed by essence, and flourishes through things. Of all things, humans are the most numinous. The body is the root of spirit’s transformations; essence in humans is like a boat afloat on water, qi in humans is like wind scattering dust, and spirit in humans is like a wild horse galloping across the sky. When water stills, the boat halts; when wind ceases, dust settles; when the wild horse scatters, the great emptiness endures forever.\n\nEssence can secure things, qi can flourish things, and when essence, qi, and spirit unite as three, the heart may remain unmoved. In their transformations, one forgets the outer form and nurtures the inner spirit—this is the path to ascending as a perfected one.\n\nWhen desires run rampant in the heart, who can long abandon them? When sorrow and joy wound the will, when thoughts and worries labor the spirit, who can long forget them? When wealth and rank weary the body, who can long relinquish them? When the five flavors corrupt essence, who can long restrain them? When wine and sweet liquor disorder essence, who can long abstain? Indulging in fine foods, drinking fine wine, gazing upon beauties, listening to lewd sounds—though one’s essence and qi may be strong, they bring calamity upon the body; though the ears and eyes may delight, they lead to chaos in the spirit.\n\nWith a hundred paths to ruin the Dao and not a speck of hope for the True, how can one witness the efficacy of nurturing life? Those who study the Dao outwardly do not let their intent chase after things, and inwardly do not let their intent follow the heart’s chaos. Serenely, they preserve emptiness and stillness, attaining the realm of purity and tranquility. It is like the labor of building a house: even borrowing a moment’s form and qi, one must still rest the spirit to return to clarity—how much more so when aligning with the Dao and preserving the True Elixir!\n\nJi Kang said: Immortality must be attained through effort and learning, depending on the natural endowment of qi. Like the cicada shedding its husk, sitting in forgetfulness, corpse-liberation, womb-entering, and soul-seizing methods; the essence of Lead and Mercury, the wonders of *Kan* and *Li*; riding the wind, chasing the rain, soaring through the clouds, treading upon water—such as the Yellow Emperor transforming into a dragon to depart the world, or the people of Qin riding phoenixes to ascend into emptiness—those who study and then become immortals have existed from ancient times to the present. How could one attain immortality without such arts?\n\nBorn within the world, knowing the ways of immortals, and extending to those beyond the world—these are the worthy, the remote, the resolute. To learn without ceasing is to be worthy; to be worthy without ceasing is to be a sage; to be a sage without ceasing is to be a spirit; to be a spirit without ceasing is to be vast and empty, surging beyond the cosmos, emerging between heaven and earth.\n\nExternally, yin and yang unite to generate form; internally, they generate spirit. The heart is the master of spirit, illuminating the obscure without fail, penetrating the stagnant without hindrance. Guard silence and settle the heart; when the heart is settled, qi harmonizes; when qi harmonizes, essence congeals; when essence congeals, the spirit becomes numinous; when the spirit is numinous, it communicates with the True.\n\nIn sleep, if one dreams, the spirit is still enslaved to its objects; once the heart labors over its thoughts, even in dreams, the heart does not attain its natural tranquility. When primordial qi descends and fortuitously aligns with the principle of emptiness, this is called the perfected one who dreams not.\n\nThose who cultivate the inner elixir align the body with the crucible, model essence and qi upon lead and mercury, and liken Kan and Li to water and fire. The numinous spirit forms the essence, manifesting the marvels of transformation. Over time, essence refines into qi, and the numinous spirit, suffused with essence, sheds the bodily form—akin to the floating and sinking of lead and mercury.\n\nThe heart governs fire, and fire governs qi; qi governs life. It is gained through the heart and lost through the heart. Fire is the pivot of life and death. When the heart scatters essence and stirs qi, one must preserve clarity and purity.\n\nCultivating the elixir resembles a dragon nurturing its pearl or a pregnant woman carrying her child: every movement is guarded, lest harm befall it. Only when the work is complete and the inner signs manifest does the elixir’s power reveal itself. If the heart is disordered and the will corrupted, if the body is wearied and the spirit harmed, the true embryo will wither and dissipate. As Laozi said, it is like holding a vessel brimming full—seek within the heart, never without.\n\nThe sun and moon are the supreme essences of heaven and earth; Kan and Li are the great medicine of the human body. Thus, the sage observes the external to know the internal, illuminating the workings of numinous transformation. The pearl in the clam’s womb, the hare’s pregnancy, the rhinoceros horn, the magpie’s limbs, the toad’s neck, the turtle’s shadow, the offspring of the mantis and the cicada—all are conceived without the union of qi or the mingling of essence, but through the heart’s intent communicating with the spirit. Therefore, the *Book of Changes* states: \"Abiding in stillness, yet responsive and penetrating—who but the supremely refined can achieve this?\" It defies description.\n\nEven lowly creatures like dogs and horses instinctively grasp the mystery of the \"mysterious pass,\" steadfast in heart and resolve, shedding form and transcending substance. How much more should the most numinous of beings—masters of life-nurturing arts and the methods of longevity—embrace the principle of \"obscurity and tranquility\"? Those who carve their bones and wash their hearts, who cherish the resolve to refine gold and stone, who honor their teachers and befriend the wise, disregard wealth or poverty, honor or disgrace, right or wrong, and remain untouched by worldly affairs—how could they, even for a moment, forget the Dao?\n\nNeglecting small deeds will eventually erode great virtue. To attain immortality, one must first establish unwavering resolve and accumulate great virtue. How profound these words are! Heaven favors none but the virtuous.\n\nThe *Illustration of the Inner Elixir* was recorded by the Perfected One Cui Xifan of the Later Tang, in the year *gengzi* on the full moon.\n\n---\n**Illustration of Kan-Li Conjunction**\n*Colophon to Volume Twenty-One of* Miscellaneous Writings on the Swift Path from the *Ten Books on Cultivating the True*\n\n**Volume Twenty-Two: \"Song of Exhortation to the Dao\" (Concluded)**\n\nDisorder of nature often stems from indulgence in wine;\nHarm to the true arises from careless tea.\nOverfullness makes digestion difficult;\nWhen hungry, eat but a little.\nContentment ensures lasting sufficiency;\nFreedom from thought is itself freedom from error.\nIf you cherish emptiness and tranquility,\nWhy envy wealth, honor, or glory?\n\nThe celestial crucible refines naturally;\nThe Red Water nurtures the Yellow Sprout.\nAll illnesses arise from primordial qi;\nThe key lies in gathering the Three Flowers.\nWondrously, the Six Harmonies and Four Openings\nCycle and turn the River Chariot.\nThe Great Dao is fundamentally simple,\nYet learners drift like waves, lost in complexity.\n\nThe Three Teachings share a single Dao,\nHarmonious as one family.\nThe River of Love knows no bounds;\nThe Sea of Suffering stretches endlessly.\nWhy, then, cling to delusion, greed, and attachment,\nTurning white jade into flawed stone?\nWithout accumulating even a drop of merit,\nOne drifts complacently like grains of sand.\nFortunately, there exists a path to liberation—\nDo not let the Six Thieves obstruct your way.\nTurn the mechanism, and you return to the original state;\nRefine lead, mercury, and cinnabar to perfection.\nThus is long life and enduring vision assured,\nAnd the Purple Court emerges from the mist.\nEach must climb the mountain through their own effort—\nA thousand miles begin with a single step.\nDo not wait until the last day of the lunar month,\nWhen regret and resentment will be too late.\n\nMaster Xu Jing’s *\"Song of the Great Dao,\"* Sima Ziwei’s *\"Song of Sitting in Forgetfulness,\"* and He Xiangu’s *\"Song of Realizing the Dao\"* all speak with profound clarity, benefiting the world. Drawing from the lost teachings of the immortals, I composed this *\"Song of Exhortation to the Dao\"* to universally encourage those who cultivate the true and together realize the Great Dao.\n\n*Written by Zeng Zao, the Wandering Scholar.*\n\n---\n**Matching the Rhyme of \"Song of Exhortation to the Dao\" by Wang Chengxu**\n\nTo heal decline and sustain vitality, rely on wine—\nWine, the foremost of all pleasures, preserves spirit and nurtures qi.\nTo clear the mind and invigorate the qi, rely on tea—\nBut take care not to harm the qi with tea’s sharpness.\n(*Illustrated Classic of Materia Medica*)\n\nPlain and simple food should be doubled;\nThe five pungent flavors, reduced.\nAs the *Yellow Court Classic* says:\n\"Exquisite flavors from without bring foul, rank qi.\"\n\nElevate the numinous spirit;\nThe fetal qi will flourish.\nPreserve the harmony of primordial and upright qi,\nAnd illness will have no foothold.\n\nIf you wish to leap beyond life and death,\nFirst see through the illusory and fleeting.\nThe Four Beasts divide into the Four Symbols—\nGreen Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise.\nThe Five Qi give rise to the Five Sprouts—\nThe Five Sprouts are the true qi of the five viscera.\n\nWithin the crucible, the great medicine is refined;\nBefore your eyes, golden flowers naturally appear.\n(*Bi Fa*): \"Once the golden liquid is formed, golden flowers manifest of themselves.\"\n\nFollow the daily cycle of the Eight Trigrams;\nWith the seasons, move the Three Chariots—\nThe Small River Chariot, the Great River Chariot, the Purple River Chariot.\n(*Bi Fa*): \"Once you grasp the seedless fire-date, do not let the exchanged pear have flaws.\"\n\nAs the saying goes, \"On the Three Mountains, there are companions\";\nYou will naturally know the \"Four Seas and Five Houses.\"\nThese two lines are entirely from Hai Chan:\n\"Water a thousand layers deep, a livelihood of pine and mist;\nTen thousand acres of creeping fig, a life of clouds and mist.\"\n\nVermilion brilliance merges with the true, taking form;\n(*Bi Fa*): \"Its shape like a pellet, its color like vermilion brilliance.\"\nThe primordial pearl shines upon the form, flawless.\n\nBuilding a hut, I once dwelled in a thatched abode—\nZhongli Quan spent thirty years in a thatched hut on Mount Zhongnan.\nTransforming the Hu, he crossed the distant Flowing Sands—\nLord Lao ascended to the west to transform the Hu people.\n\nThere is but one gate through which to enter;\nAll else is like a deer caught in a hunter’s net.\nExchanging mortal bones for immortal ones—\nAs Master Lü said: \"Begging from the greedy scholar, I rejoice in immortal bones.\"\nDo not mistake cinnabar for common mercury—\nAs Master Ping Shu said: \"If one wishes to know true lead and mercury, they are not common cinnabar or vulgar quicksilver.\"\n\nSuddenly transformed—why need one emerge from the shell?\nMaster Lü never left his shell, yet transformed into a fire-dragon and soared away.\nWith long practice, one is certain to ride the rosy clouds.\nThe *Huangting Jing* states: \"With steadfast practice, one soars like an immortal—this is the secret transmission, not to be misaligned by even a moment.\"\nThe *Bi Fa* says: \"Follow the method in its time; through method seek the Dao.\"\n\nDeluded disciples refuse to fix their minds—\nSitting idly, awaiting their end—how lamentable!\n\nCheng Xu, styled Shaozhi, passed the imperial examinations in Confucian studies and served as a professor in Kuizhou.\nFrom youth, he mastered the art of absorbing the essence of the sun and moon’s radiance.\nLater, he awakened to the Dao and, at over eighty years of age, remained as robust as in his prime.\nThis song reveals his character.\n\nShaozhi, a native of Luozhou, placed under Cai Yi’s examination roster, composed a verse in response to the *Exhortation to the Dao*, clarifying profound truths before returning to the original rhyme:\n\nHungry, he scorns not coarse fare;\nThin wine surpasses strong tea.\nThough provisions have their measure,\nHow much better to cherish blessings and leave some behind.\n\nQi harmonized, all illnesses vanish;\nThe heart upright, all evils repelled.\nDay and night, embrace the primordial and guard the One;\nDawn and dusk, hold the blossom and savor its essence.\n\nThe yin soul wholly dissolved,\nThe yang light within sprouts its bud.\nThis is true suchness and prajñā—\nNothing but emerald bamboo and golden flowers.\n\nDeep and clear as a polished mirror,\nSilently revolving like a spinning wheel.\nEver prizing raw fish and roasted meats,\nExotic flavors shun pears and hawthorns.\n\nNine returns, seven reversals—Dao attained;\nThe Ten Continents and Three Isles become home.\nOnly when the mortal heart is wholly extinguished\nDoes one verify that our lives have their bounds.\n\nTranscending form, releasing wisdom,\nLiquid as if washing away filth and blemishes.\nThe Great Dao is plain and direct—\nMany paths wind and twist in circles.\n\nTo study yet not sever desire\nIs to toil in vain, cooking sand for rice.\nYearning to grasp the wind or seize a shadow,\nHow can one plant jade and feast on rosy clouds?\n\nGreat perfection is the ultimate attainment,\nYet each enters at a different level.\nThe day the fire-dragon breaks through,\nThe world gazes in awe and sighs.\n\nCheng Xu again adopts the former rhyme:\n\nQi robust—why need one drink wine?\nSleep scant—no need to sip tea.\nA single point of pure emptiness holds savor;\nThe six dusts depart, leaving nothing behind.\n\nThe yang relies on the three hun to govern,\nThe yin conceals the seven po as evil.\nThe *Bi Fa* states: \"The three hun are the yang’s constant measure, giving life; the seven po are the yin’s constant measure, bringing death.\"\n\nTransformation follows the Northern Dipper,\nGathering the true silently accords with the *Nanhua*.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says: \"This is called the Way of gathering the true.\"\n\nNature bright, nurturing the Dao incurs no loss;\nThe heart’s ground sows the elixir, sprouting buds.\nSheltered by ever-spring’s verdant boughs—\nThe *Huangting Jing* says: \"All trees with branches may offer shelter, aiding the formation of the seven-jeweled body.\"\nFragrance wafts—unfading celestial flowers,\nAs told in the *Laozi Taiqing Jing*.\n\nStrike open the golden tiger of the inner courtyard—foolishness calls it returning to the inner courtyard.\nBurn through Kunlun’s fire-chariot.\nThe Lady of Western Splendor says: \"Drive the fire-chariot to burn through Kunlun.\"\n\nNine fermentations pour endlessly—\nThe *Central Yellow Scripture* states: \"The Lord of Life holds nine fermentations of immortal brew, poured without end.\"\n\nThree peaches of the Queen Mother of the West: the jade-green peach, the flat peach.\nChewed without residue.\n\nA dark crane flies in as companion,\nWhite clouds in the deep make a home.\n\nBeyond the sea of delusion, there is a reckoning;\nDrowned in the bitter sea, no shore in sight.\n\nWhen merit is complete, signs arise of their own;\nWhen the path is fulfilled, who can point to the slightest flaw?\n\nJade is won only by splitting stone;\nGold is sought only by sifting sand.\n\nAttain the ten isles: Zu Island, Ying Island, Xuan Island, Yan Island, Chang Island, Yuan Island, Liu Island, Sheng Island, Fenglin Island, Ju Island.\nOn the journey, five-colored clouds will naturally shield the way.\n\nOnce you realize the divine furnace holds the medicine,\nWhy labor over the nine tripods scattering sand?\n\nMen become the spirit perch;\nWomen, the golden tripod.\n\nThose with resolve rinse their mouths at the spring and pillow the stone;\nContent to angle for the moon and nest in the rosy clouds.\n\nMinor methods number in the thousands—\nThe *Bi Fa* says: \"Side doors and minor methods do not align with the Great Dao.\"\nMaster Xu True Man says: \"Three thousand six hundred methods.\"\n\nYet the straight path is but one, without deviation.\nPingshu says: \"One straight path leads to heaven;\nAll other gates and courts will eventually meet it.\"\n\nIf you do not swiftly cultivate and set to work,\nThe tree withers, and all that remains is vain lament.\nThe *Huangting Jing* says: \"Leaves fall, branches wither, and verdure is lost—\nJust as when human essence and qi decline, the form must wither.\"\n\n*Rhyme used in three instances*\n\nBoast not of drinking a *shi* of wine;\nCovet not seven bowls of tea.\nThree cups may open the Great Dao—\nAfter eating, rinse the teeth and sip a little.\n\nThe five qi return to the cinnabar palace;\nA single thought does not stray into any evil.\n\nVigorous spirit fills the belly,\nA modest demeanor, unadorned.\n\nThe lingzhi of the three fields puts forth its splendor;\nThe orchid of the nine wells sprouts its buds.\n\nThe jade pool brims with rich water—\nThe *Huangting Jing* says: \"The jade pool’s clear water gives rise to rich essence.\"\n\nPurple clouds cover the yellow flower.\nImmortal Li’s poem says: \"The yellow flower grows beneath purple clouds.\"\n\nClose the upper and lower gates tightly,\nThe celestial drum resounds like thunder’s chariot.\n\nDaily partake of fragrant *qingjing* rice,\nShun the bitter plum and wild hawthorn.\n\nScattered are the minor arts of side gates,\nClamorous the hundred schools of various masters.\nThe heart roams within the bounds of the square,\nGazing at the Dao, distant as heaven’s edge.\n\nWho can transcend and attain sudden awakening,\nPreserving virtue in its purity without flaw?\nWhen used, it is treasured like gold and jade;\nWhen unused, it is cast aside like dust and sand.\n*The Discourse on Divine Immortals* says: \"When used, it is like gold and jade; when unused, like mud and earth.\"\n\nThe bright mirror is originally without stain—\nWipe it clean, lest dust obscure it.\n\nWhy did the Marquis of Liu resort to grain avoidance?\nIn vain did he seek cinnabar in Goulou.\nGentle and warm, the foot-square dwelling radiates light,\nCrimson tides unfurl like brocade clouds.\n\nWhen three thousand merits are perfected and deeds fulfilled,\nNot a hair’s breadth of error remains.\nStraightaway ascend the Scarlet Pass of Pure Capital,\nWhere the host of immortals points and sighs in admiration.\n\n*Rhyme used in three instances*\n\nSip sparingly the wine of Zhu Bo’s table—\nIn the Former Han, Zhu Bo never drained three cups from his desk.\nRarely brew the divine tea of Lu Yu—\nLu Yu, the tea immortal.\n\nThe intestines, thin as a rope, show proof—\nThe Daoist’s bowels grow slender as a cord,\nTrue qi fills them, food intake lessens,\nThe gut naturally contracts.\n\nThe heart burns like fire, without a trace of slack—\nIf the heart’s fire cannot be subdued,\nThe belly swells, and one contends with things.\n\nQi flows ever through the nine apertures;\nIf one aperture’s qi is blocked, illness arises.\nThe hundred bones repel the hundred evils—\nThe eight directions’ perverse qi.\n\nOne should make cold ashes blaze anew,\nBid withered wood bloom once more—\nReturning old age to youth.\n\nTo eliminate desire is to secure the stem of life;\nTrue essence is the stem of life.\nSevering attachment lets the Dao’s sprout grow long—\nEmptiness gives birth to the Way.\n\nOnce awakened to the something within nothing,\nAs Laozi said: “Vague! Elusive! Yet within it, something.”\nNaturally, flowers bloom in water—\nAs Xihua said: “In water, flowers bloom, their fragrance lingering through the four seasons.”\n\nSimply take the phoenix marrow from the Southern Palace,\nAs the poem of Master Lü says: “Below, use the crimson dragon’s marrow.”\nDo not follow the sheep-cart beyond the gate—\nThe *Lotus Sutra* speaks of sheep-carts and deer-carts, now left outside the gate.\n\nOther methods’ crucibles bring many ills—\nThere are ten kinds of crucibles.\nOne’s own garden’s greens are few and sparse—\nAs Pingshu said: “Like planting vegetables in one’s own garden,\nOne must sever the true embryo.”\n\nAttaining the Dao is truly no attainment—\nAs the *Laozi Qingxu Jing* says: “Though called ‘attaining the Dao,’\nIn truth, there is nothing attained.\nFor transforming sentient beings, it is named ‘attaining the Dao’ and returning to the root.”\n\nLeaving home does not lie in departing from home—\nIf every thought is not yet cut off,\nEven leaving home remains worldly.\nIf all thoughts are severed,\nEven at home, one is as if having left it.\n\nReturning to the root does not lie beyond the body—\nIn vain do the hurried scurry to the ends of the earth.\nAs Master Shi’s poem says: “The hurried rush about,\nSeeking elsewhere what is hard to find within.”\n\nThe root of nature was originally without encumbrance;\nThe treasure of life was inherently without flaw—\nAs Pingshu said: “The treasure of life should not be lightly toyed with.”\n\nRefining the elixir must rely on the master cave—\nThe Jade Cave, Jade Peak.\nObtaining the medicine is called “gold sand”—\nThere is a gold-sand crucible.\n\nThe profound principles should follow the Old Master;\nDo not cling to empty nothingness, nor fixate on Vairocana—\nVairocana, a Buddhist term.\n\nIf one wishes to refine form into qi,\nOne must teach mercury to transform into cinnabar—\nAs the *Bi Fa* says: “Refining form into qi makes one an earthly immortal.”\nIt also says: “Mercury transforms into cinnabar,\nLead transforms into the golden elixir.”\n\nBefore *Tongxuan*, there was Yellow Valley—\nThe Yellow Emperor met the Master of Yellow Valley,\nWho said: “There are other words of *Tongxuan*.”\nIn cultivating the true, there is also Blue Mist—\nMaster Blue Mist attained the Dao and left his instructions for a thousand generations.\n\nPush carefully into the two teachings—\nDaoism and Buddhism.\nThe difference between long life and extinction is vast.\n\nTo burn the body in vain pursuit of śarīra—\nThe seven treasures are ruined, how lamentable!\nMan is endowed with a seven-jeweled body.\n\n*Vice Prefect of Pengzhou Military Prefecture Guo Ye’s Rhymed Response*\n\nPreserve form, preserve life, preserve destiny—\nAbstain from lust, from wine, from tea.\nIf you wish the night’s qi to endure,\nEat lightly at dusk.\n\nTo nurture the heart, nothing compares to few desires;\nTo preserve spirit, one must keep perverse influences at bay.\nDiscern heaven’s clarity and earth’s turbidity,\nAnd swallow the essence of the sun and moon.\n\nCold ashes can burst into flame,\nWithered roots can instantly sprout.\nScholars abandon the root to chase the branch,\nSick eyes cling to empty flowers.\n\nThe sacred Dao’s path is one,\nYet in vain do they recite cartloads of alchemical texts.\nIt is like refining gold with dross,\nNo different from chewing sugarcane and swallowing its dregs.\n\nHow could the enlightened not know this?\nFrom the primordial beginning, they make kalpas their home.\nIn silent sitting, all tasks are complete—\nAlready traversed are the corners of the sea and the ends of the earth.\n\nThe mirror is bright and admits no speck of dust;\nThe jade is pure and shows no trace of flaw.\nRegard high rank as shackles,\nCast aside wealth as mud and sand.\n\nThe winding river yields to autumn’s moon—\nHow could mist and clouds obscure it?\n\nThe fire dragon and water tiger coil and intertwine,\nHarmonizing yin mercury and yang cinnabar.\nThe true body naturally ascends and transforms,\nRiding the phoenix high into the purple mist.\n\nAlas for the side doors’ petty arts—\nTheir practices vary in a thousand ways.\nEach toils in vain, achieving nothing,\nAnd in old age, only sighs in sorrow.\n\n---\n\n*Lyrics to the Melody of Linjiangxian*\n\nSit facing east

must awaken early.\nClinging to infatuation,\nSpring flowers and autumn moons—\nWhen will it ever end?\n\nFirst of four:\n\nAll dharmas arise from the mind,\nObserve the dharma-realm—\nAll is created by the mind.\nLaozi and Gautama,\nThough their paths differ, share the same principle:\nThe Dao is not apart from the mind.\nOnce you recognize\nThe union of *kan* and *li*,\nThe elixir’s coarse cycles of dawn and dusk become known.\nRising like rain, flying,\nThe toad flees the moon’s palace,\nThe cinnabar gate knows no more vexation.\n\nWithin qi lies true liquid,\nWithin liquid lies true qi,\nHarmonized in perfect measure.\nCultivate the yellow sprout,\nRefine the crimson water,\nDragon and tiger intertwine.\nNine returns, seven reversions—\nWhen the work is complete,\nYou regain your youth of old.\nThree thousand merits fulfilled, the practice perfected—\nThen, at last, it is finished.\n\nSecond of four.\n\nThird of four:\n\nTo study the Dao and refine the mind,\nPreserve spirit and temper nature—\nThe key is to gently replenish the brain and restore essence.\nFlowing water does not stagnate,\nThe door’s hinge never rots.\n\nSun’s soul and moon’s marrow,\nGathered in the crucible and cauldron,\nTrue qi naturally gathers and abides.\nBind the monkey of the mind,\nRein in the horse of intent,\nFar from dust and care.\n\nWhen stillness clarifies,\nYang dragon and yin tiger,\nWater and fire penetrate—then the work is done.\nEight wondrous verses,\nA thousand living methods,\nYet one path lies above all.\n\nLü [Dongbin] was noble,\nThough not beyond the world—\nIf you have the destiny, you must meet.\nLet us agree to the Ten Isles and Three Mountains,\nRiding simurghs and cranes,\nAll to depart together.\n\nFourth of four:\n\nTo nurture water, nurture essence,\nTo nurture spirit, nurture blood—\nFirst, you must nurture qi.\nSun and moon, yin and yang,\nSix lines and eight trigrams,\nStudy closely the *Cantong Qi*.\n\nThe numinous body, the sacred treasure,\nA thousand words, ten thousand phrases—\nYet all distill to *kan* and *li*.\nUpon Kunlun’s peak,\nReturn to the root and revert to the origin,\nTo understand the beginning and end.\n\nThough the body is small,\nIt mirrors heaven and earth,\nEighty-four thousand leagues and more.\nThe Gate of Mystery and Darkness,\nFrom which all things are born,\nLies within perfect harmony.\n\nBeyond this true truth,\nThere is no other truth—\nThen you will know the Dao is one and only.\nWhen you meet Zhongli [Quan] and Lü [Dongbin] in time,\nIf anything remains unclear,\nAsk your teacher for guidance.\n\nIn the world, there are those of the Dao,\nYet side doors and minor methods mislead learners.\n\nHere is the translation:\n\n---\n\nSome eminent scholars claim: \"Is not human life precious? One may live for several hundred years.\" Practicing bedroom arts for self-preservation, they believe none surpass them—yet when the barrel’s bottom falls away, their nature-root collapses, and regret comes too late. Shu Guang of the Eastern Han learned from Rongcheng Gong the art of \"guiding women,\" living to one hundred fifty or sixty, his hair turned white while his complexion remained like that of a man in his thirties or forties—yet still, he could not escape death. If even Shou Guang met such an end, how much worse for those who fall short of his longevity?\n\nI composed four *Yongyule* lyrics to exhort the world: turn back the radiance and reflect inward. Let those who would defend themselves through bedroom arts take heed—awaken at last, cultivate the realm of purity, stillness, and non-action, for only then is ultimate truth attained.\n\n**Four *Yujia’ao* Lyrics**\n\nThe supreme Dao is not distant—it lies near at hand,\nYet a hair’s breadth of error spans a thousand miles.\nThe Dao is hard to grasp, yet fundamentally simple.\nWhen resonance is found,\nOne transcends directly into the Tathāgata’s realm.\n\nWhen water and fire merge in *jiji*,\nThe Three Corpses and Six Bandits all retreat.\nThrough this alone, one attains long life and enduring vision—\nBody, speech, and mind transform into a single qi of harmony.\n\n**I**\n\nSpirit is nature, qi is life;\nWhen spirit does not stray outward, qi naturally settles.\nFortunate is Cui Gong’s *Mirror for Ingesting the Medicine*.\nWhen fully realized,\nThe true self, like a bird, returns to its root in stillness.\n\nWhen host and guest are inwardly luminous, the outer responds;\nThe numinous terrace gathers and emits celestial radiance.\nWithin the two vessels, a single scene unfolds—\nHasten to cultivate and reflect,\nLest you dig a well only when thirst strikes.\n\n**II**\n\nNurture the essence-root, guard the spirit, and preserve qi;\nThe natural mother and child never part.\nDay and night, through the six watches, keep it in mind.\nWithin the Three Fields,\nWarm as the harmonious waters of heaven and earth.\n\nBefore the Twelve-Story Tower, white snow gleams rich;\nBy the Nine-Palace Terrace, the yellow sprout flourishes.\nAt the Mountain of Sun and Moon, pay homage to the Emperor.\nWhen the spirit-light arises,\nThe body ascends straight beyond the clouds.\n\n**Three**\n\nI possess a luminous pearl beyond price,\nIts radiance ever illuminating the field of mushrooms.\nNo more \"this\" or \"that,\" no \"thus\" or \"so.\"\nFew know its tune—\nWho in this world can truly walk this path?\n\nTen thousand rays of essence wholly guard the dwelling;\nThe four hundred four ailments all cease.\nThe fire dragon emerges, returning to creation—\nThe immortal’s chariot turns,\nNo speck of dust clings to the horse.\n\n**IV**\n\n**Three Urgent Rhythms of Flowers Along the Path**\n\n**I**\nEmbrace the Origin, hold fast to the One—\nThe Four Great Elements naturally ease and settle.\nWithin the heart, turn the light to reflect.\nWhen was it ever idle?\nThe golden crow crows in radiance,\nFlying into the molten silver plate.\n\nHeart after heart, the heart is the Dao—\nOnly in the heart, the heart,\nWhere else could blossoms endure?\nHow many days before they wither and fade?\nCultivating truth is easy,\nAccumulating deeds and merits is hard.\nI urge you: strive to do good—\nAmid the Five Turbidities and Three Wretched Paths,\nYou shall become a divine isle, a sacred mountain.\n\n**II**\nIf one can always remain pure and still,\nHeaven and earth all return to you.\nThe primordial truth contains all wonders.\nEnter the state of non-being and non-non-being—\nEven Master Zhao could not grasp it,\nFor qi’s seasons wax and wane.\nWhen deluded thoughts are wholly extinguished,\nIn drowsiness and hunger,\nNo further action or effort is needed.\n\nThe furnace and cauldron form naturally,\nRadiance piercing through curtains and screens.\nThe Jade Pool’s divine water surges,\nRising to nourish the fat.\nLike one who drinks water,\nIts warmth or coolness only the self knows.\nOne’s own nature and life—\nOnly the self can resolve them,\nOnly the self can claim their benefit.\n\n**III**\nIf we speak of cultivation and nurturance,\nHow many gates are there?\nThe true destination lies in the source of spirit.\nThe utmost truth, the utmost Dao,\nSimple and fitting with heaven and earth.\nKan and Li, water and fire—\nThey are but the trap and snare,\nYet within them, a single pure point endures.\n\nIf one truly awakens to this,\nThe five thousand words are understood.\nGolden pills fly behind the elbow,\nPiercing through Kunlun.\nThe clear river winds nine bends—\nA single oar scatters the mists and haze.\nStriking the water three thousand leagues,\nNinety thousand miles of roc’s flight—\nAll transformations return to the primordial chaos.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Lord’s Transmission to the Queen Mother: The Method of Grasping Firmly**\n\nSit upright, body aligned.\nVisualize a red sun within the heart,\nRound as a coin.\nWhen it warms slightly,\nSend it straight down from the left flank to the cinnabar field,\nThen to the left sole of the foot.\nWhen it warms slightly,\nImagine fire rising from below to burn upward beneath the navel,\nGradually passing to the right foot.\nOnce the sole warms again,\nIgnite the fire from below to burn up to the cinnabar field,\nThen guide it from the right flank over the chest,\nDescending straight down to the lower cinnabar field.\nFrom the lower cinnabar field, raise it to the heart,\nWhere it illuminates the five viscera.\n\nThis is the method of heaven and earth’s ascent and descent:\nAbove, it descends;\nBelow, it ascends.\nThen send it straight down to the cinnabar field,\nInto the bladder,\nPassing through the Gate of the Tailbone,\nBreaking open the two kidneys.\nDraw the two streams of white qi,\nRising straight along the spine to the Mud Pill Palace,\nDividing into three paths to ascend the crown of the head.\nWhen the fontanel warms slightly,\nImagine a pearl descending from the Magpie Bridge into the mouth,\nSlowly passing through the Twelve-Storied Tower of the throat,\nReaching the Central Palace.\nWhen the divine water fills, divide it into three gulps,\nSwallowing it down to the Central Palace.\n\nNext, visualize a stream of black qi in the bladder surging up to the heart.\nThen close the eyes, gather the spirit into the Central Palace,\nWaiting for signs:\nPerhaps golden flowers before the eyes,\nOr ranks of white silk passing by,\nOr the entire chamber filled with light,\nOr light through the window revealing tiny script.\nWithin this light, after a thousand days,\nOne may exit the yin spirit.\nOr, when the seventy-two seasonal nodes of a year are complete,\nOne may exit the spirit.\n\n**Embracing the One: A Discourse**\nThe Dao gives birth to the One,\nThe One gives birth to water,\nWater gives birth to essence.\n\n**On Essence**\n\nEssence is a singular thing. Embracing the One unites with essence; abandoning the One severs from essence. When essence is born, qi is whole; when qi is whole, spirit is whole—spirit thus governs the hun and stabilizes the po. Essence is that by which Heaven and Earth and the myriad things are generated. Yet essence constantly governs man, while man constantly dissipates it. When the apertures leak without measure, one dries within and dies. Death is not essence’s abandonment of man—man abandons essence himself. As Zhuangzi said: “One who does not abandon essence is called a spirit-man.” Thus, to lose control of essence is to forfeit numinosity, sinking into a lower ghost. Yet those who preserve it—how could this be within the reach of the ordinary?\n\n**Preserving Spirit and Essence**\nEssence is the root of spirit; qi is the master of spirit; form is the dwelling of spirit. Thus, overusing spirit exhausts it; overusing essence depletes it; overworking qi severs it. Therefore, that by which man lives is spirit; that by which form is sustained is qi. If qi declines, form wastes away—how can one seek long life then? That which exists arises from the nonexistent; form stands through spirit. The existent is the lodging of the nonexistent; form is the dwelling of spirit. If one does not preserve the dwelling to secure life, cultivate the body to nurture spirit, then qi will scatter and return to emptiness, the wandering hun transforming without end.\n\nConsider the candle: when the wax is spent, the flame cannot abide. Compare it to a dyke: when the dyke breaks, water cannot remain. When the body labors, spirit disperses; when qi labors, life ends; when form emaciates, spirit perishes; when spirit perishes, the refined essence wanders. Once departed, the wanderer has no return; once decayed, there is no principle of rebirth. Thus, spirit is the hun; the po is yin. Spirit can master qi; form can consume flavors. When qi is pure, spirit is clear; when form labors, qi is turbid. Those who ingest the elixir do not die in a thousand or ten thousand years—their bodies ascend to Heaven. Those who eat grains die in a thousand or ten thousand years—their forms return to Earth.\n\nWhen man dies, his form returns to Earth; his hun returns to Heaven; his po descends to the springs. Water and fire disperse, each returning to its source. In life, they share a single body; in death, they part ways—floating and sinking differ, allotted by nature. Consider a single piece of wood set aflame: smoke rises, ash sinks—this too is the principle of nature.\n\nSpirit and luminosity are the root of generation and transformation; essence and qi are the substance of the myriad things. Preserve form to nourish essence and qi, and one’s nature and life will endure.\n\n**The Three Mao Lords’ Formula**\nNurture spirit with qi; gather qi into spirit. When spirit and qi do not scatter, this is called cultivating the true. The child does not leave the mother; the mother does not release the child. Mother and child guard together—long life without death.\n\n**Lü the True Man’s Minor Achievement in Daoist Practices**\nWhenever one wishes to cultivate and nurture, one must first purify the chamber and burn incense, adjusting for warmth and cold, discerning dryness and dampness. Each night after midnight, when generative qi arises, or upon waking at the fifth watch, first exhale the turbid qi from the abdomen—whether nine times or five or six—then settle the mind, close the eyes, and click the teeth thirty-six times to gather heart and spirit.\n\nNext, rub the backs of the thumbs over the eyes, nine times for each, and press the sides of the nose seven times. Rub the hands until they are thoroughly warm, then close the mouth and nose to hold the breath. Rub the face without counting the repetitions—this is the method for the true person’s daily practice.\n\nThen press the tongue against the upper palate, swish the saliva inside and outside the mouth until it fills, divide it into three gulps, and swallow, visualizing it entering the stomach where the stomach spirit receives it. Do this three times for a total of nine swallows, thereby irrigating the five viscera and brightening the complexion. Though this is a secondary method, its power is great—do not take it lightly.\n\n**Visualizing and Swallowing Qi**\nThe lower Cinnabar Field lies three inches below the navel. Behind it are two cavities leading up the spine to the Mud Pill Palace. With each swallow, swiftly visualize the lower Cinnabar Field receiving the original qi, then use intention to blow and guide it into the two cavities. Close the eyes and imagine two streams of white qi flanking the spine, passing through the twenty-four joints, surmounting the Three Passes, and ascending straight into the brain—the Mud Pill Palace, called the upper Cinnabar Field. There, the qi steams through all the palaces, vigorously entering the hair, face, beard, eyebrows, hands, and fingers. Exhale once, and guide it downward into the chest, reaching the middle Cinnabar Field.\n\nThe middle Cinnabar Field is the heart. Visualize the qi irrigating the five viscera, then descending through the lower Cinnabar Field to the Bubbling Spring cavity. The Bubbling Spring is the center of the soles. This is what is meant by steaming the flesh, unobstructing the meridians from head to foot, regulating with a single qi, stirring like thunder, moistening like wind and rain. Just as Heaven and Earth have springs, without the movement of thunder, there would be no way to nourish the myriad things; just as the human body has fluids, without irrigation, there would be no way to moisten the five viscera, emit radiance, return essence to replenish the brain.\n\nThe way of immortality is called the inner elixir. Without exhalation and inhalation, one cannot guide and employ it. Thus, the principle of circulation and the workings of application are modeled on Heaven and imitate Earth. Visualize the turbid, stagnant, perverse qi and stagnant blood within the body all being scoured away by the upright qi, expelled through the tips of the hands and feet—this is called dispersing qi. Extend the fingers without clenching the fists. Each such cycle is called one passage; when the passages are unobstructed, there is no illness. Then regulate to restore balance and repeat the swallowing as before.\n\nHolding the breath and swallowing qi up to thirty-six times is called minor achievement. If one has not yet ceased taking grains, one should proceed thus far, eating sparingly to keep the abdomen empty. Whether sitting or otherwise, whenever the abdomen feels hollow, swallow the qi. From dawn to dusk, do this ten times, and the qi will naturally flow. Three hundred sixty swallows is called middle achievement; one thousand two hundred swallows is called great achievement—this is the great embryonic breathing.\n\nAs with minor embryonic breathing, simply hold the breath and count to one thousand two hundred—this is also called great embryonic breathing. Yet if one cannot refine the form and transform the bones, even if one attains longevity, one remains but a withered tree, devoid of radiant essence.\n\n**Method for Clarifying Ears and Eyes**\nRegularly press with the hands the small cavities behind both brows, twenty-seven times. Then rub the palms and fingers over the eyelids, and rotate the eyes thirty times—only the count matters, not the timing. Upon completion, stroke the forehead twenty-seven times in reverse, beginning at the midpoint between the brows and ending at the hairline. Swallow the saliva as often as it gathers. Practicing this consistently sharpens hearing and sight.\n\n**Discourse on Nurturing Life and Prolonging Vitality**\n**Daily Prohibitions:** Do not eat to fullness at dusk.\n**Monthly Prohibitions:** Do not become heavily intoxicated at dusk.\n**Yearly Prohibitions:** Do not travel far when visiting ancestral graves.\n**Lifelong Prohibitions:** Always guard the qi at dusk.\n\nProlonged seeing harms the blood; prolonged walking harms the sinews; prolonged exposure harms the wind; prolonged standing harms the bones; prolonged sitting harms the flesh; prolonged speech harms the qi.\n\nExcessive thought stagnates the spirit; excessive contemplation scatters the will; excessive affairs weary the body; excessive speech exhausts the qi; excessive laughter injures the viscera; excessive sorrow unsettles the heart; excessive anger harms the vessels; excessive joy injures the blood; excessive delight overflows the qi; excessive desire leads to confusion; excessive aversion induces emaciation.\n\nIn summer, avoid extreme cold; in spring and summer, do not bind the head; in autumn and winter, do not face west when sleeping.\n\nEat only after hunger arises; drink only after thirst arises. Excessive thirst impedes the flow of qi; excessive hunger prevents its storage. Overeating harms the lungs; excessive fasting harms the qi.\n\nDraw in qi frequently through the nose; exhale gently through the mouth. The pillow should not be too high; do not spit too far.\n\nOne should engage in labor but avoid exhaustion. In spring and summer, keep both head and feet cool; retire early in spring and summer, and upon rising, exhale less and inhale more. In autumn and winter, keep the feet warm and the head cool. When walking, do not wear thin clothing, lest one suffer cold, cholera, indigestion, or headaches.\n\nBefore mid-spring and mid-winter, wear thicker garments below and thinner ones above. At the onset of spring and winter, take a purgative once to avoid contracting seasonal qi.\n\nIn winter, when heaven and earth are closed, blood and qi are stored. If one does not sweat or vent, yang qi will deplete. Each dawn and night, rub the spine and knead the limbs, head, and neck—practice this at all times, and illness cannot take hold.\n\nAt daybreak, rub the hands together until warm, then stroke the spine three times. Do not spit upon speaking. First knock the teeth fourteen times, then grind them seven times—this is called refining the essence.\n\nBefore rising, rinse the mouth with saliva until full, then swallow it forcefully. Upon rising, wash the face without opening the eyes, lest one lose sight or suffer dry, teary eyes.\n\nAfter eating, massage the face to circulate the fluids. When full, eat less but more frequently to maintain a balance of hunger and satiety. After eating, avoid immediately engaging in strenuous mental or physical labor, as it shortens life.\n\nDo not wear damp or sweaty clothes for long. If the heart harbors affection, do not indulge it excessively; if it harbors aversion, do not deepen it—both harm the spirit and diminish longevity.\n\nThose under thirty should not consume tonics. At forty, practice gentle exhalation seven times. For those suffering from cold, swallow forcefully fifty times and gently thirteen times. The sounds of *yi*, *chui*, *xu*, and the like should be made with the breath resembling the pronunciation of the character.\n\nComb the hair a thousand times to regulate blood and qi. Firmly grasp the hair to strengthen the marrow. Frequently rub and pull the ears to solidify the flesh. Speak little to nurture the qi. Often knock and grind the teeth to strengthen the bones. Regularly remove the hairs inside the nose to connect with heavenly qi. Do not trim the nails too often to preserve the sinews’ qi.\n\nCold food harms the intestines; hot food harms the stomach.\n\nIn spring and summer, one may dwell in the mountains, where the air is clear and high—thus aligning with qi and preventing illness.\n\n**Method for Absorbing Saliva**\nPress the tongue against the upper palate until saliva naturally fills the mouth. Gargle and swallow it, uniting with the spirit. When absorbing, sit upright and visualize a child below with mouth open, guiding the saliva inward.\n\n*Collected Writings on the Shortcuts to Cultivating Perfection, Scroll Twenty-Four, Concluded*\n\n*Scroll Twenty-Five: Discourse on the Union of Heaven and Earth with the Spirit*\n\nThe Dao is emptiness and nothingness, natural and tranquil, effortless and non-doing—how could one learn from the whirlwind or storm and yet expect longevity? When harmonious qi converges, sweet dew descends, and the myriad things stir and grow—this is the natural Dao of Heaven and Earth, aligning with the mechanism of the sage, and the root of long life.\n\nThe nature of the foolish cannot fathom the profound mechanism by which the sage embodies the Dao. They indulge in endless desires, wearing away their finite bodies, thus becoming estranged from the great Dao. As before, they cannot escape the cycle of rebirth, changing forms and shells—is this not a grave error?\n\nWithin the human body, the heart corresponds to Heaven, the kidneys to Earth. The liver is the yang position, the lungs the yin position. The heart and kidneys are separated by eight inches and four fen, akin to the space between Heaven’s covering and Earth’s bearing. Qi corresponds to yang, and fluids to yin. The hours of *zi* and *wu* correspond to the solstices of summer and winter, while *mao* and *you* correspond to the equinoxes of spring and autumn. One day mirrors one year, and the eight trigrams’ hours mirror the eight solar terms.\n\nAt the *zi* hour, qi arises in the kidneys; at the *mao* hour, it ascends to the liver, where qi flourishes in yang, rising into the yang position—this mirrors the spring equinox. At the *wu* hour, qi reaches the heart, accumulating and generating fluids—this mirrors the summer solstice, when yang ascends to Heaven and yin begins to stir. At the *wu* hour, fluids arise within qi; at the *you* hour, they descend to the lungs, where fluids abound in yin, descending into the yin position—this mirrors the autumn equinox. At the *zi* hour, fluids reach the kidneys, accumulating fluids to generate qi—this mirrors the winter solstice, when yin descends to Earth and yang begins to stir.\n\nAs the sun and moon circulate in an endless cycle, if one can preserve and nurture the internal, without loss or depletion, one may naturally prolong life. When yin accumulates excessively, dew turns to frost and rain to snow. When yang accumulates excessively, mist becomes haze and clouds become rosy dawn. When yang lies hidden within yin, their clash gives birth to thunder and lightning; when yin lies hidden within yang, its solidity gives rise to hail and sleet. When yin and yang fail to unite, their opposition generates lightning; when yin and yang are disordered, their chaotic union transforms into rainbows.\n\nHeaven and Earth operate through transformation, and the Five Phases arise thereafter, forming the initial shapes of the myriad phenomena and the bodies of the four births. Among them, none surpasses humans in excellence. If one’s will can emulate the ancient worthies, one may augment one’s destiny and fortune. Thus, following the classics, the inauspicious days of each year are recorded.\n\nIn a year, there are seventy-two days of taboo, along with six *gengshen* days, six *jiazi* days, six days of one’s own life destiny, and one birthday—these should be meticulously noted. On these days, certain foods must be avoided.\n\nThe Five Pungent Foods are: scallions, leeks, garlic, shallots, and coriander. The Three Forbidden Foods are: crows (Heaven’s taboo), carp (Earth’s taboo), as well as oxen, tortoises, and turtles—consuming these is greatly forbidden, as it causes many illnesses.\n\nOn *wuxu*, *wuchen*, *wuyin*, *wushen*, *wuzi*, and *wuwu* days, one must not burn incense. During the day, one must not urinate facing south; at night, one must not face north. Those who disregard the taboo days will face myriad causes of death—not by Heaven and Earth’s killing, but by self-inflicted destruction.\n\n**Taboo Days by Month**\n\n**First Month:**\n- The first day: the Heavenly Center Festival.\n- The fifth day: the day when the five spirits of humans gather.\n- The seventh day: the day of Zhenwu’s descent.\n- The eighth day: the descent of the Southern Dipper Star Lord.\n- The thirteenth day: the Three Primordials’ Assembly of Sages.\n- The fourteenth day: the Three Officials’ Boundary.\n- The fifteenth day: the Three Officials’ Audience with the Emperor.\n- The eighteenth day: the Three Primordials’ Internal Memorial Day.\n- The nineteenth day: the Five Pestilences cause illness.\n- The twenty-second day: the Three Corpses’ spirits ascend to report on blessings.\n  *(The above days are suitable for rest.)*\n\n**Second Month:**\n- The second day: the Heavenly Correct Festival.\n- The sixth day: the birthday of the Central Spirit.\n- The eighth day: Zhenwu’s descent and the Three Primordials’ True Lords’ Audience at the Origin.\n- The fifteenth day: the sacred birthday of the Primordial Dao Ancestor.\n- The Spring Equinox (the second solar term): abstain from lust for five days, as the Six Qi transmit the second qi to the liver—avoid wine and lust.\n\n**Third Month:**\n- The third day: the birthday of the Dark Emperor.\n- The fourth day: the birthday of the Cultured Sage King.\n- The ninth day: Zhenwu’s descent.\n- The twenty-first day: the descent of the Heavenly Strategist.\n- The twenty-eighth day: the birthday of the Sacred Emperor of the Eastern Peak.\n  *(The above days are suitable for abstaining from wine and lust.)*\n\n**Fourth Month:**\n- This is the Pure Yang Month—abstain from lust for the entire month.\n- The seventh day: the day when the heart and kidneys’ qi are interconnected.\n- The eighth day: the Buddha’s birthday.\n- The Lesser Fullness (the fourth solar term): yang is external while yin is internal, the time when the third qi reaches the gallbladder—one may rest to preserve life and attain longevity.\n\n**Fifth Month:**\n- The third day: the Heavenly Correct Festival.\n- The fifth day: the Heavenly Toxin Festival.\n\n**Fifth Month:**\n- The third day: Zhenwu’s descent.\n- The seventh day: the day when the qi of Heaven and Earth intermingle and respond.\n- The sixteenth day: the day when the qi of Heaven and Earth converge, giving rise to the myriad things—most strictly abstain from wine and lust.\n- The twenty-second day: the birthday of the Central Radiance King.\n- The twenty-seventh day: the day when Heaven and Earth intermingle, the two qi taking form—strictly abstain from wine and lust.\n- Summer Solstice: human qi resides in the heart—abstain from lust.\n**Sixth Month:**\n- The sixth day: the birthday of the Steward of the Treasury, the day when death is recorded—strictly abstain from wine and lust.\n- The seventh day: the descent of Zhenwu.\n- The eighth day: the day when the Heavenly Origin Jiazi General descends to tour the six realms of the world.\n- Greater Heat (the twelfth solar term): the fourth qi reaches the stomach—rest to preserve life and attain longevity; abstain from lust for five days, lest stomach qi be harmed.\n- The twenty-fourth day: the Heavenly Origin Jiazi pays homage to the Origin—this day is suitable for burning incense and bowing toward the Northern Dipper at night.

Thus it is said: \"The high takes the low as its base.\" Like one drinking water, cool and warmth are known to oneself alone. Within the three fields, the cool places should be warmed, and the warm places cooled—what concern is this to others? Only the self knows one’s own body. Do not fear the arising of thoughts; only fear slow awareness. When a thought arises, if swiftly awakened to it, the thought vanishes with awareness. If thoughts arise swiftly yet one remains unawakened, peril follows.\n\nCurb anger and restrain desire—inscribe these upon the liver and spleen. What cultivation must guard against are these two: anger and desire. They damage and dissipate the true black, their harm profound. Curbing anger is inscribed upon the liver, for anger belongs to the liver; restraining desire is inscribed upon the spleen, for the spleen governs intention.\n\n**Poem on Chanting the Dao**\nNinefold divine essence returns to the Upper Origin,\nThe river chariot bears the load through the celestial circuit.\nThe Great Dao does not leave the square inch of the heart,\nA single path traverses the three fields.\n\n*Colophon: The twenty-fifth fascicle of* Swift Paths in the Ten Books of Cultivating the True *is hereby concluded.*",

      "translated_text": "**The Seventeenth Scroll of *Ten Books on Cultivating the True: Miscellaneous Shortcuts*\n**The Emerald Void Chapter**\n**Biography of Master Mud-Pill Chen Pu**\n**The Secret Formula of the Ninefold Golden Elixir**\n\n**First Transformation: Descending the Elixir**\n**Second Transformation: Union of Yin and Yang**\n**Third Transformation: Nurturing Yang**\n**Fourth Transformation: Nurturing Yin**\n**Fifth Transformation: Transmuting the Bones**\n**Sixth Transformation: Transmuting the Flesh**\n**Seventh Transformation: Transmuting the Five Viscera and Six Bowels**\n**Eighth Transformation: Cultivating the Fire**\n**Ninth Transformation: Ascending in Flight**\n\n---\n\n### **First Transformation**\nBeneath the tongue lie four apertures: two connect to the heart, two to the fluids.\n\nThe work of the first transformation resembles a precious pearl,\nPenetrating the mountains, rivers, and cosmos with a numinous body.\nBeneath the red lotus leaves lies the elixir cave;\nCrimson waters flow, perfusing the ninefold pearl.\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe work of the inner elixir begins with the One and is completed in the Nine. The One is that from which the myriad things are born. Heaven generates Water as the One; Earth generates Fire as the Two; Heaven generates Wood as the Three; Earth generates Metal as the Four; Heaven generates Earth as the Five. The sequence of the Five Phases arises from the One. Thus, the work of the inner elixir also begins with the One, transforming to completion in the Nine—for Nine is the utmost of yang numbers. When the number reaches Nine, the Dao’s fruit is achieved.\n\nThe phrase *\"resembles a precious pearl\"* refers to the True Water of Heavenly One stored in the gallbladder. When yin and yang harmonize and descend, they form the elixir. The initial descent appears like a single dewdrop of luminous pearl. The pearl signifies the reverence due to the elixir.\n\nMoreover, the human body is formed through the union of father’s essence and mother’s blood—this is *formal union*. The descent of the elixir arises from the union of heart-fire and kidney-water—this is *qi union*. Thus it is said: formal union gives birth to humans, while qi union gives birth to the elixir. After the elixir descends, the spirit roams beyond the mundane; yin and yang achieve great harmony. One forgets the body in seated oblivion, and the mountains, rivers, cosmos, six directions, and ten thousand things all reside within one’s own body. One’s body exists beyond the cosmos, sensing only a single point of radiance within the heart—this is the descent of the elixir. Hence it is said: *\"the mountains, rivers, and cosmos penetrate the numinous body.\"* The body encompasses the mountains and rivers within itself.\n\nThe *\"red lotus\"* refers to the tongue. The two apertures connect to the heart, and the two apertures connect to the fluids. When a person is ill, the tongue’s fluids dry, and their true qi is depleted. The first step of the first transformation is to seal the two apertures beneath the tongue, preventing the true qi from leaking outward and allowing the divine water to flow. The *\"crimson waters\"* are the fluids of the heart. At the outset of each of the nine transformations, on every ninth day, one inhales nine times, with nine breaths per inhalation. Naturally, the fluids flow and generate beneath the tongue, irrigating the five viscera—hence the name *\"ninefold pearl.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Lyrics to *\"Gazing at the Jiangnan\"*:**\nSeal the apertures beneath the tongue,\nTo circulate the gallbladder’s qi.\nThe Yellow Center’s treasure\nMust be sought within the gallbladder.\nSpring’s qi engenders the ten thousand things;\nHeaven and Earth lie beneath my knees, my peers.\nThe hundred vessels flow freely.\nCreation is enacted,\nAs the twin fires are drawn left and right.\nVast and boundless, they illuminate the cosmos;\nA bitter mist ascends, veiling the encircling towers.\nHusband and wife gradually conspire.\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe qi of Heavenly One is called the *Yellow Center*. This qi is stored in the gallbladder as the root of life and destiny. Its flavor is bitter, and thus the gallbladder’s qi is also bitter—just as the roots and blossoms of plants are bitter. From this, we know that nothing can be born without generative qi.\n\nThe medicine of the inner elixir first seals the apertures beneath the tongue, internally connecting to the gallbladder’s generative qi. When it reaches the space between the throat and tongue, a faint bitter taste is sensed—this is the circulation of the elixir’s qi. Then, the mercury-water congeals to form the elixir.\n\nThe generative qi of Heaven and Earth sprouts in spring. The ten thousand things receive this qi before they can be born. Humans receive generative qi, storing it in the gallbladder. When one circulates the gallbladder’s qi, the inner elixir is accomplished. The work of the first transformation resembles spring among the four seasons. As the generative qi ascends, a bitter sensation arises. When yin and yang achieve great harmony and the spirit dwells beyond the heavens, even the cosmos lies beneath one’s knees. A vast qi fills Heaven and Earth; the hundred vessels flow freely, and the myriad apertures open and close. This is the descent of the inner elixir.\n\n*\"Creation is enacted\"* refers to the initial steps. First, seal the two apertures beneath the tongue to prevent qi from leaking outward. The qi on the left side penetrates the left Greater Yang and enters the brain; the qi on the right penetrates the right Greater Yin and enters the brain. Both pass through the brain and enter the Mud-Pill Palace atop the head, merging into one. They descend through the twelve-storied tower of the throat, enter the heart meridian, and transmit to the gallbladder, unsealing the gallbladder’s aperture. This allows the gallbladder’s generative qi to ascend, following the heart and gallbladder meridians to the tongue’s apertures. When the tongue tastes bitterness, it is the influx of generative qi, signaling the imminent descent of the elixir.\n\nThen, firmly seal the tongue’s apertures. The qi on both sides ascends, creating a surging sensation. Once the gallbladder’s aperture is sealed, the generative qi wafts upward through the twelve-storied tower of the throat, rising from the apertures beneath the tongue. The mouth fills with bitterness—this is the circulation of generative qi.\n\n*\"Husband and wife\"* refer to yin and yang. The husband is yang; the wife is yin. When generative qi flows freely, yin and yang achieve great harmony, and the heart and kidneys unite. Thus, it is said they *\"gradually conspire.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Oral Instructions:**\nAt the outset of practice, one must first harmonize the five viscera through diet—neither hungry nor sated. The field of the heart must be tranquil, free from worry or distraction, before one may enter the Dao.\n\nAt the end of the second watch, at the beginning of the third, wash and rinse, settle the spirit, enter the chamber, burn incense, sit cross-legged, close the eyes, and concentrate the spirit. Wait until the breath is even, then first curl the tongue upward, sealing the two apertures at its root. Gradually, one will sense two streams of qi along the Greater Yang meridians, surging upward from the roots of the molars to penetrate the two Greater Yang points, then entering the crown of the head. When the two qi merge, count this as one cycle. Then close the eyes for a long while, and again curl the tongue as before, waiting until the qi reaches the Mud-Pill Palace. Perform this three times each night before stopping.",

      "translated_text": "After several nights or days of practice, one gradually senses the qi flowing from the Mud-Pill Palace into the twelve-storied tower beneath the brain, piercing the spine, threading through the tailgate, then surging forward to the heart, passing through the gallbladder and navel. The stomach feels gently warm, and a subtle harmony and ease arise—this is the true descent.\n\nAfter several more nights, the qi reaches the heart, which begins to feel mildly warm, or the heart’s qi stirs slightly. Then, a warm qi rises from the heart, passing the twelve-storied tower, and the mouth tastes faint bitterness—this is the Central Yellow qi emerging from the gallbladder. When yin and yang achieve great harmony, the descent of the elixir draws near.\n\nFrom this point onward, at the start of each night’s practice, have someone stand guard outside the door to prevent anyone from entering, or cats and dogs from startling you. When practicing two or three times each night, place a small table before you. If suddenly the qi surges, the body feels gradually expanding, the spirit soaring, and one perceives that houses, people, mountains, and rivers all lie within one’s own body, while hands and feet seem to vanish. Quickly press your hands on the table, close your eyes, and you will distinctly sense a luminous orb, round as the sun, at the heart’s center. Suddenly, it plunges into the cinnabar field—this is the descent of the elixir.\n\nAfter the elixir descends, do not open your eyes at once. Gradually gather the spirit, settle the four limbs, and restore them to stillness. If the hands or feet feel numb, wait until fully composed before opening the eyes. Then drink ginseng broth, sleep until morning, and take congee. Nourish yourself for one or two days, as if the elixir has descended.\n\nOnce the elixir descends, all illnesses vanish, and no suffering or affliction remains.\n\n**Second Cycle**\nThe second cycle begins with yang’s completion, weaving yin;\nKidney’s light and heart’s fluid merge as ding and ren.\nThe spirit-pearl, swift as lightning, returns to the Eastern Sea,\nIts radiant glow, in bursts, illumines purple gold.\n\n**Explanation:**\nAt the start of the second cycle, it is like a woman two months with child. The initial descent of the embryo is the true yang’s spirit forming the elixir. The heart, belonging to fire, is yin and corresponds to the southern ding fire—ding being fire’s yin. The kidneys, belonging to water, are yang and correspond to the northern ren water—ren being water’s yang.\n\nMaster Lü says:\n*Fire draws the cinnabar phoenix’s marrow from the south,\nWater seeks the black turtle’s essence from the northern sea.*\n\nThus, in the second cycle, one nurtures yang, allowing the heart’s fire-light to stir below. In the third cycle, one nurtures yin, enabling the kidney’s water-fluid to unite above. True water and true fire, above and below, pair as ding and ren, cradling the true elixir to complete the transformation.\n\nWhen the elixir first descends, it is nurtured in the heart, cultivated by true fire to quicken its growth. Once the first cycle succeeds, the elixir flows down from the heart’s network and is stored in the cinnabar field, where it is nurtured by true water—this is the work of the second cycle.\n\nAfter the elixir is stored in the cinnabar field, sitting in quietude within an empty chamber, one may suddenly perceive a luminous glow emanating from the embryo, like a golden orb—this is the moonlight.\n\n**To the Tune of \"Gazing at the Yangtze\"**\nThe dark pearl descends,\nThe elixir’s chamber lies within the Central Palace.",

      "translated_text": "Nine breaths harmonized, the count of nine repeated ninefold,\nCrimson waves may surge, bound by the solar plexus.\nHeart and kidney then commune.\nAt each sixth shift, six breaths compound the yin work.\nFire from the Sea Gate ascends to the Emperor’s Seat,\nWater from the lotus calyx aids Lord Ding.\nA purple lightning pierces the crystalline.\n\nExplanation: The dark pearl is the true elixir. At the first turning’s outset, the elixir descends into the heart’s network—hence, “the elixir’s chamber lies within the Central Palace.” Each descent marks one turning. After the elixir descends, whenever nine days pass, one closes the breath for nine breaths as one cycle, reaching nine nines—eighty-one—as nine cycles, thus called “the count of nine repeated ninefold.” When the nine nines’ work is complete, true yang elixir is full, flowing from the heart’s network into the cinnabar field, where the elixir is stored in the water palace to nurture its yin. The “solar plexus” is the water palace’s image, the cinnabar field’s kidney-water. The elixir’s spirit is stored in the heart to nourish true fire; the elixir’s turning returns to the kidney to nurture true water. With water and fire in harmony, yin and yang greatly balanced, this is called “heart and kidney commune,” the accomplishment of the second turning. At the third turning’s outset, at each sixth day, one closes the breath, six breaths as one cycle, six sixes—thirty-six—as one round, to nurture its yin, thus called “six breaths compound the yin work.” The Sea Gate is the cinnabar field’s kidney palace. When the true elixir is stored in the cinnabar field and the elixir’s yang number is full, at each noon, the spirit from the cinnabar field’s heat reaches upward to ascend to the heart. The Emperor’s Seat is the heart; the lotus calyx, the tongue. When the inner yin number of six sixes is full, then the lower lotus pool’s spirit-water irrigates the heart’s network to nourish the elixir’s qi—thus, “aids Lord Ding.” Ding is the heart’s fire. Here, true water and true fire achieve the work of harmony. With yin and yang in harmony and the true elixir’s qi full, at times a spirit-light emerges from the face and eyes. At midnight, sitting in stillness, one inwardly gazes at the viscera, inside and out distinct, directly perceiving the dark pearl nurtured in the cinnabar field—thus, “pierces the crystalline.”\n\n**Oral Instructions:**\nAfter the elixir descends and the first turning is complete, whenever the ninth, nineteenth, or twenty-ninth day arrives at noon, sit in quietude within an empty chamber, cross the legs, close the eyes, sit upright, and tap the teeth nine times. With spirit and qi communing, then close the breath. Each closure counts nine breaths as one cycle; open the eyes for a long while. Close the breath again as before, nine breaths as one cycle. At first, one or two closures may bring warmth; by the fifth closure, extreme heat arises. Using nine closures, continue without pause until the inner fire’s work is full, resonating with heaven and earth, regardless of distance. Or, when the breath reaches nine and the heart feels warmth, the four spirits harmonize and flourish, the heart-spirit stirs, and a stream of heat descends to the cinnabar field—this marks the second turning’s completion. Thereafter, do not practice the nine-breath count. The third turning...",

      "translated_text": "The third turning conducts yang into the left palace, where the Mystic Pearl’s fetal hue gradually brightens to crimson. The numinous fire nurtures and divides its forms, while celestial tones spur the work of creation.\n\nExplanation: Upon the third turning’s completion, when heaven’s yin movement arrives, one nourishes the true yin qi. Once the inner yin’s count is full, the elixir enters the cinnabar field and flows to the left flank, causing the four limbs to perspire and thereby restrain the corpse-qi. With the third turning’s work accomplished, the Three Worms are no more. The luminous pearl is the inner elixir. Thereafter, the yang qi becomes abundant, and even urine, nasal mucus, and sleep drool all take on a pink hue, corresponding to the pure yang essence. When the elixir’s radiance reveals a single bright pearl like a wheel of fire beneath the left knee, the third turning’s count is complete. At each month’s end, one uses the left hand to stroke the crown while drawing breath to stir the elixir fire, heating the five viscera—this is called nurturing the fire to circulate the elixir. From this point, the cinnabar field gradually feels as though it contains an object, and with each inhalation, the elixir stirs—hence the phrase “dividing its forms.” When heaven and earth harmonize, their stirring produces sound, known as the celestial tone.

      "translated_text": "The fetal hue gradually reddens as yin recedes, contracting and shifting with the year’s cyclical movement to aid yang’s firmness—nurturing the fire to cultivate the center. As the manifestation takes form, the fifth turning discerns the subtle and indistinct. Its ingress and egress remain slow, its form still small; at dawn and dusk, one drinks the jade potion’s nectar. The celestial tone plays the reed pipes.\n\nExplanation: When the third turning completes the yang count, the yin tortoise gradually contracts, and the intestines and stomach slowly coil. Within a month, there are ten movements of both stool and urine. One gradually enters the earth’s position, nearing the attainment of the Dao of no leakage. The *Qian* hexagram is wholly yang, symbolizing pure yang. Stroking the crown while drawing breath inwardly nurtures the fire; the elixir embraces the sacred embryo, which begins to take shape, though the five peaks remain incomplete. At the eighth turning, its form stirs like that of a small child of three or four inches, yet not distinctly visible. As yang qi is now full but has not yet nurtured yin, the sacred embryo possesses a soul but not yet a corporeal spirit—thus its ingress and egress remain slow, its form still small. When the sacred embryo takes shape, during seated meditation one constantly sees the radiance of the face and eyes, and the sweet dew of the bubbling spring flows forth. Drinking it, the seven orifices grow keen, and one hears the music of immortals.\n\nOral Instructions:\nAfter the elixir enters the left cheek, the work of the third turning is complete. On the sixth, sixteenth, and twenty-sixth days of each month—these three sixes—at midnight of the *zi* hour, one washes and rinses, enters a pure chamber, sits upright with legs crossed, and taps the teeth six times. Collecting the spirit and settling the qi, one closes the mouth and draws breath six times as one cycle, repeating this six times to finish. Within the month, performing this on the three sixes completes three full cycles. At midnight of the *zi* hour on the month’s last day, as before, one sits in the pure chamber with eyes closed and legs crossed. First, the left hand strokes the crown, while the right hand strokes the tailbone at the spine’s end, turning seventy-seven times (seven by seven, forty-nine). While stroking, one holds the breath tightly; when the count is complete, one rests briefly, then resumes when the qi settles. After doing this twice, one feels the qi of heart and kidney merging at the diaphragm, gently stirring the elixir qi, which fills the five viscera. When the five viscera grow warm as fire, it is the sign to activate the fire. On the three sixes or the month’s end, one may suddenly feel the elixir stirring beneath the left rib, with a faint thread of hot qi passing through the cinnabar field straight into the rib’s underside—its heat like fire, shaking for a long while before settling. This completes the work of the fourth turning. From this point onward, one no longer follows the heavy heaven’s count. The Fourth Turning.",

      "translated_text": "The inner infant nurtures into a crimson elephant,\nAt the hour of the fifth revolution, gather the yang essence.\nFire arises from water.\nBurning the ghostly mountain,\nPurple lightning surges, towering and majestic.\nRoaming freely within the seas of the world,\nAsleep like a long whale resting on sandy shoals.\nThe seasons move in harmony with it.\n\nExplanation: When the fifth revolution is complete, yin and yang numbers are fulfilled, and the mysterious pearl of the inner elixir suddenly emits a true fire from the right flank into the cinnabar field, roaring like thunder, blazing like flame. This is the pearl’s inner yin and yang returning to the cinnabar field to fulfill the fifth revolution’s position. Within the sacred embryo, the perfected one is accomplished, entering and exiting through the crown gate, over a foot in length. The third revolution nurtures yang, the fourth nurtures yin; when the inner yin and yang are both fulfilled, the cinnabar field’s work is complete. The fifth revolution seizes the creative power of heaven and earth, drawing the essence of the sun to perfect the path of outer yang cultivation—proceeding from inner to outer, following the natural order. Thus, after the fifth revolution, within a single month, on the days of the three nines, one draws the essence of the sun and moon to nurture the sacred embryo. The method of practice is to seek fire through water, seek yang through yin; when water and fire are in harmony, yin and yang achieve great balance—hence, \"fire arises from water.\" Ordinary people accumulate yin qi below the cinnabar field, calling it the ghostly mountain. When the body is wholly yang, the yin mountain and ghostly peak are incinerated, the yang palace is established, and the divine court is erected. Master Lü said: *\"The mountain-burning talisman makes ghosts hard to see.\"* This is what it means. The spirit moves at will, traveling the four seas, coming and going as one desires. In sleep, one recognizes the body; in waking, one knows its place. Moving the spirit out of the body, one observes one’s true form, like a long whale beyond the sandy shoals. After the fifth revolution, the creative work is complete, aligning virtue with heaven and earth, brightness with the sun and moon. The inner elixir’s creation moves in step with time.\n\nOral Instructions:\nWhen the inner elixir returns to the cinnabar field, the fifth revolution’s work is accomplished. When the inner yin and yang numbers are fulfilled, one must gather the outer yin and yang to complete the great Dao. Whenever encountering the ninth, nineteenth, or twenty-ninth day of each month—the three nines—at high noon, face south, sit cross-legged with eyes closed, and sit opposite the sun. Wait for the qi to settle, cut off nasal breathing, so that qi does not come or go, true yang is not lost, and fills the interior. The inner true fire communicates, and one feels the entire body suffused with redness, light filling the room. After one or two moments, a stream of true water from the cinnabar field, like a jade-like qi, rises straight to the heart, like nine floating water crystals above the heart. Then, close the eyes and open the breath, inhaling through the nose—eighty-one breaths in nine sets of nine—drawing them into the heart. Once the sunlight reaches the heart, one gradually feels the qi at the heart stirring, like a fish leaping in the cinnabar field. This is the great harmony of yin and yang, stopping at eighty-one breaths. Practice this for three years to complete it. After three years, cease gathering the sun’s essence and instead gather the moon’s radiance.\n\nSixth Revolution:\nThe sun has five colors over three years,\nThe moon has nine rays over one year.\nIn the sixth revolution, the cinnabar field plays with the moon’s radiance,\nTransforming the embryo’s hun and po, their shadows subtly vanishing.\nYang cinnabar changes the bones, yin dissolves the flesh,\nExchanging all for true suchness, flawless as jade.\n\nExplanation: When the elixir reaches the sixth revolution, inner and outer yin and yang are both complete, the sacred embryo fully formed, and the perfected one becomes one with the inner body. On every full moon night, one gathers the moon’s radiance to accumulate yin—hence, \"playing with the moon’s radiance.\" In the fifth revolution, true yang is complete, and the hun transforms into spirit; in the sixth, true yin is complete, and the po transforms into qi. With hun and po fully integrated inside and out, one roams within the sun, leaving no shadow, becoming one with the sun’s pure yang. Thereafter, ghosts and spirits cannot be seen, yin and yang cannot be fathomed, achieving the path of true immortality—hence, \"their shadows subtly vanish.\" The ordinary person’s impure bones and turbid embryo, with unclean yin and yang, cannot ascend to attain the Dao. When the perfected one’s elixir is complete, from the fourth to the fifth revolution, one gathers the sun’s essence into the cinnabar field to form yang cinnabar.

      "translated_text": "At each full moon, open the earthly gate,\nThe sacred tortoise drinks the azure jade’s essence.\nPure and clean as ice once more,\nYang cinnabar glows red,\nYin powder bears a faint blue-green hue.\nPowder replaces flesh, cinnabar replaces bone,\nThe ordinary embryo is wholly exchanged for the sacred embryo’s numen.\nAscending swift as a shooting star.\n\nExplanation: When yin and yang numbers are complete, the hun and po unite within and without, the body casts no shadow—this is the Dao of ascending as a perfected one. In the sixth revolution, at each fifteenth day, the internal and external water and fire achieve harmony to congeal yin powder, flowing in communion with heaven and earth’s creative transformations to nurture the sacred embryo’s substance. The \"sacred tortoise\" is the tortoise within kidney water. Master Lü said: \"The sea-tortoise child men do not recognize; the mountain-sealing talisman ghosts dare not behold\"—this is what it means. The moon’s radiant essence is gathered into the palace of divine water, and the sacred tortoise drinks it, becoming as pure and clear as jade, crystalline as formed ice. Yin powder arises within the northern pole, hence its likeness to the tortoise. Yang cinnabar is congealed from the sun’s essence, thus belonging to yang; its red hue likewise mirrors the sun. The color of yin powder is congealed from the moon’s radiance, thus belonging to yin; its blue-green hue mirrors the moon. When bone and flesh are wholly exchanged, the embryo’s interior transforms—muscle, bone, skin, and flesh all dissolve, entirely becoming immortal substance. The hun transforms to merge with spirit, the po transforms to merge with qi, all becoming cool and clear. Within the unified body, form and spirit are both wondrous, uniting with the Dao in truth. Those who study the Dao may preserve their spirit but cannot exchange their form, burdened by the body—thus when the spirit departs, the body cannot move; when the corpse remains, the form cannot be forgotten. Upon completing the six revolutions of the elixir, one exchanges the mortal form for immortal substance, where form and spirit are both wondrous. Wherever the spirit directs, the body follows, ascending to the nine heavens with the swiftness of clouds and stars.\n\nOral Instructions:\nUpon completing the six revolutions of the elixir, gather the moon’s radiance. At each full moon’s fifteenth night, at the midnight hour of *zi*, wash and rinse, then sit facing the moon. Close the breath and seal the mouth, cutting off the flow of respiration, ensuring true qi does not leak outward while the inner true qi fills the six palaces. The kidney’s true yin and the great yang’s essence—internal and external true qi—gleam like crystal, limpid and luminous. After one or two moments, the kidney’s true water stirs the heart’s fire, and the heart spirit rests within the lapis lazuli dish. Then gently open the eyes, release the breath through the nose, and facing the moon, inhale the moon’s qi into the cinnabar field, drawing eighty-one breaths before stopping. After half the breaths are drawn, the moon’s radiant true yin excites the true fire within the cinnabar field; water and fire harmonize like boiling water, the four limbs perspire, and the hundred vessels flow freely—ceasing at eighty-one breaths. Practicing thus for three years completes the work, advancing the achievement to the seventh revolution.\n\nSeventh Revolution:\nIn the seventh revolution, the body flies, the four limbs light,\nDivine radiance seals the breath, filling the cinnabar city.\nAfter a thousand mornings of grain abstention, fire naturally arises,\nThe *kun*-gate opens and closes, bathing the sea whale.\n\nExplanation: Upon completing the six revolutions of the elixir, yin and yang within and without are both fulfilled; mortal bones are exchanged for immortal bones, mortal flesh for immortal flesh. The four limbs and hundred bones harbor no mortal substance—the immortal body is light and pure, flight arising naturally. The inner elixir has refined the divine skeleton, thus the entire body is transformed. In the seventh revolution of the elixir, yin and yang within and without harmonize; one should seal the breath for ten mornings to fulfill the wondrous Dao’s function. Upon completing the seventh revolution, sealing the breath for a thousand mornings harmonizes yin and yang to perfection. When the thousand days are complete, spirit and qi unite, the five viscera are renewed, internal and external become pure and unified, the elixir’s radiance shines through the six palaces, and true fire illuminates the five interiors. The worms within the viscera and bowels transform into water; henceforth, the intestines and stomach are replete, free from the taint of smoke and fire, no longer consuming cooked food. One hungers for immortal fruits, thirsts for jade nectar, becoming unlike the worldly. After the inner elixir wholly transforms, the yin stem withers away, leaving but one aperture, called the *kun*-gate, symbolizing yin. Whenever the divine elixir’s fire flourishes, on the days of the three nines, one immerses the body in water, circulating the elixir pearl to emerge from the *kun*-gate, inhaling and exhaling to play in the water with freedom. After one or two hours, one returns the elixir to its chamber to temper the fire’s vigor.\n\n*Wang Jiang Nan*\nThe form penetrates the sun,\nIn the seventh revolution, soaring at will.",

      "translated_text": "Secluded in the depths of silent cliffs, one sits in tranquil repose, breath stilled without ebb or flow, qi firm and congealed. Grain is relinquished—such is its power. The fire of life refines, returning to the root, qi clarified and limpid.\n\nWhen bathing at the ninefold junctures, the earth-gate opens; from the moon one draws fire, from the sun seeks ice. The five viscera are renewed anew.\n\n*Exegesis:*\nAfter the seven revolutions, form and spirit attain perfection, the inner palace wholly transmuted into immortal vessels. Roaming at midday, the body becomes luminous, its hue like crimson jade, soaring and ascending through space, moving freely at will. In essence, one must harmonize inner and outer, allowing the radiance of sun and moon to converge in the heart and kidneys, water and fire, yin and yang interpenetrating, spirit and qi uniting in harmony. One retreats deep into mountain valleys, sitting in repose for hundreds of days, sealing the nostrils to sever the breath, so that primal harmony congeals and settles. Then the inner self is replete, no longer consuming the dust of the mortal world, thereby realizing the Dao of carefree wandering.\n\nAs for the relinquishing of grain and abstention from food—this is a wondrous art and extraordinary Dao. With breath sealed for a thousand days, the divine fire stirs within, scouring away the qi of grain, eradicating all craving for food. Returning to the root and restoring the origin, embracing the One and guarding stillness, hence it is said: \"returning, qi is clarified and limpid.\"\n\nWhenever the divine fire stirs, the five viscera grow hot; one then enters water on the days of the three nines to purify the true elixir. Resplendent as a wheel of fire, it emerges from the earth-gate—hence it is said: \"the earth-gate opens.\" The moon is the emblem of yin; the divine fire is a thing of utmost yang. The gate is the yin aperture, through which yang light passes, issuing from the yin cavern of the earth-gate—hence it is said: \"from the moon one draws fire.\" The sun is the emblem of yang; the divine water is a thing of utmost clarity. The tongue is the yang aperture, through which the divine water flows, issuing from the yang cavern of the tongue’s orifice—hence it is said: \"from the sun seeks ice.\"\n\nAt the fifth revolution, the bones are transformed; at the sixth, the flesh; at the seventh, the five viscera. The five viscera are the five sacred peaks—hence it is said: \"the five viscera are renewed anew.\"\n\n*Oral Instructions:*\nWhen the elixir reaches the seventh revolution, one must depart the mortal world and enter the depths of mountains or the seclusion of cliffs and valleys. Sitting in repose, sealing the breath, one severs the spirit, mouth, and nostrils from the ebb and flow of respiration, allowing true yin and true yang to merge within the abdomen, seizing the creative power of heaven and earth and returning it to the four limbs. After a thousand days, the five viscera are wholly transformed, the fetal qi transmuted into an immortal palace. One then senses the aperture at the crown of the head opening, emitting black and crimson qi—this is the dispersal of fetal qi. When the thousand days are complete, the aperture at the crown closes—this signifies the full expulsion of fetal qi and the fulfillment of the seventh revolution.\n\nThereafter, the five viscera become solid and impervious, no longer accepting the taint of smoke and fire. Should the elixir fire within the viscera flare, one enters water, seals the nostrils, and allows the elixir pearl and divine fire to emerge from the earth-gate, floating upon the water’s surface like a cow playing with yellow. Only when the divine water beneath the tongue flows like a spring does the elixir fire subside. One then draws the elixir pearl back into the earth-gate, continuing until the eighth revolution and the completion of the earthen belt, after which the fire’s toxicity ceases and bathing is no longer required.\n\n*The Eighth Revolution*\nAt the eighth revolution, the earthen belt hangs low, returning to the origin;\nCirculating fetal breath, one nurtures the infant.\n*(Partial lacuna)*\nAt times, fire flares, scorching the elixir chamber;\nPlunging deep into icy springs, one plays with the crimson turtle.\n\n*Exegesis:*\nWhen the infant lies within the mother’s womb, enveloped in the fetal sac, its qi is settled and cannot enter or exit, thus suffering no harm. If the infant’s navel connects to an umbilical cord, held in its mouth, the breath flows ceaselessly—this is the natural fetal breath, hence no harm befalls it. After the elixir reaches the eighth revolution, an umbilical cord-like belt forms at the navel, resembling the infant’s state, returning to the Dao of its original beginning—hence it is said: \"the earthen belt hangs low, returning to the origin.\"\n\nThe infant, possessing the umbilical cord, practices fetal breathing and suffers no harm; the perfected one, possessing the earthen belt, circulates the qi of the celestial revolution and thus attains longevity. The crimson turtle is the elixir pearl. After the eighth revolution, one refines the true fire within, eliminating its heat and toxicity. Whenever fire flares, one grasps the earthen belt and seals the breath for nine days. On the ninth day, true water surges from the elixir field like a gushing spring, rising to the twelve-storied tower. The elixir pearl plays within this divine water like a turtle frolicking in the waves. Thereafter, the true fire is free of toxicity, and the elixir’s heat no longer stirs—hence it is said: \"At times, fire flares, scorching the elixir chamber; plunging deep into icy springs, one plays with the crimson turtle.\"\n\n*Wang Jiang Nan*\nTransformed within and without,\nThe eighth revolution begins the return to the origin.",

The earthen belt connects to the mouth, circulating the breath of the celestial cycle to regulate the fire’s timing—hence called the \"circulating breath.\" The Dao of the Great Beginning generates the inception of heaven and earth; when the elixir completes its eighth revolution, it resembles the primordial creation of heaven and earth. The inner elixir is pure yang, without a trace of yin qi—hence called \"a body of pure unity.\" Crimson and black are the qi of the spirit-fire; when the elixir completes its eighth revolution, it arises from the heart and constantly enters and exits through the nose, where one perpetually sees the two qi of crimson and black—hence it is said: \"qi ever spout forth.\" The breath of the cinnabar fire moves the divine water to restrain it, and thereafter, the cinnabar fire’s timing no longer arises.

After closing the breath, the true water of the elixir field gradually grows day by day.

      "translated_text": "The human body has both the pharynx and the larynx: the pharynx swallows food, while the larynx conducts qi. These two passages, though distinct, lie close together—the larynx in front, the pharynx behind. The larynx governs the intake and expulsion of breath, while the pharynx merely swallows. The character for \"larynx\" (喉) derives from \"marquis\" (侯), for what exits from within is conveyed outward through the larynx, and what enters from without is conveyed inward through it. What we call exhalation follows the Yang as it departs; inhalation follows the Yin as it enters. The pharynx, however, only swallows when there is something to swallow, hence the character for \"pharynx\" (咽) includes the element \"cause\" (因). The pharynx corresponds to Earth-qi and serves as the conduit of the stomach, connecting downward to the gastric cavity as the passage for water and grain. From the pharyngeal gate, food enters the stomach, making the pharynx a critical juncture, also called the \"mute gate.\"\n\nThe larynx corresponds to Heaven-qi and serves as the conduit of the lungs, linking downward to the lung meridian as the pathway for respiration. From the laryngeal passage, breath reaches the lungs. The lungs have no lower orifice but are hollow within, distributing the clear and turbid qi through the trachea. Below the lungs lies the heart, and beneath the heart, the diaphragm adheres to the spine, encircling and shielding the heart and lungs from the upward fumigation of turbid qi—this is what is called the \"chest center\" (膻中). Below the diaphragm lie the spleen, stomach, liver, and gallbladder.\n\nThe spleen, associated with Earth, rests above the stomach, connected to it by membranes, thus supporting the stomach. The liver, associated with Wood, responds to the exhalation of Yin before it retreats, hence its governance is on the left, though its position is on the right. Below the stomach lies the small intestine, to the right of which is the large intestine, and beside the large intestine, the bladder.\n\nThe small intestine is the \"official of reception and transformation,\" where essence is extracted. All the fermented and ripened water and grain in the stomach—its qi ascends from the stomach’s upper opening, the \"cardiac orifice\" (贲门), to the lungs, where it is distributed throughout the body. Its waste and turbidity descend from the stomach’s lower opening, the \"pyloric orifice\" (幽门), into the small intestine. From the small intestine’s lower opening, the \"ileocecal valve\" (阑门), the water is separated and enters the bladder, while the waste proceeds into the large intestine. The large intestine, with its four bends, receives the grain from the small intestine—it is the \"official of transmission.\"\n\nThe bladder, also called the \"bladder sac\" (胞), is hollow to receive water and serves as the repository of fluids. Thus, it is said: the bladder is the chamber of the bladder sac. When the bladder’s function is impaired, it causes strangury; when its restraint fails, it leads to enuresis.\n\nHearts vary—some are large, some crooked, some straight, some with orifices, some without—no two are alike. The true heart is not susceptible to evil; when affliction arises, it is the heart’s envelope (心包) that is affected—this is what is called the \"Hand Reverting Yin\" (手心主). It lies above the transverse membrane beneath the heart and below the firm membrane, adhering to the transverse membrane. The yellow fat that envelops it is the true heart. Beyond this fatty layer, fine membranous threads like silk connect to the heart and lungs—this is the pericardium.\n\nLivers may have one lobe, two lobes, or three lobes. The kidneys are two, the dwelling place of essence. They govern the primordial qi (元气), shaped like paired kidney beans curving along the spine. Externally, they are wrapped in fat—white on the outside, purple within—with two threads ascending to the heart and descending to the kidneys, forming a single circuit. This is what is meant by \"Kan in the north, Li in the south, water and fire interacting.\"\n\nThough the kidneys are two, one is called the \"Gate of Life\" (命门), opposite the navel. The *Huangting Jing* states: \"The two water sovereigns face the Gate of Life,\" and also: \"Behind lies the secret gate, before lies the Gate of Life.\" The Gate of Life is the navel. When an infant is in the womb, it draws qi through the umbilical cord—when the mother exhales, the infant exhales; when the mother inhales, the infant inhales—directly opposite the secret gate. Such is the nature of the navel, and it does not differ from the *Yanluozi Illustrations*.\n\nIn recent times, when criminals were executed in the marketplace and dissected, some claimed there were three passages in the throat—one for water, one for food, and one for qi—this is a grave error. Others asserted that one kidney lies slightly below the liver’s right side, and the other slightly above the spleen’s left side, thereby dismissing the *Yanluozi’s Illustration of Morning Audience with the True*. How could they know that when the Foot Reverting Yin (足厥阴) is afflicted, the tongue curls and the testicles retract—let alone the terror of the blade and saw?\n\n**Yanluozi’s Scripture of Inner Observation**\nHeaven and Earth unite their essences, and the myriad things are transformed and born. When father and mother join, a person comes into being. In the first month, it is a blastocyst; in the second, an embryo; in the third, the soul forms; in the fourth, the corporeal soul forms; in the fifth, the organs divide; in the sixth, the bowels divide; in the seventh, the orifices open; in the eighth, the spirit is complete; in the ninth, the essence is fixed; in the tenth, the qi is full.\n\nAt birth, the spirit’s source is pure and untainted. Once it inhabits form, the form is stained by the six emotions: the eyes covet color, the ears cling to sound, the mouth indulges in flavor, the nose receives fragrance, the mind harbors envy, and the body desires plumpness and lightness. From this, one drifts and wanders, unable to awaken. The sages, in their compassion, teach one to inwardly observe the self and settle the heart. When the heart is settled, the spirit is still; no chaotic thoughts intrude, no evil delusions assail, and all worries and afflictions dissolve. The empty chamber generates brightness—this depends solely on settling the heart.\n\n**Oral Formula for Guarding the Nine Palaces**\nThe head has nine palaces, corresponding above to the nine heavens and below to the nine earths. The body has nine orifices and twelve towers. Between the two eyebrows, one *cun* inward, lies the Palace of the Bright Hall (明堂宫), where the Lord of the Great One (太乙君) resides. To the left is the Purple Chamber, to the right the Vermilion Gate, clad in brocade and appearing like an infant—this is the master of the body’s form.\n\nTwo *cun* inward lies the Palace of the Grotto Chamber (洞房宫), where three perfected ones dwell: on the left, the Peerless One (无英); on the right, the White Prime (白元); and in the center, the Yellow Cloud. Three *cun* inward lies the Palace of the Cinnabar Field (丹田宫); four *cun* inward, the Palace of the Flowing Pearl (流珠宫); five *cun* inward, the Palace of the Jade Emperor (玉帝宫).\n\nOne *cun* above the Bright Hall lies the Palace of the Heavenly Court (天庭宫); one *cun* above the Grotto Chamber, the Palace of the Utmost Perfected (极真宫); one *cun* above the Cinnabar Field, the Palace of the Mysterious Cinnabar (玄丹宫); one *cun* above the Flowing Pearl, the Palace of the Heavenly Sovereign (天皇宫).\n\n**Treatise on the Three Cinnabar Fields and Three Elixir Fields**\nWithin qi, spirit is born; the spirit resides in the Upper Elixir Field...",

shines in the deep abyss.\nWhite snow is refined into crimson water,\nAnd the fire dragon plows the field of mushrooms.\n\n26\nThe supreme Dao is not bound by *zi* or *wu*;\nThe effortless Way asks not of dawn or dusk.\nIf you seek the three flowers to gather at the crown,\nFirst let the five qi return to the origin.\n\n27\nEmerging from the azure, entering the profound—how radiant!\nAll returns to the gate of the mysterious female.\nIf you truly desire long life without death,\nI urge you to cultivate Kunlun.\n\n28\nLet the spirit terrace hold no single thing;\nGather the spirit back into the spirit.\nBefore the twelve towers, spring waters flow—\nThe red dragon’s snowy waves grind the void.\n\n29\nHow could the numinous being ever fall ill?\nThe nine orifices and hundred bones are naturally at peace.\nIf illness arises, no medicine is needed—\nSimply turn inward and contemplate.\n\n30\nThe wondrous work circulates without cease;\nWhy rely on the river chariot for transport?\nThe elixir’s spark is ever present—\nNaturally, cinnabar forms in the golden crucible.\n\n31\nTo study the Dao, one must accumulate hidden virtue;\nOtherwise, obstacles and demons will arise.\nIf you have planted roots in past lives,\nYou will naturally harmonize with fortune’s power.\n\n32\nGuangcheng lived twelve hundred years,\nPreserving the one and abiding in harmony.\nYesterday, there was an infant boy and a maiden girl—\nTheir union must be aided by the yellow matron.\n\n33\nUntil all beings attain Buddhahood,\nDo not grasp at this clod of earth.\nThis Dao, though diverse in paths, is one in essence—\nLaozi is none other than Gautama.\n\n34\nThe Tathāgata’s teaching is all-pervading;\nWith a tranquil mind, observe the whiteness at the tip of the nose.\nWhen the message of body and mind becomes inwardly luminous,\nThis is the foremost in perfect penetration.\n\n35\nForget the feet, forget the waist, forget the heart—\nThe one nature is serene and ever still.\nYan Hui could forget what was to be forgotten,\nThus he could attain his proper state.\n\n36\nA short life and death are not misfortune—\nIt is but the spirit’s journey beyond the shell.\nEven if one is heaven-endowed, a general or sage,\nOne must still yield to those who transcend.\n\n37\nZhongli’s *Lingbao Bifa*\nGuides true cultivation to transcendence.\nEarnestly and clearly, it instructs the learner—\nThe only hindrance is the inability to practice.\n\n38\nThe learner must seek a renowned teacher,\nYet such teachers are rare in the world.\nWhen the time for cultivation is ripe,\nImmortals will naturally come to aid.\n\n39\nChen Tuan’s spirit soared beyond his withered form,\nThough his worldly merits were not yet complete.\nAlone, he returned to Penglai’s clouds—\nOnly when the three thousand deeds are fulfilled can one ascend.\n\n40\nLearner, beware of excessive sleep,\nFor in dreams, all manner of demons may enter.\nIf you wish to preserve true essence,\nHook out the poisonous snake from your heart.\n\n41\nIn studying the Dao, do not be greedy for much—\nDiligently and sincerely guard the one.\nThe *Lingyuan Zhi* states:\nOnce attained, do not lose it in favorable times.\n\n42\nWhen you feel cold, first put on clothes;\nWhen you sense warmth, gradually shed them.\nSit away from dampness, thieves, and drafts;\nAvoid raw, cold, and hard foods.\n\n43\nPure yin without yang is called a ghost;\nPure yang without yin is called an immortal.\nLord Lü was named the Pure Yang Master—\nThus he achieved his celestial destiny.\n\n44\nThe great Dao is like walking the correct path;\nTo walk blindly is to enter many detours.\nGather your spirit and bring it to its abode—\nWithout emptiness, you cannot avoid stumbling.\n\n45\nBravery with cunning harbors scheming;\nOnly when settled can one respond.\nUse your will undivided to concentrate the spirit,\nFulfill your nature to reach the mandate.\n\n46\nTo comprehend principles, one must understand adaptability;\nWithout adaptability, clinging to the mean is futile.\nThe sage is cautious in what he affirms—\nWith adaptability, all methods become accessible.\n\n47\nDwelling in a humble alley, he did not alter his joy;\nUnperturbed all day, he seemed like a fool.\nDetached from form, transcendent, and self-forgotten—\nThis is the way of the immortal and the leaping Confucian.\n\n48\nThe learner must first clarify the true one;\nBegin by recognizing the root and origin.\nThe root is like the root of a tree;\nThe origin is like Kunlun’s peak.\n\n49\nWithin the yang dragon’s qi is true liquid;\nWithin the yin tiger’s liquid is true qi.\nWhen the two intermingle and harmonize,\nThey form the true embryo, the crimson child.\n\n50\nWithin two vessels, a single scene—\nPulling nine oxen up the mountain.\nAscend the peak to attain long life;\nLose your footing, and you wait at the gate.\n\n51\nThe metal wind blows the yang within *kan*—\nThis is the origin of

of the germ.\nIn the third month, the yang spirit becomes the three *hun*, moving to give life.\nIn the fourth month, the yin numen becomes the seven *po*, stillness to stabilize form.\nIn the fifth month, the Five Phases divide into the five viscera to settle the spirit.\nIn the sixth month, the Six Pitch Pipes determine the six bowels to nourish the numinous.\nIn the seventh month, the Seven Essences open the seven orifices to connect with luminosity.\nIn the eighth month, the Eight Effulgences of the spirit descend in full, the true numen.\nIn the ninth month, palaces and chambers are arrayed to secure essence.\nIn the tenth month, qi is full, and the myriad images are complete.\n\nWithin are the five viscera,\nExternally corresponding to the Five Phases.\nThe Classic states:\nAt the beginning of conception, the two kidneys are generated—\nThe left is called *xuan*, *xuan* ascends qi and transmits it upward to the liver;\nThe right is called *pin*, *pin* receives fluids and transmits them downward to the bladder.\n*xuan* and *pin* originate from nonbeing,\nTransforming nonbeing into being—\nThis is the true qi of father and mother received into the realm of pure yin.\nThus it is said: “The valley spirit does not die, this is called *xuan-pin*;\nThe gate of *xuan-pin* may be compared to the root of heaven and earth.”\nFrom the kidneys, the five viscera are generated, and the six bowels reside therein.\n\nThe liver is called the Azure Dragon of Wood, located on the left,\nWhere *Wu-Ying* dwells, governing the three *hun*.\nIts qi ascends along the left

of life.\nIts qi ascends along the left side of the chest into the tongue, then enters the heart, transforming into blood—\nThis is called True Fire.\nThe remaining qi flows into the left side beneath

      "translated_text": "Here follows the translation:\n\n---\n\nThis is also the method of the Sevenfold Return to the True. First, moisten the entire body, then one can generate water; when water flourishes, it generates saliva; when saliva flourishes, it transforms into blood; when blood flourishes, it refines essence; when essence flourishes, it replenishes the brain; when the brain flourishes, it strengthens qi; when qi flourishes, the spirit becomes whole.\n\nThe human body corresponds to the generative numbers of the Five Phases. Above the heart lies the Nine Heavens; below the kidneys lies the Nine Earths. From the kidneys to the heart measures eight *cun* and four *fen*; from the heart to the first ring of the *chonglou* and thence to the crown measures eight *cun* and four *fen*—this is called the *Niwan* and *Jianggong*, where the Supreme One, the Lord of Emperors, resides, governing all spirits. From the kidneys to the crown totals two *chi*, five *cun*, and two *fen*, comprising eighty-one *zhang* of primordial qi, corresponding to the pure yang number of nine nines.\n\nIn a full day and night, the water clock descends one hundred *ke*. Each *ke* is divided into sixty *fen*, totaling six thousand *fen*. In every ten *fen*, a person’s breath undergoes twelve and a half cycles of ingress and egress. Within these hundred *ke*, heaven rotates left while earth turns right; human qi and blood harmonize with the Three Powers, and *ying* and *wei* circulate the upright qi of heaven and earth.\n\nOne exhalation and one inhalation constitute a single breath. The meridians open and close, breath flows in and out, and in the span of day and night, there are thirteen thousand five hundred breaths, with exhalation and inhalation in perfect balance. What is exhaled is one’s own primordial qi, issuing from within; what is inhaled is the upright qi of heaven and earth, entering from without. When the root is firm and robust, and primordial yang remains undiminished, one can seize the upright qi of heaven and earth between breaths.\n\nThe pure becomes *ying*, the turbid becomes *wei*, all flowing unimpeded; the transverse are the *luo*, the vertical are the meridians, all attaining free circulation. Thereafter, cold and heat cannot invade, toil and hardship cannot harm; the body is strong, the bones are sturdy, the qi is fresh, and the spirit is clear. One becomes a person of unaging vitality, forever preserving boundless longevity.\n\nThe True Dragon and True Tiger are *Kan* and *Li*, heart and kidneys. When Dragon and Tiger unite in intercourse, they refine the Golden Elixir. As the *Neijing of Heavenly Treasure* states: \"The Infant and the Alchemical Maiden, their qi merging in the *Huangting*,\" this is the way. When merit is accomplished and conduct perfected, one becomes an immortal, attaining the Dao of longevity and deathlessness.\n\n---\n\n*The Mirror of Heavenly Origin and Human Elixir*\nBy the Perfected Master Cui Xifan\n\nIn my youth, I wandered as a cloud upon the waters and once encountered a perfected one who discoursed on the extensions of nurturing life. To grasp the essentials of Dragon and Tiger, one must know the Three Rivers’ blessed land, the wondrous realms and sacred altars, endure the trials of mist and rosy clouds, and traverse the traces of all sages. Often, when meeting those who initiate the Dao, we mutually recognize the resonance of bells.\n\nThough I have not personally tended the tripod and furnace, I have slightly unveiled the mysteries and compiled the secret methods of the Heavenly Origin, revealing the wondrous Dao of Dragon and Tiger, the root-source of Lead and Mercury. May fellow seekers of the Dao peruse this with fortune.\n\nOriginally, when the Great Simplicity divided, darkness descended upon the myriad things, binding them to life and death. The dead do not comprehend life; the living retain form, while the dead lose their bodies. Life and death may be relinquished to merge with the Dao and unite with the True.\n\nLife arises from spirit, is governed by essence, and flourishes through things. Of all things, humans are the most numinous. The body is the root of spirit’s transformations; essence in humans is like a boat afloat on water, qi in humans is like wind scattering dust, and spirit in humans is like a wild horse galloping across the sky. When water stills, the boat halts; when wind ceases, dust settles; when the wild horse scatters, the great emptiness endures forever.\n\nEssence can secure things, qi can flourish things, and when essence, qi, and spirit unite as three, the heart may remain unmoved. In their transformations, one forgets the outer form and nurtures the inner spirit—this is the path to ascending as a perfected one.\n\nWhen desires run rampant in the heart, who can long abandon them? When sorrow and joy wound the will, when thoughts and worries labor the spirit, who can long forget them? When wealth and rank weary the body, who can long relinquish them? When the five flavors corrupt essence, who can long restrain them? When wine and sweet liquor disorder essence, who can long abstain? Indulging in fine foods, drinking fine wine, gazing upon beauties, listening to lewd sounds—though one’s essence and qi may be strong, they bring calamity upon the body; though the ears and eyes may delight, they lead to chaos in the spirit.\n\nWith a hundred paths to ruin the Dao and not a speck of hope for the True, how can one witness the efficacy of nurturing life? Those who study the Dao outwardly do not let their intent chase after things, and inwardly do not let their intent follow the heart’s chaos. Serenely, they preserve emptiness and stillness, attaining the realm of purity and tranquility. It is like the labor of building a house: even borrowing a moment’s form and qi, one must still rest the spirit to return to clarity—how much more so when aligning with the Dao and preserving the True Elixir!\n\nJi Kang said: Immortality must be attained through effort and learning, depending on the natural endowment of qi. Like the cicada shedding its husk, sitting in forgetfulness, corpse-liberation, womb-entering, and soul-seizing methods; the essence of Lead and Mercury, the wonders of *Kan* and *Li*; riding the wind, chasing the rain, soaring through the clouds, treading upon water—such as the Yellow Emperor transforming into a dragon to depart the world, or the people of Qin riding phoenixes to ascend into emptiness—those who study and then become immortals have existed from ancient times to the present. How could one attain immortality without such arts?\n\nBorn within the world, knowing the ways of immortals, and extending to those beyond the world—these are the worthy, the remote, the resolute. To learn without ceasing is to be worthy; to be worthy without ceasing is to be a sage; to be a sage without ceasing is to be a spirit; to be a spirit without ceasing is to be vast and empty, surging beyond the cosmos, emerging between heaven and earth.\n\nExternally, yin and yang unite to generate form; internally, they generate spirit. The heart is the master of spirit, illuminating the obscure without fail, penetrating the stagnant without hindrance. Guard silence and settle the heart; when the heart is settled, qi harmonizes; when qi harmonizes, essence congeals; when essence congeals, the spirit becomes numinous; when the spirit is numinous, it communicates with the True.\n\nIn sleep, if one dreams, the spirit is still enslaved to its objects; once the heart labors over its thoughts, even in dreams, the heart does not attain its natural tranquility. When primordial qi descends and fortuitously aligns with the principle of emptiness, this is called the perfected one who dreams not.",

      "translated_text": "Those who cultivate the inner elixir align the body with the crucible, model essence and qi upon lead and mercury, and liken Kan and Li to water and fire. The numinous spirit forms the essence, manifesting the marvels of transformation. Over time, essence refines into qi, and the numinous spirit, suffused with essence, sheds the bodily form—akin to the floating and sinking of lead and mercury.\n\nThe heart governs fire, and fire governs qi; qi governs life. It is gained through the heart and lost through the heart. Fire is the pivot of life and death. When the heart scatters essence and stirs qi, one must preserve clarity and purity.\n\nCultivating the elixir resembles a dragon nurturing its pearl or a pregnant woman carrying her child: every movement is guarded, lest harm befall it. Only when the work is complete and the inner signs manifest does the elixir’s power reveal itself. If the heart is disordered and the will corrupted, if the body is wearied and the spirit harmed, the true embryo will wither and dissipate. As Laozi said, it is like holding a vessel brimming full—seek within the heart, never without.\n\nThe sun and moon are the supreme essences of heaven and earth; Kan and Li are the great medicine of the human body. Thus, the sage observes the external to know the internal, illuminating the workings of numinous transformation. The pearl in the clam’s womb, the hare’s pregnancy, the rhinoceros horn, the magpie’s limbs, the toad’s neck, the turtle’s shadow, the offspring of the mantis and the cicada—all are conceived without the union of qi or the mingling of essence, but through the heart’s intent communicating with the spirit. Therefore, the *Book of Changes* states: \"Abiding in stillness, yet responsive and penetrating—who but the supremely refined can achieve this?\" It defies description.\n\nEven lowly creatures like dogs and horses instinctively grasp the mystery of the \"mysterious pass,\" steadfast in heart and resolve, shedding form and transcending substance. How much more should the most numinous of beings—masters of life-nurturing arts and the methods of longevity—embrace the principle of \"obscurity and tranquility\"? Those who carve their bones and wash their hearts, who cherish the resolve to refine gold and stone, who honor their teachers and befriend the wise, disregard wealth or poverty, honor or disgrace, right or wrong, and remain untouched by worldly affairs—how could they, even for a moment, forget the Dao?\n\nNeglecting small deeds will eventually erode great virtue. To attain immortality, one must first establish unwavering resolve and accumulate great virtue. How profound these words are!

Elusive! Yet within it, something.”\nNaturally, flowers bloom in water—\nAs Xihua said: “In water, flowers bloom, their fragrance lingering through the four seasons.”\n\nSimply take the phoenix marrow from the Southern Palace,\nAs the poem of Master Lü says: “Below, use the crimson dragon’s marrow.”\nDo not follow the sheep-cart beyond the gate—\nThe *Lotus Sutra* speaks of sheep-carts and deer-carts, now

Vairocana—\nVairocana, a Buddhist term.\n\nIf one wishes to refine form into qi,\nOne must teach mercury to transform into cinnabar—\nAs the *Bi Fa* says: “Refining form into qi makes one an earthly immortal.”\nIt also says: “Mercury transforms into cinnabar,\nLead transforms into the golden elixir.”\n\nBefore *Tongxuan*, there was Yellow Valley—\nThe Yellow Emperor met the Master of Yellow Valley,\nWho said: “There are other words of *Tongxuan*.”\nIn cultivating the true, there is also Blue Mist—\nMaster Blue Mist attained the Dao and left his instructions for a thousand generations.\n\nPush carefully into the two teachings—\nDaoism and Buddhism.\nThe difference between long life and extinction is vast.\n\nTo burn the body in vain pursuit of śarīra—\nThe seven

      "translated_text": "**On Essence**\n\nEssence is a singular thing. Embracing the One unites with essence; abandoning the One severs from essence. When essence is born, qi is whole; when qi is whole, spirit is whole—spirit thus governs the hun and stabilizes the po. Essence is that by which Heaven and Earth and the myriad things are generated. Yet essence constantly governs man, while man constantly dissipates it. When the apertures leak without measure, one dries within and dies. Death is not essence’s abandonment of man—man abandons essence himself. As Zhuangzi said: “One who does not abandon essence is called a spirit-man.” Thus, to lose control of essence is to forfeit numinosity, sinking into a lower ghost. Yet those who preserve it—how could this be within the reach of the ordinary?\n\n**Preserving Spirit and Essence**\nEssence is the root of spirit; qi is the master of spirit; form is the dwelling of spirit. Thus, overusing spirit exhausts it; overusing essence depletes it; overworking qi severs it. Therefore, that by which man lives is spirit; that by which form is sustained is qi. If qi declines, form wastes away—how can one seek long life then? That which exists arises from the nonexistent; form stands through spirit. The existent is the lodging of the nonexistent; form is the dwelling of spirit. If one does not preserve the dwelling to secure life, cultivate the body to nurture spirit, then qi will scatter and return to emptiness, the wandering hun transforming without end.\n\nConsider the candle: when the wax is spent, the flame cannot abide. Compare it to a dyke: when the dyke breaks, water cannot remain. When the body labors, spirit disperses; when qi labors, life ends; when form emaciates, spirit perishes; when spirit perishes, the refined essence wanders. Once departed, the wanderer has no return; once decayed, there is no principle of rebirth. Thus, spirit is the hun; the po is yin. Spirit can master qi; form can consume flavors. When qi is pure, spirit is clear; when form labors, qi is turbid. Those who ingest the elixir do not die in a thousand or ten thousand years—their bodies ascend to Heaven. Those who eat grains die in a thousand or ten thousand years—their forms return to Earth.\n\nWhen man dies, his form returns to Earth; his hun returns to Heaven; his po descends to the springs. Water and fire disperse, each returning to its source. In life, they share a single body; in death, they part ways—floating and sinking differ, allotted by nature. Consider a single piece of wood set aflame: smoke rises, ash sinks—this too is the principle of nature.\n\nSpirit and luminosity are the root of generation and transformation; essence and qi are the substance of the myriad things. Preserve form to nourish essence and qi, and one’s nature and life will endure.\n\n**The Three Mao Lords’ Formula**\nNurture spirit with qi; gather qi into spirit. When spirit and qi do not scatter, this is called cultivating the true. The child does not leave the mother; the mother does not release the child. Mother and child guard together—long life without death.\n\n**Lü the True Man’s Minor Achievement in Daoist Practices**\nWhenever one wishes to cultivate and nurture, one must first purify the chamber and burn incense, adjusting for warmth and cold, discerning dryness and dampness. Each night after midnight, when generative qi arises, or upon waking at the fifth watch, first exhale the turbid qi from the abdomen—whether nine times or five or six—then settle the mind, close the eyes, and click the teeth thirty-six times to gather heart and spirit.\n\nNext, rub the backs of the thumbs over the eyes, nine times for each, and press the sides of the nose seven times. Rub the hands until they are thoroughly warm, then close the mouth and nose to hold the breath. Rub the face without counting the repetitions—this is the method for the true person’s daily practice.\n\nThen press the tongue against the upper palate, swish the saliva inside and outside the mouth until it fills, divide it into three gulps, and swallow, visualizing it entering the stomach where the stomach spirit receives it. Do this three times for a total of nine swallows, thereby irrigating the five viscera and brightening the complexion. Though this is a secondary method, its power is great—do not take it lightly.\n\n**Visualizing and Swallowing Qi**\nThe lower Cinnabar Field lies three inches below the navel. Behind it are two cavities leading up the spine to the Mud Pill Palace. With each swallow, swiftly visualize the lower Cinnabar Field receiving the original qi, then use intention to blow and guide it into the two cavities. Close the eyes and imagine two streams of white qi flanking the spine, passing through the twenty-four joints, surmounting the Three Passes, and ascending straight into the brain—the Mud Pill Palace, called the upper Cinnabar Field. There, the qi steams through all the palaces, vigorously entering the hair, face, beard, eyebrows, hands, and fingers. Exhale once, and guide it downward into the chest, reaching the middle Cinnabar Field.\n\nThe middle Cinnabar Field is the heart. Visualize the qi irrigating the five viscera, then descending through the lower Cinnabar Field to the Bubbling Spring cavity. The Bubbling Spring is the center of the soles. This is what is meant by steaming the flesh, unobstructing the meridians from head to foot, regulating with a single qi, stirring like thunder, moistening like wind and rain. Just as Heaven and Earth have springs, without the movement of thunder, there would be no way to nourish the myriad things; just as the human body has fluids, without irrigation, there would be no way to moisten the five viscera, emit radiance, return essence to replenish the brain.\n\nThe way of immortality is called the inner elixir. Without exhalation and inhalation, one cannot guide and employ it. Thus, the principle of circulation and the workings of application are modeled on Heaven and imitate Earth. Visualize the turbid, stagnant, perverse qi and stagnant blood within the body all being scoured away by the upright qi, expelled through the tips of the hands and feet—this is called dispersing qi. Extend the fingers without clenching the fists. Each such cycle is called one passage; when the passages are unobstructed, there is no illness. Then regulate to restore balance and repeat the swallowing as before.\n\nHolding the breath and swallowing qi up to thirty-six times is called minor achievement. If one has not yet ceased taking grains, one should proceed thus far, eating sparingly to keep the abdomen empty. Whether sitting or otherwise, whenever the abdomen feels hollow, swallow the qi. From dawn to dusk, do this ten times, and the qi will naturally flow. Three hundred sixty swallows is called middle achievement; one thousand two hundred swallows is called great achievement—this is the great embryonic breathing.",

When full, eat less but more frequently to maintain a balance of hunger and satiety. After eating, avoid immediately engaging in strenuous mental or physical labor, as it shortens life.\n\nDo not wear damp or sweaty clothes for long.

      "translated_text": "The Dao is emptiness and nothingness, natural and tranquil, effortless and non-doing—how could one learn from the whirlwind or storm and yet expect longevity? When harmonious qi converges, sweet dew descends, and the myriad things stir and grow—this is the natural Dao of Heaven and Earth, aligning with the mechanism of the sage, and the root of long life.\n\nThe nature of the foolish cannot fathom the profound mechanism by which the sage embodies the Dao. They indulge in endless desires, wearing away their finite bodies, thus becoming estranged from the great Dao. As before, they cannot escape the cycle of rebirth, changing forms and shells—is this not a grave error?\n\nWithin the human body, the heart corresponds to Heaven, the kidneys to Earth. The liver is the yang position, the lungs the yin position. The heart and kidneys are separated by eight inches and four fen, akin to the space between Heaven’s covering and Earth’s bearing. Qi corresponds to yang, and fluids to yin. The hours of *zi* and *wu* correspond to the solstices of summer and winter, while *mao* and *you* correspond to the equinoxes of spring and autumn. One day mirrors one year, and the eight trigrams’ hours mirror the eight solar terms.\n\nAt the *zi* hour, qi arises in the kidneys; at the *mao* hour, it ascends to the liver, where qi flourishes in yang, rising into the yang position—this mirrors the spring equinox. At the *wu* hour, qi reaches the heart, accumulating and generating fluids—this mirrors the summer solstice, when yang ascends to Heaven and yin begins to stir. At the *wu* hour, fluids arise within qi; at the *you* hour, they descend to the lungs, where fluids abound in yin, descending into the yin position—this mirrors the autumn equinox. At the *zi* hour, fluids reach the kidneys, accumulating fluids to generate qi—this mirrors the winter solstice, when yin descends to Earth and yang begins to stir.\n\nAs the sun and moon circulate in an endless cycle, if one can preserve and nurture the internal, without loss or depletion, one may naturally prolong life. When yin accumulates excessively, dew turns to frost and rain to snow. When yang accumulates excessively, mist becomes haze and clouds become rosy dawn. When yang lies hidden within yin, their clash gives birth to thunder and lightning; when yin lies hidden within yang, its solidity gives rise to hail and sleet. When yin and yang fail to unite, their opposition generates lightning; when yin and yang are disordered, their chaotic union transforms into rainbows.\n\nHeaven and Earth operate through transformation, and the Five Phases arise thereafter, forming the initial shapes of the myriad phenomena and the bodies of the four births. Among them, none surpasses humans in excellence. If one’s will can emulate the ancient worthies, one may augment one’s destiny and fortune. Thus, following the classics, the inauspicious days of each year are recorded.\n\nIn a year, there are seventy-two days of taboo, along with six *gengshen* days, six *jiazi* days, six days of one’s own life destiny, and one birthday—these should be meticulously noted. On these days, certain foods must be avoided.\n\nThe Five Pungent Foods are: scallions, leeks, garlic, shallots, and coriander. The Three Forbidden Foods are: crows (Heaven’s taboo), carp (Earth’s taboo), as well as oxen, tortoises, and turtles—consuming these is greatly forbidden, as it causes many illnesses.\n\nOn *wuxu*, *wuchen*, *wuyin*, *wushen*, *wuzi*, and *wuwu* days, one must not burn incense. During the day, one must not urinate facing south; at night, one must not face north. Those who disregard the taboo days will face myriad causes of death—not by Heaven and Earth’s killing, but by self-inflicted destruction.\n\n**Taboo Days by Month**\n\n**First Month:**\n- The first day: the Heavenly Center Festival.\n- The fifth day: the day when the five spirits of humans gather.\n- The seventh day: the day of Zhenwu’s descent.\n- The eighth day: the descent of the Southern Dipper Star Lord.\n- The thirteenth day: the Three Primordials’ Assembly of Sages.\n- The fourteenth day: the Three Officials’ Boundary.\n- The fifteenth day: the Three Officials’ Audience with the Emperor.\n- The eighteenth day: the Three Primordials’ Internal Memorial Day.\n- The nineteenth day: the Five Pestilences cause illness.\n- The twenty-second day: the Three Corpses’ spirits ascend to report on blessings.\n  *(The above days are suitable for rest.)*\n\n**Second Month:**\n- The second day: the Heavenly Correct Festival.\n- The sixth day: the birthday of the Central Spirit.\n- The eighth day: Zhenwu’s descent and the Three Primordials’ True Lords’ Audience at the Origin.\n- The fifteenth day: the sacred birthday of the Primordial Dao Ancestor.\n- The Spring Equinox (the second solar term): abstain from lust for five days, as the Six Qi transmit the second qi to the liver—avoid wine and lust.\n\n**Third Month:**\n- The third day: the birthday of the Dark Emperor.\n- The fourth day: the birthday of the Cultured Sage King.\n- The ninth day: Zhenwu’s descent.\n- The twenty-first day: the descent of the Heavenly Strategist.\n- The twenty-eighth day: the birthday of the Sacred Emperor of the Eastern Peak.\n  *(The above days are suitable for abstaining from wine and lust.)*\n\n**Fourth Month:**\n- This is the Pure Yang Month—abstain from lust for the entire month.\n- The seventh day: the day when the heart and kidneys’ qi are interconnected.\n- The eighth day: the Buddha’s birthday.\n- The Lesser Fullness (the fourth solar term): yang is external while yin is internal, the time when the third qi reaches the gallbladder—one may rest to preserve life and attain longevity.\n\n**Fifth Month:**\n- The third day: the Heavenly Correct Festival.\n- The fifth day: the Heavenly Toxin Festival.",

      "translated_text": "The ultimate cultivation lies in returning essence to replenish the brain, with the cinnabar field as its foundation. Thus it is said: \"The high takes the low as its base.\" Like one drinking water, cool and warmth are known to oneself alone. Within the three fields, the cool places should be warmed, and the warm places cooled—what concern is this to others? Only the self knows one’s own body. Do not fear the arising of thoughts; only fear slow awareness. When a thought arises, if swiftly awakened to it, the thought vanishes with awareness. If thoughts arise swiftly yet one remains unawakened, peril follows.\n\nCurb anger and restrain desire—inscribe these upon the liver and spleen. What cultivation must guard against are these two: anger and desire. They damage and dissipate the true black, their harm profound. Curbing anger is inscribed upon the liver, for anger belongs to the liver; restraining desire is inscribed upon the spleen, for the spleen governs intention.\n\n**Poem on Chanting the Dao**\nNinefold divine essence returns to the Upper Origin,\nThe river chariot bears the load through the celestial circuit.\nThe Great Dao does not leave the square inch of the heart,\nA single path traverses the three fields.\n\n*Colophon: The twenty-fifth fascicle of* Swift Paths in the Ten Books of Cultivating the True *is hereby concluded.*",
