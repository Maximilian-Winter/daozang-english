  "full_translation": "**Essence of the Scripture of Numinous Signs**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Essence of the Scripture of Numinous Signs*. Author unknown. Two chapters in one scroll. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, Section Zheng Yi.\n\nIn the time of Duke Ping of Jin, there was a Daoist minister named Shi Kuang, who expounded the subtle and wondrous divine methods from the *Scripture of the Heavenly Elder*, penetrating the omens of the unseen and the future, and imparting them to the Duke. Upon witnessing them, the Duke could foresee all matters beforehand. This was because virtue had been bestowed, and the Dao of Heaven bestowed its scrutiny. To demonstrate and transmit this to later generations, all Daoists in the world would come to know it. Moreover, even the books of the *Three Heavens and Nine Essentials* have flowed down to the earthly realm. Having studied and understood the One, how could the Way of cultivating life not be clearly illustrated, becoming an eternal scripture for preserving life? Those who hear and cultivate the Dao—noble ones of today—have now extracted the essentials from the sagely teachings, compiling them into a single scroll. Illuminating the preceding scriptures to glorify the sagely Dao, it is thus named the *Essence of the Scripture of Numinous Signs*.\n\nThe three luminaries of Heaven are the sun, moon, and stars. The three luminaries of humans are the ears, eyes, and heart. The spirit dwells in the heart, and its numinous penetration is supreme. Observing the hidden and discerning the bright, the spirit possesses knowledge. What Heaven knows is revealed through the auxiliary stars. What humans know is observed through the radiance of the spirit. By examining the stars and observing the radiance, one may foreknow what lies ahead. The principle of preserving the body lies in scrutinizing its signs. The concealments of the will must not be seen by the vulgar. The division of yin and yang is Heaven’s gift. To sustain the body and prolong life, one must be vigilant and enduring. By examining the brightness of the stars, one perceives auspicious omens. When many see clearly yet one remains blind, misfortune leads to ruin. Within seven days, calamity is certain.\n\nObserve the radiance of the spirit—it is the flaw in the eye. Pressing it with a finger verifies the spirit’s response. A greenish hue portends illness; red signifies virtue. White indicates mourning or injury; yellow heralds joy. Black suggests treachery or theft—discern its truth. If pressing yields no radiance, misfortune and death are certain. A kalpa marks the appointed time; scrutinize the turning of the hours. One arrival and seven departures clarify the reckoning. Unchanging by the appointed day, one foreknows the radiance. These trustworthy signs are the candle of the unseen.\n\nWhen the Six-One spirit stirs, one must observe the response. Internal and external scrutiny transform misfortune into fortune. The liver corresponds to internal officials; all others follow likewise. Within the twelve hours, sneezing, yawning, restlessness, and agitation; heat in the face and eyes, confusion and disorientation; fragrances, stenches, and pungent odors—all forewarn of startling events. One must focus on bodily signs, for the spirit discerns them. Sourness, pain, itching—heed their messages. Twitching, stabbing, piercing—recognize their omens. Ringing in the ears, palpitations, trembling, and quaking. Observing the radiance and acting swiftly, follow the brightness for good fortune. Choosing safety and abandoning peril, one must judge for oneself. In walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, be mindful day and night. To the left and right, before and behind, seek clarity. Where there is no radiance, do not go. Crossing water without radiance ensures drowning. Lodging in mountains without radiance—do not stay, for there will surely be collapse or sinking.\n\nWhen traveling without radiance, do not proceed. Wherever there is no radiance, do not remain. Taking a different path to observe the radiance confirms its correctness. Seeking water when thirsty follows the same principle. Before battling an enemy, scrutinize and observe. Red radiance brings victory and joy; white radiance brings injury. Yellow radiance appearing ensures promotion in rank. If there is no radiance, death awaits on the battlefield. Food without radiance must be poisoned. If the heart stirs and the nose sours, and the radiance departs, those who conspire together intend harm—it is best to avoid them. If the heart stirs, the nose itches, and the cheek twitches, this signals a thief. Preserve the radiance to verify it. If the radiance reveals blackness, the words are not false.\n\nA single twitch followed by blackness reveals the number of times to observe. Prepare defenses in advance to avoid danger. When the tongue stirs and the navel trembles, the heart also quakes. If the lips twitch and one feels disoriented, the spirit’s radiance departs. If a son intends harm to his father, swift precautions must be taken. When the elbow twitches and the radiance fades, a concubine plots treachery. If the palm twitches and the radiance departs, a relative is the thief. When the heart flutters anxiously and the radiance stirs, a younger brother schemes against his elder—treacherous and wicked. A twitch beneath the right foot signals official matters underway; beneath the left foot, private affairs proceed. If the heart stirs and the cheek twitches, the radiance leaves the eyes. Friends who turn to thievery must not be associated with. When the heart flutters anxiously and the eyes twitch urgently, and the spirit’s radiance vanishes, harm befalls one on the Dao. If a wife has an affair, she secretly meets another—if she also intends harm, take strict precautions. When the heart stirs and one feels disoriented, the feet cannot stay still. Guard above and below, for soldiers are about to divide. If hearing suddenly fails, the spirit’s radiance has departed—rise quickly and flee. If someone intends harm, evasion averts disaster. A twitch in the sole of the foot signals thieves on both sides; defend left and right to secure front and rear. If the ears ring and the heart stirs, the spirit’s radiance conceals itself—others plot against you, but no harm will come. A twitch in the right eye concerns others’ affairs; in the left eye, one’s own matters. If the ears ring and the nose sours, superiors find fault. While traveling on the road, sudden terror arises. When the heart quivers and trembles, and the feet ache, thieves will surely come to rob. Trust in Qibo’s discernment to identify the thief. On *jia-yi* days, observe their form: tall stature, greenish complexion, apricot-shaped eyes. On *bing-ding* days, the thief is quick-tempered: medium build, ruddy face, eloquent. On *wu-zi* days, unkempt hair and a yellow hue; stout and large-bellied, this is their true nature. On *geng-xin* days, the lips are flawed; fond of hunting, dignified and pale. On *ren-gui* days, tall and dark; sharp-witted, examine carefully to distinguish. The Duke of Zhou and Confucius never forgot this method. Since ancient times, superior scholars have practiced it. Their fragrant names resound across the world, proclaimed as sages. Emperor Gao of Han’s heart stirred—Bo Ren plotted against him. Thanks to the manifest spirit’s radiance, disaster was averted. Lord Xiang’s horse startled—a hidden assassin lay in wait. Observing the radiance to avoid evil proved the horse’s trustworthiness. A child’s sorrow foretells a return to heaven. Ringing ears and deafness bring grief and sorrow. Clenching both hands summons thunder. The sacred method of the *Yellow Court* naturally turns one back. Radiance conceals in the eyes, essence in the yin, sound in the ears, qi in the nose. When all four signs converge, it is an omen of death.\n\n*The Spirit-Sign Scripture of the Perfected Liu Gen*\nThe Master said: If the right ear rings in the morning, there will be joyful news; if it rings in the evening, a woman’s affair arises. If the left ear rings in the morning, the same applies; if it rings in the evening, one will encounter wine, a feast, or a joyful event. If the upper or lower lid of the right eye twitches at dawn or dusk, it bodes well for parents’ happiness. If the upper or lower lid of the left eye twitches, all matters will be joyful.
