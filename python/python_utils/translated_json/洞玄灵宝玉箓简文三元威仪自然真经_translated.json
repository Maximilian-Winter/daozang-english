Author unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin or Southern Dynasties period.

From the era of Dragon Han to the first year of Red Clarity, the Supreme Sages compiled and edited them, extracting the essentials for practical use. Thus, eighty articles were transmitted to the perfected below who were destined for the Dao, and these are now in circulation.\n\nThe *Divine Immortals* section of the *Middle Prime Jade Register Abridged Text* states: In honoring the master’s dignified observances, one should burn incense.

originally comprised three parts—Upper Prime, Middle Prime, and Lower Prime—each containing eight hundred articles on dignified observances, totaling two thousand four hundred articles across the three parts. All were inscribed in gold and jade characters, and the Left Duke of the Immortals’ Capital compiled them in the Middle Prime Palace. After the Dragon Han era, they sank into chaos, their texts altered and largely incomplete. In the first year of the Vermilion Brightness, the Supreme Sages edited and collated them, extracting essentials into eighty articles per part, totaling two hundred forty articles across the three parts, which were then concealed in the Three Prime Palaces. Two hundred forty Jade Maidens of the Golden Dawn and two hundred forty Golden Lads of the Jade Morn were assigned to burn incense and attend the scriptures, inspecting for omissions and negligence. According to the mysterious statutes, they are transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas. When divine perfected beings descend to teach, the cycle of transmission is accelerated, requiring true persons to descend and instruct the world every four hundred years, with permission granted for three transmissions within forty years. If the allotted time is not fulfilled and the numinous texts are lightly disseminated, one’s seven ancestors will be imprisoned in hell, bearing the wind’s blades for ten thousand kalpas without release.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: Natural dignified observances are the bearing of all heavens and the ritual standards of perfected beings. Those who behold them possess the karmic conditions of a hundred million kalpas, their former lives having borne names inscribed on golden tablets and jade registers, destined for transcendence among the ranks of divine immortals. Thus, they encounter these texts to fulfill their authenticity. Those who cultivate them will ride dragon chariots and ascend at dawn; those who uphold them will enable their seven ancestors to depart hell and ascend to heaven, roaming freely in the Jade Immortals’ Palace of the Middle Prime, where gates and households remain serene, untouched by the ten thousand calamities, revered by the three realms, and attended by the ten thousand spirits at their gates.\n\nThe Dao is most revered and noble—it ought to be kept sacred and concealed.\n\nThe Most High bows in reverence, offering obeisance to receive these essential words.\n\nHere ends *The Wondrous Scripture of the Three Primes’ Dignified Observances: The Authentic Classic of the Dao’s Spontaneous Majesty from the Cavernous Mystery, Numinous Treasure, and Jade Registers of Simplified Texts*.",

master, when disciples experience joyous occasions, the master should rejoice and offer wishes, that the Dao may be accomplished and virtue flourish, with boundless blessings flowing forth.\n\nThe *Divine Immortals* section of the *Middle Prime Jade Register Abridged Text* states: In the dignified observances of being a master, when disciples bear sorrow, the master should console and receive them, keeping them in mind morning and evening as if they were one’s own.\n\nThe *Divine Immortals* section of the *Middle Prime Jade Register Abridged Text* states: In the dignified observances of being a master, when disciples face calamity or illness, the master should establish oratories, offering prayers morning and evening to accumulate merit and virtue, delivering them from disaster and suffering.\n\nThe *Divine Immortals* section of the *Middle Prime Jade Register Abridged Text* states: In the dignified observances of being a master, when expounding and disseminating the transformative teachings of the Dao, one should ensure that all four ranks of disciples are treated equally, their hearts and minds unified without harboring duplicity.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy addressed the Most High Lord of the Great Dao, saying: The *Divine Immortals* section of the *Jade Register Abridged Text of the Middle Prime Palace of the Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure* originally comprised three parts—Upper Prime, Middle Prime, and Lower Prime—each containing eight hundred articles on dignified observances, totaling two thousand four hundred articles across the three parts. All were inscribed in gold and jade characters, and the Left Duke of the Immortals’ Capital compiled them in the Middle Prime Palace. After the Dragon Han era, they sank into chaos, their texts altered and largely incomplete. In the first year of the Vermilion Brightness, the Supreme Sages edited and collated them, extracting essentials into eighty articles per part, totaling two hundred forty articles across the three parts, which were then concealed in the Three Prime Palaces. Two hundred forty Jade Maidens of the Golden Dawn and two hundred forty Golden Lads of the Jade Morn were assigned to burn incense and attend the scriptures, inspecting for omissions and negligence. According to the mysterious statutes, they are transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas. When divine perfected beings descend to teach, the cycle of transmission is accelerated, requiring true persons to descend and instruct the world every four hundred years, with permission granted for three transmissions within forty years. If the allotted time is not fulfilled and the numinous texts are lightly disseminated, one’s seven ancestors will be imprisoned in hell, bearing the wind’s blades for ten thousand kalpas without release.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: Natural dignified observances are the bearing of all heavens and the ritual standards of perfected beings. Those who behold them possess the karmic conditions of a hundred million kalpas, their former lives having borne names inscribed on golden tablets and jade registers, destined for transcendence among the ranks of divine immortals. Thus, they encounter these texts to fulfill their authenticity. Those who cultivate them will ride dragon chariots and ascend at dawn; those who uphold them will enable their seven ancestors to depart hell and ascend to heaven, roaming freely in the Jade Immortals’ Palace of the Middle Prime, where gates and households remain serene, untouched by the ten thousand calamities, revered by the three realms, and attended by the ten thousand spirits at their gates.",
