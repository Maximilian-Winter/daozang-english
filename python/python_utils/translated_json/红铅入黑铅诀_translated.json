  "full_translation": "**The Red Lead Entering Black Lead Formula**\n\nTrue gold forges the divine chamber; its form resembles a parrot.\nThe red lead is concealed within the chamber, sealed with native earth to close its seams,\nthen encased entirely in a layer one finger thick.\nPlace it within the crucible.\nThe lower crucible is made of native earth, the upper cauldron of true gold.\nSeal the outer seams and suspend it within the furnace.\nApply water and fire, and in ninety days it will be complete.\n\nBlack lead is called \"precelestial lead.\" When native black lead is placed in an ash pit,\nits black husk is stripped away, leaving it utterly refined—this is the \"nine-times-smelted essence.\"\nIts transformations are boundless, its marvelous applications without limit.\n\n**The Crucible Formula**\n\nNative earth may resemble greasy yellow wax or be dark greenish-black.\nWhen ground and washed, it may contain grit or sand,\nor resemble sesame seeds of varying sizes.\nSome yellow earth, when crushed, reveals cinnabar—this earth is most potent.\nPound and sift it, then knead it into clay, thoroughly and skillfully, to craft the crucible.\nIts total length is one foot two inches, its circumference one foot five inches.\nThe hollow center is five inches wide, the walls one inch and one *fen* thick.\nThe upper and lower openings are straight, with lips like an overturned wok,\nthe circumference measuring three feet two inches.\nThe central cross-section is one foot wide, the rim encircling it two inches high.\nWater enters the crucible to a depth of eight inches.\n\n**The Mercury Entering the River Chariot Formula**\n\nCombine half a *jin* of yang mercury with eight *liang* of yin mercury,\nplace them in the crucible chamber, and seal according to the method.\nSelect the four destructive phases for restraint.\nOn a yang day at a yang hour, apply the direct talisman.\nPosition the fire one inch beneath the crucible’s base, cover it, and activate.\nConstantly conceal it with straw ash, burying it firmly.\nWhen the direct talisman is in effect, follow the six-phase advance-and-retreat formula.\nUse native earth for the divine chamber and true gold within it,\nthen pour mercury to seal it securely.\nPlace it in the crucible cauldron and apply water and fire to transform the River Chariot.\n\nCombine half a *jin* of yang mercury with eight *liang* of common mercury,\nplace them in the crucible cauldron, and seal.\nConstruct an altar ring and bury it in ash, with the ash five inches thick.\nDirect the fire upward from the top.\nBegin with five *liang*; after one *fu* period, add thirteen *liang*;\nafter another *fu* period, increase to one *jin*.\nOne version: Follow this weight precisely, applying it day and night for thirty days.\nTake two *liang* to refine one *jin* of mercury, yielding two *liang* of \"white-way silver.\"\nThen use it to further refine one *jin* of copper into \"great silver.\"\n\n**The Crucible Cauldron**\n\nKnead native earth into clay and shape it like a parrot:\nseven inches long, five inches wide.\nWhile still moist, cut it into sections and dry them in the sun.\nEach opening is three inches wide, tapering gradually to a point two inches deep at the base.\nThe exterior is also parrot-shaped.\nCraft the two halves with interlocking male and female lips, ensuring no misalignment.\nThis crucible is suitable for both civil and martial applications.\n\n**Qi and Fire Timing**\n\nAt midnight (zi): three *liang*\nAt early morning (yin): four *liang*\nAt mid-morning (mao): five *liang*\nAt early afternoon (si): six *liang*\nOne version: At noon (wu): six *liang*\nAt early evening (shen): five *liang*\nAt mid-evening (you): four *liang*\nOne version: At early night (hai): three *liang*\n\n**Golden Liquid Fire Timing**\n\nThe fire count is one *jin*, and the water count is also one *jin*.\nFor every one part fire, there are fifteen parts water; for every six parts water, there are ten parts fire.\nWhen the fire count is clear, water recedes; when water rises, fire diminishes.\nThe six hours of *zi, chou, yin, mao, chen,* and *si* belong to yang and are the time for advancing fire.\nThe six hours of *wu, wei, shen, you, xu,* and *hai* belong to yin and are the time for retreating fire.\nDivide one *jin* into 384 *zhu*.\nFor advance and retreat within a single day, adjust by sixty-four *zhu* per hour—\nadvance must be steady.\nOne version: Retreat should also be gradual, carefully regulating the balance.\nWith single-minded focus, refine the returning elixir.\n\n**The Direct Talisman Six-Phase Advance-and-Retreat Formula**\n\nThe moon has six phases, each lasting five days.\nTwo *qi* divide into two and a half days, thirty hours per *qi*.\nTwo *qi* make one phase, six phases make one month.\nEach month, replace the crucible’s earth and divine chamber.\nAfter nine months, the nine crucibles are complete.\nOne version: Up to ten crucibles may be used as desired, whether replacing the crucible or not.\nOne version: The first turning is most wondrous.\n\n**First Month, First Day:**\nFirst phase: Ignite with one *liang* of fire.\nBy the second and a half day (thirty hours), advance to two *liang*; by sixty hours, maintain.\nSixth day:\nSecond phase: Begin with three *liang* at thirty hours, advance to four *liang* by sixty hours.\nEleventh day:\nThird phase: Begin with five *liang* at thirty hours, advance to six *liang* by sixty hours.\nSixteenth day:\nFourth phase: Begin with six *liang* at thirty hours, retreat to five *liang* by sixty hours.\nTwenty-first day:\nFifth phase: Begin retreating with four *liang* at thirty hours, reduce to three *liang* by sixty hours.\nTwenty-sixth day:\nSixth phase: Begin retreating with two *liang* at thirty hours, reduce to one *liang* by sixty hours.\n\n**Second Month, First Day:**\nFirst phase: Ignite with two *liang* of fire.\nBy the second and a half day (thirty hours), advance to three *liang*; by sixty hours, maintain.\nFor each subsequent month when replacing the crucible,\nincrease the fire by one *liang* per phase compared to the previous month.\nBy the ninth month:\nFirst phase: Begin with nine *liang*, advance to ten *liang* by thirty hours, maintain by sixty hours.\nSecond phase: Eleven *liang* at thirty hours, advance to twelve *liang* by sixty hours.\nThird phase: Thirteen *liang* at thirty hours, advance to fourteen *liang* by sixty hours.\nFourth phase: Fourteen *liang* at thirty hours, retreat to thirteen *liang* by sixty hours.\nFifth phase: Retreat to twelve *liang* at thirty hours, reduce to eleven *liang* by sixty hours.\nSixth phase: Retreat to ten *liang* at thirty hours, reduce to nine *liang* by sixty hours, completing the cycle.\nFrom the tenth month onward, maintain this pattern.\nOne version: Use the ninth month’s fire timing for advance and retreat as the standard, regardless of year or month.\n\nThe regulation of fire’s advance and retreat requires the addition of well-burned charcoal, always exposing the fire’s surface to align with the prescribed weight. Below are the formulas for ingesting elixirs and refining mercury by weight:\n\nAfter fifteen days of guarding and circulating, one *liang* of medicine transmutes one *jin* of mercury into the White Way.\nAfter thirty days of guarding and circulating, two *liang* may be ingested.\nAfter one year of guarding and circulating, half a *liang* of medicine transmutes one *jin* of mercury into the White Way. Ingesting one and a half *liang* wards off all illnesses.\nAfter two years of guarding and circulating, one *fen* of medicine transmutes one *jin* of mercury into the White Way. Three *fen* may be ingested, and one may also ingest half a *liang*.\nAfter three years of guarding and circulating, a *daogui* of medicine refines one *jin* of mercury into the Red Way. One *fen* may be ingested to abide in the world without death.\nAfter five years of guarding and circulating, a *daogui* of medicine transmutes one *jin* of iron and mercury into the Red Way. Ingest seven grains the size of sesame seeds.\nAfter nine years of guarding and circulating, the method is perfected, enabling the transmutation of the Five Metals, Eight Stones, tiles, and pebbles into treasures of their original colors. Ingesting three grains expels the Three Corpses and Nine Worms.\n\nOne version states: Attaining longevity without death extends not only to humans—birds, dogs, and livestock that ingest it also become immortal.\n\n**Method of Ingestion:**\nForm the medicine into pills using dense wood, the size of sesame seeds. Ingest according to the prescribed weight each year. On the meeting day of the Eight Nodes and *jiazi*, hold the medicine, kneel, face the sun, recite the invocation to the Heavenly Perfected, and ingest it.\n\n**Formula for Transmuting Mercury with Medicine:**\nGrind the mercury and medicine together, place them in a crucible, and cover with a small amount of medicine. Seal the top with a pottery vessel, wrap the sides with damp paper, and set it in fine ash. Apply fire weighing half a *jin* from a distance for the duration of cooking one meal, then gradually increase the fire for half a day until the contents glow red. Soon, they will harden into a mass; subdue the fire and fan it.\n\nOne version: Smelt and solidify into treasure.\n\n**Formulas for Transmutation and Refining Stubborn Substances:**\nAccording to the years of guarding and circulating, use the appropriate amount of medicine to refine mercury by weight into gold and silver. Further transmute copper and *shushi* into \"great silver,\" using two *liang* of mercury-silver per *jin*. The mercury-silver may then be reused; guard and circulate it as medicine for one year to cut off the original mercury’s influence.\n\nOne version:\nAfter one year of guarding and circulating, use three *liang* of medicine to refine one *jin* of mercury into the White Way.\nAfter two years of guarding and circulating, use two *liang* of medicine to refine one *jin* of mercury into the White Way.\nAfter three years of guarding and circulating, use one *liang* of medicine to refine one *jin* of mercury into the White Way.\n\n**Formula for Utilizing Refined Mercury in Yellow and White Alchemy:**\nPlace two portions of mercury into a cauldron, seal it with a clay ring, and bury it in ash with the opening facing upward. The ash should be five *cun* thick. Apply fire from above.\nBegin with five *liang*, increase to seven *liang* after one *fu* period, then to twelve *liang* after another *fu* period, and finally to one *jin*. After eight *fu* periods, use a martial fire on all sides of the cauldron until it glows red. After half a day, open it: one *liang* of medicine transmutes one *jin* of mercury into the White Way.\nReplace the medicine in the crucible and apply one *jin* of fire day and night for one year: half a *liang* of medicine transmutes one *jin* of mercury into the White Way.\nReplace the crucible again and apply one *jin* of fire day and night for one year: half a *liang* of medicine transmutes one *jin* of mercury into the White Way.\nReplace the crucible and guard it with one *jin* of fire for two years: one and a half *fen* of medicine transmutes one *jin* of mercury into the White Way.\nReplace the crucible and guard it for two years: one *fen* of medicine transmutes one *jin* of mercury into the White Way. The crucible must be replaced each year, following the method above. Transmute according to the years and prescribed weights, and all will become treasures.\n\n**Formula for Red Lead and Black Lead Concluded.**",
