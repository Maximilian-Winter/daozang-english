  "full_translation": "**Exegetical Commentary on the *Classic of Perfect Virtue of the Unfathomable Void***\n\n**Title:** *Exegetical Commentary on the Classic of Perfect Virtue of the Unfathomable Void*\nAuthored by Duan Jingshun of the Tang, with supplements by Chen Jingyuan of the Song. Two scrolls.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity*, Cavernous Spirit Division, Jade Instructions Category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Exegetical Commentary on the Classic of Perfect Virtue of the Unfathomable Void***\n\nBefore the birth of Zhuangzi, the Way of Liezi had already flowed boundless and formless, suffusing the Great Void without trace or sound. Thus, his writings elucidated the profound obscurities of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, dissecting the roots of life and death, stripping away concealments and unraveling entanglements, lancing boils and draining abscesses. His words spoke of spontaneity without self-awareness, of non-action while allowing all things to follow their course. His phrasing ranged freely, like withered leaves and dry husks, riding the wind east and west, drifting and admonishing between heaven and earth without limit.\n\nLater, Zhuangzi frequently cited his words in discourses, and thus the world came to speak of \"Lao-Zhuang\" rather than \"Lao-Lie.\" This is because Zhuangzi harmonized differences into unity, his meaning threading through all, distinguishing hardness and whiteness while embracing both being and non-being.\n\nIn the past, Liezi dwelled in seclusion in Putian for forty years, yet none recognized him; he concealed his form among the common folk, and even the lord of the state knew him not—such was his heavenly obscurity. A man may possess the Way yet receive no praise; how could the Way be trivial? A book may contain principle yet seldom be acknowledged; how could it be coarse? This man, this book—profound and distant, returning with things to their source—how lofty it is!\n\nFrom my youth, I delighted in reading this work, yet suffered from the lack of phonetic glosses and explanations to resolve my confusions. In later years, while wandering beneath the watery canopy of Siming at Tongbai on Mount Tiantai, I obtained two tattered scrolls, their titles faintly marked as *Exegetical Commentary on Liezi*. The paper and ink were decayed, unfit for leisurely perusal, so I hastily transcribed them. Much was lost to moths and decay, obliterated and fragmented, with four or five parts in ten missing. Yet at the end of the scroll was inscribed: *\"Compiled by Yin Jingshun, Vice Magistrate of Dangtu County, Tang; transcribed by Mo Xizi of Mount Heng.\"* I roughly copied and stored it in my satchel.\n\nLater, on Mount Qian, I found a handwritten copy of *Liezi* by the Tang Daoist Xu Lingfu, along with Lu Chongxuan’s commentary preserved in a private collection. Comparing these with the printed edition from the Directorate of Education during the Jingde era, I collated discrepancies, noting variants and assembling a record of errors and divergences in one scroll, appended to the commentary. Subsequently, I filled lacunae and restored omissions, recovering the original order.\n\nAmong the finest explanations by earlier scholars was the identification of *cheng* (程) as a variant name for *biao* (豹), which in ancient script comprises the two characters *tai* (泰) and *bing* (丙). Such erudition and breadth of knowledge! Any oversights or omissions await the emendations and insights of like-minded scholars.\n\nWritten on the ninth day of the ninth month, second year of the Xining era, by Bixuzi.\n\n---\n\n**Exegetical Commentary on the *Classic of Perfect Virtue of the Unfathomable Void*, Scroll One***\nCompiled by Yin Jingshun, Vice Magistrate of Dangtu County, Tang\nSupplemented by Chen Jingyuan, Bixuzi\n\n**New Catalogue of *Liezi***\n\nSurname: Lie. Given name: Yukou, or alternatively Yukou.\nPreceding Zhuangzi, hence Zhuangzi’s references to him.\nAt the beginning of the Tianbao era, by imperial decree, he was enfeoffed as the Perfected of the Unfathomable Void, and his work was retitled *Classic of the Unfathomable Void*, its name heading the eight chapters.\nThis edition was compiled by Liu Xiang, who selected twenty chapters, removed redundancies, and titled it *New Book*.\nIn the fourth year of the Jingde era of the Great Song, the title was augmented with \"Perfect Virtue,\" becoming *Classic of Perfect Virtue of the Unfathomable Void*.\nThe collator, Liu Xiang, styled Zizheng, was a descendant of Liu Jiao, Prince Yuan of Chu during the Han.\nThus was this book collated and annotated. May the teachings of its sounds and meanings be revered!\n\nWithin the text, the character \"与\" frequently appears in this form.\n\n臣参 (chén cān): pronounced as \"seven\" in the southern pronunciation.\n\nLiu Xiang’s *Catalogue of the New Book of Guanzi* states: \"The *Book of Minister Can* comprises forty-one chapters.\"\n\n校雠 (jiào chóu): pronounced as \"chou.\"\n校 refers to comparing two texts, verifying through collation.\n雠 means \"like an enemy,\" signifying reciprocal verification.\n\n除复 (chú fù): pronounced as \"fu\" in the \"you\" rhyme.\n以尽 (yǐ jìn): pronounced as \"jin\" in the \"zhi\" rhyme, meaning \"to exhaust\"; the same applies below.\n\nIn the *New Book*, there is 栈 (zhàn), pronounced as \"jian.\"\nThis refers to damage or destruction by bookworms.\nAbbreviated as 刬 or written as 前, both equivalent to 剪 (jiǎn).\n\nThe *Rites of Zhou* includes the office of 剪氏, responsible for eliminating insects, fish, and bookworms.\n\n杀青 (shā qīng) refers to scraping away the green skin of bamboo slips after drying.\n\n郑缪公 (Zhèng Mù Gōng): pronounced as \"Mu.\"\nContemporary with Duke Ai of Lu.\n\n迂 (yū): pronounced as \"yu.\"\n诞 (dàn): pronounced as \"tan\" in the \"han\" rhyme.\n迂诞 (yū dàn) denotes grandiose, exaggerated speech.\n\n恢 (huī): pronounced as \"hui\" in the \"hui\" rhyme.\n诡 (guǐ): pronounced as \"wei\" in the \"wei\" rhyme.\n恢诡 (huī guǐ) refers to wildly strange or fantastical language.\n\n推分 (tuī fèn): pronounced as \"fen\" in the \"wen\" rhyme.\n乘背 (chéng bèi): pronounced as \"pei.\"\n\n孝景 (Xiào Jǐng), Emperor of Han, avoided the personal name \"启\" (Qǐ).\n\n亦颇 (yì pō): pronounced as \"po\" in the \"ke\" rhyme.\n偶言 (ǒu yán): pronounced as \"yu.\"\n\nLiu Xiang’s *Bie Lu* states: \"偶言 (*ǒu yán*) refers to composing names of persons and making them converse with one another.\" The *Records of the Grand Historian* reads it as 寓 (*yù*). \"列传 (*liè zhuàn*)\" and \"列传\" are categories of the classics, both pronounced in the departing tone.\n\n昧死 (*mèi sǐ*): pronounced as \"shang\" in the \"zhang\" rhyme.\n永始 (*Yǒng Shǐ*): reign title of Emperor Cheng of Han.\n湛 (*Zhāng Zhàn*), styled Chudu, was a *Guanglu Xun* of the Eastern Jin.

These often intermingle with Buddhist scriptures, just as it is said that Buddhist scriptures frequently intermingle with the *Liezi*. This is how writers compose their words, with phrases and expressions mutually presented.\n\n\"Shǔ cí\" is pronounced as \"zhú.\" *Zhuangzi*, named Zhou, styled Zixiu, was a native of Song. He served as the magistrate of Liang’s Qiyuan. He authored a work in fifty-two pian, which Guo Xiang later compiled into thirty-three pian and annotated.

Within this scripture, there are often passages attributed to the Perfected of Chongxu.\n\nShen Dao was a native of Zhao. He preceded Shen Buhai and Han Fei, who both esteemed him.

According to the *Yiwen zhi* in the *Book of Han*, there are four pian of the *Book of the Yellow Emperor*, one pian of *The Yellow Emperor and His Ministers*, and six pian of *Inscriptions of the Yellow Emperor*, all of which resemble Daoist scriptures. *Xuánpìn* is pronounced as \"pírěn.\" *Wú yǐng* is pronounced as \"yǐng.\"\n\nMianmian is pronounced as *wǔyán*. *Cúnxié* is pronounced as *yǐzhē*.

The *yào*, pronounced *zhuó*, becomes the *zhān*, pronounced *zhān*. The *zhān* becomes the *bù gǔ* tree, also written as *ké*. Lu Ji’s *Maoshi Niaoshou Shu* states: \"The crane resembles the *zhān*, with yellow feathers, a chicken’s head, and a gray body, all similar.

The note says \"same as.\" *Jiù* is water, pronounced *shuǐ jiù*; *Yǒu shēn* is read *shū zhēn*. \"Infant\" is sometimes written *yīng*, which is incorrect.

For long, bamboo gives birth to *qīng níng*—the *Nán Huá Zhēn Jīng* takes \"from *yáng xī* to *qīng níng*\" as one phrase. Sima Biao says: *Yáng xī* is a plant whose root resembles *yàn jīng*; when paired with old bamboo, they grow as unlike kinds. *Qīng níng* is the name of an insect.\n\n*Shēng chéng*: The *Shī Zǐ* says: In the Central States it is called *bào*; the people of Yue call it *mò*.

Guo’s note says: *Mò* is the white *bào*. *Bào* is born of tiger, an unlike kind. Thus *chéng* is another name for *mò*. Now *mò* resembles a bear, its fur yellow-black and lustrous—*mó* is pronounced *mò*. \"Horse gives birth to man\": The *Sōu Shén Jì* says: In the time of Duke Xiao of Qin, a horse gave birth to a man. Liu Xiang took it as a horse omen.\n\n*Shēng xiǎng* is pronounced *xǔ liǎng*.

Written in seal script, it resembles the character for \"long.\" According to the *Hàn Shū*, Yang Yùsūn said: \"That of spirit is Heaven’s *yǒu*; that of bones and frame is Earth’s *yǒu*.\" Yùsūn often read this scripture. Now the Guozijian edition writes *fēn*. The root is pronounced *jiǎo*.\n\n\"Youth and strength\" is read *shòu zhào*.

The *Bó Wù Zhì* says: It is woven of thread, eight inches wide, twelve inches long, used to bind the infant to the back—*lín lèi* is pronounced *lèi*. Some write *yǐng*, a misrecognition.\n\n\"Base\" is pronounced *dū lǐ*. \"Wearing furs\" is read *bèi*. \"Forgotten grain\" is pronounced *suì*. \"Thus the furrow\" is read *xī*. \"Skirt\" is pronounced *jū yùn*; *pú làng* is read *pú làng*.

Deng Yuan’s *Commentary on the Water Classic* states: the Ji River originates from Mount Wangwu, forming the *duì* sound. As the Yan River, it flows east through Wen, becoming the Ji River, then enters the Yellow River over ten *li* downstream. Southward, it meanders into the river, forming Rong Marsh, and further flows through Jiyin and nine other commanderies before reaching the sea. *The Rites of Zhou* states: the *qúyù* does not cross the Ji, and the *mò*, if it crosses the Wen, dies—such is the influence of the land’s *qi*. Zheng Xuan notes: the Wen River lies north of the city of Lu, and earlier scholars, following one another, mistakenly took it for the Wen River of Lu. This is a grave error. According to *Records of the Grand Historian*, the Wen shares the same pronunciation as *□*, *wǔ jīn*, referring to the Wen River of Jiang. It is not the Wen pronounced *wèn*. As *The Classic of Mountains and Seas* records: the Great River emerges from Mount Wen. Guo Pu comments: it flows southeast toward Shu Commandery, northeast toward Badong and Jiangxia, and reaches the sea at Guangling. *Han’s Outer Commentary on the Book of Songs* states: of old, the Jiang River issued from Mount Wen; at its source, it was but a shallow stream, sufficient to float a winecup. The *Songs of Chu* also speak of \"the clear Jiang of hidden Mount Wen.\" This is conclusive. Moreover, *Liezi* and *The Rites of Zhou* both affirm that the nature of water and soil differs, and transplantation causes harm. Thus, the four great rivers are cited as examples. Now, the Wen River of Lu spans no more than a few dozen paces, its source extending no farther than two hundred *li*. Even Yang Li crosses it with ease, traversing it in moments. How could the fox or *mò* perish merely by briefly venturing across? *The Explanation of Graphs* states: the *mò* is a kind of fox, all of which thrive in hilly, arid lands. Today, people living by the river say: \"The *zhuā* does not ford the Jiang.\" Clearly, crossing great waters harms their innate nature, leading to their death.\n\nThe phrase ends at \"*yǐ*.\" One version reads: \"the balance of *qíng* and *xìng*.\"\n\n\"*Fēn*\" is pronounced *fú wèn*.\n\n\"*Dà xíng*\" is pronounced *tài xíng*; the annotation is the same.\n\n\"*Dōng yuán*\" is pronounced *yuán*.\n\n\"*Chéng* mountain\" in *Han’s Outer Commentary on the Book of Songs* means \"to suffer.\" \"*Zhī yū*\" is pronounced *yú*, with the same pronunciation below.\n\nMiscellaneous pronunciations: *zá rán* as *qī hé*.

Wei Zhao’s *On Gambling* states: \"Setting up wood and striking it is the method.\"\n\n*The Classic of Ancient Bo* states: The rules of *bo* require two players to sit facing each other across a board divided into twelve paths, with the two ends at the center called \"the waters.\" Twelve *mu* pieces are used—six white and six black—along with two fish pieces placed in the waters. The dice are made of *qiong*, a square of one *cun* and three *fen*, five *fen* in length, with pointed ends and drilled indentations on four sides called \"eyes\" or \"teeth.\" The two players take turns casting the dice to move their *mu* pieces. When a *mu* reaches a position, it is stood upright and called a \"valiant *mu*,\" which then enters the waters to eat the fish—also called \"leading the fish.\" Leading one fish earns two tallies; flipping one fish earns three tallies. If one has already led two fish but fails to win, it is called \"being flipped with double fish,\" and the opponent gains six tallies, achieving a great victory.\n\n*Cè* is pronounced *cè*.\n\n\"*Bo* is akin to archery\" forms a complete sentence.\n\n\"Shí\" is pronounced *qiè*. \"Míng qióng\" is pronounced with *zhāng* as in *zhōng* and *dīng* as in *zhōng qiè*. \"Fǎn\" is pronounced *fān*. \"Liǎng\" is pronounced *tā là*.\n\nIn all games where players contend in skill to hit a target, it is called \"shooting\" or \"casting.\" Péi Sì states: \"Reporting the *cai* means capturing the fish.\" The character \"qín\" in some versions of the *True Classic* is written as \"fish.\" According to the *Great Bo Sutra*, it is written as \"dié,\" the flatfish. This likely refers to the two fish as a pair, like the eyes of a brave one. Here, it means that upon reporting the *cai* and hitting the mark, one flips the two fish to achieve a great victory and laughs.\n\n\"Dié\" is pronounced *tā là*. Modern versions read \"□ fish,\" which contains an extra character.

      "translated_text": "**Exegetical Commentary on the *Classic of Perfect Virtue of the Unfathomable Void***\n\n**Title:** *Exegetical Commentary on the Classic of Perfect Virtue of the Unfathomable Void*\nAuthored by Duan Jingshun of the Tang, with supplements by Chen Jingyuan of the Song. Two scrolls.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity*, Cavernous Spirit Division, Jade Instructions Category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Exegetical Commentary on the Classic of Perfect Virtue of the Unfathomable Void***\n\nBefore the birth of Zhuangzi, the Way of Liezi had already flowed boundless and formless, suffusing the Great Void without trace or sound. Thus, his writings elucidated the profound obscurities of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, dissecting the roots of life and death, stripping away concealments and unraveling entanglements, lancing boils and draining abscesses. His words spoke of spontaneity without self-awareness, of non-action while allowing all things to follow their course. His phrasing ranged freely, like withered leaves and dry husks, riding the wind east and west, drifting and admonishing between heaven and earth without limit.\n\nLater, Zhuangzi frequently cited his words in discourses, and thus the world came to speak of \"Lao-Zhuang\" rather than \"Lao-Lie.\" This is because Zhuangzi harmonized differences into unity, his meaning threading through all, distinguishing hardness and whiteness while embracing both being and non-being.\n\nIn the past, Liezi dwelled in seclusion in Putian for forty years, yet none recognized him; he concealed his form among the common folk, and even the lord of the state knew him not—such was his heavenly obscurity. A man may possess the Way yet receive no praise; how could the Way be trivial? A book may contain principle yet seldom be acknowledged; how could it be coarse? This man, this book—profound and distant, returning with things to their source—how lofty it is!\n\nFrom my youth, I delighted in reading this work, yet suffered from the lack of phonetic glosses and explanations to resolve my confusions. In later years, while wandering beneath the watery canopy of Siming at Tongbai on Mount Tiantai, I obtained two tattered scrolls, their titles faintly marked as *Exegetical Commentary on Liezi*. The paper and ink were decayed, unfit for leisurely perusal, so I hastily transcribed them. Much was lost to moths and decay, obliterated and fragmented, with four or five parts in ten missing. Yet at the end of the scroll was inscribed: *\"Compiled by Yin Jingshun, Vice Magistrate of Dangtu County, Tang; transcribed by Mo Xizi of Mount Heng.\"* I roughly copied and stored it in my satchel.\n\nLater, on Mount Qian, I found a handwritten copy of *Liezi* by the Tang Daoist Xu Lingfu, along with Lu Chongxuan’s commentary preserved in a private collection. Comparing these with the printed edition from the Directorate of Education during the Jingde era, I collated discrepancies, noting variants and assembling a record of errors and divergences in one scroll, appended to the commentary. Subsequently, I filled lacunae and restored omissions, recovering the original order.\n\nAmong the finest explanations by earlier scholars was the identification of *cheng* (程) as a variant name for *biao* (豹), which in ancient script comprises the two characters *tai* (泰) and *bing* (丙). Such erudition and breadth of knowledge! Any oversights or omissions await the emendations and insights of like-minded scholars.\n\nWritten on the ninth day of the ninth month, second year of the Xining era, by Bixuzi.\n\n---\n\n**Exegetical Commentary on the *Classic of Perfect Virtue of the Unfathomable Void*, Scroll One***\nCompiled by Yin Jingshun, Vice Magistrate of Dangtu County, Tang\nSupplemented by Chen Jingyuan, Bixuzi\n\n**New Catalogue of *Liezi***\n\nSurname: Lie. Given name: Yukou, or alternatively Yukou.\nPreceding Zhuangzi, hence Zhuangzi’s references to him.\nAt the beginning of the Tianbao era, by imperial decree, he was enfeoffed as the Perfected of the Unfathomable Void, and his work was retitled *Classic of the Unfathomable Void*, its name heading the eight chapters.\nThis edition was compiled by Liu Xiang, who selected twenty chapters, removed redundancies, and titled it *New Book*.\nIn the fourth year of the Jingde era of the Great Song, the title was augmented with \"Perfect Virtue,\" becoming *Classic of Perfect Virtue of the Unfathomable Void*.\nThe collator, Liu Xiang, styled Zizheng, was a descendant of Liu Jiao, Prince Yuan of Chu during the Han.\nThus was this book collated and annotated. May the teachings of its sounds and meanings be revered!",

Southward, it meanders into the river, forming Rong Marsh, and further flows through Jiyin and nine other commanderies before reaching the sea. *The Rites of Zhou* states: the *qúyù* does not cross the Ji, and the *mò*, if it crosses the Wen, dies—such is the influence of the land’s *qi*. Zheng Xuan notes: the Wen River lies north of the city of Lu, and earlier scholars, following one another, mistakenly took it for the Wen River of Lu. This is a grave error. According to *Records of the Grand Historian*, the Wen shares the same pronunciation as *□*, *wǔ jīn*, referring to the Wen River of Jiang. It is not the Wen pronounced *wèn*. As *The Classic of Mountains and Seas* records: the Great River emerges from Mount Wen. Guo Pu comments: it flows southeast toward Shu Commandery, northeast toward Badong and Jiangxia, and reaches the sea at Guangling. *Han’s Outer Commentary on the Book of Songs* states: of old, the Jiang River issued from Mount Wen; at its source, it was but a shallow stream, sufficient to float a winecup. The *Songs of Chu* also speak of \"the clear Jiang of hidden Mount Wen.\" This is conclusive. Moreover, *Liezi* and *The Rites of Zhou* both affirm that the nature of water and soil differs, and transplantation causes harm. Thus, the four great rivers are cited as examples. Now, the Wen River of Lu spans no more than a few dozen paces, its source extending no farther than two hundred *li*. Even Yang Li crosses it with ease, traversing it in moments. How could the fox or *mò* perish merely by briefly venturing across? *The Explanation of Graphs* states: the *mò* is a kind of fox, all of which thrive in hilly, arid lands. Today, people living by the river say: \"The *zhuā* does not ford the Jiang.\" Clearly, crossing great waters harms their innate nature, leading to their death.\n\nThe phrase ends at \"*yǐ*.\" One version reads: \"the balance of *qíng* and *xìng*.\"\n\n\"*Fēn*\" is pronounced *fú wèn*.\n\n\"*Dà xíng*\" is pronounced *tài xíng*; the annotation is the same.\n\n\"*Dōng yuán*\" is pronounced *yuán*.\n\n\"*Chéng* mountain\" in *Han’s Outer Commentary on the Book of Songs* means \"to suffer.\" \"*Zhī yū*\" is pronounced *yú*, with the same pronunciation below.",
