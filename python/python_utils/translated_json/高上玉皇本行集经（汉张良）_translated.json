  "full_translation": "**Edict of the Celestial Bureau for Verifying Scriptures**\n\n**Title:** *The Highest Supreme Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct Sutra*\n**Original Title:** *Tian Shu Shangxiang Zhang Liang’s Verified and Annotated Edition*\n*(Attributed to a Song-dynasty Daoist as the annotator)*\n**Three Scrolls**\n**Source of the Base Text:** *Zhengtong Daozang*, *Dongzhen* (Venerable and True) Section, *Benwen* (Original Text) Category.\n\n---\n\n**Edict of the Celestial Bureau for Verifying Scriptures**\n\nThe Bureau below, where the Dao abides in tranquil stillness,\nSeeks to emulate the most arduous of deliberations;\nIts boundless divine efficacy transcends mere description.\n\nAll praises and commendations are but to guide and lead the way,\nYet over time, discrepancies in recitation and transcription have arisen,\nCausing discrepancies among the transmissions of the Immortals.\nMoreover, with the passage of countless years,\nThe spoken and written forms have strayed from their original truth.\nHow could one blame the fish for resembling the *Ru* script,\nOr the crow for being mistaken for a horse?\nWithout verification, errors inevitably persist.\n\nThus, the command is issued to the literati,\nTo scrutinize and cross-examine the sacred texts.\n\n**Zhang Liang, Tian Shu’s Senior Advisor,**\nLong devoted to scholarly pursuits,\nNow oversees the Celestial Bureau.\nHaving already performed transformations in the Southern Realm,\nAnd issued scriptures to guide mortals below,\nHe is now entrusted with the duty of critical examination,\nAnd doubly honored for his contributions to verification,\nTo ensure the faithful recitation of the text by mortals,\nAnd to reveal the profound mysteries of the Heavenly Scriptures.\nLet all errors be rectified, and perfection achieved.\n\nAh! The Dao is transmitted through the heart,\nIts profound insight lies beyond mere words;\nYet its meaning is revealed through speech,\nAnd advancement in cultivation must begin within the scriptures.\nThus, let there be redoubled diligence in examination,\nSo as not to betray the trust of the compilers.\nMoreover, let the path of inquiry be clearly stated,\nIlluminating the stages of attainment for the aspirants.\nMay sincere disciples thereby seek the Mysterious,\nAnd virtuous scholars attain the Way through this,\nTurning from their vulgarity and returning to purity.\n\nUpon completion of this report,\nIt shall await imperial approval for dissemination.\n\nThis edict is hereby issued—\n**Strictly adhere to its commands.**\n\n**Rightfully received by the Three Pure Ones’ decree,**\nAs per the previous decree, now confirmed.\n**Year, Month, Day**\n**Issued by Lin Shaohua, the Receiver.**\n\n「Your Majesty’s gracious decree has been duly received,\nYet I, the humble **Liang**, dare to decline the weighty task of examining and revising the *Sutra of the Jade Emperor*.\n\nI humbly submit: Yesterday, I respectfully obeyed Your Majesty’s wise edict,\nEntrusting me with the duty of scrutinizing the *Sutra of the Jade Emperor*.\nYet the Dao’s subtleties are beyond mere words,\nHow could they be fully expounded through speech alone?\nThe scriptures illuminate eternal teachings,\nBut first, their profound elucidation must be meticulously declared.\n\nThis truth is clear to all who comprehend it.\nI earnestly consider how to uphold the scriptures’ logic,\nNever daring to exceed their bounds.\n\nMoreover, common folk, once accustomed to old ways,\nFind change difficult to accept.\nIf I were to alter even a single word,\nThe masses would surely harbor doubt.\n\nThus, I should not deviate from the established text,\nLest I invite further speculation.\n\nAlas, my own mediocrity and dim wit\nAre unworthy of such sacred scriptures.\nI risk the punishment of the cauldron and tripod,\nYet humbly lay bare my heartfelt plea.\n\nI tremble in awe and terror,\nBowing my head repeatedly.\nAgain, I reflect upon my lowly birth and humble station,\nA vulgar servant in this corrupt age.\nBy fortune, I have been shaped by my teachers and mentors,\nAnd granted ascent into the ranks of the immortals.\nThough my nature is coarse and unrefined,\nI now hold authority over pivotal matters.\nDay and night, I ponder in fear,\nSeeking only to perform my duties inadequately,\nAnd escape blame through sheer effort.\n\nYet Your Majesty’s benevolent decree is as gentle as spring sunlight,\nWarm and harmonious in tone.\nYour profound edict is magnanimous and serene,\nNot like the sternness of autumn frost.\nYou entrust me with this grave responsibility,\nTo apply my clumsy skills to its sacred interpretation.\n\nBut who among these benighted and incompetent ones\nIs worthy of such a task?\n\nThe sacred words already encompass ultimate truth,\nWhile the true scriptures have long been obscured by mortal minds.\nIf I were to change them now,\nHow could the people fully trust them?\n\nI deeply fear that the ignorant and vulgar\nMay harbor disbelief, scoffing at the sacred texts,\nAnd bring down great calamity upon myself.\nNot only would my lowly self face reproach for failing in duty,\nBut I would also suffer the shame of marring this precious text.\n\nThe matter has reached this point—\nThere is room for reconsideration.\n\nI, the foolish one, pray that Your Majesty’s wisdom may pierce my darkness,\nThat Your discerning gaze may recognize my hidden sincerity,\nAnd that You may take pity upon my humble plea.\nPerhaps You would grant me release from this heavy burden,\nOr commission a more capable scholar,\nA towering figure of wisdom and might,\nTo undertake this examination,\nSo that no further objections may arise.\n\nI, Liang, having received the imperial decree,\nDare to voice my reckless words,\nNot to defy Your Majesty’s favor,\nBut to pour forth my earnest desires.\nMy crime is deserving of ten thousand deaths.\n\nI humbly beseech the Three Pure Ones,\nThat Your decree may be issued from Your sovereign heart,\nAnd proclaimed to all within and beyond,\nSo that I may strive to uphold my duties,\nAnd repay Your gracious kindness.\n\nI, Liang, having dared to challenge Your Majesty’s authority,\nFeel my heart quake with boundless trepidation and fear.\nBowing my head repeatedly,\nI respectfully submit this petition for Your edict.\nAwaiting Your imperial decree.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n**Year, Month, Day**\n**Liang** presents his memorial.\n\n**The Three Pure Ones’ Second Decree**\nAll that Liang has petitioned is fully understood.»\n\n「Your Excellency’s learning encompasses the hundred schools, and Your Dao/Way ranks among the sages. You have already received the office of guiding sentient beings, and long held the authority to expound sacred texts.\n\nReflecting upon the people of the Southern Continent, they have long revered Your teachings of profound principles. Yet the *Benxing Jijing* [1] contains errors and inconsistencies, and the common folk below all cling to their own confused doubts. Thus, I propose Your selection and careful examination.\n\nIt is fitting that You now shoulder the responsibility of Your previous brilliance and again humbly deliver this request. Do not dismiss this modest plea; may You fulfill Your duty with earnestness. Therefore, I issue this second decree, which You must reverently accept.\n\nThe *Yuhuang Benxingjing* [2] is the essence of the utmost truth, the profound intent of the sages. Within its words, it contains the marvelous Dao/Way of the One True Principle and demonstrates the path to liberation in the midst of its praises. Its language and meaning intertwine, its teachings and affairs merge. Within its speech, it embraces the true and mysterious; within its discourse, it unfolds the subtlest wonders, with nothing concealed.\n\nThose who taste its words find divine harmony with the Great Unity; those who recite it transcend all defilements. Its divine efficacy and wondrous applications are vast and immeasurable; its lofty principles and luminous insights encompass all without exception.\n\nYet because sentient beings are burdened with heavy obstructions and the common multitude lacks true discernment, they merely chase after literal interpretations, failing to grasp the essence of its words. They fear only the scriptures’ authority, unaware that true liberation lies beyond superficial rewards. Sacred texts reveal extraordinary signs, but profound truths reside in the One True Principle.\n\nHow can one abandon the refined for the crude, or cling to the coarse while forsaking the marvelous? Only then will one align with the Heavenly Lord’s original intent and silently accord with the Emperor’s sovereign will.\n\nBy advancing in practice, one may swiftly transcend this defiled world; by ascending in realization, one may join the ranks of the pure and luminous. Thus, one may attain the *Qingwei Tian* [3] and ascend to the Hall of Light, without needing the Heavenly Lord’s wondrous voice to re-emerge, nor seeking His path to wander freely, possessing the Six Spiritual Powers and achieving Great Freedom.\n\nThis is where one first earns the name of *shixin* [4] (true reception) and where one truly earns the title of *shouchi* [5] (sacred recitation). If one spreads these words far and wide without delving into the intent of the One True Principle, or if the Six Roots [6] wander without encountering the path to liberation, then such efforts can never repay the Heavenly Lord’s labor in expounding this scripture, nor gain the Emperor’s merit in protecting it.\n\nLet those who revere and believe in this text redouble their efforts in upholding it, reciting with mouth and storing in heart as if dwelling within the radiant light. Let their spirits merge and minds converse as if wandering through the Jewel Park. Contemplating the divine powers of *Fenshen Heshen* [7] (divided and unified bodies), silently reflecting on the wondrous applications of *Yinghua Yingwu* [8] (responding transformations and manifestations), they will stand serene and unencumbered, with lofty confidence.\n\nThus, they may naturally ascend to the Celestial Palaces and be recorded among the sacred texts. I, Liang, having received Your enlightened decree, will now praise this Jewel Scripture. Respectfully, I first reveal its coarse interpretations in my humble words, to proclaim them to the present age.\n\nAs for the teachings on acquiring merit and the detailed explanations of divine retribution, these are already fully recorded in the scripture and need no further elaboration.\n\nBut regarding the unfolding of ultimate principles and correcting erroneous texts, though I lack the ability to err, I am guided by Your gracious decree. Having already declined with humility, I now dare not refuse this modest request. I will carve away and refine this heart, scrutinize it below, and first speak these words, establishing them in the scripture. Thus, future readers may recognize the original intent of its accounts.\n\nI, Liang, bow my head repeatedly and respectfully write this with clasped hands.\n\n**Volume One: Chapter One – The Divine Powers of the Qingwei Celestial Palace**\nDao/Way’s words [9]: The Primordial Heavenly Lord, in days past, ascended to the Qingwei Celestial Palace, within the *Yujing* [10] and *Jinquè* [11] of the Seven Treasures, in the Mysterious Jewel Park, to the Hall of Radiant Light. There, He expounded the path of *Lingbao Qingjing Zhenyi Bu’er* [12] (Soul Jewel of Purity, True Unity Without Duality) to countless beings beyond measure.\n\nThe *Yingyun Shufa Zhang* [13] has already been carefully examined, with no discrepancies or errors.\n\nI humbly state: The marvels of the Great Dao/Way begin from the beginningless and end in the endless. Its forms cannot be confined by vessels, nor can its manifestations be grasped by perception. The Three Realms [14] are all shaped and conditioned; how then could one attain this Dao/Way?\n\nI reverently ponder that the Primordial Heavenly Lord knew the Dao/Way’s lofty mysteries, pitied the sentient beings’ ignorance, and in response to the cosmic mandate, He expounded the law and revealed it, so that all beings in the Three Realms might seek this path. Thus, even the confused and the sluggish may enter the gate of Purity, True Unity, and return to the domain of Natural Emptiness.\n\nThe assembled truths of this scripture sought to record the Heavenly Lord’s deeds of expounding the law, hence this chapter is placed first.\n\nThough this scripture, from beginning to end, purely recounts the Emperor’s divine transformations and the marvels of His creation, the intent of its compilation is to directly point to the expounding of the *Lingbao Qingjing Zhenyi Bu’er* (Soul Jewel of Purity, True Unity Without Duality) path. Without profound insight and the mind-seal of true understanding, who could ever attain this?\n\nThe reverent and exalted *Xuanhua* (宣化) teachings are honored, to be conveyed to those who come after.\nMay the Heavenly Lord of Supreme Virtue graciously inspect and approve.\n\nYour humble subject, Liang, speaks with utmost care.\n\nAt that time, the Emperor of Jade, the Heavenly Lord, together with the myriad divine saints—among them the *Yuanji* (原始) Cloud Heaven True Flying Saints, the *Wujie* (无极) Divine Kings, the *Lingtong* (灵童) Divine Boys, and the *Yunü* (玉女) Divine Girls numbering nine hundred million—observed a solemn fast and established ritual purity, standing in attendance at His side.\n\nThe *Chengji Yuhui* (乘机与会) chapter has already been meticulously verified, with no discrepancies found.\n\nYour humble subject, Liang, respectfully states:\nThe Heavenly Lord’s mind is singular without duality, His deeds harmonious yet undivided.\nThus, when the Heavenly Lord ascended the *Qianbao Xuan Yuan* (七宝玄苑) of Seven Treasures and took His seat upon the Radiant Seat, preparing to expound the scripture, He did not first utter a single cryptic word, but rather issued a decree and summons.\n\nThen, the Emperor of Jade, in perfect accord with the Heavenly Lord’s silent intent, gathered the great saints in unspoken unity—was this not the embodiment of a singular mind without duality, and deeds in harmony yet undivided?\n\nYet I fear that the beings of the lower realms may not grasp this truth.\nThus, I dare to convey this message.\nMay the Heavenly Lord of Supreme Virtue graciously inspect and approve.\nYour humble subject, Liang, speaks with utmost care.\n\nThus, when the Emperor of Jade perceived that the appointed time had arrived, he immediately displayed the Six Transcendent Powers before the assembly, emitting a vast radiant light that illuminated all the heavens. The boundless *Wují* (無極) *Bàntán* (梵剎) realms and every domain trembled in response; the ten directions of the boundless *Wují* worlds all became as clear as crystal and glass, with no obstruction between them.\n\nTo the right, the *Chapter on Knowing the Time and Emitting Light* has been meticulously collated, with no errors found. Your humble subject, Liang, respectfully states:\n\nThe exalted and the humble, the distant and the near—each occupies its place, and though their stations differ, their essence and form vary accordingly. Without a unifying principle, how could their responses be the same?\n\nIn reverence, the Emperor of Jade governs the myriad heavens and commands all the earthly realms. Therefore, on this day, he specially emitted radiant light to illuminate all directions, causing all things to tremble, so that all sentient beings might awaken to awareness.\n\nSeizing this wondrous opportunity, they are blessed by the Dao’s grace.\n\nYet the divine light’s profound meaning remains unknown to the world. I dare to reveal the hidden mysteries and universally bestow boundless wisdom.\n\nFor light is the very nature of the Dao. No living being, however dim, lacks it. Yet the Heavenly Sage, through cultivation and refinement, attains perfect unity with the utmost essence, while living beings, scattered and deluded, lose this precious treasure.\n\nThus, the Heavenly Sage’s complete essence shines with radiant clarity, while the lost treasure of living beings sinks into darkness. When the Heavenly Sage, possessing the Dao-nature of unified existence, deploys divine transformations to illuminate it, all beings who share this Dao-nature cannot fail to be startled into awakening.\n\nTherefore, when the divine light is emitted, it fills the Dharma-realm, and all phenomena within the Dharma-realm tremble and awaken in response.\n\nThrough the harmony of essence with essence, such wondrous function unfolds. Seekers must pursue it thus.\n\nI humbly pray that the Heavenly Lord of Supreme Virtue may inspect and approve.\n\nYour humble subject, Liang, speaks with utmost care.\n\nThe ten-directional assemblies arrive together, riding the five-hued jade wheels, the lingyun jade palanquins, the six-hued dark dragons, and the ten-perfected feathered canopies. The qilin dances and the phoenix sings, their resonant calls echoing in harmonious melodies, while the spirit consorts scatter flowers and the golden boys waft incense. They chant hymns of praise and sacred verses, ascending through the air.\n\nThis is the *Chapter on the Ten-Directional Assemblies*, which has been carefully verified and compared, with no discrepancies found.\n\nI respectfully state: Though in terms of **manifestation** the ten directions are distinct,\nAnd though in form the myriad sages differ,\nYet since all things share the same essence,\nHow could the wise and holy be distinct?\nHow could the distant and near differ in observation?\nWhat boundaries could separate the four cardinal directions?\n\nWhen the Heavenly Sage expounds the scriptures and the Jade Emperor emits divine light,\nThe assemblies from the ten directions universally gather—\nThis is the natural order of things.\n\nAll living beings ought to recognize this truth.\n\nI, Liang, speak with utmost care.\n\nAt that time, the **Brahma-heavens** and all golden immortals,\nThe great vehicle bodhisattvas and the four assemblies of eight divisions,\nReceived this radiant illumination,\nAnd all ascended upon the **spirit-mist nine numinous** flying cloud-jade carriages,\nCelebrating the four great gatherings of the sky,\nAs the three luminaries exhaled their fragrance,\nAnd the eight winds converged in joyous flight,\nRevolving around the Dao’s presence,\nShowering upon the assemblies countless marvelous flowers,\nDescending like clouds to cover the gathering ground.\n\nThis is the *Chapter on the Golden Immortals’ Universal Arrival*,\nWhich has also been cross-verified, with no discrepancies found.\n\nI respectfully state: The Dao arises from a single teaching,\nYet some may diverge from it—these are **sects**;\nOr some may differ—these are **branches**.\nSeeking the sect from the branches,\nDivergence merges into unity—\nHow could there be any distinction?\n\nNow, in the mortal world, the Dao is taken as a divergent path,\nLike red and black ink—\nYet the Dao and its teachings share the same origin,\nWith no fundamental differences at all.\n\nThus, when the Heavenly Sage expounds the scriptures and the Jade Emperor emits divine light,\nThe golden immortals all gain the opportunity to attend.\n\nThis is because the **sages’ true hearts** are unified,\nAnd the Dao and its teachings share the same origin.\n\nMay the mortal world recognize this truth.\n\nI, Liang, speak with utmost care.\n\nAt that time, the light illuminated all the heavens,\nDescending to the **limitless world** of the lower realm—\nThe **same as the Mysterious Capital** of the Dao-realm.\n\nAll those in the mortal world,\nWho were near the Nine Heavens,\nInterconnected and bound by kinship,\nWere now equally close.\n\nAt that time, in the lower realm’s limitless world,\nMountains, ridges, valleys, ravines, and streams\nWere vast yet flat as the palm of a hand,\nThe six directions equally near,\nThe three realms not distant—\nThe **Celestial Treasures Platform** stood arrayed among mortals,\nWith jade and pearls scattered in splendor,\nBrightly shining upon the clouded thoroughfares,\nSeven-treasured railings and barriers\nMarking the Dao-path,\nJade trees and immortal flowers,\nLuminous pearls and precious gems,\nResplendent in the **elixir field**,\nMoss and grasses covering the ground in softness.\n\nAt that time, in the lower realm,\nAll saw the heavens’ wonders—\nThe **Hooked Heaven’s** exquisite music,\nSpinning in resonance with the light,\nNaturally vibrating in harmony.\nThey also saw the **luan’s** calls and the phoenix’s songs,\nThe soaring winds responding to the rhythms,\nThe dragons playing and the qilin coiling,\nTheir dances ascending to the celestial heights.\n\nThe heavens’ precious flowers,\nScattered and fallen,\nFilled the paths in abundance.\n\nThis is the *Chapter on the Light Illuminating the Lower Realm*.\n\nI privately consider:\nFrom the perspective of the heavens,\nThe mortal world is **this**,\nWhile the heavens are **that**.\n\nNow, in the original text,\nIt states that **this** mortal world\nIs near the Nine Heavens—\nThis implies no distinction between them.\n\nMoreover, the divine light’s illumination\nNaturally unites the upper and lower realms,\nFusing them boundlessly.\n\nYet the original text’s phrasing,\n“**This** mortal world...”\nForces an artificial separation,\nNot the natural state.\n\nThus, I have altered **this** to **that** in the mortal world’s context.\nI have also corrected **lower realm** to **that lower realm**.\n\nAs for the original text’s claim,\n“**This** mortal world also sees the *luan’s* calls and the phoenix’s songs,”\nThe word **this** is also an artificial imposition,\nAnd I have changed it to **all**.\n\nI privately consider:\nThe scriptures are the **heavenly texts**,\nNot of mortal origin.\nSince the **Heavenly Truth** descended to the world,\nIt was orally transmitted to the lower realm’s sages.\nThose sages of the lower realm,\nRecalled and recorded the teachings of the immortals.\n\nFrom the perspective of mortals,\nThe text frequently uses **this**,\nAnd occasionally contains unsettling phrases—\nThis is no cause for surprise.\n\nI now revise it,\nTo ensure the **grand harmony of meaning**.\nFearful that mortals may not understand,\nI explain it in detail here.\nThose who recite and uphold it,\nLet them not harbor other doubts.\n\nI respectfully state:\nWhen a mirror illuminates objects,\nAll forms appear;\nWhen ash covers objects,\nAll impurities grow faint.\n\nHow much more so when the **Supreme Emperor’s** unobstructed,\nEqual, and divine light\nIlluminates all things—\nShould not all beings bow and rise in unison,\nWith no distinction between near and far?\n\n**Abandon** the living and the sentient,\nAnd they will embody the Jade Emperor’s light emission.\nFusing the self with all things,\nEquating good and evil,\nDespising obstacles,\nThe light of this heart,\nWhen emitted,\nWill surely align with the Supreme Emperor’s unobstructed and equal light.\n\nTo seek the **principle** in the **sages’ deeds**,\nIs to reveal no falsehood.\nAll living beings ought to recognize this.\n\nThe subject humbly speaks: At that time, the common and the holy were astonished in unison, the hidden and the dark opened to radiance, the celestial and the human rejoiced and celebrated with leaping exultation. All laypersons and scholars attained ascension, gazing upward at the effulgent treasure platforms of the kalpas, and downward upon the violet clouds spreading far and wide.\n\nIn those worlds, all peoples—\nFrom the white-haired and wrinkled to the young and the tender—\nAll transformed and attained enlightenment,\nTheir hair black as indigo, their faces ruddy as vermilion,\nThe weak and the frail restored to vigor,\nTheir forms resplendent and luminous,\nTheir suffering healed, all liberated in joyous ease.\nThe lands sang of harmony and great peace.\n\n*(The \"Chapter on Manifesting the Divine Powers\")*\n\nThe subject secretly observes: After the light shone upon the lower realms,\nThe effects were immediately seen.\nYet in the present text, there are slight discrepancies,\nCausing the meaning to fail in coherence.\n\nI respectfully adjust the phrase \"At that time\" to precede \"the common and the holy were astonished in unison.\"\nAnd I move \"The lands sang of harmony and great peace\" beneath \"liberated in joyous ease.\"\n\nThe remaining phrases—such as \"the divine wind reaching afar\"—\nAre displays of the Dao’s mysterious transformations,\nVisible even in the hidden depths,\nNot merely in the human world.\n\nThus, I place them in the next chapter.\n\nThe subject humbly speaks: Though the hidden and the manifest differ,\nTheir principles remain unchanged.\nWhen the Emperor’s virtue and benevolent decree descend upon the mortal realm,\nThe dead, those burdened with sins, the exiled, the newly restored,\nThose elevated in rank, and those further honored—\nAll grow yet more noble.\nThis is the special grace of the Emperor’s virtue.\n\nHow much more so when the **Supreme Emperor’s** extraordinary divine light descends—\nA grace beyond the common—\nThat scholars ascend as immortals,\nThe aged regain their youth,\nThe young grow strong,\nThe sick are healed—\nThis is the natural order of things.\n\nAll living beings should strive to uphold the **Sacred Truth**,\nDiligently seek the Dao’s teachings,\nAnd await the **Jade Emperor’s** profound benevolence.\n\nThe Dao does not fail those who seek it,\nThe sages have clear instructions—\nLet them heed this with sincerity.\nThe subject humbly speaks.\n\nAt that very moment,\nThe divine wind reached afar,\nThe ten thousand breaths rose in vitality,\nHeaven shook and earth split,\nThe withered bones revived,\nThe drowned corpses flew with their souls,\nAll returned to their original forms;\nThe **Yin Regions** of iron enclosure and eternal night,\nThe **Nine Abysses**—\nWere instantly shattered.\nThe beings of the hells—\nTransformed into celestial realms,\nTheir suffering in the three evil paths\nAll dissolved.\n\nAt that time, the guilty ones,\nBy this light’s power,\nWere born into the ten directions’ great heavenly palaces.\n\n*(The \"Chapter on Reviving the Withered and the Drowned\")*\n\nThe subject secretly thinks:\nThough the Dao’s transformations affect all equally,\nThere is still a natural order of near and far, first and last.\nThus, the effects of the divine light first manifest in the bright human world,\nThen extend to the hidden realms of all beings—\nThis is the natural sequence.\n\nThe old text’s accounts,\nThough recorded, were somewhat disordered.\nI now place the phrase \"At that very moment\" above \"The divine wind reached afar,\"\nAnd follow \"All returned to their original forms\" with \"The **Yin Regions** of iron enclosure and eternal night...\"\nSo that the order of precedence remains unbroken,\nAnd the meaning flows smoothly,\nLest the original sight be lost as witnessed on that day when the scripture was expounded.\n\nI have also removed the phrase \"born into the celestial realms\" from the old text.\n\nThe subject humbly speaks:\nWithered bones should decay,\nDrowned corpses should dissolve,\nAnd evil destinies should confine—\nThis is the ordinary course.\nYet the Emperor’s grace is extraordinary,\nBeyond the reach of ordinary logic.\nLiving beings should not presume to have evil or transgression,\nFor there will come a day of pardon and rebirth into the heavens,\nYet some may harbor a hope of fortune.\nIf such hope arises,\nThey will instead fall into deeper darkness.\n\nThere are matters to be feared,\nThus I speak of them first.\nYet I must also clarify the meaning of \"liberation from confinement, resurrection of the dead.\"\n\nThe descent into evil paths is not their natural state,\nBut arises from the accumulation of heavy sins and karmic deeds.\nThe retribution of the hells is severe,\nAnd some cannot escape—\nYet with the reception of true grace,\nThey should naturally transcend transformation.\nEspecially when encountering the **Jade Emperor’s** radiant light,\nA grace of extraordinary pardon—\nThen sins and evils are entirely released,\nAs boiling water melts ice.\n\nFor the original spirit, a single soul,\nAscending with the sun’s light to the Nine Heavens—\nThis is no difficult matter.\n\nAs for the revival of withered bones and drowned corpses,\nThis must be explained through metaphor.\nFish scales and bones rot in the mud,\nYet with water, they revive again;\nPond lilies wither on the earth,\nYet with water, they sprout anew.\nWater is but one thing,\nAnd even fish scales and pond lilies respond thus—\nHow much more so to the **Supreme Emperor’s** extraordinary grace?\n\nMoreover, corpses are the transformed bodies of humans,\nAnd bones are the remnants of corpses.\nBones are from corpses,\nCorpses are from humans,\nHumans are born from the **yin-yang** breaths of heaven and earth—\nThis can manifest in bones.\nHow much more so for other things?\n\nBones are the refined essence of the **qi**.\nNow, scholars who refine their essence\nTurn it into the golden elixir of the **Dan**,\nPreserving form and dwelling in the world,\nAchieving longevity and divine immortality.\nThose bones, being the refined essence,\nShould naturally differ from common things.\n\nThus, all things decay when buried in the earth,\nYet human bones endure for long ages without transformation.\nThis is because they are the refined essence.\n\nTherefore, the **Supreme Sage’s** compassion and mercy\nPossess the art of **Great Yin** transformation.\nAh! Unable to save them in life,\nYet still reviving them in death—\nHow profound is this compassion and resolve!\n\nNow, with the **Supreme Emperor’s** radiant light,\nGranting escape from confinement and resurrection of the dead,\nEven to the revival of withered bones—\nHow shall the **Supreme Sage’s** virtue of cherishing life be repaid?\n\nIf even the slightest offense remains,\nThe **Yin Regions** and iron enclosures—\nHow can they be avoided?\nAll living beings should know this.\n\nThe subject humbly speaks.\n\nAt that time, the Jade Emperor divided his body,\nPermeating the ten directions of all great celestial palaces.\nHe commanded the celestial officials to spontaneously manifest,\nWith white jade as the capital,\nYellow gold as the gates,\nAnd the Seven Treasures’ Dark Garden’s Great Radiant Hall,\nIlluminated with a luminous seat,\nWith banners, flags, and canopies,\nExquisite treasures and rare flowers,\nAll arrayed throughout.\n\nTo the right: *The Chapter on Division and Manifestation*,\nAlready meticulously collated,\nWith no errors at all.\nThe subject humbly speaks:\n\nThe Dao’s essence is like the void—\nThe void contains all things,\nHow could it be confined to a single corner?\n\nThe moon appears in the void;\nWherever there is water, its reflection is without fail.\nThunder resounds in the sky;\nWherever it can be heard, its sound penetrates without obstruction.\n\nThe Jade Emperor’s wondrous Dao-body is like the void—\nOmnipresent, nowhere absent.\nHow could it compare to thunder or the moon?\nAnd how could it need division before manifesting throughout all heavens and earth?\n\nYet, the eyes of living beings\nTurn only when they encounter forms.\nThus, the Jade Emperor revealed his divided forms,\nSo that all sentient beings might gaze upon them,\nCultivate their minds, and take refuge,\nListening attentively to the wondrous teachings.\n\nTherefore, he pervaded all the heavens, manifesting one form in each,\nAnd the celestial hosts all revered their reflections,\nThen, according to each direction, he expounded the Dharma,\nUniversal and received by all beings.\n\nAh! To know the Jade Emperor’s Dao-body as one,\nYet not know its divisions,\nIs to see it as bound and not unified;\nTo know the Jade Emperor’s Dao-body as divided,\nYet not know its oneness,\nIs to recognize it as chaotic and without order.\n\nThis is neither one nor not one,\nThis is neither division nor not division—\nHidden and revealed, gathered and dispersed,\nMysterious and silent, yet subtly communicating.\nThis is the subtle meaning of the Jade Emperor’s division and manifestation.\n\nAll living beings should ponder this.\nThe subject humbly speaks.\n\nAt that time, the Jade Emperor, with his divided form, pervaded this realm, ascending to the White Jade Capital, within the Golden Gate’s Seven-Treasured Mystic Gardens, upon the Great Radiant Hall’s Radiant Seat, and universally expounded the Dao of pure liberation to all directions.\n\nThe *Chapter on the Division and Propagation of the Marvelous Dao* has been meticulously collated, with no errors remaining. The subject humbly speaks:\n\nIn this turbid age, sentient beings fail to awaken to the True Dao. Thus, the seven emotions and six desires run wild, unchecked, and myriad offenses accumulate without resolution—geohellish retribution cannot be evaded. Who would have thought the Celestial Sovereign’s mercy, spreading forgiveness and deliverance, grants them direct ascent to pure realms of boundless joy?\n\nYet how could they know that even those born from accumulated merit, once their merit is exhausted, still cannot escape rebirth? How much more so those who, by grace alone, attain heavenly birth—such birth is merely the extent of the grace received. If they remain ignorant of cultivation, how can they attain liberation?\n\nThe Jade Emperor’s saintly grace is boundless, yet He still desires their ultimate liberation. Thus, He proclaims the Dao of pure liberation, so that all celestial and human beings may attain the supreme fruit.\n\nAh! His benevolent radiance is vast and profound, His compassionate intent far-reaching. How can the celestial and human beings fail to strive and advance, to fulfill the Jade Emperor’s intent of guiding and delivering them?\n\nMortal beings should reflect on the Jade Emperor’s act of pardoning, rescuing, and delivering them from suffering, and diligently do good, lest they abandon themselves. Then, the descent of imperial grace shall not be as limited as this.\n\nAlthough this chapter records the Jade Emperor teaching celestial and human beings the Dao of pure liberation, the subsequent chapters do not explicitly mention His teaching of pure liberation. Why is this?\n\nIt is because the Jade Emperor, surrounded by all the Jade Maidens as attendants, has their true forms naturally emit fragrant essence, subtly containing the meaning of pure liberation. Thus, all beings in the six paths, illuminated by this light, awaken and comprehend, and through wondrous sounds and proclamations, all are expressions of pure liberation.\n\nThis is the Jade Emperor’s unsaid speech.\n\nThe sages who compiled the scripture, silently recognizing this truth, merely recorded: *\"The Jade Emperor universally expounds the Dao of pure liberation to all directions.\"*\n\nAh! Those who perceive the Emperor’s heart and see through the outer events—these sages who compiled the scripture, their profound and mysterious composition is beyond measure, truly inconceivable.\n\nLet those who recite the scripture seek this meaning.\n\nThe subject humbly speaks:\n\nAt that time, the Jade Emperor was attended by countless celestial maidens—Great Saints of the Boundless Heavens, Marvelous Conduct Immortals, and Sacred Consorts—arrayed on either side. These maidens possessed extraordinary and solemn beauty, adorned with celestial treasures and rare jewels. *\"Celestial treasures\"* refers to celestial maidens; *\"rare jewels\"* refers to extraordinary treasures. The old text mistakenly rendered *\"celestial treasures\"* as *\"celestial maidens.\"* Now corrected.\n\nTheir forms were resplendent, their voices clear and piercing, delightful to all who heard. Moreover, their bodies naturally emitted a subtle, marvelous fragrance of spontaneous liberation. This fragrance, pervading all heavens—*the old text read \"able to pervade all heavens.\"* If the character *\"able\"* is added before *\"pervade,\"* it implies forced action. Now corrected to *\"surrounding.\"*\n\nIt filled the most wondrous lands of bliss and all other fortunate places on earth. All beings in the six paths—*the old text read \"able to make all beings in the six paths.\"* The six paths suffer naturally from the fragrance; it was not forced upon them. Now corrected by removing *\"able to.\"*\n\nThose who heard this fragrance were universally enlightened. These six paths include the paths of celestial beings, humans, asuras, hells, hungry ghosts, and animals. *The old text appended \"from this point onward\"* beneath *\"animal path.\"* The maidens’ fragrance was heard by all six paths at that time; it was not limited to afterward. This was a mistake in oral transmission. Now removed.\n\nIf celestial beings in the celestial path heard this fragrance, the signs of decline would be permanently eradicated, and their heavenly merit would increase.\n\nIf humans in the human path—kings, ministers, and commoners—heard this fragrance, they would attain the joy of longevity in human and celestial realms, or their bodies would be liberated through *shell-discardance* or *corpse-resolution.*\n\nIf asuras in the asura path heard this fragrance, they would dwell peacefully in heavenly palaces, free from the suffering of battle.\n\nIf beings in the hellish path heard this fragrance, they would escape hellish torment and attain the bliss of pure lands.\n\nIf hungry ghosts in the hungry ghost path—*the old text read \"all hungry ghost spirits.\"* The subject humbly suggests that while spirits may occasionally fall into the hungry ghost path, once fallen, they are ghosts. The addition of *\"spirit\"* seems to confuse with *\"only spirit.\"* Now removed—heard this fragrance, they would be sated, free from hunger and thirst.\n\nIf animals in the animal path—*the old text read \"all beings.\"* Earlier, the hellish path mentioned *\"all beings,\"* but here, the animal path requires distinction, so *\"beings\"* is changed to *\"animals\"*—heard this fragrance, they would escape animal suffering and attain the joy of wisdom.\n\nThe *Chapter on Liberation Through Fragrance* has been meticulously collated and corrected.\n\nThe subject humbly speaks:\n\nThere are truths that are common knowledge, known even to ordinary people, and truths that are unusual—even the wise may not comprehend them. The subject dares to present his humble views on the *Chapter on Liberation Through Fragrance* to the world:\n\nThe subject observes that when the Jade Emperor first emitted light from the Seven-Treasured Mystic Gardens, all beings in the lower realms, including those in hellish suffering, were already born into heaven by that light. Now, the scripture records that after the Jade Emperor’s divided form manifested, He was attended by great saints and maidens, and it further states that the maidens’ fragrance pervaded this realm, yet all beings in the six paths who heard it attained liberation.\n\nThe doubts of the worldly folk arise: *\"If ordinary beings in suffering were already born into heaven by the Emperor’s light, why then does the scripture speak of the maidens’ fragrance?\"*\n\nAh! Such questions are not the fault of the world.\n\nFor matters beyond the scope of common reason, there are doubts that cannot be avoided—what is strange in this?\n\nThe subject humbly elucidates this, to dispel the world’s confusion.\n\nWith reverence, he addresses the Heavenly Venerable:\n\nNow, in this teaching of the scripture, the true intention is to reveal the gate of pure and unadulterated liberation.\n\nThe female form is of essence purely yin. Because it is purely yin, it is ever close to impurity. Because it is close to impurity, the female body rarely possesses the disposition of sweet fragrance.\n\nYet now, all the maidens are able to align with the Jade Emperor in wisdom, insight, and purity—equal in their pristine nature. Thus, though their bodies are purely yin and near impurity, a subtle and wondrous fragrance of natural liberation arises from them.\n\nCompare it to worldly people dwelling in filth and corruption: if they could make their hearts, insights, and actions all abide in a land of purity, then the exquisite fragrance of liberation would likewise emanate from their persons.\n\nThis scripture is devoted entirely to the pure and singular liberation of truth, hence its conclusion focuses solely on the maidens’ fragrance to reveal its profound meaning.\n\nThough it is called fragrance, its essence must be understood through theory—not by clinging to material form.\n\nFor ordinary people, if they have no transgressions or faults, if they know the Dao and awaken to truth, and if every word they speak and every deed they perform is praised and admired by all, then their bodies are like those of the maidens—neither foul nor unclean, bearing a subtle and wondrous fragrance of liberation, heard by the blessed abodes of the heavens.\n\nThe maidens are like the impure body, while the fragrance is like my words and deeds. The fragrance pervading the heavens’ blessed abodes is like my words and deeds being seen throughout the ten thousand li. The six paths hearing the fragrance and attaining liberation is like virtuous words and virtuous deeds being practiced in the world, benefiting all people and things.\n\nThis is the path of cultivation, its flavor savored by all living beings.\n\nIf one were to conjecture thus recklessly, the meaning would be obscured and the intent stifled.\n\nThe subject humbly hopes that the Most Exalted Sage will discern this, and that the world will believe it.\n\nThe subject speaks with utmost sincerity.\n\nAt that time, the assembled celestial beings and guilty multitudes, having already been reborn in this supreme celestial palace through the grace of compassionate light, spontaneously awakened and understood the karmic causes of sin and virtue. Together with their retinues, they performed celestial dances and presented themselves before the Emperor of Heaven.\n\nThese beings, each filled with sorrow, spoke aloud:\n*\"For countless kalpas—thousands upon thousands—we wandered without sight of the Three Lights, perpetually enshrouded in darkness within the Three Evil Paths, enduring endless suffering.\"*\n\nBy the Emperor’s compassionate grace, we were illuminated, rescued, and reborn in heaven. All our evil deeds have been utterly extinguished, our bonds severed, and we have attained rebirth.\n\nWe now prostrate before the Emperor and take our places at the Dao’s threshold.\n\nAfter these celestial beings and guilty multitudes had spoken thus, they kowtowed and resumed their positions.\n\n**Right: *The Chapter of Awakening Through Light’s Reception*, which has been carefully collated, contains no errors.**\n\nThe subject humbly states:\nThe multitudes of living beings are burdened with heavy obstructions, their karmic consciousness obscured by accumulated sins, plunging them into hell. Even if they repent then, what use is it?\n\nYet now, by sudden grace, we not only escape suffering but ascend directly to the celestial palace—a fortune encountered once in a hundred million kalpas! This joy, beyond all expectation, knows no bounds.\n\nThough we have left suffering for bliss, it is still better to cultivate virtue in this world and ascend to the realm of joy directly. The living beings of this world should diligently sow good deeds, earnestly seek the True Dao, and not wait until they fall into hell to hope for heavenly mercy and seek liberation. Even if they attain it then, their bodies will have already endured countless sufferings—truly a cause for lamentation. The multitudes should reflect deeply upon this.\n\nThe subject speaks with utmost sincerity.\n\nAt that time, the Jade Emperor emitted a wondrous voice, addressing all the celestial saints of the ten directions:\n*\"Attend closely, you saints! These guilty ones, for eons past, though devoid of wisdom, committed the Ten Evils, their minds defiled by the Six Dusts, their threefold actions entangled. They acted at will, heedless of awakening, their hidden and manifest sins deepening daily. Abandoning the Dao and betraying Truth, they followed falsehood and rejected the right path. Every thought and impulse bound them further, so that after their lives ended, they fell into the Three Paths of woe, unable to escape.*\n\n*Had they not encountered this Dharma feast today, how could they have freed themselves?\"*\n\n**Right: *The Chapter of the Wondrous Voice Opening Salvation*, which has been carefully collated, contains no errors.**\n\nHowever, in the original text, *The Chapter of the Wondrous Voice* appears after the section where celestial beings are transferred and united. The subject observes that after the Jade Emperor’s manifestation in six forms—where the scent of liberation was heard, leading to awakening and the fulfillment of past karmic ties—he then emitted the wondrous voice to reinforce instruction before transferring and uniting the celestial beings with the Primordial Origin. The original sequence, where the Celestial Worthies descend and transmit the scriptures, is disordered.\n\nThe subject has thus rearranged and verified this, hoping to achieve coherence.\n\nThe subject humbly states:\nThe subject has heard in the scriptures: *\"The spirit gives life, the heart takes it.\"* Thus, upon reflecting deeply on the profound meaning, one understands that the heart’s function brings both harm and benefit beyond measure.\n\nAt birth, humans are merely the abode of spirit, with no inherent heart. Only when the Four Great Elements coalesce does the spirit congeal into the heart, and as the heart houses the spirit, it becomes detached from its origin.\n\nOnce the heart is detached, it generates thoughts. A single thought, once rooted, gives rise to a hundred actions, and from a hundred actions, myriad sins and virtues sprout. Thus, when this thought aligns with goodness, merit is accomplished; when it aligns with evil, guilt is sealed. This is none other than the power of the single heart.\n\nNow, observe the fall into the Six Realms: it was not due to external influences but arose from impure thoughts and actions, leading to karmic entanglements that plunged them into the Three Paths for endless ages, unable to transcend.\n\nThe Threefold Actions’ entanglements and the Six Dusts’ defilements stem not from anything outside the heart’s generation or the mind’s arising.\n\nThe Jade Emperor, in his boundless compassion, saves and guides all realms, fearing that though they may escape suffering through grace, their roots may not be steadfast enough for further cultivation. Thus, he emits the wondrous voice to clarify the nature of their former descent, so that all realms may recognize the Great Origin and no longer stray.\n\nThis is all from his merciful intent, vast and unwearied.\n\nThe common folk should heed the Emperor’s wondrous voice, uphold the precepts firmly, and avoid transgression. Only then can they ascend to heaven and attain fruition with ease. But if they grow negligent and disregard the precepts, they will sink into the sea of suffering—like trying to run on a tightrope while rolling a ball, with no return possible.\n\nDo not presume that the Emperor’s grace is always attainable.\n\nThe subject speaks with utmost sincerity.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Ones transformed into the Emperor of the Dao, who immediately, through divine power, did not alter his own place but transported all the celestial beings and humans to the **Yusheng Palace** of the **Jingming Pure Realm**, the gathering beneath the **Yuan Shi** (Primordial Origin). These multitudes were unaware and did not know.\n\nAt that moment, the Heavenly Sovereign presided over the assembly, seeing the **Yushi** (Jade Emperors) of the Ten Directions—all transformed bodies—come together. Before the assembly, the Heavenly Sovereign appeared like a boundless mirror, reflecting all their forms, each interpenetrating the others.\n\nThen the great assembly bowed in reverence and gazed upward.\n\nAmong the transformed bodies of the Jade Emperor, the **Saintly Central One** was the most majestic, fostering pure faith, strengthening resolve, and filling their hearts with joy, leaving no trace of retreat. His firm and unshakable spirit arose.\n\nNow, the celestial beings and humans, who had recently ascended to heaven, suddenly beheld the Heavenly Sovereign’s sublime gathering and the Dao-field, pristine and unparalleled, adorned with the **virtue of non-action**. They leapt in delight, all offering homage at once, exclaiming that they had never before witnessed such splendor.\n\nThe above *\"Chapter of Transplanting and Connecting Celestial Beings and Humans\"* has been cross-referenced and verified; there are no discrepancies.\n\nThe subject respectfully declares:\nThe **nature of the Law (dharma)** is equal and boundless, neither increased by addition nor diminished by subtraction. It is not distant when approached nor remote when viewed from afar. The terms **Saint**, **True**, **Heaven**, and **Human** were never originally distinct.\n\nYet how is it that living beings, embodied and concrete, stray from their origin and source? Even a hair’s breadth of deviation leads to error a thousand miles wide.\n\nThus, high and low are suddenly divided, and the common and the Saintly are utterly distinct. Though they may perceive each other, they remain separated by a vast chasm.\n\nNow the Jade Emperor, out of profound grace, **transplants** and **connects** those of suffering realms, elevating them all. Though the wondrous voice was emitted to clarify the roots of their offenses—both detailed and thorough—he still feared that the beings of all realms had not yet comprehended the subtleties of the **Law-nature**. Therefore, he manifested a different realm to demonstrate the **unobstructed reality of the Law-nature**.\n\nHence, without altering his own place, he transplanted and connected the celestial beings to the Yuan Shi gathering. From the perspective of the celestial beings, the Yuan Shi gathering lay far within the **ultimate exalted domain**. From the Yuan Shi gathering’s standpoint, the celestial realms appeared distant in the **most humble abode**.\n\nNow, the Jade Emperor, unmoved in his own place, brings the celestial beings and the Yuan Shi realm within reach—like the finger and palm—clearly visible before their eyes.\n\nIs this not the **mysterious operation of the Law-nature**, where heaven and humans share a single principle, and high and low are in perfect accord?\n\nAspiring scholars should study the *\"Chapter of Transplanting and Connecting\"* with deep reflection, savoring its profound mysteries. Then, within their own nature, the harmony of heaven and earth, and within their own hearts, the unity of the Saintly and the common, will merge and blend, boundless in their breadth.\n\nThis is not merely a comparison for those who seek to cultivate and verify the Dao below the immortals.\n\nThe Dao does not fail humanity; one should only redouble their diligence.\n\nThe subject, **Liang**, speaks with utmost sincerity.\n\nAt that time, the Ten Directions’ **transcendent sovereigns of all transformations** (化玉皇) and the **Celestial Lord** (天尊) all merged into one body. Rising from the **Law Assembly** (法席), they knelt facing north.\n\nThe **Celestial Lord** spoke: *\"In the past, after departing from this world, there was a realm called Radiant and Pure Auspicious Joy (光严妙乐). Its king was named Pure Virtue (净德). The king had a queen named Precious Moonlight (宝月光). Yet the king had no heir. One day, I pondered thus: ‘Now that I am aging, and there is no crown prince, when my body perishes, who will inherit the ancestral temples and the state?’\n\nHaving formed this thought, I immediately issued decrees to all **Daoist assemblies** (道众) across the palaces, ordering them to follow the established **rites and teachings** (科教), to hoist the **auspicious banners and canopies** (旛盖), to maintain purity and solemnity, to array offerings in abundance, and to perform **six-period Daoist rites** (六时行道), praying earnestly to the **True and Holy Saints** (真圣). After half a year, without wavering in my initial resolve, suddenly in the night, Queen Precious Moonlight dreamed of the **Supreme Dao Lord** (太上道君) and the **Assemblies of the Most Perfect** (诸至真), whose forms were golden and jade-like, a pair of pure and radiant beings. They rode a **five-colored dragon chariot** (五色龙舆), surrounded by **glowing banners and luminous flags** (耀景旌), sheltered beneath **resplendent cloud canopies** (明霞盖). At that moment, the **Supreme Dao Lord** sat serenely in the chariot, cradling an infant whose body emitted a hundred billion rays of light from every pore, illuminating all the palaces in a myriad of **treasure hues** (百宝色). The **standards and banners** (幢节) led the way, floating through the air.\n\nThe queen’s heart filled with joy, and she reverently received the infant, kneeling in homage before the **Supreme Dao Lord** and saying: ‘The king has no heir. I humbly beg You to grant this child as the sovereign of our realm. May You, in Your boundless compassion, pity and permit my wish.’\n\nThe **Supreme Dao Lord** replied to the queen: ‘I shall specially bestow him upon you.’\n\nThe queen then bowed in gratitude to the **Supreme Dao Lord** and took the child. Upon awakening from the dream, she conceived. After a year of gestation, in the **Year of the Dragon-Horse (丙午)**, on the **ninth day of the first month at noon**, she gave birth to the prince in the royal palace.\n\nAt the time of his birth, his body blazed with **treasure-like light** (宝光焰), filling the entire kingdom. His appearance was wondrous and exquisite; all who beheld him were captivated.\n\nAs a youth, he was **quick-witted and insightful**; as he grew, he became **compassionate and benevolent**. Within his realm, he took all stored treasures and every kind of wealth and distributed them to the **impoverished and suffering**, the **widowed, orphaned, and solitary**, those **without refuge**, and all **starving, diseased, and crippled beings**. His **mercy and harmony** (仁爱和逊) were boundless, and the songs of the people praised him. His influence extended to distant lands; all under heaven revered and followed him. The prince was called **Return-to-Ren** (归仁太子), and his father rejoiced.\n\nAfter this, the king suddenly passed away, and the prince ascended the throne. Bowing to the fleeting nature of life, he proclaimed to his ministers: ‘The succession must follow the **Dao**.’\n\nThus, he abandoned his kingdom and retreated to **Universal Clarity Auspicious Joy Mountain** (普明香严山) to cultivate the **Dao**. His practice reached fruition, and he transcended.\n\nFollowing this, he passed through **eight hundred kalpas** (劫), always relinquishing his kingdom for the sake of all beings, **severing his attachments** to pursue **Daoist cultivation** (学道). Afterward, for another **eight hundred kalpas**, he practiced **medicinal arts** (行药), healing the sick and rescuing beings, making them **secure and content**.\n\nWhen that kalpa ended, he again traversed **eight hundred kalpas**, employing **skillful means** (方便), opening the **Daoist treasure repositories** (道藏), expounding **sacred scriptures** (灵章), and **proclaiming the true transformation** (正化). He **extolled the divine powers** (神功), aiding realms and saving people—from the **hidden to the manifest**.\n\nAfter this, for another **eight hundred kalpas**, he **endured suffering and humiliation** (忍辱), **sacrificing his own flesh and blood** (舍己血肉) for the sake of his practice.\n\nThus, he cultivated for **three thousand two hundred kalpas** before attaining the **Golden Immortal** (金仙) stage, named **Pure and Natural Awakening Sovereign Thus-Come** (清净自然觉王如来). He taught all **bodhisattvas** (菩萨) the **sudden insight into the Great Vehicle’s true essence** (顿悟大乘正宗) and guided them into the **progressive path of the Mysterious Dao of Emptiness** (渐入虚无妙道).\n\nHaving cultivated further for **a hundred million kalpas**, he finally attained the **Celestial Sovereign** (玉帝) stage.\n\nHaving spoken thus, the **Law Assembly’s pure congregation** (法筵清众) in unison exclaimed: *\"Such a marvel has never been heard before!\"*\n\nThis is the **\"Chapter of the Transformation and Birth\"** (化生本行章), which has now been cross-verified and contains no errors.\n\nI, your subject **Liang**, humbly state: *\"The **Supreme Cause and Effect** (无上大因缘) and **Supreme Virtue** (大功德), since the beginningless past, have never been as vast as the Celestial Sovereign’s transformation and birth.*\n\nThe **Celestial Lord** (天尊) established this **subtle Daoist site** (微妙道场) to **display the Three Realms** (三界), desiring to **proclaim the great cause and virtue**. Therefore, He first caused the **Celestial Sovereign** (玉帝) to manifest light, **revealing the grand transformation** (大神化), before **expounding the secrets** (秘密) and **detailed the origins of the Transformation and Birth** (化生本行).\n\nThus, after the **Celestial Sovereign** demonstrated the **transplanting and connecting of heaven and humans** (移接天人), He **divided and merged** (自分而合), **returned to the origin and restored the root** (返本还元), **manifesting the Supreme Dao Body** (无上道身). When paying homage to the **Primordial Sovereign** (元始), during the audience, He never once spoke a word to the **Celestial Lord** (天尊).\n\nThe **Celestial Lord** and the **Celestial Sovereign** (玉帝) share a **single luminous mind** (心光), **neither one nor two**. Hence, the **Celestial Sovereign** faced north and knelt in homage, and the **Golden Mouth’s wondrous speech** (金口妙言) directly proclaimed the **Transformation and Birth**.\n\nObserving this today, when the **Celestial Sovereign’s body** (帝身) **divides to manifest all the heavens** (分现诸天), it is the **True One’s universal transformation** (真一应化). When these **divided manifestations** (分现诸身) **merge into unity** (合为一体), it is the **True One’s immovable essence** (真一不动).\n\nThe **Celestial Lord’s** establishment of this **subtle Daoist site** is to **proclaim the great cause and virtue**. The **Golden Mouth’s proclamation** of the **Transformation and Birth** is to **let all beings of the Three Realms know the vastness of the Celestial Sovereign’s cause and virtue**, so they may emulate and cultivate accordingly.\n\nThe **True One’s Non-dual Path** (真一不二法门) is this; the **Pure and Liberated Dao** (清净解脱之道) is also this.\n\nAll beings should **contemplate the Celestial Sovereign’s Transformation and Birth**, and **strive to build the Supreme Mysterious Merit** (无上之玄功), so that their **virtue may be towering and vast** (功德巍巍).\n\nAgain, observe how the **Celestial Sovereign** **divides from unity** (自一而分) and **merges back into unity** (自分而一). Thus, one may **enter the True Non-dual Path** (造真一不二之门) and **attain the Supreme Dao** (成无上道).\n\nIf one **endures no hardship**, from **a single moment** (自一时) to **the four seasons** (以至於四时), from **a single year** (自一年以至於百年) to **a hundred years**, from **a single lifetime** (自一生) to **many lifetimes**, from **a single kalpa** (自一劫) to **a hundred million kalpas**, with **unyielding diligence**, then even the **coarse and impure body** (凡身浊质) may **shed defilement and become true** (离垢成真). The **Great Maitreya Heaven** (大弥罗天) will **prepare the way for your ascent** (铺张分位), allowing you to **attain realization** (登证).\n\nWith the **Three Realms’ attendants** (列侍三境) serving and approaching the **Celestial Sovereign**, what further difficulty could there be?\n\nAll beings and those who cultivate should **ponder this deeply**. I, your subject **Liang**, humbly state.\n\nAt that time, a **jewel maiden** (玉女) from the assembly named **Moonlight** (夜光) arose from her seat, **adjusting her attire** (严整衣冠) and **composing her steps** (从容雅步). Kneeling before the **Celestial Lord**, she said: *\"I, your subject, have been fortunate in the past to serve You in person, offering reverent and sincere homage. This has spanned a hundred million kalpas.\"*\n\nThe **Three Pure Ones’ realm**—golden palaces, jade capitals—where stillness and serenity reign, unbounded freedom and joyous ease prevail. Within the sacred domain, they dine on the sounds of **dharma**, yet never before have they witnessed such a rare and wondrous sight.\n\nI do not know how, within the luminous **Dao**, the **Ten Directions’ celestial beings** manifest their sacred forms, all bearing the **Celestial Sovereign’s transformed **dharma-body**□. The **Heavenly Pure Ones**, **Mystic Conduct Immortals**, and **Spiritual Consorts** attend as guardians. These **jewel maidens**, their features noble and refined, their forms exquisitely wondrous, surpass all comparison.\n\nFurther, by the **Celestial Sovereign’s divine power**, they are now all gathered in the **Pure Vacuity Heaven**. I do not know by what cause and condition this **jewel maiden** has attained such a supreme **color-body**?\n\nReflecting on the **Celestial Lord’s** boundless compassion, He enlightens me to my unenlightened state. Then the **Celestial Lord** spoke to the **Moonlight Jewel Maiden**, saying:\n\n*\"You have only recently entered the sacred **Dao-flow**. Though wise, you do not yet comprehend fully. These **jewel maidens**—from countless kalpas past, they cultivated **mystic conduct**, mastered the **gates of liberation**, shared **pure faith**, **pure understanding**, **pure mindfulness**, **pure conduct**, **pure body**, **pure heart**, **pure intention**, **pure fruit**, and **pure retribution**. They possessed **great compassion** and **great pity**, sheltering all beings as a mother cherishes her child, loving them as her own. They upheld the precepts with singular devotion, their minds immersed in the **Great Dao**, observing strict **vegetarian abstinence** and taking grand vows. For countless kalpas, they reverently served the **Jade Emperor**.\n\nThese **jewel maidens** are not truly women—they are **Heaven’s utmost purity**, manifesting as **jewel maidens** to rescue sentient beings. Thus, their **bodies, colors, divine powers, and wisdom**—whether hidden or revealed—are in harmony with the **Celestial Sovereign’s**.\n\nWhen **Moonlight** heard this, her heart opened in enlightenment. She bowed in joy and returned to her seat in silence.\n\n**Right, the *Chapter of the Jewel Maiden’s Mystic Conduct***, having been cross-verified, contains no errors. Your subject humbly states:\n\nIt is said, *\"Man does not know his body is sacred; a horse does not know his body is a dragon.\"* Truly, these words are profound.\n\nThe **jewel maiden’s** body is of **pure yin** essence. **Pure yin** is close to impurity, and thus it is fitting that her path to **purity** is arduous. Yet now, through cultivating **mystic conduct**, she has mastered the **gates of liberation**. By *\"mastered\"* is meant **liberation from all bonds**.\n\nBut tracing the root of her attainment—it began with cultivating **mystic conduct**, and **mystic conduct** itself stems from **great compassion and great pity**, along with her **faith, understanding, mindfulness, conduct, body, heart, and intention**—all purified. Thus, her **fruit and retribution** are without exception pure, leading to **complete liberation**.\n\nAh! A **jewel maiden** of **yin’s impure** nature, yet able to cultivate **compassion and purity**, to practice **mystic conduct**, and attain **liberation**, serving the **Jade Emperor**—and further, her **body, colors, divine powers, and wisdom** hidden or revealed, all in harmony with the **Celestial Sovereign’s**—even to the point where beings of the **Six Realms**, upon smelling her **body-scent**, also attain liberation! How vast and boundless are the **merits and retributions** of **mystic conduct**!\n\nAll beings in this world, endowed with **original qi** from the **Primordial Beginning**, were never inherently different from these **jewel maidens**. If one cultivates **mystic conduct** to match theirs, how could their future **realization** differ?\n\nAll living beings should strive earnestly, emulating this path. As for the earlier chapter where the **Jade Emperor** expounded the **Dao of pure liberation** to the **Ten Directions**, this is precisely it. The **Jade Emperor’s** unsaid words should also be pondered.\n\nYour subject **Liang** humbly states:\n\nAt that time, the **High Void, Pure Clarity Heavenly Sovereign**, with celestial attendants, rode the **Eight Auspicious Celestial Chariot**, sheltered beneath the **Nine-Light Jewel Umbrella**, playing **mysterious songs** and **wondrous music**, reciting **infinite sacred verses**, scattering **heavenly treasure flowers** and **Heaven’s True Fragrance**. They flew through the air, arriving before the **Dao**.\n\nBy the **Celestial Sovereign’s** mighty **威神** (awe-inspiring spirit-power), these **treasure flowers** transformed in midair into a **jewel umbrella**, sheltering all beneath its vast canopy without omission.\n\nSeeing this rare spectacle, the **High Void, Pure Clarity Heavenly Sovereign** bowed deeply and knelt, reporting to the **Celestial Sovereign**:\n\n*\"Your humble subject was negligent in attending the **dharma-assembly** at our last meeting. Today’s auspicious celebration has raised this **dharma-bridge**, benefiting both **mortal and immortal**, **common and sacred**, all bathing in the **Celestial Grace**. The radiant light shines forth, manifesting a **rare form**, illuminating the **Ten Directions**, the **Four Heavenly Kings**, the **Six Desires**, and all **lands of bliss**. The **true and sacred assemblies** witnessing this light all gather in response. Below, it illuminates the **Ten Directions’ boundless worlds**, aligning with the **Mysterious Capital**, approaching the **Nine Heavens**, where **spirit winds** play music, harmonizing **pitch and tone**, resounding through the **cloud courts**, all forming **sacred verses**.\n\nAll beings attain **Dao-transformation**. Even the **Yin Valley Iron Enclosure**, the **Eternal Night Nine Abysses**, and all tormented beings in the **Six Realms of Hell**—all receive the light’s power and are reborn in the heavens, experiencing joy.\n\nYour subject’s scattered **heavenly treasure flowers** swiftly coalesce into this umbrella, covering all beneath its **awe-inspiring spirit-power**. Your subjects’ **thousand-kalpa merits** have now ripened, the **Nine Heavens’ destiny fulfilled**, the **Royal Dao** vast and unobstructed, the **True Teaching** flourishing. Today’s great auspiciousness is universally acknowledged for its **mysterious virtues**.\n\nAt that time, the **High Void, Pure Clarity Heavenly Sovereign** praised the **Celestial Sovereign** with this **gāthā**:\n\n*\"Golden **jiao-gate**, the **Primordial Ancestor** of the **Heavenly Vault**,\nThe **Exalted Jade Emperor**, most honored.\nHis **mystic form** surpasses all heavens,\nHis **compassionate light** illuminates the **Three Realms**.\nThe **True and Sacred** **Dao-Master** of **mystic vision**,\nHeaven and man alike rely on him as their guide.\nWith **Great Vehicle teachings**, he points out the lost,\nThe **One True Principle** revealed to all.\nHis **merits and virtues** are boundless as the void,\nPraise for him is endless and inexhaustible.\nThis **Heavenly

perfection**, pure and clear,\nWith **wisdom and eloquence** unparalleled,\nThe **Supreme Dao/Way**, the **Supreme Sovereign**,\nHe opens and liberates all beings—\nThus he performs this **light** of **manifestation**.\n\nHere ends the *Ode of Praise to the Heavenly Sovereign*, which has been cross-verified and contains no discrepancies.\nThe humble servant respectfully states:\nThe **Jade Emperor’s** merits and virtues are vast—\nWords cannot fully praise them,\nNor analogies exhaust their grandeur.\nEven if all beings in the **sandhi-world**,\nWith countless tongues, extol and beautify him,\nThey could never exhaust his praise—\nHow much more so with one mortal tongue!\n\nNow, the **High Void’s** clear and luminous Heavenly Sovereign is extolled in this **gatha**,\nFor fear that beings in the **Three Realms** might yet remain unaware of the Emperor’s **merits and virtues**.\nThough skilled artisans could imitate the true forms of **Yin and Yang**,\nAnd depict the divine radiance of sun and moon,\nEven the finest craftsman could not fully employ his artistry—\nHow much more impossible to exhaust the Emperor’s **virtue/power**, lofty and boundless in scope?\n\nThough this **gatha** is beautiful and profound,\nIt still falls short of capturing even a fraction of the Emperor’s **virtue/power**,\nYet the Heavenly Sovereign’s intent is to use this as a pretext\nTo inspire the **endless teachings** of the **Golden Mouth**.\n\nThus, the **gatha** of praise and extolment\nDoes not hesitate to repeat itself in detail.\nThe **Heavenly Sovereign** perceives their sincerity,\nAnd so, in the following chapter, continues with **sacred instruction**:\n\n*\"Thus the humble servant speaks with reverence.\nAt that time, the **High Void’s** clear and luminous Heavenly Sovereign,\nHaving delivered the **gatha** of praise and extolment,\nTurned to the **Four Assemblies** and declared:\nThis Emperor’s **body** is the **Dao-body**,\nNot an ordinary form.\nThis is the **body of boundless merit**,\nThe **body of pure, natural clarity**,\nThe **immutable, unshakable, supreme, true, and empty Law-body** of divine intelligence.\nHis **mystic aura** and **mystic presence** are vast and unconfined,\nHis **name** resounds throughout the **Ten Directions**,\nNo darkness remains unilluminated,\nHis **divine marvels** are resplendent and awe-inspiring—\nBeyond all measure or description.\n\nThis Emperor’s **body** is not the result of **conditional merit**,\nNor does it arise from cultivation through **deliberate action**.\nThough in past **kalpas** he descended to the mortal realm,\nHe demonstrated the **Great Divine Power** while maintaining his **pure body**,\nNever ceasing to **manifest in the Jade Vault**,\nTo **multiply his forms** and **adapt to all regions**,\nTo benefit all beings, elevate them beyond the **worldly shore**,\nAnd universally propagate the **teachings of the Dao/Way**,\nEnlightening future generations,\nGuiding them in **faithful practice**,\nAnd helping them attain **True Reality** and the **Dao/Way**.\nThrough these **merits and virtues** of **ornamentation**,\nHis **light** perpetually fills the heavens,\nHis **divine intelligence** penetrates all mysteries—\nBeyond all calculation or comprehension.\n\nThis **body’s light** possesses **wondrous names**,\nSuch as the **Light of Great Divine Power**,\nThe **Light of Great Compassion and Great Pity**,\nThe **Light of Great Joy and Renunciation**,\nThe **Light of Great Endurance and Great Forbearance**,\nThe **Light of Great Equanimity**,\nThe **Light of Great Gentleness and Harmony**,\nThe **Light of Great Freedom and Great Sovereignty**,\nThe **Light of Great Benefit**,\nThe **Light of Great Fulfillment**,\nThe **Light of Great Wisdom**,\nThe **Light of Great Auspiciousness**,\nThe **Light of Great Liberation**,\nThe **Light of Great Refuge**,\nThe **Light of Great Merit**,\nThe **Light of Great Perfection**,\nThe **Light of Great Unobstructedness**—\nA **light** none can surpass.\n\nThus, you who wish to behold this Emperor\nCannot do so—\nFor you still cling to **impure actions** of **body, speech, and mind**,\nTo **afflictions** and **worldly deeds**,\nWhich obstruct your vision,\nPreventing you from seeing the Emperor’s **compassionate face**.\n\nNow, for you who gather here,\nI proclaim the **Law of Clearing Obstacles**—\nYou must all diligently follow it.\nAt that moment, the **Four Assemblies** rejoiced beyond measure,\nEach prostrated before the **Supreme Sovereign’s** seat,\nBowed in homage,\nAnd eagerly wished to hear more.\n\nThe **Heavenly Sovereign** spoke:\n*\"The **Law of Clearing Obstacles** requires\nThe generation of **Great Compassion**,\nNo **doubt or confusion**,\nNo **greed or anger**,\nNo **lustful desire**,\nNo **jealousy or envy**,\nNo **harm or malice**,\nNo **worldly attachments**,\nNo **worldly thoughts**,\nNo **greed or envy**,\nNo **infatuation with sounds and colors**,\nNo **clinging to right or wrong**,\nNo **hatred or love**,\nNo **discrimination**,\nNo **arrogance**,\nNo **fixation**—\nConcentrate your **mind**, purify your **thoughts**,\nSubdue all **spirits** within,\nYour **heart** as boundless as the **Great Void**,\nInner and outer **purity** untainted,\nAccepting all without exclusion,\nReceiving all without reservation—\nNever allowing external **evil forces** to disrupt your **Supreme Dao/Way**,\nTo drag you away from **True Reality**,\nTo destroy your **divine essence**,\nTo steal your **supreme treasures**,\nOr to condemn you to **endless kalpas** of **worldly existence**,\nTo sink into the **netherworld’s snares**,\nWhere **myriad demons** assail you,\nAnd for **hundreds of thousands of kalpas**\nYou hear no **mystic teachings**,\nSuffer **torment by ghosts and spirits**,\nAnd wander from life to death.\n\nThus, you must all **resolve in mind**,\nTo **protect the True Dao/Way** faithfully,\nNever letting it slip away.\n\nAs previously stated,\nAll these **obstacles** must be **severed and abandoned** by you—\nYour **body** will then attain **purity**,\nAnd you will transcend all **difficulties**.\nThis is called the **Dao-Treasure**,\nThe **supporting pillar of the Law**.\n\nFurthermore, you must **cultivate and uphold** this **sacred text**,\nAs if standing before the Emperor himself—\nWith **reverence and admiration**,\nWith **devotion to his form**,\nWith **praise of his name**—\nOnly then will you behold his **compassionate face**,\nAll be **protected and guided**,\nUniversally hear the **mystic teachings**,\nAnd **personally offer reverence and sustenance**,\nNever again falling into **worldly cycles**.\n\nAt that time, the **Four Assemblies** heard these words and rejoiced,\nExclaiming praise never before encountered.\nHere ends the *Chapter of the Sovereign’s Teachings and Severing Obstacles*,\nWhich has been cross-verified and contains no discrepancies.\n\nThe humble servant respectfully states:\nA **sutra** is a **path**,\nA **method of cultivation**.\nWhen mortals uphold a **sutra**, there are two **gates of practice**:\nOne is **recitation with the mouth**,\nOne is **holding in the mind**.\n\n**Recitation with the mouth** refers to **verbal praise**;\n**Holding in the mind** refers to **faithful practice through intention**.\n**Recitation with the mouth** should take **holding in the mind** as its foundation,\nAnd **holding in the mind** should take **recitation with the mouth** as its priority—\nThe two **mutually support** each other,\nAnd **merits and virtues** are thus fulfilled.\nTo **neglect one in favor of the other** is to fail in **merits and virtues**.\nThus, the **sutra** combines both **recitation and holding**.\n\nTo **recite without holding** is to **utter empty words**,\nWhile the **mind** remains unbenefited;\nTo **hold without reciting** is for the **mind** to stir,\nYet the **intent** remains unexpressed.\nBoth must be **pursued together** for the task to be completed.\nThis is the **doctrine of recitation and holding**.\n\nAs for **reciting and holding** the **Jade Emperor’s sutra**,\nYou must **follow and emulate** the Emperor’s **merits and virtues**,\nAnd **mirror his cultivation and realization**—\nOnly then is it possible.\n\nTo **follow and emulate** involves five **gates of practice**:\n1. **Reverence and admiration**,\n2. **Confession and severance of obstructing deeds**,\n3. **Accumulation of merit for mutual benefit**,\n4. **Tolerance and divine insight**,\n5. **True Unity and Transformation**.」\n\n「The so-called **Reverence and Admiration** refers to what the **sutra** says: **dwelling on** the **reverent form** of the Emperor, crafting the Emperor’s **image**, praising his **name**, and reciting and pondering the **teachings** of the **sutra**.\n\nThe so-called **Confession and Severance of Obstructing Deeds** refers to what the **sutra** says: the **methods of severing obstructions** are fully recorded in various **teachings**.\n\n**Accumulation of Merit for Mutual Benefit** refers to what the **sutra** says: **manifesting transformations** of the **body**, benefiting the **world**, and propagating the **teachings** of the **Dao**.\n\n**Tolerance and Divine Insight** refers to what the **sutra** says: the **mind** as vast as the **Great Emptiness**, containing all without exclusion, embracing all without reservation—**compassionate means** and **perfect understanding** are its essence.\n\n**True Unity and Transformation** refers to what the **sutra** says: the **body** remains **pure and undefiled**, ever present in the **Golden Gates of the Celestial Palace**, appearing in accordance with the **direction** as needed.\n\nThose who practice according to these five **gates** with diligence shall attain the **position of the Great Pīlū (Pīlū) Heavenly Immortal Deities**.\n\nAfter three years of practice, all **deities** shall hold them in **respect and awe**, and **demons** shall be subdued in **form**.\nAfter ten years of practice, all **ten directions** shall serve them, and their **spirit** shall ascend to **Jade Purity**.\nAfter two **periods of time** (i.e., twenty years), their **virtue and power** shall be complete, and their **body** shall soar to **Jade Purity**, whereupon they shall attain the **Three Bodies**.\n\nThe **Three Bodies** are those described in the **sutra**: the **body of boundless virtue**, the **pure and natural body**, and the **unshakable, supreme Law Body of True Void**, where **divine wisdom** abides.\n\nAspiring **cultivators** and those who **recite the sutra** should **contemplate and act** upon these words.\n\nIf one **recites this sutra with the mouth** yet **violates the precepts** with the **body**, the **sutra**’s **wondrous sounds** and **methods of severing obstructions** shall be in vain—then the *Chapter of Divine Retribution and Verification* fully records their **fate**.\n\nAspiring **cultivators** and **reciters** should **revere and fear** accordingly.\n\nThus concludes the **Highest Jade Emperor’s Original

Out of benevolent thought for the common folk, I universally radiate divine light, illuminating the **dharma-realm**, bestowing the **Dao’s shade** upon the six **ordinary beings** and four **sages**. I consider that the ordinary folk have but a fleeting lifespan, the kalpa is nearing its end, the true path must be followed to save the countless people, so that those who cultivate the **True Way** may have hope of rising lightly, and the common folk of this latter age may all attain longevity and prosperity.*\n\nSince antiquity, the ***Primordial Origin Cavern Mystery Divine Treasure Scarlet Scripture Jade Edition True Text*** emerged before the **Primordial Origin**, within the **void**, when heaven and earth had no roots, the sun and moon no light—dim and murky, without ancestor or lineage, without **qi** or form, without color or name, without shape or trace, without sound or voice—utterly chaotic, its **divine script** obscure, sometimes existing, sometimes vanishing. The **Two Principles** awaited it to divide, the **Great Sun** awaited it to illuminate; the **divine diagram** transformed the cosmic order, the **mysterious symbols** shifted with fate. Seizing the **Dao’s opportunity** and responding to the cosmic flow, it thus came into being. The **Jade Emperor** bestowed upon me the **Divine Treasure Secret Seal** and the **Unthinkable Divine Spell**, so that heaven and earth obtained it and were divided, the **Three Lights** obtained it and radiated brilliance. The **divine script** flourished luxuriantly, its mystery reflected in the **Upper Purity**, emanating from the **Primordial Azure Sky**, yet its hue was undetermined, its branches curving and twisting, beyond tracing or scrutiny.\n\nThe **Primordial Origin** refined it in the **Cavern Yang** hall and forged it in the **Flowing Fire** court, polishing its true form and radiating its luminous glow—**Cavern Yang’s essence** was crimson, hence its name, the *Scarlet Scripture*. When the **divine diagram** blazed forth, the **Ten Thousand Emperors** paid homage to the **True One**, flying through the void and walking on empty air, circling the **Upper Palace**, burning incense and scattering flowers, chanting the **Divine Verses** with their mouths. At that time, heaven sent down **Twelve Mysterious Auspices**, earth emitted **Twenty-Four Responses**, the **Upper Palace** celebrated the **Nine Heavens’ Cavern Depths**, and praised the **Three Heavens’ Precious Clarity**. The **divine wind** having stirred, the **Imperial Dao** was universally spread.\n\nThe **Primordial Origin** ascended to decree, the **Great True One** pressed the brush, the **Jade Consort** swept the mat, casting **golden tablets** and carving the *Scarlet Scripture Jade Edition*. The **Five Elders** held the **sacred talisman**, concealing it in the **Nine Heavens’ Cavern Depths**. The **Jade Maiden** attended to the incense, **Great Hua** held the cloth, the **Jade Boys** served as guards, and the **Jade Platform** faced the **Upper Courtyard**, where the **Nine Heavens’ Sacred Edict** was inscribed—unheard by ghosts or gods. Thus, heaven treasured it to bring about **floating prosperity**, earth concealed it to bring about **tranquility**, the **Five Emperors** wielded it to achieve **stabilization**, the **Three Lights** rode upon it to attain **high clarity**, the **Upper Sages** revered it to reach **divinity**, the **High Exalted** held it to attain **True Perfection**, the **Five Sacred Peaks** followed it to gain **spiritual resonance**, the **Son of Heaven** obtained it to bring about **governance**, and the **national lineage** enjoyed it for **great peace**.\n\nIt is indeed the **mysterious virtue** of the **divine script**, the **primordial root** of heaven and earth. Its **might and spirit** are vast and boundless, its **great transformation** sweeping and eternal, serving as the **foundation of the divine**. Its measure is unfathomable, towering in the **Great Void**. Its **true clarity** is fixed; now it is time to put it into practice.\n\nAt that time, the **Primordial Origin** transformed the cosmic order, the **mysterious symbols** opened the diagram, the **divine script** flourished luxuriantly, the **spiritual essence** spread across the **Five Directions**, dividing heaven and earth, enlightening all beings. This is the **great foundation’s work**; can it be briefly revealed in the **Divine Treasure Repository**?\n\nNow, the **Imperial Dao** is universally spread, its blessings reaching the **Ten Directions**. Gazing upward at the **kalpa’s end**, the **true wind** must be followed. My sincere wish is to spread the **Dao’s shade** to the **eight far reaches**, let the **true wind** scatter across the **orchid groves**, so that even withering branches may aspire to the **Primordial Yang’s abundance**, and decayed bones may receive the **Cavern Depths’ sacred blessings**.\n\nI humbly address the **Primordial Benevolence**, extending my **sincere supplication** below. Only by your pity and compassion may I hope to obtain the **Divine Treasure True Text’s transmission**, and teach those who have not yet heard?\n\nThus, the **Primordial Origin Celestial Sovereign** patted the table and raised his voice, concentrating his **True Essence** in deep contemplation. Observing that the time had arrived, he declared to all the **True Saints** of the **cosmic assembly**: *\"The principles of yin and yang are now determined, the **kalpa’s numbers** are calculated, the **River Source’s movements** are observed, the **heavenly degrees** are recorded, the **seed-people** are selected, and the **Great Void** is pointed out. The **Nine Mysteries** resound, and yet the **Three Millennia** remain unopened to common speech—it is as though a barrier obstructs the path to the **True**. At that time, the **Five Elders Supreme Emperor** repeatedly questioned, and after a long while, the **Primordial Origin Celestial Sovereign** lowered his gaze and sighed deeply: 'Alas! How profound it is! The matters you now inquire—are they not distant?\n\nThis is the **Primordial Origin’s Divine Treasure**, the **true text of void and naturalness**. It gives rise to heaven and earth, enlightens the **divine**, stabilizes the **Five Sacred Peaks**, and brings peace to the people. The **Divine Treasure** is profoundly mysterious, the **Most Exalted** of all things. Heaven sends forth **mysterious auspices**, and the **spiritual** responds naturally.\n\nNow, the **Three Heavens** are in **harmonious motion**, the **Six Heavens** follow the **Dao’s course**, and the **heterodox teachings** are opening their transformations. There will be **thirty-six thousand kinds of Dao** to choose from for those who seek the **True Way**. When this **Dao’s course** concludes, after the **Three Dragons**, in the year **Gengzi**, all **impure qi** will dissipate, and the **heavens will celebrate in assembly**. Then my **True Dao** will be followed.\n\nFor now, you may entrust it to me, and it shall be recorded in the **Upper Palace**. It has not yet been revealed in the **lower world**. The **mysterious teachings** have restrictions; they cannot be casually transmitted.\"*\n\nYou may proceed to the **Spiritual Capital of Purple Micro** in the **Upper Palace**, there to listen to the **Heavenly Resonance** at the **Golden Gate**, and receive the **Divine Decree** from the **Celestial Sovereign**.\n\nThen you shall be instructed in the **Celestial Scriptures** to oversee the **Primordial Beginning’s Heaven**. At that time, the **Five Elders of the Supreme Dao** and the **Assemblage of the True Saints**, holding incense and observing the **precepts**, wandered the **Cloud Paths** and issued their command to the **Ten Heavens**. They ascended to the **Upper Palace of the Great Primordial Mysterious Auspicious Jade Capital**, the **Celestial Cold Souls’ Hall of the Supreme Dao**, and received the **Divine Decree**—only then did they comprehend the **Heavenly Truth’s** nobility and rarity, too precious to be casually heard.\n\nUpon their return, they further consulted the **Primordial Beginning’s Celestial Sovereign** regarding the **rituals of the precepts**, humbly declining their inadequacy. Then the **Celestial Sovereign**, in compassionate benevolence, opened the **Spiritual Gate** and commanded the **Five Elders of the Supreme Dao** to reveal the ***Primordial Beginning’s Spiritually Precious Red Book of Jade Editions with True Scriptures***,* inscribed in **golden script and jade seals**, containing **subtle and secret** decrees to govern the **Great Illumination of Heaven and Earth**, the **Perfect Heavenly Incantation**, and the **Jade Chapters**. These were entrusted to the **Five Elders of the Supreme Dao** and the **Assemblage of the True Saints**, instructing them to follow the **Mysterious Teachings** and adhere to the **methods** to transmit them.\n\nI dare to speak: I observe that at the **Five Elders’** unmanifested beginning, the **Two Qi** had not yet divided, and the **Ten Thousand Forms** had not yet emerged. Reverently considering the **Primordial Beginning’s Supreme Dao**, it **congealed the Dao’s qi** in the **Chaotic Void**, and arranged the **True Scriptures** in the **Faint and Remote** divine winds, which then fanned and caused the **Two Qi** to separate. Once the **Two Qi** divided, the **Ten Thousand Forms** began to manifest.\n\nThen it descended the **congealed Dao’s qi** and bestowed the **arranged True Scriptures**, embedding them as the **River Luo’s** writings, thereby establishing **Human Dao** and governing the **Three Realms**. The **congealed Dao’s qi** and the **arranged True Scriptures** are what the present world calls **True Scriptures and Spiritually Precious Auspices**.\n\nYet the **Great True Scriptures** serve to distinguish **Heaven and Earth**, to regulate **Yin and Yang**, and to shape the **flowing and standing** of mountains and rivers, as well as the **birth and formation** of all beings—all these are the work of the **True Scriptures**. This is the **mechanism of creation and transformation**, the **divine function of Heaven and Earth**, which has yet never been transmitted to the **lower world**.\n\nOnly the **seals for guiding sentient beings, suppressing disasters, and subduing demons** are now seen in the world. These are the various **incantations** found in the ***Heavenly Incantations Section***. However, since the **scriptures** entered the world, transmitted by the **Upper True Ones** and received by the **lower immortals**, those who transmitted were not all **True Ones**, and those who received were not all **one person**, discrepancies in wording—whether detailed or concise, refined or coarse—are inevitable. Some texts, like the ***Heavenly Incantations Section’s** incantations for opening gates*, may be overly elaborate or lacking coherence, causing those who recite them to doubt their authenticity.\n\nI humbly follow the **Golden Gate’s** decrees, diligently cross-referencing and verifying the **ancient texts**, yet I dare not further discuss the **unconnected meanings** or **incoherent phrasing** found elsewhere. Only the **concise versions** of the **scriptures** may be deemed correct, lest the world’s doubts in recitation grow fiercer.\n\nI speak with utmost reverence. At that time, the **Eastern Divine Realm’s Incantation Decree** received by the **Ancient Elder of the Azure Celestial Sovereign** in the **Green Spiritual Capital of the Tranquil Treasure Forest**:\n\nThe **Eastern Nine Qi**, the **Azure Sovereign of the Primordial Emperor**, with **Emerald Constellations** piled high, within which dwells an **Ancient One**, overseeing and verifying the **divine diagrams and talismans**, gathering the **Qi** and elevating the **immortals**.\n\nThe **seal** here is the **precious scripture of the Azure Sovereign**—the **first twenty-four characters**, inscribed on the **Primordial Platform of the Nine Heavens**, commanding the **Nine Heavens’ Celestial Sovereigns** to verify the **divine diagrams and talismans of immortals**. The **Year Star** aids the **Liver**, while **Angle and Shen** subdue the **True**. **Dui and Fang**, **Heart and Wei**, govern the **Four Seasons** in their **cyclical rotation**.\n\n「The **Qi** of the **Jī** constellation governs the seven stars, while **Zhèngdòu** presides over the luminous wheel.\nThey receive the **Qi** and capture the false, sweeping away calamities and dispersing the **non-virtue** masses.\n\nThe **seal** here is the **first thirty-two characters** of the sacred scripture, inscribed upon the **Eastern Palace of the Purple Micro** in the **Hall of Eastern Splendor**, commanding the **Celestial Officials** to rectify the **Heavenly divisions and degrees**. The **Eastern Mountain**’s divine incantation summons the **Nine Heavens**, while the **Red Book Talisman** restrains the **Assembly of the Netherworld Mountains**. Bound demons and sentient spirits are slain without reprieve—all must submit to the **Wood Palace**. Let none dare delay.\n\nThe **seal** here is the **first thirty-two characters** of the sacred scripture, inscribed in the **Eastern Splendor’s Primordial Palace**, commanding the suppression of ghosts and demons, rectifying the **Nine Heavens’ Qi**. It subdues the **Eastern River** and the **Minghai Water Spirits**. In the **Great Cataclysm** of flooding calamities, the **Qianglong** and **dragon** bear their bodies. The **Water Palace** opens its way, traversing paths of myriad thousands. The **Supreme Heaven’s Red Scriptures** dispel wind and fire without obstruction.\n\nThe **seal** here is the **first thirty-two characters** of the sacred scripture, inscribed upon the **Nine Heavens’ Northeast Jade Gate and Vermilion Platform**, commanding the suppression of the **Eastern Sea Water Sovereign**, the **Great Cataclysm** of flooding calamities, and the summoning of **Qianglong** and water spirits. To avert water disasters, inscribe this text in **yellow** upon **green paper**, recite a separate incantation, and cast it into the water to dissolve difficulties.\n\nThe **Eastern Nine Qi’s *Lingbao* Jade Chapter True Scriptures** (120 characters total) are all from the **Supreme Lord’s Most High, Great Radiant, Perfect, and Great Divine Incantation**, the **Void and Natural Texts**, also known as the *Shēngshén Bǎozhēn Dòngxuán Zhāng*, the *Eastern Mountain Divine Incantation*, and the *Azure Sovereign’s Eight Thunders’ Scripture*. The **Eastern Nine Qi’s *Lingbao* Azure Sovereign Talisman** transforms and generates the **Red Sovereign’s Qi**, the **Three Heavens’ Nine Truths**, and the **Supreme Venerable of the Great Void**. The **Minor Yang’s Qi** transforms and generates the **Great Yang’s Three Qi**—the **Vermilion Heaven**, governing the **small cataclysm of the 6th degree** and the **great cataclysm of the 7th degree**, its cycles complete. The **Red Sovereign**, bearing this scripture, attains the power to avert calamities. The talisman follows as above; inscribe it with a **cinnabar brush** upon **green silk** measuring nine inches.\n\nThe **Eastern Azure Sovereign’s Primordial Talisman** summons the **Direct Talisman of the Nine Degrees** to safeguard the *Lingbao* Heavenly Scriptures. The **Daoist** who swallows it will have **sacred Qi** subduing the liver, generating the **Nine-Leaved Treasure of Azure Vitality**, and enslaving spirits to achieve communion with the **immortals**. The **Direct Talisman of the Nine Degrees** is the **Most High Supreme True**.\n\nThe **Primordial Heavenly Light Scriptures** emerge from the **Azure Sovereign’s True Scripture Chapter**, to pacify the **Eastern Nine Qi’s Heaven**. The **Azure Sovereign** receives this scripture to subdue the **Eastern Peak**, seals one copy, and hides it in the **Nine Sacred Caverns**. It opens once every **four ten-thousand-year cycles**. Those who cultivate the **Way** and belong to the **Eastern Peak**’s domain should inscribe it in **green** upon **crimson silk** and wear it on their person.\n\nOn the day of their birth, inscribe it in **red** and wear nine copies facing east. The **Direct Talisman of the Nine Degrees** enters the body with the talisman, residing in the liver. For nine years, the **Nine-Leaved Treasure of Azure Vitality** will grow, its radiance enveloping the form in nine layers. Additionally, inscribe it in **green** upon **crimson silk**, place it within the **divine staff**, and follow the **Black Sovereign’s** upper node. Nine **jade maidens** in **green robes** will attend as guardians. Let none fail to refine—there will be reckoning.\n\nThose who cultivate the **Way** should wear and recite the preceding talisman and seals, facing east and striking their teeth nine times. Visualize the **Azure Qi** entering the liver, generating the **Nine-Layered Radiance**, and illuminating the nape. Place the talisman before you and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Most High Azure Vitality, Great Sacred Nine Qi.\nDivine Light spreads far, flowing to the Eastern Azure.\nRadiant Treasures surge forth, bathing my form.\nPalaces and courts are pacified, my spirit essence self-born.\nVoid and Natural, eightfold clarity—\nAscend to the Jade Court.\"*\n\nThis is the separate incantation spoken before the talisman.\n\nThe **Eastern Azure Sovereign’s Three Primordial Talismans** command the **Nine-Degree Heavenly Sovereign**, the **Dragon Talisman** to safeguard the **True**. Though floods rage across myriad rivers, none shall dare to overflow the heavens. The **Lower Primordial** (9th degree of **Minor Yang**, 6th degree of **Great Yang**) brings great calamities. The **Azure Sovereign’s Lower Primordial Talisman** is sent to the **Eastern Peak**, preserving all things, securing the realm and its people, and regulating the **Nine Qi’s Heavenly divisions and degrees** to avert disasters for those who study it. Inscribe it in **green** upon **white silk**.\n\nThe **Central Mountain’s Divine Incantation** transforms one into a **divine minister**. It averts calamities for those whose fate is recorded. In the **Middle Primordial** (9th degree of **Great Yang**, 6th degree of **Great Yang**), crops wither and perish. The **Azure Sovereign’s Middle Primordial Talisman** is sent to the **Eastern Peak**, nurturing all things, regulating the **Heavenly divisions and degrees**, and averting great calamities for those who cultivate it. Inscribe it in **green** upon **white silk**.\n\nThe **Western Peak’s Upper Sovereign** commands preservation of the **True**. When one attains the **Way**, they serve among the **Nine Truths**. In the **Upper Primordial** (the **Great Cataclysm’s** cyclical return), the heavens and earth shift, and all—gold, jade, mountains, seas, people, birds, and beasts—are extinguished in an instant. The heavens and earth become **Mingjin**, devoid of light. The **Azure Sovereign’s Upper Primordial Talisman** is sent to the **Eastern Peak**, preserving all things, regulating the **Nine Heavens’ Qi**, and averting calamities for those who study it.

The Black Emperor issued the Upper Primordial Talisman, descending to the Northern Peak, preserving the seed of humanity, regulating the Nine-Heaven Qi, and guiding the practitioner.\nThe three Primordial Commands secure the Northern Primordial Heaven’s beginning Qi. Wearing them grants access to the Primordial’s core.\nThis scripture emerges once every nine thousand years.\n\nThe Black Emperor of the Northern Peak declares:\n*\"When the great calamity’s exchange arrives, engrave it on golden tablets to wear upon the person, written in black ink on yellow silk.\"*\n\nBy the Jade Sovereign’s decree, the Northern Dipper’s Mystic Void Primordial Five-Qi Soul-Treasury Black Emperor Five-Qi Heavenly Lord is commissioned to govern all Northern Heavens and Earths, the sun, moon, stars, and constellations, sacred mountains and spirit caves, water palaces and spring courts, the Highest Saints, True Immortals, and Holy Assemblies—all mighty and spiritual. Where the talisman and command descend, they are to be obeyed as decreed.\n\nThe humble subject respectfully declares:\n\nThe Five Elders of the Celestial Sovereign govern the Five Heavens, and all life upon the earth falls under their dominion. None surpass their exalted role in nurturing the Mystic Dao’s creation. Therefore, when the Jade Sovereign first ascended in the Great Calamity, He bestowed the *Way* to save humanity, to curb disasters and subdue demons. The *True Scriptures of the Jade Canon* were entrusted to them, to guide those seeking Daoist cultivation, to avert celestial calamities, to still the great floods, and to restrain demonic harm—all for the sake of enriching the blessings of creation, ensuring all beings find their rightful place. The Five Elders, having received this mandate, now uphold their sacred duty.\n\nYet fearing the Emperor’s grace might not yet be fully extended or that living beings might still suffer, after the Jade Sovereign’s radiant manifestation, they further proclaimed and transmitted the *True Scriptures* they had received, passing them down to future generations. Ah! The Emperor’s compassion is so profound! And the Five Elders, in broadening and fulfilling this mission, are they not embodying the benevolent hearts of the Highest Saints?\n\nThe *Five-Part True Scriptures* are fully recorded in Daoist texts, with their seals and methods of invocation detailed in the various scriptures. What is now inscribed in the *Scripture of Original Practice* is but the core text. Since the *Scripture of Original Practice* centers on recitation, the core text must be preserved, though the seals and auxiliary methods may be omitted. As for all talismans, the Five-Qi *True Scriptures of the Five-Qi*, and the Three-Epoch talismans, these are likewise omitted here and recorded at the end of the scripture. Practitioners must apply them accordingly, but above all, the recitation of the true seals and core text must be performed with utmost reverence. For this text is the Jade Sovereign’s decree. When the decree is proclaimed, all spirits hear it and bow in submission. Should one treat it with negligence, reciting it carelessly as mere common scripture, uttering it lightly with lips and tongue as idle chatter, then the punishments shall be severe—just as recorded in the *Chapter on Retribution and Response*. Those who recite the scripture must venerate it with solemn devotion. The humble subject respectfully declares this.\n\nThe Dao proclaims: This is the Great Divine Spell—the Primordial’s wondrous speech, the Jade Sovereign’s true decree, the Upper Clarity’s natural sacred text, the Primordial Five-Heavens’ mystic tablet, the void’s luminous chapter, the Highest Saints’ secret utterance, the Celestial Dawn’s exalted canon. It establishes Heaven and Earth, unfurls myriad truths, calms the spirit and subdues the numinous, nurtures and sustains the myriad peoples, rectifies and governs the cosmic order, and preserves eternal Heaven. It governs celestial mechanisms above, inspects the Five Spirits in the middle, strategizes earthly deities below, commands the Yellow River’s source, directs the forces of yin and yang, and summons gods while dispatching immortals. This is the ultimate true text—its divine efficacy is spontaneous. It clarifies the heavens, stabilizes the earth, and safeguards the Five Sacred Peaks, ensuring all things endure. The Jade Sovereign once bestowed it upon the Five Elders of the Celestial Sovereign. At that time, the Five Emperors knelt, reverently receiving the tablet, and secretly inscribed it in the Hall of the Spirit Capital. The Primordial True Man formerly recorded this text and entrusted it to the Upper Clarity’s True Realm, the Supreme Mystic Jade Capital, the Cold Spirit Hall of the Purple Micro, enduring through countless kalpas, its essence preserved at the Heavenly Root, uncorrupted and unlost, shifting with the cosmic cycles. This Great Divine Spell is undefiled by mixture, its purity only deepened by defilement; it cannot be destroyed by ruin, for ruin only reveals its brilliance. It is the Great One’s text, revered by the Primordial True—from the Radiant #3 True Name, inscribed on imperial tablets, revealed to future generations. This sacred text is hidden and secret, not to be glimpsed or heard by any. Those who attain it shall preserve the eternal *qi* and, through diligent practice, attain divinity.\n\nThe humble subject respectfully declares: The *Five-Part Jade Book True Scriptures* possess divine functions beyond measure. If one obtains the *Scriptures for Guiding and Recording Immortals* and applies them, then the Nine-Heavens’ assembled immortals shall be recorded in the celestial registers, and their *qi* shall be transmitted to guide them. If one obtains the *Scriptures for Governing Stars* and applies them, then the sun, moon, and stars shall shine upon one’s form, the constellations shall ward off misfortune, and life, spirit, *qi*, and fate shall suffer no destruction. If one obtains the *Scriptures for Subduing Demons* and applies them, then the Northern Underworld shall fear its might, ten thousand demons shall be bound, and a hundred evils shall tremble in reverence, daring not to encroach. If one obtains the *Scriptures for Governing Water* and applies them, then the ten thousand dragons shall protect their forms, the Water Palaces shall revere in awe, and on the day of cosmic destruction, one may ride the great serpents and ascend the Nine Heavens. Ah! The divine functions and marvelous efficacy—can they truly be measured?\n\nYet the methods of application hold secret keys, not all of which common folk may attain. Only those who seek the Dao must emulate these methods and practice them diligently. Thus the scripture says: *\"Those who attain it shall preserve the eternal qi and, through diligent practice, attain divinity.\"* The humble subject, having verified the scripture, dares not omit its essentials and thus informs those who come after. May the Highest Saints look upon this with favor. The humble subject, Liang, respectfully declares.\n\n---\n\n**Corrections to Original Text:**\n#1 *\"永\"* (originally *\"念\"*)\n#2 *\"听\"* (originally *\"视\"*)\n#3 *\"光\"* (originally *\"无\"*)\n#4 *\"昭示\"* (omitted in original; restored from the *báiwén* text)\n#5 *\"克\"* (originally *\"刻\"*)\n(*The following entries follow the same correction method.*)\n\n---\n\n**Volume: *Dòngxiān Língbǎo Yùhuáng Gōngdé Pǐn* (The Third Chapter on the Virtue and Merit of the Jade Emperor of the Cavernous Mystery Treasure)**\n\nAt that time, the Jade Void Emperor spoke to the Celestial Worthy: *\"May Your Compassion endure. May You benefit the Four Assemblies, the *Devā* (天尊), the Four Heavenly Kings, all the celestial beings, all the immortals, and all future beings who uphold and proclaim this scripture.\"*\n\nThe Celestial Worthy then said to the Jade Void Emperor: *\"How splendid this question! Is it not excellent?\"*\n*\"You, moved by compassion and pity for all beings, thus inquire of me.\"*\n\nThe Celestial Worthy said: *\"Should any in the Three Realms and the Ten Directions—whether a kingdom’s ruler, great ministers, or common folk—face war’s outbreak, rampant pestilence, drought, flood, locusts, or famine, then the sovereign, the queen, the crown prince, the prime ministers, and the great ministers must awaken their compassion. They shall universally command the officials of their domains and prefectures to purify and sanctify the Daoist adepts (*dàoliú*). Within their temples, they shall establish grand fasting and exorcistic rites (*zhāijiào*), practicing the Dao at all six times of day, to circulate this scripture. Thus, the land shall know peace, the five grains shall flourish, and the people shall prosper in security.\"*\n\nThe humble subject respectfully declares: *\"There is a saying in the world: ‘Sacrificial feathers cannot dispel a siege, and a village feast cannot halt a war.’ This is the natural order of affairs. Bold bandits first take up arms, and robbers and traitors first harbor treacherous intentions. Unless wisdom and strategy surpass them, or valor and strength overcome them, their tyranny shall never be thwarted.*\n\n*Yet now, within the *Yùdì Jīng*, it is said that when war erupts, one must command the officials and commoners to have the Daoist adepts recite the True Scripture to quell it—how absurd! Alas, this is far from correct. When celestial omens manifest above, terrestrial calamities arise below; war and strife stem from the discord of yin and yang, the entanglement of fate and chaos, and only then do disasters spread and chaos erupt. Examining past records confirms this truth.*\n\n*Thus, the scripture’s teaching is this: when a state faces turmoil, one must use this method to appease and invoke the heavens, to dissipate celestial omens and quell terrestrial calamities—not to suppress rebellion with this scripture alone. As for arming soldiers, fortifying walls, and deepening moats, can these ever be abandoned for a single day?*\n\n*In the past, there were foolish rulers, their vision obscured, who claimed that Buddhist and Daoist scriptures and spells could repel enemies. They soon met with disaster, inviting ridicule, and to this day, their shame endures—a pity indeed. Now, those in the world who misunderstand this scripture often cite it as grounds for slander. The humble subject, Liang, dares to correct this through verification of the text.\"*\n\n---\n\n**If one enters the mountains and forests and encounters venomous or ferocious beasts, but merely retains the thought and recites this True Scripture with sincerity, the mountain spirits shall guard and protect, the wild beasts shall retreat, and harm shall never befall them.**\n\n**If one enters rivers or seas to gather treasures and rare gems and encounters fierce winds, and recites this True Scripture according to the method, the winds and waves shall instantly cease, and they shall reach the shore in safety.**\n\n**If one is in battle, with spears and blades already clashing, and in their heart silently recites this True Scripture, then all evil bandits shall retreat and disperse.**\n\n**If one is imprisoned in shackles and stocks, with a pure heart and steady mind, and recites this True Scripture, wrongs shall be righted, and liberation shall be attained.**\n\n**If one is tormented by malevolent spirits or demonic assailants, and recites this True Scripture according to the method, the evil shall flee, and the affliction shall naturally be cured.**\n\n**If one seeks descendants, and with reverence recites this True Scripture according to the method, the Jade Emperor shall command the Celestial Registrar to inspect the *Dānjí* (Register of the Immortal), and among the Nine Ranks, the Four Fruits of Immortality, one whose fate aligns shall descend and be reborn as their child—endowed with eloquence and wisdom, held in honor among mortals.**\n\n**If a woman faces a perilous pregnancy, and recites this True Scripture according to the method, she shall give birth safely, bearing a son or daughter of virtue and fortune, beloved by all.**\n\n**If one seeks advancement in office or noble favor at court, and recites this True Scripture according to the method, their rank shall ascend, their descendants shall prosper, and their lineage shall endure for generations.**\n\n**If one desires wealth and abundance, and with devotion recites this True Scripture, their treasures shall overflow, their sustenance shall be effortless, and blessings shall flow to their descendants, passed down through the ages.**\n\n**If one is afflicted by malevolent stars, suffering in misery, and recites this True Scripture according to the method, those stars shall retreat and bring forth auspicious fortune.**\n\n**If one’s lifespan has ended and they are destined for the underworld, their name recorded in the Register of Evil, then their parents, teachers, spouses, and children must recite this True Scripture for them—or establish a Daoist ritual site with banners and floral offerings. Thus, the deceased’s evil record shall be erased, and their spirit shall be reborn in a Pure Land. All suffering souls shall be protected and guided, attaining this supreme victory and ascending to the heavens.**\n\n**Moreover, wherever this scripture resides, the Ten Heavenly *Zhìzhēn Dàshèng Wújí Fēitiān Shénwáng* (Supreme True Saints of the Boundless Flying Celestial) shall always attend and venerate it. Those who uphold this scripture may rightfully call themselves *Zhèngyī Zhēnrén* (Orthodox True Persons). Such individuals, wherever they go, shall be invisibly guarded by the *Jīnjiāng Lìshì* (Golden-Armored Vajra Warriors) from the Ten Directions—protecting them as their own body. Whether entering or exiting, in all their movements, malevolent forces shall avoid their path, demons shall be exterminated, spirits shall cower, and all calamities shall be powerless to approach.**\n\n「When the life of one who upholds this scripture draws to its end, they shall not witness the dreadful forms of the underworlds, but instead shall see all the celestial palaces filled with jade maidens bearing banners to welcome them, ascending to the heavens.\n\nShould their celestial blessings be exhausted and they descend into the mortal realm, they shall perpetually be reborn as emperors and kings throughout countless lifetimes, ensuring the land remains serene and the people prosper in their livelihoods. Moreover, they shall attain the nature of their former lives, follow the Dao/Way, and through successive cultivation, ultimately reach the shore of transcendence.\n\nSuch are the blessings bestowed upon those who uphold this scripture.\n\nFurthermore, if one who upholds this scripture, when rain falls, awakens a great compassion and, as prescribed, recites this scripture three times in the direction of the sky, all beings touched by the rain or within the direction they face—those who have committed the Five Treasons and Ten Evils, or any grave offenses—shall have their sins utterly eradicated, and all severe illnesses shall be instantly cured.\n\nThese beings, upon death, shall not fall into the underworlds but be reborn in Pure Lands, emerging from lotus flowers. How much more so shall those who uphold this scripture themselves!\n\nAgain, if one who upholds this scripture walks along a path when a great wind arises and blows, the dust that touches their body shall, upon contact, cause all beings in the direction it settles to have their evil deeds entirely extinguished. They shall not be reborn in the Three Evil Paths but ascend to the heavens.\n\nThus, the virtues of upholding this scripture are beyond reckoning.\n\nIf one who upholds this scripture bathes in rivers, lakes, or seas, the water touching their body shall purify all beings within it—fish, turtles, crocodiles, and all aquatic creatures—clearing away their sins. After this single lifetime, upon their death, they shall no longer be reborn in any form, whether as an embryo, egg, or wet-born being.\n\nThe words spoken by one who upholds this scripture, whether good or evil, shall all be heard by celestial and demonic forces, the Ten Directions, and external Dao/Way sects, as pure and sacred teachings.\n\nIf one who upholds this scripture encounters any shrine of the gods, they may recite this scripture for its deity. All spirits and gods who hear it shall escape their ghostly fate, ascend to the path of true immortals, and revere this person as they would an emperor.\n\nShould a person in this world fail to honor their parents, disrespect the Three Jewels, engage in killing, theft, licentiousness, or false speech, and commit countless grave offenses, and upon nearing death, if there are any with a Dao/Way-heart and true faith in all beings, they may, during the dying person’s last breaths, awaken great compassion and invoke the name of the Emperor at their head—whether seven times, fourteen times, twenty-one times, twenty-eight times, up to a hundred or a thousand recitations—thus all the unvirtuous deeds committed in their lifetime shall be utterly eradicated. They shall not fall into any evil realm, and their spirit shall ascend to the Nine Heavens. How much more so shall those who uphold and receive this scripture!\n\nAgain, if one has, from past kalpas until this very life, cycled through human and heavenly realms, drifted across all worlds, accumulating myriad sins and transgressions, and if they merely encounter the shadow of one who upholds this scripture cast upon their body—or are illuminated by the Emperor’s light—or hear their words, or even converse with them—as though receiving the Emperor’s spoken teachings and consolation—then their sins and obstacles shall be permanently removed.\n\nIf one who upholds this scripture crafts a long banner and inscribes the Emperor’s name upon it, raising it on tall poles, whether in temples or households, and the wind blows it, pointing in any direction, all beings in that path shall attain supreme victory, and their evil deeds shall be utterly eradicated.\n\nIf one who upholds this scripture writes the Emperor’s name upon any resonant object—whether bells, chimes, gongs, or drums—all ritual implements and Dao/Way instruments, whether used in a Dao/Way hall, struck in a ceremony, or touched by the wind, their sound, near or far, shall cause all beings who hear it to have their sins and obstacles completely purified.\n\nIf one who upholds this scripture, having penetrated the mysteries of birth and death, retreats into the mountains and forests to cultivate true virtue and learn the Dao/Way, and at times ascends to gaze upon the world, wherever their eyes reach—across mountains, forests, streams, and valleys—all living beings, whether formed or formless, born from eggs, wombs, or moisture, and all mobile or rooted creatures, shall have their sins permanently removed. Their body and mind shall be cleansed, and upon death, they shall be reborn in the heavens. How much more so shall those who uphold and receive this scripture!\n\nKnow that such a person is indeed the embodiment of the Dao/Way’s treasury of virtues.\n\nYour humble servant respectfully states: The words of the Heavenly Sage are true and not false, genuine and not fraudulent.\n\nYet, those who are ignorant in this world and lack true understanding, seeing only superficial interpretations, may even doubt minor passages in other scriptures, assuming no such principles exist in the world. Alas! Why do they not carefully examine and deeply investigate, pondering and savoring the meaning, rather than seeking it in convoluted ways?\n\nIn the *Function and Virtue Chapter*, the Heavenly Sage speaks of the blessings attained by those who uphold the scripture—such as dying and ascending to the heavens, or being reborn as emperors and kings across countless lifetimes. He also describes how, when reciting the scripture during rain, walking paths during windstorms, bathing in water, gazing upon mountains, or casting shadows, they can bestow upon all beings the eradication of their sins and the attainment of great virtues—yet some claim no such principles exist.\n\nThey say that the blessings of emperors and kings are too lofty to be surpassed, and that the virtues of reciting scriptures cannot truly be attained or verified.\n\nMuch less could one perpetually be reborn as an emperor or king across countless lifetimes!\n\nThey further claim that the blessings of reciting scriptures may apply to oneself, but not to beings burdened with grave sins and transgressions, who suffer retribution across four lives. This is the unalterable decree of the heavens, not a single hair’s breadth can be changed. Even if the scripture endures for a hundred kalpas without perishing, the fruit of karma must still be borne by oneself. How could the body of one who recites the scripture, in a single passing, instantly liberate them and grant such blessings?»\n\nThis speaker’s words reveal only half the truth, not the whole.\n\nIndeed, to walk the Dao of Yao is to embody Yao’s own self—\nto emulate Yan’s conduct is to follow in Yan’s footsteps.\nYet now there are those who, with this scripture,\nmorning and evening recite its words,\nhurry and step in accordance with its precepts,\ndelve into the *Benxing Jing* and practice its teachings,\nchew its essence and savor its spirit,\nimitating the Ten Marvelous Practices and upholding them in action,\nobserving all prohibitions with strict devotion and keeping far from them,\nguarding it with firm resolve and holding it with unwavering sincerity,\nevermore enduring without wavering, even when obstructed,\nday by day, month by month,\nuntil their form blends seamlessly with that of the Jade Sovereign,\nascending or descending at His side—\nthen that body is the Sovereign’s body,\nand the Sovereign’s body is that of the practitioner.\n\nOnce their forms merge,\nthe virtues and powers that arise—\nhow could they differ?\n\nWhen the Jade Sovereign emits His radiance,\nHis divine transformations are so vast and grand—\nthen those who recite this scripture,\nwherever they go and whatever they do,\nshall bestow blessings upon all beings,\njust as the Sovereign’s grace and light pervade all.\n\nYet these words,\nspoken by the Celestial Lord,\nrefer to those who recite and uphold this scripture\nwith purity, uniting wholly with the Sovereign—\nnot to those who merely chant it aloud,\nmouthing words without true devotion.\nStill, even if one begins with mere chanting,\nunceasing in recitation until their essence merges with the Sovereign’s,\nthen their claim as a True Person of the One Dao\nhardly does justice to their virtue and conduct.\n\nScholars should ponder these words and act accordingly.\nYour humble servant, Liang, speaks thus.\n\nAt that time, the Celestial Lord addressed the Jade Emperor of the Upper Pure Realm:\n*\"I have spoken briefly,\nyet not exhausted its profundity.\nIf I were to expound fully,\nall who hold heretical views\nwould only grow more doubtful and unbelieving.\nThe virtues of this scripture\nare boundless—even kalpas cannot encompass them.\"*\n\nWhen the Jade Emperor of the Upper Pure Realm heard these words,\nHis heart filled with joy,\nunable to contain His exultation.\nGazing upon the Lord’s benevolent countenance,\nHe bowed in reverence and composed a hymn:\n\nAbove the Nine Heavens,\nlies the Great Luo.\nJade Capital, golden gates,\nclouds piled high and majestic.\nWithin resides the Celestial Sovereign,\nkind and benevolent, compassionate and harmonious.\nHis Dao is peerless,\nsubduing all demons.\nThe Heavenly Treasure is His sacred talisman,\nJade precepts and golden laws.\nCountless immortals and deities,\ntheir banners and flags in abundance.\nThose who hear this scripture\nshall have their sins erased,\nforever freed from the River of Suffering.\nThis is the Jade Sovereign,\nthe True Venerable of the Vaulted Sky,\nthe Perfect Circle of Purity,\npossessing wisdom and eloquence,\nthe Dao most exalted,\nthe Teacher of the Three Realms,\nthe Ancestor of the Mixed Element,\nunmatched in dominion,\nthe Merciful Father of the Four Generations,\nthe Most Holy of the Highest Heavens,\nthe Great Compassionate and Benevolent One.\nTen names complete,\nten thousand virtues embodied,\nlimitless in liberating beings,\nextracting them from the苦 of birth and death.\n\nWhen the Jade Emperor of the Upper Pure Realm spoke this hymn and its ten names,\nall the celestial hosts in unison\nexclaimed in wonderment at what they had never before heard.\n\nYour humble servant, Liang, speaks thus:\n*\"When the heart takes delight,\nthe words overflow beyond measure.\nThus, the Jade Emperor’s praise\nexalts and extols,\nspeaking of virtues with utmost fervor,\nseeking to fully express the Sovereign’s power.\nAh! The Sovereign’s virtue is so vast—\nhow could it ever be fully spoken?\nYour servant dares to say that silence itself is the highest praise,\ntruly reflecting the Sovereign’s glory as the Upper Pure Lord does.\"*\n\nYour humble servant, Liang, speaks thus.\n\nFrom the *Highest Jade Sovereign’s Original Practices Scripture*, Volume #6 *\"The Emperor\"*,\nthe original text reads *\"The King\"*.\nThe seventh passage, *\"compatible with the Emperor’s nature and attain enlightenment\"*,\nthe original text reads *\"constantly attain enlightenment of the nature\"*.\n\nVolume Two, *The Chapter on the Celestial True Ones’ Protection*\nAt that time, the Emperor of the Vaulted Sky, upon hearing the scripture’s teachings,\nrose from His seat and knelt long before the Sovereign,\naddressing the Jade Emperor:\n*\"Your servant, the Emperor of the Vaulted Sky,\nprays that You may hold this scripture\nand proclaim its benefits to all beings and celestial hosts.\nMay You protect those who uphold this scripture.\"*\n\nThen the Jade Sovereign, moved by compassion,\nopened the gate of blessings,\nproclaimed the *Yugai Ke* (Jade Treasury Scripture),\nand transmitted the *Lingbao Fa* (Sacred Treasure Teachings),\ntelling the Emperor of the Vaulted Sky:\n*\"Now listen carefully,\nfor I shall speak of the virtues of upholding this scripture—\nits power to rescue the perilous, extract the suffering,\nbenefit the living and the dead,\nand reveal its divine and mysterious truths.\"*\n\nThe Celestial True Ones bowed in reverence,\nall speaking in unison:\n*\"Your disciples and humble servants\ntoday have the fortune to hear this eternal, unchanging law.\nMay it bring blessings to all three realms and heavens above,\nand below, may it dispel the poisons of the Three Lower Paths.\nWith Your boundless compassion,\npitying our lowly state,\nplease expound this profound meaning.\"*\n\nThe Jade Sovereign replied:\n*\"If any being\nhonors their parents with filial devotion,\nrespects the Three Treasures with reverence,\nlends their utmost loyalty to their ruler,\ncommits neither murder nor theft,\nneither lewdness nor jealousy,\nneither anger nor grudges,\nneither arrogance nor deceit,\nand upholds the precepts while keeping fasts,\ndevoting their hearts to the Great Dao,\nnurturing a mind of reverence,\nand reciting this scripture,\nI shall decree that it be spread throughout the Jambudvīpa (continent of the east),\ntransmitted to all ten directions of the boundless world.\nI command the Eastern Hua Emperor,\nwith His green cavalry, immortal troops, and countless legions,\nto descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.\nI command the Great Boshan Emperor of the Southeast,\nwith His divine hosts, immortal troops, and countless legions,\nto descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.\nI command the Great Zhuling Emperor of the South,\nwith His red cavalry, immortal troops, and countless legions,\nto descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.\nI command the Elder Taihua of the Southwest,\nwith His divine hosts, immortal troops, and countless legions,\nto descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.\nI command the Yellow Old Master of the Western Hua,\nwith His white cavalry, immortal troops, and countless legions,\nto descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.\nI command the Jade Sovereign of the Northwest,\nwith His divine hosts, immortal troops, and countless legions,\nto descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.\nI command the Purple Micro Emperor of the North,\nwith His black cavalry, immortal troops, and countless legions,\nto descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.\"*\n\nI command the **Crashing Void Heavenly Lord** of the Northeast,\nwith His divine hosts, immortal troops, and countless legions,\nto descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.\n\nI command the **Central Heavenly Sovereign Emperor Kunlun the Aged**,\nwith His yellow cavalry of the **Kunlun Celestial Old Master**,\nHis divine hosts, immortal troops, and countless legions,\nto descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.\n\nI command the **Heavenly Lord of the Upper Realm, Laihe**,\nwith the immortal troops of mountains and great caves,\nand countless legions,\nto descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.\n\nI command all **Golden Immortals** of the Lower Realm,\nwith the **Fourfold and Eightfold Assemblies** and their retinues,\nto descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.\n\nI command the **Ten Directions of Flying Heavenly Kings**,\nthe **Flying Heavenly Deities**, the **Three Officials and Four Saints**,\nthe **Nine Bright Stars**, the **Northern Dipper and Southern Dipper**,\nthe **Eastern Dipper and Western Dipper**, the **Central Dipper**,\nthe **Twenty-Eight Constellations**, the **Circumambient Heavenly Hosts**,\nthe **Vajra Warriors**, and the **Divine Kings**,\neach with their retinues,\nto descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.\n\nI command the **Subduing Demon Vajra Warriors**,\nthe **Four Heavenly Gate Kings**, the **Five Sacred Mountains and Four Great Rivers**,\nand all remaining mountains,\nthe **Four Seas and Nine Rivers**, the **Twelve River Sources**,\nthe **forest spirits, water demons, and marsh demons**,\nand all their rulers,\nto descend with their

ditches,\nto protect all who uphold this scripture,\nand to subdue all malevolent demons and heterodox spirits,\nforcing them to shrink in fear, vanish, or flee—\nsoaring high into the heavens, escaping to distant shores,\nor avoiding other realms.\n\nThus, all **mountain, forest, ancestral, and temple guests** who partake in blood sacrifices,\nand all **ghosts and spirits**,\nshall naturally be extinguished.\n\nThe **Five Directions’ Pestilence and Plague Ghost Marshals**,\nall **evil ghosts and spirits**,\nas well as the **Wind Kings and Water Monsters**,\nthe **Sinspawn Dragons and Demon Spirits**,\nand **earthly and wooden demons**,\nshall all be extinguished,\nand thus the **five voids and six depletions**,\nthe **unusual dreams and nightmares**,\nthe **sorcery and curses of wild paths**,\nand all **poisonous hexes and toxins**,\nshall be vanquished.\n\nFor those who wish with sincerity,\nall desires shall be fulfilled,\nand all wishes shall be satisfied.\n\nThose who uphold this scripture—\nwhether they do not follow the prescribed teachings,\ncannot observe fasts,\nor lack pure precepts—\nyet still revere and honor its virtue,\nadmire and cherish this sacred text,\nand also those who, together with them,\nobserve fasts and guard pure precepts—\ntheir **merits and virtues** shall be boundless,\nunobstructed, and free,\nmaking them **saints among mortals**,\nwith ever-renewing wisdom and virtue,\nequal to all **True Persons**.\n\nThus I humbly say:\nThe merits of reciting this scripture\nhave already been spoken of by the Heavenly Lord,\nyet the **August Heavenly Emperor** still deems it incomplete.\nAt this time,\nI again respectfully petition before the Emperor,\nseeking to make it fully thorough.\n\nThis is truly the **Supreme Sage’s** compassionate heart,\ndesiring to guide all beings\nto uphold and recite this scripture,\nand hoping the Emperor will grant abundant blessings.\n\nThe **Jade Emperor’s** compassionate vow is vast and boundless,\nthus at this time,\nHe declares and proclaims clearly,\nfrom beginning to end,\nwith nothing omitted or left unfinished.\nFrom the **East** He begins,\nand to the **Ten Directions of All Spirits** He concludes,\nleaving none unaccounted for.\n\nThis is to ensure that all who embrace the **scripture’s efficacy**,\nwhether near or far,\nshall receive the **spirits’** harmonious aid.\n\nYet the weight of the Emperor’s decree,\nthough all-encompassing,\nfirst emphasizes **loyalty, filial piety**, and such matters,\nfor only those who can be **loyal and filial**,\nreverent and respectful,\nwho do not kill or steal,\nwho do not commit adultery or envy,\nwho do not harbor anger or resentment,\nwho do not act arrogantly or deceive,\nwho observe precepts and keep fasts,\nwho focus their minds on the **Great Dao**,\nand who strictly follow each word of the Emperor’s decree—\nonly then shall the **Ten Directions of All Spirits** truly protect and uphold them,\nas the Emperor commands.\n\nIf they fail to do so,\neven if they recite with lips and cheeks,\nI cannot guarantee that the **Ten Directions of All Spirits** will fully protect them.\n\nAlthough **pure precepts** refer to the prior matters of loyalty and filial piety,\nthe Jade Emperor’s expectations are indeed strict.\n\nYet among the **Three Realms**,\nbeings differ in their **roots and capacities**,\nand if one does not distinguish between the wise and the foolish,\nand holds all to the same standard,\nthen few will truly possess these pure precepts.\n\nThe Emperor’s **virtue and power** are compassionate and boundless,\nHis **ren love** vast and profound,\nthus at the end of His proclamation,\nHe again issues a **Jade Decree**, saying:\n\n*\"Even those who do not follow the prescribed teachings,\ncannot observe fasts,\nor lack pure precepts—\nyet still revere and honor its virtue,\nand whose wisdom and virtue equal that of the True Persons—\nah! This is not the Jade Emperor’s strictness,\nfor He does not abandon the **Way** for all under Heaven,\nnor would such a decree exist otherwise.*\n\n*The dull-witted and lowly among mortals\nshould heed the Emperor’s decree,\nfirst cultivating a heart of reverence and admiration,\nthen ascending higher,\nso as to hope for the aid of the **Ten Directions of All Spirits**.*\n\n*Yet one cannot presume that the Emperor’s decree\nwill overlook those who fail to observe fasts\nor keep pure precepts,\nand who remain idle and negligent.*\n\nThus I speak with utmost care.\n\nAt that time, the **August Heavenly Emperor**, having heard these words,\nimmediately composed a hymn before the Emperor, saying:\n\n「Great is the **Dao** of Ultimate **Way**,\nformless, nameless.\n\nVast and boundless

Death**,\nand the **True Person Who Bestows Ten Thousand Blessings and Guards the Body**,\nall rose from their seats,\nstepped beyond their ranks,\nand together addressed the **Heavenly Venerable**:\n*\"If mortals in the **end times**,\nthough they have **karmic affinities** from past lives,\nencounter this **sutra**,\nyet are **defiled by malevolent spirits**,\nand **doubt and confusion** pervade their **beginning and end**,\nnot believing in this **sutra**’s virtue—\nwhat **karmic retributions** shall they face\n**now and in the past** in all the **hells**?\"*\n\nI now humbly pray to Your Sacred Mercy\nto speak of the sufferings of the **karmic retributions in evil realms**.\n\nAt that time, the **Heavenly Venerable** addressed the four **True Persons**:\n*\"For those fierce, violent, and wicked beings in the world,\nwho day and night stand before **Dao/Way** images\nwithout reverence,\nuttering blasphemous words—\ntheir crime deserves to fall into the **Five Uninterrupted Hells**.\nYet if they encounter one who upholds this **sutra**,\nwho through all means entices and persuades them,\nand thus temporarily extinguish their evil thoughts,\nand take faith in this **sutra**,\nthen their crimes and karmic debts are utterly purified, leaving no trace.\n\nAgain, if there are those with perverse views and stubborn delusions,\nwho see one reciting this **sutra**,\nand harbor malice,\ncasting sidelong glances or even harboring a single evil thought,\nuttering a single evil word,\ndefaming and slandering those who uphold this **sutra**—\ntheir offense is such that,\nafter death,\nthey fall into the **Great Hell**,\nwith no hope of escape.\n\nHow much worse for those in the world\nwho encounter this **sutra**,\nyet fail to show reverence,\ntouching it with impure hands,\nreciting it with unclean mouths,\nplacing it on defiled beds,\nor reading it aloud while speaking vulgarities,\nlaughing and jesting as if it were a common text.\nSuch beings,\nafter death,\nfall into the **Uninterrupted Hell**,\nwith no hope of escape.\nTheir misfortunes extend to nine generations,\nsuffering under the **Nine Judges of the Underworld**,\nafflicting their descendants through endless calamities.\nIn the **Hell Realms**, they endure unimaginable suffering for countless eons,\nencountering countless **Sages** who repeatedly rescue them,\nyet their crimes diminish only slightly.\n\nAgain, when rescued by a **Sage** and reborn as a **Hungry Ghost**,\nthey wander for thousands of millions of eons,\nnever hearing the name of water or food.\nWhen their **Ghostly Retribution** ends,\nthey are reborn as **Animals**,\nand from there,\nif reborn as humans,\nthey become barbarians, heretics,\nor are born as women,\nsuffering poverty, deformity, and a hundred ailments,\nenduring unimaginable torments,\ncast aside by all,\nneither able to live nor die.\nThus, those who slight this **sutra** incur such karmic consequences.\n\nAgain, if there are those who,\nthough initially believing,\nlater grow negligent and arrogant—\nthe **Youths of Virtue and Vice** report them to the **Three Officials**,\ntheir names are added to the **Black Registers**,\ntheir merits subtracted from the **Blue Ledgers**,\nand after death,\nthey are imprisoned in dark dungeons,\ntrapped in the **Three Paths of Retribution**,\nwith no means of liberation.\nOr in this very life,\nthey suffer countless diseases—\n**scabies, epilepsy, leprosy, and ulcers**—\nas their just retribution.\nThey are tormented by sorrow and suffering day and night;\nor they are harmed by violent forces,\nimprisoned in chains,\nwrongfully taking their own lives,\npoisoned by toxins,\ndevoured by tigers, wolves, or venomous snakes,\nslain by enemies,\nor while wandering in mountains and forests,\nthey are slaughtered by bandits,\npushed from cliffs,\nor ravaged by malevolent spirits and demons.\nOr they perish in fires, floods,\nor by the blades of weapons.\nThus, those who slight this **sutra** meet untimely deaths,\nreaping such fruits.\n\nHow can one not grieve?\nHow can one not lament?\nTherefore, I declare to you:\nFollow this teaching faithfully,\nand do not harbor evil thoughts.\nIf no evil thoughts arise,\nall entanglements cease,\nand the **sand-like evil karmas** dissolve with the mind.\nAll calamities and demons vanish naturally.\nThe virtue of this is beyond measure—\na **supreme, matchless, wondrous **Dharma**,\nthe **King of all **sutras**,\nwith great benefit.\nDo not reveal this to the **unworthy**.\n\nIf mortals refrain from evil thoughts,\ncutting off all karmic ties,\nthis is the **Great Beneficial Path**.\n\nIf **celestial beings** in their **Five Decays** and **Four Signs of Decline**,\nfacing the encroachment of **reincarnation**,\ncan abandon delusion,\nuphold this **sutra**,\nand recite it naturally,\ntheir **celestial blessings** grow ever stronger,\ntheir bodies transcend the **Three Realms**,\nand they abide eternally with the **Dao**.\n\nThis **scripture** is unmatched,\nunequaled,\npossessing **great virtue and power**,\na **great divine spell**—\nit can make withered things sprout leaves and fruit,\nremove the heaviest sufferings of beings,\nand grant longevity to those with short lives.\nIts virtues are beyond comprehension,\nbeyond all praise.\n\nIf one has not sown the **seeds of the Dao** in past lives,\nor cultivated vast **meritorious deeds**,\nthey may not even hear its name,\nlet alone encounter this **sutra**.\nAccording to the **Three Caverns’ True Principles**,\nit is transmitted only once every **eighty thousand eons**.\n\nThis **pure and exalted scripture** is treasured\nin the **Celestial Capital’s Golden Gates and Imperial Palace**,\nexceedingly subtle and rare—\nonly those with **inherent Daoist essence**,\ndestined to become **Nine-Heaven True Immortals**,\nmay encounter this text.\nThrough this fateful connection,\nthey shall later offer **gold and jewels**\nto their **盟师 (盟师—*méngshī*, \"pledge-master\" or \"covenant teacher\")**\nand receive it,\nonly then may they ride the **celestial timing** to pass it on.\nDo not reveal it lightly—\nrevere it and guard it carefully.\n\nI humbly declare:\nI have heard in the **scriptures** that\n*\"To truly observe the **Dharma Realm’s nature**,\nall things are shaped by the mind.\"*\n\nThis teaching, if proclaimed aloud,\nis said to shatter the hells’ *gāthā*[1].\nThus it is known:\nwhen the mind arises, the hells arise;\nwhen the mind is extinguished, the hells are extinguished.\nThe arising and ceasing of the mind,\nthe existence and nonexistence of the hells—\nhow much more so when the mind does not merely arise\nbut further gives rise to evil!\n\nTherefore, in the *Chánjīng Bàoyìng Pǐn*[2],\nit is stated that the common mortal’s transgressions\nare boundless and limitless.\nIf one can but briefly extinguish the evil mind,\nthen all crimes and karmic burdens\nshall be utterly exhausted,\nleaving no trace behind.\nYet to harbor even a single evil thought,\nits calamities and sufferings\nare beyond measure—\nwhat need for words to describe them?\n\nThus it is known that within the four-square inches of the heart,\nlies the pivot of gain and harm,\nthe root of ascent and descent—\nhow can one dare to be negligent,\nhow can one dare to fear it not?\n\nFurther below in the *pǐn*[3],\nit is recorded that all heavenly beings and mortals,\nshould they encounter the five decayed or four afflicted states,\nif they abandon delusion and false thought,\nthen their celestial blessings shall be ever more secure.\nFalse thought is but the mind’s arising.\n\nThough mortals and heavenly beings differ vastly,\nyet ascent and descent, gain and harm,\nall hinge upon the single mind.\nAlas, can the mind truly be left unchecked?\nCan the mind truly be left in darkness?\n\nIf all beings cannot yet prevent the mind from arising,\nthen they should at least refrain from giving rise to evil,\nabandon false thought,\nso that all notions cease,\nall entanglements subside—\nperhaps then the dust-like evil deeds\nshall dissolve with the mind,\nand they may become virtuous folk.\nThe worthy scholar’s return lies here:\nthis text is their unshamed refuge.\n\nThe destruction of calamity-demons,\nthe protection of all life,\nthe reach of the Emperor’s grace—\nthese shall follow like shadow to form.\n\nIf one further expands and fulfills this,\nmaking the mind like the boundless void,\npure and flawless within and without,\naccepting all without exclusion,\nembracing all without rejection,\nand directly attaining the **True One’s Unobstructed Dao Gate**,\nthe **High Path of Pure Liberation**—\nthen the station of the **Twelve Heavenly Worthies**,\nthe fruit of the **Jade Sovereign’s Three Bodies**[4],\nshall not be difficult to reach.\n\nAll beings should strive earnestly.\nI, your subject, speak with utmost sincerity.\n\nThen the **True One** (天尊) solemnly expounded this meaning and spoke in verse:\n\nIf the waters of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers\nCould spawn lotuses from their waves,\nIf a loving crow’s feathers turned white,\nSuch wonders would still be rare as scripture’s truth.\n\nIf tortoises bore hair,\nFit for weaving into robes,\nIf moonlight at night could melt ice,\nSuch wonders would still be rare as scripture’s truth.\n\nIf gnats and mosquitoes had feet,\nCapable of building bridges and boats,\nAnd bore all burdens heavy,\nSuch wonders would still be rare as scripture’s truth.\n\nIf a fledgling bird could carry great mountains,\nAnd cast them into distant realms,\nSuch wonders would still be rare as scripture’s truth.\n\nIf a single-leaf boat held strength\nTo bear the Kunlun peaks,\nAnd float across the vast sea,\nSuch wonders would still be rare as scripture’s truth.\n\nIf leeches could sprout colossal fangs,\nAs large as elephant tusks,\nSuch wonders would still be rare as scripture’s truth.\n\nIf the leaves of broom and hemp\nCould shelter the boundless **Jade Sovereign’s** (无鞅) domain,\nAnd shade the **Jade Sovereign’s** countless multitudes,\nSuch wonders would still be rare as scripture’s truth.\n\nIf crows and kites of the same kind\nShared one nest in a single tree,\nAnd fed each other in mutual trust,\nSuch wonders would still be rare as scripture’s truth.\n\nIf rabbits sprouted horns,\nFit for use as ladders and stairs,\nAnd reached the **Highest Heaven** (有顶天),\nSuch wonders would still be rare as scripture’s truth.\n\nIf shrews and rats climbed\nThe rabbit’s horned ladder,\nAnd devoured the moon in the sky,\nSuch wonders would still be rare as scripture’s truth.\n\nIf a donkey’s lips were as red\nAs the **Bodhi fruit** (苹婆果),\nAnd it could sing and dance with grace,\nSuch wonders would still be rare as scripture’s truth.\n\nIf flies and insects drank\nFrom cups of **Jade Stone wine** (钟石酒),\nAnd drowned in intoxication,\nSuch wonders would still be rare as scripture’s truth.\n\nAt that time, having finished expounding these verses,\nThe **True One** universally declared to the **Four Assemblies** (四众):\n\nThose who uphold this scripture\nAre called the **Meritorious Body** (功德身),\nFor all sentient beings\nAre sheltered by its grace.\n\nThose who uphold this scripture\nAre called the **Divine Power Body** (神通身),\nFor all auspicious blessings\nShall gather unto them.\n\nThose who uphold this scripture\nAre called the **Pure Body** (清净身),\nFor all defilements and evil deeds\nShall never touch them.\n\nThose who uphold this scripture\nAre called the **Mighty Virtue Body** (威德身),\nFor celestial demons and heterodox paths\nShall never ensnare them.\n\nThose who uphold this scripture\nAre called the **Peerless Body** (无等身),\nFor the **Supreme Deities** (上帝) shall summon them afar,\nAnd all spirits shall bow in reverence.\n\nThose who uphold this scripture\nAre called the **Unshakable Body** (坚固身),\nFor even in the **Great Calamity** (恶劫) of woe,\nThey shall remain unharmed.\n\nThose who uphold this scripture\nAre called the **Dao Treasury Body** (道藏身),\nFor their words, once spoken,\nShall be obeyed by spirits and gods.\n\nThose who uphold this scripture\nAre called the **Compassionate Body** (慈悲身),\nFor all beings in the **Six Realms** (六道)\nDepend upon its benevolence.\n\nThose who uphold this scripture\nAre called the **Great Dao Body** (大道身),\nFor wherever they go,\nNo fear shall bind them.\n\nThose who uphold this scripture\nAre called the **Skilled Physician Body** (良医身),\nFor their wondrous and efficacious methods\nShall bring comfort and ease to all.\n\nThose who uphold this scripture\nAre called the **Radiant Body** (光明身),\nFor they shall forever be the Emperor’s light,\nIlluminating all who receive them.\n\nThose who uphold this scripture\nAre called the **Omnipotent Body** (自在身),\nFor they shall traverse the **Celestial Palaces** (天宫) and **Mystic Realms** (妙境),\nAnd spirits shall guide them.\n\nThe merits of those who uphold this scripture\nAre beyond measure to recount.\n\nYour humble subject, having received the imperial command to verify the scripture,\nDares to cite these verses,\nThus selecting and compiling its profound truths\nWithin the sacred text.\n\nThough the scripture’s **modifications and verifications** (修证) of **fruit and station** (果位) have not always aligned with the **Three Revelations** (准经文之示三) of the original,\nI have nonetheless transmitted them.\n\nThe *Chapter on Retribution* (报应品) records the **True One’s** words:\nThe **Heavenly Abodes** (天府) attained by those who uphold the scripture\nAre now enumerated as the **True One’s station** (真人之位).\nFor instance, the **Meritorious Body** (功德身)\nIs the station of the **Meritorious True One** (功德真人).\n\nAll beings who earnestly devote themselves to this scripture,\nReciting and upholding it without retreat,\nShall directly attain these **True One’s stations**.\n\nNow, the **Four Heavenly Selectors** (四天选举司) have seen those ascending to these stations.\n\nAll beings should steadfastly resolve their thoughts,\nRecite with their mouths and hold in their hearts,\nLest they violate any precepts,\nAnd thus align with the **Jade Sovereign’s Voice** (如玉音),\nSeeking to ascend and verify this chapter.\nThen the **Nine Clans** (九族) shall receive blessings,\nAnd the **Seven Mystic Classes** (七玄) shall undergo refinement,\nNot only shall this body be free from calamity and gain fortune.\n\nHold fast in reverence without slackening,\nAnd gather at the **Jade Flower Assembly** (瑶华).\nYour lowly subject earnestly prays,\nHoping you will not doubt or be confused.\n\nYour humble servant speaks with utmost reverence:\n\nMoreover, if a Daoist adept or devout practitioner, having established the ritual platform and recited this scripture, dons fresh and pure garments, and in the dead of night, abides alone in a serene and spotless chamber, strikes his teeth nine times, faces east, and sits upright, reciting and chanting this scripture—then at that moment, the **Supreme True One** (太真) presides at the desk, the **Jade Consort** (玉妃) sweeps the banquet, ten thousand spirits array themselves in ranks, all the heavens descend upon the platform, the Three Realms stand guard, the Five Emperors oversee the welcome, and thereafter, with eyes closed and mind still, they focus their thoughts upon this scripture. Unbeknownst to them, they find themselves within the Five Clouds, and soon their body radiates a brilliant light, ascending to the Celestial Palace, where the **Immortal Worthies** descend to greet them. Whatever their heart desires is granted, and they may freely take elixirs and treasures of the Dao. Thus, one must follow the ritual method, close their heart to distractions, and uphold this scripture. Even the **Three-World Golden Immortals** and **Ten-Direction Great Saints** all depend upon this scripture for their practices, thereby attaining the **Supreme Wondrous Dao** in an instant.\n\nThis is the **Celestial Sovereign**—the **Teacher of All Heavens** and the **King of All Saints**. Therefore, even the common mortal who encounters this scripture shall receive the Five Emperors’ patronage, summoning spirits and immortals, commanding celestial officials, regulating yin and yang, earning the reverence of myriad spirits, and subduing ten thousand deities. Malevolent forces flee in terror, and all demons are bound in form. After death, they shall ascend to the **Southern Palace** for refinement, tread the **Flying Steps to Upper Purity**, and wander freely in eternal Dao.\n\nFurthermore, even if a worldly being has merely heard of this scripture and harbors constant longing, they may, within their home, select a pure place, draw the **Celestial Sovereign’s** likeness, and with utmost devotion, morning and evening, offer incense, flowers, lamps, and fruits in reverent worship, invoking the name and paying homage. Such a person shall attain **thirty kinds of supreme wondrous virtues**:\n1. Praise from all immortals,\n2. Ascension to heaven for the deceased,\n3. Liberation from past calamities,\n4. Smooth passage wherever they go,\n5. Freedom from theft and robbery,\n6. All desires fulfilled,\n7. Protection from water and fire disasters,\n8. Concealment from all misfortune,\n9. Auspicious dreams at night,\n10. No sickness afflicting them,\n11. Wisdom and keen intelligence,\n12. Universal joy upon meeting others,\n13. Abundant clothing and food,\n14. Honorable descendants,\n15. Joy from relatives,\n16. Harmony within the clan,\n17. Escape from the three evil retributions,\n18. Transformation from female to male,\n19. Noble and dignified appearance,\n20. Appointment as a great minister of the realm,\n21. Birth as an emperor,\n22. Reverence from ghosts and spirits,\n23. Knowledge of past lives,\n24. Protection by all deities,\n25. Blessings upon the Nine Clans,\n26. Longevity in this world,\n27. Dependence of all sentient beings upon their virtue,\n28. The **Demon King’s** protection and welcome,\n29. Transcendence of the Three Realms,\n30. Ascension in broad daylight.\n\nAt that time, the **Celestial Worthy** further declared to the Four Assemblies: *\"The virtues of this scripture can shatter iron-clad mountains, drain the waters of the Sea of Suffering, break the Great Hell, uproot profound sins, subdue violent demon kings, protect all lands, extinguish all malevolent ghosts, cure all grave illnesses, dissolve all poisons, sever ties with all wicked beings, subdue all venomous beasts, and crush all heretical paths. All the heavens shall bow in submission. Its remaining virtues are too vast to enumerate.\"*\n\nWhen the **Dao Assembly**, **Golden Immortals**, **Bodhisattvas of Truth**, and the **Consorts of the Saints** heard these words, they rejoiced, leapt for joy, bowed in reverence, and composed this hymn:\n\n*\"Great is the Supreme Dao, without equal among the Highest True Ones.\nAbove, it transcends all heavens; below, it rescues the lost souls.\nAbove, it has no teachers or ancestors—only the Dao as its body.\nIn the **Dan Platform** and **Purple Bureaus**, the **Golden Gates** and **Jade Capitals**,\nThis wondrous law is kept in secret, bestowing boundless blessings upon all sentient life.\nIt annihilates my ten thousand sins, extending my years of life.\nTen thousand spirits pay homage, the Demon King welcomes me in protection.\nIts virtues flourish eternally, inscribed in the **Yellow Register**.\nThrough countless eons, it grants me eternal existence.\"*\n\nThus, the assembly finished their hymn, bowed in homage, and withdrew with reverence. Your humble servant speaks: *\"None is more august than the heavens, yet **Mahāraja Heaven** is the heaven of heavens; none is more noble than the emperors, yet the **Jade Emperor of the Supreme** is the emperor of emperors.\"* Therefore, the **Celestial Worthy** declared: *\"This is the Emperor—Teacher of All Heavens, King of All Saints.\"*\n\nSince this Emperor occupies the most exalted and noble position, unmatched and unconquerable, those who harbor reverence shall attain virtues without equal. Those who harbor disdain shall incur retributions without equal. The **thirty kinds of supreme wondrous virtues** are but the **Celestial Worthy’s** summary; the full account of sins and retributions is detailed within the chapter itself—a mere outline spoken by the **Celestial Worthy**.\n\nIf beings seek fortune and encounter this scripture, they should ponder it thrice. Reflect upon its beginning and end, its words and meanings, storing its essence in their minds. Strive to recite and uphold it diligently for three years, accumulating boundless merit.\n\nHaving received the edict to collate this scripture, your humble servant respectfully petitions to establish a dedicated bureau to record the merits accumulated by those who copy, recite, and uphold the *Jade Emperor’s Biographies and Scriptures*, demonstrating divine retribution. The Emperor’s benevolence shall surely grant this request.\n\nThis is the conclusion of the scripture—let all beings take heed.\n\nYour humble servant speaks with utmost reverence.\n**The Complete Scriptures of the Jade Emperor’s Biographies and Deeds, Volume Complete.**\n*(End of the white-text edition.

Even the lower immortals struggle to hear them, and in this turbid age, few can glimpse their brilliance.\n\nIts mystical meanings penetrate the depths of the Stygian Sea,\nIts true principles tower above the lofty Kunlun Mountains.\nEach word reveals the path of liberation,\nEach phrase kindles the breath of purity.\n\nTo praise them is to exhaust one’s breath—\nYet how could one ever fully comprehend their profundity?\nIf one encounters the passage of time too long,\nOr transmits the text with careless errors,\nEven the faintest mist may obscure the sun and moon,\nAnd a minor flaw may mar the splendor of jade and pearls.\n\nWho would have thought that the Sage’s benevolent wisdom,\nThough vast, would still wish to preserve the scripture’s every virtue?\n\nThus, Your servant receives this gracious edict,\nAnd, though unworthy, dares to accept this noble charge.\nWith trembling hands and humble heart,\nI dare not presume to match the thoroughness of a meticulous weaver’s thread,\nNor fully expound the mysteries of the Dao—\nYet I strive to avoid excessive elaboration, lest it weary the reader,\nOr invite doubt when discerning its deeper meaning.\n\nOther revisions remain incomplete.\nYour servant now respectfully presents this corrected transcription,\nPraying for Your mercy and review.\nIf there be even the slightest benefit to the text,\nMay I be granted the honor of Your scripture’s promulgation.\n\nOr, may Your servant humbly request that the relevant bureau be commanded\nTo further examine and expound its essential meanings,\nLest this work be scorned as a *San Chuan* (三传) scattering the *Chunqiu* (春秋),\nOr criticized like one without the Nine Masters’ insight into the *Yijing* (易) Dao.\n\nYour servant, with sincerity like flayed flesh and exposed vitals,\nDares to besmirch the divine ear’s favor,\nAnd implores Your mercy for this presumptuous act,\nThat I may continue in my lowly duty.\nI swear with the fidelity of metal and stone,\nTo repay Your boundless grace with utmost devotion.\n\nYour servant’s emotions are beyond expression—\nGazing heavenward, awaiting the Sage’s judgment,\nShaken with reverence and trembling with fear,\nI bow in submission, awaiting punishment.\n\nRespectfully submitted in a memorial,\nAwaiting Your imperial decree.\n\nYear, Month, Day:\nYour servant, Liang,\nMemorial.\n\n---\n\n**Imperial Response:**\n\n*\"Your detailed petition and the corrected scripture have been received.\nYour virtue is pure and harmonious, your literary brilliance radiant—\nYour careful deliberation and diligent

Venerable Master praised him.\n\nReciting the sutra yields profound resonance—\nits efficacy is attested within the scripture itself.\nFrom the ancient times of the Sui and Tang Dynasties onward,\nhistorical accounts and present-day realities alike\nhave been fully recorded in the hidden treasures [of the scripture].\nHerein, a few additional events are briefly noted,\nappended to the end of this volume,\nto demonstrate the sutra’s unimaginable **virtue/power** [不可思议].\n\n**Chen Wang’s sudden awakening**—\na man of Kuaiji during the Sui era.\nHe passed the imperial examinations and entered the **Golden Gate Assembly** [金门集],\nwas appointed as a **Longcheng prefect** [长城尉] after his robes were first unfurled.\nSince his youth, he recited this sutra,\nand whenever he faced calamity,\nhe often received aid [from it].\nDuring the reign of Kaiyuan,\nwhile traveling east from Kuaiji River to Dongyang,\na great storm arose.\nWith twenty-odd vessels setting sail together,\nthey unfurled their sails against the wind,\nbut soon, the sky darkened,\nand the gales grew ever fiercer.\nAt the **Boundary Stone Gorge** [界石窦], the waves surged and shattered the bows of the twenty-odd ships,\nreducing them to ruin.\nIn dire straits, he fervently invoked this sutra,\nand suddenly in the current appeared a form—\nlike a crimson **dragon** [赤龙],\nstretching forth to steady his vessel,\nthus enabling him to reach the shore.\nAll were saved by the **power** [力] of reciting this sutra.\n\nThe **Yin Mountain Elder** [银山老人]—\na native of Raozhou.\nThe silver-mining households where he dwelled numbered over ten thousand,\nall living in thatched huts.\nDuring the reign of Yanhua,\na celestial fire erupted,\nburning all the huts—\nyet his residence remained untouched.\nThe local governor then inquired of the elder:\n“What skill or method do you possess?”\nThe elder replied:\n“I have long devoted myself to the **Dao/Way** [道],\nand daily recite this sutra without fail.”\n**Mou Rong Wen Yuan**—\na man of the Sui era.\n\nMonth, Day:\nIssued.\n\nWhen the sick man had been dead for seven days,\nand they were about to wrap his body,\nsuddenly one foot shrank,\nand he revived.\n\nHe said, *\"I was pursued by a man into a city,\nwhere a king asked me: 'In life, what virtue/power did you possess?'\nI answered: 'My poor family had no means to cultivate virtue/power,\nonly to recite the *Jade Emperor Sutra* [玉皇经] with a single-minded heart.*\nThe king praised this and said: 'Would you like to hear this sutra?'\nSo he invited me to ascend the hall,\nset up a golden couch,\nand commanded me to recite the sutra.\nSuddenly, a jade maiden [玉女] appeared,\nwearing a crown of crimson phoenix feathers [翠凤冠],\nclad in garments of purple mist [紫霞衣],\nand pointing to the *Jade Emperor Sutra* [玉皇经] I had recited,\nshe knelt before me,\nordered me to recite it clearly and distinctly,\nand when I finished,\nshe vanished without trace.\nAs I left the gate,\nonly the pursuing officials remained,\nleading me up a high mountain.\nThere, the city walls rose steep and grand,\nsmoke and fire reached the heavens,\ndark qi [黑气] coiled upon the earth,\nand the cries of the mournful were unbearable.\nI struck my head and begged to depart,\nand the official then guided me back home.\nI saw my body lying in bed,\nwith the ghostly officials pushing it from behind,\nand I revived again in darkness.*\n\n**Dou De Xuan** [窦德玄]\nDuring the **Ling De** reign [麟德中],\nserving as an envoy,\npassing through Yangzhou,\ncrossing the Huai River by boat,\nI saw a man in a pitiful state,\nleading a small child,\nsitting upon the ground.\nI said: *\"It’s late, and no other boats will come—\nwhy not travel together?\"*\nAt midstream,\nI saw the man’s face was gaunt with hunger,\nso I fed him\nand helped him reach the shore.\nI mounted my horse,\nand after ten li [十里],\nasked: *\"Where do you intend to go?\"*\nHe replied: *\"I am not human—\nI am the ghostly envoy of the Eastern Peak [东岳],\ngoing to Yangzhou to pursue the great envoy Dou De Xuan.\"*\nI was startled and fearful,\ndismounted my horse,\nand bowed in reverence: *\"I am the one you seek.\"*\nTears streaming,\nI begged for a plan,\nand the ghost was deeply ashamed:\n*\"You spared me and fed me in my dire straits—\nhow could I repay you?\nRecite the *Jade Emperor Sutra* [玉皇经] one hundred times,\nand I will come to reward you.\"*\nI said: *\"I lack the original text.\"*\nThe ghostly envoy replied:\n*\"The Daoist priest Yin Si Xuan [尹嗣玄] of Lingzhou’s Spirit Immortal Temple [钵洲灵仙观] has the authentic copy—\ngo and urgently request it to recite.\"*\nWith that, he vanished.\n\nI then returned,\nsent someone to seek the sutra,\nand without pause,\nday and night,\nI recited a hundred copies.\nOne day, as I slept,\nI dreamed the ghostly envoy had come to call me,\nleading me to a city’s palace gates.\nHe said: *\"Wait here—\nI will inform the king.\"*\nThe envoy entered,\nand from outside,\nI heard the king’s fury:\n*\"Why have you leaked my affairs,\nand devised plans for another?\"*\nHe ordered his attendants to drive and execute the envoy.\nThe envoy emerged,\nstripped to show his wounds,\nand said: *\"This is for your sake.\"*\nHe was led inside,\nand the king asked:\n*\"You possess great virtue/power—\nyour fate has not been fully exhausted.\nYour human life is complete,\nand you shall be reborn in the heavenly realm.*\nHe summoned the envoy to escort me back.\nI asked the envoy:\n*\"What rank shall I attain in the future?\"*\nHe answered:\n*\"From now on,\nyou may ascend to the Palace Attendant [殿中监],\nand by sixty-four,\nyou shall reach the Left Chancellor [左相].*\nWith that, he departed,\nand upon waking,\nI found it had come to pass as he said.*\n\n**Si Ma Qiao Qing** [司马乔卿]\nA native of Hebei [河内] during the Tang.\nIn the **Yong Hui** reign [永徽间],\nhe served as the Yangzhou Household Officer [扬州户曹],\nand upon his mother’s death,\nhe built a hut and copied the sutra.\nBeside the hut grew a fungus [芝草],\nwith green stems and crimson caps [朱盖],\ndripping juice each day—\none升 [升],\nand its taste was sweet.\nWhen the copying was complete,\nmy mother spoke from her seat:\n*\"By your filial devotion in reciting this sutra,\nI have been granted rebirth in heaven.\"*\n\n**Li Xiu** [李修]\nDuring the **Xian Qing** reign [显庆中] of the Tang,\nupon his father’s death,\nhe vowed to copy this sutra in three parts\nto repay his labor.\nAs soon as one part was finished,\na five-colored circular light [五色圆光] of qi filled the brush.\nWhen the copying was complete,\nthe brush was unharmed.\nOften, I heard strange fragrances at my seat,\nand flowers would fall.\nLater, the brush tip was lost.\nAfter half a year,\none night I saw golden light upon the ground,\nand when I pointed it out,\nit shone toward the lost brush tip,\nits radiance undiminished.\nThe virtue/power of this sutra,\nfelt through sincere filial piety,\nelevated my father to a higher realm.\n\n**Lü Wen Zhan** [吕文展]\n\n**Tang Kaiyuan** reign [开元三年], he was appointed to **Lan Prefecture** [阆州]. Devoted to the **Dao** [道], he recited this sutra ten thousand times [诵此经万卷]. As he grew old and his teeth fell out [年衰牙落], he earnestly prayed to the sutra, and his teeth regrew as before [向经恳请，牙复生如旧].\n\nDuring a time of severe drought [时亢旱], the prefectural magistrate ordered him to pray for rain [刺史令祈雨]. After reciting the sutra once [诵经一徧], he immediately received abundant rain [随获霈然]. When there was prolonged flooding [又苦霖潦], the deputy magistrate again ordered him to pray for clear skies [别驾复令祈晴], and the weather cleared [立霁].\n\nOne night, while reciting this sutra, he saw the inside of his house illuminated as bright as day [又一夜诵此经，见屋内光明若昼]. Several **kings** [王者] appeared, along with a multitude of **celestial beings** [诸仙众], all kneeling and joining their palms in reverence, bowing and praising its merit [长跪合掌，礼拜称善].\n\n**Wen Zhan** [文展] was greatly startled, descended from his seat, and returned the bow, saying: *\"Wen Zhan has no Dao/Way* [道法], yet to receive such profound respect from the **sages and worthies** [圣贤], his guilt is deserving of ten thousand deaths* [罪当万死].\" The kings replied: *\"We are all **demonic kings of the heavens** [天人魔王], just now ascending to the celestial realms [适向诸天]. We saw this mortal world illuminated by a radiant light, so we followed the luminous transformation and descended in person. We cherish it and depart* [故寻光化身下降，云珍重而去].\"*\n\nFrom the *Jin Gui Ling Wen* [《金匮灵文》].",

      "translated_text": "「Your Excellency’s learning encompasses the hundred schools, and Your Dao/Way ranks among the sages. You have already received the office of guiding sentient beings, and long held the authority to expound sacred texts.\n\nReflecting upon the people of the Southern Continent, they have long revered Your teachings of profound principles. Yet the *Benxing Jijing* [1] contains errors and inconsistencies, and the common folk below all cling to their own confused doubts. Thus, I propose Your selection and careful examination.\n\nIt is fitting that You now shoulder the responsibility of Your previous brilliance and again humbly deliver this request. Do not dismiss this modest plea; may You fulfill Your duty with earnestness. Therefore, I issue this second decree, which You must reverently accept.\n\nThe *Yuhuang Benxingjing* [2] is the essence of the utmost truth, the profound intent of the sages. Within its words, it contains the marvelous Dao/Way of the One True Principle and demonstrates the path to liberation in the midst of its praises. Its language and meaning intertwine, its teachings and affairs merge. Within its speech, it embraces the true and mysterious; within its discourse, it unfolds the subtlest wonders, with nothing concealed.\n\nThose who taste its words find divine harmony with the Great Unity; those who recite it transcend all defilements. Its divine efficacy and wondrous applications are vast and immeasurable; its lofty principles and luminous insights encompass all without exception.\n\nYet because sentient beings are burdened with heavy obstructions and the common multitude lacks true discernment, they merely chase after literal interpretations, failing to grasp the essence of its words. They fear only the scriptures’ authority, unaware that true liberation lies beyond superficial rewards. Sacred texts reveal extraordinary signs, but profound truths reside in the One True Principle.\n\nHow can one abandon the refined for the crude, or cling to the coarse while forsaking the marvelous? Only then will one align with the Heavenly Lord’s original intent and silently accord with the Emperor’s sovereign will.\n\nBy advancing in practice, one may swiftly transcend this defiled world; by ascending in realization, one may join the ranks of the pure and luminous. Thus, one may attain the *Qingwei Tian* [3] and ascend to the Hall of Light, without needing the Heavenly Lord’s wondrous voice to re-emerge, nor seeking His path to wander freely, possessing the Six Spiritual Powers and achieving Great Freedom.\n\nThis is where one first earns the name of *shixin* [4] (true reception) and where one truly earns the title of *shouchi* [5] (sacred recitation). If one spreads these words far and wide without delving into the intent of the One True Principle, or if the Six Roots [6] wander without encountering the path to liberation, then such efforts can never repay the Heavenly Lord’s labor in expounding this scripture, nor gain the Emperor’s merit in protecting it.\n\nLet those who revere and believe in this text redouble their efforts in upholding it, reciting with mouth and storing in heart as if dwelling within the radiant light. Let their spirits merge and minds converse as if wandering through the Jewel Park. Contemplating the divine powers of *Fenshen Heshen* [7] (divided and unified bodies), silently reflecting on the wondrous applications of *Yinghua Yingwu* [8] (responding transformations and manifestations), they will stand serene and unencumbered, with lofty confidence.\n\nThus, they may naturally ascend to the Celestial Palaces and be recorded among the sacred texts. I, Liang, having received Your enlightened decree, will now praise this Jewel Scripture. Respectfully, I first reveal its coarse interpretations in my humble words, to proclaim them to the present age.\n\nAs for the teachings on acquiring merit and the detailed explanations of divine retribution, these are already fully recorded in the scripture and need no further elaboration.\n\nBut regarding the unfolding of ultimate principles and correcting erroneous texts, though I lack the ability to err, I am guided by Your gracious decree. Having already declined with humility, I now dare not refuse this modest request. I will carve away and refine this heart, scrutinize it below, and first speak these words, establishing them in the scripture. Thus, future readers may recognize the original intent of its accounts.\n\nI, Liang, bow my head repeatedly and respectfully write this with clasped hands.\n\n**Volume One: Chapter One – The Divine Powers of the Qingwei Celestial Palace**\nDao/Way’s words [9]: The Primordial Heavenly Lord, in days past, ascended to the Qingwei Celestial Palace, within the *Yujing* [10] and *Jinquè* [11] of the Seven Treasures, in the Mysterious Jewel Park, to the Hall of Radiant Light. There, He expounded the path of *Lingbao Qingjing Zhenyi Bu’er* [12] (Soul Jewel of Purity, True Unity Without Duality) to countless beings beyond measure.\n\nThe *Yingyun Shufa Zhang* [13] has already been carefully examined, with no discrepancies or errors.\n\nI humbly state: The marvels of the Great Dao/Way begin from the beginningless and end in the endless. Its forms cannot be confined by vessels, nor can its manifestations be grasped by perception. The Three Realms [14] are all shaped and conditioned; how then could one attain this Dao/Way?\n\nI reverently ponder that the Primordial Heavenly Lord knew the Dao/Way’s lofty mysteries, pitied the sentient beings’ ignorance, and in response to the cosmic mandate, He expounded the law and revealed it, so that all beings in the Three Realms might seek this path. Thus, even the confused and the sluggish may enter the gate of Purity, True Unity, and return to the domain of Natural Emptiness.\n\nThe assembled truths of this scripture sought to record the Heavenly Lord’s deeds of expounding the law, hence this chapter is placed first.\n\nThough this scripture, from beginning to end, purely recounts the Emperor’s divine transformations and the marvels of His creation, the intent of its compilation is to directly point to the expounding of the *Lingbao Qingjing Zhenyi Bu’er* (Soul Jewel of Purity, True Unity Without Duality) path. Without profound insight and the mind-seal of true understanding, who could ever attain this?",

      "translated_text": "The ten-directional assemblies arrive together, riding the five-hued jade wheels, the lingyun jade palanquins, the six-hued dark dragons, and the ten-perfected feathered canopies. The qilin dances and the phoenix sings, their resonant calls echoing in harmonious melodies, while the spirit consorts scatter flowers and the golden boys waft incense. They chant hymns of praise and sacred verses, ascending through the air.\n\nThis is the *Chapter on the Ten-Directional Assemblies*, which has been carefully verified and compared, with no discrepancies found.\n\nI respectfully state: Though in terms of **manifestation** the ten directions are distinct,\nAnd though in form the myriad sages differ,\nYet since all things share the same essence,\nHow could the wise and holy be distinct?\nHow could the distant and near differ in observation?\nWhat boundaries could separate the four cardinal directions?\n\nWhen the Heavenly Sage expounds the scriptures and the Jade Emperor emits divine light,\nThe assemblies from the ten directions universally gather—\nThis is the natural order of things.\n\nAll living beings ought to recognize this truth.\n\nI, Liang, speak with utmost care.\n\nAt that time, the **Brahma-heavens** and all golden immortals,\nThe great vehicle bodhisattvas and the four assemblies of eight divisions,\nReceived this radiant illumination,\nAnd all ascended upon the **spirit-mist nine numinous** flying cloud-jade carriages,\nCelebrating the four great gatherings of the sky,\nAs the three luminaries exhaled their fragrance,\nAnd the eight winds converged in joyous flight,\nRevolving around the Dao’s presence,\nShowering upon the assemblies countless marvelous flowers,\nDescending like clouds to cover the gathering ground.\n\nThis is the *Chapter on the Golden Immortals’ Universal Arrival*,\nWhich has also been cross-verified, with no discrepancies found.\n\nI respectfully state: The Dao arises from a single teaching,\nYet some may diverge from it—these are **sects**;\nOr some may differ—these are **branches**.\nSeeking the sect from the branches,\nDivergence merges into unity—\nHow could there be any distinction?\n\nNow, in the mortal world, the Dao is taken as a divergent path,\nLike red and black ink—\nYet the Dao and its teachings share the same origin,\nWith no fundamental differences at all.\n\nThus, when the Heavenly Sage expounds the scriptures and the Jade Emperor emits divine light,\nThe golden immortals all gain the opportunity to attend.\n\nThis is because the **sages’ true hearts** are unified,\nAnd the Dao and its teachings share the same origin.\n\nMay the mortal world recognize this truth.\n\nI, Liang, speak with utmost care.\n\nAt that time, the light illuminated all the heavens,\nDescending to the **limitless world** of the lower realm—\nThe **same as the Mysterious Capital** of the Dao-realm.\n\nAll those in the mortal world,\nWho were near the Nine Heavens,\nInterconnected and bound by kinship,\nWere now equally close.\n\nAt that time, in the lower realm’s limitless world,\nMountains, ridges, valleys, ravines, and streams\nWere vast yet flat as the palm of a hand,\nThe six directions equally near,\nThe three realms not distant—\nThe **Celestial Treasures Platform** stood arrayed among mortals,\nWith jade and pearls scattered in splendor,\nBrightly shining upon the clouded thoroughfares,\nSeven-treasured railings and barriers\nMarking the Dao-path,\nJade trees and immortal flowers,\nLuminous pearls and precious gems,\nResplendent in the **elixir field**,\nMoss and grasses covering the ground in softness.\n\nAt that time, in the lower realm,\nAll saw the heavens’ wonders—\nThe **Hooked Heaven’s** exquisite music,\nSpinning in resonance with the light,\nNaturally vibrating in harmony.\nThey also saw the **luan’s** calls and the phoenix’s songs,\nThe soaring winds responding to the rhythms,\nThe dragons playing and the qilin coiling,\nTheir dances ascending to the celestial heights.\n\nThe heavens’ precious flowers,\nScattered and fallen,\nFilled the paths in abundance.\n\nThis is the *Chapter on the Light Illuminating the Lower Realm*.\n\nI privately consider:\nFrom the perspective of the heavens,\nThe mortal world is **this**,\nWhile the heavens are **that**.\n\nNow, in the original text,\nIt states that **this** mortal world\nIs near the Nine Heavens—\nThis implies no distinction between them.\n\nMoreover, the divine light’s illumination\nNaturally unites the upper and lower realms,\nFusing them boundlessly.\n\nYet the original text’s phrasing,\n“**This** mortal world...”\nForces an artificial separation,\nNot the natural state.\n\nThus, I have altered **this** to **that** in the mortal world’s context.\nI have also corrected **lower realm** to **that lower realm**.\n\nAs for the original text’s claim,\n“**This** mortal world also sees the *luan’s* calls and the phoenix’s songs,”\nThe word **this** is also an artificial imposition,\nAnd I have changed it to **all**.\n\nI privately consider:\nThe scriptures are the **heavenly texts**,\nNot of mortal origin.\nSince the **Heavenly Truth** descended to the world,\nIt was orally transmitted to the lower realm’s sages.\nThose sages of the lower realm,\nRecalled and recorded the teachings of the immortals.\n\nFrom the perspective of mortals,\nThe text frequently uses **this**,\nAnd occasionally contains unsettling phrases—\nThis is no cause for surprise.\n\nI now revise it,\nTo ensure the **grand harmony of meaning**.\nFearful that mortals may not understand,\nI explain it in detail here.\nThose who recite and uphold it,\nLet them not harbor other doubts.\n\nI respectfully state:\nWhen a mirror illuminates objects,\nAll forms appear;\nWhen ash covers objects,\nAll impurities grow faint.\n\nHow much more so when the **Supreme Emperor’s** unobstructed,\nEqual, and divine light\nIlluminates all things—\nShould not all beings bow and rise in unison,\nWith no distinction between near and far?\n\n**Abandon** the living and the sentient,\nAnd they will embody the Jade Emperor’s light emission.\nFusing the self with all things,\nEquating good and evil,\nDespising obstacles,\nThe light of this heart,\nWhen emitted,\nWill surely align with the Supreme Emperor’s unobstructed and equal light.\n\nTo seek the **principle** in the **sages’ deeds**,\nIs to reveal no falsehood.\nAll living beings ought to recognize this.",

      "translated_text": "The subject humbly speaks: At that time, the common and the holy were astonished in unison, the hidden and the dark opened to radiance, the celestial and the human rejoiced and celebrated with leaping exultation. All laypersons and scholars attained ascension, gazing upward at the effulgent treasure platforms of the kalpas, and downward upon the violet clouds spreading far and wide.\n\nIn those worlds, all peoples—\nFrom the white-haired and wrinkled to the young and the tender—\nAll transformed and attained enlightenment,\nTheir hair black as indigo, their faces ruddy as vermilion,\nThe weak and the frail restored to vigor,\nTheir forms resplendent and luminous,\nTheir suffering healed, all liberated in joyous ease.\nThe lands sang of harmony and great peace.\n\n*(The \"Chapter on Manifesting the Divine Powers\")*\n\nThe subject secretly observes: After the light shone upon the lower realms,\nThe effects were immediately seen.\nYet in the present text, there are slight discrepancies,\nCausing the meaning to fail in coherence.\n\nI respectfully adjust the phrase \"At that time\" to precede \"the common and the holy were astonished in unison.\"\nAnd I move \"The lands sang of harmony and great peace\" beneath \"liberated in joyous ease.\"\n\nThe remaining phrases—such as \"the divine wind reaching afar\"—\nAre displays of the Dao’s mysterious transformations,\nVisible even in the hidden depths,\nNot merely in the human world.\n\nThus, I place them in the next chapter.\n\nThe subject humbly speaks: Though the hidden and the manifest differ,\nTheir principles remain unchanged.\nWhen the Emperor’s virtue and benevolent decree descend upon the mortal realm,\nThe dead, those burdened with sins, the exiled, the newly restored,\nThose elevated in rank, and those further honored—\nAll grow yet more noble.\nThis is the special grace of the Emperor’s virtue.\n\nHow much more so when the **Supreme Emperor’s** extraordinary divine light descends—\nA grace beyond the common—\nThat scholars ascend as immortals,\nThe aged regain their youth,\nThe young grow strong,\nThe sick are healed—\nThis is the natural order of things.\n\nAll living beings should strive to uphold the **Sacred Truth**,\nDiligently seek the Dao’s teachings,\nAnd await the **Jade Emperor’s** profound benevolence.\n\nThe Dao does not fail those who seek it,\nThe sages have clear instructions—\nLet them heed this with sincerity.\nThe subject humbly speaks.\n\nAt that very moment,\nThe divine wind reached afar,\nThe ten thousand breaths rose in vitality,\nHeaven shook and earth split,\nThe withered bones revived,\nThe drowned corpses flew with their souls,\nAll returned to their original forms;\nThe **Yin Regions** of iron enclosure and eternal night,\nThe **Nine Abysses**—\nWere instantly shattered.\nThe beings of the hells—\nTransformed into celestial realms,\nTheir suffering in the three evil paths\nAll dissolved.\n\nAt that time, the guilty ones,\nBy this light’s power,\nWere born into the ten directions’ great heavenly palaces.\n\n*(The \"Chapter on Reviving the Withered and the Drowned\")*\n\nThe subject secretly thinks:\nThough the Dao’s transformations affect all equally,\nThere is still a natural order of near and far, first and last.\nThus, the effects of the divine light first manifest in the bright human world,\nThen extend to the hidden realms of all beings—\nThis is the natural sequence.\n\nThe old text’s accounts,\nThough recorded, were somewhat disordered.\nI now place the phrase \"At that very moment\" above \"The divine wind reached afar,\"\nAnd follow \"All returned to their original forms\" with \"The **Yin Regions** of iron enclosure and eternal night...\"\nSo that the order of precedence remains unbroken,\nAnd the meaning flows smoothly,\nLest the original sight be lost as witnessed on that day when the scripture was expounded.\n\nI have also removed the phrase \"born into the celestial realms\" from the old text.\n\nThe subject humbly speaks:\nWithered bones should decay,\nDrowned corpses should dissolve,\nAnd evil destinies should confine—\nThis is the ordinary course.\nYet the Emperor’s grace is extraordinary,\nBeyond the reach of ordinary logic.\nLiving beings should not presume to have evil or transgression,\nFor there will come a day of pardon and rebirth into the heavens,\nYet some may harbor a hope of fortune.\nIf such hope arises,\nThey will instead fall into deeper darkness.\n\nThere are matters to be feared,\nThus I speak of them first.\nYet I must also clarify the meaning of \"liberation from confinement, resurrection of the dead.\"\n\nThe descent into evil paths is not their natural state,\nBut arises from the accumulation of heavy sins and karmic deeds.\nThe retribution of the hells is severe,\nAnd some cannot escape—\nYet with the reception of true grace,\nThey should naturally transcend transformation.\nEspecially when encountering the **Jade Emperor’s** radiant light,\nA grace of extraordinary pardon—\nThen sins and evils are entirely released,\nAs boiling water melts ice.\n\nFor the original spirit, a single soul,\nAscending with the sun’s light to the Nine Heavens—\nThis is no difficult matter.\n\nAs for the revival of withered bones and drowned corpses,\nThis must be explained through metaphor.\nFish scales and bones rot in the mud,\nYet with water, they revive again;\nPond lilies wither on the earth,\nYet with water, they sprout anew.\nWater is but one thing,\nAnd even fish scales and pond lilies respond thus—\nHow much more so to the **Supreme Emperor’s** extraordinary grace?\n\nMoreover, corpses are the transformed bodies of humans,\nAnd bones are the remnants of corpses.\nBones are from corpses,\nCorpses are from humans,\nHumans are born from the **yin-yang** breaths of heaven and earth—\nThis can manifest in bones.\nHow much more so for other things?\n\nBones are the refined essence of the **qi**.\nNow, scholars who refine their essence\nTurn it into the golden elixir of the **Dan**,\nPreserving form and dwelling in the world,\nAchieving longevity and divine immortality.\nThose bones, being the refined essence,\nShould naturally differ from common things.\n\nThus, all things decay when buried in the earth,\nYet human bones endure for long ages without transformation.\nThis is because they are the refined essence.\n\nTherefore, the **Supreme Sage’s** compassion and mercy\nPossess the art of **Great Yin** transformation.\nAh! Unable to save them in life,\nYet still reviving them in death—\nHow profound is this compassion and resolve!\n\nNow, with the **Supreme Emperor’s** radiant light,\nGranting escape from confinement and resurrection of the dead,\nEven to the revival of withered bones—\nHow shall the **Supreme Sage’s** virtue of cherishing life be repaid?\n\nIf even the slightest offense remains,\nThe **Yin Regions** and iron enclosures—\nHow can they be avoided?\nAll living beings should know this.\n\nThe subject humbly speaks.",

      "translated_text": "At that time, the Jade Emperor, with his divided form, pervaded this realm, ascending to the White Jade Capital, within the Golden Gate’s Seven-Treasured Mystic Gardens, upon the Great Radiant Hall’s Radiant Seat, and universally expounded the Dao of pure liberation to all directions.\n\nThe *Chapter on the Division and Propagation of the Marvelous Dao* has been meticulously collated, with no errors remaining. The subject humbly speaks:\n\nIn this turbid age, sentient beings fail to awaken to the True Dao. Thus, the seven emotions and six desires run wild, unchecked, and myriad offenses accumulate without resolution—geohellish retribution cannot be evaded. Who would have thought the Celestial Sovereign’s mercy, spreading forgiveness and deliverance, grants them direct ascent to pure realms of boundless joy?\n\nYet how could they know that even those born from accumulated merit, once their merit is exhausted, still cannot escape rebirth? How much more so those who, by grace alone, attain heavenly birth—such birth is merely the extent of the grace received. If they remain ignorant of cultivation, how can they attain liberation?\n\nThe Jade Emperor’s saintly grace is boundless, yet He still desires their ultimate liberation. Thus, He proclaims the Dao of pure liberation, so that all celestial and human beings may attain the supreme fruit.\n\nAh! His benevolent radiance is vast and profound, His compassionate intent far-reaching. How can the celestial and human beings fail to strive and advance, to fulfill the Jade Emperor’s intent of guiding and delivering them?\n\nMortal beings should reflect on the Jade Emperor’s act of pardoning, rescuing, and delivering them from suffering, and diligently do good, lest they abandon themselves. Then, the descent of imperial grace shall not be as limited as this.\n\nAlthough this chapter records the Jade Emperor teaching celestial and human beings the Dao of pure liberation, the subsequent chapters do not explicitly mention His teaching of pure liberation. Why is this?\n\nIt is because the Jade Emperor, surrounded by all the Jade Maidens as attendants, has their true forms naturally emit fragrant essence, subtly containing the meaning of pure liberation. Thus, all beings in the six paths, illuminated by this light, awaken and comprehend, and through wondrous sounds and proclamations, all are expressions of pure liberation.\n\nThis is the Jade Emperor’s unsaid speech.\n\nThe sages who compiled the scripture, silently recognizing this truth, merely recorded: *\"The Jade Emperor universally expounds the Dao of pure liberation to all directions.\"*\n\nAh! Those who perceive the Emperor’s heart and see through the outer events—these sages who compiled the scripture, their profound and mysterious composition is beyond measure, truly inconceivable.\n\nLet those who recite the scripture seek this meaning.\n\nThe subject humbly speaks:\n\nAt that time, the Jade Emperor was attended by countless celestial maidens—Great Saints of the Boundless Heavens, Marvelous Conduct Immortals, and Sacred Consorts—arrayed on either side. These maidens possessed extraordinary and solemn beauty, adorned with celestial treasures and rare jewels. *\"Celestial treasures\"* refers to celestial maidens; *\"rare jewels\"* refers to extraordinary treasures. The old text mistakenly rendered *\"celestial treasures\"* as *\"celestial maidens.\"* Now corrected.\n\nTheir forms were resplendent, their voices clear and piercing, delightful to all who heard. Moreover, their bodies naturally emitted a subtle, marvelous fragrance of spontaneous liberation. This fragrance, pervading all heavens—*the old text read \"able to pervade all heavens.\"* If the character *\"able\"* is added before *\"pervade,\"* it implies forced action. Now corrected to *\"surrounding.\"*\n\nIt filled the most wondrous lands of bliss and all other fortunate places on earth. All beings in the six paths—*the old text read \"able to make all beings in the six paths.\"* The six paths suffer naturally from the fragrance; it was not forced upon them. Now corrected by removing *\"able to.\"*\n\nThose who heard this fragrance were universally enlightened. These six paths include the paths of celestial beings, humans, asuras, hells, hungry ghosts, and animals. *The old text appended \"from this point onward\"* beneath *\"animal path.\"* The maidens’ fragrance was heard by all six paths at that time; it was not limited to afterward. This was a mistake in oral transmission. Now removed.\n\nIf celestial beings in the celestial path heard this fragrance, the signs of decline would be permanently eradicated, and their heavenly merit would increase.\n\nIf humans in the human path—kings, ministers, and commoners—heard this fragrance, they would attain the joy of longevity in human and celestial realms, or their bodies would be liberated through *shell-discardance* or *corpse-resolution.*\n\nIf asuras in the asura path heard this fragrance, they would dwell peacefully in heavenly palaces, free from the suffering of battle.\n\nIf beings in the hellish path heard this fragrance, they would escape hellish torment and attain the bliss of pure lands.\n\nIf hungry ghosts in the hungry ghost path—*the old text read \"all hungry ghost spirits.\"* The subject humbly suggests that while spirits may occasionally fall into the hungry ghost path, once fallen, they are ghosts. The addition of *\"spirit\"* seems to confuse with *\"only spirit.\"* Now removed—heard this fragrance, they would be sated, free from hunger and thirst.\n\nIf animals in the animal path—*the old text read \"all beings.\"* Earlier, the hellish path mentioned *\"all beings,\"* but here, the animal path requires distinction, so *\"beings\"* is changed to *\"animals\"*—heard this fragrance, they would escape animal suffering and attain the joy of wisdom.\n\nThe *Chapter on Liberation Through Fragrance* has been meticulously collated and corrected.\n\nThe subject humbly speaks:\n\nThere are truths that are common knowledge, known even to ordinary people, and truths that are unusual—even the wise may not comprehend them. The subject dares to present his humble views on the *Chapter on Liberation Through Fragrance* to the world:\n\nThe subject observes that when the Jade Emperor first emitted light from the Seven-Treasured Mystic Gardens, all beings in the lower realms, including those in hellish suffering, were already born into heaven by that light. Now, the scripture records that after the Jade Emperor’s divided form manifested, He was attended by great saints and maidens, and it further states that the maidens’ fragrance pervaded this realm, yet all beings in the six paths who heard it attained liberation.",

Such questions are not the fault of the world.\n\nFor matters beyond the scope of common reason, there are doubts that cannot be avoided—what is strange in this?\n\nThe subject humbly elucidates this, to dispel the world’s confusion.\n\nWith reverence, he addresses the Heavenly Venerable:\n\nNow, in this teaching of the scripture, the true intention is to reveal the gate of pure and unadulterated liberation.\n\nThe female form is of essence purely yin. Because it is purely yin, it is ever close to impurity. Because it is close to impurity, the female body rarely possesses the disposition of sweet fragrance.\n\nYet now, all the maidens are able to align with the Jade Emperor in wisdom, insight, and purity—equal in their pristine nature. Thus, though their bodies are purely yin and near impurity, a subtle and wondrous fragrance of natural liberation arises from them.\n\nCompare it to worldly people dwelling in filth and corruption: if they could make their hearts, insights, and actions all abide in a land of purity, then the exquisite fragrance of liberation would likewise emanate from their persons.\n\nThis scripture is devoted entirely to the pure and singular liberation of truth, hence its conclusion focuses solely on the maidens’ fragrance to reveal its profound meaning.\n\nThough it is called fragrance, its essence must be understood through theory—not by clinging to material form.\n\nFor ordinary people, if they have no transgressions or faults, if they know the Dao and awaken to truth, and if every word they speak and every deed they perform is praised and admired by all, then their bodies are like those of the maidens—neither foul nor unclean, bearing a subtle and wondrous fragrance of liberation, heard by the blessed abodes of the heavens.\n\nThe maidens are like the impure body, while the fragrance is like my words and deeds. The fragrance pervading the heavens’ blessed abodes is like my words and deeds being seen throughout the ten thousand li. The six paths hearing the fragrance and attaining liberation is like virtuous words and virtuous deeds being practiced in the world, benefiting all people and things.\n\nThis is the path of cultivation, its flavor savored by all living beings.\n\nIf one were to conjecture thus recklessly, the meaning would be obscured and the intent stifled.\n\nThe subject humbly hopes that the Most Exalted Sage will discern this, and that the world will believe it.\n\nThe subject speaks with utmost sincerity.",

      "translated_text": "At that time, the assembled celestial beings and guilty multitudes, having already been reborn in this supreme celestial palace through the grace of compassionate light, spontaneously awakened and understood the karmic causes of sin and virtue. Together with their retinues, they performed celestial dances and presented themselves before the Emperor of Heaven.\n\nThese beings, each filled with sorrow, spoke aloud:\n*\"For countless kalpas—thousands upon thousands—we wandered without sight of the Three Lights, perpetually enshrouded in darkness within the Three Evil Paths, enduring endless suffering.\"*\n\nBy the Emperor’s compassionate grace, we were illuminated, rescued, and reborn in heaven. All our evil deeds have been utterly extinguished, our bonds severed, and we have attained rebirth.\n\nWe now prostrate before the Emperor and take our places at the Dao’s threshold.\n\nAfter these celestial beings and guilty multitudes had spoken thus, they kowtowed and resumed their positions.\n\n**Right: *The Chapter of Awakening Through Light’s Reception*, which has been carefully collated, contains no errors.**\n\nThe subject humbly states:\nThe multitudes of living beings are burdened with heavy obstructions, their karmic consciousness obscured by accumulated sins, plunging them into hell. Even if they repent then, what use is it?\n\nYet now, by sudden grace, we not only escape suffering but ascend directly to the celestial palace—a fortune encountered once in a hundred million kalpas! This joy, beyond all expectation, knows no bounds.\n\nThough we have left suffering for bliss, it is still better to cultivate virtue in this world and ascend to the realm of joy directly. The living beings of this world should diligently sow good deeds, earnestly seek the True Dao, and not wait until they fall into hell to hope for heavenly mercy and seek liberation. Even if they attain it then, their bodies will have already endured countless sufferings—truly a cause for lamentation. The multitudes should reflect deeply upon this.\n\nThe subject speaks with utmost sincerity.\n\nAt that time, the Jade Emperor emitted a wondrous voice, addressing all the celestial saints of the ten directions:\n*\"Attend closely, you saints! These guilty ones, for eons past, though devoid of wisdom, committed the Ten Evils, their minds defiled by the Six Dusts, their threefold actions entangled. They acted at will, heedless of awakening, their hidden and manifest sins deepening daily. Abandoning the Dao and betraying Truth, they followed falsehood and rejected the right path. Every thought and impulse bound them further, so that after their lives ended, they fell into the Three Paths of woe, unable to escape.*\n\n*Had they not encountered this Dharma feast today, how could they have freed themselves?\"*\n\n**Right: *The Chapter of the Wondrous Voice Opening Salvation*, which has been carefully collated, contains no errors.**\n\nHowever, in the original text, *The Chapter of the Wondrous Voice* appears after the section where celestial beings are transferred and united. The subject observes that after the Jade Emperor’s manifestation in six forms—where the scent of liberation was heard, leading to awakening and the fulfillment of past karmic ties—he then emitted the wondrous voice to reinforce instruction before transferring and uniting the celestial beings with the Primordial Origin. The original sequence, where the Celestial Worthies descend and transmit the scriptures, is disordered.\n\nThe subject has thus rearranged and verified this, hoping to achieve coherence.\n\nThe subject humbly states:\nThe subject has heard in the scriptures: *\"The spirit gives life, the heart takes it.\"* Thus, upon reflecting deeply on the profound meaning, one understands that the heart’s function brings both harm and benefit beyond measure.\n\nAt birth, humans are merely the abode of spirit, with no inherent heart. Only when the Four Great Elements coalesce does the spirit congeal into the heart, and as the heart houses the spirit, it becomes detached from its origin.\n\nOnce the heart is detached, it generates thoughts. A single thought, once rooted, gives rise to a hundred actions, and from a hundred actions, myriad sins and virtues sprout. Thus, when this thought aligns with goodness, merit is accomplished; when it aligns with evil, guilt is sealed. This is none other than the power of the single heart.\n\nNow, observe the fall into the Six Realms: it was not due to external influences but arose from impure thoughts and actions, leading to karmic entanglements that plunged them into the Three Paths for endless ages, unable to transcend.\n\nThe Threefold Actions’ entanglements and the Six Dusts’ defilements stem not from anything outside the heart’s generation or the mind’s arising.\n\nThe Jade Emperor, in his boundless compassion, saves and guides all realms, fearing that though they may escape suffering through grace, their roots may not be steadfast enough for further cultivation. Thus, he emits the wondrous voice to clarify the nature of their former descent, so that all realms may recognize the Great Origin and no longer stray.\n\nThis is all from his merciful intent, vast and unwearied.\n\nThe common folk should heed the Emperor’s wondrous voice, uphold the precepts firmly, and avoid transgression. Only then can they ascend to heaven and attain fruition with ease. But if they grow negligent and disregard the precepts, they will sink into the sea of suffering—like trying to run on a tightrope while rolling a ball, with no return possible.\n\nDo not presume that the Emperor’s grace is always attainable.\n\nThe subject speaks with utmost sincerity.",

      "translated_text": "At that time, the Heavenly Ones transformed into the Emperor of the Dao, who immediately, through divine power, did not alter his own place but transported all the celestial beings and humans to the **Yusheng Palace** of the **Jingming Pure Realm**, the gathering beneath the **Yuan Shi** (Primordial Origin). These multitudes were unaware and did not know.\n\nAt that moment, the Heavenly Sovereign presided over the assembly, seeing the **Yushi** (Jade Emperors) of the Ten Directions—all transformed bodies—come together. Before the assembly, the Heavenly Sovereign appeared like a boundless mirror, reflecting all their forms, each interpenetrating the others.\n\nThen the great assembly bowed in reverence and gazed upward.\n\nAmong the transformed bodies of the Jade Emperor, the **Saintly Central One** was the most majestic, fostering pure faith, strengthening resolve, and filling their hearts with joy, leaving no trace of retreat. His firm and unshakable spirit arose.\n\nNow, the celestial beings and humans, who had recently ascended to heaven, suddenly beheld the Heavenly Sovereign’s sublime gathering and the Dao-field, pristine and unparalleled, adorned with the **virtue of non-action**. They leapt in delight, all offering homage at once, exclaiming that they had never before witnessed such splendor.\n\nThe above *\"Chapter of Transplanting and Connecting Celestial Beings and Humans\"* has been cross-referenced and verified; there are no discrepancies.\n\nThe subject respectfully declares:\nThe **nature of the Law (dharma)** is equal and boundless, neither increased by addition nor diminished by subtraction. It is not distant when approached nor remote when viewed from afar. The terms **Saint**, **True**, **Heaven**, and **Human** were never originally distinct.\n\nYet how is it that living beings, embodied and concrete, stray from their origin and source? Even a hair’s breadth of deviation leads to error a thousand miles wide.\n\nThus, high and low are suddenly divided, and the common and the Saintly are utterly distinct. Though they may perceive each other, they remain separated by a vast chasm.\n\nNow the Jade Emperor, out of profound grace, **transplants** and **connects** those of suffering realms, elevating them all. Though the wondrous voice was emitted to clarify the roots of their offenses—both detailed and thorough—he still feared that the beings of all realms had not yet comprehended the subtleties of the **Law-nature**. Therefore, he manifested a different realm to demonstrate the **unobstructed reality of the Law-nature**.\n\nHence, without altering his own place, he transplanted and connected the celestial beings to the Yuan Shi gathering. From the perspective of the celestial beings, the Yuan Shi gathering lay far within the **ultimate exalted domain**. From the Yuan Shi gathering’s standpoint, the celestial realms appeared distant in the **most humble abode**.\n\nNow, the Jade Emperor, unmoved in his own place, brings the celestial beings and the Yuan Shi realm within reach—like the finger and palm—clearly visible before their eyes.\n\nIs this not the **mysterious operation of the Law-nature**, where heaven and humans share a single principle, and high and low are in perfect accord?\n\nAspiring scholars should study the *\"Chapter of Transplanting and Connecting\"* with deep reflection, savoring its profound mysteries. Then, within their own nature, the harmony of heaven and earth, and within their own hearts, the unity of the Saintly and the common, will merge and blend, boundless in their breadth.\n\nThis is not merely a comparison for those who seek to cultivate and verify the Dao below the immortals.\n\nThe Dao does not fail humanity; one should only redouble their diligence.\n\nThe subject, **Liang**, speaks with utmost sincerity.",

      "translated_text": "At that time, the Ten Directions’ **transcendent sovereigns of all transformations** (化玉皇) and the **Celestial Lord** (天尊) all merged into one body. Rising from the **Law Assembly** (法席), they knelt facing north.\n\nThe **Celestial Lord** spoke: *\"In the past, after departing from this world, there was a realm called Radiant and Pure Auspicious Joy (光严妙乐). Its king was named Pure Virtue (净德). The king had a queen named Precious Moonlight (宝月光). Yet the king had no heir. One day, I pondered thus: ‘Now that I am aging, and there is no crown prince, when my body perishes, who will inherit the ancestral temples and the state?’\n\nHaving formed this thought, I immediately issued decrees to all **Daoist assemblies** (道众) across the palaces, ordering them to follow the established **rites and teachings** (科教), to hoist the **auspicious banners and canopies** (旛盖), to maintain purity and solemnity, to array offerings in abundance, and to perform **six-period Daoist rites** (六时行道), praying earnestly to the **True and Holy Saints** (真圣). After half a year, without wavering in my initial resolve, suddenly in the night, Queen Precious Moonlight dreamed of the **Supreme Dao Lord** (太上道君) and the **Assemblies of the Most Perfect** (诸至真), whose forms were golden and jade-like, a pair of pure and radiant beings. They rode a **five-colored dragon chariot** (五色龙舆), surrounded by **glowing banners and luminous flags** (耀景旌), sheltered beneath **resplendent cloud canopies** (明霞盖). At that moment, the **Supreme Dao Lord** sat serenely in the chariot, cradling an infant whose body emitted a hundred billion rays of light from every pore, illuminating all the palaces in a myriad of **treasure hues** (百宝色). The **standards and banners** (幢节) led the way, floating through the air.\n\nThe queen’s heart filled with joy, and she reverently received the infant, kneeling in homage before the **Supreme Dao Lord** and saying: ‘The king has no heir. I humbly beg You to grant this child as the sovereign of our realm. May You, in Your boundless compassion, pity and permit my wish.’\n\nThe **Supreme Dao Lord** replied to the queen: ‘I shall specially bestow him upon you.’\n\nThe queen then bowed in gratitude to the **Supreme Dao Lord** and took the child. Upon awakening from the dream, she conceived. After a year of gestation, in the **Year of the Dragon-Horse (丙午)**, on the **ninth day of the first month at noon**, she gave birth to the prince in the royal palace.\n\nAt the time of his birth, his body blazed with **treasure-like light** (宝光焰), filling the entire kingdom. His appearance was wondrous and exquisite; all who beheld him were captivated.\n\nAs a youth, he was **quick-witted and insightful**; as he grew, he became **compassionate and benevolent**. Within his realm, he took all stored treasures and every kind of wealth and distributed them to the **impoverished and suffering**, the **widowed, orphaned, and solitary**, those **without refuge**, and all **starving, diseased, and crippled beings**. His **mercy and harmony** (仁爱和逊) were boundless, and the songs of the people praised him. His influence extended to distant lands; all under heaven revered and followed him. The prince was called **Return-to-Ren** (归仁太子), and his father rejoiced.\n\nAfter this, the king suddenly passed away, and the prince ascended the throne. Bowing to the fleeting nature of life, he proclaimed to his ministers: ‘The succession must follow the **Dao**.’\n\nThus, he abandoned his kingdom and retreated to **Universal Clarity Auspicious Joy Mountain** (普明香严山) to cultivate the **Dao**. His practice reached fruition, and he transcended.\n\nFollowing this, he passed through **eight hundred kalpas** (劫), always relinquishing his kingdom for the sake of all beings, **severing his attachments** to pursue **Daoist cultivation** (学道). Afterward, for another **eight hundred kalpas**, he practiced **medicinal arts** (行药), healing the sick and rescuing beings, making them **secure and content**.\n\nWhen that kalpa ended, he again traversed **eight hundred kalpas**, employing **skillful means** (方便), opening the **Daoist treasure repositories** (道藏), expounding **sacred scriptures** (灵章), and **proclaiming the true transformation** (正化). He **extolled the divine powers** (神功), aiding realms and saving people—from the **hidden to the manifest**.\n\nAfter this, for another **eight hundred kalpas**, he **endured suffering and humiliation** (忍辱), **sacrificing his own flesh and blood** (舍己血肉) for the sake of his practice.\n\nThus, he cultivated for **three thousand two hundred kalpas** before attaining the **Golden Immortal** (金仙) stage, named **Pure and Natural Awakening Sovereign Thus-Come** (清净自然觉王如来). He taught all **bodhisattvas** (菩萨) the **sudden insight into the Great Vehicle’s true essence** (顿悟大乘正宗) and guided them into the **progressive path of the Mysterious Dao of Emptiness** (渐入虚无妙道).\n\nHaving cultivated further for **a hundred million kalpas**, he finally attained the **Celestial Sovereign** (玉帝) stage.\n\nHaving spoken thus, the **Law Assembly’s pure congregation** (法筵清众) in unison exclaimed: *\"Such a marvel has never been heard before!\"*\n\nThis is the **\"Chapter of the Transformation and Birth\"** (化生本行章), which has now been cross-verified and contains no errors.\n\nI, your subject **Liang**, humbly state: *\"The **Supreme Cause and Effect** (无上大因缘) and **Supreme Virtue** (大功德), since the beginningless past, have never been as vast as the Celestial Sovereign’s transformation and birth.*\n\nThe **Celestial Lord** (天尊) established this **subtle Daoist site** (微妙道场) to **display the Three Realms** (三界), desiring to **proclaim the great cause and virtue**. Therefore, He first caused the **Celestial Sovereign** (玉帝) to manifest light, **revealing the grand transformation** (大神化), before **expounding the secrets** (秘密) and **detailed the origins of the Transformation and Birth** (化生本行).\n\nThus, after the **Celestial Sovereign** demonstrated the **transplanting and connecting of heaven and humans** (移接天人), He **divided and merged** (自分而合), **returned to the origin and restored the root** (返本还元), **manifesting the Supreme Dao Body** (无上道身). When paying homage to the **Primordial Sovereign** (元始), during the audience, He never once spoke a word to the **Celestial Lord** (天尊).\n\nThe **Celestial Lord** and the **Celestial Sovereign** (玉帝) share a **single luminous mind** (心光), **neither one nor two**. Hence, the **Celestial Sovereign** faced north and knelt in homage, and the **Golden Mouth’s wondrous speech** (金口妙言) directly proclaimed the **Transformation and Birth**.\n\nObserving this today, when the **Celestial Sovereign’s body** (帝身) **divides to manifest all the heavens** (分现诸天), it is the **True One’s universal transformation** (真一应化). When these **divided manifestations** (分现诸身) **merge into unity** (合为一体), it is the **True One’s immovable essence** (真一不动).\n\nThe **Celestial Lord’s** establishment of this **subtle Daoist site** is to **proclaim the great cause and virtue**. The **Golden Mouth’s proclamation** of the **Transformation and Birth** is to **let all beings of the Three Realms know the vastness of the Celestial Sovereign’s cause and virtue**, so they may emulate and cultivate accordingly.\n\nThe **True One’s Non-dual Path** (真一不二法门) is this; the **Pure and Liberated Dao** (清净解脱之道) is also this.\n\nAll beings should **contemplate the Celestial Sovereign’s Transformation and Birth**, and **strive to build the Supreme Mysterious Merit** (无上之玄功), so that their **virtue may be towering and vast** (功德巍巍).\n\nAgain, observe how the **Celestial Sovereign** **divides from unity** (自一而分) and **merges back into unity** (自分而一). Thus, one may **enter the True Non-dual Path** (造真一不二之门) and **attain the Supreme Dao** (成无上道).\n\nIf one **endures no hardship**, from **a single moment** (自一时) to **the four seasons** (以至於四时), from **a single year** (自一年以至於百年) to **a hundred years**, from **a single lifetime** (自一生) to **many lifetimes**, from **a single kalpa** (自一劫) to **a hundred million kalpas**, with **unyielding diligence**, then even the **coarse and impure body** (凡身浊质) may **shed defilement and become true** (离垢成真). The **Great Maitreya Heaven** (大弥罗天) will **prepare the way for your ascent** (铺张分位), allowing you to **attain realization** (登证).\n\nWith the **Three Realms’ attendants** (列侍三境) serving and approaching the **Celestial Sovereign**, what further difficulty could there be?\n\nAll beings and those who cultivate should **ponder this deeply**. I, your subject **Liang**, humbly state.\n\nAt that time, a **jewel maiden** (玉女) from the assembly named **Moonlight** (夜光) arose from her seat, **adjusting her attire** (严整衣冠) and **composing her steps** (从容雅步). Kneeling before the **Celestial Lord**, she said: *\"I, your subject, have been fortunate in the past to serve You in person, offering reverent and sincere homage. This has spanned a hundred million kalpas.\"*",

Then, within their own nature, the harmony of heaven and earth, and within their own hearts, the unity of the Saintly and the common, will merge and blend, boundless in their breadth.\n\nThis is not merely a comparison for those who seek to cultivate and verify the Dao below the immortals.\n\nThe Dao does not fail humanity; one should only redouble their diligence.\n\nThe subject, **Liang**, speaks with utmost sincerity.",

Within the sacred domain, they dine on the sounds of **dharma**, yet never before have they witnessed such a rare and wondrous sight.\n\nI do not know how, within the luminous **Dao**, the **Ten Directions’ celestial beings** manifest their sacred forms, all bearing the **Celestial Sovereign’s transformed **dharma-body**□. The **Heavenly Pure Ones**, **Mystic Conduct Immortals**, and **Spiritual Consorts** attend as guardians. These **jewel maidens**, their features noble and refined, their forms exquisitely wondrous, surpass all comparison.\n\nFurther, by the **Celestial Sovereign’s divine power**, they are now all gathered in the **Pure Vacuity Heaven**. I do not know by what cause and condition this **jewel maiden** has attained such a supreme **color-body**?\n\nReflecting on the **Celestial Lord’s** boundless compassion, He enlightens me to my unenlightened state. Then the **Celestial Lord** spoke to the **Moonlight Jewel Maiden**, saying:\n\n*\"You have only recently entered the sacred **Dao-flow**. Though wise, you do not yet comprehend fully. These **jewel maidens**—from countless kalpas past, they cultivated **mystic conduct**, mastered the **gates of liberation**, shared **pure faith**, **pure understanding**, **pure mindfulness**, **pure conduct**, **pure body**, **pure heart**, **pure intention**, **pure fruit**, and **pure retribution**. They possessed **great compassion** and **great pity**, sheltering all beings as a mother cherishes her child, loving them as her own. They upheld the precepts with singular devotion, their minds immersed in the **Great Dao**, observing strict **vegetarian abstinence** and taking grand vows. For countless kalpas, they reverently served the **Jade Emperor**.\n\nThese **jewel maidens** are not truly women—they are **Heaven’s utmost purity**, manifesting as **jewel maidens** to rescue sentient beings. Thus, their **bodies, colors, divine powers, and wisdom**—whether hidden or revealed—are in harmony with the **Celestial Sovereign’s**.\n\nWhen **Moonlight** heard this, her heart opened in enlightenment. She bowed in joy and returned to her seat in silence.\n\n**Right, the *Chapter of the Jewel Maiden’s Mystic Conduct***, having been cross-verified, contains no errors. Your subject humbly states:\n\nIt is said, *\"Man does not know his body is sacred; a horse does not know his body is a dragon.\"* Truly, these words are profound.\n\nThe **jewel maiden’s** body is of **pure yin** essence. **Pure yin** is close to impurity, and thus it is fitting that her path to **purity** is arduous. Yet now, through cultivating **mystic conduct**, she has mastered the **gates of liberation**. By *\"mastered\"* is meant **liberation from all bonds**.\n\nBut tracing the root of her attainment—it began with cultivating **mystic conduct**, and **mystic conduct** itself stems from **great compassion and great pity**, along with her **faith, understanding, mindfulness, conduct, body, heart, and intention**—all purified. Thus, her **fruit and retribution** are without exception pure, leading to **complete liberation**.\n\nAh! A **jewel maiden** of **yin’s impure** nature, yet able to cultivate **compassion and purity**, to practice **mystic conduct**, and attain **liberation**, serving the **Jade Emperor**—and further, her **body, colors, divine powers, and wisdom** hidden or revealed, all in harmony with the **Celestial Sovereign’s**—even to the point where beings of the **Six Realms**, upon smelling her **body-scent**, also attain liberation! How vast and boundless are the **merits and retributions** of **mystic conduct**!\n\nAll beings in this world, endowed with **original qi** from the **Primordial Beginning**, were never inherently different from these **jewel maidens**. If one cultivates **mystic conduct** to match theirs, how could their future **realization** differ?\n\nAll living beings should strive earnestly, emulating this path. As for the earlier chapter where the **Jade Emperor** expounded the **Dao of pure liberation** to the **Ten Directions**, this is precisely it. The **Jade Emperor’s** unsaid words should also be pondered.\n\nYour subject **Liang** humbly states:\n\nAt that time, the **High Void, Pure Clarity Heavenly Sovereign**, with celestial attendants, rode the **Eight Auspicious Celestial Chariot**, sheltered beneath the **Nine-Light Jewel Umbrella**, playing **mysterious songs** and **wondrous music**, reciting **infinite sacred verses**, scattering **heavenly treasure flowers** and **Heaven’s True Fragrance**. They flew through the air, arriving before the **Dao**.\n\nBy the **Celestial Sovereign’s** mighty **威神** (awe-inspiring spirit-power), these **treasure flowers** transformed in midair into a **jewel umbrella**, sheltering all beneath its vast canopy without omission.\n\nSeeing this rare spectacle, the **High Void, Pure Clarity Heavenly Sovereign** bowed deeply and knelt, reporting to the **Celestial Sovereign**:\n\n*\"Your humble subject was negligent in attending the **dharma-assembly** at our last meeting. Today’s auspicious celebration has raised this **dharma-bridge**, benefiting both **mortal and immortal**, **common and sacred**, all bathing in the **Celestial Grace**. The radiant light shines forth, manifesting a **rare form**, illuminating the **Ten Directions**, the **Four Heavenly Kings**, the **Six Desires**, and all **lands of bliss**. The **true and sacred assemblies** witnessing this light all gather in response. Below, it illuminates the **Ten Directions’ boundless worlds**, aligning with the **Mysterious Capital**, approaching the **Nine Heavens**, where **spirit winds** play music, harmonizing **pitch and tone**, resounding through the **cloud courts**, all forming **sacred verses**.\n\nAll beings attain **Dao-transformation**. Even the **Yin Valley Iron Enclosure**, the **Eternal Night Nine Abysses**, and all tormented beings in the **Six Realms of Hell**—all receive the light’s power and are reborn in the heavens, experiencing joy.\n\nYour subject’s scattered **heavenly treasure flowers** swiftly coalesce into this umbrella, covering all beneath its **awe-inspiring spirit-power**. Your subjects’ **thousand-kalpa merits** have now ripened, the **Nine Heavens’ destiny fulfilled**, the **Royal Dao** vast and unobstructed, the **True Teaching** flourishing. Today’s great auspiciousness is universally acknowledged for its **mysterious virtues**.\n\nAt that time, the **High Void, Pure Clarity Heavenly Sovereign** praised the **Celestial Sovereign** with this **gāthā**:\n\n*\"Golden **jiao-gate**, the **Primordial Ancestor** of the **Heavenly Vault**,\nThe **Exalted Jade Emperor**, most honored.\nHis **mystic form** surpasses all heavens,\nHis **compassionate light** illuminates the **Three Realms**.\nThe **True and Sacred** **Dao-Master** of **mystic vision**,\nHeaven and man alike rely on him as their guide.\nWith **Great Vehicle teachings**, he points out the lost,\nThe **One True Principle** revealed to all.\nHis **merits and virtues** are boundless as the void,\nPraise for him is endless and inexhaustible.\nThis **Heavenly Sovereign** of the **Vault’s expanse**—\nHis **mystic vision** and **mystic knowledge** are unmatched,\nWithout equal or peer, serene and pure,\nFathomless in presence, yet ever-present,\nThe **Supreme Sage**, the **Supreme Spirit**,\nPossessing **great divine power**, the **Light-Treasury**,\nA **Great Man** who opens the **Dao** for **heaven and earth**,\nHis teachings endless, his **great compassion** and **great pity** flowing,\nHe turns the **dharma-wheel**, rescuing all beings—\nThus is he named the **Jade Emperor.\"*",

if all beings in the **sandhi-world**,\nWith countless tongues, extol and beautify him,\nThey could never exhaust his praise—\nHow much more so with one mortal tongue!\n\nNow, the **High Void’s**

still cling to **impure actions** of **body, speech, and mind**,\nTo **afflictions** and **worldly deeds**,\nWhich obstruct your vision,\nPreventing you from seeing the Emperor’s **compassionate face**.\n\nNow, for you who gather here,\nI proclaim the **Law of Clearing Obstacles**—\nYou must all diligently follow it.\nAt that moment, the **Four Assemblies** rejoiced beyond measure,\nEach prostrated before the **Supreme Sovereign’s** seat,\nBowed in homage,\nAnd eagerly wished to hear more.\n\nThe **Heavenly Sovereign** spoke:\n*\"The **Law of Clearing Obstacles** requires\nThe generation of **Great Compassion**,\nNo **doubt or confusion**,\nNo **greed or anger**,\nNo **lustful desire**,\nNo **jealousy or envy**,\nNo **harm or malice**,\nNo **worldly attachments**,\nNo

abandoned** by you—\nYour **body** will then attain **purity**,\nAnd you will transcend all **difficulties**.\nThis is called the **Dao-Treasure**,\nThe **supporting pillar of the

sustenance**,\nNever again falling into **worldly cycles**.\n\nAt that time, the **Four Assemblies** heard these words and rejoiced,\nExclaiming praise never before encountered.\nHere ends the

**method of cultivation**.\nWhen mortals uphold a **sutra**, there are two **gates of practice**:\nOne is **recitation with the mouth**,\nOne is **holding in the mind**.\n\n**Recitation with the mouth** refers to **verbal praise**;\n**Holding in the mind** refers to **faithful practice through intention**.\n**Recitation with the mouth** should take **holding in the mind** as its foundation,\nAnd **holding in the mind** should take **recitation with the mouth** as its priority—\nThe two **mutually support** each other,\nAnd **merits and virtues** are thus fulfilled.\nTo **neglect one in favor of the other** is to fail in **merits and virtues**.\nThus, the **sutra** combines both **recitation and holding**.\n\nTo **recite without holding** is to **utter empty words**,\nWhile the **mind** remains unbenefited;\nTo **hold without reciting** is for the **mind** to stir,\nYet the **intent** remains unexpressed.\nBoth must be **pursued together** for the task to be completed.\nThis is the **doctrine of recitation and holding**.\n\nAs for **reciting and holding** the **Jade Emperor’s sutra**,\nYou must **follow and emulate** the Emperor’s **merits and virtues**,\nAnd **mirror his cultivation and realization**—\nOnly then is it possible.\n\nTo **follow and emulate** involves five **gates of practice**:\n1. **Reverence and admiration**,\n2.

Out of benevolent thought for the common folk, I universally radiate divine light, illuminating the **dharma-realm**, bestowing the **Dao’s shade** upon the six **ordinary beings** and four **sages**. I consider that the ordinary folk have but a fleeting lifespan, the kalpa is nearing its end, the true path must be followed to save the countless people, so that those who cultivate the **True Way** may have hope of rising lightly, and the common folk of this latter age may all attain longevity and prosperity.*\n\nSince antiquity, the ***Primordial Origin Cavern Mystery Divine Treasure Scarlet Scripture Jade Edition True Text*** emerged before the **Primordial Origin**, within the **void**, when heaven and earth had no roots, the sun and moon no light—dim and murky, without ancestor or lineage, without **qi** or form, without color or name, without shape or trace, without sound or voice—utterly chaotic, its **divine script** obscure, sometimes existing, sometimes vanishing. The **Two Principles** awaited it to divide, the **Great Sun** awaited it to illuminate; the **divine diagram** transformed the cosmic order, the **mysterious symbols** shifted with fate. Seizing the **Dao’s opportunity** and responding to the cosmic flow, it thus came into being. The **Jade Emperor** bestowed upon me the **Divine Treasure Secret Seal** and the **Unthinkable Divine Spell**, so that heaven and earth obtained it and were divided, the **Three Lights** obtained it and radiated brilliance. The **divine script** flourished luxuriantly, its mystery reflected in the **Upper Purity**, emanating from the **Primordial Azure Sky**, yet its hue was undetermined, its branches curving and twisting, beyond tracing or scrutiny.\n\nThe **Primordial Origin** refined it in the **Cavern Yang** hall and forged it in the **Flowing Fire** court, polishing its true form and radiating its luminous glow—**Cavern Yang’s essence** was crimson, hence its name, the *Scarlet Scripture*. When the **divine diagram** blazed forth, the **Ten Thousand Emperors** paid homage to the **True One**, flying through the void and walking on empty air, circling the **Upper Palace**, burning incense and scattering flowers, chanting the **Divine Verses** with their mouths. At that time, heaven sent down **Twelve Mysterious Auspices**, earth emitted **Twenty-Four Responses**, the **Upper Palace** celebrated the **Nine Heavens’ Cavern Depths**, and praised the **Three Heavens’ Precious Clarity**. The **divine wind** having stirred, the **Imperial Dao** was universally spread.\n\nThe **Primordial Origin** ascended to decree, the **Great True One** pressed the brush, the **Jade Consort** swept the mat, casting **golden tablets** and carving the *Scarlet Scripture Jade Edition*. The **Five Elders** held the **sacred talisman**, concealing it in the **Nine Heavens’ Cavern Depths**. The **Jade Maiden** attended to the incense, **Great Hua** held the cloth, the **Jade Boys** served as guards, and the **Jade Platform** faced the **Upper Courtyard**, where the **Nine Heavens’ Sacred Edict** was inscribed—unheard by ghosts or gods. Thus, heaven treasured it to bring about **floating prosperity**, earth concealed it to bring about **tranquility**, the **Five Emperors** wielded it to achieve **stabilization**, the **Three Lights** rode upon it to attain **high clarity**, the **Upper Sages** revered it to reach **divinity**, the **High Exalted** held it to attain **True Perfection**, the **Five Sacred Peaks** followed it to gain **spiritual resonance**, the **Son of Heaven** obtained it to bring about **governance**, and the **national lineage** enjoyed it for **great peace**.\n\nIt is indeed the **mysterious virtue** of the **divine script**, the **primordial root** of heaven and earth. Its **might and spirit** are vast and boundless, its **great transformation** sweeping and eternal, serving as the **foundation of the divine**. Its measure is unfathomable, towering in the **Great Void**. Its **true clarity** is fixed; now it is time to put it into practice.\n\nAt that time, the **Primordial Origin** transformed the cosmic order, the **mysterious symbols** opened the diagram, the **divine script** flourished luxuriantly, the **spiritual essence** spread across the **Five Directions**, dividing heaven and earth, enlightening all beings. This is the **great foundation’s work**; can it be briefly revealed in the **Divine Treasure Repository**?\n\nNow, the **Imperial Dao** is universally spread, its blessings reaching the **Ten Directions**. Gazing upward at the **kalpa’s end**, the **true wind** must be followed. My sincere wish is to spread the **Dao’s shade** to the **eight far reaches**, let the **true wind** scatter across the **orchid groves**, so that even withering branches may aspire to the **Primordial Yang’s abundance**, and decayed bones may receive the **Cavern Depths’ sacred blessings**.\n\nI humbly address the **Primordial Benevolence**, extending my **sincere supplication** below. Only by your pity and compassion may I hope to obtain the **Divine Treasure True Text’s transmission**, and teach those who have not yet heard?\n\nThus, the **Primordial Origin Celestial Sovereign** patted the table and raised his voice, concentrating his **True Essence** in deep contemplation. Observing that the time had arrived, he declared to all the **True Saints** of the **cosmic assembly**: *\"The principles of yin and yang are now determined, the **kalpa’s numbers** are calculated, the **River Source’s movements** are observed, the **heavenly degrees** are recorded, the **seed-people** are selected, and the **Great Void** is pointed out. The **Nine Mysteries** resound, and yet the **Three Millennia** remain unopened to common speech—it is as though a barrier obstructs the path to the **True**. At that time, the **Five Elders Supreme Emperor** repeatedly questioned, and after a long while, the **Primordial Origin Celestial Sovereign** lowered his gaze and sighed deeply: 'Alas! How profound it is! The matters you now inquire—are they not distant?\n\nThis is the **Primordial Origin’s Divine Treasure**, the **true text of void and naturalness**. It gives rise to heaven and earth, enlightens the **divine**, stabilizes the **Five Sacred Peaks**, and brings peace to the people. The **Divine Treasure** is profoundly mysterious, the **Most Exalted** of all things. Heaven sends forth **mysterious auspices**, and the **spiritual** responds naturally.\n\nNow, the **Three Heavens** are in **harmonious motion**, the **Six Heavens** follow the **Dao’s course**, and the **heterodox teachings** are opening their transformations. There will be **thirty-six thousand kinds of Dao** to choose from for those who seek the **True Way**. When this **Dao’s course** concludes, after the **Three Dragons**, in the year **Gengzi**, all **impure qi** will dissipate, and the **heavens will celebrate in assembly**. Then my **True Dao** will be followed.\n\nFor now, you may entrust it to me, and it shall be recorded in the **Upper Palace**. It has not yet been revealed in the **lower world**.

At that time, the **Five Elders of the Supreme Dao** and the **Assemblage of the True Saints**, holding incense and observing the **precepts**, wandered the **Cloud Paths** and issued their command to the **Ten Heavens**. They ascended to the **Upper Palace of the Great Primordial Mysterious Auspicious Jade Capital**, the **Celestial Cold Souls’ Hall of the Supreme Dao**, and received the **Divine Decree**—only then did they comprehend the **Heavenly Truth’s** nobility and rarity, too precious to be casually heard.\n\nUpon their return, they further consulted the **Primordial Beginning’s Celestial Sovereign** regarding the **rituals of the precepts**, humbly declining their inadequacy. Then the **Celestial Sovereign**, in compassionate benevolence, opened the **Spiritual Gate** and commanded the **Five Elders of the Supreme Dao** to reveal the ***Primordial Beginning’s Spiritually Precious Red Book of Jade Editions with True Scriptures***,* inscribed in **golden script and jade seals**, containing **subtle and secret** decrees to govern the **Great Illumination of Heaven and Earth**, the **Perfect Heavenly Incantation**, and the **Jade Chapters**. These were entrusted to the **Five Elders of the Supreme Dao** and the **Assemblage of the True Saints**, instructing them to follow the **Mysterious Teachings** and adhere to the **methods** to transmit them.\n\nI dare to speak: I observe that at the **Five Elders’** unmanifested beginning, the **Two Qi** had not yet divided, and the **Ten Thousand Forms** had not yet emerged. Reverently considering the **Primordial Beginning’s Supreme Dao**, it **congealed the Dao’s qi** in the **Chaotic Void**, and arranged the **True Scriptures** in the **Faint and Remote** divine winds, which then fanned and caused the **Two Qi** to separate. Once the **Two Qi** divided, the **Ten Thousand Forms** began to manifest.\n\nThen it descended the **congealed Dao’s qi** and bestowed the **arranged True Scriptures**, embedding them as the **River Luo’s** writings, thereby establishing **Human Dao** and governing the **Three Realms**. The **congealed Dao’s qi** and the **arranged True Scriptures** are what the present world calls **True Scriptures and Spiritually Precious Auspices**.\n\nYet the **Great True Scriptures** serve to distinguish **Heaven and Earth**, to regulate **Yin and Yang**, and to shape the **flowing and standing** of mountains and rivers, as well as the **birth and formation** of all beings—all these are the work of the **True Scriptures**. This is the **mechanism of creation and transformation**, the **divine function of Heaven and Earth**, which has yet never been transmitted to the **lower world**.\n\nOnly the **seals for guiding sentient beings, suppressing disasters, and subduing demons** are now seen in the world. These are the various **incantations** found in the ***Heavenly Incantations Section***. However, since the **scriptures** entered the world, transmitted by the **Upper True Ones** and received by the **lower immortals**, those who transmitted were not all **True Ones**, and those who received were not all **one person**, discrepancies in wording—whether detailed or concise, refined or coarse—are inevitable. Some texts, like the ***Heavenly Incantations Section’s** incantations for opening gates*, may be overly elaborate or lacking coherence, causing those who recite them to doubt their authenticity.\n\nI humbly follow the **Golden Gate’s** decrees, diligently cross-referencing and verifying the **ancient texts**, yet I dare not further discuss the **unconnected meanings** or **incoherent phrasing** found elsewhere. Only the **concise versions** of the **scriptures** may be deemed correct, lest the world’s doubts in recitation grow fiercer.\n\nI speak with utmost reverence.

The **Eastern Mountain**’s divine incantation summons the **Nine Heavens**, while the **Red Book Talisman** restrains the **Assembly of the Netherworld Mountains**. Bound demons and sentient spirits are slain without reprieve—all must submit to the **Wood Palace**. Let none dare delay.\n\nThe **seal** here is the **first thirty-two characters** of the sacred scripture, inscribed in the **Eastern Splendor’s Primordial Palace**, commanding the suppression of ghosts and demons, rectifying the **Nine Heavens’ Qi**. It subdues the **Eastern River** and the **Minghai Water Spirits**. In the **Great Cataclysm** of flooding calamities, the **Qianglong** and **dragon** bear their bodies. The **Water Palace** opens its way, traversing paths of myriad thousands. The **Supreme Heaven’s Red Scriptures** dispel wind and fire without obstruction.\n\nThe **seal** here is the **first thirty-two characters** of the sacred scripture, inscribed upon the **Nine Heavens’ Northeast Jade Gate and Vermilion Platform**, commanding the suppression of the **Eastern Sea Water Sovereign**, the **Great Cataclysm** of flooding calamities, and the summoning of **Qianglong** and water spirits. To avert water disasters, inscribe this text in **yellow** upon **green paper**, recite a separate incantation, and cast it into the water to dissolve difficulties.\n\nThe **Eastern Nine Qi’s *Lingbao* Jade Chapter True Scriptures** (120 characters total) are all from the **Supreme Lord’s Most High, Great Radiant, Perfect, and Great Divine Incantation**, the **Void and Natural Texts**, also known as the *Shēngshén Bǎozhēn Dòngxuán Zhāng*, the *Eastern Mountain Divine Incantation*, and the *Azure Sovereign’s Eight Thunders’ Scripture*. The **Eastern Nine Qi’s *Lingbao* Azure Sovereign Talisman** transforms and generates the **Red Sovereign’s Qi**, the **Three Heavens’ Nine Truths**, and the **Supreme Venerable of the Great Void**. The **Minor Yang’s Qi** transforms and generates the **Great Yang’s Three Qi**—the **Vermilion Heaven**, governing the **small cataclysm of the 6th degree** and the **great cataclysm of the 7th degree**, its cycles complete. The **Red Sovereign**, bearing this scripture, attains the power to avert calamities. The talisman follows as above; inscribe it with a **cinnabar brush** upon **green silk** measuring nine inches.\n\nThe **Eastern Azure Sovereign’s Primordial Talisman** summons the **Direct Talisman of the Nine Degrees** to safeguard the *Lingbao* Heavenly Scriptures. The **Daoist** who swallows it will have **sacred Qi** subduing the liver, generating the **Nine-Leaved Treasure of Azure Vitality**, and enslaving spirits to achieve communion with the **immortals**. The **Direct Talisman of the Nine Degrees** is the **Most High Supreme True**.\n\nThe **Primordial Heavenly Light Scriptures** emerge from the **Azure Sovereign’s True Scripture Chapter**, to pacify the **Eastern Nine Qi’s Heaven**. The **Azure Sovereign** receives this scripture to subdue the **Eastern Peak**, seals one copy, and hides it in the **Nine Sacred Caverns**. It opens once every **four ten-thousand-year cycles**. Those who cultivate the **Way** and belong to the **Eastern Peak**’s domain should inscribe it in **green** upon **crimson silk** and wear it on their person.\n\nOn the day of their birth, inscribe it in **red** and wear nine copies facing east. The **Direct Talisman of the Nine Degrees** enters the body with the talisman, residing in the liver. For nine years, the **Nine-Leaved Treasure of Azure Vitality** will grow, its radiance enveloping the form in nine layers. Additionally, inscribe it in **green** upon **crimson silk**, place it within the **divine staff**, and follow the **Black Sovereign’s** upper node. Nine **jade maidens** in **green robes** will attend as guardians. Let none fail to refine—there will be reckoning.\n\nThose who cultivate the **Way** should wear and recite the preceding talisman and seals, facing east and striking their teeth nine times. Visualize the **Azure Qi** entering the liver, generating the **Nine-Layered Radiance**, and illuminating the nape. Place the talisman before you and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Most High Azure Vitality, Great Sacred Nine Qi.\nDivine Light spreads far, flowing to the Eastern Azure.\nRadiant Treasures surge forth, bathing my form.\nPalaces and courts are pacified, my spirit essence self-born.\nVoid and Natural, eightfold clarity—\nAscend to the Jade Court.\"*\n\nThis is the separate incantation spoken before the talisman.\n\nThe **Eastern Azure Sovereign’s Three Primordial Talismans** command the **Nine-Degree Heavenly Sovereign**, the **Dragon Talisman** to safeguard the **True**. Though floods rage across myriad rivers, none shall dare to overflow the heavens. The **Lower Primordial** (9th degree of **Minor Yang**, 6th degree of **Great Yang**) brings great calamities. The **Azure Sovereign’s Lower Primordial Talisman** is sent to the **Eastern Peak**, preserving all things, securing the realm and its people, and regulating the **Nine Qi’s Heavenly divisions and degrees** to avert disasters for those who study it. Inscribe it in **green** upon **white silk**.\n\nThe **Central Mountain’s Divine Incantation** transforms one into a **divine minister**. It averts calamities for those whose fate is recorded. In the **Middle Primordial** (9th degree of **Great Yang**, 6th degree of **Great Yang**), crops wither and perish. The **Azure Sovereign’s Middle Primordial Talisman** is sent to the **Eastern Peak**, nurturing all things, regulating the **Heavenly divisions and degrees**, and averting great calamities for those who cultivate it. Inscribe it in **green** upon **white silk**.\n\nThe **Western Peak’s Upper Sovereign** commands preservation of the **True**. When one attains the **Way**, they serve among the **Nine Truths**. In the **Upper Primordial** (the **Great Cataclysm’s** cyclical return), the heavens and earth shift, and all—gold, jade, mountains, seas, people, birds, and beasts—are extinguished in an instant. The heavens and earth become **Mingjin**, devoid of light. The **Azure Sovereign’s Upper Primordial Talisman** is sent to the **Eastern Peak**, preserving all things, regulating the **Nine Heavens’ Qi**, and averting calamities for those who study it. These **Three Primordial Talismans** secure the **Azure Heaven’s Primordial Qi**—those who wear them attain the **Primordial portion’s** essence. This scripture emerges once every **nine thousand years**.\n\nThe **Eastern Peak’s Azure Sovereign** declares:\n*\"When the Great Cataclysm’s cycle returns, carve this upon **golden tablets** and wear it on your person. Inscribe it in **green** upon **white silk**.\"*\n\nThis is the **Jade Emperor’s** decree, bestowing upon the **Eastern Azure Sovereign of the Tranquil Treasure Forest** the **Nine Qi Heavenly Sovereign**, commanding them to govern the **Eastern realm’s** myriad heavens and earths, the **sun, moon, and stars**, the **sacred mountains and spirit caverns**, the **Water Palace and Spring Courts**, the **Supreme High Venerable and True Immortals**, and all **powerful spirits**.

      "translated_text": "The humble subject respectfully declares:\n\nThe Five Elders of the Celestial Sovereign govern the Five Heavens, and all life upon the earth falls under their dominion. None surpass their exalted role in nurturing the Mystic Dao’s creation. Therefore, when the Jade Sovereign first ascended in the Great Calamity, He bestowed the *Way* to save humanity, to curb disasters and subdue demons. The *True Scriptures of the Jade Canon* were entrusted to them, to guide those seeking Daoist cultivation, to avert celestial calamities, to still the great floods, and to restrain demonic harm—all for the sake of enriching the blessings of creation, ensuring all beings find their rightful place. The Five Elders, having received this mandate, now uphold their sacred duty.\n\nYet fearing the Emperor’s grace might not yet be fully extended or that living beings might still suffer, after the Jade Sovereign’s radiant manifestation, they further proclaimed and transmitted the *True Scriptures* they had received, passing them down to future generations. Ah! The Emperor’s compassion is so profound! And the Five Elders, in broadening and fulfilling this mission, are they not embodying the benevolent hearts of the Highest Saints?\n\nThe *Five-Part True Scriptures* are fully recorded in Daoist texts, with their seals and methods of invocation detailed in the various scriptures. What is now inscribed in the *Scripture of Original Practice* is but the core text. Since the *Scripture of Original Practice* centers on recitation, the core text must be preserved, though the seals and auxiliary methods may be omitted. As for all talismans, the Five-Qi *True Scriptures of the Five-Qi*, and the Three-Epoch talismans, these are likewise omitted here and recorded at the end of the scripture. Practitioners must apply them accordingly, but above all, the recitation of the true seals and core text must be performed with utmost reverence. For this text is the Jade Sovereign’s decree. When the decree is proclaimed, all spirits hear it and bow in submission. Should one treat it with negligence, reciting it carelessly as mere common scripture, uttering it lightly with lips and tongue as idle chatter, then the punishments shall be severe—just as recorded in the *Chapter on Retribution and Response*. Those who recite the scripture must venerate it with solemn devotion. The humble subject respectfully declares this.\n\nThe Dao proclaims: This is the Great Divine Spell—the Primordial’s wondrous speech, the Jade Sovereign’s true decree, the Upper Clarity’s natural sacred text, the Primordial Five-Heavens’ mystic tablet, the void’s luminous chapter, the Highest Saints’ secret utterance, the Celestial Dawn’s exalted canon. It establishes Heaven and Earth, unfurls myriad truths, calms the spirit and subdues the numinous, nurtures and sustains the myriad peoples, rectifies and governs the cosmic order, and preserves eternal Heaven. It governs celestial mechanisms above, inspects the Five Spirits in the middle, strategizes earthly deities below, commands the Yellow River’s source, directs the forces of yin and yang, and summons gods while dispatching immortals. This is the ultimate true text—its divine efficacy is spontaneous. It clarifies the heavens, stabilizes the earth, and safeguards the Five Sacred Peaks, ensuring all things endure. The Jade Sovereign once bestowed it upon the Five Elders of the Celestial Sovereign. At that time, the Five Emperors knelt, reverently receiving the tablet, and secretly inscribed it in the Hall of the Spirit Capital. The Primordial True Man formerly recorded this text and entrusted it to the Upper Clarity’s True Realm, the Supreme Mystic Jade Capital, the Cold Spirit Hall of the Purple Micro, enduring through countless kalpas, its essence preserved at the Heavenly Root, uncorrupted and unlost, shifting with the cosmic cycles. This Great Divine Spell is undefiled by mixture, its purity only deepened by defilement; it cannot be destroyed by ruin, for ruin only reveals its brilliance. It is the Great One’s text, revered by the Primordial True—from the Radiant #3 True Name, inscribed on imperial tablets, revealed to future generations. This sacred text is hidden and secret, not to be glimpsed or heard by any. Those who attain it shall preserve the eternal *qi* and, through diligent practice, attain divinity.\n\nThe humble subject respectfully declares: The *Five-Part Jade Book True Scriptures* possess divine functions beyond measure. If one obtains the *Scriptures for Guiding and Recording Immortals* and applies them, then the Nine-Heavens’ assembled immortals shall be recorded in the celestial registers, and their *qi* shall be transmitted to guide them. If one obtains the *Scriptures for Governing Stars* and applies them, then the sun, moon, and stars shall shine upon one’s form, the constellations shall ward off misfortune, and life, spirit, *qi*, and fate shall suffer no destruction. If one obtains the *Scriptures for Subduing Demons* and applies them, then the Northern Underworld shall fear its might, ten thousand demons shall be bound, and a hundred evils shall tremble in reverence, daring not to encroach. If one obtains the *Scriptures for Governing Water* and applies them, then the ten thousand dragons shall protect their forms, the Water Palaces shall revere in awe, and on the day of cosmic destruction, one may ride the great serpents and ascend the Nine Heavens. Ah! The divine functions and marvelous efficacy—can they truly be measured?\n\nYet the methods of application hold secret keys, not all of which common folk may attain. Only those who seek the Dao must emulate these methods and practice them diligently. Thus the scripture says: *\"Those who attain it shall preserve the eternal qi and, through diligent practice, attain divinity.\"* The humble subject, having verified the scripture, dares not omit its essentials and thus informs those who come after. May the Highest Saints look upon this with favor. The humble subject, Liang, respectfully declares.",

May You benefit the Four Assemblies, the *Devā* (天尊), the Four Heavenly Kings, all the celestial beings, all the immortals, and all future beings who uphold and proclaim this scripture.\"*\n\nThe Celestial Worthy then said to the Jade Void Emperor: *\"How splendid this question! Is it not excellent?\"*\n*\"You, moved by compassion and pity for all beings, thus inquire of me.\"*\n\nThe Celestial Worthy said: *\"Should any in the Three Realms and the Ten Directions—whether a kingdom’s ruler, great ministers, or common folk—face war’s outbreak, rampant pestilence, drought, flood, locusts, or famine, then the sovereign, the queen, the crown prince, the prime ministers, and the great ministers must awaken their compassion. They shall universally command the officials of their domains and prefectures to purify and sanctify the Daoist adepts (*dàoliú*). Within their temples, they shall establish grand fasting and exorcistic rites (*zhāijiào*), practicing the Dao at all six times of day, to circulate this scripture. Thus, the land shall know peace, the five grains shall flourish, and the people shall prosper in security.\"*\n\nThe humble subject respectfully declares: *\"There is a saying in the world: ‘Sacrificial feathers cannot dispel a siege, and a village feast cannot halt a war.’ This is the natural order of affairs. Bold bandits first take up arms, and robbers and traitors first harbor treacherous intentions. Unless wisdom and strategy surpass them, or valor and strength overcome them, their tyranny shall never be thwarted.*\n\n*Yet now, within the *Yùdì Jīng*, it is said that when war erupts, one must command the officials and commoners to have the Daoist adepts recite the True Scripture to quell it—how absurd! Alas, this is far from correct. When celestial omens manifest above, terrestrial calamities arise below; war and strife stem from the discord of yin and yang, the entanglement of fate and chaos, and only then do disasters spread and chaos erupt. Examining past records confirms this truth.*\n\n*Thus, the scripture’s teaching is this: when a state faces turmoil, one must use this method to appease and invoke the heavens, to dissipate celestial omens and quell terrestrial calamities—not to suppress rebellion with this scripture alone. As for arming soldiers, fortifying walls, and deepening moats, can these ever be abandoned for a single day?*\n\n*In the past, there were foolish rulers, their vision obscured, who claimed that Buddhist and Daoist scriptures and spells could repel enemies. They soon met with disaster, inviting ridicule, and to this day, their shame endures—a pity indeed. Now, those in the world who misunderstand this scripture often cite it as grounds for slander. The humble subject, Liang, dares to correct this through verification of the text.\"*\n\n---\n\n**If one enters the mountains and forests and encounters venomous or ferocious beasts, but merely retains the thought and recites this True Scripture with sincerity, the mountain spirits shall guard and protect, the wild beasts shall retreat, and harm shall never befall them.**\n\n**If one enters rivers or seas to gather treasures and rare gems and encounters fierce winds, and recites this True Scripture according to the method, the winds and waves shall instantly cease, and they shall reach the shore in safety.**\n\n**If one is in battle, with spears and blades already clashing, and in their heart silently recites this True Scripture, then all evil bandits shall retreat and disperse.**\n\n**If one is imprisoned in shackles and stocks, with a pure heart and steady mind, and recites this True Scripture, wrongs shall be righted, and liberation shall be attained.**\n\n**If one is tormented by malevolent spirits or demonic assailants, and recites this True Scripture according to the method, the evil shall flee, and the affliction shall naturally be cured.**\n\n**If one seeks descendants, and with reverence recites this True Scripture according to the method, the Jade Emperor shall command the Celestial Registrar to inspect the *Dānjí* (Register of the Immortal), and among the Nine Ranks, the Four Fruits of Immortality, one whose fate aligns shall descend and be reborn as their child—endowed with eloquence and wisdom, held in honor among mortals.**\n\n**If a woman faces a perilous pregnancy, and recites this True Scripture according to the method, she shall give birth safely, bearing a son or daughter of virtue and fortune, beloved by all.**\n\n**If one seeks advancement in office or noble favor at court, and recites this True Scripture according to the method, their rank shall ascend, their descendants shall prosper, and their lineage shall endure for generations.**\n\n**If one desires wealth and abundance, and with devotion recites this True Scripture, their treasures shall overflow, their sustenance shall be effortless, and blessings shall flow to their descendants, passed down through the ages.**\n\n**If one is afflicted by malevolent stars, suffering in misery, and recites this True Scripture according to the method, those stars shall retreat and bring forth auspicious fortune.**\n\n**If one’s lifespan has ended and they are destined for the underworld, their name recorded in the Register of Evil, then their parents, teachers, spouses, and children must recite this True Scripture for them—or establish a Daoist ritual site with banners and floral offerings. Thus, the deceased’s evil record shall be erased, and their spirit shall be reborn in a Pure Land. All suffering souls shall be protected and guided, attaining this supreme victory and ascending to the heavens.**\n\n**Moreover, wherever this scripture resides, the Ten Heavenly *Zhìzhēn Dàshèng Wújí Fēitiān Shénwáng* (Supreme True Saints of the Boundless Flying Celestial) shall always attend and venerate it. Those who uphold this scripture may rightfully call themselves *Zhèngyī Zhēnrén* (Orthodox True Persons). Such individuals, wherever they go, shall be invisibly guarded by the *Jīnjiāng Lìshì* (Golden-Armored Vajra Warriors) from the Ten Directions—protecting them as their own body.

      "translated_text": "「When the life of one who upholds this scripture draws to its end, they shall not witness the dreadful forms of the underworlds, but instead shall see all the celestial palaces filled with jade maidens bearing banners to welcome them, ascending to the heavens.\n\nShould their celestial blessings be exhausted and they descend into the mortal realm, they shall perpetually be reborn as emperors and kings throughout countless lifetimes, ensuring the land remains serene and the people prosper in their livelihoods. Moreover, they shall attain the nature of their former lives, follow the Dao/Way, and through successive cultivation, ultimately reach the shore of transcendence.\n\nSuch are the blessings bestowed upon those who uphold this scripture.\n\nFurthermore, if one who upholds this scripture, when rain falls, awakens a great compassion and, as prescribed, recites this scripture three times in the direction of the sky, all beings touched by the rain or within the direction they face—those who have committed the Five Treasons and Ten Evils, or any grave offenses—shall have their sins utterly eradicated, and all severe illnesses shall be instantly cured.\n\nThese beings, upon death, shall not fall into the underworlds but be reborn in Pure Lands, emerging from lotus flowers. How much more so shall those who uphold this scripture themselves!\n\nAgain, if one who upholds this scripture walks along a path when a great wind arises and blows, the dust that touches their body shall, upon contact, cause all beings in the direction it settles to have their evil deeds entirely extinguished. They shall not be reborn in the Three Evil Paths but ascend to the heavens.\n\nThus, the virtues of upholding this scripture are beyond reckoning.\n\nIf one who upholds this scripture bathes in rivers, lakes, or seas, the water touching their body shall purify all beings within it—fish, turtles, crocodiles, and all aquatic creatures—clearing away their sins. After this single lifetime, upon their death, they shall no longer be reborn in any form, whether as an embryo, egg, or wet-born being.\n\nThe words spoken by one who upholds this scripture, whether good or evil, shall all be heard by celestial and demonic forces, the Ten Directions, and external Dao/Way sects, as pure and sacred teachings.\n\nIf one who upholds this scripture encounters any shrine of the gods, they may recite this scripture for its deity. All spirits and gods who hear it shall escape their ghostly fate, ascend to the path of true immortals, and revere this person as they would an emperor.\n\nShould a person in this world fail to honor their parents, disrespect the Three Jewels, engage in killing, theft, licentiousness, or false speech, and commit countless grave offenses, and upon nearing death, if there are any with a Dao/Way-heart and true faith in all beings, they may, during the dying person’s last breaths, awaken great compassion and invoke the name of the Emperor at their head—whether seven times, fourteen times, twenty-one times, twenty-eight times, up to a hundred or a thousand recitations—thus all the unvirtuous deeds committed in their lifetime shall be utterly eradicated. They shall not fall into any evil realm, and their spirit shall ascend to the Nine Heavens. How much more so shall those who uphold and receive this scripture!\n\nAgain, if one has, from past kalpas until this very life, cycled through human and heavenly realms, drifted across all worlds, accumulating myriad sins and transgressions, and if they merely encounter the shadow of one who upholds this scripture cast upon their body—or are illuminated by the Emperor’s light—or hear their words, or even converse with them—as though receiving the Emperor’s spoken teachings and consolation—then their sins and obstacles shall be permanently removed.\n\nIf one who upholds this scripture crafts a long banner and inscribes the Emperor’s name upon it, raising it on tall poles, whether in temples or households, and the wind blows it, pointing in any direction, all beings in that path shall attain supreme victory, and their evil deeds shall be utterly eradicated.\n\nIf one who upholds this scripture writes the Emperor’s name upon any resonant object—whether bells, chimes, gongs, or drums—all ritual implements and Dao/Way instruments, whether used in a Dao/Way hall, struck in a ceremony, or touched by the wind, their sound, near or far, shall cause all beings who hear it to have their sins and obstacles completely purified.\n\nIf one who upholds this scripture, having penetrated the mysteries of birth and death, retreats into the mountains and forests to cultivate true virtue and learn the Dao/Way, and at times ascends to gaze upon the world, wherever their eyes reach—across mountains, forests, streams, and valleys—all living beings, whether formed or formless, born from eggs, wombs, or moisture, and all mobile or rooted creatures, shall have their sins permanently removed. Their body and mind shall be cleansed, and upon death, they shall be reborn in the heavens. How much more so shall those who uphold and receive this scripture!\n\nKnow that such a person is indeed the embodiment of the Dao/Way’s treasury of virtues.\n\nYour humble servant respectfully states: The words of the Heavenly Sage are true and not false, genuine and not fraudulent.\n\nYet, those who are ignorant in this world and lack true understanding, seeing only superficial interpretations, may even doubt minor passages in other scriptures, assuming no such principles exist in the world. Alas! Why do they not carefully examine and deeply investigate, pondering and savoring the meaning, rather than seeking it in convoluted ways?\n\nIn the *Function and Virtue Chapter*, the Heavenly Sage speaks of the blessings attained by those who uphold the scripture—such as dying and ascending to the heavens, or being reborn as emperors and kings across countless lifetimes. He also describes how, when reciting the scripture during rain, walking paths during windstorms, bathing in water, gazing upon mountains, or casting shadows, they can bestow upon all beings the eradication of their sins and the attainment of great virtues—yet some claim no such principles exist.\n\nThey say that the blessings of emperors and kings are too lofty to be surpassed, and that the virtues of reciting scriptures cannot truly be attained or verified.\n\nMuch less could one perpetually be reborn as an emperor or king across countless lifetimes!\n\nThey further claim that the blessings of reciting scriptures may apply to oneself, but not to beings burdened with grave sins and transgressions, who suffer retribution across four lives. This is the unalterable decree of the heavens, not a single hair’s breadth can be changed. Even if the scripture endures for a hundred kalpas without perishing, the fruit of karma must still be borne by oneself. How could the body of one who recites the scripture, in a single passing, instantly liberate them and grant such blessings?»",

uphold this **sutra**—\ntheir offense is such that,\nafter death,\nthey fall into the **Great Hell**,\nwith no hope of escape.\n\nHow much worse for those in the world\nwho encounter this **sutra**,\nyet fail to show reverence,\ntouching it with impure hands,\nreciting it with unclean mouths,\nplacing it on defiled beds,\nor reading it aloud while speaking vulgarities,\nlaughing and jesting as if it were a common text.\nSuch beings,\nafter death,\nfall into the **Uninterrupted Hell**,\nwith no hope of escape.\nTheir misfortunes extend to nine generations,\nsuffering under the **Nine Judges of the Underworld**,\nafflicting their descendants through endless calamities.\nIn the **Hell Realms**, they endure unimaginable suffering for countless eons,\nencountering countless **Sages** who repeatedly rescue them,\nyet their crimes diminish only slightly.\n\nAgain, when rescued by a **Sage** and reborn as a **Hungry Ghost**,\nthey wander for thousands of millions of eons,\nnever hearing the name of water or food.\nWhen their **Ghostly Retribution** ends,\nthey are reborn as **Animals**,\nand from there,\nif reborn as humans,\nthey become barbarians, heretics,\nor

Officials**,\ntheir names are added to the **Black Registers**,\ntheir merits subtracted from the **Blue Ledgers**,\nand after death,\nthey are imprisoned in dark dungeons,\ntrapped in the **Three Paths of Retribution**,\nwith no means of liberation.\nOr in this very life,\nthey suffer countless diseases—\n**scabies, epilepsy, leprosy, and ulcers**—\nas their just retribution.\nThey are tormented by sorrow and suffering day and night;\nor they are harmed by violent forces,\nimprisoned in chains,\nwrongfully taking their own lives,\npoisoned by toxins,\ndevoured by tigers, wolves, or venomous snakes,\nslain by enemies,\nor while wandering in mountains and forests,\nthey are slaughtered by bandits,\npushed from cliffs,\nor ravaged by malevolent spirits and demons.\nOr they perish in fires, floods,\nor by the blades of weapons.\nThus, those who slight this **sutra** meet untimely deaths,\nreaping such fruits.\n\nHow can one not grieve?\nHow can one not lament?\nTherefore, I declare to you:\nFollow this teaching faithfully,\nand do not harbor evil thoughts.\nIf no evil thoughts arise,\nall entanglements cease,\nand the **sand-like evil karmas** dissolve with the

Unbeknownst to them, they find themselves within the Five Clouds, and soon their body radiates a brilliant light, ascending to the Celestial Palace, where the **Immortal Worthies** descend to greet them. Whatever their heart desires is granted, and they may freely take elixirs and treasures of the Dao. Thus, one must follow the ritual method, close their heart to distractions, and uphold this scripture. Even the **Three-World Golden Immortals** and **Ten-Direction Great Saints** all depend upon this scripture for their practices, thereby attaining the **Supreme Wondrous Dao** in an instant.\n\nThis is the **Celestial Sovereign**—the **Teacher of All Heavens** and the **King of All Saints**. Therefore, even the common mortal who encounters this scripture shall receive the Five Emperors’ patronage, summoning spirits and immortals, commanding celestial officials, regulating yin and yang, earning the reverence of myriad spirits, and subduing ten thousand deities. Malevolent forces flee in terror, and all demons are bound in form. After death, they shall ascend to the **Southern Palace** for refinement, tread the **Flying Steps to Upper Purity**, and wander freely in eternal Dao.\n\nFurthermore, even if a worldly being has merely heard of this scripture and harbors constant longing, they may, within their home, select a pure place, draw the **Celestial Sovereign’s** likeness, and with utmost devotion, morning and evening, offer incense, flowers, lamps, and fruits in reverent worship, invoking the name and paying homage. Such a person shall attain **thirty kinds of supreme wondrous virtues**:\n1. Praise from all immortals,\n2. Ascension to heaven for the deceased,\n3. Liberation from past calamities,\n4. Smooth passage wherever they go,\n5. Freedom from theft and robbery,\n6. All desires fulfilled,\n7. Protection from water and fire disasters,\n8. Concealment from all misfortune,\n9. Auspicious dreams at night,\n10. No sickness afflicting them,\n11. Wisdom and keen intelligence,\n12. Universal joy upon meeting others,\n13. Abundant clothing and food,\n14. Honorable descendants,\n15. Joy from relatives,\n16. Harmony within the clan,\n17. Escape from the three evil retributions,\n18. Transformation from female to male,\n19. Noble and dignified appearance,\n20. Appointment as a great minister of the realm,\n21. Birth as an emperor,\n22. Reverence from ghosts and spirits,\n23. Knowledge of past lives,\n24. Protection by all deities,\n25. Blessings upon the Nine Clans,\n26. Longevity in this world,\n27. Dependence of all sentient beings upon their virtue,\n28. The **Demon King’s** protection and welcome,\n29. Transcendence of the Three Realms,\n30. Ascension in broad daylight.\n\nAt that time, the **Celestial Worthy** further declared to the Four Assemblies: *\"The virtues of this scripture can shatter iron-clad mountains, drain the waters of the Sea of Suffering, break the Great Hell, uproot profound sins, subdue violent demon kings, protect all lands, extinguish all malevolent ghosts, cure all grave illnesses, dissolve all poisons, sever ties with all wicked beings, subdue all venomous beasts, and crush all heretical paths. All the heavens shall bow in submission. Its remaining virtues are too vast to enumerate.\"*\n\nWhen the **Dao Assembly**, **Golden Immortals**, **Bodhisattvas of Truth**, and the **Consorts of the Saints** heard these words, they rejoiced, leapt for joy, bowed in reverence, and composed this hymn:\n\n*\"Great is the Supreme Dao, without equal among the Highest True Ones.\nAbove, it transcends all heavens; below, it rescues the lost souls.\nAbove, it has no teachers or ancestors—only the Dao as its body.\nIn the **Dan Platform** and **Purple Bureaus**, the **Golden Gates** and **Jade Capitals**,\nThis wondrous law is kept in secret, bestowing boundless blessings upon all sentient life.\nIt annihilates my ten thousand sins, extending my years of life.\nTen thousand spirits pay homage, the Demon King welcomes me in protection.\nIts virtues flourish eternally, inscribed in the **Yellow Register**.\nThrough countless eons, it grants me eternal existence.\"*\n\nThus, the assembly finished their hymn, bowed in homage, and withdrew with reverence. Your humble servant speaks: *\"None is more august than the heavens, yet **Mahāraja Heaven** is the heaven of heavens; none is more noble than the emperors, yet the **Jade Emperor of the Supreme** is the emperor of emperors.\"* Therefore, the **Celestial Worthy** declared: *\"This is the Emperor—Teacher of All Heavens, King of All Saints.\"*\n\nSince this Emperor occupies the most exalted and noble position, unmatched and unconquerable, those who harbor reverence shall attain virtues without equal. Those who harbor disdain shall incur retributions without equal. The **thirty kinds of supreme wondrous virtues** are but the **Celestial Worthy’s** summary; the full account of sins and retributions is detailed within the chapter itself—a mere outline spoken by the **Celestial Worthy**.\n\nIf beings seek fortune and encounter this scripture, they should ponder it thrice. Reflect upon its beginning and end, its words and meanings, storing its essence in their minds. Strive to recite and uphold it diligently for three years, accumulating boundless merit.\n\nHaving received the edict to collate this scripture, your humble servant respectfully petitions to establish a dedicated bureau to record the merits accumulated by those who copy, recite, and uphold the *Jade Emperor’s Biographies and Scriptures*, demonstrating divine retribution. The Emperor’s benevolence shall surely grant this request.\n\nThis is the conclusion of the scripture—let all beings take heed.\n\nYour humble servant speaks with utmost reverence.\n**The Complete Scriptures of the Jade Emperor’s Biographies and Deeds, Volume Complete.**\n*(End of the white-text edition.

We cherish it and depart* [故寻光化身下降，云珍重而去].\"*\n\nFrom the *Jin Gui Ling Wen* [《金匮灵文》].",
