  "full_translation": "The *Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the Most High*\n**Title:** *Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the Most High*\nAuthor unknown, approximately dated to the end of the Northern and Southern Dynasties. Six fascicles.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Benwen* Category.\n\n**The Jade Clarity Realm Scripture of the Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the Most High**\n*Jade Clarity Realm Scripture, Supreme Clarity Scripture, Wondrous Perfection Scripture, Great Unity Scripture, Wondrous Grove Scripture, Enlightenment Scripture, Immortal’s Scripture*—the above six scriptures in one fascicle.\n\n**Jade Clarity Realm, Supreme Clarity Scripture** (First)\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy spoke: When all perfected beings and boundless great spirits cultivate the mind of the Dao and practice the acts of compassion, they attain the realm of true dharma. When they cultivate the mind of relinquishment and practice the acts of wisdom, through these merits—even after immeasurable kalpas—what dharma do they again attain?\n\nAll the sacred hosts of heaven, all great perfected beings, and boundless great spirits who practice these merits can attain the inconceivable.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy now expounds this dharma, enabling all to know this teaching.\n\nThe Precious Dharma Perfected One said: Your servant has yet to comprehend the essential dharma, has yet to recognize the fundamental source, has yet to fathom the mark of emptiness, has yet to understand all things.\n\nThe Dao replied: Excellent, excellent! You know the time well and understand my exposition of the dharma. You now inquire of the perfected beings, great spirits, and boundless sacred hosts who cultivate all practices and all wisdoms. They attain effortless peace and abide in the palace of true emptiness, equality, and self-mastery over all dharmas—the realm of unexcelled joy, the land of merit and virtue, the kingdom of radiant sovereignty.\n\nYou should know that all sentient beings endure immeasurable suffering and manifold sorrows. Yet now, all equally restore their bodies to their original state, receive every bliss, and escape birth and death. They neither change nor differ, truly and rightly abiding in the skillful means of the dharma. In future ages, they will possess skillful arts and techniques, establish abundant meritorious deeds, cultivate the practice of generosity, and honor with reverence.\n\nSpeaking thus, excellent indeed!\n\nAll of you can also, within the heaven of heavens and in the world, greatly augment and benefit all matters, enabling sentient beings to attain immeasurable lifespans.\n\nYou are now the third of the great physicians, skillfully treating the immeasurable grave illnesses of sentient beings. You skillfully administer remedies and prescriptions, healing everywhere without pause. For sentient beings, you eradicate the roots of illness, employing skillful means to treat all manner of diseases. Gradually wandering, you benefit sentient beings with immeasurable joy.\n\nAmong all assemblies, you are the most supreme and revered.\n\nBy what causes and conditions have you now attained such wisdom and encountered such merit?\n\nHolding precepts and cultivative concentration—most difficult indeed to attain such supreme fields of merit. All such matters arise from past karmic conditions, spanning past, future, and present, yielding vast and distant karmic retribution: forms refined and wondrous, appearances singular and distinguished, majesty and virtue fully endowed. They enable all to dwell in peace and receive joy, then relinquish all manner of illnesses—countless hundreds of thousands of fears—able to dispel them, able to establish for sentient beings great merit and transgression.\n\nUnborn and illusory, the world’s emptiness and existence—this body is impermanent, this body is impure, this body is like an illusion, this body is like a dream, this body is like a bubble’s reflection, this body is like floating clouds, this body is like fierce fire, this body is like wind and dew, this body is like frost and snow. Contemplating thus, most fearful indeed, most loathsome indeed. Seeking the supreme quiescence of Nirvāṇa, forever parted from sorrow, most supremely pure, beyond the mutations of impermanence, resting from the cycle of birth and death, free from all dust-like burdens, with immeasurable focused thought, wisdom, and merit—perfecting the wondrous Dharma-body, adorned with the hundred virtues, praised by all devas.\n\nThus, boundless and immeasurable, making this great vow, he spoke in verse:\n\nIn past kalpas without measure,\nfor all sentient beings,\nI illuminated the true Dao.\nSurveying all things,\nlike the unmoving,\nyet unharmed,\nby the power of liberation.\n\nWere one to speak of it,\nendless kalpas would not suffice.\n\nIf there be a perfected one,\nor one still learning:\nlet them relinquish what is hard to relinquish.\nBecause it is hard to relinquish,\nwith body unharmed—\nthis is the true Dao.\n\n*Upper Clarity Scripture of the Jade Clarity Realm*\n**End**\n\nThe *Wondrous True Scripture of the Jade Clarity Realm*, Chapter Two\n\nSuch is the supreme Dharma, boundless in great compassion. Cultivating the mind, cultivating all dharmas, it is foremost in courage and vigor among all learners—unfathomable, wondrous, like the supreme Dao, beyond all comparison, vast as the great sea, equal to empty space.\n\nCountless devas and great sages, innumerable perfected ones and divine spirits, all rejoiced and spoke thus, desiring to seek the supreme, correct, and wondrous Dharma.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"You dwell in the realm of empty equality, difficult to surpass, where there is no perception of father or mother, brothers or kin, acquaintances, sisters, children, or those of love and hate—just as empty space has no father or mother, no brothers, and even no sentient beings or lifespans. All dharmas are likewise. With a mind of equality, benefiting many, like empty space itself—why? Because by practicing virtue and skillfully cultivating all the dharmas of emptiness, the inner dharma of emptiness is attained: constant bliss, true self, purity, and fearlessness.\n\nWithin this inner dharma, though the nature of the Dao exists, this nature is neither inner nor outer, neither above nor below, neither existent nor nonexistent. Its true nature is eternal, unchanging—this is called the true teaching. Observing inner emptiness, outer emptiness, and the emptiness of the original nature of all dharmas—impermanent, suffering and joyful, pure and impure—this is called the correct Dharma.\n\nYou, all boundless and immeasurable holy assemblies, perfected ones, divine spirits, and devas, constantly penetrate the wondrous principle herein, broadly extending it to all—those present now, those of the past, and those of the future—so that they may attain this gate of emptiness, profound beyond profundity, and dwell in empty space.\n\nWhen I spoke of these meanings of emptiness among the great assembly, hundreds of thousands of millions of beings, upon hearing this teaching, immediately dwelt in the dharma equal to empty space. Having abided in this realm, they were free from all obstructions, fetters, and attachments in all dharmas, their minds without confusion or distress, constantly delighting in freedom, pure and without action.\n\nFor this reason, all dharmas are named equal to empty space. Just as empty space does not generate greed for lovely forms, nor anger toward unloved forms, so too, having dwelt in this realm, are you all likewise. In all dharmas, you see and know. Whether in action, conditions, causes, roots, essences, thoughts, vehicles, encounters with good teachers, upholding precepts, or practicing generosity—all such dharmas are fully known and seen, leading to the supreme liberation, most profound.\n\nThe wisdom of their practice sees all beings who commit unwholesome acts, inevitably falling into hells, enduring boundless suffering. Knowing beings who emerge from hells and are born among humans—if they practice generosity and fulfill all virtues—such givers will surely enter correct liberation. This is called the correct, true, and wondrous Dharma.\n\nThere is also seeing and knowing. What is this seeing?\"\n\nWhat is this knowing? Whether existent or non-existent, suffering and affliction do not arise; there is constant bliss, true self, and purity. Calamities and hindrances vanish; all is non-action. Those who attain the divine samādhi of the honored ones do not enter the cycle of birth and death, steadfast and indestructible. Having already achieved accomplishment, they also know that all beings possess the nature of the Dao.\n\nAnd a verse says:\nI recall past lives—\nall is impermanent,\nprovisional among dharmas,\nyet not empty.\nThe five sense treasures—\nfrom where do they arise?\nThey cannot but be empty,\nthe gateway to liberation.\nHow wondrous, never before seen!\nAt all times, the multitude\ncannot grasp its meaning—\nsuch is its nature.\nThose with wisdom who hear this,\nthe gateway to liberation,\nshould all revere it,\nreceive this Dharma with their crowns.\n\n*Marvelous True Scripture’s Numinous Talisman*\n*End of the Marvelous True Scripture of the Jade-Pure Realm*\n\n*Third Chapter of the Scripture of the Great One of the Jade-Pure Realm*\nThe Great Dao’s Illuminating Words:\nAll dharmas, boundless wisdom—\nthey cause all gods and humans, great sages, immeasurable perfected ones, and all dharma-realms—whether form or formless, with characteristics or without—to each attain faith in their hearts.\n\nKnowing that these beings seek the true teaching:\nsome flow with the current, some do not;\nsome abide rightly, some do not.\nWhen one knows this Dharma,\nthey have reached the shore of the Dharma,\ndwelling in the supreme realm,\ngaining the profound flavor of the Dharma,\nobtaining the root of the Dharma,\nattaining correct liberation.\nCultivating all right practices,\nwith the pure heavenly eye,\nthey see all beings whose three karmic actions of body, speech, and mind are unwholesome,\nfalling into hells, animal realms, or hungry ghost realms,\nenduring unbearable suffering—\nblades of wind coming and going,\nunceasing day and night.\nThey see beings who cultivate wholesome karma,\nadvancing with vigor and diligence,\npracticing and upholding the Dao,\nstriving to save others.\nKnow that such beings will be born in the heavens,\nenjoying boundless bliss;\nif born among humans,\nthey will be surpassingly wise.\n\nThrough immeasurable kalpas,\nI have seen beings pass from darkness to darkness,\nconfused and deluded,\nunable to awaken;\nsome pass from darkness to light,\ngaining knowledge and insight;\nsome pass from light to darkness,\nabandoning truth for falsehood,\nunable to recognize the Dao;\nsome pass from light to light,\nlike the full moon of true suchness.\n\nYet all may be due to:\nthe fruition of evil karma,\nor the deep-rooted karma of greed, hatred, and delusion—\nsuch beings inevitably fall into hells,\nreceiving all manner of retribution.\nIf such beings can arouse the mind to cultivate the body and precepts,\npractice various dharmas,\nawaken and reflect,\nthey will not fall into hells.\nThey repent and reveal all their past evils;\nhaving repented today,\nfrom this day forward,\nthey dare not commit them again.\nWith shame and remorse fulfilled,\nthey escape the three evil destinies,\nmake offerings to the Three Jewels,\nand through these causes and conditions,\nthey do not fall into hells,\nobtaining great blessings,\nvarious karmic rewards,\nadornments to their bodies,\nattaining the wondrous marks of the heavens,\npure and at ease,\nlike the blue lotus,\nfulfilling all fruition.\n\nIf, however, they give rise to thoughts of disbelief,\nall evil karma and transgressions will follow,\ntheir desires unfulfilled,\ntheir wishes unmet,\ntheir deeds unaccomplished,\ntheir hopes unachieved,\nendless sorrows and worries,\nnot just one kind.\nThey receive such immeasurable suffering,\nexperiencing retribution in this very life.\n\nThe perfected ones of boundless great compassion, great wisdom, and great insight see such beings,\nunaware of causes and conditions,\nunable to repent,\nunable to reflect,\nunable to awaken,\nunable to feel shame or remorse,\nwithout fear—\ntheir transgressions grow,\nthey receive retribution in hells.\nWhen will they attain liberation?\nEndlessly lost in darkness,\nenduring every kind of suffering.\n\nYet such beings also possess the nature of the Dao,\nbut it is obscured by afflictions,\nunable to perceive the light of wisdom,\nthe immeasurable merits and virtues—\nlike a dark night,\nwhat they see is not true.\n\nAll worldly men and women,\nwhether known or unknown,\nwhether coming or going,\nwhether near or far,\ntheir dwellings, cities, and villages,\nclothing and food,\nmountains, seas, and forests,\nthe lifespans of beings—\nall are the root of the Dao,\nwithout other characteristics,\nwithout other forms,\nsupremely wondrous and pure,\nutterly quiescent and non-active,\neternally living, eternally blissful,\nwithout hindrance or obstruction,\ngreatly penetrating and perfectly complete.\n\nAnd a verse says:\nAt this time,\nwith luminous great wisdom,\nI expound the subtle and wondrous,\nrevealing it to all beings.\nHaving heard these words,\nmay they be steadfast,\npracticing tirelessly,\nwith pure and true hearts.\nJoyful and without regret,\nwithout fear,\nneither inward nor outward,\nneither anger nor hatred.\nAt such a time,\nthere is no inversion.\nAll natures and characteristics\nare unobstructed and at ease.\n\n*Numinous Talisman of the Scripture of the Great One*\n*End of the Scripture of the Great One of the Jade-Pure Realm*\n\n*The Wondrous Grove Scripture of the Jade-Pure Realm, Chapter Four*\n\nThe great Dharma-seas are boundless and infinite, pervading the Dharma-realm without end. The roots of all dharmas and their meritorious virtues are none other than the limitless wisdom of the Heavenly Honored One—truly, this cause cannot be fathomed by the wise or the sagely.\n\nThose who attain this Dharma encounter no hindrance, no wavering, no fear. Within a single Dharma, myriad scriptures arise under countless names; even expounded for kalpas unnumbered, its perfection cannot be exhausted. This Dharma cannot be grasped by wisdom, nor can it be known by sagacity. It is supremely wondrous, beyond the reach of hearing.\n\nAll ordinary beings cling to form, and in clinging to form, greed arises. Thus they are bound, unable to escape birth, aging, sickness, death, sorrow, lamentation, and the great suffering of all afflictions. For this reason, those who hear this Dharma are delivered from all calamities, and measureless beings together attain liberation.\n\nIf one, throughout a lifetime, accumulates heavy karmic obstructions and grave retribution yet never hears this Dharma, they are said to be enwrapped by demons and ghosts, unable to speak of it even at life’s end. But if they relinquish attachment, they break free from demonic entanglement.\n\nIt is like a guilty person in the world, shackled by officials; the innocent, however, are not bound. So too with all of you: those who cling are enwrapped by demons, while those who cling to nothing find demons and ghosts far removed. They abide in freedom, naturally detached from all forms and characteristics, liberated from the nets of dust. No afflictions remain, no obstructions persist—they attain mastery of the Dharma. Thus do all benefits arise.\n\nFrom the Dao comes the Dharma, without alternative teachings, without divergent thoughts. Desire naturally fades, and true quiescence is realized. All dharmas are subtly radiant, resplendent as priceless treasures, beyond measure.\n\nIf you see or hear of this, teach others in turn, employing skillful means so that all may encounter the profound and wondrous meaning of these true words. Let those who deeply believe receive and uphold them. Countless beings will arouse the unsurpassed mind of the Dao, and thereafter be revered by all gods, honored and venerated in ways beyond conception. Truly awakened and clear, they shatter all doubts, discern truth from falsehood, and enter the unfathomable mystery.\n\nAt that time, hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of true immortals and Dao-masters will be seated among them, upholding the true Dharma. They will have perfected boundless mastery of the six penetrations and great wisdom, turning the Wheel of Dharma to the realm of non-action—an unsurpassed, perfectly true, inconceivable, and inexpressible state.\n\nThose who attain the highest truth will perceive below them the boundless forms of all lands, guiding and receiving beings without the slightest pause. If one arouses the unsurpassed mind of the Dao, practicing myriad benefits and limitless wisdom, further upholding the fruits of the Dao—though their form is without appearance, its principle is most real; though its name is without substance, its function is most real. Those who know this Dharma enjoy long life. Their cultivation of merit is tireless, and at this time they constantly exhort all beings: do not harbor thoughts of resentment, do not indulge in desire, abandon all greed and attachment, all dreamlike delusions, all perverse views. Thus they attain the true and complete nature of reality.\n\nAnd a verse says:\nIf perverse views arise,\nit is because they do not believe in emptiness.\n\nFrom whence do all defilements and dusts arise?\nIf they were originally existent, how could there be non-action?\nIf they arise now, how do they come to be?\nAre they produced by conditions? Do they dwell as guests?\nDo they arise without cause? Or do they arise together?\nApart from all questions and answers, equality is non-arising.\nThus we know they are not existent—beyond thought and discussion.\n\n*Wondrous Grove Sutra, Numinous Talismans*\n*Wondrous Grove Sutra of the Jade Pure Realm* **Concludes**\n\n*Transformation Sutra of the Jade Pure Realm, Chapter Five*\nThe Dao’s model spreads and expands, opening the path to deliver all beings, enabling them to ascend the Dao’s shore. Therefore, within this Dharma, teachings are broadly proclaimed to instruct all beings in cultivating merit and virtue. If you act thus within this Dharma, you shall attain long life. Why is this so? By skillfully knowing causes and conditions and all expedient methods, you plant roots of goodness for all future beings, enabling them to understand that all dharmas are provisionally arisen to ferry beings across. Thus, all in the world diligently practice the three karmas and cultivate the fruits of blessed action. Then, ten immortals and ninety-six kinds of beings, together with their retinues, all come forth, assembling in the same Dao-field to accomplish merit and virtue.\n\nWithin this, if one tames the mind, then even externally, one constantly seeks merit with a single mind. When this Dharma was expounded, those who heard these matters rejoiced in their hearts. Each turned to the other, their voices choked with emotion, saying: “Such guidance has never been before—hard to encounter indeed!” At that time, immeasurable perfected supreme sages, transcendent great spirits, boundless perfected ones, and limitless holy assemblies—extending throughout the ten directions and the great encompassing Dharma-realm—such multitudes could not all be recorded. By virtue of past conditions, they now met in assembly, all seated together. Each reflected inwardly, contemplating the sutra’s Dharma, seeking the Dharma-body, relinquishing what is hard to relinquish. Again, through sound they chanted the sagely virtues, offering incense and flowers in praise of all practices, all perfectly fulfilling their intentions as offerings to the supreme venerable ones. At that moment, all entered fragrant purity, attaining unobstructed liberation, gaining the inconceivable, obtaining good karmic retribution, constantly abiding in the Dharma-wheel, entering the stage of non-retrogression, and ever dwelling in the Dharma-realm.\n\nHaving received these matters, their minds, upon hearing the Dharma, understood suffering, emptiness, impermanence, and non-self; and the constant, bliss, self, and purity. Having heard the Dharma, each led their retinues back to their original lands. Within this assembly, some attained liberation, realizing the wondrous principle, grasping the root of the Dharma, the twelve links of dependent origination, and discerning the three characteristics. As they saw the Dharma being expounded, they attained the Dao and its fruits, causes and conditions, boundless wondrous penetrations, wheeling spirits into samādhi, and expounding the wisdom of the untainted. With skillful faith in expedient means, they called this great compassion, entering the samādhi of emptiness and quiescence—beyond thought and discussion.\n\nWithin this assembly, some were able to master rare Dharma, elucidating the essentials of liberation amidst the assembly—most difficult to attain, most difficult to attain, the profound meaning. Each in the great assembly was courageous and exuberant, rejoicing and leaping with joy, praising without limit, all extolling the karmic retribution. At this time, they reverently listened to the venerable one, the supreme Dharma most excellent, awakening to what was yet to be awakened. Never before had they seen such majestic conduct in great compassion and great mercy, all equal in demeanor. They aroused understanding of what was unknown, along with its methods and remedies. Such rare and hard-won fruits—immediately, they and their retinues should relinquish what is hard to relinquish, exhorting all others to together arouse this unsurpassed, unattainable mind, lest regretful thoughts arise. All equally, at that moment, adorned vast seats with a hundred treasures of every kind.\n\nOnce the adornments were complete, the assembly bowed their heads in reverence, inquiring and prostrating, gazing upon the compassionate countenance. Each lamented their past lives’ misfortune, now having heard this teaching. Extolling the great compassion, they widely proclaimed it, and spoke this verse:\n\nSupreme Perfected, limitless virtue’s culmination,\nQuiescent realm, most exalted and wondrous,\nWithin the limitless, the honored one—\nI attained immortality through the Dao.\nSupreme Great Dao, without past or present,\nWithout going or coming, without thought or conception,\nConstantly with right teaching, instructing all in the world,\nAll attain good fruits, the greatest benefit,\nWithout hatred or attachment, together receiving wondrous power.\n\n*Transformation Sutra, Numinous Talismans*\n*Transformation Sutra of the Jade Pure Realm* **Concludes**\n\n*The Jade Pure Realm Immortals’ Sutra*\n*Chapter Six: The Wondrous Fruit of Jade Perfection, Rare and Majestic*\n\nRare indeed is this Dharma—heaven among heavens, yet even the heavens cannot contain it. Within the Three Realms and throughout the world, how could such a thing exist? How could it be conceived? I am unworthy of its excellence.\n\nThen all the perfected great sages, the boundless divine spirits, and the assembly of holy beings spoke: \"We and our retinues have come from afar. If even the Divine Lord deigns to reveal these secret and essential words, it is like the sun and moon whose light knows no concealment. We, with our retinues, take refuge and bow at your feet. We only pray that you, in your compassion, accept our shared resolve to follow and uphold your teachings. Should we fail in this, our hearts and vows shall ever remain reverent.\"\n\nAt that moment, their hearts again sighed in awe, humbled before such honor. The essential words they had received could never be fully expounded, nor could they be grasped even by the vastness of empty space—most difficult, most difficult. Yet in this difficulty, by the grace of the great assembly, they were called to expound the teaching. They thought to themselves, \"I dare not remain silent. If I do not proclaim these words, future generations will not attain good fruit; without good fruit, they will not cultivate the field of merit. If I do not reveal the words entrusted to me—this profound and secret Dharma—disobeying the command of the exalted ones, then at this very moment I shall witness their majesty: the celestial spirits in attendance, the divine dragons bearing their chariots, the hundred thousand kinds of arts and harmonies, all arising at once.\"\n\nThen the foremost seat began to recite the various Dharma teachings, exclaiming: \"Profound is the Dao, most subtle and empty, vast and boundless as the abyss. Those who do not believe are like the heavens in drought—no flowers or fruits arise, nor any beings of water or land, all wither and fade, devoid of moisture, unable to grow. All herbs lose their potency. So too are those who lack faith: they wither of their own accord, without blame from others.\n\n\"Yet if one initially holds faith but does not firmly establish it, it is like spring blossoms when they first open: swarms of bees arrive, drawn by their color, fragrance, and delicate sweetness, never sated. But when the blossoms fall, the bees depart. So too are those whose faith is not steadfast.\n\n\"Among this assembly, O good retinues, you have heard this Mahāyāna sutra, an immeasurable and inconceivable gathering of virtues. That you now follow the ways of the world and speak thus is most rare. Excellent! In the ages to come, may this sutra spread widely, showering the great Dharma rain to fill every place, complete and unobstructed, bringing benefit and peace to all beings.\n\n\"It is like gold hidden in sand: only after refining away the impurities and smelting it does it become true gold, priceless in value. Or like a merchant possessing a jewel beyond price who takes it to market to sell. A fool sees it and asks the owner, ‘What is the price of this jewel?’ The owner replies, ‘Its value is hundreds of millions.’ Hearing this, the fool scolds, ‘What is this thing? You deceive me—this is no jewel!’ They say to one another, ‘This is not real treasure.’ So too are those who do not believe in the Dharma.\n\n\"O good assembly, you are like those fools who do not recognize true treasure. So too are those among you who, though they hear this Dharma, lack true faith—like one who recognizes a treasure but has no means to acquire it. Yet if one encourages others to cultivate good deeds tirelessly, true faith will become clear.\"\n\nAnd they spoke this verse:\n\nThe great Dharma is boundless, unborn and undying,\nSubduing demonic obstructions, revealing the essential truth,\nCrushing all external paths.\nBy the power of good fruit, one attains freedom.\nThe supreme Dao is profound and mysterious,\nIts name and essence deeply wondrous,\nNot to be sought in fixed forms,\nIts divine function beyond thought,\nWithout fixed appearance,\nWithout hindrance or affliction.\nThere are skilled physicians\nWho relieve suffering and bring natural peace.\n\n*Immortals’ Sutra, Numinous Talismans*\n*The Jade Pure Realm Immortals’ Sutra* **Concludes**\n\n*The Jade Pure Realm’s Thirty-Six Venerable Scriptures, Volume III*\n*The Yellow Grove Sutra, The Sutra of Supreme Perfection, The Daoist Teachings Sutra, The Supreme Refinement Sutra, The Sutra of Supreme Wondrous Virtue, and the Daode Jing—six scriptures in one scroll*\n*The Yellow Grove Sutra of the Jade Pure Realm* **Chapter Seven**\n\nThe true teaching is vast and boundless, without limit or measure. Both humans and heavenly beings take refuge in it without end. In all present and future ages, it equally bestows the inherent true nature. If in past lives one has not yet heard the Dharma, now all may naturally return to the teaching, free from obstruction.\n\nShould one leave the household life to follow the Dao, knowing faith and devotion, thereby nurturing growth—once the body is thus nurtured, yet the nature of the Dharma remains unrecognized, one may indulge in frivolous speech, flattery, and deceit, forcibly seeking fame and honor, hoping for others’ reverence. Yet what is gained? How can one benefit others? Though one may claim that leaving the household life brings clarity to the true nature, one remains deluded, like a blind man who sees nothing, leading others astray, deepening confusion without awareness.\n\nIf one practices generosity, it is met with forced praise, all born of greed and devoid of true benefit. In every thought, affliction arises without respite. As the saying goes: \"The Dao speaks with a single voice,\" yet each being, each assembly, is complete in itself, each attaining liberation. All praise it, yet fail to awaken to their own nature.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy then addressed the assembly: \"When I expound the Dharma, I first enable all to illuminate their original nature, then instruct them to uphold it as I have taught. For this reason, all Dharmas become luminous, and in turn, one teaches others.\"\n\nThose beings who receive this teaching are like children finding their parents. Thus, in all praise of this wondrous Dharma, virtue increases like the waters of the great ocean, endlessly circulating. Upon hearing these words, the great assembly rejoiced. Such rare and wondrous causes and conditions moved all retinues who heard the Dharma to exclaim its rarity. Even those who had not heard or understood before now grasped it fully, gaining immeasurable benefit. From this resolve, all attained true perfection.\n\nThe immortal youths and attendants, with hundreds of thousands of musicians, offered myriad fragrant flowers and received their karmic rewards, all entering the fruit of the great teaching, the unconditioned. \"You, the present assembly and those of future ages, must wholly abandon evil deeds and practice the true Dharma, shunning evil and embracing goodness, renouncing worldly pleasures to seek the Dao—these are my true disciples. Such right conduct is truly inconceivable. Those who are impure are transformed to purity, upholding my Dharma. If still impure, they are made pure. Thus it is, thus it is.\n\nIf one possesses true wisdom and the true wondrous treasure, it is no falsehood. Welcome, disciples of the profound and wondrous Dharma! Through the convergence of causes and conditions, thought by thought, one transcends the ordinary to enter sageliness, leaving the coarse for the sublime, shedding one body to receive another, becoming a true companion of immortals. The sixth and seventh stages are likewise; attaining true perfection and the Dao is likewise.\n\nShould beings be afflicted by demons, their form and spirit parted, long bound to the gates of yin, without liberation—such matters are truly terrifying. Those who contemplate the Dao and leave the household life, escaping the dust and defilements as I have taught—if they also practice thus, they find joy in this life, escape the cycle of rebirth, avoid perverse views, eliminate all attachments, constantly uphold the true teaching without pause, ever as one who hungers and thirsts seeks food and drink.\"\n\nAnd they spoke this verse:\n\nThe wondrous cause of purity pervades all.\nThose who have not aroused the mind are made to arouse it.\nThose who lack faith are also guided toward it.\nGreat waves of goodness arise, each advancing with diligence.\nThose who skillfully expound the Dharma are like skilled physicians.\nWith wondrous medicine, they treat the blind,\nEnabling them to see the sun and moon—\nThis is the great scripture.\nIt opens the eye of wisdom, allowing one to abide in peace.\n\n*Talismans of the Yellow Grove Sutra*\n*The Yellow Grove Sutra of the Jade Pure Realm* **Concludes**\n\n*The Jade Pure Realm Scripture, Volume of the Thirty-Six Venerable Scriptures*\n*The Yellow Grove Sutra*\n*The Scripture of Supreme Perfection*\n*The Daoist Scriptures*\n*The Scripture of Supreme Refinement*\n*The Scripture of Supreme Wondrous Virtue*\n*The Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*\n*(The above six scriptures share one scroll)*\n\n*The Scripture of Supreme Perfection of the Jade Pure Realm* **Chapter Eight: The Wondrous and Pure**\n\nNaturally free from stray thoughts, supreme and boundless, pervading all without limit, all heavenly and human beings revere and hold fast to its teachings, cherishing them as precious treasures, honoring them as their own bodies, loving them as their own children, never forgetting for a moment. Thus, you shall swiftly attain awakening, gain the supreme power, abide in immovable constancy, transcend all bounds, and accomplish the transmission—becoming the guiding masters of those who cultivate the Dao and tread the path of immortality.\n\nWhen they expound the Dharma, none fail to bow in reverence;\nWhen they engage in debate, none fail to bow in reverence.\n\nThose who come to hear the teaching all attain understanding. The three realms and empty space are but provisional names. The sages, possessed of such majestic virtue and power, practice the wondrous Dharma, revealing to all beings these profound matters. Yet the ignorant and base, lacking strength, cannot fathom such truths and thus remain deluded, unable to enter.\n\nTherefore, the sages employ the gates of wisdom and skillful means, guiding all beings to perfect goodness and ascend to the supreme realm. Through steadfast teaching and transformation, they may escape the paths of suffering. Moreover, the five aggregates are without substance, and the three paths bear much suffering. Thoughts arise and perish in an instant; all dharmas are impermanent.\n\nThose who gather here, unwavering and unshaken, shall attain the blessed fruition—this is called the cause of supreme joy. Ever practicing purity, unobstructed and free, they receive the good reward. You, within this assembly, must weigh the lightness and heaviness of merit and its benefits, and further awaken to the truth.\n\nIf Daoist priests or nuns accumulate merit beyond conception, with thirty-six thousand true Dharma companions—all known to the multitude—cultivating great wisdom and perfecting their practice, the majestic power of the Great Dao becomes their fortress of Dharma protection. Upholding the true teaching, their fame spreads in the ten directions, and all people seek their counsel. They uphold and propagate the Three Treasures, ensuring their continuity, subduing demonic obstacles, and restraining external paths. Through purity, they forever sever the bonds of desire, their minds constantly abiding in unobstructed liberation.\n\nIn every thought, they uphold the totality, their eloquence unbroken. They perfect giving, uphold precepts, endure humiliation, and cultivate concentrated thought. Subtle wisdom and the power of skillful means are all fully possessed. Whether hidden or revealed, they dwell in empty space, their great wisdom attaining the patience of non-arising. Their names are recorded as those who have attained the Dao, entered the stage of non-retreat, and entered the practice of purity.\n\nIn brief, even if the Great Dao were expounded for five hundred kalpas, preaching the Dharma day and night without cease, the meaning could never be exhausted. You must know that from this point onward, for hundreds of thousands of kalpas, if one cultivates and reaches the realm of non-action—whether formless or with form—wisdom enters samadhi, and the patience of non-arising is not stirred. From the highest to the lowest, all bow in reverence, bow in reverence. The thirty-two marks are clearly perceived, the meaning of the Dao is realized, and spiritual wisdom is boundless, like empty space, immeasurable.\n\nFurthermore, in times past, the perfected ones sought the true teaching of the Dao, pitying sentient beings as a mother loves her child. The Dao is most profound and distant, not of this present day. If one can diligently uphold it, never forgetting for a moment, and spontaneously declare, \"Excellent! Excellent!\"—this is called skillful means. The revered deities of the ten directions, moved by this mind, bestow the power of the wondrous Dharma. At that very moment, the five paths become open, demonic forces retreat into hiding, and all then clarify their true vows, each attaining accomplishment.\n\nAnd they spoke this verse:\n\nWhat I now behold is the true Dharma.\nIts great fruition is beyond compare.\nAs one in darkness finds a great lamp,\nAll are illumined by this light.\nThe body attains peace, free from affliction.\nThrough this cause and condition, all is fulfilled.\nExcellent is the wondrous Dharma, truly profound.\nBy this meaning, the fruit is perfected.\n\n*Talismans of the Scripture of Supreme Perfection*\n*The Scripture of Supreme Perfection of the Jade Pure Realm* **Concludes**\n\n*The Lower Scroll of the Jade Pure Realm from the Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the Most High*\n*The Yellow Grove Scripture, The Scripture of Supreme Perfection, The Daoist Scripture, The Scripture of Supreme Refinement, The Scripture of Supreme Wondrous Virtue, and the Dao De Jing—six scriptures in one scroll*\n*The Daoist Scripture of the Jade Pure Realm* **Chapter Nine**\n\nHearing that the supreme Dao is wordless, wondrously concealed within the mystery of mysteries, one inquired, saying:\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy then addressed the assembly of celestial immortals, boundless and infinite perfected great spirits, gathered in the wondrous and singular court to expound the teachings. \"You all seek the Dao, yet claim to have heard its coarse and subtle aspects in abundance. Now that you raise this question, it is the fruit of hearing—yet if you merely arouse this mind to seek the supreme Dao, it shall never be attained.\n\nJust as the mighty ghost-spirits of the five paths, though born and transformed alongside heaven and earth through the kalpas, entangle themselves in the web of doubt, seeking libation priests to dwell forever in the earthly realm, they cannot heed the precepts and thus lose the root of the Dao.\n\nIf your minds truly desire to hear my true teaching, you must at this moment arouse the mind of supreme, inconceivable wisdom—only then may you hear it. Now that you seek the Dao, having once heard it—how rare! How rare!\n\nThe Dao is not sought within form, nor is it sought beyond form. It is not sought by clinging to existence, nor by clinging to non-existence. For the sake of all beings, it provisionally manifests in various dharmas, following what is established and forcibly assigning names. Yet once a name is obtained, in truth it departs from that name.\n\nThe supreme, perfectly true [Dao]—merely hearing its name—brings immeasurable virtue, beyond conception. How much more so for those who receive and uphold it! Though it has no form or appearance, dim and obscure, within it lies the utmost essence, the unobstructed supreme Dharma. The true nature remains unmoved; its power is like the sea, vast and boundless. It subdues afflictions and adversities, restrains external paths, and is most difficult to attain. Its responsive transformations are infinite, beyond conception.\n\nThis Dao is profoundly mysterious—such words speak of rare matters. Now that I expound these dharma-aspects, I accept your request. You must believe and contemplate, without thoughts of retreat, without doubts, without fear, without trusting other notions, without saying it is powerless, without saying it is too difficult. Simply maintain a straightforward mind and right mindfulness, plant the roots of goodness, and naturally you will comprehend the Dharma and enter the source of the Dao. Always abide in singularity; if there is nothing to attain, do not generate dharma-endurance. Diligently cultivate wisdom, constantly exhort all beings, universally enabling them to attain the Dao without obstruction from birth. Do not give rise to jealousy, but offer a single mind, teaching equally. The supreme cause and condition are truly inconceivable, without end.\n\nExpound broadly on cause and condition without negligence, constantly making the sound of the Dharma, praising and chanting, so that all beings together generate the aspiration to turn toward it. Arouse the supreme, perfectly true, unattainable mind, accomplish great perfection, cultivate the true teaching, and universally deliver the boundless.\n\nEach wields the inconceivable power of great wisdom and spiritual penetrations. At this moment, receive the Dharma and attain the good karmic conditions of deliverance. Thus it is, thus it is.\n\nIf there are beings who, even briefly in kalpa after kalpa, hear the Dharma, it is likewise without limit or boundary—all are seeds. Yet if one fears the seeds and does not plant them oneself, it will be difficult to bear fruit. All of you are most rare and precious, able to follow and turn with it, never retreating from the wheel, all perfectly complete.\n\nKnowing how to plant the roots of goodness, all the celestial assembly attain fearlessness, virtue, and wisdom. Cultivating their minds, their forms are adorned with excellent marks, perfectly complete and foremost. First attaining the good fruit, they abandon all fine reputations and lofty renown in the world, their aspirations high and far-reaching, without further practice.\"\n\nAnd they spoke this verse:\n\nBy this good Dao,\nIt is shown to the world.\nLike heavenly rain,\nIt moistens and nurtures growth.\nAll the multitudes\nAttain fruition.\nHunger and famine are wholly dispelled,\nAbundantly receiving joy.\nThe divine treasure of the honored ones,\nImmeasurable wisdom—\nAll evils are forever extinguished,\nMyriad deviations do not intrude.\nSpiritual illumination reaches far,\nAttaining its profound mystery.\nTruly unmoving,\nGaining fearless power.\n\n*Talismans of the Daoist Scripture*\n*The Daoist Scripture of the Jade Pure Realm* **Concludes**\n\n*The Lower Scroll of the Jade Pure Realm from the Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the Most High*\n*The Yellow Grove Scripture, The Scripture of Supreme Perfection, The Daoist Scripture, The Scripture of Supreme Refinement, The Scripture of Supreme Wondrous Virtue, and the Dao De Jing—six scriptures in one scroll*\n*The Scripture of Supreme Refinement of the Jade Pure Realm* **Chapter Ten**\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"In this assembly, the immeasurable assembly of sagely beings has gathered—all the celestial perfected ones, the boundless and infinite perfected great spirits. All dharmas are equal and unequal; beings are likewise equal and unequal. There are moreover immeasurable, inconceivable [realms].\n\nI constantly observe the heavens and the gates of the evil destinies, where six palaces govern transgressions and blessings:\n\n1. The Palace of Zhou Jue Yin,\n2. The Palace of Tai Sha Liang Shi Zong,\n3. The Palace of Ming Chen Nai Fan Wu Cheng,\n4. The Palace of Tian Zhao Zui Qi,\n5. The Palace of Zong Ling Qi Fei,\n6. The Palace of Gan Si Lian Wan Lü.\n\nThere are also twenty-four hells:\n\n1. The Hell of Boiling Cauldrons,\n2. The Hell of Copper Pillars,\n3. The Hell of Iron Plows Tilling Tongues,\n4. The Hell of Knife Mountains and Sword Trees,\n5. The Hell of Grinding Mortars,\n6. The Hell of Poisonous Snakes Devouring Hearts,\n7. The Hell of Molten Copper Pouring into Mouths,\n8. The Hell of Furnace Coals,\n9. The Hell of Iron Wheels,\n10. The Hell of Transporting Stones to Build Mountains,\n11. The Hell of Iron Beds,\n12. The Hell of Sword Forests,\n13.

The Hell of Iron Pellets,\n19. The Hell of Swallowing Fire and Eating Coals,\n20. The Hell of Grinding, Crushing, and Pounding,\n21. The Hell of Iron Juice,\n22. The Hell of Tongue Extraction,\n23. The Hell of Iron Chains,\n24. The Hell of Sawing Apart.\"\n\nAdditionally, there are Five Gates of Suffering, encircling twenty-four hells:\n\n1. The Gate of Suffering from Sensory Attachments Disturbing the Mind,\n2. The Gate of Suffering from Craving Entangling the Spirit,\n3. The Gate of Suffering from Greed Burdening the Body,\n4. The Gate of Suffering from Vanity Exhausting the Essence,\n5. The Gate of Suffering from Corporeal Bonds Oppressing the Soul.\n\nThe Three Paths—Upper Corpse, Middle Corpse, and Lower Corpse—along with the Five Sufferings, form the Eight Difficulties’ Gates.\n\nFurthermore, the Nine Dark Hells and Nine Prisons are distributed across the four directions:\n- In the East, the Thunder Hell of the Wind,\n- In the South, the Obscuring Fire Hell,\n- In the West, the Diamond Hell,\n- In the North, the Frigid Abyss Hell,\n- In the Center, the Universal Torment Hell,\n- In the Southeast, the Bronze Pillar Hell,\n- In the Southwest, the Dismemberment Hell,\n- In the Northwest, the Fire Chariot Hell,\n- In the Northeast, the Cauldron of Boiling Liquid Hell.\n\nCountless men and women fall into these realms, enduring unbearable torments without respite, day or night.\n\nThe Perfected One of the Great Ultimate bowed in reverence and prostrated, addressing the Heavenly Worthy. The Heavenly Worthy declared: \"These sinners, having disbelieved in the Three Treasures and devoted themselves solely to transgression, have thus fallen here without hope of escape. I now expound for you the Orthodox Teachings and the Supreme Jade Canon, that all beings may attain liberation.\"\n\nThe Lord of Jade Void then pledged his utmost sincerity, requesting the extraction of the precepts and scriptures from the Jade Canon—all inscribed in yellow on blue scrolls, containing essential doctrines and the talismans of salvation from suffering. He addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: \"Your servant has heard these teachings and received this Dharma, forever freed from the sufferings of hell. Holding fast to the Jade Covenant, I shall ascend through the Golden Gate without hindrance.\"\n\nWithin the assembly, a single lamp’s light was divided among the Eight Latter Hells, dispelling the darkness of the Nine Prisons. All who heard these essential teachings and reverently listened to the Dharma’s sound were filled with joy.\n\nAnd he spoke in verse, saying:\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared:\nAll these realms of suffering\nAre entered by oneself.\nIf one attains to hearing the Dharma,\nThis too is most fortunate.\nYou now proclaim it—\nHold fast and firm,\nAdvance with courage and vigor.\nAgain, with radiant light\nAnd the pure Dharma-water,\nShatter all obstacles,\nBreak open the Eight Hells,\nAnd the Five Sufferings within—\nAll shall naturally dissolve.\nThe iron city of ten thousand leagues\nCollapses like sand.\n\nRefining the Scripture of Numinous Talismans in the Jade Clarity Realm\n\nThus concludes *The Scripture of Supreme Virtue in the Jade Clarity Realm*, thirty-sixth among the *Thirty-Six Venerable Scriptures of the Jade Clarity Realm*.\n\n*The Yellow Grove Scripture, The Scripture of Supreme Perfection, The Daoist Scriptures, The Scripture of Supreme Refinement, The Scripture of Supreme and Wondrous Virtue,* and *The Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*—these six scriptures form a single scroll.\n\n*The Scripture of Supreme and Wondrous Virtue in the Jade Clarity Realm*, Chapter Eleven\n\nThe Dao spoke: Excellent, excellent!\nIf within this assembly there are boundless Heavenly Perfected Ones, Great Sages, and Most Perfect Great Spirits—\nThe Flying Heavenly Lords of East, West, South, and North—all bow their heads,\nEach with their own karmic conditions of Dharma, beyond full expression.\nThe four directions abound with great wisdom,\nEnabling these boundless, measureless beings.\nIf any man or woman awakens a virtuous mind,\nGenerates great wisdom,\nFirst tames and subdues their mind,\nAnd cultivates the essential practices—\nSuch essential practices\nConvey one into the Dharma-wheel,\nWhere the Flying Heavenly Ones revolve.\nThe true canon of the Great Treasury,\nOver five thousand characters,\nEighteen thousand chapters,\nAll return to the Treasure Repository.\nThe Eight Flying Heavenly Spirits exert their power in rotation,\nThe four golden dragons spin the pillar and the Dipper’s pearl,\nPearls hang from eight sides,\nThirty-two pavilions,\nThirty-two Heavenly Emperors encircle the eight directions,\nFive-colored auspicious clouds spread across the earth and emerge,\nRadiant light illumines all—\nWithin the treasury’s heart is inscribed *The Scripture of the Numinous Chapters on Birth from the Nine Heavens*,\nWhile the remaining scriptures return to the pavilions.\nThe wheel turns thrice,\nEnabling all beings to perceive their true nature,\nTo receive admonitions within the Dharma-wheel,\nTo attain rebirth,\nTo return and be born among humans,\nTo clearly perceive all dharmas,\nWithout doubt,\nAnd to plant manifold roots of goodness.\nCultivating this essential Way,\nBoundless wisdom,\nImmeasurable teachings—\nAll are contained within,\nPracticed for ten thousand generations\nWithout hindrance.\nSuch merit and virtue\nAre without end,\nTruly beyond thought or discussion.\nAmong this assembly, those who comprehend this principle—\nAll who see and hear—\nShall have their wishes fulfilled.\nThose who have not yet heard this essential Dharma\nShould also awaken the mind and take refuge,\nFollowing the turning of the Dharma-wheel,\nBriefly listening to the true sound,\nAnd thus attain liberation.\nCultivate this essential Way,\nNever waver or regret,\nAdvance diligently in recitation,\nTo hear the profound and wondrous Way of the Supreme Perfected,\nAnd again, with radiant light,\nSave and deliver all beings,\nFreeing them from the realms of suffering,\nCreating great benefit,\nEmploying manifold expedient means.\nAdvance in the practice of deeds,\nSo that gods and humans take refuge.\nFor hundreds of thousands of kalpas—\nThose already born, to be born, or yet unborn—\nIf they awaken a virtuous thought,\nThey must revere and uphold it,\nBe guided into the Dharma-gate,\nSo that in this life, or in lives to come,\nThey may gradually hear the Dharma,\nWithout demonic obstacles,\nAnd also encounter this Dharma.\nIf there are those who have already heard this teaching within the Dharma\nAnd yet do not practice diligently from beginning to end—\nThough they initially attain the Way,\nLater they waver and regret,\nClinging to worldly entanglements—\nThey shall not attain liberation.\nYou must rely on my words,\nListen and receive,\nBroadly open the Dharma-gate,\nCultivate your original practice,\nAnd also enable those who have not awakened to awaken,\nThose who have not heard to hear,\nEstablishing great merit and virtue.\nAll practices perfected,\nCross over into good fruition,\nPerceive the great causal conditions,\nUniversally enter the fruit of non-action,\nFurther enter refinement and deliverance,\nTo attain the perfection of the Dao,\nAnd enter the fruit of purity.\nAll that is done\nShall be supremely good.\nThus, all these qualities,\nAll powers of merit and virtue,\nBoundless and immeasurable,\nAre all fully possessed in their subtlest aspects.\nIf the sprouts of Dharma\nAre not well cultivated,\nOne loses the root of the Dharma\nAnd cannot attain long life.\nIf one can accumulate practice,\nMerit and virtue shall be without limit.\nAt the time I expound the Dharma,\nThere is neither existence nor non-existence.\nFor this reason,\nAll dharmas respond accordingly,\nWithout self or other,\nAll that is seen and heard is perfected.\nThrough this wondrous power,\nGreat and beyond thought or discussion.\n\nAnd he spoke in verse, saying:\n\nTo know the ancient beginning\nIs called the record of the Dao.\nTo enable the unenlightened to awaken\nIs the seed of the Dao.\nWhy is this so?\nThe Heavenly Worthy’s wisdom\nCannot be measured or exhausted,\nThe meaning of the subtle and wondrous\nIs profound and distant, difficult to discern—\nForcibly described in its aspects.\nThe practice of wisdom is hard to fathom,\nYet all dharmas should be perceived.\nWhy then do these beings\nFail to attain?\nClinging and ignorant,\nIf enlightened, all awaken.\n\nThe Numinous Talismans of *The Scripture of Supreme and Wondrous Virtue*\n\nThus concludes *The Scripture of Supreme and Wondrous Virtue in the Jade Clarity Realm*, thirty-sixth among the *Thirty-Six Venerable Scriptures of the Jade Clarity Realm*.\n\n*The Yellow Grove Scripture, The Scripture of Supreme Perfection, The Daoist Scriptures, The Scripture of Supreme Refinement, The Scripture of Supreme and Wondrous Virtue,* and *The Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*—these six scriptures form a single scroll.\n\n*The Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue in the Jade Clarity Realm*, Chapter Twelve\n\nI declare that all things are subtle and wondrous.\nYou, all Perfected Ones, possess boundless wisdom\nIn the past, future, and present lives,\nYet do not comprehend it.\nEight paths intersect in confusion,\nManifold karmic conditions—none are true mindfulness.\nSome, though of the highest grade,\nDo not perceive their true nature,\nHave not fully entered the Great Vehicle,\nStill cling to incense and flowers,\nDo not generate virtue or power,\nDo not awaken wisdom,\nDo not practice good faith—\nThey too may fall.\nHow much more those who are deluded and perverse,\nForever losing their causal conditions,\nNever encountering the Three Treasures,\nNever hearing the essential Dharma,\nNever hearing the Dharma-drum,\nNever hearing the secret treasury?\nSuch people, even if they hear me expound the Dharma,\nCannot discern it,\nNor can they distinguish their own actions,\nNor the characteristics of dharmas.\nDevoid of self-nature,\nDevoid of other-nature.\nIf one can hear and comprehend this teaching,\nThen in all dharmas one attains perfection,\nReaching non-arising and non-ceasing,\nAnd again perfects all dharmas,\nDeparting from all dharma-characteristics,\nAll speech,\nAnd all that is spoken of—\nNeither speaking nor silent,\nThis is the illumination of the essential Dharma.\n\nTo tread the Great Dao, do not point to narrow paths;\nDo not liken the waters of the vast sea to petty streams,\nNor compare the sun’s radiance to mere flickering light.\n\nIn my exposition of the Dharma, there is no obstruction,\nAll is perfectly complete—truly beyond thought,\nTruly beyond discourse.\nPervading the three-thousandfold great-thousand worlds,\nEncompassing all dharma-realms,\nAs if seen within the palm of one’s hand,\nWithout duality,\nWithout delusion,\nPure and unconditioned,\nWithout present or past,\nWithout end or beginning.\n\nI widely exhort all beings to seek the root of goodness,\nTo relinquish this body and life in pursuit of awakening,\nTo steadfastly cultivate the teachings—\nAll shall attain perfection,\nBringing vast and boundless benefit to all beings.\n\nAt this very moment, in future ages,\nThis teaching shall spread.\nThose who have never seen or heard,\nThose in distant lands,\nThe benighted and unenlightened,\nAll shall, through this present exposition,\nCome to understanding.\nHaving attained understanding,\nThey shall enter the unretreatable, unconditioned great endeavor,\nReach the realm of longevity,\nThe supreme and victorious cause—\nBeyond all comparison.\n\nThen, among the assembly, all bowed their heads in reverence,\nProstrating with limbs outstretched,\nOverjoyed and exultant,\nVoicing loud praises:\n“Such inconceivable merit,\nBoundless and immeasurable!\nWe have heard this teaching today—\nIn ten million kalpas, never has there been the like.\nA single word herein is limitless.”\n\nHaving heard this discourse,\nThe true ones gazed upon the golden countenance,\nBowed to receive the sacred precepts,\nAnd all attained understanding.\nIn but a moment,\nThey gained the inconceivable.\n\nThen, from the sky descended\nCountless, boundless deva-kings and holy multitudes,\nAll desiring to augment their virtue and power,\nTo perfect the wondrous, true, and tranquil.\nInnumerable great spirits and immortals\nBowed as one,\nTo the supreme, correct, and true,\nThe subtle and essential teaching—\nAll was of the Great Brahmā.\n\nThose who see or hear this\nShall all receive benefit—\nHow much more those who uphold and recite it,\nWho transmit the precepts,\nWho widely exhort beings to equally receive this wondrous Dharma,\nAttaining great perfection,\nFulfilling the dharma-nature,\nFree from the six desires,\nWith the three poisons extinguished,\nMind and consciousness purified,\nAchieving great, all-penetrating wisdom,\nAnd in turn teaching others.\n\nSuch merit knows no limit—\nThis true teaching is beyond full expression.\n\nAnd he spoke this verse:\n\nKnow this, all of you: stillness has two kinds.\nThe first is *stillness with presence*—I contemplate the subtle and refined,\nEver abiding in stillness and practice.\nThe second is *emptiness-stillness*—\nThoughts like the sea, ever abiding in pure conduct.\nOnly by preserving unity\nCan one reach the profound source,\nAttain ultimate stillness,\nAnd find refuge in the exhaustion of being.\nThrough this, one gains mastery over all dharmas,\nAnd may thus become inexhaustible.\nFor all sentient beings\nWere originally self-luminous.\n\n*The Scripture of Dao and Spirit-Talismans of the Jade Clarity Realm* concludes here.\n\n---\n\n*The Scripture of the Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the Highest*\n*The Scripture of the High Clarity Realm*\n*The Scripture of the Cavern Mystery*\n*The Scripture of Primordial Yang*\n*The Scripture of Primordial Chen*\n*The Scripture of the Great Kalpa*\n*The Scripture of Supreme Opening*\n*The Scripture of Inner Sound*\n(These six scriptures are contained in the same scroll.)\n\n*The Scripture of the Cavern Mystery of the High Clarity Realm* begins here.\n\nThe first chapter, *\"The Utmost Wondrous and Mysterious\"*—\nSupremely true, profoundly hidden, and difficult to fathom.\nThereupon, all the devas spoke in unison,\nBowing to the Heavenly Worthy,\nAnd entreated the revelation of the essential Dharma.\n\nAt that moment, from within the assembly,\nAll rejoiced,\nAnd boundless radiance\nAwakened every rank of beings.\n\nThen came the deva-princes of the Formless Realm,\nFrom their abodes:\nThe Heavenly Prince of the Luminous Court of the Cloud-Crossing Realm,\nThe Heavenly Prince of the Abyssal Cavern of Primordial Pervasion,\nThe Heavenly Prince of the Realm of Wondrous Flourishing Grace,\nThe Heavenly Prince of the Realm of Forbidden Joy and Elegance—\nSuch were the four deva-princes.\nHaving heard of this rare and wondrous sign,\nEach led their people,\nWise men and upright women,\nTo gather as one.\nThe four kinds of celestial beings—\nAscending Victory, Brahmā-Pervasion, Splendid Prosperity, and Eternal Harmony—\nAll declared:\nThrough such profound causes and conditions,\nOne attains the unobstructed realm of sublime abodes,\nAnd the truth of the Dao.\n\nThen came the deva-princes of the eighteen heavens of the Form Realm:\nThe Heavenly Prince of the Transcendent Conduct Realm,\nThe Heavenly Prince of the Veiled Brilliance Realm,\nThe Heavenly Prince of the Harmonious Yang Realm,\nThe Heavenly Prince of the Reverent Splendor Realm,\nThe Heavenly Prince of the Ancestral Drifting Realm,\nThe Heavenly Prince of the August Flute Realm,\nThe Heavenly Prince of the Hall of Radiance Realm,\nThe Heavenly Prince of the Solemn Tranquility Realm,\nThe Heavenly Prince of the Reverent Celebration Realm,\nThe Heavenly Prince of the Ultimate Jade Realm,\nThe Heavenly Prince of the August Cliff Realm,\nThe Heavenly Prince of the Ultimate Wind Realm,\nThe Heavenly Prince of the Filial Aura Realm,\nThe Heavenly Prince of the Venerable Weight Realm,\nThe Heavenly Prince of the River Origin Realm,\nThe Heavenly Prince of the Joyful Obscurity Realm,\nThe Heavenly Prince of the Cloud Vow Realm—\nSuch were these kings.\nTogether with their ministers, princes, and people,\nThey came before me,\nAnd I expounded for them,\nAccording to their time,\nThe true Dao and its supreme power.\n\nTheir realms revered this,\nPracticing the unobstructed Dharma,\nErecting great Dharma-banners,\nBeyond all thought or conception.\nHaving heard this wondrous matter,\nTheir hearts rejoiced,\nMarvelling at what had never been before.\nAttaining such excellent fruit,\nSo rare and precious,\nThey gained the condition of purity,\nForever free from sound and form,\nNo longer troubled by afflictions,\nTurning the wheel of no-retreat,\nForever beyond birth and death,\nAchieving great perfection.\nThis truth is subtle and wondrous,\nBeyond full expression.\n\nThen came the deva-princes of the six heavens of the Desire Realm,\nAll extolling such inconceivable merit,\nTruly difficult to encounter:\nThe Heavenly Prince of the August Layered Realm,\nThe Heavenly Prince of the Jade Perfection Realm,\nThe Heavenly Prince of the Youthful How Realm,\nThe Heavenly Prince of the Peaceful Nurturance Realm,\nThe Heavenly Prince of the Literary Elevation Realm,\nThe Heavenly Prince of the Māyā Realm—\nSuch were these deva-princes.\nTheir ministers, crown princes, and people,\nThough numerous,\nWere not yet complete,\nEnduring boundless suffering,\nWandering in birth and death,\nTorn by love and hate,\nSeparation and enmity,\nViolence and malice—\nBeyond all thought or conception.\n\nThose who turned their hearts sincerely\nTo where the Dao was taught,\nRegardless of distance,\nI now expounded for them the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination,\nEnabling all to turn toward it,\nTo be born together in the true realm,\nAnd to deliver all their realms,\nAccording to their conditions—high or low—\nGuiding them step by step to awakening.\nThus, their retinues immediately received the true fruit,\nAll attaining the stage of no-retreat,\nGaining peace and bliss.\nTheir ministers and officials,\nTogether with the people,\nAll attained the unobstructed Dharma,\nEntering the true and correct,\nAssembling at the gate of pure wisdom,\nArousing the supreme mind,\nAnd transcending to the bodhimanda of peace and bliss.\n\nI teach all dharmas,\nEver guiding and exhorting,\nSo that all in the world\nGradually enter the true teaching,\nAnd all attain the fruit of the Dao.\n\nAnd he spoke this verse:\n\nThis Dharma is radiant,\nThe most wondrous scripture.\nWhether in the present age\nOr in ages to come,\nIn every place—\nCities, towns, and villages,\nMountains, marshes, and empty spaces,\nOr royal palaces and dwellings—\nWherever this scripture spreads,\nI, with my great power and divine might,\nShall go to those places,\nFollowing and protecting.\nFor those who teach this Dharma,\nI shall ensure their fulfillment.\n\n*The Scripture of the Cavern Mystery and Spirit-Talismans*\n*The Scripture of the Cavern Mystery of the High Clarity Realm* concludes here.\n\nThe *Supreme Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the High Clarity Realm*\n*The Scripture of the Cavern Mystery*\n*The Scripture of Primordial Yang*\n*The Scripture of Primordial Celestial Cycles*\n*The Scripture of the Great Kalpa*\n*The Scripture of the Supreme Opening*\n*The Scripture of the Inner Sound*\n—The above six scriptures share a single scroll—\n\n*The Scripture of Primordial Yang of the High Clarity Realm*   Chapter Two\n\nAt that time, the sacred multitudes of the heavens, the great deities of the heavens, and the boundless perfected ones rejoiced in their hearts, having heard the Celestial Worthy expound thus at length for the great assembly, teaching the step-by-step cultivation that leads to perfect fulfillment. This creates immeasurable and boundless fields of vast merit, serving as the root of life for all beings. If one can skillfully harmonize the principles of nature and life, one will naturally attain harmony and well-being, preserving the integrity of the body. Adapting to the seasons and employing expedient means, diligently cultivating one’s practice, in such fields will sweet rain ever fall, nourishing year after year abundant harvests, free from harm. Such great benefit is inconceivable, universally delivering all beings, bringing about such fulfillment. Through this, one attains self-mastery, mighty vigor, and unrelenting progress.\n\nHaving heard the Dharma to its conclusion, they then aroused within this scripture a mind of purity, a mind of spontaneity, a mind of fearlessness, and a mind of compassion. Reverently engaging in cultivation, they again heard this teaching. Even the non-Buddhist paths of foreign lands, upon hearing and receiving the prophecy, were all likewise granted prophecy—the greatest of causes, yielding boundless fruit. Having attained such matters, their minds opened and their intentions arose, all becoming clear. Their bodies attained the vastness of heaven without limit, pervading the Dharma-realm without end. The thirty-two marks filled the empty space, and the eighty excellences brought benefit through every gate. Manifesting or concealing, appearing or vanishing, boundless and profoundly subtle, wondrous and unconditioned.\n\nOverwhelmed with joy beyond measure at such teachings, they declared this to be the good medicine, capable of rescuing all suffering and delivering beings through expedient means. Skillfully discerning the depth and shallowness of illnesses, applying remedies according to symptoms, one comes to know the waxing and waning of the four great elements. Constantly arousing great compassion, pitying all beings, one thus enables them to take refuge together, teaching all beings. Expounding the great wisdom, one desires that all beings deeply enter the Dharma-gate, hear the secret treasury, and immediately attain non-arising and non-ceasing. All in the world neither know nor see—boundless and immeasurable. Yet the faithful multitudes of the heavens can all know and see; those who awaken are called true persons. Those who know the correct awakening proceed directly to the supreme vehicle. If not of the world, what difference would there be? Yet it is also of the world, and also not of the world. As the saying goes, to speak of difference requires some approximation.\n\nThus, you should proclaim and practice the essential Dharma, creating great good causes for all future beings. You must constantly expound it—not only today or at this hour. The ultimate good Dharma should never be exhausted; the great wisdom of universal penetration can never be exhausted. How much less could those who expound it ever exhaust it? You should accept this in faith. I shall now explain to you, one by one, the profound roots of the Dao, so that you may attain liberation—the foremost cause.\n\nIf you possess the wisdom of universal penetration and great compassion, pitying all beings, you become a cause for the Dharma and a benefactor to the world. Excellent indeed, beyond all thought! First establishing this Dharma, universally rescuing all sentient beings, one observes how all beings are defiled by form, defiled by desire, unaware and unenlightened, bringing upon themselves such suffering. Moment by moment, they take this to be joy, engaging in false speech, divisive words, harsh scolding, greed, anger, ignorance, and perverse views. Though they hear this Dharma, they do not diligently practice, thus bringing such suffering upon themselves, forever without liberation. I teach all dharmas so that all may attain fulfillment.\n\nAnd he spoke this verse:\n\nHearing this Dharma now, make no distinctions.\nShould distinctions arise, you sink into evil destinies.\nWhether man or woman, all who give rise to faith and devotion,\nwho take refuge in body and life, become children of the Dao.\n\nYou have received these words—thus you must expound\nthis rare and precious Dharma,\nfor the sake of future generations,\nfor the good and benefit of Dharma-children,\nthat they may return to emptiness and stillness, to the source.\n\nBecome my disciples, serene and eternal.\n\n**The Primordial Yang Scripture of the Numinous Talisman**\n*End of the Upper Scripture of the Primordial Yang in the Upper Clarity Realm*\n\n*Six Scriptures in One Volume:*\n*The

Well, the Silver River,\nthe Purple Palace’s fields of destiny,\nauspicious and inauspicious omens,\nportents, and the true forms of obscure stars.\nRecite the scriptural texts,\nestablish the jiao

transformations of heaven and earth follow fixed destinies;\nthe cycles of yang and nine, six, and hundred-six bring calamity.\nWhen omens and portents manifest,\nthey serve as clear signs and proofs.\n\nNow, all people and their six relations receive their *qi* and nature from heaven and earth,\nborrowing their parents only for birth and nurture.\nIn truth, they are endowed by heaven and earth,\nwhich are their true father and mother.\nDisasters and blessings arise from the purity or turbidity of heaven and earth’s *qi*.\n\nAll who cultivate the supreme Dao and advance in wisdom,\nif they broadly exhort others to reverence and practice,\nshall understand the causes of fortune and misfortune—\nall rooted in the transformations of heaven and earth.\nWith diligent prayer and devotion to the supreme Dao,\neach arousing such lofty vows,\nupholding the Daoist canon,\nall shall return to the true teaching.\n\nWhen heaven and earth are obstructed,\ntheir great wrath gives rise to calamity:\ngrains fail to ripen,\npeople perish,\nweapons clash,\nplagues spread,\nthe sun, moon, and stars lose their proper courses.\nSuch is a year of heaven and earth’s great inauspiciousness,\nwhen sins and evils cannot be named.\n\nYet by heeding the most wondrous and perfect essential Dharma,\nall evils shall be utterly extinguished.\nYou know the profound mysteries of heaven and earth—\ntheir meanings are beyond full expression.\n\nGreat calamities and strange omens arise from heaven and earth’s great wrath;\nmoderate calamities and omens, from their moderate wrath;\nminor calamities and omens, from their minor wrath.\nThis is like human affairs:\ngreat matters call for great words,\nmoderate matters for moderate words,\nminor matters for minor words.\nNo word is empty,\nno sign is false,\nno deception is wrought.\n\nWhen great auspices appear,\nthey correspond to heaven and earth’s great joy;\nwhen moderate auspices appear,\nto their moderate joy;\nwhen minor auspices appear,\nto their minor joy.\n\nWhen no calamity or auspice appears,\nheaven and earth’s *qi* is concealed—\nno image, no form,\nno omen, no transformation.\nKnow then to return and revere the supreme realm of the Most High,\nclearly comprehending all Dharma’s hidden inner tones and jade verses,\nthat all good affinities may be fulfilled.\n\nThere are also great, moderate, and minor discourses of heaven and earth,\neach with its manifest signs.\nAmong the eleven luminaries, only the Purple *Qi* shows no image—\nthus it never gives rise to calamity.\nThe sun displays the Red Rooster,\nthe moon the White Hare.\nThe sun meets in spring the Azure Dragon,\nin summer the Vermilion Bird,\nin autumn the White Tiger,\nin winter the Dark Warrior.\nWithin the moon’s hare are the Green Cassia and the Mortar and Pestle,\nunchanging through the four seasons.\n\nThe Star Lord of Wood Virtue has the head of a hare, the body of a boar, and the tail of a tiger.\nThe Star Lord of Fire Virtue has the body of a horse and the tail of a snake.\nThe Star Lord of Metal Virtue has the head of a monkey and the body of a rooster.\nThe Star Lord of Water Virtue is a black ape holding brush, ink, and inkstone.\nThe Star Lord of Earth Virtue has the horns of a ram, the head of a dragon, the ears of a dog, and the body of an ox.\nThe Star Lord Rahu has the horns of a ram, the claws of a dog, the tail of an ox, and the body of a dragon.\nThe Star Lord Ketu is a tortoise.\nThe Star Lord Moon Comet is a snake.\n\nWhen these proper images appear,\nthey do not portend calamity.\nIf aberrations arise—\ndarkness, obscurity, lack of luster—\nand the sun, moon, Wood, Metal, Purple, and Water show no pattern,\nthey do not bring disaster.\nIf they deviate from their proper courses,\ntheir brightness is slightly diminished.\nWhen Fire deviates, it reddens and exposes its eye;\nwhen Earth deviates, it moves sluggishly;\nwhen Rahu, Ketu, and the Comet deviate,\nthey change forms according to the twelve palaces—\nthen they portend calamity.\nMeeting the Metal Star is auspicious.\nIf one follows the proper rites of exorcism, it shall be favorable.\n\nAnd he spoke this verse:\n\nThe rites of exorcism and transformation\nare the mechanisms of response.\nYou must know this:\nPurify body and mind,\ncultivate the supreme practice,\nfirst with reverence,\nthen with right faith,\nfulfilling the four virtues.\nOnly then is refuge complete,\nwhether man or woman.\nFollow the teachings without doubt,\ncomprehending the true source,\npenetrating the profound and obscure.\nFurther, believe and receive,\nand in turn deliver others.\n\nThe *Numinous Talisman of the Inner Tone Scripture*\n*Inner Tone Scripture of the Upper

adepts,\nall who see and hear—\nwithout limit,\npervading the empty sky,\nboundless and vast,\nsilently unfolding.\nAll beings receive its benefits.\n\nWhen people prosper,\nit is often because they embrace goodness;\nwhen they decline,\nit is often because they embrace evil.\nThose destined for fortune are easily guided;\nthose destined for misfortune are hard to enlighten.\n\nThe Way of Heaven ever aids the good;\nthe Great Dao establishes laws,\nthat those who seek may attain.\nThe Way of Heaven ever distances the wicked;\nthe Great Dao displays its majesty,\nrefusing to protect them.\n\nIf one can cultivate the supreme Dao,\nrevere the master,\nreceive the scriptures and Dharma,\nand return the refined *qi* to irrigate the field of the body—\ninscribing secret talismanic seals with cinnabar,\nswallowing them into the belly—\none shall see within the belly’s script,\ngreatly auspicious,\nand all evil spirits depart.\nThe five organs govern,\nserving as the foundation of the Dao,\nthe ancestors of the spirits.\nThe hundred joints, sinews, bones,\nthe four limbs and eight vessels—\nall unite with the true primordial *qi*.\n\nGates and doors, when entered and exited, scatter evil *qi* of their own accord; the true Dao flows freely, and inner and outer become luminously clear. Guarding this over time, the celestial physicians descend of themselves, and all ailments dissolve entirely, bestowing longevity.\n\nThe foolish, ignorant of the natural, discard wondrous methods; though they may have accumulated past goodness, it turns to misfortune. The wise regard it as a priceless treasure, revering and honoring it. This may be called the Way of eternal abiding.\n\nTo prize the natural alone, body and spirit both wondrous, form and appearance ever joyful—guard this spirit and *qi*, and nature and life are attained of themselves. Roaming freely in the fruition of the Dao, one ascends through the Golden Gate.\n\nIf one fails to grasp its secret essence and clings instead to strange thoughts, it becomes a fault, losing the natural, and the Way of long life cannot be attained.\n\nIf you now wish to cultivate as before, it is better first to nurture the mother, then cherish the infant. The five essences all ascend to the *Niwan* Palace, returning to the origin and restoring life. Thus one naturally preserves and guards, never again suffering loss.\n\nOnly then may one refine the practices of cultivation, entering and exiting the Flowery Chamber. The forest of existence flourishes in lush abundance, sheltering all beings—this is true quiescence, true samādhi, Great Perfection, Great Wisdom, the boundless and inexhaustible adornment of the Dharma-body, universally saving all, pervading the Dharma-realm, the four directions and four borders, myriad myriad leagues beyond.\n\nFar and near, many bear karmic entanglements; good and evil are evenly matched, and few awaken to liberation. Relying solely on the one mind, one reveres the true lineage, seeks the master, and yearns for the Dao, arriving of oneself before the Emperor.\n\nWith long-accumulated practice, one may transcend the mundane and enter sagehood, far removed from evil destinies, attaining purity and stillness.\n\nYou who come after have not yet entered the gate of the Dharma. If in the future you all plant seeds in this field of merit, the hundred grains will ripen year after year, untouched by drought or blight.\n\nAll the heavens assemble, boundless and immeasurable, filling the empty sky—hard to conceive, vast and perfect in blessings. Myriad sages and a thousand perfected ones join in unison to praise this excellent cause, benefiting all beings.\n\nThe divine immortals of all heavens gather at once, ever filled with joy, speaking thus: If a person of attainment remains steadfast in resolve, never regressing, without hindrance, then through all lives and kalpas of samsara, they shall encounter enlightened masters who impart the profound teachings. Such Dharma teachings are too vast to recount fully.\n\nAnd so a gāthā says:\nThe virtue of transformation is beyond all praise.\nYou of good wisdom, each uphold the teachings.\nAwaken to the true origin, revolving in the good Dao,\nWithout cease, pure and liberated.\nIn non-action, at ease, ever practicing right mindfulness—\nYou shall surely attain this.\nWhen engaging in these practices,\nLet your mind be spacious, casting off the four evils.\nPerform great merit, cultivate an unimpeded mind.\nRefine the *Lingfu* of the *Liangsheng Jing*,\nIn the Upper Clarity Realm, refine the *Liangsheng Jing* to its end.\n\n**The Supreme Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the Upper Clarity Realm, Lower Scroll: The Scripture of Refining Life, The Scripture of Numinous Secrets, The Scripture of Dispelling Demons, The Immeasurable Scripture, The Scripture of Subduing Demons, The Scripture of Upper Communication** *(The above six scriptures share a single scroll)*\n\n**The Scripture of Numinous Secrets of the Upper Clarity Realm, Chapter Eight**\n\nMan dwells between Heaven and Earth. Since the opening of creation, he has borne the name of \"human.\" Humanity is the *qi* of central harmony, the foremost of all beings. Noble and revered, he resembles Heaven and Earth. Yet he cannot endure as long as Heaven and Earth, for he fails to cultivate the Dao of gathering and refining, thus bringing about his own ruin.\n\nThe perfected person, understanding this principle, unites form and spirit, refines truth, and cultivates *qi*, attaining the realm of perfect subtlety. There, he may roam freely in his true nature, enter the Golden Gate, forever sever the cycle of rebirth, transcend and attain the Dao, vow to deliver all beings, and create boundless good causes.\n\nKnow this: the human body is hard to obtain, yet the true Dao is often obscured. If one loses this human form, it is difficult to regain even after ten thousand kalpas. Now, with a single death, one may wander endlessly through heaven and earth, never knowing the cause. After death, none know their destination. The soul is gathered, the spirit assembled, the body reunited—yet in an instant, all returns to darkness. How grievous! How lamentable!\n\nI now tell you: awaken to right view, comprehend life and death, and cease all sorrow. All karmic grievances shall be dissolved, never to burden you again.\n\nThus, the laws of Heaven and Earth decree that they, the parents of all things, fear that within their midst, beings may bring suffering upon themselves, weeping in vain, giving rise to afflictions and false evil karma—truly, not by Heaven and Earth’s calamity are these woes bestowed. The bitterness is unbearable; they cry out to Heaven above and knock upon the Earth below, mourning their own sorrow, proclaiming their grievances.\n\nTherefore, Heaven and Earth generate the true Dao, endlessly teaching all wondrous methods to refine the soul and forge the spirit, enabling transformation and self-preservation to attain a modest longevity. Yet there is no great wisdom of the true Dao, no essential method to comprehend and align with Heaven and Earth’s eternity, to match the sun and moon’s radiance, to follow the stars’ revolutions, or to turn with the kalpas’ cycles. Though one may gain a modest lifespan, it brings no true benefit.\n\nAll beings endowed with form between Heaven and Earth are subject to decay. How much more so for man, entangled by the seven emotions and six desires, ensnared by wealth and arrogance, self-satisfied and unaware of yearning for the true Dao; or by poverty and lowliness, breeding resentment, scorning the Dao, and feeling no shame, only generating evil karma.\n\nThose who study the Dao, though initially guided by wisdom, may not yet grasp worldly mechanisms. Still bound by afflictions and desires, they refuse to diligently learn the true Dao and its virtuous methods, growing careless and remorseful, mocking the true Dao as false, seeking petty gains to disrupt the heavenly order, deceiving the upright and true, and thus hastening their own demise.\n\nAll foolish people know they will die, yet they prepare tombs, seeking permanence, arranging funerary pacts, crafting mourning garments for descendants, amassing treasures to display grandeur—all according to worldly custom, yet utterly without benefit. They do not consider: when this body dies and is reborn, what karmic retribution will follow? If you do not heed my words, you too shall act thus.\n\nIn all Dharma, I clarify the true Dao, revealing it to all beings. Responding to conditions and resonances, I am free from attachment, joyful and at ease.\n\nAnd so a gāthā says:\nWith all your heart, give your utmost intent.\nWhether man or woman, you must fathom the wondrous origin.\nAt this very moment, let each thought be unwavering.\nSuch are my disciples, those of the Dao.\nEver practice the highest conduct, never dwelling in the four evils.\nDo not indulge in depraved desires, nor any misdeeds.\nSee not what exists, nor what does not.\nFocus your mind on the Dao, seek the Dharma.\n\n**Numinous Talisman of the Scripture of Numinous Secrets**\n**End of the Scripture of Numinous Secrets of the Upper Clarity Realm**\n\n**The Supreme Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the Upper Clarity Realm, Lower Scroll: The Scripture of Refining Life, The Scripture of Numinous Secrets, The Scripture of Dispelling Demons, The Immeasurable Scripture, The Scripture of Subduing Demons, The Scripture of Upper Communication** *(The above six scriptures share a single scroll)*\n\n**The Scripture of Dispelling Demons of the Upper Clarity Realm, Chapter Nine**\n\nMan’s life in the world should always know its return. The cycle of life and death turns without cease, like the sun rising in the east and setting in the west. Even the ancient sage-kings and worthies were no different.\n\nYet in every era, one should reflect deeply, cherishing life and fearing death, constantly seeking rare knowledge, vainly relying on strange methods and arts to prolong life—only to harm one’s nature. Revering spirits and ghosts, flattering for blessings, they seek fortune but invite misfortune.\n\nThose who claim to possess the Dao’s arts, feigning auspicious omens, boast of moving Heaven and Earth, gaining longevity, and transcending the world. Once such desires arise, delusion follows. Trusting the false, they corrupt the true, sinking into evil destinies, never awakening. They do not cultivate the true Dao, nor understand its causes, nor meet good teachers, nor sever the roots of evil. Unable to plan wisely for the future, they bring upon themselves sorrow and confusion.\n\nSuch actions reverse the Dao and harm the teachings, creating boundless sin. Without repentance, their false doctrines solidify, and the true Dao cannot enter—thus they persist in error.\n\nThe sages of old, wise and far-seeing, established models for all under Heaven and future generations. They wished for posterity to recognize false paths and demonic obstructions of the good Dao, thus illuminating wisdom. They also sought to dispel all demonic spirits, that all might hear the true Dao. The benefits are beyond conception.\n\nIn those times, many worthies gathered in flourishing assemblies to expound the essential Dharma, serving as guides. They thoroughly understood the beginning and end of Heaven and Earth, deeply explored the cycles of return, yet did not speak of life after death, nor of life and death as separate paths. They did not explicitly state that life, death, coming, and going are illusory, but taught the essential Dharma of non-arising and non-ceasing. Thus, those who attained the Dao could themselves grasp the profound mechanism, comprehend the Dharma of life and death, and their wisdom became boundless. The principle of life and death naturally held no fear, and the wisdom of all things spread to future generations.\n\nUpon hearing this Dharma, all may cross to the supreme, most true essential path, ascend the great Dharma bridge, and directly transcend to the Dao’s shore. Should there be those who revere the true teaching and possess perfect wisdom, they too shall likewise forever cast aside greed and attachment, with demon kings as their guarantors, ascending to the imperial court. Should emperors and kings attain this, they may govern with effortless virtue, and the realm shall govern itself. Should the worthy attain this, they shall fulfill filial piety, fraternal duty, loyalty, and trust, aiding their sovereign above, stabilizing the nation’s destiny. Disasters shall not arise, malevolent omens shall forever vanish, auspicious stars shall ever shine, inauspicious stars shall self-destruct, weapons shall not be raised, spring pestilence shall not spread, summer epidemics shall not arise, autumn plagues shall not stir, winter epidemics shall not invade. Wind and rain shall be harmonious, crops shall flourish abundantly. Throughout the land, men and women shall rejoice in great peace, its vastness filling all without end. Should one further devote oneself to upholding it with utmost sincerity, the three paths, five sufferings, and eight adversities shall be forever extinguished. Grasping the talisman and holding the register, one shall ascend directly to the Jade Capital, carefree and at ease; ascending into the Vermilion Palace, refining and transcending the bodily form, one’s name shall be inscribed on the Purple Register, receiving the mandate of the Crimson Empyrean.\n\nThe Five Emperors, great demons, all celestial immortals, demon kings of the Three Realms, flying heavenly deities, and boundless great spirits shall together receive grace and pardon, all attaining the wondrous Dharma. They shall traverse the heavens, jointly safeguarding and elevating, ascending to the Supreme Clarity.\n\nThen a gāthā was spoken:\nWith the heart’s great vow, this merit’s power,\nNow extending to the great assembly, all should believe and hold fast.\nAttaining the lofty and wondrous, true and subtle Dharma,\nGaining boundless goodness, the Dao’s wisdom pervades all.\nWith right mindfulness widely propagated,\nFor future beings who practice in due time,\nThey shall attain the eternal root and enter the wondrous,\nTheir wisdom complete.\nWhether with form or without,\nThe greatest wisdom,\nFree from all other thoughts.\n\n*The Scripture of Supreme Clarity on Dispelling Demons* concludes here.\n*The Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the Most High: The Lower Scripture of Supreme Clarity*\n*The Scripture of Refining Life, The Scripture of Numinous Secrets, The Scripture of Dispelling Demons, The Immeasurable Scripture, The Scripture of Subduing Demons, The Scripture of Ascending Communication*—the above six scriptures are in one scroll.\n*The Immeasurable Scripture of Supreme Clarity*, Scroll Ten\n\nThe orthodoxy of Heaven and Earth shall forever dispel calamities. The sun, moon, and five planets shall radiate brilliant light. The people shall thereby flourish, each awakening to virtuous thoughts. Yet when the people grow restless and the customs of the age shift, harming the harmonious qi, Heaven and Earth shall greatly rage, the three luminaries of the sun, moon, and stars shall lose their brightness, and Heaven and Earth shall contend, no longer in harmony. The signs shall be untimely winds and thunder, harming the nature of things so that none may grow; the people shall perish and be injured. Yin and yang shall contend, no longer in harmony, the five grains shall not ripen, water and fire shall lose their measure, and disasters shall arise together. For yin and yang were originally united, mutually aiding to generate harmonious qi, yet now contend instead.\n\nThus, I clearly reveal the essential Dharma, expounding the causes of expiatory rites, that all may be spared from calamities and all people come to know the root of the Dao. Thereupon, the perfected great spirits, innumerable hosts, all celestial perfected ones, and the boundless, immeasurable assemblies of sages from the ten directions all bowed their heads and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “We have yet to fathom the subtleties of the true Dao. We humbly beseech your great compassion to broadly proclaim it. We dare ask: when there is severe drought, all grasses and trees wither, and the people suffer and die of hunger, what is the extraordinary cause?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: “The disaster of severe drought arises from the sun losing its measure, the six yang forces all resentful, thereby causing harm. The yang nine cycle spans one thousand eight hundred years, and when it encounters *jiǎ*, it is the great yang nine. The hundred six cycle spans one thousand six hundred years, and when it encounters *shēn*, it is the great hundred six. If the yang nine does not meet *jiǎ*, or the hundred six does not meet *shēn*, it shall not be a disaster. The lesser yang nine spans one hundred eighty years, the lesser hundred six one hundred sixty years; only when their cycles converge on *jiǎ* and *shēn* shall it be a disaster. If not *jiǎ* and *shēn*, it shall not be a disaster.”\n\n“We dare ask about floods?”\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: “Floods arise from the moon losing its measure, the six yin forces all resentful, thereby causing harm. The cycles are the same.”\n\n“We dare ask about fires?”\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: “Fires arise from the fire star deviating from its path, transgressing its proper position and passing through regions beyond its domain. Below, it manifests as children’s rhymes: if auspicious, it brings fortune; if inauspicious, it brings misfortune. When it descends in the *yín*, *shēn*, *sì*, and *hài* positions, it shall burn prefectures, counties, ferries, and towns. When it descends in the *zǐ*, *wǔ*, *mǎo*, and *yǒu* positions, it shall burn temples, palaces, ancestral halls, and dwellings. When it descends in the *chén*, *xū*, *chǒu*, and *wèi* positions, it shall burn the people’s homes, cities, mountains, marshes, and boats.”\n\nThereupon, the assembly all entreated: “If such calamities occur, how may they be saved?”\nThe Heavenly Worthy then addressed the assembly, saying: “Floods, droughts, and fires all arise from whether the people practice goodness or not. If a village practices goodness, disasters shall turn to fortune; if a village does not practice goodness, fortune shall turn to disaster. Furthermore, the two stars of Heavenly Usurpation and Heavenly Plunder descend, bringing bandits and chaos, plundering possessions and taking lives. If one does not perform grand jiao rites and submit memorials in worship, the calamities shall not be averted.”\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy revealed the rites of the Great Unity jiao, commanding the Treasure Virtue Perfected One to descend and transmit them, that all people might be spared from calamities, forever free from floods, fires, drought demons, bandits, and disasters. Such benefits shall extend broadly to all. If in a given place one lacks the means to perform the rites, one may fast, bathe, and purify oneself, then invite a Daoist to recite this scripture exclusively, even a hundred times, and the calamities may still be averted.\n\nThen a gāthā was spoken:\nThe Dao’s methods are nameless,\nDependent on human cultivation.\nThe most true and wondrous Dharma,\nRare to encounter.\nYou now encounter it,\nA blessing from past lives.\nTeach others in turn,\nCreating great merit’s power.\nDisasters shall dissolve,\nFortune shall swiftly arrive.\nIf one can revere and uphold it,\nEver shall there be harmony and prosperity.\nHeaven and Earth, yin and yang,\nAll shall harmonize their qi.\nAll people\nShall attain freedom and ease.\n\nThe *Wuliang Jing* and *Lingfu* of the Shangqing Realm\n*Wuliang Jing* concludes\nBeneath the *Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the Supreme Lord* and the *Shangqing Realm Scriptures*:\n*The Scripture of Refining Life*, *The Scripture of Numinous Secrets*, *The Scripture of Dispelling Demons*, *The Wuliang Jing*, *The Scripture of Subduing Demons*, *The Scripture of Ascending Communication*—the above six scriptures share a single fascicle.\n*Shangqing Realm Scripture of Subduing Demons*, Chapter Eleven\n\nAfter Heaven and Earth divided their forms, they were distinguished as pure and turbid: the pure became Heaven, the turbid became Earth. What marked their beginning? At the inception of the ten poles and thousand realms, perfected beings attained their stations, divided their forms to teach and transform, and only then did the measures of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, sun and moon begin to operate. Once these measures were fixed, qi was then divided.\n\nThe East holds nine qi, where the Wood phase is gentle and compliant; the South holds three qi, where the Fire qi blazes fiercely. Though Fire qi is but three, it equals the nine qi of the Wood phase, together making twelve qi. The West holds seven qi, where the Metal phase is firm and solid; the North holds five qi, where the Water qi surges boundlessly. Though Water qi is but five, it equals the seven qi of the Metal phase, together making twelve qi. The remaining qi of the four directions—northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest—are gathered as Brahma qi. The qi of the southeast is balanced, the qi of the northwest is balanced, harmonizing with the qi of the four directions. The qi of the northeast generates mountains, stones, great trees, and mighty beasts in abundance, while the qi of the southwest is scant, producing only treasures. The upper and lower positions, that is, the Earth phase of the Center, divide twelve qi. Rising, they form Heaven; stored, they become Earth. Thus, Heaven and Earth each possess thirty-six qi, and only then can they generate the myriad things.\n\nThereupon, the great deities of the ten poles and perfected beings, the celestial perfected and great sages, simultaneously bowed their heads and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “We are fortunate to hear the true teaching, yet have not fathomed its profound mechanism. We only pray for your compassion to broadly expound it.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said to the assembly: “The qi of Heaven and Earth moves in accord with numerical cycles, and these cycles also have their ends. Even the sun, moon, five planets, all celestial bodies, and the most sagely beings cannot escape calamitous cycles—how much less those of shallow learning who wish to avoid illness and harm?”\n\nThereupon, the entire assembly was struck with awe and fear. They bowed their heads and prostrated themselves again, asking: “If such calamities exist, how may they be averted?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: “You have all been fortunate in past lives, encountering good causes and hearing these teachings in manifold ways. Yet those born between Heaven and Earth are all deluded by the seven emotions and six desires, which confuse body and mind. Thus, they fail to hear the true Dao or awaken to the wondrous Dharma, and only accumulate transgressions, even when they repent. I shall now proclaim the true teaching for you, unfold the jade tones, turn the wheel of the true scriptures, and broadly present offerings. Whether on the *jiazi* day, the *gengshen* day, in the first month, the seventh month, or the tenth month—along with the eight solar terms, your life-destiny days, and birthdays—you should strictly maintain incense and fire, diligently uphold the Dharma, cultivate and gather the qi of the utmost truth, harmonize yin and yang, connect the blood vessels above and below, commune with Heaven and Earth, absorb the upright qi, dispel defilement and evil, prevent the arising of disasters and illness, eradicate ghosts and demons, ensure the five paths are unimpeded, and promote the flourishing of the six livestock. You should listen and receive these teachings, then teach others in turn, so that all later learners may hear of these good fruits, all attain auspiciousness, and every household and family share in the supreme goodness.\n\nThis scripture is named *Inconceivable*, and its merit and power are likewise inconceivable.”\n\nThereupon, the celestial immortals, the boundless perfected beings, the great sages of the utmost truth, the innumerable celestial deities, and the countless multitudes all heard these words and rejoiced. They vowed to uphold and protect the teaching, disseminate it throughout the world, and universally bestow its boundless benefits upon all. They cautioned that it must not be carelessly disclosed or treated with irreverence by unenlightened commoners of later ages, lest they fail to attain its blessed fruits.\n\nThen a gāthā was spoken:\nThe true and constant, unchanging—\nThis is called the true Dao.\nAll manifold evils\nShall be wholly cast far away.\nIt is like the lotus flower,\nWhich does not grow on dry land.\nOnly in moistened places\nDoes this flower arise.\nFrom the turbid mire,\nIt emerges unstained.\nFree from all craving and attachment,\nYou walk in purity.\nLike the lotus flower,\nWhen you practice this Dao,\nThe child of supreme virtue\nShall possess all marks in full.\n\nThe *Lingfu of the Scripture of Subduing Demons* of the Shangqing Realm\n*Shangqing Realm Scripture of Subduing Demons* concludes\n\nThe *Thirty-Six Venerable Scriptures of the Most High: Scriptures of the Shangqing Realm, Volume III*\n*Scripture of Refining Life, Scripture of Numinous Secrets, Scripture of Dispelling Demons, Scripture of the Immeasurable, Scripture of Subduing Demons, Scripture of Ascending Communication*—the above six scriptures share one scroll.\n*Scripture of Ascending Communication of the Shangqing Realm*, Chapter Twelve\n\nThe qi of emptiness and spontaneity gives birth to Heaven and Earth; the upright qi transforms and communicates, while the deviant qi is dispelled. When upright qi is scant, Heaven and Earth are obscured by deviant qi. It is only because deviant qi abounds that it can harm upright qi; when upright qi abounds, it can restrain deviant qi. This is the spontaneous qi of Heaven and Earth.\n\nAll deviant qi arises because upright qi does not circulate, allowing deviant qi to enter. Those who cultivate the true Dao must cause deviant qi to dissipate and practice the supreme, most perfect Dao to attain the method of prolonging life and avoiding death.\n\nHumans receive their mandate from Heaven, which has its own norms. Heaven and Earth privately grant thirty years; if this is exceeded, it is like the intercalary days added when the cycles of Heaven, Earth, sun, and moon align. If one cultivates the supreme Dao, the most perfect Dao, and the methods of exhaling, inhaling, and concealing the spirit, one ascends and descends with Heaven and Earth and thus attains immortality.\n\nThose who rigidly guard their bodily form without adaptability will ultimately suffer no less harm than those who harmonize spirit and gather qi, unite with the Dao, and merge with the true, appearing in accordance with things without losing their true nature—only thus can they endure long.\n\nHuman life—all calculations, numbers, clothing, and food—has its allotted portion. Though this portion is fixed, it also depends on one’s cultivation of the supreme Dao to increase blessings and prosperity. It is like one who does not plow in spring yet expects a harvest in autumn; when nothing comes of it, they say it is Heaven’s portion. Those who do no good yet seek blessings differ not at all from this.\n\nIf today you eat another’s food, then tomorrow go to eat theirs, this is not called eating another’s food but \"borrowing provisions.\" If today you carry another’s burden, then tomorrow go to have them carry yours, this is not called carrying another’s burden but \"borrowing labor.\" If today you join another in planning, then tomorrow go to join them again, this is not called helping another but \"exchanging merit.\" If today you praise another, then tomorrow receive their praise, this is not called praising another but \"taking turns in commendation.\" Such comparisons are countless and beyond reckoning.\n\nYet people perform a small good deed and immediately expect blessings in return—how is this different? The perfected and superior person does not act thus. If others do not aid me, I alone secretly aid them, and I will surely receive good karmic retribution. If all others commit evil deeds, I alone do good, and I will surely receive good retribution. If others do not contribute to me, I alone delight in contributing to them, and I will surely receive good retribution. If others do not share food and drink with me, I alone share with them, and I will surely receive good retribution. If all others practice deceit and hypocrisy to deceive me, I alone treat them with sincerity and trust, and I will surely receive good retribution. Such comparisons are countless and beyond reckoning.\n\nIf today I show kindness to another and expect repayment, yet they do not repay, I grow resentful—this must not be. The perfected and superior person seeks the grace of Heaven; the middling person seeks the grace of others; the foolish do not perform good to respond to Heaven, nor do they exert effort to respond to others, yet vainly seek blessings—truly, this is shameful.\n\nIf one is wealthy, noble, and wise in this life, it is because they performed good deeds in a past life and now receive this blessing. If, in this life of wealth, nobility, and wisdom, one grows greedy and refuses to give alms or act in accordance with cause and effect, then in the next life they will return to poverty, lowliness, and ignorance—present karmic conditions are no different.\n\nThen a gāthā was spoken:\nUnderstanding the empty principle,\nAll thoughts are resolved.\nWhen the meeting occurs,\nTogether you enter the wondrous gate.\nAt ease and as you wish—\nSuch are these methods.\nWithout end,\nBriefly, the essentials are made clear.\nYou should know:\nSimply practice good thoughts.\nContemplate all things,\nEven in dark and hidden places.\nAll attain illumination,\nThe wondrous form of non-action.\nAll are made complete,\nSuch are the benefits.\n\n*The Numinous Talisman of the Scripture of

give life,\nThe dark qi of Primal Earth ascends to nurture.\nThe qi of the Five Phases all generate one another,\nThe qi of the Four Seasons all interpenetrate.\n\nAll people under Heaven share the same nature.\nThe nature of Heaven is good—it gives birth to the myriad things without exception.\nThe nature of Earth is good—it nourishes the myriad things without exception.\nThe sage delights in ordering the world, yet truly models himself upon Heaven and Earth,\nThus the myriad things all receive his merit.\n\nThe great and good, the divine immortals and perfected persons,\nAssist Heaven and Earth and dare not treat them lightly.\nThey revere, honor, cherish, and protect them,\nAll in harmony with the primordial qi,\nIn accord with the mind of Heaven,\nIn resonance with the earth’s terrain.\nThus they alone enjoy enduring fortune and know no misfortune.\n\nThe sages and worthies of antiquity pondered deeply and planned far ahead,\nAnd so came to know the Dao of Heaven.\nThus they devoted themselves to good and dared not do evil.\nLater generations, cunning and false, devoted themselves to evil deeds,\nYet wished to avoid misfortune and keep harm at bay—this cannot be.\n\nNow I shall show you a method by which you may nurture yourself for all time,\nAnd those who attain its utmost must never forget it for even a moment.\nIf people today wish to avoid misfortune and keep harm at bay,\nTo attain long life,\nThey should preserve self-love, self-regard, and self-affinity,\nAnd by these means nurture themselves—only then can they be free from harm,\nAnd their bodies long preserved.\n\nEating and drinking in due season, neither too much nor too little,\nThis is self-love and self-nurturance.\nClosing the gates and dwelling within, not engaging in worldly affairs,\nThis is self-love and self-nurturance.\nSeeking the root of the Dao all day long, content in poverty and lowliness, free from care,\nThis is self-love and self-nurturance.\nIf you take these as self-love and self-nurturance, it cannot be so.\n\nThe Dao of self-love lies in sincerity:\nThough responding to the world, one is not seen to be disturbed;\nThough abiding in stillness, one is not seen to be constrained.\nSeeing others’ faults, one does not take them as faults,\nBut instead turns the gaze inward,\nNever departing from this even for an instant—\nThis is the Dao of self-love.\n\nThe Dao of self-nurturance lies in freedom from care:\nMoving by day and night, yet never enslaved by the heart-mind—\nThis is the Dao of self-nurturance.\n\nIf you can trust in this and practice it,\nYou will enjoy its benefits for ten thousand kalpas, without end.\nSince before the separation of Heaven and Earth,\nBeyond the Great Clarity,\nIts measure cannot be reckoned.\nEmpty and spontaneous, it merges with true principle—\nAll things are without existence.\n\nWere it not for my establishment of the Great Dharma and its universal proclamation,\nYou would never again hear such essential teachings.\nIt cannot be seen, cannot be heard;\nIf one speaks of its existence, no form is to be found.\n\nIf one speaks of its nonexistence, all things receive it to come into being.\nA hundred million transformations, vast and boundless,\nWithout before or after, without roundness or squareness,\nWithout going or coming, without birth or extinction,\nWithout form or image, without high or low—\nNaturally empty and mysterious.\n\nOnly after the division of forms did Heaven and Earth arise,\nAlong with the sun, moon, and stars.\nThe Dao’s dharma unfolds in clarity.\nAll sentient beings who hear this teaching\nRejoice spontaneously, without limit.\nTheir fundamental nature is all empty—\nNot through contemplation or illumination,\nBut equal to emptiness itself.\nAwakening to the causes and conditions of their original nature,\nWithout other thoughts,\nEqual and free from discriminating notions.\n\nIf one can single-mindedly recite and deeply uphold it,\nAll past obstructions will be extinguished,\nAll will harmonize,\nAll hardships and calamities will dissolve,\nAnd body and mind will become pure.\n\nThus a gāthā says:\nDelight in seeking the supreme Dharma,\nCut off form, cut off consciousness.\nFulfill these practices,\nDistance desire, distance greed.\nSuch are the karmic fruits—\nUnobstructed, without hindrance,\nPure and spontaneous,\nWithout remnant defilement.\n\nLet the Dharma be your wife,\nCherish the sutras as jade.\nWith a heart of shame and repentance,\nConstantly dedicate merit.\nThe heart-mind becomes gentle,\nThe teachings practiced as spoken.\nWisdom increases manifold,\nLeading to awakening.\n\n*Taiqing Scripture’s Numinous Talisman*\n*Taiqing Realm, Taiqing Scripture*   Concluded.\n\n*The Supreme Thirty-Six Revered

above six scriptures are contained in one scroll)*\n*Taiqing Realm Penetrating Vision Scripture*   Second Scroll\n\nTo study the Dao and cultivate authenticity, to exhaust the Dao and deliver beings, one must first generate the heart-mind.\n\nIn studying the Dao, from beginning to end, thought after thought, maintain purity; heart after heart, never retreat. Forget the heart-mind, extinguish the heart-mind. From start to finish, direct intention. Whether in movement or stillness, in action or form, be as still as cold ashes, as silent as withered wood. Extinguish all perceptions, extinguish all thoughts, extinguish all heart-minds. Then, with each arising thought, let it be forgotten at once—spirit moves without hindrance.\n\nReturn the heart-mind to stillness, truly arrive at the Dao-ground. This is called turning the heart-mind toward the Dao, revering the profound and true Dao. Blessings descend without end, disasters dissolve before they manifest.\n\nPractice according to one’s capacity, exhausting wholehearted devotion. With a cinnabar heart, gaze toward the ten directions. Burn incense, prostrate in worship, move body and heart-mind, surrender body and life, reverently honor the Dao Ancestor and the Three Treasures. Offer pure wealth to purchase various incenses, oils, the eight delicacies, and a hundred flavors. Prepare feasts for offerings, invite and command Daoist masters, return the heart-mind in supplication, earnestly beseech the Perfected.\n\nThrough such directed heart-mind, wash away all dust and burdens. Past-root transgressions, karmic afflictions, the errors of life and death—all are purified by utmost sincerity. Through fasting and myriad good deeds, inner and outer become thoroughly illuminated, universally illuminating the ten directions, enabling all beings to gain penetrating vision. Such merit is boundless, beyond conception.\n\nIf one observes the fast and precepts, concentrates the mind upon the supreme Dao, and dissolves the ten thousand concerns, forgetting both self and others, then in the empty chamber, clarity arises—true numinous response. This is the cultivation of the most supreme Dao.\n\nIf one generates the unsurpassed heart-mind, desiring to return and turn toward the Dao, one must first uphold the fast, awaken the original heart-mind, rescue the impoverished souls of the seven ancestors above, and extend to one’s own body below. Dispel disasters, cross over calamities, increase and prolong blessings and longevity. With solitary utmost sincerity, establish the fast and open the way for deliverance. Necessarily, souls transcend the nine nights, spirits refine in the Three Clarities. Life becomes distant and long, immortals attain the Dao. Aspiring to worthies, yearning for the Dao, use their abundance to open one’s lack, use their virtue to dispel one’s ignorance. Break through stinginess and greed, accomplish lofty conduct. Purify body and heart-mind, circulate spirit and qi. Coming and going without end, without obstruction or blockage.\n\nPray to Heaven and Earth, supplicate the luminous spirits. One must sever demonic influences, purify inner and outer. All desire to dissolve the ten thousand conditions, still the six emotions. Universally wash the troubled heart-mind, universally realize all perceptions.\n\nThus, those who study the Dao but do not diligently practice, who do not cultivate fasting and precepts, will find it difficult to reach the Perfected—idly laboring in the mountains and forests.\n\nAll who uphold the fast and strictly observe the precepts must desire to practice the Dao, return and honor the Supreme Clarity. Seek the true, study the Dao, refine qi, and prolong life. Universally extend to humans and heavens, universally aid the ordinary and the sagely.\n\nYet the conduct of superior practitioners is not something the common can uphold.\n\nThe Golden Register’s regulations and standards protect and secure the nation’s destiny, dispel disasters, and prolong life.\nThe Jade Register’s essential standards safeguard the altars of soil and grain, eternally ending warfare.\nThe Yellow Register’s correct model opens the way for souls, universally extending to life and death. Sages and ordinary alike cultivate together, naturally broadly delivering the hidden and manifest, universally rescuing all the solitary and obstructed, universally saving all suffering souls in the nine dark realms.\n\nOn the Three Primes, the eight solar terms, one’s original destiny, and birthdays, study the Dao and cultivate the body. Repent transgressions, seek blessings, rescue those in the three paths, the five sufferings, the eight difficulties, the calamities of imprisonment, illness, and death. Uphold and recite divine incantations to repel and expel pestilence, seasonal epidemics, demonic influences, and perverse qi.\n\nFurthermore, there are scriptures such as the *Golden Chamber*, *Celestial Treasure*, *Orthodox Unity*, *Great Peace*, *Five Refinements*, and *Essential Teachings*. Diligently practice the Dao, follow the correct models, each possessing its own scripture.\n\nThus a gāthā says:\nBurn incense, establish the fast—\nMerit boundless.\nThe sweet dew of Dharma-food,\nLiberation as its broth.\nManifest their abundance,\nReveal all lands.\nMake offerings to the ten directions,\nBoundless Dao-treasures.\nAnd all beings,\nCultivating pure lands.\nTeach and transform beings,\nMastering dignified conduct.\nBestow fearlessness,\nGenerate the unsurpassed Dao.\nUniversally extend supplication,\nDemonstrating its practice.\n\n*Penetrating Vision Scripture’s Numinous Talisman*\n*Taiqing Realm Penetrating Vision Scripture*   Concluded.\n\n**Supreme Thirty-Six Divisions of Revered Scriptures: *Taiqing Realm Scriptures* (Volume I)**\n\n**Taiqing Scripture, *Penetrating Vision Scripture, Assembly of Immortals Scripture, Cavern Abyss Scripture, Esoteric Scripture, True Unity Scripture*** – The above six scriptures share one scroll.\n\n**Taiqing Realm *Assembly of Immortals Scripture*** (Chapter Three)\n\nAll who practice the Dao possess the utmost conduct; they must cultivate utmost reverence. They mobilize will and heart, invoking the descent of true numina. They circulate qi and spirit, causing their influence to pervade heaven and earth. Thus, entering the oratory to ascend the altar, reciting scriptures and prostrating, paying homage to the Perfected and repenting transgressions—all these are comprehensive Dao-practices. Circumambulating the altar thrice, they follow the original methods for all assemblies of repentance, supplication, or gratitude.\n\nWhether for heaven and earth, the emperor, the realm, the people, ancestral generations, oneself, one’s family, the Three Wretched Paths and Five Sufferings, or the Six Destinies and Four Births—all require the establishment of fasts, the practice of the Dao, the burning of incense, and prostration with scripture-recitation and hymns. For all supplications, one must observe the fast. When the realm suffers calamities—war raging on all sides, the people afflicted by pestilence, drought, flood, or death—all dire perils necessitate the observance of fasts.\n\nWhen creating scriptures or images, constructing halls, palaces, monasteries, grottoes, or mountain retreats, establishing Daoist sanctuaries, or crafting bells, chimes, ritual instruments, or celestial music—all such meritorious deeds require reverence. One must broadly establish pure fasts, earnestly extend supplications, recite scriptures and invoke the Dao, sever all evil thoughts, augment inner and outer goodness, and extol boundless merit.\n\nFor all scripture-recitation, prostration, and incense-offering, one must follow the scriptures precisely: thrice offering incense, thrice bowing, thrice performing the ninefold prostration, straightening the body and touching the head to the ground, chanting the jade-like tones in harmonious accord, ensuring no discord. Thus, all who see or hear shall rejoice together, praising in unison, propagating the Dao and its teachings. Such merit is inconceivable, an immeasurable and boundless wisdom.\n\nMoreover, through this merit, past ancestors ascend to pure realms, present kin enjoy bliss, and future rebirths dwell perpetually in blessed pure lands, where clothing and sustenance arise naturally. Therefore, cultivate this pure heart and universally adorn all. Array myriad incense, flowers, lamps, and candles as offerings, universally presenting them to the deities of the Three Realms, the Four Offices and Five Emperors, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, and the one hundred twenty divine ministers. Earnestly extend supplications to invoke blessings, prolong life, dispel disasters, and transcend calamities, safeguarding this servant’s body and universally benefiting all sentient beings—those of the heavenly, earthly, human, animal, hungry ghost, and hellish destinies—dissolving all suffering.\n\nFurther, by maintaining fasts with focused intent, relinquishing greed and attachment, abstaining from sensory indulgence, and donating scriptures or images according to one’s means, one encourages others to broadly cultivate karmic affinities. Such benefits are inconceivable: seven generations of parents escape suffering and ascend to heaven, enjoying carefree bliss; households live in harmony, flourishing across generations; karmic bonds with the Dao dissolve transgressions, perfecting virtue and wisdom; the world attains great peace, all nations harmonize; and all beings escape suffering, entering the true and correct.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, bow to the Supreme, Correct, and True Three Treasures, extolling their merit. For all future lives, establish karmic affinities of goodness, dispelling ignorance and receiving sagely grace. A hundred blessings adorn, ten thousand virtues gather like clouds, benefiting all beings, liberating them from suffering. Make offerings and pay reverence to the compassionate teachings. May one forever uphold them, burning incense morning and night to seek blessings. May they circulate throughout the world without negligence.\n\nA gāthā says:\nWith skillful expedient wisdom,\nManifesting as one wills,\nAccomplishing all beings,\nUnobstructed and thorough.\nBeyond existence and non-existence,\nWithout self or other,\nConstantly uphold good vows,\nEncouraging others to awaken.\nLet them seek supreme goodness,\nFar from evil paths.\nAttain fearlessness,\nThe pure fruit of the Dharma.\nAll unobstructed,\nUniversally enter the Dharma-gates.\nAll who possess this heart\nShall all attain liberation.\n\n*Numinous Talisman of the Assembly of Immortals Scripture*\n*Taiqing Realm Assembly of Immortals Scripture* Concluded.\n\n**Supreme Thirty-Six Divisions of Revered Scriptures: *Taiqing Realm Scriptures* (Volume I)**\n\n**Taiqing Scripture, *Penetrating Vision Scripture, Assembly of Immortals Scripture, Cavern Abyss Scripture, Esoteric Scripture, True Unity Scripture*** – The above six scriptures share one scroll.\n\n**Taiqing Realm *Cavern Abyss Scripture*** (Chapter Four)\n\nWithin the *Great Cavern Taiqing Scripture*, jeweled clouds and jade thrones, five-colored auspicious clouds fill the empty sky without end. The great sages of heaven and the assembled immortals gather therein, illuminating profound principles. Celestial youths and maidens present treasures in offering, venerating the Correct and True, beseeching the Great Compassion to broadly extend expedient means, expounding the scriptures and disseminating the Dao’s currents. Even myriad scriptures and ten thousand treatises—all are wondrous meanings, enabling all to attain understanding and awakening.\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the assembly: After Daoist priests and nuns leave the household life, they must uphold scriptures, precepts, and ritual codes, seeking transmission from a master. They must exhaust utmost sincerity. After receiving scriptures, they dare not resent the Dao or blame the master, nor carelessly divulge or slight sacred texts, lest calamity befall their seven ancestors, subjecting them to judgment in the netherworld courts.\n\nIf there are those of utmost integrity who exhaust their cinnabar sincerity, whose virtue and conduct are pure and simple, whose actions are upright, and whose generations are renowned—whose bodies and minds are both pure—yet have not encountered the secret essentials of the Dao’s canon, they should earnestly turn toward the Dao, seeking a master to initiate and deliver them, ascending to blessed fruits and advancing toward the unsurpassed Dao.\n\nOnce possessing scriptures and methods, they must unite in heart and intent, awaiting numinous response. They must not outwardly feign dignified conduct while inwardly harboring complacency, falsely praising themselves and disparaging others, claiming this is right and that is wrong, or envying those superior to themselves. They should constantly encourage and guide, never mocking the unenlightened. Such wisdom shall grow day by day, culminating in boundless wisdom, difficult to extol.\n\nThe great scriptures of the Three Caverns are transmitted only after set durations: the highest sages bestow them upon perfected transcendents and superior immortals after forty thousand kalpas; divine immortals after four thousand years, or a thousand years, or seven hundred years; and in the mundane world, after forty years. Should one truly comprehend these scriptures, it would be deemed inconceivable. Even the wise and discerning deem them rare to encounter—how much more so for those of shallow learning in the Dao, who could scarcely attain them? If there be scholars who wholeheartedly devote themselves to a single assembly, they must exert their utmost sincerity, uphold their vows in perpetuity, and with refined devotion move the divine spirits, never betraying their original resolve. Persisting without slack, they too may ascend to the ranks of immortality and attain the unsurpassed Dao. Yet one must fear the lack of resolve, lest halfway they abandon themselves, repeatedly harming the Dao—not only achieving no merit, but incurring transgression. You all should trust my words, adhere to the teachings and precepts, and widely propagate them.\n\nFor all invocations and petitions, one must receive and uphold them in accordance with the method: compose the mind, assume a dignified demeanor, arrange the sequence in order, proceed with graceful steps, heed the twelve double-hours’ bell, hold flowers and lead with hymns, grasp the ritual tablets and wield the censer, raise the banners and establish the truths, and ascend the altar with solemn composure. Whether Daoist priests or female officials perform rites for themselves or others—seeking blessings, repenting sins, or dispelling calamities—they must do so with wholehearted sincerity, earnestly praying, addressing and invoking with clear and harmonious speech, ensuring the text and reasoning are upright. They must not jest with melodies, modulate their voices in exaggerated rises and falls, or mingle their words and tones to provoke astonishment. Whether conducting rituals, offering thanks, chanting praises, or expounding teachings, all must be practiced until fluent. They should not falter or break off midway, leaving the text and reasoning disjointed. Such lapses not only disrupt the solemnity of the invocation but may also invite misfortune. In every matter, one must concentrate, adhere to the original forms and rituals, and thereby gain boundless, immeasurable blessings and manifold benefits. The celestial perfected will rejoice, all methods will harmonize in beauty, and through such merit, eternal felicity shall be attained.\n\nAnd the gatha says:\nPurity is the fruit of the Dharma, greatly to be extolled.\nPurity is the medicine of the Dharma, curing all ills.\nPurity of heart is supreme, tranquility and bliss are ultimate.\nPurity and solemnity are equal, boundless and without limit.\nThe worldly methods of the Dao dispel all poisons.\nFirst, they relieve hunger and thirst, transforming all beings,\nEnabling them to achieve perfection and sever all delusions.\nEver abiding in good deeds, one attains profound depth in the Dharma.\n\nThe *Wondrous Talismans of the Abyssal Cavern Scripture*\nThe *Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Abyssal Cavern* concludes.\n\nThe *Supreme Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the Great Clarity Realm: The Great Clarity Realm Scripture*\n*The Great Clarity Scripture, The Penetrating Vision Scripture, The Immortals’ Collected Scripture, The Abyssal Cavern Scripture, The Esoteric Inner Scripture, The Scripture of True Unity*—the above six scriptures share a single scroll.\n\n*The Esoteric Inner Scripture of the Great Clarity Realm*, Fifth Scroll\n\nThe merits of all scriptures have been concealed for kalpas within the jeweled treasuries of the Flowery Hall Palace, never lightly disclosed to the lower world. Now, by good fortune, they may be heard. Those who receive and uphold them, practicing the Dao, expounding their teachings, and reciting the true scriptures, should place five-colored flowers in a container. With each practice of the Dao and chanting of goodness, scatter them into the empty void—this is called \"scattering flowers,\" offered to declare one’s vows.\n\nWhen reciting this scripture, one should first circumambulate it once, hold incense, bow in reverence, perform the three prostrations, sit upright, purify with water, and waft incense to sanctify the scripture. Concentrate the spirit, gather qi, praise and take refuge, and humbly make entreaties—only then may one attain blessings beyond conception.\n\nThe celestial perfected keep their secrets hidden, unknown to the world, which is why those who cultivate truth and nurture qi rarely grasp these essential texts. I shall now briefly elucidate them; you must listen and receive without distraction, that you may truly hear.\n\nThe superior adept regards silence as the cultivation of qi—this is preserving qi, yet it leads to dullness. To inhale purity and exhale impurity is the exchange of qi, yet it leads to emptiness. Dullness scatters qi and maddens the spirit; the true numen grows weary and finds no refuge. Emptiness leaves the cinnabar field barren; breath control is labored in vain, and qi cannot abide. These are not true methods of nurturing qi but invite illness, mistaken for \"embryonic breathing,\" harming one’s nature and life. Many err in this way.\n\nSwallowing and gulping, gathering qi to refine the spirit, pointing to it as \"returning the elixir\"—this harms one’s nature and life. Many err in this way.\n\nTo exist as if continuous, entrusting qi to harmonize with the spirit, exhaling and inhaling with intent to abide, drawing qi inward without release, sealing breath to temper the form—one swallow after another, gathering both flanks, taking empty swallowing as the method—this is borrowing qi to draw water, an irrigation technique, yet deemed a means to secure the body’s field, only to deplete oneself. Many err in this way.\n\nSitting upright, raising the body, filling the four great elements with qi, circulating the blood and channels, nourishing and protecting with harmony—this is the method of \"dispersing qi to burn the body.\" Yet these are not true ways of nurturing qi but are mistaken for \"congealing the spirit in seated oblivion,\" only to lose the body and harm life. Many err in this way.\n\nAll such practices are mere techniques; where technique is established, the Dao vanishes. Those who cultivate truth must use technique to illuminate the Dao and thereby attain it. Seeking the Dao through the generation of heaven and earth, one may grasp it. Those who lose the Dao rely on the qi of emptiness and spontaneity to engender chaos, yet chaos alone preserves the Dao. When chaos is pierced to form the seven apertures, chaos dies, and heaven and earth arise. Once heaven and earth are divided, the Dao is difficult to preserve in full.\n\nHeaven and earth unite yin and yang to move; spirit and qi activate, giving rise to humans and beasts. When spirit and qi are still, grasses, trees, mountains, and stones emerge. Yet when humans are born through the union of male and female, and grasses and trees through seeds, the mechanism of heaven and earth’s transformation is already extinguished. To rely on technique is to lack the mechanism of heaven and earth—how can one speak of the Dao?\n\nCultivating truth and nurturing qi is to preserve the Dao in full. Aligning with the qi of heaven and earth to cultivate truth and nurture qi, one may attain profound stillness, ever-responsive yet ever-quiet, abiding in non-action as if in action, and in action as if in non-action—only then may one speak of the Dao.\n\nAnd the gatha says:\nThis Dao is practiced as one,\nYet without form.\n\nHow can there be techniques? Only a rough outline may be shown. All sentient beings may attain liberation. By exhorting and guiding others, one leads them into the gate of truth. This is rare and wondrous, manifesting boundlessly, inexhaustible in its use, and thus employed to guide others. Bestowing fearlessness and rectifying the intentions of learners, let none be deluded by a single technique or entangled in manifold vows.\n\nThe *Inner Secret Scripture of Talismans* within the Taiqing Realm concludes here.\n\n**Taiqing Realm Scripture of the Thirty-Six Venerable Scriptures**\n*Taiqing Scripture, Thorough Vision Scripture, Assembly of Immortals Scripture, Cavern Abyss Scripture, Inner Secret Scripture, True One Scripture*—the above six scriptures share a single fascicle.\n\n**Taiqing Realm True One Scripture, Chapter Six**\nThe qi of the True One arises from the Dao, receives qi to come into being, and is perfected by qi—this is called *ming* (life-destiny). From the True One, form is endowed, and one’s *xing* (nature) may be preserved whole. The movement of *xing* and *ming* is governed by the heart. When the heart engages in thought, it is called *yi* (intention). The movement of *yi*, when it involves contemplation, is called *zhi* (will). When contemplation culminates in accomplishment, with nothing unconsolidated, it is called *zhi* (wisdom). Wisdom that encompasses all things is called *lü* (deliberation). That which moves to nourish the body is called *hun* (ethereal soul). That which stills to stabilize the body is called *po* (corporeal soul). That which flows through bones and flesh is called *blood*. Preserving form, nurturing spirit, and gathering qi is called *jing* (essence). When spirit harmonizes and delights, and qi is pure and unburdened, it is called *he* (harmony). When spirit gathers qi and thereafter engages in nurture and protection, encompassing the hundred bones, it is called *shen* (body). When all images are fully manifest, it is called *xing* (form). When inert and unmoving, it is called *zhi* (substance). When form and appearance are regulated, it is called *ti* (frame). When small and large are distinct, it is called *qu* (trunk). When myriad thoughts cannot grasp it, it is called *shen* (spirit). When vast and transformative, it is called *ling* (numinous). When qi enters the body, it is called *sheng* (life); when qi departs from form, it is called *si* (death). That which pervades life is called the Dao.\n\nThe Dao exists yet has no form; it is formless yet possesses essence. Its transformations are unfathomable, pervading the numinous. All living beings naturally attain their life and sustenance, thus preserving the Dao in its rough outline. They also attain their generation and completion, all of which should be natural and not contrary to principle. You should follow my words to broadly propagate the teachings, without allowing deviant views to arise and disrupt true reality. Exhort others to cultivate the Dao, which is to cultivate the heart. Teach others to cultivate the heart, and the Dao may be seen thereby. The Dao cannot be seen directly—it is seen through the heart. The Dao cannot be heard directly—it is heard through the heart. All hearing and seeing of the Dao arise through the heart. The heart cannot be constant; it is guarded by the Dao. If not guarded by the Dao, and one follows the heart’s hearing and seeing, this is to enter a heterodox school, never to attain liberation or hear the Dharma.\n\nThus, the multitudes of heavenly immortals, the great sages and perfected beings of the heavens, and the countless hosts of celestial perfected ones—having heard my teachings—came to know the Dao. If one can further empty the heart to dispel its substance, be without heart to dispel its existence, stabilize the heart to render it unmoving, still the heart to render it unconfused, rectify the heart to render it unerring, purify the heart to render it unstained, and cleanse the heart to render it unpolluted—you are not unaware of this. Yet you must constantly diligently practice, without allowing retrogression or obstruction. Know that all dharmas should be thus. If, within this, deviant views arise, one strays from the true Dao, loses all insight, and generates separate thoughts, mistaking them for wisdom—confusing body and mind, one turns away from the Dao and harms the true qi.\n\nSuch multitudes, due to their shallow karmic conditions in past lives, create obstructions to the true teaching. I now expound this so that you may all understand the heart, and in turn teach others, guiding their hearts to be upright, without reversal. When the heart is level, without high or low; when the heart is bright, never dim or obscure; when the heart is unobstructed, without hindrance—then, in the purity of body and mind, one awakens to all hearts and perceives all things clearly. Such merit is complete, inconceivable, immeasurable, and perfectly fulfilled.\n\nAnd the gatha says:\nYou who have not seen, have not heard—\nFrom this day forth, all shall see, all shall hear.\nWhen you take refuge in the Dao and practice this,\nPraise its merit, enter the ocean of merit.\nIn non-action, meet the Dao;\nWith mindful resolve, the mind arises.\nBoundless causes and conditions,\nBoundless karmic retribution.\nThe Dharma of non-action\nIs called the name of Dao-perfection.\nUnobstructed liberation—\nThis is the true Dao.\n\n**Talismans of the True One Scripture**\n*Taiqing Realm True One Scripture* concludes here.\n\n**The Supreme Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the Taiqing Realm**\n*Collected Spirits Scripture, Central Essence Scripture, Immeasurable Mind Scripture, Collected Palaces Scripture, Yellow Court Scripture, Lesser Kalpa Scripture*\n*(The above six scriptures share a single scroll)*\n\n**Taiqing Realm Collected Spirits Scripture** (Chapter Seven)\n\nThe Heavenly Perfected Great Sages, the Utmost Perfected Great Spirits, the Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings of the Ten Directions and the Boundless Immeasurable, and all the assembled immortals gather in this place. Now that you have attained the Dao, you should know the supreme and victorious causes, which are the wondrous fruits. Together, turn your merits toward the gathering of spirits to aid the Dao, so that spirit and qi unite as one.\n\nIf you wish to hear these essential principles, you must uphold and practice my teachings, guiding all beings of the future to know my doctrine. All human bodies share the same original nature, yet through the seven emotions and six desires, they harm their fundamental nature and thus fail to hear my Dharma.\n\nNow that you have vowed to deliver all beings, you have gained such immeasurable wisdom and true heart. Cultivate few thoughts, few intentions, few desires, few affairs, few words, few laughs, few sorrows, few joys, few likes, few dislikes. Only then will your spirit-light remain undisturbed, your spirit and qi unconfused, and you may properly follow the Dao.\n\nAmong the multitude, those who think excessively will surely endanger their spirit; those who contemplate excessively will scatter their will; those with many desires will deplete their qi; those entangled in many affairs will exhaust their form; those who speak excessively will weaken their qi; those who laugh excessively will harm their viscera; those who grieve excessively will disperse their blood; those who indulge in excessive joy will cause their qi to overflow; those who rejoice excessively will disorder the hundred spirits; those who rage excessively will unsettle the hundred meridians; those who covet excessively will fall into confusion and disorder; those who hate excessively will become emaciated and joyless. Their original nature will be impure, their studies imprecise, and their qi will scatter of itself.\n\nEven if they encounter an enlightened teacher, they will not comprehend the true principle. Though they may know the methods of nurturing life, they will not awaken to the practice of cultivation. Thus, all they see and hear will not be the true Dao. Though they may understand the intent of refining the spirit, if they do not grasp the essentials of attaining the Dao, all they study and expound will not be the correct teaching.\n\nOne need not speak at length to obtain the Dharma. Therefore, those who cultivate the truth set their minds on the mysterious origin and willingly embrace solitude. Though active, they always appear serene and settled; though settled, they always appear active. When their qi is full and their merit complete, the five qi harmonize and flow smoothly, ascending to the origin. The Three Flowers gather at the crown, blood congeals and qi collects, the ten thousand spirits pay homage to the Perfected, all dwelling in the Upper Palace. There, wealth and honor flourish, pavilions and halls rise in splendor, jade lads and heavenly youths, jade maidens and heavenly maidens, the twelve celestial lads and twelve celestial maidens—all play celestial music, waft incense and flowers, unfurl banners and canopies, array reed pipes and flutes. Such magnificence transcends the mortal world, known as the Supreme Perfected Upper Realm, the Upper Palace of one’s own body.\n\nIf one cannot achieve liberation and remains attached, the hun-soul will scatter and the spirit become disordered. Should even a single thought arise in this state, one will fall into the deluded ford. Those who aspire to higher learning must, at this moment, remain unmoved by all circumstances. Only generate the supreme mind; only cultivate boundless merit. Only generate the supreme mind; only cultivate boundless wisdom. Only generate the supreme mind; only cultivate boundless goodness. Only generate the mind of unobstructed freedom, desiring to widely reach the ten directions, so that all beings of the immeasurable and boundless future may hear the true Dao. Do not arise any greedy thoughts, any perverse views, any delusive dreams, any obstacles, any afflictions, or any defiled attachments to desire.\n\nSuch is the true Dharma—vast beyond conception, beyond description. Only then will one know that the orthodox tradition emerges from the profound and obscure, not seeking petty confirmations that delude the true nature.\n\nAnd the gatha says:\nAll returns to reliance—\nIt is but a single condition.\nIf there is one whose virtue and conduct are complete,\nWho abandons the mind of action and generates the intent of non-action,\nWho does not distance themselves from revered virtue,\nNor draw near to the unkind,\nWho contemplates the Three Treasures without ceasing,\nNever wavering in resolve,\nAll practices perfected,\nVirtue fully attained,\nThe Dao accomplished without defilement or hindrance—\nYou should know this scripture thus.\n\n**Talismans of the Collected Spirits Scripture**\n*Taiqing Realm Collected Spirits Scripture* concludes here.\n\n**Taiqing Realm Central Essence Scripture** (Chapter Eight)\n\nAt that time, wishing to illuminate the true Dao, I emitted a five-colored radiant light, pervading the three thousand great thousand worlds. Within it, all manner of different worlds, heavens and hells, were fully revealed. The Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions and all the Great Perfected Immortals were also seen within it. The sufferings and joys of birth and death, the measure of karmic retribution, the stages of Daoist cultivation—all were seen within it. The lands of suffering and bliss were likewise revealed.\n\nThe assembly from the ten directions, as numerous as motes of dust and beyond counting, all beheld this radiant light. The boundless, immeasurable sufferings of hell-beings were also seen within this light. Then, the True Person of the Great Ultimate, through the power of great compassion, great mercy, and great wisdom, took pity on sentient beings, seeing their differing experiences of suffering and joy, the varying karmic retributions of heavens and hells. He only wished that the Heavenly Worthy, the Utmost Sage, would proclaim the teaching for the sake of all, delivering great benefit, enabling liberation, forever severing evil conditions, and swiftly rebirth in the Pure Land.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy addressed the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, saying: \"Now, by means of my qi, transform your bodies and descend to the Eastern Direction. If the people of a kalpa see the world’s suffering, then say: *The Heavenly Worthy of Jade Purity, who Bestows Blessings, delivers all from calamity.* For the wandering souls of the departed who have not yet transcended rebirth, say: *The Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure, Supreme August One, delivers all from stagnation.* In the Southern Direction, the Heavenly Worthy who Prolongs Life and Augments Destiny saves the living; the Heavenly Worthy of Mysterious Perfection and Myriad Blessings delivers the dead. In the Western Direction, the Heavenly Worthy of the Eight Trigrams who Protects the Body saves the living; the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Mystery delivers the dead...\"\n\nIn the Northern Direction, the Heavenly Worthy who Dispels Disasters and Resolves Misfortunes saves the living; the Heavenly Worthy of Mysterious Supreme Jade Dawn delivers the dead. In the Northeastern Direction, the Heavenly Worthy of Purple Purity who Bestows Blessings saves the living; the Heavenly Worthy who Delivers Immortals and Supreme Sages delivers the dead. In the Southeastern Direction, the Heavenly Worthy of Longevity who Protects Life saves the living; the Heavenly Worthy of Compassionate Deliverance delivers the dead. In the Southwestern Direction, the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Blessings saves the living; the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Numinous Emptiness delivers the dead. In the Northwestern Direction, the Heavenly Worthy of the Nine Palaces who Shields from Misfortune saves the living; the Heavenly Worthy of Infinite Great Splendor delivers the dead. In the Upper Direction, the Heavenly Worthy who Protects Life and Guards the Body saves the living; the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Emptiness and Luminous Sovereignty delivers the dead. In the Lower Direction, the Heavenly Worthy who Augments Great Blessings saves the living; the Heavenly Worthy of the Grotto Spirits and True Sovereign delivers the dead.\n\nThe life of all people is born of the qi of Heaven. In the true north, the Central One qi generates water, and all things are born through water. Thus, the Northern Dipper resides at the center of Heaven, revolving through the Four Directions, governing the life, death, fortune, and misfortune of all people. The first star of the Northern Dipper, Greedy Wolf, and the third star, Wealth Repository, form the Eastern Dipper, which governs destiny. The second star, Great Gate, and the fourth star, Literary Brilliance, form the Western Dipper, which records names. The sixth star, Military Brilliance, rightfully occupies its position as the Northern Dipper, presiding over death. The fifth star, Integrity and Chastity, forms the Southern Dipper, which bestows life. The seventh star, Breaking Army, rightfully occupies the central position as the Great Chief of the Central Dipper, overseeing all spirits. All things in the myriad realms, in life and death, belong to the Northern Dipper. The External Assistant stars encircle it, the Hidden Origin stars inwardly assist it, and they point to the twelve earthly branches. When saving the living, they are collectively called the Jade Armillary Sphere; when delivering the dead, they are collectively called the Vast and Open. If sentient beings encounter disasters or misfortunes, they may perform expiatory rites, offer prayers, and hold jiao rituals according to the direction, and no good deed will go unanswered.\n\nThen a gatha is spoken:\nBy this essential Dharma,\ndisseminated throughout the world,\nif there are those who see or hear,\nboundless karmic conditions arise.\nGood men and faithful women,\npractice in accordance with these affairs.\nCultivate the practice of equality,\nwith minds filled with joy.\nThose who practice thus,\nwill all attain accomplishment,\nrightly entering the non-action,\nand the unretreatable karmic conditions.\nAll sentient beings,\nshould believe these words,\nreceive this true teaching,\nand diligently uphold it.\n\nThe *Essential Scripture of the Grotto Spirits from the Taiqing Realm* concludes here.\n\nThe *Taiqing Realm Scripture of the Thirty-Six Venerable Scriptures*, Volume Three:\n*The Scripture of Gathering Spirits*, *The Scripture of Central Essence*, *The Scripture of Immeasurable Meaning*, *The Scripture of Gathering Palaces*, *The Scripture of the Yellow Court*, and *The Scripture of the Lesser Kalpa*—the above six scriptures are contained in a single scroll.\n\n**The Scripture of Immeasurable Meaning from the Taiqing Realm, Ninth Chapter**\n\nWhen I expound the Dharma, I shall speak to you thus: you must remain silent, settle your spirits, and cast aside all distracting thoughts, only then may you hear this Dharma.\n\nThe Dharma is fundamentally without Dharma; its principle returns to spontaneity. The mind, disturbed by circumstances, gives rise to the notion of establishing Dharma.\n\nYou should generate such vast, inconceivable, and immeasurable good causes, and not entertain divergent views.\n\nIn the Jade Purity Realm, I do not speak of all Dharmas. The Dharma categories of the Highest Purity Realm consist of eighteen gates illuminating seven stages. The Dharma categories of the Great Purity Realm consist of twenty gates illuminating nine stages.\n\nThe Orthodox Categories of the Numinous Treasure do not speak of all Dharmas. The Auxiliary Categories of the Numinous Treasure consist of fifty gates illuminating thirty-six categories. The Dharma categories of the Jade Void consist of twenty gates illuminating one stage, including esoteric methods of altar divination and augury.\n\nThe Dharma sections of the Northern Culmen of Heaven comprise twelve stages and categories. The seventh category, the *Illumination of the Four Sages*, also pertains to the third category of Fengdu, hence it is called the *Fengdu Summons and Inquisition*. The *Illumination of the Four Sages* and Fengdu together comprise twelve categories.\n\nThe seventh category, the *Three-Five Conjoint Illumination*, pertains to spirit possession. The fifth category of Fengdu pertains to summons and inquisition. The *Illumination of the Four Sages* comprises seven stages, the *Fengdu Illumination* five categories, and the *Numinous Writings Below the Dipper* thirty-six gates illuminating four stages, including mirror-water incense illumination, *Three-Five Paper Illumination*, and *Fengdu Earth Illumination*—all serve universal purposes.\n\nCultivators of the Dao who have not yet attained the wondrous realm should generate such a mind, delivering all living beings, concentrating their thoughts on the utmost truth, without arousing greed or seeking karmic rewards. Through gradual accumulation and long practice, they may gradually enter the initial vehicle.\n\nIf, within the Dharma, they again generate greed and craving, they will lose the true Way and incur immeasurable transgressions.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Perfected Great Spirits, the Utmost Perfected Great Spirits, the Immeasurable Flying Heavenly Great Spirits, and all the sagely hosts of the heavens, having heard this exposition, each rejoiced and spoke thus: If there are Dao-adherents who can generate such a mind, desiring to deliver all beings from suffering, we shall transform our bodies and descend, commanding the great generals of the heavens and the divine officers and soldiers of the ten directions and four quarters to assist in upholding the Dharma, enabling all sentient beings and the immeasurable beings of the six paths and four births to prolong their lives, the dead to revive, the sick to recover, and ghosts, demons, and malevolent spirits to attain liberation. Enmities and grudges shall each be dissolved. Such benefits are indeed inconceivable.\n\nHaving thus generated good thoughts, they bowed their heads in reverence and gave thanks.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy then addressed the great assembly, saying: You are fortunate from past lives, having been born among humans and gods, enjoying all pleasures, clothed in celestial silks, and nourished by sweet dew. You are free from the cold and heat of the four seasons, from the darkness of day and night, and from the names of birth, old age, sickness, death, the three evil destinies, and the eight difficulties. The earth is level as a mirror, adorned with the seven treasures. The bodies you receive are pure in the six senses, unstained by the six dusts, and you constantly hear me expound the Dharma, increasing your wisdom.\n\nNow, having generated the mind of supreme wisdom, desiring to deliver all beings from suffering and enable all sentient beings to hear the Dharma, this is the greatest benefit.\n\nOnly those of meager merit, whose roots of faith are weak, though they hear this Dharma, encounter many obstacles, sinking into the苦 realms with no hope of escape. Such persons are difficult to deliver.\n\nThen a gatha is spoken:\nBehold the people of the world,\nall their obstacles and difficulties,\nthe afflictions of vexation—\nhard indeed to describe.\nUnknowing of turning toward the good,\nthey accumulate day and night,\nand having once obtained,\nagain generate greed and craving.\nThe various transgressions,\nimmeasurable and boundless.\nSome encounter grave illness,\ndying in vain.\nAfter death,\nthey return to the wheel of suffering.\nIf they do not hear the Dharma,\nthey shall never awaken.\nThe *Numinous Talismans of the Scripture of Immeasurable Meaning*\n**The Scripture of Immeasurable Meaning from the Taiqing Realm concludes here.**\n\n**The Scripture of Gathering Palaces from the Taiqing Realm, Tenth Chapter**\n\nWhen I expound the Dharma, all the gods and immortals of the heavens, all the great perfected ones, and all the sagely hosts, through the wondrous Dharma, shall attain lofty and luminous wisdom, becoming of one kind without distinction. Their countenances shall be subtle and wondrous, their Dao-conduct spontaneous, their voices harmonious and refined. Their palaces and abodes shall vary in height as they wish. At the arising of a thought, immeasurable jeweled nets and all manner of jeweled trees shall fully cover the ground. A natural, pure wind shall blow through the jeweled nets and trees, producing subtle and wondrous sounds. Those who encounter this wind shall find all their toils and defilements stilled. As the wind brushes their bodies, they shall naturally attain coolness and immeasurable bliss. Fragrant flowers shall scatter and fill the ground, arranged in order of color without confusion. In that realm, the limitless Perfected Ones shall abide.\n\nAll the perfected ones, heavenly immortals, and great spirits shall each emit hundreds and thousands of rays of light, universally expounding the wondrous Dharma for the dust-mote worlds of the ten directions, universally delivering sentient beings.\n\nIf there are those whose right wisdom is complete and who are born in that realm, they shall immediately abide in right concentration. According to the gravity of their evil karma, they shall be taught the superior, middle, or lesser vehicles, each according to their wisdom and vows.\n\nAt that time, the immeasurable perfected ones and immortals of the ten directions shall all come to this place to reverently make offerings, listen to the scriptural Dharma, and propagate the transformation of the Dao.\n\nAll sentient beings who come to this realm and arrive at its palaces shall possess wisdom.\n\nAt that time, the perfected ones and immortals, by virtue of the immeasurable power of great merit, the immeasurable power of great wisdom, and the immeasurable power of great spiritual penetrations, shall come and go without obstruction, pervading the immeasurable worlds of the ten directions. They shall spontaneously transform and manifest, arriving as soon as a thought arises.\n\nThe perfected ones emit wondrous sounds, extolling virtuous deeds. As they listen to the scriptural Dharma, their joy is boundless. They tread upon the void, walking through emptiness, and those who hear them find their minds opened and their understanding liberated, attaining the right fruit in accord with these virtuous sounds.\n\nThen a gentle breeze arises, and from the seven-jeweled trees issue subtle and wondrous tones, playing the celestial melodies of the gods. Spontaneous bliss arises, beyond all description.\n\nThe teachings expounded are of vast meaning, benefiting all sentient beings. In that realm, there is no self, no person—only purity, non-action, and wisdom ever triumphant. Such is the reward they attain.\n\nYet if there are those who, though born in human form, lack wisdom, their roots of faith feeble, who never hear the true Dharma nor behold the wondrous Dao, their reward is thus—due to the shallowness of their past accumulations.\n\nThereupon, the Perfected of Supreme Truth, the Celestial Perfected of Supreme Truth, and the immeasurable flying celestial spirits, having heard these words, all arise in reverence. They bow their heads, kneel in obeisance, and address the Heavenly Worthy, saying: \"We, having received the gift of your teaching, have gained such benefit. We humbly beseech your great compassion to broadly extend salvation and protection, that all who have not yet heard may hear, and all who have not yet seen may see. May all sentient beings suffering in affliction attain liberation.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: \"Excellent! You have aroused this virtuous aspiration—such merit is inconceivable. Now, for your sake, I shall proclaim the true Dharma and the various rites of offering and repentance, that on the days of *jiǎzǐ*, *gēngshēn*, the Three Primes, the Eight Festivals, one’s life-destiny day, and birthdays, you may pray for blessings, repent of transgressions, and avert calamities, all attaining joy together.\"\n\nThen he spoke in verse:\n*\"I reveal this Dharma,*\n*Speaking thus directly.\"*\n\nWith hearts filled with joy, all manner of afflictions are swiftly dispelled, and one’s condition returns to its original state. All dharmas are likewise—yet there is nothing to be gained, nothing to be gained? What then is gained? Is there truly no attainment?\n\nThe wise attain through wisdom; with each thought, this mind constantly savors the flavor of the Dharma, advancing in diligence and attaining sagacity.\n\n*Collected Palace Scripture of the Numinous Talismans*\n*End of the Collected Palace Scripture of the Supreme Clarity Realm*\n\n*Supreme Thirty-Six Sections of the Venerable Scriptures*\n*Scripture of the Supreme Clarity Realm (Lower Section)*\n*Scripture of the Collected Numinous. Scripture of the Essence of the Center. Scripture of Immeasurable Meaning. Collected Palace Scripture. Scripture of the Yellow Court. Scripture of the Lesser Kalpa*\n*(The above six scriptures share the same scroll)*\n\n*The Scripture of the Yellow Court of the Supreme Clarity Realm (Chapter Eleven)*\n\nBeings take diverse forms, yet their birth arises from a single qi. The hun-soul is received from Heaven, while the body and po-soul are received from Earth. Without form or image, they come from the emptiness of space, merely borrowing father and mother to transform non-being into being. After three hundred days, the fetus is complete; once the gestation is fulfilled, birth occurs—thus does non-being become being.\n\nTherefore, the spirit takes qi as its mother, and qi takes form as its dwelling. Refining qi gives rise to spirit; refining form returns it to qi. If the yang-spirit has not gathered, the Three Flowers will not enter the Mud Pill Palace. If the true qi has not ascended, the Five Colors will not arise in the Cinnabar Field.\n\nThus, though Heaven and Earth are vast, they cannot escape the signs of light purity and heavy turbidity. Though the sun and moon are bright, they cannot avoid the forms of waxing fullness and waning darkness. The accumulation of yang gives birth to spirit, which ascends to adorn Heaven as stars and constellations. The accumulation of yin gives birth to form, which descends to strengthen Earth as soil and stone.\n\nWithin water, qi rises, becoming mist and clouds. Within qi, water descends, becoming rain and dew. All phenomena and myriad beings cannot be without form; they gather numinosity to live and rely on the Dao to be perfected.\n\nThus, below the Three Clarities are the Three Supremes; within the Three Supremes are the Two Modes. Once the Two Modes are divided, the Five Emperors are arrayed; once the Five Emperors are established, they unite in a single realm. Within this Heaven and Earth, the qi of above and below—only in humans is essence the mother and qi the master. Each of the five viscera contains essence, and from essence qi is born. Each of the five viscera contains qi, and from qi spirit is born. Spirit can generate longevity, preserving life and destiny.\n\nRefine essence into the elixir; nurture qi into spirit. True immortals and sagely beings cultivate truth and nurture qi, naturally and spontaneously, with inner reality responding to outer signs. What they undertake is surely accomplished, ascending from the mundane to the sacred.\n\nIn the birth of a male, the right kidney forms first, enclosing external essence within internal blood—this is the wrapping of yin. In the birth of a female, the left kidney forms first, enclosing external blood within internal essence—this is the wrapping of yang.\n\nThe kidneys generate the spleen; the spleen generates the liver; the liver generates the lungs; the lungs generate the heart; the heart generates the small intestine; the small intestine generates the large intestine; the large intestine generates the gallbladder; the gallbladder generates the stomach; the stomach generates the inner kidneys; the inner kidneys generate the bladder; the bladder generates the Three Primes; the Three Primes generate the Triple Burner; the Triple Burner generates the Eight Vessels; the Eight Vessels generate the Twelve Channels; the Twelve Channels generate the Fifteen Collaterals; the Fifteen Collaterals generate one hundred eighty subsidiary collaterals; one hundred eighty subsidiary collaterals generate one hundred eighty encircling collaterals; one hundred eighty encircling collaterals generate thirty-six thousand grandchild collaterals; thirty-six thousand grandchild collaterals generate three hundred sixty-five bones; three hundred sixty-five bones generate eighty-four thousand hair pores.\n\nOnce the gestation is complete, the numinous radiance enters the body, and the child separates from the mother to become a person. Speaking of inner and outer: within the channels and collaterals is the inner; beyond the muscles and skin is the outer.\n\nTo nurture life is to nurture the five viscera, for the five viscera are the root—when the root is firm, the leaves flourish of themselves. To nurture form is to nurture the five qi, for the five qi are the source—when the source runs deep, the flow lengthens of itself.\n\nThe great circulation of true qi follows the primordial qi of Heaven; the minor circulation of true qi follows the primordial qi of the sun. Among the five viscera, the kidneys are the sea of essence, and the heart is the palace of qi. True essence resides in the kidneys, while surplus essence naturally returns to the lower Cinnabar Field. True qi resides in the heart, while surplus qi naturally ascends to the middle Prime, all converging in the true scene of the Yellow Court.\n\nThen he spoke in verse:\n*\"Contemplate the Dao and leave the household,*\n*Guiding and receiving sentient beings,*\n*That they may escape suffering*\n*And hear the teachings of the Dao.*\n*Bestowing benefit upon all,*\n*Immeasurable multitudes of beings,*\n*Attaining great spiritual power,*\n*All from the perfection of the Dao.*\n*Gaining fearlessness,*\n*Supernormal powers and freedom,*\n*Coming and going, returning,*\n*Without obstruction.*\n*Thus exists this Dharma,*\n*To ferry across the multitudes.*\n*Recognize the root of the Dharma,*\n*And the causes for entering the Dao.\"*\n\n*Numinous Talismans of the Scripture of the Yellow Court*\n*End of the Scripture of the Yellow Court of the Supreme Clarity Realm*\n\nThe *Supreme Clarity Realm Scriptures of the Thirty-Six Venerable Canons: The Lower Scrolls*—*Scripture of the Assembly of Numinous Beings*, *Scripture of Central Essence*, *Scripture of Immeasurable Intent*, *Scripture of the Assembly of Palaces*, *Scripture of the Yellow Court*, and *Scripture of the Lesser Kalpa*. The above six scriptures share a single scroll.\n\n*Scripture of the Lesser Kalpa of the Supreme Clarity Realm* – Chapter Twelve\n\nHeaven and earth divide their forms and undergo transformations, revolving in accord with the reckoning of qi, thus giving rise to prosperity and adversity. The sun and moon revolve by virtue of heaven and earth, hence their brightness and dimness, fullness and waning; the constellations likewise follow their celestial paths, thus some halt while others proceed. Since humans receive the qi of heaven and earth to come into being, how could they be without calamity or fortune?\n\nTherefore, I expound the Dharma, ever urging you to broadly proclaim the true Dao, illuminating its essential teachings, that all the heavens and immortals, the immeasurable flying devas and great spirits, and the boundless assemblies of sages may together arise in praise, attaining the hearing of this teaching.\n\nThen the one above addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: \"I venture to ask—when the people below encounter calamity or adversity, what meritorious deeds should they perform, what practices should they cultivate, to escape all suffering and affliction and realize the supreme Dao?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: \"If one seeks all forms of liberation, to forever escape the cycle of rebirth and depart from the snares of doubt, there is nothing but to reverently recite and turn the scriptural texts, cultivate all meritorious deeds, perform prostrations and repentance, offer praise and extolment, burn incense and light lamps, fashion the Ten Absolute Banners, circumambulate and lecture on the scriptures, distribute alms to the poor and destitute, and liberate all living beings. Let the six desires and seven emotions remain ever unstained; let the three karmas and six senses never again be enacted. With concentrated thought and serene stillness, cast aside all distracting thoughts. Thus may one be reborn in the celestial realms, delighting in bliss and freedom, born into the halls of great fortune.\n\nIf there are those who suffer from illness, official entanglements, imprisonment in cangues and fetters, ensnarement in nets, pestilential toxins, seasonal epidemics, or prolonged misfortune—who find no means of escape—and if the consciousness of the departed still lingers in the depths, enduring the torments of hell, the merit of this scripture is indeed immeasurable. If one further broadly arouses the true heart, widely bestows the power of blessings, establishes Daoist altars, hangs banners and canopies, observes purification and repentance, and arranges vegetarian feasts, extending these to all the six paths and four modes of birth, to the host of orphaned souls and lingering spirits without refuge, to offer deliverance and salvation—if one does so with day and night reverence, with a sincere heart and earnest prayers—then all suffering and misfortune shall be dispelled in due time.\n\nThe immeasurable perfected ones bow their heads in praise, all acclaiming the excellent fruit, the benefit to sentient beings, and the great supernormal powers—such as these are indeed difficult to encounter even in a hundred thousand kalpas.\n\nThe intent of this scripture comprises seven aspects:\n1. **Attainment through wisdom**—each thought is the heart-mind;\n2. **Understanding through practice**—seeking the Dao and leaving the household;\n3. **Manifest benefit**—guiding and receiving sentient beings;\n4. **Beneficial application**—contemplating the sages;\n5. **Wisdom**—attaining great spiritual power;\n6. **Attainment of power**—gaining fearlessness;\n7. **Virtue fulfilled**—supernormal powers and freedom.\n\nThese seven aspects allow coming and going, returning without obstruction, thus possessing such subtlety and wonder. They serve as the medicinal Dharma for all sentient beings, delivering them from all calamities, illnesses, and sufferings.\n\nIf good men and women can attain understanding, receive the true and authentic discourse, recognize the fundamental power of the great Dharma, and enter the causes for the great Dao, then from the place of their thoughts, they shall gain immeasurable causes and conditions, attain the supreme, most true, and great wisdom—profound and wondrous beyond conception.\n\nFrom beginning to end, uphold and maintain this without slackening, forever preserving it without end. By practicing thus, all shall return to their true nature. The application shall yield profound and far-reaching effects, with true and real responses, boundless and unlimited.\n\nReveal to all sentient beings the power of such expedient means.\n\nThen he spoke in verse:\n*\"The supreme Dao is all-pervading,*\n*Equal and without obstruction.*\n*What the Great Vehicle practices,*\n*The Lesser Vehicle employs.*\n*Neither false nor real,*\n*Neither existent nor nonexistent.*\n*Turning the Wheel of Dharma,*\n*From beginning to end, it is accomplished.*\n*Only wondrous appearances exist,*\n*Non-action yet nothing left undone.*\n*Immeasurable causes and conditions,*\n*Sometimes departing, sometimes arriving.*\n*Thus is right awakening attained,*\n*Truly the wondrous body.*\n*All become subtle and marvelous,*\n*All arising from vows.\"*\n\n*Numinous Talismans of the Scripture of the Lesser Kalpa*\n*End of the Scripture of the Lesser Kalpa of the Supreme Clarity Realm*",

Cultivating the mind, cultivating all dharmas, it is foremost in courage and vigor among all learners—unfathomable, wondrous, like the supreme Dao, beyond all comparison, vast as the great sea, equal to empty space.\n\nCountless devas and great sages, innumerable perfected ones and divine spirits, all rejoiced and spoke thus, desiring to seek the supreme, correct, and wondrous Dharma.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"You dwell in the realm of empty equality, difficult to surpass, where there is no perception of father or mother, brothers or kin, acquaintances, sisters, children, or those of love and hate—just as empty space has no father or mother, no brothers, and even no sentient beings or lifespans. All dharmas are likewise. With a mind of equality, benefiting many, like empty space itself—why? Because by practicing virtue and skillfully cultivating all the dharmas of emptiness, the inner dharma of emptiness is attained: constant bliss, true self, purity, and fearlessness.\n\nWithin this inner dharma, though the nature of the Dao exists, this nature is neither inner nor outer, neither above nor below, neither existent nor nonexistent. Its true nature is eternal, unchanging—this is called the true teaching. Observing inner emptiness, outer emptiness, and the emptiness of the original nature of all dharmas—impermanent, suffering and joyful, pure and impure—this is called the correct Dharma.\n\nYou, all boundless and immeasurable holy assemblies, perfected ones, divine spirits, and devas, constantly penetrate the wondrous principle herein, broadly extending it to all—those present now, those of the past, and those of the future—so that they may attain this gate of emptiness, profound beyond profundity, and dwell in empty space.\n\nWhen I spoke of these meanings of emptiness among the great assembly, hundreds of thousands of millions of beings, upon hearing this teaching, immediately dwelt in the dharma equal to empty space. Having abided in this realm, they were free from all obstructions, fetters, and attachments in all dharmas, their minds without confusion or distress, constantly delighting in freedom, pure and without action.\n\nFor this reason, all dharmas are named equal to empty space. Just as empty space does not generate greed for lovely forms, nor anger toward unloved forms, so too, having dwelt in this realm, are you all likewise. In all dharmas, you see and know. Whether in action, conditions, causes, roots, essences, thoughts, vehicles, encounters with good teachers, upholding precepts, or practicing generosity—all such dharmas are fully known and seen, leading to the supreme liberation, most profound.\n\nThe wisdom of their practice sees all beings who commit unwholesome acts, inevitably falling into hells, enduring boundless suffering. Knowing beings who emerge from hells and are born among humans—if they practice generosity and fulfill all virtues—such givers will surely enter correct liberation. This is called the correct, true, and wondrous Dharma.\n\nThere is also seeing and knowing. What is this seeing?\"",

      "translated_text": "*The Wondrous Grove Scripture of the Jade-Pure Realm, Chapter Four*\n\nThe great Dharma-seas are boundless and infinite, pervading the Dharma-realm without end. The roots of all dharmas and their meritorious virtues are none other than the limitless wisdom of the Heavenly Honored One—truly, this cause cannot be fathomed by the wise or the sagely.\n\nThose who attain this Dharma encounter no hindrance, no wavering, no fear. Within a single Dharma, myriad scriptures arise under countless names; even expounded for kalpas unnumbered, its perfection cannot be exhausted. This Dharma cannot be grasped by wisdom, nor can it be known by sagacity. It is supremely wondrous, beyond the reach of hearing.\n\nAll ordinary beings cling to form, and in clinging to form, greed arises. Thus they are bound, unable to escape birth, aging, sickness, death, sorrow, lamentation, and the great suffering of all afflictions. For this reason, those who hear this Dharma are delivered from all calamities, and measureless beings together attain liberation.\n\nIf one, throughout a lifetime, accumulates heavy karmic obstructions and grave retribution yet never hears this Dharma, they are said to be enwrapped by demons and ghosts, unable to speak of it even at life’s end. But if they relinquish attachment, they break free from demonic entanglement.\n\nIt is like a guilty person in the world, shackled by officials; the innocent, however, are not bound. So too with all of you: those who cling are enwrapped by demons, while those who cling to nothing find demons and ghosts far removed. They abide in freedom, naturally detached from all forms and characteristics, liberated from the nets of dust. No afflictions remain, no obstructions persist—they attain mastery of the Dharma. Thus do all benefits arise.\n\nFrom the Dao comes the Dharma, without alternative teachings, without divergent thoughts. Desire naturally fades, and true quiescence is realized. All dharmas are subtly radiant, resplendent as priceless treasures, beyond measure.\n\nIf you see or hear of this, teach others in turn, employing skillful means so that all may encounter the profound and wondrous meaning of these true words. Let those who deeply believe receive and uphold them. Countless beings will arouse the unsurpassed mind of the Dao, and thereafter be revered by all gods, honored and venerated in ways beyond conception. Truly awakened and clear, they shatter all doubts, discern truth from falsehood, and enter the unfathomable mystery.\n\nAt that time, hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of true immortals and Dao-masters will be seated among them, upholding the true Dharma. They will have perfected boundless mastery of the six penetrations and great wisdom, turning the Wheel of Dharma to the realm of non-action—an unsurpassed, perfectly true, inconceivable, and inexpressible state.\n\nThose who attain the highest truth will perceive below them the boundless forms of all lands, guiding and receiving beings without the slightest pause. If one arouses the unsurpassed mind of the Dao, practicing myriad benefits and limitless wisdom, further upholding the fruits of the Dao—though their form is without appearance, its principle is most real; though its name is without substance, its function is most real. Those who know this Dharma enjoy long life. Their cultivation of merit is tireless, and at this time they constantly exhort all beings: do not harbor thoughts of resentment, do not indulge in desire, abandon all greed and attachment, all dreamlike delusions, all perverse views. Thus they attain the true and complete nature of reality.\n\nAnd a verse says:\nIf perverse views arise,\nit is because they do not believe in emptiness.",

Therefore, within this Dharma, teachings are broadly proclaimed to instruct all beings in cultivating merit and virtue. If you act thus within this Dharma, you shall attain long life. Why is this so? By skillfully knowing causes and conditions and all expedient methods, you plant roots of goodness for all future beings, enabling them to understand that all dharmas are provisionally arisen to ferry beings across. Thus, all in the world diligently practice the three karmas and cultivate the fruits of blessed action. Then, ten immortals and ninety-six kinds of beings, together with their retinues, all come forth, assembling in the same Dao-field to accomplish merit and virtue.\n\nWithin this, if one tames the mind, then even externally, one constantly seeks merit with a single mind. When this Dharma was expounded, those who heard these matters rejoiced in their hearts. Each turned to the other, their voices choked with emotion, saying: “Such guidance has never been before—hard to encounter indeed!” At that time, immeasurable perfected supreme sages, transcendent great spirits, boundless perfected ones, and limitless holy assemblies—extending throughout the ten directions and the great encompassing Dharma-realm—such multitudes could not all be recorded. By virtue of past conditions, they now met in assembly, all seated together. Each reflected inwardly, contemplating the sutra’s Dharma, seeking the Dharma-body, relinquishing what is hard to relinquish. Again, through sound they chanted the sagely virtues, offering incense and flowers in praise of all practices, all perfectly fulfilling their intentions as offerings to the supreme venerable ones. At that moment, all entered fragrant purity, attaining unobstructed liberation, gaining the inconceivable, obtaining good karmic retribution, constantly abiding in the Dharma-wheel, entering the stage of non-retrogression, and ever dwelling in the Dharma-realm.\n\nHaving received these matters, their minds, upon hearing the Dharma, understood suffering, emptiness, impermanence, and non-self; and the constant, bliss, self, and purity. Having heard the Dharma, each led their retinues back to their original lands. Within this assembly, some attained liberation, realizing the wondrous principle, grasping the root of the Dharma, the twelve links of dependent origination, and discerning the three characteristics. As they saw the Dharma being expounded, they attained the Dao and its fruits, causes and conditions, boundless wondrous penetrations, wheeling spirits into samādhi, and expounding the wisdom of the untainted. With skillful faith in expedient means, they called this great compassion, entering the samādhi of emptiness and quiescence—beyond thought and discussion.\n\nWithin this assembly, some were able to master rare Dharma, elucidating the essentials of liberation amidst the assembly—most difficult to attain, most difficult to attain, the profound meaning. Each in the great assembly was courageous and exuberant, rejoicing and leaping with joy, praising without limit, all extolling the karmic retribution. At this time, they reverently listened to the venerable one, the supreme Dharma most excellent, awakening to what was yet to be awakened. Never before had they seen such majestic conduct in great compassion and great mercy, all equal in demeanor. They aroused understanding of what was unknown, along with its methods and remedies. Such rare and hard-won fruits—immediately, they and their retinues should relinquish what is hard to relinquish, exhorting all others to together arouse this unsurpassed, unattainable mind, lest regretful thoughts arise. All equally, at that moment, adorned vast seats with a hundred treasures of every kind.\n\nOnce the adornments were complete, the assembly bowed their heads in reverence, inquiring and prostrating, gazing upon the compassionate countenance. Each lamented their past lives’ misfortune, now having heard this teaching. Extolling the great compassion, they widely proclaimed it, and spoke this verse:\n\nSupreme Perfected, limitless virtue’s culmination,\nQuiescent realm, most exalted and wondrous,\nWithin the limitless, the honored one—\nI attained immortality through the Dao.\nSupreme Great Dao, without past or present,\nWithout going or coming, without thought or conception,\nConstantly with right teaching, instructing all in the world,\nAll attain good fruits, the greatest benefit,\nWithout hatred or attachment, together receiving wondrous power.\n\n*Transformation Sutra, Numinous Talismans*\n*Transformation Sutra of the Jade Pure Realm* **Concludes**",

Within the Three Realms and throughout the world, how could such a thing exist? How could it be conceived? I am unworthy of its excellence.\n\nThen all the perfected great sages, the boundless divine spirits, and the assembly of holy beings spoke: \"We and our retinues have come from afar. If even the Divine Lord deigns to reveal these secret and essential words, it is like the sun and moon whose light knows no concealment. We, with our retinues, take refuge and bow at your feet. We only pray that you, in your compassion, accept our shared resolve to follow and uphold your teachings. Should we fail in this, our hearts and vows shall ever remain reverent.\"\n\nAt that moment, their hearts again sighed in awe, humbled before such honor. The essential words they had received could never be fully expounded, nor could they be grasped even by the vastness of empty space—most difficult, most difficult. Yet in this difficulty, by the grace of the great assembly, they were called to expound the teaching. They thought to themselves, \"I dare not remain silent. If I do not proclaim these words, future generations will not attain good fruit; without good fruit, they will not cultivate the field of merit. If I do not reveal the words entrusted to me—this profound and secret Dharma—disobeying the command of the exalted ones, then at this very moment I shall witness their majesty: the celestial spirits in attendance, the divine dragons bearing their chariots, the hundred thousand kinds of arts and harmonies, all arising at once.\"\n\nThen the foremost seat began to recite the various Dharma teachings, exclaiming: \"Profound is the Dao, most subtle and empty, vast and boundless as the abyss. Those who do not believe are like the heavens in drought—no flowers or fruits arise, nor any beings of water or land, all wither and fade, devoid of moisture, unable to grow. All herbs lose their potency. So too are those who lack faith: they wither of their own accord, without blame from others.\n\n\"Yet if one initially holds faith but does not firmly establish it, it is like spring blossoms when they first open: swarms of bees arrive, drawn by their color, fragrance, and delicate sweetness, never sated. But when the blossoms fall, the bees depart. So too are those whose faith is not steadfast.\n\n\"Among this assembly, O good retinues, you have heard this Mahāyāna sutra, an immeasurable and inconceivable gathering of virtues. That you now follow the ways of the world and speak thus is most rare. Excellent! In the ages to come, may this sutra spread widely, showering the great Dharma rain to fill every place, complete and unobstructed, bringing benefit and peace to all beings.\n\n\"It is like gold hidden in sand: only after refining away the impurities and smelting it does it become true gold, priceless in value. Or like a merchant possessing a jewel beyond price who takes it to market to sell. A fool sees it and asks the owner, ‘What is the price of this jewel?’ The owner replies, ‘Its value is hundreds of millions.’ Hearing this, the fool scolds, ‘What is this thing? You deceive me—this is no jewel!’ They say to one another, ‘This is not real treasure.’ So too are those who do not believe in the Dharma.\n\n\"O good assembly, you are like those fools who do not recognize true treasure. So too are those among you who, though they hear this Dharma, lack true faith—like one who recognizes a treasure but has no means to acquire it.

Both humans and heavenly beings take refuge in it without end. In all present and future ages, it equally bestows the inherent true nature. If in past lives one has not yet heard the Dharma, now all may naturally return to the teaching, free from obstruction.\n\nShould one leave the household life to follow the Dao, knowing faith and devotion, thereby nurturing growth—once the body is thus nurtured, yet the nature of the Dharma remains unrecognized, one may indulge in frivolous speech, flattery, and deceit, forcibly seeking fame and honor, hoping for others’ reverence. Yet what is gained? How can one benefit others? Though one may claim that leaving the household life brings clarity to the true nature, one remains deluded, like a blind man who sees nothing, leading others astray, deepening confusion without awareness.\n\nIf one practices generosity, it is met with forced praise, all born of greed and devoid of true benefit. In every thought, affliction arises without respite. As the saying goes: \"The Dao speaks with a single voice,\" yet each being, each assembly, is complete in itself, each attaining liberation. All praise it, yet fail to awaken to their own nature.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy then addressed the assembly: \"When I expound the Dharma, I first enable all to illuminate their original nature, then instruct them to uphold it as I have taught. For this reason, all Dharmas become luminous, and in turn, one teaches others.\"\n\nThose beings who receive this teaching are like children finding their parents. Thus, in all praise of this wondrous Dharma, virtue increases like the waters of the great ocean, endlessly circulating. Upon hearing these words, the great assembly rejoiced. Such rare and wondrous causes and conditions moved all retinues who heard the Dharma to exclaim its rarity. Even those who had not heard or understood before now grasped it fully, gaining immeasurable benefit. From this resolve, all attained true perfection.\n\nThe immortal youths and attendants, with hundreds of thousands of musicians, offered myriad fragrant flowers and received their karmic rewards, all entering the fruit of the great teaching, the unconditioned. \"You, the present assembly and those of future ages, must wholly abandon evil deeds and practice the true Dharma, shunning evil and embracing goodness, renouncing worldly pleasures to seek the Dao—these are my true disciples. Such right conduct is truly inconceivable. Those who are impure are transformed to purity, upholding my Dharma. If still impure, they are made pure. Thus it is, thus it is.\n\nIf one possesses true wisdom and the true wondrous treasure, it is no falsehood. Welcome, disciples of the profound and wondrous Dharma! Through the convergence of causes and conditions, thought by thought, one transcends the ordinary to enter sageliness, leaving the coarse for the sublime, shedding one body to receive another, becoming a true companion of immortals. The sixth and seventh stages are likewise; attaining true perfection and the Dao is likewise.\n\nShould beings be afflicted by demons, their form and spirit parted, long bound to the gates of yin, without liberation—such matters are truly terrifying. Those who contemplate the Dao and leave the household life, escaping the dust and defilements as I have taught—if they also practice thus, they find joy in this life, escape the cycle of rebirth, avoid perverse views, eliminate all attachments, constantly uphold the true teaching without pause, ever as one who hungers and thirsts seeks food and drink.\"\n\nAnd they spoke this verse:\n\nThe wondrous cause of purity pervades all.\nThose who have not aroused the mind are made to arouse it.\nThose who lack faith are also guided toward it.\nGreat waves of goodness arise, each advancing with diligence.\nThose who skillfully expound the Dharma are like skilled physicians.\nWith wondrous medicine, they treat the blind,\nEnabling them to see the sun and moon—\nThis is the great scripture.\nIt opens the eye of wisdom, allowing one to abide in peace.\n\n*Talismans of the Yellow Grove Sutra*\n*The Yellow Grove Sutra of the Jade Pure Realm* **Concludes**",

Thus, you shall swiftly attain awakening, gain the supreme power, abide in immovable constancy, transcend all bounds, and accomplish the transmission—becoming the guiding masters of those who cultivate the Dao and tread the path of immortality.\n\nWhen they expound the Dharma, none fail to bow in reverence;\nWhen they engage in debate, none fail to bow in reverence.\n\nThose who come to hear the teaching all attain understanding. The three realms and empty space are but provisional names. The sages, possessed of such majestic virtue and power, practice the wondrous Dharma, revealing to all beings these profound matters. Yet the ignorant and base, lacking strength, cannot fathom such truths and thus remain deluded, unable to enter.\n\nTherefore, the sages employ the gates of wisdom and skillful means, guiding all beings to perfect goodness and ascend to the supreme realm. Through steadfast teaching and transformation, they may escape the paths of suffering. Moreover, the five aggregates are without substance, and the three paths bear much suffering. Thoughts arise and perish in an instant; all dharmas are impermanent.\n\nThose who gather here, unwavering and unshaken, shall attain the blessed fruition—this is called the cause of supreme joy. Ever practicing purity, unobstructed and free, they receive the good reward. You, within this assembly, must weigh the lightness and heaviness of merit and its benefits, and further awaken to the truth.\n\nIf Daoist priests or nuns accumulate merit beyond conception, with thirty-six thousand true Dharma companions—all known to the multitude—cultivating great wisdom and perfecting their practice, the majestic power of the Great Dao becomes their fortress of Dharma protection. Upholding the true teaching, their fame spreads in the ten directions, and all people seek their counsel. They uphold and propagate the Three Treasures, ensuring their continuity, subduing demonic obstacles, and restraining external paths. Through purity, they forever sever the bonds of desire, their minds constantly abiding in unobstructed liberation.\n\nIn every thought, they uphold the totality, their eloquence unbroken. They perfect giving, uphold precepts, endure humiliation, and cultivate concentrated thought. Subtle wisdom and the power of skillful means are all fully possessed. Whether hidden or revealed, they dwell in empty space, their great wisdom attaining the patience of non-arising. Their names are recorded as those who have attained the Dao, entered the stage of non-retreat, and entered the practice of purity.\n\nIn brief, even if the Great Dao were expounded for five hundred kalpas, preaching the Dharma day and night without cease, the meaning could never be exhausted. You must know that from this point onward, for hundreds of thousands of kalpas, if one cultivates and reaches the realm of non-action—whether formless or with form—wisdom enters samadhi, and the patience of non-arising is not stirred. From the highest to the lowest, all bow in reverence, bow in reverence. The thirty-two marks are clearly perceived, the meaning of the Dao is realized, and spiritual wisdom is boundless, like empty space, immeasurable.\n\nFurthermore, in times past, the perfected ones sought the true teaching of the Dao, pitying sentient beings as a mother loves her child. The Dao is most profound and distant, not of this present day. If one can diligently uphold it, never forgetting for a moment, and spontaneously declare, \"Excellent! Excellent!\"—this is called skillful means. The revered deities of the ten directions, moved by this mind, bestow the power of the wondrous Dharma. At that very moment, the five paths become open, demonic forces retreat into hiding, and all then clarify their true vows, each attaining accomplishment.\n\nAnd they spoke this verse:\n\nWhat I now behold is the true Dharma.\nIts great fruition is beyond compare.\nAs one in darkness finds a great lamp,\nAll are illumined by this light.\nThe body attains peace, free from affliction.\nThrough this cause and condition, all is fulfilled.\nExcellent is the wondrous Dharma, truly profound.\nBy this meaning, the fruit is perfected.\n\n*Talismans of the Scripture of Supreme Perfection*\n*The Scripture of Supreme Perfection of the Jade Pure Realm* **Concludes**",

Now that you raise this question, it is the fruit of hearing—yet if you merely arouse this mind to seek the supreme Dao, it shall never be attained.\n\nJust as the mighty ghost-spirits of the five paths, though born and transformed alongside heaven and earth through the kalpas, entangle themselves in the web of doubt, seeking libation priests to dwell forever in the earthly realm, they cannot heed the precepts and thus lose the root of the Dao.\n\nIf your minds truly desire to hear my true teaching, you must at this moment arouse the mind of supreme, inconceivable wisdom—only then may you hear it. Now that you seek the Dao, having once heard it—how rare! How rare!\n\nThe Dao is not sought within form, nor is it sought beyond form. It is not sought by clinging to existence, nor by clinging to non-existence. For the sake of all beings, it provisionally manifests in various dharmas, following what is established and forcibly assigning names. Yet once a name is obtained, in truth it departs from that name.\n\nThe supreme, perfectly true [Dao]—merely hearing its name—brings immeasurable virtue, beyond conception. How much more so for those who receive and uphold it! Though it has no form or appearance, dim and obscure, within it lies the utmost essence, the unobstructed supreme Dharma. The true nature remains unmoved; its power is like the sea, vast and boundless. It subdues afflictions and adversities, restrains external paths, and is most difficult to attain. Its responsive transformations are infinite, beyond conception.\n\nThis Dao is profoundly mysterious—such words speak of rare matters. Now that I expound these dharma-aspects, I accept your request. You must believe and contemplate, without thoughts of retreat, without doubts, without fear, without trusting other notions, without saying it is powerless, without saying it is too difficult. Simply maintain a straightforward mind and right mindfulness, plant the roots of goodness, and naturally you will comprehend the Dharma and enter the source of the Dao. Always abide in singularity; if there is nothing to attain, do not generate dharma-endurance. Diligently cultivate wisdom, constantly exhort all beings, universally enabling them to attain the Dao without obstruction from birth. Do not give rise to jealousy, but offer a single mind, teaching equally. The supreme cause and condition are truly inconceivable, without end.\n\nExpound broadly on cause and condition without negligence, constantly making the sound of the Dharma, praising and chanting, so that all beings together generate the aspiration to turn toward it. Arouse the supreme, perfectly true, unattainable mind, accomplish great perfection, cultivate the true teaching, and universally deliver the boundless.\n\nEach wields the inconceivable power of great wisdom and spiritual penetrations. At this moment, receive the Dharma and attain the good karmic conditions of deliverance. Thus it is, thus it is.\n\nIf there are beings who, even briefly in kalpa after kalpa, hear the Dharma, it is likewise without limit or boundary—all are seeds. Yet if one fears the seeds and does not plant them oneself, it will be difficult to bear fruit. All of you are most rare and precious, able to follow and turn with it, never retreating from the wheel, all perfectly complete.\n\nKnowing how to plant the roots of goodness, all the celestial assembly attain fearlessness, virtue, and wisdom. Cultivating their minds, their forms are adorned with excellent marks, perfectly complete and foremost. First attaining the good fruit, they abandon all fine reputations and lofty renown in the world, their aspirations high and far-reaching, without further practice.\"\n\nAnd they spoke this verse:\n\nBy this good Dao,\nIt is shown to the world.\nLike heavenly rain,\nIt moistens and nurtures growth.\nAll the multitudes\nAttain fruition.\nHunger and famine are wholly dispelled,\nAbundantly receiving joy.\nThe divine treasure of the honored ones,\nImmeasurable wisdom—\nAll evils are forever extinguished,\nMyriad deviations do not intrude.\nSpiritual illumination reaches far,\nAttaining its profound mystery.\nTruly unmoving,\nGaining fearless power.\n\n*Talismans of the Daoist Scripture*\n*The Daoist Scripture of the Jade Pure Realm* **Concludes**\n\n*The Lower Scroll of the Jade Pure Realm from the Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the Most High*\n*The Yellow Grove Scripture, The Scripture of Supreme Perfection, The Daoist Scripture, The Scripture of Supreme Refinement, The Scripture of Supreme Wondrous Virtue, and the Dao De Jing—six scriptures in one scroll*\n*The Scripture of Supreme Refinement of the Jade Pure Realm* **Chapter Ten**\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"In this assembly, the immeasurable assembly of sagely beings has gathered—all the celestial perfected ones, the boundless and infinite perfected great spirits.

      "translated_text": "And he spoke in verse, saying:\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared:\nAll these realms of suffering\nAre entered by oneself.\nIf one attains to hearing the Dharma,\nThis too is most fortunate.\nYou now proclaim it—\nHold fast and firm,\nAdvance with courage and vigor.\nAgain, with radiant light\nAnd the pure Dharma-water,\nShatter all obstacles,\nBreak open the Eight Hells,\nAnd the Five Sufferings within—\nAll shall naturally dissolve.\nThe iron city of ten thousand leagues\nCollapses like sand.\n\nRefining the Scripture of Numinous Talismans in the Jade Clarity Realm\n\nThus concludes *The Scripture of Supreme Virtue in the Jade Clarity Realm*, thirty-sixth among the *Thirty-Six Venerable Scriptures of the Jade Clarity Realm*.\n\n*The Yellow Grove Scripture, The Scripture of Supreme Perfection, The Daoist Scriptures, The Scripture of Supreme Refinement, The Scripture of Supreme and Wondrous Virtue,* and *The Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*—these six scriptures form a single scroll.\n\n*The Scripture of Supreme and Wondrous Virtue in the Jade Clarity Realm*, Chapter Eleven\n\nThe Dao spoke: Excellent, excellent!\nIf within this assembly there are boundless Heavenly Perfected Ones, Great Sages, and Most Perfect Great Spirits—\nThe Flying Heavenly Lords of East, West, South, and North—all bow their heads,\nEach with their own karmic conditions of Dharma, beyond full expression.\nThe four directions abound with great wisdom,\nEnabling these boundless, measureless beings.\nIf any man or woman awakens a virtuous mind,\nGenerates great wisdom,\nFirst tames and subdues their mind,\nAnd cultivates the essential practices—\nSuch essential practices\nConvey one into the Dharma-wheel,\nWhere the Flying Heavenly Ones revolve.\nThe true canon of the Great Treasury,\nOver five thousand characters,\nEighteen thousand chapters,\nAll return to the Treasure Repository.\nThe Eight Flying Heavenly Spirits exert their power in rotation,\nThe four golden dragons spin the pillar and the Dipper’s pearl,\nPearls hang from eight sides,\nThirty-two pavilions,\nThirty-two Heavenly Emperors encircle the eight directions,\nFive-colored auspicious clouds spread across the earth and emerge,\nRadiant light illumines all—\nWithin the treasury’s heart is inscribed *The Scripture of the Numinous Chapters on Birth from the Nine Heavens*,\nWhile the remaining scriptures return to the pavilions.\nThe wheel turns thrice,\nEnabling all beings to perceive their true nature,\nTo receive admonitions within the Dharma-wheel,\nTo attain rebirth,\nTo return and be born among humans,\nTo clearly perceive all dharmas,\nWithout doubt,\nAnd to plant manifold roots of goodness.\nCultivating this essential Way,\nBoundless wisdom,\nImmeasurable teachings—\nAll are contained within,\nPracticed for ten thousand generations\nWithout hindrance.\nSuch merit and virtue\nAre without end,\nTruly beyond thought or discussion.\nAmong this assembly, those who comprehend this principle—\nAll who see and hear—\nShall have their wishes fulfilled.\nThose who have not yet heard this essential Dharma\nShould also awaken the mind and take refuge,\nFollowing the turning of the Dharma-wheel,\nBriefly listening to the true sound,\nAnd thus attain liberation.\nCultivate this essential Way,\nNever waver or regret,\nAdvance diligently in recitation,\nTo hear the profound and wondrous Way of the Supreme Perfected,\nAnd again, with radiant light,\nSave and deliver all beings,\nFreeing them from the realms of suffering,\nCreating great benefit,\nEmploying manifold expedient means.\nAdvance in the practice of deeds,\nSo that gods and humans take refuge.\nFor hundreds of thousands of kalpas—\nThose already born, to be born, or yet unborn—\nIf they awaken a virtuous thought,\nThey must revere and uphold it,\nBe guided into the Dharma-gate,\nSo that in this life, or in lives to come,\nThey may gradually hear the Dharma,\nWithout demonic obstacles,\nAnd also encounter this Dharma.\nIf there are those who have already heard this teaching within the Dharma\nAnd yet do not practice diligently from beginning to end—\nThough they initially attain the Way,\nLater they waver and regret,\nClinging to worldly entanglements—\nThey shall not attain liberation.\nYou must rely on my words,\nListen and receive,\nBroadly open the Dharma-gate,\nCultivate your original practice,\nAnd also enable those who have not awakened to awaken,\nThose who have not heard to hear,\nEstablishing great merit and virtue.\nAll practices perfected,\nCross over into good fruition,\nPerceive the great causal conditions,\nUniversally enter the fruit of non-action,\nFurther enter refinement and deliverance,\nTo attain the perfection of the Dao,\nAnd enter the fruit of purity.\nAll that is done\nShall be supremely good.\nThus, all these qualities,\nAll powers of merit and virtue,\nBoundless and immeasurable,\nAre all fully possessed in their subtlest aspects.\nIf the sprouts of Dharma\nAre not well cultivated,\nOne loses the root of the Dharma\nAnd cannot attain long life.\nIf one can accumulate practice,\nMerit and virtue shall be without limit.\nAt the time I expound the Dharma,\nThere is neither existence nor non-existence.\nFor this reason,\nAll dharmas respond accordingly,\nWithout self or other,\nAll that is seen and heard is perfected.\nThrough this wondrous power,\nGreat and beyond thought or discussion.\n\nAnd he spoke in verse, saying:\n\nTo know the ancient beginning\nIs called the record of the Dao.\nTo enable the unenlightened to awaken\nIs the seed of the Dao.\nWhy is this so?\nThe Heavenly Worthy’s wisdom\nCannot be measured or exhausted,\nThe meaning of the subtle and wondrous\nIs profound and distant, difficult to discern—\nForcibly described in its aspects.\nThe practice of wisdom is hard to fathom,\nYet all dharmas should be perceived.\nWhy then do these beings\nFail to attain?\nClinging and ignorant,\nIf enlightened, all awaken.\n\nThe Numinous Talismans of *The Scripture of Supreme and Wondrous Virtue*\n\nThus concludes *The Scripture of Supreme and Wondrous Virtue in the Jade Clarity Realm*, thirty-sixth among the *Thirty-Six Venerable Scriptures of the Jade Clarity Realm*.\n\n*The Yellow Grove Scripture, The Scripture of Supreme Perfection, The Daoist Scriptures, The Scripture of Supreme Refinement, The Scripture of Supreme and Wondrous Virtue,* and *The Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*—these six scriptures form a single scroll.\n\n*The Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue in the Jade Clarity Realm*, Chapter Twelve\n\nI declare that all things are subtle and wondrous.\nYou, all Perfected Ones, possess boundless wisdom\nIn the past, future, and present lives,\nYet do not comprehend it.\nEight paths intersect in confusion,\nManifold karmic conditions—none are true mindfulness.\nSome, though of the highest grade,\nDo not perceive their true nature,\nHave not fully entered the Great Vehicle,\nStill cling to incense and flowers,\nDo not generate virtue or power,\nDo not awaken wisdom,\nDo not practice good faith—\nThey too may fall.\nHow much more those who are deluded and perverse,\nForever losing their causal conditions,\nNever encountering the Three Treasures,\nNever hearing the essential Dharma,\nNever hearing the Dharma-drum,\nNever hearing the secret treasury?\nSuch people, even if they hear me expound the Dharma,\nCannot discern it,\nNor can they distinguish their own actions,\nNor the characteristics of dharmas.\nDevoid of self-nature,\nDevoid of other-nature.\nIf one can hear and comprehend this teaching,\nThen in all dharmas one attains perfection,\nReaching non-arising and non-ceasing,\nAnd again perfects all dharmas,\nDeparting from all dharma-characteristics,\nAll speech,\nAnd all that is spoken of—\nNeither speaking nor silent,\nThis is the illumination of the essential Dharma.",

      "translated_text": "The *Supreme Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the High Clarity Realm*\n*The Scripture of the Cavern Mystery*\n*The Scripture of Primordial Yang*\n*The Scripture of Primordial Celestial Cycles*\n*The Scripture of the Great Kalpa*\n*The Scripture of the Supreme Opening*\n*The Scripture of the Inner Sound*\n—The above six scriptures share a single scroll—\n\n*The Scripture of Primordial Yang of the High Clarity Realm*   Chapter Two\n\nAt that time, the sacred multitudes of the heavens, the great deities of the heavens, and the boundless perfected ones rejoiced in their hearts, having heard the Celestial Worthy expound thus at length for the great assembly, teaching the step-by-step cultivation that leads to perfect fulfillment. This creates immeasurable and boundless fields of vast merit, serving as the root of life for all beings. If one can skillfully harmonize the principles of nature and life, one will naturally attain harmony and well-being, preserving the integrity of the body. Adapting to the seasons and employing expedient means, diligently cultivating one’s practice, in such fields will sweet rain ever fall, nourishing year after year abundant harvests, free from harm. Such great benefit is inconceivable, universally delivering all beings, bringing about such fulfillment. Through this, one attains self-mastery, mighty vigor, and unrelenting progress.\n\nHaving heard the Dharma to its conclusion, they then aroused within this scripture a mind of purity, a mind of spontaneity, a mind of fearlessness, and a mind of compassion. Reverently engaging in cultivation, they again heard this teaching. Even the non-Buddhist paths of foreign lands, upon hearing and receiving the prophecy, were all likewise granted prophecy—the greatest of causes, yielding boundless fruit. Having attained such matters, their minds opened and their intentions arose, all becoming clear. Their bodies attained the vastness of heaven without limit, pervading the Dharma-realm without end. The thirty-two marks filled the empty space, and the eighty excellences brought benefit through every gate. Manifesting or concealing, appearing or vanishing, boundless and profoundly subtle, wondrous and unconditioned.\n\nOverwhelmed with joy beyond measure at such teachings, they declared this to be the good medicine, capable of rescuing all suffering and delivering beings through expedient means. Skillfully discerning the depth and shallowness of illnesses, applying remedies according to symptoms, one comes to know the waxing and waning of the four great elements. Constantly arousing great compassion, pitying all beings, one thus enables them to take refuge together, teaching all beings. Expounding the great wisdom, one desires that all beings deeply enter the Dharma-gate, hear the secret treasury, and immediately attain non-arising and non-ceasing. All in the world neither know nor see—boundless and immeasurable. Yet the faithful multitudes of the heavens can all know and see; those who awaken are called true persons. Those who know the correct awakening proceed directly to the supreme vehicle. If not of the world, what difference would there be? Yet it is also of the world, and also not of the world. As the saying goes, to speak of difference requires some approximation.\n\nThus, you should proclaim and practice the essential Dharma, creating great good causes for all future beings. You must constantly expound it—not only today or at this hour. The ultimate good Dharma should never be exhausted; the great wisdom of universal penetration can never be exhausted. How much less could those who expound it ever exhaust it? You should accept this in faith. I shall now explain to you, one by one, the profound roots of the Dao, so that you may attain liberation—the foremost cause.\n\nIf you possess the wisdom of universal penetration and great compassion, pitying all beings, you become a cause for the Dharma and a benefactor to the world. Excellent indeed, beyond all thought! First establishing this Dharma, universally rescuing all sentient beings, one observes how all beings are defiled by form, defiled by desire, unaware and unenlightened, bringing upon themselves such suffering. Moment by moment, they take this to be joy, engaging in false speech, divisive words, harsh scolding, greed, anger, ignorance, and perverse views. Though they hear this Dharma, they do not diligently practice, thus bringing such suffering upon themselves, forever without liberation. I teach all dharmas so that all may attain fulfillment.\n\nAnd he spoke this verse:",

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the Upper Clarity Realm, Lower Scroll: The Scripture of Refining Life, The Scripture of Numinous Secrets, The Scripture of Dispelling Demons, The Immeasurable Scripture, The Scripture of Subduing Demons, The Scripture of Upper Communication** *(The above six scriptures share a single scroll)*\n\n**The Scripture of Numinous Secrets of the Upper Clarity Realm, Chapter Eight**\n\nMan dwells between Heaven and Earth. Since the opening of creation, he has borne the name of \"human.\" Humanity is the *qi* of central harmony, the foremost of all beings. Noble and revered, he resembles Heaven and Earth. Yet he cannot endure as long as Heaven and Earth, for he fails to cultivate the Dao of gathering and refining, thus bringing about his own ruin.\n\nThe perfected person, understanding this principle, unites form and spirit, refines truth, and cultivates *qi*, attaining the realm of perfect subtlety. There, he may roam freely in his true nature, enter the Golden Gate, forever sever the cycle of rebirth, transcend and attain the Dao, vow to deliver all beings, and create boundless good causes.\n\nKnow this: the human body is hard to obtain, yet the true Dao is often obscured. If one loses this human form, it is difficult to regain even after ten thousand kalpas. Now, with a single death, one may wander endlessly through heaven and earth, never knowing the cause. After death, none know their destination. The soul is gathered, the spirit assembled, the body reunited—yet in an instant, all returns to darkness. How grievous! How lamentable!\n\nI now tell you: awaken to right view, comprehend life and death, and cease all sorrow. All karmic grievances shall be dissolved, never to burden you again.\n\nThus, the laws of Heaven and Earth decree that they, the parents of all things, fear that within their midst, beings may bring suffering upon themselves, weeping in vain, giving rise to afflictions and false evil karma—truly, not by Heaven and Earth’s calamity are these woes bestowed. The bitterness is unbearable; they cry out to Heaven above and knock upon the Earth below, mourning their own sorrow, proclaiming their grievances.\n\nTherefore, Heaven and Earth generate the true Dao, endlessly teaching all wondrous methods to refine the soul and forge the spirit, enabling transformation and self-preservation to attain a modest longevity. Yet there is no great wisdom of the true Dao, no essential method to comprehend and align with Heaven and Earth’s eternity, to match the sun and moon’s radiance, to follow the stars’ revolutions, or to turn with the kalpas’ cycles. Though one may gain a modest lifespan, it brings no true benefit.\n\nAll beings endowed with form between Heaven and Earth are subject to decay. How much more so for man, entangled by the seven emotions and six desires, ensnared by wealth and arrogance, self-satisfied and unaware of yearning for the true Dao; or by poverty and lowliness, breeding resentment, scorning the Dao, and feeling no shame, only generating evil karma.\n\nThose who study the Dao, though initially guided by wisdom, may not yet grasp worldly mechanisms. Still bound by afflictions and desires, they refuse to diligently learn the true Dao and its virtuous methods, growing careless and remorseful, mocking the true Dao as false, seeking petty gains to disrupt the heavenly order, deceiving the upright and true, and thus hastening their own demise.\n\nAll foolish people know they will die, yet they prepare tombs, seeking permanence, arranging funerary pacts, crafting mourning garments for descendants, amassing treasures to display grandeur—all according to worldly custom, yet utterly without benefit. They do not consider: when this body dies and is reborn, what karmic retribution will follow? If you do not heed my words, you too shall act thus.\n\nIn all Dharma, I clarify the true Dao, revealing it to all beings. Responding to conditions and resonances, I am free from attachment, joyful and at ease.\n\nAnd so a gāthā says:\nWith all your heart, give your utmost intent.\nWhether man or woman, you must fathom the wondrous origin.\nAt this very moment, let each thought be unwavering.\nSuch are my disciples, those of the Dao.\nEver practice the highest conduct, never dwelling in the four evils.\nDo not indulge in depraved desires, nor any misdeeds.\nSee not what exists, nor what does not.\nFocus your mind on the Dao, seek the Dharma.\n\n**Numinous Talisman of the Scripture of Numinous Secrets**\n**End of the Scripture of Numinous Secrets of the Upper Clarity Realm**\n\n**The Supreme Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the Upper Clarity Realm, Lower Scroll: The Scripture of Refining Life, The Scripture of Numinous Secrets, The Scripture of Dispelling Demons, The Immeasurable Scripture, The Scripture of Subduing Demons, The Scripture of Upper Communication** *(The above six scriptures share a single scroll)*\n\n**The Scripture of Dispelling Demons of the Upper Clarity Realm, Chapter Nine**\n\nMan’s life in the world should always know its return. The cycle of life and death turns without cease, like the sun rising in the east and setting in the west. Even the ancient sage-kings and worthies were no different.\n\nYet in every era, one should reflect deeply, cherishing life and fearing death, constantly seeking rare knowledge, vainly relying on strange methods and arts to prolong life—only to harm one’s nature. Revering spirits and ghosts, flattering for blessings, they seek fortune but invite misfortune.\n\nThose who claim to possess the Dao’s arts, feigning auspicious omens, boast of moving Heaven and Earth, gaining longevity, and transcending the world. Once such desires arise, delusion follows. Trusting the false, they corrupt the true, sinking into evil destinies, never awakening. They do not cultivate the true Dao, nor understand its causes, nor meet good teachers, nor sever the roots of evil. Unable to plan wisely for the future, they bring upon themselves sorrow and confusion.\n\nSuch actions reverse the Dao and harm the teachings, creating boundless sin. Without repentance, their false doctrines solidify, and the true Dao cannot enter—thus they persist in error.\n\nThe sages of old, wise and far-seeing, established models for all under Heaven and future generations. They wished for posterity to recognize false paths and demonic obstructions of the good Dao, thus illuminating wisdom. They also sought to dispel all demonic spirits, that all might hear the true Dao. The benefits are beyond conception.\n\nIn those times, many worthies gathered in flourishing assemblies to expound the essential Dharma, serving as guides. They thoroughly understood the beginning and end of Heaven and Earth, deeply explored the cycles of return, yet did not speak of life after death, nor of life and death as separate paths. They did not explicitly state that life, death, coming, and going are illusory, but taught the essential Dharma of non-arising and non-ceasing. Thus, those who attained the Dao could themselves grasp the profound mechanism, comprehend the Dharma of life and death, and their wisdom became boundless. The principle of life and death naturally held no fear, and the wisdom of all things spread to future generations.",

Should there be those who revere the true teaching and possess perfect wisdom, they too shall likewise forever cast aside greed and attachment, with demon kings as their guarantors, ascending to the imperial court. Should emperors and kings attain this, they may govern with effortless virtue, and the realm shall govern itself. Should the worthy attain this, they shall fulfill filial piety, fraternal duty, loyalty, and trust, aiding their sovereign above, stabilizing the nation’s destiny. Disasters shall not arise, malevolent omens shall forever vanish, auspicious stars shall ever shine, inauspicious stars shall self-destruct, weapons shall not be raised, spring pestilence shall not spread, summer epidemics shall not arise, autumn plagues shall not stir, winter epidemics shall not invade. Wind and rain shall be harmonious, crops shall flourish abundantly. Throughout the land, men and women shall rejoice in great peace, its vastness filling all without end. Should one further devote oneself to upholding it with utmost sincerity, the three paths, five sufferings, and eight adversities shall be forever extinguished. Grasping the talisman and holding the register, one shall ascend directly to the Jade Capital, carefree and at ease; ascending into the Vermilion Palace, refining and transcending the bodily form, one’s name shall be inscribed on the Purple Register, receiving the mandate of the Crimson Empyrean.\n\nThe Five Emperors, great demons, all celestial immortals, demon kings of the Three Realms, flying heavenly deities, and boundless great spirits shall together receive grace and pardon, all attaining the wondrous Dharma. They shall traverse the heavens, jointly safeguarding and elevating, ascending to the Supreme Clarity.\n\nThen a gāthā was spoken:\nWith the heart’s great vow, this merit’s power,\nNow extending to the great assembly, all should believe and hold fast.\nAttaining the lofty and wondrous, true and subtle Dharma,\nGaining boundless goodness, the Dao’s wisdom pervades all.\nWith right mindfulness widely propagated,\nFor future beings who practice in due time,\nThey shall attain the eternal root and enter the wondrous,\nTheir wisdom complete.\nWhether with form or without,\nThe greatest wisdom,\nFree from all other thoughts.\n\n*The Scripture of Supreme Clarity on Dispelling Demons* concludes here.\n*The Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the Most High: The Lower Scripture of Supreme Clarity*\n*The Scripture of Refining Life, The Scripture of Numinous Secrets, The Scripture of Dispelling Demons, The Immeasurable Scripture, The Scripture of Subduing Demons, The Scripture of Ascending Communication*—the above six scriptures are in one scroll.\n*The Immeasurable Scripture of Supreme Clarity*, Scroll Ten\n\nThe orthodoxy of Heaven and Earth shall forever dispel calamities. The sun, moon, and five planets shall radiate brilliant light. The people shall thereby flourish, each awakening to virtuous thoughts. Yet when the people grow restless and the customs of the age shift, harming the harmonious qi, Heaven and Earth shall greatly rage, the three luminaries of the sun, moon, and stars shall lose their brightness, and Heaven and Earth shall contend, no longer in harmony. The signs shall be untimely winds and thunder, harming the nature of things so that none may grow; the people shall perish and be injured. Yin and yang shall contend, no longer in harmony, the five grains shall not ripen, water and fire shall lose their measure, and disasters shall arise together. For yin and yang were originally united, mutually aiding to generate harmonious qi, yet now contend instead.\n\nThus, I clearly reveal the essential Dharma, expounding the causes of expiatory rites, that all may be spared from calamities and all people come to know the root of the Dao. Thereupon, the perfected great spirits, innumerable hosts, all celestial perfected ones, and the boundless, immeasurable assemblies of sages from the ten directions all bowed their heads and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “We have yet to fathom the subtleties of the true Dao. We humbly beseech your great compassion to broadly proclaim it. We dare ask: when there is severe drought, all grasses and trees wither, and the people suffer and die of hunger, what is the extraordinary cause?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: “The disaster of severe drought arises from the sun losing its measure, the six yang forces all resentful, thereby causing harm. The yang nine cycle spans one thousand eight hundred years, and when it encounters *jiǎ*, it is the great yang nine. The hundred six cycle spans one thousand six hundred years, and when it encounters *shēn*, it is the great hundred six. If the yang nine does not meet *jiǎ*, or the hundred six does not meet *shēn*, it shall not be a disaster. The lesser yang nine spans one hundred eighty years, the lesser hundred six one hundred sixty years; only when their cycles converge on *jiǎ* and *shēn* shall it be a disaster. If not *jiǎ* and *shēn*, it shall not be a disaster.”\n\n“We dare ask about floods?”\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: “Floods arise from the moon losing its measure, the six yin forces all resentful, thereby causing harm. The cycles are the same.”\n\n“We dare ask about fires?”\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: “Fires arise from the fire star deviating from its path, transgressing its proper position and passing through regions beyond its domain. Below, it manifests as children’s rhymes: if auspicious, it brings fortune; if inauspicious, it brings misfortune. When it descends in the *yín*, *shēn*, *sì*, and *hài* positions, it shall burn prefectures, counties, ferries, and towns. When it descends in the *zǐ*, *wǔ*, *mǎo*, and *yǒu* positions, it shall burn temples, palaces, ancestral halls, and dwellings. When it descends in the *chén*, *xū*, *chǒu*, and *wèi* positions, it shall burn the people’s homes, cities, mountains, marshes, and boats.”\n\nThereupon, the assembly all entreated: “If such calamities occur, how may they be saved?”\nThe Heavenly Worthy then addressed the assembly, saying: “Floods, droughts, and fires all arise from whether the people practice goodness or not. If a village practices goodness, disasters shall turn to fortune; if a village does not practice goodness, fortune shall turn to disaster. Furthermore, the two stars of Heavenly Usurpation and Heavenly Plunder descend, bringing bandits and chaos, plundering possessions and taking lives. If one does not perform grand jiao rites and submit memorials in worship, the calamities shall not be averted.”\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy revealed the rites of the Great Unity jiao, commanding the Treasure Virtue Perfected One to descend and transmit them, that all people might be spared from calamities, forever free from floods, fires, drought demons, bandits, and disasters. Such benefits shall extend broadly to all. If in a given place one lacks the means to perform the rites, one may fast, bathe, and purify oneself, then invite a Daoist to recite this scripture exclusively, even a hundred times, and the calamities may still be averted.\n\nThen a gāthā was spoken:\nThe Dao’s methods are nameless,\nDependent on human cultivation.\nThe most true and wondrous Dharma,\nRare to encounter.\nYou now encounter it,\nA blessing from past lives.\nTeach others in turn,\nCreating great merit’s power.\nDisasters shall dissolve,\nFortune shall swiftly arrive.\nIf one can revere and uphold it,\nEver shall there be harmony and prosperity.\nHeaven and Earth, yin and yang,\nAll shall harmonize their qi.\nAll people\nShall attain freedom and ease.",

What marked their beginning? At the inception of the ten poles and thousand realms, perfected beings attained their stations, divided their forms to teach and transform, and only then did the measures of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, sun and moon begin to operate. Once these measures were fixed, qi was then divided.\n\nThe East holds nine qi, where the Wood phase is gentle and compliant; the South holds three qi, where the Fire qi blazes fiercely. Though Fire qi is but three, it equals the nine qi of the Wood phase, together making twelve qi. The West holds seven qi, where the Metal phase is firm and solid; the North holds five qi, where the Water qi surges boundlessly. Though Water qi is but five, it equals the seven qi of the Metal phase, together making twelve qi. The remaining qi of the four directions—northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest—are gathered as Brahma qi. The qi of the southeast is balanced, the qi of the northwest is balanced, harmonizing with the qi of the four directions. The qi of the northeast generates mountains, stones, great trees, and mighty beasts in abundance, while the qi of the southwest is scant, producing only treasures. The upper and lower positions, that is, the Earth phase of the Center, divide twelve qi. Rising, they form Heaven; stored, they become Earth. Thus, Heaven and Earth each possess thirty-six qi, and only then can they generate the myriad things.\n\nThereupon, the great deities of the ten poles and perfected beings, the celestial perfected and great sages, simultaneously bowed their heads and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “We are fortunate to hear the true teaching, yet have not fathomed its profound mechanism. We only pray for your compassion to broadly expound it.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said to the assembly: “The qi of Heaven and Earth moves in accord with numerical cycles, and these cycles also have their ends. Even the sun, moon, five planets, all celestial bodies, and the most sagely beings cannot escape calamitous cycles—how much less those of shallow learning who wish to avoid illness and harm?”\n\nThereupon, the entire assembly was struck with awe and fear. They bowed their heads and prostrated themselves again, asking: “If such calamities exist, how may they be averted?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: “You have all been fortunate in past lives, encountering good causes and hearing these teachings in manifold ways. Yet those born between Heaven and Earth are all deluded by the seven emotions and six desires, which confuse body and mind. Thus, they fail to hear the true Dao or awaken to the wondrous Dharma, and only accumulate transgressions, even when they repent. I shall now proclaim the true teaching for you, unfold the jade tones, turn the wheel of the true scriptures, and broadly present offerings. Whether on the *jiazi* day, the *gengshen* day, in the first month, the seventh month, or the tenth month—along with the eight solar terms, your life-destiny days, and birthdays—you should strictly maintain incense and fire, diligently uphold the Dharma, cultivate and gather the qi of the utmost truth, harmonize yin and yang, connect the blood vessels above and below, commune with Heaven and Earth, absorb the upright qi, dispel defilement and evil, prevent the arising of disasters and illness, eradicate ghosts and demons, ensure the five paths are unimpeded, and promote the flourishing of the six livestock. You should listen and receive these teachings, then teach others in turn, so that all later learners may hear of these good fruits, all attain auspiciousness, and every household and family share in the supreme goodness.\n\nThis scripture is named *Inconceivable*, and its merit and power are likewise inconceivable.”\n\nThereupon, the celestial immortals, the boundless perfected beings, the great sages of the utmost truth, the innumerable celestial deities, and the countless multitudes all heard these words and rejoiced. They vowed to uphold and protect the teaching, disseminate it throughout the world, and universally bestow its boundless benefits upon all. They cautioned that it must not be carelessly disclosed or treated with irreverence by unenlightened commoners of later ages, lest they fail to attain its blessed fruits.\n\nThen a gāthā was spoken:\nThe true and constant, unchanging—\nThis is called the true Dao.\nAll manifold evils\nShall be wholly cast far away.\nIt is like the lotus flower,\nWhich does not grow on dry land.\nOnly in moistened places\nDoes this flower arise.\nFrom the turbid mire,\nIt emerges unstained.\nFree from all craving and attachment,\nYou walk in purity.\nLike the lotus flower,\nWhen you practice this Dao,\nThe child of supreme virtue\nShall possess all marks in full.\n\nThe *Lingfu of the Scripture of Subduing Demons* of the Shangqing Realm\n*Shangqing Realm Scripture of Subduing Demons* concludes",

When upright qi is scant, Heaven and Earth are obscured by deviant qi. It is only because deviant qi abounds that it can harm upright qi; when upright qi abounds, it can restrain deviant qi. This is the spontaneous qi of Heaven and Earth.\n\nAll deviant qi arises because upright qi does not circulate, allowing deviant qi to enter. Those who cultivate the true Dao must cause deviant qi to dissipate and practice the supreme, most perfect Dao to attain the method of prolonging life and avoiding death.\n\nHumans receive their mandate from Heaven, which has its own norms. Heaven and Earth privately grant thirty years; if this is exceeded, it is like the intercalary days added when the cycles of Heaven, Earth, sun, and moon align. If one cultivates the supreme Dao, the most perfect Dao, and the methods of exhaling, inhaling, and concealing the spirit, one ascends and descends with Heaven and Earth and thus attains immortality.\n\nThose who rigidly guard their bodily form without adaptability will ultimately suffer no less harm than those who harmonize spirit and gather qi, unite with the Dao, and merge with the true, appearing in accordance with things without losing their true nature—only thus can they endure long.\n\nHuman life—all calculations, numbers, clothing, and food—has its allotted portion. Though this portion is fixed, it also depends on one’s cultivation of the supreme Dao to increase blessings and prosperity. It is like one who does not plow in spring yet expects a harvest in autumn; when nothing comes of it, they say it is Heaven’s portion. Those who do no good yet seek blessings differ not at all from this.\n\nIf today you eat another’s food, then tomorrow go to eat theirs, this is not called eating another’s food but \"borrowing provisions.\" If today you carry another’s burden, then tomorrow go to have them carry yours, this is not called carrying another’s burden but \"borrowing labor.\" If today you join another in planning, then tomorrow go to join them again, this is not called helping another but \"exchanging merit.\" If today you praise another, then tomorrow receive their praise, this is not called praising another but \"taking turns in commendation.\" Such comparisons are countless and beyond reckoning.\n\nYet people perform a small good deed and immediately expect blessings in return—how is this different? The perfected and superior person does not act thus. If others do not aid me, I alone secretly aid them, and I will surely receive good karmic retribution. If all others commit evil deeds, I alone do good, and I will surely receive good retribution. If others do not contribute to me, I alone delight in contributing to them, and I will surely receive good retribution. If others do not share food and drink with me, I alone share with them, and I will surely receive good retribution. If all others practice deceit and hypocrisy to deceive me, I alone treat them with sincerity and trust, and I will surely receive good retribution. Such comparisons are countless and beyond reckoning.\n\nIf today I show kindness to another and expect repayment, yet they do not repay, I grow resentful—this must not be. The perfected and superior person seeks the grace of Heaven; the middling person seeks the grace of others; the foolish do not perform good to respond to Heaven, nor do they exert effort to respond to others, yet vainly seek blessings—truly, this is shameful.\n\nIf one is wealthy, noble, and wise in this life, it is because they performed good deeds in a past life and now receive this blessing. If, in this life of wealth, nobility, and wisdom, one grows greedy and refuses to give alms or act in accordance with cause and effect, then in the next life they will return to poverty, lowliness, and ignorance—present karmic conditions are no different.\n\nThen a gāthā was spoken:\nUnderstanding the empty principle,\nAll thoughts are resolved.\nWhen the meeting occurs,\nTogether you enter the wondrous gate.\nAt ease and as you wish—\nSuch are these methods.\nWithout end,\nBriefly, the essentials are made clear.\nYou should know:\nSimply practice good thoughts.\nContemplate all things,\nEven in dark and hidden places.\nAll attain illumination,\nThe wondrous form of non-action.\nAll are made complete,\nSuch are the benefits.\n\n*The Numinous Talisman of the Scripture of Ascending Communication*\n*Scripture of Ascending Communication of the Shangqing Realm* concludes.",

Forget the heart-mind, extinguish the heart-mind. From start to finish, direct intention. Whether in movement or stillness, in action or form, be as still as cold ashes, as silent as withered wood. Extinguish all perceptions, extinguish all thoughts, extinguish all heart-minds. Then, with each arising thought, let it be forgotten at once—spirit moves without hindrance.\n\nReturn the heart-mind to stillness, truly arrive at the Dao-ground. This is called turning the heart-mind toward the Dao, revering the profound and true Dao. Blessings descend without end, disasters dissolve before they manifest.\n\nPractice according to one’s capacity, exhausting wholehearted devotion. With a cinnabar heart, gaze toward the ten directions. Burn incense, prostrate in worship, move body and heart-mind, surrender body and life, reverently honor the Dao Ancestor and the Three Treasures. Offer pure wealth to purchase various incenses, oils, the eight delicacies, and a hundred flavors. Prepare feasts for offerings, invite and command Daoist masters, return the heart-mind in supplication, earnestly beseech the Perfected.\n\nThrough such directed heart-mind, wash away all dust and burdens. Past-root transgressions, karmic afflictions, the errors of life and death—all are purified by utmost sincerity. Through fasting and myriad good deeds, inner and outer become thoroughly illuminated, universally illuminating the ten directions, enabling all beings to gain penetrating vision. Such merit is boundless, beyond conception.\n\nIf one observes the fast and precepts, concentrates the mind upon the supreme Dao, and dissolves the ten thousand concerns, forgetting both self and others, then in the empty chamber, clarity arises—true numinous response. This is the cultivation of the most supreme Dao.\n\nIf one generates the unsurpassed heart-mind, desiring to return and turn toward the Dao, one must first uphold the fast, awaken the original heart-mind, rescue the impoverished souls of the seven ancestors above, and extend to one’s own body below. Dispel disasters, cross over calamities, increase and prolong blessings and longevity. With solitary utmost sincerity, establish the fast and open the way for deliverance. Necessarily, souls transcend the nine nights, spirits refine in the Three Clarities. Life becomes distant and long, immortals attain the Dao. Aspiring to worthies, yearning for the Dao, use their abundance to open one’s lack, use their virtue to dispel one’s ignorance. Break through stinginess and greed, accomplish lofty conduct. Purify body and heart-mind, circulate spirit and qi. Coming and going without end, without obstruction or blockage.\n\nPray to Heaven and Earth, supplicate the luminous spirits. One must sever demonic influences, purify inner and outer. All desire to dissolve the ten thousand conditions, still the six emotions. Universally wash the troubled heart-mind, universally realize all perceptions.\n\nThus, those who study the Dao but do not diligently practice, who do not cultivate fasting and precepts, will find it difficult to reach the Perfected—idly laboring in the mountains and forests.\n\nAll who uphold the fast and strictly observe the precepts must desire to practice the Dao, return and honor the Supreme Clarity. Seek the true, study the Dao, refine qi, and prolong life. Universally extend to humans and heavens, universally aid the ordinary and the sagely.\n\nYet the conduct of superior practitioners is not something the common can uphold.\n\nThe Golden Register’s regulations and standards protect and secure the nation’s destiny, dispel disasters, and prolong life.\nThe Jade Register’s essential standards safeguard the altars of soil and grain, eternally ending warfare.\nThe Yellow Register’s correct model opens the way for souls, universally extending to life and death. Sages and ordinary alike cultivate together, naturally broadly delivering the hidden and manifest, universally rescuing all the solitary and obstructed, universally saving all suffering souls in the nine dark realms.\n\nOn the Three Primes, the eight solar terms, one’s original destiny, and birthdays, study the Dao and cultivate the body. Repent transgressions, seek blessings, rescue those in the three paths, the five sufferings, the eight difficulties, the calamities of imprisonment, illness, and death. Uphold and recite divine incantations to repel and expel pestilence, seasonal epidemics, demonic influences, and perverse qi.\n\nFurthermore, there are scriptures such as the *Golden Chamber*, *Celestial Treasure*, *Orthodox Unity*, *Great Peace*, *Five Refinements*, and *Essential Teachings*. Diligently practice the Dao, follow the correct models, each possessing its own scripture.\n\nThus a gāthā says:\nBurn incense, establish the fast—\nMerit boundless.\nThe sweet dew of Dharma-food,\nLiberation as its broth.\nManifest their abundance,\nReveal all lands.\nMake offerings to the ten directions,\nBoundless Dao-treasures.\nAnd all beings,\nCultivating pure lands.\nTeach and transform beings,\nMastering dignified conduct.\nBestow fearlessness,\nGenerate the unsurpassed Dao.\nUniversally extend supplication,\nDemonstrating its practice.\n\n*Penetrating Vision Scripture’s Numinous Talisman*\n*Taiqing Realm Penetrating Vision Scripture*   Concluded.",

They mobilize will and heart, invoking the descent of true numina. They circulate qi and spirit, causing their influence to pervade heaven and earth. Thus, entering the oratory to ascend the altar, reciting scriptures and prostrating, paying homage to the Perfected and repenting transgressions—all these are comprehensive Dao-practices. Circumambulating the altar thrice, they follow the original methods for all assemblies of repentance, supplication, or gratitude.\n\nWhether for heaven and earth, the emperor, the realm, the people, ancestral generations, oneself, one’s family, the Three Wretched Paths and Five Sufferings, or the Six Destinies and Four Births—all require the establishment of fasts, the practice of the Dao, the burning of incense, and prostration with scripture-recitation and hymns. For all supplications, one must observe the fast. When the realm suffers calamities—war raging on all sides, the people afflicted by pestilence, drought, flood, or death—all dire perils necessitate the observance of fasts.\n\nWhen creating scriptures or images, constructing halls, palaces, monasteries, grottoes, or mountain retreats, establishing Daoist sanctuaries, or crafting bells, chimes, ritual instruments, or celestial music—all such meritorious deeds require reverence. One must broadly establish pure fasts, earnestly extend supplications, recite scriptures and invoke the Dao, sever all evil thoughts, augment inner and outer goodness, and extol boundless merit.\n\nFor all scripture-recitation, prostration, and incense-offering, one must follow the scriptures precisely: thrice offering incense, thrice bowing, thrice performing the ninefold prostration, straightening the body and touching the head to the ground, chanting the jade-like tones in harmonious accord, ensuring no discord. Thus, all who see or hear shall rejoice together, praising in unison, propagating the Dao and its teachings. Such merit is inconceivable, an immeasurable and boundless wisdom.\n\nMoreover, through this merit, past ancestors ascend to pure realms, present kin enjoy bliss, and future rebirths dwell perpetually in blessed pure lands, where clothing and sustenance arise naturally. Therefore, cultivate this pure heart and universally adorn all. Array myriad incense, flowers, lamps, and candles as offerings, universally presenting them to the deities of the Three Realms, the Four Offices and Five Emperors, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, and the one hundred twenty divine ministers. Earnestly extend supplications to invoke blessings, prolong life, dispel disasters, and transcend calamities, safeguarding this servant’s body and universally benefiting all sentient beings—those of the heavenly, earthly, human, animal, hungry ghost, and hellish destinies—dissolving all suffering.\n\nFurther, by maintaining fasts with focused intent, relinquishing greed and attachment, abstaining from sensory indulgence, and donating scriptures or images according to one’s means, one encourages others to broadly cultivate karmic affinities. Such benefits are inconceivable: seven generations of parents escape suffering and ascend to heaven, enjoying carefree bliss; households live in harmony, flourishing across generations; karmic bonds with the Dao dissolve transgressions, perfecting virtue and wisdom; the world attains great peace, all nations harmonize; and all beings escape suffering, entering the true and correct.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, bow to the Supreme, Correct, and True Three Treasures, extolling their merit. For all future lives, establish karmic affinities of goodness, dispelling ignorance and receiving sagely grace. A hundred blessings adorn, ten thousand virtues gather like clouds, benefiting all beings, liberating them from suffering. Make offerings and pay reverence to the compassionate teachings. May one forever uphold them, burning incense morning and night to seek blessings. May they circulate throughout the world without negligence.\n\nA gāthā says:\nWith skillful expedient wisdom,\nManifesting as one wills,\nAccomplishing all beings,\nUnobstructed and thorough.\nBeyond existence and non-existence,\nWithout self or other,\nConstantly uphold good vows,\nEncouraging others to awaken.\nLet them seek supreme goodness,\nFar from evil paths.\nAttain fearlessness,\nThe pure fruit of the Dharma.\nAll unobstructed,\nUniversally enter the Dharma-gates.\nAll who possess this heart\nShall all attain liberation.\n\n*Numinous Talisman of the Assembly of Immortals Scripture*\n*Taiqing Realm Assembly of Immortals Scripture* Concluded.\n\n**Supreme Thirty-Six Divisions of Revered Scriptures: *Taiqing Realm Scriptures* (Volume I)**\n\n**Taiqing Scripture, *Penetrating Vision Scripture, Assembly of Immortals Scripture, Cavern Abyss Scripture, Esoteric Scripture, True Unity Scripture*** – The above six scriptures share one scroll.\n\n**Taiqing Realm *Cavern Abyss Scripture*** (Chapter Four)\n\nWithin the *Great Cavern Taiqing Scripture*, jeweled clouds and jade thrones, five-colored auspicious clouds fill the empty sky without end.

They must exhaust utmost sincerity. After receiving scriptures, they dare not resent the Dao or blame the master, nor carelessly divulge or slight sacred texts, lest calamity befall their seven ancestors, subjecting them to judgment in the netherworld courts.\n\nIf there are those of utmost integrity who exhaust their cinnabar sincerity, whose virtue and conduct are pure and simple, whose actions are upright, and whose generations are renowned—whose bodies and minds are both pure—yet have not encountered the secret essentials of the Dao’s canon, they should earnestly turn toward the Dao, seeking a master to initiate and deliver them, ascending to blessed fruits and advancing toward the unsurpassed Dao.\n\nOnce possessing scriptures and methods, they must unite in heart and intent, awaiting numinous response. They must not outwardly feign dignified conduct while inwardly harboring complacency, falsely praising themselves and disparaging others, claiming this is right and that is wrong, or envying those superior to themselves.

      "translated_text": "The great scriptures of the Three Caverns are transmitted only after set durations: the highest sages bestow them upon perfected transcendents and superior immortals after forty thousand kalpas; divine immortals after four thousand years, or a thousand years, or seven hundred years; and in the mundane world, after forty years. Should one truly comprehend these scriptures, it would be deemed inconceivable. Even the wise and discerning deem them rare to encounter—how much more so for those of shallow learning in the Dao, who could scarcely attain them? If there be scholars who wholeheartedly devote themselves to a single assembly, they must exert their utmost sincerity, uphold their vows in perpetuity, and with refined devotion move the divine spirits, never betraying their original resolve. Persisting without slack, they too may ascend to the ranks of immortality and attain the unsurpassed Dao. Yet one must fear the lack of resolve, lest halfway they abandon themselves, repeatedly harming the Dao—not only achieving no merit, but incurring transgression. You all should trust my words, adhere to the teachings and precepts, and widely propagate them.\n\nFor all invocations and petitions, one must receive and uphold them in accordance with the method: compose the mind, assume a dignified demeanor, arrange the sequence in order, proceed with graceful steps, heed the twelve double-hours’ bell, hold flowers and lead with hymns, grasp the ritual tablets and wield the censer, raise the banners and establish the truths, and ascend the altar with solemn composure. Whether Daoist priests or female officials perform rites for themselves or others—seeking blessings, repenting sins, or dispelling calamities—they must do so with wholehearted sincerity, earnestly praying, addressing and invoking with clear and harmonious speech, ensuring the text and reasoning are upright. They must not jest with melodies, modulate their voices in exaggerated rises and falls, or mingle their words and tones to provoke astonishment. Whether conducting rituals, offering thanks, chanting praises, or expounding teachings, all must be practiced until fluent. They should not falter or break off midway, leaving the text and reasoning disjointed. Such lapses not only disrupt the solemnity of the invocation but may also invite misfortune. In every matter, one must concentrate, adhere to the original forms and rituals, and thereby gain boundless, immeasurable blessings and manifold benefits. The celestial perfected will rejoice, all methods will harmonize in beauty, and through such merit, eternal felicity shall be attained.\n\nAnd the gatha says:\nPurity is the fruit of the Dharma, greatly to be extolled.\nPurity is the medicine of the Dharma, curing all ills.\nPurity of heart is supreme, tranquility and bliss are ultimate.\nPurity and solemnity are equal, boundless and without limit.\nThe worldly methods of the Dao dispel all poisons.\nFirst, they relieve hunger and thirst, transforming all beings,\nEnabling them to achieve perfection and sever all delusions.\nEver abiding in good deeds, one attains profound depth in the Dharma.\n\nThe *Wondrous Talismans of the Abyssal Cavern Scripture*\nThe *Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Abyssal Cavern* concludes.",

Now, by good fortune, they may be heard. Those who receive and uphold them, practicing the Dao, expounding their teachings, and reciting the true scriptures, should place five-colored flowers in a container. With each practice of the Dao and chanting of goodness, scatter them into the empty void—this is called \"scattering flowers,\" offered to declare one’s vows.\n\nWhen reciting this scripture, one should first circumambulate it once, hold incense, bow in reverence, perform the three prostrations, sit upright, purify with water, and waft incense to sanctify the scripture. Concentrate the spirit, gather qi, praise and take refuge, and humbly make entreaties—only then may one attain blessings beyond conception.\n\nThe celestial perfected keep their secrets hidden, unknown to the world, which is why those who cultivate truth and nurture qi rarely grasp these essential texts. I shall now briefly elucidate them; you must listen and receive without distraction, that you may truly hear.\n\nThe superior adept regards silence as the cultivation of qi—this is preserving qi, yet it leads to dullness. To inhale purity and exhale impurity is the exchange of qi, yet it leads to emptiness. Dullness scatters qi and maddens the spirit; the true numen grows weary and finds no refuge. Emptiness leaves the cinnabar field barren; breath control is labored in vain, and qi cannot abide. These are not true methods of nurturing qi but invite illness, mistaken for \"embryonic breathing,\" harming one’s nature and life. Many err in this way.\n\nSwallowing and gulping, gathering qi to refine the spirit, pointing to it as \"returning the elixir\"—this harms one’s nature and life. Many err in this way.\n\nTo exist as if continuous, entrusting qi to harmonize with the spirit, exhaling and inhaling with intent to abide, drawing qi inward without release, sealing breath to temper the form—one swallow after another, gathering both flanks, taking empty swallowing as the method—this is borrowing qi to draw water, an irrigation technique, yet deemed a means to secure the body’s field, only to deplete oneself. Many err in this way.\n\nSitting upright, raising the body, filling the four great elements with qi, circulating the blood and channels, nourishing and protecting with harmony—this is the method of \"dispersing qi to burn the body.\" Yet these are not true ways of nurturing qi but are mistaken for \"congealing the spirit in seated oblivion,\" only to lose the body and harm life. Many err in this way.\n\nAll such practices are mere techniques; where technique is established, the Dao vanishes. Those who cultivate truth must use technique to illuminate the Dao and thereby attain it. Seeking the Dao through the generation of heaven and earth, one may grasp it. Those who lose the Dao rely on the qi of emptiness and spontaneity to engender chaos, yet chaos alone preserves the Dao. When chaos is pierced to form the seven apertures, chaos dies, and heaven and earth arise. Once heaven and earth are divided, the Dao is difficult to preserve in full.\n\nHeaven and earth unite yin and yang to move; spirit and qi activate, giving rise to humans and beasts. When spirit and qi are still, grasses, trees, mountains, and stones emerge. Yet when humans are born through the union of male and female, and grasses and trees through seeds, the mechanism of heaven and earth’s transformation is already extinguished. To rely on technique is to lack the mechanism of heaven and earth—how can one speak of the Dao?\n\nCultivating truth and nurturing qi is to preserve the Dao in full. Aligning with the qi of heaven and earth to cultivate truth and nurture qi, one may attain profound stillness, ever-responsive yet ever-quiet, abiding in non-action as if in action, and in action as if in non-action—only then may one speak of the Dao.\n\nAnd the gatha says:\nThis Dao is practiced as one,\nYet without form.",

      "translated_text": "How can there be techniques? Only a rough outline may be shown. All sentient beings may attain liberation. By exhorting and guiding others, one leads them into the gate of truth. This is rare and wondrous, manifesting boundlessly, inexhaustible in its use, and thus employed to guide others. Bestowing fearlessness and rectifying the intentions of learners, let none be deluded by a single technique or entangled in manifold vows.\n\nThe *Inner Secret Scripture of Talismans* within the Taiqing Realm concludes here.\n\n**Taiqing Realm Scripture of the Thirty-Six Venerable Scriptures**\n*Taiqing Scripture, Thorough Vision Scripture, Assembly of Immortals Scripture, Cavern Abyss Scripture, Inner Secret Scripture, True One Scripture*—the above six scriptures share a single fascicle.\n\n**Taiqing Realm True One Scripture, Chapter Six**\nThe qi of the True One arises from the Dao, receives qi to come into being, and is perfected by qi—this is called *ming* (life-destiny). From the True One, form is endowed, and one’s *xing* (nature) may be preserved whole. The movement of *xing* and *ming* is governed by the heart. When the heart engages in thought, it is called *yi* (intention). The movement of *yi*, when it involves contemplation, is called *zhi* (will). When contemplation culminates in accomplishment, with nothing unconsolidated, it is called *zhi* (wisdom). Wisdom that encompasses all things is called *lü* (deliberation). That which moves to nourish the body is called *hun* (ethereal soul). That which stills to stabilize the body is called *po* (corporeal soul). That which flows through bones and flesh is called *blood*. Preserving form, nurturing spirit, and gathering qi is called *jing* (essence). When spirit harmonizes and delights, and qi is pure and unburdened, it is called *he* (harmony). When spirit gathers qi and thereafter engages in nurture and protection, encompassing the hundred bones, it is called *shen* (body). When all images are fully manifest, it is called *xing* (form). When inert and unmoving, it is called *zhi* (substance). When form and appearance are regulated, it is called *ti* (frame). When small and large are distinct, it is called *qu* (trunk). When myriad thoughts cannot grasp it, it is called *shen* (spirit). When vast and transformative, it is called *ling* (numinous). When qi enters the body, it is called *sheng* (life); when qi departs from form, it is called *si* (death). That which pervades life is called the Dao.\n\nThe Dao exists yet has no form; it is formless yet possesses essence. Its transformations are unfathomable, pervading the numinous. All living beings naturally attain their life and sustenance, thus preserving the Dao in its rough outline. They also attain their generation and completion, all of which should be natural and not contrary to principle. You should follow my words to broadly propagate the teachings, without allowing deviant views to arise and disrupt true reality. Exhort others to cultivate the Dao, which is to cultivate the heart. Teach others to cultivate the heart, and the Dao may be seen thereby. The Dao cannot be seen directly—it is seen through the heart. The Dao cannot be heard directly—it is heard through the heart. All hearing and seeing of the Dao arise through the heart. The heart cannot be constant; it is guarded by the Dao. If not guarded by the Dao, and one follows the heart’s hearing and seeing, this is to enter a heterodox school, never to attain liberation or hear the Dharma.\n\nThus, the multitudes of heavenly immortals, the great sages and perfected beings of the heavens, and the countless hosts of celestial perfected ones—having heard my teachings—came to know the Dao. If one can further empty the heart to dispel its substance, be without heart to dispel its existence, stabilize the heart to render it unmoving, still the heart to render it unconfused, rectify the heart to render it unerring, purify the heart to render it unstained, and cleanse the heart to render it unpolluted—you are not unaware of this. Yet you must constantly diligently practice, without allowing retrogression or obstruction. Know that all dharmas should be thus. If, within this, deviant views arise, one strays from the true Dao, loses all insight, and generates separate thoughts, mistaking them for wisdom—confusing body and mind, one turns away from the Dao and harms the true qi.\n\nSuch multitudes, due to their shallow karmic conditions in past lives, create obstructions to the true teaching. I now expound this so that you may all understand the heart, and in turn teach others, guiding their hearts to be upright, without reversal. When the heart is level, without high or low; when the heart is bright, never dim or obscure; when the heart is unobstructed, without hindrance—then, in the purity of body and mind, one awakens to all hearts and perceives all things clearly. Such merit is complete, inconceivable, immeasurable, and perfectly fulfilled.\n\nAnd the gatha says:\nYou who have not seen, have not heard—\nFrom this day forth, all shall see, all shall hear.\nWhen you take refuge in the Dao and practice this,\nPraise its merit, enter the ocean of merit.\nIn non-action, meet the Dao;\nWith mindful resolve, the mind arises.\nBoundless causes and conditions,\nBoundless karmic retribution.\nThe Dharma of non-action\nIs called the name of Dao-perfection.\nUnobstructed liberation—\nThis is the true Dao.\n\n**Talismans of the True One Scripture**\n*Taiqing Realm True One Scripture* concludes here.",

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the Taiqing Realm**\n*Collected Spirits Scripture, Central Essence Scripture, Immeasurable Mind Scripture, Collected Palaces Scripture, Yellow Court Scripture, Lesser Kalpa Scripture*\n*(The above six scriptures share a single scroll)*\n\n**Taiqing Realm Collected Spirits Scripture** (Chapter Seven)\n\nThe Heavenly Perfected Great Sages, the Utmost Perfected Great Spirits, the Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings of the Ten Directions and the Boundless Immeasurable, and all the assembled immortals gather in this place. Now that you have attained the Dao, you should know the supreme and victorious causes, which are the wondrous fruits. Together, turn your merits toward the gathering of spirits to aid the Dao, so that spirit and qi unite as one.\n\nIf you wish to hear these essential principles, you must uphold and practice my teachings, guiding all beings of the future to know my doctrine. All human bodies share the same original nature, yet through the seven emotions and six desires, they harm their fundamental nature and thus fail to hear my Dharma.\n\nNow that you have vowed to deliver all beings, you have gained such immeasurable wisdom and true heart. Cultivate few thoughts, few intentions, few desires, few affairs, few words, few laughs, few sorrows, few joys, few likes, few dislikes. Only then will your spirit-light remain undisturbed, your spirit and qi unconfused, and you may properly follow the Dao.\n\nAmong the multitude, those who think excessively will surely endanger their spirit; those who contemplate excessively will scatter their will; those with many desires will deplete their qi; those entangled in many affairs will exhaust their form; those who speak excessively will weaken their qi; those who laugh excessively will harm their viscera; those who grieve excessively will disperse their blood; those who indulge in excessive joy will cause their qi to overflow; those who rejoice excessively will disorder the hundred spirits; those who rage excessively will unsettle the hundred meridians; those who covet excessively will fall into confusion and disorder; those who hate excessively will become emaciated and joyless. Their original nature will be impure, their studies imprecise, and their qi will scatter of itself.\n\nEven if they encounter an enlightened teacher, they will not comprehend the true principle. Though they may know the methods of nurturing life, they will not awaken to the practice of cultivation. Thus, all they see and hear will not be the true Dao. Though they may understand the intent of refining the spirit, if they do not grasp the essentials of attaining the Dao, all they study and expound will not be the correct teaching.\n\nOne need not speak at length to obtain the Dharma. Therefore, those who cultivate the truth set their minds on the mysterious origin and willingly embrace solitude. Though active, they always appear serene and settled; though settled, they always appear active. When their qi is full and their merit complete, the five qi harmonize and flow smoothly, ascending to the origin. The Three Flowers gather at the crown, blood congeals and qi collects, the ten thousand spirits pay homage to the Perfected, all dwelling in the Upper Palace. There, wealth and honor flourish, pavilions and halls rise in splendor, jade lads and heavenly youths, jade maidens and heavenly maidens, the twelve celestial lads and twelve celestial maidens—all play celestial music, waft incense and flowers, unfurl banners and canopies, array reed pipes and flutes. Such magnificence transcends the mortal world, known as the Supreme Perfected Upper Realm, the Upper Palace of one’s own body.\n\nIf one cannot achieve liberation and remains attached, the hun-soul will scatter and the spirit become disordered. Should even a single thought arise in this state, one will fall into the deluded ford. Those who aspire to higher learning must, at this moment, remain unmoved by all circumstances. Only generate the supreme mind; only cultivate boundless merit. Only generate the supreme mind; only cultivate boundless wisdom. Only generate the supreme mind; only cultivate boundless goodness. Only generate the mind of unobstructed freedom, desiring to widely reach the ten directions, so that all beings of the immeasurable and boundless future may hear the true Dao. Do not arise any greedy thoughts, any perverse views, any delusive dreams, any obstacles, any afflictions, or any defiled attachments to desire.\n\nSuch is the true Dharma—vast beyond conception, beyond description. Only then will one know that the orthodox tradition emerges from the profound and obscure, not seeking petty confirmations that delude the true nature.\n\nAnd the gatha says:\nAll returns to reliance—\nIt is but a single condition.\nIf there is one whose virtue and conduct are complete,\nWho abandons the mind of action and generates the intent of non-action,\nWho does not distance themselves from revered virtue,\nNor draw near to the unkind,\nWho contemplates the Three Treasures without ceasing,\nNever wavering in resolve,\nAll practices perfected,\nVirtue fully attained,\nThe Dao accomplished without defilement or hindrance—\nYou should know this scripture thus.\n\n**Talismans of the Collected Spirits Scripture**\n*Taiqing Realm Collected Spirits Scripture* concludes here.\n\n**Taiqing Realm Central Essence Scripture** (Chapter Eight)\n\nAt that time, wishing to illuminate the true Dao, I emitted a five-colored radiant light, pervading the three thousand great thousand worlds. Within it, all manner of different worlds, heavens and hells, were fully revealed. The Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions and all the Great Perfected Immortals were also seen within it. The sufferings and joys of birth and death, the measure of karmic retribution, the stages of Daoist cultivation—all were seen within it. The lands of suffering and bliss were likewise revealed.\n\nThe assembly from the ten directions, as numerous as motes of dust and beyond counting, all beheld this radiant light. The boundless, immeasurable sufferings of hell-beings were also seen within this light. Then, the True Person of the Great Ultimate, through the power of great compassion, great mercy, and great wisdom, took pity on sentient beings, seeing their differing experiences of suffering and joy, the varying karmic retributions of heavens and hells. He only wished that the Heavenly Worthy, the Utmost Sage, would proclaim the teaching for the sake of all, delivering great benefit, enabling liberation, forever severing evil conditions, and swiftly rebirth in the Pure Land.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy addressed the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, saying: \"Now, by means of my qi, transform your bodies and descend to the Eastern Direction. If the people of a kalpa see the world’s suffering, then say: *The Heavenly Worthy of Jade Purity, who Bestows Blessings, delivers all from calamity.* For the wandering souls of the departed who have not yet transcended rebirth, say: *The Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure, Supreme August One, delivers all from stagnation.* In the Southern Direction, the Heavenly Worthy who Prolongs Life and Augments Destiny saves the living; the Heavenly Worthy of Mysterious Perfection and Myriad Blessings delivers the dead. In the Western Direction, the Heavenly Worthy of the Eight Trigrams who Protects the Body saves the living; the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Mystery delivers the dead...\"",

The mind, disturbed by circumstances, gives rise to the notion of establishing Dharma.\n\nYou should generate such vast, inconceivable, and immeasurable good causes, and not entertain divergent views.\n\nIn the Jade Purity Realm, I do not speak of all Dharmas. The Dharma categories of the Highest Purity Realm consist of eighteen gates illuminating seven stages. The Dharma categories of the Great Purity Realm consist of twenty gates illuminating nine stages.\n\nThe Orthodox Categories of the Numinous Treasure do not speak of all Dharmas. The Auxiliary Categories of the Numinous Treasure consist of fifty gates illuminating thirty-six categories. The Dharma categories of the Jade Void consist of twenty gates illuminating one stage, including esoteric methods of altar divination and augury.\n\nThe Dharma sections of the Northern Culmen of Heaven comprise twelve stages and categories. The seventh category, the *Illumination of the Four Sages*, also pertains to the third category of Fengdu, hence it is called the *Fengdu Summons and Inquisition*. The *Illumination of the Four Sages* and Fengdu together comprise twelve categories.\n\nThe seventh category, the *Three-Five Conjoint Illumination*, pertains to spirit possession. The fifth category of Fengdu pertains to summons and inquisition. The *Illumination of the Four Sages* comprises seven stages, the *Fengdu Illumination* five categories, and the *Numinous Writings Below the Dipper* thirty-six gates illuminating four stages, including mirror-water incense illumination, *Three-Five Paper Illumination*, and *Fengdu Earth Illumination*—all serve universal purposes.\n\nCultivators of the Dao who have not yet attained the wondrous realm should generate such a mind, delivering all living beings, concentrating their thoughts on the utmost truth, without arousing greed or seeking karmic rewards. Through gradual accumulation and long practice, they may gradually enter the initial vehicle.\n\nIf, within the Dharma, they again generate greed and craving, they will lose the true Way and incur immeasurable transgressions.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Perfected Great Spirits, the Utmost Perfected Great Spirits, the Immeasurable Flying Heavenly Great Spirits, and all the sagely hosts of the heavens, having heard this exposition, each rejoiced and spoke thus: If there are Dao-adherents who can generate such a mind, desiring to deliver all beings from suffering, we shall transform our bodies and descend, commanding the great generals of the heavens and the divine officers and soldiers of the ten directions and four quarters to assist in upholding the Dharma, enabling all sentient beings and the immeasurable beings of the six paths and four births to prolong their lives, the dead to revive, the sick to recover, and ghosts, demons, and malevolent spirits to attain liberation. Enmities and grudges shall each be dissolved. Such benefits are indeed inconceivable.\n\nHaving thus generated good thoughts, they bowed their heads in reverence and gave thanks.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy then addressed the great assembly, saying: You are fortunate from past lives, having been born among humans and gods, enjoying all pleasures, clothed in celestial silks, and nourished by sweet dew. You are free from the cold and heat of the four seasons, from the darkness of day and night, and from the names of birth, old age, sickness, death, the three evil destinies, and the eight difficulties. The earth is level as a mirror, adorned with the seven treasures. The bodies you receive are pure in the six senses, unstained by the six dusts, and you constantly hear me expound the Dharma, increasing your wisdom.\n\nNow, having generated the mind of supreme wisdom, desiring to deliver all beings from suffering and enable all sentient beings to hear the Dharma, this is the greatest benefit.\n\nOnly those of meager merit, whose roots of faith are weak, though they hear this Dharma, encounter many obstacles, sinking into the苦 realms with no hope of escape. Such persons are difficult to deliver.\n\nThen a gatha is spoken:\nBehold the people of the world,\nall their obstacles and difficulties,\nthe afflictions of vexation—\nhard indeed to describe.\nUnknowing of turning toward the good,\nthey accumulate day and night,\nand having once obtained,\nagain generate greed and craving.\nThe various transgressions,\nimmeasurable and boundless.\nSome encounter grave illness,\ndying in vain.\nAfter death,\nthey return to the wheel of suffering.\nIf they do not hear the Dharma,\nthey shall never awaken.\nThe *Numinous Talismans of the Scripture of Immeasurable Meaning*\n**The Scripture of Immeasurable Meaning from the Taiqing Realm concludes here.**\n\n**The Scripture of Gathering Palaces from the Taiqing Realm, Tenth Chapter**\n\nWhen I expound the Dharma, all the gods and immortals of the heavens, all the great perfected ones, and all the sagely hosts, through the wondrous Dharma, shall attain lofty and luminous wisdom, becoming of one kind without distinction. Their countenances shall be subtle and wondrous, their Dao-conduct spontaneous, their voices harmonious and refined. Their palaces and abodes shall vary in height as they wish. At the arising of a thought, immeasurable jeweled nets and all manner of jeweled trees shall fully cover the ground. A natural, pure wind shall blow through the jeweled nets and trees, producing subtle and wondrous sounds. Those who encounter this wind shall find all their toils and defilements stilled.

They tread upon the void, walking through emptiness, and those who hear them find their minds opened and their understanding liberated, attaining the right fruit in accord with these virtuous sounds.\n\nThen a gentle breeze arises, and from the seven-jeweled trees issue subtle and wondrous tones, playing the celestial melodies of the gods. Spontaneous bliss arises, beyond all description.\n\nThe teachings expounded are of vast meaning, benefiting all sentient beings. In that realm, there is no self, no person—only purity, non-action, and wisdom ever triumphant. Such is the reward they attain.\n\nYet if there are those who, though born in human form, lack wisdom, their roots of faith feeble, who never hear the true Dharma nor behold the wondrous Dao, their reward is thus—due to the shallowness of their past accumulations.\n\nThereupon, the Perfected of Supreme Truth, the Celestial Perfected of Supreme Truth, and the immeasurable flying celestial spirits, having heard these words, all arise in reverence.

      "translated_text": "With hearts filled with joy, all manner of afflictions are swiftly dispelled, and one’s condition returns to its original state. All dharmas are likewise—yet there is nothing to be gained, nothing to be gained? What then is gained? Is there truly no attainment?\n\nThe wise attain through wisdom; with each thought, this mind constantly savors the flavor of the Dharma, advancing in diligence and attaining sagacity.\n\n*Collected Palace Scripture of the Numinous Talismans*\n*End of the Collected Palace Scripture of the Supreme Clarity Realm*\n\n*Supreme Thirty-Six Sections of the Venerable Scriptures*\n*Scripture of the Supreme Clarity Realm (Lower Section)*\n*Scripture of the Collected Numinous. Scripture of the Essence of the Center. Scripture of Immeasurable Meaning. Collected Palace Scripture. Scripture of the Yellow Court. Scripture of the Lesser Kalpa*\n*(The above six scriptures share the same scroll)*\n\n*The Scripture of the Yellow Court of the Supreme Clarity Realm (Chapter Eleven)*\n\nBeings take diverse forms, yet their birth arises from a single qi. The hun-soul is received from Heaven, while the body and po-soul are received from Earth. Without form or image, they come from the emptiness of space, merely borrowing father and mother to transform non-being into being. After three hundred days, the fetus is complete; once the gestation is fulfilled, birth occurs—thus does non-being become being.\n\nTherefore, the spirit takes qi as its mother, and qi takes form as its dwelling. Refining qi gives rise to spirit; refining form returns it to qi. If the yang-spirit has not gathered, the Three Flowers will not enter the Mud Pill Palace. If the true qi has not ascended, the Five Colors will not arise in the Cinnabar Field.\n\nThus, though Heaven and Earth are vast, they cannot escape the signs of light purity and heavy turbidity. Though the sun and moon are bright, they cannot avoid the forms of waxing fullness and waning darkness. The accumulation of yang gives birth to spirit, which ascends to adorn Heaven as stars and constellations. The accumulation of yin gives birth to form, which descends to strengthen Earth as soil and stone.\n\nWithin water, qi rises, becoming mist and clouds. Within qi, water descends, becoming rain and dew. All phenomena and myriad beings cannot be without form; they gather numinosity to live and rely on the Dao to be perfected.\n\nThus, below the Three Clarities are the Three Supremes; within the Three Supremes are the Two Modes. Once the Two Modes are divided, the Five Emperors are arrayed; once the Five Emperors are established, they unite in a single realm. Within this Heaven and Earth, the qi of above and below—only in humans is essence the mother and qi the master. Each of the five viscera contains essence, and from essence qi is born. Each of the five viscera contains qi, and from qi spirit is born. Spirit can generate longevity, preserving life and destiny.\n\nRefine essence into the elixir; nurture qi into spirit. True immortals and sagely beings cultivate truth and nurture qi, naturally and spontaneously, with inner reality responding to outer signs. What they undertake is surely accomplished, ascending from the mundane to the sacred.\n\nIn the birth of a male, the right kidney forms first, enclosing external essence within internal blood—this is the wrapping of yin. In the birth of a female, the left kidney forms first, enclosing external blood within internal essence—this is the wrapping of yang.\n\nThe kidneys generate the spleen; the spleen generates the liver; the liver generates the lungs; the lungs generate the heart; the heart generates the small intestine; the small intestine generates the large intestine; the large intestine generates the gallbladder; the gallbladder generates the stomach; the stomach generates the inner kidneys; the inner kidneys generate the bladder; the bladder generates the Three Primes; the Three Primes generate the Triple Burner; the Triple Burner generates the Eight Vessels; the Eight Vessels generate the Twelve Channels; the Twelve Channels generate the Fifteen Collaterals; the Fifteen Collaterals generate one hundred eighty subsidiary collaterals; one hundred eighty subsidiary collaterals generate one hundred eighty encircling collaterals; one hundred eighty encircling collaterals generate thirty-six thousand grandchild collaterals; thirty-six thousand grandchild collaterals generate three hundred sixty-five bones; three hundred sixty-five bones generate eighty-four thousand hair pores.\n\nOnce the gestation is complete, the numinous radiance enters the body, and the child separates from the mother to become a person. Speaking of inner and outer: within the channels and collaterals is the inner; beyond the muscles and skin is the outer.\n\nTo nurture life is to nurture the five viscera, for the five viscera are the root—when the root is firm, the leaves flourish of themselves. To nurture form is to nurture the five qi, for the five qi are the source—when the source runs deep, the flow lengthens of itself.\n\nThe great circulation of true qi follows the primordial qi of Heaven; the minor circulation of true qi follows the primordial qi of the sun. Among the five viscera, the kidneys are the sea of essence, and the heart is the palace of qi. True essence resides in the kidneys, while surplus essence naturally returns to the lower Cinnabar Field. True qi resides in the heart, while surplus qi naturally ascends to the middle Prime, all converging in the true scene of the Yellow Court.\n\nThen he spoke in verse:\n*\"Contemplate the Dao and leave the household,*\n*Guiding and receiving sentient beings,*\n*That they may escape suffering*\n*And hear the teachings of the Dao.*\n*Bestowing benefit upon all,*\n*Immeasurable multitudes of beings,*\n*Attaining great spiritual power,*\n*All from the perfection of the Dao.*\n*Gaining fearlessness,*\n*Supernormal powers and freedom,*\n*Coming and going, returning,*\n*Without obstruction.*\n*Thus exists this Dharma,*\n*To ferry across the multitudes.*\n*Recognize the root of the Dharma,*\n*And the causes for entering the Dao.\"*\n\n*Numinous Talismans of the Scripture of the Yellow Court*\n*End of the Scripture of the Yellow Court of the Supreme Clarity Realm*",

The above six scriptures share a single scroll.\n\n*Scripture of the Lesser Kalpa of the Supreme Clarity Realm* – Chapter Twelve\n\nHeaven and earth divide their forms and undergo transformations, revolving in accord with the reckoning of qi, thus giving rise to prosperity and adversity. The sun and moon revolve by virtue of heaven and earth, hence their brightness and dimness, fullness and waning; the constellations likewise follow their celestial paths, thus some halt while others proceed. Since humans receive the qi of heaven and earth to come into being, how could they be without calamity or fortune?\n\nTherefore, I expound the Dharma, ever urging you to broadly proclaim the true Dao, illuminating its essential teachings, that all the heavens and immortals, the immeasurable flying devas and great spirits, and the boundless assemblies of sages may together arise in praise, attaining the hearing of this teaching.\n\nThen the one above addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: \"I venture to ask—when the people below encounter calamity or adversity, what meritorious deeds should they perform, what practices should they cultivate, to escape all suffering and affliction and realize the supreme Dao?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: \"If one seeks all forms of liberation, to forever escape the cycle of rebirth and depart from the snares of doubt, there is nothing but to reverently recite and turn the scriptural texts, cultivate all meritorious deeds, perform prostrations and repentance, offer praise and extolment, burn incense and light lamps, fashion the Ten Absolute Banners, circumambulate and lecture on the scriptures, distribute alms to the poor and destitute, and liberate all living beings. Let the six desires and seven emotions remain ever unstained; let the three karmas and six senses never again be enacted. With concentrated thought and serene stillness, cast aside all distracting thoughts. Thus may one be reborn in the celestial realms, delighting in bliss and freedom, born into the halls of great fortune.\n\nIf there are those who suffer from illness, official entanglements, imprisonment in cangues and fetters, ensnarement in nets, pestilential toxins, seasonal epidemics, or prolonged misfortune—who find no means of escape—and if the consciousness of the departed still lingers in the depths, enduring the torments of hell, the merit of this scripture is indeed immeasurable. If one further broadly arouses the true heart, widely bestows the power of blessings, establishes Daoist altars, hangs banners and canopies, observes purification and repentance, and arranges vegetarian feasts, extending these to all the six paths and four modes of birth, to the host of orphaned souls and lingering spirits without refuge, to offer deliverance and salvation—if one does so with day and night reverence, with a sincere heart and earnest prayers—then all suffering and misfortune shall be dispelled in due time.\n\nThe immeasurable perfected ones bow their heads in praise, all acclaiming the excellent fruit, the benefit to sentient beings, and the great supernormal powers—such as these are indeed difficult to encounter even in a hundred thousand kalpas.\n\nThe intent of this scripture comprises seven aspects:\n1. **Attainment through wisdom**—each thought is the heart-mind;\n2. **Understanding through practice**—seeking the Dao and leaving the household;\n3. **Manifest benefit**—guiding and receiving sentient beings;\n4. **Beneficial application**—contemplating the sages;\n5. **Wisdom**—attaining great spiritual power;\n6. **Attainment of power**—gaining fearlessness;\n7. **Virtue fulfilled**—supernormal powers and freedom.\n\nThese seven aspects allow coming and going, returning without obstruction, thus possessing such subtlety and wonder. They serve as the medicinal Dharma for all sentient beings, delivering them from all calamities, illnesses, and sufferings.\n\nIf good men and women can attain understanding, receive the true and authentic discourse, recognize the fundamental power of the great Dharma, and enter the causes for the great Dao, then from the place of their thoughts, they shall gain immeasurable causes and conditions, attain the supreme, most true, and great wisdom—profound and wondrous beyond conception.\n\nFrom beginning to end, uphold and maintain this without slackening, forever preserving it without end. By practicing thus, all shall return to their true nature. The application shall yield profound and far-reaching effects, with true and real responses, boundless and unlimited.\n\nReveal to all sentient beings the power of such expedient means.\n\nThen he spoke in verse:\n*\"The supreme Dao is all-pervading,*\n*Equal and without obstruction.*\n*What the Great Vehicle practices,*\n*The Lesser Vehicle employs.*\n*Neither false nor real,*\n*Neither existent nor nonexistent.*\n*Turning the Wheel of Dharma,*\n*From beginning to end, it is accomplished.*\n*Only wondrous appearances exist,*\n*Non-action yet nothing left undone.*\n*Immeasurable causes and conditions,*\n*Sometimes departing, sometimes arriving.*\n*Thus is right awakening attained,*\n*Truly the wondrous body.*\n*All become subtle and marvelous,*\n*All arising from vows.\"*\n\n*Numinous Talismans of the Scripture of the Lesser Kalpa*\n*End of the Scripture of the Lesser Kalpa of the Supreme Clarity Realm*",
