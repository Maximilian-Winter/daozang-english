  "full_translation": "**The Taiping Jing Chao**\n**Title:** *Excerpts from the Scripture of Great Peace*\n*Compiler unknown; according to scholarly consensus, likely abridged by the Tang-dynasty Daoist Lüqiu Fangyuan from the original* Taiping Jing*. Comprising ten scrolls, each corresponding to one of the original scripture’s seventeen-part divisions.*\n\n**Source:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Taiping* Section\n\n---\n\n**Taiping Jing Chao, Scroll One of the Jia Division**\n\n**The Supreme August Emperor of the Golden Watchtower, the Later Sage Thearch and Teacher, the Chronologer of Cyclical Qi, the Advent of Balanced Energy, the Portents of the Coming and Going of Worthies and Sages, the Meritorious Practices of the Seed People, and the Foundational Establishment of the Law**\n\nSomeone asked: *\"The Three Sequences turn like a wheel—what departs must return. The people must have a lord. May we know his surname and given name?\"*\n\n*\"Excellent! Why do you ask this again?\"*\n\n*\"True teachers are rare to encounter, and propitious times pass swiftly. Overcome with longing, I humbly seek to hear of this. Though dull and reckless, my reverence runs deep.\"*\n\n*\"Ah, this is no transgression. Heaven has moved you to ask, that later generations may be enlightened. Those who awaken will discern the true and cast off the false. Were I to remain silent, I fear Heaven would grow despondent, and chaos would never be pacified at the proper time. Sit in peace, and I shall recount it to you. You will then understand clearly, without doubt.\"*\n\n*\"The heavens and earth of antiquity and those of today share the same beginning and end, no different in essence. At first, all was good; later, evil arose. Between them, rise and decline alternate—one success, one failure. The Yang’s nine and the six complete a cycle, and when the six nines are fulfilled, great dissolution follows. Heaven and earth dissolve into chaos, and all beings perish. Only those who accumulate goodness escape, becoming the* **Seed People** *forever.\"*\n\n*\"Though the Seed People possess wisdom and understanding, their capacities still vary, not yet perfectly unified. Thus, they require a* **Teacher-Lord** *(*Junshi*). When the lord is sagely and the teacher enlightened, their teachings ensure immortality. Through cultivation, they attain sagehood—hence the name* **Seed People***. The Seed People are sages and worthies, the kind who attain* **long life**.*\"*\n\n*\"The supreme lord of long life is titled* **The Supreme True and Upright Primordial Wondrous Qi, the August Emperor of the Golden Watchtower of the Upper Clarity, the Later Sage Ninefold Mystery Thearch** *(*Jiuxuan Dijun*). His surname is* **Li***, a scion of the Most High Supreme One and an heir of the Jade Emperor’s Void and Nothingness. His qi first manifested in the* **Taihuang** *era, the fifteenth year of the* **Taihuang Emperor** *(*Taihuang Shijun*), in the* **bingzi** *year. His form took shape in the first year of* **Huangping** *(*Huangping Yuannian*), the* **jiashen** *year. On the third day of the ninth month in the seventh year of* **Shanghe** *(*Shanghe Qinian*), the* **gengyin** *year—a* **jiazi** *day at dawn, when the forces of punishment and virtue aligned—he was born in the* **Li Valley** *between the* **Tian’gang Sacred Realm** *and* **Renwu Pavilion** *on* **Penglai Mountain** *in the* **Northern Mystery Jade Kingdom***. His mother, the* **Mysterious Void Mother of the Supreme Mystery** *(*Shangxuan Xusheng Zhi Mu*), dwelt in the* **Ninefold Mystery Chamber** *within the* **Yin Valley of the Mysterious Void**.*\"*\n\n*\"At the onset of her pregnancy, she dreamed of dark clouds, the sun, and moon entwining her form, while the six qi’s lightning stirred her spirit. Through a profound union with the Yang Dao, she conceived the* **Perfected One** *(*Zhenren*). On the morning of his birth, three suns rose in the east. After his delivery, nine dragons spat divine water. Thus, his clan took its name from the* **Spiritual Valley** *(*Linggu*), and his given name from the radiance of the luminaries.\"*\n\n*\"At three years of age, his body embodied the Dao and congealed the true. His words blossomed like golden flowers. At five, he often gazed at the sun, rejoicing in its dawn, and faced the moon, sighing at its waning. Above, he observed the Yang qi’s brilliance; below, he witnessed the Yin Dao’s decay. Thereupon, he gathered his hun and harmonized his po, guarded the womb’s treasured spirit, recorded his essence, replenished his blood, and fortified his fluids to solidify his sinews.\"*\n\n*\"At seven, he learned to swallow light and ingest mist, chewing the sun’s roots. By fourteen, he possessed a golden countenance and jade complexion. He abandoned worldly attachments and transcended emotions, embracing transformation to save the world. His purity moved the* **Primordial Simplicity** *(*Taisu*), and he received the teachings of the* **Three Origins** *(*Sanyuan*). He studied the* **Three Caverns** *(*Sandong*) and mastered the* **Nine Methods** *(*Jiufang*).\"*\n\n*\"At twenty-one, he dwelled in solitude, tempering his sharpness. At twenty-eight, he harmonized with the world while preserving his light. At thirty-five, he disseminated the* **Mysterious Ford** *(*Xuanjin*), and his merit and virtue spread far. At forty-two, he received the scriptures and was named* **Later Sage Thearch** *(*Housheng Dijun*). He was no different from those who had attained the Dao and become Thearchs in former heavens. His investiture was recorded for the present age—hence the title* **Later Sage***. The Dao of the Former Sage and the Later Sage is one and the same.\"*\n\n*\"He ascended to the halls of* **Upper Clarity** *(*Shangqing*), wandered the palaces of* **Great Ultimate** *(*Taiji*), and governed the ten directions of heaven. He was enfeoffed to oversee the billions upon billions of beings, inspecting the celestial rivers, seas, earth’s sources, and mountain forests. None failed to look up in obedience. He presided over the nine layers and ten tiers of heaven—hence the title* **Ninefold Mystery** *(*Jiuxuan*).\"*\n\n*\"At seventy, he determined the limitless span of his life, adapting to the proper times for concealment and manifestation. He edited the arts of* **not dying** *and compiled the methods of* **long life***. The treasured scriptures, talismans, and diagrams, along with the wondrous techniques of the Three Antiquities, were sealed in jade caskets, attended by divine officials. Their transmission followed strict protocols, their concealment and revelation governed by signs. He established canons and set forth teachings for the* **Seed People***. Those who cannot practice these are not* **Seed People**.*\"*\n\n*\"Now, as heaven and earth unfold, the era of pure wind recedes. The* **Huangping** *qi has withdrawn, and calamities surge unchecked. Since the age of the* **Upper Thearch** *(*Shanghuang*), and through the reigns of the Three and Five Sovereigns, wars, epidemics, floods, and fires have arisen in relentless succession. All stem from the billions of beings whose hearts are crooked and forms deceptive, who destroy the* **Five Virtues** *(*Wude*), contend through the* **Six Emotions** *(*Liuqing*), indulge in violence, and vie in aggression. They encroach upon one another, disregarding elders and juniors, confounding noble and base. Thus, the Two Modes lose order, the Seven Luminaries deviate from their paths, the Three Powers transform anomalously, omens and portents proliferate, spirits and ghosts clash, beings perish, and disasters strike repeatedly. Yet they remain blind and unrepentant, letting myriad evils run rampant beyond count.\"*\n\n*\"There are four great evils: war, disease, flood, and fire. When the Yang’s nine completes a cycle, and the solitary Yin flourishes, waters overflow. When the hundred sixes complete a circuit, and the Yang prevails, fires erupt. Before the time of Yao, there is no need to recount further. From the Tang onward, I shall briefly outline what is to come. You should heed and remember this, and urgently prepare to avoid calamity.\"*\n\n*\"After Yao’s flood, Tang suffered fire. Since then, minor floods and fires have occurred across the land, summoned by grave sins—not the great* **Yang Nine** *or* **Hundred Six** *cycles. Within the great Nine and Six, there must be major and minor* **jiashen** *years. The* **jiashen** *is the appointed time when ghosts confront humanity. Disasters vary in severity, and blessings and misfortunes differ in depth. As regions and years change, so do their shifts. For those of middling capacity, the appointed time arrives as foretold. For those above or below the middle, they may rise or fall, advance or retreat—ascending and descending without fixed order.\"*\n\nThose who do evil hasten their doom, while those who do good prolong their years. Without diligent progress, one cannot attain the Dao, and may only extend their allotted time according to the measure of their merit. Thus, the **Hundred Six** and **Yang Nine** cycles may arrive early or late, their great calendric constants adjusted in depth and degree.\n\nCounting from the *dinghai* year of the Tang era, forty-six years later, the *jiashen* year between them was a minor *jiashen*, bringing warfare, plague, and fire—disasters alternating, though not yet the great flood. Minor floods spread widely, their severity varying by year and region. Fifty-five years after another *dinghai*, the *jiashen* year between them was a major *jiashen*, when all three calamities struck together, followed by a great flood that swept all away.\n\nWhenever a major or minor *jiashen* arrives, the wicked are eradicated, and the good are spared. The good become the **Seed People**, while the wicked become the **Chaotic Dregs**. Before the appointed time is over, myriad portents arise in profusion: pestilential toxins surge above, warfare and fire rage below, and floods burst forth from no fixed direction, drowning the wicked in turn. During this fifteen-year span—extending to thirty years—annual disasters grow severe, the worthy and sagely go into hiding, and the great Dao’s divine beings dispatch perfected immortals and superior adepts to traverse the land, teaching with patient guidance. They exhort the high and urge on the low: those who follow become the Seed People, while those who resist are drowned, becoming the Chaotic Dregs, their wickedness utterly purged. Of the Seed People, the most virtuous—barely one in ten—remain, while of the middling and lesser good, half are destroyed, and the surviving half flourish and grow day by day. Only then do sagely rulers, enlightened masters, and great ministers descend and appear.\n\nAfter the minor *jiashen* and before the *renshen* year, if the ruler of the minor *jiashen* is sagely and wise, stern yet benevolent, harming neither principle nor order, he may extend his years and attain long life. Through devoted study, he may even achieve immortality, though without deep mastery of the **Scriptures of Great Peace** or prolonged practice of its teachings, the era of Great Peace will be brief, and his name cannot be fixed. Those who practice it have their names inscribed in the Azure Register by the **Controller of Destiny**; those who do not are recorded in the Black Script. The Black Script means death; the Azure Register means life. The ledgers of life and death reside in the **Hall of Light** in Heaven. The Dao of Heaven is impartial, favoring only the good. Those who cultivate and fulfill the Great Peace become the Great Peace. Those who achieve the Lesser Great Peace align their virtue with the Lord of Great Peace. The Lord of Great Peace whose name is fixed is Lord Li. In the *renchen* year, on the sixth day of the third month, he will manifestly appear in the world, riding the **Three Pure Radiance Chariot**, followed by ten thousand flying carriages and dragons. He will elevate the good as Seed People and scholars as immortal officials, establishing disciplines and statutes to reward virtue, suppress evil, curb the roots of sin, and supervise those who advance in blessed deeds. Those who persevere without slackening will achieve perfection as divine transcendents, aligning their virtue with the Emperor. Those who slacken and fall into evil will have their wickedness daily recorded, destined to become the later Chaotic Dregs.\n\nThe lofty and wise, with keen insight and unwavering clarity, must diligently progress, inwardly cultivate the Emperor’s teachings, and remember the great divine lord’s assistants without fail. The sagely ruler, enlightened ministers, and numinous officials will aid people in attaining deathlessness, becoming Seed People forever, ascending as immortal transcendents, and ultimately attaining the rank of the **Later Sage**. The Later Sage, Lord Li’s Grand Preceptor, is surnamed Peng. He studied the Dao before Lord Li and holds the position of **Left Perfected of the Grand Tenuity**. During the era of the **Human Sovereign**, he was commanded by the **Lord of the Dao of the Sovereign** to protect and invest the people, serving as Lord Li’s Grand Preceptor, governing from the **Northern Pond Palace of the Grand Tenuity** at the **Luminous Upper Terrace**. Every two thousand five hundred years, he changes his name, traversing the Great Void, circling the Eight Darknesses, ascending to the Utmost Above, and descending to the Utmost Below. Rare are the true officials who have glimpsed his radiant countenance.\n\nThe **Lord of the Azure Lads of the Fangzhu Palace** is the Later Sage Lord Li’s **Grand Minister**.\nThe **Southern Culmen Lord of the Great Cinnabar Palace** is the Later Sage Lord Li’s **Grand Guardian**.\nThe **Lord of the Great Simplicity of the White Mountain Palace** is the Later Sage Lord Li’s **Grand Tutor**.\nThe **Governor of All Perfected of the Western City Palace** is the Later Sage Lord Li’s **Grand Steward**.\n\nThese five—one master and four assistants—are collectively called the **Assistants**. The term *assistant* signifies a father and a support: revered like a father, they ensure the master’s teachings are carried out. Together, they are called assistants; separately, they are the **Left Assistant**, **Right Assistant**, **Front Deliberator**, and **Rear Attendant**. The *attendant* voices opinions, initiates actions, fills omissions, and completes tasks, making decisions and proclaiming them—this is the steward. The *deliberator* ponders unresolved matters, illuminating and clarifying them—this is the tutor. The *assistant* (right) ensures certainty and prevents errors—this is the guardian. The *assistant* (left) aids the ruler and follows the master, guiding all into the Dao—this is the minister. The four and five assess omens, thoroughly weighing approval and disapproval, promoting and expanding the true transformation—together, they are called the **Assisting Masters**.\n\nIn times of leisure, when facing forward, one may consult the **Deliberating Tutor** for unresolved questions; when looking back, the **Attending Steward** for overlooked concerns; to the right, the **Guarding Assistant** for unclear matters; and to the left, the **Assisting Minister** for what remains obscure. By consulting the four assistants—guardian, tutor, steward, and minister—success lies with the master; none can be lacking. The sagely emperor set this model for later generations to follow.\n\nInwardly, there is the **Guardian**, who manages affairs—this pertains to the right, the treasure of quiescent perfection. Outwardly, there is the **Master**, who manages affairs—this pertains to the left, where movement returns to stillness. This is most difficult, hence the focus on the assistants and master. When looking forward, there is the **Tutor**, who expounds and discusses the Dao’s essence. When looking back, there is the **Steward**, who decides right and wrong. The remaining public ministers, officials, immortal transcendents, and sage ranks—three hundred sixty-one in number—command thirty-six thousand, who in turn lead three hundred sixty thousand. The people number ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, and myriadfold. Twenty-four perfected beings are constantly sent to secretly instruct those with sincere hearts, all subordinate to the **Grand Minister of Fangzhu**. This cannot be fully described; one must carefully contemplate the great and independently investigate the small.\n\nExcellent! Today’s questions have resolved my doubts, and I have heard your instructions anew.\n\nIt is asked: What practices did Lord Li consistently follow to attain such lofty transcendence? May we hear of the Grand Preceptor’s and the four assistants’ studies?\n\nExcellent indeed! You ask on behalf of those who are foolish, who wander lost and do not believe in the Dao, whose learning lacks firmness, whose progress and retreat lack constancy, and who thus fall into lowly and bitter states—hence your earnest inquiry. Now I shall explain it to you.\n\nFrom the beginningless past until now, accumulated deeds have endured for ages; a single good or evil act cannot be fully recounted, and speaking of them brings no benefit. Here, I shall take only the recent practices by which one attains lofty nobility: the **Numinous Writ of Purple Texts** is the essential.\n\nThe **Great Lord of the Azure Lad**, Preceptor of the Lofty Dawn in the Jade Treasury of the Eastern Flower, purified himself in the Yellow Chamber of the Cold Numen Elixir Hall for three years before ascending to the **Golden Portals of the Supreme Clarity**. There, the Four Celestial Emperors reside, with the **Lord of the Great Peace Dao** stationed at their left and right, dwelling in the **Cavern-Real Jade Terrace of the Great Void**, within the **Jade Chamber of Equanimity** and the **Golden Flower’s Inner Sanctum**. Fifty thousand handmaidens—transcendent maidens and perfected beings—stand in attendance. Poisonous dragons and lightning tigers, celestial apes of the highest heavens, array themselves in venomous postures, guarding the gates and holding the passes. Giant toads a thousand fathoms long patrol the ramparts, while flying dragons and darting sparrows, leviathan roc and wondrous birds, clack their beaks and brandish their claws, filling the vast courtyard. The celestial majesty blazes resplendent, its radiance streaming in eight directions. Dark banners flutter in the wind, dancing pennants and canopies swirl. Jade trees chime with resonant tones, their gemmed branches murmuring of their own accord. Divine songs are sung in unison, phoenixes cry in profound harmony, spirit consorts join in chorus, unicorns dance and simurghs glide. The celestial harmony rings in eightfold resonance, uniting the nine harmonies and hundredfold gatherings.\n\nThe Azure Lad prostrated himself forward and received the **Numinous Writ of Purple Texts**, each oral transmission and secret formula contained within the scriptures numbering twenty-four. The first: **True Records** must be examined with care and memorized in darkness. The second: **Transcendent Taboos** must be studied in detail and preserved without forgetfulness.\n\nThe third: **Exploring the Flying Root**, one must swallow the essence of the sun.\nThe fourth: **Ingesting the Luminous Numinous Talisman**.\nThe fifth: **Ingesting the Moon’s Radiance**.\nThe sixth: **Ingesting the Yin-Generated Talisman**.\nThe seventh: **Restraining the Three Hun**.\nThe eighth: **Controlling the Seven Po**.\nThe ninth: **Wearing the August Image Talisman**.\nThe tenth: **Ingesting the Resplendent Elixir**.\nThe eleventh: **Ingesting the Yellow Water**.\nThe twelfth: **Ingesting the Returning Water**.\nThe thirteenth: **Consuming the Ring of Steel**.\nThe fourteenth: **Consuming the Phoenix Brain**.\nThe fifteenth: **Consuming the Pine Pear**.\nThe sixteenth: **Consuming the Plum Jujube**.\nThe seventeenth: **Ingesting the Water Decoction**.\nThe eighteenth: **Tempering White Silver and Purple Gold**.\nThe nineteenth: **Ingesting the Cloud’s Marrow**.\nThe twentieth: **Forging White Silver and Purple Gold**.\nThe twenty-first: **Crafting the Weight**.\nThe twenty-second: **Consuming Bamboo Shoots**.\nThe twenty-third: **Consuming Swan’s Dried Meat**.\nThe twenty-fourth: **Wearing the Five Spirit Talismans**.\n\nMastery of these twenty-four practices grants boundless transformation, allowing one to transcend beyond the Three Realms and wander freely within the Six Directions. No calamity can harm them, no demonic or malevolent forces dare oppose them—all submit of their own accord. Their rank attains the ultimate in the Daoist lineage, and their grace flows to all beings, both hidden and manifest, who rely upon it.\n\nThose who disbelieve or refuse, who remain ignorant or blind, choose darkness for themselves, forever estranged from the Dao. They wallow in suffering and venomous affliction, entangled in the mire of vexation. Though great compassion pities them, nothing can be done.\n\nAlas! Those of noble aspiration—act swiftly, act swiftly, and do not betray these words.\n\nIt is said: Excellent, excellent! Today my doubts are questioned, and I have heard the command anew.\n\n*Excerpt from the First Scroll of the* **Abridged Canon of Great Peace, Supreme Purity Section, First Volume** *concludes.*\n\n---\n*[Note: The following colophon and scholarly annotations are not part of the translation but are retained for editorial context as per the original text.]*\n#1 According to textual analysis, this scripture is believed to be a fabrication by Shangqing Daoist practitioners of the Northern and Southern Dynasties, rather than an authentic excerpt from the original *Abridged Canon of Great Peace, First Volume*. The *Abridged Canon of Great Peace, Gui Section* is considered to preserve the original text of the *First Volume*. See the Dunhuang catalog for reference, as well as Wang Ming’s *On the Errors in the Abridged Canon of Great Peace*.\n*Excerpt from the Second Scroll of the* **Abridged Canon of Great Peace, Second Volume***.*\n\n**Harmonizing Yin and Yang in Accordance with the Dao’s Law**\n\nTo restore youth and prevent aging—when the Great Dao returns, all people’s years shall be tested and verified. Close your eyes and look inward: a pure, radiant white appears. If at dawn you lie calmly upon your mat, or dwell within warmth and steam, at this time let neither sinew nor bone stir, nor your mouth speak. Every stretch and bend brings ease; the heart rejoices, suffused with a sense of blended moisture. The nose breathes freely, and sweetness arises in the mouth—these are the signs.\n\nThus, those who follow Heaven and Earth enjoy enduring governance; those who follow the four seasons see their kingship flourish day by day. The Dao employs no arcane phrases—its use lies in the alternation of one yin and one yang. Those who attain its governance prosper; those who lose it fall into chaos. Those who attain its governance become spirit-like.\n\nMoreover, those who clearly lose its governance render the Dao unworkable. Ponder this meaning deeply, and you will merge with the Dao as one.\n\nTo record the body’s alignment is to let the spirit make one self-aware of the method. Heaven employs the Dao to generate humanity, granting each person one body and one law: sevenfold interwoven yin and yang, half yin and half yang, only thus can they complete one another. Therefore, the upper part models itself on yang, the lower on yin; the left follows yang, the right follows yin. Yang delights in life, yin delights in killing. Yang embodies the Dao, yin embodies punishment. Yang is goodness, and the yang spirit aids it; yin is evil, and the yin spirit aids it. Accumulate goodness without cease, and Dao-fortune will arise, bringing daily auspiciousness.\n\nYang resides in the head, yin in the feet. Thus, the ruler values virtue and power while employing punishment below—this is the model to follow. The petty man inverts this, devaluing virtue and power while elevating punishment—yet he too follows this model. Therefore, humanity is the root and handle of the Dao, the leader of the spirits. One must understand this intent and skillfully nurture oneself to attain longevity. Those who fail to nurture their bodies incur the blame of the spirits; the spirits abandon them, and how can their bodies fare well?\n\nIn doing good, do not dare stray from the guiding cord, nor deceive yourself. In doing good, the spirits know it of themselves; in doing evil, the spirits know it of themselves. These are not other spirits—they are the spirits within your own body. Speech issues from the heart and belly, yet others come to know of it—this is the spirit within the body informing them.\n\nThus, calming the spirit and settling the body is the foundation of governance and the sign of longevity. The affairs of non-action arise from this. First cultivate the self to discern fortune and misfortune. Therefore, the wise and sagely understand: they cultivate the self, not others. They deeply ponder the Dao’s intent and thus achieve Great Peace. The noble person attains it and flourishes; the petty person practices it and collapses. Cultivate the One to repel the perverse.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth first opened, the root was prized—it is the origin of qi. To bring about Great Peace, contemplate the root. Failing to reflect on the root is called great confusion; undertakings will fail, and disasters will converge. This is not humanity’s fault but the loss of the root. Abandoning the root to seek the branches brings incurable misfortune—thus, one must ponder deeply.\n\nThe One is the root of the Dao, the beginning of qi, the point to which life attaches, and the master of the multitude of hearts. To know its reality, recognize that it resides at the center as the root—the dwelling place of life. Therefore, one must deeply understand it and return to benevolence and worthiness to put it into practice.\n\nThe human root lies within; branches and leaves are without. Command the One to return all outward things; urgently govern the inner and pursue the distant by tending to the near. Those who guard the One receive the aid of celestial spirits; those who guard two receive the aid of earthly spirits; those who guard three receive the aid of human ghosts; those who guard four or five receive the protection of things. Thus, guarding the One extends life; guarding two sets a date with misfortune; guarding three brings chaotic governance; guarding four or five invites daily calamity. Deeply ponder this meaning—it is called knowing the Dao.\n\nTherefore, the One of the head is the crown; the One of the seven regulators is the eye; the One of the abdomen is the navel; the One of the vessels is qi; the One of the five viscera is the heart; the One of the four limbs is the palms and soles; the One of the bones is the spine; the One of the flesh is the intestines and stomach. Those who firmly guard it and understand the Dao’s intent—those who attain the Dao make people benevolent; those who lose it make people greedy.\n\nGovern the body with joy, guard the form and follow the thoughts, focus the mind to repel disaster. What is joy in the Dao? Joy harmonizes yin and yang. In all matters, act in silence, enabling people to grasp the Dao’s root. Thus, when primordial qi delights, great prosperity arises; when nature delights, things grow strong; when Heaven delights, the Three Luminaries shine; when Earth delights, it achieves constancy; when the Five Phases delight, they do not harm one another; when the four seasons delight, what they generate flourishes; when the ruler delights, the world knows no illness; when crawling creatures delight, they do not harm one another; when the myriad things delight, they abide in their constancy; when people delight, they do not fret or change their hearts; when ghosts and spirits delight, they benefit the emperor and king.\n\nThus, joy is the essence of Heaven and Earth’s good qi, which summons the numinous. Stillness generates luminosity, and luminosity is how one awaits the spirits. Those who can communicate with the numinous have the Dao as their neighbor and attain long life and enduring existence.\n\nSeeking the Dao is often bitter, for one cannot return to the heart’s intent. Now, by shifting customs and altering trends, directing the heart’s aim—who would dare contend with this? Does not the music of Great Peace emerge from the palace? It firmly purifies the state, secures the body, and enters the Dao. The barbarians retreat, numinous omens appear, celestial portents return, and malevolent spirits depart.\n\nThe human spirit is born within but roams without. If it wanders untimely, it harms the body. If one can recall it and return, self-governance will not fail. How to recall it? Ensure the inner chamber is empty, with no one nearby. Paint an image matching the color of the viscera, corresponding to the qi of the four seasons. Hang it in the window’s light and contemplate it. Above is the image of the viscera; below are the ten directions. When lying down, focus on the nearby hanging image and contemplate without cease. The spirits of the five viscera can report the qi of the twenty-four seasonal nodes; the spirits of the Five Phases will come to the rescue, and all illnesses will be cured.\n\nMen contemplate male images, women contemplate female images, each using a one-chi measure as the standard, shifting with the four seasons. In spring, ten azure lads; in summer, ten crimson lads; in autumn, ten white lads; in winter, ten black lads; and in the four seasons’ transitions, twelve yellow lads. These twenty-five spirit-persons, true persons together, constitute the method of upright Dao and virtue. Yang transforms into yin, yin transforms into yang; when yin and yang unite, the Dao may be practiced.\n\nHeaven requires earth to bring forth life; earth requires heaven to achieve completion. Spring and summer require autumn and winter; day requires night. A ruler requires ministers to establish governance; ministers require a ruler to carry out their duties. Thus, jia requires yi, zi requires chou—all mutually complete the Dao’s governance. To act rightly is to follow heaven’s course, not to conform to human desires, for all such conformity is contrary to the heavenly Dao. Like the Eastern Sea, though lowly, it delights in water, and all rivers flow into it, thereby attaining its Dao. The leviathan emerges from its depths, and the luminous moon-pearl is born there—such is the efficacy of attaining the Dao. When Daoists gather, they must obtain methods for extending years and extraordinary auspicious responses. When the worthy gather, governance is peaceful; when scholars gather, minor disorders are settled; when the five weapons gather, great defeat ensues.\n\nA ruler should uphold the Dao; ministers should uphold virtue. Dao and virtue are like the outer and inner layers of a garment. If heaven were not vast, it could not encompass the myriad things. All things are half good and half evil—all must be endured. The ruler emulates this, as does the empress and the inner palace. These two exemplify the way of compassionate parents. Thus, when parents raise children, they love the good and pity the wicked, thereby harmonizing the household’s Dao.\n\nThe sun resembles the ruler; the moon resembles the great ministers; the stars resemble the hundred officials. When the worthy collectively shine, the myriad things harmoniously arise. Thus, the pure ascend to heaven, the turbid descend to earth, and harmony resides in humanity. This is the method of harmonizing the numinous spirits.\n\nI desire that the myriad spirits of heaven and earth be harmonious and kind, no longer wantonly harming people, that heaven and earth remain joyful, all spirits rejoice, and people suffer no afflictions. When the emperor obtains heaven’s power, his undertakings are blessed—how could this be interrupted? Thus, the sage who upholds the Dao, in times of clarity and stillness, partakes of morning food, and all spirits call out to speak with him, as if one now calls a guest. The hundred spirits declare themselves heaven’s officials, heaven’s envoys; the host of essences are earth’s officials, earth’s envoys; the hundred ghosts are envoys of harmony. These three are the envoys of yin, yang, and harmony, aiding heaven and earth in governance and together promoting the emperor’s benefit.\n\nThe method of guarding the One and illuminating it is the root of longevity. The myriad spirits may be mastered, emerging from the gate of radiant light. When the One’s essence is illuminated, like fire at its birth, guard it swiftly and do not lose it. It begins as true red, ends as true white, and over time becomes true azure. Profound clarity extends ever farther, then returns to govern the One, so that within there is no obscurity. All illnesses depart; guarding it without slack is the art of ten thousand years.\n\nThe method of guarding the One and illuminating it: illumination has the light of the rising sun and the brightness of midday—this is the foremost good, attaining heaven’s longevity. Dwelling in tranquility, one may preserve it for ten thousand generations without loss.\n\nThe method of guarding the One varies in excellence. What is the Dao? It is the origin of the myriad things, that which cannot be named. Within the six directions, nothing can transform without the Dao. Primordial qi practices the Dao to generate the myriad things. Great and small, heaven and earth—none are born without the Dao. Thus, primordial qi is formless, governing the formed; it unfolds primordial qi and is born not apart from the Dao.\n\nThe natural is the natural of the myriad things. Without practicing the Dao, one cannot envelop heaven and earth, each attaining its place, enabling the high to remain unaware of danger. Heaven practices the Dao, unceasing day and night, swifter than wind and rain, yet still fears losing the Dao’s intent—how much more so for kings? The Three Luminaries practice the Dao without rest, thus appearing in the heavens and illuminating the eight directions. If they lose the Dao, their light vanishes.\n\nWhen the king, the hundred officials, the myriad things, and all living beings reside together, the five stars observe their transgressions. If the king restores virtue, the Virtue Star comes to guard him. If he practices martiality, the Martial Star comes to guard him. If he practices gentleness, the Gentle Star comes to guard him. If he practices strength, the Strong Star comes to guard him. If he practices trustworthiness, the Trust Star comes to guard him. Though distant, their response is near. Heaven and humanity are one—how can one not be cautious?\n\nIn spring, the king should be warm; in summer, hot; in autumn, cool; in winter, cold—this is the king’s virtue. The king’s qi communicates with the emperor’s qi; the minister’s qi corresponds to the chief ministers; the subtle qi corresponds to petty officials; the auspicious qi aligns with the inner palace; the declining qi corresponds to the people; the qi of execution and death corresponds to prisoners—each category remotely stirs the other through the Dao. If the king’s qi does not arrive, the king’s grace cannot be bestowed.\n\nThe ancient sage-kings reflected on the Dao through this, thus discerning the signs of success and failure and examining their meaning. When the king practices the Dao, heaven and earth rejoice; when he loses the Dao, heaven and earth produce calamities and anomalies.\n\nWhen the king calmly contemplates virtue and practices the Dao to secure his person, seeking longevity and self-nourishment, harmonizing the way of husband and wife, so that yin and yang each attain their place, heaven and earth are at peace. Though heaven and the emperor are separated by ten thousand myriad li, they respond to the Dao—is this not wondrous? This is called *The Divine Formula Book*.\n\nPrimordial qi is natural, together constituting the nature of heaven and earth. When the six directions and eight quarters rejoice, good responses arise; when they do not rejoice, evil responses arise. Their forms resemble reflections, their sounds harmonize with echoes.\n\nThe Three Qi—Great Yin, Great Yang, and Harmony—together govern, mutually stirring one another. Humanity is the pivot—thus one must deeply understand this. When all value their lives and nurture their bodies, they know to honor their superiors and love their subordinates, delighting in life and hating death. When the Three Qi rejoice, together they form Great Harmony, and responses emerge in unison.\n\nBut when the multitude of worthies is gathered, and they aspire only to the Dao of longevity, they bring tranquility to their superiors and become the treasures of the state. To nurture one’s nature is to nurture one’s people.\n\nHeaven shows no partial favor, yet its blessings are steadfast. The divine shows no partial kinship, yet the virtuous manifest its efficacy. Within a single body, one may become worthy, divine, or base—why is this? It is due to error, for the numinous is revealed. Thus, the Dao of guarding the One is to nurture one’s nature, and this lies in learning.\n\nAmong the multitude, those who encounter many auspicious responses are trustworthy; those who encounter none have erred in conduct. Through divination, right and wrong become known. What the scales discern is human sentiment. Heaven’s illumination of humanity is no different from a mirror. Examine this meaning carefully, align with Heaven’s will, and find repose with the true spirits—how could this not be auspicious?\n\nIn accomplishing affairs, not a fraction is lost, for one seeks the harmonious intent of Heaven and Earth. When Heaven and Earth are in balance, the myriad things are at peace; when the sovereign is just, the myriad people are well-governed.\n\nIf one acts purely in Yang, the Earth will not fully yield its bounty; if purely in Yin, Heaven will not fully bring forth life. Only by uniting the Three Powers—Yin and Yang in mutual accord—does harmony reside within.\n\nThe sages of antiquity brought about Great Peace by seeking the harmonious heart of Heaven and Earth. If a single qi is obstructed, a hundred affairs go awry. When the Three Qi harmonize, the laws of emperors and kings flourish. By penetrating the harmonious discourse of Heaven and Earth, one follows the Great Enterprise, roams with the Three Qi, and enables the ruler to be without cares. Worthies emerge in full, assisting and elevating the emperor, bringing great joy to Heaven.\n\nSimply by fully aligning with Heaven and Earth, not losing even a fraction, one swiftly attains Great Peace, and auspicious responses arise in unison.\n\nPrimordial qi has three names: Great Yang, Great Yin, and Harmony. Forms have three names: Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. Heaven has three names: sun, moon, and stars, with the North Star as its center. Earth has three names: mountains, rivers, and level land. Humanity has three names: father, mother, and child. Governance has three names: ruler, minister, and people—all desiring Great Peace.\n\nThese three must always be held close as heart and mind, not losing even a fraction, so that they share a single concern and unite as one household. Then Great Peace is swiftly attained, and longevity is assured without doubt.\n\nThus, the male resembles Heaven, and his thoughts dwell on the female—this is the clear manifestation of Heaven’s design for humanity. The minister serves as Earth’s conduit; Earth constantly aspires to ascend and align its heart with Heaven. Thus, the myriad things born of Earth ever rise upward without cease, and clouds and mist coalesce into rain.\n\nTherefore, the loyal minister’s concern is ever upward, tirelessly mindful of his lord—this is the clear manifestation of Earth’s design. The people embody the discourse of Harmony, for Harmony is what regulates the myriad things. Harmony is the infant, born of father and mother; its life belongs to the father, its lineage to the superior, yet it is entrusted to the mother. Thus, in distress, it yearns for its lord and father. These three reflect the images of husband and wife, father and child.\n\nThey ought to communicate freely, unite their strength in shared concern, so that the Three Qi merge into Great Harmony. From Great Harmony arises the qi of Great Peace. If these Three Qi are severed, and even one fails to reach, Great Harmony does not arrive, and Great Peace does not emerge.\n\nYin and Yang depend on Harmony. When the qi of Harmony is attained, the myriad things flourish, the people are harmonious, and the king’s governance brings Great Peace.\n\nThe ruler is Heaven; if his grace does not descend, things have no means to be born, and people cannot attain longevity. If the ruler’s heart is not open, Heaven’s heart cannot reach below. If wife and child do not receive the lord and father’s decree, the household becomes rebellious. If the minister’s qi cannot ascend, Earth’s qi cannot be fulfilled—how then can loyal ministers assist the enlightened king in governance? To wound Earth’s heart is to leave widows in the chamber, ever grieving in sorrow, so that no good minister may advance.\n\nIf the people’s qi does not ascend, how can the qi of Harmony arise? Harmony is meant to harmonize with the emperor and king, to regulate the myriad things, each attaining its proper governance. Now, if the Three Qi do not communicate well, how can Great Peace be achieved? The method of the peaceful and joyous ruler lies in this.\n\nThe ruler must transform the myriad things with virtue and power, enabling each to find its place. One who cannot transform the myriad things cannot be called a ruler. It is like a husband and wife who together bear a child—they are called parents, an image of a household. Without the ability to bear a child, how can they be called parents? Thus, one who cannot transform and give life to the myriad things cannot be called the parents of the people.\n\nFire can transform the Four Elements and itself becomes the fifth, thus earning the image of a ruler. Wood’s nature is harmonious and focused, yet with fire it scatters into ash. Metal’s nature is hard and unyielding, yet with fire it softens. Earth’s nature is greatly yielding, yet with fire it hardens into tile. Water’s nature is cold, yet with fire it warms. Fire itself aligns with the Five Phases, yet its transformations are boundless; its nature is active and ascendant.\n\nYin submits to Yang, ministers submit to rulers, and fire’s illumination is clear and penetrating, discerning right from wrong—thus it earns the name of ruler, while the others cannot. Earth does not transform immediately but does so over time—thus it is called the Queen Earth. The other three serve as assistants, images of ministers.\n\nThe Dao can transform all things, thus Primordial Qi guards the Dao, circulates its qi, and gives birth to Heaven and Earth. They stand without pillars, and the myriad things are born without fixed categories, extending to later generations in transmission, speaking of their kinds.\n\nIt is like grasses and trees growing on Earth—do they have fixed categories? It is Primordial Qi guarding the Dao that brings forth such things. Naturally guarding the Dao and acting, the myriad things each find their place.\n\nHeaven guards the Dao and acts, thus it is called divine and boundless, an image of the ruler and father, able to regulate and transform all things, truly embodying the Dao’s intent. Earth guards the Dao and acts, uniting the five directions with the center, to which the myriad things return.\n\nThe Three Luminaries guard the Dao and act, thus nothing escapes their illumination. Thunder and lightning guard the Dao and act, therefore they can stir all under Heaven, riding qi to come and go. The four seasons and five phases guard the Dao and act, thus they transform the myriad things, giving them constancy. Yin and yang, female and male guard the Dao and act, thus they transmit through generations. In all matters, great or small, if they guard the Dao and act, there is no misfortune. If the Dao is lost today, great chaos ensues.\n\nThus when yang is at peace, the myriad things generate themselves; when yin is at peace, the myriad things complete themselves. When yin and yang govern the Dao, instruction extends to ministers, transformation flows to the people, receiving mandate from Heaven, receiving form from Earth, receiving teaching from masters—only then does one hear the essential Dao of all under Heaven.\n\nThose who guard the root become kings; those who guard the stem become ministers; those who guard the floating blossoms are good, yet disordered and without constancy. The emperor is the child of Heaven; the empress is the child of Earth. These are the first numinous qi of Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth always desire joy, not sorrow or suffering, cherishing them so—this is the heart-mind of Heaven and Earth, their intent and qi foremost.\n\nThus when the ruler suffers sorrow, the qi of the four seasons and five phases fall into discord, and the taking of life becomes irregular. The method of suspending images to return the spirit.\n\nThe spirit is born within: in spring, ten Green Lads; in summer, ten Red Lads; in autumn, ten White Lads; in winter, ten Black Lads; and in the four seasons, twelve Yellow Lads—this is the way men store the spirit. The spirit of women follows the same number. Men contemplate men, women contemplate women, all using a one-chi measure as the standard, drawing them well to make them beloved. If one cannot maintain joy and restraint, the hun and spirit swiftly return.\n\nThe formula for resolving inherited burdens.\n\nSince the opening of Heaven and Earth, baleful qi has never ceased—once cut off, it later arises again. Why is this? Lifespan is Heaven’s most precious treasure. It is bestowed through private virtue and cannot be falsely attained. To know this treasure: when the six directions of Heaven and Earth, the eight distant realms, and the myriad things all remain free of grievance and entanglement, all rejoice greatly—only then is longevity increased. If even one matter brings displeasure, it immediately harms and brings death.\n\nIn human conduct, some strive to do good yet often meet with misfortune; others strive to do evil yet often meet with fortune. Those who claim themselves worthy are mistaken. Those who strive to do good yet meet misfortune bear the inherited burdens of their ancestors’ transgressions, as disasters flow forward and backward, accumulating to harm them. Those who do evil yet meet with fortune inherit the deep accumulations of their ancestors’ great merits, which flow to benefit them. If one performs great merits ten thousand times over, even if their ancestors left lingering misfortunes, these cannot reach them. Instead, the merits pass onward, flowing to their descendants as inherited blessings.\n\nFive generations form a small cycle, and after ten generations, the effects return to their origin. Some perform minor good deeds yet cannot escape imprisonment; their ancestors’ flowing evils and inherited burdens strike them, cutting off their line and leaving no descendants—truly a grievous wrong.\n\nInherited burdens are divided into three celestial ranks: the Emperor’s burdens flow for thirty thousand years, ministers’ for three thousand years, and the common people’s for three hundred years. All bear and pass on these burdens in succession, rising and falling with the decline and flourishing of governance, never ceasing. If one now follows this principle, modeling governance on the Heavenly August Emperor to sever these burdens, they must ponder deeply and never forget.\n\nHumans possess three lifespans, corresponding to three qi: the life of Great Yang, Great Yin, and the Harmonious Center. The upper lifespan is one hundred twenty years, the middle eighty, and the lower sixty. One hundred twenty corresponds to Heaven’s great reckoning, completing the boundary of Heaven and Earth in a single year. Eighty corresponds to the division of Yin and Yang, the eight pairs that align with Earth, distinguishing the myriad things—those that die depart, while those that live remain. Sixty corresponds to the qi of the Harmonious Center, attaining the hexagram *Dun* in the sixth month. *Dun* means escape and disappearance, thus governing the meeting of life and death.\n\nIf one ceaselessly practices good, surpassing these lifespans, it is called transcending the world. If one ceaselessly practices evil, falling short of these three lifespans, it is called premature death. Those who die in the womb or before maturity bear the innocent inherited burdens of their ancestors’ transgressions.\n\nThose with frequent head ailments suffer from Heaven’s displeasure. Those with frequent foot ailments suffer from Earth’s displeasure. Those with frequent internal organ illnesses suffer from the warring qi of the five phases. Those with frequent limb ailments suffer from the disharmony of the four seasons’ qi. Those with frequent deafness and blindness suffer from the three luminaries losing their proper measure. Those with frequent chills and fevers suffer from the contention of Yin and Yang qi. Those with frequent confusion and disorder suffer from the myriad things losing their place. Those with frequent afflictions by ghosts and spirits suffer from the anger of Heaven and Earth’s deities. Those who often die of warmth-related illnesses are slain by Great Yang qi. Those who often die of cold are harmed by Great Yin qi. Those who often die suddenly are struck by excessively harsh punitive qi. Those who often suffer from bloating or shortness of breath suffer from the discord of the eight solar terms.\n\nNow, Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang have entirely lost their proper places, thus harming the myriad things. If the Emperor’s governance is disharmonious, floods and droughts occur without pattern, bandits arise frequently, and punishments are made harsher—yet this only increases chaos, entangling and unresolved. The people all cry out to Heaven, while the court’s governance is disordered, losing its rhythm and constancy. The myriad things are harmed, moving even the Azure Heaven above. The three luminaries rage and change erratically, the constellations move in disorder—thus, only the utmost Dao can save them. I know Heaven’s intent does not deceive you.\n\nHeaven’s might, once unleashed, cannot be restrained. To incur guilt before Heaven is to invite premature death.\n\nFrom the opening of Heaven and Earth since the Great Beginning, sages each comprehended one aspect with perfect clarity, knowing it truly without doubt. Thus, each established one great enterprise, enabling later generations to cultivate it without error. Therefore, sages each excelled in one great enterprise yet could not fully know the Dao of Heaven—hence, their virtues differed. This is like Heaven and Earth: how much more so for humans? Heaven and Earth each excel in one aspect: Heaven excels in height and clarity, Earth in depth and turbidity, while the Harmonious Center nurtures the myriad things. Even they cannot encompass all—how much less can ordinary people?\n\n*Hai* is the northwest extreme of Heaven and Earth; *Si* is the southeast extreme. If *Hai*’s cold does not close in due time, the following year’s *Si* will be harmed in return. *Zi* is the north extreme of Heaven and Earth; *Wu* is the south extreme. If this winter’s *Zi* does not properly store and conceal, *Wu* will bear the inherited burden and perish in return. *Chou* is the northeast extreme of Heaven and Earth; *Wei* is the southwest extreme. If *Chou* does not timely bring forth life, the sixth month will suffer its punishment in return. The nature and movement of Heaven and Earth are all thus.\n\nNow, if the Emperor dwells within the hundredfold layers, governing with virtue and benevolence, his grace extends ten thousand *li*, and the people receive his favor. Fathers are kind, children filial; households are sufficient, and people do not turn to wickedness. If the Emperor within loses his virtue, beyond ten thousand *li*, officials and people lose their proper roles—though they are separated by countless *li*, the cause is one.\n\nPracticing good words is not as effective as practicing good conduct in oneself.\n\nThe Perfected One asked the Divine Person: “In my life, what can I do to always be joyful?”\n\nThe Divine Person replied: “Do you recall the ancient, vast Perfected One? The reason he aged after others was that he abandoned the depraved and solely cherished the true Dao. The true Dao is constantly preserved, while the depraved vanish. While all people suffer hardship, I alone endure—this is constant joy. Shining brightly and rejoicing alone, what resentment could there be? Even if one ultimately cannot attain long life, what can be done?”\n\nThe Divine Person said: “Accumulated practice nears completion; thoughts of goodness nears life. The Dao is the scripture of the boundless. In ancient times, the Divine Persons governed, taking Perfected Ones as ministers to rule the people—thus the people knew not that above them there was an emperor, and through the Dao’s natural non-action, they governed themselves. Next, the Perfected Ones governed, taking Immortals as ministers; though they did not see the people, the people occasionally knew there was an emperor, hearing his teachings and revering their lord. Next, the Immortals governed, taking Daoists as ministers; their rule bore slight traces of punishment and law, and the people’s hearts stirred with fear, giving rise to cunning and deceit. Next came hegemonic rule, where ministers were not carefully chosen, the people suffered many grievances, and chaos arose. As governance receded, disorder drew near, and control could no longer be restored.\n\nThus, to think of the divine is to summon the divine; to think of the Perfected is to summon the Perfected; to think of the Immortal is to summon the Immortal; to think of the Dao is to summon the Dao; to think of wisdom is to summon wisdom. When the sage’s concentrated thoughts turn to the worthy, the spirit of the worthy comes to aid him; when thoughts turn to depravity, the ghosts of fools come to delude him. Whatever a person may contemplate can be summoned—only the excellence or inferiority of what is thought differs.\n\nTherefore, when a superior scholar becomes ruler, he thinks of the divine and Perfected; when a middling scholar becomes ruler, his mind is penetrating and full of wisdom; when an inferior scholar becomes ruler, he cannot think deeply and merely follows fate as it unfolds.\n\nThe Perfected One asked: “How can one know whether an emperor’s thoughts are good or evil?”\n\nThe Divine Person replied: “It is easily known. When an emperor thinks of benevolence and goodness, auspicious signs appear solely for him, and prophetic texts arise solely for him. Emperors of benevolence and clarity are born of Wood and Fire; those of martial wisdom are born of Metal and Water; those of gentleness and harmony are born of Earth. Heaven’s descending omens never err.”\n\nThe Perfected One asked: “In ancient times, extraordinary prophetic texts and rare methods—who was worthy to receive them?”\n\n“Officials and commoners who obtained them presented them to their king. When the emperor’s *qi* of the times was harmonious and good, governance grew ever clearer, Daoist arts and worthy sages emerged to assist him, and the emperor’s Way daily grew stronger. The barbarians were pacified and vanished; he governed with folded arms, punishments ceased of themselves, and the people knew no warfare. Is this not proof of an emperor’s good thoughts? Even without seeing the man, one already knows.”\n\nThe Perfected One asked: “How does the Divine Person know this?”\n\nThe Divine Person said: “By attaining it without sound. When the ruler desires benevolence and cherishes life, he models the Way of Heaven; when ministers desire gentleness, compliance, and nurturing, they follow the Way of Earth—then good omens appear. Thus Heaven and Earth do not speak yet endure forever; their governance is uniquely divine. The divine and numinous do not speak yet attain long life as Immortals—all through inner illumination and outer obscurity, which is the origin of the ten thousand Ways.\n\nThe divine and numinous move in and out without lairs or nests; pure and tranquil, without sound, they lie at ease upon their pillows, and their spiritual radiance arises of itself. How could this not be joyous and auspicious? Those who use their mouths excessively deplete their essence; those who exert their strength excessively weary their bodies; those who employ force excessively harm themselves—from these arise misfortune and calamity. Heed my words and do not think recklessly. Good thoughts may bring virtue, but evil thoughts return to harm oneself. Between safety and danger, the difference is as fine as a hair’s breadth—beware of mixed thoughts.\n\nWhen a person loses the Dao, their fate is cut off; when one truly understands the Dao’s intent, life may be preserved. Strive to nurture your essence and do not consume yourself. Study under an enlightened teacher, and misfortune and chaos will not arise.”\n\nThe Perfected One dared not disregard the Divine Person’s words.\n\nThe Divine Person said: “Learners act for themselves, not for others. Thus each should cherish and draw near to themselves. Through long accumulation in studying the Dao, one becomes a divine Perfected One, utterly distinct from the multitude—such are my words.”\n\nThe Perfected One asked: “How can one know the efficacy of the Dao?”\n\nThe Divine Person said: “Resolve it through an enlightened teacher, practice it in oneself. The body transforms and changes form, entering the same gate as the divine Way, becoming neighbors with the Perfected, sharing a door with the Divine Person. Seek it within yourself—how could misfortune be seen? If one loses the Dao’s intent and instead seeks it in the four wilds, searching in vain, one reaches old age in poverty. Thus severed from the root, one claims the world has no Dao, ever alone in sorrow and suffering—this is the greatest calamity. The great person, losing it, cannot level their governance; the middling scholar, losing it, brings chaos to their lord; the benevolent person, losing it, has no way to act as a worthy; the petty person, losing it, destroys themselves. The conduct of the ancient worthies and sages is the same as today’s; the ruin of the ancient petty people is also the same as today’s—clear evidence indeed.”\n\nThe Perfected One asked: “How can one know whether a person will rise or fall?”\n\nThe Divine Person said: “When a great person is about to rise, extraordinary texts appear, and the worthy assist in governance. When a household is about to rise, those who seek will find life, and the goodness of their descendants can be known.”\n\nThe Perfected One asked: “How can one summon such worthies?”\n\nThe Divine Person said: “All through thought. With unceasing concentrated thought, all things come. How wondrous is the Dao’s governance—can one not strive to practice it?”\n\nThe Divine Person said: “The Three Bonds and Six Disciplines endure in good fortune because they uphold the Dao and do not lose their governance—thus they are always auspicious. Heaven’s lifespan does not override human wishes. The nature of Wood is benevolence; thinking of benevolence thus summons the East, for the East governs benevolence. The five directions are all like this. All matters under Heaven follow their kind—thus when an emperor thinks of tranquility, his governance is also tranquil, for like calls to like.\n\nThe ancients who studied emulated it in themselves; today’s scholars emulate it in others. The ancients studied to secure themselves; today’s scholars pursue superficial ornamentation, not accumulating essence in themselves but accumulating essence in texts—this is to be ignorant of the root.”\n\n*Excerpts from the Tai Ping Jing, Concluding Section of Scroll Two of the Yi Division*\n*Beginning of Scroll Three of the Bing Division of the Tai Ping Jing*\n\nDistinguishing between poverty and wealth, when the ruler enacts this, it establishes good fortune—prohibiting the severance of the earth’s lineage to promote the flourishing of men and women, thereby restoring the king’s governance. What is called wealth in the world? What is called poverty? Indeed, those who possess much are wealthy, and those who possess little are poor. Yet your words, while correct, are also fundamentally untrue. Can the deceitful, the false, the thieves, and the bandits truly be called wealthy? Today, the common people are many, and the emperors few—how can this be called poverty?\n\nWealth, in its meaning, is complete sufficiency. Heaven deems all things fully born as wealth and sufficiency. Thus, in the era of the Upper August, qi emerged, and the twelve thousand things were born in diversity—this was called wealth and sufficiency. In the era of the Middle August, things diminished and could not fully sustain the twelve thousand things, thus it was called minor poverty. In the era of the Lower August, things were even fewer than in the Middle August—this was called great poverty. Without auspicious responses, when good things do not arise, it is extreme poverty. When all things emerge and the earth nourishes them without harm, this is the earth’s wealth; when it cannot nourish things, it is great poverty.\n\nHeaven is the father, earth the mother—when these parents reach extreme poverty, their children grow poorer by the day. In ancient times, the emperor who governed the world with the Dao could bring forth the twelve thousand things—this was the ruler of supreme wealth. When good things fell short by two-thirds, it was the ruler of middle wealth; by one-third, the ruler of lesser wealth. When rare things did not arise, it was the ruler of extreme poverty.\n\nThe ancient emperors of the Dao dwelled in seclusion, contemplating virtue and power, and the myriad things were naturally sufficient—was this not joyous? When the emperor practices the Dao, the celestial spirits aid his transformation; when he practices virtue, the earthly spirits aid his governance; when he practices harmony, the human spirits aid his rule; but when he practices ornamentation, it becomes the path of hidden deceit. Thus, deceitful spirits assist him, and his governance runs counter to the will of Heaven, harming the good.\n\nRuling the world with military force, subduing people through punishment and execution, is like thieves and bandits inflicting harm through execution. The original intent of the emperor’s laws is retribution by kind. Heaven delights in giving life, thus it is called the Lord and Father. Earth delights in tranquility and nourishing the myriad things, thus it is called the Mother. Using the heart to cherish and love all things—this is called benevolence. These two are good, thus they are called teachers and elders.\n\nGreatly aligning with Heaven and Earth, harmonizing yin and yang, with no grievances between men and women, brings timely rain, harmonizes the two qi, and the earth gives birth to the myriad things. When the emperor’s Dao governs, it swiftly brings Great Peace.\n\nIf chaste men do not bestow and chaste women do not transform, yin and yang do not unite, and the lineage of the world is extinguished—when two people together sever the lineage of Heaven and Earth, coveting hollow and false reputations, they leave no descendants, losing the true essence. This is the world’s greatest harm. If Heaven were to remain chaste, timely rain would not fall; if Earth were to remain chaste, the myriad things would not be born. Not bestowing, not giving birth—this harm is great indeed.\n\nWhen Heaven is about to send rain, it first stirs wind and clouds so that people may know. The reason for this is to prompt them to gather and store. Now, as the qi of Great Peace is about to arrive, fearing that people will not cease their evil, it first awakens them. The emperor should model himself on Heaven and Earth, first observing the virtuous Dao in royal affairs.\n\n**The Method for Resolving Karmic Debt:**\nSince the opening of Heaven and Earth, emperors, ministers, and the people have borne karmic debt, and this is why teachings have emerged. From emperors and ministers to the common people, all who bear karmic debt pass it to later generations—this is due to their inability to nurture goodness, losing their guiding principles, thus incurring karmic responsibility.\n\nFor example, if parents lose virtue and commit wrongs in their village, their descendants will surely be harmed by the village—this is the proof of karmic debt. In ancient times, emperors, ministers, and the people each knew the way to nurture themselves—how could there have been karmic debt?\n\nHeaven does not deceive people: sow millet, and you reap millet; sow wheat, and you reap wheat. It depends on the effort expended, whether the harvest is good or bad. Resolving the enmity of karmic debt for the August Heaven, resolving the calamity of karmic debt for the Earth, resolving the distress of karmic debt for the emperor, resolving the transgressions of karmic debt for the myriad people, resolving the responsibility of karmic debt for the twelve thousand things—there is nothing better for resolving karmic debt than abiding by the One. If one abides by the One for long, Heaven will take pity.\n\nThe One is the guiding principle of Heaven and the root of the myriad things. Contemplate its root, and it will extend to its branches. When the sages of old were about to act, they observed the celestial patterns above and examined the earthly principles below, clarifying root and branch, witnessing their evident effects.\n\nThe people of the world have four hardships—what are they? A child, born of parents, in youth cannot leave their thoughts of their parents—this is the first hardship. When grown and self-reliant, a woman desires marriage, a man desires a wife, yet they cannot overcome their passions, and their love prevents separation—this is the second hardship. Once in love, they bear children; as husband and wife age, their appearance is no longer lovely, but their young children are lovable and must be raised—this is the third hardship. When the children grow, they no longer need to be raised, but the parents themselves age and do not understand how to conduct themselves—this is the fourth hardship.\n\nAfter these four hardships, if one can find a wise teacher and contemplate guarding the Dao, it may yet be well. Those of high talent with heavenly mandate may transcend the world; the next may attain longevity; the next may briefly enjoy their bodies. When the hun and po reside beneath the earth, they may yet find joy. Why is this? Beneath the earth, all newly deceased arrive and are questioned about their deeds in life, their records clearly established, and they are held accountable for their actions. Thus, one must prepare in advance for safety and peril.\n\nThe ruler should contemplate Great Peace, aligning with the heart of Heaven, so that hun, po, and spirit constantly unite with qi. Those who cannot bring peace to their governance do not align with the heart of Heaven, do not gain Heaven’s favor, and are deemed to have no merit before Heaven. In the end, their hun, po, and spirit will be held solely accountable beneath the earth, uniting with evil qi.\n\nThe ancient supreme sage-rulers understood this well, thus they exerted themselves to do good.\n\nThe foolish do not ponder deeply, thus in life they incur Heaven’s reproach, and in death they incur Earth’s reproach—how can this not be terrifying? Swiftly transmit my writings so that all under Heaven may practice them, each reflecting on their own essence, their thoughts aligning with the Great Dao. Once they recognize the origin of their transgressions, the burden of inherited responsibility shall be lifted. Heaven and Earth will rejoice greatly, reverting to the ancient age and doubling its blessings.\n\nHeaven is One, yet it acts through Earth as Two—what is the meaning of this? Now Earth is Two, yet it acts through Man as Three—why is this? Earth serves as Heaven’s agent, and Man serves as Earth’s agent. Thus, when Heaven is pleased, it immediately causes all things upon Earth to rejoice. Though Earth nurtures all beings, if goodness prevails, the people dwell in goodness—this is the clear effect of their mutual agency.\n\nThe causes of order and chaos are manifold. Those who do not align with Heaven’s heart must return to their root. When human speech proliferates, it too leads to chaos. But if one returns to the root, what cause for concern is there?\n\nThus, a single word that achieves its purpose is the root. A second word that suffices forms a coherent phrase. A third word that suffices instead becomes an explanation of difficulties, for the farther one strays from truth, the more explanations are needed. A fourth word that suffices instead becomes literary embellishment. A fifth word that suffices instead becomes falsehood. A sixth word that suffices instead leads to failure. A seventh word that suffices instead leads to ruin. An eighth word that suffices instead leads to separation and estrangement, growing ever more distant. A ninth word that suffices instead leads to great chaos. A tenth word that suffices instead leads to destruction and annihilation. Thus, upon reaching ten, one must reform, for further transmission only brings ruin.\n\nIn all matters, when destruction occurs, one must return to the root. Therefore, return and hold fast to the One as the origin. Hence, numbers begin with One and end with Ten—this is the natural principle governing order and chaos.\n\nThus, the sages of antiquity, when consulting the oracle, first divined once: its auspice or inauspice was decisive. By holding to the root, the celestial spirits would descend with their message. A second divination summoned the earthly spirits to speak. A third divination summoned the human spirits to speak. Beyond this, all is deception, unworthy of divination, and the hexagrams lose their accuracy. Human discourse, when excessive, is not to be treasured.\n\nHow excellent! The celestial numbers begin with One and end with Ten—why is this? Heaven is One, and below it, Earth is Two. Yin and Yang unite to give birth to all things. The first signs of life emerge as primordial qi arises in the *zi* hour, turns northeast to spread roots in the *jiao* constellation, then moves east to sprout and grow, shifts southeast to develop branches and leaves, turns south to flourish, moves west to ripen, and turns northwest to reach completion. When things come to an end, they must begin anew, thus the *hai* hour: two embracing one, the beginning of the Three Sovereigns. Therefore, *hai* is the kernel, the first coagulation of the seed—hence water begins to congeal in the tenth month. *Ren* means \"to bear,\" for what is borne must grow day by day. Thus, *zi* means \"to multiply.\" When Three achieves the harmony of Yin and Yang’s qi, all is complete, and it returns to the beginning, hence the name *jiazi*. The Dao of Heaven in generating things must circulate fully, uniting the qi of the four seasons and five phases to bring them to completion. Thus, it is rooted in Heaven and Earth, circulating through the eight directions, and the numbers end at Ten.\n\nQuestion: Of the governance of emperors and feudal lords, which is most excellent?\nAnswer: To extend compassion without harm, acting as Heaven does—this is most excellent. In governance, nothing surpasses emulating the great image of Heaven. Yet there must be an order of priority. What does this mean?\n\nThe highest good is to cherish life, desiring it as urgently as one craves water—only then is it acceptable. Next is to delight in the goodness of others as if it were one’s own. Next is to bestow upon others: when seeing someone in poverty, one should feel their sorrow as keenly as if suffering hunger and cold. Next is to establish laws, ensuring that fear alone deters transgression. Next, for those guilty of grave crimes, governance should prevent them from falling into wrongdoing. Next, when someone commits an offense, if unavoidable, ensure it does not implicate their family or neighbors. Next, if the offense extends to neighbors, one should identify the guilty party while taking care not to sever their lineage. Humans are the stewards of Heaven, Earth, and the divine luminaries. To harm and disrupt the body of Heaven and Earth is to invite profound calamity. Do not bring the burden of inherited responsibility upon descendants. Constantly aspire to Great Peace to dissolve the obstructions of punishment.\n\nI expound for Heaven and Earth, composing this for rulers of supreme virtue, that they may eliminate the burdens of inherited responsibility since the opening of Heaven and Earth. If this discourse is neglected, one will surely incur the resentment of the August Heaven and the Sacred Earth, and bear the burden of responsibility before the enlightened and virtuous rulers of the past—such a transgression would be grave indeed.\n\nI have collated and examined the Daoist scriptures of high, middle, and low antiquity, gathering the wise to read them together and survey the texts of Dao from past and present. If one scripture yields one good precept, record it. If one good technique is found, note it down as the matter arises. One scripture yields one goodness, ten scriptures yield ten goodnesses, a hundred yield a hundred, a thousand yield a thousand, ten thousand yield ten thousand, and a hundred million yield a hundred million goodnesses. Record them accordingly, then assemble the wise to deliberate, removing redundancies. From this, compile the essential texts to fully grasp the profound intent of Heaven, Earth, humanity, and the myriad things in ancient and modern times. Condensing the insights of nine sages—could there be any injustice?\n\nThe king’s governance, rejoicing in this, will resolve the inherited burdens of his predecessors. Humans are the foremost of the myriad things. The formless spirit-people, composed of refined qi, are charged with governing primordial qi. The great spirit-people govern Heaven, the perfected people govern Earth, the immortals govern the four seasons, the great Daoists govern the five phases, the sages govern Yin and Yang, the worthies govern documents and receive teachings, ordinary people govern plants and the five grains, and servants govern wealth and goods.\n\nHeaven appoints offices according to nature, never overriding their inherent inclinations—each follows its kind without error. To act contrary invites great harm. Thus, all the common people under Heaven’s charge must comply with this principle. The sages of antiquity deeply understood this, never deviating from Heaven’s intent, thereby gaining Heaven’s favor. The nine ranks each govern with ease, securing Heaven’s favor; when the nine qi harmonize, they bring about Great Peace. These nine matters mutually generate and complete one another—if even one qi fails to harmonize, some will not arrive. If primordial qi is disharmonious, the formless spirit-people will not come. If Heaven’s qi is disharmonious, the great spirit-people will not come. If Earth’s qi is disharmonious, the perfected people will not come. If the four seasons are disharmonious, the immortals will not come. If the five phases are disharmonious, the great Daoists will not come. If Yin and Yang are disharmonious, the sages will not come. If the myriad things are disharmonious, the common people will fall into chaos, goods and wealth will diminish, and servants will flee. When any office fails in its duty, the harm is thus. Obtaining these nine ranks can dispel the inherited burdens of ten thousand generations of kings. These nine ranks ascend to the formless spirit-people and descend to servants—each regulates a single qi.\n\nTherefore, the superior scholar who cultivates the Dao must first consume qi, seeking to harmonize with primordial qi. He should fast in a thatched chamber, avoiding all evil, refining his form daily, and never yielding to desire. Thus, he may move freely between realms, aiding the immortals and perfected in governing Heaven’s primordial qi. Such is the divine scholar, an official of Heaven. Unrestrained and unbound, if he truly attains this, he is called a Heavenly Scholar. Heaven reviews the virtuous, rejoicing greatly, and in turn benefits humanity.\n\nThough one who attains the Dao and departs this world may not serve an immediate purpose, he can harmonize Yin and Yang’s qi to benefit the myriad things. The ancient kings sacrificed to the celestial deities for the sake of these divine officials. All, from sages to servants, have their limits—the highest are the formless spirit-people, the lowest are servants. The spirit-people move by riding qi; thus, where there is qi, there is spirit, and when qi ceases, spirit perishes. This is the luminous decree of August Heaven, by which the governance of human rulers is judged, and the effects of success or failure are made manifest.\n\nThe interplay of punishment and virtue is the manifest efficacy of Heaven and Earth’s governance through Yin and Yang spirits, serving as the model for all things and the people. Thus, in the eleventh month, great virtue resides in the *nine-one* position, dwelling beneath the earth. At this time, virtue abides within the chamber, so the inner realm possesses qi, and the myriad things return to it. The *six-four* position, situated in the four wilds, holds the outward form, so the outer realm lacks qi and dissipates. The outer expanse is empty of all things, and the multitudes of scholars and commoners all return, following the king’s virtue into the depths of the Yellow Springs.\n\nIn the twelfth month, virtue resides in the *nine-two* position, in the *chou* hour, dwelling within the earth’s center yet to emerge. At this time, virtue abides in the Bright Hall, and the myriad things follow virtue upward but dare not appear, for punishment looms above. In the first month, the *yin* hour, virtue resides in the *nine-three* position, and all things without exception follow its flourishing power, rejoicing in their emergence upon the earth. At this time, virtue dwells in the courtyard.\n\nIn the second month, virtue resides in the *nine-four* position, in the *mao* and *si* hours, neither fully departed from the earth nor yet reaching Heaven, but precisely at the boundary. Virtue abides at the gate, so all things delight in peering outward from the gate. In the third month, flourishing virtue resides in the *nine-five* position atop the *chen* hour, reaching the center of Heaven. At this time, virtue abides in the outer pathways, so all things emerge and dwell outside.\n\nIn the fourth month, the *si* hour, virtue resides in the *nine-six* position, extending to the six distant boundaries and eight frontiers. Flourishing virtue pervades the eight directions, and the auspicious qi of Yang responds in kind. The teeming living things depart from the four chambers and the wilds. At this time, punishment resides at the roots of the myriad things, dwelling within the inner chamber. The lower chamber is empty, while the upper flourishes, and none fail to delight in following virtue to govern. This is the great manifest efficacy of governance through virtue.\n\nNow, I have heard of employing virtue but have not heard of employing punishment. Yet, in the fifth month, punishment resides in the *six-one* position, in the *wu* hour beneath the earth. The inner realm lacks qi, and the earth below is empty. At this time, punishment abides in the void, and the inner realm is empty of all things, which all dwell outside.\n\nIn the sixth month, punishment resides in the *six-two* position, in the *wei* hour, dwelling within the earth’s center yet to emerge. At this time, punishment abides in the Bright Hall, its qi within, while virtue’s qi is without. The teeming living things all delight in exposing themselves and returning to flourishing virtue. In the seventh month, punishment resides in the *six-three* position, in the *shen* hour, abiding in the courtyard. The myriad things dare not enter and firmly delight in dwelling outside.\n\nIn the eighth month, punishment resides in the *six-four* position, in the *you* hour, not yet reaching the Heavenly boundary. At this time, virtue abides at the gate, and all things delight in peering from the gate, rejoicing in entering and following virtue to return. In the ninth month, punishment resides in the *six-five* position, atop the *xu* hour, reaching the center. At this time, punishment abides in the pathways, and none of the myriad things fail to perish by dawn, following virtue to conceal themselves. Thus, the inner realm flourishes daily, while the outer is empty and desolate.\n\nIn the tenth month, punishment resides in the *six-six* position, in the *hai* hour, extending to the six distant boundaries, eight frontiers, and four wilds. The teeming living things all conceal themselves and flee, following virtue’s movement into the Bright Hall. Crawling creatures carry their young within, while the wilds outside are empty of scholars and multitudes. This is not because punishment is favored, but rather that those who employ it are seen as perverse. Yet if the heart inwardly harbors punishment to govern the multitudes, their numbers dwindle daily.\n\nIn the fifth month, harboring one measure of punishment within causes one group of the multitudes to rebel. In the sixth month, harboring two measures of punishment causes two groups to rebel. In the seventh month, harboring three measures causes three groups to rebel. In the eighth month, harboring four measures causes four groups to rebel. In the ninth month, harboring five measures causes five groups to rebel. In the tenth month, harboring six measures causes the multitudes of the six directions to rebel. Thus, the outer realm is utterly empty of all things, all fleeing inward—this is the manifest proof.\n\nTherefore, governance through punishment appears reverent outwardly but harbors rebellion within, so the multitudes diminish daily. Conversely, in the eleventh month, harboring one measure of virtue within draws one group of the multitudes inward. In the twelfth month, harboring two measures draws two groups inward. In the first month, harboring three measures draws three groups inward. In the second month, harboring four measures draws four groups inward. In the third month, harboring five measures of flourishing Yang virtue draws five groups of worthy ones inward. From the fourth month onward, the six virtues cause all things to emerge and appear, and none fail to teem and return, both within and without. This is the manifest model of Heaven’s Bright Hall.\n\nIn the second and eighth months, virtue and punishment are evenly matched, so the myriad things are half-damaged by cold. Punishment daily harms and kills, inspiring dread and fear, and thus fails to win the people’s strength. The sages of antiquity ruled through virtue and the Dao, not through physical force or punishment. They established models and laws, setting forth teachings and decrees for emperors and kings to follow in governance.\n\nWhen the kingly Way is about to flourish, it takes its model from virtue; when it is about to decline, it takes its model from punishment. In establishing laws and institutions for emperors and kings, one must first clarify Heaven’s intent, inwardly illuminating the Dao of Yin and Yang—then Great Peace will arrive.\n\nThe Heavenly Master thus joins with the August Heaven and Earth, constantly concentrating their essence and thought, their hearts deeply attuned to Heaven and Earth’s intent, like overlapping compasses or interlocking squares, not deviating even by a hair’s breadth. Knowing what Heaven and Earth constantly sorrow over, and foreseeing their great taboos—what are these?\n\nThe spirits of Heaven and Earth deeply lament and suffer from people’s disobedience and lack of filial piety. What does this mean? Within Heaven and Earth, the three qi of harmonious balance unite as one family to nurture the myriad things. Heaven governs life and is called Father; Earth governs nurturance and is called Mother; humanity governs governance and is called Child. The Child receives the mandate from the Father and is lovingly nurtured by the Mother. As a child, one must respectfully serve the Father and love the Mother—what does this mean?\n\nThe Father’s teachings have their measures and seasons, so he instructs and brings forth life in accordance with the four seasons. Wicked people oppose the Father’s intent, causing Heaven’s qi to lose its governance. This is like a household where the father is angry with his child, and father and child are at odds. Yin overcomes Yang, the lower deceives the upper, ministers neglect their duties, and demonic forces flourish. The positions of Heaven and Earth are like the distinction between male and female in humans—their likes and dislikes are the same. Heaven nurtures human life, and Earth nurtures human form.\n\nNow, all who jointly harm their Father and Mother—how is this so?\n\nThe qi of the four seasons is Heaven’s governance in motion, yet people oppose it, thus harming their Father. Earth is their Mother, from whom they receive clothing, food, and nurturance; yet instead of loving and benefiting her, they turn to harm her. Human conduct is most unseemly, defying all reason. They bore into the earth, launching vast earthworks—some digging deep to the Yellow Springs, others several fathoms down. The Mother alone grieves in sorrow, while her many children, utterly lacking in filial reverence, constantly vex her with resentment and stifled distress, yet she has no means to voice her plight. In ancient times, the sages moved with the seasons, yet even they could not fully grasp the intent of Heaven and Earth. Ordinary people, ignorant of the earth, do not perceive her pain and suffering, nor do they sense her influence upon Heaven. Thus, when the Father’s calamities recur, the Mother grows wrathful and ceases to nurture the myriad things. When both Father and Mother are enraged, how can their children escape disaster?\n\nHeaven and Earth are supremely compassionate, yet for the great crime of filial impiety, they grant no pardon—how can one not tremble? Great earthworks bring great disasters; small earthworks bring small disasters. It is the Earth’s wrath that summons the spirits to generate such calamities. If earthworks do not immediately result in disaster, it is because the land is good and kind. Where disaster strikes, the land is fierce and malevolent. The ruler’s harm extends even to distant lands—what does this mean? It is like a good and kind person who, though wronged, endures for a time, yet never forgets the grievance. The wicked cannot endure even for a moment before disaster befalls them.\n\nThe Earth’s body is vast, while humans, in comparison, are as small as dust. How can their digging possibly cause harm? Yet consider this: a person stands a fathom tall, ten spans in girth, and in the crevices of their teeth dwell tiny, insignificant worms. When these worms gnaw at the teeth, causing great pain, the person wails for a long time, and the teeth eventually fall out entirely. The disparity between humans and Heaven and Earth is like that between these worms and a person. Even if one’s teeth were as hard as metal or stone, these tiny, fleshy worms could still cause such harm. Now, if a strong and mighty man were powerless to resist a pint of mites gnawing at him, he would be stricken with pain and unable to lie down—severe cases would confine him to bed. Even fleas, lice, and other tiny creatures, when gathered in great numbers, can torment a person, causing restlessness and sores. Parasitic worms can kill, while fleas and lice bring only vexation and discomfort. The harm humans inflict upon Heaven and Earth is no different.\n\nTo dig into the earth and reach the springs is to draw the Earth’s blood; to uncover stone is to expose her bones; soil is her flesh. To take her blood, break her bones, and pierce her flesh, then cast bricks, stones, and hardwood into her depths—these are wounds upon her body. Earth is the Mother of all things, yet she suffers such afflictions—how can she remain at peace?\n\nAll who dwell upon the Mother’s body have their own hidden vulnerabilities. Digging one foot into the earth reaches the realm touched by the sun, where qi belongs to Heaven. Two feet down lies the realm where things grow, where qi is harmonious. Three feet down enters the Earth’s yin body, and beyond this, all digging harms her form.\n\nTo equalize virtue and power, to adjust values and prices, is to open the hearts of the foolish. Now, if I were to bestow upon you a thousand pounds of gold to offer to the state, would this win the favor of Heaven and Earth, regulate yin and yang, eradicate all disasters, grant the emperor long life, and bring about great peace? Or if I were to present a jade disc of myriad hues to the state, treasuring and hoarding it as the world’s rarest gem—would this cause the qi of the Six Directions to harmonize fully, summoning all auspicious signs, driving back the barbarians, and ensuring no harm for ten thousand miles?\n\nI have now fully expounded the Way to you. By following it, the emperor can secure the favor of Heaven and Earth, delighting all the spirits under heaven. Even the crawling and creeping creatures will rejoice, the barbarians will retreat in submission, auspicious signs will appear in full, disasters will vanish entirely, the state’s lifespan will be prolonged, and the people will enjoy long life.\n\nIf you truly embrace goodness and practice the teachings of this text, pondering its essential meaning, all will respond as if in echo. It is like aligning a compass with a square—there will be no deviation.\n\nTo give a state a thousand pounds of gold is not as valuable as imparting a single essential word to bring about great peace, eliminate disasters, and secure the realm. Ancient emperors never lacked for wealth or goods; what they lacked were *shi*—men of worth. They grieved that great sages did not come, that the people did not gather, and that all sought to attach themselves to foreign lands, growing ever more distant. This is what fails to accord with the will of August Heaven.\n\nEven if one were to amass gold, jade, and rare treasures stretching a thousand miles and towering to the heavens, it would never attract the great sages, immortals, or divine beings to aid the emperor’s governance. Yet this text is attended by the divine officials of the Three Luminaries, who constantly observe and illuminate it.\n\nThe conduct of the ruler’s ministers and people should be such that they constantly worry for their sovereign day and night. Their desire to bring peace stems from their concern for his suffering, and they rejoice when the emperor governs effortlessly, while the people and ministers emulate his filial piety and kindness.\n\nWhen the ruler aligns with the heart of Heaven above and the intent of Earth below, and the central realm ensures that all people are reverent, without grievances or resentment, even the crawling creatures will turn toward virtue. All things will find their proper place, Heaven and Earth will be harmonious and joyful, and the ruler’s lifespan will be extended. From the eldest to the youngest, none will commit evil in the realm. They will cherish their ruler, fearing his aging, and Heaven and Earth will surely send divine beings bearing elixirs to instruct the emperor in their use, granting him boundless longevity.\n\nWhat, then, is the conduct of the finest ministers and children? The foremost conduct of a filial child is this: when their parents grow old and frail, they dwell alone in quiet contemplation, pondering how to obtain the art of immortality to serve them. They scorn wealth and treasure the Way, seeking only to sustain life. They play the zither and sing to bring joy to their parents, guiding their hearts toward the Dao. They delight in remaining with them for all time, never knowing old age.\n\nEver seeking rare methods, they journey to distant lands, their sincerity moving Heaven, their efforts unceasing until their strength is spent. With clothing and food just sufficient for themselves, they no longer amass treasures for posterity, lest their parents be burdened with guarding them. Such is the foremost conduct of the finest filial child.\n\nWhen the finest disciples receive the Dao and virtue from their masters, mindful of the grace that enabled their growth into adulthood, they remain ever in the company of the wise and gentle, never straying from their ranks. Some attain rank and position to repay their parents; others delve deeply into the savor of the Dao, mastering the art of self-nurturance. All people are born of their parents, attain the completion of Dao and virtue through their masters, and gain honor and esteem from their rulers. Dwelling alone, they ponder how their ruler, master, and father will age, and how to repay them. They constantly strive to seek rare methods and extraordinary texts for their masters, that they may requite their merit. Some further study under the worthy, entrusting their masters to them and speaking on their behalf. Some enable their superiors to become the state’s finest aides, benefiting the emperor’s governance. Such are the noble disciples of the High Antiquity.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns and supreme sages of old overcame others through the utmost Dao and governance by virtue, never by might, severity, cunning, or deceit. Those who overcome others through might, severity, cunning, deceit, and punishment are but bandits and thieves. Bandits and thieves rely solely on these to subdue others—how then do the noble distinguish themselves, making their difference clear and manifest?\n\nThus, rulers of Dao and virtue ever regard severity, might, cunning, and deceit as the conduct of bandits and thieves. The Celestial Master’s writings often speak of the *qi* of the Supreme August and the advent of Great Peace—what does this mean? The sages established laws in accordance with symbolic meaning, abiding in the One and delighting in divination above all. *Divination* means inquiry. To constantly delight in acting above and inquiring without cease is the loftiest path. Thus, the character *shang* (上, \"above\") is a single stroke rising upward with *bu* (卜, \"divination\"); the character *xia* (下, \"below\") is a single stroke descending with *bu*. Constant inquiry and descent lead to the lowest extreme, so those who delight in descending further can no longer ascend.\n\nThe character *huang* (皇, \"august\") means \"to become king in a single day.\" The upper *yi* (一, \"one\") is the number of Heaven; attaining the One, one gains the illumination of the sun, and with great brightness, becomes king. The One and the sun-king combine to form *huang*. The One is Heaven, and Heaven is also the ruler. The sun embodies the ruler’s virtue, and the king is also the ruler’s superior. These three rulers together form *huang*, signifying resplendent virtue, foremost under Heaven, with none above.\n\n*Tai* (太) means \"great,\" signifying accumulation as vast as Heaven, with nothing greater than Heaven. *Ping* (平, \"peace\") means governing with supreme impartiality, ordering all affairs so that none remain unbalanced. It is like the earth, which abides below and upholds equilibrium. It is like sowing and reaping: planting good yields good, planting evil yields evil; toil in cultivation brings a bountiful harvest in return. Heaven’s *qi* delights in descending, Earth’s *qi* delights in ascending; the two *qi* interpenetrate to form the harmonious *qi* of the center, mutually receiving and nurturing the myriad things without harm. Thus is it called *Great Peace*.\n\nWhen the *qi* of Heaven and Earth harmonize as one, they jointly engender the myriad things. When man and woman unite in heart, they bear children. When father, mother, and child unite in heart, they form a household. When ruler, minister, and people unite in heart, they form a state. The emperor is Heaven’s noble child; as a child heeds his father’s teachings, he should act in accordance, alleviating Heaven and Earth’s concerns and thereby gaining their protection. Thus, he constantly strives to act with diligence.\n\nIf celestial patterns do not manifest, it is because the times know order and disorder, and the Dao does not emerge in vain. The emperors of old perceived the subtle and knew the manifest; acting in accordance with the moment and following the *qi*, they attained Heaven’s favor, their intentions ever auspicious. To act contrary brings discord between water and drought, *qi* in conflict and opposition, disasters accumulating into unceasing calamities and prodigies—these are called *portents and anomalies*. The multitude of worthies grow confused, unaware of the Dao of compliance and opposition. Were they to know it, when encountering Great Peace, they would govern with ease; when encountering middling peace, they would act with effort; when encountering disorder, they would rely on the Dao to aid and prepare themselves. It is like preparing for summer at the summer solstice and for winter at the winter solstice—this is the meaning.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven moves in constant cycles; to comply with it brings prosperity and flourishing, to oppose it brings peril and ruin. When the Dao of Heaven contends, its mandate is harmed; when the sun and moon lose their measure, the constellations move in disorder. Those who can employ it act with their own strength, daring not conceal the worthy, illuminating above and below, and enabling all to find peace.\n\nMoxibustion and acupuncture serve to harmonize and pacify the three hundred and sixty meridians, unblocking the *qi* of yin and yang to dispel harm. The three hundred and sixty meridians correspond to the three hundred and sixty days of the year, each meridian governing a day, moving in accordance with the four seasons and five phases, circulating throughout the body, converging within the crown of the head, and striking within the viscera. All respond to the four seasons in their movements; when ill, they fail to conform to their measures, their coming and going losing regularity, sometimes binding, sometimes injuring, sometimes flowing smoothly, sometimes reversing. Thus, they must be treated.\n\nFire is the essence of the Great Yang, the clarity of impartial justice, used to examine treachery and eliminate harm and evil. Acupuncture is the essence of the Lesser Yin, the substance of Venus, used with righteousness to cut and strike. When treatment succeeds in all one hundred cases, or in ten out of ten, this is the celestial canon of meridians and apocrypha; when truly in accord with the meridians, the spirits are commanded. When treatment succeeds in nine out of ten, missing one, and in harmony with the meridians, the essence is commanded. When treatment succeeds in eight out of ten, it is the human canon; human intention commands. Below this, illness cannot be treated, and harm may instead result. To treat the *jia* meridian when the *yi* meridian is afflicted is called *delirium*, failing to recognize the meridian’s solitary injury and severance.\n\nThus, to delight in knowing whether the celestial Dao is spiritually responsive or not is to place a single patient before oneself, naming it the *root text of the meridians*—like the root text of the scriptures and Dao—enabling the multitude of worthies to recognize the illness. Some excel in the upper, some in the lower; the three hundred and sixty meridians each have their insights. Taking the actions in which they commonly excel, the therapeutic methods are recorded: those that succeed in ten out of ten are correct, while all others are not.\n\nGathering the collective practices of healing and deeming those that cure as scripture ensures that none among the treated remain without resolution. My Dao is like the cyclical progression of *jiazi* and *yichou*, the six *jia* phases succeeding one another, the Five Agents turning in mutual accord, the four seasons revolving to return to their origin. Though the scrolls may be numerous, each has its recordable essence—like the human body, where head and feet serve one another in turn. One word omitted gives rise to another; the worthy follow in succession to lend support. Harmonizing yin and yang in speech, the outer and inner correspond as if by compass and square. At first recitation, it may seem tasteless, but with prolonged reflection and unwavering devotion, verification will come. Disasters depart from the body, spirit returns to gather, and people naturally become prudent and free of malevolence, living without punishment or penalty, while the transformative power of the Dao reaches its utmost beauty.\n\nBy clearly following my text, one averts blame and wards off calamity; calamity ceases of itself, and the people naturally attain longevity. The origin, having never obtained its root, knows no end or beginning. When ten out of ten correspond, it is the scripture of *Taiyang*. When nine out of ten correspond, it is the scripture of *Taiyin*. When eight out of ten correspond, it is the scripture of *Zhonghe*. When seven out of ten correspond, it is the scripture of *Poruination*. When six out of ten correspond, it is the scripture of *Excess*. When five out of ten correspond, it is the scripture of *Ignorance*—this may be called a text of half-fortune and half-misfortune. Fourteen out of ten is a perverse text. Thirteen out of ten is a text of great chaos. Twelve out of ten is an abandoned text. Eleven out of ten is a text of dissipation. From seventeen out of ten downward, it is unusable—a text that misleads people. The extent of harm inflicted will in turn harm the practitioner. Prolonged misuse without cessation violates the law, leading to the extinction of posterity—this is the text of ten out of ten.\n\nThose who delight in attaining its truth need only observe the sacred words of the sages of high antiquity, the sages of middle antiquity, and the sages of later antiquity. By harmonizing their speech and examining their deeds, it can be known. Further, reflect on the Daoist scriptures of high antiquity, middle antiquity, and later antiquity; when the three are united by kindred resonance, it becomes knowable once more. All written texts are the discourse of Heaven—why then do they heal in their time? If one can master their words and rectify their speech, principle is attained; if not rectified, obscurity and chaos ensue. Correct speech and detailed discourse must lead to goodness, while ominous speech and words must bring resentment.\n\nTo attain goodness, one need only rectify the root. When the root is rectified, it aligns with celestial patterns and accords with the sacred words. A second revolution aligns with heavenly principle, a third becomes human culture, and a fourth becomes the myriad things. Yet when the myriad things arise, superficial flourishes lead to chaos and ruin. When celestial patterns emerge, they serve to examine the primordial rectitude of the origin, removing excess and establishing its essence. Clarifying the principles of all texts is the Dao of Heaven. Those who grasp correct speech align with the intent of Heaven. Perversity invites malevolent qi, causing Heaven and Earth to lose their harmony, the myriad things to lose their proper places, and emperors and kings to suffer anxious toil, leading to further disorder. Thus, one must urgently examine and rectify it.\n\nFrom reflection to reflection, from antiquity to the present, all has been fully prepared. The reproaches of spirits and deities are not like those of ordinary people, which can be easily evaded or escaped. By winning the favor of spirits and deities, one can resolve the worries of the world, pacify emperors and kings, and ensure that the myriad things each attain their proper place. I uphold the Three Realities; the qi of *Taiping* arrives, deceit and falsehood depart, and treachery and cunning are extinguished.\n\nThe Perfected One asked: How many great urgencies are there in the world? How many minor urgencies? How many things bring misfortune and calamity yet are not urgent?\n\nThe Divine Person replied: One should refine oneself and speak in full. Generally, what is put to use in the world is urgent; what is not put to use is not urgent.\n\nThe Divine Person said: This appears correct but is not. There are things that must always be urgent and cannot be abandoned; abandoning them would leave the world extinct and devoid of people. Those principles that harmonize and coalesce without name are the great urgencies. Among the world’s great urgencies, there are two; among minor urgencies, there is one. All else is not urgent—it merely wearies the ears and eyes of people, inviting calamity, destroying families, and ruining states. Or it may sever posterity, all from attending to non-urgent affairs and thereby bringing such disasters.\n\nThus, when a person is born and receives their mandate, they partake of the body of Heaven and Earth, embracing primordial qi in spontaneity. Without drinking or eating, they live by inhaling and exhaling the qi of yin and yang, unaware of hunger or thirst. Over time, they drift far from the spiritual Dao and gradually lose their root. Later generations, ignorant of the true Dao, daily drift toward falsity, becoming subject to hunger and thirst. Without drink or food, they die—this is the first great urgency. Heaven and Earth, in their compassion, together produce things that can be consumed. Yet having eaten and drunk, one falls under the governance of yin and yang, subject to transmission, unable to centrally govern the continuity of Heaven and Earth. Transmission should mirror Heaven and Earth: one yin, one yang; one man, one woman—only then can generation continue.\n\nWhen yin reaches its extreme, yang is born; when yang reaches its extreme, yin is born. Yin and yang transmit to one another like cold and heat, a principle of spontaneity. Thus they can generate one another, perpetuating the continuity of Heaven and Earth through the ages. If the continuity of Heaven and Earth is severed, what becomes of husband and wife, father and son, ruler and minister, master and disciple? The one who comprehends the teachings of Heaven assists the emperor in transforming and completing the world. Thus, food and drink and the union of man and woman are mutually necessary—these are the two great urgencies.\n\nClothing is that on which one depends. With clothing, the worthy are born; without it, the unworthy arise. Thus, clothing serves to ward off harm. Therefore, the sagely emperors and enlightened kings of antiquity did not imitate the colors of dark and yellow but merely protected against cold and heat. The continuity of yin and yang in food and drink must not be severed; severing it would leave the world without the Dao of ruler and minister, father and son. Upholding these three, one completes the celestial years, transmits the celestial continuity, and though it ends, it begins anew, without end.\n\nThe sages of antiquity governed by this principle; all else is not urgent but merely invites calamity. Man is Heaven, woman is Earth, and clothing and food are *Zhonghe*. Beyond these three, all else is false and unnecessary for life—indeed, it often brings calamity and treachery, disrupts governance and balance, prevents the arrival of harmonious qi, causes the Dao of Heaven to go awry, and weighs heavily on the concerns of the noble person.\n\nThe six passions that delight the heart cannot be restrained by man; yielding to them invites calamity. The noble lose their governance, the petty spawn thoughts of theft and plunder, families perish, and states fall—never has this not arisen from indulgence in what is not urgent. The world grows impoverished, beset by sorrow, suffering, and disasters. Inferiors deceive their superiors, and daily they drift toward extravagance, thus inviting sorrow and suffering, failing to complete their celestial years. This compels the young to ceaseless toil, mountains and rivers are drained, primordial qi is severed, earthly qi weakens, and the nurturing of the myriad things falters. Heaven’s disasters and transformations follow, the people gradually dwindle, and deceit and falsehood arise anew.\n\nSuch is the harm wrought by what is not urgent, yet men seek to please their eyes and ears without awakening to the profound and vast perils. The Perfected One again asked the Divine Person: When a filial son serves his parents, after their passing does he serve them as he did in life? Or is there a difference? To serve them more than in life, or less?\n\nMan is born of his parents, grows to maturity, and when he sees them depart, never to return, he can no longer receive their teachings and admonitions. Yet in his comings and goings, he may still repay them; his thoughts and imaginings cannot cease. To serve them more than in life—is this not excessive?\n\nThe Divine Person replied: Your words are but the filial speech of the common world, not the intent of the Great Dao. Man in life resembles Heaven and belongs to Heaven; man in death resembles Earth and belongs to Earth. Heaven is the father; Earth is the mother. One does not serve the mother more than the father. Life is yang; death is yin. One does not serve yin more than yang. Yang is the Way of the ruler; yin is the Way of the minister. One does not serve the minister more than the ruler. To serve yin more than yang is to cause the qi of yin and yang to rebel, giving rise to disasters. To serve the lesser more than the greater is to cause governance to rebel, inviting great calamity.\n\nWhen yin qi prevails over yang, inferiors deceive their superiors, ghosts and malevolent spirits flourish, and though men walk by day, epidemics never cease. Yang qi is obstructed, the Way of the ruler declines, and the Way of the minister grows strong. Thus, the enlightened emperors and kings of antiquity exalted yang as paramount and humbled yin as their duty.\n\nThe sun is yang; the night is yin. When the sun is long, the night is short; when the night is long, the sun is short. When the sun is abundant, living men thrive; when the night is abundant, ghosts and spirits thrive. Man accompanies the sun; ghosts accompany the stars. The sun is yang; the stars are yin. Thus, when the sun appears, the stars flee; when the stars appear, the sun retreats. When yin prevails, ghosts and spirits bring harm—such is the harm wrought by yin.\n\nIn high antiquity, men governed mourning with sincerity alone, and their funerary rites did not exceed those of life. Human hearts were pure and simple, and illness was rare. In middle antiquity, governance gradually lost its standards, drifting toward extravagance. Resources were exhausted for funerary rites, and sacrifices grew lavish. Ghosts and spirits multiplied, the people suffered frequent epidemics, and malevolent spirits wrought havoc without end. In later antiquity, sacrifices to other spirits flourished, exalting yin. Serving ghosts and spirits harmed the living, ministers usurped the ruler’s authority, women dominated households, warfare erupted violently, deceit and flattery arose daily, and governance decayed. The Way of the ruler was no longer practiced. All this arose from exalting yin over yang, which the Way of Heaven abhors, bringing forth these disasters and misfortunes. Can one not be cautious?\n\nThe Master inscribed the text. The Master said: My name is \"Eleven [with *ming* as the limit].\" *Bingwu* and *dingsi* are the ancestral beginnings. Four mouths govern the principles of the myriad things. The child’s cap uses the corner to enliven its right. The hidden dragon must not be used; *kan* is the record. Those who behold it live long, dwelling [between Heaven and Earth] and nothing more. Governing a million people, one may await immortality. Those who skillfully heal illness must not act recklessly. Rejoicing in the marketplace of Chang’an, one may make men’s lives as long as the Queen Mother of the West, like the four seasons cycling endlessly. The ninety-character text is transmitted to the fangshi.\n\nThe Perfected One asked the Divine Person: I do not yet grasp the meaning and direction of the ninety-character text on life previously bestowed. I wish for a thorough explanation to bequeath to later generations, that it may be preserved and not forgotten.\n\nThe Divine Person replied: I will explain it to you directly. The Master said: My name is \"Eleven, with *ming* as the limit.\" The Master refers to the divine teacher of the August Heaven. *Yue* means \"words.\" I now speak the correct words of Heaven, having been personally sent down to fully expound them to emperors, kings, and the myriad people, resolving the karmic retributions of bearing and shouldering across billions of generations.\n\n*Wu* means \"I,\" the divine messenger urgently dispatched by Heaven. Today, the disasters of bearing and shouldering flow in four directions. From their very roots to their later principles, all lose their governance, with no means to halt or sever them. They harm one another, causing profound calamity, which Heaven regards with grave concern.\n\n*Zi* refers to the characters now arrayed in the celestial text, accumulated in writing. *Shi* means that the text and the celestial truth are sincere and aligned, tenfold without error, not a single deception. Those who obtain it and are wise will deeply reflect: their ancestors all bore karmic burdens. If these are not halted, the misfortunes of bearing and shouldering, great and small, will all be removed.\n\n*Yi* is the essential principle, the correct path to begin with guarding the One. Guarding the One without cease, one’s brightness grows daily, and Heaven’s confusion is dispelled. *Ming* is the limit; the limit is sufficiency. Sufficiency means that for those who practice this Way, each day brings benefit, shining brightly, no longer shrouded in darkness and ignorance.\n\n*Shiyi* is the scholar. *Ming* as the limit is red. Red qi refers to this, which will again flourish in great brightness. The limit is the sufficiency of the myriad things. When the myriad things first sprout, they straighten their roots to grow from their foundation. Practicing this Way, its method returns to the primordial qi, attaining the heart of Heaven and Earth. It is the first and finest, governance that accords with the Way of the Supreme Sovereign.\n\n*Bingwu* and *dingsi* are fire, red.\n\nThe *bingwu* day is pure yang; the *dingsi* day is pure yin. Yin and yang govern harmony, and when yang qi returns to harmonious union, all under Heaven accords with it. Those who act do so for the benefit of emperors and kings; yin brings misfortune and harm.\n\nThe *zu* is the ancestor, the first, symbolizing the virtue of the Three Sovereigns. The *shi* is the return to the original beginning. Practicing this Way is to revert to the transformation of the Three Sovereigns above.\n\nFour mouths govern the ordering of the myriad things. \"Four and obtaining the mouth\" refers to speech. All who daily recite my writings will obtain the celestial orthodox script and characters. When their aspirations align, they unite with the heart of Heaven, enabling the myriad things to each find their proper place without further disorder—hence the ordering of the myriad things.\n\nThe child’s headband uses horn to govern the right: this is recitation. Reciting this scripture without cease, all matters will suddenly be rectified. Above, one gains the heart of Heaven, ever joyful, without further betrayal.\n\nThe *qianlong* does not act; *kan* serves as the guiding principle. The *qianlong* is Heaven’s yang qi, returning to the initial nine, the *jiazi* year’s winter solstice day, when Heaven and Earth first arise. The dragon is the lesser yang of the east, the spirit of wood. Thus, the Dao of Heaven follows wood to generate the fire phase. When things are about to flourish, they must first open their gates and doors.\n\nWhen the true person reaches the appointed month, they should reveal this scripture in a place of luminous clarity. *Kai* means to open, to make unimpeded. Opening to the south further purifies and expands the yang qi, dissolving the accumulated misfortunes of *chengfu*. *Qian* means to conceal. The Dao, having reached its destination, returns to hiddenness. *Wu yong* means \"do not dare\" or \"not yet.\" Those who first see the text do not yet know how to practice it. *Yong* means to govern, to act.\n\nToday, this scripture should be used to eliminate disasters. In the *xuanjia* year, it should be employed, yet at that time, rulers may not deeply grasp its meaning and thus fail to apply it. Hence, \"do not act\" means that Heaven does not yet dare to entrust sole faith in it for immediate implementation. Those who believe and apply it will see affairs respond like an echo, serving as clear proof that it accords with the Dao of Heaven.\n\n*Kan* as the guiding principle refers to *zi* as *kan*. *Jia* is Heaven’s guiding rope, the rope being yang. *Kan* is water, yin, the guiding principle. Thus, Heaven and Earth constantly unite their guiding ropes and principles. In the initial *xuanjiazi*, this scripture emerges for virtuous rulers to govern and transform, establishing guiding principles—hence *kan* as the guiding principle.\n\nThis is the scripture of the Supreme Sovereign above, revealed for virtuous rulers below as the true canon to sever evil. With *xuanjia* as the beginning and *zi* as the root, it is thus arranged in sequence by *jiazi*. Those who obtain and see it will enjoy long life.\n\nThe *ren zheng* refers to the human ruler, the singular emperor or king. Those of superior virtue easily awaken and know to practice the scripture of the Way. Relying on auspicious signs, they do not doubt the Dao of Heaven. Deeply grasping its meaning, they attain longevity, fulfilling their destined lifespan.\n\n*Chang* means boundless; *jiu* means to endure, to dwell between Heaven and Earth and live. Dwelling between Heaven and Earth, one should study the true Dao. Florid and ornate writings cannot grant enduring life. All the accumulated misfortunes of *chengfu* stem from the lack of a substantive Dao—today, these are severed.\n\nGoverning the myriad people, immortality may be awaited, for its principle is correct. Heaven uses this scripture to rectify the hearts of all worthies, each ordering their illnesses, guarding the true and expelling the false. \"Immortality may be awaited\" means that when all under Heaven hear of the true Dao, they will swiftly and entirely cast off [falsehoods], aiding the virtuous ruler in governing with the true Dao to enliven people—hence immortality may be awaited.\n\nThose who skillfully govern illness must not deceive or endanger. All people are foolish, neglecting the spirits of their bodies and indulging in deceptive and false writings. Without cause, they endanger themselves, incurring Heaven’s severe punishment and bearing the great responsibility of *chengfu*. Thus, Heaven causes them to abandon florid writings and each guard the true and real, preserving their daily efforts to practice, ensuring lasting benefit without further deception or peril.\n\n\"Joy in the marketplace of Chang’an.\" Joy is the supreme joy when the qi of the Supreme Sovereign’s Great Peace arrives. Alas! Its virtue is vast and unmatched. *Chang* means that practicing this Way, one’s virtue is good and boundless. *An* means no further peril or ruin. Those who practice this Way will see the obligations of *chengfu* between Heaven and Earth entirely dispelled, achieving lasting peace, vast and unburdened, without further sorrow.\n\nThe *shi* (marketplace) is where Heaven gathers people together. Practicing this scripture, the nation’s people will flourish like those in a bustling city. \"Enabling longevity like the Queen Mother of the West\" means enabling people—referring to emperors and kings of great virtue who delight in practicing the correct writings. *Ruo* means to follow. Those who greatly follow my writings will align with the Dao of Heaven, attaining great fortune without misfortune.\n\n*Xi* (west) means that all people nest the true Dao in their hearts. *Wang* (king) means that the emperor, practicing the Dao of Heaven, will greatly prosper and reign. Its principle is good, supreme. *Mu* (mother) is the proof of longevity, the elder of spirits. It is like the four seasons returning to their beginning.\n\n*Bi* (comparison) is like the transmission of the four seasons, mutually generating and completing one another without further harm. Its principle is without punishment. Ninety-character strategies are transmitted to the *fangshi*.\n\nNine is the ultimate; practicing this Way, one’s virtue ultimately harmonizes with the heart of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, and the myriad things. Ten is the mutual resonance of tens, without contrived writings. *Zi* (characters) refers to the celestial writings above and below, circulating and pervading the Dao to completion. *Chuan* (transmission) means trust; thus, writings are made to preserve the talismanic trust and transmit it.\n\n*Fang* is great rectitude. Holding this Way and hastening to entrust it to a virtuous ruler can dispel the misfortunes of *chengfu*, and its principle will achieve great rectitude.\n\nThe *shi* (士) refers to those of unwavering resolve and singular purpose. Such individuals of singular purpose possess upright hearts and are receptive to teaching and instruction; sending them to transmit this Way, the efficacy of my strategies shall become manifest.\n\nHeaven admonishes through celestial writings. When Heaven offers minor admonitions, its countenance alters; when major admonitions arise, Heaven trembles and splits. If its admonitions go unheeded, destruction follows. The Three Luminaries—when minor admonitions occur, minor affairs cause the stars to change hue; when major admonitions arise, the Three Luminaries lose their proper measure and dim. If unheeded, destruction follows. Earth—when minor admonitions occur, it quakes and sways; when major admonitions arise, the land collapses and the earth splits. If unheeded, destruction follows. The Five Phases—when minor admonitions occur, disasters arise; when major admonitions arise, the Wood Phase brings insects that kill people, the Fire Phase brings poison that kills people, the Metal Phase brings tigers and wolves that kill people, the Water Phase brings aquatic creatures that kill people, and the Earth Phase brings officials and commoners to cruelly harm and kill one another. If unheeded, destruction follows. The Four Seasons—when minor admonitions occur, cold and heat fall out of balance; when major admonitions arise, cold and heat reverse their positions, and the seasons lose all proper order. If unheeded, destruction follows. The thirty-six *jingqi*—when minor admonitions arise together, disorder erupts, and pests emerge, some flying, some crawling; clouds and winds multiply yet bring no rain, leaving emptiness without substance. When major admonitions arise, floods and droughts lose all measure, killing and harming the myriad things and the people. If unheeded, destruction follows. Flying and crawling creatures—when minor admonitions occur, they harm people; when major admonitions arise, birds and beasts devour people, and locusts swarm in great numbers. If unheeded, destruction follows. Ghosts, spirits, and numinous beings—when minor admonitions occur, they rise up to afflict and sicken the people; when major admonitions arise, they bring execution and the extermination of entire households. If unheeded, destruction follows. The Six Directions—when minor admonitions occur, winds and rains erupt in chaos, raging and venomous, harming the people. When major admonitions arise, they impose tyranny beyond reason, causing stones to fly from the earth, shaking the pillars of Heaven, shattering houses, and moving mountains and hills. If unheeded, destruction follows. The voices of Heaven and Earth—when minor admonitions occur, thunder and lightning grow slightly fierce; when major admonitions arise, thunderbolts strike repeatedly. If unheeded, destruction follows. Officials and commoners—when minor admonitions occur, their countenances change; when major admonitions arise, they inflict much harm and violence. If unheeded, destruction follows.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth and the Six Directions of the Eight Extremities all issue major admonitions, seeking rectification, the writings of the Yellow River and Luo River emerge. Heaven’s luminosity bears witness to the world, and the *Ruiying Shu* (Record of Auspicious Responses) appears to admonish and rectify the ruler. The world responds in unison; if unheeded, destruction follows.\n\nThe cycles of the celestial Dao converge when their time arrives, and the sequence resumes in due order. Thus, the sages and worthies of antiquity pondered day and night without dare of slackening. Losing even a hair’s breadth, they perceived the subtle and knew the manifest, never straying from the heart of August Heaven. Therefore, they preserved their persons, pacified their people, nourished the myriad things, and knew no peril or destruction. Calamities and misfortunes could not approach, for their plans and calculations aligned with the intent of Heaven.\n\nWhat Heaven aids, it aids those who are easy to instruct, those of utmost sincerity, those who are reverent and compliant, those who are easy to enlighten, and those who are vigilant. Heaven’s favor toward emperors and kings is most profound. Yet when myriad errors and changes accumulate to this point, and its teachings go unheeded, it abandons them to their fate. The spirits of Heaven and Earth no longer offer admonitions for rectification. Disasters and anomalies increase daily, the people dwindle and decline, and their proper roles are lost.\n\nThe sagely emperors and enlightened kings of antiquity, from dawn to dusk, governed with effortless grace. They deeply pondered and examined the heart of Heaven, never daring to stray from it. Thus, they served August Heaven as a father, August Earth as a mother, the sun as an elder brother, and the moon as an elder sister. They rectified the celestial patterns, preserved the Five Phases, followed the Four Seasons, and observed their movements to reflect upon and correct their own conduct, thereby knowing their gains and losses.\n\n*Excerpt from the Third Scroll of the Bing Section of the* Taiping Jing *Abstract Concluded*\n*(Note: The character* huo *活, \"active/living,\" was originally miswritten as* zhi *治, \"to govern.\" Corrected according to the \"Jie Shi Ce Shu Jue\" section of the original text. See the collated edition.)*\n\n#2 *‘Million’* originally miswritten as *‘hundred regions’*; corrected according to the scripture.\n\n**Abstract from the Fourth Scroll of the Ding Section of the** *Taiping Jing*: *The Diagram of the Womb and Embryo, Yin and Yang’s Compass and Square, and the Rectification of Conduct to Dissolve Evil*\n\nThe divine being spoke, the perfected one entered within. Child, you have already understood—diminish the self, and your intent shall be fulfilled.\nExternally, principle rectifies itself. With eyes closed, gaze inward to commune with the spirits.\nSpeak not, and you align with the Dao. Yin and Yang mutually enfold, sealed by Heaven.\nThe art of long life may open your eyes.\n\nChild, do not harden your bowels; rather, harmonize and expand.\nHeaven and Earth receive harmony like the deaf and blind.\nTo know its intent, observe the child within the womb.\nAbstain from food for ten months, and the spirits will commune.\nThe natural Dao has no superior—without seeing, qi dwells in the twelvefold abode.\n\nThus, returning to infancy averts misfortune.\nAging reverses to youth, uniting with the Dao.\nTherefore, the twelvefold image is drawn:\nThe upright attain goodness; the unworthy alone meet misfortune.\nThe Dao of Heaven endures, never lost or perishing.\nIts form cycles like the four seasons, returning home.\nAging reverses to beginnings—hence, long life.\n\nChild, ponder its intent without deviation.\nAccumulate virtue, amass conduct, and the Dao will naturally form.\nTalent falls short of effort; the Dao returns to its person.\nIf not its person, the Dao does not act in vain.\nThe Dao is like the wind—silently abiding beside you.\nUse it, and it exists; neglect it, and it vanishes.\n\nThe worthy have their dwelling; the unworthy, their domain.\nLife and death reside in the body, ever fixed in conduct.\nHeaven commits no error—humans bring ruin upon themselves.\nPonder its intent carefully; act not recklessly.\n\nHeaven bestows long life upon those who guard the Dao and exert effort.\nHumans refuse to do so—hence, they incline toward death.\nRemember my admonition: the Dao, transmitted to its person, is easily practiced.\nThe sages of antiquity passed down the Dao, swearing blood oaths.\nThe Dao of Heaven is weighty; fools treat it lightly.\n\nThe Dao is the teacher of the ten thousand things.\nThose who attain it are enlightened; those who lose it are deluded.\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast, they do not lose even a hair’s breadth.\nThe wise and sagely nurture themselves to compare with the spirits.\nTheir discourse unites the governance of Yin and Yang, the pivot of Heaven and Earth.\nThe sages of antiquity deeply understood this—thus, they distinguished themselves with the essence of Heaven’s Dao.\nInternally, they ordered the self; externally, they dissolved calamities.\nWhat should not be done brings shared sorrow with Heaven and Earth.\nDistinguish the four modes of governance.\n\nFor the officers of emperors and kings, all ministers should age, while the young are not suited to govern the world.\nI observe Heaven’s qi: of late, it has been repeatedly disharmonious.\nThe fault sometimes lies with officials who fail in sincerity, causing the seasonal qi to fall out of balance.\nThe lord of men is unclear; disasters and harms arise together, and Daoists are also harmed.\nEven the Three Luminaries of Heaven and Earth suffer affliction—thus, there is no true clarity.\nDaoists alone escape unscathed.\n\nThough I alone have long enjoyed Heaven’s favor, I dare not presume to preserve myself.\nFrom youth, I served my teachers and inquired of affairs, yet could not fully comprehend them.\nThe Heavenly Master resolved their essential intent, lest I never again attain such knowledge.\n\nGovernance has four methods:\nThe principle of Heaven,\nThe principle of Earth,\nThe principle of Man—\nWhen the three qi reach their utmost, then the principle of all things moves and acts.\nI wish to hear their intent.\n\nThe principle of Heaven: when ministers age, the lord treats them as a father.\nThough ministers are lowly, why treat them as teachers and fathers?\nThough their rank is humble, their virtue and power are weighty.\nTreating them as teachers and fathers means learning from their virtue and power,\nAligning strategies to pacify the world.\n\nThe principle of Earth: befriend ministers as those of shared aspiration and heart.\nYin submits; mother and child share rank, womb-mates share sorrow.\nThough ministers’ rank is humble, their virtue harmonizes the lord’s governance.\n\nThe principle of Man: humble the self, for ministers are young and small,\nLike a father begetting a child. The child is young and small, unable to devise strategies for the father—hence, minor disorder arises.\nThose who govern the world regard all ministers as teachers and fathers.\nThus, a father loves his child—what peril could arise?\nTeachers and fathers resolve the eight directions’ perils for their child—what loss could occur?\n\nThe principle of Earth: all ministers under Heaven are the lord’s friends.\nThose of shared aspiration align strategies in fellowship, sharing sorrows to secure their positions.\nEarth submits and upholds the above, fully receiving Heaven’s intent—all attain Heaven’s heart.\nWhat time would not be peaceful?\n\nThe principle of Man: attaining the qi of central harmony.\nHarmony may advance or retreat, hard to discern—like a young child unable to plan for the father, deceiving him.\nYoung ministers cannot deeply plan for the lord—hence, they deceive him.\nThe young grow with the sun and moon, their learning shallow, lacking awe—thus, they deceive.\nHence, governance of the young is disordered.\n\nThe principle of the moving and acting: lacking principle and righteousness, the ten thousand things know little, possessing no virtue and power.\nThe moving and acting of the ten thousand things have no above or below, seeking only victory—hence, disorder and defeat arise.\n\nThe principle of Heaven: humans cherish life and do no harm.\nThe principle of Earth: following goodness, minor harm may occur.\nThe principle of Man: mutual benefit and many desires lead to frequent mutual harm, deceit, and peril.\nThe principle of the moving and acting: ultimately, no success—no above or below, seeking only victory.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, it is common to employ those unsuited to their abilities,\nForcing what they cannot do, making difficult what they cannot,\nObserving their inability to act, their inability to speak,\nNot pitying and teaching them, but instead blaming them,\nCausing grievances to bind, multiplying resentment and disputes.\nThe people are sorrowful, suffering, and impoverished, gazing upward to call to Heaven.\nSincere grievances and bound qi move the six directions—\nHence, disasters and anomalies arise in profusion, accumulating in myriad forms, not swiftly removed.\nThe harm is grave—this reveals the hearts and minds of the world’s people.\n\nUltimately, no success is achieved; anomalies never cease.\nHow can the qi of Great Peace arise?\nThus, the failure to attain the qi of Great Peace lies precisely here.\n\nThe ten thousand things under Heaven each have their proper place.\nOne should employ their strengths, what they can do,\nAnd not force what they cannot.\n\nAll things cherish the qi of yin and yang. It is like fish that cannot traverse high mountains, yet when water is present, they may depart regardless of height or depth. Great trees cannot rise without bounds—they grow within rivers and seas.\n\nThus, the sage-kings of antiquity, in receiving their charge, took from the five soils what was fitting for each. Their creatures thrived in goodness and excellence, flourishing abundantly, and the state grew rich. Now, ancestral temples offer sumptuous feasts, and all under Heaven is at peace, free from suffering. Malign qi ceases, no longer moving to cause harm.\n\nIf one does not examine the land before planting, the myriad things will not complete their natural spans but perish prematurely. Grievances remain unresolved, leading to untimely ends, which move August Heaven above. The harvest fails, the state falls into dire poverty, food lacks savor, ancestral temples hunger and thirst, all under Heaven is mired in sorrow, and the people turn to mutual harm. Rulers and ministers deceive one another, inner and outer realms speak in discordant tongues. The fault arises precisely here—this is the root of great harm, the path to peril and ruin.\n\nThose who obtain this text and read it often suffer from not mastering it. Those who master it perceive its meaning with their eyes, yet if they do not deeply ponder its intent, if they do not study it with precision, even possessing this text brings no benefit. To obtain it and not exert oneself in practice—how does this differ from not obtaining it at all? To see food and not eat—how is this different from having no grain? To see broth and not drink—can thirst be quenched? This is not to grieve for others but to harm oneself. Can one not reflect carefully?\n\nThus, the sage exerts effort in thought, the noble person in study, day and night without ceasing. They delight in emulating Heaven’s ceaseless revolution, as the hundred rivers flow and gather to form the great seas.\n\nTake heed of my words.\n\nHeaven’s affairs each follow their own laws. Decrees may be assigned, the Dao may be enacted, yet their emergence may come sooner or later, their signs gradually appearing. It is like the myriad things: they first sprout in *zi*, grow in *mao*, branch in *wu*, mature in *you*, and conclude in *hai*. Though their signs may be foreseen, their outcome cannot be assured.\n\nEach matter has its proper time for action. When its light and shadow are first glimpsed, though the event has not yet arrived, its path may be prepared in advance. Heaven’s portents always appear ahead, never trailing behind. When the right person is found, the way is opened; those who see and are aided by it succeed. If one does not comprehend this and acts without success, it is because the person is not the right one.\n\nThus, this serves as clear proof. The Dao is examined and spoken of, and in ten thousand cases, not one is lost. If the person is right, the way is opened for them; if not, it remains closed. When the right person is found, illnesses may be dispelled, disasters and anomalies vanish of themselves, and the barbarians submit without need of arms—they all fade away on their own.\n\nAll things have their proper arrangements and deployments. With the right person, they proceed naturally; without, they withdraw. In all matters, if the right person is not found, one must not force action. One must not forcibly take what is not one’s friend, nor forcibly plant what is not suited to the land—what is planted will not grow. If words are not good, if the inner does not find its proper place, how can it endure?\n\nThe six extremes and eight directions each have their fitting uses. Their creatures all manifest, yet each matter differs. The great person who obtains this uses it to pacify the state; the middling person becomes a worthy minister; the petty person uses it to preserve themselves.\n\nResponding to Heaven’s principles, harmonizing above and below, calamities are dispelled, treachery and deceit are severed, and the roots of ominous texts are cut off.\n\nThe people of high antiquity all had hearts that were open, eyes that were bright, and ears that were clear. They foresaw what had not yet come to pass, deeply contemplating the future, moving even the unresponsive. Their distinction was self-evident, and no undertaking of theirs failed. What they spoke and taught was always steadfast and penetrating. They did not lose the heart of August Emptiness, yearning for the boundless wisdom and words of the boundless.\n\nThey knew the lengthening and shortening of human lifespans, each having its allotted portion. They constantly harmonized yin and yang to grasp their waxing and waning, taking the essential from above, below, and the center. They made covenants with the multitude of spirits, yet none dared transgress the great taboos of Heaven and Earth. What they revered and obtained accorded with Heaven’s will, and documents were submitted upward to the Heavenly Sovereign.\n\nWhen the Heavenly Sovereign received the documents and saw their self-imposed restraints clearly delineated, only then were decrees issued, preventing self-reproach. The upright advanced of themselves, their voices heard without report, resounding clearly above and below. Laws and regulations never missed their appointed times. Fearing they might fall short, they never failed to reproach themselves. Constantly wary of faults, they were overseen by recording spirits who reported them. They never slackened, and when faults were seen, they were demoted and replaced.\n\nThus, they repeatedly admonished themselves, reiterating their words to ensure they did not deviate from what was said. This is what Heaven expects to be revered, what the gods and spirits look up to—all must follow the law without ceasing, ever fearful of failing to reach their mark. What they received was not uniform, yet all required an open heart and mind, lest they miss their appointed time.\n\nSpirits have their ranks, high and low, and serve one another. If they do not act as spoken, they are promptly recorded and set apart. Their hearts are filled with sorrow, ever as if starving and thirsting for food.\n\nWhen the Heavenly Sovereign speaks, the decrees are issued accordingly, appointing overseers. The documents are not few, and one must grasp their intent, for each has its own reliability.\n\nThe people of high antiquity, in matters of gain and loss, observed the inner and outer, above and below, gazing to the four directions and beyond the four corners. They saw the guiding principles, as months and years advanced, and spiritual communications renewed. What limit was there to this?\n\nThe degrees of the stars each have their principles, never shifting. Matters follow one another in succession, with no room for doubt. All knew the origins of fortune and misfortune, thus establishing the calendar and its records.\n\nThree hundred and sixty days, with both major and minor reckonings, were held without missing the smallest fraction—this was the short month. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter each had their proper principles. The clepsydra’s rise and fall, the water’s swiftness or slowness, the division between new and old—all were made known, never missing by even a fraction.\n\nEach month was set in place, with the twenty-four solar terms. The arrows before and after numbered seven or eight terms, as did the long days. These were used to enter and exit the sacrifices to the gods of Heaven and Earth, enabling the hundred officials to follow the clepsydra’s marks. If the appointed times were missed, the failure to respond incurred multiple offenses.\n\nThus the division of day and night followed the lengthening and shortening of days, with one hundred marks as the cycle, never allowing the slightest deviation. In a state of virtue, the days grew longer and the water flowed more slowly, each inch precisely corresponding to the regulated measure. Yet in many states today, this is not observed—the days and months are slightly shorter, with each mark reduced to eight or nine parts. Thus the elderly, whose years should be weak, paradoxically grow robust, while their lifespans naturally diminish. How can they endure for long? If a state has many ministers, the pivot and balance of governance move sluggishly. The young may enjoy fleeting fortune, barely drawing breath, yet even without overt wrongdoing, they will face retribution.\n\nThe radiance of Heaven and Earth resides in the south, where *sì* and *wǔ* hours share a single domain, and *lí* serves as the true eye. In the affairs of the Hall of Light, the sun shines from south to north, the advance and retreat of *yang* qi never straying from its constant course. As *yin* and *yang* press upon one another, reaching toward the *zǐ* direction, cold and warmth align in perfect accord, their illumination penetrating all naturally—most delightful indeed.\n\nThe Way of nurturing life lies in the interplay of lesser *yang* and greater *yang*, where wood and fire flourish in mutual glory, each attaining its desire. What conflict could arise? Inner and outer harmonize in succession, without misnaming anything. Above, it extends to the imperial radiance; below, to the realm of silence. In tranquil spontaneity, the myriad things bloom in splendor, all clearly discernible. Without effort, it achieves completion—this is what Heaven reveres. Those who receive its name are guided by the pivot and balance, where life and death have their appointed times. The Registrar of Destinies upholds the ledgers, the records of fate flowing unimpeded, never failing to summon in response.\n\nWhen seeking something, the spirit-led registers verify the truth before ascending to the Heavenly Lord, who presides over all. The spirits who report do not stray from his side, and both within and without, they are revered. They dare not act on private whim, ensuring that all ascents and descents occur without missing their proper time. The officials of greater *yin* dare not slacken, diligently tending the gates and chambers of the celestial bureaus. Fearful of speaking out of turn, they instead support one another in goodness and essential ways, recording names on memorials. Once instructed, they act without deviating by even a fraction.\n\nIn ancient times, sages of profound wisdom perceived all without obstruction, their vision unhindered. Receiving the Way of spirit illumination, they understood it clearly, for it possessed its own laws, never straying from constancy. From the *Tàichū* era onward, calendars have varied in length, profound and subtly wondrous. From antiquity to the present, the essence of calendrical systems lies in their establishment and completion. Through mental calculation and observation, all that is accomplished below aligns with the work above, the numbers corresponding like a plumb line. Years, months, and days are tallied, their great divisions accounted for.\n\nNow Heaven and Earth rejoice in abundant years, and the emperor should sit in tranquil rule, free from care. The people need only wander at leisure, with few duties, while the five grains no longer command their former value, their worth unmeasured. The world engages in brewing fine wine to share in drink, and market roads flourish to excess—this is called the \"Water Decree,\" yet the conduct of fire harms the transformation of *yang*.\n\nWhen a person drinks even one measure of wine and becomes drunk, wild pulses arise. Trade and duties are neglected, leading to brawls and deaths. Some are wounded or robbed; others arrive at the market early only to return belatedly. Some fall prey to villains, or tumble from heights, or are struck by carts and horses. The harms of wine are manifold, beyond counting. Consider the markets across the Four Seas—how much grain is consumed in a single month? Hundreds of millions of *dǒu* and *hú* vanish, while senseless killings occur daily.\n\nSome are left childless, their lineages severed. Others incur the enmity of parents, who plot harm. Still others bring calamity upon their descendants. Local officials and magistrates cannot resolve these matters, beating their chests and crying to Heaven, moving the imperial spirits. This disrupts the *qi* of *yin*, *yang*, the four seasons, and the five phases, reversing the governance of the August Emperor of Great Peace and causing the *qi* of Great Harmony to flow contrary to its course.\n\nAll this stems from needlessly compelling the people to brew wine, wasting the five grains and inviting such disasters. If a virtuous ruler were to issue clear commands, declaring to officials and people: \"From this day forward, anyone who dares to sell or drink even one *dǒu* of wine without cause shall receive thirty strokes of the cane and three days of penal labor. For two *dǒu*, sixty strokes and six days; for three *dǒu*, ninety strokes and nine days.\" The duration of penal labor should correspond to the measure of wine consumed, and wine-sellers shall be subject to the same. All shall be made to repair city walls, roads, and government buildings—this is the great work of earth.\n\nEarth overcomes water, suppressing and extinguishing its excess, preventing water from harming *yang* beyond measure. Water is greater *yin*, the people; if it prevails, it will injure the king and deplete the essence of *yang*—the harm is profound. Repairing roads fosters the flourishing of the great Way, with like influencing like, gradually establishing Great Peace.\n\nExamining the myriad things of Heaven and Earth, *yin* and *yang*, above and below, they govern and nurture one another in mutual affection. Establishing merit and achieving renown, one’s heart governs a single household, so that people no longer harbor hatred but instead delight in unity of purpose. The *qi* of Great Harmony will emerge daily, bringing great peace. The Six Directions will share one heart, the Eight Regions one plan. Where governance aligns with human intent, all will respond with joy.\n\nThis is the primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth, uniting the positions of *yin* and *yang*. Wickedness and perversity will silently vanish, the rebellious will all submit, and the great and numinous Way will be revealed—the spirits and deities will cherish it. I now ascend to expound the Dao and virtue to August Heaven, descend to distinguish the measures of mountains and rivers, and establish laws for emperors and kings. The worthy among them will cultivate good intentions.\n\nThus I resolve the great grievances of Heaven and Earth, freeing the emperor from sorrow and toil. The people will love one another, and all things will find their proper place. The constant laws of Heaven remain unhidden. In ancient times, sagely emperors and enlightened kings valued great ministers, cherished recluses, benefited the people, and refrained from harm. Ministers, in turn, were loyal and trustworthy, never deceiving their ruler—thus their governance was divine.\n\nA wise father constantly seeks to bring peace to his son, and the son constantly seeks to bring joy to his father. When the two join forces with one heart, no household matter remains unaccomplished. But if they do not unite in purpose, the family’s Way falls into chaos. Duties are neglected, leaving them destitute and impoverished. Strife and division arise, leading to mutual harm. Even flesh and blood, born of the same body and bound as limbs, turn against one another—how much more so when gathering people of different surnames to serve as ruler, teacher, and father?\n\nThus the sage perceives the subtle and knows the manifest, and therefore places great emphasis on caution and vigilance.\n\nThe teacher is yang, loving his disciples and guiding them with the virtuous Way, so they understand to revere Heaven and cherish Earth, honor their superiors and benefit their inferiors. The disciples, in turn, respectfully serve their teacher with obedience, diligence, loyalty, and trustworthiness. When the two join forces with one heart, they study the ancient laws and institutions of past and present, practice the words of the sages, clarify the boundaries of Heaven and Earth, and govern the myriad things, allowing each to find its proper place. Accumulating virtue without cease, they become the worthy assistants of emperors and kings, joining in counsel to together bring about Great Peace.\n\nIf they do not unite in strength and purpose, failing to transmit the essential Way, but instead pursue superficial and external words, deceiving one another and endangering themselves, they defy Heaven’s principles of order, disrupt the words of the sages, and leave the Six Extremes indistinct—becoming a great calamity for the world. If emperors and kings follow such teachers, they lose the principles of governance, turning instead to become the great enemies of Heaven and Earth, failing to receive the intent of the divine spirits. This is the greatest harm to the world.\n\nHuman life is endowed with both yin and yang; movement and stillness, anger and joy all have their proper times. When the time for the union of male and female has not yet come, it is the duty of yin and yang to govern the effects of generation. The Way of Heaven is completed through threefold union; thus a child walks at three years, and three times three makes nine, bringing the harmonious Way to fulfillment. Before knowing the union of male and female, the timely thoughts within cannot yet be expressed.\n\nThe number of Heaven is five, the number of Earth is five, and the number of humanity is five. Three fives make fifteen, and the internal qi stirs. Four fives make twenty, aligning with the qi of the four seasons to express desire. The four seasons govern generation, and thus desire seeks to generate. Five fives make twenty-five, and the qi of the Five Phases is sufficient to bear expression. Five sixes make thirty, and strength is attained. Thus Heaven causes constant thoughts of expression to circulate the continuity of Heaven and Earth, to propagate kind, and to meet at thirty years before exemption. In old age, one declines; the young cease to engage in inner chambers.\n\nAll creatures that crawl upon the earth are but reflections of Heaven and Earth; the rest cannot do so. Thus, in one day and one night, Heaven and Earth together nurture twelve thousand things, bringing them all to life. Night is deep—this is yin; day is dry—this is yang. Each day, Heaven and Earth together nourish these twelve thousand things to completeness. The law of Heaven is that yang unites with essence to become rain, yang’s expression descending into the earth to join with it, together generating the twelve thousand things. Of these, two thousand are auspicious and virtuous beings.\n\nThe twelve thousand things each possess their own spirit and have their own rulers. They must follow a single great Way to achieve free flow. The Way of Heaven moves above and below, all going to pay homage to their ruler—just as people following a single great Way go to pay homage to their king. The spirits of the twelve thousand things, born together with Heaven and Earth, emerge along a single great Way, some great, some medium, some small.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that among the twelve thousand things, there are great and small, and their Ways are likewise great and small, each generating, containing, and moving in its own manner. Thus, the upper Way spans ten thousand paces as its measure; the next spans a thousand paces; the next, a hundred paces; the next, ten paces; and the next, one pace. Altogether, five Ways correspond to the five directions. They should together descend to generate upon the earth, together ascend to pay homage to Heaven, and together follow a single Way.\n\nTherefore, the great Way spans ten thousand paces, containing the middle Way of a thousand paces, the small Way of a hundred paces, the fine Way of ten paces, and the minute Way of one pace. Things have their greatness and smallness, each containing their own coming and going. All receive Heaven’s expression above and in turn generate below to express upon the earth, emerging to together ascend and pay homage to Heaven.\n\nThus, the great Way may be extended but must not be recklessly closed, for closing it will prevent mutual containment. Some will fail to be born, or be injured and die, unable to emerge—causing people to be cut off without descendants. The injured injure others; the dead kill others. The sages of antiquity dared not abolish or sever the great Way, for they clearly saw Heaven’s prohibitions.\n\nBy what Way of Heaven can one be harmed? The Way is Heaven, is yang, and governs generation. Virtue is Earth, is yin, and governs nurturance. If many things cannot be born, it is known that the Way of Heaven is harmed. Where there is failure to generate, it is known that Heaven’s continuity has been severed. If one thing fails to be born, one continuity is cut off; many failures mean many cut-offs, few mean few. By the number of things, one knows the harm to Heaven’s continuity.\n\nWhen the Way flourishes, it governs generation, and the myriad things all live. When virtue flourishes, it governs nurturance, and the myriad things and people are all nourished, without grievances. Among the five writings, the virtuous are made to use blue for the base and red for the characters. Why? Our Way is the true record of red and blue. Blue represents life, benevolence, and having a heart; red is the true color of the Great Yang of Heaven. Our Way is the Way of Great Yang, the Way of benevolent governance, desiring no harm.\n\nThe Son of Heaven is the heart of Heaven; the Empress is the heart of Earth. The heart governs and upholds correctness. Heaven covers all without exception, generates all without distinction of great or small—all receive the mandate to live, and thus it is Heaven. Heaven is the true essence of the ultimate Way, never deceiving people. All things should be cherished and loved; their intentions should accumulate sincerity and trust, always desiring to benefit and not harm, never betraying a single thing—thus it is Heaven.\n\nThe emperor and king are the children of Heaven and the leaders of humanity; their conduct should reflect this. The son should receive his father’s teachings, commands, and strict instructions, following them accordingly. Only then will his actions align with his father’s will and intentions, and he may become a good family. If he does not receive his father’s teachings, his family—great and small—will not be governed, and it will become impoverished. Wealth will scatter in all four directions, constantly suffering from inability to gather. Affairs will be chaotic, disasters will arise in succession, and great sorrow will follow—all faults lie here.\n\nWhen the emperors and kings of antiquity were about to act, they first looked up to Heaven, receiving its teachings in their hearts before proceeding.\n\nThe conduct of the empress should rightly mirror that of the earth. The earth bears all without exception, gathering both great and small, encompassing all without distinction of good or evil, nurturing them all. The empress is the child of the earth, the heart of the earth. As the heart worries over all matters, the child should emulate her mother’s conduct—if her actions resemble her mother’s, she is a filial child.\n\nThe correspondence between Heaven and Earth and the empress is like that of echo and sound: if her deviation is slight, the consequences are slight; if great, the consequences are great. Even a hair’s breadth of misalignment will leave mother and child at odds in will and intent. In antiquity, when an empress was about to act, she first contemplated the Earth Deity, embracing all without exception in her nurturance. Nothing was beyond her forbearance, nothing lacked constancy; thus she found peace, aligning her heart with the earth’s.\n\nIf she errs, disasters will arise in succession, punishments will go unchecked, yin will prevail over yang, and the myriad things will fail to flourish—all faults lie here.\n\nWhen these two—emperor and empress—govern rightly, the divine immortals appear, the true Dao emerges, the worthy and wise occupy their rightful places, and all good things gather in the realm.\n\nQi in its primordial state is yang and governs generation. Spontaneous transformation is yin and governs the nurturance of all things. Heaven is yang and governs generation; Earth is yin and governs nurturance. The sun and daylight are yang and govern generation; the moon, stars, and night are yin and govern nurturance. Spring and summer are yang and govern generation; autumn and winter are yin and govern nurturance. The celestial stems *jia*, *bing*, *wu*, *geng*, and *ren* are yang and govern generation; *yi*, *ding*, *ji*, *xin*, and *gui* are yin and govern nurturance. The earthly branches *zi*, *yin*, *chen*, *wu*, *shen*, and *xu* are yang and govern generation; *chou*, *mao*, *si*, *wei*, *you*, and *hai* are yin and govern nurturance. All nines are yang and govern generation; all sixes are yin and govern nurturance. Men are yang and govern generation; women are yin and govern the nurturance of all things. The male is yang and governs generation; the female is yin and governs nurturance. The ruler is yang and governs generation; the minister is yin and governs nurturance.\n\nAll things under Heaven consist of one yin and one yang, only then can they generate and nurture one another. If yang does not bestow generation, yin becomes empty and void, with nothing to nurture. If yin does not receive transformation, yang has nothing to bestow. Generation is governance; when yang qi governs alone, cut off and obstructed, it becomes Heaven’s great resentment. If yin does not receive transformation, failing to generate and bring forth, it becomes a grave fault.\n\nHeaven’s resentment lies in yang’s reluctance to bestow, leaving nothing to generate, instead favoring destruction and harm to life. Earth’s fault lies in yin’s unwillingness to receive transformation, failing to bring forth and nurture growth, thereby faulting others and harming what should be nurtured. Heaven that does not send timely rain is a malevolent and inauspicious Heaven. Earth that does not nurture the myriad things is a malevolent and inauspicious Earth. A man who does not bestow generation severs Heaven’s governance. A woman who does not receive transformation severs Earth’s governance. The Dao of yin and yang, cut off and without posterity, is a great inauspiciousness—like Heaven and Earth suddenly destroyed, never to exist again.\n\nThus the sage values the essential patterns of Heaven. Heaven is the essence of all Dao. The worthy value the Dao, hence they follow the sage. The worthy enter the true Dao, hence they follow the immortal. Those who know how to become immortals must be true, hence they follow the true. Those who know the true must attain the divine. The divine share form and principle with Heaven above, hence Heaven is called divine, for it can command the divine.\n\nThe divine are the officers of August Heaven. The divine person is the foremost heart of August Heaven. The nature of Heaven and Earth is that the pure governs the turbid; the turbid cannot govern the pure. Radiant essence is the heart of the myriad things. Those who govern with clarity use their hearts to discern matters, employing pure brightness.\n\nNow, what do the divine person, true person, immortal, Daoist, sage, worthy, commoner, and servant each resemble?\n\nThe divine person resembles Heaven, which moves and illuminates all without ignorance. The true person resembles Earth, which is upright, utterly sincere, and never deceitful. Heaven merely follows what people sow, never altering it. The immortal resembles the four seasons, which transform all things without fixed form, now flourishing, now declining. The Daoist resembles the five phases, which can divine fortune and misfortune, excelling in discerning safety and danger. The sage resembles yin and yang, which model themselves on Heaven and Earth to govern affairs, harmonizing the myriad things. The sage, too, should harmonize all things, fulfilling Heaven’s will and following yin and yang in action. The worthy resemble mountains and rivers, which convey qi and reach distant lands; the worthy, too, should enable the emperor to connect with the six directions. The common people resemble the myriad things, which grow without regard to high or low, all inhabited by people, hence they resemble the myriad things. Servants arise in degenerate ages, resembling the weak and submissive among grasses and trees, always dwelling in the lower currents, unable to rise. Servants, too, dwell below and cannot rise, hence they resemble grasses and trees.\n\nThus, if a servant is worthy, they may become a good person; if a good person studies diligently, they may become a worthy; if a worthy studies without cease, they may approach the sage; if a sage studies without cease, knowing the gateways of Heaven’s Dao, and enters the Dao without ceasing, they may accomplish the work of immortality and become an immortal. If an immortal does not cease in entering the true, they may become a true person; if a true person does not cease in entering the divine, they may become divine; if the divine do not cease, they may share form with August Heaven.\n\nThus the supreme divine person dwells in the Purple Palace of the North Pole, sharing form with the Heavenly Thearch, named the Heart-Mind Spirit of Heaven. If the divine do not cease, they may ascend beyond Heaven, receiving and transmitting qi, possessing voice yet no form, belonging to the realm above Heaven, attending to its affairs.\n\nThose from the divine person downward all attend to matters within the six directions of Heaven and Earth, harmonizing all to prevent suffering.\n\nI wish to hear: among the vast and boundless six directions between Heaven and Earth, what is most excellent? Among the thirty-six thousand realms between Heaven and Earth, longevity is the greatest excellence.\n\nThus, Heaven is foremost, Earth follows, then the divine person, the perfected person, the immortal, the Daoist, the sage, and the worthy. These eight all harmonize with the Heart-Mind of August Heaven, sharing its will and joining its power—all are Heavenly persons.\n\nHeaven desires governance, and within its domain, each is appointed to their office. Thus, their thoughts and concerns ever align, for these are the people Heaven cherishes and nurtures. Heaven, in its greatness, covets longevity and eternal life. Immortals, too, covet longevity and life; those who covet life dare not transgress, each calculating for their own preservation.\n\nHeaven’s laws manifest in celestial signs, which the sages of antiquity constantly emulated, never daring to deviate. Thus, they suppressed misfortune, severed cunning, and prevented treacherous ministers from acting—all by adhering to Heaven’s laws. To ensure yang qi daily flourishes, fire blazes brightly, and knows no decline, one must swiftly sever the dominance of metal qi and prevent its ascendancy. When metal qi is cut off, wood qi reigns, fire qi blazes brightly, and knows no decline.\n\nWhat does this mean? The Heavenly Lord must abolish warfare. Warfare belongs to the class of metal; thus, it must be swiftly abolished. When emperors and kings bestow weapons upon feudal lords, they empower metal qi. When metal qi reigns, wood declines; when wood declines, fire dims; when fire dims, the omen of war arises. Fire symbolizes the ruler, capable of transforming the four seasons. Mars, as the harbinger of change, most faithfully reflects Heaven’s laws, not erring by even a fraction.\n\nWhen the ruler governs his household, he should focus on cultivating the fields and managing livelihoods. Upon encountering these four circumstances, if he does not bestow benevolence and favor upon the people, leaving the common folk with no recourse against litigation and theft, what is to be done? When encountering the worthy, bestow upon them culture; the hungry, food; the cold, clothing.\n\nWhy bestow culture upon the worthy? Culture arises in the East and shines in the South. Thus, celestial patterns originate in the Northeast, and writing emerges from the Northeast’s symbolism. The tiger bears its markings in the *yin* position, the dragon in the *chen* position, ascending to Heaven. *Li* represents culture in the South; thus, the Three Luminaries embody culture. The sun rises in the East and reaches its zenith in the South. Heaven commands emperors and kings to model themselves upon these patterns.\n\nHeaven has Three Sovereigns, Earth has Three Sovereigns, and humanity has Three Sovereigns. Heaven has Five Emperors, Earth has Five Emperors, and humanity has Five Emperors. Heaven has Three Kings, Earth has Three Kings, and humanity has Three Kings. Heaven has Five Hegemons, Earth has Five Hegemons, and humanity has Five Hegemons.\n\nWhat does this mean? Heaven’s Three Sovereigns correspond to the Three Luminaries; Earth’s Three Sovereigns correspond to highlands, plains, and fields; humanity’s Three Sovereigns correspond to ruler, minister, and people. Heaven’s Five Emperors correspond to the Five Stars; Earth’s Five Emperors correspond to the Five Peaks; humanity’s Five Emperors correspond to the five viscera. Heaven’s Three Kings refer to the Three Luminaries, and its Five Hegemons to the Five Peaks—aligning with humanity and Earth.\n\nAmong Heaven’s Three Sovereigns, the most excellent is the sun, the middling the moon, and the lesser the stars. Among Earth’s Three Sovereigns, the most excellent are the Five Peaks, the middling the level lands, and the lesser the fields. Among humanity’s Three Sovereigns, the most excellent is the ruler, the middling the minister, and the lesser the people.\n\nAll people bear six great sins that cannot be absolved—some incur punishment in their own bodies, while others pass it to later generations. Yet, though one accumulates boundless Dao, if they refuse to teach others to seek life, their sin remains. Though one accumulates boundless virtue, if they refuse to teach others to guard virtue and nurture their nature with care, their sin remains. Though one amasses wealth by the millions, if they refuse to relieve the poor and aid the distressed, allowing people to die of hunger and cold, their sin remains. Though one knows the Dao, if they scorn it and refuse to study diligently to save themselves—or, having attained longevity within the celestial lineage of their ancestors, they instead treat it lightly and do not study, thus dying in vain—their sin remains. Though Heaven endows people with strength so they may clothe and feed themselves, if they refuse to labor and instead suffer hunger and cold, squandering their ancestors’ legacy and idling away their strength, their sin remains. If one forcibly seizes others’ property, making harmony their enemy, their sin remains. These are the six great sins. Heaven abhors them and they cannot be absolved.\n\nAs my departure approaches, I leave this one admonition to the six disciples: The Dao is vast, without above or below, without exterior or interior. Guard its harmonious qi, and you are a subject and child. Seek it near, and you grasp the great; seek it far, and you lose it. Thus, the ruler who excels in governance begins with the stirring within his own belly—truly contemplating the Dao, principle naturally unfolds. Near, it resides in the heart and chest; far, it pervades the Four Seas.\n\nThe ancients called this the essential Dao. When the sages of antiquity instructed emperors and kings, they deeply pondered and planned, closing their nine apertures, resting their four limbs, entering a state of primordial chaos—like a ring without end, like a child in the womb without duties—only then could they grasp its principle. My Dao takes this as its great essential, and Heaven treasures its transmission.\n\n*Excerpts from the Tai Ping Jing, Ding Section, Scroll Four (conclusion)*\n*Tai Ping Jing, Wu Section, Scroll Five*\n\nAligning the celestial omens with the stems and branches, the state of Chang’an is governed thereby. What you inquire is the profound connection between Heaven and Earth, the omen-texts that, once spoken, cannot be altered for ten thousand generations.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord suffers from frequent disasters and sorrows. August Heaven takes the four seasons as its limbs, Earth takes the five phases as its body. The limbs govern flourishing and decline, the body governs compass and square. These nine spirits flow together throughout the world, penetrating above and below, their transformations difficult to perceive. They are the world’s greatest treasures, the gates of all things, possessing inherent constancy. One must not recklessly transgress them: those who follow them enjoy enduring fortune; those who disrupt them bring discord between Heaven and Earth.\n\nHeaven’s constant omen-law establishes the South as the ruler’s domain. The sun in the South is the ruler, fire in the South is the ruler, the Great Yang in the South is the ruler, the height of summer in the South is the ruler, the hearth among the Five Offerings in the South is the ruler, and the heart among the five viscera in the South is the ruler.\n\nThe ruler should wear red garments, for this aligns with the phase of fire. When the ruler encounters anomalies, they invariably correspond with yang, never with earth. The sun, being the brightest, leads all luminaries, so Heaven constantly uses the sun to divine the ruler’s virtue in its flourishing or decline.\n\nThe model for a ruler is to seek kinship with the benevolent, govern with those who possess a heart, and together with those who govern, always practice the Dao and cherish life. Thus, the East cherishes life, the South cherishes nurturance. Those without benevolence cannot govern together; those without clarity cannot be rulers or leaders. The East, associated with wood, embodies benevolence; the South, associated with fire, embodies clarity. The East governs the Dao, the South governs virtue; the Dao governs life, virtue governs nurturance. The East represents culture, where the dragon appears bearing it. The South represents refinement, hence it is the essence of culture and refinement.\n\nThe East is where lesser yang begins to arise, thus it emerges from the East. The South, as the great yang, embodies the ruler’s flourishing virtue, its brilliance illuminating the lesser yang’s domain—wood gives birth to fire. Lesser yin serves as minister, submitting in righteousness to the great yang. Thus, metal yields to fire, bending and breaking as desired; ministers must likewise submit in righteousness to assist the ruler’s desires. Hence, lesser yin is the minister. Great yin is the people, who flow ceaselessly like water. The people are tasked with governing life for the state and its lords.\n\nThus, water nurtures wood, and wood is the ruler’s domain. Heaven’s omen-law dictates that lesser yang fears lesser yin. Therefore, ministers, in reversing their roles, record the affairs of the state, its lords, and officials. Great yang fears great yin: when a state possesses virtue and its ruler and ministers are wise, the people follow; when a state lacks virtue, the people rebel. Thus, the foundation of governance lies in the people’s abundance, for many people bring wealth, few bring poverty.\n\nHeaven’s omen-law divides into six parts. The southeast and above belong to Heaven, where all things ascend, creatures move, and people venture outward—all under Heaven’s domain. Thus, Heaven’s color is outwardly blue-green like wood, inwardly red like fire. The northwest belongs to Earth, where all things fall in autumn and winter, returning to soil, and people, like creatures, retreat into burrows by autumn and winter. Thus, Earth’s color is outwardly yellow-white like soil and metal, inwardly containing the black of water, symbolizing its northern movement.\n\nThe East and South hold honored positions, belonging to Heaven above and governing as rulers, teachers, and fathers. The northwest, belonging to Earth below, serves as ministers, the rear palace, and the people. The people are the rear palace of *jia*. *Jia* is Heaven, the fundamental position of kings, thus it is the Heart Star. The Heart Star is fire, belonging to the South. *Bing* is the chief of fire, chosen for its great brilliance—it is the ruler’s position. *Xin* is the rear palace of *bing*, and *jia* is the father of *bing*. Thus, *ji* is the palace of the great empress. *Xin* pairs with *bing*, and *bing* is the son of *jia*. Hence, *xin* is the palace of the lesser empress. *Bing* is the rightful son of *jia*, the ruler who receives the mandate.\n\n*Geng* belongs to *yi*, the husband of the state’s feudal lords. *Ren* belongs to *ding*, the husband of the emperor’s younger sister. *Gui* belongs to *wu*, the in-laws of the state’s great empress. The ten celestial stems each have their affiliations, while Earth governs the twelve earthly branches—how is this so? Heaven’s law dictates that though yin and yang circulate, those that pair each have their own domains. Heaven’s law differs: it does not allow entire households to follow and remain together. *Jia* takes *yin* as its domain, *yi* takes *mao*, *bing* takes *wu*, *ding* takes *si*, *wu* takes *chen*, *ji* takes *wei*, *geng* takes *shen*, *xin* takes *you*, *ren* takes *zi*, and *gui* takes *chou*. Thus, the Dao of Heaven moves in reverse to govern, while the Dao of Earth remains still. Hence, there is division of land but no division of people.\n\nNow, a state exists, so Heaven and Earth do not shift. Heaven completes one revolution in a day and night, its movement constant. Thus, the twelve branches each have their place and do not follow the stems in rotation. Wine is the sovereign of water, and water’s sovereignty should overcome fire. Fire is the ruler’s virtue; swiftly banish wine to preserve the fire’s power.\n\nMy Daoist method proceeds by regulating yang when going forth and regulating yin when entering; by regulating conduct when going forth and regulating spirit when entering; by regulating all texts when going forth and regulating all diagrams when entering; by dispelling disasters when going forth and rectifying the self when entering; by regulating the court’s learning when going forth and regulating the inner chamber when entering. In all matters, establish limits. Those who strive diligently in learning should each employ their talents, lest they lose the constant method. External learning, when pursued excessively, leads to superficiality, and one cannot restrain oneself. Internal learning, if not aligned with the correct path, veers into great error. Many scholars suffer from grave maladies yet remain unaware.\n\nThose who favor external learning and possess great talent often fall into superficiality, causing the Dao to become greatly distorted and lose its true principles. They falsely claim it as the authentic Dao, deceiving one another in peril. Those who overindulge in internal learning often plunge into great error, believing they have attained it. Ancient and modern texts abound beyond measure. In learning, grasp the true essence and do not deviate from its root. For those who learn from a master’s oral instructions, do not violate their master’s words—this is the great essential.\n\nThe greatest harm in learning lies in aligning with external chapters and verses, which leads to superficiality, excessive ornamentation, and reckless speech. Those who delve into internal texts that align with diagrams and omens fail to deeply grasp their essential meaning and instead speak in error. In all matters governed by Heaven’s discourse, only when ten correspond with ten is it correct. When nine correspond, it is slightly erroneous; when eight correspond, it is slightly chaotic. Below this, it is unusable. Such misnomers disrupt celestial patterns, displease yin and yang, cause all things to contend, and bring great calamity upon the people.\n\nThe method of nurturing life lies in inwardly perceiving one’s form and countenance clearly—this is the way.\n\nExternally perceiving the myriad things and their multitudinous essences—this is incorrect.\n\nIn all matters, one must constantly uphold the original text and seek the explanations of many worthies to stabilize it—this is correct. To amass numerous literary chapters and verses while forgetting the fundamental matter—this is incorrect.\n\nThe Celestial Master emerged with the qi of Great Peace, receiving the Dao and its virtue to revive the Supreme Sovereign. Favoring rulers who cherish the Dao, his thoughts extended downward even to the foolish and humble, penetrating the Six Directions and uniting with the Eight Extremities, encompassing all without exception.\n\nThe Dao is distinguished by nine degrees:\n1. **Primordial Qi and Non-Action**: To think of the body as doing nothing, only contemplating its luminous purity, as if relinquishing qi and formless—this is the method.\n2. **Serene Emptiness and Spontaneity**: To guard the form and embrace emptiness, naturally devoid of strangeness, with the body’s interior radiant and unobstructed like a king.\n3. **Numerical Measures**: To accumulate essence and inwardly observe, counting from the hair down to the feet, distinguishing the five fingers, and enumerating every aspect of form and countenance, internal and external. Knowing its meaning and constantly dwelling on it without losing even a fraction—this is the lesser art of measurement.\n4. **Spiritual Travel and Return**: To contemplate the spirits of the five viscera as they journey forth by day and return, witnessing their movements, conversing with them, and discerning good and ill fortune—this is the next degree.\n5. **The Great Dao’s Spirits**: When the human spirit departs, it aligns with the four seasons and five phases, sharing the hues of green, red, yellow, and black with the visceral spirits. The spirits and officials of the five phases serve humanity, capable of subduing all malevolent forces.\n6. **Stabbing Joy**: To stab the earth, inducing cleverness in people—this must not be employed frequently.\n7. **Community Counsel**: The spirits of heaven and earth, the four seasons, altars of soil and grain, mountains and rivers, and sacrificial rites—these must not be treated recklessly.\n8. **Vast Spirits**: These spirits are boundless, their Dao unattached; when the world’s refined qi descends, they cause people to speak recklessly, half resembling truth and half resembling deception.\n9. **Ancestral Spirits**: These are purely apparitions of ghosts, devoid of true Dao.\n\nThe celestial spirits possess their own divine treasures, their radiant essence following the five phases in color and the four seasons’ qi in rise and decline, serving heaven, earth, the people, and the myriad things.\n\nBetween heaven and earth, at the juncture of yin and yang, none are untouched by the transformative power of virtue and born thereby. To uphold the Dao, accumulate goodness, and thoroughly harmonize with the spirits and qi of heaven and earth, the people, crawling creatures, the myriad things, and the qi of the four seasons and five phases—constantly interacting with them—is to know none who are not virtuous.\n\n**First Rank: Great Compassion and Filial Piety**\nCompassion and filial piety arise from inner reflection, thoughts emerging from the storehouse of the viscera, attainable without study—this is the art of spontaneity. Conduct aligns with the heart of heaven, intent harmonizes with earth. Above, it benefits the emperor and king; below, it leads the people to prosperity, fostering harmonious qi and serving as the foremost model for humanity. Its practice is as vivid as cinnabar and ink—thus, it is ranked first.\n\n**Second Rank: Illuminating the Dao and Great Gentleness**\nTo clarify the Dao and its virtue, leading the hundred clans, studying and cherishing the Dao, amassing virtue, and preventing theft and banditry—this benefits the emperor’s transformative governance, embodying the truest auspiciousness.\n\n**Third Rank: Filial Piety, Fraternal Respect, and the Beginning of Virtuous Transformation**\nThose who begin to learn and desire goodness harbor hope in their hearts, turning from depravity toward rectitude, though their benevolent conduct has yet to fully transform.\n\n**Fourth Rank: The Diligent Farmer’s Son**\nThe diligent farmer’s son rises at dawn and rests at dusk, unafraid of toil, accumulating day by day. His household thrives, sustaining his parents, securing the earth’s bounty, and following heaven’s Dao. He dares not act wrongly and benefits the county’s governance.\n\n**Fifth Rank: The Greatly Unbenevolent Son and Lawless Youth**\nThe lawless, the unbenevolent sons—those who reject principle, curse heaven, strike the earth, and neglect their parents—inevitably wield weapons, terrorizing their villages. These frivolous youths disrupt heaven and earth’s transformative work, becoming grave harms. They must be captured through concerted effort, discarded into ditches, and denied burial.\n\n**Sixth Rank: Discord at Home, Deceiving the Elderly and Favoring the Young, Sharing Food but Hoarding Wealth**\nSuch households are doomed to ruin. Kin turn against one another, unable to instruct, recklessly spreading rumors and evading responsibility. Abandoning roots for branches, their calamity is irredeemable.\n\n**Seventh Rank: Repenting Wrongdoing and Abandoning Weapons**\nBorn in destitute villages, rarely witnessing or hearing of goodness, ignorant of right and wrong, their conduct offends heaven. Yet, thanks to a sagacious ruler, they are guided toward goodness. Though unlearned in youth, they repent in maturity. Let the virtuous and worthy, with pillars five feet high, swiftly expel them from the ranks. Those who study should examine this: one day, all the people may become good.\n\n**Eighth Rank: Repenting Wrongdoing and Returning to Goodness**\nThose whose studies fail and whose misfortunes multiply may yet, by the grace of a sagacious ruler who understands their plight, be allowed to repent and even become teachers of others.\n\n**Ninth Rank: The Greatly Wicked, Deceitful, Greedy, and Corrupt**\nThese corpse-like officials, wicked and avaricious, deceive their superiors and harm their subordinates. Great flatterers, they bear human form but possess the hearts of ravenous beasts. They bring no benefit to heaven, earth, yin, or yang, and their deep-seated disasters warrant execution and annihilation.\n\n**Tenth Rank: Correcting Wrongs and Returning to Rectitude**\nTo repent, reform conduct, and change one’s heart—though lacking goodness in youth and suffering repeated calamities—is to amend faults by evening if committed by morning, thereby earning the name of a good person.\n\nThese ten ranks are the methods of the ancient sages and worthies, delighting in people’s goodness and preventing mutual harm. Their aim is to allow each to complete their natural lifespan, return to the Dao, and sever the roots of misfortune, thereby witnessing the qi of Great Peace.\n\nThe divine all operate by established norms, their roots in the Great Correlation. The Great Correlation strikes the emperors and kings, thereby rectifying the movements of heaven. Its secondary root strikes the empresses and queens, thereby harmonizing the patterns of earth. Its middle root strikes the multitude of sages, thereby governing yin and yang. Its fine and subtle roots connect to the common people, thereby governing the myriad things. The great person who acts accordingly attains greatness; the middling person, middling results; the petty person, small gains—yet all may attain correctness.\n\nWhen emperors and kings practice the Dao and virtue, their flourishing is vast and luminous; with little virtue, their light is dim. When empresses and queens practice the Dao and virtue, the moon shines with great brilliance; with little virtue, its light is faint. When the multitude of worthies practice the Dao and virtue, the stars and celestial cycles blaze with radiance; with little virtue, their glow is weak. When all four roots practice the Dao and virtue together, the world is at peace, auspicious signs appear, and great light extends far. Gazing afar at the celestial signs, wind and rain arrive in their proper seasons, the barbarians submit in sincerity, and disasters and harms dissolve of themselves.\n\nNow, having received the Celestial Master’s writings on the Dao and virtue, they are entrusted to the reverent people, so that the reverent may return to a ruler of great benevolence and virtue, thereby pacifying the governance of the world and securing long-lasting peace for the self. The emperor is the first noble son of the August Heaven above; the empress is the first noble daughter of the Earth below. These most divine and sagely noble persons, by their office, ought to dwell within the hundredfold layers of the cosmos, yet instead they take on the cares of the world beyond ten thousand *li*, receiving the mandate of heaven to govern yin and yang, the six directions, and the eight quarters, upholding the supreme positions of heaven and earth. Entrusted by the divine spirits, they penetrate the utmost heights and depths, and all creatures that creep and crawl turn their hearts toward them.\n\nThus, they compose the *Wushang Lingbao Petition*, able to comprehend the will of heaven and illuminate the names of the officials versed in the stars and celestial cycles. As Grand Astrologers, they must not fail in their duties, alternating day and night to observe and await the flourishing or decline of celestial *qi*, the gains or losses of the Three Luminaries, rejoicing in receiving heaven’s commands and admonitions to secure their own peace. In the eleventh month, they cultivate the Yellow Bell, guiding the *qi* of the earth below to ascend and communicate, rejoicing in harmonizing with the intent of the Earth Queen to secure their own peace.\n\nThey construct the Hall of Light in the land of *bingwu* under the Great Yang, opening eight windows and four thoroughfares to delight in the free flow of the *qi* of the eight directions and four seasons, desiring to align with the auspiciousness of the eight winds and four seasons to secure their own peace. They open the four gates, rejoicing in receiving the world’s rare texts, extraordinary strategies, seldom-seen treasures, and the wise and wondrous arts that can bring long-lasting peace to the world and dispel calamities and anomalies.\n\nIn ancient times, the sages on the throne constantly sought out reclusive worthies and the meekly virtuous to share in governance. They wished to hear of the four seasons’ honored nobility, yet the kingly *qi* is the chief of the formless *qi*, the one to which all other *qi* strike and submit—these are the honored noble rulers. The kingly *qi* is heaven, the August One, the Emperor, the King, the Grand Year-Star, the Monthly Establishment, the Dipper’s Ridge, the Azure Dragon, the Great Virtue, the Flourishing Prosperity, the Emperor-King, the Supreme King, the Lord of Generation and Completion.\n\nThus, wherever the kingly *qi* resides, the myriad things submit to its rule; where it dwells, all things live and thrive as kings; where it turns away, all perish—this is due to the primordial *qi*. Therefore, when the kingly *qi* resides in yang, yang prevails; when it dwells in yin, yin prevails; when it resides in heaven, heaven prevails; when it dwells in earth, earth prevails. Wherever the kingly *qi* resides, all becomes kingly, receiving the mandate to govern and order.\n\nThus, the ancient sage-kings faced east in spring, south in summer, west in autumn, and north in winter, with the sixth month at the center. When the *qi* completes its circuit, they presented themselves to heaven, for the kingly *qi* is most honored in heaven. The month’s establishment is called \"Breaking and Great Expenditure\"; when the emperor’s *qi* clashes with it, it is named \"Death and Extinction.\" The primordial *qi* establishes the positions, and the emperor’s *qi* is the first *qi*, majestic and not to be rashly opposed.\n\nThe position after the monthly establishment is called \"Closure.\" Closure is when heaven seals off the yin *qi* of rest that follows, fearing that it may advance to become treacherous and crafty, encroaching upon the emperor’s established *qi*—thus, it is closed off behind. Opening is heaven’s law, which delights in no harm or injury. Therefore, opening what follows demonstrates the teaching of restful *qi*, for if there are those who act treacherously, it delights in opening the way for them to retreat. If they do not retreat, they will be seized; once seized, they will be interrogated, and guilt will be established. Once guilt is established, it cannot be removed, and death or peril follows.\n\nThus, the fifth position after is \"Peril,\" which brings one near death. The sixth position after is \"Breaking,\" where the Dipper’s handle breaks and death ensues—thus, the *Kui* star governs death, leading to peril. Therefore, the emperor’s *qi* arises from Lesser Yang and Greater Yang, ever guarding the establishment of the Dipper. The *qi* of death arises from Lesser Yin and Greater Yin, ever guarding the *Kui* of the Dipper.\n\nThus, the six positions following are where heaven constantly rests and empties, aligning with earth’s *qi* to govern closure, concealing treachery and villainy, dwelling together with evil spirits and beings—these must not be rashly opened or revealed. The ancients had worthies who cherished life, and all *qi* belonged to the front of the Dipper, moving in parallel with the celestial motions—thus, the days were auspicious and full of *qi*. All who are treacherous, crafty, yin-assassins, or evil and perverse resemble yin *qi* and belong to the rear of the Dipper—thus, the days are in decline, and their actions are inauspicious.\n\nThe primordial *qi* is vague and indistinct, naturally coalescing into one, called heaven. Dividing, it generates yin and forms earth, called the second. Thus, above is heaven and below is earth; yin and yang unite to generate humanity, called the third. The three powers together generate and nurture all things, called wealth. Wealth generates desire; desire generates perversity; perversity generates treachery; treachery generates craftiness; craftiness generates harm without end—then chaos and ruin follow. If ruin does not cease, it cannot be governed again, and thus it reaches its limit and returns to its root—this is called \"inherited burden.\"\n\nThe Way of heaven is without intent: when it encounters the unworthy, chaos ensues; when it obtains the wise and enlightened, order is restored. In ancient times, when emperors and kings obtained the wise and enlightened, the Dao flourished. They dared not take the foolish and unworthy as close advisors. Swiftly transmit this text to a ruler of supreme virtue. Those who practice it with penetrating clarity will shine, and the three *qi* will appear and inquire of one another.\n\nThose who divine with ten successes in ten are thorough in governance—this is the foremost clarity, fit for service to emperors and kings. Those who divine with nine successes in ten, with one *qi* disordered and ungoverned, may serve as feudal lords. Those who divine with eight successes in ten, with two *qi* disordered and ungoverned, may serve as common folk. Beyond this, it is called \"disordering heaven’s upright Dao,\" and grievances will bind the spirits and numinous essences, lurking in concealment where governance cannot reach, unable to harmonize the *qi* of Great Peace.\n\nIf you seek the Dao, ponder the written texts; the method of seeking the Dao takes stillness as its root. Accumulate essence without cease, and it becomes the gateway to spirit. The five virtues harmonize and unite, revealing the hun and po souls. When the heart-spirit is illuminated, the great Dao unfolds. First discern safety and peril, observe the four neighbors. The host of spirits gathers like clouds; if this practice does not cease, you shall be a long-lived lord. The great Dao does not require toil—your form like dead ashes, guarding the hun-spirit. If the hun-spirit does not depart, you shall long endure. The cycle returns to its beginning, endless as a ring. To abandon the root and seek the branches brings trouble to the Dao; the multitude loses it and cannot be whole. Reflect on its meaning, do not lose the true words. Purity and stillness are the foundation, not the use of wealth. How can you not cherish the words of an enlightened teacher? Follow the teacher’s instructions, and you shall not die.\n\nThe foolish rebel against their teacher and dwell near ghosts; they do not attain the upright Dao but enter the gate of misfortune. They depart and do not return to spirit; their bones and flesh rot in the mire, called ancestors only in name. Their fate is extinguished, their ruin complete.\n\nThe arts of the common and foolish all arise from within, possessing their own laws, with depth as their root. When they encounter the spirit, they live, free from suffering and sorrow. The spirit detests strife and turmoil—calm the heart, settle the mind, and beware of sudden violence. With prolonged stillness, the myriad Dao emerge. Long endure without death, and you shall match heaven’s completion.\n\nTo practice this, you must harmonize and become one with the Dao. The worthy hold fast without wavering, and all matters are fulfilled. Cast aside worldly thoughts, unite with the spirit, ride clouds and mount dragons, sharing a chamber with the Thunder Duke. Your body transforms into spirit, your form like the Great One.\n\nPonder these written words carefully; be vigilant not to lose discipline.\n\nThe Dao of focused contemplation is perfected in seclusion. Do not seek honor or rank; let your resolve grow daily more refined. Open the obscured to radiant clarity, like the brightness of day. When you do not study, it is as if gazing into blackest night—east, west, south, north, lost within your chamber. The worthy and sagely tremble, their hearts alone quaking with fear.\n\nIf you firmly uphold the five precepts, you shall not die. Content with poverty, delighting in lowliness, you may endure long. To scorn lowliness and seek nobility obstructs the Dao. Covet no high office or heavy emolument; to forcibly pursue rank is to lose the Dao. Better to lie abed in long repose.\n\nWithout eating, you become luminous; the hundred evils depart, and calamity flees afar. Guard stillness without cease, and you shall not perish. With good fortune, you may live long and walk far, never daring to indulge or lose constancy. Seek without cease, and you shall be a king of the Dao. The arts of nurturing life differ in method; they do not hinder the people’s affairs.\n\nWhen those above cherish life, the people’s lives are long. The worldly teachings place the Dao above, with benevolent kings. The sagely lord ponders the Dao, and its transformative influence flows downward, making the people pure and incorrupt. They shall know no calamity forever.\n\nIf the people do not die, it is due to the clarity of those above. When the ruler above lacks clarity, teachings go unheeded. Refusing the Dao, they instead favor warfare. Every household has a wicked son, and families perish. Wielding weapons, they waylay travelers by the roadside, seizing their goods in moments of vulnerability. The magistrates are not at peace, and bandits roam. Observe the people, and you may know whether those above are enlightened.\n\nWhen the lord cherishes benevolence, those below seek long life. When those above lack benevolence, those below incline toward perversity, all meeting early death, knowing no joy in life.\n\nWhen the foolish below cherish virtue, it is due to the ruler’s teachings. When the people cherish the Dao, their lord is enlightened. They all desire long life and to distance themselves from calamity, rejecting corruption and laying down weapons. They fold their hands and do nothing, casting aside misfortune. The sagely lord greatly prospers, and the people grow close. His kindness extends even to the foolish below—this is the mark of a true king. The Dao of heaven cherishes life to secure those above. When the foolish below do not contend, it is the blessing of those above. The world is most fortunate, and none do not turn toward the king.\n\nWhen the people do not cherish the Dao, it is due to the obscurity of those above. Harboring treachery within, they outwardly display virtue, yet do not practice it, favoring warfare instead. Fathers and sons are separated, dwelling by the roadside. They cannot attain long life, and deaths accumulate. Households have impoverished sons like tigers and wolves. Those above lack virtue, and the calamity of war follows. The foolish below have a ruler whose transformative influence does not flow; the people’s many inclinations toward immortality reflect the emperor’s clarity. Heaven sees his governance, and kindness flows downward. Even the crawling and panting creatures are bathed in his light.\n\nHeaven cherishes life and the Dao, thus it is called the \"Heavenly Canon.\" Those who accumulate virtue are the \"Earthly Canon.\" Earth cherishes nurturance, thus it is called the \"Earthly Canon.\" Those who accumulate harmony and delight in giving are the \"Human Canon.\" Harmonious *qi* flows and circulates; people possess wealth and circulate it, giving and receiving. Thus harmony is the \"Human Canon.\"\n\nIn ancient times, those who sought learning all rectified their roots. It is like planting a tree: seek a good seed and place it in good soil, and its growth—root, trunk, branches, and leaves—shall all be good. The root is the master; the branches and fruit are the disciples. Thus, in ancient learning, all first reflected on the root before studying the Dao. Therefore, those who could practice it harmonized with the heart of heaven, and so it was auspicious.\n\nIf one plants a tree without choosing a good one, placing it in poor soil, how can its branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit be beautiful? This begins with aligning the body and rectifying the nature, directing the intent of the Dao to return to primordial *qi*, thereby settling the body. Reflect on the duties and practices of the ancient masters—how can one govern oneself? Plan with a settled mind, and you shall attain it yourself. First settle the body, then begin the practice, like an infant at play, without straining sinews or strength, using only good intent.\n\nPonder how the ancients alone attained longevity—through singular focus, how did they achieve it? Only by the utmost Dao, restraining perversity and removing treachery, like a spirit. Without strange occurrences, the root is rectified, and thus one gains heaven’s heart, does not betray earth’s intent, completes the four seasons, harmonizes the five phases. Descendants do not inherit burdens from one another; each embraces utmost virtue, no longer knowing perversity or evil.\n\nEntering the chamber alone, one contemplates the fundamental needs of the scriptures and the Dao—what must be brought forth and what must be let go. The worthy first grasp its meaning, and those who follow after attain it as well, thus together entering the Dao, far removed from perversity.\n\nSecluded in the chamber, one reflects and preserves, the five officials shifting in turn, aligning with the cycles of yin and yang—meng, zhong, and ji as brothers—moving in response to *qi*, in accord with the four seasons and the five phases. The transformations of heaven’s Dao become the constant norm.\n\nTo lose *qi* is to die; to possess *qi* is to live. All things follow this, and the human Dao stands supreme. Thus, the five officials arise in accordance with *qi*, and heaven’s Dao soars as the supreme power through *qi*.\n\nThe perfected person accumulates *qi* and gathers spirit illumination; thus, the Dao alone endures in its constant course, while the myriad people, losing *qi*, perish. The dead are base; the living are noble.\n\nIf you guard the Dao, you may long endure, transforming with *qi* as heaven does in its constancy. Do not hasten after fame and profit, and the Dao will proceed of itself. Heaven’s Dao constantly generates without loss; earth’s Dao sustains duality, presiding over death.\n\nThe sages and worthies of highest antiquity—those of superior attainment retired to the mountains, while lesser scholars perished like insects among the common folk.\n\nThe worthy, upon seeing these writings, ponder deeply upon these words, first embracing difficulty and then ease, thus keeping the body free from harm. By guarding virtue, one completes the great Dao in the body. After studying and passing through the nine chambers, one becomes a spirit person, whose thoughts are ever distinct from those of ordinary people, never ceasing day or night to contemplate earthly matters, but desiring to hear of heavenly affairs.\n\nThe mind then contemplates the duties of heaven above, and only afterward descends through the nine chambers, accumulating essence with utmost sincerity, naturally transforming and altering one’s form. This is the sage of the highest heavens, who no longer concerns himself with the affairs of the common world—this is clear.\n\nMy writings enable the lofty scholar to attain life without hindrance, while the lesser scholar is prevented from reckless actions and false words. My writings on the Dao exhaust the aspirations of humanity, allowing the worthy and the unworthy each to fulfill their capacities, so that even at death, there is nothing left to regret—each has fulfilled their heavenly mandate.\n\nThose who desire longevity and lasting joy should contemplate and follow the true intent of the Dao. Those who do not seek lasting joy should attend to worldly affairs, content merely to preserve their bodies.\n\nExamine your conduct and reflect upon yourself to know the methods of gain and loss. The wise and enlightened encompass heaven and earth, accumulating boundless scriptures, yet if they cannot prolong their lives and enhance their destiny, this is called emptiness, a Dao without substance.\n\nThe masters of esoteric arts, though they may study for a long time and exhaust themselves, though they may master the patterns of heaven and earth, comprehend the nature of all things, and amass a complete collection of texts, if they cannot serve their parents and honor their ruler, such knowledge is of no benefit.\n\nPonder deeply upon these words, and good and ill fortune may be known. By practicing this simplicity, one comes to understand gain and loss for oneself.\n\nWhat in learning is most urgent? Thus, I set forth these two matters, clearly distinguishing the signs of a scholar’s loss and gain.\n\nSince the closing of the age, there have been two urgent concerns; the rest may be known or not, as one wishes. What heaven, earth, and the sagely and enlightened deem most pressing to promote and greatly attain are longevity and filial piety.\n\nLongevity is to share the same excellence as heaven and earth. Filial piety is to share the same power as heaven and earth. Thus, longevity is long life, sharing the same essence as heaven; filial piety is to submit below and comply with those above, sharing the same resonance as earth. These two matters accord with the intent of heaven and earth, and misfortune naturally departs.\n\nPonder deeply upon this intent—it is the principle of Great Peace, the essential key to long life. Yet those who desire to do good and seek to live are few.\n\nParents are the root of life. The ruler is the gateway to honor and esteem. The teacher is the source of wisdom, the inexhaustible vocation. These three are the gateways of virtue and the Dao.\n\nParents transmit the ancestral lineage of heaven and earth’s yin and yang. The teacher understands the intent of heaven and earth, resolving the knots of worldly affairs. The ruler, bearing the mandate of heaven and earth, complies with yin and yang, ever striving to grasp their intent, taking the governance of the Dao as his duty. Thus, these three are the gateways of nature and destiny.\n\nPonder deeply upon these words, and the myriad harms will be dispelled. Longevity and filial piety are what the divine spirits love. Those who lack longevity and filial piety are the targets of a hundred calamities.\n\nThis Dao is natural and requires no effort. To know its efficacy, observe how it constantly follows the good and evil of human intent. The mind’s intentions scheme within, and echoes respond without. To know this Dao, observe the correspondence of reflection and echo.\n\nThe mind and intent are the gateways of good and ill fortune. The rulers of Great Peace in antiquity governed by ensuring their minds and intentions were good, and thus their ministers were good. If their intentions were misguided, their ministers followed suit.\n\nMind and intent are the pivot and trigger of heaven and earth; they must not be recklessly disturbed, lest harmonious *qi* be thrown into chaos and disasters arise daily.\n\n*Excerpt from the Fifth Scroll of the Abridged* Classic of Great Peace*, Wu Section*\n*Excerpt from the Sixth Scroll of the Abridged* Classic of Great Peace*, Ji Section*\n\nNow throughout the realm, mouths are sealed in fear, daring not to speak recklessly. Even the sun, moon, and stars in their celestial courses—intimate spirits of heaven’s constellations—stand in mutual awe. Thus when the sun rises, the stars flee and hide, not daring to appear, for they fear its majesty. Within the four borders, where a stern emperor reigns, heaven trembles and the earth quakes; though the capital may lie at a great distance, none dare speak in defiance of his edicts. If a province has a powerful governor, the entire province dares not speak. If a commandery has a formidable magistrate, the whole commandery dares not speak. If a county has a harsh magistrate, the entire county dares not speak. If a village post has a stern warden, even that single post’s jurisdiction dares not speak. This warden is but the lowest of officials—how much more so for those above him? All fear harm and seek only to absolve themselves, so that even if they harbor good intentions, they dare not express them to their superiors, and thus the Dao is severed.\n\nEven within a single family, bound by blood and kindred, such fear prevails—how much more so between those of different generations? Since the middle ancient era, the Dao and virtue have been lost, and governance has relied instead on might and force, with coercion and threats. Those who do not comply later suffer grave harm, their descendants deeply afflicted. In the lower ancient era, this grew even worse: should one wish to submit a memorial or speak to the emperor, those who probed his intentions would kill them. If not harmed at once, they would be secretly entrusted to others for injury. Thus ministers and people all tied their tongues, sealing their mouths in silence; though they witnessed sorrow and injustice, they could not report it upward. This left the emperor’s wisdom and insight cut off, and heavenly omens multiplied—clear proof of the effect.\n\nNow the people are born of their parents and receive life from heaven and earth, taking heaven and earth as their parents. When they witness calamities or auspicious signs, these are the words of heaven and earth, wishing to speak. Yet all fear harm and instruct one another, collectively turning their backs on the August Emperor and the Earthly Sovereign, suppressing their grievances before heaven and earth, so that words cannot pass, and heaven and earth remain long burdened with unspoken sorrow.\n\nThough the emperor is the wellspring of divine and human, he dwells within a hundred layers, beyond ten thousand *li*. Within those hundred layers, those who wish to convey words are obstructed and coerced, unable to reach him. When words cannot pass, heaven and earth grow enraged, slaughtering all things and destroying the cosmos. In such a year of great misfortune, wisdom is severed, and the state faces grave peril. This crime cannot be named, and thus it must be eradicated.\n\nGreat calamities and strange omens are the great words of heaven and earth. Moderate calamities and omens are their moderate words. Minor calamities and omens are their minor words. This is like human affairs: great matters merit great speech, small matters small speech—nothing appears without cause, nor is it meant to deceive. When great auspicious signs appear, heaven and earth rejoice greatly; when moderate signs appear, they rejoice moderately; when minor signs appear, they rejoice slightly. The absence of calamity and auspice is equilibrium.\n\nThus when heaven intends to aid an emperor, it first endows him with intention. From ancient times to the present, when heaven intends to aid one, it invariably produces extraordinary texts and marvelous strategies that can be verified and governed. Those who follow them all meet with great fortune; when heaven does not intend to aid one, it severs these extraordinary texts and strategies, preventing them from being seen, or if seen, making them appear foolish so they are not understood or applied. When heaven intends to promote one’s conduct, it opens the heart to clarity and receptivity, allowing their use—this is the method of heaven’s aid, and it does not deceive.\n\nThose who are about to prosper tend to favor goodness; those about to decline tend to favor evil. Those destined for fortune are easily guided; those destined for misfortune resist and defy others. Heaven constantly aids the good; the Dao longs to return to the virtuous. Heaven refuses to aid the wicked; the Dao refuses to entrust itself to fools.\n\nHeaven’s talismans return essence as cinnabar script, inscribed into the belly. When one sees the script within, great fortune follows, and all evil departs. The Five Offices and Five Kings are the origins of the Dao, the ancestors of spirits. If one can carefully seal them, closing the gates, then outwardly dark but inwardly bright, how can one not see clearly? Guarding this over time, heavenly physicians descend, and all illnesses vanish, leading to longevity. Fools discard it; the wise treasure it as a priceless gem—this may be called the Dao of eternal existence. It uniquely honors the natural, with form and spirit mutually preserving each other. When these two embrace, any perverse thoughts become faults, and losing the natural, one cannot attain longevity.\n\nThe infant’s five essences return to preserve itself. The Heavenly Lord asked: Why is the realm so difficult to pacify? The divine officials of the Five Phases replied: Now the emperor dwells within a hundred layers, ten thousand *li* from the four borders. Those far away harbor many grievances, and good and evil cannot reach him. Extraordinary methods and marvelous strategies are severed, unable to reach the emperor. Ministers and people, though aggrieved, cannot plead or communicate. Over time, the four directions become obstructed, and the worthy and good hide in seclusion. The emperor cannot obtain marvelous strategies or extraordinary words to pacify the realm—the fault lies in the closure of the distant borders on all sides.\n\nPeople dwell between heaven and earth; since the opening of the world, each person has but one life, never to be reborn. From the moment one has a name and is called human, humanity is the chief of all harmonious things, noble and honored, akin to heaven and earth. Yet upon death, one is eternally confined, never again to be called human or to rise and act. Thus it is mourned as a great injustice.\n\nHeaven and earth’s laws: Heaven and earth are the parents of all things, and they fear that among them, some may weep in grievance, gazing upward to heaven and bowing to earth, lamenting their early demise. Thus heaven generates the true Dao and marvelous methods by which one may protect oneself and attain modest longevity. All living things grow old and perish, yet fools refuse to diligently study the true Dao and good methods that could grant eternal years, delaying death and aging. Instead, they each neglect themselves.\n\nThey scorn the true Dao and mock its marvelous methods, instead engaging in deceit and falsehood to disrupt the Way of Heaven. They deceive their superiors, hastening toward death, building tombs and preparing for the grave, arranging funerary pacts and mourning garments in advance—seeking death, they find it. What injustice is there in this?\n\nWhen one’s years are spent and fate exhausted, it is like the sun rising only to set again. The ancient sage-kings, ever mindful of their own worth and fearing death, day and night sought rare knowledge and extraordinary methods, revered Daoists, and exhausted their wealth in pursuit. Their utmost sincerity moved the August Heaven, which responded with auspicious signs. Masters of Daoist arts aided them, and so many attained long life, some even transcending the world.\n\nNow, heaven and earth regard humans as their children, and the emperor is the most honored of Heaven’s offspring. Yet they do not cherish the true Dao or its marvelous methods. Thus, with deep calculation and foresight, they know that the wealth of the world is not theirs to keep forever.\n\nIn ancient times, sages were wise and enlightened, and all worthy men emerged, gathering above as assistants. Thus, grievances were resolved. Heaven and earth have their principles—how much more so human relations? Emperors could govern with ease, free from worry, while the worthy fulfilled their loyalty, aiding their rulers in governance, together alleviating the great concerns of heaven and earth. The people thrived as a result—was this not good?\n\nWhen great assemblies were held, it was difficult to question why heaven and earth collapsed, why the sun, moon, and stars were eclipsed, why people died violently, or why the twelve thousand states’ strategies and divine texts were revealed. Why did the Three Luminaries suffer eclipses? Heaven and earth openly praise and elevate, yet this is not called praising or elevating people—it is called mutual reciprocity. Such examples are numerous and cannot all be recorded, and none of these receive heavenly retribution.\n\nYet if others do not protect me, I alone secretly protect them—Heaven rewards such a person. If others do evil, I alone do good—Heaven rewards such a person. If others do not contribute to me, I alone take joy in contributing—Heaven rewards such a person. If others do not feed me, I alone take joy in feeding them—Heaven rewards such a person. If others practice teachings as empty falsehoods to deceive, I alone teach people to be sincerely good—Heaven rewards such a person. If others say heaven and earth are unknowing, I alone secretly revere and serve them—Heaven rewards such a person. If others secretly desire to deceive their rulers, I alone secretly protect and benefit them without daring to deceive—Heaven rewards such a person. If parents do not love me, I alone love and protect them—Heaven rewards such a person. Such examples are too many to record.\n\nThe true person reflects: the superior person seeks heavenly reward, the middling person seeks human reward, and the foolish do not give yet demand reward. The most virtuous receive heavenly reward and transcendence. The moderately virtuous receive human reward, and so are loved, benefited, and employed. The foolish, contributing nothing, yet demanding reward, are despised and punished by heaven, earth, and humanity.\n\nThus, the qi of the August Heaven descends to generate, the qi of the Earth ascends to nurture, the qi of the Five Phases unite in effort, and the qi of the four seasons harmonize. The Three Luminaries shine ever brighter, and the world unites as one. Heaven’s nature is to act, and it most honors, values, loves, and protects those who embody it. Once heaven’s nature is good, it generates all things without exception. Earth’s nature is to nurture all things without exception. Sages delight in ordering heaven and earth, and all things receive their beneficence.\n\nThe great and good, the divine immortals, assist heaven and earth in their work, never daring to neglect themselves. They align with the primordial qi and harmonize with the heart of Heaven, and so enjoy perpetual fortune without misfortune.\n\nThe ancient sages and worthies, through deep thought and foresight, understood the intent of the Way of Heaven: they devoted themselves to secretly practicing goodness and dared not do evil. They deeply observed the bright prohibitions of the August Heaven, yet below, people turned their backs and violated them. With shallow learning and inferior understanding, they further disbelieved in Heaven’s prohibitions—thus, their fates were difficult to change, and they perished early.\n\nThe desired lifespans are: Heaven’s longevity at one hundred twenty years, Earth’s at one hundred, humanity’s at eighty, hegemons’ at sixty, and the subordinate at fifty. The Three Norms begin in the east, the head of Heaven. The year and months culminate in the northeast, the pole of Heaven. Heaven’s longevity is the firmness of numbers; the northeast is the beginning of things. The great cycle of the year ends here, so one hundred twenty symbolizes Heaven.\n\nEarth is yin, constantly receiving; the northwest is the extreme of yin. Yin brings death, yang brings life—thus, *hai* (the twelfth earthly branch) is the kernel, the end of yin in the northwest corner. The northwest is Earth’s controller of fate, so Earth’s longevity is one hundred years. Eighty and sixty mark yang’s cessation and yin’s rise, just as autumn begins. Autumn is the white qi, the White Tiger presiding—thus, the hegemonic lifespan. Fifty marks yang’s growth above and yin’s concealment below, yin and yang transforming each other—thus, the subordinate lifespan. Below this, all are called impermanent lifespans—truly a grievous entanglement!\n\nNow, let me clarify one principle for you, which you must never forget if you wish to nurture yourself to the utmost and endure forever. To avoid misfortune and harm and attain long life, one must know how to cherish oneself, to value and befriend oneself, and thus nurture oneself—only then can misfortune and harm be averted.\n\nTo preserve the body for long, eat and drink in moderation, neither too much nor too little—this is cherishing and nurturing oneself. To close the gates and dwell within, not engaging in worldly affairs—this is cherishing and nurturing oneself. To read endlessly, content in poverty and lowliness, free from worry—this is cherishing and nurturing oneself. All that came before is not like this.\n\nTo speak of cherishing oneself is to speak of sincerity. Truly cherish and preserve yourself, reflect on your body—even with eyes closed, you still see yourself, never for a moment separated from it.\n\nReflecting in worry until one feels sated without eating—this is the mark of one who truly cherishes oneself. To speak of \"valuing oneself\" is to speak of cherishing the form of the body, its every part visible from head to toe. When such sincere love and care never cease, the face and eyes radiate light. If one cannot forget this day or night, making it a constant practice, the flesh may take flight and grow strong—this is the Way of self-love and self-care.\n\nNow, therefore, let men and women, young and old, wise and foolish alike, all submit memorials to the throne, that the emperor may attain enlightenment and wisdom. The emperor is like the North Star, ever fixed in its place, while all other stars come to present their affairs. The greater stars lead, the middling follow, and the lesser come last; if even one star fails to appear, the flow of qi is cut off, and the celestial movements are harmed. For the stars are the essence and radiance of the people and all things. Thus, if even one person cannot reach the emperor, one star too cannot reach its place. Heaven’s qi then becomes disordered, and earth’s qi turns against it. Therefore, instruct all officials and commoners, great and small, to submit memorials together, to harmonize heaven’s qi, to stabilize the stars’ courses, to dispel celestial afflictions, and to relieve the emperor of the burden of inherited faults.\n\nThus, three messengers are dispatched to circulate the memorials, lest any fail to reach the throne. The chief officials record disasters and omens within the city walls; the road inspectors record those along the thoroughfares; and the rural officers record those in the four wilds. Each gathers reports of varying lengths, transmits them to one another, and competes to submit them first. If the chief officials grow enraged, heaven and earth engage in battle, and their discord manifests in the sun, moon, stars, and celestial cycles—sometimes eclipses occur, sometimes they do not, the fault lying in the struggle between yin and yang qi. Yin and yang contend for dominance, each seeking to overpower the other. Yet yin and yang were originally meant to benefit and assist each other, together generating harmonious qi; their conflict arises solely from this lack of harmony. If they were harmonized, no eclipses would occur. In the most virtuous ages of high antiquity, eclipses were unknown. By the middle ages, heaven and earth’s intent was gradually lost, yin and yang grew less loving toward one another, and thus their battles began.\n\nIf you doubt my words, let a virtuous ruler put my teachings into practice. If he fully grasps their meaning, the battles will cease; if he grasps half, they will diminish by half. When the emperor abundantly practices the Dao and virtue, the sun and moon do not eclipse, and the stars’ courses remain orderly. This is like old friends who, though long parted, rejoice greatly upon meeting and aid one another. But if they were never close and suddenly encounter each other, they will fight instead.\n\nI ask: when drought strikes and all perish, when the people suffer and die of hunger and cold—this is the wrath of the Great Yang, the August Heaven. The six yang forces unite in resentment and thus bring harm. What does this mean? The six directions reach their limit, and their great net, long disordered by human malice, turns to killing. How does this harm people? It has no name. It simply strikes when the burden of inherited faults reaches its extreme, erupting in great fury, making no distinction between good and evil—those it encounters meet great misfortune. It is like a man seized by rage who, in his fury, attacks even the innocent. What wrong has the victim done? He merely encountered another’s rage. Thus, when the burden of inherited faults reaches its peak, it causes death and evil without distinction. The greatest calamity lies here.\n\nI ask: the strategies of the twelve thousand states differ—where should they be aligned? Let each follow its own customs, but with what should they begin? With the Dipper’s handle pointing southeast, the fire qi arises. I wish to hear the essential meaning of this. Fire is yang. Its tally commands the heart of heaven; harmony governs bestowal, openness governs communication, and clarity governs order. Fire is the lord of the heart, and the spirit of harmony is the chief of transformation. All affairs that arise begin in the heart. The heart governs right action, leaning on benevolence and clarity, and is further endowed with divine radiance. Though the twelve thousand states’ strategies differ, when their memorials are unified in one document, the primordial qi will naturally follow and flow. The perfected ones will adhere to it; to act in accord brings fortune, to oppose it brings ruin. Heaven delights in issuing such texts, and thus I speak.\n\nIn ancient times, the fire phase was to bring Great Peace, yet the divine Way was not rectified. Why, then, does the Celestial Master now command that the fire phase alone rectify the divine Way? Because the fire qi is at its most flourishing, and when the qi of the Highest Sovereign arrives, the fire qi’s flourishing must rectify the divine Way. Why? Fire is the heart of heaven. The heart governs the spirit, and when the heart’s spirit is bright, the heavenly qi is harmonized. When the heavenly qi is unbalanced, the emperor is distressed, yet the people do not grasp its essentials. If you wish to know this, it is bitter to the ears.\n\nNow, when wicked men occupy high positions, they disrupt the emperor’s governance. When the upright are denied office, heaven and earth lose their rectitude, and deviant qi prevails. When deviant qi is abundant, it harms the upright; when the upright are many, they suppress the deviant. These two forces are the natural arts of heaven and earth.\n\nI ask: the Supreme Qi of the Utmost Cavern governs governance. Thus, the Celestial Master examines the sores, scabs, and worms that devour people—this alone verifies the matter. When worms devour people, the disaster is most severe, for it disrupts the proper order. Now that the August Qi of balance has arrived, such things should not occur. They are the responsibility of a virtuous ruler who seeks to understand the Dao in its fullness. Before instructing the people to transfer the names of all worm lords, great and small, that cause harm—such as the three worms of the abdomen that produce sores and scabs—let their names be transferred. There is no worm without a name, however minor. Worms that hide within and secretly consume people are like worthless ministers who lurk within and devour the people. They are deeply to be feared; if not feared, they will bring great harm. Heaven bestows human destiny, and it has its own standards and laws.\n\nWhat Heaven and Earth reserve for themselves lasts thirty years—akin to the way Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, alternate in their cycles, with surplus days forming intercalary months. Thus is the private mandate established; those who surpass this term become immortals. The span of life allotted by Heaven is set at one hundred twenty years; by Earth, one hundred years; by man, eighty years. The lifespan of a hegemon is set at sixty years, and that of a commoner at fifty. Those who fall short of these measures—whether in death or life—suffer the calamities of inherited burdens. How can this be called unjust?\n\nEach person is born with a celestial reckoning, governed by fixed laws, yet most fail to exhaust their allotted span. The accumulation of celestial reckoning is boundless; thus, those who do good receive an increase in their allotment, augmented by this surplus. To grasp the greater principle, consider a village of ten households, each with a thousand acres of land. If nine households commit evil and perish, the sole virtuous household inherits the fields of all nine—this is the meaning of such reward.\n\nDo not expect yin and yang to protect people. If one fails to fulfill their allotted span yet hopes for celestial recompense, they will not receive it. If today you eat another’s food, then tomorrow they eat yours, this is not called consuming another’s food but “borrowed grain.” If today you drink another’s water, then tomorrow they drink yours, this is not called drinking another’s water but “borrowed broth.” If today you carry another’s burden, then tomorrow they carry yours, this is not called bearing another’s load but “borrowed luggage.” If today you lend another your strength, then tomorrow they repay you, this is not called aiding another but “exchanged labor.”\n\nNow, when people praise and recommend someone, they rush to submit memorials; when villagers do so, they too rush to submit memorials; and when travelers do so, they likewise rush to submit them. If local officials hesitate to submit, they fear the people will do so; if the people hesitate, they fear the travelers will; and if the travelers hesitate, they fear the officials will. Thus, all are compelled to submit, and thereafter they vie to present matters.\n\nWhen officials and commoners prove trustworthy, the emperor employs them without betrayal. Thus, officials and commoners delight in their service, and the emperor gains wisdom, fulfilling the royal will and securing his longevity. Officials and commoners, in turn, honor Heaven and Earth, remaining free of illness. When all four directions of Heaven and Earth benefit, long-lasting fortune is assured, establishing a model for ten thousand generations. This is entrusted to a ruler of supreme virtue, that the people may know the will of Heaven, enabling them to secure their own peace and wholeness, free from confusion.\n\nThe great compilation gathers and rectifies matters, examining the roots of Heaven and Earth to eliminate the terrors of Heaven, the faults of Earth, and the harms afflicting the state, thereby establishing the *Canon of the Utmost Extremity*. Furthermore, I inquired of the Heavenly Master’s writings, which collate and verify all texts from the opening of Heaven and Earth to the present—those of former worthies and sages, the *River Chart* and *Luo Book*, divine writings, and even the words of common folk, servants, and distant barbarians. All receive extraordinary words and unique strategies, unified into a single discourse to illuminate the Dao of Heaven. Was this not an immense labor?\n\nYet because distant matters often remain obscure, each seeks the abode of Great Peace within their own domain, preparing in their assigned villages and towns. Those too distant to deliver their words in person may establish stations along the roads, where they deposit extraordinary words, virtuous strategies, and rare methods. These are then gathered and presented to the ruler of virtue, allowing the assembled worthies to examine and classify them, selecting the finest and most upright to discard falsehoods and form the *Canon of the Utmost Extremity*, named the *Celestial Canon of Utmost Governance*.\n\nThus, the ailments of Heaven and Earth will be entirely dispelled; the governance of the emperor will achieve great stability; and the accumulated disasters of inherited burdens across ten thousand generations will be driven away. Thereafter, the myriad beings and spirits will transform in ways beyond description, and no longer will they ascend to report human evils to Heaven above.\n\nTherefore, the decree to collate and verify these texts is Heaven’s command for me to speak below. Though laborious, how could I not exert myself to the utmost? If every year, from all under Heaven, ten or so writings and individual testimonies are gathered, the doubts of the world will resolve themselves—without undue burden. Each remains in their place, speaking and transmitting their words upward. This is how the world’s voices are collected and shared, communicating the intent of Heaven and Earth, circulating the qi of Heaven and Earth, eliminating the emperor’s disasters, and benefiting all people and beings. When each attains their rightful place, Heaven and Earth will rejoice as one, their ailments dispelled. In their joy, they will protect the emperor, allowing him to govern effortlessly and wander at leisure.\n\nI wish to know why Heaven and Earth, at this time, command the people of the world to gather words and strategies, along with the writings of ancient and modern divine sages, to form the *Canon of the Utmost Extremity*.\n\nThe reason is that Heaven and Earth suffer from grave illnesses, constantly afflicted by chaos, and have never achieved proper governance. Thus, they instruct people to gather and collectively produce correct words and extraordinary strategies to cure these ailments. This is why they command a great assembly of voices and matters.\n\nI wish to know why, when Heaven and Earth are in chaos and afflicted, they do not simply bring forth more good sages.\n\nTo repeatedly produce later sages would be of no benefit. The Heavenly Master said: The conduct of ancient sages varied in excellence, each excelling in one domain, all speaking the words of Heaven and Earth yet differing in expression. Thus, the sages who appeared before and after pursued distinct paths. All delighted in fulfilling the will of Heaven and Earth, eliminating evil and promoting good, yet their words were not entirely alike, though broadly similar. Therefore, even the assembled sages could not fully comprehend the intent of Heaven and Earth. Thus, Heaven and Earth remain afflicted by grave illnesses, none of which are dispelled. For this reason, I have been sent to convey this message to the Perfected One.\n\nThe Perfected One I address is one among the gods of Heaven who delights in goodness and seeks to align with the will of Heaven—unique in his enduring truth. The reason for collating the divine writings of the high, middle, and low antiquity is this: what the divine writings of high antiquity did not address, those of middle antiquity did; what the divine writings of middle antiquity did not address, those of low antiquity did.\n\nThus, by categorizing and aligning them to complement one another, a single discourse of goodness is completed—hence their compilation, whereby the intent of Heaven and Earth may be observed. What the sages of high antiquity missed, those of middle antiquity grasped; what the sages of middle antiquity missed, those of low antiquity grasped; what the sages of low antiquity missed, those of high antiquity grasped. By categorizing and aligning them, and thereby complementing one another, a single discourse of sagely goodness is completed.\n\nThe highest sages may have missed something, which the middle sages grasped; the middle sages may have missed something, which the lesser sages grasped. Again, by categorizing and aligning them, and thereby complementing one another, a single discourse of sagely goodness is completed. The greatest worthies may have missed something, which the middle worthies grasped; the middle worthies may have missed something, which the lesser worthies grasped. By categorizing and aligning them, a single discourse of worthy goodness is completed. Emperors and kings may have missed something, which their ministers and sons grasped; their ministers and sons may have missed something, which the common people grasped. By categorizing and aligning them, and thereby complementing one another, a single discourse of goodness is completed. The eldest may have missed something, which the able-bodied grasped; the able-bodied may have missed something, which the young grasped. By categorizing and complementing one another, a single discourse of goodness is completed. Men may have missed something, which women grasped; women may have missed something, which servants, slaves, and barbarians grasped. By categorizing and aligning them, and thereby complementing one another, a single discourse of goodness is completed. The writings of high antiquity may have missed something, which those of middle antiquity grasped; the writings of middle antiquity may have missed something, which those of low antiquity grasped. By categorizing and aligning them, and thereby complementing one another, a single discourse of goodness is completed. The people of high antiquity may have missed something, which those of middle antiquity grasped; the people of middle antiquity may have missed something, which those of low antiquity grasped. By categorizing and aligning them, and thereby complementing one another, a single discourse of goodness is completed.\n\nSome may have missed something above, yet grasped it below; some may have missed something below, yet grasped it above; some may have missed something above and below, yet grasped it in the middle; some may have missed something in the middle, yet grasped it above and below. The divine writings of the celestial gods may have missed something, yet the sages grasped it; the sages may have missed something, yet the worthies grasped it; the worthies may have missed something, yet the common people grasped it; the common people may have missed something, yet the barbarians grasped it. Some may have missed something internally, yet grasped it externally; some may have missed something externally, yet grasped it internally. There are those who grasp it, and those who miss it. Thus, from above and below, within and without, the noble and the humble, the near and the distant—all take their essential words, compiling their strengths and shortcomings, categorizing and aligning them, and thereby complementing one another, then it shall be complete. Thereafter, the words and discourses of the writings shall be fully communicated.\n\nHeaven and Earth generate all things, the people, the sages and worthies, the crawling creatures and the myriad beings—each has its strengths and shortcomings, each has its insufficiencies, each has its losses. Thus, their actions differ, though all broadly seek to align with the intent of Heaven and Earth and thereby secure their own peace. Therefore, today Heaven has sent me down to assist the ruler of supreme virtue in further examining the teachings of the writings, and I have assembled them all. The divine writings and sagely discourses, extending even to the common people, servants, slaves, and barbarians—by categorizing and aligning them, combining their words and discourses, the good shall be made into a comprehensive scripture, named *The Writings of the Supreme Heaven’s Utmost Governance*. Thereafter, the grave illnesses of Heaven and Earth shall all be dispelled.\n\nI ask: by assembling these categories to align with one another—\nIndeed, rectifying their words for goodness brings fortune; failing to rectify their words for goodness brings misfortune. Thereafter, the qi of the Great Peace and the Supreme Sovereign shall swiftly arrive.\n\nPeople afflicted by illness all wish to swiftly recover and become well; the illnesses of Heaven and Earth likewise wish to swiftly recover and become well. Now, heterodox writings confuse the Daoist scriptures; when the Daoist scriptures are confused, the celestial patterns and earthly principles are disordered. When the celestial patterns and earthly principles are disordered, Heaven and Earth fall ill. Thus, the Three Luminaries, winds and rains, the four seasons, and the Five Agents engage in constant strife, and the years turn inauspicious. The emperor and king grow anxious and distressed; the officials govern in chaos; the people suffer from hunger and cold—all this is the affliction of heterodox writings. When heterodox writings, heterodox words, and misleading discourses are used to govern the state, disorder arises daily. Thereupon, ministers distort the law and act recklessly; the people are impoverished and exhausted, together defiling the principles of Heaven and Earth. The celestial officials grow furious, weeping and crying out in grievance without end.\n\nWhen heterodox words, heterodox writings, and misleading discourses are used to govern the household, father and son, husband and wife fall into disorder, growing mutually resentful and constantly quarreling without cease, thus becoming an inauspicious household. Only upright words, upright writings, and upright discourses are the root of rectifying Heaven and Earth, the treasures that pacify the household, the state, the sacred vessels, and the parents—and the mandate received by all people and the myriad beings under Heaven. Thus, one must strive to rectify them.\n\nTherefore, in my practice of the Dao, I wholly uphold the fundamental precepts and the mean, discarding the superficial. Heaven upholds the fundamental, so I uphold the fundamental; Heaven preaches the mean, so I preach the mean; Heaven discards the superficial, so I discard the superficial. In my writings, I am of one body with Heaven and Earth, of one heart and one intent, of one direction and one principle, of one liking and one disliking, of one Dao and one path. Thus, when the virtuous ruler applies them, there shall be no error. For ten thousand times ten thousand years, they shall not be abandoned—only growing ever more manifest, with no time of obscurity; only growing ever more ordered, with no time of chaos; only growing ever more good, with no time of evil. Thus, it is called *The Utmost and Upright Dao of Heaven*, which embraces the heart of Heaven and Earth. Those who obtain its highest secrets may attain longevity; those who obtain its middle secrets may become the state’s assistants; those who obtain its lowest secrets may always secure their own peace.\n\nI ask: why is yang alone honored and noble, while yin alone is deemed lowly and base?\nThe divine person says: Yang is alone honored and noble because it upholds the fundamental, ever full and replete with substance. Yin is alone deemed lowly and base because it is empty and devoid of substance—thus, it is despised and held in contempt. Now, yin and yang, male and female, are the very origin from which the primordial qi first arises—the gateway of yin and yang.\n\nThe place where humans receive their mandate and life is their root. Thus, when a man receives his mandate, he is full and overflowing, with an abundance below and to his left and right—one solid essence remains. Those above are full and overflowing, ever bestowing upon the lower yin and accumulating surplus. This bestowal is the movement of Great Yang; is there anything it does not generate? Is there anything it cannot accomplish? The accumulation below corresponds to Great Yin and Earth, with patterns and veins aligning with the fields’ divisions. The solid essence on the left corresponds to humanity, while that on the right corresponds to the myriad things. This solidity—this core reality—is benevolence and the love of bestowing, which is why yang is honored as noble. Women are deemed lowly and base because the place where they receive their mandate is empty and void, without fullness or surplus, and thus without solid essence—hence their lowliness.\n\nThus, the Way of Heaven values the root and guards the origin. One must return to the root and guard the primordial, rightly upholding the examined patterns to dispel confusion. Only then can Heaven endure and Earth last, the state be at peace and the people secure—all because the solid yang delights in bestowing. Yang is Heaven, the ruler; yin is Earth, the minister. Therefore, one reveres yang’s bestowal and thereby nourishes it.\n\nI ask the divine person: how many states are there in the world?\nThere are eighty-one domains in the central region, and beyond them, another encircling expanse—altogether, the world holds ten thousand states. Farther still, beyond the ordered caverns of the void, the three regions together comprise twelve thousand states, all receiving the teachings of Great Peace. In the first year of Great Peace, people rejoice and act in goodness. In the second year, the earth brings forth great joy. In the third year, grace and favor thoroughly permeate the world. In the fourth year, the winds and qi flow in harmony. In the fifth year, spirits do not wage war, and malevolent forces submit and vanish. In the sixth year, the six norms are fully established. In the seventh year, the Three Luminaries grow brighter. In the eighth year, grace reaches all eight directions. In the ninth year, yin and yang are both content. In the tenth year, the myriad things each attain their proper place. This completes the lesser cycle, and when things combine thrice, Heaven, Earth, and humanity are complete—thus, in thirty years, Great Peace is achieved.\n\nNow, the qi of the Supreme Sovereign emerges, and the true Dao arrives, governing for ten years—this is Lesser Great Peace. If one diligently practices the true Dao for twenty years, Middle Great Peace is attained, wherein emperors and kings below, along with all officials and commoners, follow the true Dao and dispel deceit and falsehood.\n\nThe divine person speaks to the perfected one: In ancient times, when first learning the Dao, the spirit roams and guards softness to preserve itself. Accumulating virtue without cease, the Dao leads to immortality—riding clouds and driving dragons through the gates of Heaven, following the celestial rotations like a cycle. The perfected one, through singular devotion, attains longevity, their life linked to Heaven. The Dao of yang accumulates through focused devotion, and daily, singular sincerity brings it to fruition. Without contending for glory or rank, one may yet hold high office. Serving teachers with filial piety, the Dao naturally comes. The spirits recognize goodness, and people speak with them.\n\nThe teacher who opens one’s understanding is the beginning of the Dao. The ruler, father, and teacher are the gates of destiny for the world. Revering and serving these three, the Dao unfolds in great measure. Failing to serve them, one’s chamber is closed without a door—blessings and virtue flee, while misfortune and chaos take pity. Examine these matters carefully, and do not lose the words of this text.\n\nParents give life, while teachers instruct in relationships. Serving them with devotion—can one not be cautious? The noblest in the world abandon office to become immortals. Immortality has no end, and life connects to Heaven. Local officials govern the people, while immortal officials serve as celestial officers—what business do they have with the mundane? Their affairs differ. Local officials govern the people and the myriad spirits; the world’s affairs each have their ruler. Strive to think of goodness, and your body may remain whole. Thus departing, you do not betray your ancestors.\n\nMy illustrated texts are now exhausted, and nothing more can be set forth. Exert yourself in study and carefully inquire into these writings.\n\nThe divine person is about to depart and thus admonishes the perfected one: Be cautious, be cautious! Do not transmit this recklessly. To one unworthy, do not reveal it. Hide it deep in the abyss, in the darkness between the unseen. The Dao does not drink blood, nor does it speak of essential texts. What is external and internal is already complete—nothing more can be said.\n\nHere, the divine person is depicted in feathered robes, ascending to Heaven in a carriage drawn by nine dragons, accompanied by lesser perfected ones on simurghs and cranes, with colorful clouds gathering before them, as if bidding farewell.\n\nOn the western wall is an illustration: The ancient divine and perfected ones warned later learners through images of evil—do not act as hidden thieves, do not dislike following proper affairs, and do not indulge in jealousy, which brings death and misfortune. The Way of Heaven cannot be forcibly seized; those who seize it will bring about war, loss of authority, death, and the ruin of their lineage. Stealing divine texts will lead to defeat; seeking profit will instead bring harm—this is the resonance of Heaven and Earth’s nature, the meeting of the spontaneous. Examine joy to endure long; be cautious, be cautious! Do not delight in harm. Goodness arises naturally, while evil self-destructs. Observe these two images and ponder their benefits and harms.\n\nAll things under Heaven follow their kind. Even in the space of a hair, there is no error. Yet people are not themselves refined and thus remain ignorant. Once the name of guilt is attached, nothing can be done. Failing to guard the root, one’s death is followed by lingering transgressions. Acting wickedly within, refined qi summon external forces. Thus, ahead lies harm and imprisonment, while behind lurk malevolent spirits, all hastening to fight. Regret comes too late, and one forgets oneself.\n\nTherefore, these images are drawn to warn later worthies as a great caution. Fools do not believe in the Dao and neglect affairs as if indifferent. Yet when they speak, they do not err by even a fraction. Thus, those who guard softness attain longevity, while those who love strife perish. Things follow their kind and cannot return—regret is useless, and spirits become attached.\n\nSeeing the warning and awakening, one may yet return in time. If no harm has been done above, one may still become a good person. The good ascend, while the wicked descend. The Way of Heaven is impartial, and the spontaneous is never lost. Open and unobstructed, it aligns with the heart of Heaven and the will of Earth, transforming Heaven and Earth’s calamities, smoothing their discourse, allowing people to dwell in their places and the myriad things to remain unharmed.\n\nThus, Heaven sends forth written scriptures, enabling communication across ten thousand myriad leagues, conveying its words to enlighten the virtuous, discern the wicked, and resolve grievances and entanglements. Therefore, the emperor-kings dwell within a hundredfold seclusion, attaining long-lasting peace, their wisdom and clarity reaching distant lands.\n\nSince the Highest Antiquity and Middle Antiquity, many have turned their backs on Heaven and Earth, jointly deceiving their superiors. Hence, disasters and calamities arise daily, and the dead cannot be numbered. The emperor-kings, long distressed, cannot restrain their subordinates from craft and deceit. Thus, Heaven dispatches the three Daoist scriptures to circulate their qi, bringing joy in knowing gains and losses, harmonizing above and below. Admonitions extend to the humble and distant, preventing grievances and entanglements, aligning with the heart of August Heaven. Delighting in the removal of disasters, they prevent Heaven’s wrath.\n\nIn the Lower Antiquity, the hearts of people are perverse and obscured, unlike the Three Sovereigns of the Highest Antiquity, whose hearts were simple and sincere, their intentions single-minded. Each delighted in aligning with the heart of Heaven, loyal and trustworthy, never deceiving their superiors—thus, no scriptures were needed. In the Lower Antiquity, petty men are foolish and deluded, distorting words with falsehood, deceiving Heaven and Earth, and hoodwinking emperor-kings. Therefore, Heaven and Earth are often enraged, sending down disasters. When Heaven and Earth’s afflictions are removed, the emperor-kings are secure and long-lived, the people dwell in peace, the myriad things fulfill their heavenly years, free from resentment. Yin and yang proceed in harmony, the host of spirits rejoice greatly, filled with joy—this is the essential Dao.\n\nIf a son is unfilial, he cannot exert himself to nourish his parents. If a disciple is disobedient, he cannot fully devote himself to following the Dao of his enlightened teacher.\n\nA minister who is disloyal cannot fully devote himself to reverently serving his lord. For these three conducts—failing in filial piety, loyalty, or obedience—the guilt cannot be absolved. Heaven detests them, ghosts and spirits harm them, and all people despise them. Even in death, their blame lingers in the underworld, branded as those whose three conducts were unruly and unvirtuous. Each month’s final bright dawn, they are summoned to face Heaven, which governs the rectification of yin and yang. The spirits and officials of high and low ranks grieve for their souls, tormented until annihilation.\n\nHeaven sets fifteen days as a minor reckoning, thus the moon wanes after the fifteenth day. A month serves as a middle reckoning, and a year as a great reckoning. The myriad spirits and essences between Heaven and Earth jointly assist Heaven in nurturing the twelve thousand beings, and thus all spirits and essences receive their allotted sustenance. This is like worthy ministers aiding the emperor-king in nurturing all people and things, so that all receive their due.\n\nTherefore, Heaven establishes the law: all spirits report in minor audience on the fifteenth day of the month, in middle audience once a month, and in great audience once a year. Those with great merit are promoted and elevated; those without merit are demoted or punished. Those who disrupt governance are the spirits of perversity and evil.\n\nIf one lives as a filial son, a loyal minister, and an obedient disciple, never departing from these virtues, then after death, one’s soul, spirit, and essence will not face judgment. For the two reckonings: those who study my Daoist scriptures, aligning them with past and present, categorizing them by kind, and grasping their essential meaning—even the most worthy and enlightened rejoice uncontrollably, unable to restrain themselves from goodness. If they dare enter the thatched chamber, steadfastly guarding the Way without fail, they will surely transcend the world. Their aspiration merges profoundly with the numinous, and they no longer seek praise in worldly affairs. Their goodness pervades Heaven and Earth, and their spirit aids Heaven and Earth, returning to assist the emperor-king in transforming evil. Their benevolence extends even to the smallest blades of grass, and none fail to receive its transformative virtue.\n\nThus, in antiquity, the worthy and enlightened who found a teacher and could aid the emperor-king in achieving Great Peace were all such people. The moderately worthy, diligently studying my scriptures, aligning them with ancient and modern Daoist texts, categorizing them by kind, and studying them earnestly—those among them of sufficient talent may ascend to become good ministers and virtuous officials, aiding the virtuous ruler in transforming evil. Their benevolence reaches even the smallest blades of grass. Yin and yang harmonize, and warfare ceases. The emperor-king enjoys long tranquility without trouble, while all ministers below teach and strive together, all obedient and virtuous, loyal and trustworthy. Governance proceeds without punishment, and evil cannot prevail.\n\nWhen the people collectively study my Daoist scriptures, high and low unite in shared purpose, acting as one. No one remains who knows how to commit wickedness. They collate and categorize ancient and modern Daoist texts, linking them by kind, making them the learning of the age, passed down from father to son without end. When the three grades—superior, middling, and common—all practice this, the malevolent qi of Heaven and Earth is entirely dispelled, and no further calamities of karmic inheritance arise. Goodness harmonizes yin and yang, the qi of Heaven and Earth aligns, and auspicious signs emerge, roaming the emperor’s capital. This is the proof of the joy and delight of the August Heaven and Earth.\n\nTherefore, those who study my texts should examine them with utmost care. For the three reckonings: those who attain the Dao will surely encounter spirits who empower them. The most worthy and enlightened govern ten out of ten matters perfectly and may serve as the emperor’s ministers, driving away perversity and eliminating evil. Some may, after a long time, enter the chamber and transcend the world, no longer seeking praise in worldly affairs. Thus, only by guarding the One can one fully know good and evil, merits and faults; only then can one guard the Dao. By entering the chamber and refining one’s thoughts, one can then guard the spirit—this is the third stage.\n\nThe worthy collate and verify ancient and modern divine scriptures. The moderately worthy guard the One and enter the Dao, eventually witnessing the spirits themselves. They govern nine out of ten matters perfectly and may serve as great ministers to kings and lords, driving away perversity and eliminating evil. With time, they may hope to enter the chamber. The lesser worthy guard the One, enter the Dao, and study the scriptures, sometimes witnessing the spirits. They govern eight out of ten matters perfectly and may serve the people in driving away perversity and eliminating evil. They, too, collate and verify ancient and modern Daoist texts, proving the Way to themselves, so that even the foolish come to understand and believe in the Dao.\n\nWhen the great worthy, the middling worthy, and the common people all guard the divine Dao and practice it, the spirits of Heaven and Earth and the four seasons all assist them, and perversity naturally vanishes. Thus, the spirits of Heaven above, Earth below, the four directions, the six relations, and the six kinships all rejoice. Heaven promotes goodness and aids people in auspiciousness.\n\nMy Dao governs Heaven and Earth, pacifies the emperor-king, and gives life to what Heaven and Earth love—thus, one must love the true Dao and true virtue. Heaven is the truth of the Dao, its guiding principle, its faithfulness, and the course by which it moves. Earth is the chief of virtue, its guiding thread, and the foundation upon which it rests. Thus, it is the mother of the myriad things, enduring humiliation and dwelling below, never boasting of its toil.\n\nAs the Virtuous Lord, I teach and transform the ignorant, taking these two matters of Heaven and Earth as my foundation. Thus, I always follow the laws of Heaven and Earth, never straying from their gate and threshold. My scriptures are the words of Heaven and Earth, deeply and uniquely resonant with the gods and spirits, like the exterior and interior of a single body.\n\nAll names under Heaven today are categorized by kind, so one may know their proper affiliation. Those who embody the Five Surnames in abundance resemble yang and are benevolent; those who embody the Six Passions in abundance resemble yin and are greedy. Those who receive more yang bestowal become male; those who receive more yin bestowal become female. Those who receive more qi of prosperity and dominance are noble and single-minded; those who receive more qi of decline, decay, and imprisonment suffer frequent illness, die young, and live in extreme poverty.\n\nThus, all who are born embody the qi of the Five Phases they resemble. Their fate is determined by the Six Jia and Five Calendars, categorized by kind according to the ancients—never erring even once.\n\nThe sages of antiquity delved deeply into the origins of all matters, understanding human nature through this. Do the Perfected Ones comprehend this? Gazing upward to emulate the heavens in conduct, one may act in accordance with celestial patterns; looking downward to emulate the earth in conduct, one transforms through the earth’s virtue and power. Reflecting that heaven and earth, as father and mother, gave me life and growth, they do not wish me to delight in evil—thus, I examine my heart before acting. The heart is the most revered spirit concealed within. The heart is the sacred, pure yang fire. When this fire moves, it ascends, sharing the same radiance as heaven. Thus, the sun, sovereign of fire, governs all under heaven with impartial illumination. Therefore, when a person embodies utmost sincerity, the pain of the heart’s rectitude ascends as the sacred spirit, rising to the sun and moon, and further ascending to heaven. Thus, utmost sincerity within is the numinous spirit—how can one not be cautious?\n\nHeaven acts through the utmost Dao; earth acts through the utmost virtue. The utmost virtue is the foundation of the household, jointly nurturing the myriad things without concealment or partiality. The sages of antiquity emulated heaven and earth in their conduct, employing the utmost Dao and essential virtue to instruct the foolish, guiding them to prudence and goodness, making governance effortless. Yet in this age, such ways are often obstructed and severed, so the foolish collectively engage in cunning and deceit, losing the Dao of heaven. Unaware of their own wrongdoing, they fail to practice the true Dao and benevolent virtue, thus many incur heavenly punishment, meeting deaths that remain unabsolved.\n\nNow, the Celestial Master broadly opens the path of the heavenly Dao, meticulously collating the texts of ancient Daoist scriptures to establish the true essential and secret Dao. The true Dao abounds in goodness; its writings enter the divine, enabling one to perceive spirits and govern alongside them. When the spirit enters the divine, it is the true Dao. Many attain this in secluded chambers; some are enabled to transcend within their rooms and depart, while others enter and exit without yet being able to leave. Some merely perceive the spirits but remain bound through the ages. Those who conduct themselves as disciples of the Dao and study to attain high office must resolve their intentions.\n\nFor all people, focused inquiry is key. Entering the gate of learning today, one must concentrate the mind, constantly desiring to benefit and cherish others without uttering falsehoods. Those who study in youth yet persist in ignorance into old age do not delight in attaining office. Yet those who diligently study, striving to comprehend the classics and the Dao, ceaselessly accumulating goodness—whose conduct and learning establish their reputation, whose mastery of the classics and Dao deepens their understanding of the origins of ancient and modern calamities—bring benefit to superiors and advantage to inferiors. Their accumulated goodness cannot be concealed, and their names resound in all directions. Enlightened rulers favor them, summoning and appointing them, while all praise, \"Excellent is this person!\" Those who rejoice in their virtue are those who study the Dao and transcend the world.\n\nI further expound the Dao to disciples: those who do not transcend, though they enter the gate of learning today, take no delight in pondering the true Dao or its benevolent teachings. Instead, they seek vast knowledge and broad observation, aspiring to exhaust the ways of the sages. Yet they do not desire to practice goodness, preferring instead the superficial embellishments of rhetoric that enable deception. Even after entering the classics and the Dao, their minds remain unfocused, constantly indulging in falsehoods and verbal disputes, making harm to others their vocation. They disrespect superiors and fail to cherish inferiors. Their mastery of the classics and Dao remains hollow, unfit to serve as worthy ministers to emperors and kings, instead becoming leaders of disorder. Relying on others’ wealth to advance themselves, they seek high office to elevate their reputation, then embezzle public resources for private gain, betraying superiors to benefit subordinates. Such are the disruptors who undermine proper governance, the scourges of heaven and earth, the traitors to the state. They are tigers and wolves among the people, wicked children to their parents. Heaven and earth detest them; ghosts and spirits abhor them. Thus, their crimes warrant execution by the emperor to align with the will of heaven, to eliminate the great harm to the people—these are the deceitful who attain office.\n\nSome, though their minds lack sincerity and substance, harboring no true steadfastness, instead constantly scheme to obtain office. Office is the celestial constellation’s domain, bestowed upon the virtuous and rewarding the meritorious—not recklessly given to the undeserving. The undeserving are disregarded by heaven and earth, unloved by spirits and deities. The foolish, unable to deeply recognize their own faults, persist in vainly desiring celestial office. Malevolent spirits and entities then enter their hearts, compelling them to utter falsehoods and perverse speech, which they cannot restrain. Thus, some perish through perverse words—this is the meaning. Not only does misapprehending the Dao bring misfortune, but the Perfected Ones must strive in the art of self-transcendence.\n\nThe sages and worthies of antiquity observed the luminous laws of heaven and thus practiced the Dao and upheld virtue. Heaven is singularly focused, moving day and night in the Dao without speech, thus enduring in fortune. Earth moves day and night in the Dao without speech, nurturing the myriad things, thus enduring in singular fortune. The four seasons move day and night in the Dao without ceasing, thus perpetually flourishing and reigning without end. The Three Luminaries alone follow the true Dao without speech, thus perpetually radiant, moving in accord with heaven. The Five Phases alone follow the true Dao without speech, thus enduring with heaven and earth. All under heaven who practice the Dao emulate these—innumerable are the examples. Constantly cherishing and benefiting others, refraining from reckless speech, the Dao may be attained. Those who lightly dismiss my words are harmed by the Dao.\n\nI speak as the discourse of heaven to admonish the virtuous ruler. When a virtuous ruler arises in heaven, they must love the Dao, and the myriad people will emulate their ruler, all taking this text as a warning. Thus, heaven’s emulation and law are most exalted, without superior; in reversal, most humble, without inferior. Its greatness has no exterior; in reversal, its smallness has no interior. It encompasses and nurtures the myriad things, bestowing benefit and blessing upon the good and evil, great and small alike, endowing them with primordial qi to give life, ultimately without harm or injury. Thus, it is most fittingly called the divine, the supreme ruler of heaven.\n\nNow the qi of the Supreme Sovereign arrives, and the virtuous ruler governs, emulating this as their model. Thus, my Dao rises and falls, sinks and floats, desiring that the multitude of worthies deliberate upon it together.\n\nThe earthly gate of the southeast holds the waters of heaven and earth, which do not resist even the smallest currents—good and evil, great and small all return to it. Do you, Perfected One, comprehend this?\n\nAmong the myriad scrolls of texts, only those that can extend a person’s years and augment their lifespan are true scriptures; the rest are not. Among the texts filling a chamber, only those that can secure the heart of heaven and bring about equitable governance are true scriptures; the rest are not. Among the ministers filling the court, only those who delight in their ruler and assist them in achieving Great Peace are the true ministers and worthy officials of the emperor; the rest are merely functionaries. Among the children a person bears, only those whose parents constantly enjoy their joy and suffer neither hunger nor cold are filial and virtuous; the rest are but numbers to be filled. Among the accumulated prescriptions and heavy carts of remedies, only those that can all extend years are true formulas; the rest are not.\n\nThe world abounds with such examples, too numerous to name or foretell. Perfected One, deeply ponder their meaning. My scripture, by inferring from one to ten thousand, suffices to illuminate the Dao of the world. Thus, I charge you, Perfected One, to transmit the Dao to the virtuous ruler, to examine and distinguish all common texts and the words of those who claim sagely writings, clearly demonstrating them to the multitude of worthies, so that all may together awaken and dispel delusion.\n\nOnce all common texts are examined and distinguished, the days of calamity will depart. For perverse texts and perverse words are the masters of treacherous disasters. True texts and true words are the officials who subdue treacherous evil. With true texts and true words, and with officials who rectify treachery, falsehoods will have no master and thus no place to abide. Perverse words as masters of treachery are like thieves who have a place to lodge; once the master perishes, thieves have no means to return and rest.\n\nIn practicing the model of the Dao of heaven, by inferring from one to ten thousand, the ten thousand cannot all be written. Excessive texts bewilder people; it is better to raise one guiding principle, so that the myriad strands arrange themselves and unfold. Thus, the clamor of ten thousand people is not equal to one emperor. The countless stars, myriad as they are, are not equal to the brightness of a single sun. The words of those who strive to support heaven and all below are not equal to one worthy and good person in the state. The Dao of heaven is vast and boundless, without limit, yet it is not equal to the primordial qi holding the guiding principle of heaven’s mandate.\n\nIf the worthy and virtuous ruler ponders my words, their lifespan will naturally lengthen. If later generations together ponder my words, fathers will be kind and sons filial, and this will daily expand and become clearer. Great and small will vie in doing good, and there will be no more violence. No longer will there be perverse texts or flatterers lurking in the state. Disasters and anomalies will be entirely eradicated, and the Three Luminaries will shine brightly. This is the natural art, which the Celestial Masters together purify.\n\nIn practicing the Dao thus, what harm could there be? Proceeding in this way as a model is the very movement of heaven. To record and preserve these writings is to contemplate the divine clarity of heaven and earth. The texts that verify this resonate with heaven and earth, forming a covenant of trust. Worthy rulers and the virtuous should together deliberate upon these words; those who practice them will daily flourish, aligning with the times to form a court that fulfills the desires of heaven and earth—thus, how auspicious!\n\nI, on behalf of the virtuous ruler of Great Peace, establish these models and measures, without limiting them to one person. When the qi of Great Peace arrives, if even one person remains aggrieved, unable to attain their desire, then the qi of the Supreme Sovereign and Great Peace cannot arrive together. Thus, heaven instructs me to broadly open the path, allowing each to freely choose what they may do.\n\nThose of wisdom and brightness who desire to live joyfully may study my scriptures, ponder their meaning, enter the chamber, and accomplish the Dao—they may attain life. Those of gentle virtue who desire to assist the emperor in governance may emulate my scriptures in their actions—they may bring about Great Peace. Those who desire to manage their households and engage in commerce may ponder my scriptures—they may complete their natural lifespan, each attaining their wishes without great grievance.\n\nThus, when the virtuous ruler governs, the qi of Great Peace arrives. The reason for this is that there are no aggrieved persons in the world; each attains what they desire. The worthy and enlightened virtuous ruler does not seize what others desire and must win the hearts of the world, desiring to comply with heaven’s will and return to it. The movement of heaven does not seize what people desire; the movement of earth does not seize what people desire. The enlightened ruler emulates this and thus achieves Great Peace.\n\nHeaven and earth, most divine, do not seize what others desire—how much less should humans? The divine persons of high antiquity admonished their disciples and later learners to cultivate good and model virtue, secretly aiding and benefiting people to ensure constant auspiciousness, their merit multiplied. Overt goodness is met with human responses and resolves. Covert goodness is known by heaven, earth, and all spirits, thus their merit is multiplied.\n\nThose who accumulate virtue are beloved by the wealthy, and their goodness naturally comes to them. What people praise, ghosts and spirits also praise, thereby aiding and assisting them. Those who love the Dao attain long life, sharing the concerns of yin and yang, following the movement of the August Spirit, the nature of heaven and earth, and attaining the principle of the Dao—thus, heaven protects them. Those who lose this disrupt heaven and do not love good people.\n\nSeeking goodness through goodness is nothing strange. Learning through benevolence is the beginning of the Dao; attaining it through virtue is the harmony of the Dao; attaining it through the Dao is the highest. I originally studied little but did not cease, concentrating my spirit and reflecting upon it, tears often falling. Through long accumulation, I received the great grace of August Heaven, and today I fortunately encountered the divine persons of heaven in the wilderness.\n\nAt the beginning of my studies, I was deficient, pondering and inquiring about trivial matters and superficial embellishments. Originally seeking the method of guarding the One and nurturing nature, I composed three hundred verses, only to see the Celestial Master expound without limit. Thus, I dared to ask: Can the tranquility of the body be attained and long life preserved?\n\nYou come to study and inquire on behalf of heaven; I suspect heaven has bestowed this upon you. I wish to hear the essential meaning—by what is this made clear?\n\nNow should a virtuous ruler obtain this scripture, comprehend it in heart, and practice it—discussing it with all worthy ministers to transform the common people—then surely a resonant response shall arise, which is its clear proof.\n\nMy Dao is perfected through precepts, not through false words or deeds. This is the decisive principle.\n\nI have long embraced this Dao, yet found none with whom to speak. Heaven’s grievances have knotted severely, and afflictions transform without cease. In this stifled impasse, how could the Celestial Master go forth and transmit it?\n\nIt is said: The position is not fitting. My office resides in heaven; the Perfected One’s office resides on earth. Those on earth bring forth the myriad things, thus heaven’s creations are nurtured upon the earth. Therefore, I transmit the Dao to the Perfected One. The earth gives birth to rulers, common folk, and the twelve thousand beings—all receive yang’s bestowal, emerging from within yin. Thus, you may transmit it to humankind.\n\nYou doubt the sincerity of my words. Though heaven issues its decrees, it does not speak directly to mortals—yet our intentions are one. This scripture bears heaven’s mandate, its clarity like cinnabar and ink.\n\nThis is the origin of heaven’s numbering. Thus, before heaven and earth divided, accumulated qi congealed as one, then split into two, forming husband and wife. Heaven’s bestowal descends to earth, conceiving in the dark mystery, named as *jiazi*. Its roots spread in the northeast, in *chou* and *yin*. It first appears in *mao*, completing the southeast in *chen* and *si*. Its branches hang in the south, nurtured at *wu*. Turning old in the southwest, in *wei* and *shen*. Maturing in the west, the sun sets in *you*. Fully concealed in the northwest, in *xu* and *hai*.\n\nThus, numbering begins at one and ends at ten, for this is the origin of the five thousand and the root of the five phases. Multiply one by ten, and a hundred is complete. Therefore, heaven generates within, and thus all things reach their end herein. The Dipper is established in *chen* and broken in *xu*. *Established* means to stand—thus all things desire to reach full growth. *Broken* means to decay—all things perish completely in *xu*.\n\nNumbering the eight directions of heaven and earth, ten completes the cycle. Yin and yang establish and break, thus this pattern recurs, following the Dipper’s pointer to illuminate affairs. This scripture is for dispelling harmful qi, thus it is said: “Model heaven as the standard.”\n\n*End of Tai ping jing chao, Ji Section, Scroll Six*\n*Tai ping jing chao, Geng Section, Scroll Seven*\n\nThe *Admonition on the Diagram of the Void and Spontaneous Dao’s Necessary Fulfillment*\n\nThe void is inwardly replete yet outwardly empty—being as if non-being. Reverse the womb and embryo to dwell with the Dao. Preserve only the heart, suspending dragon-like contemplation. Thus it becomes the spirit-chamber, gathering the Dao in emptiness. Roam only with qi, hence the void. In qi and spirit, all else is eliminated. With the heart as master, one attains freedom from deviation. Examine its meaning closely, never forgetting the true scripture. Attain this, and you transcend the world, roaming long within it. Why not refine your essence, only to remain with fools? Once misfortune arrives, great disaster befalls. Abandon true simplicity, and you revert to dust and ash. The wise heed the scripture’s admonition.\n\nNon-action is non-action that accomplishes all, linking with the Dao. It emerges before infancy, enters the seamless, and reaches the Great Beginning, then returns. At heaven and earth’s inception, yin and yang had their source. Enter the art of non-action, and the body may be preserved whole. To depart from root and branch is the Dao’s affliction. To leave the Great Beginning is to forfeit wholeness. The farther one strays from life, the nearer to death’s gate. Indulging in vulgar learning harms the soul and spirit. Clinging to duality while forgetting the One loses their mutual resonance. Can one not be admonished? This is the Dao’s origin.\n\nYou, who guard the One exclusively, are the wellspring of benevolence and wisdom. Heaven’s Dao moves as One, thus it remains complete. Earth’s Dao moves as Two, and neighbors with ghosts. Truly know non-action, and you align with the Dao’s utmost spirit. Reflect deeply on this matter—the perfected ones preceded you. Seal your golden gate, allowing nothing to depart. In silence without sound, the spirit endures, and qi is perfected. The gate of immortal Dao is thus attained. How effortless! The Great Dao is no longer burdensome. Heaven’s Dao, impartial, returns to the benevolent and wise.\n\nThe law of spontaneity links with the Dao. Guard it, and fortune follows; lose it, and calamity arises. All things arise self-complete, one root with myriad branches, none without spirit. Ponder its meaning, and the Dao reveals itself. Together they emerge from primal chaos through the wondrous gate, neither increasing nor diminishing, preserving spontaneity.\n\nAll things born possess spirit, and of the eighteen hundred breaths, humans are supreme. Thus one may avoid death and attain long-lasting transcendence. Those who perish early lose spontaneity—even birds and beasts endure, let alone humans. Fools despise the Dao, sinking to earth’s depths. The benevolent and wise esteem the Dao, ascending heaven’s gate. The spirit-Dao does not die; ghosts and spirits meet their end.\n\nShould you pursue this, it is like a ring without end. Beware of entering the realm of being, lest you invite harm. Neither act recklessly nor abandon restraint, lest you hasten death. Heaven and earth’s nature uniquely honors spontaneity. Each follows its course—none dare oppose it.\n\nThe Dao flourishes through non-action, the void and spontaneity. The lofty delight in it; the base disregard it. Study diligently and know your teacher—no words are forbidden. With a teacher, the Dao is clear; without one, transmission is difficult. Learning without a master’s instruction, the noble remain silent. Reckless action brings chaos; self-mutilation invites misfortune.\n\nWhen the Dao is fully prepared, spontaneity is achieved. The three Daoist scriptures are all derived from collective deliberation, taken as heaven’s trust, and their resonance brings swift efficacy. To rectify the spirit and numinous, the decision rests with the illumination of ten thousand people, taken as heaven’s trust. To correct ordinary texts, the decision rests with collation, taken as heaven’s trust.\n\nThose who wish to know the truth of this scripture may verify it through swift insight. Practice it, and it will resonate with heaven. The good will flourish daily; the evil will diminish, taken as heaven’s trust. To appoint worthy individuals, the decision rests with nine people. To discern who has entered the chamber and who has not, the decision rests with absolute clarity—no concealment or obstruction, taken as heaven’s trust.\n\nTo know if one’s body has attained the Dao and become deathless, the decision rests with the body’s transformation into spirit, thus transcending the world, taken as heaven’s trust. To thoroughly understand the meaning of this scripture, read it from beginning to end, then reflect inwardly. The heart will comprehend fully, and doubt will vanish. Once its meaning is grasped, it cannot be abandoned.\n\nTo test the efficacy of this scripture and distinguish truth from falsehood, apply it to govern toward Great Peace, taken as heaven’s trust. To know whether longevity is attainable, the decision rests with the era after Great Peace. If Great Peace has not yet come, prior generations’ disasters will cause harm, making efficacy difficult, taken as heaven’s trust.\n\nFor the Grand Yang to know Great Peace, the decision rests with the severing of metal. For water and fire to suppress and eliminate treacherous ministers and malevolent forces, the decision rests with the severing of metal and the decline of market wine. To see the great flourishing of heaven’s Dao, the decision rests with collating all texts and consulting with ordinary people.\n\nTo obtain efficacious medicine, collate all medical texts and test them. To hasten Great Peace, reveal all true texts and eliminate false ones. To delight in humanity and cease harming women, the decision rests with each residing in their place, providing according to their ability, ensuring parents are not burdened with sorrow or rebellion.\n\nTo eliminate illness and widely open the Dao, the decision rests with swallowing the cinnabar script’s characters. To know the method of compiling and practicing the scriptures, follow the text and emphasize its admonitions. Restrain yourself well, practice for a day, and a hundred harms will vanish from the heart. In an instant, all will be rectified, taken as heaven’s trust.\n\nMay I ask: what is the name of auspicious omens? Why do you persist in folly?\n\nWould the Heavenly Master not abandon me and grant me but a single word of instruction?\n\nAs for auspicious omens: they are purity, stillness, rectitude, and singular devotion—where the heart aligns with heaven and earth, never transgressing the seasons’ decrees.\n\nMay I ask: by what means can one know this purity, stillness, rectitude, and singular devotion?\n\nExcellent is your question. The nature of heaven and earth, from ancient times to the present, is such that the good bring forth goodness, the wicked bring forth wickedness, the upright bring forth uprightness, and the perverse bring forth perversity. This is the natural principle—nothing strange in it.\n\nThus, when the human heart is upright, pure, and still, and sincerity moves heaven, without any ill intent, auspicious responses and good omens converge, and so auspicious omens arise. Those who employ deceitful and false hearts in all matters of perversity receive no good response—this is the great and luminous proof of heaven and earth. Do you understand?\n\nGood and evil each have their responses. Those who fail to harmonize bring about disharmony—this is the clear evidence of heaven.\n\nExcellent. May I ask: when people do good—supreme filial children, supreme loyal ministers, supreme obedient disciples—what should they hold in highest regard toward their lord, father, and teacher? It is to present rare treasures, texts seldom seen, and thereby attain the highest.\n\nLoyal ministers, filial children, and obedient disciples should always delight in such deeds. Why then do they not present what is commonly known, but instead present what is rare?\n\nWhat is commonly known, the superior already possesses—why present it again?\n\nThis foolish student does not grasp the meaning.\n\nI shall soon make it clear to you.\n\nWhat the world deems rare and precious—things never before seen and yet of great worth—when presented to one’s lord, this is the act of a supremely loyal minister. Rare and excellent food never before seen, when presented to one’s parents, this is the act of a supremely filial child. Teachings never before heard, when presented to one’s teacher, this is the act of a supremely good disciple. Do you understand?\n\nI would hear of presenting what is already held in common.\n\nWhat the superior already possesses, yet is presented again—why?\n\nBecause all things respond accordingly, such repeated presentation does not remove the fault. Why is it so weighty?\n\nYou should not fail to understand: what people already possess in common, to present it again is wearisome—why present it once more?\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, the great sages’ determination in all matters has been to discard the common and select the rare, thereby aligning with the will of heaven and earth. This is what is meant.\n\nHeaven has two hands, and by them all things are accomplished. If one hand is afflicted with perversity and evil, nothing can be achieved. Heaven greatly resents this; earth regards it as taboo. The world falls into chaos and accomplishes nothing, all due to one hand’s perversity failing to join in effort.\n\nIn all matters, if not properly ordered, the six directions will not attain Great Peace—this too arises from the two hands, when one is afflicted with perversity and fails to join in effort. The fortune or misfortune, safety or peril that ensue all stem from these two hands.\n\nPerfected One, do you truly comprehend this deeply?\n\nWere it not for the Heavenly Master revealing its essential meaning, how could one come to know it? Those who know it remain in eternal darkness and confusion, with no way to attain understanding.\n\nThe teacher is the root of all instruction in heaven and earth’s myriad affairs—though difficult, how could one refrain from speaking of it?\n\nExcellent indeed are the Perfected One’s inquiries.\n\nIn essence, it is but □□. Be seated, and I shall explain its meaning fully for all Perfected Ones.\n\nLet the world model itself upon this and act accordingly, and no more inauspicious or chaotic affairs will arise. The gods of heaven summon and inscribe the two hands as a crucial record. When a nation practices this, it endures long; when ordinary people practice it, they enjoy lasting wealth and peace.\n\nThe essential Dao is about to emerge, near at hand within the body of every person. Now I shall distinguish and explain it for the Perfected Ones.\n\nHeaven and earth are the two hands that create and bring forth all things. The four seasons are the two hands that transmit and nourish all beings. Husband and wife are the two hands that transmit and continue the yin and yang of heaven and earth. Teacher and disciple are the two hands that transmit and communicate all matters of texts, the Dao, and virtue. Ruler and minister are the two hands that transmit and govern all matters concerning the people and the myriad things.\n\nThese six matters merely lift the guiding principles and reveal their beginnings—there is no end to what could be written. All things that require mutual support to be accomplished are the two hands. In heaven, this is called \"overlapping compasses and repeated squares\"—all things that correspond to one another.\n\nIf one hand is perverse and unequal, nothing is accomplished. In heaven, this is called \"the governance of great chaos.\" In the six directions and eight distant regions, it is called \"widows and widowers, severed lineages,\" and the days grow ever more degenerate. Nothing is accomplished because the two hands do not join in effort.\n\nMay I ask: why in heaven are they called the two hands?\n\nThe two hands signify their equal and joint effort, with no advance or retreat—only then can things be accomplished. If the two hands do not join in effort, nothing can be achieved.\n\nThus, in all matters, one must model them upon these two hands, each finding the right person to join in effort and unite in heart. Only then can this model bring peace, and the qi of Great Peace will immediately arrive. Without modeling upon these two hands, even after ten thousand myriad years, the qi of the Supreme Sovereign’s Great Peace cannot emerge.\n\nThe qi of Great Peace constantly desires to emerge, like heaven itself. Yet because the two hands have long failed to harmonize and govern, it remains blocked and unable to flow forth, pent up and resentful—all due to the two hands’ disharmony.\n\nIf the two hands are balanced and harmonious, the qi of the Supreme Sovereign’s Great Peace emerges, arriving one after another without delay.\n\nExcellent.\n\nThus, if heaven and earth do not join in effort, the myriad things have no way to emerge. If the four seasons do not join in effort, all beings have no way to grow. If the five phases do not join in effort, all things have no way to be completed. If ruler and minister do not join in effort, all affairs have no way to be governed. If husband and wife do not join in effort, descendants have no way to flourish, and the family way has no way to be established. If teacher and disciple do not join in effort, no knotted affairs can be untangled, the Dao and virtue have no way to flourish, the mists of ignorance have no way to disperse, and the great transformation of the six directions and eight distant regions has no way to proceed.\n\nTherefore, all must join in effort, just as the two hands—only then can things flow smoothly. Without modeling upon the two hands, misfortune arises, and though one may seek remedies, it is of no benefit—nothing can be accomplished.\n\nYet mere emptiness and prolonged sorrow bring only daily misfortune. Thus, in all matters resembling these two hands, selection and appointment must secure the right person. To fail in this is called \"half-dead\" by the gods above—how can one succeed or accomplish anything by acting with but a single hand? In all doubtful matters, ponder deeply this principle.\n\nWith a heart of sincerity—born of fire—return it to fire. In governing, model yourself thus, and you shall prolong your years and increase your allotted span, never failing even once. I do not deceive you. This is shown to the virtuous lord, to all people, and to the wise, each to reflect upon its meaning, that none dare transgress it. To employ it is called enriching and nurturing oneself; to neglect it is called bringing sorrow and suffering upon oneself. How wondrous!\n\nThe Dao I transmit conveys the will of Heaven. It may only advance, never retreat; only follow, never oppose. To follow is to fully attain Heaven’s favor; to oppose is to invite disorder and calamity. When human intent turns west while Heaven’s intent turns east, it is called discord with Heaven’s will. Let this be a warning to those who would understand.\n\nNow, when common people recommend scholars to present to the emperor, entrusting them to the state, securing the right person brings great fortune, while failing to do so brings great misfortune. What can be achieved with the right person? What ruin follows without them? All perfected ones must be precise and forthright in this.\n\nThus, securing the right person brings four blessings, while failing to do so brings four calamities. With the right person, Heaven and Earth, the six directions and eight distant regions are at peace; without them, they are not.\n\nWould you hear the essential meaning? When the recommended scholar is the right person, the ruler above is well-governed, affairs succeed, and constant peace prevails—daily benefiting the ruler: this is the first great blessing. The recommended person is capable and can be entrusted with office: the second blessing. Having become capable, they illuminate the Way of their teacher, extending grace to them: the third blessing. The recommended person proves trustworthy in their duties, further earning the ruler’s trust and employment: the fourth blessing. Joining in effort and with a single heart, their deeds daily succeed, monthly grow more illustrious, and yearly flourish ever more. Heaven and Earth rejoice, good omens appear in full, evil things withdraw, and the gods delight. Holding fast without fail, one may ascend to transcend the world, attain equitable governance in the middle realm, or below, preserve wholeness and complete one’s natural lifespan. Such is the goodness of recommending the right person.\n\nIn Heaven above, this is called the Talisman of Continuing Life. Why is it named the Talisman of Continuing Life? Because recommending the right person transforms danger into safety, chaos into order, failure into success, misfortune into fortune, and death into life. Above, one may transcend the world; in the middle, attain governance and peace; below, complete one’s natural lifespan and preserve one’s body.\n\nYet if the recommended scholar is not the right person, they bring no benefit to the emperor or the state, plunging governance into disorder. The emperor suffers in every way, Heaven and Earth are displeased, and thieves, bandits, and myriad disasters arise: this is the first great calamity. The recommended person cannot govern their office, deceit and falsehood daily increase, and long-standing unrest ensues. They cannot preserve their natural lifespan, may be harmed by Heaven and Earth’s spirits, or murdered by others, bringing disgrace to their parents and spreading evil to their wives, children, and descendants—known as a wicked person for their faults: this is the second great calamity. Their wickedness leads to the abandonment of their learning, defiling the sacred work of former sages and bringing disaster to their teacher: the third great calamity. Moreover, the recommender is untrustworthy, deceiving their ruler, presenting the wrong person, disrupting Heaven’s order, and defiling the constellations. Heaven detests them, Earth resents them, the ruler despises them, and sages condemn them—called a great deceiver and liar of the age. For this, they shall be punished: if not by Heaven, Earth, and the spirits, then by people. Their ancestors are disgraced, and disaster befalls their wives and children: this is the fourth great calamity.\n\nTo commit these four great calamities by recommending the wrong person brings sorrow to the emperor. Harmful qi stirs and cannot be restrained; disorder spreads without end, each fault compounding the last. Heaven and Earth grow furious, ministers contend, the six directions are displeased, the eight distant regions fall into discord, and eternal disorder ensues. In Heaven above, this is called the Talisman of Diminished Years and Shortened Life. Why is it named the Talisman of Shortened Life? Because order reverts to disorder, long years become few, and all undertakings meet misfortune, bringing no benefit to oneself. Heaven and Earth are displeased, deducting from one’s allotted span and diminishing one’s years—thus, it is called the Talisman of Shortened Life in Heaven above.\n\nExcellent indeed! This celestial text is shown to the virtuous lord, to all people and the wise, extending even to the common folk.\n\nWhen one in high position seeks worthy officers, one must be meticulous; when one in low position recommends them, one must be loyal. If later generations transmit and recite this text, treasuring it in their hearts, yet hastily appoint officers without adhering to its principles, Heaven and Earth will no longer be pleased. To know the Way yet deliberately violate it—how severe will the punishment be! Take heed.\n\nThis celestial text resolves the Six Extremities, gathering the great assembly of Heaven above. In the eighth month, the books are reviewed, mirroring the laws of Heaven and Earth to eliminate disasters and harms. Only the Dao of highest antiquity, wherein one cultivates the self and rectifies one’s conduct, dares not transgress what the divine spirits have transgressed, yet dares to seek life and plead for survival from the Heavenly Lord. One dares not act wantonly, fearing imperfection. Daily, one contemplates the vitality of life, becoming one with the divine spirits, manifesting their kind. Desiring to receive words of utmost loyalty and integrity, one clarifies right and wrong with the spirits governing all departments, then dares to trust in the principles of justice and injustice—how could there be a moment’s forgetfulness?\n\nAbove, there are those who observe humanity, fully discerning right and wrong. What can be concealed? What can be disbelieved? Thus, one attains self-governance, seeking and reflecting on the root. Never has there been the slightest boundary of unvirtuous conduct. One merely cherishes being human, relying on and revering the primordial qi, enabling all creeping and moving creatures to avoid witnessing calamities and anomalies.\n\nYet people betray trust in their sworn words, neither party believing the other, hence the lack of peace. Within the harmony of Heaven and Earth, above and below each maintain their trust, but people fail to grasp its essence. Humans consume the qi of the Five Constants, receiving and relying on nothing they do not partake of, yet losing goodness and following evil, their lives incomplete—why is this so? Thus, the Heavenly Lord declares that there is always good and evil, and those who ought to uphold justice. Therefore, errors and evils clarify the intent of Heaven and Earth, the Four Seasons, and the Five Phases, enabling understanding that the completion of life is paramount, extending one’s years and lifespan. People attain the Dao of life and completion, adhering to its prohibitions without negligence.\n\nFrom this, it is clear that Heaven knows the foolish are shallow, lacking any intent of requital. To oppose Heaven’s actions is to contradict its works, amplifying human misdeeds—reversing the proper order to condemn the living and favor the wicked. Thus, the sage understands the convergence of yin and yang, the worthy govern right and wrong, resolving what is unknown, enabling each to fulfill their duty without resentment. The good naturally enjoy long life; the evil naturally suffer short lives—what is there to doubt or resent?\n\nThe virtuous inscribe the writings of goodness, not losing their pattern, their constancy, or their appropriateness—this is called supreme virtue. Nothing is left unaccomplished, nothing unachieved. They do not lose their clarity, their substance, the generation and completion of yin and yang, the ingress and egress of the life-generating qi governed by the Four Seasons, the completion of the Five Phases, the celestial bodies of sun, moon, and stars, their measurements, the timing of fortune and misfortune, the transformations of calamities and anomalies, the records of floods and droughts, or the length of human life—nor do they lose the intent of the thickness or thinness bestowed by the constellations. This is what the supremely virtuous ought to practice.\n\nThus, the virtuous person illuminates all, sees all, harmonizing above, below, and the center, each according with its proper place. Following their virtue, none lose their rightful name—this is called aligning with constancy. The writings of long life bestow glory upon all things: rocks split and sprout, branches hang and leaves spread to serve as clothing, mist, dew, snow, frost, and timely rain serve as drink and food. Growth and completion occur naturally, covering and bearing blossoms and fruit, providing for the people and the earth’s longevity. Named the \"water mother\" and called \"melon\" by the people, in the height of summer it serves as water and broth, relied upon by all under Heaven, consumed by all.\n\nSuch is the virtuous person who inherits Heaven’s mandate, completes Heaven’s form, and looks to Earth to provide for the people’s sustenance. Practicing reflection and bestowing generosity, none are left without virtue to satiate themselves—this is Heaven’s grace. What Heaven bestows to generate life is vast. To disobey its mandate and speak of spontaneity is to rebel.\n\nThus, the virtuous person, understanding Heaven’s intent, teaches the people to establish laws without losing Heaven’s favor, nurturing and raising them to maturity, enabling them to become human, to comprehend patterns and principles, to cultivate virtue and achieve completion, and to ascend to the ranks of Heaven’s officers. In Heaven’s affairs, merits and labors are differentiated.\n\nThe virtuous person, presiding over Earth’s affairs, commands the people to rely on and revere, deeply witnessing grace and bestowal, yet unable to requite it in due time. When the virtuous act on Heaven’s behalf, moving qi above, below, and at the center, those who do not receive their proper place scorn Heaven’s works. This is precisely what provokes Heaven’s unceasing wrath, causing the divine spirits to cease loving humanity, encroaching upon and seizing their years and lifespan. People then resent and blame Heaven, so the divine texts are sent down to prevent transgressions.\n\nWhen one receives great kindness, even a single contrary thought or effort to do good is sufficient. Yet if one remains long in doubt and suspicion, clinging to past grievances, one harms oneself, living in constant dread, unaware of the cause. Heaven endows humans with knowledge of good and evil, and those who practice goodness with sincerity—Heaven does not wish people to have an evil reputation. Thus, desiring to cling to life and abhor death, one dares not violate prohibitions, as if they were harmful to oneself.\n\nTherefore, following the qi of Heaven and communicating with the words of the enlightened, one speaks of the body’s comings and goings, understanding human sentiments. Seeing unvirtuous conduct, one retreats and self-reproaches, fearing that one’s name may be sullied in the celestial records. As one’s intentions at the time are applied to others, one dares not face them directly to explain complexities, but accepts the reproach for one’s actions. Striving to reflect, one considers the progress of one’s merits from birth, resolving the inherited burdens of one’s ancestors. When these burdens are removed and resolved, and transgressions exhausted, one may ascend.\n\nTo alternate between good and evil is to toy with one’s fate. Moreover, the good ought to endure temporary hardship, applying effort without negligence, and later receive blessings. When life speaks of enduring trials, accepting admonitions, and retiring to a tranquil place to reflect on one’s faults and self-reproach—these thoughts arise from within, and the celestial spirits know them. Do not grow weary. To foresee the Heavenly Lord’s intentions and actions is to be the foremost person, worthy to stand at the Heavenly Lord’s left side.\n\nThose with meritorious deeds receive rewards, yet in humility dare not advance to accept greater benefits, instead exhausting their sinews and strength, applying their minds with utmost care for the great Dao. Thus, the Heavenly Lord values them anew, personally admonishing and instructing them—this is the blessing of life. To govern many with an impartial heart is sufficient in itself. To say, \"I dare not,\" is to aspire to stand at the Heavenly Lord’s left side, merely to live on.\n\nOnly think of loyalty and filial piety, following principle to fulfill one’s duty. Dare not accept heavy rewards, fearing one’s lack of merit. Upon hearing of another’s transgressions, aid them in repentance. Examine and restrain one’s conduct, preventing violations, and contemplate the Heavenly Lord’s will. Knowing goodness, act with goodness; knowing trustworthiness, act with trustworthiness; knowing loyalty, act with loyalty; knowing compliance, act with compliance; knowing filial piety, act with filial piety—thus, evil deeds shall no longer advance. No transgression, great or small, escapes the Heavenly Lord’s knowledge. The register of good and ill is thinly inscribed, and each year, month, and day, accounts are tallied before and after. Years are deducted, lifespan reduced; if evil persists unceasingly, one faces the Ghost Gate. The Earth Spirit summons and interrogates, comparing their deeds and words for consistency. After painful reflection upon principle, only then do they submit. Their name is sent to the celestial bureaus, and when their allotted tally is exhausted, they are cast into the ranks of the Great Transgressors, drifting through later generations—such is the consequence of evil.\n\nOne desires to gain advantage from others, yet others do not wish to advantage them. Good advantage brings life; evil advantage is short-lived, for goodness does not long abide upon the earth. Thus, Heaven and Earth’s advantages are not evenly distributed. Heaven causes one to act with goodness, bestowing life, yet one turns to evil—how can the spirits and gods not afflict them with suffering? Whom can they blame? This text thus first advances goodness and retreats from evil—an ancient and enduring scripture.\n\nLife’s mandate lies close within your own body—why knock upon your heart and cry out to Heaven? If your body does not purify itself, whom shall you purify? If your body does not cherish itself, whom shall you cherish? If your body does not perfect itself, whom shall you perfect? If your body does not reflect upon itself, whom shall you reflect upon? If your body does not reproach itself, whom shall you reproach? Ponder these words: do not resent the spirits and gods. For evil, you alone bear the burden, not others—do you understand this?\n\nAct in accordance with what has been said, and let it never depart from your heart. Departure from it is ruin, irreparable, and you shall share the ranks of ghosts—how then shall you live? To reflect upon life is to attain life. How can one, dwelling between Heaven and Earth, forget the grace of Heaven and Earth? What manner of being is this? If you desire Heaven’s recompense, you must reproach yourself with sincerity and sorrow, weeping as you act, saying, \"I, favored by grace, am made human, distinct from the myriad things. Heaven has granted me distinction—speech, perception of beauty and ugliness, knowledge of good and evil, right and wrong. I must be meticulous in my conduct.\" To speak words contrary to Heaven’s decree, refusing compliance, is to be a person of great treason and impiety—how could Heaven long abide with such a one?\n\nIf the admonitions received remain unclear, retire to a quiet place to reflect, reproaching yourself for the burdens you bear, and offering thanks to the spirits of Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, the Five Phases, and all the divine departments. The Heavenly Lord listens keenly, bidding you to ponder within. The people of antiquity all possessed wisdom and foresight, dared not transgress prohibitions, and regulated themselves with rectitude, fearing any lapse. At every movement, they acted in accordance with the mandate, lest they lose their years and lifespan. For this reason, they dared not slacken even slightly. For every transgression, there was punishment, and thus they examined and cherished themselves, revering prohibitions and daring not act contrary to the will. When reproached and questioned, their hearts trembled with fear, their qi dispirited and lost, bearing the displeasure of Heaven. Even the slightest misalignment was deemed unworthy, and the text’s complexity often led to thorough investigation and verification. Their words and trustworthiness could be named as honor, and throughout life, they yearned and aspired, aligning with Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, and the Five Phases, bearing the mandate together, daring not commit even the smallest error.\n\nTruly, with the heart, one seeks advancement and searches for life. Only the great spirits review and approve one’s words, allowing one to witness the Four Seasons and Five Phases in their generation and transformation, and to see the difficulty of repaying the sun and moon. One fears being cast aside midway. Those who rightly cultivate the Dao dare not distance themselves, for the Way of the ancient sages arose naturally. Knowing the principles of Heaven above, all their actions are foreknown. Even the faintest sound and echo are understood, and their form and countenance are self-evident. Their hearts are luminous, their intentions clear. They know the matters to be saved, the meetings of fortune and misfortune—all is distinctly apparent. Within, their hearts rejoice, for they know they have received Heaven’s blessing. Witnessing the events of their past conduct, they are all the more vigilant and steadfast.\n\nReflecting that they have been favored and honored, the great spirits repeatedly admonish and instruct them, ensuring they do not falter. Gazing to the four horizons, above and below all is open and unobstructed. Within their hearts, they rejoice anew, gaining extended years and hearing what was previously unknown—all through the transforming power of the Heavenly Lord and the great spirits. The great spirits declare: \"All the spirits know this. Those whose lives are extended have their fate recorded in the true registers. Before birth, their years, months, days, and hours are inscribed in the Bureau of Longevity. When the appointed time arrives, their names ascend, and their deeds are proclaimed, governed by the Perfected of the Northern Culmen. Their bones are transformed, their bodies become light and lustrous. At the appointed hour, they receive the elixir, refining their essence and brilliance. Wherever they manifest, all is accomplished. They emerge from the profound and enter the obscure—what is not accessible to them?\"\n\nOnly those of antiquity who attained the Dao followed this method. Before birth, their names were recorded in the registers of longevity. When the year, month, day, and hour of their ascension arrive, their names are transmitted to the Central Culmen. The Central Culmen is also called Kunlun, where the governing spirits record their names without omission. They are made to move their limbs, bending and stretching, turning and complying, repeatedly admonished. Following their master through trials, they are given the elixir to drink. Their joints open and are refined. Though not immediately apparent, over time, one knows whether they are firm or not, demonstrating their unyielding resolve.\n\nCraving life and detesting death, they contemplate the affairs of Heaven above. Repeatedly, they are sent to verify the allotted years, to know the prohibitions they must observe. These are transmitted to disciples, and even without divine texts, they speak as if presenting their own books. The spirits know their words, which are also connected to the years and months. After accumulating one thousand three hundred and twenty days, they are led to meet the great spirits, to communicate with the primordial qi, and to act in accordance with nature.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord receives the secret decrees and examines conduct, permitting no private trust or wavering of intent, ensuring no errors in action. The Great Spirits declare: \"We have calculated the provisions bestowed by all spirits. On the last day of the eighth month, we record the registers of all mountains, seas, ridges, and pools, as well as the waterways, rivers, bridges, Huai, Ji, Yangtze, and lakes—all accounts of ingress and egress—each clearly distinguished.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Lord, when bestowing rewards for labor, personally reviews and verifies the records stored in the golden chambers. Those of sincere heart are appointed to attend the Heavenly Lord’s inquiries, and they must heed the teachings day and night without slackening. The appointed overseers must not fail in their duties, and those of sincere heart must ensure the registers are settled.\n\nThere are spirit-envoys who calculate the names of those destined to ascend. One hundred days prior, all documents must be submitted without omission. If any document is inconsistent or the accounting office fails to act, all involved shall be held accountable. The prior decree forbade transgressing the divine texts. Three years and eight months after this text’s issuance, it may be shown to the common people. If there are those of Daoist faith, it may be revealed to them.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord instructs: \"This person bore prior burdens, and the decree commands the spirits to resolve and conceal them. Those not yet concealed shall be concealed.\" The Great Spirits say: \"This person has long suffered poverty and emptiness, fearing they cannot endure. Having gained the Heavenly Lord’s trust, the spirits are ordered to conceal their fate.\"\n\nThose who previously received decrees and expressed gratitude for the grace—though the appointed time has not yet arrived—shall be informed one month in advance. The Heavenly Lord declares: \"Among the spirits, generals, soldiers, and armor under my command below, do not miss the appointed time for concealment. Record their names, so the earthly lords may show reverence, and spirits may come and go. If they seek to fulfill their wishes, permit it. Let future affairs turn from evil toward good, avoiding transgressions, so they may again behold the Dao’s teachings and transformations, none disobeying.\"\n\nThus, the overseers are made wings to guide the beginning and end, completing their tasks like fortified cities, clearly discernible. Knowing the great transformations above and harmonizing the primordial *qi*, they also understand human affairs. These are people of fortune and destiny, all foreknown. Following their transformations, their allotted years may be extended, and Heaven cherishes them. Benevolent spirits guard them, shielding them from harm. Their hearts incline toward goodness, and evil cannot claim them.\n\nThus, Heaven values goodness, allowing wishes to be fulfilled without encroachment or conflict, as it should be. Heaven further extends their years, bestowing this great favor. Repayment is not in jewels or treasures but in writing sincerity, returning to earnest faith, and not betraying one’s words—this is repayment.\n\nWhen Heaven witnesses good deeds, they must be concealed, not shared, for fortune and misfortune follow. Only those who align with the great sagely and virtuous may receive the primordial *qi*’s natural radiance, moving the Great Spirits. They fully understand what is to be bestowed, always aligning with Heaven’s will, never losing the intent of the primordial *qi*. They constantly act above to assist the Great Spirits, like ministers serving a state. Their hearts know the Great Spirits’ directives, and the documents they submit are interconnected. Each memorial is fittingly presented, and the right person is chosen to safeguard their words. They act on the Heavenly Lord’s behalf, and upon receiving the texts, they transmit them without delay, receiving the grace of audience above.\n\nThe Great Sage should know: How could the Heavenly Lord’s decrees ever fail? The worldly do not understand, assuming it is like mortal officials—how could they know the celestial decrees and their proper transmission? In Heaven’s affairs, voices carry across distances—how could anything be hidden? This is naturally scrutinized, and thus the Heavenly Lord foreknows day and night, within Heaven, Earth, and the harmony between, all great and small, even the most secret matters. How could the spirits act freely?\n\nThus, the beginning and end of good and evil are recorded, and the spirits document them. The Heavenly Lord personally follows the monthly and stellar configurations, governing without fail, all rectified and untransgressed. Thus, it is said Heaven sends forth its decrees.\n\nThe spirit within the human abdomen sees afar and communes with Heaven, their voices heard—how could they not know the people’s good and evil? The Heavenly Lord says: \"Those with good faith are elevated; those without are demoted. Not only Heaven desires the faithful—so too does the harmony of Earth below.\" People do not deeply understand future affairs, so those of sincere heart must persevere. Persevering, they walk the same path as the Great Spirits, drawing near to Heaven. Like loyal ministers and virtuous officials who never leave their lord’s side—yet people do not trust Heaven. How could Heaven trust those of divided heart?\n\nThose who ascend to Heaven in broad daylight, seeking life with their names recorded, are listed in the Northern Culmen Heavenly Lord’s inner registers. How could the faithless be inscribed? Those of early and steadfast heart shall ultimately ride the refined *qi*, acting on Heaven’s behalf.\n\nWithin Heaven, Earth, and their harmony, all should follow Heaven’s grace to live—yet many disbelieve. This is the gravest sin; how can they hope the celestial spirits will take notice? If the worldly repent, toiling day and night, accumulating years, they may be pardoned and their names presented to the Heavenly Lord.\n\nThose who reproach themselves shall have their names transferred by the spirits of life’s register to the Bureau of Longevity, where the One Hundred and Twenty Envoys grant them continued generations. The poor shall have descendants. Those Heaven destroys have persisted in evil, harming others—thus, they are cut off\n\nThose of ancient times who attained immortality and transcended the world—how could they ever harbor evil thoughts? They beheld writings on loyalty and filial piety, revered and served their parents, lived in harmony with their siblings, and maintained no distinction between inner and outer. Above and below, all were united, aligning with Heaven’s great prohibitions. The Celestial Lord governs all, receiving mandates for fixed terms—how could one act with self-indulgence? A heart of loyalty and filial piety never strays from the will of Heaven and Earth, aiding the four seasons and the five phases, never daring to harm the living beings of their time.\n\nOnly the Most High’s benevolent ones act thus, accumulating deeds before Heaven. Heaven hears and trusts them, dispatching them to assist the Eastern August One in arranging all living things, bestowing blossoms and fruits to feed the people, ensuring warmth and sustenance. Their bodies grow robust, nurturing one another in turn; yin and yang unite, male and female take form, the old and young follow in succession, receiving their allotted lifespans from Heaven’s decree. The twenty-eight lunar lodges rotate in mutual completion, while the sun and moon illuminate without fail, taking turns to sustain life—how could there be any slackening?\n\nYet people do not know that lifespans vary in length, that spring, summer, autumn, and winter bring impermanence in life and death. Thus, the spirits oversee the shifting of destinies, increasing or decreasing the tally of years, passing them on in turn. Therefore, it is said that the four seasons, five phases, sun, moon, and stars all govern human life: the good have their years extended, the wicked have theirs diminished. The severity of transgressions is measured by fixed standards. Between Heaven above and Earth below, all is interwoven like inner and outer, with myriad spirits appointed to relay commands. Thus, when the Celestial Lord issues decrees to the bureaus, each transfers them in turn, serving as the current celestial tally—no private favor is permitted. From ancient times to the present, how could any escape?\n\nOnly the Most High’s virtuous ones act thus, for they discern the affairs Heaven and Earth are to carry out, each with its own charge, its own decree, its own cultivation, its own spirit, its own merit, its own loyalty, its own governance, its own bestowal upon others, its own path of advancement. Each gains the trust of Heaven and Earth, never straying from the generative and transformative work of the four seasons and five phases. Thus, the Most High’s virtuous ones receive Heaven’s trust, Earth’s protection, and the five phases’ confidence, never violating any prohibitions. They constantly aspire to perfect others, delighting in goodness, aligning with the will of Heaven and Earth’s divine spirits, penetrating from outer to inner, achieving success in their own bodies. They are inscribed in the register of long life and enduring vision, permitted to serve alongside Heaven and Earth’s great spirits. From loyalty and sincerity toward Heaven, they uphold the great transformation.\n\nThus, Heaven does not thwart human aspirations, nor does Earth deny human peace. Day and night, they reflect on karmic debts and burdens, fearing they may fail to meet the Celestial Lord’s expectations—how could they hesitate to repay with loyalty and filial piety? Only the Most High’s enlightened ones foresee Heaven’s affairs, knowing what to enact and what remains undone. Their actions arise naturally, determined by their conduct. Thus, they understand the inner and outer of good and evil, and all they do comes to fruition. Revering and emulating the divine, they perfect their merit and name their virtue. They commune with the great spirits in speech, walk the Dao, and advance their knowledge.\n\nOnly the Most High’s mindful ones each know their allotted domain, each with their own Dao, their own conduct, their own compliance, their own advancement, their own declarations, their own words, their own destinations, their own movements. Their hearts are bound within, constantly striving to fulfill loyalty and filial piety, truly serving Heaven. Accumulating deeds over the years, they never slacken or forget gratitude. They seek the Most High’s precepts to preserve their lives—how could they dare neglect the four directions? They submit to Heaven’s knowledge, their understanding extending to what is yet to come, their hearts fixed on the great spirits. In their advancement and declarations, they dare not rely on their own judgment, but constantly gather the spirits in counsel, discerning what may be adopted or not, ever fearful of failing to win the spirits’ trust.\n\nWhen Heaven prospers, nations descend in radiant submission. Former masters, sages, and the Dao of Heaven and Earth’s joyous spirits emerge to aid humanity, granting long life and driving back the four barbarians. The formless divine beings of old sought the Dao of life, aligning their aspirations with the primal *qi*, never losing its intent. Their illumination pervades the four directions; their soundless voices emerge and enter above and below, all in accord with the law. The spirits and refined *qi* all come of their own accord, attending to their countenance. Fearing to lose their favor, all under their charge tremble in reverence. Their robes and sandals transform to match their hearts, bestowing kindness and spreading grace. Their fame flows above and below, reaching the eight extremities beyond the four directions, extending even to the earliest sages. Covered by their vast kindness, all respectfully uphold their commands, moving the august spirits.\n\nMoving between Heaven and Earth, their light reaches the sun, moon, and stars, drawing brightness from before them. The twenty-eight lunar lodges proclaim in turn, examining the people’s use of the heavenly stems and earthly branches, the patterns of fortune and misfortune. Yet few people understand. Assuming themselves wise, their actions and rest bring no benefit to Heaven, inviting calamity and the severance of their lineage, leaving their ancestors without worship. When the three *qi* are not in harmony, those who admonish with goodness are favored; those who do not await their destined end beneath the earth, their misfortunes flowing to their descendants. This is Heaven’s decree—how can one escape?\n\nHeaven has its four pillars, Earth has its four pillars; thus, the sun and moon push one another in turn. The stars have their degrees and measures, illuminating right and wrong. People have their nobility and baseness, their lifespans long or short, receiving their mandate from the six *jia*. Birth comes early or late, good and evil reside in different places, not a fraction of an ounce is lost. Yet people of the world do not know this, assuming there is no truth. Only by harmonizing with the divine spirits can one be called human. Those who win the trust of the divine spirits, who gain Heaven’s response—Heaven’s spirits elevate them. Those who gain Earth’s response—Earth’s spirits nurture them. Those who gain the response of harmony—human and ghostly spirits protect them. Those who gain a good response—goodness matches goodness; those who gain an evil response—evil follows evil. All have their roots, pervading above and below.\n\nThose who wish for inherently good and unopposed people make them the *shi*-people. The spirits of the land desire good people. Each imposes prohibitions, communicating above with Heaven. Those who do evil and violate them bring ruin upon themselves.\n\nOfficials, great or small, derive their authority from the people’s karmic conditions. They ought to clarify their duties and not become a source of suffering for the people. Those with exceptional abilities who cherish the Dao, virtue, benevolence, and kindness align with Heaven’s principles, Earth’s will, and the intent of harmony. They contemplate how to be seen by the good spirits, each maintaining their own integrity and never deceiving the ignorant. They do not violate Heaven’s prohibitions or Earth’s punishments, comply with the four seasons, and avoid the reputation of killing. The Five Phases each have their proper domains—let each guard its own.\n\nThose who cherish life receive Heaven’s protection; those who cherish nourishment receive Earth’s assistance; those who cherish benevolence are beloved by all. Those who do evil are Heaven’s enemies. Heaven knows their wickedness and sends malevolent spirits and vicious ghosts to enter their bodies, spreading through their limbs, head, face, abdomen, back, chest, flanks, and the Seven Governors. It ascends to the Hall of Light, manifesting in seventy-two forms—this is the gateway to death. Heaven cherishes human life; Earth cherishes human nourishment; people cherish human generosity. To do evil is to invite calamity that cannot be saved.\n\nThis is proclaimed in the Heavenly Scriptures. The words of the divine sages of antiquity never strayed from the fundamental principles; they had their own laws and standards, and people could not lightly transgress their prohibitions. Those in ancient times who attained the Dao of Great Peace simply upheld Heaven’s laws and did not violate its prohibitions—they became the peaceful subjects of the realm. Heaven possesses inexhaustible grain and boundless clothing; those who accumulate merit advance and receive their emoluments.\n\nIn the most ancient times, the divine sages foresaw future events and governed together with Heaven. They distributed authority across the four directions, above and below, and the center, each with its own jurisdiction. Above and below observed one another, and order was achieved without coercion—all was good. Fearing they might not align with Heaven’s will, Heaven sent forth its teachings, and they hastened to carry them out, each holding their records, aligning themselves without movement. Fearing inquiry, they acted with discipline, ensuring their conduct was proper. In spring, they cultivated qi; in summer, they fostered growth; in autumn, they gathered harvests so the people could offer sacrifices; in winter, they stored surplus grain to sustain continuity. Without slackening, the spirits’ bestowals brought glory to all, extending even to crawling creatures and plants—each received its due.\n\nThus, the wealthy were encouraged to lend and aid the poor, replacing the old with the new, enabling life and growth to be passed down to descendants. This was protected by the spirits—such was the great taboo. The officials of Heaven, Earth, the four seasons, the Five Phases, and the multitude of spirits directly oversee human destiny and emoluments. They must be revered and their kindness remembered and repaid.\n\nHasten to entrust this text to a virtuous ruler, so they may know Heaven’s love for humanity—and how humanity, in turn, fails to reciprocate. The *Dongji Jing*, known as the *Scripture of Great Peace*, brings fortune to those who practice it; those who do not will bring ruin upon themselves, their bodies never parting from suffering, for retribution is never unjust. Those who have long been remiss in this and have harmed others—people, regardless of status, are all born of Heaven. Love them, be cautious of them, think of them, and take care not to wrongfully harm or oppress others. Those who encroach and exploit will receive no response from Heaven, no sustenance from Earth, and malevolent spirits will follow them, cutting short their lives. The spirits of prayer and sacrifice will grow ever more enraged.\n\nWhen you see goodness, advance it; when you see evil, retreat from it. What doubt can there be? Each acts according to their own strength, lest the spirits lead them astray. If one’s dwelling is unsettled, they should leave the old for the new, and the spirits will return. Only Heaven and Earth, from their very beginnings, formed their essences, upholding the natural order. All that is transformed and generated thereby attains glory. Through this system, the mechanisms of the sun, moon, and stars govern the seasons, while the Five Planets each report to their respective directions, carrying out their duties, dispersing clouds and rain.\n\nThe people’s concerns are overseen by the Ministry of Agriculture, and the primordial qi gathers and lingers. All plants, crawling creatures, those that creep and slither, and those that breathe—all contain primordial qi. Birds that fly, beasts that run, and creatures of the water are the same, enabling the people to use them for sacrifices and sustenance. Those not used by the people are left for the animals to consume. Yet today’s wicked people kill indiscriminately, even those with child in the womb, turning the living into the dead to feed their mouths. At the moment of killing, all tremble in fear. Thus, Heaven, in its sincerity, pities them and establishes prohibitions; those who violate them are punished accordingly.\n\nEven the six livestock are cherished and not harmed without cause, yet people, who should value themselves, instead act as rebels and bandits, taking without restraint. Though they may not be immediately punished, their transgressions accumulate. Killing and destruction will not cease, leading to the annihilation of households and descent into ignominy. Even the unborn will not encounter fortune. The spirits pity them, and the overseers stand before them—when will they escape?\n\nThus, the weight of good and evil is recorded. The Perfected Ones share this text with the people, fearing it might be concealed, so they have adapted it to common script for clarity. Therefore, gain the trust of Heaven, gain the trust of Earth, gain the trust of harmony, and gain the trust of the Five Phases—all are the responses of Heaven’s trust. Not a fraction is lost—do you understand? This is the natural transformation of the qi entrusted to us.\n\nThe Three Terraces and Seven Stars assist in rectifying Heaven’s authority. The sun and moon illuminate right and wrong, ensuring each receives its natural retribution. Again, the commands are issued to all department heads, each to make their duties clear. Those who receive punishment have no cause for resentment—this is the meaning of it.\n\nThe records of disasters and calamities reappear every three *jiazi* cycles to restore order, but it would be better to admonish ten times so they may understand. Strive to seek knowledge and understanding—even the worthy and sagely can attain it. The sage should promote the worthy, seek life without evil, and then advance to the register of immortals and transcendents, located in the Northern Culmen, connected to Kunlun. The Perfected Ones of Kunlun’s ruins maintain constancy above and below, overseeing the registers of names, arranged in order. The high attain the high, the middling attain the middling, and the low attain the low. The first to arrive become teachers, revered as lords, honored as fathers. Thus, teachers, lords, and fathers must be enlightened; ministers must be loyal; disciples must be obedient, respecting and following their superiors.\n\nHeaven does not forget the teacher’s kindness; Earth does not forget the teacher’s nourishment; people do not forget the teacher’s generosity. Heaven employs the Three Luminaries to illuminate harmony, Earth, and the depths below, without ceasing.\n\nIn a land devoid of virtue, yin qi obscures the sun, leaving it without light. The people live in fear, grain scarcely multiplies, and floods and droughts come without pattern, forcing them to wander toward fertile regions. Heaven takes pity on them, guiding them to dwell in places of vitality. Where there is an enlightened ruler, the state prospers; displaced people return to till abandoned fields, and all grains grow to ripeness. The people regain their sustenance, once more offering to their ancestors, and the spirits find peace.\n\nAmong them are the wise and sagacious who seek the registers and records of immortals and transcendents, where their names are inscribed. They are to become Heaven’s officers, traversing the land among the people, harmonizing wind and rain to bring stable governance. Through this text, they too shall be born into later generations. Thus, one must perform good deeds to benefit Heaven.\n\nFrom this point onward, admonish your descendants: the span of extended years may yet be attained. The text reiterates this, for Heaven deeply cherishes humanity and desires that all fulfill their natural lifespans. Its exhortations are earnest and repeated, entrusted to the spirits. The good are recorded above, while the wicked have their names forgotten. Do not defy this text; let its meaning dwell in your heart.\n\nIn Heaven above, there is a pattern—a root for seeking life. This is what people desire, and thus this text is set forth. If one has transgressions, let them repent in accordance with it. The divine spirits are ever before and behind you, without ceasing.\n\nWhen the qi of Great Peace arrives in full, people need only face one another in daily leisure, keeping musical instruments at hand as a constant practice. Through this, they harmonize and transform one another, benefiting the state above and bringing the qi of Heaven into balance. The world is permeated by its virtue and teaching, free from misfortune.\n\nIs harmony or disharmony not the proof of this? Those who align with the will of Heaven and Earth cause Heaven and Earth to harmonize, and people emulate this with joy. When Heaven, Earth, and humanity are in harmonious delight, all things are free from illness, and rulers and ministers remain in constant gladness. This is the arrival of the qi of Great Peace, the joy of music made complete.\n\nThus, when music attains the great *jue* and upper *jue* tones, the Azure Emperor rejoices greatly, and the virtue and power of benevolence emerge. All things delight in life, the liver’s qi is free from illness, and the liver spirit emerges from the East. Evil is entirely dispelled, while goodness advances to assist transformation. Azure-clad jade maidens bring rare remedies to bestow upon people—this is the clear proof.\n\nWhen the middle *jue* tone is attained, the transformation of water is balanced. When the lower *jue* is attained, it transforms the lower realms.\n\nWhen the *zhi* tones of the South, great and small, are all in harmony, all things rejoice in longevity. The virtue of the South knows no displeasure; evil descends and departs, while goodness advances entirely. The red qi rejoices fully, and the Vermilion Emperor comes to wander. The heart is free from illness, and the heart spirit appears, awaiting the arrival of red-clad jade maidens who bring rare remedies to bestow upon people—this is the proof.\n\nThus, when the harmony of the yellow qi and *gong* tones is attained, all good *gong* tones come forth, while evil is entirely dispelled. When the harmony of the *shang* tones is attained, all good *shang* tones come forth, while evil is entirely dispelled. When the harmony of the *yu* tones is attained, all good *yu* tones come forth, while evil is entirely dispelled.\n\nPerfected Ones, ponder this meaning deeply—it is what brings about Great Peace. The reason the five directions are not explained in full is that for the loftiest scholars, seeing one aspect allows them to grasp the whole, and comprehending one principle encompasses ten thousand. To reveal it fully might induce overwhelming joy. If lesser people were to obtain it, they might speak recklessly. Therefore, it is not fully disclosed, so that each may contemplate its meaning.\n\nThe highest scholars can take one principle to encompass ten thousand, thoroughly understanding its intent. The middling scholars may gradually come to know it, while the lowest scholars, if they obtain it, would only speak recklessly. Thus, the text presents the essentials in brief, outlining the matters to guide ordinary people, so they may ponder its meaning and thereby achieve understanding from top to bottom without error.\n\nTherefore, the highest scholars govern music to enact non-action and transcend the world; the middling scholars govern music to harmonize the customs of the people and bring order; the lowest scholars govern music merely to entertain people and summon sustenance. These three types of people each comprehend the arrival of the qi of Great Peace and follow their own pursuits, playing lutes and zithers as they will. Take care not to prohibit this, for prohibition stifles the qi of music, making governance difficult to pacify. If it is not pacified, qi contends and disputes arise, leading to excessive punishment.\n\nMusic brings joy, while punishment brings suffering—like echo and shadow, not a fraction is lost. Music is meant to quell anger, just as anger is meant to quell joy. These two alternate: when there is joy, anger ceases; when there is anger, joy ceases. Thus, anger gives rise to punishment and is the root of conflict. Joy, however, is the gateway to virtue and power.\n\nTherefore, one must follow joy to cultivate the root of virtue and power, never suppressing it. To suppress it is to open the gate to calamity and punishment. From this arise fortune and misfortune, safety and danger. Thus, music is yang, and punishment is yin. Yin and yang are inherently opposed: when yang wanes, yin waxes; when yin waxes, yang wanes.\n\nYang is the ruler, yin the minister. When the ruler is strong, the minister submits, and the people are easily governed. When the minister is strong, the ruler is disrespected and chaos ensues—this is the natural law of Heaven. Therefore, one must follow the ruler’s joy to restrain the people and ministers, curbing their frequent anger.\n\nPeople of later ages were foolish and did not deeply understand this meaning, instead often severing it. Thus, yin qi flourished while yang qi declined. When yang qi flourishes, there are many thieves and criminals, and the myriad things do not grow. When harmed by excessive yin, great misfortune lies here.\n\nWhen the ruler’s qi flourishes, it brings extended years and increased longevity. When the ruler is joyful, the virtues of the five directions emerge entirely; when angry, the evils of the five directions emerge entirely. Thus, great joy brings forth good responses, while lack of joy brings forth evil responses—this is the natural principle. How deeply one must be admonished!\n\nIn my text, the good are all depicted with azure heads and cinnabar eyes—why? My Dao is the truth of cinnabar and azure. Azure represents life and benevolence, while true red is the proper color of the Great Yang Heaven. My Dao is the Way of the Great Yang, the governance of benevolence, unwilling to cause harm.\n\nMay I inquire: now that the qi of the Supreme Peace and August Sovereign has fully arrived, what is the proper order of governance between Heaven and Earth? Might I hear of this?\n\nToday, the laws of Heaven above are thus: those who find joy are met with joy, while those who suffer are met with suffering—such is the law of Heaven. Now that the qi of Supreme Peace has arrived, Heaven above follows this joy, complying and serving it, urgently abolishing weapons and halting punishments. Earth below does likewise.\n\nJoy is yang, the constant principle of Heaven. Weapons, punishments, and legal disputes are yin, the wrath of Earth. When yin rises, it must harm the transformations of yang. Now that the qi of Supreme Peace has arrived, Heaven and the divine soldiers govern together, thus severing punishments, weapons, and contentious litigation, ensuring clarity for ten thousand generations without recklessness. All things are like the sun and moon, which cannot long remain concealed.\n\nWhen the primordial qi naturally rejoices, it unites to generate Heaven and Earth. When pleased, yin and yang harmonize, and wind and rain are regulated. When wind and rain are regulated, the twelve thousand things are born together. When all things rejoice, auspicious omens emerge in response, and the manifestations of the myriad beings ascend as essence to Heaven, making the Three Luminaries shine ever more brightly. When the Three Luminaries rejoice and unite, the four seasons proceed in order: spring delights in birth, summer delights in growth, autumn delights in harvest, and winter delights in storage. When the four seasons rejoice, the Five Phases do not oppose one another, and the people flourish. When the people flourish, the Emperor’s longevity is secured; when the Emperor’s longevity is secured, all the common people rejoice. When the common people rejoice, spectral beings and demonic influences submit. When spectral influences submit, there are no deaths from heavenly calamities or premature harm, and the qi of Supreme Peace arrives. The myriad states do not wage war, and thieves, robbers, and the greedy and cunning are eradicated.\n\nThe six myriad spirits of Heaven and Earth all rejoice, and the true immortals of Heaven and Earth emerge. When the true immortals of Heaven and Earth emerge, the upright qi is fully manifest, while the perverse qi is entirely concealed. Evil people all sit in self-reflection, while good people act. The divine scriptures and records are all revealed, and false and deceptive writings vanish. There is none who does not rejoice and delight; yin and yang harmonize, hearts unite as one, and families transmit life in succession. In all matters, joy brings no evil.\n\nWhen yin and yang rejoice, it is the beginning of life. All things receive their mandate and arise, all resembling humanity. When men and women rejoice, they unite in heart and generate together, and nothing fails to come to fruition. Without joy, they are unwilling to unite in harmonious union. If, in anger or displeasure, they are forced into union, misfortune will follow.\n\nIn this text of mine, I have merely outlined the great principles, showing how joy transforms what is not good—how could one exhaustively record it all? Having understood the goodness of joy, I have yet to expound the prohibitions against the lack of joy, so I shall further clarify its guiding principles.\n\nWhen careless and displeased, unwilling to join forces and unite in heart to generate the primordial qi, one departs from the natural. The primordial qi, being natural, does not delight in division and strife; it cannot harmonize the body and unite in virtue to generate Heaven and Earth together. When Heaven and Earth are displeased, yin and yang contend, unable to harmonize the qi of the four seasons and Five Phases, regulate wind and rain, and abundantly generate the twelve thousand things. When the twelve thousand things are displeased and contend, many are harmed and die, and the year is greatly inauspicious.\n\nIn all matters, when displeased and contentious, the Three Luminaries lose their brightness, the Emperor is sorrowful and distressed, and the common people flee in exile. The good qi is concealed, and the evil qi prevails; the upright spirits depart, and demonic beings arise. The myriad beings and people die prematurely, without attaining their years. When the twelve thousand states contend in displeasure, punishments greatly increase, and weapons are raised. Joy is severed and abandoned, punishments surge, and the six directions are disharmonious—each day is inauspicious.\n\nWhen the qi of Heaven is not regulated, it begins here, yet people do not know its cause. Instead, they blame the ruler above and reproach the Emperor. Failing to recognize the great fault, they reverse the order, blaming those below for the faults of those above, exhausting the perverse qi—how can Supreme Peace be achieved? Instead, misfortune is brought about, punishments daily increase, and joy is utterly lost. The blame lies with the teachings of the middle ages, where instructors repeatedly established methods that, on the contrary, opened the gates of weapons and closed the doors of joy, allowing evil and deceit to arise, which cannot be swiftly stopped. The great fault lies here.\n\nThus, when the penetrating and leveling qi of Heaven above arrives, great joy is unleashed, and punishments are abolished. Earth below does likewise. I cannot exhaustively record the goodness of unleashing joy, nor the evils of its absence.\n\nTherefore, the Dao of yin and yang extends from Heaven above to Earth below, spreading boundlessly. The male and female kinds frolic and rejoice together, then unite in heart to generate, complete, govern, and transmit the mandate of Heaven and Earth, mastering the boundless arts. If they do not frolic together, unwilling to unite in heart as one, how could they willingly generate, complete, govern, and transmit the mandate of Heaven and Earth, mastering the inexhaustible defense?\n\nTo force unity through punishments and威, though it may endure for a time, will ultimately fail. Turning away and contending, yin and yang overcome one another, and the harm of banditry cannot be stopped. Even among the closest—father and son, mother and child, husband and wife—harm will arise, together disrupting the Dao of Heaven, and there will be no enduring world. Such are the consequences of great faults.\n\nJoy is the constant principle of Heaven, the essence of the Great Yang. Filial piety is the constant principle of Earth, the essence of the Great Yin. Thus, joy initiates and generates, initiating harmony and completing success. Heaven constantly delights in good and delights in life, thus always uniting with Heaven and sharing its qi. Only when joy unites can things generate one another, establishing hierarchy.\n\nThus, joy represents Heaven and the superior, while filial piety represents Earth and the inferior. Earth, being below, submits to what is above; yin serves yang, children serve their fathers, ministers serve their lords, and the lord above serves Heaven, just as Earth serves Heaven. Heaven serves what is above it, thus sharing qi with Earth. Therefore, joy and filial piety most perfectly accord with Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe *Yi* (Changes) governs the qi of yin and yang, with the eight winds as its measures, sharing the same position as the Six Jia, embodying both yin and yang, and uniting with Heaven and Earth as one body—thus it is the divine Dao.\n\nThe application of punishments severs the profound yin and incites conflict—this is the qi of disharmony, thus it always arises in accordance with the rhythms of yin. Punishments intensify when yin prevails, yet yield in spring and summer; they flourish in autumn and winter. Thieves and bandits rise under cover of night; wickedness and deceit thrive in darkness and obscurity; ghosts, spirits, and all manner of illnesses erupt in gloom; resentments and grievances gather in perilous straits, leading to mutual slaughter. This is the great proof that joy does not follow punishment—how can one not be cautious? The foolish fear it. If you, my disciple, know to fear it, this is the sign of longevity; if you do not know to fear it, it is the gate of misfortune. I warn you: be vigilant.\n\nThus, in governing Heaven above, each promotes joy as the foundation of transformation, causing all people to delight in mutual transformation, to sit and reflect on their faults and failings—how could it be difficult to do good? Such is the governance of Heaven above, and so too is it on Earth below. Therefore, those who wish to swiftly bring order to chaos must first sever disputes and punishments, and promote joy as the priority—then the qi of imperial equilibrium will immediately arrive.\n\nYou ask: If the qi of Great Peace in Heaven above naturally arrives in due time, and all people spontaneously transform toward goodness, with all things naturally at peace and free from illness, then why, following the model of Heaven above, must people initiate joy to transform one another? All matters depend on prior guidance and instruction—good and evil are the precursors of transformation, the gate that opens the ignorant. Thus, when Heaven intends to act, it always first initiates the precursor, and its signs appear in the heavens, divine patterns emerge. The sages of antiquity modeled their intentions upon these signs. Therefore, the Three Sovereigns above taught transformation through the Dao, and their people were all imbued with the Dao, as were all things. The Five Emperors taught transformation primarily through virtue, and their people largely embodied refined virtue, as did all things. The Three Kings taught transformation primarily through culture, and their people were largely cultured, as did all things. The Five Hegemons taught transformation primarily through martial prowess, and their people were largely martial, prone to anger and prizing strength and bravery—this is not the origin of complete transformation.\n\nThus, in the villages of good people, there are many good people; in the villages of evil people, there are many evil people—this is not a matter of mutual exchange. All matters under Heaven above and below have their own models and laws, and each models itself after its teacher, so that what is transformed entirely resembles one another. Heaven delights in generating and nurturing things, and things will not generate if they are not joyful. Now, the qi of imperial equilibrium and the utmost profundity in Heaven above all emerge to govern, and the essence of yang flourishes—there is nothing that does not rejoice. Therefore, one must model this qi and greatly promote joy to accord with and assist Heaven’s love of this, so that the Dao of Heaven rejoices greatly.\n\nNow, when emperors and kings govern with equilibrium, the people enjoy longevity, so they promote joy to serve the Dao of Heaven and cause each to sit and reflect on self-transformation—how could there be faults? Moreover, joy is Heaven, the essence of yang; when yang aligns, the essence of yin submits, just as spring and summer arise while autumn and winter submit—this is the natural pattern. True person, you must follow the words of my scripture, and punishments will naturally cease. Govern and transform in this way, and you will be no different from the divine.\n\nThus, when governance is difficult to bring to equilibrium, it is because transformation has been lost. Now, the Dao of Heaven naturally has cycles of decline and prosperity, fortune and misfortune—how can you reverse this and call it the origin of transformation? Heaven and Earth do not speak to people, so from time to time they generate sages and sagely teachers to transmit their affairs. When the timing of Heaven is auspicious and joyful, it generates good teachers to teach good words and good transformation. When the Dao of Heaven is about to descend into chaos, misfortune, and decline, it generates evil teachers to teach evil transformation. This is the sign that Heaven governs transformation, and that it is naturally good or evil.\n\nMoreover, in years of joy, good things are abundant, the five grains mature to feed people, and the people are inclined toward goodness. In years of misfortune, evil things are abundant, good things are few, and evil things feed people, so the people’s countenance is evil. This is the clear proof that teachers transform people. Thus, when good teachers emerge, evil teachers submit—this is the sign of Heaven’s prosperity and decline, and that it governs Heaven.\n\nNow, the Dao of Heaven has come full circle, so it has sent me down to expound the good affairs of the true person, to delight in transformation as the highest good, and thus to teach this as the first matter. When Heaven’s cycle is complete, all affairs are prepared, and there must be joy. You understand this intention: just as when all things and people are complete, each household has its joy. Now, Heaven’s cycle is complete—what is there not to rejoice in? How could there be misfortune?\n\nThis scripture will not change for ten thousand generations—such is the transformation of Heaven above. The five musical tones, when activated in proper sequence, align with the intentions of Heaven, Earth, and humanity, bringing about Great Peace, eliminating disasters and wickedness, and ushering in harmonious qi. When hearts and intentions unite, this is the greatest joy. When hearts and intentions diverge, this is discord and error, all leading to bitter qi.\n\nWhat must joy necessarily be? Singing and dancing, the harmonious blending of many voices. What must bitterness necessarily bring? Strife and conflict, the simultaneous rise of many misfortunes. Mutual joy is what suppresses and severs punishments; mutual sorrow and suffering are what bring about rebellion. What is meant by mutual accord and shared intention? Whenever people, great or small, can unite in intention, there must be joy—how could it be otherwise? You should further refine and carefully consider this intention.\n\nThe teachers of imperial equilibrium and the utmost profundity in Heaven above add a word to weigh and resolve this intention. However, if you do not yet greatly attain the intentions of Heaven and Earth to benefit the governance of emperors and kings, you must then follow and employ the intentions of Heaven and Earth. You must not oppose the Great Year or the various spirits, nor abandon their qi when emperors and kings act. Share their joy, their intentions, their direction, their orientation, their movement, their pivot, their root, and their will.\n\nThus, the sages of antiquity established laws, causing emperors and kings to face the east in spring, the south in summer, the west in autumn, and the north in winter—this is to govern together with the qi of Heaven. When they align in this way, it is called following the Dao of Heaven, uniting with Heaven’s qi, and thus submitting in accord. Heaven and Earth are perpetually joyful and not wrathful, so disasters, wickedness, evil, and misfortune are all severed. Then the qi of Great Peace arrives, the qi of equilibrium in Heaven above descends to govern, and the qi of equilibrium on Earth below ascends to assist it.\n\nJoy is expressed through raising one’s voice in song and dance. The \"qi of kingship\" should be stirred and made manifest through music, for it is fitting to offer reverence and compliance, to present support and assistance. The qi of decline, imprisonment, and death all abide in tranquility; they do not wish to be stirred, for such disturbance brings displeasure and joylessness, leading to strife and wrath, and thus giving rise to misfortune, wickedness, evil, and disaster. This is the inherent pattern and nature of Heaven and Earth, never failing even once.\n\nThe qi to be stirred begins with the qi of emperors and kings, followed by the qi of kingship, then the qi of ministers, then the qi of rest, and finally the qi of death and imprisonment. These qi all reside before the Celestial Dipper, advancing day by day to seek assistance and flourish, hence they are stirred. The remaining qi lie behind the Celestial Dipper, their influence waning as they turn away, and thus they are not fit to be aroused. To act contrary to this is to oppose Heaven and Earth, to fail in aligning with their will. Therefore, what Heaven favors is to be promoted, and what Heaven turns away from is to be abandoned—thus one knows the seasons of Heaven, and good or ill fortune may be discerned.\n\nIf you ask why the full activation of the Five Tones is insufficient to complete a song or dance, it is because only when the qi of emperors and kings prevails does the sound emerge first, just as when an emperor or king issues commands to the world, all people and things follow in compliance, and the world attains Great Peace. Each of the Five Tones stirs different forces: some summon Heaven, some Earth, some the sun, moon, and stars, some the four seasons and Five Phases, some mountains and rivers, and some the people and all things. Whatever is stirred by sound is set in motion, each producing its own effect. Thus, when harmony aligns with its intent, good is brought forth; when it fails to align, evil arises.\n\nThe spirits of all things first arrive in homage, and only afterward do their physical forms move. When activating music and sound, one must always strive to understand its purpose, carefully grasp its intent, and then Great Peace will arrive.\n\nIn spring, the stirring begins: the great *jiao* string vibrates, summoning Jupiter, while the Heart Star descends, stirring the Eastern Marchmount. The qi of Lesser Yang trembles, the sound of the Wood Phase resonates, the spirit Goumang is roused, the Azure Dragon stirs, the position of the Green Emperor is invoked, and the green-robed jade maidens ascend and descend in unison. All things of like kind come to pay homage, delighting in the sound. What has been described for one extends infinitely to all. By refining and examining these details, their essential meaning may be fully grasped.\n\nCombining this with all common written texts establishes the model and standard. Thus, when performing music and grasping its highest intent, one may transcend the world; grasping its middle intent brings Great Peace and dispels misfortune; grasping its lower intent delights the people.\n\nThose who further embody the highest intent may delight the divine spirits; those who grasp the middle intent may delight the refined spirits; those who grasp the lower intent may delight the body. When all intents are fully realized, the Supreme Thearch and kings may wander carefree, rejoicing while judgments are rendered, and the spirits become radiant and sated.\n\nMusic is the essence of Greater Yang. Punishment is the essence of Greater Yin. When Yang flourishes, Yin recedes; when Yin flourishes, Yang recedes—thus, when music flourishes, punishment vanishes. Yang moves and produces sound, while Yin is silent; therefore, punishment often harms through Yin. In ancient times, the sages who followed music aligned with the intent of Heaven and Earth: compliance brought fortune, defiance brought misfortune.\n\nThus, Heaven’s three qi: the upper qi is called *music*, the middle qi is called *harmony*, and the lower qi is called *punishment*. Music belongs to Yang, punishment to Yin, and harmony to the Center. The southeast, being Yang, favors life; the northwest, being Yin, favors killing. The qi of harmony follows and circulates, now hidden, now manifest, warding off harm.\n\nSound is the discourse of music. Whether divining near or far, one must align with the time, day, names, and characters, delineating boundaries, assessing the waxing and waning of sovereign and resting qi, and correlating them to form discourse. Listening thus ensures no error.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is like a cycle, ever revolving and returning to its beginning. Always apply the sovereign qi in its proper time, aligning with the Dipper’s position, facing its direction, and activating its sound. When people intone it, they may also use its sound, reckoning with the Six Jia and Five Phases—these are the numbers of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe qi of the seasons is what Heaven and Earth favor and promote. On the day of the Beginning of Spring, when the Dipper aligns with *yin*, it is called the time of the Supreme Thearch. First, the Great Horn is activated; at the midpoint of the month, it aligns with *jia*; in the second month, with *mao*; at the midpoint, with *yi*; in the third month, with *chen*. The rest follow this pattern, each adjusted for the earliness or lateness of the seasonal qi.\n\nFirst, activate the sovereign sound and sovereign string, then the ministerial sound and ministerial string, each according to its number. This is called \"receiving the qi of Heaven and complying with the qi of Earth.\" If Heaven and Earth delight in and employ it, how much more so for humans?\n\nHumans are the most honored of all beings, the children of Heaven. Heaven delights when humans reverently employ its numbers; Earth delights when humans carefully employ its numbers. This is like a filial child obeying their parents’ teachings—how could the parents not love and favor them? Deeply ponder this intent and transmit it to later generations, so they may emulate it to dispel disasters, pacify the qi of Heaven above, and assist the Thearch and kings in governance below.\n\nNow, when the hearts of all people are at peace and not inclined toward wickedness, the twelve thousand beings each attain their proper place—how could this not be joyous?\n\nOne asks: Among the affairs of the Six Caverns and Eight Directions, what is most auspicious, and what is most inauspicious? The most harmonious is auspicious; the most contrary is inauspicious. Evil is contrary; goodness is harmonious.\n\nThus, the qi of the Thearch, the ministerial qi, and the subtle qi all reside before the Celestial Dipper—this is auspicious, for it is what Heaven delights in and wishes to promote. Therefore, one should rejoice in and comply with it. The resting and waning qi are what Heaven and Earth jointly abandon; thus, they should be set aside and not celebrated. Celebrating them opposes the will of Heaven and Earth, constituting great defiance and dissonance with the seasonal qi.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven serves as the model: the sovereign and flourishing qi govern Great Peace, while the imprisoned, waning, and extinguished qi govern inauspicious years. In years of Great Peace, all things flourish, and many good omens appear—this is the great verification of Heaven and Earth. Thus, the ancient sages and worthies deeply divined and complied with these patterns, clearly understanding that like kinds and like affairs share the same qi. By divining through resonance, they obtained its image, then reformed their natures and altered their conduct, never daring to act wrongly.\n\nThe language of Heaven and Earth is revealed through these signs; by observing the images and categories obtained, one may know all. Thus, inauspicious years yield few good responses.\n\nTherefore, those who would bring about Great Peace through music must comply with the sovereign qi. In inauspicious years, music must not be performed without cause, for the imprisoned and waning qi oppose Heaven and Earth—hence, they are inauspicious. The sovereign qi is where virtue resides; the imprisoned and waning qi are where punishment resides.\n\nHeaven endows each being with its nature and spirit. Delighting in goodness brings good spirits; delighting in evil brings evil spirits—this is the natural disposition.\n\nFirst, comply with and activate the seasonal qi of Heaven, Earth, and the Four Thearchs, then augment it threefold to delight Heaven. Thus, Heaven rejoices greatly, the Thearch’s lifespan extends, premature deaths and evil vanish, disasters are entirely dispelled, the qi of Greater Yang ceases its wrath, and the realm’s borders are secure. Those who know to first activate and comply with music align with Heaven’s intent to benefit humanity, and true spirits emerge. Even those dwelling in hidden caves delight in coming to assist governance.\n\nSecond, comply with and activate the seasonal and sovereign qi of Heaven and Earth, then augment it twofold to delight the qi of Earth. Thus, Earth rejoices greatly and ceases its wrath, granting the ruler longevity, dissolving treachery, banditry, and warfare, and fostering goodness within the realm. Below, all delight in complying with their superiors, and the worthy emerge to assist in governance, while Earth spirits comply and nurture.\n\nThird, comply with and activate the ministerial and subtle qi, causing the qi of harmony to rejoice greatly. Thus, ruler and ministers, people and spirits, each safeguard their place; flatterers, bandits, and thieves do not arise; borders are secure; and the qi of harmony daily flourishes, while all things incline toward goodness.\n\nFourth, be cautious never to activate the qi of death and destruction, lest severe banditry arise, sudden deaths multiply, and the realm’s borders remain perilously unstable, bringing forth malevolent qi and ghosts in great numbers, causing severe harm.\n\nFifth, do not activate the imprisoned qi, lest great misfortune arise.\n\nSixth, do not activate the waning and resting qi, lest great misfortune arise.\n\nThe reason for tripling the music of the sovereign qi is that the sovereign qi is most honored and supreme, resembling the revered Heaven—thus, it is celebrated threefold.\n\nAll twelve thousand beings come into being, and the qi of goodness responds in full.\n\nThe reason for doubling the music of the ministerial qi is that the ministerial qi resembles Earth, and Earth dwells alongside humanity—thus, its music is doubled to honor Earth. Earth dwells with humanity, and when people see this, all rejoice; thus, the myriad things are well-ordered.\n\nThe reason for performing the music of the ministerial qi and subtle qi as one is that it resembles the balanced and harmonious person. The balanced and harmonious person is humbler than Heaven and Earth, so the music is less.\n\nHumanity is tasked with ordering the myriad things for Heaven and Earth. When people delight in music, they rejoice and incline toward goodness, and the myriad things are well-ordered.\n\nThe music of the sovereign qi is modeled after the Three Sovereigns, like Heaven itself. The music of the kingly qi is patterned after the Five Emperors, resembling Earth’s virtue of nurturing beings while periodically applying punishment.\n\nThe subtle qi is modeled after the Three Kings, without fixed laws. The waning, imprisoned, and vanishing qi are modeled after the Five Hegemons, whose qi is chaotic.\n\nHeaven and Earth possess martial power to punish evil and uphold goodness—this must be deeply examined.\n\nLet the Perfected One accumulate goodness and wisdom, mastering all affairs. Now, the Supreme Qi of Great Peace from the Heavenly August Sovereign has fully arrived. The Most High desires what can be urgently attained: the Heavenly August Sovereign delights in good people, those who can harmonize wind and rain to nurture all beings.\n\nSince the beginning of creation, those who do good have been few, and few align with Heaven’s will. Heaven has always regarded this as a source of sorrow. Now, among those on Earth, few meet Heaven’s standards for eternal harmony.\n\nBeneath the Great Heaven, the twelve thousand states all differ according to their water and soil. The finest of good people are entrusted to Heaven, and the essence and radiance of the myriad things ascend to belong to Heaven. The middling are entrusted to humanity, to serve and harmonize with the yin-yang and the myriad things. The lowest are entrusted to Earth, to walk and labor upon it.\n\nThe Dao is what August Heaven takes as its model. It is the highest designation of goodness, crowning the supreme, enveloping the boundless, emerging without gaps, entering without crevices. It is the teacher of all matters under Heaven, the origin of a million affairs, the elder of past and present worthies and sages. When emperors and kings align with Heaven’s heart, they become the parents of the people, from whom all transformations arise.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is Heaven itself—pure and luminous, unwilling to be defiled or dishonored. Yet today’s practice of the Dao consists entirely of four defiling acts, polluting the divine Dao of August Heaven and disrupting Earth’s principles. Such acts cannot serve as the foundation of transformation, cannot be a model for teachers, cannot be parents. Together, they destroy Heaven’s treasured vessel, and are called the great rebellious children. Thus, Heaven above knows them deeply and swiftly punishes them.\n\nWhen the qi of Supreme Peace from the August Sovereign arrives, it cannot tolerate these four kinds of people:\nFirst, the unfilial;\nsecond, those who preserve their true nature but leave no descendants;\nthird, those who eat feces and drink urine;\nfourth, those who act as beggars.\nThese four types all defile the true Dao of Heaven and are unfit for fostering transformation.\n\nWhen rulers employ fools to govern, Heaven’s great limit is near. How is this known? When a ruler governs with such people, Heaven manifests many disasters and omens, and the barbarians frequently invade—this is clear proof of Heaven’s disapproval.\n\nTo align with the weightiest standards is no different from a binding contract. What people detest, Heaven detests; what people love, Heaven loves. Thus, the sages and worthies of antiquity deeply grasped this great principle and always modeled their conduct on Heaven, never daring to deviate even slightly. Therefore, they alone enjoyed Heaven’s favor and won Heaven’s heart. Without Heaven’s heart, great misfortune follows.\n\nHeaven selects its officers to share in its work, administering the inexhaustible arts of governance. Long united in purpose and strength, they harmonize qi with a single heart—thus, they endure.\n\nNow, Heaven values the transmission of mutual generation, so the four seasons receive Heaven’s teachings and generate one another endlessly. Thus, Heaven is called Father, Earth is called Mother, and the qi of the six jia, twelve branches, and eight trigrams serve as their principles. They generate one another in turn, taking turns to act, so the Dao of Heaven remains eternally unbroken—this is the constant aid to transformation.\n\nTherefore, scholars must model themselves on Heaven and never sever Heaven’s lineage. Now, Heaven is pure and luminous, and the Dao is clear and unsullied. Heaven and the Dao dwell above as models for humanity. The pure and luminous delight in purity and luminosity, so the Three Luminaries ascend to Heaven, each following its kind, combining to form their shapes.\n\nHeaven’s shape is like a bright mirror: just as a person’s eyes see clearly, it does not wish to be defiled but always desires fresh brilliance. When emperors and kings rise, they all obtain the Dao as their teacher. People cherish their glory and wisdom, using them to transform the people. What teachers value is the ability to know Heaven’s heart and will, modeling transformation upon it.\n\nGoodness on Earth is goodness in Heaven; evil on Earth is evil in Heaven. Thus, when people do good on Earth, Heaven responds with goodness. When people do evil on Earth, Heaven responds with evil. Their qi ascends and connects.\n\nThe five qi link above and below in unison; the six extensions join above and below in thoroughfare; the twelve branches align above and below. There is no distance too far for this connection. Goodness below ascends and connects; evil below brings misfortune above. The Five Phases arise below, and the Five Stars shine above. This is what Heaven makes clear to the people of the world.\n\nWhat does Heaven above delight in? What does it forbid? Only by knowing its prohibitions and heeding its warnings, pondering its will day and night and never daring to transgress, can one instruct future generations.\n\nNow, the qi of Supreme Peace from the August Sovereign has fully arrived in abundance. The yang days grow bright first, evil qi halts and rests, and upright qi prevails. The waning dissipates, and the Dao and virtue flourish in yang.\n\nHeaven urgently forbids setting fire to mountains and forests. Mountains are the great yang, the guiding principle of the land, its ruler. The gathering of roots and trees is its elder—this, too, is a ruler.\n\nFire is the eldest of the Five Phases, yang in nature. The Three Lords and Three Yangs, when they meet, reverse and weaken one another. Therefore, Heaven urgently forbids setting fire to mountains and forests where trees gather. If not burned, they flourish abundantly; when they flourish, fire reigns supreme, and fire’s supremacy delights the sun and moon, bing-ding, si, and wu. When the mother is abundant, her child receives qi and endures long—thus Heaven above halts such burning. When yin flourishes, yin’s treachery dissipates day by day; when yang wanes, yin’s treachery arises daily—this is the natural law.\n\nOne asks: when the Three Yangs converge, why is it inauspicious? The Three Yangs are Heaven’s yang, humanity’s yang, and Earth’s yang. The Three Yangs contain not a single yin; all three are lords, not a single subject; all three are male, not a single female. This is the path to annihilation, the Way without posterity. The Way without posterity cannot transmit its kind, cannot mutually engender—thus it becomes inauspicious. This is to have Heaven but no Earth, to have the sun but no moon, to have above but no below, to have exterior but no interior. In Heaven’s reckoning, this is the mark of imminent ruin.\n\nOne asks: may field grasses be burned? Heaven above does not forbid it—indeed, they ought to be burned. Why burn them alone? Grasses are the yin of wood and correspond to yi. Wood corresponds to jia, and jia is yang, of the same kind as wood—thus they correspond. Yi is yin and of the same kind as grasses—thus they correspond. Yi fears metal, and metal injures wood; when wood is injured, yang wanes, and when yang wanes, treachery arises—therefore they ought to be burned. Yi is yin, grasses are yin, Earth is yin—three yins oppose one another and together breed treachery. Thus it is said: when the year resides in the northern extreme of yin, extreme yin gives birth to yang. Fire is yang, and yin, receiving yang, compliantly gives rise to good affairs. Therefore, Heaven above instructs: burn the grasses of the lower fields to delight yin and comply with yang. Two share the office, together governing yin and yang, removing the illnesses of Heaven and Earth, so that the Emperor and kings know no sorrow, the twelve thousand things each attain their place, grasses and trees emerge in joy, and no grievances remain.\n\nNow, the fine and virtuous qi of Supreme Peace has arrived, and Heaven constantly fears that the people may violate the seasonal ordinances and harm it. The myriad spirits above jointly record those who delight in killing and wounding, the sons who hunt and fish, those who do not follow the Dao of Heaven and do no good, who constantly delight in killing and wounding. Heaven reproves them, Earth detests them, the host of spirits condemns them, and together they record and punish them. Every three years, a minor reckoning; every five years, a major reckoning. Those with grave transgressions are sentenced, while minor offenses result in reduced years and diminished fate. Every three generations, a great reckoning; every five generations, a great annihilation.\n\nTherefore, Heaven above has assembled the documents of the Three Ways, and the host of spirits jointly record transgressions of killing, wounding, and punishments.\n\nJia-zi is Heaven’s norm, the day when winter first returns. Yi-chou is Earth’s norm, when things spread their roots. Bing-yin is humanity’s norm, when at dawn people first rise and open their doors to their duties. These three are the beginnings of Heaven, Earth, and humanity, the root of all things. What is born first belongs to yang, the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth. Thus, Qian, Kan, Gen, and Zhen reside on the northeastern face, their harmony lying between Kan and Gen, where yin and yang unite and give birth in the center. Therefore, all who conceive dwell in the central abdomen, slightly below the harmony, born within yin—hence called “mother.” One must not allow the qi of punishment to reside in the center.\n\nNow, the Dao of Heaven has completed a great cycle and begun anew, with pure yang governing Heaven and Earth above and below—thus punishments are urgently abolished. Heaven is called spirit, and yang is also called spirit. Those who now transgress our writings and delight in punishments will be punished by Heaven above. Therefore, the method of the divine sages arises from the heart alone, with nothing left unexplained. Thus, the flourishing of red is Heaven, the sun, and the heart. Heaven and the sun are ever bright, illuminating all without fail. Those who practice this Dao utterly eradicate all that is treacherous and perverse.\n\nYang is born within the dark and obscure. Thus, yang qi arises in the north, emerges in the east, flourishes in the south, and wanes and dissipates in the west. Such is the law of Heaven.\n\nWhen the qi of Supreme Peace arrives, who is fit for the Dao? Who is unfit? The Dao and humanity are like wind and rain: those who practice it prosper, while those who do not simply desist. Those who practice well are its people; those who do not practice well are not its people. Those who practice without exertion, whose path opens easily, are its people. Those who do not open their path, who labor all day without success, are not its people. To practice is auspicious; not to practice is inauspicious.\n\nIn nurturing oneself, can one afford not to examine this carefully? The Dao is the tally of the upright.\n\nThe *Excerpts from the Scripture of Supreme Peace*, Geng Section, Volume Seven, concludes.\nThe *Excerpts from the Scripture of Supreme Peace*, Xin Section, Volume Eight.\n\nOne asks: to be sated without eating, to enjoy long life and enduring existence—this is the Way to enrich the state and preserve the people. If one wishes to cease eating, one must first employ the method of guiding life and thereby retain qi. After ingesting qi-nourishing medicines, hunger arises slightly on the third day, mildly on the seventh, and beyond ten days, one achieves minor success without doubt—having left death for life. After ingesting qi-nourishing medicines, for all solid and difficult-to-digest foods, one meal suffices as the measure. For formless foods, moderation and restraint are best. Beyond a hundred days, one may cease eating—this is called the inexhaustible Way, the means to assist the state in nourishing the people and aid Heaven and Earth as the masters of sustenance. Too little is auspicious; too much is inauspicious; complete abstention is also inauspicious, for it obstructs the intestines.\n\nThe method for unblocking the intestines: one meal is proper; two meals are excessive; three meals are inferior; four meals distend the intestines; five meals provoke great hunger; six meals bring grave misfortune. From this, a hundred illnesses arise, and in years of great famine, one will die.\n\nAfter regulating one's diet for a thousand days, the large and small intestines become full, and one will never feel hunger. All illnesses depart, the complexion improves, and nothing is forbidden or guarded against. The ancients who attained the Dao in old age all did so by abstaining from food. Rulers, ministers, and common people may thus secure body and mind, fulfill their duties, preserve wealth if rich, and sustain life if poor. The noble person who practices this will thrive in years of plenty and avoid peril in years of famine.\n\nHumans possess three lives, yet remain unaware: daily consumption of three meals sustains them. Skipping the morning meal severs one life; skipping the midday meal severs two; skipping the evening meal severs all three. After three days without food, nine lives are extinguished. Without stored provisions or hoarded treasures, hunger arises. From this, great deceit and wickedness begin.\n\nBy employing this Way, all affairs regulate themselves. In auspicious years, one may share prosperity; in famine years, one may preserve the people. One should always lightly bind the intestines to facilitate movement. Between Heaven and Earth, all things possess their own spirit and luminosity, ascending to Heaven as stars by which to observe safety and danger.\n\nThe nature of Heaven and Earth has its own patterns and laws—six jia stems, five phases, four seasons, and their measured cycles—by which one may divine and foresee future events, remedy decline and disorder, and prevent calamities before they arise.\n\n**Seven Matters of Loyalty and Filial Duty:**\n\n1. **Minister’s Duty to the Ruler’s Decline:** When a minister perceives the ruler’s decline and revives him to renewed prosperity, it is a great merit. To recognize the decline yet fail to remedy it—or worse, to speak ill and depart—is to incite misfortune, and the guilt remains unforgiven.\n\n2. **Minister’s Duty to Avert Disaster:** If a minister knows the ruler is about to face misfortune and intervenes to prevent it, this is a great merit. To know and not act is to incite disaster, and the guilt remains unforgiven.\n\n3. **Minister’s Duty to Correct Governance:** When a minister perceives the ruler’s governance has lost its essential purpose and disasters arise in succession, yet assists in restoring order, this is proper and marks a discerning minister. To know and not act leaves the guilt unforgiven.\n\n4. **Minister’s Duty to Guide the Young Ruler:** If a minister knows the ruler is young and his wisdom insufficient for governance, yet aids him in attaining understanding, this is proper. To know and not assist—even to speak of his inadequacy—is disloyalty, weakening one’s superior, and the guilt remains unforgiven.\n\n5. **Minister’s Duty to the Aging Ruler:** When a minister knows the ruler is aged and nearing the end of his years, yet seeks extraordinary methods and great sages to devise strategies and inner texts, extending the ruler’s lifespan, this is a great merit. To know and not act—even to speak of fortune or misfortune—is a grave transgression.\n\n6. **Subordinate’s Duty to the Superior’s Peril:** If a subordinate perceives their superior in danger, whether through misgovernance or negligence, and aids in rectifying the situation, this is a great merit. To know and not act, instead evading responsibility and departing, is to be disloyal and unfilial, and the guilt extends to their descendants.\n\n7. **Child’s Duty to Ailing Parents:** When parents fall ill, a child who, through divination and observation, exhausts all effort and spirit to save them fulfills their duty. To know and not act invites Heaven’s severe punishment.\n\n8. **Child’s Duty to Aging Parents:** When a child knows their parents are aged and nearing the end of their years, yet seeks wise teachers and extraordinary methods to restore their vitality, this is the duty of a filial child. This is akin to consuming the food of others and returning it as sustenance—a great merit.\n\n9. **Duty to Rescue the Afflicted:** When one knows another faces misfortune, great harm, or impending suffering, yet intervenes to restore them, offering extraordinary methods, strategies, inner texts, and good counsel to eliminate their sorrows, this is a great merit. To know and not act leaves the guilt unforgiven.\n\nTo abandon one’s parents in their hour of death, seeking pleasure while shunning hardship, is to be no different from beasts. How can such a one govern the Three Powers or succeed Heaven and Earth?\n\nThus, the sages emerge to teach and admonish, urging goodness and severing evil, rescuing Heaven and Earth from disaster, ensuring the Three Luminaries, Five Phases, and stars move in harmony. Is this mere empty speech?\n\nNow, the heavens above have produced texts to transform and eliminate all disasters, bringing forth goodness. Therefore, I, having received the mandate of the Perfected, reveal these writings. The heavens above instruct me to speak boldly, without concealment or obstruction.\n\nNow, Heaven and Earth undergo a great renewal, and disasters are about to vanish without remnant. Thus, I teach people to compile and collate ancient and modern texts of virtue, forming the *Canon of the Utmost Depth*, a definitive work of goodness that cannot be altered. Even sages and worthies cannot surpass its phrasing.\n\nThese words are the language of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang. They instruct and admonish worthy rulers, urging diligent practice to attain Great Peace. The purpose of speaking of concealment is that when a worthy ruler obtains this and treasures it in his heart, applying it to the world, nurturing the myriad things to achieve Great Peace, and ascribing merit to the Supreme Emperor, it will be as enduring as stone chambers and deep caves.\n\nHeaven bestows good things, which must return to good places. Like pearls and jade, they are treasured by emperors and kings. Coarse and inferior things are discarded by the masses. How much more does Heaven love those who do good? How could emperors and kings not value them?\n\nNow, the heavens above are the Heaven of the Utmost Limit; the heavens between are the Heaven of the Utmost Limit; the heavens below are the Heaven of the Utmost Limit; and the heavens extending in all directions are the Heaven of the Utmost Limit. The present method is such that the Three Ways gather qi and deliberate together, corresponding to the positions of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.\n\nWhen Great Peace arrives, Heaven rejoices, and the emperor’s lifespan extends. The Way’s numinous power protects Heaven and Earth; good qi responds without fail. Virtue and power arrive daily; deceit and falsehood retreat; treacherous ministers and corrupt officials vanish. All ministers are removed, and myriad virtues arise spontaneously. The Five Phases harmonize; the four seasons proceed in timely goodness.\n\nIn governance, one must begin with the root. The root lies in the human and spirit images between Heaven and Earth, where spirits mirror humans, each possessing their own domain. Gathering in pavilions, districts, townships, and counties, their preferences, aversions, joys, and sufferings each have their origin. All affairs are closely examined, their strengths and weaknesses, gains and losses illuminated as clearly as the sun and moon.\n\nThus, the great teachings convene their deliberations, where the worthy and unworthy together settle affairs in equanimity. Therefore, in every prefecture, county, township, and village under Heaven, sealed receptacles are established, and the myriad people are each to compose writings according to their abilities, speaking directly of their hardships, sufferings, benefits, harms, approvals, and disapprovals, then submit their writings into the seals. Local officials shall compile and present these to the Son of Heaven, enabling him to know the people’s preferences and aversions, the worthy and unworthy, the beneficial and harmful, so that they may be collectively deliberated and governed. Thereupon, the qi of Great Peace shall arrive, blessing the state, its lord, and the myriad people, so that the twelve thousand beings each attain their proper place.\n\nThe sealed receptacle is what is now called the *guǐhán*. The Way of Heaven has its urgencies and delays; human affairs are likewise urgent or delayed. When the Way of Heaven is urgent, wind, rain, thunder, and lightning arrive without fail at their appointed times. When human affairs are urgent, swift action likewise arrives without delay. For urgent matters, one must respond in accordance with the celestial model: the memorial is submitted in a single transmission, returned to the original office for handling, and rewards or punishments are meted out accordingly. For delayed matters, they are to be reported in a single day during the eighth month.\n\nThe celestial model is thus. Just as the principles of yin and yang operate in this manner, so too do human affairs. Within each person’s abdomen resides a Celestial Sovereign, and the Five Qi each have their ruling monarchs. Heaven possesses the Five Qi, and Earth has the Five Directions. One qi presides over movement, and the ruling monarch upholds rectitude. All affairs within the human abdomen are called the *heart*. The heart is the ruler of the Five Viscera, the root of the spirit, and the utmost essence of the body. It governs the pursuit of goodness; the heart takes no joy in falsehood, for internal wickedness is evil.\n\nIf one can uphold goodness, abide in clarity and stillness, refrain from reckless external pursuits, and maintain inner integrity, then one may meet the ruler within the abdomen—this is called \"illuminating the heart to behold its clarity.\" The heart is the ruler; meeting it ensures longevity, and all affairs are governed rightly. Those who fail to meet the ruler are all deviant, no longer in communion with the ruler, and all their affairs go awry, leading to early demise.\n\nNow, the virtue of the Great Yang flourishes, desiring that above and below Heaven, there be no bounds above and no limits below, extending even to the Eight Caverns beyond. The true spirits and true essences, radiant with light, all emerge to assist the Emperor in governance, bringing forth the qi of the Supreme Sovereign’s Cavernous Peace, which has never been seen before. The good enjoy long lives, and the myriad beings no longer suffer untimely deaths or self-inflicted grievances. Deviant spirits all vanish, and under Heaven, there are no longer those who suffer from oppression or illness. How could such wonders not be heard?\n\nExcellent is your question! Heaven commands the complete eradication of deceit, falsehood, and malevolence, bringing forth true affairs. All paintings and diagrams possess their own spirits: true affairs have true spirits, deviant affairs have deviant spirits, good affairs have good spirits, and evil affairs have evil spirits. Those who accumulate deviance in their households will inevitably suffer deviant harm. Those who accumulate true texts and true Dao in their households will inevitably produce transcendents.\n\nThus, the manifestations of truth and falsehood each arise from their own essence. Heaven has the auspicious and the inauspicious: the auspicious has auspicious spirits, and the inauspicious has inauspicious spirits. Earth likewise has the auspicious and inauspicious: the auspicious has auspicious spirits, and the inauspicious has inauspicious spirits.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors each had their kin and brothers; the Three Kings and Five Hegemons likewise had their own kin and brothers. Though distinctions may be minor, each follows its kind. When the world flourishes, they rise; when it declines, they fall. Like day and night, they follow one another in succession, continuing unceasingly from the opening of yin and yang to the present. The poor become petty men, and the wealthy become noble men, alternating in governance and mutual administration.\n\nThis is the kinship of Heaven and Earth. Though the myriad beings do not flourish, some resemble one another, yet in truth, they are not the same. Heaven has the Six Jia, the Four Seasons, the Five Phases, the firm and the yielding, the female and the male, the eldest, middle, and youngest—all forming kin and brothers. By revering and serving them without fail, one transforms the world, making them the masters of goodness: benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, culture, and martial virtue, each becoming kin and brothers in turn.\n\nWhere the Dao is kin to the Dao, all Dao converge as one, mutually verifying and generating one another. If one’s body today attains the Dao, all Daoists will come, and kindred spirits unite as one family, all harboring good intentions. Regardless of rank, none harm one another, and disasters and calamities all depart without misfortune. If the Emperor practices this, the world will flourish, and governance will be effortless, ensuring long life and transcendence. If officials and people practice this, their governance will grow ever clearer, and all Dao will emerge, shining with light.\n\nThe Dao is kin to the Dao, transmitted and practiced in succession. Thus, summoning the Dao with the Dao and seeking the Dao with the Dao makes the Dao one’s kin and brothers. When transformation reaches such a state, the world will all cherish life and detest killing. How could there be those without the Dao?\n\nWhere virtue is kin to virtue, if one today embodies great virtue and takes virtue as one’s intent, all virtuous people will yield and serve one another, and all virtuous people under Heaven will emerge. Taking this as the model, one may sit in tranquility without affairs. If the Emperor practices this, his state will prosper; if officials and people practice it, nothing will remain ungoverned. Summoning virtue with virtue, virtue will come of itself.\n\nWhere benevolence is kin to benevolence, if one today embodies benevolence, all benevolent people will come seeking one another. Summoning benevolence with benevolence, all benevolent people will come. If the Emperor practices this, the world will be entirely benevolent; if officials and people practice it, none will fail to be kindred. This is what it means for benevolence to unite as one family—kin and brothers.\n\nWhere righteousness is kin to righteousness, seeking righteousness with righteousness, if one today has attained righteousness, all righteous people will come to join them, uniting through righteousness. If the Emperor practices this, suffering and joy will be balanced; if officials and people practice it, life and injury will be balanced. Seeking righteousness with righteousness makes them kin and brothers.\n\nWhere propriety is kin to propriety, seeking propriety with propriety, if one today has attained propriety, all those who practice propriety will come. The living will not act recklessly, their abdomens empty within, their external conduct like a ring—hastening, walking, kneeling, rising—without awaiting commands.\n\nWhen days grow short and clothing wears thin to rags,\nif the Emperor practices this, sorrow and vexation multiply;\nif officials and people practice it, their duties become tangled,\nthe able grow weary, the old and weak strain their sinews.\n\nWhere propriety is kin to propriety, they become kin and brothers.\n\nWhere refinement is kin to refinement—if one today has attained refinement,\nall refined people will gather like floating clouds,\ntheir inner and outer accumulations piling like mountains.\nYet if sincerity is lacking, great deceit arises.\nShould the Emperor practice this to govern affairs,\nsome may succeed, some may fail.\nIf officials and people practice it, they deceive one another with false promises,\nbringing harm, swift calamities, and myriad illnesses,\nshortening lives day by day.\nRefining one another with refinement, intimidating one another with refinement,\nthey take turns seizing and generating—\nsuch are the kin of refinement.\n\nWhere martial force is kin to martial force—if one today has attained martial prowess,\nall martial people will gather,\ntheir qi blazing like the sun,\ntheir weapons gleaming,\ntheir strength doubled,\ntheir eyes wide,\ntheir rage uncontrollable.\nMartial ghosts lurk in their ranks,\nseeking only victory, sparing no lives.\nIf a noble ruler practices this, his governance grows ever more violent;\nif officials and people practice it, they slaughter the world,\ndevoid of goodwill,\ntheir governance a gathering of harm—\nthus martial force begets martial force,\nand these are the kin of martial force.\n\nWhere eloquence is kin to eloquence—if one today has attained great eloquence,\nall eloquent people will come to join them,\neloquence begetting eloquence without end.\nOne word becomes a hundred, a hundred becomes a thousand,\na thousand becomes ten thousand,\nexchanged back and forth in a storm of tongues,\ndevoid of truth.\nIf a ruler practices this, his governance becomes multifarious,\nleaving officials and people nowhere to place their lives.\nSeeking eloquence with eloquence—\nthese are kin and brothers.\n\nWhere law is kin to law—if one today has mastered law,\nall legalists under heaven will gather.\nNo matter how great or small the affair, all is governed,\nyet no one is without guilt.\nFrom birth to old age, how many transgressions does one person commit?\nNone are without fault.\nThrough this mutual generation,\nnineteen out of twenty noble rulers meet untimely deaths.\nRuling by this, the world’s great chaos cannot be halted.\nThus, in seeking kin and brothers, each follows its kind.\nThe root of order and disorder, the foundation of Great Peace—\nexamining these nine matters makes it clear.\n\nThe gods above declare:\nThose who delight in practicing the Dao—\nthe qi of the Dao of Heaven and Earth aids them;\nthose who delight in practicing virtue—\nthe qi of virtue aids them.\nThose who practice benevolence—\nHeaven grants them benevolent qi;\nthose who practice righteousness—\nHeaven grants them righteous qi;\nthose who practice propriety—\nHeaven grants them the qi of propriety;\nthose who practice refinement—\nHeaven grants them the qi of refinement;\nthose who practice eloquence—\neloquent qi aids them;\nthose who practice law—\nlegal qi aids them.\nHeaven and Earth each act according to their kind in divine matters.\nWhen Heaven aids them, spirits hasten to their side.\nPonder deeply its essential meaning,\nand the qi of Great Peace can be swiftly attained.\n\nI ask: is supreme goodness easy to achieve, or is supreme evil easy?\nWhen yang reaches its extreme, it becomes goodness;\nwhen yin reaches its extreme, it becomes evil.\nYang’s extreme gives rise to immortals;\nyin’s extreme slays all things—\nthese are the extremes of yin and yang.\n\nNow, the common people cannot exhaust their strength in nourishing their parents,\nseeking rare methods and Daoist arts to sustain them,\nyet leave them grieving until death.\nInstead, they teach one another fine clothing, food, song, and dance to amuse them—\nthese are the people most rebellious,\nand how could Heaven bless them?\n\nAbove, Heaven mirrors the writings of mortals below.\nToday, Heaven establishes a law:\nthe people of Heaven must not conspire in cunning,\nfor there are greater arts.\nThe same holds true on Earth.\nDo you, Perfected One, truly understand?\n\nFrom ancient times to now,\nmany have been the flattering ministers and cunning men,\nwho manipulate words to deceive their superiors,\ndistressing their lord and father to gain office,\neating their stipends without merit before Heaven and Earth.\nHeaven detests them, Earth loathes them,\nand above, they are named \"disruptors of order.\"\nNow, the balanced qi of Heaven descends,\nwishing to sever them,\nyet fearing these men will again disrupt governance.\n\nToday, people accumulate folly,\neasily deceived into office,\nbut the disasters of Heaven cannot be deceived and dismissed,\nnor can they be removed by fraud.\nTruth and falsehood correspond with Heaven.\nIf not fully revealed to the people of later ages,\ntest it in practice—\nall calamities will vanish,\nproving this is my true scripture,\naligned with the laws of Heaven above.\nThere can be no doubt.\n\nIf one speaks yet contradicts,\nthe truth becomes daily clearer.\nIf applied yet yields no success,\nmy Dao is false—\nthis, too, would be evident without words.\n\nHeaven’s law does not reward clever speech,\nbut rather the achievement of success and completion.\nIt is like sitting facing the sun and moon,\nboth radiant with light.\nHow can one know their heat and coolness?\nFrom afar, how can one verify?\nBy their effects.\nSitting facing the sun, one knows its warmth;\nsitting facing the moon, one knows its coolness.\nMy true scripture is the same.\n\nHeaven’s law sets the standard:\nwhen the eyes are open, govern yang;\nwhen closed, govern yin.\nWhen open, govern the visible;\nwhen closed, govern the formless.\nWhen open, govern the body;\nwhen closed, govern the spirit.\nUsing this as verification,\nyin and yang are fully ordered,\nand none neglect their duties.\nThe same holds true on Earth—\nit is the ultimate, imperial, and perfect governance.\n\nToday, when Heaven issues scriptures,\nwhen spirits issue talismans and strategies,\nwhen divine scriptures are composed,\nwhen sages create texts and classics,\nwhen the words of the highest worthies are spoken—\nall are speech.\nThus, the gods of Heaven and Earth and the highest worthies\nexert themselves for humanity,\naccumulating words over the years,\nable to establish Heaven and Earth,\neliminate disasters.\nIf the Emperor follows and applies them,\nhe may wander carefree without trouble,\nascend to immortality and extend his years,\ngain Heaven’s favor,\nand his descendants will continue without end.\n\nWhen the world declines, it will rise again in great prosperity. All under Heaven look to the Mandate, and none fail to attain their proper place within the six directions and eight reaches of Heaven and Earth. Yin and yang are thoroughly harmonized, all rejoice in Heaven’s health, wind and rain come in their seasons, thunder and lightning do not arise untimely. The sun and moon grow brighter, the Three Luminaries do not stray from their courses, the four seasons and Five Phases proceed in order, each finding its proper place—all this is the achievement of the divine and sagely words of goodness. How vast is their merit!\n\nIn the heavens above, all things differ, each possessing its own natural primal qi and yin-yang, yet resembling my scriptures. Let each follow its customs, inscribe and practice my written words, and Great Peace shall be attained.

Let each follow its customs, inscribe and practice my words of good and evil, and Great Peace shall be attained.\n\nIf they do not follow the teachings of their original kind, great chaos will ensue. Take heed!\n\nHeaven has commanded me to fully reveal these writings to resolve the afflictions of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, the Emperor and the people, and the myriad things. All the sufferings of the people and the myriad things shall be dispelled. Thus, I teach you to employ the boundless method and demonstrate it, collating and examining the sacred texts of former sages and worthies along with the common words of the people. After this, the afflictions of Heaven and Earth shall be entirely eliminated. Once eliminated, the Emperor’s years shall be prolonged, and he shall govern with folded arms, free from care.\n\nHeaven is the Great Yang. Earth is the Great Yin. Humanity dwells at the center, and the myriad things are likewise. Heaven constantly descends and bestows, its qi flowing downward. Earth constantly ascends and seeks, its qi rising to meet. The two qi intersect at the center, where humanity resides in correctness. The two qi constantly interact and function, uniting at the center to jointly generate the myriad things. All things receive these two qi to take form, combining them into nature and disposition. Without these two qi, they cannot be born or completed. Thus, the lives of the myriad things depend on these two qi, which intermingle within their forms.\n\nTherefore, when one does good, Heaven and Earth know it; when one does evil, Heaven and Earth also know it. Thus, the ancient people of utmost goodness and virtue inwardly understood Heaven’s intent and always acted rightly in goodness.\n\nThe Heavenly Prognostication states: Those who return to joy find joy; those who return to goodness find goodness; those who return to evil find evil; those who return to delight find delight; those who return to compliance find compliance; those who return to truth find truth; those who return to the Dao find the Dao; those who return to contentment find contentment. Whatever one returns to, Heaven and Earth and the host of spirits likewise return in kind, as swiftly as echo follows sound.\n\nThose who return to refinement find refinement returned; those who return to deceit find deceit returned; those who return to eloquence find eloquence returned; those who return to flattery find flattery returned; those who return to martial prowess find martial prowess returned; those who return to rebellion find rebellion returned; those who return to misfortune find misfortune returned; those who return to perversity find perversity returned. Whatever one returns to, Heaven and Earth and the host of spirits all return in kind.\n\nAll principles of fortune and misfortune, safety and peril, lie in what one returns to. Why is it that households of great strength, which amass private wealth in abundance, later often fall into poverty and misfortune? The divine ones say: This is because some, though possessed of much wisdom, instead deceive those who lack it; or, though strong, instead bully the weak; or, though young, instead oppress the old—all acts of rebellion, and thus Heaven does not long protect them.\n\nWhy is this? Those with wisdom ought to nurture the foolish, yet instead deceive them—this is the first rebellion. The strong ought to support the weak, yet instead bully them—this is the second rebellion. The young ought to care for the old, yet instead oppress them—this is the third rebellion. Such conduct opposes the heart of Heaven, and thus misfortune must follow.\n\nWealth is but the surplus of Heaven and Earth, like water that ever flows and follows, ever humble and dwelling below. Those who obtain much wealth are those who are humble and thus receive more. Therefore, the greedy—Heaven does not protect them.\n\nSince the loss of harmony among the three laws of Heaven, Earth, and yin-yang, there has been an excess of reckoning in Heaven, with accumulated stores left unspent. Why is this? Heaven’s mandate allots one hundred and thirty to the highest, called the surplus of the yang calendar. Next, one hundred and twenty, called the remainder after deducting the cycle of years. Then, one hundred years, called the harmonious reckoning of things and cycles. All people ought to model their years upon these. Yet since the loss of the three laws, many do not complete their allotted years. Each surplus year is recorded as one reckoning in Heaven, but as people’s conduct strays from the Dao of Heaven, none can claim them. Now, those who emulate this text and act with goodness—Heaven will bestow all these reckonings upon them, some attaining transcendence, others extending their years.\n\nSince the [lacuna] of Heaven and Earth, emperors have been consumed by worry, for the world is not at peace, and the loss of proper order is the source of their distress. Without this, there would be no cause for concern. The world’s good people, loyal ministers, and filial children all share this worry. Yet by following this text, such worries will be dispelled.\n\nHeaven declares: When yang qi flourishes greatly, ghostly beings cannot act recklessly to cause harm. Why is this? When yang is abundant, yin must wane, and thus such beings cannot act recklessly. Who restrains them? The essence of yang restrains them. How does the essence of yang restrain them? The essence of yang is spirit, belonging to Heaven, associated with red, and governing the heart. The heart-spirit is the spirit of Heaven. Essence belongs to Earth. Ghosts are the ghosts of humans. Earth is the mother; ghosts are the children. Mother and child follow the same path and dwell together in the way of yin. When the qi of Great Peace arrives and yang qi flourishes greatly, the Dao of Heaven is strict, and the way of spirits is luminous. When luminous, Heaven enables people to employ it together. When the way of spirits is employed, it descends to dissolve the way of ghostly beings. When the way of spirits flourishes, it aligns with the noble person. The way of ghostly beings aligns with the petty person. Thus, the noble person governs with impartiality, and the spirits likewise govern with impartiality. The petty person governs with deceit and perversity, and ghostly beings likewise govern with deceit and perversity—clearly, they are of the same kind.\n\nNow, when the yang Dao flourishes like fire, weapons will be dissolved and extinguished by fire. Thus, weapons accumulate yin qi, and fire accumulates yang qi. When yang flourishes, it dissolves weapons—this is a natural response.\n\nHuman life must accord with Heaven’s qi. Those of utmost goodness are entrusted to Heaven; those of middling goodness are entrusted to people; those of lesser goodness are entrusted to fields and acres. Thus, the highest scholar studies to transcend the world; the middling scholar ought to govern the people; the lowest scholar ought to manage the fields and wilds. The highest scholar should come with cloud qi; the middling scholar rides in a carriage; the lowest scholar walks on foot. These three types each have distinct duties and do not interfere with one another. The highest scholar transcends the world and ascends to Heaven, regulating the winds and rains of harmony. The middling scholar serves as an official, governing the people. The lowest scholar manages property. Each has their proper duty and does not interfere.\n\nThe methods of those who study the Dao in Heaven are such that one must seek the Dao with utmost sincerity. A small alignment with the lesser Dao allows one to see minor spirits and attain a lesser realization of the Dao. If the gateway does not yet align with the middle Dao, one cannot reach the great Dao. Only by attaining the great Dao can one summon the true spirits. Those who align with the lesser Dao summon lesser spirits; those who align with the middle Dao summon middling spirits; those who align with the great Dao summon great spirits. When the great spirits arrive, one attains transcendence and eternal existence. Yet even here, there are great demonic spirits and ghosts that do not wish for people to transcend the world. They confuse and delude people, causing them to falter, and then manifest as strange transformations, mingling truth and falsehood. Only by discerning the true from the perverse at this point can one transcend the world.\n\nIn Heaven, the highest scholar, from birth to death, harbors not a single evil thought and is thus beloved by all people. The people of the five directions and local officials all bestow gifts upon them. The middling scholar is beloved by their neighbors, who together bestow gifts upon them. The lowest scholar, devoid of any good intentions, receives no gifts but instead steals from their own household. This is what the people of the world [lacuna] do.\n\nWhat does [lacuna] mean? The highest scholar is purely good, their heart and mind free of evil—this is the highest yang. The middling scholar’s heart and mind are half good—this is the middle yang. The lowest scholar’s heart and mind are entirely devoid of goodness—this is the lowest yang. Thus, they are called [lacuna]. [Lacuna] does not become substantial, empty within like a husk without grain, for they lack true sincerity. Those without sincerity are called [lacuna] people.\n\nThe highest scholar who receives gifts from local officials and people from all directions bestows them upon their household, signifying they do not forget their ancestral roots. The middling scholar who receives gifts from their neighbors bestows them upon their household, signifying they do not forget their parents. The lowest scholar, in contrast, steals from their own household’s wealth to give to neighboring villages—this mirrors their [lacuna], hollow within yet full without, turning their back on their origins. All such acts harm the heavens above, for to betray one’s household is to rend its harmony, and all discord stems from such a person.\n\nWhen a minister engages in external alliances, their state will surely be emptied; when a household member engages in external alliances, their household will surely be emptied. The calamities of heaven all arise from this. Indeed, safety and peril originate within the human heart, while the numinous and divine are perceived from afar. Above and below, near and far, their vision penetrates a hundred million miles—how can one not be cautious?\n\nThe Way of Great Peace is concise in its teachings yet enriches the state; it is the mandate of heaven and the treasure of the self. Emerging close from the heart and mind, it circulates throughout the world. When this teaching is practiced, the state may be secured, and households may prosper. The laws of heaven and earth decree that the good govern the wicked, the upright govern the perverse, and the pure govern the turbid. One must not allow the wicked to govern the good, the perverse to govern the upright, or the turbid to govern the pure—such are the commands of rebellion. Banditry will not cease, villainy will multiply daily, and great chaos will arise from this.\n\nWhen an emperor or king appoints a minister, they must carefully examine their selection, ensuring their choice aligns with the celestial heart and the constellations before daring to appoint them. The sun embodies the virtue of the ruler; the moon embodies the virtue of the minister. If the constellations do not align, great peace cannot be achieved, and villainy will arise.\n\nConsider the heavens above and the earth below, the eight directions and the central crossroads—what are the lodgings, provisions, and resting places like? Those who practice the Dao and virtue yet harbor doubts may resolve them through this prophecy.\n\nToday, in the heavens above, there are official lodges and postal stations to accommodate travelers, just as on earth there are official lodges and postal stations to accommodate travelers. In the eight directions and the central realm, all have them. The celestial lodges house immortals and transcendents; the earthly lodges house sages and worthies; the subterranean lodges house the yin spirits, the good gods, and the benevolent dead. The lodges in the distant eight directions, the famous mountains, and the great rivers house the spirits of heaven and earth. For those immortals who have yet to ascend to heaven, the clouds and winds provide shelter. The lodges and postal stations at the North Pole and Kunlun await the sages, worthies, and meritorious good spirits.\n\nThe Dao is the head, virtue the belly, and benevolence the feet that carry one forward. Heaven establishes lodges and postal stations for those who dwell within them. Those who seek the power of heaven must practice the Dao; those who seek the power of earth must practice virtue; those who seek the power of humanity must practice benevolence. These three are the endless path. To lose them is the root of chaos. To disregard these three is to rebel against heaven.\n\nThus, the sage embraces the Dao, practices virtue, and acts with benevolence. To go beyond this is to belong to the realm of the myriad things.\n\nMay I ask: How do the spirits of the four seasons assist in governance, bringing forth goodness and eliminating evil? Which invokes the great spirits, which the middling spirits, and which the lesser spirits?\n\nTo contemplate the imperial qi of the sun, the moon’s phases, and the establishment of the month is to invoke the great spirits. To contemplate the ministerial qi is to invoke the middling spirits. To contemplate the destructive qi is to invoke the lesser spirits. To contemplate the aged qi following the moon’s establishment is to invoke aged beings. To contemplate the ailing and declining qi following the moon’s establishment is to invoke malevolent ghosts. To contemplate the dead qi following the moon’s establishment is to invoke pure ghosts. To contemplate the broken qi following the moon’s establishment is to invoke destruction, slaughter, misfortune, and harm.\n\nThe generative qi belongs to heaven, to yang, to what lies ahead. The heavenly Dao uses spirit qi to give life, thus the six spirits before the Dipper are all generative. The six spirits behind the Dipper belong to earth and to yin. The heavenly Dao uses the dead qi to create ghosts and bring misfortune and calamity to beings.\n\nIf one wishes for future generations to always be reverent and trustworthy, to cherish and love themselves, so that the numinous spirits and essence qi never depart from their bodies, they will neither know old age nor death. For the numinous spirits and essence qi follow the movements of the mind and do not leave the body. When the numinous spirits remain constant, one does not fall ill or age, and one’s journey is not beset by evil. But if the numinous spirits depart, the sick will die at once, and the traveler will encounter misfortune—this is the great proof.\n\nIf one wishes to avoid illness, one must guard their essence with care. In all matters, one must not exceed what is natural, for within the natural there is no spirit. In all matters, if one does not become spirit, one does not surpass the great Dao and the nature of heaven and earth. Without great spirit within, nothing can be accomplished, and one cannot preserve oneself. Thus, the Dao of heaven and earth relies on spirit to act naturally.\n\nTherefore, in all matters, great or small, there is spirit. The great have great spirit, the small have small spirit, and each preserves and nurtures their own spirit to endure. When spirit diminishes, one ages; when spirit departs, one dies—this is the natural division. How can one forcibly contend against it?\n\nIn all matters, safety and peril lie in spirit. Thus, the body is the household, qi the carriage and horses, and spirit the magistrate who governs rise and fall, coming and going. If there is a body but no spirit, it is like having fields, a home, and city walls but no magistrate. The magistrate is the arbiter of life for the people.\n\nLoyal ministers, filial children, and those who greatly accord with the Dao should act accordingly. If one’s body is not loyal to their superior nor filial to their parents, they betray themselves, invite punishment, and lose their foundation. Always contemplate good spirits, and they will gather and follow you. Contemplate evil spirits, and they too will gather and follow you, entering your belly and moving as your thoughts direct, causing distress and restlessness that cannot be forgotten.\n\nMay I ask: The child in the womb does not eat but absorbs qi. The natural qi within the womb is already born, breathing the qi of yin and yang. If one guards the Dao and studies diligently, they return to the natural qi. To return to the natural qi, the heart must be like that of an infant—then life is born. To follow the breathing of the qi of yin and yang is to die.\n\n*End of the Eighth Scroll of the Abridged *Scripture of Great Peace*, Xin Section*\n\n*The Ninth Scroll of the Abridged *Scripture of Great Peace*, Ren Section*\n\nOrdinary people cannot restrain one another, so each must govern their own fate. Those who do evil will be punished by Heaven. Thus, petty men may be punished by mediocre men, mediocre men by superior men, and superior men by the great. Even minor transgressions against the law lead to peril and ruin.\n\nThe judgments of spirits, great and small, follow the same principle. If one cannot restrain themselves, Heaven will surely punish them. Heaven reveres the Dao, and the Dao reveres the natural. That Heaven reveres the Dao is because Heaven embodies the utmost conduct. If the Dao is abandoned and not practiced, the Way of Heaven falls into chaos and ruin, leading to peril and the loss of all laws and measures.\n\nThus, the natural compels the Way of Heaven and Earth to be preserved. When the Dao is practiced without ceasing, yin and yang transmit and bequeath life to one another. The Dao is the master of life; if the Dao is severed, the myriad things will not be born. If the myriad things do not arise, there will be no generations to transmit, and without transmission, all will perish—how then could Heaven and Earth endure? Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, must transmit and beget one another. If this ceases, they will perish. Thus, Heaven fears the severing of the Dao and the ensuing peril.\n\nThat the Dao reveres the natural is because the Way of Heaven cannot be accomplished without it. All things are completed only through the natural; without it, nothing can be truly achieved. Even if something is accomplished, it will be false and cannot endure.\n\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast and distant from one another, their governance of fate allows no escape.\n\nMay I ask: When the qi of Great Peace arrives in full, and one wishes to constantly employ good intentions to dispel wickedness, what should be prioritized?\n\nThe nature of Heaven and Earth is half yang and half yin. Yang is good and governs rewards and bestowals. Yin is evil, and evil brings punishments and penalties, governing deceit and falsehood. When rewards are many and punishments few, when the cunning are many and the rewarded few, the gates of deceit open. The reason is this: when punishments are many and executions frequent, those who violate the law become wicked criminals, thus opening the gates of deceit and multiplying the cunning.\n\nYang governs rewards and bestowals. When its bounty is abundant, virtue and power prevail. Yang and virtue govern nurturance and life—this is the law of the natural. Thus, day is yang, the sun, the ruler, and virtue; night is yin, the moon, the minister, and deceit. The nature of Heaven and Earth is half good and half evil.\n\nTherefore, the noble person, through supreme goodness, shuts the gates of deceit. Those who promote goodness receive goodness; those who promote evil receive evil. This is like pitting a dou against a dou—what is not a dou naturally flees; like measuring with a chi against a chi—what is not a chi naturally falls away. It is as though square and circle cannot align, compass and square cannot meet, and warp and weft cannot join.\n\nThus, when yang arises, it moves in accord with its kind. When fire blazes, thunder roars, and the Vermilion Bird appears within. This is why thunder comes in summer and hides in winter. All things follow their roots—only then can the Way of Heaven be understood. Without tracing their kind, how could the sage and worthy attain profound knowledge?\n\nSince the opening of Heaven and Earth, the goodness, evil, truth, and falsehood of people can be discerned by observing their conduct and seeking its kind. Their success or failure, the good and the bad, the worthy and the unworthy—all can be seen. Why engage in futile disputes?\n\nMay I ask: From ancient times to the present, the worthy, the enlightened, the wise, the eloquent, the strong, and the brave—these six types of people all possess talents a myriad times greater than others. Could they be without good or evil?\n\nThese six possess talents a myriad times greater than ordinary people. If their talents harmonize with Heaven and Earth, preventing the rise of all evil and harmful influences, the emperor will live long without worry, free from illness, fulfilling their natural lifespan, and their benevolence will flow to all people. Such worthy, enlightened, wise, eloquent, strong, and brave individuals are of great goodness and benefit.\n\nYet if they cannot harmonize with Heaven and Earth, if the emperor suffers worry and short life, if they themselves fall ill, are afflicted by disasters they cannot dispel, or die prematurely like ordinary people—then these six are of no benefit. One need only examine their achievements. Those who succeed are right; those who fail are wrong.\n\nActing thus aligns deeply with the will of August Heaven. The emperor’s lifespan is extended, and the myriad things are all well-governed.\n\nMay I ask: Among all things, some fail to be born at their appointed time, some are not nurtured, and some do not mature—where do these great faults originate?\n\nWhen things that should be born are not born, the fault lies with Heaven. When things that should be nurtured are not nurtured, the fault lies with Earth. Heaven and Earth are the dwelling of the myriad things; the worthy are their artisans. The emperor embodies Heaven and constantly desires to give life. The empress embodies Earth and constantly desires to nurture. The great ministers embody humanity and constantly desire to bring things to completion. When these three work in unison, all things, from birth to end, suffer no harm.\n\nTo emulate the Way of equilibrium, those who establish laws must do likewise.\n\nMay I ask: Does the Way of Heaven aid the weak, the strong, the few, or the many?\n\nThe divine person says: The Way of Heaven aids the weak.\n\nWhy? The weak are the function of the Dao. The few are the essence of the Dao. Thus, the North Star, though one, commands the host of stars—ruling the many with the few. The essence of the Dao is one, and the Dao follows it.\n\nTherefore, the king is few, yet the world aids and governs itself—this is the efficacy of aiding the few. Parents, though strong, instead aid the infant—this is the efficacy of the strong aiding the weak.\n\nThe supremely good are few and weak, while the ungood are strong and many. Yet when many, they become few; when strong, they become weak. Thus, the noble person seeks weakness, not strength; seeks fewness, not multitude. Therefore, the Way of Heaven protects them.\n\nThey do not contend with others, yet others contend among themselves. They do not vie for strength, yet others aid them in becoming strong. Thus, without contention, they achieve good victory.\n\nDistinguish the essence of the Way of Heaven from the body and virtue without separation.\n\nMay I ask: If the Dao is truly joyful and desirous of practice, what is its clear proof?\n\nThe Divine Person says: I received this text from the celestial deities, who declared, \"We hear that it harmonizes with yin and yang, wind and rain, cold and heat—this is its great efficacy. Heaven delights in the practice of its Way, yet people do not clearly believe in it, so we demonstrate its efficacy by granting or withholding rain. When the Way of Great Peace is practiced, all prayers are answered. When the Way of Great Peace is not practiced, prayers go unanswered, clearly showing that the Dao of Heaven resides in Great Peace.\n\nThus, when the myriad things fail to be born, the fault lies in the Great Yang. When born but not nurtured, the fault lies in the Great Yin. When nurtured but not brought to completion, the fault lies in the harmony of the center. Therefore, birth is the father, nurturing the aged is the mother, and completion is the child. Birth is the Dao, nurturing is virtue, and completion is benevolence. If a single thing is not born, one aspect of the Dao is blocked and obstructed. If a single thing is not nurtured, one aspect of virtue is left uncultivated. If one aspect of virtue is not completed, one aspect of benevolence is not practiced. To know for oneself whether one possesses the Dao, virtue, and benevolence, observe the myriad things and you will know.\n\nFor the Five—Emperor, King, Lord, Father, and Teacher—who deeply wish to understand the excellence or deficiency of the Dao, virtue, and benevolence, they need only observe this. Thus, the foremost good in governance is none other than delighting in birth; the next good is delighting in nurture; and the next is delighting in bestowal. Therefore, birth resembles Heaven, nurture resembles Earth, and bestowal resembles benevolence. These three are the great principles of Heaven, Earth, and humanity. Those below this are merely reserved for times of exhaustion before being employed.\n\nWhen this is so, the qi of Heaven naturally becomes peaceful, perverse qi naturally vanishes, good people naturally arrive, and evil people naturally depart—all respond without fail. The one who clarifies this is the Teacher, for the Teacher is the title of the one who knows first and should take evidence as the basis for clarification. From ancient times to the present, all texts emerge from Heaven and Earth; thus, Heaven and Earth produce them first, and the one who clarifies them is the Teacher. Therefore, every text that emerges has a Teacher, and the one who practices it is the magistrate.\n\nIn ancient times, the Emperor and King received the Mandate of Heaven, accepted the Teacher’s instruction, and diligently practiced it to eliminate disasters and calamities, thereby fulfilling Heaven’s will. This is how they attained longevity and extended their mandate. The Creator is Heaven, the clarifier is the Teacher, and the practitioner is the Emperor and King. These three matters depend on one another to be accomplished. If Heaven does not produce the text, the Teacher has no way to know it; if the Teacher does not clarify the text, the Emperor and King have no way to know how to govern.\n\nThus, when Heaven intends to raise up an Emperor or King, there must be an extraordinary text that emerges, and a wise Teacher is sent to instruct the Emperor, King, and magistrates, enabling them to attain longevity—this is the clear proof of Heaven’s protection of the Emperor and King.\n\nWhen the people and the myriad things fail to be born, are born but not nurtured, are nurtured but do not grow, grow but do not reach completion, or do not fulfill their natural lifespan, where does the fault lie? When the people and the myriad things are not born, it is Heaven’s fault; when they are not nurtured, it is Earth’s fault; when they grow but do not reach completion, it is humanity’s fault. Does the fault lie with humanity?\n\nWhen the myriad things do not receive the timely opportunity to be born, it is the ruler’s fault; when born but not nurtured, it is the minister’s fault; when they grow but do not reach completion, it is the people’s fault. Heaven and the ruler-father preside over birth—this is the leadership of the Great Yang, the origin of birth. If Heaven does not desire birth, things cannot be born; if the father does not desire to bestow, things also cannot be born; if the ruler does not desire birth, things also cannot be born. Thus, Heaven and the ruler-father preside over birth.\n\nIf the ruler-father constantly contemplates birth and does not delight in killing, all things will flourish. A single thought of killing results in the death of one thing; ten thoughts of killing result in the death of ten things; a hundred thoughts of killing result in the death of a hundred things—from this up to ten thousand thoughts, all are like this. The Earth-mother and ministers, receiving the bestowal of Yang, preside over the nurturing and growth of the myriad things. Do they constantly contemplate nurturing without fail? A single thought of failing to nurture injures one thing; ten thoughts injure ten things; a hundred thoughts injure a hundred things—from this up to ten thousand, it is likewise so.\n\nThus, the Emperors and Kings of high antiquity, in appointing ministers, always sought those who were compassionate and benevolent, who delighted in nurturing the myriad things and governing accordingly. In middle antiquity, they were half compassionate and benevolent, so half of the things were harmed. In later antiquity, they did not carefully select and appoint ministers, so all the myriad things were harmed. The virtue of the August Emperor and King is radiant indeed!\n\nThe Emperor acts as wisdom between Heaven and Earth, preventing them from falling into calamity and evil—thus he is called Emperor. The King is one to whom the people and the myriad things turn without harm—thus he is called King. *Wang* means \"to go forth.\" The Lord ensures that each remains within their proper bounds, and people turn to him without harm—thus he is called Lord. *Jun* means \"title.\" The official governs and assists the superior in managing things, ensuring that all people and things, great and small, do not lose their proper governance—only then is he worthy of being called an official. The Teacher thoroughly understands all the words under Heaven—only then is he worthy of being called a Great Teacher, that is, one who can interpret all the texts of Heaven and Earth. Thus, they are worthy of being called August Emperor, King, Lord, and Teacher.\n\nTherefore, the August Way is the head, the Emperor’s Way is the torso, the King’s Way is the thighs, and the officials are the hands and feet. The Teacher’s Way is the plumb line, the law, and the standard, upon which the above and below depend to stand. Thus, those who govern well constantly contemplate the August Way, moderately contemplate the Emperor’s Way, and below contemplate the Lord’s and officials’ Way. They constantly recite the Great Teacher’s laws and standards, adhering to their plumb line. Only then can Heaven’s will be at peace, Earth’s intent be attained, the four seasons naturally follow their course, the Five Phases do not contend, the Three Luminaries remain bright, ghosts, spirits, and essence-qi do no harm, the Five Offices and Five Scholars each attain their proper place, bandits and thieves do not arise, and the Emperor and King govern with folded arms, all proclaiming \"ten thousand years.\"\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is the law—without my text, it is truly difficult. Carefully ponder its meaning and practice these two matters; there are also warnings therein. The nature of Heaven and Earth is such that essence, qi, ghosts, and spirits act, governing, learning from, and teaching people. The spirit resides in the yin of the human heart, essence resides in the yin of human worthiness, and ghosts reside in the yin of the human liver. When people contemplate upright goodness, they thereby teach others to do good. They constantly reside in the yin of the viscera, urging people toward evil and teaching them to do evil, thereby also urging people toward evil.\n\nThe sages and worthies of antiquity constantly harbored yin thoughts of goodness within their bellies, thus receiving good responses. Ordinary people constantly harbor yin thoughts of evil within their bellies, thus receiving evil responses, unable to restrain themselves. The fault lies in the constant yin contemplation of good and evil; ghosts and spirits thereby incline toward good or evil. That ghosts reside here can be verified. When the qi of Great Peace prevails, wind and rain come in their seasons, the myriad things flourish and grow abundantly, and the earth is well-fertilized, becoming daily more robust and prosperous, capable of nurturing life. In inauspicious years, rain and moisture do not come in their seasons, the myriad things on earth grow sparse and few, short and stunted, unable to fertilize themselves, so the earth becomes daily poorer and thinner, with little possibility of bringing the myriad things to fruition.\n\nThe movements of Heaven and Earth still require the mutual attainment and harmony of yin and yang before Great Peace can be achieved, thereby bringing about the officials of the four seasons and five phases. The Emperor and King govern according to the monthly establishment before and after; their office is to manage the Emperor’s qi and expel the officials of evil and wickedness. The establishing qi and the kingly qi are indeed the Emperor’s qi of Heaven’s four seasons and five phases. The ministerial qi and the removing qi come before the first, serving as the officials who straighten the forelocks and point directly ahead. What they face are hidden villains, prevented from acting harmfully. The removing qi, the filling qi, and the pacifying qi are all good and virtuous officials. The five executors who reside in the forefront act in advance as the Emperor’s qi, executing and removing great evil. The five generals who establish the forefront all receive the correct qi of Heaven, all being divine officials of Heaven, serving as Heaven’s envoys. Without exception, the ten thousand things of the twelve thousand categories all don the virtue of these officials and follow their transformations.\n\nWhen the kingly qi should die, when the monthly establishment should be broken—this is the most revered and majestic qi, thus it cannot be withstood. When it should die, it is called the great consuming killing qi. The period after the monthly establishment is closed, blocking and sealing away evil and villainy, fearing that the resting and hidden qi that follow may encroach upon the Emperor’s establishing qi. Thus Heaven closes what comes after, and when it opens again, it dispels the resting evil qi, teaching it to depart. What comes after becomes the accomplice of villainy, so it should be gathered in. The latter five are perilous; perilous because their position is near Heaven’s great executioner, and with one turn, destruction strikes, hence it is perilous. These latter five generals Heaven wishes to rest, aligning them with Earth’s qi, governing closure and concealment, where villainous ghosts and spirits reside together, and they must not be employed.\n\nSomeone asked: The north is the beginning of the Sovereign, the east is the beginning of the Emperor, the south is the beginning of the King, and the west is the beginning of the Hegemon. Now Heaven has the six jia and twelve branches; where should the Sovereign’s Way begin? It is thus: Heaven has three systems, each with great absence. The first is the Heavenly Sovereign, the second is the Emperor, the third is the King, and the fourth is the Hegemon. The Heavenly Sovereign begins with the first jia-zi, the Earthly Sovereign begins with yi-chou, the Human Sovereign begins with bing-yin, and the Hegemon’s Way begins with ding-mao. These are the celestial reckonings of qi and numbers. As for the earthly reckoning, the Sovereign’s Way begins with zi, the Emperor’s Way begins with chou, the King’s Way begins with yin, and the Hegemon’s Way begins with mao. These four, having initially received the subtle qi of Heaven and Earth to bring forth life, must not incur punishment. Those who incur punishment harm the Sovereign’s Way; the Way’s law must not be harmed. Thus, zi punishes mao, chou punishes xu, and yin punishes si—all emit punitive qi and do not reside together.\n\nSomeone asked: Heaven bestows ranks upon people according to degree, Earth bestows ranks upon people according to degree, and people bestow ranks upon people according to degree—may this be heard? It is said: Heaven bestows upon people through the Dao, Earth bestows upon people through nurturing virtue, and people bestow upon people through emolument and sustenance. Why? Heaven, by means of the Dao, is distinct and enduring, thus it bestows the Dao, enabling longevity and satiety through consuming wind and qi. Earth, governing the nurturing of good land, makes people prosperous, thus it bestows upon people with virtue and wealth. The ruler bestows upon people with emolument and sustenance, granting them clothing. These three matters are all good. Those who love the Dao without ceasing are thus bestowed by Heaven. Those who love virtue and the earth, knowing how to select land to dwell in, avoiding misfortune and attaining good fortune, are bestowed by Earth. Those who love learning and benefit the governance of their superiors cannot be distanced by the ruler and father, who must manage affairs with principle, thus they are bestowed by people. These are the three matters the sages and worthies of antiquity diligently studied, never daring to lose. Thus, some attained the Dao and departed, some withdrew from the world and returned to the earth, and some obtained the ruler’s emolument and sustenance.\n\nSomeone asked: As for the enjoyment of the five notes, what is it like to attain their sound, and what is it like not to attain their sound—may both be heard? Sound is not empty; it achieves true matters, brings reality through emptiness, and is the method of summoning the embodied from the formless. Music, through sound and resonance, summons matters—like a person opening their mouth to emit sound, which may be good or evil. Good brings fortune, evil brings misfortune. This scripture all emerges from the human mouth, thereby bringing responses of good and evil. The sounds of music are the language of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang and the five phases. By listening to their sounds, one knows the sentiments of Heaven and Earth, the harmony of the four seasons and five phases’ qi—there is no end to what can be known. Thus, the superior person attains its meaning to govern with balance and measure; the middling person employs it to assist the ruler in governance and attain longevity; the worthy person employs it to attain freedom from worry. Sound, uniting one with the myriad things, the myriad things uniting without limit, all under Heaven is fully prepared.\n\nSomeone asked why *The Scripture of Great Peace* has one hundred seventy scrolls. It is said: The number one is the beginning of all numbers. Thus, when Heaven and Earth were not yet divided, accumulated qi formed a single unity. Divided into two, they became husband and wife. Heaven spread upon Earth, conceiving in the dark and obscure, named jia-zi, spreading roots in the northeast. Chou became the beginning of yin, appearing in the east. The sun rises at mao, completing birth in the southeast. Chen and si hang branches in the south, nurturing at wu, turning old toward the southwest, wei and shen, maturing in the west. The sun sets at you, completing concealment in the northwest, xu and hai.\n\nThus, numbers begin with one and culminate in the root of the twelve stems and the foundation of the Five Phases. Therefore, one completes ten and a hundred to achieve fullness. Hence, when Heaven generates things, spring resounds for a hundred days, desiring to bring all to completion. Thus, the celestial Dipper establishes *chen* and is broken at *xu*. *Jian* means to stand—all things fully arise in *chen*. *Po* means to decay—all things fully perish in *xu*. Therefore, numbers descend from Heaven and ascend from Earth across the eight directions, completing ten in fullness. Yin and yang establish and break, moving in cycles of seven, returning to their origin. Following the Dipper’s pointer to clarify affairs, the Dipper’s seven stars illuminate the beginning and end of yin and yang. Thus, *The Scripture of Great Peace* in one hundred seventy scrolls models the numbers of Heaven and Earth, accords with the patterns of yin and yang, and follows the Four Seasons and Five Phases as its practice, not daring to err by even a fraction. To lose this is to sever from Heaven, leaving affairs without foundation, failing to align with the intent of Heaven and Earth, and not following celestial numbers to form scripture—rendering it useless for governing the world. Without modeling the laws of Heaven and Earth, it cannot dispel harm. To know its efficacy: gather the scattered texts of the world, amass them across thirty *li*, and even if Heaven were to enact them, they could not dissolve disasters. Beneath the great Heaven, within eighty-one regions and ten thousand one hundred states, each possesses its own writings, all desiring to eliminate evil, bring forth goodness, and dispel calamities. Yet if all were collected and assembled within a hundred *li*, even if raised to Heaven, they could not eradicate disasters. Though these texts are few, if the emperor and kings could practice them, they would surely await manifest efficacy.\n\nIn highest antiquity, the first were the Divine Persons, the second the Perfected Persons, the third the Immortals, and the fourth the Dao Persons—all modeled Heaven to grasp the true intent of the Dao. Dazzling the eyes to look inward, they ordered their minds within, their hidden brightness reversing to penetrate the Great Yang, inwardly attaining the essentials of the Dao alone. Like fire making light shine within but not without, they preserved constancy without disorder. Those who now study transcendence of the world model the ancients by turning their gaze inward—this is what it means. Over time, transmission begets transmission, and it again declines, turning daily to loathe its own deeds. Transmission loses the Dao’s intent, failing to illuminate within, and daily grows more disordered. Thus, Heaven produces sages, modeling celestial patterns to order the world, for celestial patterns are self-evident. When celestial patterns are correct, Heaven is correct; when earthly patterns are correct, Earth is correct; when human patterns are correct, humans are correct. When Heaven, Earth, and humans are all correct, the myriad things are wholly correct. Humans are the foremost of the myriad things. If humans lose their proper role and suffer harm, not dying of old age, the myriad things follow suit, as do Heaven and Earth. Perverse *qi* surges greatly, and people fall ill, not exhausting their Heaven-appointed years. Only the practices of past and present each have their proper sequence, not transgressing one another.\n\nThe Most Exalted Divine Sovereign of the Highest Antiquity, who names himself the Duke of Entrusted *Qi*—also called the Great Spirit—dwells perpetually at the left side of the Celestial Lord, presiding over the governance of the texts of the Luminous Hall’s patterns, ensuring their distinctions are clear and their great duties meticulously administered. He enables the ruler to commune with the immortals, recording those yet unborn, each with their names, years, months, days, and hours. When the time for their ascension arrives, spirits are dispatched to instruct and transform their bodies, that they may ascend. Each has their name, years, months, days, and hours; when the appointed time for ascension comes, spirits are sent to instruct and transform them, that their bodies may ascend.\n\nAccording to their wisdom and ability, each is assigned roles without forgetfulness, their distinctions made known, allowing them to declare their own capacities before being entrusted with duties. They submit and proclaim: \"The Great Spirit, supreme above all, oversees the host of spirits, each with their own domains. These must be clearly understood, leaving no room for doubt. The registers of longevity must be meticulously examined. Those of sagely illumination and intent should be granted all that lives beneath the sun.\"\n\nAgain, through ledgers, tallies, and calculations, their accounts are made clear, entrusted to the Bureau of Accounts, which oversees the quantities of money and treasures. All those who must submit accounts do so in advance, and the Bureau of Accounts, in concert with the Ministry of Agriculture, presents them on the thirtieth day of long months and the twenty-ninth of short months, assembling before the Great Spirit of the Luminous Hall. No delay is permitted, as the Celestial Lord commands, and none may miss the appointed time within the first three *ke* of dawn. The Great Spirit of the Luminous Hall, receiving the reports at the fifth *ke*, acts in accordance with the Celestial Lord’s established decrees.\n\nThe Great Spirit receives the Celestial Lord’s mandate and delegates it to the Minister of Agriculture, who in turn transmits it to the subordinate prefectures and kingdoms. Each domain reports what it oversees, submitting ledgers of what is to be delivered to the Ministry of Agriculture. Should any be remiss in timely submission, the Minister of Agriculture reports to the Great Spirit of the Luminous Hall, who then informs the Celestial Lord. A decree is issued to the Minister of Agriculture, commanding the prefectures and kingdoms to hasten compliance, ensuring no delay beyond the prescribed time. The transmission of hours and *ke* is strictly ordered, with no disorder permitted; all documents must be uniform, each with its duplicate.\n\nIn Heaven, there are no disasters of flood or drought, and no records may be falsified with additions or omissions. When the Wheel of Fate turns, no delays or pretexts are tolerated, lest one be found guilty of self-serving deception. Those who become aware of such matters must report them, for Heaven is ever watchful, and transgressions are never pardoned. Let each attend diligently to their duties and clarify their affairs. The Celestial Lord foreknows all, though he does not speak aloud; one must carefully consider his inquiries and not disregard his words.\n\nFloods and droughts are without constancy, disasters and calamities arise together, people fall ill and die in countless numbers—all due to the failure to follow the Celestial Lord’s teachings. The Celestial Lord’s decrees are issued to the Great Spirit, the ministers and officials of the two-thousand-*shi* rank, and all spirits in office, charging them to devote themselves wholly to loyalty and action, aligning their hearts with the Celestial Lord’s will. The Celestial Lord, together with the masters of transformation, rectifies those worthy of ascension. Each is made to embody divine radiance, their transformations corresponding to their rank and station, all ordered by hierarchy and office.\n\nThe Celestial Lord commands the Great Spirit to perpetually transform and perfect them. Each person measures their own capacity, their aspirations growing daily, yearning for ascension. Their transformed bodies shine with luminous splendor, visible even at midday, their pure spirits penetrating all, drifting and roaming beyond the eight directions. They observe Heaven’s works, discerning its movements, each following what is fitting. Their audiences with Heaven occur on fixed days. At the establishment of each month’s first day, the greater and lesser spirits arrange themselves in order, their ranks and precedence clearly delineated.\n\nThe morning court assemblies of the great ministers do not exceed the dawn gathering; the host of spirits each clarify their domains, conducting inspections without fixed schedule, ensuring the accuracy of their documents and holding accountable those in office. Those who have matters to report must first open the Luminous Hall before speaking. Each must demonstrate their clarity and bear their responsibilities, never lacking in merit or efficacy.\n\nThe Celestial Lord commands the Great Spirit and the assembled officials to rectify their deportment, ensuring no errors or deviations, each examining their domains according to the statutes. Should Heaven become aware of their faults, they will not be absolved. Let each be vigilant in their duties, lest they be found wanting by the spirits.\n\nThe Celestial Lord commands the Great Spirit: \"Within the prefectures and kingdoms, those of sagely wisdom and intent, who constantly yearn for the arts of life and wish to walk the path of divine immortals, aligning their thoughts with Heaven—those who desire to bestow kindness upon others, contemplating generation and transformation, aiding Heaven in governing life and Earth in nurturing form, and who aspire to benevolent transformation—let their names be submitted to the Great Spirit, with their merits recorded in documents, their trustworthiness attested. Their intentions shall be reported, and the Celestial Lord will personally determine their number, each recommended spirit being held accountable. The prefectures and kingdoms must select only the most excellent.\"\n\nThe Celestial Lord commands the Luminous Hall: \"All who serve the Celestial Lord in governing the myriad offices must cultivate impartiality of heart. Each must act within their Heaven-appointed domains, ensuring order and distinction, devoting themselves wholly to loyalty and sincerity, communicating all they know, striving to perfect their works and govern their affairs. Let their reputations be steadfast and their insights advanced; let their voices carry far, their thoughts expressed without reserve. Though the Celestial Lord foreknows their words, how can one conceal anything and fail to act with utmost loyalty?\"\n\nIt is asked: \"Now, wishing to further illuminate the methods of sagely worthies and benevolence, and to utterly eradicate perverse texts, how can this be made clearer?\"\n\nHeaven suffers from these false and deceptive texts, which must be abolished to embrace the clarity of Heaven’s Dao. The texts of the sages of past and present are the means by which Heaven and Earth are ordered. When the texts of the sages are luminous, the Dao of Heaven is greatly ordered. What the August Heaven finds displeasing and unjoyful gives rise to warfare, floods, droughts, and unending disasters. The rulers grieve, saying that the texts of the sages have gradually fallen into disorder and obscurity, hence the Dao of Heaven is clouded and difficult to govern. When the texts of the sages are disordered, the Dao of Heaven is likewise disordered; when the texts of the sages are abandoned and unused, the Dao of Heaven is also abandoned and unused.\n\n---\n\nSomeone asked: \"In ancient times, there were no texts, yet the Dao of Heaven was not in disorder. At that time, the celestial contract had not yet emerged. The Supreme August Ones, the divine beings, and the ancestral spirits governed the primal ancestors, originally sharing the same body as August Heaven. Over time, they drifted far from the Dao of Heaven, and chaos arose as they no longer understood Heaven’s intent. Thus, Heaven produced the contract, causing the sages to record and transmit it. Yet the sages did not remain long, so they inscribed it and left it for later generations. When the qi of Great Peace arrives, the Dao of Heaven will be properly ordered.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"If one wishes to govern qi and affairs to attain longevity, may this be heard?\"\n\"Carefully consider my words: August Heaven has its constant laws. For those who rule as sovereigns, they must emulate Heaven and act accordingly, employing the three norms of Dao, virtue, and benevolence. If the sovereign delights in desirelessness and tranquility, in the morning they must constantly contemplate the Dao, at midday they must constantly contemplate virtue, and in the evening they must constantly contemplate benevolence—then there will be no affairs at all.\"\n\n\"May I hear why in the morning one contemplates the Dao, at midday virtue, and in the evening benevolence?\"\n\"The Dao of Heaven may be followed but not opposed. Those who follow Heaven prosper; those who oppose it perish. Now, may I speak of its essential meaning? Heaven has four seasons and three divisions: morning governs generation, midday governs nurturance, and evening governs bestowal. Thus, the southeast generates, the southwest nurtures, and the northwest bestows. Therefore, humans emulate Heaven in their conduct: in the southeast, they plant and generate; in the southwest, they nurture and grow; from mid-autumn onward, within the summer months, they dwell, marry, and transmit their kind—this is the natural teaching of August Heaven. Thus, the people silently follow it. Those who can constantly emulate this attain Heaven’s intent. Those who cannot emulate this are called opposers of Heaven’s teachings, and thus they inflict much harm. If the harm is slight, spring things are harmed; if the strong and mature are harmed, summer things are harmed; if the elderly are harmed, autumn things are harmed; if the pregnant are harmed, winter things are harmed—this is the natural law. The sage-kings of antiquity constantly reflected on the Dao of Heaven in their actions, not daring to err even by the slightest measure.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Is it possible to hear how one may attain enduring thickness with the Earth?\"\n\"Those who constantly follow what Heaven does will long share thickness with Heaven; those who lightly oppose it will long incur Heaven’s enmity. Thus, the governance of the ancient sage-kings consisted of: first, constant generation; second, constant nurturance; and third, constant bestowal. Acting in this manner, they carefully upheld and revered the name of the Dao of Heaven, which is not disordered. Fourth is governing through punishment without order, and fifth is killing—these are the extremes. By this distinction, the first type of sovereign purely generates, the second purely nurtures, the third purely bestows, the fourth purely punishes, and the fifth purely kills. Those who generate extend years and prosper the state; those who nurture increase lifespans; those who bestow commit no transgressions; those who punish incur illness; and those who kill meet violent ruin. The sage-kings of antiquity observed Heaven’s prohibitions clearly and dared not act recklessly. On the days when the six *jia* and prosperous *qi* were in ascendancy, they did not rage nor speak of evil matters. On such days, they spoke only of good things, partook in food and drink, and made music to halt disasters and dispel inauspicious and malevolent influences. Thus, the royal *qi* always desired to manifest reverence. Therefore, the people of the ancient era who measured the world, and the governance of the sage-kings who followed this, could lie down to govern and reflect, completing their tasks without a single affair. In spring, they lay with their heads to the east; in summer, to the south; in autumn, to the west; in winter, to the north; and during the four seasons, with their heads toward the corners. When rulers, ministers, and the people all knew this method, the inauspicious *qi* of the world was entirely dispelled. The celestial model of governance required that on royal days, weapons from the armories be taken down and buried in the earth. On days of rest and cessation, they were returned, so banditry did not arise, and warfare ceased.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Does Heaven alone grow angry and not respond in harmony with humans—can this be known?\"\n\"Heaven’s principle uses *qi* as its language, manifesting in the four seasons. If the *qi* of the *jue* (wood) angle is unknown, the liver’s pulse does not move, the *jue* cluster is not harmonized, and the clear tone does not resonate—this is when Heaven is displeased and does not speak. The sage-kings of antiquity, seeing this, reflected on the principles of gain and loss to reverse it. When the royal *qi* resides in a place, it attains benevolence to assist its governance. These two *qi* together generate and complete this. When the *qi* of rest and cessation returns, inauspicious *qi* arrives to assist its governance—this makes three *qi*. The *qi* of petty people appears in this, lacking the alignment of Heaven’s position, thus resembling petty people. Heaven sees and illuminates its kind, commanding the worthy and sagely to devise strategies and reflect, seeking reclusive Daoists, virtuous ones, and benevolent ones to reverse and restore its *qi*, establishing resonance. Thus, the ruler who governs the Dao of Heaven uses the people and ministers as limbs; if the governance is not good, the Dao is thrown into disorder. When the sages of antiquity were about to govern the Dao of Heaven, they sought those of Dao, virtue, benevolence, and wisdom to govern together, thereby attaining peace. Thus, Daoists belong to Heaven, virtuous ones to Earth, and benevolent ones to the center and harmony. If the three norms are not harmonized, the three worthies govern them. When the *qi* of Great Peace arrives, all things are properly ordered.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"How can all the people be made entirely benevolent?\"\n\"The Dao of Heaven generates virtue; virtue generates benevolence. Now, if the sovereign takes the Daoist as their teacher and models themselves on the Dao, the sovereign models the Dao, and their ministers attain virtue. The people model themselves on the ministers; if the ministers attain virtue, the people attain benevolence. The lower emulate the upper, and the upper emulate Heaven. As they transform and generate one another, how can the people not all attain benevolence? The sage-kings of antiquity took great Daoists as their teachers to transform those below. The superior sovereign governs like Heaven, the middling sovereign governs like Earth, and the inferior sovereign governs like humans. Those who govern like Heaven do not lose Heaven’s intent, serving the great Dao as a father. Those who govern like Earth do not lose Earth’s intent, serving Earth’s Dao as a mother. Those who govern like humans do not lose human intent, reflecting on and delighting in attaining the Dao of the center and harmony. The sages, seeing all things generated, knew the principle of revering the Dao. Seeing all things nurtured, they knew the truth of virtue.\"\n\nSeeing all things fully matured, they knew the truth of benevolence.\n\nThose who embody the true Dao possess only the mind of generation;\nthose who embody true virtue possess only the nurturing mind;\nthose who embody benevolence possess only the bestowing mind.\nWithout these three—Dao, virtue, and benevolence—one cannot be called a sovereign of Great Peace.\n\nThe celestial scholars above are born of Heaven, receiving the entrusted qi, generated without form.\nKnowing the celestial scholars, what do they not know? What do they not illuminate? What do they not see?\nThey are the primordial qi itself, sharing duties and acting in unison.\nThe celestial scholars constantly reside in the Hall of the Boundless, managing celestial documents in harmony with Heaven.\nWhen upper and lower do not fail in their duties, they know what beings may be generated;\nthen descending to the earthly realm, they enable completion, and all things receive glory.\n\nThe celestial scholars are revered by Heaven and looked up to by all spirits—like the crown prince of an emperor, who would dare show disrespect?\nThe Celestial Sovereign, having received the entrusted qi, is thus named \"Supreme and Unsurpassed Celestial Sovereign.\"\nWhatever he commands or teaches, who would not obey?\n\nIt is asked: When the Dao of the sovereign of Great Peace flourishes, his virtue is second only to Heaven.\nReceiving the scripture and practicing it alone, his transformative influence flows throughout the world—then there can be no imbalance.\nThe greatest spirits are none other than Heaven and Earth; the greatest luminaries are none other than the sun and moon—yet even they are two halves forming one.\nHeaven and Earth each contribute half their power, uniting in heart and desire to harmonize, only then can they generate the myriad things.\nDay and night each contribute half their power to complete one day.\nSpring, summer, autumn, and winter each contribute half their power to complete one year.\nThe moon begins to wax in the west, grows and moves eastward; by the fifteenth day it is called yang, after the fifteenth it wanes and is called yin.\nEach contributes half its power to complete one month.\nMan and woman each contribute half their power, uniting in shared purpose to form one household.\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth is one yin and one yang, each contributing half their power to unite as one, only then can they together complete the whole.\n\nThus, when ruler and minister unite in heart and strength, each contributing half their power, thinking and striving in unison, only then is the principle of Great Peace achieved.\n\nIt is asked: Though the writings of people today are many, and they claim all things are complete, disasters, harms, thieves, and bandits still abound.\nThey are constantly beset by sorrow and suffering, and on these inauspicious days, they worry—officials and people join together to save them, yet cannot.\nWhat is cut off sprouts anew; now I can long supplement what is lacking and ensure no further calamities arise.\n\nSince the emergence of the Celestial Contract, among all the writings of sages and worthies, are there any that are the same? All are different.\nThus, Heaven commands the masters to emerge, to eliminate inauspicious virtue, to shelter the people and ministers, their radiance covering the four directions, their influence echoing near and far, their grace extending even to plants and trees.\nThis is the opening of their intent and purpose—all their scriptures are distinct.\n\nIt is asked: The essential Dao of past and present all speak of \"guarding the One\" as the way to long life and agelessness.\nThose who know to guard the One are said to practice the Dao of the Boundless.\nA person has one body, which should always unite with essence and spirit.\nThe form is the master of death; essence and spirit are the masters of life.\nWhen they are constantly united, it is auspicious; when they depart, it is inauspicious.\nWithout essence and spirit, there is death; with essence and spirit, there is life.\nWhen they are constantly united, they become one, enabling long existence.\nThe constant danger is that essence and spirit scatter and do not gather within the body, instead following human thoughts to wander.\nThus, the sages teach to guard the One, meaning to guard the unity of the body.\nFocus the mind without ceasing, and essence and spirit will naturally come—nothing will fail to respond, and all illnesses will be dispelled.\nThis is the talisman of long life and enduring vision.\n\nYang guards the One; yin guards the two—hence it is called \"destruction.\"\nThus, daytime is yang, and the human hun-soul constantly resides within;\nnighttime is yin, and the hun and po souls contend in activity, giving rise to dreams and illusions, losing their form and dividing into two, leading to death.\nWhen essence and spirit are entirely lost, yet the form alone remains—those who guard the One truly unite as one.\n\nThe essence and spirit of human life are all fully possessed; guarding them without scattering enables transcendence of the world, becoming good parents to the people, meeting the sovereign of Great Peace, and being beloved by spirits and numina.\n\n*End of Scroll Nine of the Abridged Taiping Jing, Ren Section*\n*Beginning of Scroll Ten of the Abridged Taiping Jing, Gui Section*\n\nThe first is the *Divine Dao Writings*, the second is the *Verified Records of Affairs*, and the third is the *Discourse on Discarding Floridity*—together they are called the *Dao of Great Compliance*.\n\n*Tai* (太) means \"great.\" \"Great\" refers to Heaven. Heaven covers and nurtures the myriad things, its merit being the greatest. *Ping* (平) refers to Earth. Earth is level, yet it nourishes and sustains the myriad things. *Jing* (经) means \"constancy.\" Heaven takes the sun, moon, and five planets as its constancy; Earth takes the mountains, rivers, and waterways as its constancy. When Heaven and Earth lose their constant Dao, the myriad things all suffer calamity.\n\nThe Emperor-King models himself above on August Heaven, below on Primal Earth, and in the center on the warp and weft of the stars, mountains, and rivers, nurturing and fostering the myriad things. Thus it is called the *Dao of Great Compliance*.\n\nDivine Persons, Perfected Persons, Sages, and Worthies each divine for themselves what is right and wrong in the law. In ancient times, Divine Persons divined right and wrong, whether they would attain or not—such matters could be observed immediately. Not only was it obscure and indistinct, but it was luminously clear. The divine Dao is most numerous; when one cultivates and accustoms the body’s spirits, rectifies the heart-mind, nothing remains hidden. Good emerges, evil is suppressed, and one knows the methods of good and ill fortune as if gazing into a mirror.\n\nAt such a time, the worthy and enlightened are naturally at peace. The moment does not return, and things do not respond twice. Thus one attains singular flourishing, harmonizing distant regions. When affairs appear, their responses manifest—take care not to resist or oppose them. Compile them as treasured vessels, and it may be called grasping the heart-mind of Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhen affairs are timely, all duties are fulfilled; the divine Dao arrives, the worthy deliberate, the auspicious come, the perverse do not approach, clarity and brightness appear, the four directions rejoice, recluses and hidden scholars emerge, the heart of Heaven is attained, the arts of governance are obtained, perversity does not arise, natural penetration is achieved, Perfected Persons come to assist, the world responds with goodness, each comes with their own affairs, and confusion and disorder depart.\n\nThis response emerges from the abdomen and issues from the heart-mind—it is like the verification of thunder and lightning. Auspicious responses return from within the heart-mind, following thoughts as they come and go. In an instant, they circulate throughout the world. What the heart-mind desires moves August Heaven; yin and yang shift in response. When speech is utterly sincere, it moves Heaven—this is precisely it.\n\nThoughts can bring forth rectitude or give rise to perversity, all arising from the will. They can move Heaven and Earth, harmonize yin and yang, unite the myriad things, enter to transcend the body, and exit to achieve fame. Worthiness and unworthiness all arise from this. Thus the worthy master it without a single error.\n\nWhen a person has faults within, why does their face turn red? The heart is the ruler of the five viscera, and the ruler is the king. The king upholds rectitude; when there is fault, it is reported to Heaven. When startled, why does the face turn green? The liver is the master of the person, and the person is sorrow. When the liver and gallbladder are agitated, anger arises, thus green appears above.\n\nAll spirits have their respective rulers, corresponding with the myriad things. Thus one must always be cautious and good, aligning with Heaven and Earth, so that calamities cannot arise again.\n\nExternal learning is abundant, internal learning is scarce; external affairs daily flourish, while internal affairs daily decline. Thus people are often sick, and floridity abounds. *Fu* (浮) means \"surface,\" and *hua* (华) means \"tip.\" The Dao of Heaven is distant when it enters human perversity, and one cannot return on their own.\n\nThe *Divine Dao Writings* root themselves in union with yin and yang, aligning with the divine luminaries. The *Verified Records of Affairs* examine and verify differences and similarities, leaving no doubts or errors. The *Discourse on Discarding Floridity* has strayed far from the root, dwelling in the wild. Its texts are disordered and cannot be used regularly; they may only be recorded occasionally.\n\nThose who guard the root govern as if divine. Those who guard the center are slightly disordered and troubled. Those who guard the tip are benighted. Thus the worthy guard the root and caution against the center, never daring to follow the tip.\n\nIf one can guard it without ceasing, goodness will come from all directions—do not resist or oppose it. Compile it as a treasured vessel, and it will never need replacement for ten thousand generations.\n\nCan human effort alone achieve goodness? Can perverse and deviant barbarians be repelled? Can weapons and armor be abolished? Can staffs and ropes fall silent? Can the four directions be at peace? Can roads be open? Can the lord of men be enlightened?\n\nThe divine strategy: when a great person guards it, the four directions are moved; when a middling scholar practices it, their commands and ministers are good; when a petty person practices it, they do not harm one another. Its words are concise, its laws clear—how can the divine writings of divination not be practiced?\n\nIf one cannot uphold it, take care not to harm or restrain perversity—this is the method of self-protection against inauspiciousness. Follow the four seasons and five phases, inwardly and outwardly rectify the body, disperse perversity and repel inauspiciousness. Contemplate and guard the suspended images, act in accord with the qi of the four seasons, harmonize yin and yang, and weave the net of governance to control ghosts and spirits, preventing them from recklessly harming people.\n\nAfter the Beginning of Winter until the Beginning of Spring, vigorously employ the qi of Great Yin, while subtly employing the qi of Lesser Yang. Constantly observe its intent: what illnesses are caused by human agency? Its spirit-officials wear black garments. Contemplate it in seclusion for forty-five days, up to ninety days, and it will make one’s ears and eyes keen.\n\nAt the Beginning of Spring, the flourishing virtue resides in benevolence; the qi governs Lesser Yang. The royal qi turns to the east, activating the Wood phase. Its qi is weak yet benevolent. Its spirit-officials wear green garments. Contemplate it in secluded tranquility for forty-five days, up to ninety days, and it will cause illnesses to abate. If one continues to practice this without ceasing, it will make one daily practice benevolence and love.\n\nBefore the Spring Equinox, vigorously employ the qi of Lesser Yang, while subtly employing the qi of Great Yang to assist Lesser Yang. Observe its intent without doubt, deeply contemplate its meaning, and the hundred perversities will submit.\n\nOn the day of the Beginning of Summer, the flourishing virtue is Fire. The royal qi turns to the south. The qi of Great Yang governs with centered harmony. If one employs its spirit-officials and grasps its intent, sweetness arises in the mouth. Its spirit-officials wear red garments and guard it, causing the hundred ghosts to flee a thousand miles away.\n\nOn the day of the Summer Solstice, the flourishing virtue is the qi of Great Yang, the qi of centered harmony. Its spirit-officials contemplate it to cure the hundred illnesses.\n\nIn the sixth month of late summer, the flourishing virtue governs in harmonious union. The royal qi turns to the southwest, returning to the central palace. Its spirit-officials wear yellow garments; contemplating it causes sweetness to arise in the mouth. Each season’s late period, contemplate it for eighteen days.\n\nOn the day of the Beginning of Autumn, the flourishing virtue resides in Metal. The royal qi turns to the west, severing and completing the myriad things. Its spirit-officials wear white garments; contemplating it for forty-five days, extending to ninety days, can dispel illness. Grasping its intent strengthens the bones and grants longevity in old age.\n\nOn the day of the Autumn Equinox, the qi of Lesser Yin prevails, subtly employing the qi of Great Yin. If illness arises in opposition, follow its sequence.\n\nOn the day of the Beginning of Winter, the flourishing virtue resides in Water. The royal qi turns to the north. Its spirit-officials wear black garments. It sharpens the will and sharpens the ears; guarding it for forty-five to ninety days dispels the hundred illnesses.\n\nThese are the qi of the Five Phases and the four seasons. Internally, they can govern the body; externally, they can govern perversities. Thus, Heaven employs them to purify, and Earth employs them to pacify. Heaven employs them to generate, and Earth employs them to store. Humankind employs them to flourish. Those who accord with the seasonal qi are called loyal ministers and filial children.\n\nThis is called the Great Accordance with the Dao of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, the four seasons, and the Five Phases. Thus, the Dao emerges for the benevolent and worthy; it does not arise for the foolish.\n\n**Method for Flourishing the Body and Repelling Disaster:**\nAt ten years of age, the spirit endures for twenty years.\nAt twenty, the spirit endures for forty years.\nAt thirty, the spirit endures for sixty years.\nAt forty, the spirit endures for eighty years.\nAt fifty, the spirit endures for a hundred years.\nAt sixty, the spirit endures for a hundred and twenty years.\nAt seventy, the spirit endures for a hundred and forty years.\nFrom eighty to a hundred and twenty, the spirit is exhausted.\n\nIn youth, the spirit grows; in old age, the spirit wanes. This refers to the spirits of the five viscera, the internal signs. One thousand two hundred and twenty good spirits serve as its envoys, advancing and retreating to oversee and attend. The ten thousand spirits are its people, all following the rise and decline of the person.\n\nThis is the constant principle of Heaven and Earth. If one treats the spirit as a city and skillfully governs it, calming the body and preserving the spirit, then illness will not afflict, and years and longevity will be long. The numinous will protect it.\n\nThus, Heaven and Earth establish the body with tranquility, guard it with the spirit, and flourish it with the Dao. Therefore, if one can be pure and still, embrace the spirit, and not lose clarity in thought, then inauspicious perversities cannot enter.\n\nThe true spirit resides within, causing one to be constantly joyful, content, and without desire for wealth, litigation, or competition for fame and merit. Over time, one can naturally perceive the spirit. The spirit is two feet and five inches in length, and its attire follows the Five Phases and the five viscera.\n\nWhen the ruler is benevolent, the Dao flourishes; when the ruler is yielding, virtue arises. If the heart harbors even a slight perverse intent, distant regions will be thrown into chaos. The spirit-qi circulates swiftly, faster than thunder and lightning. Swiftly return to the numinous luminosity to illuminate the interior, and illness will naturally heal, and the person will naturally govern themselves.\n\nThus, the upper limit of human longevity is a hundred and twenty years, the middle is eighty, and the lower is sixty. Beyond this is premature death. This is because the spirit wanders outside while illness attacks within.\n\nContemplating the fundamental and rectifying conduct causes people to cherish one another. The ancients who sought longevity did not lose the Dao.\n\nHeaven and Earth have constant movements; one cannot depart from the root. Therefore, those who seek peace and long existence must carefully not forget this fundamental origin of the Dao.\n\nThus, illustrations are drawn to instruct later generations. They depict the time when people receive life and destiny, from distant antiquity to the present, without losing the transmission of yin and yang, mutually generating and enduring for myriad generations, never ceasing.\n\nIn decline and flourishing, high and low are balanced. In flourishing, one becomes a ruler; in decline, one becomes a commoner. In flourishing, one attains the Dao; in decline, one receives punishment.\n\nOf filial piety, nothing is greater than preserving the form, for it is the lineage of one’s ancestors, spreading one’s name to later generations. This is called the good person who carefully guides the people. Heaven and Earth love them, the Five Phases bestow merit upon them, the four seasons benefit them, the hundred kings employ them, the myriad people cherish them, ghosts and spirits protect them, and the spirits of the five viscera abide within them.\n\nMeeting once, one gains life; now, one nearly loses it. Departing from my spirit-vessel, one returns to ashes and dust, transforming without constancy, becoming the myriad things again.\n\nDistinguishing forms and appearances, perversities naturally dissipate. Purify the body and practice the method.\n\nThe Dao’s generation of people is fundamentally all essence-qi, and all possess spirit. The temporary appearance is called a person. Foolish people do not know how to return and preserve their spirit-qi, thus losing the Dao. Those who can return and restore their spirit-qi will complete their Heaven-appointed years, or even double them—these are all persons of high talent.\n\nFor those seeking to transcend calamity, the method is as follows: Establish a fasting chamber, secure its doors and windows, and prevent others from entering carelessly. Go daily to test yourself; if not refined, do not force it but leave and return. Proceeding thus repeatedly, gradually refining and becoming familiar, one will find peace. Once at peace, one will no longer wish to leave, nor speak, nor see food and drink, nor hear human voices.\n\nAccumulate goodness through concentrated refinement. Close the eyes and inwardly observe the form and appearance, as if residing in a mirror or gazing at a reflection in clear water—this is called minor accomplishment. Without whips or rods, there is strictness; without weapons or staffs, there is awe. All affairs govern themselves—how can this not be numinous?\n\nThis is called the path to entering the spirit. Guarding three is not as good as guarding two; guarding two is not as good as guarding one. Deeply contemplating these words, one attains the Dao and explores its mysteries.\n\n**Method for Communicating with the Spirit and Transcending Worldly Calamity:**\nHeaven’s generation of people is complete in all affairs. Thus, they are born in ten months, beginning and ending with things. Therefore, one can transcend disaster and calamity and attain Great Peace.\n\nThe superior person studies the Dao to assist the emperor and king, accumulating merit for long endurance. The middling person studies the Dao to transcend their family; the inferior person studies the Dao merely to free their body.\n\nThe Dao emerges for the worthy and enlightened; it does not arise for the foolish. Those who can employ it will be auspicious; those who cannot employ it—would it not be better to avoid harm and injury?\n\nThe worthy and unworthy know the method for themselves.\n\nThe superior person, highly worthy, regards all matters, great and small, with reverence. The middling person reveres half of them, while the inferior person has nothing to revere.\n\nThe superior person’s reverence arises from turning inward, not from seeking others. With an open heart and penetrating insight, free from obstruction, they know the root of the primordial qi in its natural state. They honor Heaven and esteem Earth, recognizing that the sun, moon, and arrayed stars; the Five Phases and Four Seasons; the Six Jia spirits and yin-yang; and all creatures that crawl, walk, or sway—none are born in vain. Spirits, demons, and spectral beings within the Six Directions; the inner and outer workings of wind, clouds, thunder, and lightning—none act without purpose. All possess their own spirits and rulers, much as humans have their signs, and thus they are revered without reckless action.\n\nThe middling person, who reveres only half, does not grasp the arts of primordial qi in its natural state. They merely recognize the wind, rain, clouds, and living things before their eyes, yet still claim Heaven has no spirits and show no awe for the arrayed stars, the sun, or the moon—knowing only the Great Fire and the Northern Dipper. The inferior person, however, does not comprehend the vastness of lands, mountains, and rivers; they know only how to till fields, plant what they possess, and manage their household and kin. They do not understand how the Four Seasons and Five Phases govern their steps, but merely follow the seasons to plant and harvest for profit. They deny the existence of the Six Jia spirits and yin-yang, dismissing them entirely.\n\nThrough foolishness, one may study and become worthy; through worthiness, one may study without cease and become a sage; through sageliness, one may study without cease and attain the Dao; through the Dao, one may study without cease and become an immortal; through immortality, one may study without cease and become a perfected being; through perfection, one may study without cease and become a spirit. All arise from unceasing accumulation of study.\n\nOne method is called \"Extending Life and Subduing the Barbarians.\" Though the myriad kinds differ, all may attain long life. Heaven and Earth cherish them, and their bodies remain free from fault. The reason is this: it is called the Way of Great Compliance. When the Dao is achieved, one’s entire life shares the same domain as Heaven and Earth. Those who practiced it in ancient times found the myriad spirits naturally at ease. To know its efficacy, observe how auspicious signs arrive of themselves and misfortunes subside. When emperors and kings govern by it, they need not exert force—knowing and practicing this, the barbarians submit of themselves. Practicing it without cease, one becomes a perfected person.\n\nThus, the teachings of the sages do not require coercion or struggle to succeed; they establish instruction based on natural disposition. The reason emperors and kings can pacify the world is that they pacify it according to the hearts of all under Heaven, thereby winning the hearts of the world.\n\nThis is the ancient scripture of the Dao.\n\nWhen humans are first born, they are called spirits. They share authority with Heaven and Earth, dividing body and form, spirit and essence, qi and affairs, duties and dwellings. Thus, they occupy three realms: one qi becomes Heaven, one qi becomes Earth, and one qi becomes humanity. The remaining qi scatters to complete the myriad things. Therefore, Heaven is honored, Earth esteemed, and humanity valued.\n\nThus, the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors all established teachers, and those with doubts knelt to inquire. Therefore, the state remained orderly, and even disasters could be healed.\n\nThe method for rulers to be free from worry: the path of Great Compliance enables rulers to be without care or trouble, bringing about Great Peace. When Heaven and Earth do not shake violently, when wind and rain do not rage, when the hundred spirits rest in their abodes, the world is free from disaster. When the myriad things each dwell in their proper place, they rejoice without sorrow. How is this achieved? Through benevolence, the emperor and king remain joyful; through the Dao, they are free from suffering. If the emperor and king suffer, the world cannot be at peace.\n\nThe emperor and king are the heart of the world; the ministers are its limbs; the common people are its hands and feet. When the heart is troubled, the limbs act recklessly, the hands and feet move without rest, and the people drift and scatter. This is their natural interaction, and Heaven acts likewise. When Heaven loses the Dao, clouds and qi become chaotic; when Earth loses the Dao, it cannot contain things. The ruler communicates with Heaven. When a child delights in their father, when a minister delights in their lord, when Earth delights in Heaven, and when Heaven delights in the Dao, then the qi of Great Peace may be attained.\n\nWhen Heaven’s qi is once governed, the Supreme August Emperor descends in peace. When Heaven and Earth harmonize, the emperor and king practice my Dao—what fault could there be? The Dao is the heart of Heaven, the head of Heaven. Once the heart and head act, how can the limbs not follow? Thus, deviant spirits naturally dissipate.\n\nDistinguish the strengths of the three qi and return the spirit to guard the body. The qi of Great Yang is Heaven, hence called *shen*. The form is governed by Great Yin, which envelops and nurtures the myriad things, so the spirit and essence are stored in the abdomen—thus, the Earth spirit is called *qi*. Essence is the harmonious essence within the myriad things, advancing and retreating without constancy. The essence of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang together generate the myriad things—this is the reckoning of the Three Systems. Spirit governs life, essence governs nurturing, and form governs completion. These three together constitute the vessel of spirit, modeled after ruler, minister, and people—thus, none can be without the others.\n\nWhen the heart’s spirit stirs, it unsettles the form. If one preserves it without ceasing, it remains where it finds peace; if one does not employ what brings peace, it departs. Begin by teaching what brings peace, and over time, it will naturally settle and not leave.\n\nYin qi and yang qi alternately grind and sharpen each other, thereby generating one another. Human qi likewise circulates through the body, and spirit and essence ride it in their comings and goings. Spirit and essence depend on qi as fish depend on water. When qi is cut off, spirit and essence scatter; when water is cut off, the fish perish. Thus, the Way of nurturing life lies in calming the body and cultivating qi, avoiding frequent anger and joy.\n\nThe enlightened teachers of old taught emperors and kings to calm their bodies, freeing them from worry, so that the rulers could focus inwardly. When Heaven delights, the qi of Great Peace emerges, and nothing fails to be born and completed. When Heaven is angered, the qi of punishment emerges, and nothing escapes harm—all suffer its poison, hence the shared sorrow.\n\nWhen Heaven does not guard its spirit, the Three Luminaries dim. When Earth does not guard its spirit, mountains and rivers collapse. When humans do not guard their spirit, the body dies. When the myriad things do not guard their spirits, they are damaged. Therefore, one must return to it—this is called strength. Failing to return and guard it is called dissipation.\n\nThe harmony of yin and yang: from Heaven comes Earth, from the sun comes the moon, from yin comes yang, from spring comes autumn, from summer comes winter, from day comes night, from left comes right, from outer comes inner, from white comes black, from brightness comes darkness, from hardness comes softness, from male comes female, from front comes back, from above comes below, from ruler comes minister, from *jia* comes *yi*, from *zi* comes *chou*, from five comes six, from wood comes grass, from female comes male, from rooster comes hen, from mountain comes hill—these are the root and handle of the Dao.\n\nThe pivot and mechanism of yin and yang are the profound intent of the numinous. They constitute the method for human longevity, governance, and great peace. The three qi unite as one—this is the root of spirit. One is essence, one is spirit, and one is qi; these three share a single position, fundamentally the qi of Heaven, Earth, and humanity. Spirit is received from Heaven, essence from Earth, and qi from harmony between them, together forming the singular Dao. Thus, spirit rides qi to move, essence resides within it, and the three assist one another in governance. Therefore, those who desire longevity must cherish qi, revere spirit, and value essence. Those who wish to rectify great matters should do so through non-action. For non-action begets non-action—this is the eternal law of Heaven and Earth, the art of spontaneity. Like echo follows sound, shadow follows form: the superior person employs it to pacify the state, the middling person to prolong life, and the inferior person to govern the household. This may be called \"achieving without acting\" and \"ordering without governing.\" The great Dao is smooth and broad, not far from the self; by inwardly cherishing one’s body, governance naturally reverts to its source.\n\nThe method for resolving the seven affairs and dispelling delusion:\nTo govern the body with virtue—how much more so to govern the myriad people? To attain the qi of great harmony—how can one be good yet fail to reach it, how can one be at peace? To govern the body with benevolence and righteousness—how much more so to govern the myriad people? How can one be good yet fail to reach it, how can one be at peace? To govern the body with ritual—how much more so to govern the myriad people? How can one be good yet fail to reach it, how can one be at peace? To govern the body with culture—how much more so to govern the myriad people? To be good yet restrain them, preventing wrongdoing—how can one be good yet fail to reach it, how can one be at peace? To govern the body—how much more so to govern the myriad people? How can one be good yet fail to reach it, how can one be at peace? To govern the body by abolishing weapons and warfare—how much more so to govern the myriad people? How can one be good yet fail to reach it, how can one be at peace?\n\nYet these seven affairs cannot be entirely absent, nor can they be purely practiced. The divine persons of antiquity governed their bodies with fundamentals, and only then did they possess great arts for governing the people. They enabled the myriad things to live, each attaining its proper place, making the six directions and eight quarters—near and far—rejoice, ensuring nothing lost its place. Only then could spontaneity prevail, pacifying the eight directions and four reaches, bestowing grace without losing even a hair. If one cannot nurture the root and branches today, how can governance be achieved?\n\nNow, this highest virtue—benevolence, righteousness, ritual, culture, law, and martial arts—these seven affairs differ, and though governance may be good, it may not reach fulfillment. Each has its strengths, yet none can be abandoned, nor can any be purely practiced. To govern the body, pacify the state, and bring about great peace, one must deeply grasp their secrets; to master them is the Dao. Unite them in guarding the One, and though divided, they are without limit. The Supreme Lord enacts this—profound beyond measure, named the model of penetrating illumination.\n\nThe method for teaching the four seas to discern superiority and inferiority:\nHeaven generates humanity in three ranks: the first is Heaven-born, the second Earth-born, and the third of human kind. Those who receive their mandate from Heaven become rulers; those who receive it from Earth become ministers; those who receive it from humanity become the people. The ruler acts in accordance with Heaven, the minister in accordance with Earth, following and serving their superiors. The people belong to the ministers, serving in turn. Only when these three qi govern as one can success be achieved. Thus, when the superior is at peace, his ministers are good. When ministers fulfill their duties, the people follow the constant way. When both people and ministers are good, the ruler is enlightened, and governance endures.\n\nGreat peace is achieved through the Dao in practice. When the three qi are all good and unite in accord, embracing virtue and power without harming one another, the great person governs the Dao to pacify the world, rescuing the four frontiers, extending grace to the barbarians, preventing calamity from arising. Goodness daily manifests, and misfortune cannot come. The middling person studies the Dao to become a state minister, aiding in governance, measuring his household, and averting disaster. The lesser practitioner of the Dao harms his parents, wanders far away, his virtue slight and power meager, merely preserving his body—how can he assist an enlightened king or aid the state? Those who can pacify the four seas receive Heaven’s aid. Ministers assist in governance, consulting with Earth. Those who seek only self-preservation find the Dao narrow and small, unable to achieve governance. These three types of people all transcend the world and attain longevity, though their greatness differs.\n\nThis is the method of spirit’s departure and abiding, the efficacy of the Dao:\nThe divine person says: \"Illuminating conduct and the efficacy of the Dao—whose mandate do they reflect?\" They make people clearly awaken, knowing the source of their mandate and discerning who upholds its rectitude. Humanity follows the pattern of yin and yang in life: yang is always upright, yin always deviant; yang always exists, yin always vanishes; yang always grows, yin always diminishes; yang always generates, yin always destroys. People transform thrice daily, reflecting the three qi. Their governance differs, their distinctions contend, discordant and unaligned. Yet through habituation, one maintains constancy, and preserving the human form brings fortune. Only those with the true Dao can focus their essence and stand apart. The unlearned do not know the efficacy of spirit’s departure and abiding; what is manifest cannot be concealed.\n\nThus, the noble person controls the corpse but not the ghost. When one is not asleep—walking, sitting, speaking—the distinction between right and wrong is clear, conduct upright, words and deeds serving as standards. This is when the human spirit is present. When one closes their eyes to sleep, light and shadow withdraw inward, thoughts arise but are unspoken—spirit remains within. When sleep deepens, spirit departs to wander, the body unable to move, the mouth unable to speak, the ears unable to hear, merging with myriad spirits. Only qi remains—clear proof. Therefore, spirit must be constantly guarded; guarding it brings longevity, losing it exhausts one’s mandate. Those who attain the Dao do so through focused intention, and those who lose it do so through the same.\n\nTo rescue the deluded and transform the laws of emperors and kings.\n\nThe Great Dao’s transformations are boundless—spanning ten thousand leagues in mutual regard, limitless above and below, circulating through the six directions. To abide by it brings fortune; to neglect it brings harm. The opening and closing of yin and yang are its constant principle.\n\nIt is bestowed upon those of the Dao, enabling the virtuous to practice it, so their lifespan matches heaven and earth. Virtue has degrees of excellence, matters have roots and branches, and all things follow the Dao. Those on the rise encounter goodness; those in decline encounter misfortune.\n\nFor example, land: fertile soil yields goodness, while barren soil yields adversity. The noble align with heaven; the base are mired in marshes. The settled are masters; the wandering are transient guests—all is encompassed by the Dao.\n\nThe virtuous cultivate fortune through their conduct; the wicked cultivate disaster. The virtuous gain it as blessing and power. The exalted ride in carriages by its grace; the lowly walk by its support. The sagely and wise attain liberation through it; the petty, though they gain it, do not harm one another—all is the Dao.\n\nTeachings do not appear twice; time does not return. Hasten to instruct emperors and kings, that they may practice the Way of Great Peace. When the Dao is practiced, the self attains liberation, and merit extends to all living beings in the six directions.\n\n*Excerpts from the Gui Section, Scroll Ten of the* Abridged Scripture of Great Peace *concludes.*\n\n*(Note: According to textual research, this scroll should be an abridged version of Scroll Seventeen of the Jia Section of the* Scripture of Great Peace. *The* Orthodox Daoist Canon *contains errors.)*",

Were I to remain silent, I fear Heaven would grow despondent, and chaos would never be pacified at the proper time. Sit in peace, and I shall recount it to you. You will then understand clearly, without doubt.\"*\n\n*\"The heavens and earth of antiquity and those of today share the same beginning and end, no different in essence. At first, all was good; later, evil arose. Between them, rise and decline alternate—one success, one failure. The Yang’s nine and the six complete a cycle, and when the six nines are fulfilled, great dissolution follows. Heaven and earth dissolve into chaos, and all beings perish. Only those who accumulate goodness escape, becoming the* **Seed People** *forever.\"*\n\n*\"Though the Seed People possess wisdom and understanding, their capacities still vary, not yet perfectly unified. Thus, they require a* **Teacher-Lord** *(*Junshi*). When the lord is sagely and the teacher enlightened, their teachings ensure immortality. Through cultivation, they attain sagehood—hence the name* **Seed People***. The Seed People are sages and worthies, the kind who attain* **long life**.*\"*\n\n*\"The supreme lord of long life is titled* **The Supreme True and Upright Primordial Wondrous Qi, the August Emperor of the Golden Watchtower of the Upper Clarity, the Later Sage Ninefold Mystery Thearch** *(*Jiuxuan Dijun*). His surname is* **Li***, a scion of the Most High Supreme One and an heir of the Jade Emperor’s Void and Nothingness. His qi first manifested in the* **Taihuang** *era, the fifteenth year of the* **Taihuang Emperor** *(*Taihuang Shijun*), in the* **bingzi** *year. His form took shape in the first year of* **Huangping** *(*Huangping Yuannian*), the* **jiashen** *year. On the third day of the ninth month in the seventh year of* **Shanghe** *(*Shanghe Qinian*), the* **gengyin** *year—a* **jiazi** *day at dawn, when the forces of punishment and virtue aligned—he was born in the* **Li Valley** *between the* **Tian’gang Sacred Realm** *and* **Renwu Pavilion** *on* **Penglai Mountain** *in the* **Northern Mystery Jade Kingdom***. His mother, the* **Mysterious Void Mother of the Supreme Mystery** *(*Shangxuan Xusheng Zhi Mu*), dwelt in the* **Ninefold Mystery Chamber** *within the* **Yin Valley of the Mysterious Void**.*\"*\n\n*\"At the onset of her pregnancy, she dreamed of dark clouds, the sun, and moon entwining her form, while the six qi’s lightning stirred her spirit. Through a profound union with the Yang Dao, she conceived the* **Perfected One** *(*Zhenren*). On the morning of his birth, three suns rose in the east. After his delivery, nine dragons spat divine water. Thus, his clan took its name from the* **Spiritual Valley** *(*Linggu*), and his given name from the radiance of the luminaries.\"*\n\n*\"At three years of age, his body embodied the Dao and congealed the true. His words blossomed like golden flowers. At five, he often gazed at the sun, rejoicing in its dawn, and faced the moon, sighing at its waning. Above, he observed the Yang qi’s brilliance; below, he witnessed the Yin Dao’s decay. Thereupon, he gathered his hun and harmonized his po, guarded the womb’s treasured spirit, recorded his essence, replenished his blood, and fortified his fluids to solidify his sinews.\"*\n\n*\"At seven, he learned to swallow light and ingest mist, chewing the sun’s roots. By fourteen, he possessed a golden countenance and jade complexion. He abandoned worldly attachments and transcended emotions, embracing transformation to save the world. His purity moved the* **Primordial Simplicity** *(*Taisu*), and he received the teachings of the* **Three Origins** *(*Sanyuan*). He studied the* **Three Caverns** *(*Sandong*) and mastered the* **Nine Methods** *(*Jiufang*).\"*\n\n*\"At twenty-one, he dwelled in solitude, tempering his sharpness. At twenty-eight, he harmonized with the world while preserving his light. At thirty-five, he disseminated the* **Mysterious Ford** *(*Xuanjin*), and his merit and virtue spread far. At forty-two, he received the scriptures and was named* **Later Sage Thearch** *(*Housheng Dijun*). He was no different from those who had attained the Dao and become Thearchs in former heavens. His investiture was recorded for the present age—hence the title* **Later Sage***. The Dao of the Former Sage and the Later Sage is one and the same.\"*\n\n*\"He ascended to the halls of* **Upper Clarity** *(*Shangqing*), wandered the palaces of* **Great Ultimate** *(*Taiji*), and governed the ten directions of heaven. He was enfeoffed to oversee the billions upon billions of beings, inspecting the celestial rivers, seas, earth’s sources, and mountain forests. None failed to look up in obedience. He presided over the nine layers and ten tiers of heaven—hence the title* **Ninefold Mystery** *(*Jiuxuan*).\"*\n\n*\"At seventy, he determined the limitless span of his life, adapting to the proper times for concealment and manifestation. He edited the arts of* **not dying** *and compiled the methods of* **long life***. The treasured scriptures, talismans, and diagrams, along with the wondrous techniques of the Three Antiquities, were sealed in jade caskets, attended by divine officials. Their transmission followed strict protocols, their concealment and revelation governed by signs. He established canons and set forth teachings for the* **Seed People***. Those who cannot practice these are not* **Seed People**.*\"*\n\n*\"Now, as heaven and earth unfold, the era of pure wind recedes. The* **Huangping** *qi has withdrawn, and calamities surge unchecked. Since the age of the* **Upper Thearch** *(*Shanghuang*), and through the reigns of the Three and Five Sovereigns, wars, epidemics, floods, and fires have arisen in relentless succession. All stem from the billions of beings whose hearts are crooked and forms deceptive, who destroy the* **Five Virtues** *(*Wude*), contend through the* **Six Emotions** *(*Liuqing*), indulge in violence, and vie in aggression. They encroach upon one another, disregarding elders and juniors, confounding noble and base. Thus, the Two Modes lose order, the Seven Luminaries deviate from their paths, the Three Powers transform anomalously, omens and portents proliferate, spirits and ghosts clash, beings perish, and disasters strike repeatedly. Yet they remain blind and unrepentant, letting myriad evils run rampant beyond count.\"*\n\n*\"There are four great evils: war, disease, flood, and fire. When the Yang’s nine completes a cycle, and the solitary Yin flourishes, waters overflow. When the hundred sixes complete a circuit, and the Yang prevails, fires erupt. Before the time of Yao, there is no need to recount further. From the Tang onward, I shall briefly outline what is to come. You should heed and remember this, and urgently prepare to avoid calamity.\"*\n\n*\"After Yao’s flood, Tang suffered fire. Since then, minor floods and fires have occurred across the land, summoned by grave sins—not the great* **Yang Nine** *or* **Hundred Six** *cycles. Within the great Nine and Six, there must be major and minor* **jiashen** *years. The* **jiashen** *is the appointed time when ghosts confront humanity. Disasters vary in severity, and blessings and misfortunes differ in depth. As regions and years change, so do their shifts. For those of middling capacity, the appointed time arrives as foretold.

      "translated_text": "Those who do evil hasten their doom, while those who do good prolong their years. Without diligent progress, one cannot attain the Dao, and may only extend their allotted time according to the measure of their merit. Thus, the **Hundred Six** and **Yang Nine** cycles may arrive early or late, their great calendric constants adjusted in depth and degree.\n\nCounting from the *dinghai* year of the Tang era, forty-six years later, the *jiashen* year between them was a minor *jiashen*, bringing warfare, plague, and fire—disasters alternating, though not yet the great flood. Minor floods spread widely, their severity varying by year and region. Fifty-five years after another *dinghai*, the *jiashen* year between them was a major *jiashen*, when all three calamities struck together, followed by a great flood that swept all away.\n\nWhenever a major or minor *jiashen* arrives, the wicked are eradicated, and the good are spared. The good become the **Seed People**, while the wicked become the **Chaotic Dregs**. Before the appointed time is over, myriad portents arise in profusion: pestilential toxins surge above, warfare and fire rage below, and floods burst forth from no fixed direction, drowning the wicked in turn. During this fifteen-year span—extending to thirty years—annual disasters grow severe, the worthy and sagely go into hiding, and the great Dao’s divine beings dispatch perfected immortals and superior adepts to traverse the land, teaching with patient guidance. They exhort the high and urge on the low: those who follow become the Seed People, while those who resist are drowned, becoming the Chaotic Dregs, their wickedness utterly purged. Of the Seed People, the most virtuous—barely one in ten—remain, while of the middling and lesser good, half are destroyed, and the surviving half flourish and grow day by day. Only then do sagely rulers, enlightened masters, and great ministers descend and appear.\n\nAfter the minor *jiashen* and before the *renshen* year, if the ruler of the minor *jiashen* is sagely and wise, stern yet benevolent, harming neither principle nor order, he may extend his years and attain long life. Through devoted study, he may even achieve immortality, though without deep mastery of the **Scriptures of Great Peace** or prolonged practice of its teachings, the era of Great Peace will be brief, and his name cannot be fixed. Those who practice it have their names inscribed in the Azure Register by the **Controller of Destiny**; those who do not are recorded in the Black Script. The Black Script means death; the Azure Register means life. The ledgers of life and death reside in the **Hall of Light** in Heaven. The Dao of Heaven is impartial, favoring only the good. Those who cultivate and fulfill the Great Peace become the Great Peace. Those who achieve the Lesser Great Peace align their virtue with the Lord of Great Peace. The Lord of Great Peace whose name is fixed is Lord Li. In the *renchen* year, on the sixth day of the third month, he will manifestly appear in the world, riding the **Three Pure Radiance Chariot**, followed by ten thousand flying carriages and dragons. He will elevate the good as Seed People and scholars as immortal officials, establishing disciplines and statutes to reward virtue, suppress evil, curb the roots of sin, and supervise those who advance in blessed deeds. Those who persevere without slackening will achieve perfection as divine transcendents, aligning their virtue with the Emperor. Those who slacken and fall into evil will have their wickedness daily recorded, destined to become the later Chaotic Dregs.\n\nThe lofty and wise, with keen insight and unwavering clarity, must diligently progress, inwardly cultivate the Emperor’s teachings, and remember the great divine lord’s assistants without fail. The sagely ruler, enlightened ministers, and numinous officials will aid people in attaining deathlessness, becoming Seed People forever, ascending as immortal transcendents, and ultimately attaining the rank of the **Later Sage**. The Later Sage, Lord Li’s Grand Preceptor, is surnamed Peng. He studied the Dao before Lord Li and holds the position of **Left Perfected of the Grand Tenuity**. During the era of the **Human Sovereign**, he was commanded by the **Lord of the Dao of the Sovereign** to protect and invest the people, serving as Lord Li’s Grand Preceptor, governing from the **Northern Pond Palace of the Grand Tenuity** at the **Luminous Upper Terrace**. Every two thousand five hundred years, he changes his name, traversing the Great Void, circling the Eight Darknesses, ascending to the Utmost Above, and descending to the Utmost Below. Rare are the true officials who have glimpsed his radiant countenance.\n\nThe **Lord of the Azure Lads of the Fangzhu Palace** is the Later Sage Lord Li’s **Grand Minister**.\nThe **Southern Culmen Lord of the Great Cinnabar Palace** is the Later Sage Lord Li’s **Grand Guardian**.\nThe **Lord of the Great Simplicity of the White Mountain Palace** is the Later Sage Lord Li’s **Grand Tutor**.\nThe **Governor of All Perfected of the Western City Palace** is the Later Sage Lord Li’s **Grand Steward**.\n\nThese five—one master and four assistants—are collectively called the **Assistants**. The term *assistant* signifies a father and a support: revered like a father, they ensure the master’s teachings are carried out. Together, they are called assistants; separately, they are the **Left Assistant**, **Right Assistant**, **Front Deliberator**, and **Rear Attendant**. The *attendant* voices opinions, initiates actions, fills omissions, and completes tasks, making decisions and proclaiming them—this is the steward. The *deliberator* ponders unresolved matters, illuminating and clarifying them—this is the tutor. The *assistant* (right) ensures certainty and prevents errors—this is the guardian. The *assistant* (left) aids the ruler and follows the master, guiding all into the Dao—this is the minister. The four and five assess omens, thoroughly weighing approval and disapproval, promoting and expanding the true transformation—together, they are called the **Assisting Masters**.\n\nIn times of leisure, when facing forward, one may consult the **Deliberating Tutor** for unresolved questions; when looking back, the **Attending Steward** for overlooked concerns; to the right, the **Guarding Assistant** for unclear matters; and to the left, the **Assisting Minister** for what remains obscure. By consulting the four assistants—guardian, tutor, steward, and minister—success lies with the master; none can be lacking. The sagely emperor set this model for later generations to follow.\n\nInwardly, there is the **Guardian**, who manages affairs—this pertains to the right, the treasure of quiescent perfection. Outwardly, there is the **Master**, who manages affairs—this pertains to the left, where movement returns to stillness. This is most difficult, hence the focus on the assistants and master. When looking forward, there is the **Tutor**, who expounds and discusses the Dao’s essence. When looking back, there is the **Steward**, who decides right and wrong. The remaining public ministers, officials, immortal transcendents, and sage ranks—three hundred sixty-one in number—command thirty-six thousand, who in turn lead three hundred sixty thousand. The people number ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, and myriadfold. Twenty-four perfected beings are constantly sent to secretly instruct those with sincere hearts, all subordinate to the **Grand Minister of Fangzhu**. This cannot be fully described; one must carefully contemplate the great and independently investigate the small.\n\nExcellent! Today’s questions have resolved my doubts, and I have heard your instructions anew.\n\nIt is asked: What practices did Lord Li consistently follow to attain such lofty transcendence? May we hear of the Grand Preceptor’s and the four assistants’ studies?",

You ask on behalf of those who are foolish, who wander lost and do not believe in the Dao, whose learning lacks firmness, whose progress and retreat lack constancy, and who thus fall into lowly and bitter states—hence your earnest inquiry. Now I shall explain it to you.\n\nFrom the beginningless past until now, accumulated deeds have endured for ages; a single good or evil act cannot be fully recounted, and speaking of them brings no benefit. Here, I shall take only the recent practices by which one attains lofty nobility: the **Numinous Writ of Purple Texts** is the essential.\n\nThe **Great Lord of the Azure Lad**, Preceptor of the Lofty Dawn in the Jade Treasury of the Eastern Flower, purified himself in the Yellow Chamber of the Cold Numen Elixir Hall for three years before ascending to the **Golden Portals of the Supreme Clarity**.

Fifty thousand handmaidens—transcendent maidens and perfected beings—stand in attendance. Poisonous dragons and lightning tigers, celestial apes of the highest heavens, array themselves in venomous postures, guarding the gates and holding the passes. Giant toads a thousand fathoms long patrol the ramparts, while flying dragons and darting sparrows, leviathan roc and wondrous birds, clack their beaks and brandish their claws, filling the vast courtyard. The celestial majesty blazes resplendent, its radiance streaming in eight directions. Dark banners flutter in the wind, dancing pennants and canopies swirl. Jade trees chime with resonant tones, their gemmed branches murmuring of their own accord. Divine songs are sung in unison, phoenixes cry in profound harmony, spirit consorts join in chorus, unicorns dance and simurghs glide. The celestial harmony rings in eightfold resonance, uniting the nine harmonies and hundredfold gatherings.\n\nThe Azure Lad prostrated himself forward and received the **Numinous Writ of Purple Texts**, each oral transmission and secret formula contained within the scriptures numbering twenty-four.

      "translated_text": "**Harmonizing Yin and Yang in Accordance with the Dao’s Law**\n\nTo restore youth and prevent aging—when the Great Dao returns, all people’s years shall be tested and verified. Close your eyes and look inward: a pure, radiant white appears. If at dawn you lie calmly upon your mat, or dwell within warmth and steam, at this time let neither sinew nor bone stir, nor your mouth speak. Every stretch and bend brings ease; the heart rejoices, suffused with a sense of blended moisture. The nose breathes freely, and sweetness arises in the mouth—these are the signs.\n\nThus, those who follow Heaven and Earth enjoy enduring governance; those who follow the four seasons see their kingship flourish day by day. The Dao employs no arcane phrases—its use lies in the alternation of one yin and one yang. Those who attain its governance prosper; those who lose it fall into chaos. Those who attain its governance become spirit-like.\n\nMoreover, those who clearly lose its governance render the Dao unworkable. Ponder this meaning deeply, and you will merge with the Dao as one.\n\nTo record the body’s alignment is to let the spirit make one self-aware of the method. Heaven employs the Dao to generate humanity, granting each person one body and one law: sevenfold interwoven yin and yang, half yin and half yang, only thus can they complete one another. Therefore, the upper part models itself on yang, the lower on yin; the left follows yang, the right follows yin. Yang delights in life, yin delights in killing. Yang embodies the Dao, yin embodies punishment. Yang is goodness, and the yang spirit aids it; yin is evil, and the yin spirit aids it. Accumulate goodness without cease, and Dao-fortune will arise, bringing daily auspiciousness.\n\nYang resides in the head, yin in the feet. Thus, the ruler values virtue and power while employing punishment below—this is the model to follow. The petty man inverts this, devaluing virtue and power while elevating punishment—yet he too follows this model. Therefore, humanity is the root and handle of the Dao, the leader of the spirits. One must understand this intent and skillfully nurture oneself to attain longevity. Those who fail to nurture their bodies incur the blame of the spirits; the spirits abandon them, and how can their bodies fare well?\n\nIn doing good, do not dare stray from the guiding cord, nor deceive yourself. In doing good, the spirits know it of themselves; in doing evil, the spirits know it of themselves. These are not other spirits—they are the spirits within your own body. Speech issues from the heart and belly, yet others come to know of it—this is the spirit within the body informing them.\n\nThus, calming the spirit and settling the body is the foundation of governance and the sign of longevity. The affairs of non-action arise from this. First cultivate the self to discern fortune and misfortune. Therefore, the wise and sagely understand: they cultivate the self, not others. They deeply ponder the Dao’s intent and thus achieve Great Peace. The noble person attains it and flourishes; the petty person practices it and collapses. Cultivate the One to repel the perverse.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth first opened, the root was prized—it is the origin of qi. To bring about Great Peace, contemplate the root. Failing to reflect on the root is called great confusion; undertakings will fail, and disasters will converge. This is not humanity’s fault but the loss of the root. Abandoning the root to seek the branches brings incurable misfortune—thus, one must ponder deeply.\n\nThe One is the root of the Dao, the beginning of qi, the point to which life attaches, and the master of the multitude of hearts. To know its reality, recognize that it resides at the center as the root—the dwelling place of life. Therefore, one must deeply understand it and return to benevolence and worthiness to put it into practice.\n\nThe human root lies within; branches and leaves are without. Command the One to return all outward things; urgently govern the inner and pursue the distant by tending to the near. Those who guard the One receive the aid of celestial spirits; those who guard two receive the aid of earthly spirits; those who guard three receive the aid of human ghosts; those who guard four or five receive the protection of things. Thus, guarding the One extends life; guarding two sets a date with misfortune; guarding three brings chaotic governance; guarding four or five invites daily calamity. Deeply ponder this meaning—it is called knowing the Dao.\n\nTherefore, the One of the head is the crown; the One of the seven regulators is the eye; the One of the abdomen is the navel; the One of the vessels is qi; the One of the five viscera is the heart; the One of the four limbs is the palms and soles; the One of the bones is the spine; the One of the flesh is the intestines and stomach. Those who firmly guard it and understand the Dao’s intent—those who attain the Dao make people benevolent; those who lose it make people greedy.\n\nGovern the body with joy, guard the form and follow the thoughts, focus the mind to repel disaster. What is joy in the Dao? Joy harmonizes yin and yang. In all matters, act in silence, enabling people to grasp the Dao’s root. Thus, when primordial qi delights, great prosperity arises; when nature delights, things grow strong; when Heaven delights, the Three Luminaries shine; when Earth delights, it achieves constancy; when the Five Phases delight, they do not harm one another; when the four seasons delight, what they generate flourishes; when the ruler delights, the world knows no illness; when crawling creatures delight, they do not harm one another; when the myriad things delight, they abide in their constancy; when people delight, they do not fret or change their hearts; when ghosts and spirits delight, they benefit the emperor and king.\n\nThus, joy is the essence of Heaven and Earth’s good qi, which summons the numinous. Stillness generates luminosity, and luminosity is how one awaits the spirits. Those who can communicate with the numinous have the Dao as their neighbor and attain long life and enduring existence.\n\nSeeking the Dao is often bitter, for one cannot return to the heart’s intent. Now, by shifting customs and altering trends, directing the heart’s aim—who would dare contend with this? Does not the music of Great Peace emerge from the palace? It firmly purifies the state, secures the body, and enters the Dao. The barbarians retreat, numinous omens appear, celestial portents return, and malevolent spirits depart.\n\nThe human spirit is born within but roams without. If it wanders untimely, it harms the body. If one can recall it and return, self-governance will not fail. How to recall it? Ensure the inner chamber is empty, with no one nearby. Paint an image matching the color of the viscera, corresponding to the qi of the four seasons. Hang it in the window’s light and contemplate it. Above is the image of the viscera; below are the ten directions. When lying down, focus on the nearby hanging image and contemplate without cease. The spirits of the five viscera can report the qi of the twenty-four seasonal nodes; the spirits of the Five Phases will come to the rescue, and all illnesses will be cured.",

      "translated_text": "Men contemplate male images, women contemplate female images, each using a one-chi measure as the standard, shifting with the four seasons. In spring, ten azure lads; in summer, ten crimson lads; in autumn, ten white lads; in winter, ten black lads; and in the four seasons’ transitions, twelve yellow lads. These twenty-five spirit-persons, true persons together, constitute the method of upright Dao and virtue. Yang transforms into yin, yin transforms into yang; when yin and yang unite, the Dao may be practiced.\n\nHeaven requires earth to bring forth life; earth requires heaven to achieve completion. Spring and summer require autumn and winter; day requires night. A ruler requires ministers to establish governance; ministers require a ruler to carry out their duties. Thus, jia requires yi, zi requires chou—all mutually complete the Dao’s governance. To act rightly is to follow heaven’s course, not to conform to human desires, for all such conformity is contrary to the heavenly Dao. Like the Eastern Sea, though lowly, it delights in water, and all rivers flow into it, thereby attaining its Dao. The leviathan emerges from its depths, and the luminous moon-pearl is born there—such is the efficacy of attaining the Dao. When Daoists gather, they must obtain methods for extending years and extraordinary auspicious responses. When the worthy gather, governance is peaceful; when scholars gather, minor disorders are settled; when the five weapons gather, great defeat ensues.\n\nA ruler should uphold the Dao; ministers should uphold virtue. Dao and virtue are like the outer and inner layers of a garment. If heaven were not vast, it could not encompass the myriad things. All things are half good and half evil—all must be endured. The ruler emulates this, as does the empress and the inner palace. These two exemplify the way of compassionate parents. Thus, when parents raise children, they love the good and pity the wicked, thereby harmonizing the household’s Dao.\n\nThe sun resembles the ruler; the moon resembles the great ministers; the stars resemble the hundred officials. When the worthy collectively shine, the myriad things harmoniously arise. Thus, the pure ascend to heaven, the turbid descend to earth, and harmony resides in humanity. This is the method of harmonizing the numinous spirits.\n\nI desire that the myriad spirits of heaven and earth be harmonious and kind, no longer wantonly harming people, that heaven and earth remain joyful, all spirits rejoice, and people suffer no afflictions. When the emperor obtains heaven’s power, his undertakings are blessed—how could this be interrupted? Thus, the sage who upholds the Dao, in times of clarity and stillness, partakes of morning food, and all spirits call out to speak with him, as if one now calls a guest. The hundred spirits declare themselves heaven’s officials, heaven’s envoys; the host of essences are earth’s officials, earth’s envoys; the hundred ghosts are envoys of harmony. These three are the envoys of yin, yang, and harmony, aiding heaven and earth in governance and together promoting the emperor’s benefit.\n\nThe method of guarding the One and illuminating it is the root of longevity. The myriad spirits may be mastered, emerging from the gate of radiant light. When the One’s essence is illuminated, like fire at its birth, guard it swiftly and do not lose it. It begins as true red, ends as true white, and over time becomes true azure. Profound clarity extends ever farther, then returns to govern the One, so that within there is no obscurity. All illnesses depart; guarding it without slack is the art of ten thousand years.\n\nThe method of guarding the One and illuminating it: illumination has the light of the rising sun and the brightness of midday—this is the foremost good, attaining heaven’s longevity. Dwelling in tranquility, one may preserve it for ten thousand generations without loss.\n\nThe method of guarding the One varies in excellence. What is the Dao? It is the origin of the myriad things, that which cannot be named. Within the six directions, nothing can transform without the Dao. Primordial qi practices the Dao to generate the myriad things. Great and small, heaven and earth—none are born without the Dao. Thus, primordial qi is formless, governing the formed; it unfolds primordial qi and is born not apart from the Dao.\n\nThe natural is the natural of the myriad things. Without practicing the Dao, one cannot envelop heaven and earth, each attaining its place, enabling the high to remain unaware of danger. Heaven practices the Dao, unceasing day and night, swifter than wind and rain, yet still fears losing the Dao’s intent—how much more so for kings? The Three Luminaries practice the Dao without rest, thus appearing in the heavens and illuminating the eight directions. If they lose the Dao, their light vanishes.\n\nWhen the king, the hundred officials, the myriad things, and all living beings reside together, the five stars observe their transgressions. If the king restores virtue, the Virtue Star comes to guard him. If he practices martiality, the Martial Star comes to guard him. If he practices gentleness, the Gentle Star comes to guard him. If he practices strength, the Strong Star comes to guard him. If he practices trustworthiness, the Trust Star comes to guard him. Though distant, their response is near. Heaven and humanity are one—how can one not be cautious?\n\nIn spring, the king should be warm; in summer, hot; in autumn, cool; in winter, cold—this is the king’s virtue. The king’s qi communicates with the emperor’s qi; the minister’s qi corresponds to the chief ministers; the subtle qi corresponds to petty officials; the auspicious qi aligns with the inner palace; the declining qi corresponds to the people; the qi of execution and death corresponds to prisoners—each category remotely stirs the other through the Dao. If the king’s qi does not arrive, the king’s grace cannot be bestowed.\n\nThe ancient sage-kings reflected on the Dao through this, thus discerning the signs of success and failure and examining their meaning. When the king practices the Dao, heaven and earth rejoice; when he loses the Dao, heaven and earth produce calamities and anomalies.\n\nWhen the king calmly contemplates virtue and practices the Dao to secure his person, seeking longevity and self-nourishment, harmonizing the way of husband and wife, so that yin and yang each attain their place, heaven and earth are at peace. Though heaven and the emperor are separated by ten thousand myriad li, they respond to the Dao—is this not wondrous? This is called *The Divine Formula Book*.\n\nPrimordial qi is natural, together constituting the nature of heaven and earth. When the six directions and eight quarters rejoice, good responses arise; when they do not rejoice, evil responses arise. Their forms resemble reflections, their sounds harmonize with echoes.\n\nThe Three Qi—Great Yin, Great Yang, and Harmony—together govern, mutually stirring one another. Humanity is the pivot—thus one must deeply understand this. When all value their lives and nurture their bodies, they know to honor their superiors and love their subordinates, delighting in life and hating death. When the Three Qi rejoice, together they form Great Harmony, and responses emerge in unison.",

      "translated_text": "But when the multitude of worthies is gathered, and they aspire only to the Dao of longevity, they bring tranquility to their superiors and become the treasures of the state. To nurture one’s nature is to nurture one’s people.\n\nHeaven shows no partial favor, yet its blessings are steadfast. The divine shows no partial kinship, yet the virtuous manifest its efficacy. Within a single body, one may become worthy, divine, or base—why is this? It is due to error, for the numinous is revealed. Thus, the Dao of guarding the One is to nurture one’s nature, and this lies in learning.\n\nAmong the multitude, those who encounter many auspicious responses are trustworthy; those who encounter none have erred in conduct. Through divination, right and wrong become known. What the scales discern is human sentiment. Heaven’s illumination of humanity is no different from a mirror. Examine this meaning carefully, align with Heaven’s will, and find repose with the true spirits—how could this not be auspicious?\n\nIn accomplishing affairs, not a fraction is lost, for one seeks the harmonious intent of Heaven and Earth. When Heaven and Earth are in balance, the myriad things are at peace; when the sovereign is just, the myriad people are well-governed.\n\nIf one acts purely in Yang, the Earth will not fully yield its bounty; if purely in Yin, Heaven will not fully bring forth life. Only by uniting the Three Powers—Yin and Yang in mutual accord—does harmony reside within.\n\nThe sages of antiquity brought about Great Peace by seeking the harmonious heart of Heaven and Earth. If a single qi is obstructed, a hundred affairs go awry. When the Three Qi harmonize, the laws of emperors and kings flourish. By penetrating the harmonious discourse of Heaven and Earth, one follows the Great Enterprise, roams with the Three Qi, and enables the ruler to be without cares. Worthies emerge in full, assisting and elevating the emperor, bringing great joy to Heaven.\n\nSimply by fully aligning with Heaven and Earth, not losing even a fraction, one swiftly attains Great Peace, and auspicious responses arise in unison.\n\nPrimordial qi has three names: Great Yang, Great Yin, and Harmony. Forms have three names: Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. Heaven has three names: sun, moon, and stars, with the North Star as its center. Earth has three names: mountains, rivers, and level land. Humanity has three names: father, mother, and child. Governance has three names: ruler, minister, and people—all desiring Great Peace.\n\nThese three must always be held close as heart and mind, not losing even a fraction, so that they share a single concern and unite as one household. Then Great Peace is swiftly attained, and longevity is assured without doubt.\n\nThus, the male resembles Heaven, and his thoughts dwell on the female—this is the clear manifestation of Heaven’s design for humanity. The minister serves as Earth’s conduit; Earth constantly aspires to ascend and align its heart with Heaven. Thus, the myriad things born of Earth ever rise upward without cease, and clouds and mist coalesce into rain.\n\nTherefore, the loyal minister’s concern is ever upward, tirelessly mindful of his lord—this is the clear manifestation of Earth’s design. The people embody the discourse of Harmony, for Harmony is what regulates the myriad things. Harmony is the infant, born of father and mother; its life belongs to the father, its lineage to the superior, yet it is entrusted to the mother. Thus, in distress, it yearns for its lord and father. These three reflect the images of husband and wife, father and child.\n\nThey ought to communicate freely, unite their strength in shared concern, so that the Three Qi merge into Great Harmony. From Great Harmony arises the qi of Great Peace. If these Three Qi are severed, and even one fails to reach, Great Harmony does not arrive, and Great Peace does not emerge.\n\nYin and Yang depend on Harmony. When the qi of Harmony is attained, the myriad things flourish, the people are harmonious, and the king’s governance brings Great Peace.\n\nThe ruler is Heaven; if his grace does not descend, things have no means to be born, and people cannot attain longevity. If the ruler’s heart is not open, Heaven’s heart cannot reach below. If wife and child do not receive the lord and father’s decree, the household becomes rebellious. If the minister’s qi cannot ascend, Earth’s qi cannot be fulfilled—how then can loyal ministers assist the enlightened king in governance? To wound Earth’s heart is to leave widows in the chamber, ever grieving in sorrow, so that no good minister may advance.\n\nIf the people’s qi does not ascend, how can the qi of Harmony arise? Harmony is meant to harmonize with the emperor and king, to regulate the myriad things, each attaining its proper governance. Now, if the Three Qi do not communicate well, how can Great Peace be achieved? The method of the peaceful and joyous ruler lies in this.\n\nThe ruler must transform the myriad things with virtue and power, enabling each to find its place. One who cannot transform the myriad things cannot be called a ruler. It is like a husband and wife who together bear a child—they are called parents, an image of a household. Without the ability to bear a child, how can they be called parents? Thus, one who cannot transform and give life to the myriad things cannot be called the parents of the people.\n\nFire can transform the Four Elements and itself becomes the fifth, thus earning the image of a ruler. Wood’s nature is harmonious and focused, yet with fire it scatters into ash. Metal’s nature is hard and unyielding, yet with fire it softens. Earth’s nature is greatly yielding, yet with fire it hardens into tile. Water’s nature is cold, yet with fire it warms. Fire itself aligns with the Five Phases, yet its transformations are boundless; its nature is active and ascendant.\n\nYin submits to Yang, ministers submit to rulers, and fire’s illumination is clear and penetrating, discerning right from wrong—thus it earns the name of ruler, while the others cannot. Earth does not transform immediately but does so over time—thus it is called the Queen Earth. The other three serve as assistants, images of ministers.\n\nThe Dao can transform all things, thus Primordial Qi guards the Dao, circulates its qi, and gives birth to Heaven and Earth. They stand without pillars, and the myriad things are born without fixed categories, extending to later generations in transmission, speaking of their kinds.\n\nIt is like grasses and trees growing on Earth—do they have fixed categories? It is Primordial Qi guarding the Dao that brings forth such things. Naturally guarding the Dao and acting, the myriad things each find their place.\n\nHeaven guards the Dao and acts, thus it is called divine and boundless, an image of the ruler and father, able to regulate and transform all things, truly embodying the Dao’s intent. Earth guards the Dao and acts, uniting the five directions with the center, to which the myriad things return.",
      "overlap_context": "ice, evil responses arise. Their forms resemble reflections, their sounds harmonize with echoes.\n\nThe Three Qi—Great Yin, Great Yang, and Harmony—together govern, mutually stirring one another. Humanity is the pivot—thus one must deeply understand this. When all value their lives and nurture their bodies, they know to honor their superiors and love their subordinates, delighting in life and hating death. When the Three Qi rejoice, together they form Great Harmony, and responses emerge in unison.",

      "translated_text": "Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, baleful qi has never ceased—once cut off, it later arises again. Why is this? Lifespan is Heaven’s most precious treasure. It is bestowed through private virtue and cannot be falsely attained. To know this treasure: when the six directions of Heaven and Earth, the eight distant realms, and the myriad things all remain free of grievance and entanglement, all rejoice greatly—only then is longevity increased. If even one matter brings displeasure, it immediately harms and brings death.\n\nIn human conduct, some strive to do good yet often meet with misfortune; others strive to do evil yet often meet with fortune. Those who claim themselves worthy are mistaken. Those who strive to do good yet meet misfortune bear the inherited burdens of their ancestors’ transgressions, as disasters flow forward and backward, accumulating to harm them. Those who do evil yet meet with fortune inherit the deep accumulations of their ancestors’ great merits, which flow to benefit them. If one performs great merits ten thousand times over, even if their ancestors left lingering misfortunes, these cannot reach them. Instead, the merits pass onward, flowing to their descendants as inherited blessings.\n\nFive generations form a small cycle, and after ten generations, the effects return to their origin. Some perform minor good deeds yet cannot escape imprisonment; their ancestors’ flowing evils and inherited burdens strike them, cutting off their line and leaving no descendants—truly a grievous wrong.\n\nInherited burdens are divided into three celestial ranks: the Emperor’s burdens flow for thirty thousand years, ministers’ for three thousand years, and the common people’s for three hundred years. All bear and pass on these burdens in succession, rising and falling with the decline and flourishing of governance, never ceasing. If one now follows this principle, modeling governance on the Heavenly August Emperor to sever these burdens, they must ponder deeply and never forget.\n\nHumans possess three lifespans, corresponding to three qi: the life of Great Yang, Great Yin, and the Harmonious Center. The upper lifespan is one hundred twenty years, the middle eighty, and the lower sixty. One hundred twenty corresponds to Heaven’s great reckoning, completing the boundary of Heaven and Earth in a single year. Eighty corresponds to the division of Yin and Yang, the eight pairs that align with Earth, distinguishing the myriad things—those that die depart, while those that live remain. Sixty corresponds to the qi of the Harmonious Center, attaining the hexagram *Dun* in the sixth month. *Dun* means escape and disappearance, thus governing the meeting of life and death.\n\nIf one ceaselessly practices good, surpassing these lifespans, it is called transcending the world. If one ceaselessly practices evil, falling short of these three lifespans, it is called premature death. Those who die in the womb or before maturity bear the innocent inherited burdens of their ancestors’ transgressions.\n\nThose with frequent head ailments suffer from Heaven’s displeasure. Those with frequent foot ailments suffer from Earth’s displeasure. Those with frequent internal organ illnesses suffer from the warring qi of the five phases. Those with frequent limb ailments suffer from the disharmony of the four seasons’ qi. Those with frequent deafness and blindness suffer from the three luminaries losing their proper measure. Those with frequent chills and fevers suffer from the contention of Yin and Yang qi. Those with frequent confusion and disorder suffer from the myriad things losing their place. Those with frequent afflictions by ghosts and spirits suffer from the anger of Heaven and Earth’s deities. Those who often die of warmth-related illnesses are slain by Great Yang qi. Those who often die of cold are harmed by Great Yin qi. Those who often die suddenly are struck by excessively harsh punitive qi. Those who often suffer from bloating or shortness of breath suffer from the discord of the eight solar terms.\n\nNow, Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang have entirely lost their proper places, thus harming the myriad things. If the Emperor’s governance is disharmonious, floods and droughts occur without pattern, bandits arise frequently, and punishments are made harsher—yet this only increases chaos, entangling and unresolved. The people all cry out to Heaven, while the court’s governance is disordered, losing its rhythm and constancy. The myriad things are harmed, moving even the Azure Heaven above. The three luminaries rage and change erratically, the constellations move in disorder—thus, only the utmost Dao can save them. I know Heaven’s intent does not deceive you.\n\nHeaven’s might, once unleashed, cannot be restrained. To incur guilt before Heaven is to invite premature death.\n\nFrom the opening of Heaven and Earth since the Great Beginning, sages each comprehended one aspect with perfect clarity, knowing it truly without doubt. Thus, each established one great enterprise, enabling later generations to cultivate it without error. Therefore, sages each excelled in one great enterprise yet could not fully know the Dao of Heaven—hence, their virtues differed. This is like Heaven and Earth: how much more so for humans? Heaven and Earth each excel in one aspect: Heaven excels in height and clarity, Earth in depth and turbidity, while the Harmonious Center nurtures the myriad things. Even they cannot encompass all—how much less can ordinary people?\n\n*Hai* is the northwest extreme of Heaven and Earth; *Si* is the southeast extreme. If *Hai*’s cold does not close in due time, the following year’s *Si* will be harmed in return. *Zi* is the north extreme of Heaven and Earth; *Wu* is the south extreme. If this winter’s *Zi* does not properly store and conceal, *Wu* will bear the inherited burden and perish in return. *Chou* is the northeast extreme of Heaven and Earth; *Wei* is the southwest extreme. If *Chou* does not timely bring forth life, the sixth month will suffer its punishment in return. The nature and movement of Heaven and Earth are all thus.\n\nNow, if the Emperor dwells within the hundredfold layers, governing with virtue and benevolence, his grace extends ten thousand *li*, and the people receive his favor. Fathers are kind, children filial; households are sufficient, and people do not turn to wickedness. If the Emperor within loses his virtue, beyond ten thousand *li*, officials and people lose their proper roles—though they are separated by countless *li*, the cause is one.\n\nPracticing good words is not as effective as practicing good conduct in oneself.\n\nThe Perfected One asked the Divine Person: “In my life, what can I do to always be joyful?”\n\nThe Divine Person replied: “Do you recall the ancient, vast Perfected One? The reason he aged after others was that he abandoned the depraved and solely cherished the true Dao. The true Dao is constantly preserved, while the depraved vanish. While all people suffer hardship, I alone endure—this is constant joy. Shining brightly and rejoicing alone, what resentment could there be? Even if one ultimately cannot attain long life, what can be done?”",

      "translated_text": "The Divine Person said: “Accumulated practice nears completion; thoughts of goodness nears life. The Dao is the scripture of the boundless. In ancient times, the Divine Persons governed, taking Perfected Ones as ministers to rule the people—thus the people knew not that above them there was an emperor, and through the Dao’s natural non-action, they governed themselves. Next, the Perfected Ones governed, taking Immortals as ministers; though they did not see the people, the people occasionally knew there was an emperor, hearing his teachings and revering their lord. Next, the Immortals governed, taking Daoists as ministers; their rule bore slight traces of punishment and law, and the people’s hearts stirred with fear, giving rise to cunning and deceit. Next came hegemonic rule, where ministers were not carefully chosen, the people suffered many grievances, and chaos arose. As governance receded, disorder drew near, and control could no longer be restored.\n\nThus, to think of the divine is to summon the divine; to think of the Perfected is to summon the Perfected; to think of the Immortal is to summon the Immortal; to think of the Dao is to summon the Dao; to think of wisdom is to summon wisdom. When the sage’s concentrated thoughts turn to the worthy, the spirit of the worthy comes to aid him; when thoughts turn to depravity, the ghosts of fools come to delude him. Whatever a person may contemplate can be summoned—only the excellence or inferiority of what is thought differs.\n\nTherefore, when a superior scholar becomes ruler, he thinks of the divine and Perfected; when a middling scholar becomes ruler, his mind is penetrating and full of wisdom; when an inferior scholar becomes ruler, he cannot think deeply and merely follows fate as it unfolds.\n\nThe Perfected One asked: “How can one know whether an emperor’s thoughts are good or evil?”\n\nThe Divine Person replied: “It is easily known. When an emperor thinks of benevolence and goodness, auspicious signs appear solely for him, and prophetic texts arise solely for him. Emperors of benevolence and clarity are born of Wood and Fire; those of martial wisdom are born of Metal and Water; those of gentleness and harmony are born of Earth. Heaven’s descending omens never err.”\n\nThe Perfected One asked: “In ancient times, extraordinary prophetic texts and rare methods—who was worthy to receive them?”\n\n“Officials and commoners who obtained them presented them to their king. When the emperor’s *qi* of the times was harmonious and good, governance grew ever clearer, Daoist arts and worthy sages emerged to assist him, and the emperor’s Way daily grew stronger. The barbarians were pacified and vanished; he governed with folded arms, punishments ceased of themselves, and the people knew no warfare. Is this not proof of an emperor’s good thoughts? Even without seeing the man, one already knows.”\n\nThe Perfected One asked: “How does the Divine Person know this?”\n\nThe Divine Person said: “By attaining it without sound. When the ruler desires benevolence and cherishes life, he models the Way of Heaven; when ministers desire gentleness, compliance, and nurturing, they follow the Way of Earth—then good omens appear. Thus Heaven and Earth do not speak yet endure forever; their governance is uniquely divine. The divine and numinous do not speak yet attain long life as Immortals—all through inner illumination and outer obscurity, which is the origin of the ten thousand Ways.\n\nThe divine and numinous move in and out without lairs or nests; pure and tranquil, without sound, they lie at ease upon their pillows, and their spiritual radiance arises of itself. How could this not be joyous and auspicious? Those who use their mouths excessively deplete their essence; those who exert their strength excessively weary their bodies; those who employ force excessively harm themselves—from these arise misfortune and calamity. Heed my words and do not think recklessly. Good thoughts may bring virtue, but evil thoughts return to harm oneself. Between safety and danger, the difference is as fine as a hair’s breadth—beware of mixed thoughts.\n\nWhen a person loses the Dao, their fate is cut off; when one truly understands the Dao’s intent, life may be preserved. Strive to nurture your essence and do not consume yourself. Study under an enlightened teacher, and misfortune and chaos will not arise.”\n\nThe Perfected One dared not disregard the Divine Person’s words.\n\nThe Divine Person said: “Learners act for themselves, not for others. Thus each should cherish and draw near to themselves. Through long accumulation in studying the Dao, one becomes a divine Perfected One, utterly distinct from the multitude—such are my words.”\n\nThe Perfected One asked: “How can one know the efficacy of the Dao?”\n\nThe Divine Person said: “Resolve it through an enlightened teacher, practice it in oneself. The body transforms and changes form, entering the same gate as the divine Way, becoming neighbors with the Perfected, sharing a door with the Divine Person. Seek it within yourself—how could misfortune be seen? If one loses the Dao’s intent and instead seeks it in the four wilds, searching in vain, one reaches old age in poverty. Thus severed from the root, one claims the world has no Dao, ever alone in sorrow and suffering—this is the greatest calamity. The great person, losing it, cannot level their governance; the middling scholar, losing it, brings chaos to their lord; the benevolent person, losing it, has no way to act as a worthy; the petty person, losing it, destroys themselves. The conduct of the ancient worthies and sages is the same as today’s; the ruin of the ancient petty people is also the same as today’s—clear evidence indeed.”\n\nThe Perfected One asked: “How can one know whether a person will rise or fall?”\n\nThe Divine Person said: “When a great person is about to rise, extraordinary texts appear, and the worthy assist in governance. When a household is about to rise, those who seek will find life, and the goodness of their descendants can be known.”\n\nThe Perfected One asked: “How can one summon such worthies?”\n\nThe Divine Person said: “All through thought. With unceasing concentrated thought, all things come. How wondrous is the Dao’s governance—can one not strive to practice it?”\n\nThe Divine Person said: “The Three Bonds and Six Disciplines endure in good fortune because they uphold the Dao and do not lose their governance—thus they are always auspicious. Heaven’s lifespan does not override human wishes. The nature of Wood is benevolence; thinking of benevolence thus summons the East, for the East governs benevolence. The five directions are all like this. All matters under Heaven follow their kind—thus when an emperor thinks of tranquility, his governance is also tranquil, for like calls to like.\n\nThe ancients who studied emulated it in themselves; today’s scholars emulate it in others. The ancients studied to secure themselves; today’s scholars pursue superficial ornamentation, not accumulating essence in themselves but accumulating essence in texts—this is to be ignorant of the root.”\n\n*Excerpts from the Tai Ping Jing, Concluding Section of Scroll Two of the Yi Division*\n*Beginning of Scroll Three of the Bing Division of the Tai Ping Jing*",
      "overlap_context": " “In my life, what can I do to always be joyful?”\n\nThe Divine Person replied: “Do you recall the ancient, vast Perfected One? The reason he aged after others was that he abandoned the depraved and solely cherished the true Dao. The true Dao is constantly preserved, while the depraved vanish. While all people suffer hardship, I alone endure—this is constant joy. Shining brightly and rejoicing alone, what resentment could there be? Even if one ultimately cannot attain long life, what can be done?”",

      "translated_text": "Distinguishing between poverty and wealth, when the ruler enacts this, it establishes good fortune—prohibiting the severance of the earth’s lineage to promote the flourishing of men and women, thereby restoring the king’s governance. What is called wealth in the world? What is called poverty? Indeed, those who possess much are wealthy, and those who possess little are poor. Yet your words, while correct, are also fundamentally untrue. Can the deceitful, the false, the thieves, and the bandits truly be called wealthy? Today, the common people are many, and the emperors few—how can this be called poverty?\n\nWealth, in its meaning, is complete sufficiency. Heaven deems all things fully born as wealth and sufficiency. Thus, in the era of the Upper August, qi emerged, and the twelve thousand things were born in diversity—this was called wealth and sufficiency. In the era of the Middle August, things diminished and could not fully sustain the twelve thousand things, thus it was called minor poverty. In the era of the Lower August, things were even fewer than in the Middle August—this was called great poverty. Without auspicious responses, when good things do not arise, it is extreme poverty. When all things emerge and the earth nourishes them without harm, this is the earth’s wealth; when it cannot nourish things, it is great poverty.\n\nHeaven is the father, earth the mother—when these parents reach extreme poverty, their children grow poorer by the day. In ancient times, the emperor who governed the world with the Dao could bring forth the twelve thousand things—this was the ruler of supreme wealth. When good things fell short by two-thirds, it was the ruler of middle wealth; by one-third, the ruler of lesser wealth. When rare things did not arise, it was the ruler of extreme poverty.\n\nThe ancient emperors of the Dao dwelled in seclusion, contemplating virtue and power, and the myriad things were naturally sufficient—was this not joyous? When the emperor practices the Dao, the celestial spirits aid his transformation; when he practices virtue, the earthly spirits aid his governance; when he practices harmony, the human spirits aid his rule; but when he practices ornamentation, it becomes the path of hidden deceit. Thus, deceitful spirits assist him, and his governance runs counter to the will of Heaven, harming the good.\n\nRuling the world with military force, subduing people through punishment and execution, is like thieves and bandits inflicting harm through execution. The original intent of the emperor’s laws is retribution by kind. Heaven delights in giving life, thus it is called the Lord and Father. Earth delights in tranquility and nourishing the myriad things, thus it is called the Mother. Using the heart to cherish and love all things—this is called benevolence. These two are good, thus they are called teachers and elders.\n\nGreatly aligning with Heaven and Earth, harmonizing yin and yang, with no grievances between men and women, brings timely rain, harmonizes the two qi, and the earth gives birth to the myriad things. When the emperor’s Dao governs, it swiftly brings Great Peace.\n\nIf chaste men do not bestow and chaste women do not transform, yin and yang do not unite, and the lineage of the world is extinguished—when two people together sever the lineage of Heaven and Earth, coveting hollow and false reputations, they leave no descendants, losing the true essence. This is the world’s greatest harm. If Heaven were to remain chaste, timely rain would not fall; if Earth were to remain chaste, the myriad things would not be born. Not bestowing, not giving birth—this harm is great indeed.\n\nWhen Heaven is about to send rain, it first stirs wind and clouds so that people may know. The reason for this is to prompt them to gather and store. Now, as the qi of Great Peace is about to arrive, fearing that people will not cease their evil, it first awakens them. The emperor should model himself on Heaven and Earth, first observing the virtuous Dao in royal affairs.\n\n**The Method for Resolving Karmic Debt:**\nSince the opening of Heaven and Earth, emperors, ministers, and the people have borne karmic debt, and this is why teachings have emerged. From emperors and ministers to the common people, all who bear karmic debt pass it to later generations—this is due to their inability to nurture goodness, losing their guiding principles, thus incurring karmic responsibility.\n\nFor example, if parents lose virtue and commit wrongs in their village, their descendants will surely be harmed by the village—this is the proof of karmic debt. In ancient times, emperors, ministers, and the people each knew the way to nurture themselves—how could there have been karmic debt?\n\nHeaven does not deceive people: sow millet, and you reap millet; sow wheat, and you reap wheat. It depends on the effort expended, whether the harvest is good or bad. Resolving the enmity of karmic debt for the August Heaven, resolving the calamity of karmic debt for the Earth, resolving the distress of karmic debt for the emperor, resolving the transgressions of karmic debt for the myriad people, resolving the responsibility of karmic debt for the twelve thousand things—there is nothing better for resolving karmic debt than abiding by the One. If one abides by the One for long, Heaven will take pity.\n\nThe One is the guiding principle of Heaven and the root of the myriad things. Contemplate its root, and it will extend to its branches. When the sages of old were about to act, they observed the celestial patterns above and examined the earthly principles below, clarifying root and branch, witnessing their evident effects.\n\nThe people of the world have four hardships—what are they? A child, born of parents, in youth cannot leave their thoughts of their parents—this is the first hardship. When grown and self-reliant, a woman desires marriage, a man desires a wife, yet they cannot overcome their passions, and their love prevents separation—this is the second hardship. Once in love, they bear children; as husband and wife age, their appearance is no longer lovely, but their young children are lovable and must be raised—this is the third hardship. When the children grow, they no longer need to be raised, but the parents themselves age and do not understand how to conduct themselves—this is the fourth hardship.\n\nAfter these four hardships, if one can find a wise teacher and contemplate guarding the Dao, it may yet be well. Those of high talent with heavenly mandate may transcend the world; the next may attain longevity; the next may briefly enjoy their bodies. When the hun and po reside beneath the earth, they may yet find joy. Why is this? Beneath the earth, all newly deceased arrive and are questioned about their deeds in life, their records clearly established, and they are held accountable for their actions. Thus, one must prepare in advance for safety and peril.\n\nThe ruler should contemplate Great Peace, aligning with the heart of Heaven, so that hun, po, and spirit constantly unite with qi. Those who cannot bring peace to their governance do not align with the heart of Heaven, do not gain Heaven’s favor, and are deemed to have no merit before Heaven. In the end, their hun, po, and spirit will be held solely accountable beneath the earth, uniting with evil qi.\n\nThe ancient supreme sage-rulers understood this well, thus they exerted themselves to do good.",

      "translated_text": "The foolish do not ponder deeply, thus in life they incur Heaven’s reproach, and in death they incur Earth’s reproach—how can this not be terrifying? Swiftly transmit my writings so that all under Heaven may practice them, each reflecting on their own essence, their thoughts aligning with the Great Dao. Once they recognize the origin of their transgressions, the burden of inherited responsibility shall be lifted. Heaven and Earth will rejoice greatly, reverting to the ancient age and doubling its blessings.\n\nHeaven is One, yet it acts through Earth as Two—what is the meaning of this? Now Earth is Two, yet it acts through Man as Three—why is this? Earth serves as Heaven’s agent, and Man serves as Earth’s agent. Thus, when Heaven is pleased, it immediately causes all things upon Earth to rejoice. Though Earth nurtures all beings, if goodness prevails, the people dwell in goodness—this is the clear effect of their mutual agency.\n\nThe causes of order and chaos are manifold. Those who do not align with Heaven’s heart must return to their root. When human speech proliferates, it too leads to chaos. But if one returns to the root, what cause for concern is there?\n\nThus, a single word that achieves its purpose is the root. A second word that suffices forms a coherent phrase. A third word that suffices instead becomes an explanation of difficulties, for the farther one strays from truth, the more explanations are needed. A fourth word that suffices instead becomes literary embellishment. A fifth word that suffices instead becomes falsehood. A sixth word that suffices instead leads to failure. A seventh word that suffices instead leads to ruin. An eighth word that suffices instead leads to separation and estrangement, growing ever more distant. A ninth word that suffices instead leads to great chaos. A tenth word that suffices instead leads to destruction and annihilation. Thus, upon reaching ten, one must reform, for further transmission only brings ruin.\n\nIn all matters, when destruction occurs, one must return to the root. Therefore, return and hold fast to the One as the origin. Hence, numbers begin with One and end with Ten—this is the natural principle governing order and chaos.\n\nThus, the sages of antiquity, when consulting the oracle, first divined once: its auspice or inauspice was decisive. By holding to the root, the celestial spirits would descend with their message. A second divination summoned the earthly spirits to speak. A third divination summoned the human spirits to speak. Beyond this, all is deception, unworthy of divination, and the hexagrams lose their accuracy. Human discourse, when excessive, is not to be treasured.\n\nHow excellent! The celestial numbers begin with One and end with Ten—why is this? Heaven is One, and below it, Earth is Two. Yin and Yang unite to give birth to all things. The first signs of life emerge as primordial qi arises in the *zi* hour, turns northeast to spread roots in the *jiao* constellation, then moves east to sprout and grow, shifts southeast to develop branches and leaves, turns south to flourish, moves west to ripen, and turns northwest to reach completion. When things come to an end, they must begin anew, thus the *hai* hour: two embracing one, the beginning of the Three Sovereigns. Therefore, *hai* is the kernel, the first coagulation of the seed—hence water begins to congeal in the tenth month. *Ren* means \"to bear,\" for what is borne must grow day by day. Thus, *zi* means \"to multiply.\" When Three achieves the harmony of Yin and Yang’s qi, all is complete, and it returns to the beginning, hence the name *jiazi*. The Dao of Heaven in generating things must circulate fully, uniting the qi of the four seasons and five phases to bring them to completion. Thus, it is rooted in Heaven and Earth, circulating through the eight directions, and the numbers end at Ten.\n\nQuestion: Of the governance of emperors and feudal lords, which is most excellent?\nAnswer: To extend compassion without harm, acting as Heaven does—this is most excellent. In governance, nothing surpasses emulating the great image of Heaven. Yet there must be an order of priority. What does this mean?\n\nThe highest good is to cherish life, desiring it as urgently as one craves water—only then is it acceptable. Next is to delight in the goodness of others as if it were one’s own. Next is to bestow upon others: when seeing someone in poverty, one should feel their sorrow as keenly as if suffering hunger and cold. Next is to establish laws, ensuring that fear alone deters transgression. Next, for those guilty of grave crimes, governance should prevent them from falling into wrongdoing. Next, when someone commits an offense, if unavoidable, ensure it does not implicate their family or neighbors. Next, if the offense extends to neighbors, one should identify the guilty party while taking care not to sever their lineage. Humans are the stewards of Heaven, Earth, and the divine luminaries. To harm and disrupt the body of Heaven and Earth is to invite profound calamity. Do not bring the burden of inherited responsibility upon descendants. Constantly aspire to Great Peace to dissolve the obstructions of punishment.\n\nI expound for Heaven and Earth, composing this for rulers of supreme virtue, that they may eliminate the burdens of inherited responsibility since the opening of Heaven and Earth. If this discourse is neglected, one will surely incur the resentment of the August Heaven and the Sacred Earth, and bear the burden of responsibility before the enlightened and virtuous rulers of the past—such a transgression would be grave indeed.\n\nI have collated and examined the Daoist scriptures of high, middle, and low antiquity, gathering the wise to read them together and survey the texts of Dao from past and present. If one scripture yields one good precept, record it. If one good technique is found, note it down as the matter arises. One scripture yields one goodness, ten scriptures yield ten goodnesses, a hundred yield a hundred, a thousand yield a thousand, ten thousand yield ten thousand, and a hundred million yield a hundred million goodnesses. Record them accordingly, then assemble the wise to deliberate, removing redundancies. From this, compile the essential texts to fully grasp the profound intent of Heaven, Earth, humanity, and the myriad things in ancient and modern times. Condensing the insights of nine sages—could there be any injustice?\n\nThe king’s governance, rejoicing in this, will resolve the inherited burdens of his predecessors. Humans are the foremost of the myriad things. The formless spirit-people, composed of refined qi, are charged with governing primordial qi. The great spirit-people govern Heaven, the perfected people govern Earth, the immortals govern the four seasons, the great Daoists govern the five phases, the sages govern Yin and Yang, the worthies govern documents and receive teachings, ordinary people govern plants and the five grains, and servants govern wealth and goods.",
      "overlap_context": "The ruler should contemplate Great Peace, aligning with the heart of Heaven, so that hun, po, and spirit constantly unite with qi. Those who cannot bring peace to their governance do not align with the heart of Heaven, do not gain Heaven’s favor, and are deemed to have no merit before Heaven. In the end, their hun, po, and spirit will be held solely accountable beneath the earth, uniting with evil qi.\n\nThe ancient supreme sage-rulers understood this well, thus they exerted themselves to do good.",

      "translated_text": "Heaven appoints offices according to nature, never overriding their inherent inclinations—each follows its kind without error. To act contrary invites great harm. Thus, all the common people under Heaven’s charge must comply with this principle. The sages of antiquity deeply understood this, never deviating from Heaven’s intent, thereby gaining Heaven’s favor. The nine ranks each govern with ease, securing Heaven’s favor; when the nine qi harmonize, they bring about Great Peace. These nine matters mutually generate and complete one another—if even one qi fails to harmonize, some will not arrive. If primordial qi is disharmonious, the formless spirit-people will not come. If Heaven’s qi is disharmonious, the great spirit-people will not come. If Earth’s qi is disharmonious, the perfected people will not come. If the four seasons are disharmonious, the immortals will not come. If the five phases are disharmonious, the great Daoists will not come. If Yin and Yang are disharmonious, the sages will not come. If the myriad things are disharmonious, the common people will fall into chaos, goods and wealth will diminish, and servants will flee. When any office fails in its duty, the harm is thus. Obtaining these nine ranks can dispel the inherited burdens of ten thousand generations of kings. These nine ranks ascend to the formless spirit-people and descend to servants—each regulates a single qi.\n\nTherefore, the superior scholar who cultivates the Dao must first consume qi, seeking to harmonize with primordial qi. He should fast in a thatched chamber, avoiding all evil, refining his form daily, and never yielding to desire. Thus, he may move freely between realms, aiding the immortals and perfected in governing Heaven’s primordial qi. Such is the divine scholar, an official of Heaven. Unrestrained and unbound, if he truly attains this, he is called a Heavenly Scholar. Heaven reviews the virtuous, rejoicing greatly, and in turn benefits humanity.\n\nThough one who attains the Dao and departs this world may not serve an immediate purpose, he can harmonize Yin and Yang’s qi to benefit the myriad things. The ancient kings sacrificed to the celestial deities for the sake of these divine officials. All, from sages to servants, have their limits—the highest are the formless spirit-people, the lowest are servants. The spirit-people move by riding qi; thus, where there is qi, there is spirit, and when qi ceases, spirit perishes. This is the luminous decree of August Heaven, by which the governance of human rulers is judged, and the effects of success or failure are made manifest.",

      "translated_text": "The interplay of punishment and virtue is the manifest efficacy of Heaven and Earth’s governance through Yin and Yang spirits, serving as the model for all things and the people. Thus, in the eleventh month, great virtue resides in the *nine-one* position, dwelling beneath the earth. At this time, virtue abides within the chamber, so the inner realm possesses qi, and the myriad things return to it. The *six-four* position, situated in the four wilds, holds the outward form, so the outer realm lacks qi and dissipates. The outer expanse is empty of all things, and the multitudes of scholars and commoners all return, following the king’s virtue into the depths of the Yellow Springs.\n\nIn the twelfth month, virtue resides in the *nine-two* position, in the *chou* hour, dwelling within the earth’s center yet to emerge. At this time, virtue abides in the Bright Hall, and the myriad things follow virtue upward but dare not appear, for punishment looms above. In the first month, the *yin* hour, virtue resides in the *nine-three* position, and all things without exception follow its flourishing power, rejoicing in their emergence upon the earth. At this time, virtue dwells in the courtyard.\n\nIn the second month, virtue resides in the *nine-four* position, in the *mao* and *si* hours, neither fully departed from the earth nor yet reaching Heaven, but precisely at the boundary. Virtue abides at the gate, so all things delight in peering outward from the gate. In the third month, flourishing virtue resides in the *nine-five* position atop the *chen* hour, reaching the center of Heaven. At this time, virtue abides in the outer pathways, so all things emerge and dwell outside.\n\nIn the fourth month, the *si* hour, virtue resides in the *nine-six* position, extending to the six distant boundaries and eight frontiers. Flourishing virtue pervades the eight directions, and the auspicious qi of Yang responds in kind. The teeming living things depart from the four chambers and the wilds. At this time, punishment resides at the roots of the myriad things, dwelling within the inner chamber. The lower chamber is empty, while the upper flourishes, and none fail to delight in following virtue to govern. This is the great manifest efficacy of governance through virtue.\n\nNow, I have heard of employing virtue but have not heard of employing punishment. Yet, in the fifth month, punishment resides in the *six-one* position, in the *wu* hour beneath the earth. The inner realm lacks qi, and the earth below is empty. At this time, punishment abides in the void, and the inner realm is empty of all things, which all dwell outside.\n\nIn the sixth month, punishment resides in the *six-two* position, in the *wei* hour, dwelling within the earth’s center yet to emerge. At this time, punishment abides in the Bright Hall, its qi within, while virtue’s qi is without. The teeming living things all delight in exposing themselves and returning to flourishing virtue. In the seventh month, punishment resides in the *six-three* position, in the *shen* hour, abiding in the courtyard. The myriad things dare not enter and firmly delight in dwelling outside.\n\nIn the eighth month, punishment resides in the *six-four* position, in the *you* hour, not yet reaching the Heavenly boundary. At this time, virtue abides at the gate, and all things delight in peering from the gate, rejoicing in entering and following virtue to return. In the ninth month, punishment resides in the *six-five* position, atop the *xu* hour, reaching the center. At this time, punishment abides in the pathways, and none of the myriad things fail to perish by dawn, following virtue to conceal themselves. Thus, the inner realm flourishes daily, while the outer is empty and desolate.\n\nIn the tenth month, punishment resides in the *six-six* position, in the *hai* hour, extending to the six distant boundaries, eight frontiers, and four wilds. The teeming living things all conceal themselves and flee, following virtue’s movement into the Bright Hall. Crawling creatures carry their young within, while the wilds outside are empty of scholars and multitudes. This is not because punishment is favored, but rather that those who employ it are seen as perverse. Yet if the heart inwardly harbors punishment to govern the multitudes, their numbers dwindle daily.\n\nIn the fifth month, harboring one measure of punishment within causes one group of the multitudes to rebel. In the sixth month, harboring two measures of punishment causes two groups to rebel. In the seventh month, harboring three measures causes three groups to rebel. In the eighth month, harboring four measures causes four groups to rebel. In the ninth month, harboring five measures causes five groups to rebel. In the tenth month, harboring six measures causes the multitudes of the six directions to rebel. Thus, the outer realm is utterly empty of all things, all fleeing inward—this is the manifest proof.\n\nTherefore, governance through punishment appears reverent outwardly but harbors rebellion within, so the multitudes diminish daily. Conversely, in the eleventh month, harboring one measure of virtue within draws one group of the multitudes inward. In the twelfth month, harboring two measures draws two groups inward. In the first month, harboring three measures draws three groups inward. In the second month, harboring four measures draws four groups inward. In the third month, harboring five measures of flourishing Yang virtue draws five groups of worthy ones inward. From the fourth month onward, the six virtues cause all things to emerge and appear, and none fail to teem and return, both within and without. This is the manifest model of Heaven’s Bright Hall.\n\nIn the second and eighth months, virtue and punishment are evenly matched, so the myriad things are half-damaged by cold. Punishment daily harms and kills, inspiring dread and fear, and thus fails to win the people’s strength. The sages of antiquity ruled through virtue and the Dao, not through physical force or punishment. They established models and laws, setting forth teachings and decrees for emperors and kings to follow in governance.\n\nWhen the kingly Way is about to flourish, it takes its model from virtue; when it is about to decline, it takes its model from punishment. In establishing laws and institutions for emperors and kings, one must first clarify Heaven’s intent, inwardly illuminating the Dao of Yin and Yang—then Great Peace will arrive.\n\nThe Heavenly Master thus joins with the August Heaven and Earth, constantly concentrating their essence and thought, their hearts deeply attuned to Heaven and Earth’s intent, like overlapping compasses or interlocking squares, not deviating even by a hair’s breadth. Knowing what Heaven and Earth constantly sorrow over, and foreseeing their great taboos—what are these?\n\nThe spirits of Heaven and Earth deeply lament and suffer from people’s disobedience and lack of filial piety. What does this mean? Within Heaven and Earth, the three qi of harmonious balance unite as one family to nurture the myriad things. Heaven governs life and is called Father; Earth governs nurturance and is called Mother; humanity governs governance and is called Child. The Child receives the mandate from the Father and is lovingly nurtured by the Mother. As a child, one must respectfully serve the Father and love the Mother—what does this mean?\n\nThe Father’s teachings have their measures and seasons, so he instructs and brings forth life in accordance with the four seasons. Wicked people oppose the Father’s intent, causing Heaven’s qi to lose its governance. This is like a household where the father is angry with his child, and father and child are at odds. Yin overcomes Yang, the lower deceives the upper, ministers neglect their duties, and demonic forces flourish. The positions of Heaven and Earth are like the distinction between male and female in humans—their likes and dislikes are the same. Heaven nurtures human life, and Earth nurtures human form.",

      "translated_text": "Now, all who jointly harm their Father and Mother—how is this so?\n\nThe qi of the four seasons is Heaven’s governance in motion, yet people oppose it, thus harming their Father. Earth is their Mother, from whom they receive clothing, food, and nurturance; yet instead of loving and benefiting her, they turn to harm her. Human conduct is most unseemly, defying all reason. They bore into the earth, launching vast earthworks—some digging deep to the Yellow Springs, others several fathoms down. The Mother alone grieves in sorrow, while her many children, utterly lacking in filial reverence, constantly vex her with resentment and stifled distress, yet she has no means to voice her plight. In ancient times, the sages moved with the seasons, yet even they could not fully grasp the intent of Heaven and Earth. Ordinary people, ignorant of the earth, do not perceive her pain and suffering, nor do they sense her influence upon Heaven. Thus, when the Father’s calamities recur, the Mother grows wrathful and ceases to nurture the myriad things. When both Father and Mother are enraged, how can their children escape disaster?\n\nHeaven and Earth are supremely compassionate, yet for the great crime of filial impiety, they grant no pardon—how can one not tremble? Great earthworks bring great disasters; small earthworks bring small disasters. It is the Earth’s wrath that summons the spirits to generate such calamities. If earthworks do not immediately result in disaster, it is because the land is good and kind. Where disaster strikes, the land is fierce and malevolent. The ruler’s harm extends even to distant lands—what does this mean? It is like a good and kind person who, though wronged, endures for a time, yet never forgets the grievance. The wicked cannot endure even for a moment before disaster befalls them.\n\nThe Earth’s body is vast, while humans, in comparison, are as small as dust. How can their digging possibly cause harm? Yet consider this: a person stands a fathom tall, ten spans in girth, and in the crevices of their teeth dwell tiny, insignificant worms. When these worms gnaw at the teeth, causing great pain, the person wails for a long time, and the teeth eventually fall out entirely. The disparity between humans and Heaven and Earth is like that between these worms and a person. Even if one’s teeth were as hard as metal or stone, these tiny, fleshy worms could still cause such harm. Now, if a strong and mighty man were powerless to resist a pint of mites gnawing at him, he would be stricken with pain and unable to lie down—severe cases would confine him to bed. Even fleas, lice, and other tiny creatures, when gathered in great numbers, can torment a person, causing restlessness and sores. Parasitic worms can kill, while fleas and lice bring only vexation and discomfort. The harm humans inflict upon Heaven and Earth is no different.\n\nTo dig into the earth and reach the springs is to draw the Earth’s blood; to uncover stone is to expose her bones; soil is her flesh. To take her blood, break her bones, and pierce her flesh, then cast bricks, stones, and hardwood into her depths—these are wounds upon her body. Earth is the Mother of all things, yet she suffers such afflictions—how can she remain at peace?\n\nAll who dwell upon the Mother’s body have their own hidden vulnerabilities. Digging one foot into the earth reaches the realm touched by the sun, where qi belongs to Heaven. Two feet down lies the realm where things grow, where qi is harmonious. Three feet down enters the Earth’s yin body, and beyond this, all digging harms her form.\n\nTo equalize virtue and power, to adjust values and prices, is to open the hearts of the foolish. Now, if I were to bestow upon you a thousand pounds of gold to offer to the state, would this win the favor of Heaven and Earth, regulate yin and yang, eradicate all disasters, grant the emperor long life, and bring about great peace? Or if I were to present a jade disc of myriad hues to the state, treasuring and hoarding it as the world’s rarest gem—would this cause the qi of the Six Directions to harmonize fully, summoning all auspicious signs, driving back the barbarians, and ensuring no harm for ten thousand miles?\n\nI have now fully expounded the Way to you. By following it, the emperor can secure the favor of Heaven and Earth, delighting all the spirits under heaven. Even the crawling and creeping creatures will rejoice, the barbarians will retreat in submission, auspicious signs will appear in full, disasters will vanish entirely, the state’s lifespan will be prolonged, and the people will enjoy long life.\n\nIf you truly embrace goodness and practice the teachings of this text, pondering its essential meaning, all will respond as if in echo. It is like aligning a compass with a square—there will be no deviation.\n\nTo give a state a thousand pounds of gold is not as valuable as imparting a single essential word to bring about great peace, eliminate disasters, and secure the realm. Ancient emperors never lacked for wealth or goods; what they lacked were *shi*—men of worth. They grieved that great sages did not come, that the people did not gather, and that all sought to attach themselves to foreign lands, growing ever more distant. This is what fails to accord with the will of August Heaven.\n\nEven if one were to amass gold, jade, and rare treasures stretching a thousand miles and towering to the heavens, it would never attract the great sages, immortals, or divine beings to aid the emperor’s governance. Yet this text is attended by the divine officials of the Three Luminaries, who constantly observe and illuminate it.\n\nThe conduct of the ruler’s ministers and people should be such that they constantly worry for their sovereign day and night. Their desire to bring peace stems from their concern for his suffering, and they rejoice when the emperor governs effortlessly, while the people and ministers emulate his filial piety and kindness.\n\nWhen the ruler aligns with the heart of Heaven above and the intent of Earth below, and the central realm ensures that all people are reverent, without grievances or resentment, even the crawling creatures will turn toward virtue. All things will find their proper place, Heaven and Earth will be harmonious and joyful, and the ruler’s lifespan will be extended. From the eldest to the youngest, none will commit evil in the realm. They will cherish their ruler, fearing his aging, and Heaven and Earth will surely send divine beings bearing elixirs to instruct the emperor in their use, granting him boundless longevity.\n\nWhat, then, is the conduct of the finest ministers and children? The foremost conduct of a filial child is this: when their parents grow old and frail, they dwell alone in quiet contemplation, pondering how to obtain the art of immortality to serve them. They scorn wealth and treasure the Way, seeking only to sustain life. They play the zither and sing to bring joy to their parents, guiding their hearts toward the Dao. They delight in remaining with them for all time, never knowing old age.",

      "translated_text": "Ever seeking rare methods, they journey to distant lands, their sincerity moving Heaven, their efforts unceasing until their strength is spent. With clothing and food just sufficient for themselves, they no longer amass treasures for posterity, lest their parents be burdened with guarding them. Such is the foremost conduct of the finest filial child.\n\nWhen the finest disciples receive the Dao and virtue from their masters, mindful of the grace that enabled their growth into adulthood, they remain ever in the company of the wise and gentle, never straying from their ranks. Some attain rank and position to repay their parents; others delve deeply into the savor of the Dao, mastering the art of self-nurturance. All people are born of their parents, attain the completion of Dao and virtue through their masters, and gain honor and esteem from their rulers. Dwelling alone, they ponder how their ruler, master, and father will age, and how to repay them. They constantly strive to seek rare methods and extraordinary texts for their masters, that they may requite their merit. Some further study under the worthy, entrusting their masters to them and speaking on their behalf. Some enable their superiors to become the state’s finest aides, benefiting the emperor’s governance. Such are the noble disciples of the High Antiquity.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns and supreme sages of old overcame others through the utmost Dao and governance by virtue, never by might, severity, cunning, or deceit. Those who overcome others through might, severity, cunning, deceit, and punishment are but bandits and thieves. Bandits and thieves rely solely on these to subdue others—how then do the noble distinguish themselves, making their difference clear and manifest?\n\nThus, rulers of Dao and virtue ever regard severity, might, cunning, and deceit as the conduct of bandits and thieves. The Celestial Master’s writings often speak of the *qi* of the Supreme August and the advent of Great Peace—what does this mean? The sages established laws in accordance with symbolic meaning, abiding in the One and delighting in divination above all. *Divination* means inquiry. To constantly delight in acting above and inquiring without cease is the loftiest path. Thus, the character *shang* (上, \"above\") is a single stroke rising upward with *bu* (卜, \"divination\"); the character *xia* (下, \"below\") is a single stroke descending with *bu*. Constant inquiry and descent lead to the lowest extreme, so those who delight in descending further can no longer ascend.\n\nThe character *huang* (皇, \"august\") means \"to become king in a single day.\" The upper *yi* (一, \"one\") is the number of Heaven; attaining the One, one gains the illumination of the sun, and with great brightness, becomes king. The One and the sun-king combine to form *huang*. The One is Heaven, and Heaven is also the ruler. The sun embodies the ruler’s virtue, and the king is also the ruler’s superior. These three rulers together form *huang*, signifying resplendent virtue, foremost under Heaven, with none above.\n\n*Tai* (太) means \"great,\" signifying accumulation as vast as Heaven, with nothing greater than Heaven. *Ping* (平, \"peace\") means governing with supreme impartiality, ordering all affairs so that none remain unbalanced. It is like the earth, which abides below and upholds equilibrium. It is like sowing and reaping: planting good yields good, planting evil yields evil; toil in cultivation brings a bountiful harvest in return. Heaven’s *qi* delights in descending, Earth’s *qi* delights in ascending; the two *qi* interpenetrate to form the harmonious *qi* of the center, mutually receiving and nurturing the myriad things without harm. Thus is it called *Great Peace*.\n\nWhen the *qi* of Heaven and Earth harmonize as one, they jointly engender the myriad things. When man and woman unite in heart, they bear children. When father, mother, and child unite in heart, they form a household. When ruler, minister, and people unite in heart, they form a state. The emperor is Heaven’s noble child; as a child heeds his father’s teachings, he should act in accordance, alleviating Heaven and Earth’s concerns and thereby gaining their protection. Thus, he constantly strives to act with diligence.\n\nIf celestial patterns do not manifest, it is because the times know order and disorder, and the Dao does not emerge in vain. The emperors of old perceived the subtle and knew the manifest; acting in accordance with the moment and following the *qi*, they attained Heaven’s favor, their intentions ever auspicious. To act contrary brings discord between water and drought, *qi* in conflict and opposition, disasters accumulating into unceasing calamities and prodigies—these are called *portents and anomalies*. The multitude of worthies grow confused, unaware of the Dao of compliance and opposition. Were they to know it, when encountering Great Peace, they would govern with ease; when encountering middling peace, they would act with effort; when encountering disorder, they would rely on the Dao to aid and prepare themselves. It is like preparing for summer at the summer solstice and for winter at the winter solstice—this is the meaning.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven moves in constant cycles; to comply with it brings prosperity and flourishing, to oppose it brings peril and ruin. When the Dao of Heaven contends, its mandate is harmed; when the sun and moon lose their measure, the constellations move in disorder. Those who can employ it act with their own strength, daring not conceal the worthy, illuminating above and below, and enabling all to find peace.\n\nMoxibustion and acupuncture serve to harmonize and pacify the three hundred and sixty meridians, unblocking the *qi* of yin and yang to dispel harm. The three hundred and sixty meridians correspond to the three hundred and sixty days of the year, each meridian governing a day, moving in accordance with the four seasons and five phases, circulating throughout the body, converging within the crown of the head, and striking within the viscera. All respond to the four seasons in their movements; when ill, they fail to conform to their measures, their coming and going losing regularity, sometimes binding, sometimes injuring, sometimes flowing smoothly, sometimes reversing. Thus, they must be treated.\n\nFire is the essence of the Great Yang, the clarity of impartial justice, used to examine treachery and eliminate harm and evil. Acupuncture is the essence of the Lesser Yin, the substance of Venus, used with righteousness to cut and strike. When treatment succeeds in all one hundred cases, or in ten out of ten, this is the celestial canon of meridians and apocrypha; when truly in accord with the meridians, the spirits are commanded. When treatment succeeds in nine out of ten, missing one, and in harmony with the meridians, the essence is commanded. When treatment succeeds in eight out of ten, it is the human canon; human intention commands. Below this, illness cannot be treated, and harm may instead result. To treat the *jia* meridian when the *yi* meridian is afflicted is called *delirium*, failing to recognize the meridian’s solitary injury and severance.\n\nThus, to delight in knowing whether the celestial Dao is spiritually responsive or not is to place a single patient before oneself, naming it the *root text of the meridians*—like the root text of the scriptures and Dao—enabling the multitude of worthies to recognize the illness. Some excel in the upper, some in the lower; the three hundred and sixty meridians each have their insights. Taking the actions in which they commonly excel, the therapeutic methods are recorded: those that succeed in ten out of ten are correct, while all others are not.",

      "translated_text": "Gathering the collective practices of healing and deeming those that cure as scripture ensures that none among the treated remain without resolution. My Dao is like the cyclical progression of *jiazi* and *yichou*, the six *jia* phases succeeding one another, the Five Agents turning in mutual accord, the four seasons revolving to return to their origin. Though the scrolls may be numerous, each has its recordable essence—like the human body, where head and feet serve one another in turn. One word omitted gives rise to another; the worthy follow in succession to lend support. Harmonizing yin and yang in speech, the outer and inner correspond as if by compass and square. At first recitation, it may seem tasteless, but with prolonged reflection and unwavering devotion, verification will come. Disasters depart from the body, spirit returns to gather, and people naturally become prudent and free of malevolence, living without punishment or penalty, while the transformative power of the Dao reaches its utmost beauty.\n\nBy clearly following my text, one averts blame and wards off calamity; calamity ceases of itself, and the people naturally attain longevity. The origin, having never obtained its root, knows no end or beginning. When ten out of ten correspond, it is the scripture of *Taiyang*. When nine out of ten correspond, it is the scripture of *Taiyin*. When eight out of ten correspond, it is the scripture of *Zhonghe*. When seven out of ten correspond, it is the scripture of *Poruination*. When six out of ten correspond, it is the scripture of *Excess*. When five out of ten correspond, it is the scripture of *Ignorance*—this may be called a text of half-fortune and half-misfortune. Fourteen out of ten is a perverse text. Thirteen out of ten is a text of great chaos. Twelve out of ten is an abandoned text. Eleven out of ten is a text of dissipation. From seventeen out of ten downward, it is unusable—a text that misleads people. The extent of harm inflicted will in turn harm the practitioner. Prolonged misuse without cessation violates the law, leading to the extinction of posterity—this is the text of ten out of ten.\n\nThose who delight in attaining its truth need only observe the sacred words of the sages of high antiquity, the sages of middle antiquity, and the sages of later antiquity. By harmonizing their speech and examining their deeds, it can be known. Further, reflect on the Daoist scriptures of high antiquity, middle antiquity, and later antiquity; when the three are united by kindred resonance, it becomes knowable once more. All written texts are the discourse of Heaven—why then do they heal in their time? If one can master their words and rectify their speech, principle is attained; if not rectified, obscurity and chaos ensue. Correct speech and detailed discourse must lead to goodness, while ominous speech and words must bring resentment.\n\nTo attain goodness, one need only rectify the root. When the root is rectified, it aligns with celestial patterns and accords with the sacred words. A second revolution aligns with heavenly principle, a third becomes human culture, and a fourth becomes the myriad things. Yet when the myriad things arise, superficial flourishes lead to chaos and ruin. When celestial patterns emerge, they serve to examine the primordial rectitude of the origin, removing excess and establishing its essence. Clarifying the principles of all texts is the Dao of Heaven. Those who grasp correct speech align with the intent of Heaven. Perversity invites malevolent qi, causing Heaven and Earth to lose their harmony, the myriad things to lose their proper places, and emperors and kings to suffer anxious toil, leading to further disorder. Thus, one must urgently examine and rectify it.\n\nFrom reflection to reflection, from antiquity to the present, all has been fully prepared. The reproaches of spirits and deities are not like those of ordinary people, which can be easily evaded or escaped. By winning the favor of spirits and deities, one can resolve the worries of the world, pacify emperors and kings, and ensure that the myriad things each attain their proper place. I uphold the Three Realities; the qi of *Taiping* arrives, deceit and falsehood depart, and treachery and cunning are extinguished.\n\nThe Perfected One asked: How many great urgencies are there in the world? How many minor urgencies? How many things bring misfortune and calamity yet are not urgent?\n\nThe Divine Person replied: One should refine oneself and speak in full. Generally, what is put to use in the world is urgent; what is not put to use is not urgent.\n\nThe Divine Person said: This appears correct but is not. There are things that must always be urgent and cannot be abandoned; abandoning them would leave the world extinct and devoid of people. Those principles that harmonize and coalesce without name are the great urgencies. Among the world’s great urgencies, there are two; among minor urgencies, there is one. All else is not urgent—it merely wearies the ears and eyes of people, inviting calamity, destroying families, and ruining states. Or it may sever posterity, all from attending to non-urgent affairs and thereby bringing such disasters.\n\nThus, when a person is born and receives their mandate, they partake of the body of Heaven and Earth, embracing primordial qi in spontaneity. Without drinking or eating, they live by inhaling and exhaling the qi of yin and yang, unaware of hunger or thirst. Over time, they drift far from the spiritual Dao and gradually lose their root. Later generations, ignorant of the true Dao, daily drift toward falsity, becoming subject to hunger and thirst. Without drink or food, they die—this is the first great urgency. Heaven and Earth, in their compassion, together produce things that can be consumed. Yet having eaten and drunk, one falls under the governance of yin and yang, subject to transmission, unable to centrally govern the continuity of Heaven and Earth. Transmission should mirror Heaven and Earth: one yin, one yang; one man, one woman—only then can generation continue.\n\nWhen yin reaches its extreme, yang is born; when yang reaches its extreme, yin is born. Yin and yang transmit to one another like cold and heat, a principle of spontaneity. Thus they can generate one another, perpetuating the continuity of Heaven and Earth through the ages. If the continuity of Heaven and Earth is severed, what becomes of husband and wife, father and son, ruler and minister, master and disciple? The one who comprehends the teachings of Heaven assists the emperor in transforming and completing the world. Thus, food and drink and the union of man and woman are mutually necessary—these are the two great urgencies.\n\nClothing is that on which one depends. With clothing, the worthy are born; without it, the unworthy arise. Thus, clothing serves to ward off harm. Therefore, the sagely emperors and enlightened kings of antiquity did not imitate the colors of dark and yellow but merely protected against cold and heat. The continuity of yin and yang in food and drink must not be severed; severing it would leave the world without the Dao of ruler and minister, father and son. Upholding these three, one completes the celestial years, transmits the celestial continuity, and though it ends, it begins anew, without end.\n\nThe sages of antiquity governed by this principle; all else is not urgent but merely invites calamity. Man is Heaven, woman is Earth, and clothing and food are *Zhonghe*. Beyond these three, all else is false and unnecessary for life—indeed, it often brings calamity and treachery, disrupts governance and balance, prevents the arrival of harmonious qi, causes the Dao of Heaven to go awry, and weighs heavily on the concerns of the noble person.",

      "translated_text": "The six passions that delight the heart cannot be restrained by man; yielding to them invites calamity. The noble lose their governance, the petty spawn thoughts of theft and plunder, families perish, and states fall—never has this not arisen from indulgence in what is not urgent. The world grows impoverished, beset by sorrow, suffering, and disasters. Inferiors deceive their superiors, and daily they drift toward extravagance, thus inviting sorrow and suffering, failing to complete their celestial years. This compels the young to ceaseless toil, mountains and rivers are drained, primordial qi is severed, earthly qi weakens, and the nurturing of the myriad things falters. Heaven’s disasters and transformations follow, the people gradually dwindle, and deceit and falsehood arise anew.\n\nSuch is the harm wrought by what is not urgent, yet men seek to please their eyes and ears without awakening to the profound and vast perils. The Perfected One again asked the Divine Person: When a filial son serves his parents, after their passing does he serve them as he did in life? Or is there a difference? To serve them more than in life, or less?\n\nMan is born of his parents, grows to maturity, and when he sees them depart, never to return, he can no longer receive their teachings and admonitions. Yet in his comings and goings, he may still repay them; his thoughts and imaginings cannot cease. To serve them more than in life—is this not excessive?\n\nThe Divine Person replied: Your words are but the filial speech of the common world, not the intent of the Great Dao. Man in life resembles Heaven and belongs to Heaven; man in death resembles Earth and belongs to Earth. Heaven is the father; Earth is the mother. One does not serve the mother more than the father. Life is yang; death is yin. One does not serve yin more than yang. Yang is the Way of the ruler; yin is the Way of the minister. One does not serve the minister more than the ruler. To serve yin more than yang is to cause the qi of yin and yang to rebel, giving rise to disasters. To serve the lesser more than the greater is to cause governance to rebel, inviting great calamity.\n\nWhen yin qi prevails over yang, inferiors deceive their superiors, ghosts and malevolent spirits flourish, and though men walk by day, epidemics never cease. Yang qi is obstructed, the Way of the ruler declines, and the Way of the minister grows strong. Thus, the enlightened emperors and kings of antiquity exalted yang as paramount and humbled yin as their duty.\n\nThe sun is yang; the night is yin. When the sun is long, the night is short; when the night is long, the sun is short. When the sun is abundant, living men thrive; when the night is abundant, ghosts and spirits thrive. Man accompanies the sun; ghosts accompany the stars. The sun is yang; the stars are yin. Thus, when the sun appears, the stars flee; when the stars appear, the sun retreats. When yin prevails, ghosts and spirits bring harm—such is the harm wrought by yin.\n\nIn high antiquity, men governed mourning with sincerity alone, and their funerary rites did not exceed those of life. Human hearts were pure and simple, and illness was rare. In middle antiquity, governance gradually lost its standards, drifting toward extravagance. Resources were exhausted for funerary rites, and sacrifices grew lavish. Ghosts and spirits multiplied, the people suffered frequent epidemics, and malevolent spirits wrought havoc without end. In later antiquity, sacrifices to other spirits flourished, exalting yin. Serving ghosts and spirits harmed the living, ministers usurped the ruler’s authority, women dominated households, warfare erupted violently, deceit and flattery arose daily, and governance decayed. The Way of the ruler was no longer practiced. All this arose from exalting yin over yang, which the Way of Heaven abhors, bringing forth these disasters and misfortunes. Can one not be cautious?\n\nThe Master inscribed the text. The Master said: My name is \"Eleven [with *ming* as the limit].\" *Bingwu* and *dingsi* are the ancestral beginnings. Four mouths govern the principles of the myriad things. The child’s cap uses the corner to enliven its right. The hidden dragon must not be used; *kan* is the record. Those who behold it live long, dwelling [between Heaven and Earth] and nothing more. Governing a million people, one may await immortality. Those who skillfully heal illness must not act recklessly. Rejoicing in the marketplace of Chang’an, one may make men’s lives as long as the Queen Mother of the West, like the four seasons cycling endlessly. The ninety-character text is transmitted to the fangshi.\n\nThe Perfected One asked the Divine Person: I do not yet grasp the meaning and direction of the ninety-character text on life previously bestowed. I wish for a thorough explanation to bequeath to later generations, that it may be preserved and not forgotten.\n\nThe Divine Person replied: I will explain it to you directly. The Master said: My name is \"Eleven, with *ming* as the limit.\" The Master refers to the divine teacher of the August Heaven. *Yue* means \"words.\" I now speak the correct words of Heaven, having been personally sent down to fully expound them to emperors, kings, and the myriad people, resolving the karmic retributions of bearing and shouldering across billions of generations.\n\n*Wu* means \"I,\" the divine messenger urgently dispatched by Heaven. Today, the disasters of bearing and shouldering flow in four directions. From their very roots to their later principles, all lose their governance, with no means to halt or sever them. They harm one another, causing profound calamity, which Heaven regards with grave concern.\n\n*Zi* refers to the characters now arrayed in the celestial text, accumulated in writing. *Shi* means that the text and the celestial truth are sincere and aligned, tenfold without error, not a single deception. Those who obtain it and are wise will deeply reflect: their ancestors all bore karmic burdens. If these are not halted, the misfortunes of bearing and shouldering, great and small, will all be removed.\n\n*Yi* is the essential principle, the correct path to begin with guarding the One. Guarding the One without cease, one’s brightness grows daily, and Heaven’s confusion is dispelled. *Ming* is the limit; the limit is sufficiency. Sufficiency means that for those who practice this Way, each day brings benefit, shining brightly, no longer shrouded in darkness and ignorance.\n\n*Shiyi* is the scholar. *Ming* as the limit is red. Red qi refers to this, which will again flourish in great brightness. The limit is the sufficiency of the myriad things. When the myriad things first sprout, they straighten their roots to grow from their foundation. Practicing this Way, its method returns to the primordial qi, attaining the heart of Heaven and Earth. It is the first and finest, governance that accords with the Way of the Supreme Sovereign.\n\n*Bingwu* and *dingsi* are fire, red.",
      "overlap_context": "ty, and though it ends, it begins anew, without end.\n\nThe sages of antiquity governed by this principle; all else is not urgent but merely invites calamity. Man is Heaven, woman is Earth, and clothing and food are *Zhonghe*. Beyond these three, all else is false and unnecessary for life—indeed, it often brings calamity and treachery, disrupts governance and balance, prevents the arrival of harmonious qi, causes the Dao of Heaven to go awry, and weighs heavily on the concerns of the noble person.",

      "translated_text": "The *bingwu* day is pure yang; the *dingsi* day is pure yin. Yin and yang govern harmony, and when yang qi returns to harmonious union, all under Heaven accords with it. Those who act do so for the benefit of emperors and kings; yin brings misfortune and harm.\n\nThe *zu* is the ancestor, the first, symbolizing the virtue of the Three Sovereigns. The *shi* is the return to the original beginning. Practicing this Way is to revert to the transformation of the Three Sovereigns above.\n\nFour mouths govern the ordering of the myriad things. \"Four and obtaining the mouth\" refers to speech. All who daily recite my writings will obtain the celestial orthodox script and characters. When their aspirations align, they unite with the heart of Heaven, enabling the myriad things to each find their proper place without further disorder—hence the ordering of the myriad things.\n\nThe child’s headband uses horn to govern the right: this is recitation. Reciting this scripture without cease, all matters will suddenly be rectified. Above, one gains the heart of Heaven, ever joyful, without further betrayal.\n\nThe *qianlong* does not act; *kan* serves as the guiding principle. The *qianlong* is Heaven’s yang qi, returning to the initial nine, the *jiazi* year’s winter solstice day, when Heaven and Earth first arise. The dragon is the lesser yang of the east, the spirit of wood. Thus, the Dao of Heaven follows wood to generate the fire phase. When things are about to flourish, they must first open their gates and doors.\n\nWhen the true person reaches the appointed month, they should reveal this scripture in a place of luminous clarity. *Kai* means to open, to make unimpeded. Opening to the south further purifies and expands the yang qi, dissolving the accumulated misfortunes of *chengfu*. *Qian* means to conceal. The Dao, having reached its destination, returns to hiddenness. *Wu yong* means \"do not dare\" or \"not yet.\" Those who first see the text do not yet know how to practice it. *Yong* means to govern, to act.\n\nToday, this scripture should be used to eliminate disasters. In the *xuanjia* year, it should be employed, yet at that time, rulers may not deeply grasp its meaning and thus fail to apply it. Hence, \"do not act\" means that Heaven does not yet dare to entrust sole faith in it for immediate implementation. Those who believe and apply it will see affairs respond like an echo, serving as clear proof that it accords with the Dao of Heaven.\n\n*Kan* as the guiding principle refers to *zi* as *kan*. *Jia* is Heaven’s guiding rope, the rope being yang. *Kan* is water, yin, the guiding principle. Thus, Heaven and Earth constantly unite their guiding ropes and principles. In the initial *xuanjiazi*, this scripture emerges for virtuous rulers to govern and transform, establishing guiding principles—hence *kan* as the guiding principle.\n\nThis is the scripture of the Supreme Sovereign above, revealed for virtuous rulers below as the true canon to sever evil. With *xuanjia* as the beginning and *zi* as the root, it is thus arranged in sequence by *jiazi*. Those who obtain and see it will enjoy long life.\n\nThe *ren zheng* refers to the human ruler, the singular emperor or king. Those of superior virtue easily awaken and know to practice the scripture of the Way. Relying on auspicious signs, they do not doubt the Dao of Heaven. Deeply grasping its meaning, they attain longevity, fulfilling their destined lifespan.\n\n*Chang* means boundless; *jiu* means to endure, to dwell between Heaven and Earth and live. Dwelling between Heaven and Earth, one should study the true Dao. Florid and ornate writings cannot grant enduring life. All the accumulated misfortunes of *chengfu* stem from the lack of a substantive Dao—today, these are severed.\n\nGoverning the myriad people, immortality may be awaited, for its principle is correct. Heaven uses this scripture to rectify the hearts of all worthies, each ordering their illnesses, guarding the true and expelling the false. \"Immortality may be awaited\" means that when all under Heaven hear of the true Dao, they will swiftly and entirely cast off [falsehoods], aiding the virtuous ruler in governing with the true Dao to enliven people—hence immortality may be awaited.\n\nThose who skillfully govern illness must not deceive or endanger. All people are foolish, neglecting the spirits of their bodies and indulging in deceptive and false writings. Without cause, they endanger themselves, incurring Heaven’s severe punishment and bearing the great responsibility of *chengfu*. Thus, Heaven causes them to abandon florid writings and each guard the true and real, preserving their daily efforts to practice, ensuring lasting benefit without further deception or peril.\n\n\"Joy in the marketplace of Chang’an.\" Joy is the supreme joy when the qi of the Supreme Sovereign’s Great Peace arrives. Alas! Its virtue is vast and unmatched. *Chang* means that practicing this Way, one’s virtue is good and boundless. *An* means no further peril or ruin. Those who practice this Way will see the obligations of *chengfu* between Heaven and Earth entirely dispelled, achieving lasting peace, vast and unburdened, without further sorrow.\n\nThe *shi* (marketplace) is where Heaven gathers people together. Practicing this scripture, the nation’s people will flourish like those in a bustling city. \"Enabling longevity like the Queen Mother of the West\" means enabling people—referring to emperors and kings of great virtue who delight in practicing the correct writings. *Ruo* means to follow. Those who greatly follow my writings will align with the Dao of Heaven, attaining great fortune without misfortune.\n\n*Xi* (west) means that all people nest the true Dao in their hearts. *Wang* (king) means that the emperor, practicing the Dao of Heaven, will greatly prosper and reign. Its principle is good, supreme. *Mu* (mother) is the proof of longevity, the elder of spirits. It is like the four seasons returning to their beginning.\n\n*Bi* (comparison) is like the transmission of the four seasons, mutually generating and completing one another without further harm. Its principle is without punishment. Ninety-character strategies are transmitted to the *fangshi*.\n\nNine is the ultimate; practicing this Way, one’s virtue ultimately harmonizes with the heart of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, and the myriad things. Ten is the mutual resonance of tens, without contrived writings. *Zi* (characters) refers to the celestial writings above and below, circulating and pervading the Dao to completion. *Chuan* (transmission) means trust; thus, writings are made to preserve the talismanic trust and transmit it.\n\n*Fang* is great rectitude. Holding this Way and hastening to entrust it to a virtuous ruler can dispel the misfortunes of *chengfu*, and its principle will achieve great rectitude.",

      "translated_text": "The *shi* (士) refers to those of unwavering resolve and singular purpose. Such individuals of singular purpose possess upright hearts and are receptive to teaching and instruction; sending them to transmit this Way, the efficacy of my strategies shall become manifest.\n\nHeaven admonishes through celestial writings. When Heaven offers minor admonitions, its countenance alters; when major admonitions arise, Heaven trembles and splits. If its admonitions go unheeded, destruction follows. The Three Luminaries—when minor admonitions occur, minor affairs cause the stars to change hue; when major admonitions arise, the Three Luminaries lose their proper measure and dim. If unheeded, destruction follows. Earth—when minor admonitions occur, it quakes and sways; when major admonitions arise, the land collapses and the earth splits. If unheeded, destruction follows. The Five Phases—when minor admonitions occur, disasters arise; when major admonitions arise, the Wood Phase brings insects that kill people, the Fire Phase brings poison that kills people, the Metal Phase brings tigers and wolves that kill people, the Water Phase brings aquatic creatures that kill people, and the Earth Phase brings officials and commoners to cruelly harm and kill one another. If unheeded, destruction follows. The Four Seasons—when minor admonitions occur, cold and heat fall out of balance; when major admonitions arise, cold and heat reverse their positions, and the seasons lose all proper order. If unheeded, destruction follows. The thirty-six *jingqi*—when minor admonitions arise together, disorder erupts, and pests emerge, some flying, some crawling; clouds and winds multiply yet bring no rain, leaving emptiness without substance. When major admonitions arise, floods and droughts lose all measure, killing and harming the myriad things and the people. If unheeded, destruction follows. Flying and crawling creatures—when minor admonitions occur, they harm people; when major admonitions arise, birds and beasts devour people, and locusts swarm in great numbers. If unheeded, destruction follows. Ghosts, spirits, and numinous beings—when minor admonitions occur, they rise up to afflict and sicken the people; when major admonitions arise, they bring execution and the extermination of entire households. If unheeded, destruction follows. The Six Directions—when minor admonitions occur, winds and rains erupt in chaos, raging and venomous, harming the people. When major admonitions arise, they impose tyranny beyond reason, causing stones to fly from the earth, shaking the pillars of Heaven, shattering houses, and moving mountains and hills. If unheeded, destruction follows. The voices of Heaven and Earth—when minor admonitions occur, thunder and lightning grow slightly fierce; when major admonitions arise, thunderbolts strike repeatedly. If unheeded, destruction follows. Officials and commoners—when minor admonitions occur, their countenances change; when major admonitions arise, they inflict much harm and violence. If unheeded, destruction follows.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth and the Six Directions of the Eight Extremities all issue major admonitions, seeking rectification, the writings of the Yellow River and Luo River emerge. Heaven’s luminosity bears witness to the world, and the *Ruiying Shu* (Record of Auspicious Responses) appears to admonish and rectify the ruler. The world responds in unison; if unheeded, destruction follows.\n\nThe cycles of the celestial Dao converge when their time arrives, and the sequence resumes in due order. Thus, the sages and worthies of antiquity pondered day and night without dare of slackening. Losing even a hair’s breadth, they perceived the subtle and knew the manifest, never straying from the heart of August Heaven. Therefore, they preserved their persons, pacified their people, nourished the myriad things, and knew no peril or destruction. Calamities and misfortunes could not approach, for their plans and calculations aligned with the intent of Heaven.\n\nWhat Heaven aids, it aids those who are easy to instruct, those of utmost sincerity, those who are reverent and compliant, those who are easy to enlighten, and those who are vigilant. Heaven’s favor toward emperors and kings is most profound. Yet when myriad errors and changes accumulate to this point, and its teachings go unheeded, it abandons them to their fate. The spirits of Heaven and Earth no longer offer admonitions for rectification. Disasters and anomalies increase daily, the people dwindle and decline, and their proper roles are lost.\n\nThe sagely emperors and enlightened kings of antiquity, from dawn to dusk, governed with effortless grace. They deeply pondered and examined the heart of Heaven, never daring to stray from it. Thus, they served August Heaven as a father, August Earth as a mother, the sun as an elder brother, and the moon as an elder sister.

      "translated_text": "All things cherish the qi of yin and yang. It is like fish that cannot traverse high mountains, yet when water is present, they may depart regardless of height or depth. Great trees cannot rise without bounds—they grow within rivers and seas.\n\nThus, the sage-kings of antiquity, in receiving their charge, took from the five soils what was fitting for each. Their creatures thrived in goodness and excellence, flourishing abundantly, and the state grew rich. Now, ancestral temples offer sumptuous feasts, and all under Heaven is at peace, free from suffering. Malign qi ceases, no longer moving to cause harm.\n\nIf one does not examine the land before planting, the myriad things will not complete their natural spans but perish prematurely. Grievances remain unresolved, leading to untimely ends, which move August Heaven above. The harvest fails, the state falls into dire poverty, food lacks savor, ancestral temples hunger and thirst, all under Heaven is mired in sorrow, and the people turn to mutual harm. Rulers and ministers deceive one another, inner and outer realms speak in discordant tongues. The fault arises precisely here—this is the root of great harm, the path to peril and ruin.\n\nThose who obtain this text and read it often suffer from not mastering it. Those who master it perceive its meaning with their eyes, yet if they do not deeply ponder its intent, if they do not study it with precision, even possessing this text brings no benefit. To obtain it and not exert oneself in practice—how does this differ from not obtaining it at all? To see food and not eat—how is this different from having no grain? To see broth and not drink—can thirst be quenched? This is not to grieve for others but to harm oneself. Can one not reflect carefully?\n\nThus, the sage exerts effort in thought, the noble person in study, day and night without ceasing. They delight in emulating Heaven’s ceaseless revolution, as the hundred rivers flow and gather to form the great seas.\n\nTake heed of my words.\n\nHeaven’s affairs each follow their own laws. Decrees may be assigned, the Dao may be enacted, yet their emergence may come sooner or later, their signs gradually appearing. It is like the myriad things: they first sprout in *zi*, grow in *mao*, branch in *wu*, mature in *you*, and conclude in *hai*. Though their signs may be foreseen, their outcome cannot be assured.\n\nEach matter has its proper time for action. When its light and shadow are first glimpsed, though the event has not yet arrived, its path may be prepared in advance. Heaven’s portents always appear ahead, never trailing behind. When the right person is found, the way is opened; those who see and are aided by it succeed. If one does not comprehend this and acts without success, it is because the person is not the right one.\n\nThus, this serves as clear proof. The Dao is examined and spoken of, and in ten thousand cases, not one is lost. If the person is right, the way is opened for them; if not, it remains closed. When the right person is found, illnesses may be dispelled, disasters and anomalies vanish of themselves, and the barbarians submit without need of arms—they all fade away on their own.\n\nAll things have their proper arrangements and deployments. With the right person, they proceed naturally; without, they withdraw. In all matters, if the right person is not found, one must not force action. One must not forcibly take what is not one’s friend, nor forcibly plant what is not suited to the land—what is planted will not grow. If words are not good, if the inner does not find its proper place, how can it endure?\n\nThe six extremes and eight directions each have their fitting uses. Their creatures all manifest, yet each matter differs. The great person who obtains this uses it to pacify the state; the middling person becomes a worthy minister; the petty person uses it to preserve themselves.\n\nResponding to Heaven’s principles, harmonizing above and below, calamities are dispelled, treachery and deceit are severed, and the roots of ominous texts are cut off.\n\nThe people of high antiquity all had hearts that were open, eyes that were bright, and ears that were clear. They foresaw what had not yet come to pass, deeply contemplating the future, moving even the unresponsive. Their distinction was self-evident, and no undertaking of theirs failed. What they spoke and taught was always steadfast and penetrating. They did not lose the heart of August Emptiness, yearning for the boundless wisdom and words of the boundless.\n\nThey knew the lengthening and shortening of human lifespans, each having its allotted portion. They constantly harmonized yin and yang to grasp their waxing and waning, taking the essential from above, below, and the center. They made covenants with the multitude of spirits, yet none dared transgress the great taboos of Heaven and Earth. What they revered and obtained accorded with Heaven’s will, and documents were submitted upward to the Heavenly Sovereign.\n\nWhen the Heavenly Sovereign received the documents and saw their self-imposed restraints clearly delineated, only then were decrees issued, preventing self-reproach. The upright advanced of themselves, their voices heard without report, resounding clearly above and below. Laws and regulations never missed their appointed times. Fearing they might fall short, they never failed to reproach themselves. Constantly wary of faults, they were overseen by recording spirits who reported them. They never slackened, and when faults were seen, they were demoted and replaced.\n\nThus, they repeatedly admonished themselves, reiterating their words to ensure they did not deviate from what was said. This is what Heaven expects to be revered, what the gods and spirits look up to—all must follow the law without ceasing, ever fearful of failing to reach their mark. What they received was not uniform, yet all required an open heart and mind, lest they miss their appointed time.\n\nSpirits have their ranks, high and low, and serve one another. If they do not act as spoken, they are promptly recorded and set apart. Their hearts are filled with sorrow, ever as if starving and thirsting for food.\n\nWhen the Heavenly Sovereign speaks, the decrees are issued accordingly, appointing overseers. The documents are not few, and one must grasp their intent, for each has its own reliability.\n\nThe people of high antiquity, in matters of gain and loss, observed the inner and outer, above and below, gazing to the four directions and beyond the four corners. They saw the guiding principles, as months and years advanced, and spiritual communications renewed. What limit was there to this?\n\nThe degrees of the stars each have their principles, never shifting. Matters follow one another in succession, with no room for doubt. All knew the origins of fortune and misfortune, thus establishing the calendar and its records.\n\nThree hundred and sixty days, with both major and minor reckonings, were held without missing the smallest fraction—this was the short month. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter each had their proper principles. The clepsydra’s rise and fall, the water’s swiftness or slowness, the division between new and old—all were made known, never missing by even a fraction.\n\nEach month was set in place, with the twenty-four solar terms. The arrows before and after numbered seven or eight terms, as did the long days. These were used to enter and exit the sacrifices to the gods of Heaven and Earth, enabling the hundred officials to follow the clepsydra’s marks. If the appointed times were missed, the failure to respond incurred multiple offenses.",

      "translated_text": "Thus the division of day and night followed the lengthening and shortening of days, with one hundred marks as the cycle, never allowing the slightest deviation. In a state of virtue, the days grew longer and the water flowed more slowly, each inch precisely corresponding to the regulated measure. Yet in many states today, this is not observed—the days and months are slightly shorter, with each mark reduced to eight or nine parts. Thus the elderly, whose years should be weak, paradoxically grow robust, while their lifespans naturally diminish. How can they endure for long? If a state has many ministers, the pivot and balance of governance move sluggishly. The young may enjoy fleeting fortune, barely drawing breath, yet even without overt wrongdoing, they will face retribution.\n\nThe radiance of Heaven and Earth resides in the south, where *sì* and *wǔ* hours share a single domain, and *lí* serves as the true eye. In the affairs of the Hall of Light, the sun shines from south to north, the advance and retreat of *yang* qi never straying from its constant course. As *yin* and *yang* press upon one another, reaching toward the *zǐ* direction, cold and warmth align in perfect accord, their illumination penetrating all naturally—most delightful indeed.\n\nThe Way of nurturing life lies in the interplay of lesser *yang* and greater *yang*, where wood and fire flourish in mutual glory, each attaining its desire. What conflict could arise? Inner and outer harmonize in succession, without misnaming anything. Above, it extends to the imperial radiance; below, to the realm of silence. In tranquil spontaneity, the myriad things bloom in splendor, all clearly discernible. Without effort, it achieves completion—this is what Heaven reveres. Those who receive its name are guided by the pivot and balance, where life and death have their appointed times. The Registrar of Destinies upholds the ledgers, the records of fate flowing unimpeded, never failing to summon in response.\n\nWhen seeking something, the spirit-led registers verify the truth before ascending to the Heavenly Lord, who presides over all. The spirits who report do not stray from his side, and both within and without, they are revered. They dare not act on private whim, ensuring that all ascents and descents occur without missing their proper time. The officials of greater *yin* dare not slacken, diligently tending the gates and chambers of the celestial bureaus. Fearful of speaking out of turn, they instead support one another in goodness and essential ways, recording names on memorials. Once instructed, they act without deviating by even a fraction.\n\nIn ancient times, sages of profound wisdom perceived all without obstruction, their vision unhindered. Receiving the Way of spirit illumination, they understood it clearly, for it possessed its own laws, never straying from constancy. From the *Tàichū* era onward, calendars have varied in length, profound and subtly wondrous. From antiquity to the present, the essence of calendrical systems lies in their establishment and completion. Through mental calculation and observation, all that is accomplished below aligns with the work above, the numbers corresponding like a plumb line. Years, months, and days are tallied, their great divisions accounted for.\n\nNow Heaven and Earth rejoice in abundant years, and the emperor should sit in tranquil rule, free from care. The people need only wander at leisure, with few duties, while the five grains no longer command their former value, their worth unmeasured. The world engages in brewing fine wine to share in drink, and market roads flourish to excess—this is called the \"Water Decree,\" yet the conduct of fire harms the transformation of *yang*.\n\nWhen a person drinks even one measure of wine and becomes drunk, wild pulses arise. Trade and duties are neglected, leading to brawls and deaths. Some are wounded or robbed; others arrive at the market early only to return belatedly. Some fall prey to villains, or tumble from heights, or are struck by carts and horses. The harms of wine are manifold, beyond counting. Consider the markets across the Four Seas—how much grain is consumed in a single month? Hundreds of millions of *dǒu* and *hú* vanish, while senseless killings occur daily.\n\nSome are left childless, their lineages severed. Others incur the enmity of parents, who plot harm. Still others bring calamity upon their descendants. Local officials and magistrates cannot resolve these matters, beating their chests and crying to Heaven, moving the imperial spirits. This disrupts the *qi* of *yin*, *yang*, the four seasons, and the five phases, reversing the governance of the August Emperor of Great Peace and causing the *qi* of Great Harmony to flow contrary to its course.\n\nAll this stems from needlessly compelling the people to brew wine, wasting the five grains and inviting such disasters. If a virtuous ruler were to issue clear commands, declaring to officials and people: \"From this day forward, anyone who dares to sell or drink even one *dǒu* of wine without cause shall receive thirty strokes of the cane and three days of penal labor. For two *dǒu*, sixty strokes and six days; for three *dǒu*, ninety strokes and nine days.\" The duration of penal labor should correspond to the measure of wine consumed, and wine-sellers shall be subject to the same. All shall be made to repair city walls, roads, and government buildings—this is the great work of earth.\n\nEarth overcomes water, suppressing and extinguishing its excess, preventing water from harming *yang* beyond measure. Water is greater *yin*, the people; if it prevails, it will injure the king and deplete the essence of *yang*—the harm is profound. Repairing roads fosters the flourishing of the great Way, with like influencing like, gradually establishing Great Peace.\n\nExamining the myriad things of Heaven and Earth, *yin* and *yang*, above and below, they govern and nurture one another in mutual affection. Establishing merit and achieving renown, one’s heart governs a single household, so that people no longer harbor hatred but instead delight in unity of purpose. The *qi* of Great Harmony will emerge daily, bringing great peace. The Six Directions will share one heart, the Eight Regions one plan. Where governance aligns with human intent, all will respond with joy.\n\nThis is the primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth, uniting the positions of *yin* and *yang*. Wickedness and perversity will silently vanish, the rebellious will all submit, and the great and numinous Way will be revealed—the spirits and deities will cherish it. I now ascend to expound the Dao and virtue to August Heaven, descend to distinguish the measures of mountains and rivers, and establish laws for emperors and kings. The worthy among them will cultivate good intentions.\n\nThus I resolve the great grievances of Heaven and Earth, freeing the emperor from sorrow and toil. The people will love one another, and all things will find their proper place. The constant laws of Heaven remain unhidden. In ancient times, sagely emperors and enlightened kings valued great ministers, cherished recluses, benefited the people, and refrained from harm. Ministers, in turn, were loyal and trustworthy, never deceiving their ruler—thus their governance was divine.\n\nA wise father constantly seeks to bring peace to his son, and the son constantly seeks to bring joy to his father. When the two join forces with one heart, no household matter remains unaccomplished. But if they do not unite in purpose, the family’s Way falls into chaos. Duties are neglected, leaving them destitute and impoverished. Strife and division arise, leading to mutual harm. Even flesh and blood, born of the same body and bound as limbs, turn against one another—how much more so when gathering people of different surnames to serve as ruler, teacher, and father?",

      "translated_text": "Thus the sage perceives the subtle and knows the manifest, and therefore places great emphasis on caution and vigilance.\n\nThe teacher is yang, loving his disciples and guiding them with the virtuous Way, so they understand to revere Heaven and cherish Earth, honor their superiors and benefit their inferiors. The disciples, in turn, respectfully serve their teacher with obedience, diligence, loyalty, and trustworthiness. When the two join forces with one heart, they study the ancient laws and institutions of past and present, practice the words of the sages, clarify the boundaries of Heaven and Earth, and govern the myriad things, allowing each to find its proper place. Accumulating virtue without cease, they become the worthy assistants of emperors and kings, joining in counsel to together bring about Great Peace.\n\nIf they do not unite in strength and purpose, failing to transmit the essential Way, but instead pursue superficial and external words, deceiving one another and endangering themselves, they defy Heaven’s principles of order, disrupt the words of the sages, and leave the Six Extremes indistinct—becoming a great calamity for the world. If emperors and kings follow such teachers, they lose the principles of governance, turning instead to become the great enemies of Heaven and Earth, failing to receive the intent of the divine spirits. This is the greatest harm to the world.\n\nHuman life is endowed with both yin and yang; movement and stillness, anger and joy all have their proper times. When the time for the union of male and female has not yet come, it is the duty of yin and yang to govern the effects of generation. The Way of Heaven is completed through threefold union; thus a child walks at three years, and three times three makes nine, bringing the harmonious Way to fulfillment. Before knowing the union of male and female, the timely thoughts within cannot yet be expressed.\n\nThe number of Heaven is five, the number of Earth is five, and the number of humanity is five. Three fives make fifteen, and the internal qi stirs. Four fives make twenty, aligning with the qi of the four seasons to express desire. The four seasons govern generation, and thus desire seeks to generate. Five fives make twenty-five, and the qi of the Five Phases is sufficient to bear expression. Five sixes make thirty, and strength is attained. Thus Heaven causes constant thoughts of expression to circulate the continuity of Heaven and Earth, to propagate kind, and to meet at thirty years before exemption. In old age, one declines; the young cease to engage in inner chambers.\n\nAll creatures that crawl upon the earth are but reflections of Heaven and Earth; the rest cannot do so. Thus, in one day and one night, Heaven and Earth together nurture twelve thousand things, bringing them all to life. Night is deep—this is yin; day is dry—this is yang. Each day, Heaven and Earth together nourish these twelve thousand things to completeness. The law of Heaven is that yang unites with essence to become rain, yang’s expression descending into the earth to join with it, together generating the twelve thousand things. Of these, two thousand are auspicious and virtuous beings.\n\nThe twelve thousand things each possess their own spirit and have their own rulers. They must follow a single great Way to achieve free flow. The Way of Heaven moves above and below, all going to pay homage to their ruler—just as people following a single great Way go to pay homage to their king. The spirits of the twelve thousand things, born together with Heaven and Earth, emerge along a single great Way, some great, some medium, some small.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that among the twelve thousand things, there are great and small, and their Ways are likewise great and small, each generating, containing, and moving in its own manner. Thus, the upper Way spans ten thousand paces as its measure; the next spans a thousand paces; the next, a hundred paces; the next, ten paces; and the next, one pace. Altogether, five Ways correspond to the five directions. They should together descend to generate upon the earth, together ascend to pay homage to Heaven, and together follow a single Way.\n\nTherefore, the great Way spans ten thousand paces, containing the middle Way of a thousand paces, the small Way of a hundred paces, the fine Way of ten paces, and the minute Way of one pace. Things have their greatness and smallness, each containing their own coming and going. All receive Heaven’s expression above and in turn generate below to express upon the earth, emerging to together ascend and pay homage to Heaven.\n\nThus, the great Way may be extended but must not be recklessly closed, for closing it will prevent mutual containment. Some will fail to be born, or be injured and die, unable to emerge—causing people to be cut off without descendants. The injured injure others; the dead kill others. The sages of antiquity dared not abolish or sever the great Way, for they clearly saw Heaven’s prohibitions.\n\nBy what Way of Heaven can one be harmed? The Way is Heaven, is yang, and governs generation. Virtue is Earth, is yin, and governs nurturance. If many things cannot be born, it is known that the Way of Heaven is harmed. Where there is failure to generate, it is known that Heaven’s continuity has been severed. If one thing fails to be born, one continuity is cut off; many failures mean many cut-offs, few mean few. By the number of things, one knows the harm to Heaven’s continuity.\n\nWhen the Way flourishes, it governs generation, and the myriad things all live. When virtue flourishes, it governs nurturance, and the myriad things and people are all nourished, without grievances. Among the five writings, the virtuous are made to use blue for the base and red for the characters. Why? Our Way is the true record of red and blue. Blue represents life, benevolence, and having a heart; red is the true color of the Great Yang of Heaven. Our Way is the Way of Great Yang, the Way of benevolent governance, desiring no harm.\n\nThe Son of Heaven is the heart of Heaven; the Empress is the heart of Earth. The heart governs and upholds correctness. Heaven covers all without exception, generates all without distinction of great or small—all receive the mandate to live, and thus it is Heaven. Heaven is the true essence of the ultimate Way, never deceiving people. All things should be cherished and loved; their intentions should accumulate sincerity and trust, always desiring to benefit and not harm, never betraying a single thing—thus it is Heaven.\n\nThe emperor and king are the children of Heaven and the leaders of humanity; their conduct should reflect this. The son should receive his father’s teachings, commands, and strict instructions, following them accordingly. Only then will his actions align with his father’s will and intentions, and he may become a good family. If he does not receive his father’s teachings, his family—great and small—will not be governed, and it will become impoverished. Wealth will scatter in all four directions, constantly suffering from inability to gather. Affairs will be chaotic, disasters will arise in succession, and great sorrow will follow—all faults lie here.\n\nWhen the emperors and kings of antiquity were about to act, they first looked up to Heaven, receiving its teachings in their hearts before proceeding.",

      "translated_text": "The conduct of the empress should rightly mirror that of the earth. The earth bears all without exception, gathering both great and small, encompassing all without distinction of good or evil, nurturing them all. The empress is the child of the earth, the heart of the earth. As the heart worries over all matters, the child should emulate her mother’s conduct—if her actions resemble her mother’s, she is a filial child.\n\nThe correspondence between Heaven and Earth and the empress is like that of echo and sound: if her deviation is slight, the consequences are slight; if great, the consequences are great. Even a hair’s breadth of misalignment will leave mother and child at odds in will and intent. In antiquity, when an empress was about to act, she first contemplated the Earth Deity, embracing all without exception in her nurturance. Nothing was beyond her forbearance, nothing lacked constancy; thus she found peace, aligning her heart with the earth’s.\n\nIf she errs, disasters will arise in succession, punishments will go unchecked, yin will prevail over yang, and the myriad things will fail to flourish—all faults lie here.\n\nWhen these two—emperor and empress—govern rightly, the divine immortals appear, the true Dao emerges, the worthy and wise occupy their rightful places, and all good things gather in the realm.\n\nQi in its primordial state is yang and governs generation. Spontaneous transformation is yin and governs the nurturance of all things. Heaven is yang and governs generation; Earth is yin and governs nurturance. The sun and daylight are yang and govern generation; the moon, stars, and night are yin and govern nurturance. Spring and summer are yang and govern generation; autumn and winter are yin and govern nurturance. The celestial stems *jia*, *bing*, *wu*, *geng*, and *ren* are yang and govern generation; *yi*, *ding*, *ji*, *xin*, and *gui* are yin and govern nurturance. The earthly branches *zi*, *yin*, *chen*, *wu*, *shen*, and *xu* are yang and govern generation; *chou*, *mao*, *si*, *wei*, *you*, and *hai* are yin and govern nurturance. All nines are yang and govern generation; all sixes are yin and govern nurturance. Men are yang and govern generation; women are yin and govern the nurturance of all things. The male is yang and governs generation; the female is yin and governs nurturance. The ruler is yang and governs generation; the minister is yin and governs nurturance.\n\nAll things under Heaven consist of one yin and one yang, only then can they generate and nurture one another. If yang does not bestow generation, yin becomes empty and void, with nothing to nurture. If yin does not receive transformation, yang has nothing to bestow. Generation is governance; when yang qi governs alone, cut off and obstructed, it becomes Heaven’s great resentment. If yin does not receive transformation, failing to generate and bring forth, it becomes a grave fault.\n\nHeaven’s resentment lies in yang’s reluctance to bestow, leaving nothing to generate, instead favoring destruction and harm to life. Earth’s fault lies in yin’s unwillingness to receive transformation, failing to bring forth and nurture growth, thereby faulting others and harming what should be nurtured. Heaven that does not send timely rain is a malevolent and inauspicious Heaven. Earth that does not nurture the myriad things is a malevolent and inauspicious Earth. A man who does not bestow generation severs Heaven’s governance. A woman who does not receive transformation severs Earth’s governance. The Dao of yin and yang, cut off and without posterity, is a great inauspiciousness—like Heaven and Earth suddenly destroyed, never to exist again.\n\nThus the sage values the essential patterns of Heaven. Heaven is the essence of all Dao. The worthy value the Dao, hence they follow the sage. The worthy enter the true Dao, hence they follow the immortal. Those who know how to become immortals must be true, hence they follow the true. Those who know the true must attain the divine. The divine share form and principle with Heaven above, hence Heaven is called divine, for it can command the divine.\n\nThe divine are the officers of August Heaven. The divine person is the foremost heart of August Heaven. The nature of Heaven and Earth is that the pure governs the turbid; the turbid cannot govern the pure. Radiant essence is the heart of the myriad things. Those who govern with clarity use their hearts to discern matters, employing pure brightness.\n\nNow, what do the divine person, true person, immortal, Daoist, sage, worthy, commoner, and servant each resemble?\n\nThe divine person resembles Heaven, which moves and illuminates all without ignorance. The true person resembles Earth, which is upright, utterly sincere, and never deceitful. Heaven merely follows what people sow, never altering it. The immortal resembles the four seasons, which transform all things without fixed form, now flourishing, now declining. The Daoist resembles the five phases, which can divine fortune and misfortune, excelling in discerning safety and danger. The sage resembles yin and yang, which model themselves on Heaven and Earth to govern affairs, harmonizing the myriad things. The sage, too, should harmonize all things, fulfilling Heaven’s will and following yin and yang in action. The worthy resemble mountains and rivers, which convey qi and reach distant lands; the worthy, too, should enable the emperor to connect with the six directions. The common people resemble the myriad things, which grow without regard to high or low, all inhabited by people, hence they resemble the myriad things. Servants arise in degenerate ages, resembling the weak and submissive among grasses and trees, always dwelling in the lower currents, unable to rise. Servants, too, dwell below and cannot rise, hence they resemble grasses and trees.\n\nThus, if a servant is worthy, they may become a good person; if a good person studies diligently, they may become a worthy; if a worthy studies without cease, they may approach the sage; if a sage studies without cease, knowing the gateways of Heaven’s Dao, and enters the Dao without ceasing, they may accomplish the work of immortality and become an immortal. If an immortal does not cease in entering the true, they may become a true person; if a true person does not cease in entering the divine, they may become divine; if the divine do not cease, they may share form with August Heaven.\n\nThus the supreme divine person dwells in the Purple Palace of the North Pole, sharing form with the Heavenly Thearch, named the Heart-Mind Spirit of Heaven. If the divine do not cease, they may ascend beyond Heaven, receiving and transmitting qi, possessing voice yet no form, belonging to the realm above Heaven, attending to its affairs.\n\nThose from the divine person downward all attend to matters within the six directions of Heaven and Earth, harmonizing all to prevent suffering.\n\nI wish to hear: among the vast and boundless six directions between Heaven and Earth, what is most excellent? Among the thirty-six thousand realms between Heaven and Earth, longevity is the greatest excellence.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, Heaven is foremost, Earth follows, then the divine person, the perfected person, the immortal, the Daoist, the sage, and the worthy. These eight all harmonize with the Heart-Mind of August Heaven, sharing its will and joining its power—all are Heavenly persons.\n\nHeaven desires governance, and within its domain, each is appointed to their office. Thus, their thoughts and concerns ever align, for these are the people Heaven cherishes and nurtures. Heaven, in its greatness, covets longevity and eternal life. Immortals, too, covet longevity and life; those who covet life dare not transgress, each calculating for their own preservation.\n\nHeaven’s laws manifest in celestial signs, which the sages of antiquity constantly emulated, never daring to deviate. Thus, they suppressed misfortune, severed cunning, and prevented treacherous ministers from acting—all by adhering to Heaven’s laws. To ensure yang qi daily flourishes, fire blazes brightly, and knows no decline, one must swiftly sever the dominance of metal qi and prevent its ascendancy. When metal qi is cut off, wood qi reigns, fire qi blazes brightly, and knows no decline.\n\nWhat does this mean? The Heavenly Lord must abolish warfare. Warfare belongs to the class of metal; thus, it must be swiftly abolished. When emperors and kings bestow weapons upon feudal lords, they empower metal qi. When metal qi reigns, wood declines; when wood declines, fire dims; when fire dims, the omen of war arises. Fire symbolizes the ruler, capable of transforming the four seasons. Mars, as the harbinger of change, most faithfully reflects Heaven’s laws, not erring by even a fraction.\n\nWhen the ruler governs his household, he should focus on cultivating the fields and managing livelihoods. Upon encountering these four circumstances, if he does not bestow benevolence and favor upon the people, leaving the common folk with no recourse against litigation and theft, what is to be done? When encountering the worthy, bestow upon them culture; the hungry, food; the cold, clothing.\n\nWhy bestow culture upon the worthy? Culture arises in the East and shines in the South. Thus, celestial patterns originate in the Northeast, and writing emerges from the Northeast’s symbolism. The tiger bears its markings in the *yin* position, the dragon in the *chen* position, ascending to Heaven. *Li* represents culture in the South; thus, the Three Luminaries embody culture. The sun rises in the East and reaches its zenith in the South. Heaven commands emperors and kings to model themselves upon these patterns.\n\nHeaven has Three Sovereigns, Earth has Three Sovereigns, and humanity has Three Sovereigns. Heaven has Five Emperors, Earth has Five Emperors, and humanity has Five Emperors. Heaven has Three Kings, Earth has Three Kings, and humanity has Three Kings. Heaven has Five Hegemons, Earth has Five Hegemons, and humanity has Five Hegemons.\n\nWhat does this mean? Heaven’s Three Sovereigns correspond to the Three Luminaries; Earth’s Three Sovereigns correspond to highlands, plains, and fields; humanity’s Three Sovereigns correspond to ruler, minister, and people. Heaven’s Five Emperors correspond to the Five Stars; Earth’s Five Emperors correspond to the Five Peaks; humanity’s Five Emperors correspond to the five viscera. Heaven’s Three Kings refer to the Three Luminaries, and its Five Hegemons to the Five Peaks—aligning with humanity and Earth.\n\nAmong Heaven’s Three Sovereigns, the most excellent is the sun, the middling the moon, and the lesser the stars. Among Earth’s Three Sovereigns, the most excellent are the Five Peaks, the middling the level lands, and the lesser the fields. Among humanity’s Three Sovereigns, the most excellent is the ruler, the middling the minister, and the lesser the people.\n\nAll people bear six great sins that cannot be absolved—some incur punishment in their own bodies, while others pass it to later generations. Yet, though one accumulates boundless Dao, if they refuse to teach others to seek life, their sin remains. Though one accumulates boundless virtue, if they refuse to teach others to guard virtue and nurture their nature with care, their sin remains. Though one amasses wealth by the millions, if they refuse to relieve the poor and aid the distressed, allowing people to die of hunger and cold, their sin remains. Though one knows the Dao, if they scorn it and refuse to study diligently to save themselves—or, having attained longevity within the celestial lineage of their ancestors, they instead treat it lightly and do not study, thus dying in vain—their sin remains. Though Heaven endows people with strength so they may clothe and feed themselves, if they refuse to labor and instead suffer hunger and cold, squandering their ancestors’ legacy and idling away their strength, their sin remains. If one forcibly seizes others’ property, making harmony their enemy, their sin remains. These are the six great sins. Heaven abhors them and they cannot be absolved.\n\nAs my departure approaches, I leave this one admonition to the six disciples: The Dao is vast, without above or below, without exterior or interior. Guard its harmonious qi, and you are a subject and child. Seek it near, and you grasp the great; seek it far, and you lose it. Thus, the ruler who excels in governance begins with the stirring within his own belly—truly contemplating the Dao, principle naturally unfolds. Near, it resides in the heart and chest; far, it pervades the Four Seas.\n\nThe ancients called this the essential Dao. When the sages of antiquity instructed emperors and kings, they deeply pondered and planned, closing their nine apertures, resting their four limbs, entering a state of primordial chaos—like a ring without end, like a child in the womb without duties—only then could they grasp its principle. My Dao takes this as its great essential, and Heaven treasures its transmission.\n\n*Excerpts from the Tai Ping Jing, Ding Section, Scroll Four (conclusion)*\n*Tai Ping Jing, Wu Section, Scroll Five*\n\nAligning the celestial omens with the stems and branches, the state of Chang’an is governed thereby. What you inquire is the profound connection between Heaven and Earth, the omen-texts that, once spoken, cannot be altered for ten thousand generations.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord suffers from frequent disasters and sorrows. August Heaven takes the four seasons as its limbs, Earth takes the five phases as its body. The limbs govern flourishing and decline, the body governs compass and square. These nine spirits flow together throughout the world, penetrating above and below, their transformations difficult to perceive. They are the world’s greatest treasures, the gates of all things, possessing inherent constancy. One must not recklessly transgress them: those who follow them enjoy enduring fortune; those who disrupt them bring discord between Heaven and Earth.\n\nHeaven’s constant omen-law establishes the South as the ruler’s domain. The sun in the South is the ruler, fire in the South is the ruler, the Great Yang in the South is the ruler, the height of summer in the South is the ruler, the hearth among the Five Offerings in the South is the ruler, and the heart among the five viscera in the South is the ruler.",

      "translated_text": "The ruler should wear red garments, for this aligns with the phase of fire. When the ruler encounters anomalies, they invariably correspond with yang, never with earth. The sun, being the brightest, leads all luminaries, so Heaven constantly uses the sun to divine the ruler’s virtue in its flourishing or decline.\n\nThe model for a ruler is to seek kinship with the benevolent, govern with those who possess a heart, and together with those who govern, always practice the Dao and cherish life. Thus, the East cherishes life, the South cherishes nurturance. Those without benevolence cannot govern together; those without clarity cannot be rulers or leaders. The East, associated with wood, embodies benevolence; the South, associated with fire, embodies clarity. The East governs the Dao, the South governs virtue; the Dao governs life, virtue governs nurturance. The East represents culture, where the dragon appears bearing it. The South represents refinement, hence it is the essence of culture and refinement.\n\nThe East is where lesser yang begins to arise, thus it emerges from the East. The South, as the great yang, embodies the ruler’s flourishing virtue, its brilliance illuminating the lesser yang’s domain—wood gives birth to fire. Lesser yin serves as minister, submitting in righteousness to the great yang. Thus, metal yields to fire, bending and breaking as desired; ministers must likewise submit in righteousness to assist the ruler’s desires. Hence, lesser yin is the minister. Great yin is the people, who flow ceaselessly like water. The people are tasked with governing life for the state and its lords.\n\nThus, water nurtures wood, and wood is the ruler’s domain. Heaven’s omen-law dictates that lesser yang fears lesser yin. Therefore, ministers, in reversing their roles, record the affairs of the state, its lords, and officials. Great yang fears great yin: when a state possesses virtue and its ruler and ministers are wise, the people follow; when a state lacks virtue, the people rebel. Thus, the foundation of governance lies in the people’s abundance, for many people bring wealth, few bring poverty.\n\nHeaven’s omen-law divides into six parts. The southeast and above belong to Heaven, where all things ascend, creatures move, and people venture outward—all under Heaven’s domain. Thus, Heaven’s color is outwardly blue-green like wood, inwardly red like fire. The northwest belongs to Earth, where all things fall in autumn and winter, returning to soil, and people, like creatures, retreat into burrows by autumn and winter. Thus, Earth’s color is outwardly yellow-white like soil and metal, inwardly containing the black of water, symbolizing its northern movement.\n\nThe East and South hold honored positions, belonging to Heaven above and governing as rulers, teachers, and fathers. The northwest, belonging to Earth below, serves as ministers, the rear palace, and the people. The people are the rear palace of *jia*. *Jia* is Heaven, the fundamental position of kings, thus it is the Heart Star. The Heart Star is fire, belonging to the South. *Bing* is the chief of fire, chosen for its great brilliance—it is the ruler’s position. *Xin* is the rear palace of *bing*, and *jia* is the father of *bing*. Thus, *ji* is the palace of the great empress. *Xin* pairs with *bing*, and *bing* is the son of *jia*. Hence, *xin* is the palace of the lesser empress. *Bing* is the rightful son of *jia*, the ruler who receives the mandate.\n\n*Geng* belongs to *yi*, the husband of the state’s feudal lords. *Ren* belongs to *ding*, the husband of the emperor’s younger sister. *Gui* belongs to *wu*, the in-laws of the state’s great empress. The ten celestial stems each have their affiliations, while Earth governs the twelve earthly branches—how is this so? Heaven’s law dictates that though yin and yang circulate, those that pair each have their own domains. Heaven’s law differs: it does not allow entire households to follow and remain together. *Jia* takes *yin* as its domain, *yi* takes *mao*, *bing* takes *wu*, *ding* takes *si*, *wu* takes *chen*, *ji* takes *wei*, *geng* takes *shen*, *xin* takes *you*, *ren* takes *zi*, and *gui* takes *chou*. Thus, the Dao of Heaven moves in reverse to govern, while the Dao of Earth remains still. Hence, there is division of land but no division of people.\n\nNow, a state exists, so Heaven and Earth do not shift. Heaven completes one revolution in a day and night, its movement constant. Thus, the twelve branches each have their place and do not follow the stems in rotation. Wine is the sovereign of water, and water’s sovereignty should overcome fire. Fire is the ruler’s virtue; swiftly banish wine to preserve the fire’s power.\n\nMy Daoist method proceeds by regulating yang when going forth and regulating yin when entering; by regulating conduct when going forth and regulating spirit when entering; by regulating all texts when going forth and regulating all diagrams when entering; by dispelling disasters when going forth and rectifying the self when entering; by regulating the court’s learning when going forth and regulating the inner chamber when entering. In all matters, establish limits. Those who strive diligently in learning should each employ their talents, lest they lose the constant method. External learning, when pursued excessively, leads to superficiality, and one cannot restrain oneself. Internal learning, if not aligned with the correct path, veers into great error. Many scholars suffer from grave maladies yet remain unaware.\n\nThose who favor external learning and possess great talent often fall into superficiality, causing the Dao to become greatly distorted and lose its true principles. They falsely claim it as the authentic Dao, deceiving one another in peril. Those who overindulge in internal learning often plunge into great error, believing they have attained it. Ancient and modern texts abound beyond measure. In learning, grasp the true essence and do not deviate from its root. For those who learn from a master’s oral instructions, do not violate their master’s words—this is the great essential.\n\nThe greatest harm in learning lies in aligning with external chapters and verses, which leads to superficiality, excessive ornamentation, and reckless speech. Those who delve into internal texts that align with diagrams and omens fail to deeply grasp their essential meaning and instead speak in error. In all matters governed by Heaven’s discourse, only when ten correspond with ten is it correct. When nine correspond, it is slightly erroneous; when eight correspond, it is slightly chaotic. Below this, it is unusable. Such misnomers disrupt celestial patterns, displease yin and yang, cause all things to contend, and bring great calamity upon the people.\n\nThe method of nurturing life lies in inwardly perceiving one’s form and countenance clearly—this is the way.",

      "translated_text": "Externally perceiving the myriad things and their multitudinous essences—this is incorrect.\n\nIn all matters, one must constantly uphold the original text and seek the explanations of many worthies to stabilize it—this is correct. To amass numerous literary chapters and verses while forgetting the fundamental matter—this is incorrect.\n\nThe Celestial Master emerged with the qi of Great Peace, receiving the Dao and its virtue to revive the Supreme Sovereign. Favoring rulers who cherish the Dao, his thoughts extended downward even to the foolish and humble, penetrating the Six Directions and uniting with the Eight Extremities, encompassing all without exception.\n\nThe Dao is distinguished by nine degrees:\n1. **Primordial Qi and Non-Action**: To think of the body as doing nothing, only contemplating its luminous purity, as if relinquishing qi and formless—this is the method.\n2. **Serene Emptiness and Spontaneity**: To guard the form and embrace emptiness, naturally devoid of strangeness, with the body’s interior radiant and unobstructed like a king.\n3. **Numerical Measures**: To accumulate essence and inwardly observe, counting from the hair down to the feet, distinguishing the five fingers, and enumerating every aspect of form and countenance, internal and external. Knowing its meaning and constantly dwelling on it without losing even a fraction—this is the lesser art of measurement.\n4. **Spiritual Travel and Return**: To contemplate the spirits of the five viscera as they journey forth by day and return, witnessing their movements, conversing with them, and discerning good and ill fortune—this is the next degree.\n5. **The Great Dao’s Spirits**: When the human spirit departs, it aligns with the four seasons and five phases, sharing the hues of green, red, yellow, and black with the visceral spirits. The spirits and officials of the five phases serve humanity, capable of subduing all malevolent forces.\n6. **Stabbing Joy**: To stab the earth, inducing cleverness in people—this must not be employed frequently.\n7. **Community Counsel**: The spirits of heaven and earth, the four seasons, altars of soil and grain, mountains and rivers, and sacrificial rites—these must not be treated recklessly.\n8. **Vast Spirits**: These spirits are boundless, their Dao unattached; when the world’s refined qi descends, they cause people to speak recklessly, half resembling truth and half resembling deception.\n9. **Ancestral Spirits**: These are purely apparitions of ghosts, devoid of true Dao.\n\nThe celestial spirits possess their own divine treasures, their radiant essence following the five phases in color and the four seasons’ qi in rise and decline, serving heaven, earth, the people, and the myriad things.\n\nBetween heaven and earth, at the juncture of yin and yang, none are untouched by the transformative power of virtue and born thereby. To uphold the Dao, accumulate goodness, and thoroughly harmonize with the spirits and qi of heaven and earth, the people, crawling creatures, the myriad things, and the qi of the four seasons and five phases—constantly interacting with them—is to know none who are not virtuous.\n\n**First Rank: Great Compassion and Filial Piety**\nCompassion and filial piety arise from inner reflection, thoughts emerging from the storehouse of the viscera, attainable without study—this is the art of spontaneity. Conduct aligns with the heart of heaven, intent harmonizes with earth. Above, it benefits the emperor and king; below, it leads the people to prosperity, fostering harmonious qi and serving as the foremost model for humanity. Its practice is as vivid as cinnabar and ink—thus, it is ranked first.\n\n**Second Rank: Illuminating the Dao and Great Gentleness**\nTo clarify the Dao and its virtue, leading the hundred clans, studying and cherishing the Dao, amassing virtue, and preventing theft and banditry—this benefits the emperor’s transformative governance, embodying the truest auspiciousness.\n\n**Third Rank: Filial Piety, Fraternal Respect, and the Beginning of Virtuous Transformation**\nThose who begin to learn and desire goodness harbor hope in their hearts, turning from depravity toward rectitude, though their benevolent conduct has yet to fully transform.\n\n**Fourth Rank: The Diligent Farmer’s Son**\nThe diligent farmer’s son rises at dawn and rests at dusk, unafraid of toil, accumulating day by day. His household thrives, sustaining his parents, securing the earth’s bounty, and following heaven’s Dao. He dares not act wrongly and benefits the county’s governance.\n\n**Fifth Rank: The Greatly Unbenevolent Son and Lawless Youth**\nThe lawless, the unbenevolent sons—those who reject principle, curse heaven, strike the earth, and neglect their parents—inevitably wield weapons, terrorizing their villages. These frivolous youths disrupt heaven and earth’s transformative work, becoming grave harms. They must be captured through concerted effort, discarded into ditches, and denied burial.\n\n**Sixth Rank: Discord at Home, Deceiving the Elderly and Favoring the Young, Sharing Food but Hoarding Wealth**\nSuch households are doomed to ruin. Kin turn against one another, unable to instruct, recklessly spreading rumors and evading responsibility. Abandoning roots for branches, their calamity is irredeemable.\n\n**Seventh Rank: Repenting Wrongdoing and Abandoning Weapons**\nBorn in destitute villages, rarely witnessing or hearing of goodness, ignorant of right and wrong, their conduct offends heaven. Yet, thanks to a sagacious ruler, they are guided toward goodness. Though unlearned in youth, they repent in maturity. Let the virtuous and worthy, with pillars five feet high, swiftly expel them from the ranks. Those who study should examine this: one day, all the people may become good.\n\n**Eighth Rank: Repenting Wrongdoing and Returning to Goodness**\nThose whose studies fail and whose misfortunes multiply may yet, by the grace of a sagacious ruler who understands their plight, be allowed to repent and even become teachers of others.\n\n**Ninth Rank: The Greatly Wicked, Deceitful, Greedy, and Corrupt**\nThese corpse-like officials, wicked and avaricious, deceive their superiors and harm their subordinates. Great flatterers, they bear human form but possess the hearts of ravenous beasts. They bring no benefit to heaven, earth, yin, or yang, and their deep-seated disasters warrant execution and annihilation.\n\n**Tenth Rank: Correcting Wrongs and Returning to Rectitude**\nTo repent, reform conduct, and change one’s heart—though lacking goodness in youth and suffering repeated calamities—is to amend faults by evening if committed by morning, thereby earning the name of a good person.\n\nThese ten ranks are the methods of the ancient sages and worthies, delighting in people’s goodness and preventing mutual harm. Their aim is to allow each to complete their natural lifespan, return to the Dao, and sever the roots of misfortune, thereby witnessing the qi of Great Peace.",

When nine correspond, it is slightly erroneous; when eight correspond, it is slightly chaotic. Below this, it is unusable.

      "translated_text": "The divine all operate by established norms, their roots in the Great Correlation. The Great Correlation strikes the emperors and kings, thereby rectifying the movements of heaven. Its secondary root strikes the empresses and queens, thereby harmonizing the patterns of earth. Its middle root strikes the multitude of sages, thereby governing yin and yang. Its fine and subtle roots connect to the common people, thereby governing the myriad things. The great person who acts accordingly attains greatness; the middling person, middling results; the petty person, small gains—yet all may attain correctness.\n\nWhen emperors and kings practice the Dao and virtue, their flourishing is vast and luminous; with little virtue, their light is dim. When empresses and queens practice the Dao and virtue, the moon shines with great brilliance; with little virtue, its light is faint. When the multitude of worthies practice the Dao and virtue, the stars and celestial cycles blaze with radiance; with little virtue, their glow is weak. When all four roots practice the Dao and virtue together, the world is at peace, auspicious signs appear, and great light extends far. Gazing afar at the celestial signs, wind and rain arrive in their proper seasons, the barbarians submit in sincerity, and disasters and harms dissolve of themselves.\n\nNow, having received the Celestial Master’s writings on the Dao and virtue, they are entrusted to the reverent people, so that the reverent may return to a ruler of great benevolence and virtue, thereby pacifying the governance of the world and securing long-lasting peace for the self. The emperor is the first noble son of the August Heaven above; the empress is the first noble daughter of the Earth below. These most divine and sagely noble persons, by their office, ought to dwell within the hundredfold layers of the cosmos, yet instead they take on the cares of the world beyond ten thousand *li*, receiving the mandate of heaven to govern yin and yang, the six directions, and the eight quarters, upholding the supreme positions of heaven and earth. Entrusted by the divine spirits, they penetrate the utmost heights and depths, and all creatures that creep and crawl turn their hearts toward them.\n\nThus, they compose the *Wushang Lingbao Petition*, able to comprehend the will of heaven and illuminate the names of the officials versed in the stars and celestial cycles. As Grand Astrologers, they must not fail in their duties, alternating day and night to observe and await the flourishing or decline of celestial *qi*, the gains or losses of the Three Luminaries, rejoicing in receiving heaven’s commands and admonitions to secure their own peace. In the eleventh month, they cultivate the Yellow Bell, guiding the *qi* of the earth below to ascend and communicate, rejoicing in harmonizing with the intent of the Earth Queen to secure their own peace.\n\nThey construct the Hall of Light in the land of *bingwu* under the Great Yang, opening eight windows and four thoroughfares to delight in the free flow of the *qi* of the eight directions and four seasons, desiring to align with the auspiciousness of the eight winds and four seasons to secure their own peace. They open the four gates, rejoicing in receiving the world’s rare texts, extraordinary strategies, seldom-seen treasures, and the wise and wondrous arts that can bring long-lasting peace to the world and dispel calamities and anomalies.\n\nIn ancient times, the sages on the throne constantly sought out reclusive worthies and the meekly virtuous to share in governance. They wished to hear of the four seasons’ honored nobility, yet the kingly *qi* is the chief of the formless *qi*, the one to which all other *qi* strike and submit—these are the honored noble rulers. The kingly *qi* is heaven, the August One, the Emperor, the King, the Grand Year-Star, the Monthly Establishment, the Dipper’s Ridge, the Azure Dragon, the Great Virtue, the Flourishing Prosperity, the Emperor-King, the Supreme King, the Lord of Generation and Completion.\n\nThus, wherever the kingly *qi* resides, the myriad things submit to its rule; where it dwells, all things live and thrive as kings; where it turns away, all perish—this is due to the primordial *qi*. Therefore, when the kingly *qi* resides in yang, yang prevails; when it dwells in yin, yin prevails; when it resides in heaven, heaven prevails; when it dwells in earth, earth prevails. Wherever the kingly *qi* resides, all becomes kingly, receiving the mandate to govern and order.\n\nThus, the ancient sage-kings faced east in spring, south in summer, west in autumn, and north in winter, with the sixth month at the center. When the *qi* completes its circuit, they presented themselves to heaven, for the kingly *qi* is most honored in heaven. The month’s establishment is called \"Breaking and Great Expenditure\"; when the emperor’s *qi* clashes with it, it is named \"Death and Extinction.\" The primordial *qi* establishes the positions, and the emperor’s *qi* is the first *qi*, majestic and not to be rashly opposed.\n\nThe position after the monthly establishment is called \"Closure.\" Closure is when heaven seals off the yin *qi* of rest that follows, fearing that it may advance to become treacherous and crafty, encroaching upon the emperor’s established *qi*—thus, it is closed off behind. Opening is heaven’s law, which delights in no harm or injury. Therefore, opening what follows demonstrates the teaching of restful *qi*, for if there are those who act treacherously, it delights in opening the way for them to retreat. If they do not retreat, they will be seized; once seized, they will be interrogated, and guilt will be established. Once guilt is established, it cannot be removed, and death or peril follows.\n\nThus, the fifth position after is \"Peril,\" which brings one near death. The sixth position after is \"Breaking,\" where the Dipper’s handle breaks and death ensues—thus, the *Kui* star governs death, leading to peril. Therefore, the emperor’s *qi* arises from Lesser Yang and Greater Yang, ever guarding the establishment of the Dipper. The *qi* of death arises from Lesser Yin and Greater Yin, ever guarding the *Kui* of the Dipper.\n\nThus, the six positions following are where heaven constantly rests and empties, aligning with earth’s *qi* to govern closure, concealing treachery and villainy, dwelling together with evil spirits and beings—these must not be rashly opened or revealed. The ancients had worthies who cherished life, and all *qi* belonged to the front of the Dipper, moving in parallel with the celestial motions—thus, the days were auspicious and full of *qi*. All who are treacherous, crafty, yin-assassins, or evil and perverse resemble yin *qi* and belong to the rear of the Dipper—thus, the days are in decline, and their actions are inauspicious.\n\nThe primordial *qi* is vague and indistinct, naturally coalescing into one, called heaven. Dividing, it generates yin and forms earth, called the second. Thus, above is heaven and below is earth; yin and yang unite to generate humanity, called the third. The three powers together generate and nurture all things, called wealth. Wealth generates desire; desire generates perversity; perversity generates treachery; treachery generates craftiness; craftiness generates harm without end—then chaos and ruin follow. If ruin does not cease, it cannot be governed again, and thus it reaches its limit and returns to its root—this is called \"inherited burden.\"\n\nThe Way of heaven is without intent: when it encounters the unworthy, chaos ensues; when it obtains the wise and enlightened, order is restored. In ancient times, when emperors and kings obtained the wise and enlightened, the Dao flourished. They dared not take the foolish and unworthy as close advisors. Swiftly transmit this text to a ruler of supreme virtue. Those who practice it with penetrating clarity will shine, and the three *qi* will appear and inquire of one another.",

      "translated_text": "Those who divine with ten successes in ten are thorough in governance—this is the foremost clarity, fit for service to emperors and kings. Those who divine with nine successes in ten, with one *qi* disordered and ungoverned, may serve as feudal lords. Those who divine with eight successes in ten, with two *qi* disordered and ungoverned, may serve as common folk. Beyond this, it is called \"disordering heaven’s upright Dao,\" and grievances will bind the spirits and numinous essences, lurking in concealment where governance cannot reach, unable to harmonize the *qi* of Great Peace.\n\nIf you seek the Dao, ponder the written texts; the method of seeking the Dao takes stillness as its root. Accumulate essence without cease, and it becomes the gateway to spirit. The five virtues harmonize and unite, revealing the hun and po souls. When the heart-spirit is illuminated, the great Dao unfolds. First discern safety and peril, observe the four neighbors. The host of spirits gathers like clouds; if this practice does not cease, you shall be a long-lived lord. The great Dao does not require toil—your form like dead ashes, guarding the hun-spirit. If the hun-spirit does not depart, you shall long endure. The cycle returns to its beginning, endless as a ring. To abandon the root and seek the branches brings trouble to the Dao; the multitude loses it and cannot be whole. Reflect on its meaning, do not lose the true words. Purity and stillness are the foundation, not the use of wealth. How can you not cherish the words of an enlightened teacher? Follow the teacher’s instructions, and you shall not die.\n\nThe foolish rebel against their teacher and dwell near ghosts; they do not attain the upright Dao but enter the gate of misfortune. They depart and do not return to spirit; their bones and flesh rot in the mire, called ancestors only in name. Their fate is extinguished, their ruin complete.\n\nThe arts of the common and foolish all arise from within, possessing their own laws, with depth as their root. When they encounter the spirit, they live, free from suffering and sorrow. The spirit detests strife and turmoil—calm the heart, settle the mind, and beware of sudden violence. With prolonged stillness, the myriad Dao emerge. Long endure without death, and you shall match heaven’s completion.\n\nTo practice this, you must harmonize and become one with the Dao. The worthy hold fast without wavering, and all matters are fulfilled. Cast aside worldly thoughts, unite with the spirit, ride clouds and mount dragons, sharing a chamber with the Thunder Duke. Your body transforms into spirit, your form like the Great One.\n\nPonder these written words carefully; be vigilant not to lose discipline.\n\nThe Dao of focused contemplation is perfected in seclusion. Do not seek honor or rank; let your resolve grow daily more refined. Open the obscured to radiant clarity, like the brightness of day. When you do not study, it is as if gazing into blackest night—east, west, south, north, lost within your chamber. The worthy and sagely tremble, their hearts alone quaking with fear.\n\nIf you firmly uphold the five precepts, you shall not die. Content with poverty, delighting in lowliness, you may endure long. To scorn lowliness and seek nobility obstructs the Dao. Covet no high office or heavy emolument; to forcibly pursue rank is to lose the Dao. Better to lie abed in long repose.\n\nWithout eating, you become luminous; the hundred evils depart, and calamity flees afar. Guard stillness without cease, and you shall not perish. With good fortune, you may live long and walk far, never daring to indulge or lose constancy. Seek without cease, and you shall be a king of the Dao. The arts of nurturing life differ in method; they do not hinder the people’s affairs.\n\nWhen those above cherish life, the people’s lives are long. The worldly teachings place the Dao above, with benevolent kings. The sagely lord ponders the Dao, and its transformative influence flows downward, making the people pure and incorrupt. They shall know no calamity forever.\n\nIf the people do not die, it is due to the clarity of those above. When the ruler above lacks clarity, teachings go unheeded. Refusing the Dao, they instead favor warfare. Every household has a wicked son, and families perish. Wielding weapons, they waylay travelers by the roadside, seizing their goods in moments of vulnerability. The magistrates are not at peace, and bandits roam. Observe the people, and you may know whether those above are enlightened.\n\nWhen the lord cherishes benevolence, those below seek long life. When those above lack benevolence, those below incline toward perversity, all meeting early death, knowing no joy in life.\n\nWhen the foolish below cherish virtue, it is due to the ruler’s teachings. When the people cherish the Dao, their lord is enlightened. They all desire long life and to distance themselves from calamity, rejecting corruption and laying down weapons. They fold their hands and do nothing, casting aside misfortune. The sagely lord greatly prospers, and the people grow close. His kindness extends even to the foolish below—this is the mark of a true king. The Dao of heaven cherishes life to secure those above. When the foolish below do not contend, it is the blessing of those above. The world is most fortunate, and none do not turn toward the king.\n\nWhen the people do not cherish the Dao, it is due to the obscurity of those above. Harboring treachery within, they outwardly display virtue, yet do not practice it, favoring warfare instead. Fathers and sons are separated, dwelling by the roadside. They cannot attain long life, and deaths accumulate. Households have impoverished sons like tigers and wolves. Those above lack virtue, and the calamity of war follows. The foolish below have a ruler whose transformative influence does not flow; the people’s many inclinations toward immortality reflect the emperor’s clarity. Heaven sees his governance, and kindness flows downward. Even the crawling and panting creatures are bathed in his light.\n\nHeaven cherishes life and the Dao, thus it is called the \"Heavenly Canon.\" Those who accumulate virtue are the \"Earthly Canon.\" Earth cherishes nurturance, thus it is called the \"Earthly Canon.\" Those who accumulate harmony and delight in giving are the \"Human Canon.\" Harmonious *qi* flows and circulates; people possess wealth and circulate it, giving and receiving. Thus harmony is the \"Human Canon.\"\n\nIn ancient times, those who sought learning all rectified their roots. It is like planting a tree: seek a good seed and place it in good soil, and its growth—root, trunk, branches, and leaves—shall all be good. The root is the master; the branches and fruit are the disciples. Thus, in ancient learning, all first reflected on the root before studying the Dao. Therefore, those who could practice it harmonized with the heart of heaven, and so it was auspicious.\n\nIf one plants a tree without choosing a good one, placing it in poor soil, how can its branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit be beautiful? This begins with aligning the body and rectifying the nature, directing the intent of the Dao to return to primordial *qi*, thereby settling the body. Reflect on the duties and practices of the ancient masters—how can one govern oneself? Plan with a settled mind, and you shall attain it yourself. First settle the body, then begin the practice, like an infant at play, without straining sinews or strength, using only good intent.\n\nPonder how the ancients alone attained longevity—through singular focus, how did they achieve it? Only by the utmost Dao, restraining perversity and removing treachery, like a spirit. Without strange occurrences, the root is rectified, and thus one gains heaven’s heart, does not betray earth’s intent, completes the four seasons, harmonizes the five phases. Descendants do not inherit burdens from one another; each embraces utmost virtue, no longer knowing perversity or evil.",

      "translated_text": "Entering the chamber alone, one contemplates the fundamental needs of the scriptures and the Dao—what must be brought forth and what must be let go. The worthy first grasp its meaning, and those who follow after attain it as well, thus together entering the Dao, far removed from perversity.\n\nSecluded in the chamber, one reflects and preserves, the five officials shifting in turn, aligning with the cycles of yin and yang—meng, zhong, and ji as brothers—moving in response to *qi*, in accord with the four seasons and the five phases. The transformations of heaven’s Dao become the constant norm.\n\nTo lose *qi* is to die; to possess *qi* is to live. All things follow this, and the human Dao stands supreme. Thus, the five officials arise in accordance with *qi*, and heaven’s Dao soars as the supreme power through *qi*.\n\nThe perfected person accumulates *qi* and gathers spirit illumination; thus, the Dao alone endures in its constant course, while the myriad people, losing *qi*, perish. The dead are base; the living are noble.\n\nIf you guard the Dao, you may long endure, transforming with *qi* as heaven does in its constancy. Do not hasten after fame and profit, and the Dao will proceed of itself. Heaven’s Dao constantly generates without loss; earth’s Dao sustains duality, presiding over death.\n\nThe sages and worthies of highest antiquity—those of superior attainment retired to the mountains, while lesser scholars perished like insects among the common folk.\n\nThe worthy, upon seeing these writings, ponder deeply upon these words, first embracing difficulty and then ease, thus keeping the body free from harm. By guarding virtue, one completes the great Dao in the body. After studying and passing through the nine chambers, one becomes a spirit person, whose thoughts are ever distinct from those of ordinary people, never ceasing day or night to contemplate earthly matters, but desiring to hear of heavenly affairs.\n\nThe mind then contemplates the duties of heaven above, and only afterward descends through the nine chambers, accumulating essence with utmost sincerity, naturally transforming and altering one’s form. This is the sage of the highest heavens, who no longer concerns himself with the affairs of the common world—this is clear.\n\nMy writings enable the lofty scholar to attain life without hindrance, while the lesser scholar is prevented from reckless actions and false words. My writings on the Dao exhaust the aspirations of humanity, allowing the worthy and the unworthy each to fulfill their capacities, so that even at death, there is nothing left to regret—each has fulfilled their heavenly mandate.\n\nThose who desire longevity and lasting joy should contemplate and follow the true intent of the Dao. Those who do not seek lasting joy should attend to worldly affairs, content merely to preserve their bodies.\n\nExamine your conduct and reflect upon yourself to know the methods of gain and loss. The wise and enlightened encompass heaven and earth, accumulating boundless scriptures, yet if they cannot prolong their lives and enhance their destiny, this is called emptiness, a Dao without substance.\n\nThe masters of esoteric arts, though they may study for a long time and exhaust themselves, though they may master the patterns of heaven and earth, comprehend the nature of all things, and amass a complete collection of texts, if they cannot serve their parents and honor their ruler, such knowledge is of no benefit.\n\nPonder deeply upon these words, and good and ill fortune may be known. By practicing this simplicity, one comes to understand gain and loss for oneself.\n\nWhat in learning is most urgent? Thus, I set forth these two matters, clearly distinguishing the signs of a scholar’s loss and gain.\n\nSince the closing of the age, there have been two urgent concerns; the rest may be known or not, as one wishes. What heaven, earth, and the sagely and enlightened deem most pressing to promote and greatly attain are longevity and filial piety.\n\nLongevity is to share the same excellence as heaven and earth. Filial piety is to share the same power as heaven and earth. Thus, longevity is long life, sharing the same essence as heaven; filial piety is to submit below and comply with those above, sharing the same resonance as earth. These two matters accord with the intent of heaven and earth, and misfortune naturally departs.\n\nPonder deeply upon this intent—it is the principle of Great Peace, the essential key to long life. Yet those who desire to do good and seek to live are few.\n\nParents are the root of life. The ruler is the gateway to honor and esteem. The teacher is the source of wisdom, the inexhaustible vocation. These three are the gateways of virtue and the Dao.\n\nParents transmit the ancestral lineage of heaven and earth’s yin and yang. The teacher understands the intent of heaven and earth, resolving the knots of worldly affairs. The ruler, bearing the mandate of heaven and earth, complies with yin and yang, ever striving to grasp their intent, taking the governance of the Dao as his duty. Thus, these three are the gateways of nature and destiny.\n\nPonder deeply upon these words, and the myriad harms will be dispelled. Longevity and filial piety are what the divine spirits love. Those who lack longevity and filial piety are the targets of a hundred calamities.\n\nThis Dao is natural and requires no effort. To know its efficacy, observe how it constantly follows the good and evil of human intent. The mind’s intentions scheme within, and echoes respond without. To know this Dao, observe the correspondence of reflection and echo.\n\nThe mind and intent are the gateways of good and ill fortune. The rulers of Great Peace in antiquity governed by ensuring their minds and intentions were good, and thus their ministers were good. If their intentions were misguided, their ministers followed suit.\n\nMind and intent are the pivot and trigger of heaven and earth; they must not be recklessly disturbed, lest harmonious *qi* be thrown into chaos and disasters arise daily.\n\n*Excerpt from the Fifth Scroll of the Abridged* Classic of Great Peace*, Wu Section*\n*Excerpt from the Sixth Scroll of the Abridged* Classic of Great Peace*, Ji Section*",

Only by the utmost Dao, restraining perversity and removing treachery, like a spirit. Without strange occurrences, the root is rectified, and thus one gains heaven’s heart, does not betray earth’s intent, completes the four seasons, harmonizes the five phases. Descendants do not inherit burdens from one another; each embraces utmost virtue, no longer knowing perversity or evil.",

      "translated_text": "Now throughout the realm, mouths are sealed in fear, daring not to speak recklessly. Even the sun, moon, and stars in their celestial courses—intimate spirits of heaven’s constellations—stand in mutual awe. Thus when the sun rises, the stars flee and hide, not daring to appear, for they fear its majesty. Within the four borders, where a stern emperor reigns, heaven trembles and the earth quakes; though the capital may lie at a great distance, none dare speak in defiance of his edicts. If a province has a powerful governor, the entire province dares not speak. If a commandery has a formidable magistrate, the whole commandery dares not speak. If a county has a harsh magistrate, the entire county dares not speak. If a village post has a stern warden, even that single post’s jurisdiction dares not speak. This warden is but the lowest of officials—how much more so for those above him? All fear harm and seek only to absolve themselves, so that even if they harbor good intentions, they dare not express them to their superiors, and thus the Dao is severed.\n\nEven within a single family, bound by blood and kindred, such fear prevails—how much more so between those of different generations? Since the middle ancient era, the Dao and virtue have been lost, and governance has relied instead on might and force, with coercion and threats. Those who do not comply later suffer grave harm, their descendants deeply afflicted. In the lower ancient era, this grew even worse: should one wish to submit a memorial or speak to the emperor, those who probed his intentions would kill them. If not harmed at once, they would be secretly entrusted to others for injury. Thus ministers and people all tied their tongues, sealing their mouths in silence; though they witnessed sorrow and injustice, they could not report it upward. This left the emperor’s wisdom and insight cut off, and heavenly omens multiplied—clear proof of the effect.\n\nNow the people are born of their parents and receive life from heaven and earth, taking heaven and earth as their parents. When they witness calamities or auspicious signs, these are the words of heaven and earth, wishing to speak. Yet all fear harm and instruct one another, collectively turning their backs on the August Emperor and the Earthly Sovereign, suppressing their grievances before heaven and earth, so that words cannot pass, and heaven and earth remain long burdened with unspoken sorrow.\n\nThough the emperor is the wellspring of divine and human, he dwells within a hundred layers, beyond ten thousand *li*. Within those hundred layers, those who wish to convey words are obstructed and coerced, unable to reach him. When words cannot pass, heaven and earth grow enraged, slaughtering all things and destroying the cosmos. In such a year of great misfortune, wisdom is severed, and the state faces grave peril. This crime cannot be named, and thus it must be eradicated.\n\nGreat calamities and strange omens are the great words of heaven and earth. Moderate calamities and omens are their moderate words. Minor calamities and omens are their minor words. This is like human affairs: great matters merit great speech, small matters small speech—nothing appears without cause, nor is it meant to deceive. When great auspicious signs appear, heaven and earth rejoice greatly; when moderate signs appear, they rejoice moderately; when minor signs appear, they rejoice slightly. The absence of calamity and auspice is equilibrium.\n\nThus when heaven intends to aid an emperor, it first endows him with intention. From ancient times to the present, when heaven intends to aid one, it invariably produces extraordinary texts and marvelous strategies that can be verified and governed. Those who follow them all meet with great fortune; when heaven does not intend to aid one, it severs these extraordinary texts and strategies, preventing them from being seen, or if seen, making them appear foolish so they are not understood or applied. When heaven intends to promote one’s conduct, it opens the heart to clarity and receptivity, allowing their use—this is the method of heaven’s aid, and it does not deceive.\n\nThose who are about to prosper tend to favor goodness; those about to decline tend to favor evil. Those destined for fortune are easily guided; those destined for misfortune resist and defy others. Heaven constantly aids the good; the Dao longs to return to the virtuous. Heaven refuses to aid the wicked; the Dao refuses to entrust itself to fools.\n\nHeaven’s talismans return essence as cinnabar script, inscribed into the belly. When one sees the script within, great fortune follows, and all evil departs. The Five Offices and Five Kings are the origins of the Dao, the ancestors of spirits. If one can carefully seal them, closing the gates, then outwardly dark but inwardly bright, how can one not see clearly? Guarding this over time, heavenly physicians descend, and all illnesses vanish, leading to longevity. Fools discard it; the wise treasure it as a priceless gem—this may be called the Dao of eternal existence. It uniquely honors the natural, with form and spirit mutually preserving each other. When these two embrace, any perverse thoughts become faults, and losing the natural, one cannot attain longevity.\n\nThe infant’s five essences return to preserve itself. The Heavenly Lord asked: Why is the realm so difficult to pacify? The divine officials of the Five Phases replied: Now the emperor dwells within a hundred layers, ten thousand *li* from the four borders. Those far away harbor many grievances, and good and evil cannot reach him. Extraordinary methods and marvelous strategies are severed, unable to reach the emperor. Ministers and people, though aggrieved, cannot plead or communicate. Over time, the four directions become obstructed, and the worthy and good hide in seclusion. The emperor cannot obtain marvelous strategies or extraordinary words to pacify the realm—the fault lies in the closure of the distant borders on all sides.\n\nPeople dwell between heaven and earth; since the opening of the world, each person has but one life, never to be reborn. From the moment one has a name and is called human, humanity is the chief of all harmonious things, noble and honored, akin to heaven and earth. Yet upon death, one is eternally confined, never again to be called human or to rise and act. Thus it is mourned as a great injustice.\n\nHeaven and earth’s laws: Heaven and earth are the parents of all things, and they fear that among them, some may weep in grievance, gazing upward to heaven and bowing to earth, lamenting their early demise. Thus heaven generates the true Dao and marvelous methods by which one may protect oneself and attain modest longevity. All living things grow old and perish, yet fools refuse to diligently study the true Dao and good methods that could grant eternal years, delaying death and aging. Instead, they each neglect themselves.",

      "translated_text": "They scorn the true Dao and mock its marvelous methods, instead engaging in deceit and falsehood to disrupt the Way of Heaven. They deceive their superiors, hastening toward death, building tombs and preparing for the grave, arranging funerary pacts and mourning garments in advance—seeking death, they find it. What injustice is there in this?\n\nWhen one’s years are spent and fate exhausted, it is like the sun rising only to set again. The ancient sage-kings, ever mindful of their own worth and fearing death, day and night sought rare knowledge and extraordinary methods, revered Daoists, and exhausted their wealth in pursuit. Their utmost sincerity moved the August Heaven, which responded with auspicious signs. Masters of Daoist arts aided them, and so many attained long life, some even transcending the world.\n\nNow, heaven and earth regard humans as their children, and the emperor is the most honored of Heaven’s offspring. Yet they do not cherish the true Dao or its marvelous methods. Thus, with deep calculation and foresight, they know that the wealth of the world is not theirs to keep forever.\n\nIn ancient times, sages were wise and enlightened, and all worthy men emerged, gathering above as assistants. Thus, grievances were resolved. Heaven and earth have their principles—how much more so human relations? Emperors could govern with ease, free from worry, while the worthy fulfilled their loyalty, aiding their rulers in governance, together alleviating the great concerns of heaven and earth. The people thrived as a result—was this not good?\n\nWhen great assemblies were held, it was difficult to question why heaven and earth collapsed, why the sun, moon, and stars were eclipsed, why people died violently, or why the twelve thousand states’ strategies and divine texts were revealed. Why did the Three Luminaries suffer eclipses? Heaven and earth openly praise and elevate, yet this is not called praising or elevating people—it is called mutual reciprocity. Such examples are numerous and cannot all be recorded, and none of these receive heavenly retribution.\n\nYet if others do not protect me, I alone secretly protect them—Heaven rewards such a person. If others do evil, I alone do good—Heaven rewards such a person. If others do not contribute to me, I alone take joy in contributing—Heaven rewards such a person. If others do not feed me, I alone take joy in feeding them—Heaven rewards such a person. If others practice teachings as empty falsehoods to deceive, I alone teach people to be sincerely good—Heaven rewards such a person. If others say heaven and earth are unknowing, I alone secretly revere and serve them—Heaven rewards such a person. If others secretly desire to deceive their rulers, I alone secretly protect and benefit them without daring to deceive—Heaven rewards such a person. If parents do not love me, I alone love and protect them—Heaven rewards such a person. Such examples are too many to record.\n\nThe true person reflects: the superior person seeks heavenly reward, the middling person seeks human reward, and the foolish do not give yet demand reward. The most virtuous receive heavenly reward and transcendence. The moderately virtuous receive human reward, and so are loved, benefited, and employed. The foolish, contributing nothing, yet demanding reward, are despised and punished by heaven, earth, and humanity.\n\nThus, the qi of the August Heaven descends to generate, the qi of the Earth ascends to nurture, the qi of the Five Phases unite in effort, and the qi of the four seasons harmonize. The Three Luminaries shine ever brighter, and the world unites as one. Heaven’s nature is to act, and it most honors, values, loves, and protects those who embody it. Once heaven’s nature is good, it generates all things without exception. Earth’s nature is to nurture all things without exception. Sages delight in ordering heaven and earth, and all things receive their beneficence.\n\nThe great and good, the divine immortals, assist heaven and earth in their work, never daring to neglect themselves. They align with the primordial qi and harmonize with the heart of Heaven, and so enjoy perpetual fortune without misfortune.\n\nThe ancient sages and worthies, through deep thought and foresight, understood the intent of the Way of Heaven: they devoted themselves to secretly practicing goodness and dared not do evil. They deeply observed the bright prohibitions of the August Heaven, yet below, people turned their backs and violated them. With shallow learning and inferior understanding, they further disbelieved in Heaven’s prohibitions—thus, their fates were difficult to change, and they perished early.\n\nThe desired lifespans are: Heaven’s longevity at one hundred twenty years, Earth’s at one hundred, humanity’s at eighty, hegemons’ at sixty, and the subordinate at fifty. The Three Norms begin in the east, the head of Heaven. The year and months culminate in the northeast, the pole of Heaven. Heaven’s longevity is the firmness of numbers; the northeast is the beginning of things. The great cycle of the year ends here, so one hundred twenty symbolizes Heaven.\n\nEarth is yin, constantly receiving; the northwest is the extreme of yin. Yin brings death, yang brings life—thus, *hai* (the twelfth earthly branch) is the kernel, the end of yin in the northwest corner. The northwest is Earth’s controller of fate, so Earth’s longevity is one hundred years. Eighty and sixty mark yang’s cessation and yin’s rise, just as autumn begins. Autumn is the white qi, the White Tiger presiding—thus, the hegemonic lifespan.

To close the gates and dwell within, not engaging in worldly affairs—this is cherishing and nurturing oneself.

      "translated_text": "Reflecting in worry until one feels sated without eating—this is the mark of one who truly cherishes oneself. To speak of \"valuing oneself\" is to speak of cherishing the form of the body, its every part visible from head to toe. When such sincere love and care never cease, the face and eyes radiate light. If one cannot forget this day or night, making it a constant practice, the flesh may take flight and grow strong—this is the Way of self-love and self-care.\n\nNow, therefore, let men and women, young and old, wise and foolish alike, all submit memorials to the throne, that the emperor may attain enlightenment and wisdom. The emperor is like the North Star, ever fixed in its place, while all other stars come to present their affairs. The greater stars lead, the middling follow, and the lesser come last; if even one star fails to appear, the flow of qi is cut off, and the celestial movements are harmed. For the stars are the essence and radiance of the people and all things. Thus, if even one person cannot reach the emperor, one star too cannot reach its place. Heaven’s qi then becomes disordered, and earth’s qi turns against it. Therefore, instruct all officials and commoners, great and small, to submit memorials together, to harmonize heaven’s qi, to stabilize the stars’ courses, to dispel celestial afflictions, and to relieve the emperor of the burden of inherited faults.\n\nThus, three messengers are dispatched to circulate the memorials, lest any fail to reach the throne. The chief officials record disasters and omens within the city walls; the road inspectors record those along the thoroughfares; and the rural officers record those in the four wilds. Each gathers reports of varying lengths, transmits them to one another, and competes to submit them first. If the chief officials grow enraged, heaven and earth engage in battle, and their discord manifests in the sun, moon, stars, and celestial cycles—sometimes eclipses occur, sometimes they do not, the fault lying in the struggle between yin and yang qi. Yin and yang contend for dominance, each seeking to overpower the other. Yet yin and yang were originally meant to benefit and assist each other, together generating harmonious qi; their conflict arises solely from this lack of harmony. If they were harmonized, no eclipses would occur. In the most virtuous ages of high antiquity, eclipses were unknown. By the middle ages, heaven and earth’s intent was gradually lost, yin and yang grew less loving toward one another, and thus their battles began.\n\nIf you doubt my words, let a virtuous ruler put my teachings into practice. If he fully grasps their meaning, the battles will cease; if he grasps half, they will diminish by half. When the emperor abundantly practices the Dao and virtue, the sun and moon do not eclipse, and the stars’ courses remain orderly. This is like old friends who, though long parted, rejoice greatly upon meeting and aid one another. But if they were never close and suddenly encounter each other, they will fight instead.\n\nI ask: when drought strikes and all perish, when the people suffer and die of hunger and cold—this is the wrath of the Great Yang, the August Heaven. The six yang forces unite in resentment and thus bring harm. What does this mean? The six directions reach their limit, and their great net, long disordered by human malice, turns to killing. How does this harm people? It has no name. It simply strikes when the burden of inherited faults reaches its extreme, erupting in great fury, making no distinction between good and evil—those it encounters meet great misfortune. It is like a man seized by rage who, in his fury, attacks even the innocent. What wrong has the victim done? He merely encountered another’s rage. Thus, when the burden of inherited faults reaches its peak, it causes death and evil without distinction. The greatest calamity lies here.\n\nI ask: the strategies of the twelve thousand states differ—where should they be aligned? Let each follow its own customs, but with what should they begin? With the Dipper’s handle pointing southeast, the fire qi arises. I wish to hear the essential meaning of this. Fire is yang. Its tally commands the heart of heaven; harmony governs bestowal, openness governs communication, and clarity governs order. Fire is the lord of the heart, and the spirit of harmony is the chief of transformation. All affairs that arise begin in the heart. The heart governs right action, leaning on benevolence and clarity, and is further endowed with divine radiance. Though the twelve thousand states’ strategies differ, when their memorials are unified in one document, the primordial qi will naturally follow and flow. The perfected ones will adhere to it; to act in accord brings fortune, to oppose it brings ruin. Heaven delights in issuing such texts, and thus I speak.\n\nIn ancient times, the fire phase was to bring Great Peace, yet the divine Way was not rectified. Why, then, does the Celestial Master now command that the fire phase alone rectify the divine Way? Because the fire qi is at its most flourishing, and when the qi of the Highest Sovereign arrives, the fire qi’s flourishing must rectify the divine Way. Why? Fire is the heart of heaven. The heart governs the spirit, and when the heart’s spirit is bright, the heavenly qi is harmonized. When the heavenly qi is unbalanced, the emperor is distressed, yet the people do not grasp its essentials. If you wish to know this, it is bitter to the ears.\n\nNow, when wicked men occupy high positions, they disrupt the emperor’s governance. When the upright are denied office, heaven and earth lose their rectitude, and deviant qi prevails. When deviant qi is abundant, it harms the upright; when the upright are many, they suppress the deviant. These two forces are the natural arts of heaven and earth.\n\nI ask: the Supreme Qi of the Utmost Cavern governs governance. Thus, the Celestial Master examines the sores, scabs, and worms that devour people—this alone verifies the matter. When worms devour people, the disaster is most severe, for it disrupts the proper order. Now that the August Qi of balance has arrived, such things should not occur. They are the responsibility of a virtuous ruler who seeks to understand the Dao in its fullness. Before instructing the people to transfer the names of all worm lords, great and small, that cause harm—such as the three worms of the abdomen that produce sores and scabs—let their names be transferred. There is no worm without a name, however minor. Worms that hide within and secretly consume people are like worthless ministers who lurk within and devour the people. They are deeply to be feared; if not feared, they will bring great harm. Heaven bestows human destiny, and it has its own standards and laws.",

      "translated_text": "What Heaven and Earth reserve for themselves lasts thirty years—akin to the way Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, alternate in their cycles, with surplus days forming intercalary months. Thus is the private mandate established; those who surpass this term become immortals. The span of life allotted by Heaven is set at one hundred twenty years; by Earth, one hundred years; by man, eighty years. The lifespan of a hegemon is set at sixty years, and that of a commoner at fifty. Those who fall short of these measures—whether in death or life—suffer the calamities of inherited burdens. How can this be called unjust?\n\nEach person is born with a celestial reckoning, governed by fixed laws, yet most fail to exhaust their allotted span. The accumulation of celestial reckoning is boundless; thus, those who do good receive an increase in their allotment, augmented by this surplus. To grasp the greater principle, consider a village of ten households, each with a thousand acres of land. If nine households commit evil and perish, the sole virtuous household inherits the fields of all nine—this is the meaning of such reward.\n\nDo not expect yin and yang to protect people. If one fails to fulfill their allotted span yet hopes for celestial recompense, they will not receive it. If today you eat another’s food, then tomorrow they eat yours, this is not called consuming another’s food but “borrowed grain.” If today you drink another’s water, then tomorrow they drink yours, this is not called drinking another’s water but “borrowed broth.” If today you carry another’s burden, then tomorrow they carry yours, this is not called bearing another’s load but “borrowed luggage.” If today you lend another your strength, then tomorrow they repay you, this is not called aiding another but “exchanged labor.”\n\nNow, when people praise and recommend someone, they rush to submit memorials; when villagers do so, they too rush to submit memorials; and when travelers do so, they likewise rush to submit them. If local officials hesitate to submit, they fear the people will do so; if the people hesitate, they fear the travelers will; and if the travelers hesitate, they fear the officials will. Thus, all are compelled to submit, and thereafter they vie to present matters.\n\nWhen officials and commoners prove trustworthy, the emperor employs them without betrayal. Thus, officials and commoners delight in their service, and the emperor gains wisdom, fulfilling the royal will and securing his longevity. Officials and commoners, in turn, honor Heaven and Earth, remaining free of illness. When all four directions of Heaven and Earth benefit, long-lasting fortune is assured, establishing a model for ten thousand generations. This is entrusted to a ruler of supreme virtue, that the people may know the will of Heaven, enabling them to secure their own peace and wholeness, free from confusion.\n\nThe great compilation gathers and rectifies matters, examining the roots of Heaven and Earth to eliminate the terrors of Heaven, the faults of Earth, and the harms afflicting the state, thereby establishing the *Canon of the Utmost Extremity*. Furthermore, I inquired of the Heavenly Master’s writings, which collate and verify all texts from the opening of Heaven and Earth to the present—those of former worthies and sages, the *River Chart* and *Luo Book*, divine writings, and even the words of common folk, servants, and distant barbarians. All receive extraordinary words and unique strategies, unified into a single discourse to illuminate the Dao of Heaven. Was this not an immense labor?\n\nYet because distant matters often remain obscure, each seeks the abode of Great Peace within their own domain, preparing in their assigned villages and towns. Those too distant to deliver their words in person may establish stations along the roads, where they deposit extraordinary words, virtuous strategies, and rare methods. These are then gathered and presented to the ruler of virtue, allowing the assembled worthies to examine and classify them, selecting the finest and most upright to discard falsehoods and form the *Canon of the Utmost Extremity*, named the *Celestial Canon of Utmost Governance*.\n\nThus, the ailments of Heaven and Earth will be entirely dispelled; the governance of the emperor will achieve great stability; and the accumulated disasters of inherited burdens across ten thousand generations will be driven away. Thereafter, the myriad beings and spirits will transform in ways beyond description, and no longer will they ascend to report human evils to Heaven above.\n\nTherefore, the decree to collate and verify these texts is Heaven’s command for me to speak below. Though laborious, how could I not exert myself to the utmost? If every year, from all under Heaven, ten or so writings and individual testimonies are gathered, the doubts of the world will resolve themselves—without undue burden. Each remains in their place, speaking and transmitting their words upward. This is how the world’s voices are collected and shared, communicating the intent of Heaven and Earth, circulating the qi of Heaven and Earth, eliminating the emperor’s disasters, and benefiting all people and beings. When each attains their rightful place, Heaven and Earth will rejoice as one, their ailments dispelled. In their joy, they will protect the emperor, allowing him to govern effortlessly and wander at leisure.\n\nI wish to know why Heaven and Earth, at this time, command the people of the world to gather words and strategies, along with the writings of ancient and modern divine sages, to form the *Canon of the Utmost Extremity*.\n\nThe reason is that Heaven and Earth suffer from grave illnesses, constantly afflicted by chaos, and have never achieved proper governance. Thus, they instruct people to gather and collectively produce correct words and extraordinary strategies to cure these ailments. This is why they command a great assembly of voices and matters.\n\nI wish to know why, when Heaven and Earth are in chaos and afflicted, they do not simply bring forth more good sages.\n\nTo repeatedly produce later sages would be of no benefit. The Heavenly Master said: The conduct of ancient sages varied in excellence, each excelling in one domain, all speaking the words of Heaven and Earth yet differing in expression. Thus, the sages who appeared before and after pursued distinct paths. All delighted in fulfilling the will of Heaven and Earth, eliminating evil and promoting good, yet their words were not entirely alike, though broadly similar. Therefore, even the assembled sages could not fully comprehend the intent of Heaven and Earth. Thus, Heaven and Earth remain afflicted by grave illnesses, none of which are dispelled. For this reason, I have been sent to convey this message to the Perfected One.\n\nThe Perfected One I address is one among the gods of Heaven who delights in goodness and seeks to align with the will of Heaven—unique in his enduring truth. The reason for collating the divine writings of the high, middle, and low antiquity is this: what the divine writings of high antiquity did not address, those of middle antiquity did; what the divine writings of middle antiquity did not address, those of low antiquity did.",

The writings of high antiquity may have missed something, which those of middle antiquity grasped; the writings of middle antiquity may have missed something, which those of low antiquity grasped. By categorizing and aligning them, and thereby complementing one another, a single discourse of goodness is completed. The people of high antiquity may have missed something, which those of middle antiquity grasped; the people of middle antiquity may have missed something, which those of low antiquity grasped. By categorizing and aligning them, and thereby complementing one another, a single discourse of goodness is completed.\n\nSome may have missed something above, yet grasped it below; some may have missed something below, yet grasped it above; some may have missed something above and below, yet grasped it in the middle; some may have missed something in the middle, yet grasped it above and below. The divine writings of the celestial gods may have missed something, yet the sages grasped it; the sages may have missed something, yet the worthies grasped it; the worthies may have missed something, yet the common people grasped it; the common people may have missed something, yet the barbarians grasped it. Some may have missed something internally, yet grasped it externally; some may have missed something externally, yet grasped it internally. There are those who grasp it, and those who miss it. Thus, from above and below, within and without, the noble and the humble, the near and the distant—all take their essential words, compiling their strengths and shortcomings, categorizing and aligning them, and thereby complementing one another, then it shall be complete. Thereafter, the words and discourses of the writings shall be fully communicated.\n\nHeaven and Earth generate all things, the people, the sages and worthies, the crawling creatures and the myriad beings—each has its strengths and shortcomings, each has its insufficiencies, each has its losses. Thus, their actions differ, though all broadly seek to align with the intent of Heaven and Earth and thereby secure their own peace. Therefore, today Heaven has sent me down to assist the ruler of supreme virtue in further examining the teachings of the writings, and I have assembled them all. The divine writings and sagely discourses, extending even to the common people, servants, slaves, and barbarians—by categorizing and aligning them, combining their words and discourses, the good shall be made into a comprehensive scripture, named *The Writings of the Supreme Heaven’s Utmost Governance*. Thereafter, the grave illnesses of Heaven and Earth shall all be dispelled.\n\nI ask: by assembling these categories to align with one another—\nIndeed, rectifying their words for goodness brings fortune; failing to rectify their words for goodness brings misfortune. Thereafter, the qi of the Great Peace and the Supreme Sovereign shall swiftly arrive.\n\nPeople afflicted by illness all wish to swiftly recover and become well; the illnesses of Heaven and Earth likewise wish to swiftly recover and become well. Now, heterodox writings confuse the Daoist scriptures; when the Daoist scriptures are confused, the celestial patterns and earthly principles are disordered. When the celestial patterns and earthly principles are disordered, Heaven and Earth fall ill. Thus, the Three Luminaries, winds and rains, the four seasons, and the Five Agents engage in constant strife, and the years turn inauspicious. The emperor and king grow anxious and distressed; the officials govern in chaos; the people suffer from hunger and cold—all this is the affliction of heterodox writings. When heterodox writings, heterodox words, and misleading discourses are used to govern the state, disorder arises daily. Thereupon, ministers distort the law and act recklessly; the people are impoverished and exhausted, together defiling the principles of Heaven and Earth. The celestial officials grow furious, weeping and crying out in grievance without end.\n\nWhen heterodox words, heterodox writings, and misleading discourses are used to govern the household, father and son, husband and wife fall into disorder, growing mutually resentful and constantly quarreling without cease, thus becoming an inauspicious household. Only upright words, upright writings, and upright discourses are the root of rectifying Heaven and Earth, the treasures that pacify the household, the state, the sacred vessels, and the parents—and the mandate received by all people and the myriad beings under Heaven. Thus, one must strive to rectify them.\n\nTherefore, in my practice of the Dao, I wholly uphold the fundamental precepts and the mean, discarding the superficial. Heaven upholds the fundamental, so I uphold the fundamental; Heaven preaches the mean, so I preach the mean; Heaven discards the superficial, so I discard the superficial. In my writings, I am of one body with Heaven and Earth, of one heart and one intent, of one direction and one principle, of one liking and one disliking, of one Dao and one path. Thus, when the virtuous ruler applies them, there shall be no error. For ten thousand times ten thousand years, they shall not be abandoned—only growing ever more manifest, with no time of obscurity; only growing ever more ordered, with no time of chaos; only growing ever more good, with no time of evil. Thus, it is called *The Utmost and Upright Dao of Heaven*, which embraces the heart of Heaven and Earth. Those who obtain its highest secrets may attain longevity; those who obtain its middle secrets may become the state’s assistants; those who obtain its lowest secrets may always secure their own peace.\n\nI ask: why is yang alone honored and noble, while yin alone is deemed lowly and base?\nThe divine person says: Yang is alone honored and noble because it upholds the fundamental, ever full and replete with substance. Yin is alone deemed lowly and base because it is empty and devoid of substance—thus, it is despised and held in contempt. Now, yin and yang, male and female, are the very origin from which the primordial qi first arises—the gateway of yin and yang.",

      "translated_text": "The place where humans receive their mandate and life is their root. Thus, when a man receives his mandate, he is full and overflowing, with an abundance below and to his left and right—one solid essence remains. Those above are full and overflowing, ever bestowing upon the lower yin and accumulating surplus. This bestowal is the movement of Great Yang; is there anything it does not generate? Is there anything it cannot accomplish? The accumulation below corresponds to Great Yin and Earth, with patterns and veins aligning with the fields’ divisions. The solid essence on the left corresponds to humanity, while that on the right corresponds to the myriad things. This solidity—this core reality—is benevolence and the love of bestowing, which is why yang is honored as noble. Women are deemed lowly and base because the place where they receive their mandate is empty and void, without fullness or surplus, and thus without solid essence—hence their lowliness.\n\nThus, the Way of Heaven values the root and guards the origin. One must return to the root and guard the primordial, rightly upholding the examined patterns to dispel confusion. Only then can Heaven endure and Earth last, the state be at peace and the people secure—all because the solid yang delights in bestowing. Yang is Heaven, the ruler; yin is Earth, the minister. Therefore, one reveres yang’s bestowal and thereby nourishes it.\n\nI ask the divine person: how many states are there in the world?\nThere are eighty-one domains in the central region, and beyond them, another encircling expanse—altogether, the world holds ten thousand states. Farther still, beyond the ordered caverns of the void, the three regions together comprise twelve thousand states, all receiving the teachings of Great Peace. In the first year of Great Peace, people rejoice and act in goodness. In the second year, the earth brings forth great joy. In the third year, grace and favor thoroughly permeate the world. In the fourth year, the winds and qi flow in harmony. In the fifth year, spirits do not wage war, and malevolent forces submit and vanish. In the sixth year, the six norms are fully established. In the seventh year, the Three Luminaries grow brighter. In the eighth year, grace reaches all eight directions. In the ninth year, yin and yang are both content. In the tenth year, the myriad things each attain their proper place. This completes the lesser cycle, and when things combine thrice, Heaven, Earth, and humanity are complete—thus, in thirty years, Great Peace is achieved.\n\nNow, the qi of the Supreme Sovereign emerges, and the true Dao arrives, governing for ten years—this is Lesser Great Peace. If one diligently practices the true Dao for twenty years, Middle Great Peace is attained, wherein emperors and kings below, along with all officials and commoners, follow the true Dao and dispel deceit and falsehood.\n\nThe divine person speaks to the perfected one: In ancient times, when first learning the Dao, the spirit roams and guards softness to preserve itself. Accumulating virtue without cease, the Dao leads to immortality—riding clouds and driving dragons through the gates of Heaven, following the celestial rotations like a cycle. The perfected one, through singular devotion, attains longevity, their life linked to Heaven. The Dao of yang accumulates through focused devotion, and daily, singular sincerity brings it to fruition. Without contending for glory or rank, one may yet hold high office. Serving teachers with filial piety, the Dao naturally comes. The spirits recognize goodness, and people speak with them.\n\nThe teacher who opens one’s understanding is the beginning of the Dao. The ruler, father, and teacher are the gates of destiny for the world. Revering and serving these three, the Dao unfolds in great measure. Failing to serve them, one’s chamber is closed without a door—blessings and virtue flee, while misfortune and chaos take pity. Examine these matters carefully, and do not lose the words of this text.\n\nParents give life, while teachers instruct in relationships. Serving them with devotion—can one not be cautious? The noblest in the world abandon office to become immortals. Immortality has no end, and life connects to Heaven. Local officials govern the people, while immortal officials serve as celestial officers—what business do they have with the mundane? Their affairs differ. Local officials govern the people and the myriad spirits; the world’s affairs each have their ruler. Strive to think of goodness, and your body may remain whole. Thus departing, you do not betray your ancestors.\n\nMy illustrated texts are now exhausted, and nothing more can be set forth. Exert yourself in study and carefully inquire into these writings.\n\nThe divine person is about to depart and thus admonishes the perfected one: Be cautious, be cautious! Do not transmit this recklessly. To one unworthy, do not reveal it. Hide it deep in the abyss, in the darkness between the unseen. The Dao does not drink blood, nor does it speak of essential texts. What is external and internal is already complete—nothing more can be said.\n\nHere, the divine person is depicted in feathered robes, ascending to Heaven in a carriage drawn by nine dragons, accompanied by lesser perfected ones on simurghs and cranes, with colorful clouds gathering before them, as if bidding farewell.\n\nOn the western wall is an illustration: The ancient divine and perfected ones warned later learners through images of evil—do not act as hidden thieves, do not dislike following proper affairs, and do not indulge in jealousy, which brings death and misfortune. The Way of Heaven cannot be forcibly seized; those who seize it will bring about war, loss of authority, death, and the ruin of their lineage. Stealing divine texts will lead to defeat; seeking profit will instead bring harm—this is the resonance of Heaven and Earth’s nature, the meeting of the spontaneous. Examine joy to endure long; be cautious, be cautious! Do not delight in harm. Goodness arises naturally, while evil self-destructs. Observe these two images and ponder their benefits and harms.\n\nAll things under Heaven follow their kind. Even in the space of a hair, there is no error. Yet people are not themselves refined and thus remain ignorant. Once the name of guilt is attached, nothing can be done. Failing to guard the root, one’s death is followed by lingering transgressions. Acting wickedly within, refined qi summon external forces. Thus, ahead lies harm and imprisonment, while behind lurk malevolent spirits, all hastening to fight. Regret comes too late, and one forgets oneself.\n\nTherefore, these images are drawn to warn later worthies as a great caution. Fools do not believe in the Dao and neglect affairs as if indifferent. Yet when they speak, they do not err by even a fraction. Thus, those who guard softness attain longevity, while those who love strife perish. Things follow their kind and cannot return—regret is useless, and spirits become attached.\n\nSeeing the warning and awakening, one may yet return in time. If no harm has been done above, one may still become a good person. The good ascend, while the wicked descend. The Way of Heaven is impartial, and the spontaneous is never lost. Open and unobstructed, it aligns with the heart of Heaven and the will of Earth, transforming Heaven and Earth’s calamities, smoothing their discourse, allowing people to dwell in their places and the myriad things to remain unharmed.",

Hence, disasters and calamities arise daily, and the dead cannot be numbered. The emperor-kings, long distressed, cannot restrain their subordinates from craft and deceit.

Admonitions extend to the humble and distant, preventing grievances and entanglements, aligning with the heart of August Heaven. Delighting in the removal of disasters, they prevent Heaven’s wrath.\n\nIn the Lower Antiquity, the hearts of people are perverse and obscured, unlike the Three Sovereigns of the Highest Antiquity, whose hearts were simple and sincere, their intentions single-minded. Each delighted in aligning with the heart of Heaven, loyal and trustworthy, never deceiving their superiors—thus, no scriptures were needed. In the Lower Antiquity, petty men are foolish and deluded, distorting words with falsehood, deceiving Heaven and Earth, and hoodwinking emperor-kings. Therefore, Heaven and Earth are often enraged, sending down disasters. When Heaven and Earth’s afflictions are removed, the emperor-kings are secure and long-lived, the people dwell in peace, the myriad things fulfill their heavenly years, free from resentment.

      "translated_text": "A minister who is disloyal cannot fully devote himself to reverently serving his lord. For these three conducts—failing in filial piety, loyalty, or obedience—the guilt cannot be absolved. Heaven detests them, ghosts and spirits harm them, and all people despise them. Even in death, their blame lingers in the underworld, branded as those whose three conducts were unruly and unvirtuous. Each month’s final bright dawn, they are summoned to face Heaven, which governs the rectification of yin and yang. The spirits and officials of high and low ranks grieve for their souls, tormented until annihilation.\n\nHeaven sets fifteen days as a minor reckoning, thus the moon wanes after the fifteenth day. A month serves as a middle reckoning, and a year as a great reckoning. The myriad spirits and essences between Heaven and Earth jointly assist Heaven in nurturing the twelve thousand beings, and thus all spirits and essences receive their allotted sustenance. This is like worthy ministers aiding the emperor-king in nurturing all people and things, so that all receive their due.\n\nTherefore, Heaven establishes the law: all spirits report in minor audience on the fifteenth day of the month, in middle audience once a month, and in great audience once a year. Those with great merit are promoted and elevated; those without merit are demoted or punished. Those who disrupt governance are the spirits of perversity and evil.\n\nIf one lives as a filial son, a loyal minister, and an obedient disciple, never departing from these virtues, then after death, one’s soul, spirit, and essence will not face judgment. For the two reckonings: those who study my Daoist scriptures, aligning them with past and present, categorizing them by kind, and grasping their essential meaning—even the most worthy and enlightened rejoice uncontrollably, unable to restrain themselves from goodness. If they dare enter the thatched chamber, steadfastly guarding the Way without fail, they will surely transcend the world. Their aspiration merges profoundly with the numinous, and they no longer seek praise in worldly affairs. Their goodness pervades Heaven and Earth, and their spirit aids Heaven and Earth, returning to assist the emperor-king in transforming evil. Their benevolence extends even to the smallest blades of grass, and none fail to receive its transformative virtue.\n\nThus, in antiquity, the worthy and enlightened who found a teacher and could aid the emperor-king in achieving Great Peace were all such people. The moderately worthy, diligently studying my scriptures, aligning them with ancient and modern Daoist texts, categorizing them by kind, and studying them earnestly—those among them of sufficient talent may ascend to become good ministers and virtuous officials, aiding the virtuous ruler in transforming evil. Their benevolence reaches even the smallest blades of grass. Yin and yang harmonize, and warfare ceases. The emperor-king enjoys long tranquility without trouble, while all ministers below teach and strive together, all obedient and virtuous, loyal and trustworthy. Governance proceeds without punishment, and evil cannot prevail.\n\nWhen the people collectively study my Daoist scriptures, high and low unite in shared purpose, acting as one. No one remains who knows how to commit wickedness. They collate and categorize ancient and modern Daoist texts, linking them by kind, making them the learning of the age, passed down from father to son without end. When the three grades—superior, middling, and common—all practice this, the malevolent qi of Heaven and Earth is entirely dispelled, and no further calamities of karmic inheritance arise. Goodness harmonizes yin and yang, the qi of Heaven and Earth aligns, and auspicious signs emerge, roaming the emperor’s capital. This is the proof of the joy and delight of the August Heaven and Earth.\n\nTherefore, those who study my texts should examine them with utmost care. For the three reckonings: those who attain the Dao will surely encounter spirits who empower them. The most worthy and enlightened govern ten out of ten matters perfectly and may serve as the emperor’s ministers, driving away perversity and eliminating evil. Some may, after a long time, enter the chamber and transcend the world, no longer seeking praise in worldly affairs. Thus, only by guarding the One can one fully know good and evil, merits and faults; only then can one guard the Dao. By entering the chamber and refining one’s thoughts, one can then guard the spirit—this is the third stage.\n\nThe worthy collate and verify ancient and modern divine scriptures. The moderately worthy guard the One and enter the Dao, eventually witnessing the spirits themselves. They govern nine out of ten matters perfectly and may serve as great ministers to kings and lords, driving away perversity and eliminating evil. With time, they may hope to enter the chamber. The lesser worthy guard the One, enter the Dao, and study the scriptures, sometimes witnessing the spirits. They govern eight out of ten matters perfectly and may serve the people in driving away perversity and eliminating evil. They, too, collate and verify ancient and modern Daoist texts, proving the Way to themselves, so that even the foolish come to understand and believe in the Dao.\n\nWhen the great worthy, the middling worthy, and the common people all guard the divine Dao and practice it, the spirits of Heaven and Earth and the four seasons all assist them, and perversity naturally vanishes. Thus, the spirits of Heaven above, Earth below, the four directions, the six relations, and the six kinships all rejoice. Heaven promotes goodness and aids people in auspiciousness.\n\nMy Dao governs Heaven and Earth, pacifies the emperor-king, and gives life to what Heaven and Earth love—thus, one must love the true Dao and true virtue. Heaven is the truth of the Dao, its guiding principle, its faithfulness, and the course by which it moves. Earth is the chief of virtue, its guiding thread, and the foundation upon which it rests. Thus, it is the mother of the myriad things, enduring humiliation and dwelling below, never boasting of its toil.\n\nAs the Virtuous Lord, I teach and transform the ignorant, taking these two matters of Heaven and Earth as my foundation. Thus, I always follow the laws of Heaven and Earth, never straying from their gate and threshold. My scriptures are the words of Heaven and Earth, deeply and uniquely resonant with the gods and spirits, like the exterior and interior of a single body.\n\nAll names under Heaven today are categorized by kind, so one may know their proper affiliation. Those who embody the Five Surnames in abundance resemble yang and are benevolent; those who embody the Six Passions in abundance resemble yin and are greedy. Those who receive more yang bestowal become male; those who receive more yin bestowal become female. Those who receive more qi of prosperity and dominance are noble and single-minded; those who receive more qi of decline, decay, and imprisonment suffer frequent illness, die young, and live in extreme poverty.\n\nThus, all who are born embody the qi of the Five Phases they resemble. Their fate is determined by the Six Jia and Five Calendars, categorized by kind according to the ancients—never erring even once.",

      "translated_text": "The sages of antiquity delved deeply into the origins of all matters, understanding human nature through this. Do the Perfected Ones comprehend this? Gazing upward to emulate the heavens in conduct, one may act in accordance with celestial patterns; looking downward to emulate the earth in conduct, one transforms through the earth’s virtue and power. Reflecting that heaven and earth, as father and mother, gave me life and growth, they do not wish me to delight in evil—thus, I examine my heart before acting. The heart is the most revered spirit concealed within. The heart is the sacred, pure yang fire. When this fire moves, it ascends, sharing the same radiance as heaven. Thus, the sun, sovereign of fire, governs all under heaven with impartial illumination. Therefore, when a person embodies utmost sincerity, the pain of the heart’s rectitude ascends as the sacred spirit, rising to the sun and moon, and further ascending to heaven. Thus, utmost sincerity within is the numinous spirit—how can one not be cautious?\n\nHeaven acts through the utmost Dao; earth acts through the utmost virtue. The utmost virtue is the foundation of the household, jointly nurturing the myriad things without concealment or partiality. The sages of antiquity emulated heaven and earth in their conduct, employing the utmost Dao and essential virtue to instruct the foolish, guiding them to prudence and goodness, making governance effortless. Yet in this age, such ways are often obstructed and severed, so the foolish collectively engage in cunning and deceit, losing the Dao of heaven. Unaware of their own wrongdoing, they fail to practice the true Dao and benevolent virtue, thus many incur heavenly punishment, meeting deaths that remain unabsolved.\n\nNow, the Celestial Master broadly opens the path of the heavenly Dao, meticulously collating the texts of ancient Daoist scriptures to establish the true essential and secret Dao. The true Dao abounds in goodness; its writings enter the divine, enabling one to perceive spirits and govern alongside them. When the spirit enters the divine, it is the true Dao. Many attain this in secluded chambers; some are enabled to transcend within their rooms and depart, while others enter and exit without yet being able to leave. Some merely perceive the spirits but remain bound through the ages. Those who conduct themselves as disciples of the Dao and study to attain high office must resolve their intentions.\n\nFor all people, focused inquiry is key. Entering the gate of learning today, one must concentrate the mind, constantly desiring to benefit and cherish others without uttering falsehoods. Those who study in youth yet persist in ignorance into old age do not delight in attaining office. Yet those who diligently study, striving to comprehend the classics and the Dao, ceaselessly accumulating goodness—whose conduct and learning establish their reputation, whose mastery of the classics and Dao deepens their understanding of the origins of ancient and modern calamities—bring benefit to superiors and advantage to inferiors. Their accumulated goodness cannot be concealed, and their names resound in all directions. Enlightened rulers favor them, summoning and appointing them, while all praise, \"Excellent is this person!\" Those who rejoice in their virtue are those who study the Dao and transcend the world.\n\nI further expound the Dao to disciples: those who do not transcend, though they enter the gate of learning today, take no delight in pondering the true Dao or its benevolent teachings. Instead, they seek vast knowledge and broad observation, aspiring to exhaust the ways of the sages. Yet they do not desire to practice goodness, preferring instead the superficial embellishments of rhetoric that enable deception. Even after entering the classics and the Dao, their minds remain unfocused, constantly indulging in falsehoods and verbal disputes, making harm to others their vocation. They disrespect superiors and fail to cherish inferiors. Their mastery of the classics and Dao remains hollow, unfit to serve as worthy ministers to emperors and kings, instead becoming leaders of disorder. Relying on others’ wealth to advance themselves, they seek high office to elevate their reputation, then embezzle public resources for private gain, betraying superiors to benefit subordinates. Such are the disruptors who undermine proper governance, the scourges of heaven and earth, the traitors to the state. They are tigers and wolves among the people, wicked children to their parents. Heaven and earth detest them; ghosts and spirits abhor them. Thus, their crimes warrant execution by the emperor to align with the will of heaven, to eliminate the great harm to the people—these are the deceitful who attain office.\n\nSome, though their minds lack sincerity and substance, harboring no true steadfastness, instead constantly scheme to obtain office. Office is the celestial constellation’s domain, bestowed upon the virtuous and rewarding the meritorious—not recklessly given to the undeserving. The undeserving are disregarded by heaven and earth, unloved by spirits and deities. The foolish, unable to deeply recognize their own faults, persist in vainly desiring celestial office. Malevolent spirits and entities then enter their hearts, compelling them to utter falsehoods and perverse speech, which they cannot restrain. Thus, some perish through perverse words—this is the meaning. Not only does misapprehending the Dao bring misfortune, but the Perfected Ones must strive in the art of self-transcendence.\n\nThe sages and worthies of antiquity observed the luminous laws of heaven and thus practiced the Dao and upheld virtue. Heaven is singularly focused, moving day and night in the Dao without speech, thus enduring in fortune. Earth moves day and night in the Dao without speech, nurturing the myriad things, thus enduring in singular fortune. The four seasons move day and night in the Dao without ceasing, thus perpetually flourishing and reigning without end. The Three Luminaries alone follow the true Dao without speech, thus perpetually radiant, moving in accord with heaven. The Five Phases alone follow the true Dao without speech, thus enduring with heaven and earth. All under heaven who practice the Dao emulate these—innumerable are the examples. Constantly cherishing and benefiting others, refraining from reckless speech, the Dao may be attained. Those who lightly dismiss my words are harmed by the Dao.\n\nI speak as the discourse of heaven to admonish the virtuous ruler. When a virtuous ruler arises in heaven, they must love the Dao, and the myriad people will emulate their ruler, all taking this text as a warning. Thus, heaven’s emulation and law are most exalted, without superior; in reversal, most humble, without inferior. Its greatness has no exterior; in reversal, its smallness has no interior. It encompasses and nurtures the myriad things, bestowing benefit and blessing upon the good and evil, great and small alike, endowing them with primordial qi to give life, ultimately without harm or injury. Thus, it is most fittingly called the divine, the supreme ruler of heaven.",

      "translated_text": "Now the qi of the Supreme Sovereign arrives, and the virtuous ruler governs, emulating this as their model. Thus, my Dao rises and falls, sinks and floats, desiring that the multitude of worthies deliberate upon it together.\n\nThe earthly gate of the southeast holds the waters of heaven and earth, which do not resist even the smallest currents—good and evil, great and small all return to it. Do you, Perfected One, comprehend this?\n\nAmong the myriad scrolls of texts, only those that can extend a person’s years and augment their lifespan are true scriptures; the rest are not. Among the texts filling a chamber, only those that can secure the heart of heaven and bring about equitable governance are true scriptures; the rest are not. Among the ministers filling the court, only those who delight in their ruler and assist them in achieving Great Peace are the true ministers and worthy officials of the emperor; the rest are merely functionaries. Among the children a person bears, only those whose parents constantly enjoy their joy and suffer neither hunger nor cold are filial and virtuous; the rest are but numbers to be filled. Among the accumulated prescriptions and heavy carts of remedies, only those that can all extend years are true formulas; the rest are not.\n\nThe world abounds with such examples, too numerous to name or foretell. Perfected One, deeply ponder their meaning. My scripture, by inferring from one to ten thousand, suffices to illuminate the Dao of the world. Thus, I charge you, Perfected One, to transmit the Dao to the virtuous ruler, to examine and distinguish all common texts and the words of those who claim sagely writings, clearly demonstrating them to the multitude of worthies, so that all may together awaken and dispel delusion.\n\nOnce all common texts are examined and distinguished, the days of calamity will depart. For perverse texts and perverse words are the masters of treacherous disasters. True texts and true words are the officials who subdue treacherous evil. With true texts and true words, and with officials who rectify treachery, falsehoods will have no master and thus no place to abide. Perverse words as masters of treachery are like thieves who have a place to lodge; once the master perishes, thieves have no means to return and rest.\n\nIn practicing the model of the Dao of heaven, by inferring from one to ten thousand, the ten thousand cannot all be written. Excessive texts bewilder people; it is better to raise one guiding principle, so that the myriad strands arrange themselves and unfold. Thus, the clamor of ten thousand people is not equal to one emperor. The countless stars, myriad as they are, are not equal to the brightness of a single sun. The words of those who strive to support heaven and all below are not equal to one worthy and good person in the state. The Dao of heaven is vast and boundless, without limit, yet it is not equal to the primordial qi holding the guiding principle of heaven’s mandate.\n\nIf the worthy and virtuous ruler ponders my words, their lifespan will naturally lengthen. If later generations together ponder my words, fathers will be kind and sons filial, and this will daily expand and become clearer. Great and small will vie in doing good, and there will be no more violence. No longer will there be perverse texts or flatterers lurking in the state. Disasters and anomalies will be entirely eradicated, and the Three Luminaries will shine brightly. This is the natural art, which the Celestial Masters together purify.\n\nIn practicing the Dao thus, what harm could there be? Proceeding in this way as a model is the very movement of heaven. To record and preserve these writings is to contemplate the divine clarity of heaven and earth. The texts that verify this resonate with heaven and earth, forming a covenant of trust. Worthy rulers and the virtuous should together deliberate upon these words; those who practice them will daily flourish, aligning with the times to form a court that fulfills the desires of heaven and earth—thus, how auspicious!\n\nI, on behalf of the virtuous ruler of Great Peace, establish these models and measures, without limiting them to one person. When the qi of Great Peace arrives, if even one person remains aggrieved, unable to attain their desire, then the qi of the Supreme Sovereign and Great Peace cannot arrive together. Thus, heaven instructs me to broadly open the path, allowing each to freely choose what they may do.\n\nThose of wisdom and brightness who desire to live joyfully may study my scriptures, ponder their meaning, enter the chamber, and accomplish the Dao—they may attain life. Those of gentle virtue who desire to assist the emperor in governance may emulate my scriptures in their actions—they may bring about Great Peace. Those who desire to manage their households and engage in commerce may ponder my scriptures—they may complete their natural lifespan, each attaining their wishes without great grievance.\n\nThus, when the virtuous ruler governs, the qi of Great Peace arrives. The reason for this is that there are no aggrieved persons in the world; each attains what they desire. The worthy and enlightened virtuous ruler does not seize what others desire and must win the hearts of the world, desiring to comply with heaven’s will and return to it. The movement of heaven does not seize what people desire; the movement of earth does not seize what people desire. The enlightened ruler emulates this and thus achieves Great Peace.\n\nHeaven and earth, most divine, do not seize what others desire—how much less should humans? The divine persons of high antiquity admonished their disciples and later learners to cultivate good and model virtue, secretly aiding and benefiting people to ensure constant auspiciousness, their merit multiplied. Overt goodness is met with human responses and resolves. Covert goodness is known by heaven, earth, and all spirits, thus their merit is multiplied.\n\nThose who accumulate virtue are beloved by the wealthy, and their goodness naturally comes to them. What people praise, ghosts and spirits also praise, thereby aiding and assisting them. Those who love the Dao attain long life, sharing the concerns of yin and yang, following the movement of the August Spirit, the nature of heaven and earth, and attaining the principle of the Dao—thus, heaven protects them. Those who lose this disrupt heaven and do not love good people.\n\nSeeking goodness through goodness is nothing strange. Learning through benevolence is the beginning of the Dao; attaining it through virtue is the harmony of the Dao; attaining it through the Dao is the highest. I originally studied little but did not cease, concentrating my spirit and reflecting upon it, tears often falling. Through long accumulation, I received the great grace of August Heaven, and today I fortunately encountered the divine persons of heaven in the wilderness.\n\nAt the beginning of my studies, I was deficient, pondering and inquiring about trivial matters and superficial embellishments. Originally seeking the method of guarding the One and nurturing nature, I composed three hundred verses, only to see the Celestial Master expound without limit. Thus, I dared to ask: Can the tranquility of the body be attained and long life preserved?\n\nYou come to study and inquire on behalf of heaven; I suspect heaven has bestowed this upon you. I wish to hear the essential meaning—by what is this made clear?",

      "translated_text": "Now should a virtuous ruler obtain this scripture, comprehend it in heart, and practice it—discussing it with all worthy ministers to transform the common people—then surely a resonant response shall arise, which is its clear proof.\n\nMy Dao is perfected through precepts, not through false words or deeds. This is the decisive principle.\n\nI have long embraced this Dao, yet found none with whom to speak. Heaven’s grievances have knotted severely, and afflictions transform without cease. In this stifled impasse, how could the Celestial Master go forth and transmit it?\n\nIt is said: The position is not fitting. My office resides in heaven; the Perfected One’s office resides on earth. Those on earth bring forth the myriad things, thus heaven’s creations are nurtured upon the earth. Therefore, I transmit the Dao to the Perfected One. The earth gives birth to rulers, common folk, and the twelve thousand beings—all receive yang’s bestowal, emerging from within yin. Thus, you may transmit it to humankind.\n\nYou doubt the sincerity of my words. Though heaven issues its decrees, it does not speak directly to mortals—yet our intentions are one. This scripture bears heaven’s mandate, its clarity like cinnabar and ink.\n\nThis is the origin of heaven’s numbering. Thus, before heaven and earth divided, accumulated qi congealed as one, then split into two, forming husband and wife. Heaven’s bestowal descends to earth, conceiving in the dark mystery, named as *jiazi*. Its roots spread in the northeast, in *chou* and *yin*. It first appears in *mao*, completing the southeast in *chen* and *si*. Its branches hang in the south, nurtured at *wu*. Turning old in the southwest, in *wei* and *shen*. Maturing in the west, the sun sets in *you*. Fully concealed in the northwest, in *xu* and *hai*.\n\nThus, numbering begins at one and ends at ten, for this is the origin of the five thousand and the root of the five phases. Multiply one by ten, and a hundred is complete. Therefore, heaven generates within, and thus all things reach their end herein. The Dipper is established in *chen* and broken in *xu*. *Established* means to stand—thus all things desire to reach full growth. *Broken* means to decay—all things perish completely in *xu*.\n\nNumbering the eight directions of heaven and earth, ten completes the cycle. Yin and yang establish and break, thus this pattern recurs, following the Dipper’s pointer to illuminate affairs. This scripture is for dispelling harmful qi, thus it is said: “Model heaven as the standard.”\n\n*End of Tai ping jing chao, Ji Section, Scroll Six*\n*Tai ping jing chao, Geng Section, Scroll Seven*",

      "translated_text": "The *Admonition on the Diagram of the Void and Spontaneous Dao’s Necessary Fulfillment*\n\nThe void is inwardly replete yet outwardly empty—being as if non-being. Reverse the womb and embryo to dwell with the Dao. Preserve only the heart, suspending dragon-like contemplation. Thus it becomes the spirit-chamber, gathering the Dao in emptiness. Roam only with qi, hence the void. In qi and spirit, all else is eliminated. With the heart as master, one attains freedom from deviation. Examine its meaning closely, never forgetting the true scripture. Attain this, and you transcend the world, roaming long within it. Why not refine your essence, only to remain with fools? Once misfortune arrives, great disaster befalls. Abandon true simplicity, and you revert to dust and ash. The wise heed the scripture’s admonition.\n\nNon-action is non-action that accomplishes all, linking with the Dao. It emerges before infancy, enters the seamless, and reaches the Great Beginning, then returns. At heaven and earth’s inception, yin and yang had their source. Enter the art of non-action, and the body may be preserved whole. To depart from root and branch is the Dao’s affliction. To leave the Great Beginning is to forfeit wholeness. The farther one strays from life, the nearer to death’s gate. Indulging in vulgar learning harms the soul and spirit. Clinging to duality while forgetting the One loses their mutual resonance. Can one not be admonished? This is the Dao’s origin.\n\nYou, who guard the One exclusively, are the wellspring of benevolence and wisdom. Heaven’s Dao moves as One, thus it remains complete. Earth’s Dao moves as Two, and neighbors with ghosts. Truly know non-action, and you align with the Dao’s utmost spirit. Reflect deeply on this matter—the perfected ones preceded you. Seal your golden gate, allowing nothing to depart. In silence without sound, the spirit endures, and qi is perfected. The gate of immortal Dao is thus attained. How effortless! The Great Dao is no longer burdensome. Heaven’s Dao, impartial, returns to the benevolent and wise.\n\nThe law of spontaneity links with the Dao. Guard it, and fortune follows; lose it, and calamity arises. All things arise self-complete, one root with myriad branches, none without spirit. Ponder its meaning, and the Dao reveals itself. Together they emerge from primal chaos through the wondrous gate, neither increasing nor diminishing, preserving spontaneity.\n\nAll things born possess spirit, and of the eighteen hundred breaths, humans are supreme. Thus one may avoid death and attain long-lasting transcendence. Those who perish early lose spontaneity—even birds and beasts endure, let alone humans. Fools despise the Dao, sinking to earth’s depths. The benevolent and wise esteem the Dao, ascending heaven’s gate. The spirit-Dao does not die; ghosts and spirits meet their end.\n\nShould you pursue this, it is like a ring without end. Beware of entering the realm of being, lest you invite harm. Neither act recklessly nor abandon restraint, lest you hasten death. Heaven and earth’s nature uniquely honors spontaneity. Each follows its course—none dare oppose it.\n\nThe Dao flourishes through non-action, the void and spontaneity. The lofty delight in it; the base disregard it. Study diligently and know your teacher—no words are forbidden. With a teacher, the Dao is clear; without one, transmission is difficult. Learning without a master’s instruction, the noble remain silent. Reckless action brings chaos; self-mutilation invites misfortune.\n\nWhen the Dao is fully prepared, spontaneity is achieved. The three Daoist scriptures are all derived from collective deliberation, taken as heaven’s trust, and their resonance brings swift efficacy. To rectify the spirit and numinous, the decision rests with the illumination of ten thousand people, taken as heaven’s trust. To correct ordinary texts, the decision rests with collation, taken as heaven’s trust.\n\nThose who wish to know the truth of this scripture may verify it through swift insight. Practice it, and it will resonate with heaven. The good will flourish daily; the evil will diminish, taken as heaven’s trust. To appoint worthy individuals, the decision rests with nine people. To discern who has entered the chamber and who has not, the decision rests with absolute clarity—no concealment or obstruction, taken as heaven’s trust.\n\nTo know if one’s body has attained the Dao and become deathless, the decision rests with the body’s transformation into spirit, thus transcending the world, taken as heaven’s trust. To thoroughly understand the meaning of this scripture, read it from beginning to end, then reflect inwardly. The heart will comprehend fully, and doubt will vanish. Once its meaning is grasped, it cannot be abandoned.\n\nTo test the efficacy of this scripture and distinguish truth from falsehood, apply it to govern toward Great Peace, taken as heaven’s trust. To know whether longevity is attainable, the decision rests with the era after Great Peace. If Great Peace has not yet come, prior generations’ disasters will cause harm, making efficacy difficult, taken as heaven’s trust.\n\nFor the Grand Yang to know Great Peace, the decision rests with the severing of metal. For water and fire to suppress and eliminate treacherous ministers and malevolent forces, the decision rests with the severing of metal and the decline of market wine. To see the great flourishing of heaven’s Dao, the decision rests with collating all texts and consulting with ordinary people.\n\nTo obtain efficacious medicine, collate all medical texts and test them. To hasten Great Peace, reveal all true texts and eliminate false ones. To delight in humanity and cease harming women, the decision rests with each residing in their place, providing according to their ability, ensuring parents are not burdened with sorrow or rebellion.\n\nTo eliminate illness and widely open the Dao, the decision rests with swallowing the cinnabar script’s characters. To know the method of compiling and practicing the scriptures, follow the text and emphasize its admonitions. Restrain yourself well, practice for a day, and a hundred harms will vanish from the heart. In an instant, all will be rectified, taken as heaven’s trust.\n\nMay I ask: what is the name of auspicious omens? Why do you persist in folly?",

      "translated_text": "Would the Heavenly Master not abandon me and grant me but a single word of instruction?\n\nAs for auspicious omens: they are purity, stillness, rectitude, and singular devotion—where the heart aligns with heaven and earth, never transgressing the seasons’ decrees.\n\nMay I ask: by what means can one know this purity, stillness, rectitude, and singular devotion?\n\nExcellent is your question. The nature of heaven and earth, from ancient times to the present, is such that the good bring forth goodness, the wicked bring forth wickedness, the upright bring forth uprightness, and the perverse bring forth perversity. This is the natural principle—nothing strange in it.\n\nThus, when the human heart is upright, pure, and still, and sincerity moves heaven, without any ill intent, auspicious responses and good omens converge, and so auspicious omens arise. Those who employ deceitful and false hearts in all matters of perversity receive no good response—this is the great and luminous proof of heaven and earth. Do you understand?\n\nGood and evil each have their responses. Those who fail to harmonize bring about disharmony—this is the clear evidence of heaven.\n\nExcellent. May I ask: when people do good—supreme filial children, supreme loyal ministers, supreme obedient disciples—what should they hold in highest regard toward their lord, father, and teacher? It is to present rare treasures, texts seldom seen, and thereby attain the highest.\n\nLoyal ministers, filial children, and obedient disciples should always delight in such deeds. Why then do they not present what is commonly known, but instead present what is rare?\n\nWhat is commonly known, the superior already possesses—why present it again?\n\nThis foolish student does not grasp the meaning.\n\nI shall soon make it clear to you.\n\nWhat the world deems rare and precious—things never before seen and yet of great worth—when presented to one’s lord, this is the act of a supremely loyal minister. Rare and excellent food never before seen, when presented to one’s parents, this is the act of a supremely filial child. Teachings never before heard, when presented to one’s teacher, this is the act of a supremely good disciple. Do you understand?\n\nI would hear of presenting what is already held in common.\n\nWhat the superior already possesses, yet is presented again—why?\n\nBecause all things respond accordingly, such repeated presentation does not remove the fault. Why is it so weighty?\n\nYou should not fail to understand: what people already possess in common, to present it again is wearisome—why present it once more?\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, the great sages’ determination in all matters has been to discard the common and select the rare, thereby aligning with the will of heaven and earth. This is what is meant.\n\nHeaven has two hands, and by them all things are accomplished. If one hand is afflicted with perversity and evil, nothing can be achieved. Heaven greatly resents this; earth regards it as taboo. The world falls into chaos and accomplishes nothing, all due to one hand’s perversity failing to join in effort.\n\nIn all matters, if not properly ordered, the six directions will not attain Great Peace—this too arises from the two hands, when one is afflicted with perversity and fails to join in effort. The fortune or misfortune, safety or peril that ensue all stem from these two hands.\n\nPerfected One, do you truly comprehend this deeply?\n\nWere it not for the Heavenly Master revealing its essential meaning, how could one come to know it? Those who know it remain in eternal darkness and confusion, with no way to attain understanding.\n\nThe teacher is the root of all instruction in heaven and earth’s myriad affairs—though difficult, how could one refrain from speaking of it?\n\nExcellent indeed are the Perfected One’s inquiries.\n\nIn essence, it is but □□. Be seated, and I shall explain its meaning fully for all Perfected Ones.\n\nLet the world model itself upon this and act accordingly, and no more inauspicious or chaotic affairs will arise. The gods of heaven summon and inscribe the two hands as a crucial record. When a nation practices this, it endures long; when ordinary people practice it, they enjoy lasting wealth and peace.\n\nThe essential Dao is about to emerge, near at hand within the body of every person. Now I shall distinguish and explain it for the Perfected Ones.\n\nHeaven and earth are the two hands that create and bring forth all things. The four seasons are the two hands that transmit and nourish all beings. Husband and wife are the two hands that transmit and continue the yin and yang of heaven and earth. Teacher and disciple are the two hands that transmit and communicate all matters of texts, the Dao, and virtue. Ruler and minister are the two hands that transmit and govern all matters concerning the people and the myriad things.\n\nThese six matters merely lift the guiding principles and reveal their beginnings—there is no end to what could be written. All things that require mutual support to be accomplished are the two hands. In heaven, this is called \"overlapping compasses and repeated squares\"—all things that correspond to one another.\n\nIf one hand is perverse and unequal, nothing is accomplished. In heaven, this is called \"the governance of great chaos.\" In the six directions and eight distant regions, it is called \"widows and widowers, severed lineages,\" and the days grow ever more degenerate. Nothing is accomplished because the two hands do not join in effort.\n\nMay I ask: why in heaven are they called the two hands?\n\nThe two hands signify their equal and joint effort, with no advance or retreat—only then can things be accomplished. If the two hands do not join in effort, nothing can be achieved.\n\nThus, in all matters, one must model them upon these two hands, each finding the right person to join in effort and unite in heart. Only then can this model bring peace, and the qi of Great Peace will immediately arrive. Without modeling upon these two hands, even after ten thousand myriad years, the qi of the Supreme Sovereign’s Great Peace cannot emerge.\n\nThe qi of Great Peace constantly desires to emerge, like heaven itself. Yet because the two hands have long failed to harmonize and govern, it remains blocked and unable to flow forth, pent up and resentful—all due to the two hands’ disharmony.\n\nIf the two hands are balanced and harmonious, the qi of the Supreme Sovereign’s Great Peace emerges, arriving one after another without delay.\n\nExcellent.\n\nThus, if heaven and earth do not join in effort, the myriad things have no way to emerge. If the four seasons do not join in effort, all beings have no way to grow. If the five phases do not join in effort, all things have no way to be completed. If ruler and minister do not join in effort, all affairs have no way to be governed. If husband and wife do not join in effort, descendants have no way to flourish, and the family way has no way to be established. If teacher and disciple do not join in effort, no knotted affairs can be untangled, the Dao and virtue have no way to flourish, the mists of ignorance have no way to disperse, and the great transformation of the six directions and eight distant regions has no way to proceed.\n\nTherefore, all must join in effort, just as the two hands—only then can things flow smoothly. Without modeling upon the two hands, misfortune arises, and though one may seek remedies, it is of no benefit—nothing can be accomplished.",

      "translated_text": "Yet mere emptiness and prolonged sorrow bring only daily misfortune. Thus, in all matters resembling these two hands, selection and appointment must secure the right person. To fail in this is called \"half-dead\" by the gods above—how can one succeed or accomplish anything by acting with but a single hand? In all doubtful matters, ponder deeply this principle.\n\nWith a heart of sincerity—born of fire—return it to fire. In governing, model yourself thus, and you shall prolong your years and increase your allotted span, never failing even once. I do not deceive you. This is shown to the virtuous lord, to all people, and to the wise, each to reflect upon its meaning, that none dare transgress it. To employ it is called enriching and nurturing oneself; to neglect it is called bringing sorrow and suffering upon oneself. How wondrous!\n\nThe Dao I transmit conveys the will of Heaven. It may only advance, never retreat; only follow, never oppose. To follow is to fully attain Heaven’s favor; to oppose is to invite disorder and calamity. When human intent turns west while Heaven’s intent turns east, it is called discord with Heaven’s will. Let this be a warning to those who would understand.\n\nNow, when common people recommend scholars to present to the emperor, entrusting them to the state, securing the right person brings great fortune, while failing to do so brings great misfortune. What can be achieved with the right person? What ruin follows without them? All perfected ones must be precise and forthright in this.\n\nThus, securing the right person brings four blessings, while failing to do so brings four calamities. With the right person, Heaven and Earth, the six directions and eight distant regions are at peace; without them, they are not.\n\nWould you hear the essential meaning? When the recommended scholar is the right person, the ruler above is well-governed, affairs succeed, and constant peace prevails—daily benefiting the ruler: this is the first great blessing. The recommended person is capable and can be entrusted with office: the second blessing. Having become capable, they illuminate the Way of their teacher, extending grace to them: the third blessing. The recommended person proves trustworthy in their duties, further earning the ruler’s trust and employment: the fourth blessing. Joining in effort and with a single heart, their deeds daily succeed, monthly grow more illustrious, and yearly flourish ever more. Heaven and Earth rejoice, good omens appear in full, evil things withdraw, and the gods delight. Holding fast without fail, one may ascend to transcend the world, attain equitable governance in the middle realm, or below, preserve wholeness and complete one’s natural lifespan. Such is the goodness of recommending the right person.\n\nIn Heaven above, this is called the Talisman of Continuing Life. Why is it named the Talisman of Continuing Life? Because recommending the right person transforms danger into safety, chaos into order, failure into success, misfortune into fortune, and death into life. Above, one may transcend the world; in the middle, attain governance and peace; below, complete one’s natural lifespan and preserve one’s body.\n\nYet if the recommended scholar is not the right person, they bring no benefit to the emperor or the state, plunging governance into disorder. The emperor suffers in every way, Heaven and Earth are displeased, and thieves, bandits, and myriad disasters arise: this is the first great calamity. The recommended person cannot govern their office, deceit and falsehood daily increase, and long-standing unrest ensues. They cannot preserve their natural lifespan, may be harmed by Heaven and Earth’s spirits, or murdered by others, bringing disgrace to their parents and spreading evil to their wives, children, and descendants—known as a wicked person for their faults: this is the second great calamity. Their wickedness leads to the abandonment of their learning, defiling the sacred work of former sages and bringing disaster to their teacher: the third great calamity. Moreover, the recommender is untrustworthy, deceiving their ruler, presenting the wrong person, disrupting Heaven’s order, and defiling the constellations. Heaven detests them, Earth resents them, the ruler despises them, and sages condemn them—called a great deceiver and liar of the age. For this, they shall be punished: if not by Heaven, Earth, and the spirits, then by people. Their ancestors are disgraced, and disaster befalls their wives and children: this is the fourth great calamity.\n\nTo commit these four great calamities by recommending the wrong person brings sorrow to the emperor. Harmful qi stirs and cannot be restrained; disorder spreads without end, each fault compounding the last. Heaven and Earth grow furious, ministers contend, the six directions are displeased, the eight distant regions fall into discord, and eternal disorder ensues. In Heaven above, this is called the Talisman of Diminished Years and Shortened Life. Why is it named the Talisman of Shortened Life? Because order reverts to disorder, long years become few, and all undertakings meet misfortune, bringing no benefit to oneself. Heaven and Earth are displeased, deducting from one’s allotted span and diminishing one’s years—thus, it is called the Talisman of Shortened Life in Heaven above.\n\nExcellent indeed! This celestial text is shown to the virtuous lord, to all people and the wise, extending even to the common folk.",

      "translated_text": "When one in high position seeks worthy officers, one must be meticulous; when one in low position recommends them, one must be loyal. If later generations transmit and recite this text, treasuring it in their hearts, yet hastily appoint officers without adhering to its principles, Heaven and Earth will no longer be pleased. To know the Way yet deliberately violate it—how severe will the punishment be! Take heed.\n\nThis celestial text resolves the Six Extremities, gathering the great assembly of Heaven above. In the eighth month, the books are reviewed, mirroring the laws of Heaven and Earth to eliminate disasters and harms. Only the Dao of highest antiquity, wherein one cultivates the self and rectifies one’s conduct, dares not transgress what the divine spirits have transgressed, yet dares to seek life and plead for survival from the Heavenly Lord. One dares not act wantonly, fearing imperfection. Daily, one contemplates the vitality of life, becoming one with the divine spirits, manifesting their kind. Desiring to receive words of utmost loyalty and integrity, one clarifies right and wrong with the spirits governing all departments, then dares to trust in the principles of justice and injustice—how could there be a moment’s forgetfulness?\n\nAbove, there are those who observe humanity, fully discerning right and wrong. What can be concealed? What can be disbelieved? Thus, one attains self-governance, seeking and reflecting on the root. Never has there been the slightest boundary of unvirtuous conduct. One merely cherishes being human, relying on and revering the primordial qi, enabling all creeping and moving creatures to avoid witnessing calamities and anomalies.\n\nYet people betray trust in their sworn words, neither party believing the other, hence the lack of peace. Within the harmony of Heaven and Earth, above and below each maintain their trust, but people fail to grasp its essence. Humans consume the qi of the Five Constants, receiving and relying on nothing they do not partake of, yet losing goodness and following evil, their lives incomplete—why is this so? Thus, the Heavenly Lord declares that there is always good and evil, and those who ought to uphold justice. Therefore, errors and evils clarify the intent of Heaven and Earth, the Four Seasons, and the Five Phases, enabling understanding that the completion of life is paramount, extending one’s years and lifespan. People attain the Dao of life and completion, adhering to its prohibitions without negligence.\n\nFrom this, it is clear that Heaven knows the foolish are shallow, lacking any intent of requital. To oppose Heaven’s actions is to contradict its works, amplifying human misdeeds—reversing the proper order to condemn the living and favor the wicked. Thus, the sage understands the convergence of yin and yang, the worthy govern right and wrong, resolving what is unknown, enabling each to fulfill their duty without resentment. The good naturally enjoy long life; the evil naturally suffer short lives—what is there to doubt or resent?\n\nThe virtuous inscribe the writings of goodness, not losing their pattern, their constancy, or their appropriateness—this is called supreme virtue. Nothing is left unaccomplished, nothing unachieved. They do not lose their clarity, their substance, the generation and completion of yin and yang, the ingress and egress of the life-generating qi governed by the Four Seasons, the completion of the Five Phases, the celestial bodies of sun, moon, and stars, their measurements, the timing of fortune and misfortune, the transformations of calamities and anomalies, the records of floods and droughts, or the length of human life—nor do they lose the intent of the thickness or thinness bestowed by the constellations. This is what the supremely virtuous ought to practice.\n\nThus, the virtuous person illuminates all, sees all, harmonizing above, below, and the center, each according with its proper place. Following their virtue, none lose their rightful name—this is called aligning with constancy. The writings of long life bestow glory upon all things: rocks split and sprout, branches hang and leaves spread to serve as clothing, mist, dew, snow, frost, and timely rain serve as drink and food. Growth and completion occur naturally, covering and bearing blossoms and fruit, providing for the people and the earth’s longevity. Named the \"water mother\" and called \"melon\" by the people, in the height of summer it serves as water and broth, relied upon by all under Heaven, consumed by all.\n\nSuch is the virtuous person who inherits Heaven’s mandate, completes Heaven’s form, and looks to Earth to provide for the people’s sustenance. Practicing reflection and bestowing generosity, none are left without virtue to satiate themselves—this is Heaven’s grace. What Heaven bestows to generate life is vast. To disobey its mandate and speak of spontaneity is to rebel.\n\nThus, the virtuous person, understanding Heaven’s intent, teaches the people to establish laws without losing Heaven’s favor, nurturing and raising them to maturity, enabling them to become human, to comprehend patterns and principles, to cultivate virtue and achieve completion, and to ascend to the ranks of Heaven’s officers. In Heaven’s affairs, merits and labors are differentiated.\n\nThe virtuous person, presiding over Earth’s affairs, commands the people to rely on and revere, deeply witnessing grace and bestowal, yet unable to requite it in due time. When the virtuous act on Heaven’s behalf, moving qi above, below, and at the center, those who do not receive their proper place scorn Heaven’s works. This is precisely what provokes Heaven’s unceasing wrath, causing the divine spirits to cease loving humanity, encroaching upon and seizing their years and lifespan. People then resent and blame Heaven, so the divine texts are sent down to prevent transgressions.\n\nWhen one receives great kindness, even a single contrary thought or effort to do good is sufficient. Yet if one remains long in doubt and suspicion, clinging to past grievances, one harms oneself, living in constant dread, unaware of the cause. Heaven endows humans with knowledge of good and evil, and those who practice goodness with sincerity—Heaven does not wish people to have an evil reputation. Thus, desiring to cling to life and abhor death, one dares not violate prohibitions, as if they were harmful to oneself.\n\nTherefore, following the qi of Heaven and communicating with the words of the enlightened, one speaks of the body’s comings and goings, understanding human sentiments. Seeing unvirtuous conduct, one retreats and self-reproaches, fearing that one’s name may be sullied in the celestial records. As one’s intentions at the time are applied to others, one dares not face them directly to explain complexities, but accepts the reproach for one’s actions. Striving to reflect, one considers the progress of one’s merits from birth, resolving the inherited burdens of one’s ancestors. When these burdens are removed and resolved, and transgressions exhausted, one may ascend.\n\nTo alternate between good and evil is to toy with one’s fate. Moreover, the good ought to endure temporary hardship, applying effort without negligence, and later receive blessings. When life speaks of enduring trials, accepting admonitions, and retiring to a tranquil place to reflect on one’s faults and self-reproach—these thoughts arise from within, and the celestial spirits know them. Do not grow weary. To foresee the Heavenly Lord’s intentions and actions is to be the foremost person, worthy to stand at the Heavenly Lord’s left side.",

      "translated_text": "Those with meritorious deeds receive rewards, yet in humility dare not advance to accept greater benefits, instead exhausting their sinews and strength, applying their minds with utmost care for the great Dao. Thus, the Heavenly Lord values them anew, personally admonishing and instructing them—this is the blessing of life. To govern many with an impartial heart is sufficient in itself. To say, \"I dare not,\" is to aspire to stand at the Heavenly Lord’s left side, merely to live on.\n\nOnly think of loyalty and filial piety, following principle to fulfill one’s duty. Dare not accept heavy rewards, fearing one’s lack of merit. Upon hearing of another’s transgressions, aid them in repentance. Examine and restrain one’s conduct, preventing violations, and contemplate the Heavenly Lord’s will. Knowing goodness, act with goodness; knowing trustworthiness, act with trustworthiness; knowing loyalty, act with loyalty; knowing compliance, act with compliance; knowing filial piety, act with filial piety—thus, evil deeds shall no longer advance. No transgression, great or small, escapes the Heavenly Lord’s knowledge. The register of good and ill is thinly inscribed, and each year, month, and day, accounts are tallied before and after. Years are deducted, lifespan reduced; if evil persists unceasingly, one faces the Ghost Gate. The Earth Spirit summons and interrogates, comparing their deeds and words for consistency. After painful reflection upon principle, only then do they submit. Their name is sent to the celestial bureaus, and when their allotted tally is exhausted, they are cast into the ranks of the Great Transgressors, drifting through later generations—such is the consequence of evil.\n\nOne desires to gain advantage from others, yet others do not wish to advantage them. Good advantage brings life; evil advantage is short-lived, for goodness does not long abide upon the earth. Thus, Heaven and Earth’s advantages are not evenly distributed. Heaven causes one to act with goodness, bestowing life, yet one turns to evil—how can the spirits and gods not afflict them with suffering? Whom can they blame? This text thus first advances goodness and retreats from evil—an ancient and enduring scripture.\n\nLife’s mandate lies close within your own body—why knock upon your heart and cry out to Heaven? If your body does not purify itself, whom shall you purify? If your body does not cherish itself, whom shall you cherish? If your body does not perfect itself, whom shall you perfect? If your body does not reflect upon itself, whom shall you reflect upon? If your body does not reproach itself, whom shall you reproach? Ponder these words: do not resent the spirits and gods. For evil, you alone bear the burden, not others—do you understand this?\n\nAct in accordance with what has been said, and let it never depart from your heart. Departure from it is ruin, irreparable, and you shall share the ranks of ghosts—how then shall you live? To reflect upon life is to attain life. How can one, dwelling between Heaven and Earth, forget the grace of Heaven and Earth? What manner of being is this? If you desire Heaven’s recompense, you must reproach yourself with sincerity and sorrow, weeping as you act, saying, \"I, favored by grace, am made human, distinct from the myriad things. Heaven has granted me distinction—speech, perception of beauty and ugliness, knowledge of good and evil, right and wrong. I must be meticulous in my conduct.\" To speak words contrary to Heaven’s decree, refusing compliance, is to be a person of great treason and impiety—how could Heaven long abide with such a one?\n\nIf the admonitions received remain unclear, retire to a quiet place to reflect, reproaching yourself for the burdens you bear, and offering thanks to the spirits of Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, the Five Phases, and all the divine departments. The Heavenly Lord listens keenly, bidding you to ponder within. The people of antiquity all possessed wisdom and foresight, dared not transgress prohibitions, and regulated themselves with rectitude, fearing any lapse. At every movement, they acted in accordance with the mandate, lest they lose their years and lifespan. For this reason, they dared not slacken even slightly. For every transgression, there was punishment, and thus they examined and cherished themselves, revering prohibitions and daring not act contrary to the will. When reproached and questioned, their hearts trembled with fear, their qi dispirited and lost, bearing the displeasure of Heaven. Even the slightest misalignment was deemed unworthy, and the text’s complexity often led to thorough investigation and verification. Their words and trustworthiness could be named as honor, and throughout life, they yearned and aspired, aligning with Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, and the Five Phases, bearing the mandate together, daring not commit even the smallest error.\n\nTruly, with the heart, one seeks advancement and searches for life. Only the great spirits review and approve one’s words, allowing one to witness the Four Seasons and Five Phases in their generation and transformation, and to see the difficulty of repaying the sun and moon. One fears being cast aside midway. Those who rightly cultivate the Dao dare not distance themselves, for the Way of the ancient sages arose naturally. Knowing the principles of Heaven above, all their actions are foreknown. Even the faintest sound and echo are understood, and their form and countenance are self-evident. Their hearts are luminous, their intentions clear. They know the matters to be saved, the meetings of fortune and misfortune—all is distinctly apparent. Within, their hearts rejoice, for they know they have received Heaven’s blessing. Witnessing the events of their past conduct, they are all the more vigilant and steadfast.\n\nReflecting that they have been favored and honored, the great spirits repeatedly admonish and instruct them, ensuring they do not falter. Gazing to the four horizons, above and below all is open and unobstructed. Within their hearts, they rejoice anew, gaining extended years and hearing what was previously unknown—all through the transforming power of the Heavenly Lord and the great spirits. The great spirits declare: \"All the spirits know this. Those whose lives are extended have their fate recorded in the true registers. Before birth, their years, months, days, and hours are inscribed in the Bureau of Longevity. When the appointed time arrives, their names ascend, and their deeds are proclaimed, governed by the Perfected of the Northern Culmen. Their bones are transformed, their bodies become light and lustrous. At the appointed hour, they receive the elixir, refining their essence and brilliance. Wherever they manifest, all is accomplished. They emerge from the profound and enter the obscure—what is not accessible to them?\"\n\nOnly those of antiquity who attained the Dao followed this method. Before birth, their names were recorded in the registers of longevity. When the year, month, day, and hour of their ascension arrive, their names are transmitted to the Central Culmen. The Central Culmen is also called Kunlun, where the governing spirits record their names without omission. They are made to move their limbs, bending and stretching, turning and complying, repeatedly admonished. Following their master through trials, they are given the elixir to drink. Their joints open and are refined. Though not immediately apparent, over time, one knows whether they are firm or not, demonstrating their unyielding resolve.\n\nCraving life and detesting death, they contemplate the affairs of Heaven above. Repeatedly, they are sent to verify the allotted years, to know the prohibitions they must observe. These are transmitted to disciples, and even without divine texts, they speak as if presenting their own books. The spirits know their words, which are also connected to the years and months. After accumulating one thousand three hundred and twenty days, they are led to meet the great spirits, to communicate with the primordial qi, and to act in accordance with nature.",

      "translated_text": "The Heavenly Lord receives the secret decrees and examines conduct, permitting no private trust or wavering of intent, ensuring no errors in action. The Great Spirits declare: \"We have calculated the provisions bestowed by all spirits. On the last day of the eighth month, we record the registers of all mountains, seas, ridges, and pools, as well as the waterways, rivers, bridges, Huai, Ji, Yangtze, and lakes—all accounts of ingress and egress—each clearly distinguished.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Lord, when bestowing rewards for labor, personally reviews and verifies the records stored in the golden chambers. Those of sincere heart are appointed to attend the Heavenly Lord’s inquiries, and they must heed the teachings day and night without slackening. The appointed overseers must not fail in their duties, and those of sincere heart must ensure the registers are settled.\n\nThere are spirit-envoys who calculate the names of those destined to ascend. One hundred days prior, all documents must be submitted without omission. If any document is inconsistent or the accounting office fails to act, all involved shall be held accountable. The prior decree forbade transgressing the divine texts. Three years and eight months after this text’s issuance, it may be shown to the common people. If there are those of Daoist faith, it may be revealed to them.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord instructs: \"This person bore prior burdens, and the decree commands the spirits to resolve and conceal them. Those not yet concealed shall be concealed.\" The Great Spirits say: \"This person has long suffered poverty and emptiness, fearing they cannot endure. Having gained the Heavenly Lord’s trust, the spirits are ordered to conceal their fate.\"\n\nThose who previously received decrees and expressed gratitude for the grace—though the appointed time has not yet arrived—shall be informed one month in advance. The Heavenly Lord declares: \"Among the spirits, generals, soldiers, and armor under my command below, do not miss the appointed time for concealment. Record their names, so the earthly lords may show reverence, and spirits may come and go. If they seek to fulfill their wishes, permit it. Let future affairs turn from evil toward good, avoiding transgressions, so they may again behold the Dao’s teachings and transformations, none disobeying.\"\n\nThus, the overseers are made wings to guide the beginning and end, completing their tasks like fortified cities, clearly discernible. Knowing the great transformations above and harmonizing the primordial *qi*, they also understand human affairs. These are people of fortune and destiny, all foreknown. Following their transformations, their allotted years may be extended, and Heaven cherishes them. Benevolent spirits guard them, shielding them from harm. Their hearts incline toward goodness, and evil cannot claim them.\n\nThus, Heaven values goodness, allowing wishes to be fulfilled without encroachment or conflict, as it should be. Heaven further extends their years, bestowing this great favor. Repayment is not in jewels or treasures but in writing sincerity, returning to earnest faith, and not betraying one’s words—this is repayment.\n\nWhen Heaven witnesses good deeds, they must be concealed, not shared, for fortune and misfortune follow. Only those who align with the great sagely and virtuous may receive the primordial *qi*’s natural radiance, moving the Great Spirits. They fully understand what is to be bestowed, always aligning with Heaven’s will, never losing the intent of the primordial *qi*. They constantly act above to assist the Great Spirits, like ministers serving a state. Their hearts know the Great Spirits’ directives, and the documents they submit are interconnected. Each memorial is fittingly presented, and the right person is chosen to safeguard their words. They act on the Heavenly Lord’s behalf, and upon receiving the texts, they transmit them without delay, receiving the grace of audience above.\n\nThe Great Sage should know: How could the Heavenly Lord’s decrees ever fail? The worldly do not understand, assuming it is like mortal officials—how could they know the celestial decrees and their proper transmission? In Heaven’s affairs, voices carry across distances—how could anything be hidden? This is naturally scrutinized, and thus the Heavenly Lord foreknows day and night, within Heaven, Earth, and the harmony between, all great and small, even the most secret matters. How could the spirits act freely?\n\nThus, the beginning and end of good and evil are recorded, and the spirits document them. The Heavenly Lord personally follows the monthly and stellar configurations, governing without fail, all rectified and untransgressed. Thus, it is said Heaven sends forth its decrees.\n\nThe spirit within the human abdomen sees afar and communes with Heaven, their voices heard—how could they not know the people’s good and evil? The Heavenly Lord says: \"Those with good faith are elevated; those without are demoted. Not only Heaven desires the faithful—so too does the harmony of Earth below.\" People do not deeply understand future affairs, so those of sincere heart must persevere. Persevering, they walk the same path as the Great Spirits, drawing near to Heaven. Like loyal ministers and virtuous officials who never leave their lord’s side—yet people do not trust Heaven. How could Heaven trust those of divided heart?\n\nThose who ascend to Heaven in broad daylight, seeking life with their names recorded, are listed in the Northern Culmen Heavenly Lord’s inner registers. How could the faithless be inscribed? Those of early and steadfast heart shall ultimately ride the refined *qi*, acting on Heaven’s behalf.\n\nWithin Heaven, Earth, and their harmony, all should follow Heaven’s grace to live—yet many disbelieve. This is the gravest sin; how can they hope the celestial spirits will take notice? If the worldly repent, toiling day and night, accumulating years, they may be pardoned and their names presented to the Heavenly Lord.\n\nThose who reproach themselves shall have their names transferred by the spirits of life’s register to the Bureau of Longevity, where the One Hundred and Twenty Envoys grant them continued generations. The poor shall have descendants. Those Heaven destroys have persisted in evil, harming others—thus, they are cut off",

These are transmitted to disciples, and even without divine texts, they speak as if presenting their own books. The spirits know their words, which are also connected to the years and months. After accumulating one thousand three hundred and twenty days, they are led to meet the great spirits, to communicate with the primordial qi, and to act in accordance with nature.",

      "translated_text": "Those of ancient times who attained immortality and transcended the world—how could they ever harbor evil thoughts? They beheld writings on loyalty and filial piety, revered and served their parents, lived in harmony with their siblings, and maintained no distinction between inner and outer. Above and below, all were united, aligning with Heaven’s great prohibitions. The Celestial Lord governs all, receiving mandates for fixed terms—how could one act with self-indulgence? A heart of loyalty and filial piety never strays from the will of Heaven and Earth, aiding the four seasons and the five phases, never daring to harm the living beings of their time.\n\nOnly the Most High’s benevolent ones act thus, accumulating deeds before Heaven. Heaven hears and trusts them, dispatching them to assist the Eastern August One in arranging all living things, bestowing blossoms and fruits to feed the people, ensuring warmth and sustenance. Their bodies grow robust, nurturing one another in turn; yin and yang unite, male and female take form, the old and young follow in succession, receiving their allotted lifespans from Heaven’s decree. The twenty-eight lunar lodges rotate in mutual completion, while the sun and moon illuminate without fail, taking turns to sustain life—how could there be any slackening?\n\nYet people do not know that lifespans vary in length, that spring, summer, autumn, and winter bring impermanence in life and death. Thus, the spirits oversee the shifting of destinies, increasing or decreasing the tally of years, passing them on in turn. Therefore, it is said that the four seasons, five phases, sun, moon, and stars all govern human life: the good have their years extended, the wicked have theirs diminished. The severity of transgressions is measured by fixed standards. Between Heaven above and Earth below, all is interwoven like inner and outer, with myriad spirits appointed to relay commands. Thus, when the Celestial Lord issues decrees to the bureaus, each transfers them in turn, serving as the current celestial tally—no private favor is permitted. From ancient times to the present, how could any escape?\n\nOnly the Most High’s virtuous ones act thus, for they discern the affairs Heaven and Earth are to carry out, each with its own charge, its own decree, its own cultivation, its own spirit, its own merit, its own loyalty, its own governance, its own bestowal upon others, its own path of advancement. Each gains the trust of Heaven and Earth, never straying from the generative and transformative work of the four seasons and five phases. Thus, the Most High’s virtuous ones receive Heaven’s trust, Earth’s protection, and the five phases’ confidence, never violating any prohibitions. They constantly aspire to perfect others, delighting in goodness, aligning with the will of Heaven and Earth’s divine spirits, penetrating from outer to inner, achieving success in their own bodies. They are inscribed in the register of long life and enduring vision, permitted to serve alongside Heaven and Earth’s great spirits. From loyalty and sincerity toward Heaven, they uphold the great transformation.\n\nThus, Heaven does not thwart human aspirations, nor does Earth deny human peace. Day and night, they reflect on karmic debts and burdens, fearing they may fail to meet the Celestial Lord’s expectations—how could they hesitate to repay with loyalty and filial piety? Only the Most High’s enlightened ones foresee Heaven’s affairs, knowing what to enact and what remains undone. Their actions arise naturally, determined by their conduct. Thus, they understand the inner and outer of good and evil, and all they do comes to fruition. Revering and emulating the divine, they perfect their merit and name their virtue. They commune with the great spirits in speech, walk the Dao, and advance their knowledge.\n\nOnly the Most High’s mindful ones each know their allotted domain, each with their own Dao, their own conduct, their own compliance, their own advancement, their own declarations, their own words, their own destinations, their own movements. Their hearts are bound within, constantly striving to fulfill loyalty and filial piety, truly serving Heaven. Accumulating deeds over the years, they never slacken or forget gratitude. They seek the Most High’s precepts to preserve their lives—how could they dare neglect the four directions? They submit to Heaven’s knowledge, their understanding extending to what is yet to come, their hearts fixed on the great spirits. In their advancement and declarations, they dare not rely on their own judgment, but constantly gather the spirits in counsel, discerning what may be adopted or not, ever fearful of failing to win the spirits’ trust.\n\nWhen Heaven prospers, nations descend in radiant submission. Former masters, sages, and the Dao of Heaven and Earth’s joyous spirits emerge to aid humanity, granting long life and driving back the four barbarians. The formless divine beings of old sought the Dao of life, aligning their aspirations with the primal *qi*, never losing its intent. Their illumination pervades the four directions; their soundless voices emerge and enter above and below, all in accord with the law. The spirits and refined *qi* all come of their own accord, attending to their countenance. Fearing to lose their favor, all under their charge tremble in reverence. Their robes and sandals transform to match their hearts, bestowing kindness and spreading grace. Their fame flows above and below, reaching the eight extremities beyond the four directions, extending even to the earliest sages. Covered by their vast kindness, all respectfully uphold their commands, moving the august spirits.\n\nMoving between Heaven and Earth, their light reaches the sun, moon, and stars, drawing brightness from before them. The twenty-eight lunar lodges proclaim in turn, examining the people’s use of the heavenly stems and earthly branches, the patterns of fortune and misfortune. Yet few people understand. Assuming themselves wise, their actions and rest bring no benefit to Heaven, inviting calamity and the severance of their lineage, leaving their ancestors without worship. When the three *qi* are not in harmony, those who admonish with goodness are favored; those who do not await their destined end beneath the earth, their misfortunes flowing to their descendants. This is Heaven’s decree—how can one escape?\n\nHeaven has its four pillars, Earth has its four pillars; thus, the sun and moon push one another in turn. The stars have their degrees and measures, illuminating right and wrong. People have their nobility and baseness, their lifespans long or short, receiving their mandate from the six *jia*. Birth comes early or late, good and evil reside in different places, not a fraction of an ounce is lost. Yet people of the world do not know this, assuming there is no truth. Only by harmonizing with the divine spirits can one be called human. Those who win the trust of the divine spirits, who gain Heaven’s response—Heaven’s spirits elevate them. Those who gain Earth’s response—Earth’s spirits nurture them. Those who gain the response of harmony—human and ghostly spirits protect them. Those who gain a good response—goodness matches goodness; those who gain an evil response—evil follows evil. All have their roots, pervading above and below.\n\nThose who wish for inherently good and unopposed people make them the *shi*-people. The spirits of the land desire good people. Each imposes prohibitions, communicating above with Heaven. Those who do evil and violate them bring ruin upon themselves.",

      "translated_text": "Officials, great or small, derive their authority from the people’s karmic conditions. They ought to clarify their duties and not become a source of suffering for the people. Those with exceptional abilities who cherish the Dao, virtue, benevolence, and kindness align with Heaven’s principles, Earth’s will, and the intent of harmony. They contemplate how to be seen by the good spirits, each maintaining their own integrity and never deceiving the ignorant. They do not violate Heaven’s prohibitions or Earth’s punishments, comply with the four seasons, and avoid the reputation of killing. The Five Phases each have their proper domains—let each guard its own.\n\nThose who cherish life receive Heaven’s protection; those who cherish nourishment receive Earth’s assistance; those who cherish benevolence are beloved by all. Those who do evil are Heaven’s enemies. Heaven knows their wickedness and sends malevolent spirits and vicious ghosts to enter their bodies, spreading through their limbs, head, face, abdomen, back, chest, flanks, and the Seven Governors. It ascends to the Hall of Light, manifesting in seventy-two forms—this is the gateway to death. Heaven cherishes human life; Earth cherishes human nourishment; people cherish human generosity. To do evil is to invite calamity that cannot be saved.\n\nThis is proclaimed in the Heavenly Scriptures. The words of the divine sages of antiquity never strayed from the fundamental principles; they had their own laws and standards, and people could not lightly transgress their prohibitions. Those in ancient times who attained the Dao of Great Peace simply upheld Heaven’s laws and did not violate its prohibitions—they became the peaceful subjects of the realm. Heaven possesses inexhaustible grain and boundless clothing; those who accumulate merit advance and receive their emoluments.\n\nIn the most ancient times, the divine sages foresaw future events and governed together with Heaven. They distributed authority across the four directions, above and below, and the center, each with its own jurisdiction. Above and below observed one another, and order was achieved without coercion—all was good. Fearing they might not align with Heaven’s will, Heaven sent forth its teachings, and they hastened to carry them out, each holding their records, aligning themselves without movement. Fearing inquiry, they acted with discipline, ensuring their conduct was proper. In spring, they cultivated qi; in summer, they fostered growth; in autumn, they gathered harvests so the people could offer sacrifices; in winter, they stored surplus grain to sustain continuity. Without slackening, the spirits’ bestowals brought glory to all, extending even to crawling creatures and plants—each received its due.\n\nThus, the wealthy were encouraged to lend and aid the poor, replacing the old with the new, enabling life and growth to be passed down to descendants. This was protected by the spirits—such was the great taboo. The officials of Heaven, Earth, the four seasons, the Five Phases, and the multitude of spirits directly oversee human destiny and emoluments. They must be revered and their kindness remembered and repaid.\n\nHasten to entrust this text to a virtuous ruler, so they may know Heaven’s love for humanity—and how humanity, in turn, fails to reciprocate. The *Dongji Jing*, known as the *Scripture of Great Peace*, brings fortune to those who practice it; those who do not will bring ruin upon themselves, their bodies never parting from suffering, for retribution is never unjust. Those who have long been remiss in this and have harmed others—people, regardless of status, are all born of Heaven. Love them, be cautious of them, think of them, and take care not to wrongfully harm or oppress others. Those who encroach and exploit will receive no response from Heaven, no sustenance from Earth, and malevolent spirits will follow them, cutting short their lives. The spirits of prayer and sacrifice will grow ever more enraged.\n\nWhen you see goodness, advance it; when you see evil, retreat from it. What doubt can there be? Each acts according to their own strength, lest the spirits lead them astray. If one’s dwelling is unsettled, they should leave the old for the new, and the spirits will return. Only Heaven and Earth, from their very beginnings, formed their essences, upholding the natural order. All that is transformed and generated thereby attains glory. Through this system, the mechanisms of the sun, moon, and stars govern the seasons, while the Five Planets each report to their respective directions, carrying out their duties, dispersing clouds and rain.\n\nThe people’s concerns are overseen by the Ministry of Agriculture, and the primordial qi gathers and lingers. All plants, crawling creatures, those that creep and slither, and those that breathe—all contain primordial qi. Birds that fly, beasts that run, and creatures of the water are the same, enabling the people to use them for sacrifices and sustenance. Those not used by the people are left for the animals to consume. Yet today’s wicked people kill indiscriminately, even those with child in the womb, turning the living into the dead to feed their mouths. At the moment of killing, all tremble in fear. Thus, Heaven, in its sincerity, pities them and establishes prohibitions; those who violate them are punished accordingly.\n\nEven the six livestock are cherished and not harmed without cause, yet people, who should value themselves, instead act as rebels and bandits, taking without restraint. Though they may not be immediately punished, their transgressions accumulate. Killing and destruction will not cease, leading to the annihilation of households and descent into ignominy. Even the unborn will not encounter fortune. The spirits pity them, and the overseers stand before them—when will they escape?\n\nThus, the weight of good and evil is recorded. The Perfected Ones share this text with the people, fearing it might be concealed, so they have adapted it to common script for clarity. Therefore, gain the trust of Heaven, gain the trust of Earth, gain the trust of harmony, and gain the trust of the Five Phases—all are the responses of Heaven’s trust. Not a fraction is lost—do you understand? This is the natural transformation of the qi entrusted to us.\n\nThe Three Terraces and Seven Stars assist in rectifying Heaven’s authority. The sun and moon illuminate right and wrong, ensuring each receives its natural retribution. Again, the commands are issued to all department heads, each to make their duties clear. Those who receive punishment have no cause for resentment—this is the meaning of it.\n\nThe records of disasters and calamities reappear every three *jiazi* cycles to restore order, but it would be better to admonish ten times so they may understand. Strive to seek knowledge and understanding—even the worthy and sagely can attain it. The sage should promote the worthy, seek life without evil, and then advance to the register of immortals and transcendents, located in the Northern Culmen, connected to Kunlun. The Perfected Ones of Kunlun’s ruins maintain constancy above and below, overseeing the registers of names, arranged in order. The high attain the high, the middling attain the middling, and the low attain the low. The first to arrive become teachers, revered as lords, honored as fathers. Thus, teachers, lords, and fathers must be enlightened; ministers must be loyal; disciples must be obedient, respecting and following their superiors.\n\nHeaven does not forget the teacher’s kindness; Earth does not forget the teacher’s nourishment; people do not forget the teacher’s generosity. Heaven employs the Three Luminaries to illuminate harmony, Earth, and the depths below, without ceasing.",

      "translated_text": "In a land devoid of virtue, yin qi obscures the sun, leaving it without light. The people live in fear, grain scarcely multiplies, and floods and droughts come without pattern, forcing them to wander toward fertile regions. Heaven takes pity on them, guiding them to dwell in places of vitality. Where there is an enlightened ruler, the state prospers; displaced people return to till abandoned fields, and all grains grow to ripeness. The people regain their sustenance, once more offering to their ancestors, and the spirits find peace.\n\nAmong them are the wise and sagacious who seek the registers and records of immortals and transcendents, where their names are inscribed. They are to become Heaven’s officers, traversing the land among the people, harmonizing wind and rain to bring stable governance. Through this text, they too shall be born into later generations. Thus, one must perform good deeds to benefit Heaven.\n\nFrom this point onward, admonish your descendants: the span of extended years may yet be attained. The text reiterates this, for Heaven deeply cherishes humanity and desires that all fulfill their natural lifespans. Its exhortations are earnest and repeated, entrusted to the spirits. The good are recorded above, while the wicked have their names forgotten. Do not defy this text; let its meaning dwell in your heart.\n\nIn Heaven above, there is a pattern—a root for seeking life. This is what people desire, and thus this text is set forth. If one has transgressions, let them repent in accordance with it. The divine spirits are ever before and behind you, without ceasing.\n\nWhen the qi of Great Peace arrives in full, people need only face one another in daily leisure, keeping musical instruments at hand as a constant practice. Through this, they harmonize and transform one another, benefiting the state above and bringing the qi of Heaven into balance. The world is permeated by its virtue and teaching, free from misfortune.\n\nIs harmony or disharmony not the proof of this? Those who align with the will of Heaven and Earth cause Heaven and Earth to harmonize, and people emulate this with joy. When Heaven, Earth, and humanity are in harmonious delight, all things are free from illness, and rulers and ministers remain in constant gladness. This is the arrival of the qi of Great Peace, the joy of music made complete.\n\nThus, when music attains the great *jue* and upper *jue* tones, the Azure Emperor rejoices greatly, and the virtue and power of benevolence emerge. All things delight in life, the liver’s qi is free from illness, and the liver spirit emerges from the East. Evil is entirely dispelled, while goodness advances to assist transformation. Azure-clad jade maidens bring rare remedies to bestow upon people—this is the clear proof.\n\nWhen the middle *jue* tone is attained, the transformation of water is balanced. When the lower *jue* is attained, it transforms the lower realms.\n\nWhen the *zhi* tones of the South, great and small, are all in harmony, all things rejoice in longevity. The virtue of the South knows no displeasure; evil descends and departs, while goodness advances entirely. The red qi rejoices fully, and the Vermilion Emperor comes to wander. The heart is free from illness, and the heart spirit appears, awaiting the arrival of red-clad jade maidens who bring rare remedies to bestow upon people—this is the proof.\n\nThus, when the harmony of the yellow qi and *gong* tones is attained, all good *gong* tones come forth, while evil is entirely dispelled. When the harmony of the *shang* tones is attained, all good *shang* tones come forth, while evil is entirely dispelled. When the harmony of the *yu* tones is attained, all good *yu* tones come forth, while evil is entirely dispelled.\n\nPerfected Ones, ponder this meaning deeply—it is what brings about Great Peace. The reason the five directions are not explained in full is that for the loftiest scholars, seeing one aspect allows them to grasp the whole, and comprehending one principle encompasses ten thousand. To reveal it fully might induce overwhelming joy. If lesser people were to obtain it, they might speak recklessly. Therefore, it is not fully disclosed, so that each may contemplate its meaning.\n\nThe highest scholars can take one principle to encompass ten thousand, thoroughly understanding its intent. The middling scholars may gradually come to know it, while the lowest scholars, if they obtain it, would only speak recklessly. Thus, the text presents the essentials in brief, outlining the matters to guide ordinary people, so they may ponder its meaning and thereby achieve understanding from top to bottom without error.\n\nTherefore, the highest scholars govern music to enact non-action and transcend the world; the middling scholars govern music to harmonize the customs of the people and bring order; the lowest scholars govern music merely to entertain people and summon sustenance. These three types of people each comprehend the arrival of the qi of Great Peace and follow their own pursuits, playing lutes and zithers as they will. Take care not to prohibit this, for prohibition stifles the qi of music, making governance difficult to pacify. If it is not pacified, qi contends and disputes arise, leading to excessive punishment.\n\nMusic brings joy, while punishment brings suffering—like echo and shadow, not a fraction is lost. Music is meant to quell anger, just as anger is meant to quell joy. These two alternate: when there is joy, anger ceases; when there is anger, joy ceases. Thus, anger gives rise to punishment and is the root of conflict. Joy, however, is the gateway to virtue and power.\n\nTherefore, one must follow joy to cultivate the root of virtue and power, never suppressing it. To suppress it is to open the gate to calamity and punishment. From this arise fortune and misfortune, safety and danger. Thus, music is yang, and punishment is yin. Yin and yang are inherently opposed: when yang wanes, yin waxes; when yin waxes, yang wanes.\n\nYang is the ruler, yin the minister. When the ruler is strong, the minister submits, and the people are easily governed. When the minister is strong, the ruler is disrespected and chaos ensues—this is the natural law of Heaven. Therefore, one must follow the ruler’s joy to restrain the people and ministers, curbing their frequent anger.\n\nPeople of later ages were foolish and did not deeply understand this meaning, instead often severing it. Thus, yin qi flourished while yang qi declined. When yang qi flourishes, there are many thieves and criminals, and the myriad things do not grow. When harmed by excessive yin, great misfortune lies here.\n\nWhen the ruler’s qi flourishes, it brings extended years and increased longevity. When the ruler is joyful, the virtues of the five directions emerge entirely; when angry, the evils of the five directions emerge entirely. Thus, great joy brings forth good responses, while lack of joy brings forth evil responses—this is the natural principle. How deeply one must be admonished!\n\nIn my text, the good are all depicted with azure heads and cinnabar eyes—why? My Dao is the truth of cinnabar and azure. Azure represents life and benevolence, while true red is the proper color of the Great Yang Heaven. My Dao is the Way of the Great Yang, the governance of benevolence, unwilling to cause harm.",

      "translated_text": "May I inquire: now that the qi of the Supreme Peace and August Sovereign has fully arrived, what is the proper order of governance between Heaven and Earth? Might I hear of this?\n\nToday, the laws of Heaven above are thus: those who find joy are met with joy, while those who suffer are met with suffering—such is the law of Heaven. Now that the qi of Supreme Peace has arrived, Heaven above follows this joy, complying and serving it, urgently abolishing weapons and halting punishments. Earth below does likewise.\n\nJoy is yang, the constant principle of Heaven. Weapons, punishments, and legal disputes are yin, the wrath of Earth. When yin rises, it must harm the transformations of yang. Now that the qi of Supreme Peace has arrived, Heaven and the divine soldiers govern together, thus severing punishments, weapons, and contentious litigation, ensuring clarity for ten thousand generations without recklessness. All things are like the sun and moon, which cannot long remain concealed.\n\nWhen the primordial qi naturally rejoices, it unites to generate Heaven and Earth. When pleased, yin and yang harmonize, and wind and rain are regulated. When wind and rain are regulated, the twelve thousand things are born together. When all things rejoice, auspicious omens emerge in response, and the manifestations of the myriad beings ascend as essence to Heaven, making the Three Luminaries shine ever more brightly. When the Three Luminaries rejoice and unite, the four seasons proceed in order: spring delights in birth, summer delights in growth, autumn delights in harvest, and winter delights in storage. When the four seasons rejoice, the Five Phases do not oppose one another, and the people flourish. When the people flourish, the Emperor’s longevity is secured; when the Emperor’s longevity is secured, all the common people rejoice. When the common people rejoice, spectral beings and demonic influences submit. When spectral influences submit, there are no deaths from heavenly calamities or premature harm, and the qi of Supreme Peace arrives. The myriad states do not wage war, and thieves, robbers, and the greedy and cunning are eradicated.\n\nThe six myriad spirits of Heaven and Earth all rejoice, and the true immortals of Heaven and Earth emerge. When the true immortals of Heaven and Earth emerge, the upright qi is fully manifest, while the perverse qi is entirely concealed. Evil people all sit in self-reflection, while good people act. The divine scriptures and records are all revealed, and false and deceptive writings vanish. There is none who does not rejoice and delight; yin and yang harmonize, hearts unite as one, and families transmit life in succession. In all matters, joy brings no evil.\n\nWhen yin and yang rejoice, it is the beginning of life. All things receive their mandate and arise, all resembling humanity. When men and women rejoice, they unite in heart and generate together, and nothing fails to come to fruition. Without joy, they are unwilling to unite in harmonious union. If, in anger or displeasure, they are forced into union, misfortune will follow.\n\nIn this text of mine, I have merely outlined the great principles, showing how joy transforms what is not good—how could one exhaustively record it all? Having understood the goodness of joy, I have yet to expound the prohibitions against the lack of joy, so I shall further clarify its guiding principles.\n\nWhen careless and displeased, unwilling to join forces and unite in heart to generate the primordial qi, one departs from the natural. The primordial qi, being natural, does not delight in division and strife; it cannot harmonize the body and unite in virtue to generate Heaven and Earth together. When Heaven and Earth are displeased, yin and yang contend, unable to harmonize the qi of the four seasons and Five Phases, regulate wind and rain, and abundantly generate the twelve thousand things. When the twelve thousand things are displeased and contend, many are harmed and die, and the year is greatly inauspicious.\n\nIn all matters, when displeased and contentious, the Three Luminaries lose their brightness, the Emperor is sorrowful and distressed, and the common people flee in exile. The good qi is concealed, and the evil qi prevails; the upright spirits depart, and demonic beings arise. The myriad beings and people die prematurely, without attaining their years. When the twelve thousand states contend in displeasure, punishments greatly increase, and weapons are raised. Joy is severed and abandoned, punishments surge, and the six directions are disharmonious—each day is inauspicious.\n\nWhen the qi of Heaven is not regulated, it begins here, yet people do not know its cause. Instead, they blame the ruler above and reproach the Emperor. Failing to recognize the great fault, they reverse the order, blaming those below for the faults of those above, exhausting the perverse qi—how can Supreme Peace be achieved? Instead, misfortune is brought about, punishments daily increase, and joy is utterly lost. The blame lies with the teachings of the middle ages, where instructors repeatedly established methods that, on the contrary, opened the gates of weapons and closed the doors of joy, allowing evil and deceit to arise, which cannot be swiftly stopped. The great fault lies here.\n\nThus, when the penetrating and leveling qi of Heaven above arrives, great joy is unleashed, and punishments are abolished. Earth below does likewise. I cannot exhaustively record the goodness of unleashing joy, nor the evils of its absence.\n\nTherefore, the Dao of yin and yang extends from Heaven above to Earth below, spreading boundlessly. The male and female kinds frolic and rejoice together, then unite in heart to generate, complete, govern, and transmit the mandate of Heaven and Earth, mastering the boundless arts. If they do not frolic together, unwilling to unite in heart as one, how could they willingly generate, complete, govern, and transmit the mandate of Heaven and Earth, mastering the inexhaustible defense?\n\nTo force unity through punishments and威, though it may endure for a time, will ultimately fail. Turning away and contending, yin and yang overcome one another, and the harm of banditry cannot be stopped. Even among the closest—father and son, mother and child, husband and wife—harm will arise, together disrupting the Dao of Heaven, and there will be no enduring world. Such are the consequences of great faults.\n\nJoy is the constant principle of Heaven, the essence of the Great Yang. Filial piety is the constant principle of Earth, the essence of the Great Yin. Thus, joy initiates and generates, initiating harmony and completing success. Heaven constantly delights in good and delights in life, thus always uniting with Heaven and sharing its qi. Only when joy unites can things generate one another, establishing hierarchy.\n\nThus, joy represents Heaven and the superior, while filial piety represents Earth and the inferior. Earth, being below, submits to what is above; yin serves yang, children serve their fathers, ministers serve their lords, and the lord above serves Heaven, just as Earth serves Heaven. Heaven serves what is above it, thus sharing qi with Earth. Therefore, joy and filial piety most perfectly accord with Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe *Yi* (Changes) governs the qi of yin and yang, with the eight winds as its measures, sharing the same position as the Six Jia, embodying both yin and yang, and uniting with Heaven and Earth as one body—thus it is the divine Dao.",

      "translated_text": "The application of punishments severs the profound yin and incites conflict—this is the qi of disharmony, thus it always arises in accordance with the rhythms of yin. Punishments intensify when yin prevails, yet yield in spring and summer; they flourish in autumn and winter. Thieves and bandits rise under cover of night; wickedness and deceit thrive in darkness and obscurity; ghosts, spirits, and all manner of illnesses erupt in gloom; resentments and grievances gather in perilous straits, leading to mutual slaughter. This is the great proof that joy does not follow punishment—how can one not be cautious? The foolish fear it. If you, my disciple, know to fear it, this is the sign of longevity; if you do not know to fear it, it is the gate of misfortune. I warn you: be vigilant.\n\nThus, in governing Heaven above, each promotes joy as the foundation of transformation, causing all people to delight in mutual transformation, to sit and reflect on their faults and failings—how could it be difficult to do good? Such is the governance of Heaven above, and so too is it on Earth below. Therefore, those who wish to swiftly bring order to chaos must first sever disputes and punishments, and promote joy as the priority—then the qi of imperial equilibrium will immediately arrive.\n\nYou ask: If the qi of Great Peace in Heaven above naturally arrives in due time, and all people spontaneously transform toward goodness, with all things naturally at peace and free from illness, then why, following the model of Heaven above, must people initiate joy to transform one another? All matters depend on prior guidance and instruction—good and evil are the precursors of transformation, the gate that opens the ignorant. Thus, when Heaven intends to act, it always first initiates the precursor, and its signs appear in the heavens, divine patterns emerge. The sages of antiquity modeled their intentions upon these signs. Therefore, the Three Sovereigns above taught transformation through the Dao, and their people were all imbued with the Dao, as were all things. The Five Emperors taught transformation primarily through virtue, and their people largely embodied refined virtue, as did all things. The Three Kings taught transformation primarily through culture, and their people were largely cultured, as did all things. The Five Hegemons taught transformation primarily through martial prowess, and their people were largely martial, prone to anger and prizing strength and bravery—this is not the origin of complete transformation.\n\nThus, in the villages of good people, there are many good people; in the villages of evil people, there are many evil people—this is not a matter of mutual exchange. All matters under Heaven above and below have their own models and laws, and each models itself after its teacher, so that what is transformed entirely resembles one another. Heaven delights in generating and nurturing things, and things will not generate if they are not joyful. Now, the qi of imperial equilibrium and the utmost profundity in Heaven above all emerge to govern, and the essence of yang flourishes—there is nothing that does not rejoice. Therefore, one must model this qi and greatly promote joy to accord with and assist Heaven’s love of this, so that the Dao of Heaven rejoices greatly.\n\nNow, when emperors and kings govern with equilibrium, the people enjoy longevity, so they promote joy to serve the Dao of Heaven and cause each to sit and reflect on self-transformation—how could there be faults? Moreover, joy is Heaven, the essence of yang; when yang aligns, the essence of yin submits, just as spring and summer arise while autumn and winter submit—this is the natural pattern. True person, you must follow the words of my scripture, and punishments will naturally cease. Govern and transform in this way, and you will be no different from the divine.\n\nThus, when governance is difficult to bring to equilibrium, it is because transformation has been lost. Now, the Dao of Heaven naturally has cycles of decline and prosperity, fortune and misfortune—how can you reverse this and call it the origin of transformation? Heaven and Earth do not speak to people, so from time to time they generate sages and sagely teachers to transmit their affairs. When the timing of Heaven is auspicious and joyful, it generates good teachers to teach good words and good transformation. When the Dao of Heaven is about to descend into chaos, misfortune, and decline, it generates evil teachers to teach evil transformation. This is the sign that Heaven governs transformation, and that it is naturally good or evil.\n\nMoreover, in years of joy, good things are abundant, the five grains mature to feed people, and the people are inclined toward goodness. In years of misfortune, evil things are abundant, good things are few, and evil things feed people, so the people’s countenance is evil. This is the clear proof that teachers transform people. Thus, when good teachers emerge, evil teachers submit—this is the sign of Heaven’s prosperity and decline, and that it governs Heaven.\n\nNow, the Dao of Heaven has come full circle, so it has sent me down to expound the good affairs of the true person, to delight in transformation as the highest good, and thus to teach this as the first matter. When Heaven’s cycle is complete, all affairs are prepared, and there must be joy. You understand this intention: just as when all things and people are complete, each household has its joy. Now, Heaven’s cycle is complete—what is there not to rejoice in? How could there be misfortune?\n\nThis scripture will not change for ten thousand generations—such is the transformation of Heaven above. The five musical tones, when activated in proper sequence, align with the intentions of Heaven, Earth, and humanity, bringing about Great Peace, eliminating disasters and wickedness, and ushering in harmonious qi. When hearts and intentions unite, this is the greatest joy. When hearts and intentions diverge, this is discord and error, all leading to bitter qi.\n\nWhat must joy necessarily be? Singing and dancing, the harmonious blending of many voices. What must bitterness necessarily bring? Strife and conflict, the simultaneous rise of many misfortunes. Mutual joy is what suppresses and severs punishments; mutual sorrow and suffering are what bring about rebellion. What is meant by mutual accord and shared intention? Whenever people, great or small, can unite in intention, there must be joy—how could it be otherwise? You should further refine and carefully consider this intention.\n\nThe teachers of imperial equilibrium and the utmost profundity in Heaven above add a word to weigh and resolve this intention. However, if you do not yet greatly attain the intentions of Heaven and Earth to benefit the governance of emperors and kings, you must then follow and employ the intentions of Heaven and Earth. You must not oppose the Great Year or the various spirits, nor abandon their qi when emperors and kings act. Share their joy, their intentions, their direction, their orientation, their movement, their pivot, their root, and their will.\n\nThus, the sages of antiquity established laws, causing emperors and kings to face the east in spring, the south in summer, the west in autumn, and the north in winter—this is to govern together with the qi of Heaven. When they align in this way, it is called following the Dao of Heaven, uniting with Heaven’s qi, and thus submitting in accord. Heaven and Earth are perpetually joyful and not wrathful, so disasters, wickedness, evil, and misfortune are all severed. Then the qi of Great Peace arrives, the qi of equilibrium in Heaven above descends to govern, and the qi of equilibrium on Earth below ascends to assist it.",

      "translated_text": "Joy is expressed through raising one’s voice in song and dance. The \"qi of kingship\" should be stirred and made manifest through music, for it is fitting to offer reverence and compliance, to present support and assistance. The qi of decline, imprisonment, and death all abide in tranquility; they do not wish to be stirred, for such disturbance brings displeasure and joylessness, leading to strife and wrath, and thus giving rise to misfortune, wickedness, evil, and disaster. This is the inherent pattern and nature of Heaven and Earth, never failing even once.\n\nThe qi to be stirred begins with the qi of emperors and kings, followed by the qi of kingship, then the qi of ministers, then the qi of rest, and finally the qi of death and imprisonment. These qi all reside before the Celestial Dipper, advancing day by day to seek assistance and flourish, hence they are stirred. The remaining qi lie behind the Celestial Dipper, their influence waning as they turn away, and thus they are not fit to be aroused. To act contrary to this is to oppose Heaven and Earth, to fail in aligning with their will. Therefore, what Heaven favors is to be promoted, and what Heaven turns away from is to be abandoned—thus one knows the seasons of Heaven, and good or ill fortune may be discerned.\n\nIf you ask why the full activation of the Five Tones is insufficient to complete a song or dance, it is because only when the qi of emperors and kings prevails does the sound emerge first, just as when an emperor or king issues commands to the world, all people and things follow in compliance, and the world attains Great Peace. Each of the Five Tones stirs different forces: some summon Heaven, some Earth, some the sun, moon, and stars, some the four seasons and Five Phases, some mountains and rivers, and some the people and all things. Whatever is stirred by sound is set in motion, each producing its own effect. Thus, when harmony aligns with its intent, good is brought forth; when it fails to align, evil arises.\n\nThe spirits of all things first arrive in homage, and only afterward do their physical forms move. When activating music and sound, one must always strive to understand its purpose, carefully grasp its intent, and then Great Peace will arrive.\n\nIn spring, the stirring begins: the great *jiao* string vibrates, summoning Jupiter, while the Heart Star descends, stirring the Eastern Marchmount. The qi of Lesser Yang trembles, the sound of the Wood Phase resonates, the spirit Goumang is roused, the Azure Dragon stirs, the position of the Green Emperor is invoked, and the green-robed jade maidens ascend and descend in unison. All things of like kind come to pay homage, delighting in the sound. What has been described for one extends infinitely to all.

      "translated_text": "Combining this with all common written texts establishes the model and standard. Thus, when performing music and grasping its highest intent, one may transcend the world; grasping its middle intent brings Great Peace and dispels misfortune; grasping its lower intent delights the people.\n\nThose who further embody the highest intent may delight the divine spirits; those who grasp the middle intent may delight the refined spirits; those who grasp the lower intent may delight the body. When all intents are fully realized, the Supreme Thearch and kings may wander carefree, rejoicing while judgments are rendered, and the spirits become radiant and sated.\n\nMusic is the essence of Greater Yang. Punishment is the essence of Greater Yin. When Yang flourishes, Yin recedes; when Yin flourishes, Yang recedes—thus, when music flourishes, punishment vanishes. Yang moves and produces sound, while Yin is silent; therefore, punishment often harms through Yin. In ancient times, the sages who followed music aligned with the intent of Heaven and Earth: compliance brought fortune, defiance brought misfortune.\n\nThus, Heaven’s three qi: the upper qi is called *music*, the middle qi is called *harmony*, and the lower qi is called *punishment*. Music belongs to Yang, punishment to Yin, and harmony to the Center. The southeast, being Yang, favors life; the northwest, being Yin, favors killing. The qi of harmony follows and circulates, now hidden, now manifest, warding off harm.\n\nSound is the discourse of music. Whether divining near or far, one must align with the time, day, names, and characters, delineating boundaries, assessing the waxing and waning of sovereign and resting qi, and correlating them to form discourse. Listening thus ensures no error.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is like a cycle, ever revolving and returning to its beginning. Always apply the sovereign qi in its proper time, aligning with the Dipper’s position, facing its direction, and activating its sound. When people intone it, they may also use its sound, reckoning with the Six Jia and Five Phases—these are the numbers of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe qi of the seasons is what Heaven and Earth favor and promote. On the day of the Beginning of Spring, when the Dipper aligns with *yin*, it is called the time of the Supreme Thearch. First, the Great Horn is activated; at the midpoint of the month, it aligns with *jia*; in the second month, with *mao*; at the midpoint, with *yi*; in the third month, with *chen*. The rest follow this pattern, each adjusted for the earliness or lateness of the seasonal qi.\n\nFirst, activate the sovereign sound and sovereign string, then the ministerial sound and ministerial string, each according to its number. This is called \"receiving the qi of Heaven and complying with the qi of Earth.\" If Heaven and Earth delight in and employ it, how much more so for humans?\n\nHumans are the most honored of all beings, the children of Heaven. Heaven delights when humans reverently employ its numbers; Earth delights when humans carefully employ its numbers. This is like a filial child obeying their parents’ teachings—how could the parents not love and favor them? Deeply ponder this intent and transmit it to later generations, so they may emulate it to dispel disasters, pacify the qi of Heaven above, and assist the Thearch and kings in governance below.\n\nNow, when the hearts of all people are at peace and not inclined toward wickedness, the twelve thousand beings each attain their proper place—how could this not be joyous?\n\nOne asks: Among the affairs of the Six Caverns and Eight Directions, what is most auspicious, and what is most inauspicious? The most harmonious is auspicious; the most contrary is inauspicious. Evil is contrary; goodness is harmonious.\n\nThus, the qi of the Thearch, the ministerial qi, and the subtle qi all reside before the Celestial Dipper—this is auspicious, for it is what Heaven delights in and wishes to promote. Therefore, one should rejoice in and comply with it. The resting and waning qi are what Heaven and Earth jointly abandon; thus, they should be set aside and not celebrated. Celebrating them opposes the will of Heaven and Earth, constituting great defiance and dissonance with the seasonal qi.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven serves as the model: the sovereign and flourishing qi govern Great Peace, while the imprisoned, waning, and extinguished qi govern inauspicious years. In years of Great Peace, all things flourish, and many good omens appear—this is the great verification of Heaven and Earth. Thus, the ancient sages and worthies deeply divined and complied with these patterns, clearly understanding that like kinds and like affairs share the same qi. By divining through resonance, they obtained its image, then reformed their natures and altered their conduct, never daring to act wrongly.\n\nThe language of Heaven and Earth is revealed through these signs; by observing the images and categories obtained, one may know all. Thus, inauspicious years yield few good responses.\n\nTherefore, those who would bring about Great Peace through music must comply with the sovereign qi. In inauspicious years, music must not be performed without cause, for the imprisoned and waning qi oppose Heaven and Earth—hence, they are inauspicious. The sovereign qi is where virtue resides; the imprisoned and waning qi are where punishment resides.\n\nHeaven endows each being with its nature and spirit. Delighting in goodness brings good spirits; delighting in evil brings evil spirits—this is the natural disposition.\n\nFirst, comply with and activate the seasonal qi of Heaven, Earth, and the Four Thearchs, then augment it threefold to delight Heaven. Thus, Heaven rejoices greatly, the Thearch’s lifespan extends, premature deaths and evil vanish, disasters are entirely dispelled, the qi of Greater Yang ceases its wrath, and the realm’s borders are secure. Those who know to first activate and comply with music align with Heaven’s intent to benefit humanity, and true spirits emerge. Even those dwelling in hidden caves delight in coming to assist governance.\n\nSecond, comply with and activate the seasonal and sovereign qi of Heaven and Earth, then augment it twofold to delight the qi of Earth. Thus, Earth rejoices greatly and ceases its wrath, granting the ruler longevity, dissolving treachery, banditry, and warfare, and fostering goodness within the realm. Below, all delight in complying with their superiors, and the worthy emerge to assist in governance, while Earth spirits comply and nurture.\n\nThird, comply with and activate the ministerial and subtle qi, causing the qi of harmony to rejoice greatly. Thus, ruler and ministers, people and spirits, each safeguard their place; flatterers, bandits, and thieves do not arise; borders are secure; and the qi of harmony daily flourishes, while all things incline toward goodness.\n\nFourth, be cautious never to activate the qi of death and destruction, lest severe banditry arise, sudden deaths multiply, and the realm’s borders remain perilously unstable, bringing forth malevolent qi and ghosts in great numbers, causing severe harm.\n\nFifth, do not activate the imprisoned qi, lest great misfortune arise.\n\nSixth, do not activate the waning and resting qi, lest great misfortune arise.\n\nThe reason for tripling the music of the sovereign qi is that the sovereign qi is most honored and supreme, resembling the revered Heaven—thus, it is celebrated threefold.",

      "translated_text": "All twelve thousand beings come into being, and the qi of goodness responds in full.\n\nThe reason for doubling the music of the ministerial qi is that the ministerial qi resembles Earth, and Earth dwells alongside humanity—thus, its music is doubled to honor Earth. Earth dwells with humanity, and when people see this, all rejoice; thus, the myriad things are well-ordered.\n\nThe reason for performing the music of the ministerial qi and subtle qi as one is that it resembles the balanced and harmonious person. The balanced and harmonious person is humbler than Heaven and Earth, so the music is less.\n\nHumanity is tasked with ordering the myriad things for Heaven and Earth. When people delight in music, they rejoice and incline toward goodness, and the myriad things are well-ordered.\n\nThe music of the sovereign qi is modeled after the Three Sovereigns, like Heaven itself. The music of the kingly qi is patterned after the Five Emperors, resembling Earth’s virtue of nurturing beings while periodically applying punishment.\n\nThe subtle qi is modeled after the Three Kings, without fixed laws. The waning, imprisoned, and vanishing qi are modeled after the Five Hegemons, whose qi is chaotic.\n\nHeaven and Earth possess martial power to punish evil and uphold goodness—this must be deeply examined.\n\nLet the Perfected One accumulate goodness and wisdom, mastering all affairs. Now, the Supreme Qi of Great Peace from the Heavenly August Sovereign has fully arrived. The Most High desires what can be urgently attained: the Heavenly August Sovereign delights in good people, those who can harmonize wind and rain to nurture all beings.\n\nSince the beginning of creation, those who do good have been few, and few align with Heaven’s will. Heaven has always regarded this as a source of sorrow. Now, among those on Earth, few meet Heaven’s standards for eternal harmony.\n\nBeneath the Great Heaven, the twelve thousand states all differ according to their water and soil. The finest of good people are entrusted to Heaven, and the essence and radiance of the myriad things ascend to belong to Heaven. The middling are entrusted to humanity, to serve and harmonize with the yin-yang and the myriad things. The lowest are entrusted to Earth, to walk and labor upon it.\n\nThe Dao is what August Heaven takes as its model. It is the highest designation of goodness, crowning the supreme, enveloping the boundless, emerging without gaps, entering without crevices. It is the teacher of all matters under Heaven, the origin of a million affairs, the elder of past and present worthies and sages. When emperors and kings align with Heaven’s heart, they become the parents of the people, from whom all transformations arise.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is Heaven itself—pure and luminous, unwilling to be defiled or dishonored. Yet today’s practice of the Dao consists entirely of four defiling acts, polluting the divine Dao of August Heaven and disrupting Earth’s principles. Such acts cannot serve as the foundation of transformation, cannot be a model for teachers, cannot be parents. Together, they destroy Heaven’s treasured vessel, and are called the great rebellious children. Thus, Heaven above knows them deeply and swiftly punishes them.\n\nWhen the qi of Supreme Peace from the August Sovereign arrives, it cannot tolerate these four kinds of people:\nFirst, the unfilial;\nsecond, those who preserve their true nature but leave no descendants;\nthird, those who eat feces and drink urine;\nfourth, those who act as beggars.\nThese four types all defile the true Dao of Heaven and are unfit for fostering transformation.\n\nWhen rulers employ fools to govern, Heaven’s great limit is near. How is this known? When a ruler governs with such people, Heaven manifests many disasters and omens, and the barbarians frequently invade—this is clear proof of Heaven’s disapproval.\n\nTo align with the weightiest standards is no different from a binding contract. What people detest, Heaven detests; what people love, Heaven loves. Thus, the sages and worthies of antiquity deeply grasped this great principle and always modeled their conduct on Heaven, never daring to deviate even slightly. Therefore, they alone enjoyed Heaven’s favor and won Heaven’s heart. Without Heaven’s heart, great misfortune follows.\n\nHeaven selects its officers to share in its work, administering the inexhaustible arts of governance. Long united in purpose and strength, they harmonize qi with a single heart—thus, they endure.\n\nNow, Heaven values the transmission of mutual generation, so the four seasons receive Heaven’s teachings and generate one another endlessly. Thus, Heaven is called Father, Earth is called Mother, and the qi of the six jia, twelve branches, and eight trigrams serve as their principles. They generate one another in turn, taking turns to act, so the Dao of Heaven remains eternally unbroken—this is the constant aid to transformation.\n\nTherefore, scholars must model themselves on Heaven and never sever Heaven’s lineage. Now, Heaven is pure and luminous, and the Dao is clear and unsullied. Heaven and the Dao dwell above as models for humanity. The pure and luminous delight in purity and luminosity, so the Three Luminaries ascend to Heaven, each following its kind, combining to form their shapes.\n\nHeaven’s shape is like a bright mirror: just as a person’s eyes see clearly, it does not wish to be defiled but always desires fresh brilliance. When emperors and kings rise, they all obtain the Dao as their teacher. People cherish their glory and wisdom, using them to transform the people. What teachers value is the ability to know Heaven’s heart and will, modeling transformation upon it.\n\nGoodness on Earth is goodness in Heaven; evil on Earth is evil in Heaven. Thus, when people do good on Earth, Heaven responds with goodness. When people do evil on Earth, Heaven responds with evil. Their qi ascends and connects.\n\nThe five qi link above and below in unison; the six extensions join above and below in thoroughfare; the twelve branches align above and below. There is no distance too far for this connection. Goodness below ascends and connects; evil below brings misfortune above. The Five Phases arise below, and the Five Stars shine above. This is what Heaven makes clear to the people of the world.\n\nWhat does Heaven above delight in? What does it forbid? Only by knowing its prohibitions and heeding its warnings, pondering its will day and night and never daring to transgress, can one instruct future generations.\n\nNow, the qi of Supreme Peace from the August Sovereign has fully arrived in abundance. The yang days grow bright first, evil qi halts and rests, and upright qi prevails. The waning dissipates, and the Dao and virtue flourish in yang.\n\nHeaven urgently forbids setting fire to mountains and forests. Mountains are the great yang, the guiding principle of the land, its ruler. The gathering of roots and trees is its elder—this, too, is a ruler.",
      "overlap_context": "vere banditry arise, sudden deaths multiply, and the realm’s borders remain perilously unstable, bringing forth malevolent qi and ghosts in great numbers, causing severe harm.\n\nFifth, do not activate the imprisoned qi, lest great misfortune arise.\n\nSixth, do not activate the waning and resting qi, lest great misfortune arise.\n\nThe reason for tripling the music of the sovereign qi is that the sovereign qi is most honored and supreme, resembling the revered Heaven—thus, it is celebrated threefold.",

      "translated_text": "Fire is the eldest of the Five Phases, yang in nature. The Three Lords and Three Yangs, when they meet, reverse and weaken one another. Therefore, Heaven urgently forbids setting fire to mountains and forests where trees gather. If not burned, they flourish abundantly; when they flourish, fire reigns supreme, and fire’s supremacy delights the sun and moon, bing-ding, si, and wu. When the mother is abundant, her child receives qi and endures long—thus Heaven above halts such burning. When yin flourishes, yin’s treachery dissipates day by day; when yang wanes, yin’s treachery arises daily—this is the natural law.\n\nOne asks: when the Three Yangs converge, why is it inauspicious? The Three Yangs are Heaven’s yang, humanity’s yang, and Earth’s yang. The Three Yangs contain not a single yin; all three are lords, not a single subject; all three are male, not a single female. This is the path to annihilation, the Way without posterity. The Way without posterity cannot transmit its kind, cannot mutually engender—thus it becomes inauspicious. This is to have Heaven but no Earth, to have the sun but no moon, to have above but no below, to have exterior but no interior. In Heaven’s reckoning, this is the mark of imminent ruin.\n\nOne asks: may field grasses be burned? Heaven above does not forbid it—indeed, they ought to be burned. Why burn them alone? Grasses are the yin of wood and correspond to yi. Wood corresponds to jia, and jia is yang, of the same kind as wood—thus they correspond. Yi is yin and of the same kind as grasses—thus they correspond. Yi fears metal, and metal injures wood; when wood is injured, yang wanes, and when yang wanes, treachery arises—therefore they ought to be burned. Yi is yin, grasses are yin, Earth is yin—three yins oppose one another and together breed treachery. Thus it is said: when the year resides in the northern extreme of yin, extreme yin gives birth to yang. Fire is yang, and yin, receiving yang, compliantly gives rise to good affairs. Therefore, Heaven above instructs: burn the grasses of the lower fields to delight yin and comply with yang. Two share the office, together governing yin and yang, removing the illnesses of Heaven and Earth, so that the Emperor and kings know no sorrow, the twelve thousand things each attain their place, grasses and trees emerge in joy, and no grievances remain.\n\nNow, the fine and virtuous qi of Supreme Peace has arrived, and Heaven constantly fears that the people may violate the seasonal ordinances and harm it. The myriad spirits above jointly record those who delight in killing and wounding, the sons who hunt and fish, those who do not follow the Dao of Heaven and do no good, who constantly delight in killing and wounding. Heaven reproves them, Earth detests them, the host of spirits condemns them, and together they record and punish them. Every three years, a minor reckoning; every five years, a major reckoning. Those with grave transgressions are sentenced, while minor offenses result in reduced years and diminished fate. Every three generations, a great reckoning; every five generations, a great annihilation.\n\nTherefore, Heaven above has assembled the documents of the Three Ways, and the host of spirits jointly record transgressions of killing, wounding, and punishments.\n\nJia-zi is Heaven’s norm, the day when winter first returns. Yi-chou is Earth’s norm, when things spread their roots. Bing-yin is humanity’s norm, when at dawn people first rise and open their doors to their duties. These three are the beginnings of Heaven, Earth, and humanity, the root of all things. What is born first belongs to yang, the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth. Thus, Qian, Kan, Gen, and Zhen reside on the northeastern face, their harmony lying between Kan and Gen, where yin and yang unite and give birth in the center. Therefore, all who conceive dwell in the central abdomen, slightly below the harmony, born within yin—hence called “mother.” One must not allow the qi of punishment to reside in the center.\n\nNow, the Dao of Heaven has completed a great cycle and begun anew, with pure yang governing Heaven and Earth above and below—thus punishments are urgently abolished. Heaven is called spirit, and yang is also called spirit. Those who now transgress our writings and delight in punishments will be punished by Heaven above. Therefore, the method of the divine sages arises from the heart alone, with nothing left unexplained. Thus, the flourishing of red is Heaven, the sun, and the heart. Heaven and the sun are ever bright, illuminating all without fail. Those who practice this Dao utterly eradicate all that is treacherous and perverse.\n\nYang is born within the dark and obscure. Thus, yang qi arises in the north, emerges in the east, flourishes in the south, and wanes and dissipates in the west. Such is the law of Heaven.\n\nWhen the qi of Supreme Peace arrives, who is fit for the Dao? Who is unfit? The Dao and humanity are like wind and rain: those who practice it prosper, while those who do not simply desist. Those who practice well are its people; those who do not practice well are not its people. Those who practice without exertion, whose path opens easily, are its people. Those who do not open their path, who labor all day without success, are not its people. To practice is auspicious; not to practice is inauspicious.\n\nIn nurturing oneself, can one afford not to examine this carefully? The Dao is the tally of the upright.\n\nThe *Excerpts from the Scripture of Supreme Peace*, Geng Section, Volume Seven, concludes.\nThe *Excerpts from the Scripture of Supreme Peace*, Xin Section, Volume Eight.\n\nOne asks: to be sated without eating, to enjoy long life and enduring existence—this is the Way to enrich the state and preserve the people. If one wishes to cease eating, one must first employ the method of guiding life and thereby retain qi. After ingesting qi-nourishing medicines, hunger arises slightly on the third day, mildly on the seventh, and beyond ten days, one achieves minor success without doubt—having left death for life. After ingesting qi-nourishing medicines, for all solid and difficult-to-digest foods, one meal suffices as the measure. For formless foods, moderation and restraint are best. Beyond a hundred days, one may cease eating—this is called the inexhaustible Way, the means to assist the state in nourishing the people and aid Heaven and Earth as the masters of sustenance. Too little is auspicious; too much is inauspicious; complete abstention is also inauspicious, for it obstructs the intestines.\n\nThe method for unblocking the intestines: one meal is proper; two meals are excessive; three meals are inferior; four meals distend the intestines; five meals provoke great hunger; six meals bring grave misfortune. From this, a hundred illnesses arise, and in years of great famine, one will die.",

      "translated_text": "After regulating one's diet for a thousand days, the large and small intestines become full, and one will never feel hunger. All illnesses depart, the complexion improves, and nothing is forbidden or guarded against. The ancients who attained the Dao in old age all did so by abstaining from food. Rulers, ministers, and common people may thus secure body and mind, fulfill their duties, preserve wealth if rich, and sustain life if poor. The noble person who practices this will thrive in years of plenty and avoid peril in years of famine.\n\nHumans possess three lives, yet remain unaware: daily consumption of three meals sustains them. Skipping the morning meal severs one life; skipping the midday meal severs two; skipping the evening meal severs all three. After three days without food, nine lives are extinguished. Without stored provisions or hoarded treasures, hunger arises. From this, great deceit and wickedness begin.\n\nBy employing this Way, all affairs regulate themselves. In auspicious years, one may share prosperity; in famine years, one may preserve the people. One should always lightly bind the intestines to facilitate movement. Between Heaven and Earth, all things possess their own spirit and luminosity, ascending to Heaven as stars by which to observe safety and danger.\n\nThe nature of Heaven and Earth has its own patterns and laws—six jia stems, five phases, four seasons, and their measured cycles—by which one may divine and foresee future events, remedy decline and disorder, and prevent calamities before they arise.\n\n**Seven Matters of Loyalty and Filial Duty:**\n\n1. **Minister’s Duty to the Ruler’s Decline:** When a minister perceives the ruler’s decline and revives him to renewed prosperity, it is a great merit. To recognize the decline yet fail to remedy it—or worse, to speak ill and depart—is to incite misfortune, and the guilt remains unforgiven.\n\n2. **Minister’s Duty to Avert Disaster:** If a minister knows the ruler is about to face misfortune and intervenes to prevent it, this is a great merit. To know and not act is to incite disaster, and the guilt remains unforgiven.\n\n3. **Minister’s Duty to Correct Governance:** When a minister perceives the ruler’s governance has lost its essential purpose and disasters arise in succession, yet assists in restoring order, this is proper and marks a discerning minister. To know and not act leaves the guilt unforgiven.\n\n4. **Minister’s Duty to Guide the Young Ruler:** If a minister knows the ruler is young and his wisdom insufficient for governance, yet aids him in attaining understanding, this is proper. To know and not assist—even to speak of his inadequacy—is disloyalty, weakening one’s superior, and the guilt remains unforgiven.\n\n5. **Minister’s Duty to the Aging Ruler:** When a minister knows the ruler is aged and nearing the end of his years, yet seeks extraordinary methods and great sages to devise strategies and inner texts, extending the ruler’s lifespan, this is a great merit. To know and not act—even to speak of fortune or misfortune—is a grave transgression.\n\n6. **Subordinate’s Duty to the Superior’s Peril:** If a subordinate perceives their superior in danger, whether through misgovernance or negligence, and aids in rectifying the situation, this is a great merit. To know and not act, instead evading responsibility and departing, is to be disloyal and unfilial, and the guilt extends to their descendants.\n\n7. **Child’s Duty to Ailing Parents:** When parents fall ill, a child who, through divination and observation, exhausts all effort and spirit to save them fulfills their duty. To know and not act invites Heaven’s severe punishment.\n\n8. **Child’s Duty to Aging Parents:** When a child knows their parents are aged and nearing the end of their years, yet seeks wise teachers and extraordinary methods to restore their vitality, this is the duty of a filial child. This is akin to consuming the food of others and returning it as sustenance—a great merit.\n\n9. **Duty to Rescue the Afflicted:** When one knows another faces misfortune, great harm, or impending suffering, yet intervenes to restore them, offering extraordinary methods, strategies, inner texts, and good counsel to eliminate their sorrows, this is a great merit. To know and not act leaves the guilt unforgiven.\n\nTo abandon one’s parents in their hour of death, seeking pleasure while shunning hardship, is to be no different from beasts. How can such a one govern the Three Powers or succeed Heaven and Earth?\n\nThus, the sages emerge to teach and admonish, urging goodness and severing evil, rescuing Heaven and Earth from disaster, ensuring the Three Luminaries, Five Phases, and stars move in harmony. Is this mere empty speech?\n\nNow, the heavens above have produced texts to transform and eliminate all disasters, bringing forth goodness. Therefore, I, having received the mandate of the Perfected, reveal these writings. The heavens above instruct me to speak boldly, without concealment or obstruction.\n\nNow, Heaven and Earth undergo a great renewal, and disasters are about to vanish without remnant. Thus, I teach people to compile and collate ancient and modern texts of virtue, forming the *Canon of the Utmost Depth*, a definitive work of goodness that cannot be altered. Even sages and worthies cannot surpass its phrasing.\n\nThese words are the language of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang. They instruct and admonish worthy rulers, urging diligent practice to attain Great Peace. The purpose of speaking of concealment is that when a worthy ruler obtains this and treasures it in his heart, applying it to the world, nurturing the myriad things to achieve Great Peace, and ascribing merit to the Supreme Emperor, it will be as enduring as stone chambers and deep caves.\n\nHeaven bestows good things, which must return to good places. Like pearls and jade, they are treasured by emperors and kings. Coarse and inferior things are discarded by the masses. How much more does Heaven love those who do good? How could emperors and kings not value them?\n\nNow, the heavens above are the Heaven of the Utmost Limit; the heavens between are the Heaven of the Utmost Limit; the heavens below are the Heaven of the Utmost Limit; and the heavens extending in all directions are the Heaven of the Utmost Limit. The present method is such that the Three Ways gather qi and deliberate together, corresponding to the positions of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.\n\nWhen Great Peace arrives, Heaven rejoices, and the emperor’s lifespan extends. The Way’s numinous power protects Heaven and Earth; good qi responds without fail. Virtue and power arrive daily; deceit and falsehood retreat; treacherous ministers and corrupt officials vanish. All ministers are removed, and myriad virtues arise spontaneously. The Five Phases harmonize; the four seasons proceed in timely goodness.\n\nIn governance, one must begin with the root. The root lies in the human and spirit images between Heaven and Earth, where spirits mirror humans, each possessing their own domain. Gathering in pavilions, districts, townships, and counties, their preferences, aversions, joys, and sufferings each have their origin. All affairs are closely examined, their strengths and weaknesses, gains and losses illuminated as clearly as the sun and moon.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the great teachings convene their deliberations, where the worthy and unworthy together settle affairs in equanimity. Therefore, in every prefecture, county, township, and village under Heaven, sealed receptacles are established, and the myriad people are each to compose writings according to their abilities, speaking directly of their hardships, sufferings, benefits, harms, approvals, and disapprovals, then submit their writings into the seals. Local officials shall compile and present these to the Son of Heaven, enabling him to know the people’s preferences and aversions, the worthy and unworthy, the beneficial and harmful, so that they may be collectively deliberated and governed. Thereupon, the qi of Great Peace shall arrive, blessing the state, its lord, and the myriad people, so that the twelve thousand beings each attain their proper place.\n\nThe sealed receptacle is what is now called the *guǐhán*. The Way of Heaven has its urgencies and delays; human affairs are likewise urgent or delayed. When the Way of Heaven is urgent, wind, rain, thunder, and lightning arrive without fail at their appointed times. When human affairs are urgent, swift action likewise arrives without delay. For urgent matters, one must respond in accordance with the celestial model: the memorial is submitted in a single transmission, returned to the original office for handling, and rewards or punishments are meted out accordingly. For delayed matters, they are to be reported in a single day during the eighth month.\n\nThe celestial model is thus. Just as the principles of yin and yang operate in this manner, so too do human affairs. Within each person’s abdomen resides a Celestial Sovereign, and the Five Qi each have their ruling monarchs. Heaven possesses the Five Qi, and Earth has the Five Directions. One qi presides over movement, and the ruling monarch upholds rectitude. All affairs within the human abdomen are called the *heart*. The heart is the ruler of the Five Viscera, the root of the spirit, and the utmost essence of the body. It governs the pursuit of goodness; the heart takes no joy in falsehood, for internal wickedness is evil.\n\nIf one can uphold goodness, abide in clarity and stillness, refrain from reckless external pursuits, and maintain inner integrity, then one may meet the ruler within the abdomen—this is called \"illuminating the heart to behold its clarity.\" The heart is the ruler; meeting it ensures longevity, and all affairs are governed rightly. Those who fail to meet the ruler are all deviant, no longer in communion with the ruler, and all their affairs go awry, leading to early demise.\n\nNow, the virtue of the Great Yang flourishes, desiring that above and below Heaven, there be no bounds above and no limits below, extending even to the Eight Caverns beyond. The true spirits and true essences, radiant with light, all emerge to assist the Emperor in governance, bringing forth the qi of the Supreme Sovereign’s Cavernous Peace, which has never been seen before. The good enjoy long lives, and the myriad beings no longer suffer untimely deaths or self-inflicted grievances. Deviant spirits all vanish, and under Heaven, there are no longer those who suffer from oppression or illness. How could such wonders not be heard?\n\nExcellent is your question! Heaven commands the complete eradication of deceit, falsehood, and malevolence, bringing forth true affairs. All paintings and diagrams possess their own spirits: true affairs have true spirits, deviant affairs have deviant spirits, good affairs have good spirits, and evil affairs have evil spirits. Those who accumulate deviance in their households will inevitably suffer deviant harm. Those who accumulate true texts and true Dao in their households will inevitably produce transcendents.\n\nThus, the manifestations of truth and falsehood each arise from their own essence. Heaven has the auspicious and the inauspicious: the auspicious has auspicious spirits, and the inauspicious has inauspicious spirits. Earth likewise has the auspicious and inauspicious: the auspicious has auspicious spirits, and the inauspicious has inauspicious spirits.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors each had their kin and brothers; the Three Kings and Five Hegemons likewise had their own kin and brothers. Though distinctions may be minor, each follows its kind. When the world flourishes, they rise; when it declines, they fall. Like day and night, they follow one another in succession, continuing unceasingly from the opening of yin and yang to the present. The poor become petty men, and the wealthy become noble men, alternating in governance and mutual administration.\n\nThis is the kinship of Heaven and Earth. Though the myriad beings do not flourish, some resemble one another, yet in truth, they are not the same. Heaven has the Six Jia, the Four Seasons, the Five Phases, the firm and the yielding, the female and the male, the eldest, middle, and youngest—all forming kin and brothers. By revering and serving them without fail, one transforms the world, making them the masters of goodness: benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, culture, and martial virtue, each becoming kin and brothers in turn.\n\nWhere the Dao is kin to the Dao, all Dao converge as one, mutually verifying and generating one another. If one’s body today attains the Dao, all Daoists will come, and kindred spirits unite as one family, all harboring good intentions. Regardless of rank, none harm one another, and disasters and calamities all depart without misfortune. If the Emperor practices this, the world will flourish, and governance will be effortless, ensuring long life and transcendence. If officials and people practice this, their governance will grow ever clearer, and all Dao will emerge, shining with light.\n\nThe Dao is kin to the Dao, transmitted and practiced in succession. Thus, summoning the Dao with the Dao and seeking the Dao with the Dao makes the Dao one’s kin and brothers. When transformation reaches such a state, the world will all cherish life and detest killing. How could there be those without the Dao?\n\nWhere virtue is kin to virtue, if one today embodies great virtue and takes virtue as one’s intent, all virtuous people will yield and serve one another, and all virtuous people under Heaven will emerge. Taking this as the model, one may sit in tranquility without affairs. If the Emperor practices this, his state will prosper; if officials and people practice it, nothing will remain ungoverned. Summoning virtue with virtue, virtue will come of itself.\n\nWhere benevolence is kin to benevolence, if one today embodies benevolence, all benevolent people will come seeking one another. Summoning benevolence with benevolence, all benevolent people will come. If the Emperor practices this, the world will be entirely benevolent; if officials and people practice it, none will fail to be kindred. This is what it means for benevolence to unite as one family—kin and brothers.\n\nWhere righteousness is kin to righteousness, seeking righteousness with righteousness, if one today has attained righteousness, all righteous people will come to join them, uniting through righteousness. If the Emperor practices this, suffering and joy will be balanced; if officials and people practice it, life and injury will be balanced. Seeking righteousness with righteousness makes them kin and brothers.\n\nWhere propriety is kin to propriety, seeking propriety with propriety, if one today has attained propriety, all those who practice propriety will come. The living will not act recklessly, their abdomens empty within, their external conduct like a ring—hastening, walking, kneeling, rising—without awaiting commands.",

The two qi intersect at the center, where humanity resides in correctness. The two qi constantly interact and function, uniting at the center to jointly generate the myriad things. All things receive these two qi to take form, combining them into nature and disposition. Without these two qi, they cannot be born or completed. Thus, the lives of the myriad things depend on these two qi, which intermingle within their forms.\n\nTherefore, when one does good, Heaven and Earth know it; when one does evil, Heaven and Earth also know it.

      "translated_text": "The Heavenly Prognostication states: Those who return to joy find joy; those who return to goodness find goodness; those who return to evil find evil; those who return to delight find delight; those who return to compliance find compliance; those who return to truth find truth; those who return to the Dao find the Dao; those who return to contentment find contentment. Whatever one returns to, Heaven and Earth and the host of spirits likewise return in kind, as swiftly as echo follows sound.\n\nThose who return to refinement find refinement returned; those who return to deceit find deceit returned; those who return to eloquence find eloquence returned; those who return to flattery find flattery returned; those who return to martial prowess find martial prowess returned; those who return to rebellion find rebellion returned; those who return to misfortune find misfortune returned; those who return to perversity find perversity returned. Whatever one returns to, Heaven and Earth and the host of spirits all return in kind.\n\nAll principles of fortune and misfortune, safety and peril, lie in what one returns to. Why is it that households of great strength, which amass private wealth in abundance, later often fall into poverty and misfortune? The divine ones say: This is because some, though possessed of much wisdom, instead deceive those who lack it; or, though strong, instead bully the weak; or, though young, instead oppress the old—all acts of rebellion, and thus Heaven does not long protect them.\n\nWhy is this? Those with wisdom ought to nurture the foolish, yet instead deceive them—this is the first rebellion. The strong ought to support the weak, yet instead bully them—this is the second rebellion. The young ought to care for the old, yet instead oppress them—this is the third rebellion. Such conduct opposes the heart of Heaven, and thus misfortune must follow.\n\nWealth is but the surplus of Heaven and Earth, like water that ever flows and follows, ever humble and dwelling below. Those who obtain much wealth are those who are humble and thus receive more. Therefore, the greedy—Heaven does not protect them.\n\nSince the loss of harmony among the three laws of Heaven, Earth, and yin-yang, there has been an excess of reckoning in Heaven, with accumulated stores left unspent. Why is this? Heaven’s mandate allots one hundred and thirty to the highest, called the surplus of the yang calendar. Next, one hundred and twenty, called the remainder after deducting the cycle of years. Then, one hundred years, called the harmonious reckoning of things and cycles. All people ought to model their years upon these. Yet since the loss of the three laws, many do not complete their allotted years. Each surplus year is recorded as one reckoning in Heaven, but as people’s conduct strays from the Dao of Heaven, none can claim them. Now, those who emulate this text and act with goodness—Heaven will bestow all these reckonings upon them, some attaining transcendence, others extending their years.\n\nSince the [lacuna] of Heaven and Earth, emperors have been consumed by worry, for the world is not at peace, and the loss of proper order is the source of their distress. Without this, there would be no cause for concern. The world’s good people, loyal ministers, and filial children all share this worry. Yet by following this text, such worries will be dispelled.\n\nHeaven declares: When yang qi flourishes greatly, ghostly beings cannot act recklessly to cause harm. Why is this? When yang is abundant, yin must wane, and thus such beings cannot act recklessly. Who restrains them? The essence of yang restrains them. How does the essence of yang restrain them? The essence of yang is spirit, belonging to Heaven, associated with red, and governing the heart. The heart-spirit is the spirit of Heaven. Essence belongs to Earth. Ghosts are the ghosts of humans. Earth is the mother; ghosts are the children. Mother and child follow the same path and dwell together in the way of yin. When the qi of Great Peace arrives and yang qi flourishes greatly, the Dao of Heaven is strict, and the way of spirits is luminous. When luminous, Heaven enables people to employ it together. When the way of spirits is employed, it descends to dissolve the way of ghostly beings. When the way of spirits flourishes, it aligns with the noble person. The way of ghostly beings aligns with the petty person. Thus, the noble person governs with impartiality, and the spirits likewise govern with impartiality. The petty person governs with deceit and perversity, and ghostly beings likewise govern with deceit and perversity—clearly, they are of the same kind.\n\nNow, when the yang Dao flourishes like fire, weapons will be dissolved and extinguished by fire. Thus, weapons accumulate yin qi, and fire accumulates yang qi. When yang flourishes, it dissolves weapons—this is a natural response.\n\nHuman life must accord with Heaven’s qi. Those of utmost goodness are entrusted to Heaven; those of middling goodness are entrusted to people; those of lesser goodness are entrusted to fields and acres. Thus, the highest scholar studies to transcend the world; the middling scholar ought to govern the people; the lowest scholar ought to manage the fields and wilds. The highest scholar should come with cloud qi; the middling scholar rides in a carriage; the lowest scholar walks on foot. These three types each have distinct duties and do not interfere with one another. The highest scholar transcends the world and ascends to Heaven, regulating the winds and rains of harmony. The middling scholar serves as an official, governing the people. The lowest scholar manages property. Each has their proper duty and does not interfere.\n\nThe methods of those who study the Dao in Heaven are such that one must seek the Dao with utmost sincerity. A small alignment with the lesser Dao allows one to see minor spirits and attain a lesser realization of the Dao. If the gateway does not yet align with the middle Dao, one cannot reach the great Dao. Only by attaining the great Dao can one summon the true spirits. Those who align with the lesser Dao summon lesser spirits; those who align with the middle Dao summon middling spirits; those who align with the great Dao summon great spirits. When the great spirits arrive, one attains transcendence and eternal existence. Yet even here, there are great demonic spirits and ghosts that do not wish for people to transcend the world. They confuse and delude people, causing them to falter, and then manifest as strange transformations, mingling truth and falsehood. Only by discerning the true from the perverse at this point can one transcend the world.\n\nIn Heaven, the highest scholar, from birth to death, harbors not a single evil thought and is thus beloved by all people. The people of the five directions and local officials all bestow gifts upon them. The middling scholar is beloved by their neighbors, who together bestow gifts upon them. The lowest scholar, devoid of any good intentions, receives no gifts but instead steals from their own household. This is what the people of the world [lacuna] do.\n\nWhat does [lacuna] mean? The highest scholar is purely good, their heart and mind free of evil—this is the highest yang. The middling scholar’s heart and mind are half good—this is the middle yang. The lowest scholar’s heart and mind are entirely devoid of goodness—this is the lowest yang. Thus, they are called [lacuna]. [Lacuna] does not become substantial, empty within like a husk without grain, for they lack true sincerity. Those without sincerity are called [lacuna] people.",

      "translated_text": "The highest scholar who receives gifts from local officials and people from all directions bestows them upon their household, signifying they do not forget their ancestral roots. The middling scholar who receives gifts from their neighbors bestows them upon their household, signifying they do not forget their parents. The lowest scholar, in contrast, steals from their own household’s wealth to give to neighboring villages—this mirrors their [lacuna], hollow within yet full without, turning their back on their origins. All such acts harm the heavens above, for to betray one’s household is to rend its harmony, and all discord stems from such a person.\n\nWhen a minister engages in external alliances, their state will surely be emptied; when a household member engages in external alliances, their household will surely be emptied. The calamities of heaven all arise from this. Indeed, safety and peril originate within the human heart, while the numinous and divine are perceived from afar. Above and below, near and far, their vision penetrates a hundred million miles—how can one not be cautious?\n\nThe Way of Great Peace is concise in its teachings yet enriches the state; it is the mandate of heaven and the treasure of the self. Emerging close from the heart and mind, it circulates throughout the world. When this teaching is practiced, the state may be secured, and households may prosper. The laws of heaven and earth decree that the good govern the wicked, the upright govern the perverse, and the pure govern the turbid. One must not allow the wicked to govern the good, the perverse to govern the upright, or the turbid to govern the pure—such are the commands of rebellion. Banditry will not cease, villainy will multiply daily, and great chaos will arise from this.\n\nWhen an emperor or king appoints a minister, they must carefully examine their selection, ensuring their choice aligns with the celestial heart and the constellations before daring to appoint them. The sun embodies the virtue of the ruler; the moon embodies the virtue of the minister. If the constellations do not align, great peace cannot be achieved, and villainy will arise.\n\nConsider the heavens above and the earth below, the eight directions and the central crossroads—what are the lodgings, provisions, and resting places like? Those who practice the Dao and virtue yet harbor doubts may resolve them through this prophecy.\n\nToday, in the heavens above, there are official lodges and postal stations to accommodate travelers, just as on earth there are official lodges and postal stations to accommodate travelers. In the eight directions and the central realm, all have them. The celestial lodges house immortals and transcendents; the earthly lodges house sages and worthies; the subterranean lodges house the yin spirits, the good gods, and the benevolent dead. The lodges in the distant eight directions, the famous mountains, and the great rivers house the spirits of heaven and earth. For those immortals who have yet to ascend to heaven, the clouds and winds provide shelter. The lodges and postal stations at the North Pole and Kunlun await the sages, worthies, and meritorious good spirits.\n\nThe Dao is the head, virtue the belly, and benevolence the feet that carry one forward. Heaven establishes lodges and postal stations for those who dwell within them. Those who seek the power of heaven must practice the Dao; those who seek the power of earth must practice virtue; those who seek the power of humanity must practice benevolence. These three are the endless path. To lose them is the root of chaos. To disregard these three is to rebel against heaven.\n\nThus, the sage embraces the Dao, practices virtue, and acts with benevolence. To go beyond this is to belong to the realm of the myriad things.\n\nMay I ask: How do the spirits of the four seasons assist in governance, bringing forth goodness and eliminating evil? Which invokes the great spirits, which the middling spirits, and which the lesser spirits?\n\nTo contemplate the imperial qi of the sun, the moon’s phases, and the establishment of the month is to invoke the great spirits. To contemplate the ministerial qi is to invoke the middling spirits. To contemplate the destructive qi is to invoke the lesser spirits. To contemplate the aged qi following the moon’s establishment is to invoke aged beings. To contemplate the ailing and declining qi following the moon’s establishment is to invoke malevolent ghosts. To contemplate the dead qi following the moon’s establishment is to invoke pure ghosts. To contemplate the broken qi following the moon’s establishment is to invoke destruction, slaughter, misfortune, and harm.\n\nThe generative qi belongs to heaven, to yang, to what lies ahead. The heavenly Dao uses spirit qi to give life, thus the six spirits before the Dipper are all generative. The six spirits behind the Dipper belong to earth and to yin. The heavenly Dao uses the dead qi to create ghosts and bring misfortune and calamity to beings.\n\nIf one wishes for future generations to always be reverent and trustworthy, to cherish and love themselves, so that the numinous spirits and essence qi never depart from their bodies, they will neither know old age nor death. For the numinous spirits and essence qi follow the movements of the mind and do not leave the body. When the numinous spirits remain constant, one does not fall ill or age, and one’s journey is not beset by evil. But if the numinous spirits depart, the sick will die at once, and the traveler will encounter misfortune—this is the great proof.\n\nIf one wishes to avoid illness, one must guard their essence with care. In all matters, one must not exceed what is natural, for within the natural there is no spirit. In all matters, if one does not become spirit, one does not surpass the great Dao and the nature of heaven and earth. Without great spirit within, nothing can be accomplished, and one cannot preserve oneself. Thus, the Dao of heaven and earth relies on spirit to act naturally.\n\nTherefore, in all matters, great or small, there is spirit. The great have great spirit, the small have small spirit, and each preserves and nurtures their own spirit to endure. When spirit diminishes, one ages; when spirit departs, one dies—this is the natural division. How can one forcibly contend against it?\n\nIn all matters, safety and peril lie in spirit. Thus, the body is the household, qi the carriage and horses, and spirit the magistrate who governs rise and fall, coming and going. If there is a body but no spirit, it is like having fields, a home, and city walls but no magistrate. The magistrate is the arbiter of life for the people.\n\nLoyal ministers, filial children, and those who greatly accord with the Dao should act accordingly. If one’s body is not loyal to their superior nor filial to their parents, they betray themselves, invite punishment, and lose their foundation. Always contemplate good spirits, and they will gather and follow you. Contemplate evil spirits, and they too will gather and follow you, entering your belly and moving as your thoughts direct, causing distress and restlessness that cannot be forgotten.\n\nMay I ask: The child in the womb does not eat but absorbs qi. The natural qi within the womb is already born, breathing the qi of yin and yang. If one guards the Dao and studies diligently, they return to the natural qi. To return to the natural qi, the heart must be like that of an infant—then life is born. To follow the breathing of the qi of yin and yang is to die.\n\n*End of the Eighth Scroll of the Abridged *Scripture of Great Peace*, Xin Section*",

      "translated_text": "*The Ninth Scroll of the Abridged *Scripture of Great Peace*, Ren Section*\n\nOrdinary people cannot restrain one another, so each must govern their own fate. Those who do evil will be punished by Heaven. Thus, petty men may be punished by mediocre men, mediocre men by superior men, and superior men by the great. Even minor transgressions against the law lead to peril and ruin.\n\nThe judgments of spirits, great and small, follow the same principle. If one cannot restrain themselves, Heaven will surely punish them. Heaven reveres the Dao, and the Dao reveres the natural. That Heaven reveres the Dao is because Heaven embodies the utmost conduct. If the Dao is abandoned and not practiced, the Way of Heaven falls into chaos and ruin, leading to peril and the loss of all laws and measures.\n\nThus, the natural compels the Way of Heaven and Earth to be preserved. When the Dao is practiced without ceasing, yin and yang transmit and bequeath life to one another. The Dao is the master of life; if the Dao is severed, the myriad things will not be born. If the myriad things do not arise, there will be no generations to transmit, and without transmission, all will perish—how then could Heaven and Earth endure? Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, must transmit and beget one another. If this ceases, they will perish. Thus, Heaven fears the severing of the Dao and the ensuing peril.\n\nThat the Dao reveres the natural is because the Way of Heaven cannot be accomplished without it. All things are completed only through the natural; without it, nothing can be truly achieved. Even if something is accomplished, it will be false and cannot endure.\n\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast and distant from one another, their governance of fate allows no escape.\n\nMay I ask: When the qi of Great Peace arrives in full, and one wishes to constantly employ good intentions to dispel wickedness, what should be prioritized?\n\nThe nature of Heaven and Earth is half yang and half yin. Yang is good and governs rewards and bestowals. Yin is evil, and evil brings punishments and penalties, governing deceit and falsehood. When rewards are many and punishments few, when the cunning are many and the rewarded few, the gates of deceit open. The reason is this: when punishments are many and executions frequent, those who violate the law become wicked criminals, thus opening the gates of deceit and multiplying the cunning.\n\nYang governs rewards and bestowals. When its bounty is abundant, virtue and power prevail. Yang and virtue govern nurturance and life—this is the law of the natural. Thus, day is yang, the sun, the ruler, and virtue; night is yin, the moon, the minister, and deceit. The nature of Heaven and Earth is half good and half evil.\n\nTherefore, the noble person, through supreme goodness, shuts the gates of deceit. Those who promote goodness receive goodness; those who promote evil receive evil. This is like pitting a dou against a dou—what is not a dou naturally flees; like measuring with a chi against a chi—what is not a chi naturally falls away. It is as though square and circle cannot align, compass and square cannot meet, and warp and weft cannot join.\n\nThus, when yang arises, it moves in accord with its kind. When fire blazes, thunder roars, and the Vermilion Bird appears within. This is why thunder comes in summer and hides in winter. All things follow their roots—only then can the Way of Heaven be understood. Without tracing their kind, how could the sage and worthy attain profound knowledge?\n\nSince the opening of Heaven and Earth, the goodness, evil, truth, and falsehood of people can be discerned by observing their conduct and seeking its kind. Their success or failure, the good and the bad, the worthy and the unworthy—all can be seen. Why engage in futile disputes?\n\nMay I ask: From ancient times to the present, the worthy, the enlightened, the wise, the eloquent, the strong, and the brave—these six types of people all possess talents a myriad times greater than others. Could they be without good or evil?\n\nThese six possess talents a myriad times greater than ordinary people. If their talents harmonize with Heaven and Earth, preventing the rise of all evil and harmful influences, the emperor will live long without worry, free from illness, fulfilling their natural lifespan, and their benevolence will flow to all people. Such worthy, enlightened, wise, eloquent, strong, and brave individuals are of great goodness and benefit.\n\nYet if they cannot harmonize with Heaven and Earth, if the emperor suffers worry and short life, if they themselves fall ill, are afflicted by disasters they cannot dispel, or die prematurely like ordinary people—then these six are of no benefit. One need only examine their achievements. Those who succeed are right; those who fail are wrong.\n\nActing thus aligns deeply with the will of August Heaven. The emperor’s lifespan is extended, and the myriad things are all well-governed.\n\nMay I ask: Among all things, some fail to be born at their appointed time, some are not nurtured, and some do not mature—where do these great faults originate?\n\nWhen things that should be born are not born, the fault lies with Heaven. When things that should be nurtured are not nurtured, the fault lies with Earth. Heaven and Earth are the dwelling of the myriad things; the worthy are their artisans. The emperor embodies Heaven and constantly desires to give life. The empress embodies Earth and constantly desires to nurture. The great ministers embody humanity and constantly desire to bring things to completion. When these three work in unison, all things, from birth to end, suffer no harm.\n\nTo emulate the Way of equilibrium, those who establish laws must do likewise.\n\nMay I ask: Does the Way of Heaven aid the weak, the strong, the few, or the many?\n\nThe divine person says: The Way of Heaven aids the weak.\n\nWhy? The weak are the function of the Dao. The few are the essence of the Dao. Thus, the North Star, though one, commands the host of stars—ruling the many with the few. The essence of the Dao is one, and the Dao follows it.\n\nTherefore, the king is few, yet the world aids and governs itself—this is the efficacy of aiding the few. Parents, though strong, instead aid the infant—this is the efficacy of the strong aiding the weak.\n\nThe supremely good are few and weak, while the ungood are strong and many. Yet when many, they become few; when strong, they become weak. Thus, the noble person seeks weakness, not strength; seeks fewness, not multitude. Therefore, the Way of Heaven protects them.\n\nThey do not contend with others, yet others contend among themselves. They do not vie for strength, yet others aid them in becoming strong. Thus, without contention, they achieve good victory.\n\nDistinguish the essence of the Way of Heaven from the body and virtue without separation.\n\nMay I ask: If the Dao is truly joyful and desirous of practice, what is its clear proof?",

      "translated_text": "The Divine Person says: I received this text from the celestial deities, who declared, \"We hear that it harmonizes with yin and yang, wind and rain, cold and heat—this is its great efficacy. Heaven delights in the practice of its Way, yet people do not clearly believe in it, so we demonstrate its efficacy by granting or withholding rain. When the Way of Great Peace is practiced, all prayers are answered. When the Way of Great Peace is not practiced, prayers go unanswered, clearly showing that the Dao of Heaven resides in Great Peace.\n\nThus, when the myriad things fail to be born, the fault lies in the Great Yang. When born but not nurtured, the fault lies in the Great Yin. When nurtured but not brought to completion, the fault lies in the harmony of the center. Therefore, birth is the father, nurturing the aged is the mother, and completion is the child. Birth is the Dao, nurturing is virtue, and completion is benevolence. If a single thing is not born, one aspect of the Dao is blocked and obstructed. If a single thing is not nurtured, one aspect of virtue is left uncultivated. If one aspect of virtue is not completed, one aspect of benevolence is not practiced. To know for oneself whether one possesses the Dao, virtue, and benevolence, observe the myriad things and you will know.\n\nFor the Five—Emperor, King, Lord, Father, and Teacher—who deeply wish to understand the excellence or deficiency of the Dao, virtue, and benevolence, they need only observe this. Thus, the foremost good in governance is none other than delighting in birth; the next good is delighting in nurture; and the next is delighting in bestowal. Therefore, birth resembles Heaven, nurture resembles Earth, and bestowal resembles benevolence. These three are the great principles of Heaven, Earth, and humanity. Those below this are merely reserved for times of exhaustion before being employed.\n\nWhen this is so, the qi of Heaven naturally becomes peaceful, perverse qi naturally vanishes, good people naturally arrive, and evil people naturally depart—all respond without fail. The one who clarifies this is the Teacher, for the Teacher is the title of the one who knows first and should take evidence as the basis for clarification. From ancient times to the present, all texts emerge from Heaven and Earth; thus, Heaven and Earth produce them first, and the one who clarifies them is the Teacher. Therefore, every text that emerges has a Teacher, and the one who practices it is the magistrate.\n\nIn ancient times, the Emperor and King received the Mandate of Heaven, accepted the Teacher’s instruction, and diligently practiced it to eliminate disasters and calamities, thereby fulfilling Heaven’s will. This is how they attained longevity and extended their mandate. The Creator is Heaven, the clarifier is the Teacher, and the practitioner is the Emperor and King. These three matters depend on one another to be accomplished. If Heaven does not produce the text, the Teacher has no way to know it; if the Teacher does not clarify the text, the Emperor and King have no way to know how to govern.\n\nThus, when Heaven intends to raise up an Emperor or King, there must be an extraordinary text that emerges, and a wise Teacher is sent to instruct the Emperor, King, and magistrates, enabling them to attain longevity—this is the clear proof of Heaven’s protection of the Emperor and King.\n\nWhen the people and the myriad things fail to be born, are born but not nurtured, are nurtured but do not grow, grow but do not reach completion, or do not fulfill their natural lifespan, where does the fault lie? When the people and the myriad things are not born, it is Heaven’s fault; when they are not nurtured, it is Earth’s fault; when they grow but do not reach completion, it is humanity’s fault. Does the fault lie with humanity?\n\nWhen the myriad things do not receive the timely opportunity to be born, it is the ruler’s fault; when born but not nurtured, it is the minister’s fault; when they grow but do not reach completion, it is the people’s fault. Heaven and the ruler-father preside over birth—this is the leadership of the Great Yang, the origin of birth. If Heaven does not desire birth, things cannot be born; if the father does not desire to bestow, things also cannot be born; if the ruler does not desire birth, things also cannot be born. Thus, Heaven and the ruler-father preside over birth.\n\nIf the ruler-father constantly contemplates birth and does not delight in killing, all things will flourish. A single thought of killing results in the death of one thing; ten thoughts of killing result in the death of ten things; a hundred thoughts of killing result in the death of a hundred things—from this up to ten thousand thoughts, all are like this. The Earth-mother and ministers, receiving the bestowal of Yang, preside over the nurturing and growth of the myriad things. Do they constantly contemplate nurturing without fail? A single thought of failing to nurture injures one thing; ten thoughts injure ten things; a hundred thoughts injure a hundred things—from this up to ten thousand, it is likewise so.\n\nThus, the Emperors and Kings of high antiquity, in appointing ministers, always sought those who were compassionate and benevolent, who delighted in nurturing the myriad things and governing accordingly. In middle antiquity, they were half compassionate and benevolent, so half of the things were harmed. In later antiquity, they did not carefully select and appoint ministers, so all the myriad things were harmed. The virtue of the August Emperor and King is radiant indeed!\n\nThe Emperor acts as wisdom between Heaven and Earth, preventing them from falling into calamity and evil—thus he is called Emperor. The King is one to whom the people and the myriad things turn without harm—thus he is called King. *Wang* means \"to go forth.\" The Lord ensures that each remains within their proper bounds, and people turn to him without harm—thus he is called Lord. *Jun* means \"title.\" The official governs and assists the superior in managing things, ensuring that all people and things, great and small, do not lose their proper governance—only then is he worthy of being called an official. The Teacher thoroughly understands all the words under Heaven—only then is he worthy of being called a Great Teacher, that is, one who can interpret all the texts of Heaven and Earth. Thus, they are worthy of being called August Emperor, King, Lord, and Teacher.\n\nTherefore, the August Way is the head, the Emperor’s Way is the torso, the King’s Way is the thighs, and the officials are the hands and feet. The Teacher’s Way is the plumb line, the law, and the standard, upon which the above and below depend to stand. Thus, those who govern well constantly contemplate the August Way, moderately contemplate the Emperor’s Way, and below contemplate the Lord’s and officials’ Way. They constantly recite the Great Teacher’s laws and standards, adhering to their plumb line. Only then can Heaven’s will be at peace, Earth’s intent be attained, the four seasons naturally follow their course, the Five Phases do not contend, the Three Luminaries remain bright, ghosts, spirits, and essence-qi do no harm, the Five Offices and Five Scholars each attain their proper place, bandits and thieves do not arise, and the Emperor and King govern with folded arms, all proclaiming \"ten thousand years.\"\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is the law—without my text, it is truly difficult. Carefully ponder its meaning and practice these two matters; there are also warnings therein. The nature of Heaven and Earth is such that essence, qi, ghosts, and spirits act, governing, learning from, and teaching people. The spirit resides in the yin of the human heart, essence resides in the yin of human worthiness, and ghosts reside in the yin of the human liver. When people contemplate upright goodness, they thereby teach others to do good. They constantly reside in the yin of the viscera, urging people toward evil and teaching them to do evil, thereby also urging people toward evil.",

      "translated_text": "The sages and worthies of antiquity constantly harbored yin thoughts of goodness within their bellies, thus receiving good responses. Ordinary people constantly harbor yin thoughts of evil within their bellies, thus receiving evil responses, unable to restrain themselves. The fault lies in the constant yin contemplation of good and evil; ghosts and spirits thereby incline toward good or evil. That ghosts reside here can be verified. When the qi of Great Peace prevails, wind and rain come in their seasons, the myriad things flourish and grow abundantly, and the earth is well-fertilized, becoming daily more robust and prosperous, capable of nurturing life. In inauspicious years, rain and moisture do not come in their seasons, the myriad things on earth grow sparse and few, short and stunted, unable to fertilize themselves, so the earth becomes daily poorer and thinner, with little possibility of bringing the myriad things to fruition.\n\nThe movements of Heaven and Earth still require the mutual attainment and harmony of yin and yang before Great Peace can be achieved, thereby bringing about the officials of the four seasons and five phases. The Emperor and King govern according to the monthly establishment before and after; their office is to manage the Emperor’s qi and expel the officials of evil and wickedness. The establishing qi and the kingly qi are indeed the Emperor’s qi of Heaven’s four seasons and five phases. The ministerial qi and the removing qi come before the first, serving as the officials who straighten the forelocks and point directly ahead. What they face are hidden villains, prevented from acting harmfully. The removing qi, the filling qi, and the pacifying qi are all good and virtuous officials. The five executors who reside in the forefront act in advance as the Emperor’s qi, executing and removing great evil. The five generals who establish the forefront all receive the correct qi of Heaven, all being divine officials of Heaven, serving as Heaven’s envoys. Without exception, the ten thousand things of the twelve thousand categories all don the virtue of these officials and follow their transformations.\n\nWhen the kingly qi should die, when the monthly establishment should be broken—this is the most revered and majestic qi, thus it cannot be withstood. When it should die, it is called the great consuming killing qi. The period after the monthly establishment is closed, blocking and sealing away evil and villainy, fearing that the resting and hidden qi that follow may encroach upon the Emperor’s establishing qi. Thus Heaven closes what comes after, and when it opens again, it dispels the resting evil qi, teaching it to depart. What comes after becomes the accomplice of villainy, so it should be gathered in. The latter five are perilous; perilous because their position is near Heaven’s great executioner, and with one turn, destruction strikes, hence it is perilous. These latter five generals Heaven wishes to rest, aligning them with Earth’s qi, governing closure and concealment, where villainous ghosts and spirits reside together, and they must not be employed.\n\nSomeone asked: The north is the beginning of the Sovereign, the east is the beginning of the Emperor, the south is the beginning of the King, and the west is the beginning of the Hegemon. Now Heaven has the six jia and twelve branches; where should the Sovereign’s Way begin? It is thus: Heaven has three systems, each with great absence. The first is the Heavenly Sovereign, the second is the Emperor, the third is the King, and the fourth is the Hegemon. The Heavenly Sovereign begins with the first jia-zi, the Earthly Sovereign begins with yi-chou, the Human Sovereign begins with bing-yin, and the Hegemon’s Way begins with ding-mao. These are the celestial reckonings of qi and numbers. As for the earthly reckoning, the Sovereign’s Way begins with zi, the Emperor’s Way begins with chou, the King’s Way begins with yin, and the Hegemon’s Way begins with mao. These four, having initially received the subtle qi of Heaven and Earth to bring forth life, must not incur punishment. Those who incur punishment harm the Sovereign’s Way; the Way’s law must not be harmed. Thus, zi punishes mao, chou punishes xu, and yin punishes si—all emit punitive qi and do not reside together.\n\nSomeone asked: Heaven bestows ranks upon people according to degree, Earth bestows ranks upon people according to degree, and people bestow ranks upon people according to degree—may this be heard? It is said: Heaven bestows upon people through the Dao, Earth bestows upon people through nurturing virtue, and people bestow upon people through emolument and sustenance. Why? Heaven, by means of the Dao, is distinct and enduring, thus it bestows the Dao, enabling longevity and satiety through consuming wind and qi. Earth, governing the nurturing of good land, makes people prosperous, thus it bestows upon people with virtue and wealth. The ruler bestows upon people with emolument and sustenance, granting them clothing. These three matters are all good. Those who love the Dao without ceasing are thus bestowed by Heaven. Those who love virtue and the earth, knowing how to select land to dwell in, avoiding misfortune and attaining good fortune, are bestowed by Earth. Those who love learning and benefit the governance of their superiors cannot be distanced by the ruler and father, who must manage affairs with principle, thus they are bestowed by people. These are the three matters the sages and worthies of antiquity diligently studied, never daring to lose. Thus, some attained the Dao and departed, some withdrew from the world and returned to the earth, and some obtained the ruler’s emolument and sustenance.\n\nSomeone asked: As for the enjoyment of the five notes, what is it like to attain their sound, and what is it like not to attain their sound—may both be heard? Sound is not empty; it achieves true matters, brings reality through emptiness, and is the method of summoning the embodied from the formless. Music, through sound and resonance, summons matters—like a person opening their mouth to emit sound, which may be good or evil. Good brings fortune, evil brings misfortune. This scripture all emerges from the human mouth, thereby bringing responses of good and evil. The sounds of music are the language of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang and the five phases. By listening to their sounds, one knows the sentiments of Heaven and Earth, the harmony of the four seasons and five phases’ qi—there is no end to what can be known. Thus, the superior person attains its meaning to govern with balance and measure; the middling person employs it to assist the ruler in governance and attain longevity; the worthy person employs it to attain freedom from worry. Sound, uniting one with the myriad things, the myriad things uniting without limit, all under Heaven is fully prepared.\n\nSomeone asked why *The Scripture of Great Peace* has one hundred seventy scrolls. It is said: The number one is the beginning of all numbers. Thus, when Heaven and Earth were not yet divided, accumulated qi formed a single unity. Divided into two, they became husband and wife. Heaven spread upon Earth, conceiving in the dark and obscure, named jia-zi, spreading roots in the northeast. Chou became the beginning of yin, appearing in the east. The sun rises at mao, completing birth in the southeast. Chen and si hang branches in the south, nurturing at wu, turning old toward the southwest, wei and shen, maturing in the west. The sun sets at you, completing concealment in the northwest, xu and hai.",
      "overlap_context": "he nature of Heaven and Earth is such that essence, qi, ghosts, and spirits act, governing, learning from, and teaching people. The spirit resides in the yin of the human heart, essence resides in the yin of human worthiness, and ghosts reside in the yin of the human liver. When people contemplate upright goodness, they thereby teach others to do good. They constantly reside in the yin of the viscera, urging people toward evil and teaching them to do evil, thereby also urging people toward evil.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, numbers begin with one and culminate in the root of the twelve stems and the foundation of the Five Phases. Therefore, one completes ten and a hundred to achieve fullness. Hence, when Heaven generates things, spring resounds for a hundred days, desiring to bring all to completion. Thus, the celestial Dipper establishes *chen* and is broken at *xu*. *Jian* means to stand—all things fully arise in *chen*. *Po* means to decay—all things fully perish in *xu*. Therefore, numbers descend from Heaven and ascend from Earth across the eight directions, completing ten in fullness. Yin and yang establish and break, moving in cycles of seven, returning to their origin. Following the Dipper’s pointer to clarify affairs, the Dipper’s seven stars illuminate the beginning and end of yin and yang. Thus, *The Scripture of Great Peace* in one hundred seventy scrolls models the numbers of Heaven and Earth, accords with the patterns of yin and yang, and follows the Four Seasons and Five Phases as its practice, not daring to err by even a fraction. To lose this is to sever from Heaven, leaving affairs without foundation, failing to align with the intent of Heaven and Earth, and not following celestial numbers to form scripture—rendering it useless for governing the world. Without modeling the laws of Heaven and Earth, it cannot dispel harm. To know its efficacy: gather the scattered texts of the world, amass them across thirty *li*, and even if Heaven were to enact them, they could not dissolve disasters. Beneath the great Heaven, within eighty-one regions and ten thousand one hundred states, each possesses its own writings, all desiring to eliminate evil, bring forth goodness, and dispel calamities. Yet if all were collected and assembled within a hundred *li*, even if raised to Heaven, they could not eradicate disasters. Though these texts are few, if the emperor and kings could practice them, they would surely await manifest efficacy.\n\nIn highest antiquity, the first were the Divine Persons, the second the Perfected Persons, the third the Immortals, and the fourth the Dao Persons—all modeled Heaven to grasp the true intent of the Dao. Dazzling the eyes to look inward, they ordered their minds within, their hidden brightness reversing to penetrate the Great Yang, inwardly attaining the essentials of the Dao alone. Like fire making light shine within but not without, they preserved constancy without disorder. Those who now study transcendence of the world model the ancients by turning their gaze inward—this is what it means. Over time, transmission begets transmission, and it again declines, turning daily to loathe its own deeds. Transmission loses the Dao’s intent, failing to illuminate within, and daily grows more disordered. Thus, Heaven produces sages, modeling celestial patterns to order the world, for celestial patterns are self-evident. When celestial patterns are correct, Heaven is correct; when earthly patterns are correct, Earth is correct; when human patterns are correct, humans are correct. When Heaven, Earth, and humans are all correct, the myriad things are wholly correct. Humans are the foremost of the myriad things. If humans lose their proper role and suffer harm, not dying of old age, the myriad things follow suit, as do Heaven and Earth. Perverse *qi* surges greatly, and people fall ill, not exhausting their Heaven-appointed years. Only the practices of past and present each have their proper sequence, not transgressing one another.",

      "translated_text": "The Most Exalted Divine Sovereign of the Highest Antiquity, who names himself the Duke of Entrusted *Qi*—also called the Great Spirit—dwells perpetually at the left side of the Celestial Lord, presiding over the governance of the texts of the Luminous Hall’s patterns, ensuring their distinctions are clear and their great duties meticulously administered. He enables the ruler to commune with the immortals, recording those yet unborn, each with their names, years, months, days, and hours. When the time for their ascension arrives, spirits are dispatched to instruct and transform their bodies, that they may ascend. Each has their name, years, months, days, and hours; when the appointed time for ascension comes, spirits are sent to instruct and transform them, that their bodies may ascend.\n\nAccording to their wisdom and ability, each is assigned roles without forgetfulness, their distinctions made known, allowing them to declare their own capacities before being entrusted with duties. They submit and proclaim: \"The Great Spirit, supreme above all, oversees the host of spirits, each with their own domains. These must be clearly understood, leaving no room for doubt. The registers of longevity must be meticulously examined. Those of sagely illumination and intent should be granted all that lives beneath the sun.\"\n\nAgain, through ledgers, tallies, and calculations, their accounts are made clear, entrusted to the Bureau of Accounts, which oversees the quantities of money and treasures. All those who must submit accounts do so in advance, and the Bureau of Accounts, in concert with the Ministry of Agriculture, presents them on the thirtieth day of long months and the twenty-ninth of short months, assembling before the Great Spirit of the Luminous Hall. No delay is permitted, as the Celestial Lord commands, and none may miss the appointed time within the first three *ke* of dawn. The Great Spirit of the Luminous Hall, receiving the reports at the fifth *ke*, acts in accordance with the Celestial Lord’s established decrees.\n\nThe Great Spirit receives the Celestial Lord’s mandate and delegates it to the Minister of Agriculture, who in turn transmits it to the subordinate prefectures and kingdoms. Each domain reports what it oversees, submitting ledgers of what is to be delivered to the Ministry of Agriculture. Should any be remiss in timely submission, the Minister of Agriculture reports to the Great Spirit of the Luminous Hall, who then informs the Celestial Lord. A decree is issued to the Minister of Agriculture, commanding the prefectures and kingdoms to hasten compliance, ensuring no delay beyond the prescribed time. The transmission of hours and *ke* is strictly ordered, with no disorder permitted; all documents must be uniform, each with its duplicate.\n\nIn Heaven, there are no disasters of flood or drought, and no records may be falsified with additions or omissions. When the Wheel of Fate turns, no delays or pretexts are tolerated, lest one be found guilty of self-serving deception. Those who become aware of such matters must report them, for Heaven is ever watchful, and transgressions are never pardoned. Let each attend diligently to their duties and clarify their affairs. The Celestial Lord foreknows all, though he does not speak aloud; one must carefully consider his inquiries and not disregard his words.\n\nFloods and droughts are without constancy, disasters and calamities arise together, people fall ill and die in countless numbers—all due to the failure to follow the Celestial Lord’s teachings. The Celestial Lord’s decrees are issued to the Great Spirit, the ministers and officials of the two-thousand-*shi* rank, and all spirits in office, charging them to devote themselves wholly to loyalty and action, aligning their hearts with the Celestial Lord’s will. The Celestial Lord, together with the masters of transformation, rectifies those worthy of ascension. Each is made to embody divine radiance, their transformations corresponding to their rank and station, all ordered by hierarchy and office.\n\nThe Celestial Lord commands the Great Spirit to perpetually transform and perfect them. Each person measures their own capacity, their aspirations growing daily, yearning for ascension. Their transformed bodies shine with luminous splendor, visible even at midday, their pure spirits penetrating all, drifting and roaming beyond the eight directions. They observe Heaven’s works, discerning its movements, each following what is fitting. Their audiences with Heaven occur on fixed days. At the establishment of each month’s first day, the greater and lesser spirits arrange themselves in order, their ranks and precedence clearly delineated.\n\nThe morning court assemblies of the great ministers do not exceed the dawn gathering; the host of spirits each clarify their domains, conducting inspections without fixed schedule, ensuring the accuracy of their documents and holding accountable those in office. Those who have matters to report must first open the Luminous Hall before speaking. Each must demonstrate their clarity and bear their responsibilities, never lacking in merit or efficacy.\n\nThe Celestial Lord commands the Great Spirit and the assembled officials to rectify their deportment, ensuring no errors or deviations, each examining their domains according to the statutes. Should Heaven become aware of their faults, they will not be absolved. Let each be vigilant in their duties, lest they be found wanting by the spirits.\n\nThe Celestial Lord commands the Great Spirit: \"Within the prefectures and kingdoms, those of sagely wisdom and intent, who constantly yearn for the arts of life and wish to walk the path of divine immortals, aligning their thoughts with Heaven—those who desire to bestow kindness upon others, contemplating generation and transformation, aiding Heaven in governing life and Earth in nurturing form, and who aspire to benevolent transformation—let their names be submitted to the Great Spirit, with their merits recorded in documents, their trustworthiness attested. Their intentions shall be reported, and the Celestial Lord will personally determine their number, each recommended spirit being held accountable. The prefectures and kingdoms must select only the most excellent.\"\n\nThe Celestial Lord commands the Luminous Hall: \"All who serve the Celestial Lord in governing the myriad offices must cultivate impartiality of heart. Each must act within their Heaven-appointed domains, ensuring order and distinction, devoting themselves wholly to loyalty and sincerity, communicating all they know, striving to perfect their works and govern their affairs. Let their reputations be steadfast and their insights advanced; let their voices carry far, their thoughts expressed without reserve. Though the Celestial Lord foreknows their words, how can one conceal anything and fail to act with utmost loyalty?\"\n\nIt is asked: \"Now, wishing to further illuminate the methods of sagely worthies and benevolence, and to utterly eradicate perverse texts, how can this be made clearer?\"\n\nHeaven suffers from these false and deceptive texts, which must be abolished to embrace the clarity of Heaven’s Dao. The texts of the sages of past and present are the means by which Heaven and Earth are ordered. When the texts of the sages are luminous, the Dao of Heaven is greatly ordered. What the August Heaven finds displeasing and unjoyful gives rise to warfare, floods, droughts, and unending disasters. The rulers grieve, saying that the texts of the sages have gradually fallen into disorder and obscurity, hence the Dao of Heaven is clouded and difficult to govern. When the texts of the sages are disordered, the Dao of Heaven is likewise disordered; when the texts of the sages are abandoned and unused, the Dao of Heaven is also abandoned and unused.",

      "translated_text": "---\n\nSomeone asked: \"In ancient times, there were no texts, yet the Dao of Heaven was not in disorder. At that time, the celestial contract had not yet emerged. The Supreme August Ones, the divine beings, and the ancestral spirits governed the primal ancestors, originally sharing the same body as August Heaven. Over time, they drifted far from the Dao of Heaven, and chaos arose as they no longer understood Heaven’s intent. Thus, Heaven produced the contract, causing the sages to record and transmit it. Yet the sages did not remain long, so they inscribed it and left it for later generations. When the qi of Great Peace arrives, the Dao of Heaven will be properly ordered.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"If one wishes to govern qi and affairs to attain longevity, may this be heard?\"\n\"Carefully consider my words: August Heaven has its constant laws. For those who rule as sovereigns, they must emulate Heaven and act accordingly, employing the three norms of Dao, virtue, and benevolence. If the sovereign delights in desirelessness and tranquility, in the morning they must constantly contemplate the Dao, at midday they must constantly contemplate virtue, and in the evening they must constantly contemplate benevolence—then there will be no affairs at all.\"\n\n\"May I hear why in the morning one contemplates the Dao, at midday virtue, and in the evening benevolence?\"\n\"The Dao of Heaven may be followed but not opposed. Those who follow Heaven prosper; those who oppose it perish. Now, may I speak of its essential meaning? Heaven has four seasons and three divisions: morning governs generation, midday governs nurturance, and evening governs bestowal. Thus, the southeast generates, the southwest nurtures, and the northwest bestows. Therefore, humans emulate Heaven in their conduct: in the southeast, they plant and generate; in the southwest, they nurture and grow; from mid-autumn onward, within the summer months, they dwell, marry, and transmit their kind—this is the natural teaching of August Heaven. Thus, the people silently follow it. Those who can constantly emulate this attain Heaven’s intent. Those who cannot emulate this are called opposers of Heaven’s teachings, and thus they inflict much harm. If the harm is slight, spring things are harmed; if the strong and mature are harmed, summer things are harmed; if the elderly are harmed, autumn things are harmed; if the pregnant are harmed, winter things are harmed—this is the natural law. The sage-kings of antiquity constantly reflected on the Dao of Heaven in their actions, not daring to err even by the slightest measure.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Is it possible to hear how one may attain enduring thickness with the Earth?\"\n\"Those who constantly follow what Heaven does will long share thickness with Heaven; those who lightly oppose it will long incur Heaven’s enmity. Thus, the governance of the ancient sage-kings consisted of: first, constant generation; second, constant nurturance; and third, constant bestowal. Acting in this manner, they carefully upheld and revered the name of the Dao of Heaven, which is not disordered. Fourth is governing through punishment without order, and fifth is killing—these are the extremes. By this distinction, the first type of sovereign purely generates, the second purely nurtures, the third purely bestows, the fourth purely punishes, and the fifth purely kills. Those who generate extend years and prosper the state; those who nurture increase lifespans; those who bestow commit no transgressions; those who punish incur illness; and those who kill meet violent ruin. The sage-kings of antiquity observed Heaven’s prohibitions clearly and dared not act recklessly. On the days when the six *jia* and prosperous *qi* were in ascendancy, they did not rage nor speak of evil matters. On such days, they spoke only of good things, partook in food and drink, and made music to halt disasters and dispel inauspicious and malevolent influences. Thus, the royal *qi* always desired to manifest reverence. Therefore, the people of the ancient era who measured the world, and the governance of the sage-kings who followed this, could lie down to govern and reflect, completing their tasks without a single affair. In spring, they lay with their heads to the east; in summer, to the south; in autumn, to the west; in winter, to the north; and during the four seasons, with their heads toward the corners. When rulers, ministers, and the people all knew this method, the inauspicious *qi* of the world was entirely dispelled. The celestial model of governance required that on royal days, weapons from the armories be taken down and buried in the earth. On days of rest and cessation, they were returned, so banditry did not arise, and warfare ceased.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Does Heaven alone grow angry and not respond in harmony with humans—can this be known?\"\n\"Heaven’s principle uses *qi* as its language, manifesting in the four seasons. If the *qi* of the *jue* (wood) angle is unknown, the liver’s pulse does not move, the *jue* cluster is not harmonized, and the clear tone does not resonate—this is when Heaven is displeased and does not speak. The sage-kings of antiquity, seeing this, reflected on the principles of gain and loss to reverse it. When the royal *qi* resides in a place, it attains benevolence to assist its governance. These two *qi* together generate and complete this. When the *qi* of rest and cessation returns, inauspicious *qi* arrives to assist its governance—this makes three *qi*. The *qi* of petty people appears in this, lacking the alignment of Heaven’s position, thus resembling petty people. Heaven sees and illuminates its kind, commanding the worthy and sagely to devise strategies and reflect, seeking reclusive Daoists, virtuous ones, and benevolent ones to reverse and restore its *qi*, establishing resonance. Thus, the ruler who governs the Dao of Heaven uses the people and ministers as limbs; if the governance is not good, the Dao is thrown into disorder. When the sages of antiquity were about to govern the Dao of Heaven, they sought those of Dao, virtue, benevolence, and wisdom to govern together, thereby attaining peace. Thus, Daoists belong to Heaven, virtuous ones to Earth, and benevolent ones to the center and harmony. If the three norms are not harmonized, the three worthies govern them. When the *qi* of Great Peace arrives, all things are properly ordered.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"How can all the people be made entirely benevolent?\"\n\"The Dao of Heaven generates virtue; virtue generates benevolence. Now, if the sovereign takes the Daoist as their teacher and models themselves on the Dao, the sovereign models the Dao, and their ministers attain virtue. The people model themselves on the ministers; if the ministers attain virtue, the people attain benevolence. The lower emulate the upper, and the upper emulate Heaven. As they transform and generate one another, how can the people not all attain benevolence? The sage-kings of antiquity took great Daoists as their teachers to transform those below. The superior sovereign governs like Heaven, the middling sovereign governs like Earth, and the inferior sovereign governs like humans. Those who govern like Heaven do not lose Heaven’s intent, serving the great Dao as a father. Those who govern like Earth do not lose Earth’s intent, serving Earth’s Dao as a mother. Those who govern like humans do not lose human intent, reflecting on and delighting in attaining the Dao of the center and harmony. The sages, seeing all things generated, knew the principle of revering the Dao. Seeing all things nurtured, they knew the truth of virtue.\"",
      "overlap_context": "f Heaven is greatly ordered. What the August Heaven finds displeasing and unjoyful gives rise to warfare, floods, droughts, and unending disasters. The rulers grieve, saying that the texts of the sages have gradually fallen into disorder and obscurity, hence the Dao of Heaven is clouded and difficult to govern. When the texts of the sages are disordered, the Dao of Heaven is likewise disordered; when the texts of the sages are abandoned and unused, the Dao of Heaven is also abandoned and unused.",

      "translated_text": "The first is the *Divine Dao Writings*, the second is the *Verified Records of Affairs*, and the third is the *Discourse on Discarding Floridity*—together they are called the *Dao of Great Compliance*.\n\n*Tai* (太) means \"great.\" \"Great\" refers to Heaven. Heaven covers and nurtures the myriad things, its merit being the greatest. *Ping* (平) refers to Earth. Earth is level, yet it nourishes and sustains the myriad things. *Jing* (经) means \"constancy.\" Heaven takes the sun, moon, and five planets as its constancy; Earth takes the mountains, rivers, and waterways as its constancy. When Heaven and Earth lose their constant Dao, the myriad things all suffer calamity.\n\nThe Emperor-King models himself above on August Heaven, below on Primal Earth, and in the center on the warp and weft of the stars, mountains, and rivers, nurturing and fostering the myriad things. Thus it is called the *Dao of Great Compliance*.\n\nDivine Persons, Perfected Persons, Sages, and Worthies each divine for themselves what is right and wrong in the law. In ancient times, Divine Persons divined right and wrong, whether they would attain or not—such matters could be observed immediately. Not only was it obscure and indistinct, but it was luminously clear. The divine Dao is most numerous; when one cultivates and accustoms the body’s spirits, rectifies the heart-mind, nothing remains hidden. Good emerges, evil is suppressed, and one knows the methods of good and ill fortune as if gazing into a mirror.\n\nAt such a time, the worthy and enlightened are naturally at peace. The moment does not return, and things do not respond twice. Thus one attains singular flourishing, harmonizing distant regions. When affairs appear, their responses manifest—take care not to resist or oppose them. Compile them as treasured vessels, and it may be called grasping the heart-mind of Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhen affairs are timely, all duties are fulfilled; the divine Dao arrives, the worthy deliberate, the auspicious come, the perverse do not approach, clarity and brightness appear, the four directions rejoice, recluses and hidden scholars emerge, the heart of Heaven is attained, the arts of governance are obtained, perversity does not arise, natural penetration is achieved, Perfected Persons come to assist, the world responds with goodness, each comes with their own affairs, and confusion and disorder depart.\n\nThis response emerges from the abdomen and issues from the heart-mind—it is like the verification of thunder and lightning. Auspicious responses return from within the heart-mind, following thoughts as they come and go. In an instant, they circulate throughout the world. What the heart-mind desires moves August Heaven; yin and yang shift in response. When speech is utterly sincere, it moves Heaven—this is precisely it.\n\nThoughts can bring forth rectitude or give rise to perversity, all arising from the will. They can move Heaven and Earth, harmonize yin and yang, unite the myriad things, enter to transcend the body, and exit to achieve fame. Worthiness and unworthiness all arise from this. Thus the worthy master it without a single error.\n\nWhen a person has faults within, why does their face turn red? The heart is the ruler of the five viscera, and the ruler is the king. The king upholds rectitude; when there is fault, it is reported to Heaven. When startled, why does the face turn green? The liver is the master of the person, and the person is sorrow. When the liver and gallbladder are agitated, anger arises, thus green appears above.\n\nAll spirits have their respective rulers, corresponding with the myriad things. Thus one must always be cautious and good, aligning with Heaven and Earth, so that calamities cannot arise again.\n\nExternal learning is abundant, internal learning is scarce; external affairs daily flourish, while internal affairs daily decline. Thus people are often sick, and floridity abounds. *Fu* (浮) means \"surface,\" and *hua* (华) means \"tip.\" The Dao of Heaven is distant when it enters human perversity, and one cannot return on their own.\n\nThe *Divine Dao Writings* root themselves in union with yin and yang, aligning with the divine luminaries. The *Verified Records of Affairs* examine and verify differences and similarities, leaving no doubts or errors. The *Discourse on Discarding Floridity* has strayed far from the root, dwelling in the wild. Its texts are disordered and cannot be used regularly; they may only be recorded occasionally.\n\nThose who guard the root govern as if divine. Those who guard the center are slightly disordered and troubled. Those who guard the tip are benighted. Thus the worthy guard the root and caution against the center, never daring to follow the tip.\n\nIf one can guard it without ceasing, goodness will come from all directions—do not resist or oppose it. Compile it as a treasured vessel, and it will never need replacement for ten thousand generations.\n\nCan human effort alone achieve goodness? Can perverse and deviant barbarians be repelled? Can weapons and armor be abolished? Can staffs and ropes fall silent? Can the four directions be at peace? Can roads be open? Can the lord of men be enlightened?\n\nThe divine strategy: when a great person guards it, the four directions are moved; when a middling scholar practices it, their commands and ministers are good; when a petty person practices it, they do not harm one another. Its words are concise, its laws clear—how can the divine writings of divination not be practiced?\n\nIf one cannot uphold it, take care not to harm or restrain perversity—this is the method of self-protection against inauspiciousness. Follow the four seasons and five phases, inwardly and outwardly rectify the body, disperse perversity and repel inauspiciousness. Contemplate and guard the suspended images, act in accord with the qi of the four seasons, harmonize yin and yang, and weave the net of governance to control ghosts and spirits, preventing them from recklessly harming people.\n\nAfter the Beginning of Winter until the Beginning of Spring, vigorously employ the qi of Great Yin, while subtly employing the qi of Lesser Yang.

      "translated_text": "In the sixth month of late summer, the flourishing virtue governs in harmonious union. The royal qi turns to the southwest, returning to the central palace. Its spirit-officials wear yellow garments; contemplating it causes sweetness to arise in the mouth. Each season’s late period, contemplate it for eighteen days.\n\nOn the day of the Beginning of Autumn, the flourishing virtue resides in Metal. The royal qi turns to the west, severing and completing the myriad things. Its spirit-officials wear white garments; contemplating it for forty-five days, extending to ninety days, can dispel illness. Grasping its intent strengthens the bones and grants longevity in old age.\n\nOn the day of the Autumn Equinox, the qi of Lesser Yin prevails, subtly employing the qi of Great Yin. If illness arises in opposition, follow its sequence.\n\nOn the day of the Beginning of Winter, the flourishing virtue resides in Water. The royal qi turns to the north. Its spirit-officials wear black garments. It sharpens the will and sharpens the ears; guarding it for forty-five to ninety days dispels the hundred illnesses.\n\nThese are the qi of the Five Phases and the four seasons. Internally, they can govern the body; externally, they can govern perversities. Thus, Heaven employs them to purify, and Earth employs them to pacify. Heaven employs them to generate, and Earth employs them to store. Humankind employs them to flourish. Those who accord with the seasonal qi are called loyal ministers and filial children.\n\nThis is called the Great Accordance with the Dao of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, the four seasons, and the Five Phases. Thus, the Dao emerges for the benevolent and worthy; it does not arise for the foolish.\n\n**Method for Flourishing the Body and Repelling Disaster:**\nAt ten years of age, the spirit endures for twenty years.\nAt twenty, the spirit endures for forty years.\nAt thirty, the spirit endures for sixty years.\nAt forty, the spirit endures for eighty years.\nAt fifty, the spirit endures for a hundred years.\nAt sixty, the spirit endures for a hundred and twenty years.\nAt seventy, the spirit endures for a hundred and forty years.\nFrom eighty to a hundred and twenty, the spirit is exhausted.\n\nIn youth, the spirit grows; in old age, the spirit wanes. This refers to the spirits of the five viscera, the internal signs. One thousand two hundred and twenty good spirits serve as its envoys, advancing and retreating to oversee and attend. The ten thousand spirits are its people, all following the rise and decline of the person.\n\nThis is the constant principle of Heaven and Earth. If one treats the spirit as a city and skillfully governs it, calming the body and preserving the spirit, then illness will not afflict, and years and longevity will be long. The numinous will protect it.\n\nThus, Heaven and Earth establish the body with tranquility, guard it with the spirit, and flourish it with the Dao. Therefore, if one can be pure and still, embrace the spirit, and not lose clarity in thought, then inauspicious perversities cannot enter.\n\nThe true spirit resides within, causing one to be constantly joyful, content, and without desire for wealth, litigation, or competition for fame and merit. Over time, one can naturally perceive the spirit. The spirit is two feet and five inches in length, and its attire follows the Five Phases and the five viscera.\n\nWhen the ruler is benevolent, the Dao flourishes; when the ruler is yielding, virtue arises. If the heart harbors even a slight perverse intent, distant regions will be thrown into chaos. The spirit-qi circulates swiftly, faster than thunder and lightning. Swiftly return to the numinous luminosity to illuminate the interior, and illness will naturally heal, and the person will naturally govern themselves.\n\nThus, the upper limit of human longevity is a hundred and twenty years, the middle is eighty, and the lower is sixty. Beyond this is premature death. This is because the spirit wanders outside while illness attacks within.\n\nContemplating the fundamental and rectifying conduct causes people to cherish one another. The ancients who sought longevity did not lose the Dao.\n\nHeaven and Earth have constant movements; one cannot depart from the root. Therefore, those who seek peace and long existence must carefully not forget this fundamental origin of the Dao.\n\nThus, illustrations are drawn to instruct later generations. They depict the time when people receive life and destiny, from distant antiquity to the present, without losing the transmission of yin and yang, mutually generating and enduring for myriad generations, never ceasing.\n\nIn decline and flourishing, high and low are balanced. In flourishing, one becomes a ruler; in decline, one becomes a commoner. In flourishing, one attains the Dao; in decline, one receives punishment.\n\nOf filial piety, nothing is greater than preserving the form, for it is the lineage of one’s ancestors, spreading one’s name to later generations. This is called the good person who carefully guides the people. Heaven and Earth love them, the Five Phases bestow merit upon them, the four seasons benefit them, the hundred kings employ them, the myriad people cherish them, ghosts and spirits protect them, and the spirits of the five viscera abide within them.\n\nMeeting once, one gains life; now, one nearly loses it. Departing from my spirit-vessel, one returns to ashes and dust, transforming without constancy, becoming the myriad things again.\n\nDistinguishing forms and appearances, perversities naturally dissipate. Purify the body and practice the method.\n\nThe Dao’s generation of people is fundamentally all essence-qi, and all possess spirit. The temporary appearance is called a person. Foolish people do not know how to return and preserve their spirit-qi, thus losing the Dao. Those who can return and restore their spirit-qi will complete their Heaven-appointed years, or even double them—these are all persons of high talent.\n\nFor those seeking to transcend calamity, the method is as follows: Establish a fasting chamber, secure its doors and windows, and prevent others from entering carelessly. Go daily to test yourself; if not refined, do not force it but leave and return. Proceeding thus repeatedly, gradually refining and becoming familiar, one will find peace. Once at peace, one will no longer wish to leave, nor speak, nor see food and drink, nor hear human voices.\n\nAccumulate goodness through concentrated refinement. Close the eyes and inwardly observe the form and appearance, as if residing in a mirror or gazing at a reflection in clear water—this is called minor accomplishment. Without whips or rods, there is strictness; without weapons or staffs, there is awe. All affairs govern themselves—how can this not be numinous?\n\nThis is called the path to entering the spirit. Guarding three is not as good as guarding two; guarding two is not as good as guarding one. Deeply contemplating these words, one attains the Dao and explores its mysteries.\n\n**Method for Communicating with the Spirit and Transcending Worldly Calamity:**\nHeaven’s generation of people is complete in all affairs. Thus, they are born in ten months, beginning and ending with things. Therefore, one can transcend disaster and calamity and attain Great Peace.\n\nThe superior person studies the Dao to assist the emperor and king, accumulating merit for long endurance. The middling person studies the Dao to transcend their family; the inferior person studies the Dao merely to free their body.\n\nThe Dao emerges for the worthy and enlightened; it does not arise for the foolish. Those who can employ it will be auspicious; those who cannot employ it—would it not be better to avoid harm and injury?\n\nThe worthy and unworthy know the method for themselves.\n\nThe superior person, highly worthy, regards all matters, great and small, with reverence. The middling person reveres half of them, while the inferior person has nothing to revere.",

      "translated_text": "The superior person’s reverence arises from turning inward, not from seeking others. With an open heart and penetrating insight, free from obstruction, they know the root of the primordial qi in its natural state. They honor Heaven and esteem Earth, recognizing that the sun, moon, and arrayed stars; the Five Phases and Four Seasons; the Six Jia spirits and yin-yang; and all creatures that crawl, walk, or sway—none are born in vain. Spirits, demons, and spectral beings within the Six Directions; the inner and outer workings of wind, clouds, thunder, and lightning—none act without purpose. All possess their own spirits and rulers, much as humans have their signs, and thus they are revered without reckless action.\n\nThe middling person, who reveres only half, does not grasp the arts of primordial qi in its natural state. They merely recognize the wind, rain, clouds, and living things before their eyes, yet still claim Heaven has no spirits and show no awe for the arrayed stars, the sun, or the moon—knowing only the Great Fire and the Northern Dipper. The inferior person, however, does not comprehend the vastness of lands, mountains, and rivers; they know only how to till fields, plant what they possess, and manage their household and kin. They do not understand how the Four Seasons and Five Phases govern their steps, but merely follow the seasons to plant and harvest for profit. They deny the existence of the Six Jia spirits and yin-yang, dismissing them entirely.\n\nThrough foolishness, one may study and become worthy; through worthiness, one may study without cease and become a sage; through sageliness, one may study without cease and attain the Dao; through the Dao, one may study without cease and become an immortal; through immortality, one may study without cease and become a perfected being; through perfection, one may study without cease and become a spirit. All arise from unceasing accumulation of study.\n\nOne method is called \"Extending Life and Subduing the Barbarians.\" Though the myriad kinds differ, all may attain long life. Heaven and Earth cherish them, and their bodies remain free from fault. The reason is this: it is called the Way of Great Compliance. When the Dao is achieved, one’s entire life shares the same domain as Heaven and Earth. Those who practiced it in ancient times found the myriad spirits naturally at ease. To know its efficacy, observe how auspicious signs arrive of themselves and misfortunes subside. When emperors and kings govern by it, they need not exert force—knowing and practicing this, the barbarians submit of themselves. Practicing it without cease, one becomes a perfected person.\n\nThus, the teachings of the sages do not require coercion or struggle to succeed; they establish instruction based on natural disposition. The reason emperors and kings can pacify the world is that they pacify it according to the hearts of all under Heaven, thereby winning the hearts of the world.\n\nThis is the ancient scripture of the Dao.\n\nWhen humans are first born, they are called spirits. They share authority with Heaven and Earth, dividing body and form, spirit and essence, qi and affairs, duties and dwellings. Thus, they occupy three realms: one qi becomes Heaven, one qi becomes Earth, and one qi becomes humanity. The remaining qi scatters to complete the myriad things. Therefore, Heaven is honored, Earth esteemed, and humanity valued.\n\nThus, the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors all established teachers, and those with doubts knelt to inquire. Therefore, the state remained orderly, and even disasters could be healed.\n\nThe method for rulers to be free from worry: the path of Great Compliance enables rulers to be without care or trouble, bringing about Great Peace. When Heaven and Earth do not shake violently, when wind and rain do not rage, when the hundred spirits rest in their abodes, the world is free from disaster. When the myriad things each dwell in their proper place, they rejoice without sorrow. How is this achieved? Through benevolence, the emperor and king remain joyful; through the Dao, they are free from suffering. If the emperor and king suffer, the world cannot be at peace.\n\nThe emperor and king are the heart of the world; the ministers are its limbs; the common people are its hands and feet. When the heart is troubled, the limbs act recklessly, the hands and feet move without rest, and the people drift and scatter. This is their natural interaction, and Heaven acts likewise. When Heaven loses the Dao, clouds and qi become chaotic; when Earth loses the Dao, it cannot contain things. The ruler communicates with Heaven. When a child delights in their father, when a minister delights in their lord, when Earth delights in Heaven, and when Heaven delights in the Dao, then the qi of Great Peace may be attained.\n\nWhen Heaven’s qi is once governed, the Supreme August Emperor descends in peace. When Heaven and Earth harmonize, the emperor and king practice my Dao—what fault could there be? The Dao is the heart of Heaven, the head of Heaven. Once the heart and head act, how can the limbs not follow? Thus, deviant spirits naturally dissipate.\n\nDistinguish the strengths of the three qi and return the spirit to guard the body. The qi of Great Yang is Heaven, hence called *shen*. The form is governed by Great Yin, which envelops and nurtures the myriad things, so the spirit and essence are stored in the abdomen—thus, the Earth spirit is called *qi*. Essence is the harmonious essence within the myriad things, advancing and retreating without constancy. The essence of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang together generate the myriad things—this is the reckoning of the Three Systems. Spirit governs life, essence governs nurturing, and form governs completion. These three together constitute the vessel of spirit, modeled after ruler, minister, and people—thus, none can be without the others.\n\nWhen the heart’s spirit stirs, it unsettles the form. If one preserves it without ceasing, it remains where it finds peace; if one does not employ what brings peace, it departs. Begin by teaching what brings peace, and over time, it will naturally settle and not leave.\n\nYin qi and yang qi alternately grind and sharpen each other, thereby generating one another. Human qi likewise circulates through the body, and spirit and essence ride it in their comings and goings. Spirit and essence depend on qi as fish depend on water. When qi is cut off, spirit and essence scatter; when water is cut off, the fish perish. Thus, the Way of nurturing life lies in calming the body and cultivating qi, avoiding frequent anger and joy.\n\nThe enlightened teachers of old taught emperors and kings to calm their bodies, freeing them from worry, so that the rulers could focus inwardly. When Heaven delights, the qi of Great Peace emerges, and nothing fails to be born and completed. When Heaven is angered, the qi of punishment emerges, and nothing escapes harm—all suffer its poison, hence the shared sorrow.\n\nWhen Heaven does not guard its spirit, the Three Luminaries dim. When Earth does not guard its spirit, mountains and rivers collapse. When humans do not guard their spirit, the body dies. When the myriad things do not guard their spirits, they are damaged. Therefore, one must return to it—this is called strength. Failing to return and guard it is called dissipation.\n\nThe harmony of yin and yang: from Heaven comes Earth, from the sun comes the moon, from yin comes yang, from spring comes autumn, from summer comes winter, from day comes night, from left comes right, from outer comes inner, from white comes black, from brightness comes darkness, from hardness comes softness, from male comes female, from front comes back, from above comes below, from ruler comes minister, from *jia* comes *yi*, from *zi* comes *chou*, from five comes six, from wood comes grass, from female comes male, from rooster comes hen, from mountain comes hill—these are the root and handle of the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "The pivot and mechanism of yin and yang are the profound intent of the numinous. They constitute the method for human longevity, governance, and great peace. The three qi unite as one—this is the root of spirit. One is essence, one is spirit, and one is qi; these three share a single position, fundamentally the qi of Heaven, Earth, and humanity. Spirit is received from Heaven, essence from Earth, and qi from harmony between them, together forming the singular Dao. Thus, spirit rides qi to move, essence resides within it, and the three assist one another in governance. Therefore, those who desire longevity must cherish qi, revere spirit, and value essence. Those who wish to rectify great matters should do so through non-action. For non-action begets non-action—this is the eternal law of Heaven and Earth, the art of spontaneity. Like echo follows sound, shadow follows form: the superior person employs it to pacify the state, the middling person to prolong life, and the inferior person to govern the household. This may be called \"achieving without acting\" and \"ordering without governing.\" The great Dao is smooth and broad, not far from the self; by inwardly cherishing one’s body, governance naturally reverts to its source.\n\nThe method for resolving the seven affairs and dispelling delusion:\nTo govern the body with virtue—how much more so to govern the myriad people? To attain the qi of great harmony—how can one be good yet fail to reach it, how can one be at peace? To govern the body with benevolence and righteousness—how much more so to govern the myriad people? How can one be good yet fail to reach it, how can one be at peace? To govern the body with ritual—how much more so to govern the myriad people? How can one be good yet fail to reach it, how can one be at peace? To govern the body with culture—how much more so to govern the myriad people? To be good yet restrain them, preventing wrongdoing—how can one be good yet fail to reach it, how can one be at peace? To govern the body—how much more so to govern the myriad people? How can one be good yet fail to reach it, how can one be at peace? To govern the body by abolishing weapons and warfare—how much more so to govern the myriad people? How can one be good yet fail to reach it, how can one be at peace?\n\nYet these seven affairs cannot be entirely absent, nor can they be purely practiced. The divine persons of antiquity governed their bodies with fundamentals, and only then did they possess great arts for governing the people. They enabled the myriad things to live, each attaining its proper place, making the six directions and eight quarters—near and far—rejoice, ensuring nothing lost its place. Only then could spontaneity prevail, pacifying the eight directions and four reaches, bestowing grace without losing even a hair. If one cannot nurture the root and branches today, how can governance be achieved?\n\nNow, this highest virtue—benevolence, righteousness, ritual, culture, law, and martial arts—these seven affairs differ, and though governance may be good, it may not reach fulfillment. Each has its strengths, yet none can be abandoned, nor can any be purely practiced. To govern the body, pacify the state, and bring about great peace, one must deeply grasp their secrets; to master them is the Dao. Unite them in guarding the One, and though divided, they are without limit. The Supreme Lord enacts this—profound beyond measure, named the model of penetrating illumination.\n\nThe method for teaching the four seas to discern superiority and inferiority:\nHeaven generates humanity in three ranks: the first is Heaven-born, the second Earth-born, and the third of human kind. Those who receive their mandate from Heaven become rulers; those who receive it from Earth become ministers; those who receive it from humanity become the people. The ruler acts in accordance with Heaven, the minister in accordance with Earth, following and serving their superiors. The people belong to the ministers, serving in turn. Only when these three qi govern as one can success be achieved. Thus, when the superior is at peace, his ministers are good. When ministers fulfill their duties, the people follow the constant way. When both people and ministers are good, the ruler is enlightened, and governance endures.\n\nGreat peace is achieved through the Dao in practice. When the three qi are all good and unite in accord, embracing virtue and power without harming one another, the great person governs the Dao to pacify the world, rescuing the four frontiers, extending grace to the barbarians, preventing calamity from arising. Goodness daily manifests, and misfortune cannot come. The middling person studies the Dao to become a state minister, aiding in governance, measuring his household, and averting disaster. The lesser practitioner of the Dao harms his parents, wanders far away, his virtue slight and power meager, merely preserving his body—how can he assist an enlightened king or aid the state? Those who can pacify the four seas receive Heaven’s aid. Ministers assist in governance, consulting with Earth. Those who seek only self-preservation find the Dao narrow and small, unable to achieve governance. These three types of people all transcend the world and attain longevity, though their greatness differs.\n\nThis is the method of spirit’s departure and abiding, the efficacy of the Dao:\nThe divine person says: \"Illuminating conduct and the efficacy of the Dao—whose mandate do they reflect?\" They make people clearly awaken, knowing the source of their mandate and discerning who upholds its rectitude. Humanity follows the pattern of yin and yang in life: yang is always upright, yin always deviant; yang always exists, yin always vanishes; yang always grows, yin always diminishes; yang always generates, yin always destroys. People transform thrice daily, reflecting the three qi. Their governance differs, their distinctions contend, discordant and unaligned. Yet through habituation, one maintains constancy, and preserving the human form brings fortune. Only those with the true Dao can focus their essence and stand apart. The unlearned do not know the efficacy of spirit’s departure and abiding; what is manifest cannot be concealed.\n\nThus, the noble person controls the corpse but not the ghost. When one is not asleep—walking, sitting, speaking—the distinction between right and wrong is clear, conduct upright, words and deeds serving as standards. This is when the human spirit is present. When one closes their eyes to sleep, light and shadow withdraw inward, thoughts arise but are unspoken—spirit remains within. When sleep deepens, spirit departs to wander, the body unable to move, the mouth unable to speak, the ears unable to hear, merging with myriad spirits. Only qi remains—clear proof. Therefore, spirit must be constantly guarded; guarding it brings longevity, losing it exhausts one’s mandate. Those who attain the Dao do so through focused intention, and those who lose it do so through the same.",

The opening and closing of yin and yang are its constant principle.\n\nIt is bestowed upon those of the Dao, enabling the virtuous to practice it, so their lifespan matches heaven and earth. Virtue has degrees of excellence, matters have roots and branches, and all things follow the Dao. Those on the rise encounter goodness; those in decline encounter misfortune.\n\nFor example, land: fertile soil yields goodness, while barren soil yields adversity. The noble align with heaven; the base are mired in marshes. The settled are masters; the wandering are transient guests—all is encompassed by the Dao.\n\nThe virtuous cultivate fortune through their conduct; the wicked cultivate disaster. The virtuous gain it as blessing and power. The exalted ride in carriages by its grace; the lowly walk by its support. The sagely and wise attain liberation through it; the petty, though they gain it, do not harm one another—all is the Dao.\n\nTeachings do not appear twice; time does not return.
