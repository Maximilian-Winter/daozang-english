Remedies for Sudden Collapse from Malevolent Qi**\n\nSudden death may occur after prior illness or while resting in bed, with abrupt cessation of breath—all such cases are termed \"death from malevolent qi.\"\n\n**Remedies:**\n**Method 1:** Take the heart of a green onion and insert it into the nostril—left for men, right for women—penetrating seven to eight *cun*. If blood emerges from the eyes, it is auspicious. Bian Que’s method is similar, but later involves blowing into the ears. Ge [Hong] states this refers to blowing into the nose, hence it is listed as a separate method.\n\n**Another Method:** Have two people cover their mouths with cloth and blow into the patient’s ears, alternating when exhausted. Alternatively, use a tube to blow, while lifting the shoulders and leaning the body away—do not hover directly over the deceased.\n\n**Another Method:** Pierce the ears with an onion leaf. If blood emerges from the ears or nose, do not be alarmed; absence of blood makes treatment difficult, while its presence is a favorable sign. At this time, lift the patient’s hands and suddenly release them. After a moment, the deceased will raise their hands to grasp at others, and when they cry out in pain, cease the procedure. For men, pierce the left nostril; for women, the right, inserting seven to eight *cun* or more. Highly effective.\n\nIt also treats those who have hanged themselves. This aligns with Bian Que’s methods.\n\n**Another Method:** Soak cotton in fine wine, then place it in the deceased’s nostrils, pressing with the hand to force the wine into the nose. Hold their limbs steady to prevent startling them.\n\n**Another Method:** Examine the upper lip’s inner ridge for white spots the size of millet grains, then pierce and remove them with a needle.\n\n**Another Method:** Pour urine over the face several times, and the person will soon speak. This is from Bian Que’s methods.\n\n**Another Method:** Take soap-bean pods the size of large soybeans and blow them into both nostrils; sneezing will restore the flow of *qi*.\n\n**Another Method:** Moxibust the *Chengjiang* point beneath the lower lip’s depression, applying ten cones—highly effective.\n\n**Another Method:** Slit a rooster’s throat and apply its blood to the face; when dry, reapply. Also, encircle the deceased with ashes.\n\n**Another Method:** Use a tube to blow into the lower orifice, having several people take turns. When *qi* flows, the person revives.\n\n**Another Method:** Split open a white dog and press it against the chest. If no white dog is available, a white parrot will also suffice.\n\n**Another Method:** Hold a drake over the deceased’s mouth, sever its head, and let the hot blood drip into the mouth. Simultaneously, use a bamboo tube to blow into the lower orifice, alternating with others when exhausted. When *qi* flows below, the person revives.\n\n**Another Method:** Extract juice from fresh cow or horse dung and pour it into the mouth, ensuring it reaches the throat. If the mouth is clenched, pry it open; if that fails, tap beneath the teeth. If no fresh dung is available, soak dried dung in urine and extract the juice. This is from Bian Que.\n\n**Another Method:** Measure the deceased’s elbow and wrist with a cord—left for men, right for women—then extend the cord from the back down to the base of the spine. Moxibust at this point, then horizontally at half the cord’s length on either side. Apply three cones at each of the three locations, and the person will rise.\n\n**Another Method:** Pinch the *Renzhong* point between the nose and upper lip to rouse them. If unresponsive, roll up the hand and moxibust the crease at the base of the palm, one cone per year of age.\n\n**Another Method:** Moxibust the *Renzhong* point at the base of the nose, applying three cones.\n\n**Another Method:** Moxibust the hairy depression at the base of the big toe’s nail on both feet, applying seven cones. This is Hua Tuo’s method. Some say twenty-one cones.\n\n**Another Method:** Moxibust the navel, applying one hundred cones. Bian Que’s method also states: sever a weasel’s tail, take its blood to drink, and bind the weasel to use as a pillow—the deceased will revive shortly.\n\nAnother version: blow *banxia* powder the size of a soybean into the nostrils.\n\n**Another Method:** Grind *nüqing* into a dose of one *qianbi*, open the mouth, place it in the throat, and administer water or bitter wine—the person will revive immediately.\n\n**Note:** The preceding four methods for reviving sudden death and subsequent *shijue* cases all derive from the transmission of the Wei Minister, as recounted by the Orthodox Unity Perfected One. Bian Que received his methods from Master Changsang; this transmission emerged over twenty years after Ge’s time, so it could not have been known to him. These techniques had long circulated, hence references to the King of Chu or the King of Zhao, with variations in sequence and phrasing.\n\nZhang Zhongjing’s essential formulas include:\n- Pound *xie* (Chinese chive) to extract juice and pour it into the nostrils.\n- Sever a red rooster’s comb, take its blood, and blow it into the nostrils through a tube.\n- Apply the rooster’s comb and blood to the face, encircling it with ashes—the person will rise immediately.\n- Boil pig fat the size of a chicken egg in a liter of bitter wine, then pour it into the throat.\n- Mix fourteen large soybeans with egg white and wine, then swallow them all.\n\nFor sudden death with high fever: boil half a *jin* of alum in three liters of water, then soak the feet up to the ankles.\n\nFor sudden death with closed eyes: straddle a cow facing the deceased, pound *xie* to extract juice and pour it into the ears, and blow soap-bean powder into the nostrils—immediately effective.\n\nFor sudden death with eyes and mouth open and tongue protruding: moxibust fourteen cones behind the fingernails and toenails, then administer Five-Poison pastes or powders containing *badou*.\n\nFor sudden death with limbs flaccid and involuntary voiding: boil a liter of horse dung in seven liters of water, reduce to four liters, and wash the body. Alternatively, take a liter of cow *dong* (thin dung), warm it with wine, and pour it into the mouth.\n\nMoxibust one hundred cones at each of the following points: one *cun* below the heart, three *cun* above the navel, and four *cun* below the navel—the condition will resolve.\n\nFor sudden death in children with vomiting and diarrhea of unknown cause: extract juice from a horse dung pellet and have the child swallow it. If no fresh dung is available, boil dried dung in water to extract the juice.\n\nThe *Emergency Three-Substance Pill* and *Pei’s Paste* are listed under the emergency medicine section; they are particularly effective for sudden death and can be prepared on the spot.\n\nAll cases of sudden death, *zhong’e* (striking by evil), and *shijue* arise from natural *yin-yang* *qi* in heaven, earth, and the human body suddenly becoming obstructed, disconnected, or imbalanced, leading to blockage between upper and lower, or depletion on one side. Even when death seems imminent, revival is possible if the *qi* has not entirely dissipated. At such times, ghosts and spirits may also be involved, so talismans and protective measures can aid recovery.\n\n**Additional Formulas**\nBian Que states: *Zhong’e* and sudden death from ghostly strikes are similar; for those already deceased, these methods may be used in combination.\n- Pound fresh *changpu* (calamus) root to extract juice and pour it in—the person will recover immediately.\n\nFor *shijue* (corpse-like syncope), where the person suddenly dies but the pulse still stirs, listen for faint murmurs in the ears and warmth in the thighs—this method also treats it.\n\nSun Simiao’s formula for sudden death: blow soap-bean powder into the nostrils.\n\n**Second Method for Reviving Sudden Death and *Shijue***\n*Shijue* is a condition where the person suddenly dies but the pulse still stirs, and a faint whistling sound can be heard in the ears, with warmth in the thighs. Even if the whistling is present and the pulse stirs, it is still classified as *shijue*.\n\n**Revival Method:**\nUse a tube to blow forcefully into the left ear three times, then the right ear three times—the person will revive.\n\n**Additional Methods:**\n\nAnother method: Pound dried *u** (calamus) into a piece the size of a jujube pit and place it beneath the tongue.\n\nAnother method: Moxa the philtrum (renzhong) with seven cones, and moxa the perineum one *cun* below the scrotum with one hundred cones. For women, moxa the midpoint between the two breasts. It is also said: Press the philtrum with the fingernail for a long while, or needle the philtrum down to the teeth—the person will revive immediately. These are all methods transmitted by Master Wei from Bian Que’s techniques, as in the case of Prince Zhao’s affliction.\n\nZhang Zhongjing also stated: In *shijue*, the pulse stirs but no breath is present; the qi is obstructed and fails to circulate, hence the person lies still as if dead. Insert powdered *u** (calamus) into both nostrils and blow. Have someone place powdered cinnamon beneath the tongue. It is also said that Bian Que’s method was effective for the King of Chu.\n\nAnother method: Shave the hair from the left temple in a two-*cun* square, burn it to ash, and pour wine down the throat—the person will revive immediately.\n\nAnother method: Measure the arm and wrist with a string—left for men, right for women—then extend the string from the *dazhui* (GV-14) point down along the spine. Moxa the end of the string with fifty cones—the person will revive. This is Bian Que’s secret technique.\n\nAnother method: Apply a hot compress to both flanks. Take soot from the stove the size of a bullet, mix it with fermented water, and administer it. After three or four doses, use a tube to blow into the ears, having three or four people take turns. Alternatively, use a small tube to blow into the nostrils, placing dust from the roof beams the size of a bean inside to ensure it enters.\n\nAnother method: Burn fourteen strands of a white horse’s tail and one white horse’s front hoof, then mix the ashes with vinegar into pills the size of small beans. Open the person’s mouth and administer two pills, then one pill after a short while.\n\nAnother method: Needle *baihui* (GV-20), located five *cun* within the hairline above the nose, inserting the needle three *fen* and reinforcing. Needle the flesh beside the big toe’s nail, three *fen* from the edge, and needle the top of the middle toe three *fen* each. Needle the inner side of the big toe, one leaf of garlic’s width from the tip. Also needle the tip of the styloid process of the ulna on the hand *shaoyin* meridian, one *fen* each.\n\nAnother method: Moxa the *danzhong* (CV-17) point with twenty-eight cones.\n\n**Third Method for Reviving Sudden *Kewu* (Visitation by Malevolent Qi)**\n*Kewu* is a type of *zhong’e* (strike by evil), often contracted at gates or doorways, causing twisting pain, distension, and fullness in the heart and abdomen, with qi surging into the chest. If not treated immediately, it can also kill. The revival method:\n\nMoxa the *renzhong* (GV-26) point at the philtrum thirty times, pressing firmly beneath the nasal columella. Soak glutinous rice in water, extract one to two *sheng* of its juice, and administer as a drink. If the mouth is locked shut, force it open with an object.\n\nAnother method: Pound ink, mix with water, and administer one *qianbi* of the solution.\n\nAnother method: Use a bronze or earthenware vessel to hold hot water, placing the vessel on the abdomen. If it cools, remove clothing and press the vessel directly against the skin. If it grows very cold, replace it with hot water. Cease when recovery is achieved.\n\nAnother method: Layer three garments over the abdomen, place a bronze vessel atop the clothing, and gradually burn a small amount of thatch inside the vessel. When the thatch is consumed, add more—do not burn too much at once. Cease when recovery is achieved.\n\nAnother method: Measure the patient’s mouth with a string, then use this length to mark four points around the navel, each one string’s distance away. Moxa each point three times, igniting all four fires simultaneously. This brings relief.\n\nAnother method: Fold the string used to measure the mouth so that one end reaches the area below the heart. Moxa the lower end five times.\n\nAnother method: Mix one *fangcunbi* of cinnabar with three *ge* of honey and administer. If the mouth is locked, force the teeth apart to administer.\n\nBian Que’s method for treating *kewu* includes emergency talismans and a ritual involving *guan* (ablution) decoctions, but as these are not easily practiced by common people, they are not recorded here. This condition corresponds to what is now called *zhong’e* (strike by evil), and it resembles *sudden death by ghostly assault*. Treatments may draw from all these methods.\n\nFor those already dead: Pound fresh *changpu* (calamus) root, extract its juice, and have the patient hold it in the mouth—this brings immediate relief.\n\nFor *kewu* with a corpse-like stillness and inability to speak: Burn two *jiegeng* (platycodon) roots, grind them to powder, and administer.\n\nAnother method: Grind equal parts *xixin* (asarum) and *gui* (cinnamon) into powder and place it in the mouth.\n\nAnother method: Mix rooster’s comb blood with cinnabar, form into pellets the size of small beans, and place three or four into the mouth. This brings relief.\n\nIf the mouth is suddenly locked and cannot be opened: Grind raw *fuzi* (aconite) into powder, place it in a tube, and blow it beneath the tongue—this brings immediate relief.\n\nAnother method: Mix human blood with cinnabar, form into two pellets the size of *wutong* seeds, force the teeth apart, and place them into the throat to swallow.\n\nHua Tuo’s method for sudden *zhong’e* with shortness of breath and near-death: Moxa the area behind the toenail on the big toes, where the hairs converge, fourteen times on each foot. This brings immediate relief. If not, moxa fourteen more times. The previous method for reviving sudden death (thirty-seven moxa cones) has already been described.\n\nAnother essential formula from Zhang Zhongjing: Four *liang* of *mahuang* (ephedra), seventy *xingren* (apricot kernels), and one *liang* of *gancao* (licorice). Boil in eight *sheng* of water, reduce to three *sheng*, and administer in divided doses to swallow. This universally treats all types of *ganwu* (affliction by noxious qi).\n\nAnother method: One handful of *jiugen* (leek roots), twenty *wumei* (mume plums), and half a *jin* of *zhuyu* (evodia). Boil in one *dou* of water, then place the patient’s comb into the decoction and bring to a boil three times. If the comb floats, the patient will live; if it sinks, they will die. Reduce the decoction to three *sheng* and administer as a drink.\n\nAnother method: One *liang* of *gui* (cinnamon), three *liang* of *shengjiang* (fresh ginger), fourteen *zhizi* (gardenia), and five *ge* of *chi* (fermented soybeans). Pound the ingredients, mix with three *sheng* of wine, warm slightly, strain, and administer in one dose to bring relief.\n\n*Feishi Zouma Tang* (Flying Corpse Galloping Horse Decoction): Two *badou* (croton seeds) and two *xingren* (apricot kernels). Wrap in silk, crush, and place in two *ge* of hot water. Knead with the fingers to extract the juice, then administer immediately. Drink within the time it takes to cook rice—this brings relief. Adjust the dosage as needed to universally treat all types of *feishi* (flying corpse) and *guiji* (ghostly assault).\n\nOther pills and powders are recorded in the *Emergency Remedies* section.\n\n*Ke* (visitation) refers to an external presence, and *wu* (affliction) means to offend—thus, *kewu* describes an external qi offending a person. This is generally a malign qi. Though many recover with treatment, it is a qi borne of ghostly or toxic influences. When encountered suddenly, its power wanes, so it cannot be treated like natural malign qi. Once it enters the body and invades the organs, channels, and collaterals, even after recovery, further treatment is advisable to dispel its lingering influence. Otherwise, it may recur and eventually cause harm, leading to periodic outbreaks.\n\n**Additional Formulas**\n\nFrom the *Wai Tai Mi Yao*:\nFor sudden *kewu* (visitation affliction) with suspended corpse syndrome and inability to speak, use equal parts *xixin* (asarum) and *guixin* (cassia heart), placing them in the mouth.\n\nAnother formula: Burn two *liang* of *jiegeng* (platycodon), grind to powder, and take with rice water. Also swallow musk the size of a soybean—excellent.\n\nFrom the *Guang Li Fang*:\nFor sudden *kewu* near death, finely grind one *qian* of musk, mix with two *ge* of vinegar, and administer—immediate recovery.\n\n**Fourth: Formulas for Sudden Ghostly Assault**\nGhostly assault strikes without warning, as if pierced by human force. The chest, flanks, and abdomen twist with sharp, unbearable pain, unrelieved by pressure. Some immediately vomit blood, or bleed from the nose, or pass blood.\n\nAlso called *guipai* (ghostly thrust).\n\n**Formulas for Treatment:**\nMoxa one *zhuang* at *renzong* (the philtrum below the nose)—instant cure. If unresolved, add several more *zhuang*.\n\nAnother formula: Grind equal parts *shengma* (cimicifuga), *duhuo* (angelica), and *mugui* (cassia bark) into powder, and take one *fangcunbi* with wine—immediate cure.\n\nAnother formula: Moxa two *zhuang* one *cun* below the navel.\n\nAnother formula: Moxa seven *zhuang* one *cun* above the navel, and at the white flesh of both heels—recovery follows.\n\nAnother formula: Steep three pieces of processed mugwort the size of a duck’s egg in five *sheng* of water, boil down to two *sheng*, and consume in one dose.\n\nAnother formula: Stir one *sheng* of salt into two *sheng* of water and drink. Also spray cold water on the face, but do not induce vomiting immediately—wait until vomiting occurs, then recovery follows.\n\nAnother formula: Stir a pinch of powder into water and drink.\n\nAnother formula: Blow pure wine into both nostrils.\n\nAnother formula: Sever the head of a white dog, take one *sheng* of its hot blood, and drink.\n\nAnother formula: Drip chicken crown blood into the mouth, allowing one swallow. Then split the chicken and press it against the chest until cold, discarding it by the roadside. A black hen is even more effective.\n\nAnother formula: Boil one *sheng* of calf dung in three *sheng* of wine and consume. An adult ox may also be used.\n\nAnother formula: Burn three *cun* of a scabbard, grind to powder, and drink with water.\n\nAnother formula: Burn rat droppings, grind to powder the size of millet grains, and take with a little water if unable to drink, placing it in the mouth.\n\nOther pills and powders are recorded in the *Emergency Remedies* section.\n\nNow, shamans have truly witnessed people suddenly seized by ghosts or spirits—whether disrupting their ranks, colliding with them, or when their spirit is scattered and weak, or burdened by past transgressions. The mild escape, but the severe often die, much like the tales of Yan Jian—this is no fiction. Even if death is fated, one cannot but attempt rescue.\n\n**Additional Formulas**\nFrom the *Gu Jin Lu Yan*:\nFor demonic possession or *maogui* (cat ghost) illness where the person refuses to name the ghost, pound deer antler shavings into powder, take one *fangcunbi* with water—they will then speak the truth.\n\n**Fifth: Formulas for Sudden Nightmare Unawareness**\nIf one suddenly falls into a stupor while lying down, do not shine fire upon them—fire will kill them. Instead, bite their heel or the side of the big toe’s nail, and repeatedly spit on their face to revive them.\n\n**Other Formulas for Treatment:**\nGrind *zaojiao* (Chinese honey locust) into powder and blow into both nostrils with a tube—they will awaken. This may still work after three or four days.\n\nAnother formula: Insert a hair into the nostril—left for men, right for women—twisting it inward.\n\nAnother formula: Blow into both ears with a reed tube. Also take fourteen strands of the patient’s hair, twist into a cord, and insert into the nostrils. Cut a rooster’s crown for blood, and blow it into the throat with the tube—highly effective.\n\nAnother formula: Grind yellow earth from beneath the stove into powder and blow into the nostrils with a tube.\n\nGrind *xionghuang* (realgar) and *gui* (cassia) into powder and blow into the nostrils—also excellent.\n\nAnother formula: Apply well-bottom mud to the eyes, then have the person hang their head over the well. Call their name, and they will awaken.\n\nAnother formula: Pound *jiu* (leek) for juice and blow into the nostrils. In winter, dig up the roots, extract juice, and pour into the mouth.\n\nAnother formula: Drink salt water, adjusting the amount as needed.\n\nAnother formula: Place the person on the ground, draw a line on the earth with a sharp knife from the shoulder—left for men, right for women—encircling the face. Press the knife’s tip into the patient’s nose, entering one *fen*, and hold firmly without moving. The person will speak as if possessed by ghosts or spirits, begging for mercy. Ask: “Who are you? Why have you come?” They will plead to leave. Then erase the drawn line with your finger a few *cun* from the shoulder, allowing them to depart. Do not omit these questions.\n\nAnother formula: Cover the patient’s face with an earthen steamer, then have someone swiftly smash it—they will awaken.\n\nAnother formula: Hold an ox or horse hoof over the person in a stupor—also effective for sudden death. A black ox is especially good.\n\nAnother formula: Grind *xionghuang* (realgar) finely, sift, and blow into both nostrils with a tube. *Gui* (cassia) is also excellent.\n\nAnother formula: Grind *wanpu* (calamus) into powder, blow into both nostrils, and place some beneath the tongue.\n\nAnother formula: Bind the patient’s elbow with the left cord of a steamer, left for men and right for women. Tightly twist the remaining length, and also bind the feet with hemp. Then inquire about the cause, and loosen the bindings as instructed. Have one person sit at the head to guard, while another calls the patient’s name from inside the door. The seated person responds: “Yes, they are here.” The patient will then revive.\n\nFor sudden stupor without awareness, moxa twenty-one *zhuang* at the *jumao* (hairy spot) beneath the big toe.\n\nFor those prone to nightmares and evil dreams: Place ash from extinguished fire in the shoes and under the pillow.\n\nAnother formula: Wear *xionghuang* (realgar)—left for men, right for women.\n\nAnother formula: Moxa twenty *zhuang* at the *jumao* (hairy spot) above both big toes.\n\nAnother formula: Place a piece of genuine musk by the head.\n\nAnother formula: A tiger-head pillow is especially good.\n\n**Formulas to Ward Off Nightmares:**\nCarry *xionghuang* (realgar) the size of a jujube pit under the left armpit—this ensures lifelong freedom from nightmares.\n\nAnother formula: Place a square of genuine red felt beneath the pillow.\n\nAnother formula: A rhinoceros-horn pillow is excellent; place *qingmuxiang* (costus root) inside the pillow and also wear it on the body.\n\nAnother formula: (For) treating prolonged sudden nightmares, write this talisman on paper, burn it until it turns black, mix with a little water, and place it in the mouth of the deceased. Hang a mirror before the deceased’s ear and strike it, calling the deceased’s name—revival will occur within half a day.\n\nFor those who lie in nightmare-induced stupor without waking, the hun and po souls wander outside, seized by evil. Though they wish to return, they cannot find their way. Firelight must be avoided, for if illuminated, they will never re-enter. However, those who experience nightmares in lamplight do so because their souls originally departed from brightness but failed to return to the body.\n\n**Additional Formulas**\nFrom the *Qianjin Fang*: To treat ghost-induced stupor, use *zaojia* (Chinese honey locust) powder the size of a *daogui* (a small measure) to revive the dead.\n\n**Formulas for Sudden Affliction by the Five Corpses (Chapter Six)**\nThe Five Corpses are: *feishi* (flying corpse), *dunshi* (retreating corpse), *fengshi* (wind corpse), *chenshi* (sinking corpse), and *shizhu* (corpse attachment). The formulas recorded here treat all of them. Their symptoms include abdominal pain and distension, breathlessness, upward surging into the heart and chest, lateral attacks on the flanks, or the emergence of lumps, or spasms radiating to the lower back and spine.\n\nA formula to treat them: Moxa three *cun* behind the nipple, fourteen *zhuang*—left for men, right for women. If unresolved, increase the number of *zhuang*. Recovery will follow.\n\nAnother formula: Moxa three *cun* below the heart, sixty *zhuang*.\n\nAnother formula: Moxa one *cun* below the nipple, on the left or right according to the location of the affliction, increasing the number of *zhuang* until recovery is achieved.\n\nAnother formula: With four fingers, press upon the painful area, then moxa the lower edge of the fingers for several *zhuang* until the patient feels pain. Next, pinch the philtrum above the upper lip, then pinch one *cun* below the heart, increasing the number of *zhuang* until recovery is achieved.\n\nAnother formula: Crack open a chicken egg, and swallow the white at once. If the mouth is closed, insert it into the throat and shake until it is swallowed—recovery will be immediate.\n\nAnother formula: Crack open seven pigeon eggs and swallow the whites at once; do not take a second dose.\n\nAnother formula: Roast the root of *li danglu* (Phytolacca acinosa), place it in a pouch, and apply it alternately as a hot compress, replacing it when it cools.\n\nThough the Five Corpses bear distinct names, their patterns are largely similar, with only minor differences. The *feishi* (flying corpse) roams beneath the skin, piercing through the organs and bowels, causing stabbing pain with each onset, its manifestations ever-changing. The *dunshi* (retreating corpse) lodges in the bones and flesh, boring through the blood vessels; each attack renders the patient untouchable, triggered by the sight of a corpse or the sound of mourning. The *fengshi* (wind corpse) courses through the four limbs, with pain shifting unpredictably; each onset brings confusion, provoked by wind or snow. The *chenshi* (sinking corpse) binds the organs and bowels, surging into the heart and flanks; each attack brings excruciating pain, triggered by cold. The *shizhu* (corpse attachment) weighs down the entire body, disturbing the spirit, causing constant disorientation; it worsens with the changing of the seasons, often leading to grave consequences. This last condition has its own treatment, described later as a compress.\n\nAll Five Corpses arise from corpse-demons within the body that draw in harm; though the classical arts contain methods to dispel them, these are rarely practiced in the world today. Here, I have compiled the essential techniques from the classics to remedy this neglect.\n\n**Formula:**\n\nTake one *liang* of realgar and one *liang* of garlic, pound them together to form a ball roughly the size of a pellet, then steep it in two *ge* of warmed wine and consume. The condition will resolve in a short while. If it does not, repeat the process. Those already afflicted should keep this remedy on hand.\n\n**Another formula:**\nGrind equal parts dried ginger and cinnamon into powder, take a pinch the size of a fingertip, stir-fry until it turns green, then grind again. Mix with water and consume; the condition will resolve.\n\n**Another formula:**\nPound tribulus seeds and form into honey pills.

Move the vessel to follow the pain; when the area beneath the donkey itches, the condition will resolve. If the dwelling has a tiled roof, shave wood from the four corner pillars and burn it instead. This method is exceedingly potent and efficacious.\n\n**Another formula:**\nGrind together one *chi* of cinnamon, one *liang* of ginger, and three croton seeds into powder, mix with bitter wine to form a paste, and apply to the site of the corpse affliction. The condition will resolve once the paste dries.\n\n**Another formula:**\nChop two *sheng* of *Sapium sebiferum* root, boil to produce a thick decoction, strain, and reduce the liquid to five *sheng*. Add one to two *liang* of water, then consume in doses of five *ge* to one *sheng*. Highly effective.\n\n**Another formula:**\nChop several *hu* of honeysuckle stems and leaves, boil to produce a thick decoction, strain, and reduce the liquid.

Consume according to the prescribed method.\n\n**Another formula:**\nDry lacquer tree leaves in the sun, pound into powder, and consume with wine.\n\n**Another formula:**\nThoroughly cook one stove liver, slice, and consume entirely. Garlic paste may also be used.\n\n**Another formula:**\nSever a turtle’s head, burn it to ash, and consume the powder with water in three divided doses. If the flesh-like substance is not fully expelled, the condition may recur.\n\n**Another formula:**\nBoil one *fen* of realgar, fifteen gardenia fruits, and one *liang* of peony root in three *sheng* of water until reduced to one and a half *sheng*. Divide and consume in two doses.\n\n**Another formula:**\nBurn fourteen gardenia fruits to ash and consume.\n\n**Another formula:**\nGrind together one *liang* each of dried ginger and aconite, two *fen* of cinnamon, and thirty croton seeds (with hearts removed, all used raw), sift, mix with honey, and pound ten thousand times. Consume two pills the size of small beans. This remedy treats all conditions without exception.\n\n**For flying corpse entering the abdomen causing piercing pain and death:**\nRhinoceros horn, *shewang*, and the Five Infusion Pills are all excellent remedies, detailed in the major formulas.\n\n**For sudden presence of an object beneath the skin resembling a toad, which later descends into the abdomen like an immobile cup, causing unbearable dragging pain and killing the person within days:**\n**Formula:**\nPound together fourteen croton seeds, one *liang* of gentian, one *liang* each of pinellia and *Trichosanthes kirilowii* seeds, and one and a half *jin* of cinnamon. Divide into two cloth pouches, steam until hot, and alternate applying as a compress. The decoction may also be consumed in small amounts. This originally appears in the miscellaneous treatments under the name \"yin corpse,\" and those afflicted often die.\n\n---\n\n**Section Seven: Formulas for Corpse Infusion and Ghost Infusion**\n\nCorpse infusion and ghost infusion, as Ge states, are the \"corpse infusion\" among the Five Corpses, further compounded by various ghostly harms. The disease manifests in thirty-six to ninety-nine variations, generally causing alternating chills and fever, dribbling discomfort, mental confusion, and indistinct suffering that pervades the entire body. Over months and years, it gradually weakens the patient, leading to death, and after death, it spreads to others, even to the point of annihilating entire households. Upon recognizing these symptoms, one should treat it urgently.\n\n**Formula:**\nTake white mulberry bark, dry in the sun, and burn to ash, yielding about two *dou*. Place in a steamer, steam until the vapor permeates, then remove. Pour three to four *dou* of boiling water from a cauldron over the ash, strain, and repeat three times until the liquid is extremely concentrated. Allow to settle, then take two *dou* of the clear liquid to soak two *dou* of red adzuki beans overnight. Dry in the sun, then soak again in the ash liquid until exhausted. Steam the beans until fully cooked, then prepare a broth with mutton or venison and serve with the beans. Begin by consuming one to two *sheng* until satiated. Mild cases resolve with three to four *dou*; severe cases require seven to eight *dou*. As the disease departs, the body will feel a creeping itch. If the root is not fully eradicated, repeat the treatment. Divinely efficacious.\n\n**Another formula:**\nCrush fifty peach kernels, boil in water to produce four *sheng* of liquid, and consume in one draught to induce vomiting. If the disease is not fully expelled, repeat after two or three days. If no vomiting occurs, it is not an infusion.\n\n**Another formula:**\nGrind together one *liang* of *Asarum forbesii*, one *liang* of stem, half a *liang* of ginseng, fourteen *Trichosanthes kirilowii* seeds, six *zhu* of *Usnea*, and fourteen red adzuki beans into powder. Consume one square *cun* spoonful with warm water at dawn; by evening, one will vomit a hundred kinds of substances. If not fully expelled, consume again later.\n\n**Another formula:**\nDry one otter liver in the shade, pound into powder, and consume one square *cun* spoonful with water, three times daily. If the condition does not resolve, repeat with another liver. Yao states it is divinely efficacious.\n\n**Another formula:**\nGrind together one *liang* each of cinnabar and realgar, half a *liang* each of *Podophyllum* and *Aconitum* (or *Stellera*), forty croton seeds (with hearts and skins removed), and two centipedes. Mix with honey to form pills the size of small beans. If the condition does not resolve, consume two pills. This remedy may also be carried for long-term use.\n\n**Master Yao’s Formula:**\nBurn human hair to ash, roast apricot kernels until purple, and grind them into a paste. Mix with lard and consume pills the size of *wutong* seeds with wine, three times daily, until resolved.\n\n**Other Major Remedies:**\nHua Tuo’s *Fox-Bone Powder*, *Dragon’s Tooth Powder*, and *Sheep-Fat Pills* are recorded in the comprehensive formulas. Also, the *Huainan Pills* bestowed upon Emperor Cheng are effective against *zhuyi* (possession sickness) that extinguishes households. Women and children are often afflicted by *zhuche* (cart possession) or *zhuchuan* (boat possession), causing heart vexation, confusion, headache, and vomiting. Those with such symptoms should employ the following apotropaic formula:\n\n**Apotropaic Formula:**\nTake equal parts of *cheqian* seeds, root bark of *chexia* plum, *shichangsheng*, and *xuchangqing*. Coarsely grind, place half a *ge* in a pouch, and tie it to one’s clothing or head. For *zhuchuan*, if sudden distress arises while boarding, carry this pouch. Alternatively, before entering the boat, carve a piece from the vessel, burn it to ashes, and consume with water.\n\n**Additional Formulas:**\n\n**From *Zimu Milu*:**\nTo treat *shizhu* (corpse possession), burn tangled hair the size of a chicken egg to ash and consume with water until resolved.\n\n**From *Shiyi Xinjing*:**\nFor *chuanshi* (consumptive possession), ghostly qi, cough, *xuanpi* (abdominal masses), *zhuqi* (possession qi), or blood and qi blockage leading to gradual emaciation: Take one *liang* of peach kernels, remove skins and tips, crush, and boil in one and a half *sheng* of water. Use the decoction to cook rice porridge and consume on an empty stomach.\n\n---\n\n**Section Eight: Remedies for Sudden Heart Pain**\n\nFor sudden heart pain, boil white peach bark and consume the decoction on an empty stomach.\n\n**Another formula:**\nTake either cassia powder or dried ginger powder—either may be used alone.

Strain and consume entirely.\n\n**Additional Remedies:**\nBoil *yiyiren* root thoroughly and take three *sheng* of the decoction.\nBoil twenty *bilun* coins in five *sheng* of water for three boils; take three times daily.\nPound *xiangcai* to extract juice and consume one to two *sheng*.\nBoiling dried ginger in water is also effective.\nAlternatively, use the previous method for heart pain with *zhizi* and *chi* decoction.\nBoil one *liang* of *huangqin*, twenty apricot kernels, and one *liang* of *muli* in three *sheng* of water until reduced to one *sheng*; consume at once.\n\nFor reversal cold with fullness and constant retching:\nGrind two *liang* each of *xiaocao*, cinnamon, *xixin*, dried ginger, and *jiao*, along with two *liang* of blast-fried *fuzi*, mix with honey, and form into pills the size of *tong* seeds. Take four pills.\n\nFor sudden vomiting and retching:\nMoxibustion at one *cun* below the nipple, seven cones, will cure.\nAlternatively, moxibustion at the first crease behind the inner edge of the thumbnail on both thumbs, one cone each.\nOr, moxibustion at one *cun* below the nail of the middle finger on both hands, one cone each, will cure.\n\nThese conditions, though listed under miscellaneous treatments, also fall under the category of phlegm obstruction and *huoluan*. They may be treated according to the methods for *huoluan*. Sudden cases are rare and usually arise as complications of other illnesses—such as from unresolved cold damage, post-*huoluan* depletion and dryness, stagnation after consuming tonics for taxation damage, exposure to cold or heat evil, dietary poisoning, or improper medication. Treatment should address the root cause and not rely solely on these methods.\n\n**Additional Remedies:**\n\nFrom *Essential Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold*:\nFor abdominal distension and shortness of breath, grind one *liang* of *caodoukou* (remove skin) into powder. Take half a *qian* with unripe papaya and fresh ginger decoction.\n\nFrom *Doumen’s Prescriptions*:\nFor chronic qi distension and heart oppression in men and women, with inability to eat due to dietary imbalance and cold-heat conflict causing abdominal fullness:\nRoast *houpo* over fire until dry, then repeatedly roast with ginger juice until charred black. Grind into powder and take two *qianbi* with aged rice water, three times daily; highly effective. Also treats regurgitation and stops diarrhea.\n\nFrom *Tested Prescriptions*:\nFor qi-induced yellow swelling throughout the body, wheezing, inability to eat, and heart-chest fullness:\nRoast non-worm-eaten *zaojiao* (remove skin and seeds) with good vinegar until charred, grind into powder. Take one *qianbi* with seven *badou* (remove oil and membrane), mix with light vinegar and well-ground ink to form pills the size of sesame seeds. Take three pills after meals with aged tangerine peel decoction, three times daily. Increase by one pill every other day until purging occurs. For regular use, aids digestion of alcohol and food.\n\nFrom *Master Mei’s Prescriptions*:\nFor abdominal fullness preventing oral medication, wrap roasted fresh ginger in silk and insert into the anus; replace when cool.\n\nFrom *Sagely Benefit Prescriptions*:\nFor lung organ congestion with heat and vexation, steam four *liang* of fresh *baihe* with half a cup of honey until soft. Frequently hold a piece the size of a jujube in the mouth and swallow the saliva.\n\n*Volume One of Ge Xianweng’s Handbook of Emergency Prescriptions Concludes*\n\n**Volume Two of Ge Xianweng’s Handbook of Emergency Prescriptions**\n**Chapter Twelve: Remedies for Sudden Cholera and Other Acute Conditions**\n\nCholera generally arises from dietary causes—consuming raw or cold foods mixed with rich, greasy fare, wine, or raw fish—while exposed to wind, damp, or drafts, wearing thin clothing, sitting in the open, or sleeping uncovered. At the first onset, ensure warmth: spread hot coals beneath the patient’s bedding and reduce heat if excessive. Alternatively, steam quilts or clothing, replacing cold layers with warm ones. Another method is to heat the ground, douse it with hot water, cover with a thin cloth, lay a mat over it, and envelop the patient thickly. One may also fill a jar with scalding water to soak the feet up to the knees, or place a copper vessel of hot water on the abdomen, padding it with clothing and replacing it when cool. A heated iron may likewise be applied to the abdomen.\n\nIf these measures fail to induce recovery, proceed immediately to moxibustion. Follow the prescribed sequence precisely; do not apply moxa haphazardly. Treat only the afflicted area—never preemptively moxa where no illness exists. Though moxibustion may not yield instant relief, it ensures the patient will not die. Do not discontinue treatment merely because improvement is not immediate.\n\nFor cholera, use moxa cones of moderate size, with a modest number of applications. The standard recommends seven cones, though forty or fifty may be applied without harm. Revival often follows the first application.\n\nWhile classical formulas such as *Li Zhong* pills, *Hou Po* (magnolia bark) with fermented soybean decoction, and *Ban Xia* (pinellia) decoctions to unblock the pulse are effective, the ingredients may be difficult to procure. Here, I outline reliable moxibustion techniques and simple, proven remedies—no less effective than costly medicines. Even in cases where death appears imminent, moxibustion may still revive the patient.\n\nOther remedies, such as *Li Zhong* pills and *Si Shun* or *Hou Po* decoctions, should be prepared in advance each autumn for emergency use.\n\n**Moxibustion for Sudden Cholera:**\n- If abdominal pain precedes symptoms, apply fourteen cones to *Tai Cang* (Great Granary), located four *cun* below the heart’s xiphoid process.\n- If watery diarrhea occurs first, apply fourteen cones one *cun* beside the navel—left for men, right for women. In severe cases, increase to thirty or forty cones. This point is *Da Chang Mu* (Large Intestine Alarm Point), particularly suited for purging.\n- If vomiting precedes symptoms, apply fourteen cones two *cun* below the heart. This also treats unremitting diarrhea.\n- For counterflow qi, apply fifty cones to *Ju Que* (Great Gateway), one *cun* below the tip of the xiphoid process.\n- For cold reversal in the extremities, apply seven cones to each *San Yin Jiao* (Three Yin Intersection), located three *cun* above the inner ankle’s prominence. Increase if no improvement.\n- For muscle spasms, apply six or seven cones to the sole’s depression beneath the big toe (*Yong Quan*, Gushing Spring). Alternatively, apply one cone to the midpoint beneath the big toe for miraculous effect, or seven cones to the nail’s edge on the big toe.\n- For spasms entering the abdomen with pain, have four assistants hold the patient’s limbs while applying fourteen cones two *cun* left of the navel. Also moxa the large tendon of the thigh, one *cun* from the groin.\n- For hiccups, apply seven cones to the first crease of the wrist (*Xin Zhu*, Heart Governor), aligned with the middle finger.\n- For unremitting diarrhea, apply seven cones to *Da Du* (Great Metropolis), at the inner side of the big toe’s base joint, on the border of white flesh.\n- For dry heaves, apply seven cones to *Wen Shi* (Interrogator), three *cun* behind the wrist between the tendons. If reversal and vomiting are extreme, moxibustion here restores flow. *The Lesser Compendium* states this revives the dead.\n- For simultaneous vomiting and diarrhea, apply seven cones to the outer edge of each nipple, near the abdomen’s white flesh. Increase to fourteen if needed.\n- If vomiting ceases but diarrhea persists, apply seven cones to the navel’s center, or fourteen to one *cun* below the navel.\n- For vexation and fullness, apply seven cones three *cun* below the xiphoid process (*Wei Guan*, Stomach Duct). Alternatively, place a bowl over the navel and apply fourteen cones atop it.\n- For acute pain around the navel, apply twenty-one cones three *cun* below it (*Guan Yuan*, Pass Gate). Highly effective.\n\n**Secret Moxibustion for Reviving the Dead from Cholera:**\nMeasure the patient’s philtrum with an object, fold it to span from the heart’s *Jiu Wei* (Turtledove Tail) downward, and moxa the measured area—first the center, then the left and right. Next, encircle the spine with an object to align with the heart’s xiphoid process, then apply seven cones one *cun* to either side of the spine. This treats three points each on the abdomen and back.\n\n**Hua Tuo’s Method for Cholera-Induced Death:**\nCall the patient’s soul from the rooftop. If all other treatments fail, lay the patient prone with arms extended. Measure the distance between the elbows with a string, then apply one hundred cones along the string’s path on either side of the spine, one *cun* from the vertebrae.\n\nFor cases unresponsive to other treatments, moxibustion may be applied to the *Zhou Zhui* (Elbow Vertebra). Tested on hundreds of patients, all rose and sat up immediately after moxibustion. Hua Tuo transmitted this technique to his descendants, who kept it secret through generations.\n\nThe above methods are all moxibustion therapies.\n\n**For Cholera with Abdominal Distension, Pain, Restlessness, Fullness, and Shortness of Breath Before Emesis or Purgation:**\n- **Formula 1:** Two *sheng* of salt, boiled with five *sheng* of water to yield two *sheng*; consume in one draught to induce vomiting and achieve cure.\n- **Formula 2:** One to two *sheng* of fresh or dried ginger, chopped, boiled with six *sheng* of water for three boils; consume in one draught. If not cured, repeat. If fresh herbs are unavailable, decoct the dregs again.\n- **Formula 3:** Drink three *sheng* of fine vinegar; the frail or elderly may consume one to two *sheng*.\n- **Formula 4:** Warm one to two *sheng* of wine, add a piece of beeswax the size of a bullet, dissolve, and drink. If no wax, substitute two *fangcunbi* of salt.\n- **Formula 5:** Half a *sheng* of cinnamon powder, mixed with two *sheng* of warm liquid; consume entirely.\n- **Formula 6:** Boil five to six *sheng* of thick bamboo-leaf decoction and apply hot to areas affected by cramps.\n- **Formula 7:** Take a piece of *nan* or camphor wood the size of a palm, shave, boil with three *sheng* of water for three boils, strain, and apply hot.\n- **Formula 8:** Consume three *fangcunbi* of dried ginger powder.\n- **Formula 9:** Two *sheng* of finely chopped knotweed leaves or stems, boiled with five *sheng* of water for three boils; consume in one draught.

Apply the iron longitudinally along the foot, pausing to form a sore. Repeat on both feet; shortly, heat will enter the abdomen, cramps will cease, and recovery will follow. A heated knife or shrimp tail may also be used.\n- Boil vinegar three times and apply with massage; adding a small amount of powder is especially effective. Bind with cotton padding from below the knee to the foot.\n- Burn fourteen gardenia fruits, grind into powder, and consume.\n- Equal parts cinnamon and pinellia, ground into one *fangcunbi* of powder, mixed with one *sheng* of water; consume to cure.\n- Grind raw soybean powder, mix with wine, and consume one *fangcunbi*.\n- Burn centipede fat and apply to the affected area to cure.\n\n**For Cramps Entering the Intestines (as if about to cramp):**\n- Boil one *cun* of white chicken droppings with six *ge* of water for three boils; consume in one draught without the patient’s knowledge.\n- Boil vinegar with clothing wadding, warm the wadding, and wrap the cramping area.\n- Burn three pinches of woven straw rope, consume with wine to cure.\n- Consume soot from the bottom of a cauldron with wine to cure.\n\n**For Cramps in the Abdomen:**\nInvert the patient so the head is downward until the abdomen is level.\n\n**For Cramps in the Arms, Legs, Chest, or Ribs:**\n- Boil one and a half *sheng* of salt with one *dou* of water until scalding hot; soak hands and feet. For cramps in the chest or ribs, wash with the hot liquid.\n- For cramps entering the abdomen, invert the patient so the head is downward until the abdomen is level. In severe cases, if the hands pull the genitals and the genitals retract, death is certain; if not yet retracted, inversion may still save the patient.\n\n**For Unremitting Dysentery with Cramps Entering the Abdomen (Near Death):**\nTear one *liang* of fresh ginger, boil with one and a half *sheng* of wine for three to four boils; consume in one draught to cure.\n\n**For Restlessness and Fullness in the Heart and Abdomen After Cholera-Induced Emesis and Purgation:**\nFourteen gardenia fruits, boiled with three *sheng* of water to yield two *sheng*; add seven *ge* of fermented soybeans, boil to yield one *sheng*, and consume in one draught.

Remove the coins and drink the juice to induce vomiting and expel toxins.\n\nAnother formula:\nTake a piece of lard the size of a bullet, consume warm, three times daily for three days (nine doses total).\n\nAnother formula:\nTake thirty black plums, remove the pits, and boil with one *sheng* of fermented soybeans and three *sheng* of bitter wine to yield one and a half *sheng*; strain and consume in one dose.\n\nFurthermore, as cold damage disorders have several types and people cannot distinguish them, a single remedy may address all: if one initially feels headache, feverish flesh, and a surging pulse, within the first or second day, prepare the Scallion and Fermented Soybean Decoction.\nUse one handful of scallion whites and one *sheng* of fermented soybeans, boil with three *sheng* of water to yield one *sheng*, and consume in one dose to induce sweating. If sweating does not occur, prepare again, adding two *liang* of kudzu root and three *liang* of cimicifuga, with five *sheng* of water; decoct to yield two *sheng* and divide into two doses, which will surely induce sweating. If sweating still does not occur, further add two *liang* of ephedra, then grind two *ge* of rice with scallion decoction, boil with one *sheng* of water for a short time, add salt and fermented soybeans, followed by the scallion whites; decoct over fire to yield three *sheng* and divide into doses to induce sweating.\n\nAnother formula:\nBoil one *sheng* of fermented soybeans with three *sheng* of young boy’s urine to yield one *sheng*; divide into two doses and consume to induce sweating.\n\nAnother formula:\nBoil four *liang* of kudzu root with one *dou* of water to yield three *sheng*, then add one *sheng* of fermented soybeans and decoct to yield one and a half *sheng*; consume in one dose. Pound fresh kudzu to extract the juice and consume one to two *sheng*—this is also excellent.\n\nIf sweating persists without cessation after three or four days, and the chest feels unwell, inducing vomiting is desired: boil three *sheng* of fermented soybeans with seven *sheng* of water to yield two and a half *sheng*; strain, add one *liang* of honey, and boil again for three bubblings. Consume in one dose and rest quietly to induce vomiting. If recovery does not follow, consume again until recovery.\n\nThis esoteric method is transmitted to descendants.\n\nAnother formula:\nFinely chop three *jin* of fresh rehmannia root, boil with one *dou* of water to yield three *sheng*, and divide into three doses. Alternatively, consume the *Hualu Tusan* or *Kushen Longdan San*.\n\nFor cases lasting five or six days or more:\nPrepare a large quantity of green bamboo sap, simmer briefly to reduce slightly, and drink frequently; cover thickly to induce sweating.\n\nAnother formula:\nBoil half a *liang* each of rhubarb, coptis, phellodendron, and gardenia with eight *sheng* of water for six or seven bubblings; add one *sheng* of fermented soybeans and seven stalks of scallion, then boil to yield three *sheng*. Divide and consume—suitable for both elderly and young.\n\nAnother formula:\nBoil two *liang* of flavescent sophora and two *liang* of scutellaria with half a *jin* of fresh rehmannia in eight *sheng* of water to yield one *sheng*; divide into two doses. If vomiting or purging of toxins occurs, recovery follows.\n\nFor cases lasting six or seven days with extreme heat, heart vexation, delirious speech, visions of ghosts, and a desire to rise and flee:\nBoil three *sheng* of dried evodia fruit with two *sheng* of water to yield one *sheng*; strain, and consume at a moderate temperature. Sweating will bring recovery. This formula is highly reliable and must be used—an esoteric method.\n\nAnother formula:\nTake one *sheng* of large earthworms, split and remove the contents, then boil in human urine until done; strain and consume. Alternatively, extract fresh juice or decoct in water—both are effective.\n\nAnother method:\nExtract juice from feces, consuming several *ge* to one or two *sheng*—this is called *Huanglong Tang* (\"Yellow Dragon Decoction\"), with aged feces being best.\n\nAnother formula:\nTake a white dog, split it open from the back to collect its blood—more is better. While still warm, apply it thickly to the chest; remove once cooled. This revives those on the verge of death. If no white dog is available, any pure-colored dog may be used.\n\nAnother formula:\nRemove the black outer layer of paulownia bark, tear it into fine strips, and cut into four-*cun* lengths to form bundles. Boil with five *ge* of wine and one *sheng* of water to yield one *sheng*; strain and consume in one dose. Vomiting or purging of several *sheng* of green-yellow fluid will bring recovery.\n\nAnother formula:\nMix three chicken eggs, a *fangcunbi* of mirabilite, and three *ge* of wine; stir until the mirabilite dissolves completely, then consume.\n\nAnother formula:\nBoil three *liang* of coptis, two *liang* each of phellodendron and scutellaria, and fourteen gardenia fruits in six *sheng* of water to yield two *sheng*; divide into two doses. This treats vexation, vomiting, and insomnia.\n\nFor those on the verge of death from epidemic qi:\nBoil a thousand coins’ worth of coffin wood to make a decoction.\n\nAnother method:\nSteep one *liang* of flavescent sophora (crushed) in two and a half *sheng* of wine—older formulas use wine to decoct flavescent sophora, reducing it to one and a half *sheng*. Strain, adjust to a moderate temperature, and consume entirely. The patient will experience intense cold and vomit toxins resembling molten glue, then recover.\n\nAnother formula:\nBoil one hundred coins in one *dou* of water to yield eight *sheng*; grind a *dangmenzi*-sized piece of musk into powder and administer gradually until finished. This may induce sweating or vomiting.\n\nFor warm toxin with maculae and severe epidemics difficult to cure—*Heigao* (\"Black Paste\"):\nChop half a *jin* of fresh rehmannia, combine with one *sheng* of fine fermented soybeans and two *jin* of lard, and boil for five or six bubblings until reduced by one-third. Strain, then add powdered realgar and musk the size of large soybeans; mix well and consume entirely. Toxins will exit through the skin, bringing recovery.\n\nAnother formula:\nUse a live toad, split its abdomen to remove the intestines, then pound and consume raw. Dried toads from the fifth day of the fifth month, burned to ash, are also effective.\n\n*Heinu Wan* (\"Black Slave Pill\"), as recorded in *Hu Qia* and *Xiaopin*, is also called *Shuijie Wan* (\"Water-Resolving Pill\"). Another version adds one *liang* of charred wheat husks, naming it *Mainu Wan* (\"Wheat Slave Pill\"). The annotations are consistent.\n\nIngredients:\nTwo *liang* each of ephedra and rhubarb, one *liang* each of scutellaria and mirabilite, one *liang* of pot-bottom soot, two *liang* of stove chimney soot, and two *liang* of roof beam dust. Pound the ingredients, mix with honey, and form into pills the size of a bullet. Grind one pill in five *ge* of freshly drawn water and consume in one dose. If thirsty, drink water; soon, a chilling sensation will arise, followed by sweating and resolution. If no effect is observed after the time it takes for the sun to move five *chi*, consume another pill. This treats cases of five or six days with intense chest heat and lockjaw, known as \"ruined illness,\" which is otherwise incurable—use this *Heinu Wan*.\n\nAnother formula:\nBoil four *liang* of indigo plant, two *liang* each of licorice and donkey-hide gelatin, and eight *ge* of fermented soybeans in one *dou* of water. First boil the indigo and licorice to yield three and a half *sheng*; strain, add the fermented soybeans, and boil for three bubblings. Strain again, then add the gelatin and divide into four doses. Consume entirely, then prepare another batch. This is highly effective for cases lasting seven or eight days with unresolved heat after sweating or vomiting, or with intense heat.\n\nAnother formula:\nPound two *liang* of rhubarb, two *liang* of licorice, two *liang* of ephedra, thirty apricot kernels, five *ge* of mirabilite, one *liang* of scutellaria, and twenty stir-fried croton seeds; mix with honey to form pills the size of soybeans. Consume three pills to purge toxins. If purging does not cease, use rice water to stop it. Household members attending the patient may also consume this first to purge, preventing contagion. These pills may be prepared in advance.\n\nFor resolving muscle layer (heat) on the first or second day:\nBoil one *liang* each of ephedra, licorice, cimicifuga, peony, and gypsum, thirty apricot kernels, and three cowrie shells in three *sheng* of water to yield one *sheng*; consume in one dose. Cover to induce sweating, then recovery follows. Consume fermented soybean porridge afterward to replenish deficiency.\n\nAnother formula:\nBoil two *liang* of ephedra, one *liang* each of scutellaria and cinnamon, and three *liang* of fresh ginger in six *sheng* of water to yield two *sheng*; divide into four doses.\n\nAlternatively, consume *Gegen Jieji Tang* (\"Pueraria Muscle-Resolving Decoction\"):\nBoil four *liang* of pueraria root, two *liang* of peony, one *liang* each of ephedra, indigo plant, licorice, scutellaria, gypsum, and cinnamon, and four jujubes in five *sheng* of water to yield two and a half *sheng*. Strain and divide into three doses to induce mild sweating.\n\nFor cases persisting from three to seven or eight days without resolution, *Xiao Chaihu Tang* (\"Minor Bupleurum Decoction\") may be administered:\nBoil eight *liang* of bupleurum, three *liang* each of ginseng, licorice, and scutellaria, eight *liang* of fresh ginger (or three *liang* of dried ginger if unavailable), five *liang* of pinellia (washed in hot water), and twelve jujubes in nine *sheng* of water to yield two and a half *sheng*; divide into three doses. Cover lightly to induce sweating for half a day, and recovery should follow shortly. If improvement is not observed, prepare another dose.\n\nIf heat and excess persist despite sweating, accompanied by fullness, pain, vexation, and delirious speech, *Da Chaihu Tang* (\"Major Bupleurum Decoction\") may be administered:\nBoil half a *jin* of bupleurum, two *liang* of rhubarb, three *liang* of scutellaria, two *liang* of peony, ten pieces of unripe bitter orange, five *liang* of pinellia (washed), five *liang* of fresh ginger, and twelve jujubes in one *dou* of water to yield four *sheng*; divide into four doses. Mild purgation should follow.\n\nThese four formulas are of the utmost urgency. If medicine can be obtained promptly, one need not resort to other measures, and death may be averted. All other minor treatments are merely precautionary or for extreme cases.\n\nIf the illness is mistreated or fails to resolve after ten days or more, it is termed a \"ruined disease,\" and only *Da Xiao Biejia Tang* (\"Major and Minor Turtle Shell Decoctions\") should be administered. As this formula requires many ingredients in small quantities, it is not feasible for emergency use and thus is not recorded here.\n\nIn all cases of cold damage where sweating is induced, avoid excessive fluid loss. A single dose should produce mild sweating; once the sweat clears, cease further administration. If sweating persists, apply powder and avoid drafts.\n\nWhen cold damage first manifests with generalized heaviness, lumbar and back pain, unremitting vexation, a floating pulse, a face flushed with brocade-like macules, sore throat, or diarrhea, or with delirious speech and a desire to flee, this is termed \"yang toxin.\" It is treatable within five days; beyond this, death ensues. The following formula is appropriate:\nBoil one *fen* each of realgar, licorice, cimicifuga, Chinese angelica, Sichuan pepper, and cinnamon in five *sheng* of water to yield two and a half *sheng*; divide into three doses. Cover to induce sweating. If sweating does not occur, prepare another dose.\n\nIf the body feels heavy and the back stiff, with a sensation of being beaten, abdominal pain, epigastric rigidity, shortness of breath, retching, cyanotic lips, a dark complexion, cold limbs, and a pulse that is deep, fine, tight, and rapid, this is termed \"yin toxin.\" It is treatable within five days; beyond this, death ensues. The following formula is appropriate:\nBoil two *fen* each of licorice and cimicifuga, one *fen* each of Chinese angelica and Sichuan pepper, and one *liang* of turtle shell in five *sheng* of water to yield two and a half *sheng*; divide into three doses. Cover to induce sweating. If sweating does not occur, prepare another dose by decocting the ingredients again.\n\nFor yin toxin with cold mouth and nose, grind one *fen* each of dried ginger and cinnamon into powder and consume with three *ge* of warm wine; this should produce intense heat and lead to recovery.\n\nYin and yang toxins do not only appear at the onset but may also develop after one or two days. All such cases should be treated with the aforementioned formulas. Most patients with these conditions succumb to the illness.\n\nFor heat disease that fails to resolve and leads to severe diarrhea with impending death, administer *Da Qing Tang* (\"Major Indigo Decoction\"):\nBoil four *liang* of indigo plant, three *liang* of licorice, two *liang* of donkey-hide gelatin, eight *ge* of fermented soybeans, and three *liang* of red halloysite in one *dou* of water to yield three *sheng*; divide into three doses. If the decoction is exhausted, prepare another. Administer two doses day and night to achieve recovery.\n\nAnother formula:\nBoil one *sheng* of fermented soybeans, fourteen gardenia fruits, and one handful of Chinese leek in five *sheng* of water to yield three and a half *sheng*; divide into three doses.\n\nAnother formula:\nCrush half a *jin* of dragon bone and boil in one *dou* of water to yield five *sheng*. Consume the decoction extremely cold in small sips. If sweating occurs at any point, recovery follows.\n\nAnother formula:\nForm pills the size of parasol seeds with two *liang* each of coptis and Chinese angelica, one *liang* of dried ginger, two *liang* of red halloysite, and honey. Consume twenty pills, three times during the day and twice at night.\n\nAnother formula:\nBoil two *liang* of coptis and a piece of processed mugwort the size of a duck egg in two *dou* of water to yield one *sheng*; consume in one dose to achieve immediate cessation. This formula governs all epidemic dysentery.\n\nFor all epidemic dysentery, boil three *liang* of coptis, two *liang* each of phellodendron, Chinese angelica, and dragon bone in six *sheng* of water to yield two *sheng*. Strain, add seven *ge* of honey, and decoct again to yield one and a half *sheng*; divide into three doses. This is effective.\n\nFor epidemic toxin disease with concurrent heat, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, boil half a *liang* each of cimicifuga, licorice, coptis, Chinese angelica, peony, cinnamon bark, and phellodendron in three *sheng* of water to yield one *sheng*; consumption should yield good results.\n\nFor epidemic disease with severe heat diarrhea after four or five days, boil three *liang* each of coptis and phellodendron, three *liang* of dragon bone, and a piece of mugwort the size of a chicken egg in six *sheng* of water to yield two *sheng*; divide into two doses. Avoid consuming pork and cold water.\n\nFor unremitting pus and blood in the stool, boil one *jin* of red halloysite, one *liang* of dried ginger, and one *sheng* of rice in seven *sheng* of water until the rice is cooked. Strain and consume seven *ge* twice daily.\n\nAnother formula:\nBoil one *jin* of red halloysite and two *liang* of dried ginger in five *sheng* of water to yield three *sheng*; divide into two doses.\n\nFor gripping umbilical pain, add one *liang* of Chinese angelica and two *liang* of peony, and increase the water by one *sheng*.\n\nTo promote bowel movement when the stool is hard and impacted, boil four *liang* of rhubarb, two *liang* of magnolia bark, and four pieces of unripe bitter orange in four *sheng* of water to yield one *sheng* and two *ge*; divide into two doses. Cease administration once the bowels move.\n\nFor constipation lasting over ten days, administer *Chengqi Wan* (\"Qi-Regulating Pill\"):\nGrind two *liang* each of rhubarb and apricot kernels, one *liang* of unripe bitter orange, and one *ge* of mirabilite. Mix with honey to form pills the size of a bullet. Consume with six or seven *ge* of hot water. If the bowels do not move, administer another dose.\n\nFor diarrhea with inability to eat, grind one *sheng* of coptis and twenty roasted and dried mume fruits into powder. Melt a piece of wax the size of a chess piece and one *sheng* of honey over a gentle fire until pliable, then form pills the size of parasol seeds. Consume two pills per dose, three times daily.\n\nFor distension and fullness in the lower abdomen with inability to urinate, the following remedies may be used:\n\nGrind realgar into fine powder, mix with honey, and form into pills the size of a jujube pit. Insert into the urethral opening to a depth of half an inch. Alternatively, use a bamboo tube to inject into the vagina, causing pain and inducing urination to achieve relief.\n\nAnother remedy: Grind three *liang* of talc and one *ge* of *tingli* seeds into powder. Boil in two *sheng* of water until seven *ge* remain, then consume.\n\nAnother remedy: Pound fresh scallions and apply thinly to the lower abdomen, replacing them frequently.\n\nFor fullness and oppression in the chest and rib-sides, heart blockage, qi urgency, and panting, the following remedy may be used:\n\nGrind one *liang* each of ginseng and *bai zhu*, two *liang* of *zhi shi*, and one *liang* of dried ginger. Mix with honey to form pills. Consume one pill per dose.\n\nIf coughing is present, add two *liang* of *gua lou*.\nIf vomiting occurs, add two *liang* of oyster shell.\nTake five or six pills day and night. If not cured, continue administration.\n\nFor toxic disease attacking the throat causing swelling and pain, the following remedies may be used:\n\nSlice *shanglu* and roast until hot. Place on a cloth over the throat and press with a heated cloth. Replace when cool.\n\nAnother remedy: Take a piece of real cinnabar the size of a fingernail, place in the mouth, and lightly chew to release its juice, allowing it to soak the throat. A slight unusual sensation indicates efficacy.\n\nFor toxic disease attacking the eyes afterward, the following remedies may be used:\n\nBoil a wasp’s nest and use the liquid to wash the eyes, six or seven times daily. This is effective.\n\nAnother remedy: Soak a green cloth in cold water and apply to the eyes.\n\nIf a nebula forms, burn fourteen *chi* beans, grind into powder, and blow into the nose using a tube.\n\nFor unremitting vomiting due to cold damage, the following remedies may be used:\n\nBoil one *liang* of licorice, half a *liang* of *shengma*, three *liang* of fresh ginger, and two *liang* of tangerine peel in three *sheng* of water until two *sheng* remain. Consume in one dose to cure.\n\nAnother remedy: Grind six *fen* of dried ginger and four *fen* of aconite into powder. Mix with vinegar to form pills the size of parasol seeds. Take three pills per dose, three times daily.\n\nFor unremitting hiccups due to cold damage, the following remedies may be used:\n\nBoil three *liang* of licorice and one *sheng* of tangerine peel in five *sheng* of water until three *sheng* remain.

Drink gradually.\n\nAnother remedy: Grind six *fen* of dried ginger and four *fen* of aconite into powder. Mix with vinegar to form pills the size of parasol seeds. Take three pills per dose, three times daily.\n\nIn recent years, there has been an epidemic disease causing sores to erupt on the head, face, and body, spreading rapidly like fire sores, all filled with white pus. If ruptured, new sores form immediately. If not treated promptly, severe cases often result in death. Even after recovery, the scars remain purple-black for over a year before fading. This is caused by virulent toxic qi.\n\nIt is said that in the fourth year of Yonghui (653 CE), these sores spread from west to east across the land. Boiling mallow and consuming it with garlic paste was found to halt the condition. Eating it at the onset of symptoms, even with a small amount of rice, is effective.\n\nThis disease was acquired during the Jianwu era (25–56 CE) in Nanyang while fighting the barbarians, hence it was called \"barbarian sores.\" Various physicians collaborated on treatments, and the following effective remedies were developed:\n\nApply high-quality honey to the entire body. Alternatively, decoct *shengma* in honey and consume frequently.\n\nAnother remedy: Boil *shengma* thoroughly in water, soak cotton in the liquid, and wash the sores. Soaking in vinegar is even better, though the pain may be unbearable.\n\nOther treatments follow the methods for cold damage, but one must be vigilant against the toxicity.\n\nUsing *dihuang* black ointment is also effective.\n\nFor epidemic jaundice, the following remedy may be used:\n\nBoil six *liang* of *yinchen*, two *liang* of rhubarb, and twelve gardenia fruits in one *dou* of water. First boil *yinchen* until five *sheng* remain, strain, then add the other ingredients and boil until three *sheng* remain. Divide into four doses. Other treatments for jaundice may also be combined for efficacy.\n\nIn recent years, there has also been a \"barbarian jaundice\" disease. Initially, one feels heaviness and discomfort in the limbs. Soon after, yellowing appears in the eyes, gradually spreading to the face and eventually the entire body. Immediately test the urine with white paper; if the paper turns yellow like turmeric dye, the heat toxin has entered internally, and urgent treatment is required.\n\nAt the first sign, prepare *guadi* and red bean powder and blow it into the nose. If several *sheng* of yellow fluid discharge from the nose, recovery is likely.\n\nIf the condition has progressed deeply, inspect the underside of the tongue for two prominent white veins. Use a reed knife to incise them, allowing several *sheng* of purple blood to drain, which will provide relief. However, this must be performed by someone experienced in the procedure. Inexperienced incisions may damage the blue veins under the tongue, causing unstoppable bleeding and death.\n\nAlternatively, heat an iron spindle until red-hot and cauterize the veins to scorch them. Combine *guadi* and *badou* into pills and consume to induce discharge of yellow fluid through the stool and urine. After cauterization, avoid all杂食.\n\nIt is also said that one may sit on yellow earth to alleviate jaundice, but this must be distinguished from other conditions.\n\nRemedies include:\n\nBoil bamboo and drink the liquid like tea.\n\nAnother remedy: Pound fresh *gua* roots, extract the juice, and drink one to two or three *sheng*.\n\nAnother remedy: Soak chicken eggs in vinegar overnight and swallow the whites of several eggs.\n\nAnother remedy: Cut five *sheng* of bamboo leaves, seven *sheng* of wheat, and three *liang* of gypsum. Grind into powder, wrap in cotton, and boil in one *dou* and five *sheng* of water until seven *sheng* remain. Consume one *sheng* per dose until finished for a cure.\n\nAnother remedy: Mix two *sheng* of fresh *ge* root juice, one *sheng* of high-quality *chi*, twenty-one gardenia fruits, and one *sheng* of chopped *yinchen*. Boil in five *sheng* of water until three *sheng* remain, strain, add the *ge* juice, and divide into five doses.\n\nAnother remedy: Prepare a golden-footed hen as one would for eating. Consume the meat and broth thoroughly, adding a small amount of salted *chi* for flavor. If not cured, repeat the treatment.\n\nFor toxic attack causing swelling and pain in the hands and feet, as if about to sever, the following remedies may be used:\n\nChop *huzhang* root, boil, and soak the feet in the liquid at an appropriate temperature, stopping when the water reaches just above the ankles.\n\nAnother remedy: Soak the feet in rice-straw ash liquid.\n\nAnother remedy: Boil *kushen* in wine and soak the feet until cured.\n\nAnother remedy: Pound one *sheng* each of salted *chi* and sheep urine until well-mixed, then soak the affected area.\n\nAnother remedy: Finely chop five *jin* of *huangbo*, boil in three *dou* of water, and soak the affected area. This also treats swelling and pain in the private parts.\n\nAnother remedy: Dig a pit three *chi* deep, just large enough to hold both feet. Heat the pit thoroughly, then pour wine into it. Step into the pit wearing clogs, ensuring the steam is contained and does not escape.\n\nAnother remedy: Boil *yangtao* juice and soak the affected area; adding a small amount of salted *chi* is especially effective.\n\nAnother remedy: Boil horse dung or sheep dung in water and soak the affected area.\n\nAnother remedy: Mix sheep dung with lard and apply to the swelling; this is also effective.\n\nAnother remedy: Wrap the swollen area with beef, and the swelling will subside and pain cease.\n\nAnother remedy: Pound *changsicao*, extract the juice, and soak the feet in it.\n\nAnother remedy: Boil one pig’s trotter with scallions, remove the dregs, add a small amount of salt, and soak the affected area.\n\nFor toxic disease causing sores in the lower body, burn a *guan* vessel and insert the ashes deeply as a suppository; no more than three applications are needed.\n\nAnother remedy: Apply raw lacquer and insert it with cotton.\n\nAnother remedy: Form large moxa cones and apply moxibustion to the lower body—this is a last resort when no other medicine is available.\n\nAnother remedy: Take three *sheng* of earthworms, boil in five *sheng* of water until two and a half *sheng* remain, and consume the entire decoction.\n\nAnother remedy: Boil peach bark until it reduces to a syrup-like consistency, then combine with cotton for insertion.\n\nAnother remedy: Pound water *xingcai*, wrap in cotton, and insert; replace five times daily until cured.\n\nAnother remedy: Boil *ju* bark and *hu* bark together until the liquid thickens like malt sugar, then use for insertion.\n\nAnother: A thick decoction of boiled peach bark, taken as a drink, is most effective.\n\nAnother remedy: Pound *shemei* to extract the juice, take three *ge* three times daily. Soak black plums in water until concentrated, then add honey from cliff bees, and drink frequently.\n\nIf the patient’s teeth lose their color, the tongue turns white, or they become excessively drowsy, confused, and insensitive to pain, or if they suffer from diarrhea, urgently treat the lower body. Those who do not recognize this will only address the upper body, neglecting the lower, allowing worms to grow in the lower body. These worms will consume the anus, and when the anus rots to reveal the five viscera, death follows.\n\nRemedy: Take egg white, mix with lacquer, return it to the eggshell, and swallow it while facing upward. This will induce vomiting of the worms, leading to recovery.\n\nAnother remedy: Burn horse hooves to ash, grind finely, mix with lard, and apply to cotton for insertion into the lower body several times daily until cured.\n\nAnother remedy: Boil fifteen peach kernels, two *sheng* of bitter wine, and one *ge* of salt until six *ge* remain, then consume.\n\nAnother remedy: Burn mugwort in a tube to fumigate the lower body, allowing the smoke to enter. Mix a small amount of realgar into the mugwort—this method is used for *xiwen* (stream warmth), hence the inclusion of its treatment.\n\nFor incessant diarrhea from an unknown cause: Two *liang* of *wutou*, one *liang* each of *nüwei* and *yunshi*, and two *fen* of *gui*. Form into honey pills the size of *tongzi* seeds, and take five pills with water three times daily.\n\nFor sudden pain in the lower body resembling a bird’s pecking: Pound one *sheng* each of red adzuki beans and large beans, place in two pouches, steam until hot, and alternate sitting on them to cure. This was originally recorded in the miscellaneous treatments section and is also caused by toxic *qi* from cold damage.\n\nThus, while there are many remedies for cold damage—including those using *mahuang*, *gegen*, *guizhi*, *chaihu*, *qinglong*, *baihu*, *sishun*, and *sini*, totaling over twenty essential formulas—the ingredients are difficult to fully prepare. Moreover, diagnosis must be precise, and other comprehensive formulas are recorded elsewhere. Here, only the four most urgently needed formulas are included. The *huanggao* and *chisang* remedies are found in the disease-prevention section and should be prepared in advance; take them at the first sign of illness.\n\nCold damage (*shanghan*), seasonal epidemics (*shixing*), and warm epidemics (*wenyi*) are three names for the same category of illness, though their origins differ slightly. When one is harmed by cold in winter, or when sweating from strenuous activity exposes one to wind and cold, the illness manifests in summer—this is called *shanghan*. When winter is not very cold, and warm air or westerly winds cause the joints to relax and become susceptible, the illness manifests in spring—this is called *shixing*. When pestilential *qi* and demonic toxins afflict a person in a given year, it is called *wenbing*. Though the diagnostic signs are similar, and refined discourse prefers the general term *shanghan*, common people call it *shixing*. Daoist talismans and inscriptions also distinguish the *five warm* diseases, but ultimately, they share the same path. However, there are differences such as *yangming*, *shaoyang*, *yin* toxin, and *yang* toxin. Cases of *shaoyin* disease that do not involve fever but present with abdominal fullness and diarrhea are the most difficult to treat.\n\n**Attached Formula**\nFrom *The Infallible Remedies*: For seasonal epidemic illness of one or two days’ duration: Take one large *liang* of *mahuang* (remove the nodes), boil in four *sheng* of water, skim off the foam, and reduce to two *sheng*. Remove the dregs, add a spoonful of rice and *chi* to make a thin porridge, and consume one *sheng* while strong. First, prepare hot water and pour over one hundred bowls’ worth over the head, then consume the porridge. Cover thickly to induce sweating; doing this at night is most effective.\n\n**Formulas from *Master Mei’s Remedies***\nFor unresolved *cold damage* with sweating persisting three or four days, accompanied by chest oppression and vomiting: Take one *sheng* of *chi*, one *ge* of salt, and four *sheng* of water; decoct to one and a half *sheng*, divide and consume—this will induce vomiting.\n\n**Formulas from *Sagely Benevolence Remedies***\nFor *cold damage* of four days’ duration with persistent vomiting, further vomiting is advisable: Take *kushen* powder, administer two *qian* with wine—recovery follows vomiting.\n\nAnother formula for seasonal epidemic *heat toxin* with vexation and restlessness of the heart-spirit: Use half a large spoonful of *lan dian*, mix with one cup of freshly drawn water, and consume.\n\nAnother formula for seasonal epidemic with unremitting headache: Take three *liang* of *poxiao*, grind to a powder, mix with raw oil, and apply to the crown of the head.\n\nAnother formula for seasonal epidemic with vexing thirst: Take one medium cup of fresh lotus root juice, blend with one *ge* of raw honey, divide into two doses, and consume.\n\n**Formulas from *Victorious Golden Remedies***\nFor seasonal epidemic *heat disease* with delirious speech and heart vexation: Take *kushen* in any quantity, stir-fry until yellow, and grind to powder. For each dose, take two *qian*, decoct in one cup of water to eight parts, and consume warm. Repeat for three doses—recovery follows whether sweating occurs or not.\n\n**Formulas from *Extensive Relief Remedies***\nFor *cold damage* of both *yin* and *yang* toxins, *Black Dragon Elixir*: Take one *liang* of imported *liuhuang*, pound with a willow mallet for three days; take one *liang* of *badou* (count the shells), and two *sheng* of a wok. First place the *liuhuang* to cover the wok’s base, then add the *badou*, and cover with more *liuhuang*. Pour in half a *sheng* of strong vinegar, seal tightly with a lid, and further seal the edges with wet paper to prevent steam escape. When the paper dries, remoisten with vinegar. Heat with a gentle flame, keeping watch; when half the *badou* inside crackles, immediately remove the wok from the fire, transfer to a mortar, and pound finely. Add a small amount of rice vinegar and steamed cake, pound again until cool enough to form pills the size of a *chicken’s head*.\n\nFor *yin* toxin, decoct forty-nine *jiaomu* grains and two stalks of *cong bai* in one cup of water to six parts, and swallow one pill without chewing.\n\nFor *yang* toxin, decoct forty-nine *chi* grains and two stalks of *cong bai* in one cup of water, and swallow one pill without chewing.\n\n**Formulas from *Sun Yonghe’s Remedies***\nFor *yang* toxin entering the stomach with frequent bloody stool and unbearable pain: Take five large *yujin* roots and one *zaojiazi*-sized *niuhuang*, grind separately, then combine as a powder. For each dose, decoct in one cup of vinegar *jiang* water to three boils, and consume warm.\n\n**Formulas from *Sun Zhao’s Oral Instructions***\nFor *yin* toxin *cold damage* with reversal cold of the limbs, deep and faint pulse, headache, and lumbar heaviness, also treating *yin* toxin, *ke ni* (hiccup-reversal), and similar conditions: Take equal parts *chuan wutou* and *ganjiang*, grind coarsely, stir-fry until discolored, cool, then grind finely. For each *qian*, decoct in one cup of water with a pinch of salt to half a cup, and consume warm.\n\nAnother formula for *yin* excess obstructing *yang* in *cold damage*, where the patient is vexingly hot yet unwilling to drink water: *Thunderbolt Powder* is appropriate. Take one *fuzi*, burn to ash while preserving its nature, grind to powder, and administer with honey water in a single dose—this dispels cold *qi*, allowing *heat qi* to ascend and induce sweating for recovery.\n\n**Formulas from *Sagely Benevolence Remedies***\nFor *yin* toxin *cold damage* with reversal cold of the limbs, moxibustion is advisable: Take one *sheng* of *wuzhuyu*, mix evenly with wine, fill two silk pouches, steam until extremely hot, and apply to the soles of the feet. Discontinue once *qi* flows smoothly and warmth is evenly restored—this method has been repeatedly verified.\n\n**Tang Dynasty: Cui Yuanliang’s Remedy**\nFor seasonal epidemic with jaundice, frenzied heart vexation, and delirium: Take one large yellow *gualou*, soak in nine *ge* of freshly drawn water; strain the juice, add half a large *ge* of honey and eight *fen* of *poxiao*, stir until dissolved, and divide into two doses—recovery follows.\n\n**Formulas from *Arcane Essentials from the Imperial Library***\nFor seasonal epidemic of four or five days’ duration with *jiexiong* (chest bind), fullness, pain, and high fever: Take one *liang* of *kushen*, slice, decoct in two *sheng* of vinegar to one *sheng* and two *ge*, and consume entirely—recovery follows vomiting. For seasonal epidemic *toxin disease*, only *kushen* and vinegar remedies resolve it, and warming to induce sweating brings recovery.\n\nAnother formula for urgent relief of post-epidemic *ou ni* (vomiting-reversal) with inability to retain food: Prepare sheep’s liver as for eating, consume raw and plain—three doses suffice to stop it.\n\nAnother formula: Take one chicken egg, boil for three to five boils, remove and soak in water until the exterior is cooked but the interior remains warm, then swallow—effective.\n\n**Formulas from *Sagely Benevolence Remedies***\nFor seasonal epidemic with *ou ni* (vomiting-reversal) and inability to retain food: Take half a *liang* of *banxia*, soak and wash seven times in hot water to remove sliminess, and one *liang* of fresh ginger; chop together, decoct in one large cup of water to six parts, remove dregs, divide into two doses, and consume warm at any time.\n\n**Formulas from *Master Shen’s Remedies***\nFor incessant *wa* (belching) in *cold damage*: Wash *banxia* thoroughly, dry, grind to powder, and take one *qianbi* with fresh ginger decoction.\n\n**Formulas from *Essential Relief for the Multitudes***\nFor unremitting cough and hiccup in *cold damage*, and persistent *yue ni* (hiccup-reversal): Take one *liang* of *xiang* and one *liang* of dried *shi di*, bake dry, grind to powder, and take one *qian* with ginseng decoction at any time.\n\n**Formulas from *Arcane Essentials from the Imperial Library***\nFor seasonal epidemic *toxin disease* with nosebleed due to *heat toxin*, where blood descends in several *sheng*: Grind fine *mo* (ink), form pills with egg white the size of *wutong* seeds, and take ten to twenty pills with fresh *dihuang* juice. Repeat after the time it takes to walk five *li*.\n\nAnother remedy for *cold damage* of eight or nine to over ten days’ duration with severe vexing thirst, overwhelming heat, and sores in the *sanjiao*, often with diarrhea, gaping mouth, protruding tongue, panting, eye erosion, oral and nasal sores, delirious speech, and loss of recognition: [Formula for] eliminating *heat toxin* and stopping dysentery.\n\nDragon bone, half a *jin*, crush and boil in one *dou* of water to yield four *sheng*; submerge in a well to chill. Take five *ge* at a time, gradually increasing the dose, and drink freely—especially suitable for the elderly and children.\n\n**Master Mei’s Formulas**: For unremitting dysentery with pus and blood following *heat disease*, with inability to eat: Take white dragon bone powder, one *fangcunbi* mixed with rice broth.\n\n**Dietary Therapy**: For *heat toxin* with bloody stool in *cold damage*: Grind antelope horn to powder and ingest to resolve.\n\nAnother remedy for *mounting qi*.\n\n**Imperial Grace Formulas**: For *cold damage* with *fox delusion*, where *toxin* erodes the lower body and the anus becomes like [ ], with unceasing pain and itching: Take half a *liang* of realgar, place in a wide-mouthed jar filled with ash (as for incense burning), ignite the realgar, and when smoke arises, fumigate the afflicted area.\n\nAnother formula for *cold damage* with [ ] sores in the lower body: Stir-fry three *liang* of mume flesh until dry, pound to powder, and form pills with refined honey the size of *wutong* seeds.

Take one pill with a *zicao* decoction; soon the heart and spirit will settle, sleep will come, and sores will erupt normally—thereafter, rest and convalesce to recover.\n\n**Drug Properties Treatise** states: *Huzhang* treats great heat with vexation and agitation, stops thirst, disinhibits urination, and suppresses all *heat toxin*. In summer, decoct with licorice—its color becomes amber-like and lovely, fit for storage. When tasted, it is sweet and fine. Place the decoction in a jar, chill in a well until it becomes as cold as water, and store in white porcelain or silver vessels. Sip it like tea; contemporaries call it *cold drink* and hold it in higher esteem than tea. It can break menstrual block in women—pound, steep in wine, and take regularly. Pregnant women must not take it, as it breaks the blood.\n\n**Formulas for Seasonal Epidemic Relapse and Overstrain (Chapter Fourteen)**\nFor all *toxin diseases* after recovery, within one hundred days, prohibit pork, dog, and mutton, as they harm the blood; also avoid fatty fish, long-stored grease, and dried fish, as they will invariably cause severe dysentery—once diarrhea begins, it cannot be saved. Further prohibit wheat-based foods, garlic, leeks, scallions, raw vegetables, and shrimp [ ], as consuming these often leads to relapse, making treatment difficult and causing repeated outbreaks in subsequent years.\n\n**Formulas for Overstrain After Severe Illness, Early Exertion, or Excessive Eating and Drinking Leading to Mortal Danger**\nBurn tortoise plastron and take one *fangcunbi*.\n\nAnother formula: Take a small amount of *hufen* with water.\n\nAnother formula: Mix three *sheng* of powder with warm water and ingest; cover thickly to induce sweating.\n\nAnother formula: Boil one handful of dried perilla in five *sheng* of water to yield two *sheng*, and consume entirely. If no dried perilla is available, fresh may be used, adding four *liang* of fresh ginger and one *sheng* of fermented soybeans.\n\nAnother formula: Take fourteen double-pointed rat droppings, half a *sheng* of fermented soybeans, and boil in three *sheng* of water until half remains; consume at once. Cover warmly to induce sweating to resolve. Adding one *sheng* of hemp seeds and one *sheng* of water enhances the effect. May also add *zhishi* and a handful of scallion whites.\n\nAnother formula: Crush and roast chicken eggshells until yellow-black, grind to fine powder, and take one *ge* with hot water; cover warmly to induce sweating.\n\nAnother formula: Boil two *liang* each of *dahuang* and *mahuang*, fourteen *zhizi* kernels, and one *sheng* of fermented soybeans in five *sheng* of water to yield three *sheng*; divide and take twice to induce slight sweating and diarrhea.\n\nAnother formula: Thickly decoct *ganpi* and ingest—*lugen* is also excellent.\n\nFor relapse due to excessive exertion: Burn cooked rice, sift to powder, and take one *fangcunbi* for effect.\n\n**Formulas for Relapse from Sexual Intercourse, with Swollen Testicles or Retraction into the Abdomen, Abdominal Colic, or Urinary Block**\nBurn a woman’s menstrual cloth and take one *fangcunbi*.\n\nAnother formula: Take one [ ] egg, strike it thirty-six times, place at the door, and have the patient run until panting; then pierce below the ribs to draw one *sheng* of blood, mix with one *sheng* of wine, and drink. If no [ ] is available, take the blood alone, but avoid cold immediately afterward. Use *jia* [ ].\n\nAnother formula: Cover the man with the clothing of the woman with whom he had intercourse for the time it takes to eat a meal to revive.\n\nAnother formula: Take the shinbone and blood of *jia* [ ], mix with wine, and drink to resolve.\n\nAnother formula: Scrape two *sheng* of green bamboo shavings, boil in three *sheng* of water until it bubbles five or six times, then strain and discard the dregs. Take the bamboo shaving decoction warm. This formula also broadly treats *overstrain relapse*.\n\nAnother formula: Grind one *fen* of *fanshi* and three *fen* of *xiaoshi* to powder, mix with barley porridge water, and take one *fangcunbi* at a time—*heat toxin* will exit with urine and stool.\n\nAnother formula: Take a large handful of knotweed seeds, crush in water to extract juice, and drink one *sheng*. If dried, thickly extract the juice and ingest. Pound scallion bulbs, mix with bitter wine, and take—also excellent.\n\nAnother formula: Extract juice from several *sheng* of earthworms and ingest for effect.\n\nIf a recovered man has intercourse with a sick woman, or a recovered woman with a sick man, the healthy partner contracts *yin exchange*, while the sick partner relapses—those who relapse will surely die.\n\nFor sudden *yin exchange* disease, whether in men or women with *warm disease*, even if recovered for several decades, if blood vessels remain unharmonized and *heat toxin* lingers, intercourse will transmit the disease, called *yin exchange*, which kills more swiftly than seasonal epidemics—treat urgently.\n\nThe patient experiences bodily heaviness, acute heat in the lower abdomen, swelling ascending to the chest, inability to lift the head due to its weight, the growth of *membranous obstructions* in the eyes, and cramping of the knees and shins so severe as to approach death. The following formula may be used:\n\nTake a woman’s undergarment that has touched her private parts, cut a portion, burn it to ash, and ingest one *square-inch spoonful* three times daily. If urination becomes smooth and the genitals show slight swelling, recovery is imminent. A young girl’s undergarment is also effective. If the patient is female, a man’s undergarment may be used instead.\n\nAnother formula: Take fourteen *mouse droppings* (pointed at both ends), one handful of indigo, and five *sheng* of water. Boil to reduce to two *sheng* and ingest the entire decoction, then cover warmly to induce sweating.\n\nAnother formula: Take twenty-four earthworms and one *dou* of water. Boil to reduce to three *sheng* and ingest in one dose, then induce sweating—this is also effective.\n\nAnother formula: Grind four *liang* of dried ginger into powder, mix with hot water, and ingest at once. Cover warmly to induce sweating, and cease once relief is obtained.\n\nAnother formula: At the first sign of illness in a man, immediately apply moxibustion to the genitals—thirty-seven cones. If the condition persists, increase to one hundred cones, and recovery will follow. The eyes will remain unharmed, and genital sores will return to normal.\n\nWhen two men or two women engage in intercourse, they do not transmit *yin exchange* to one another; thus, the term *exchange* refers to the interchange of yin and yang.\n\nTo prevent relapse in a convalescent patient, take twenty fingernail clippings from a woman’s hands and feet, along with a one-*chi* length of the lower hem of her undergarment. Burn to ash and ingest with wine or rice broth.\n\nAfter recovering from a severe illness, even slight exertion may cause nosebleeds. Grind ten parts oyster shell and five parts gypsum into powder and ingest one *square-inch spoonful* with wine three or four times daily. Alternatively, form into honeyed pills the size of *wutong* seeds and ingest accordingly.\n\nAfter recovering from a severe illness, excessive sweating—including from the eyes—may occur. Use equal parts eucommia bark and oyster shell, ground into powder. Ingest five *spoonfuls* with water before bedtime; if sweating persists, repeat the dose.\n\nAnother formula: Grind two *liang* each of licorice and gypsum into powder. Ingest one *square-inch spoonful* with fermented rice water twice daily to resolve the condition.\n\nAnother formula: Grind dragon bone, oyster shell, and ephedra root into powder, mix with talcum, and dust the body—this is highly effective.\n\nFor post-recovery restlessness, insomnia, eye pain, and vexation:\nTake seven *ge* of fermented soybeans and fourteen black plums. Boil the plums in four *sheng* of water until reduced to two and a half *sheng*, then add the soybeans and boil to one and a half *sheng*. Divide into two doses. If black plums are unavailable, use fourteen gardenia fruits instead.\n\nAnother formula: Boil four *liang* of coptis, two *liang* of peony, one *liang* of scutellaria, and three small sticks of donkey-hide gelatin in six *sheng* of water until reduced to three *sheng*. Divide into three doses. Two egg yolks may also be added.\n\nAnother formula: Take one *dan* of flowing water from a thousand-*li* source, agitate it ten thousand times, then take two and a half *dou*. Wash two *liang* of pinellia, add one *dou* of glutinous rice and four *liang* of poria, and boil to five *sheng*. Divide into five doses.\n\n**Supplementary Formula (from *Master Mei’s Prescriptions*)**:\nFor post-recovery relapse triggered by intercourse, causing extreme debility, inability to open the eyes, or speechlessness:\nBoil thirty gardenia fruits in three *sheng* of water until reduced to one *sheng* and ingest.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: Formulas for Miasma, Epidemics, Warm Toxins, and Pestilence**\n\n**Dried Powder to Ward Off Epidemics**:\nTake one *liang* each of hemp seeds, cypress seeds, dried ginger, and asarum, along with half a *liang* of prepared aconite.

Take three *sheng* of *langdang* seeds, grind into powder, steep in one *sheng* of wine for several days, remove, pound, mix with the original liquid, strain, and simmer over hot water until it can be formed into pills. Take three pills the size of small beans three times daily.

Gently question it, then untie the hands.\n\nGenerally, when mania erupts, the patient may run wildly or claim exalted status, calling themselves divine or sacred. In all such cases, apply moxibustion extensively to achieve lasting recovery. If the patient instead weeps, moans, or sighs, this indicates demonic possession rather than mania, and should be treated according to methods for demonic afflictions.\n\n*The Effective Remedies of Recent Times* states: Burn paper used in silkworm rearing to ash, and take with wine or water to cure wind-induced mania.\n\n**Additional Remedies**\n*From the *Doumen Prescriptions*:* To treat epilepsy, apply moxibustion to the perineum at the midpoint between the anus and scrotum, one cone per year of age.\n\n*From the *Thousand Gold Prescriptions*:* For wind-induced epilepsy and all manner of illnesses, boil four *sheng* of hemp seeds in six *sheng* of water over high heat until the seeds split.

For children, administer one *zi*. Grind *gua di* (melon stalk) to a fine powder without limit. Adults take one *zi*; those under fifteen or the elderly and weak take half. Administer in the morning with well-flower water, and have the patient hold a piece of rock sugar in their mouth. After a while, saliva will flow like water. In chronic cases, once all saliva is expelled, a piece resembling a saliva cloth will float on the water like a mirror. When the saliva is fully drained, consume congee for a day or two. If vomiting becomes excessive and the patient weakens, drink a cup of musk decoction to stop it. Finely chop musk and take with warm water.\n\nFormerly, the Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices suffered from dizziness and took this remedy, expelling saliva with success.\n\n*The Miscellaneous Records of Emperor Ming* states: During the Kaiyuan era, a renowned physician named Ji Peng could diagnose illness by observing a patient’s complexion and speech, without needing to take their pulse. The emperor, having heard of him, summoned him to the palace to examine a concubine who, every afternoon, would laugh, sing, weep, and scream as if mad, yet could not stand. Ji Peng observed her and said: “This must have resulted from overeating followed by sudden exertion, causing her to collapse.” He administered a cloud-mother decoction, had her sleep deeply, and upon waking, her suffering was gone. When asked, she recounted: “During the grand celebration for Princess Taihua’s birth, the palace hosted a grand musical performance. I was the lead singer and, fearing my voice would not be clear and sustained, ate a full bowl of pig’s trotter stew before performing. After singing a long piece, I felt intense heat in my chest. While playing on the terrace, I fell from a height. It was a long while before I regained consciousness, and since then, I have suffered from madness and been unable to stand.”\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: Remedies for Sudden Fright, Demonic Possession, and Confusion**\n\nFor palpitations due to heart deficiency: Grind equal parts *ma huang* (ephedra) and *ban xia* (pinellia), form into honey pills, and take three pills the size of soybeans, twice daily, gradually increasing the dose.

During treatment, eat lightly and avoid rich foods. Three doses will bring recovery.\n\nAnother remedy: Prepare a white rooster as for eating, cut four *liang* of *zhen zhu* (pearl) and four *liang* of *xie bai* (Chinese garlic chives), and boil in three *sheng* of water until reduced to two *sheng*.

Stir with a tiger’s claw until the size of a bullet, then burn in a fire basket at night. Have the woman sit over it, covering herself tightly with a blanket, leaving only her head exposed. If not cured after one attempt, repeat up to three times, after which the demon will sever ties on its own.\n\nAnother remedy: Grind one *liang* each of *xiong huang*, *ren shen* (ginseng), and *fang feng* (saposhnikovia) with one *sheng* of *wu wei zi* (schisandra). Sift and take one *fangcunbi* with well water at dawn. Three doses will bring recovery.\n\nThe master would insert five needles into the topknot of the patient’s hair. For those with manic illness, a vessel of water was prepared, covered with three layers of new red cloth, and a large knife laid horizontally atop it. Assuming a solemn demeanor, the master would call the patient forth. The afflicted would invariably attempt to rise and flee, but the master would not permit it. Instead, he would take a mouthful of water and spray it upon the patient, then exhale sharply while gazing intently—repeating this three times until the patient was thoroughly drenched. Wiping away the water, he would flick the patient’s forehead near the hairline with his finger and ask, “Do you wish to be cured?” The patient would refuse to answer, so the master would repeat the flicking twice seven times before receiving a response. Then, using a staff-like needle, he would pierce the area beneath the nose, beside the philtrum near the nostrils, leaving the needle in place. He would next insert needles into the hollows before both ear roots, again leaving them in place. Finally, he would measure one *cun* upward from the bridge of the nose into the hairline and insert a needle horizontally, then pierce straight upward from the nose into the same point. Only after these procedures would he thoroughly question the patient. Once the patient awoke in clarity and remorse, the treatment would cease.\n\nFor men or women who frequently dream of intercourse with spirits, leading to confusion and disorientation: Saw deer antler into fine shavings and take three pinches with wine, three times daily.\n\n**Attached Remedies**\nZhang Zhongjing’s remedy for palpitations below the heart: *Ban xia* and *ma huang* pills.

Drink one cup on an empty stomach, three or four times day and night, ensuring the wine’s influence remains continuous. Adjust dosage as needed. For those who do not drink wine, take ten *liang* of *sha cao* root, five *liang* of *gui xin*, and three *liang* of *wu yu*, grind into powder, and form into honey pills with one thousand pestle strikes, each the size of a *wu* seed.

Additionally, moxibustion at the seam beneath the scrotum, thirty cones.\n\nOther remedies for manic possession appear elsewhere.\n\nFor those who become manic: Take axle grease the size of a chicken egg, heat it in bitter wine, and stir until dissolved. Consume the entire mixture.\n\nFor heart vexation, confusion, abdominal fullness and pain, or intermittent loss of consciousness: Take five *sheng* of soot from beneath a cauldron, grind and sift, then mix with eight *sheng* of cold water.

Have the patient hold warm water in the mouth; for left-side pain, inhale one *zi* through the left nostril; for right-side pain, inhale through the right—effective.\n\nFrom *Collected Verified Formulas*: For one-sided or general headache, grind one *liang* of *gujingcao* (pipewort) into powder, mix with white flour, spread on paper, and apply to the painful area. Replace when dry.\n\nAnother formula for one-sided headache: Use one *xieke* (clam shell) of fresh radish juice. Lie supine and drip into the nostril—left pain, left nostril; right pain, right nostril; both sides, both nostrils—divinely effective.\n\nFrom *Arcane Essentials from the Imperial Library*: For head wind with bran-like white scales.\nCarve a firm *chumu* (paper mulberry) wood pillow and replace every sixty days.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Formulas for Sudden Wind-Induced Aphonia and Inability to Speak**\n\nFor sudden loss of speech: Boil melon seeds in vinegar, wrap the neck for a full day and night—relief.\n\nAnother formula: Boil soybeans, reduce the juice to a syrup, and hold in the mouth. Or simply boil thickly and drink.\n\nAnother formula: Boil *chi* (fermented soybeans) juice and take gradually. Stir half a *sheng* of fine wine into the juice and divide into three doses.\n\nAnother formula: Peel fresh, high-quality *gui* (cassia), grind, and take three pinches under the tongue, swallowing the juice.\n\nAnother formula: Chop *gu* (millet) branches and leaves, boil in wine, strain the foam, and drink as needed.\n\nFor sudden loss of voice with choked sound: Boil five *liang* of *jupi* (tangerine peel) in three *sheng* of water until one *sheng* remains, strain, and take all at once.\n\nAnother formula: Boil *kuzhuye* (bitter bamboo leaves) thickly and take—relief.\n\nAnother formula: Pound *ranghe* (edible canna) root, mix with wine, strain, and drink the juice. (Originally in Miscellaneous Treatments.)\n\nAnother formula: *Tongcao* (rice-paper plant pith), *ganjiang* (dried ginger), *fuzi* (aconite), *fushen* (poria with hostwood), half a *liang* each; *fangfeng* (saposhnikovia), *gui* (cassia), *shigao* (gypsum), two *liang* each; *mahuang* (ephedra), one and a half *liang*; *baizhu* (atractylodes), half a *liang*; *xingren* (apricot kernels), thirty pieces. Grind all into powder, form into honey pills the size of soybeans, and take seven pills per dose, gradually increasing. All these treat wind-stroke. Many other formulas use bamboo sap decoctions, but though this prescription is small, it targets the ailment precisely—if one dose fails, take another.\n\nAnother formula: Needle one *cun* and five *fen* beside the *dachui* point, then needle below and retain the needle.\n\nAnother formula: Grind *fanshi* (alum) and *gui* (cassia) into powder, wrap in cotton like a date, and place under the tongue to induce salivation.\n\nAnother formula: Heat a horse’s bit iron until red, quench in one *sheng* of vinegar, mix with a broken egg, and drink.\n\nFor sudden cold-induced hoarseness: One *liang* of *gancao* (licorice), two *liang* of *gui* (cassia), two *liang* of *wuweizi* (schisandra), thirty *xingren* (apricot kernels), eight *liang* of sliced fresh *jiang* (ginger). Boil in seven *sheng* of water until two *sheng* remain, and take in two doses.\n\nAdditional Formulas\nFrom *Proven Later Formulas*:\nFor wind-stroke with loss of speech: One *liang* of *duhuo* (pubescent angelica), sliced, simmered in two *sheng* of wine until one *sheng* remains; five *ge* of soybeans, stir-fried until crackling. Pour the hot medicinal wine over the beans, cover for a long while, then take three *ge* warm. If the condition persists, take again.\n\nAnother formula for wind-stroke with loss of speech, wheezing in the throat like a saw, and foaming at the mouth:\nTake one *fen* of *lilu* (black false hellebore) and one *tiannanxing* (arisaema rhizome). Remove the outer skin of the *tiannanxing* and hollow out a small pit on the navel side. Fill the pit with one *rongdou* of aged vinegar, then heat all sides over a fire until yellow. Pound together, grind to an extremely fine powder, and form into pills with raw honey the size of red beans. Take three pills each time with warm wine.\n\nFrom *Sagely Benefit Formulas*:\nFor wind-stroke with loud voice but impaired throat:\nTake two *liang* of *ranghe* root (mioga ginger), grind, and press to extract the juice. Mix with one large cup of wine, stir evenly, and take half a cup warm at any time.\n\nFormula Twenty-One: For Wind-Toxin Leg Weakness with Fullness and Upward Qi\nThe disease of *jiaoqi* (leg qi) first arose in Lingnan and gradually spread to Jiangdong. It strikes without warning—sometimes with slight pain or numbness, sometimes with mild swelling in both shins, or sudden weakness upon standing, or numbness in the lower abdomen, or alternating chills and fever—all its signs. If not treated immediately, it ascends into the abdomen, then erupts as qi and kills.\n\nTo treat this, decoctions, wines, massages, and ointments are commonly used. As there are many effective remedies (#37), not just one formula, here I select only those of singular efficacy, supplemented with moxibustion.\n\nTake one *sheng* of fine fermented soybeans, steam three times and sun-dry three times. Soak in three *dou* of good wine for three nights until drinkable, adjusting the quantity to the patient’s capacity. For prevention, administer without waiting for symptoms: boil the fermented soybeans in wine and take. When leg weakness shows slight improvement, further prepare other formulas and apply moxibustion.\n\nNext, the *Du Huo* Wine formula: five *liang* each of *du huo* (pubescent angelica) and raw, sliced *fuzi* (aconite), steeped in one *dou* of wine for three nights. Begin with one *ge* per dose, increasing until mild numbness is felt.\n\nAnother formula: two *jin* of *bai fan shi* (alunite) or *zhongru* (stalactite powder), three *liang* of *fuzi*, and three *sheng* of fermented soybeans, steeped in three *dou* of wine for four to five days. Drink gradually. If qi stagnation is present, add two *sheng* of *suzi* (perilla seed).\n\nAnother formula: grind three *liang* of fine sulfur into powder. Boil five *sheng* of cow’s milk with five *sheng* of water, add the sulfur, and reduce to three *sheng*. Take three *ge* per dose. Alternatively, boil sulfur directly in milk without water. If cow’s milk is unavailable, sheep’s milk may be used.\n\nAnother method: reduce three *sheng* of cow’s milk by half, then take five *ge* with one *liang* of sulfur powder. After ingestion, cover thickly to induce sweating, avoiding drafts. Take another dose midday and one at dusk. If sweating occurs, do not repeat; simply rest and recover. If unresolved, repeat after several days. For long-term use, it may be decocted into pills.\n\nNortherners find this sulfur remedy highly effective for leg disorders, provided the sulfur is of the finest quality. It should be prepared in advance.\n\nIf the shins are swollen such that pressing leaves an imprint, force the patient to drink two to three *sheng* of black calf’s urine to promote urination and gradually reduce swelling. Use a copper vessel, and fresh urine is best. If no black calf is available, a pure yellow one may suffice.\n\nAnother formula: grind *qianniuzi* (morning glory seeds), mix with honey into pills the size of small beans, and take five pills to promote urination. They may also be swallowed whole. The seeds are black, resembling *qiouzi* kernels, and are sold in markets.\n\nAnother formula: crush *sanbai* root and take with wine.\n\nAnother: boil black soybeans in water or wine and drink the broth.\n\nAnother: eating small red beans is also beneficial.\n\nAnother: grind raw *huma* (sesame), mix with wine, and take to cure the condition.\n\nAnother: boil three *sheng* of black soybeans in one *dou* of water to nine *sheng*, add nine *sheng* of clear wine, and reduce again to nine *sheng*. Drink gradually; urination will relieve the swelling.\n\nFormulas such as *Feng Yin*, *Bai Ji*, *Zhu Li*, and *Du Huo* decoctions, as well as *Ba Feng*, *Shi Hu*, and *Gou Ji* powders, are detailed in comprehensive medical texts.\n\n*Jin Ya* Wine is most essential for treatment; its formula is recorded here: four *liang* each of *shujiao* (Sichuan pepper), *yinyu* (skimmia), *jin ya* (golden teeth), *xixin* (asarum), *wang cao* (lithospermum), *gan dihuang* (dried rehmannia), *fangfeng* (saposhnikovia), *fuzi* (aconite), *difu* (kochia), *shuodi* (glossy privet), and *shengma* (cimicifuga); three *liang* of *renshen* (ginseng); one *jin* of *qianghuo* (notopterygium); and five *liang* of *niuxi* (achyranthes). Cut the fourteen ingredients, steep in four *dou* of wine for seven days, and drink two to three *ge* per dose, gradually increasing. It also treats speechlessness and bent legs with excellent results. *Cezi* Wine is also effective.\n\nFor rural or impoverished households, these remedies may be brewed: *baqia* (smilax), pine nodes, and pine needles are all beneficial. Wash and chop one *hu* of *baqia*, boil in three *hu* of water to nine *dou*, strain, and use the liquid to soak yeast and cook rice, brewing as one would wine. When ready, drink freely, preparing three to five *hu* at once. If using pine nodes or needles, follow the same method; the liquid should be as concentrated as possible.\n\nFor those with bent legs, unable to walk for years, or suffering from lumbar and spinal contracture and abdominal tightness, three to five doses will restore health.\n\nIf brewing is impractical, *shanglu* (pokeweed) by the water’s edge is also effective.\n\nMoxibustion points are numerous, but as not all may be known, I record only the essentials. Begin from the upper body; moxibustion on the legs alone risks trapping qi and causing danger.\n\nFirst, moxa *Dazhui*: the prominent vertebra at the nape. Apply moxa to the point above it. If qi stagnation is present, first moxa *Baihui* with fifty cones—this point lies in the depression atop the head.\n\nNext, moxa *Jianjing* on both shoulders with one hundred cones each. The point lies in the depression near the head on the shoulders; press with fingers to locate the center.\n\nNext, moxa *Danzhong* with fifty cones. This point lies between the breasts, at the junction of the sternum and ribs, where pressing elicits a subtle qi sensation. Some say it is the single point at the center of the chest.\n\nNext, moxa *Juque*, located one *cun* below the tip of the xiphoid process, measured by the patient’s finger-width. Moxibustion at these five upper points suffices to treat qi stagnation. Moxibustion at *Baihui*, *Fengfu* (#40), *Weiguan*, and the five *zang* transport points is even better, depending on the urgency of the condition. All points are recorded in moxibustion manuals and cannot be fully listed here.\n\nNext, moxa *Fengshi* with one hundred cones. This point lies on the outer thigh; stand upright, let the hands hang naturally, and press the thigh where the middle finger rests—this is the point, where pressing feels appropriate.\n\nNext, moxa *Zusanli* with two hundred cones. Have the patient place their hand horizontally below the knee, fingers together (a measure called *yifu*). The point lies one *yifu* below the kneecap, at the outer edge of the shinbone, where pressing reveals a depression.\n\nNext, moxa *Shang Lian* with one hundred cones, located one *yifu* below *Zusanli*.\n\nNext, moxa *Xialian* with one hundred cones, located one *yifu* below *Shang Lian*.\n\nNext, moxa *Juegu* with two hundred cones. This point lies slightly more than three *cun* above the outer ankle; align the fingertip with the upper edge of the ankle bone, then bend the finger to measure four *cun*—this is the point. It roughly aligns with *Xialian*, forming two distinct points in the interstice. These eighteen points below are all essential points. For the remaining points—*Futu* and *Dubi*—when applying the prescribed number of cones, it is not necessary to complete them all at once; rather, spread the treatment over three days to fulfill the total.\n\n**Alternative Formula:**\nSteep two *jin* of *Konggongnie* and five *liang* of *shihu* in two *dou* of wine, then consume.\n\n**Appended Formulas:**\n\n*From the* **Doumen Fang***:*\nTo treat sudden wind-toxin, swelling, tightness, and acute pain: Take one *jin* of willow bark, chop it, and boil it in wine until hot. Wrap it in silk and apply it to the swollen area. When it cools, reheat and replace it. This method is highly effective.\n\n*From the* **Shenghui Fang***:*\nTo treat migratory wind-toxin pain: Grind small mustard seeds into powder, mix with egg white, and apply as a poultice.\n\n*From the* **Jingyan Hou Fang***:*\nTo treat wind-toxin bone-marrow pain: Grind two *fen* of *shaoyao* and one *liang* of roasted *hugu* into powder, place in a silk pouch, and steep in three *sheng* of wine for five days. Take two *ge* per dose, three times daily.\n\n*From the* **Shiyi Xinjing***:*\nTo dispel all wind-damp impediment and tetany of the limbs: Grind three *liang* of *cangerzi* into powder, decoct in one and a half *sheng* of water until seven *ge* remain, strain, and sip.\n\nAlso, to treat muscle spasms, chronic wind-damp impediment, downbearing *qi*, expelling pathogenic *qi* from the bones, harmonizing the intestines and stomach, dispersing water swelling, and—with prolonged use—lightening the body and augmenting *qi* and strength: Take one *sheng* of *yiyiren*, grind into powder, and for each dose, boil two *sheng* of water with two spoonfuls of the powder to make a congee. Consume on an empty stomach.\n\nAlso, to supplement deficiency, dispel wind-damp impediment: Warm one cup of wine, mix in two large *liang* of *tihu*, and take one spoonful of the mixture.\n\n*From the* **Jingyan Fang***:*\nTo treat pain beneath the skin anywhere on the body: Grind *heshouwu* into powder, mix with ginger juice to form a paste, apply to the painful area, and wrap with silk. Then, heat the sole of a shoe over fire and press it against the area. This method is highly effective.\n\n*From Sun Zhenren’s Formula:*\nTo treat *jiaoqi* and counterflow *qi*: Prepare *kuai* from one large red crucian carp and consume one or two portions at once for relief.\n\n*From the* **Qianjin Yi***:*\nTo treat *jiaoqi* surging upward to the heart: Boil two *liang* of alum in one *dou* and five *sheng* of water for three to five boilings, then soak and wash the feet. This is highly effective.\n\n*From the* **Guangli Fang***:*\nTo treat *jiaoqi* causing vexation, agitation, and loss of consciousness: Boil one *sheng* of soybeans in three *sheng* of water to make a thick decoction, then consume half a *sheng* at once. If symptoms persist, take another half *sheng* to stabilize the condition.\n\nSu Gong states: For those suffering from *jiaoqi*, eat to satiety in the morning as desired, eat lightly after noon, and fast in the evening. If hungry, consume fermented soybean congee. If digestion is poor and symptoms resemble impending cholera:\nTake two *liang* of *gaoliangjiang*, crush it, and boil in three *sheng* of water until one *sheng* remains. Consume it all at once to resolve the condition. Wait until extremely hungry, then eat a full portion of thin congee. This remedy is most effective when taken in large quantities. If *gaoliangjiang* is unavailable, substitute one *liang* of ginger, boil it thoroughly in one *sheng* of clear wine, and consume it with the dregs. Though not as effective as *gaoliangjiang*, it still yields significant results.\n\nThe *Tang Bencao* notes: For *jiaoqi*, soak the affected area in a thick decoction of *hongcao* for prolonged relief.\n\n*From the* **Jianyao Jizhong***:*\nTo treat *jiaoqi* with persistent leg swelling: Take one *liang* of black *fuzi*, remove the skin and navel, grind into powder, and mix with fresh ginger juice to form a paste. Apply to the swollen area, and when the paste dries, reapply with fresh mixture until the swelling subsides.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Formulas for Acute Onset of *Fu San* Toxicity**\n\nWhen consuming Five Minerals *Huming Gengsheng* or *Zhongru* Cold-Food Powder, improper regulation or dosage may provoke acute onset of illness, manifesting in myriad ways. If symptoms arise suddenly rather than gradually, they are due to the potency of the powder. Immediate intervention is required. For all external pains or abnormalities in the limbs or body, wash the affected area with cold water hundreds of times. If heat surges, soak a cloth in water and apply it as a compress. Alternatively, soak a cold stone in water and use it to press the area. Drink warm wine and walk leisurely.\n\nFor all internal pains or abnormalities in the heart and abdomen—such as vexation, oppression, or confusion—act swiftly. If cold, drink warm wine in one or two *sheng* increments, gradually increasing the amount. If slight relief is felt, consume more cold food. Heart pain is most urgent; if the flesh is cold and the mouth is clenched, force open the teeth and administer hot wine for relief.\n\nFor abdominal masses, heat accumulations, or other complex conditions, purge immediately. Boil fourteen *zhizi* and five *ge* of *chi* in two *sheng* of water until one *sheng* remains, then consume it all at once. If heat is severe and sores have erupted, add two *liang* of *huangqin*. If accumulations persist and appetite is poor with aversion to cold, purge again. Prepare the following powder: half a *sheng* of fine *dahuang* powder, half a *sheng* of *mangxiao*, two *liang* of *gancao*, and one *fen* each of *banxia*, *huangqin*, and *yuanhua*. Grind into powder and store in an airtight container. To administer, boil twenty *dazao* in eight *sheng* of water until soft, then strain to obtain four *sheng* of liquid. Add five *fangcunbi* of the powder, stir well, and heat the mixture three times (raising and lowering it over the fire). Divide into three doses and consume one in the morning. If bowel movements occur, the remaining doses may be omitted. If relief is not felt, take another dose.\n\nAfter purging, prepare wine congee and consume two *sheng*, followed by watery gruel. Do not delay eating, as an empty stomach may allow heat to enter, which can be fatal.\n\nAfter purging, always keep the following emergency formula on hand: one *ge* each of *dahuang* and *tingli*, thirty *xingren* and *badou*, ground and mixed with honey into pills the size of *hudou*. Take two pills daily.\n\nThose who experience diarrhea should reduce the dosage; those with abdominal fullness should increase it. There are many formulas for decoctions, powders, pills, and medicinal wines, but the key lies in maintaining coolness and allowing frequent bowel movements—only seeking free flow. The limbs should be kept in regular motion, and one must not miss meals or become hungry, nor consume spoiled rice, rotten fish, or meat. Additionally, one should avoid hot foods and drinks, heavy clothing, approaching fire, braving summer heat on long journeys, or excessive exposure to wind and cold.\n\nGenerally, the body should be in a robust state to tolerate these methods well. If illness has already manifested, one must forcibly endure the treatment. The medicines taken should primarily be those that resolve toxins and are cooling in nature.\n\nWhen taking powders, if the illness seems to have subsided, discontinue use. After twenty or thirty days, resume as needed. If stagnation remains unresolved, leading to vexing heat, it is due to improper dosage—one should then follow the prescribed methods for prevention and treatment.\n\nThis method is most often employed by the wealthy and carefree, while those who are poor and toil rarely experience adverse reactions, as their bodies are accustomed to cold and labor. However, in cases of critical danger, these few principles are briefly recorded here for urgent reference. The rest are detailed in the major formulas.\n\n**Additional Formulas**\n\n**From *The Sagely Benefit Formulas*:**\nFor treating the activation of alchemical minerals (rushi) causing congestion, heat, heart vexation, and blood vomiting: Pound fresh *cirsium* (thistle) to extract its juice, take three *ge* per dose, add a small amount of honey, stir well, and consume.\n\n*The Dietary Therapy* states: If heat from cinnabar or minerals erupts, cook *zizania* (wild rice) roots with crucian carp into a thick soup and eat it—after two or three servings, recovery will follow.\n\n**Formula Twenty-Three: For Sudden Upward Qi and Coughing**\n\n**For sudden upward qi with wheezing and near-collapse:**\nPound leeks to extract their juice and drink one *sheng*; an immediate cure will follow.\n\n**Another formula:**\nFinely slice three *sheng* of mulberry root bark, three *liang* of fresh ginger, and half a *sheng* of *zanthoxylum* (Sichuan pepper). Boil in seven *sheng* of water and five *sheng* of wine until reduced to three boils, strain, and consume the entire decoction. Once one *sheng* enters the mouth, the qi will descend. *A formula not transmitted in the *Thousand Gold*.*\n\n**Another formula:**\nTwo *sheng* of *zanthoxylum* and three *liang* of fresh ginger, boiled in seven *sheng* of water to yield two *sheng*; divide into three doses.\n\n**Another formula:**\nFour *liang* of *ephedra*, two *liang* each of cinnamon and licorice, and fifty apricot kernels—roast, pound into powder, and take one square *cun* spoonful with warm water, three times daily.\n\n**Another formula:**\nGrind *ginseng* into powder and take one square *cun* spoonful, five or six times daily.

Take twenty pills after meals with tea, avoiding raw scallions. *Transmitted by Attendant Secretary Shi.*\n\n**For sudden reversal of qi with upward surging, pain and fullness in both flanks, and near-collapse:**\nHeat water until scalding, then soak both feet and hands, changing the water frequently. This is called *bentun* (rushing piglet) disease, arising from sudden fright, terror, or sorrow. The qi surges downward, then violently strikes the heart, chest, and navel, causing a pounding sensation. If left untreated, it can be fatal. Most formulas require many ingredients and even the killing of a piglet, but this single decoction suffices.\n\nTwo *liang* each of licorice and ginseng, two *liang* of cinnamon bark, one *sheng* of *zanthoxylum*, one *jin* of fresh ginger, and one *sheng* of *pinellia*—boil in one *dou* of water to yield three *sheng*, divided into three doses. This medicine should be prepared in advance; when the illness strikes, compound it urgently.\n\n**Another formula:**\nTwo *liang* of *ephedra* and one *liang* of apricot kernels—roast until yellow, pound into powder, and take one square *cun* spoonful with wine, several times daily, until cured.\n\n**For sudden qi depletion where breathing fails to recover, with shoulders heaving and gasping:**\nThree *liang* of dried ginger—crush, steep in one *sheng* of wine, and take three *ge* per dose, three times daily.\n\n**Another formula:**\nMeasure the length from the base of the thumb to the crease at the heart, then moxa three cones at this point for a cure.\n\n**Another formula:**\nThree *liang* of *ephedra*—first decoct to remove froth—with two *liang* of licorice, boiled in three *sheng* of water to yield one and a half *sheng*, divided into three doses.\n\n**To prevent recurrence after recovery:**\nTake these two ingredients, roast fifty apricot kernels, and form into honey pills. Take four or five pills the size of *tung* seeds, three times daily, until cured.\n\n**Another formula:**\nTwo *liang* of *ephedra*, one *liang* each of cinnamon and licorice, and forty apricot kernels—boil in six *sheng* of water to yield two *sheng*, divided into three doses.\n\nThese three formulas may also be prepared as *xiaotoubei* decoctions. For those with qi blockages, the medicines can be pounded into powders and taken regularly. For those with excessive cold, add three *liang* of dried ginger. For those with copious phlegm, add three *liang* of *pinellia*.\n\n**For severe exertion from running or rushing, leading to panting and fatigue, followed by drinking cold water, which triggers upward qi and fever:**\nUse three *jin* of bamboo leaves and three *liang* of tangerine peel, boiled in one *dou* of water to yield three *sheng*. Strain and divide into three doses; one dose every three days is effective.\n\n**For extreme heat exhaustion or eating hot cakes followed by excessive cold water, which fails to disperse in the throat and instead generates qi, causing wheezing and panting:**\nEqual parts rhubarb, dried ginger, and croton seeds—grind into powder and take half a *qian* spoonful. If vomiting or diarrhea occurs, recovery will follow. If stagnation persists in the heart, chest, or diaphragm, causing discomfort:\n\nTwo parts *melon pedicel*, three parts *asarum*, and one part ginseng—pound, sift, and take one *qian* spoonful with hot water, two or three times daily, until effective.\n\n**For lung atrophy with coughing, spitting of frothy saliva, a warm sensation in the heart, vexation, and thirstlessness:**\nFive *liang* of fresh ginger, two *liang* each of ginseng and licorice, and eleven jujubes—boil in three *sheng* of water to yield one and a half *sheng*, divided into two doses.\n\n**Another formula:**\nTwo *liang* of licorice—boil in three *sheng* of water to yield one and a half *sheng*, divided into two doses.\n\n**Another formula:**\nPound fresh *asparagus* to extract one *dou* of juice, mix with one *dou* of wine, one *sheng* of malt sugar, and four *ge* of *aster*—simmer in a copper vessel over a water bath until it can be formed into pills. Take one pill the size of an apricot kernel, three times daily.\n\n**Another formula:**\nTwo *liang* of licorice, three *liang* of dried ginger, and twelve jujubes—boil in three *sheng* of water to yield one and a half *sheng*, divided into two doses.\n\n**For sudden onset of cold-induced upward qi:**\nThree *liang* of dried perilla leaves and four *liang* of aged tangerine peel—boil in four *sheng* of wine to yield one and a half *sheng*, divided into two doses.\n\n**For sudden coughing:**\nOne part soot from beneath a cauldron and seven parts fermented soybeans—pound into pills the size of *wu* seeds and take fourteen pills.\n\n**Another formula:**\nPrepare a black chicken as for eating, steep in good wine for half a day, then remove the chicken and drink the wine. *Alternatively, boil a white chicken in one* dou *of vinegar to yield three* sheng*, divided into three doses. Eat the chicken meat, but avoid salt for best results.*\n\n**Another formula:**\nMoxa one point between the fifth and sixth vertebrae below the *dazhui* (GV-14) point, once for each year of age. *Also treats upward qi.*\n\n**Another formula:**\nMoxa the junction of dark and light flesh beneath both nipples, one hundred cones each, and the condition will resolve. *Also treats upward qi.* Moxa one point on the chest opposite the nipples, with cones corresponding to the patient’s age.\n\n**Another formula:**\nTake three *sheng* of peach kernels, remove the skins, pound them, and place in a vessel. Seal tightly and steam for the duration of one cooking cycle. Then remove, dry in the sun, and store in a silk bag. Place the bag in two *dou* of wine for six or seven days. Drink four to five *ge* at first, gradually increasing to one *sheng*.\n\n**Another formula:**\nGrind six *liang* of malt sugar and six *liang* of dried ginger into powder.

Use a clay bowl with a drilled hole, inserting a small bamboo tube (a brush handle will suffice). The tube should be slightly long, and the bowl and pot should fit snugly. Seal the joint with mud to prevent air leaks. Place charcoal beneath the pot. After a short time, smoke from the *kuan dong hua* will emerge from the tube. Hold the tube in the mouth and inhale the smoke, swallowing it. If chest discomfort arises, lift the head and pinch the tube to prevent smoke leakage. Inhale until the smoke is exhausted. Perform this once every five days. On the sixth day, eat a full meal of mutton noodles, and the condition will resolve permanently.\n\n**Sheng Jin Fang’s Golden Millet Pill for Chronic, Sudden, or Consumptive Cough:**\nGrind one *liang* of *ci huang* (*orpiment*) finely.

Once dry, place the box on the ground and surround it with charcoal the size of *tanzi* bullets to form a mound. Ignite the charcoal from above, using a flatiron to cover the top, and let the fire gradually intensify. When one-third of the charcoal has burned, check if the *tanzi* pieces are uniformly red. If so, remove the fire and let cool. Open the box to retrieve the medicine, which should resemble a mirror’s surface—bright and red. Grind finely in a mortar, then mix with a water-soaked *bing* cake center to form pills the size of millet grains.

Hold one jujube in the mouth at a time and swallow slowly.\n\n**From the *Tested Later Formulas*:**\nTo suppress panting and dissolve phlegm: Take forty-nine pig trotter nails, wash and dry thoroughly. Place half a *zi* each of *banxia* and alum into each nail, seal in a jar to prevent smoke from escaping, and calcine until red-hot. Remove from fire, grind finely, and add one *qianbi* of musk. For those with upper panting and coughing, take with glutinous rice water. Children take half a *qian*. Most effective.\n\n**From the *Divine Garden Formulas*:**\nTo treat coughing with urgent counterflow *qi*, panting, coughing of blood, and spitting of blood: Take high-quality ginseng, pound into powder, and administer three *qianbi* per dose, mixed with egg white.

May also be taken internally.\n\nAnother formula: Take ten kernels from within plum pits, grind thoroughly, and mix with three *ge* of polished rice. Decoct in four *sheng* of water to make congee, reducing to two *sheng*, and consume. For subsequent doses, increase the number of kernels.\n\nAnother formula: Take one *sheng* of soybeans, decoct in five *sheng* of water until two *sheng* remain, discard the beans, add eight *sheng* of wine, and further decoct to nine *sheng*. Divide into three or four doses. After swelling subsides, avoid excessive drinking if thirsty.\n\nAnother formula: Take three *sheng* of ox urine in one dose; swelling will lessen. If unresolved, take again.\n\nAnother formula: Take one *jin* of *zhanglu* root, peel and slice thinly, decoct until soft, discard the dregs, and add one *jin* of mutton, scallions, fermented beans, and salt, prepared as a meal. Consume freely. After swelling subsides, this may still be taken regularly. Alternatively, pound *zhanglu* and mix half with rice to steam into cakes for consumption.\n\nAnother formula: Take one pig kidney, divide into seven pieces, dust with one *fen* of *gansui* powder, and roast until cooked. Consume one piece daily for four to five days until bowel sounds and increased urination are noted. If not, continue until finished. Remove the skin before eating, and consume entirely for best results. Do not eat salt. If incomplete, repeat the course.\n\nAnother formula: Slice two *sheng* of *zhanglu*, steep in three *sheng* of wine for three nights, and take five *ge* to one *sheng* three times daily.

The following formula treats this: Boil one *hu* of small beans until thoroughly soft, yielding four to five *dou* of liquid. Soak the area below the knees in the warm decoction twice daily until the swelling fully subsides. If the swelling has already entered the abdomen, do not soak; instead, consume only the boiled small beans, avoiding rice, fish, and salt. Drink the small bean decoction exclusively. In the absence of small beans, soybeans may be substituted. This condition is critical, with only one in ten surviving—treatment must be administered urgently.\n\nAnother formula: Shave paulownia or tung wood, boil to extract the juice, and soak the affected area while drinking a small amount. Adding small beans enhances efficacy.\n\nAnother formula: Finely chop one fresh pig’s liver and consume it at once. Do not consume with salt.

The inner thighs grow cold, the shins become full, and pressing leaves an indentation. When turning the abdomen, a sound of shifting nodes is heard—these are its signs.\n\nIf left untreated, the body gradually swells, and the abdomen becomes fully distended. Pressing causes the flesh to rebound—by this stage, the disease has taken hold, though it may still be treated. Such conditions often arise from depletion following major illness, after diarrhea, in women post-childbirth, or when water intake is not promptly dispersed. The Triple Burner is afflicted, urination obstructed, and gradual accumulation binds together, eventually flowing into the channels and network vessels.\n\n**Remedies:**\n\n1. Take one *sheng* of *tingli* (tingli seeds), stir-fry, and pound in a mortar. Slit open a live male mandarin duck, mix its blood and head with the *tingli*, and pound ten thousand times. Form into pills the size of parasol-tree seeds, starting with five and gradually increasing to ten. Avoid salt. Regularly consume rice with adzuki beans and drink adzuki bean broth; snakehead fish is also beneficial.\n\n2. Another formula: One *liang* each of *fangfeng* (saposhnikovia), *gancao* (licorice), and *tingli* (tingli seeds). Pound and mix with bitter wine to form pills the size of parasol-tree seeds.

Pound and mix with honey to form pills the size of soybeans. Take two pills, increasing to four. Recovery will follow.\n\nAnother formula: Soak two *sheng* of *tingli* seeds in five *sheng* of spring wine overnight. Take one *ge* at a time; urination will become unobstructed.\n\nAnother formula: One *liang* of *tingli* and twenty apricot kernels, stir-fried until yellow. Pound and divide into ten doses. Once urination is restored, recovery will follow immediately.\n\nAnother formula: *Hu Qia’s* \"Mercury Pills,\" highly effective for water swelling and promoting urination. As attested by Yao.\n\nOne *sheng* each of *tingli* and *jiaomu*, six *liang* of *mangxiao*, and ten *liang* of mercury. Boil the mercury in water for three days and nights, then combine and pound sixty thousand times. Form into pills the size of soybeans. Take three daily, increasing by one pill each day up to ten, then restart from one. After recovery, consume beef and mutton to restore strength, and drink in moderation.\n\nAnother formula: Gather and finely chop a large quantity of *ke* tree bark. Boil into a thick decoction and reduce until it can be formed into pills. Take three pills the size of parasol-tree seeds, then another after a short while. Water will be expelled. Later, take three pills three times daily. This tree is also called *munu* and is used by southerners to build boats.\n\nAnother formula: Equal parts genuine *suhexiang* (storax), mercury, and white lead, mixed with honey into pills. Take two pills the size of soybeans three times daily. Water will be expelled; regulate diet and rest well. If *suhexiang* is unavailable, omit it.\n\nAnother formula: Take twenty ripe castor beans, remove the skins, and grind. Mix with water to make three *ge* of liquid. Take once daily. Around midday, vomiting and diarrhea will expel accumulated water and fluids. If incomplete, take thirty beans three days later. If still incomplete, repeat the process. After recovery, regulate intake of fluids and salty foods.\n\nAnother formula: One *sheng* of adzuki beans and one white chicken, prepared as for eating. Boil in three *dou* of water until fully cooked. Consume the solids and drink the broth, gradually finishing all.\n\nAnother formula: Take a green-headed male duck and boil in five *sheng* of water until one *sheng* of broth remains. Drink gradually until finished. Cover thickly to induce sweating; this is beneficial.\n\nAnother formula: Swallow ten egg yolks from swallows’ eggs at once.\n\nAnother formula: Roast mole crickets until fully cooked and eat ten daily.\n\nAnother formula: For cases where only the abdomen is swollen, with fluid movement and gurgling sounds, and the skin turns black—this is called *water gu*. Take ninety *badou* (croton seeds), remove skins and hearts, and sixty apricot kernels, remove skins and tips. Stir-fry until yellow, pound together, and form into pills the size of small beans. Take one pill with water as needed. Wine may also be consumed; this is beneficial.\n\nAnother formula: Finely pound *guishan* (Chinese lobelia) and extract its juice. Drink an amount the size of a chicken egg to expel water, then treat the *water gu* again. Alternatively, grind hemp seeds into juice and drink.\n\nAnother formula: Boil thirty *jin* of *cimicao* (motherwort) and three *dan* of its seeds to obtain one *dan* of liquid. Strain and further reduce over heat until it can be formed into pills. Take three to five or six pills the size of *zaojia* seeds. Water will be expelled through urination; then consume thin rice porridge for nourishment.\n\nAnother formula: One large handful of white cogon grass roots and three *sheng* of adzuki beans. Boil in three *sheng* of water until dry, remove the grass roots, and eat the beans. Water will be expelled through urination.\n\nAnother formula: Ten *jin* each of *shuweicao* (common club moss) and *mabiancao* (European verbena). Boil in one *dan* of water to obtain five *dou* of liquid. Strain, further reduce, and mix with starch to form pills. Take two pills the size of soybeans, increasing to four or five. Avoid fatty meats and cold, raw foods.\n\nFor swelling and fullness: One handful of white mulberry tree bark, boiled in two *sheng* of water to obtain five *ge*. Grind two large white areca nuts into powder, add to the decoction, and boil for three to five more bubbles. Once done, add a small amount of *hongxue* (red snow) and consume. Also, under the section on swelling and fullness, formulas include drinking cow urine, *zhanglu* (pokeweed), mutton stew, and fragrant soft candies. The major formulas for the ten types of water swelling are recorded in a separate volume.\n\nIf water is only in the skin and not yet in the abdomen, take diaphoretic medicines to induce sweating for recovery. However, guard carefully against wind and cold. If only the abdomen is swollen and purgatives are ineffective, needle two *cun* below the navel, inserting several *fen* to drain the water. Stop when the puncture closes and the abdomen reduces.\n\n**Attached Formulas**\n\nFrom Li Jiang’s *Bingbu Shouji Fang*: A remedy for water disease, regardless of duration or severity, even with adverse pulses. One large *liang* each of *daji* (euphorbia), *danggui* (Chinese angelica), and *jupi* (tangerine peel). Chop and boil in one large *sheng* of water to obtain seven *ge*. Consume at once; two to three *dou* of water will be expelled. Do not be alarmed by the severity; recovery will follow after no more than two doses. Avoid toxic foods for one year. After water is expelled, take again to prevent recurrence. This formula originates from Zhang Shangke.\n\nFrom *Waitai Miyao*: For water qi. Peel and chop white *zhanglu* (pokeweed) roots into pieces the size of small beans, one large cupful. Boil in three *sheng* of water to obtain one *sheng*.

Avoid mixed foods.\n\nAnother remedy for water disease with swelling: Take one very large carp, remove the head, tail, and bones, retaining only the flesh. Boil with two *dou* of water and one large *sheng* of adzuki beans. Reduce to two *sheng* of liquid, strain through cloth, and consume at once. If unable to finish, divide into two doses, warming the second. After consumption, diarrhea will follow; recovery occurs once purging ceases.\n\nAnother formula: For sudden swelling and fullness. There was a case of sudden foot and leg swelling, gradually ascending to the knees, making walking impossible. Eventually, the head and face swelled, and the entire body became bloated and distended. Take the white pulp of a bitter gourd, shape into pieces the size of soybeans, wrap in dough, and boil briefly. Consume seven on an empty stomach. By midday, a *dou* of water will be expelled. For three days, water will continue to drain, leading to significant emaciation and recovery. Maintain dietary caution for three years.\n\nThe bitter gourd must be of fine quality—smooth, unblemished, with fine and orderly veins. If not, it is toxic and should not be used.\n\nFrom *Sheng Hui Fang*: To treat ten types of water retention in near-death cases, use half a *jin* of badger meat, sliced, with three *ge* of polished rice, three *sheng* of water, and cook into a porridge with scallions, Sichuan pepper, ginger, and fermented soybeans; consume.\n\nAnother formula: For ten types of water disease with swelling, fullness, panting, and inability to lie down, take five mole crickets, dry and grind into powder, and take half a *qianbi* to one *qian* before meals, mixed with hot water.

If the swelling has entered the abdomen, consume only the adzuki beans without other foods; this will also cure. Li Jiang’s *Bing Bu Shou Ji Fang* also records this method, which has proven effective.\n\n**Section Twenty-Six: Formulas for Sudden Abdominal Masses**\n\nFor sudden, violent masses in the abdomen resembling stone, with stabbing pain and day-and-night wailing, if left untreated, death occurs within a hundred days.

This ash is also used in dyeing crimson; the leaves are used in brewing wine. *Poncirus* is pronounced *zhi ren*.\n\nGenerally, masses develop gradually. If suddenly noticed and already large and firm, they are difficult to treat. Abdominal masses and accumulations impair eating and lead to emaciation.

After three to five days, the yellow will disperse like thin clouds, though the eyes recover last. Full restoration takes a hundred days.

When Yao Sengyuan first served at court, Emperor Wu of Liang developed a fever and wished to take rhubarb. Sengyuan advised, “Rhubarb is a swift-acting purgative; Your Majesty is advanced in years and should not use it lightly.” The emperor disregarded his counsel and nearly collapsed. Later, Emperor Yuan suffered from a thoracic and abdominal ailment. All the physicians insisted that mild medicines should be used gradually to harmonize and unblock. Sengyuan, however, declared, “The pulse is surging and replete—this indicates retained food. Without rhubarb, there is no hope of recovery.” The emperor followed his advice and recovered.\n\nFrom this, we see that modern physicians often use a single potent medicine to treat myriad illnesses. When they happen to cure a condition, they deem the formula miraculous, yet when they err, they never acknowledge their misapplication of the medicine. Such practitioners are legion—how can one not take heed!\n\n**Cultivating the True Formulae: Divine Immortal Recipes**\n\n**Cuscuta Seed Elixir**\nTake one *dou* of cuscuta seeds and one *dou* of wine; steep for a long while, then strain and dry in the sun.

After twenty-one days, increase the dose to three *qian* per serving. This elixir bestows a radiant complexion, and after three years, the old shall revert to youth. It also treats lumbar and knee ailments, dispels wind, and with prolonged use, extends lifespan.\n\n**Formula Thirty-Three: Remedy for Debilitation, Emaciation, and Inability to Endure Labor**\nFor those with a long-standing predisposition to overwork, whose suffering manifests upon exertion—causing pain throughout the body, joints, and skin, or inducing heat and tendon tension—proceed as follows:\nTake a one-*chi* length of root from the southeast side of a white *zhe* tree. Scrape off the outer bark, retaining the inner layer. Burn it to ashes or finely chop and pound it. Take three *fangcunbi* with wine, then cover thickly to induce sweating. Administer thrice daily. If wine is unavailable, use fermented grain water instead.\n*(Note: The white *zhe* is a thornless variety of *zhe*.)*\n\n**Formula for Sudden Prolonged Insomnia**\nAt dusk, heat a new cloth over fire and use it to warm the eyes.\n\n**Additionally, steam large soybeans, then alternate filling pillows with them. When the pillow cools, replace it with a warm one. Sleeping through the night with a pillow of hot soybeans will bring immediate relief.**\n\n**These two remedies originally appeared in the Miscellaneous Treatments section. Both address depletion from overwork. Though not immediately critical, if left untreated, such conditions gradually consume the person. Later efforts to restore health require several times the effort, so these methods are recorded here in brief.**\n\n**For men and women suffering from chronic depletion due to overwork, or those who fail to recover after severe illness—manifesting as heaviness in the limbs, aching bones and muscles, shortness of breath, panting upon movement, or tension in the lower abdomen, stiffness in the back and waist, palpitations, dry throat and lips, pallor, loss of appetite, debility of yin and yang, melancholy, excessive sleep, and prolonged inactivity—if untreated for years or even a hundred days, they gradually grow emaciated, the qi of the five viscera depletes, and recovery becomes difficult.**\n\n**Decoction Formula:**\nTwo *liang* of licorice, three *liang* of cinnamon, four *liang* of peony, five *liang* of fresh ginger (dried ginger may be substituted), and twenty-one jujubes.

At dawn, take all with well-flower water in one dose. Afterward, drink wine to intoxication and consume water—more is better. Take another dose every other day. Avoid meat for one hundred days.\n\n**Bone steaming is also called \"internal steaming.\"** The term \"internal\" signifies external cold with internal heat clinging to the bones. Its root lies within the five viscera and six bowels. Symptoms may include dry, lusterless skin, gradual thinning of the limbs, and swollen feet during steaming episodes.\nGrind gypsum into a fine powder (like milk), mix with water, and take one *fangcunbi* twice daily until the body feels cool.\n\n*From* **Cui Yuanliang’s Hai Shang Fang**: *Treats bone steaming and ghostly qi.*\nTake five *dou* of boys’ urine (settled) and five *dou* of green wormwood (harvested in the eighth or ninth month, with seeds, finely chopped).

Fresh barley flour is even better; if unavailable, *mi* (coarse grain) may suffice.\n\n**These four entries originally appeared in the \"Wei Ye\" section, all pertaining to dietary and spleen-stomach matters. When stomach qi is full and strong, food-related ailments will never arise. Dietary care should first address the root, hence the subsequent enumeration of methods.**\n\n**For abdominal deficiency-cold, inability to eat, and undigested food, leading to emaciation, weakness in the limbs, and the onset of myriad illnesses:**\nTake ten *jin* of fresh rehmannia, pound to extract juice, and mix with three *jin* of fine flour.

Discontinue once the qi disperses.\n\n---\n\n**Prescription Thirty-Five: For Sudden Famine, Starvation, and Near-Death Exhaustion**\nGrain is the sustenance of life; deprivation for several days can prove fatal. While *The Divine Farmer’s Classic* describes methods to stave off hunger, medical texts seldom address such techniques, likely because they border on the realm of immortals and transcend common practice. Thus, in years of famine, corpses lie strewn across the roads—truly lamentable.\n\nHere, I record only the most accessible methods. If stranded in a desolate wilderness, fallen into a ravine, deep well, or ancient tomb, with no hope of rescue, one must drink water and practice qi absorption. The method is as follows:\n\nClose the mouth, stir the tongue against the upper and lower teeth to generate saliva, and swallow it. Three hundred and sixty swallows per day are ideal; with practice, one may reach a thousand, naturally eliminating hunger. Initial fatigue may arise for three to five days, but thereafter, strength gradually returns.\n\nOther methods, such as consuming the six *wu* hours of the twelve Earthly Branches, are omitted here, as one in dire straits may struggle to discern directions or time.\n\nIf water is available but no vessel, cup it in the left hand and recite: *\"By the grace of the attending officials, true famine strikes. The correct red-yellow path avoids passing beneath city walls. Physicians, take heed for yourselves.\"* Conclude by tapping the teeth three times, then tapping the left hand three times with the right hand. Repeat this thrice, then drink. If a cup is later obtained, store water in it, hold it in the left hand, and tap it with an object in the right hand as before. Drinking three *sheng* daily will prevent hunger and restore health.\n\nIf able to traverse mountains and marshes:\nGather pine or cypress leaves, finely chop, and consume two *ge* with water, two to three *sheng* at midday. Alternatively, dig and wash white cogon grass roots, chop, and consume. These three substances may be sun-dried, pounded on stone, and taken in *fangcunbi* doses to sustain for a day.\n\nIf soybeans are available, roast until hot, then consume with water until sated; this provides relief for ten days. Red small beans are also effective. Roast both beans until yellow, grind into powder, and consume one to two *sheng* to sustain for ten days.\n\nAmong herbs, *atractylodes*, asparagus root, *ophiopogon*, Solomon’s seal, and fritillaria may be eaten raw or cooked, alone or together. Tree fungi, sandalwood, and white elm bark also stave off hunger.\n\nIn times of famine when grain is scarce and life depends on medicinal aid:\nTake one *dou* of rice, wash thoroughly, steam and sun-dry it a hundred times, then pound. Consume once daily with water for thirty days; thereafter, one may abstain from food entirely while traveling three hundred *li* daily.\n\nAnother method: Soak one *dou* of non-glutinous rice in three *sheng* of wine, remove and sun-dry, then soak again until the wine is exhausted. Consume gradually, drinking when thirsty, to sustain for thirty days. One *hu* and two *sheng* suffice for a year.\n\nThere is also the *Guard the Center Pill* method. The above methods using rice and beans are easily obtained and prepared, harmonizing with grain qi to preserve strength without depletion. However, those of impure constitution may struggle with prolonged medicinal reliance; if possible, alternate with grains.\n\nRefer to my *Grain Prescriptions* for further details.\n\n**Additional Prescriptions**\n\nFrom *Imperial Grace Formulary*:\n**Method for Grain Abstinence and Immortal Ascension:**\nPound pine nuts into a paste, mix three *qian* with wine, and consume thrice daily to eliminate hunger. Drink water when thirsty, avoiding other foods. After a hundred days, the body becomes light, capable of traveling five hundred *li* daily.\n\nFrom *Leisure Talks of a Rustic*:\n**Master Fuhu’s Pine Resin Refinement Method:**\nBoil ten *jin* of pine resin in water five times to remove bitterness. For each *jin* of refined resin, mix with four *liang* of poria powder. Take one *daogui* each morning with water to abstain from food for a year, extending lifespan with a light, clear body.\n\nFrom *Baopuzi*:\nDuring the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han, a hunter in the Zhongnan Mountains encountered a person without clothing, their body entirely covered in black hair, leaping over gullies and ravines as if flying. Stealthily observing their whereabouts, the hunters surrounded and captured them, discovering it was a woman. When questioned, she said: \"I was a palace woman of Qin. When the eastern rebels arrived, the King of Qin surrendered and fled. Startled, I ran into the mountains. Starving and on the verge of death, an old man taught me to eat the leaves and seeds of pine and cypress. At first, they were bitter and astringent, but later I grew accustomed to them and no longer felt hunger. I no longer suffered from cold in winter or heat in summer.\" This woman was from the Qin era, and by the time of Emperor Cheng, over three hundred years had passed.\n\n*Wanxian Weng’s Handbook of Emergency Prescriptions*, Volume Four, concludes here.\n\n*Ge Xianweng’s Handbook of Emergency Prescriptions*, Volume Five:\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: Remedies for Carbuncles, Breast Abscesses, and Various Toxic Swellings**\n\n**Hidden Recluse’s Effective Remedies:**\nFor *yangju* sores with itching worms: Grind eight *fen* of *fuzi* (aconite) and two *fen* of *lilu* (veratrum) into powder and apply.

If the right breast is swollen, consume milk from the left breast; if the left breast is swollen, consume milk from the right breast. This will disperse the root of the swelling. Yao’s formula is identical and guarantees a cure.\n\n**Yao’s Remedy:**\nPound fresh *dihuang* (rehmannia) and apply; replace when warm. Red beans are also effective.\n\nAnother note: If hundreds of treatments fail and the swelling remains hard and purple, use the earlier willow root bark method—heat until warm and apply to the swelling. It will heal overnight.\n\n**General Note:**\nIf breast milk is not expelled and congeals internally, it is called \"jealousy breast,\" which is more urgent than carbuncle.\n\n**Xu Yu’s Remedy for Painful Breast Nodules:**\nTake three *liang* each of *dahuang* (rhubarb) and *huanglian* (coptis). Boil in five *sheng* of water until reduced to one *sheng* and two *ge*.

Pound the stone and mix with the medicine. Use the remaining wine first; if insufficient, add more.\n\n**Yao’s Note:**\nIf the swelling is extremely hard with a root, it is called \"stone carbuncle.\" Moxibustion with one hundred cones should be applied to the top; the stone will fragment and emerge. If it does not, increase the moxa.\n\n**General Warning:**\nCarbuncles, deep-rooted sores, tumors, stone carbuncles, tendon nodules, and scrofula must never be treated with needles or cupping. Such methods often lead to disaster.\n\n**For Unruptured Carbuncles:**\nGrind *wancao* (sweet flag) into powder, mix with egg white, and apply thickly to paper. Replace when dry; the pain will subside.\n\n**For Severe, Throbbing Carbuncle Swelling:**\nGrind *dahuang* (rhubarb), sift, mix with bitter wine, and apply to the swelling.

Highly effective.\n\n**For Bone-Exposing Sores:**\nGrind two *fen* each of *huanglian* (coptis) and *muli* (oyster shell) into powder. First wash with salted wine, then apply.\n\n**Ge’s Sudden *Biaoju* Sores (Clustering Like Grains on Hands, Feet, or Shoulders, Oozing Fluid):**\nRoast and pound *wujing* (turnip), wrap, and apply while rolling over the sores day and night without ceasing.\n\n**For Deep-Rooted Sores at the Fingertips (Red-Black, Difficult to Treat):**\nFollow major formulas; simple remedies are insufficient.\n\n**For Chronic Bone Carbuncles (Oozing Fluid When Pressed, Unhealed for Years):**\nHeat maltose and apply to the sore, then press a fresh crucian carp onto it. After the time it takes to cook rice, scrape and inspect—small worms will emerge. Wash and reapply the medicine until the worms are gone; healing will follow.\n\n**Yao’s Formula on *Biaoju* (Flame Carbuncle):**\n*Biaoju* arises suddenly in the flesh as a dark nodule, the size of a bean or grain. In severe cases, it may grow as large as a plum, appearing red, black, white, or green. The lesion contains a core with deep roots, and after a brief period, the surrounding area swells entirely. The blisters turn dusky, purplish-black, capable of rotting sinews and bones. If the toxin enters the viscera, it may prove fatal. In the South, it is called *tuozhu* (clinging toxin). Where it afflicts thick flesh, excise it, then cauterize with red-hot iron three times until charred like charcoal. Alternatively, apply moxibustion directly on the dark core, one hundred cones for best effect. In early spring, layer *suanmo* leaves around the lesion to prevent spread. Drink juices of *kuigen* (mallow root), *xijiao* (rhinoceros horn), and *shengma* (cimicifuga) to purge internal and external heat. The treatment follows the method for *dandu* (cinnabar toxin).\n\n**Liu Juanzi’s Yellow Qi Paste for Suppurating Carbuncles (Draining Pus and Blood, Promoting Flesh):**\n*Huangqi* (astragalus), *shaoyao* (peony), *dahuang* (rhubarb), *danggui* (angelica), *xiongqiong* (ligusticum), *duhuo* (angelica pubescens), *baizhi* (angelica dahurica), *xiebai* (Chinese chive), each one *liang*; *shengdihuang* (fresh rehmannia), three *liang*.

Apply to the sore, massaging the surrounding area, three times daily.\n\n**Decoction for *Danyong* (Cinnabar Carbuncle) at Onset (Spreading and Enlarging, Including Minor *Dan Tuo* in Children):**\n*Shengma* (cimicifuga), *huanglian* (coptis), *dahuang* (rhubarb), *xiongqiong* (ligusticum), each two *liang*; *huangqin* (scutellaria), *mangxiao* (mirabilite), each three *liang*; *danggui* (angelica), *zhigancao* (honey-fried licorice), *lingyangjiao* (antelope horn), each one *liang*. Chop the nine ingredients, boil in one *dou* and three *sheng* of water to five *sheng*, strain, return to the pot, and stir in *mangxiao* with a wooden stick until a paste forms. Adjust temperature, spread on cloth, and apply to the swelling. Repeat until the swelling dissipates. This is Wang Lian’s secret formula from Ganlin—take care to avoid the genitals.\n\n**Hu Powder for *Biaochuang* (Flame Sores, Spreading with Copious Discharge):**\nRoast *hufen* (lead powder), *zhigancao* (honey-fried licorice), *qianru* (rubia), and *huanglian* (coptis), each two *fen*.

Grind into powder, take one *fangcunbi* with wine, seven times by day and four by night—more is better. If the affliction is above, vomiting occurs; if below, pus and blood discharge. This pertains to *changyong* (intestinal carbuncle), where the swelling is painless. Long-term use treats all carbuncles and hemorrhoids. If the sore has already ulcerated, healing is swift. No *fabei* (back carbuncle) is incurable, and the swelling resolves unnoticed. For prolonged use, omit *baijiang* (patrinia), which is especially effective for *faru* (breast carbuncle), postpartum conditions, and abdominal masses in women. All are Liu Juanzi’s formulas.\n\n**Liu Juanzi’s Mu Zhansi Powder for Dissolving Pus in Carbuncles:**\n*Muzhansi* (aralia), *guixin* (cinnamon bark), *renshen* (ginseng), *xixin* (asarum), *baijiang* (patrinia), *ganjiang* (dried ginger), *zhihoupo* (honey-fried magnolia bark), *zhigancao* (honey-fried licorice), *fangfeng* (saposhnikovia), *jiegeng* (platycodon), each one *liang*. Grind into powder, take one *fangcunbi*. Upon swallowing, one feels it flow into the sore. If the carbuncle has been cauterized but not ulcerated, it may be taken. If the sore has not ulcerated, omit *baijiang*. Occasionally, this formula may reduce a carbuncle to water.\n\n**Bailian Paste for Unresolved *Yong* Swellings, Scrofula, and Nodules:**\n*Bailian* (ampelopsis), *huanglian* (coptis), *dahuang* (rhubarb), *huangqin* (scutellaria), *wangcao* (lithospermum), *chishizhi* (red halloysite), *wuzhuyu* (evodia), *shaoyao* (peony), each four *fen*. Grind, sift, and mix with egg white into a paste. Spread on old cloth and apply, leaving a small opening. Replace when dry. Heals.\n\n**For Life-Threatening *Fabei* (Back Carbuncle):**\nTake a winter melon, cut off the top, and place it over the sore. When the melon rots, cut it away and replace. Before the melon is exhausted, the sore will have contracted—then nourish with paste.\n\n**Alternative Formula:**\nGrind *fulonggan* (furnace earth) into powder, mix with wine, and apply thickly to the sore. Replace when dry; recovery follows swiftly.\n\n**Another Formula:**\nToast *wutongziye* (paulownia leaves) on a griddle until charred, sift through silk, mix with honey, and apply. Replace when dry.\n\n**Miscellaneous Effective Formulas for *Yong* Swellings (Treating Heat Swellings):**\nPound *jiazi* (mustard seeds) with *baiye* (cypress leaves) and apply—universally effective. Wild mustard is even better.\n\n**Another Formula:**\nGrind *xiaojiezi* (small mustard seeds) into powder, mix with vinegar into cakes, and apply to swellings or scrofula. Check frequently; stop when the swelling subsides to avoid damaging flesh. Effective for *mafugu* (horse bone carbuncle).\n\n**Another Formula:**\nBurn human feces into ash, mix with vinegar into a paste, and apply to the swelling. Replace when dry—highly effective.\n\n**Another Formula:**\nTake yellow *xionghuang* (realgar) and *cihuang* (orpiment), heat until red, then douse with strong vinegar. Reheat and douse again until the stones soften like mud. Scrape and apply to the swelling; if dry, mix with vinegar. This is a great secret.\n\n**Method to Resolve Swellings with Moxibustion:**\nSlice a single garlic clove crosswise to a thickness of one *fen*, place on the swelling’s head, and apply moxa cones the size of *wutongzi* (paulownia seeds), one hundred cones. If no reduction is felt, repeat frequently—more is better. Avoid excessive heat; if pain is felt, lift the garlic. Replace charred garlic with fresh. Do not burn the skin or flesh. If the body is dry, moxibustion is unnecessary.\n\nI have once suffered from a large swelling below the lower abdomen, and moxibustion cured it. Whenever I use this method, it proves highly effective.\n\n**Another Formula:**\nTake the kernel from the head of fresh ginseng [text unclear], or mix magnetite powder with vinegar and apply.\n\n**Another Formula:**\nApply licorice [text unclear] to this swelling—do not ingest the plantain seed.\n\n**Another Formula:**\nApply chicken-intestine herb.\n\n**Another Formula:**\nApply white *bai lian* (ampelopsis) powder—also effective.\n\n**For Hot Swellings and Boils:**\nApply roasted glue repeatedly, ten or more times a day, and it will resolve.

When the flesh is gone, stop and apply other ointments. If flesh does not regenerate, apply astragalus powder. *Lan ru* and astragalus halt all malignant flesh. If the flesh persists, use seven heads of red-skinned *lan ru* ground into powder—take half a *qianbi* and mix with three *qianbi* of white *lan ru* powder to apply. This is Yao’s formula, and it heals.\n\n**For Malignant Vessel Disease:**\nSuddenly, red vessels resembling earthworms appear on the body. This arises from evil wind entering the collaterals in spring or winter, causing blood stasis. Take *Five Fragrances and Forsythia Decoction*, lance to remove blood, and apply *Red Sage Ointment*—it will heal after some days. When I crossed mountains and ridges, I suffered from this and regularly took *Five Fragrances Decoction*, applying mung beans to reduce the swelling. The following are all Yao’s formulas.\n\n**For Malignant Nodule Disease:**\nSuddenly, nodules like plums or apricots appear in the flesh, or small ones like soybeans, with sharp pain moving beneath the skin, accompanied by fever and chills. This disease arises abruptly; if the toxin enters the abdomen, it can kill. This affliction is common in the south. Take *Five Fragrances and Forsythia Decoction* and apply mung beans—it will resolve immediately. For children, applying *Red Sage Ointment* is also effective.\n\n**For Malignant Flesh Disease:**\nSuddenly, flesh like red adzuki beans protrudes from the body, growing into shapes like cow or horse udders or rooster combs. Take *Rhaponticum Decoction* internally, and externally cauterize with a heated iron, three times daily, until slightly charred. Apply *Cimicifuga Ointment*.\n\n**For Qi Pain Disease:**\nSuddenly, a localized pain like a blow appears in the body, unbearable and wandering, flaring up intermittently. When the pain subsides, the area feels cold as if touched by frost or snow. This arises from sudden cold injuring the body during winter warmth extending into spring. First take several doses of *Five Fragrances and Forsythia Decoction*. Also, boil willow bark in white wine and apply warm compresses. Where red spots appear, lance to remove blood.\n\n**Five Fragrances and Forsythia Decoction:**\nTreats malignant flesh, malignant vessels, malignant nodules, scrofula, wind-binding swellings, and qi pain.\n*Costus root, eaglewood, clove* (each 2 *liang*), *musk* (0.5 *liang*), *frankincense* (1 *liang*), *belamcanda rhizome, Chinese knotweed, cimicifuga, pubescent angelica, mistletoe, roasted licorice, forsythia* (each 2 *liang*), *rhubarb* (3 *liang*), *bamboo sap* (3 *sheng*).

Maintain warmth without burning the flesh.\n\n**Appended Formulas:**\n\nIf the swelling is hot and painful, change the compress urgently—the ailment will abate, and the patient will soon recover. Apply twice daily.\n\nIf moxibustion is used and pus begins to flow from a preexisting sore, the condition will improve.\n\n**From *Waizhai Miyao*:**\nTreats impending back carbuncles (with chills and shivering as if about to erupt) or existing sores and swellings.\nDissolve **3 liang** of **xiao shi** (borax) in **1 sheng** of warm water until dissolved, then cool. Take an old green cloth, fold it three times, cut to fit the affected area’s size and shape, dampen it, and apply. Replace immediately when it grows hot. Frequent changes will swiftly heal the condition.\n\n**From *Jiyan Fang*:**\nTreats back carbuncles.\nTake **100 live snails**, place them in a clean **1 sheng** jar with **1 bowl of fresh-drawn water**, seal, and leave overnight until dawn.

In *Zhou Li · Yang Yi* (Physician of Ulcers), it states:\n*\"In treating carbuncles and abscesses, the Five Toxins are used to attack them.\"* Zheng Xuan’s commentary explains:\n*\"Modern medical prescriptions include Five Toxin medicines, made by mixing yellow *huangdi* (瓦), stone gall, cinnabar, realgar, *yushi* (誉石), and magnetite, then burning them for three days and nights. The rising smoke is collected with chicken feathers and applied to the wound. Rotten flesh and bone will then be expelled entirely.\"*\n\nThus, the scholar-official Yang Yi once recorded:\n*\"When Zhishu Guan was young, a carbuncle formed on his cheek, spreading to the jaw and outer ear, swelling like an overturned bowl. It ulcerated, draining pus and blood incessantly, causing unbearable pain. After countless treatments over a year without improvement, someone advised him to follow Zheng’s method. After preparing and applying the burned medicine, within moments, the rotting bone—including two teeth—drained out, and he recovered fully, remaining healthy afterward.\"* This confirms the swift efficacy of ancient prescriptions in treating disease.\n\nThe *huangdi* (瓦) used in this process resembles the glazed tiles sold in markets today. In modern alchemy, yellow glazed tiles (*huangzhen*) are still employed, as recorded in antiquity. *Huangdi* is pronounced *wǔ*.\n\nFrom *Mei Shi Fang*:\nFor **postpartum lactation failure**, where milk accumulates and forms a carbuncle, apply crushed *pu gong yao* (蒲公草) to the swelling, changing it three or four times daily. Commonly called *pu gong ying* (蒲公英), though the name is corrupted from *púgōngyīng* to *púgōngguō* in speech.

It will dissolve immediately.\n\nFrom *Chan Bao*:\nFor **breast and carbuncle swellings**:\nTake **chicken dung powder**, administer one *fangchén* dose, repeating three times at short intervals. It will heal.\n\n*Mei Shi Fang* also treats **cracked nipples** with the same method.\n\nFrom *Jian Yao Ji Zhong*:\nFor **female breast carbuncles** where pus does not drain, forming internal abscesses (**jealous milk**):\nBurn **wild bee combs** to ash, grind, and take two *qian* per dose with one *zhongshao* cup of water, decocting until reduced by four parts. Strain, warm, and ingest.\n\nAnother method for treating **blocked lactation** (*chui nai*):\n**Du Sheng San** (独胜散):\nTake **half *liang* of white cloves**, grind into powder. Administer one *qian* dose with warm wine, without regard to time.\n\nFrom *Zi Mu Mi Lu*:\nFor **blocked lactation** with **chills and high fever**:\nSoak **pork lard** in cold water, apply as a poultice, changing when it warms. Immediate effect.\n\nFrom *Yang Yan Nan Xing Fang*:\nFor **unbearable pain from blocked lactation**:\nUse **baked *chuan shan jia* (穿山甲), *mu tong* (木通), and raw *zi ran tong* (自然铜)**, each one *liang*. Grind into powder. Take two *qian* per dose with warm wine, without regard to time.\n\n*Shi Yi Xin Jing* states:\nFor **blocked lactation without itching or pain**, where the breast hardens like stone:\nTake **one *liang* of green tangerine peel**, boil in water to remove the white pith, dry, and grind into powder. Take two *qian* doses with warm wine, without regard to time.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven:** Methods for treating **intestinal carbuncles and lung carbuncles**\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight:** Methods for treating **sudden onset of malignant toxic sores** (*danhuo* evil carbuncles)\n\n**Ge Shi’s Treatments for Sudden Malignant Carbuncles (Unidentifiable in Adults and Children):**\nBurn **bamboo leaves**, mix with the yolk of an egg, and apply—it will heal.\n\n**Alternative Method:**\nTake **snakeweed seed (*she chuang zi*)** and **rhubarb (*huang lian*)**, each two *liang*, grind into powder, and apply with **pork fat**—it will heal.\n\n**Alternative Method:**\nBurn **snake skin**, grind into powder, and apply with **pork fat**.\n\n**Alternative Method:**\nBoil **willow leaves** or **willow bark**, wash the carbuncle with the decoction (adding a little salt)—this also treats **facial carbuncles**.\n\n**Another Method for Facial Carbuncles:**\nTake **one *sheng* of pork fat from the twelfth month**, **hair clippings the size of an egg**, and **one live crucian carp**. Simmer until fully dissolved, then add **two *liang* of realgar (*zhong huang*) and *ku shen* powder**, and **one *ku* of *fu zi*** (processed).

His **eyebrows and hair fell out**, his **nose bridge collapsed**, and his skin developed **sores like scabies (*xiǎn*)**—all deemed **incurable afflictions**. His family **despaired of his survival**.\n\nHe then **sought refuge in the Luó Valley of Yángzhou**. While there, he **encountered a wandering Daoist (*dào liú*)** who emerged from the valley. The Daoist **did not reveal his name or lineage** but gave him a prescription:\nTake **one to two jīn of soapberry thorns (*zào jiǎo cì*)**, burn them to **ash**, then **steam and dry** them thoroughly.

Thus, he sought a black snake, placed it alive in a jar, and fermented it with **malted barley** (*qū niè*). For several days, the snake’s cries never ceased. When the wine was ready, its aroma was intense, and he drank it fully. In moments, it all transformed into water, leaving only the snake’s **hair and scales** (*máo fā*).

Rinse the eyes several times with cold water—this shall cure the ailment.\n\n**From the *Bó Jì Prescriptions*:**\nFor wind-toxin ascending, causing swollen, itchy, and dry eyes with unbearable pain—sometimes with red, ulcerated upper or lower eyelids, or with floating cataracts and encroaching opaque growths—**Divine Wind-Dispelling Powder** is highly effective.\n**Fivefold Myrobalan (wǔbèizi)**, 1 liang; **Climbing Honeysuckle Seed (mànjīngzi)**, 1.5 liang. Grind into a powder. For each dose, take 2 qián with 2 bowls of water, simmer in a copper or stone vessel until reduced to 1 bowl. Strain, then apply warm to wash the eyes.

Before sleep, mix with cold tea and take 2 sháo.\n\nAnother prescription: For cold-toxin from injury by cold attacking the eyes, causing white cataracts, use **2 liang of cuttlefish bone (wūzéiyú gǔ)**, excluding the large skin, ground into powder.

Knead with multiple hands into pills the size of **Chinese catalpa seeds (wútóngzi)**. Take seven pills with warm water after each meal, repeating for five doses. This treats all eye diseases, cataracts, and blindness caused by green or blue afflictions. **Avoid pork and cold water.**\n\nSùyǔxī remarks: There was a man named **Cuī Chéngyuán**, who, while serving in office, pardoned a condemned prisoner. Years later, he fell ill and died by his own hand. One night, suffering from internal cataracts and blindness, as he sat alone sighing in the dead of night, he heard a rustling sound from the veranda. Asked who it was, the voice replied: *\"I am the prisoner you once spared—I have come to repay this kindness.\"* The man then revealed this prescription before passing away. Following its use, his eyesight returned within months.\n\nThus the prescription was passed down to the world.\n\nAnother prescription: the modern physician’s eye-washing decoction.\nTake equal parts of **dang gui (Chinese angelica)**, **sháo yào (white peony)**, and **huáng lián (coptis)**, finely ground. Brew with **snow water** or **sweetened water** into a thick infusion, and wash the eyes while hot—if it cools, rewarm and wash again. This greatly benefits the eyes. It treats **wind-toxicity**, **red-eye**, and **flowery cataracts**, all of which it governs.\n\nIts principle states: All eye diseases arise from stagnant blood and vessels, so **blood-moving herbs** are combined with **huáng lián** to treat them. Blood, when heated, flows freely—that is why the wash must be applied while hot. Those who use it will find miraculous results.\n\nAnother prescription: for **crow’s-eye disease** (presbyopia), regardless of age.\nTake **two liáng of cāng zhú (atractylodes)**, pound and sift into a powder. Each dose: **one qián**. At any time, take a fresh **sheep’s liver**, slit open with a bamboo knife, sprinkle the powder inside, bind tightly with hemp string, and boil in **a large bowl of fermented rice water** until done. The patient first inhales the steam, then—once the medicinal vapor has dissipated—ingests the liver. *(From *Jiǎn Yào Jì Zhòng*)* For children’s **crow’s-eye disease**. *(From *Méi Shī Fāng*)* To treat **yellowed, dim vision** where objects are unseen.\nSlice **qīng yáng (green sheep’s) liver**, eat with **diluted vinegar**.

Apply to the eyes while lying supine—within three or four days, vision will return as in youth. **Avoid alcohol, oil, and wheat flour.**\n\n*(From *Qiān Jīn Fāng*)* To treat **children’s black, cloudy cataracts** with pain and dryness.\nBurn **one liáng of bèi chǐ (oyster shell)** into ash, grind into a fine powder, mix with a small amount of **long náo (camphor)**, and apply.

Remove, grind into a powder, mix with a small amount of **long náo (camphor)**, and refine finely. For those with **long-standing eye films** causing dimness and blurred distance vision—even if the pupil remains unbroken—this will cure them.\n\nEach application uses **two mǐ of the powder**, applied to the eyes.\n\nAnother prescription: for **internal and external cataracts**.\nTake **four liáng of cāng zhú (atractylodes)**, soak in **rice-wash water for seven days**, changing the water daily, then scrape off the blackened skin, slice finely, and fry with **one liáng of qīng yán (green salt)** until yellow.

This is effective.\n\n**On the Blindness of Gu’s Nurturing Sister**\nGu’s sister, who had lost her sight, was once treated by Gu himself. He refused to wear his cap or eat until he obtained a **viper’s gallbladder**—a remedy for her affliction. Though he searched exhaustively, he found none. A boy then presented him with a single *gē* (合) measure of the substance, which proved to be the very gallbladder. As the boy departed, he transformed into a **green crow** (青乌) and vanished. The sister’s vision was immediately restored.\n\n---\n**Section 47: Treatments for Sudden Deafness and Related Ailments**\n\n**Bo Ge’s Sudden Deafness**\nTake **mouse gallbladder**, instill into the ear—**no more than three drops**—and recovery follows.\n\nAnother account states: If one tilts the head outward and exhausts a single gallbladder’s contents, the bile will soon seep from the lower ear.

Before entering mountains or grasslands, one must first restrain them. The ritual method states:\n\n*\"Upon reaching the mountain’s base, hold your breath for thirty-five breaths. Visualize the divine spirit summoning a tiger to stand before you, then store it within your lungs. A White Emperor emerges, sealing the tiger’s eyes. Your lower *dantian* then expels lung *qi*, and the White Crown ascends above the forest canopy.*\n\n*After a long pause, hold your breath again for thirty-five breaths. With both hands, pinch the tiger’s eyes in three steps—each step taken with the right foot leading. Then halt and recite:*\n\n*'Li Er, Li Er—are you not Li Er? You stole the Yellow Emperor’s hound. The Yellow Emperor commands me to question you: How do you answer?'*\n\n*Then proceed; no tiger in the mountain will be seen.*\n\n*If encountered, stand firm, extend your left hand’s five fingers fully, and leap with all your strength—three upward-downward motions while shouting, ‘#1 *Zhuó!* Tiger, North Dipper Star commands you to depart!’ The tiger will flee. Even when camping, first dig four depressions in the ground as above.\"*\n\n*Another Method:*\nBurn cow or sheep horns—tigers will not dare approach humans.\n\n*Another Method:*\nPound *xiónghuáng* (realgar) and *zǐshí* (purple stone), sew into a pouch, and wear it.*\n\n---\n**Appendix: *Mei Shi’s Prescription***\n**Treatment for Tiger Bites on Humans:**\nDrink alcohol until heavily intoxicated; the hair will be vomited out.\n\n---\n**Treatment for Sudden Rabies from Mad Dog Bites – Fifth Thirty-Fourth Prescription**\n\n**Prescription to Cure Mad Dog Bites:**\nFirst, suck out the foul blood.

Also apply the powder to the wound. Pounding fresh roots and applying them is even better.\n\n*Another Prescription:*\nScrape tiger teeth or tiger bone into powder, take one spoonful. If rabies symptoms appear as from a mad dog, this medicine will cure it.\n\n*Maopeng agrees.*\n\n*\n\n---\n**If the Patient Refuses to Eat the Gruel:**\nIf they refuse to eat the gruel, sprinkle salt near their nose—once they sniff it, coat their nose with the same salt. After licking it, they will then desire to eat. This method is miraculously effective.\n\n---\n**Appendix Prescriptions from *Mei Shi Fang* [Master Mei’s Recipes]:**\n**Treatment for Mad Dog Bites:**\nTake one handful of *táobáipí* (white peach bark), three *shēng* (升) of water, and decoct to one *shēng* for ingestion.\n\n**From *Food Therapy* [食疗]:**\n**Treatment for Dog Bites:**\nPound fresh *xìngrén* (apricots) into a paste and apply it to the wound—this will improve the condition.\n\n---\n**Fifty-Fifth Prescription for Sudden Poisoning and Fox Urine/Thorn Poisoning**\n\n**For Poisonous Wounds from a Horse Biting:**\nIf a horse bites a person, causing a poisonous wound with intense heat and pain—**Prescription for Severe Heat and Pain (#4):**\nExtract blood from a *crown-comb* (rooster’s comb) and drip it onto the wound three times.\nIf the horse is a *mǎ* (驳, dappled) type, use a hen’s blood; if it is a *grass* (草, plain-colored) type, use a rooster’s blood.\n*Maopeng agrees.*\n\n**Another Prescription:**\nMoxibustion over the wound and swelling—this will improve the condition.\nIf the wound remains unhealed for a long time:\nTake the tip of a horse’s whip (two *cùn* long), burn it along with 27 pieces of rat dung, grind into powder, mix with grease, and apply—this is highly effective.\n\n**Another Prescription:**\nApply menstrual blood from a woman to the wound—this is the most effective.\n*Maopeng says:* It is miraculously effective.\nIf a person already has a wound and rides a horse, and the horse’s sweat or hair enters the wound, or if their body is simply exposed to the *horse’s qi* (馬氣), this will cause swelling, pain, and fever. If the poison enters the abdomen, it will kill them.\nBurn the horse’s whip skin, grind into powder, mix with grease, and apply to the wound.\n**Another Prescription:**\nDrink copious amounts of pure alcohol until heavily intoxicated—this will cure them.\n\n**Another Prescription for Poisoning from a Dead Horse’s Bone:**\nIf a person is injured by the bone of a dead horse, and the poison attacks fiercely, threatening death:\nTake the dung from the dead horse’s abdomen and apply it—this will improve the condition.\n*Maopeng agrees.*\n\n**Another Prescription:**\nInsert the hand into a woman’s vagina—this will cure it.\n*Note:* This is forbidden for those with a pregnancy, as it may cause a miscarriage.\n\n---\n**For Fox Urine/Thorn Poisoning Causing Swelling and Pain, Threatening Death:**\nBreak open a chicken’s nest (or coop) and apply it—this will improve the condition.\n**Another Prescription:**\nDip the wound in hot *mùguī* (mulberry leaf ash) juice, then reapply cold juice repeatedly—this will lead to recovery.\n\n**From *The Minor Formulas* (*Xiǎopǐn Fāng*):**\nApply hot wax directly to the wound, or fumigate with smoke until fluid drains—immediate cure follows.\n*This is the urine-soaked wood of a fox, resembling a snake’s nest, beneath which lies fishbone that wounds a person.*\n\n**Additional Prescriptions from *Tújīng*:**\nFor malignant thorns and fox-urine stings:\nPound *púgōngcǎo* (knotweed) roots and stems to extract the white juice, apply liberally—swelling ceases at once.\n*This formula appears in Sun Simiao’s *Thousand-Gold Prescriptions* (*Qīanjīn Fāng*). His preface states:*\n*\"On the fifteenth night of the fifth month of Zhengguan’s fifth year, my left middle finger accidentally brushed against a courtyard tree. By dawn, unbearable pain set in. For ten days, the pain deepened, the wound swelled and darkened like ripe black beans. I recalled an elder’s remedy and applied it. The pain subsided, the wound healed, and within a decade, I recovered fully.

Load into a small bamboo tube and carry it. In an emergency, apply directly to the wound—equally effective against all venomous snakes.\n\n**Alternative Prescription:**\nCrush a black chicken, apply hot to the wound.\n\n*Green snakes, glossy and tree-dwelling, rarely exceed four *chǐ* in length—all called \"green-stripe snakes\"—their bite is fatal.*\n\n**Ge Shi’s Prescription for Venomous Snakebites:**\nDig a pit immediately, bury the wound, and firmly pack the soil above. The venom drains into the earth; within moments, pain eases, and the victim may be unearthed.\n\n**Xu Wang’s Prescription for Snake Venom:**\nPound *dìyòu* (knotweed root) to extract juice, drink it, and apply to the wound.\n\n**Alternative Prescriptions:**\n1. Crush garlic, drink the juice, and apply the residue to the wound.\n2. Apply *zhū ěr gòu* (pig ear wax) or *niú ěr gòu* (cow ear wax) to the wound—effective.\n3. Chew salt, spit onto the wound, then moxibust three times. Rinse, spit again—pain ceases.\n4. Pound *xiè* (onion) and apply.\n5. Burn *wúgǔ* (centipede), powder, and apply to the wound.\n6. Place a jointless bamboo tube over the wound, melt equal parts *là* (wax) and *mì* (honey), and pour into the tube. If honey is unavailable, use wax alone.\n7. Urinate into the wound, then pinch the nose shut for three steps while holding breath. Dig a small pit, pour boiling water onto the soil to form a pill the size of a *wúzi* (Chinese date) seed, swallow it. Seal the wound with a dab of mud—excellent.\n8. Powder *guìxīn* (cinnamon bark) and *guāluó* (trichosanthes fruit) equally, pack tightly into a bamboo tube, and carry it. In a snakebite emergency, apply immediately—effective against all venom. *If the tube is not sealed, the qi dissipates and the remedy fails.*\n\n**General Snake Venom Treatment:**\nMoxibust the wound three to five times—venom cannot spread.\n\n**Snake Venom:**\nPound *guǐzhēncǎo* (devil’s claw) and apply—pain ceases at once.\n\n**Alternative Prescriptions:**\n1. Enclose *jīngyè* (mugwort leaves) in a pouch and press onto the swelling.\n2. Apply *shèwǎng* (musk pouch) to the swelling until blood drains—condition improves.\n3. Crush *hékǒu jiāo* (black peppercorns with leaves), apply—pain stops without fail.\n4.

When juice forms, drip it onto the bite—*instant cure.* This method has saved countless lives. In *Zhēnyuán* 32, two monks traveling south to Dengzhou were both bitten by snakes. This remedy saved them instantly—no further suffering.\n\n---\n**Prescriptions for Unhealed Snake Wounds and Snakebone Injuries (Section 57):**\n**Ge Shi’s Prescriptions:**\nFor any unhealed snakebite, avoid hot foods—ingestion causes flare-ups. Treat as initially prescribed.\n\n**Snakebite Causing Bleeding from All Orifices:**\nCollect *zhūchóng* (horsefly) engorged with cow or horse blood (27 insects), burn, and ingest.\n\n*Above are treatments for severe snakebites, swelling, and deep venomous injuries.*\n**Snakebite with Fractured Fang Embedded in Flesh, Causing Unbearable Pain:**\n\n**Ge Shi’s Prescriptions (Continued):**\n\nFor a snakebite with a fractured fang embedded in the flesh, causing unbearable pain:\nApply the liver of a toad (*xiāmá*) to the wound—it will emerge immediately.\n\nAnother method: First secretly gather *miǎoyīng* (water shield) leaves, pierce them while covering the wound so that no one sees, then place the pierced leaves over the wound’s opening. When the venom reaches the pierced leaves, the fang will break and emerge.\n\n**Prescriptions for Snakebone Injuries and Poisonous Pain:**\n\nFor snakebone injuries causing poisonous, unbearable pain:\nTake *tiějīng* (iron filings) the size of large soybeans and blow them into the wound with a tube. **Same method as above.**\n\nAnother method: Burn a dead rat, grind it into a paste, and apply it to the wound.\n\nFor snakebites where the wound has already closed but lingering venom remains in the flesh, causing persistent itching and pain:\nTake garlic (1 *shēng* of large and 1 *shēng* of small), mix and grind them, then strain the juice with hot water and pour it into the wound. **Same method as above.**\n\nFor cases where a snake coils around a person and refuses to release:\nBathe the person in hot water—this will cause the snake to loosen. Alternatively, make the person urinate upon the snake.\n\nFor a snake entering a person’s mouth and not exiting:\nMoxibustion (*áijiǔ*) on the snake’s tail will cause it to leave. If no fire is available, cut the snake’s tail in a circular motion until the skin is severed, then pull the skin downward—this will force the snake to exit. **Same as in *Xiǎopǐn*.**\n\nDuring the seventh and eighth months (July–August), all snakes’ venom is at its peak and should not be expelled. They bite grasses and trees, causing them to wither and die—a condition called *shéchǐ* (snake-withered wood). This substance harms people more severely than snake venom itself; treat it using the same methods as for snakebites.\n\n**Additional Prescriptions:**\n\nFrom *Guǎnglì Fāng*: For snakebite wounds, wash them with warm *jiǔ* (alcohol) three times daily.\n\nFrom *Shènghuì Fāng*: For a snake entering the mouth or any of the seven orifices, cut the tail of a sow and let its blood drip into the mouth—the snake will leave.\n\n---\n**Prescriptions for Avoiding and Treating All Snakes in Mountainous Regions and General Snake-Related Remedies (Section 58):**\n**Method for Warding Off All Snakes:**\n\n**Prescriptions for Avoiding and Treating All Snakes in Mountainous Regions and General Snake-Related Remedies (Section 58):**\n**Method for Warding Off All Snakes:**\n\nAs before, following Master Yao’s Daoist method for entering mountainous regions.\n\nThough many remedies exist to repel snakes, *wǔdū xiónghuáng* (realgar from Wudu) is supreme. Carry a piece with you, and if you weigh five *liang* (ounces) on your right arm at the elbow, no snake’s venom will dare approach. If others are bitten, grind it and apply it as a remedy. Also, carrying five *wǔgǔ huáng* (realgar pills) is effective. Since these pills contain *wúgǒng* (centipede), the full prescription appears in *Bèijí* (Emergency Remedies). Below is a prohibition: if one does not observe the ritual, the effect will fail.\n\nDo not cross water after a snakebite—doing so will worsen the pain beyond the initial sting. Before crossing, visualize a giant centipede ahead of you, then proceed. If traveling by boat without performing this ritual, it will be fatal.\n\nWhen entering mountains, never speak the word *\"snake.\"* Instead, refer to the bitten as *\"one struck by a snake.\"* This caution is all the more important to observe.\n\n**Method to Repel Snakes:**\nBurn *yángyáng* (ram) horns wherever you go, letting the smoke rise from the ground—the snakes will depart.\n\n**Additional Prescriptions:**\n\nFrom *Guǎnglì Fāng*: To treat snakebites where the victim is near death and to repel snakes,\ngrind equal parts *gānjiāng* (dried ginger) and *xiónghuáng* (realgar), store in a small silk pouch, and tie it on the left arm for men, right for women. The scent of the medicine will repel snakes, and the venom can be applied directly to the wound.\n\n---\n**Prescriptions for Sudden Centipede and Spider Bites (Section 59):**\n\nFrom *Gě Shì’s Prescriptions*: Cut a rooster’s comb and apply its blood to the wound.\n\nAnother method: Seal the wound with salt—it will heal immediately. It is said that if the centipede flees far enough, it will not return.\n\nAnother method: Apply hot saltwater compresses.\n\nAnother method: Chew *dàsuàn* (garlic) or *xiǎosuàn* (small garlic) or *sāngshù bái zhī* (white sap of the mulberry tree) and apply it.\n\nAlso, rub the sole of a hemp sandal on the wound—this is effective.\n\nThough *yúgǒng* (scorpions) bite fiercely, their venom is far lighter than that of bees. The pain is slight and subsides quickly. For spider bites:\n\nGrind *shēng tiě yī* (raw iron armor) with vinegar to make a thick paste and apply it.\n\nAnother method: Mix *wūmá yóu* (black sesame oil) with *húfěn* (barite powder) and apply it. Once dry, reapply until recovery.\n\nApply *yángtáo yè* (wolfberry leaves) to the wound—it will heal instantly.\n\n**Additional Prescriptions for Earthworm, Mole Cricket, Silkworm, and Other Pest Bites:**\n\nFrom *Méi Shī’s Prescriptions*: For centipede bites where the pain does not cease,\nrub the wound with *dútóu suàn* (single-clove garlic).\n\nAnother method, from *Jīngyàn Hòu Fāng*: Burn chicken dung, mix with alcohol, and apply it—this is excellent.\n\nAnother method: Mix chicken dung with vinegar and apply it.\n\nFrom *Shènghuì Fāng*: To treat centipede bites,\nextract juice from a *wōniú* (land snail) and drip it onto the bite.\n\nFrom *Bīngbù Shǒují*: To treat spider bites where the entire body breaks out in sores,\ndrink fine spring wine until intoxicated, then lie still on your back—do not move. The alcohol’s toxicity will force the pests from the flesh, emerging like grains of rice. (Note: Be cautious, as the alcohol’s poison may otherwise harm the body.)\n\nFrom *Tán Shì Xiǎo’ér Fāng*: Take a stalk of *cōng* (green onion), remove the tip, and pierce a hole at the base. Insert an earthworm into the stalk, pinch both ends tightly to prevent escape, and shake vigorously—it will liquefy. Drip the liquid onto the bite for relief.\n\nFrom *Liú Yǔxī’s Chuánxìn Fāng*: To treat injuries from venomous creatures,\ntake one bowl of *dàlán zhī* (great indigo root juice), add *xiónghuáng* (realgar) and *shèxiāng* (musk), grinding them finely. Stir into the juice and apply to the bite. If the venom is severe, also ingest a small amount of the liquid—its efficacy is miraculous.\n\nIn the past, *Zhāng Yuánwài* served as a judge under *Zhāng Yánshǎng* in Sichuan. Suddenly, a striped spider bit his neck. By the next morning, two red marks, as thin as chopsticks, circled his neck from chest to heart meridian. By the second night, his face and head swelled to the size of several bowls, his abdomen followed, and he nearly perished. *Zhāng Xiàng* (the official) valued his recommendation highly and, in gratitude, donated five hundred thousand (cash) from his personal wealth, along with additional family funds numbering hundreds of thousands more, to seek a cure.\n\nSuddenly, a man stepped forward and declared, *\"I can cure him.\"* Zhang Xiang initially doubted him but, wishing to test his method, ordered him to prepare the medicine on the spot. The man replied, *\"I care nothing for the formula—what matters is saving this man’s life.\"* He then took a porcelain bowl of *dàlán* (great indigo) juice, dropped a spider into it, and after a long while, it emerged from the liquid in great distress, barely able to move. He then crushed more *dàlán* juice, added powdered musk, and placed another spider into it—this one died upon immersion. Finally, he took fresh *dàlán* juice, musk, and added *xiónghuáng* (realgar), then dropped yet another spider into the mixture, where it dissolved into water.\n\nZhang Xiang and the others were astonished. They applied the liquid to the bite, and within two days, the swelling completely subsided—though a small sore remained at the wound. Once the scab fell off, the skin healed as before.\n\n**From *Jīngyàn Fāng* (Experiential Prescriptions):**\nTo treat spider bites causing itchy threads across the body—drink one *shēng* (升) of sheep’s milk.\n\nIn the *Zhēnyuán* decade of the 10th year (794 CE), *Cuī Yuànwài* reported from *Zhì* (modern Sichuan): *\"I witnessed a man bitten by a spider, his abdomen swelling like that of a pregnant woman. His family abandoned him, and he begged for food along the road. A monk encountered him and instructed him to drink sheep’s milk. Within days, he recovered.\"*\n\n**Another Prescription:**\nTo treat *qiūyǐn* (earthworm) bites—immerse the body in a concentrated salt bath several times; this will alleviate the condition.\n\nZhang Shào, a military officer from *Zhèxī* (modern Zhejiang), was bitten by such a creature. Its form was vast as a *fēng* (wind demon), causing his eyebrows and beard to fall out. Each night, the earthworms would writhe within his body, emitting sounds. A monk taught him this remedy, and he recovered.\n\n**Another Prescription:**\nTo treat *qiūyǐn* (earthworm) bites, where the victim’s form swells like a *fēng* (wind demon) and their eyebrows and beard fall out—immerse the body in lime water; this is also effective.\n\n**From *Shènghuì Fāng* (Sacred Benevolence Prescriptions):**\nTo treat *gūnyǐ* (mole cricket) bites—apply chicken dung to the wound.\n\n**Another Prescription:**\nTo treat *lónggū* (mole cricket) bites—mix lime with vinegar and apply it.\n\n**From *Guǎnglì Fāng* (Expanded Benefit Prescriptions):**\nTo treat silkworm bites—grind musk finely, mix with honey, and apply; this will cure it.\n\n**From *Qiānjīn Fāng* (Thousand-Gold Prescriptions):**\nTo treat *mòyú* (assassin bug) urine sores—burn *liàn* (melia) tree bark and skin into ash, mix with pig fat, and apply. Alternatively, pound fermented soybeans and apply them. Or mix vinegar with powder and apply. Another method: to treat *mòyú* (assassin bug) urine marks, where the victim develops sores at the point of contact, resembling clusters of millet grains, causing intense pain—if they cluster, the pain spreads like needles beneath the skin, as if stung by a venomous insect, forming small sores in groups like *zhūyú* (Chinese date) seeds, with red edges and white pus at the center. The skin tightens, the body shivers with cold, and a fever rises. In severe cases, the sores merge, spreading across the waist, ribs, and chest.\n\n**Treatment:** Upon first contact, grind rhinoceros horn and apply it to stop the spread.\n\n**From *Bówù Zhì* (Compendium of Curiosities):**\nTo treat *mòyú* (assassin bug) urine marks, which also cause sores where they touch—apply *jīchángcǎo* (chicken gizzard herb) juice; this is effective.\n\n**From *Wàitái Mìyào* (Essentials of the Imperial Library):**\nTo treat *mòyú* (assassin bug) urine sores, which encircle the body and may be fatal—mix swallow’s nest soil with pig fat and sour wine, then apply. Another method: burn deer antlers into powder, mix with sour wine, and apply.\n\n**Money Minister’s Prescription:**\nTo treat *mòyú* (assassin bug) urine sores with yellowish discharge—chew pear leaves and apply; renew as it dries.\n\n**From *Shèngjīn Fāng* (Victorious Gold Prescriptions):**\nTo treat *mòyú* (assassin bug) urine sores, which first resemble scattered millet, then grow as large as beans, eventually swelling like a branded wound, causing extreme pain—immediately apply *cǎotú* (grass tea) or *làchá* (aged tea), mixed with raw oil. The pain ceases instantly; this is miraculous.\n\n**From *Shènghuì Fāng* (Sacred Benevolence Prescriptions):**\nTo treat bites from malevolent insects—apply *zǐcǎo* (purple grass) oil. Alternatively, mix ghee with salt and apply.\n\n**Prescriptions for Sudden *bì* (wasps) Stings (60):**\nApply *Yùhú Wán* (Jade Bottle Pills) or *Wǔgū Wán* (Five Armor Pills) to the sting site; these are found in *Bèijí Wán Sǎn Fāng* (Emergency Pill and Powder Prescriptions). Another method: take soil from beneath eaves, mix with water, and apply.\n\n**Prescriptions for Sudden Bee Stings (61):**\nIf a bee stings—wash the site with human urine. Alternatively, apply the white sap of *gǔshù* (millet tree) or *sāngshù* (mulberry tree); both are effective. Another method: scrape tooth tartar and apply. Also, crush a spider and apply, or boil bee’s nest in water and apply. Burn cow horn into ash, mix with sour wine, and apply. Or cut open a gourd and rub the juice on it. Another method: chew *qīnghāo* (wormwood) and apply.\n\n**Additional Prescriptions from *Qiānjīn Fāng* (Thousand-Gold Prescriptions):**\nTo treat bee stings—grind *lùfēngfáng* (bee’s nest) into powder, mix with pig fat, and apply.\n\n**From *Yángshì Sǎnrǔ* (Yang’s Breastfeeding):**\nBoil bee’s nest in water for washing; this is also effective.\n\n**From *Wàitái Mìyào* (Essentials of the Imperial Library):**\nPound *bóhé* (mint) and apply; this will cure it.\n\n**From *Shènghuì Fāng* (Sacred Benevolence Prescriptions):**\nApply ghee; this will heal it.\n\nShen Cúnzhōng’s *Bǐtán* (Talks on Calligraphy and Miscellany) records: *\"The recluse Liú Tāng lived in seclusion on Wūshān. Once in Qí (modern Shandong), he saw a large rat bound by spider silk, which a wasp stung, causing it to fall to the ground. Soon, its belly swelled as if ready to burst. Slowly, it entered the grass and gnawed on a taro stalk, breaking it slightly. It then rubbed the broken stalk against its wound. After some time, its belly shrank, and it moved lightly as before. Afterward, if anyone was stung by a wasp, they would pound taro stalk and apply it, and the pain would subside.\"*\n\n**Prescriptions for Sudden Scorpion Stings (62):**\nIf a scorpion stings—immerse the site in warm water. Another method: pound *mǎmiáo* (horseweed) and garlic. Or chew dried ginger and apply; this is excellent. Yao’s method: soak the sting in cold water, and the pain will not arise. If the water grows slightly warm, the pain returns—change the water immediately. Another method: soak old cloth in cold water and press it against the sting, changing it several times.\n\n**Newly Effective Prescriptions:**\nTake equal parts of *shùkuíhuā* (hibiscus flower), *shíliúhuā* (pomegranate flower), and *àixīn* (mugwort core), all harvested on the fifth day of the fifth month at noon, dried in the shade, ground together, and mixed with water to apply to the sting—this will instantly alleviate the pain. If these two flowers are unavailable, use *guǐzhēncǎo* (devil’s needle), pound its juice, and apply; this will cure it immediately. Another method: apply yellow cinnabar mixed with vinegar.\n\n**Treatment for Scorpion Stings (Continued)**\n\nAgain, powder fresh *wūtóu* (aconite) and apply with saliva.\nChew dried ginger and spread it on.\n\nAnother method: seal with *shèwàng* (a type of adhesive), then soak with warm wine—it will heal immediately.\n\n**Supplementary Prescriptions:**\nSun Zhēnrén’s *Food Taboos*: Treats scorpion stings.\nTake one *liǎng* (20g) of alum (*fánshí*) and half a *shēng* (180ml) of vinegar, decocting them. Add alum powder to the vinegar and apply to the sting.\n\nAnother, from *Victorious Gold Prescriptions*: A small amount of aconite powder, mixed with head vinegar and applied.\n\nAnother, from *Money Minister’s Pocket Prescriptions*: Take *bànxià* (pinellia), grind with water, and apply—pain stops immediately.\n\nAnother, from *Food Physician’s Mirror*: Grind *fūzi* (processed aconite) with vinegar and apply.\n\nAnother, from *Empirical Prescriptions*: Apply donkey ear wax—it will cure.\n\nTransmitted by Cui Jìshì.\n\nFrom *Broad Benefit Prescriptions*: Treats scorpion stings where pain does not cease.\nApply the white sap of *chǔshù* (paper mulberry)—it will cure immediately.\n\n---\n**Treatment for Internal Hex Poison (Section 63)**\n\n**Ge’s Prescription:** Cures hex-induced bleeding.\nTake three *cùn* (9cm) of *jīyángpí* (goat or sheep skin, or even rotten drumskin), two *liǎng* (40g) each of *lǚlùyè* (lotus leaf), *kǔshēncāo* (soverign vine), *huánglián* (coptis), and *dāngguī* (angelica), seven *shēng* (1.2L) of water, decoct to two *shēng*, and divide into three doses.\nOne variation adds three *liǎng* each of *xījiǎo* (rhinoceros horn) and *shēngmá* (cimicifuga). If *lǚlùgēn* (lotus root) is unavailable, substitute four *liǎng* of *qiàn* (madder root)—this is superior.\n\n**Diagnosing Hex Poison:**\nIf someone raises hex creatures to harm others, the symptoms are:\nInternal hex causes sharp abdominal pain, as if something is gnawing, or vomiting blood. If untreated, it will consume the five *zàng* (viscera)—death follows.\nTo distinguish true hex from false: Have the patient spit into water. If the saliva sinks, it is hex; if it floats, it is not.\n\n*—From Small Brand and Yao’s Methods.*\n\n**Revealing the Hex Practitioner’s Name:**\nTake a small piece of drumskin, burn it to ash, and give it to the patient to drink. The patient will soon call out the hex practitioner’s name. If they speak, the illness will leave.\n\nSometimes, snakes and centipedes combine to create hex poison in food, causing *jū* (abdominal masses). This type kills over years—each requires separate treatment.\n\nAnother method: Place *lǚlùyè* (lotus leaf) secretly under the patient’s outer mat. The patient will call out the hex practitioner’s name.\n\n**Treating Internal Hex Poison with Vomiting or Bleeding:**\nAll follow the *Lán Gān* (Rotten Liver) Prescription.\nTake three *liǎng* each of *qiàn* (madder root) and *lǚlùgēn* (lotus root), finely chopped, decoct with four *shēng* (720ml) of water to two *shēng*, strain, and serve warm in one dose—it will cure immediately.\nThe patient will also call out the hex practitioner’s name.\n*—From Small Brand and Yao’s Methods.*\n\n**Another Prescription:**\nTake one *bādòu* (croton seed), remove its husk, roast, and mix with three *dòu* (soybeans) and a square-inch of ink from the bottom of a pot. Form into three pills. One pill will purge the poison; if ineffective, take another—it will act.\n\n**Another Prescription:**\nTake one *shāng* (30ml) of *kuì* (alkali solution) and mix with pure *kǔjiǔ* (strong liquor). One dose will induce vomiting—it will cure.\n*—Same as Small Brand.*\n\n**Zhī’s Prescription:**\nDecoct one *shēng* (180ml) of *kǔjiǔ* until dissolved, then serve—divinely effective.\n\n**Another Prescription:**\nTake fourteen *qiūyǐn* (earthworms), soak in three *shēng* (540ml) of *kǔjiǔ*. When the worms die, drink only the liquid. Even the dead can be revived.\n\n**Another Prescription:**\nTake one *kǔhuā* (bitter gourd), decoct with two *shēng* (360ml) of water to one *shēng*, and serve. It will induce vomiting immediately—it will cure.\n*—Same as Small Brand.*\n\n**Zhī’s Prescription:**\nDecoct one *shēng* of *kǔjiǔ* until dissolved, then serve—divinely verified.\n\n**Another Prescription:**\nTake three *zàojiá* (soapberry pods), roast, remove the seeds, and soak in five *shēng* (900ml) of wine overnight. Strain and divide into three doses.\n*—Same as Small Brand.*\n\n**Treating Hex Poison in Drink:**\nCauses abdominal rigidity, facial greenish-yellow hue, and exposed bones from *línlù* (urinary dysfunction). Symptoms vary unpredictably.\nTake *tiějīng* (iron filings), pound into powder, sift finely. Separately, pound *wūjīgān* (black chicken liver) and mix. Form into pills the size of *wúzǐ* (schisandra berries). Take three pills; severe cases may require up to ten days, mild cases will cure immediately.\n\n**Alternative Iron Filings Prescription:**\nTake one *jīgān* (pig liver) and one *shēng* (180ml) of honey, decoct until done, divide into twenty doses—secret prescription.\n*—Same as Small Brand.*\n\nZhī’s variation: Can also be made into pills.\n\n**Another Prescription:**\nTake the pith of *zǎomù* (jujube wood), grind to one *hú* (5L), place in a pot with three *cùn* (9cm) of water, decoct to two *dǒu* (20L), strain for clarity, and simmer to five *shēng* (900ml) over low heat. Take one *hé* (10ml) daily on an empty stomach—it will purge hex poison.\n\n*—Same as Small Brand and Yao’s Methods.*\n\n**Another Prescription:**\nTake one *liǎng* (20g) each of *xiónghuáng* (realgar), *dānshā* (cinnabar), and *lílú* (hemlock), pound to powder. In the morning, take with *jǐnghuá shuǐ* (dew water) the size of a knife-blade—it will induce vomiting and expel the hex creatures.\n\n**Another Prescription:**\nDrink one to two *shēng* (180–360ml) of *yǐnyǐngcǎo* (hidden-scented grass, *Platycladus orientalis* sapling) juice.\n*—This grass is *zhègēng* (orange-hued *Platycladus*), commonly eaten.*\n\n**Treating Hex Poison That Has Descended to the Lower Abdomen, Causing Perforation:**\nTake one *chánggǔ* (long-legged toad) with a green back, and one *jīgǔ* (chicken bone). Zhī’s method: Burn one part to ash, mix, and insert deeply into the lower abdomen.\n*—Same as Small Brand. Zhī’s method is frequently verified; Yao’s method agrees.*\n\n**Another Prescription:**\nDrip *zhūdǎn* (pig bile) into the lower abdomen, then pack with cotton deeply inserted.\n\n**Another Prescription:**\n*Wǔhuáng Huáng Wán* (Five-Yellow Pill) —the most essential for treating hex.\n*—Its formula is in the Urgent Conditions section.*\n\nThere is also *natural flying hex*, appearing like ghostly mist—difficult to treat.\nThese varieties respond best to true *xījī* (rhinoceros horn) and *shèxiāng* (musk). Carrying these on one’s person also prevents hex.\n\n**Yao’s Method for Hex-Induced Bleeding Like Chicken Liver, with Stone Residue, and Five *Zàng* (Visceral) Decay—Only the Heart Remains Intact, or the Nose Breaks:**\n**Prescription for the Dying:**\nPowder *zhègēng* (orange-hued *Platycladus*), serve with wine, one *sháo* (10ml) twice daily.\n*—Ge’s Prescription.*\n\nZhī’s Imperial Physicians have transmitted over ten verified prescriptions.\nTake *mǎdōulíng* (Aristolochia) root, pound to powder, serve with water, one square-inch dose. Follow vomiting to expel the poison—extremely effective.\n\nThis substance resembles the shoots of *kèmiàn* (Pueraria), grows along fences, and bears fruit like a tangerine. **For those already afflicted by hex:**\n\nIf one fears having been struck by hex and wishes to take **licorice juice** (*gāncǎo zhī*), it should be **freshly prepared and ingested**, which will induce vomiting and expel the illness.\n\n**For those who habitually take it to prevent hex poisoning,** it should be **roasted and ingested**—once taken internally, it neutralizes the poison without causing vomiting, and the effect is miraculously verified.\n\n**Another prescription:** Roast licorice and swallow the juice in each dose. If hex poisoning from food induces reverse toxicity, it will cause spontaneous vomiting, and the effect is extremely beneficial. **Constantly swallowing the juice** ensures that water will not be contaminated by either medicine or hex poison.\n\n**Additionally, there is the Universal Poison-Dispelling Powder** (*Jiěbǎidú sǎn*), listed in the later *Yàodú* (Medicinal Poisons) section, which also serves as a remedy. **Serve one *hé* (100ml) of mulberry bark juice** (*sāngbáizhī*), and within moments, vomiting and purging will occur, expelling the hex.\n\n**Chairman Shi’s Imperial Physicians** have transmitted over ten verified prescriptions, including these two, both of which have been tested and proven miraculously effective.\n\n**Prescription with Spotted Cat Insects (*bānmāochóng*):**\nTake four **spotted cat insects** (*bānmāochóng*), remove their legs and wings, and roast them. **Use peach bark** (*táopí*) collected on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, remove the black outer layer, and dry it in shade. **Take *dàjí* (Canthium)**—these three ingredients are pounded separately and then sifted. Mix **one part spotted cat insect** (*bānmāochóng*), **two parts peach bark** (*táopí*), and **two parts *dàjí* (Canthium)** into pills the size of jujube kernels, and take them with **clear rice wine** (*mǐ qīngyǐn*). Upon completion, the hex will be expelled through vomiting. If one dose does not work, repeat after ten days, and the condition will improve. **This hex is most prevalent in Hongzhou**—an elderly woman cured one person and received twenty bolts of silk (*jiān*) as payment; her secret prescription could not be passed down, and her descendants faced legal punishment. **Yellow Flower Public** (*Huánghuā Gōngruò*) served as the **Prefect of Military Affairs** (*Dūdú*), and thus the method spread, but the elderly woman no longer received silk. **Shi states:** He has already cured over ten people with this method.\n\n**Another prescription:**\nTake **one square-inch dose of goat-sheep skin** (*yīpí*), **four *liǎng* (120g) of lotus root** (*liánhuā gēn*), **two *liǎng* (60g) each of *kǔcān* (Sophora) and **turmeric** (*huánglián*), and **three *liǎng* (90g) each of *dāngguī* (Angelica), **rhinoceros horn** (*xījǐ*), and **gentian** (*shēngmá*). **Simmer these seven ingredients in nine *shēng* (900ml) of water**, reduce to three *shēng* (300ml), and divide into three doses. The hex will be expelled immediately. **Shi states:** He once administered this to a person, who promptly vomited several *shāng* (60ml) of **wasps** (*fēngxiōng*), and the condition improved right away. **This is Yao’s Imperial Physician’s prescription.**\n\n**Supplementary Prescriptions.**\n\n**《Thousand-Gold Prescriptions》 (《Thousand-Gold Wing Prescriptions》):**\nTo treat **snake-witch poisoning** (*wùdú*), take **one handful of the white bark from the northern shade of *bìngmù* (Betula albosinensis)**), five *cùn* (15 cm) long, simmer in three *shēng* (300 ml) of water until reduced to one *shēng* (100 ml), and take on an empty stomach in divided doses—**the hex will be expelled immediately.**\n\n**Another prescription:**\nFor **snake-witch poisoning with bleeding**, burn **hedgehog skin** (*wèipí*) into ash, grind finely, and take with water in a **one-square-inch dose** (*fāngcùn bǐ*). **The wasps will be vomited out immediately.**\n\n**《Essentials of External Taiyi’s Prescriptions》 (《External Taiyi’s Secret Essentials》):**\nTo **urgently treat snake-witch poisoning**, burn **white goose feathers and droppings** into ash, mix with water, and ingest.\n\n**《Yang’s Lactation Treatises》:**\nTo treat **internal snake-witch poisoning**, take **raw tortoiseshell** (*shēngdàimào*), grind with water into a thick paste, and consume **one bowlful** (*yīzhǎn*). **The condition will resolve itself.**\n\n**《Sacred Benevolent Prescriptions》:**\nTo treat **children afflicted by snake-witch poisoning with bleeding, near death**, extract **Indigo plant** (*qīnglán*) juice and administer **half a small spoonful** (*bàn hé*) repeatedly.\n\n---\n\n**Prescription for Sudden Snake-Witch Poisoning (from *Diseases of the River Poison*)), No. 64**\n**Yao’s Secret Prescription for Snake-Witch Poisoning (中水毒):**\nTake **dried duckweed** (*shuìpíng*), ingest with wine in a **one-square-inch dose** (*fāngcùn bǐ*). **The condition will improve immediately.**\n**Yao further states:** If **fingers are cold**, this is the condition. If **warmness returns**, it is not. **Mild cases** affect only the fingertips, while **severe cases** may extend to the elbows or knees—**if the cold reaches the elbows or knees, the condition is critical.**\n\n**Snake-witch poisoning** (*shuǐdú*), also called **river poisoning** (*zhòngxī*), or **poisoning from water exposure** (*zhòngshǎdōng*), is known in some regions as **Su-hai** (蘇骇切). It resembles **arrow-witch poisoning** (*shègōng*) but lacks the projectile. **Its diagnostic signs:**\nAt the onset, the afflicted feel **chill** (*èhán*), with **slight headache** (*tóuzhù téng*), **eye discomfort** (*mùzhù téng*), **restlessness** (*xīnzhōng fán’ào*), **shivering limbs** (*sìzhī zhènzè*), **stiffened joints** (*gǔjié jiānqiáng*), **tense sinews** (*jīnjí*), and **excessive drowsiness** (*dàn yù shuì*). Symptoms worsen in the evening, with **coldness in the hands**. By the third day, **parasites reappear**, and **ulcers form in the intestines**—**painless, itchless, and without cold sensation**, but visible upon inspection. If untreated, **after six or seven days**, **abscesses rupture in the lower abdomen**, **parasites consume the viscera**, and **fever and toxins surge downward uncontrollably**. By the **eighth or ninth day**, even **skilled physicians cannot cure** the patient. **To diagnose urgently**, examine the lower abdomen for ulcers: **if the ulcer is bright red like fresh meat**, it is **yang-type poisoning** (*yángdú*), the most critical. **If the ulcer resembles the scales of a carp** (*lǐyú chǐ*), it is **yin-type poisoning** (*yīndú*), though slightly less severe. **All cases are fatal unless treated within twenty days.**\n\nTo **confirm snake-witch poisoning**, prepare **several *shēng* (liters) of warm water**, add **five *cùn* (15 cm) of minced garlic** (□), and **do not let it boil excessively**—**excessive heat weakens its effect**. Strain out the residue, adjust the temperature to **lukewarm**, and use it for **immersion therapy**. If **red patches or rashes appear on the body** and **no other symptoms are present**, treat it as another ailment.\n\n**Prescription for Snake-Witch Poisoning:**\nTake **leaves of plum or peach**, crush and extract **three *shēng* (300 ml) of juice**, dilute with a small amount of water, and drink. **Yao states:** For **children who cannot drink**, apply the juice to the **nipples** (*rǔtóu*) and let them ingest it.\n\n**Another prescription:**\nFor **persistent infestation with snake-witch**, crush **common reed** (*chángsī cǎo*), extract **two *shēng* (200 ml) of juice**, and **soak a cotton swab in the juice**, inserting it into the **anus** (*xiōng*) to **guide the parasites downward**. Repeat **three times daily**—**the condition will improve immediately.**\n\n**Another prescription:**\nExtract **Indigo plant** (*lánqīng*) juice, mix with a small amount of water, and **apply thoroughly to the head, face, and body**.\n\n**Another prescription:**\nTake **one handful of pear leaves**, crush until soft, mix with **one cup of wine**, and ingest. **The condition will resolve within three days.**\n\n**Another prescription:**\nTake **roots of *shèméi cǎo* (snakeberry)**, grind into a fine powder, and ingest. **Alternatively, use the juice as a guide downward** or drink **one to two *shēng* (100–200 ml)**.\n\n**In summer, if one must walk in water or bathe:**\nBefore entering, **sprinkle a small amount of the powder into the water**. **This wards off the hex without fear.**\n\n**To prevent arrow-witch poisoning:**\nEven if **water is stored in containers for bathing**, **sprinkle a small amount of the powder into the water**—**this is highly effective.** **Raising white geese or white ducks is also beneficial**, as is **wearing raw rhinoceros horn** (*shēngxījǐ*).\n\n---\n\n**In the eastern regions, such as the counties of Dongxiang and the surrounding mountains, snake-witch poisoning is rampant.**\n**It occurs in spring**, much like **damp-heat disorders** (*shānghán*), and is called **river fever** (*xīwēn*). **Not all cases stem from arrow-witch poisoning**, yet **all suffer from dysentery** (*liànlì*). **The symptoms—chill, fever, restlessness, and pain—persist until death.**\n\n**Prescriptions for snake-witch poisoning** resemble those for **damp-heat disorders** (*shānghán wēnjí*). **Administer the same single-method treatments.**\n**Powdered *wǔjiā* (Acaanthopanax) root**, taken with **wine or fermented water** (*jiāngshuǐ*).\n\n**Mulberry leaf juice** (*jīngyè zhī*) is also effective.\n**These prescriptions are not publicly shared; keep them secret.**\n\n**Another prescription:**\nExtract **juice of *liáocǎo* (a type of rush)**, drink **one to two small spoonfuls** (*yī èr hé*), and **apply it thoroughly to the body**.\n\nTake **one handful of *niúxī* (Achyranthes bidentata) stems**, steep in **one cup of water and wine combined**, strain, and drink the juice **three times daily**. **Use the male *niúxī* (雄牛膝), whose stems are purple.**\n\n**If ulcers form in the lower abdomen and have already ruptured:**\nTake **one *shēng* (100g) of *jùmǐ* (millet) and **five *shēng* (500g) of salt**, boil in **one *dàn* (10 liters) of water** into a gruel, and **sit in it**—**the condition will improve immediately.**\n\n**Another prescription:**\nTake **peach leaves and bark**, crush until soft, steep in water until concentrated, strain, and **sit in the liquid**—**parasites will emerge.**\n\n**Another prescription:**\nBurn **soapberry pods** (*zàojiá*) into ash, wrap in cotton, and **insert to guide the parasites out**—**this is also effective.**\n\nTake **one-square-inch dose of *mǔdān* (Peony)**, ingest **three times daily.**\n\n---\n**Prescription for Sudden Arrow-Witch Poisoning (No. 65):**\nIn the **southern Jiangnan region**, there exists a **poisonous arrow-witch parasite** (*shègōng dúchóng*), also called **short fox** (*duǎnhú*) or **moth** (*é*). It lurks in **mountain streams and water**, and **when people walk or bathe**, this parasite **uses its cross-shaped bony mouthpiece** (*hénɡgǔ jiǎo shè*) to **fire arrows into their shadows**, causing illness. **Its diagnostic signs:**\nAt the onset, symptoms may resemble **damp-heat disorders** (*shānghán*), **poisonous affliction** (*zhòng’è*), **loss of speech**, **chill and fever**, **stiffened limbs** (*sìzhī jūjí*), with **symptoms worsening by evening**. In **severe cases**, by the **third day**, **blood appears between the teeth**, and **if untreated, death follows immediately.**\n\n**There are four types of infestation:**\nUpon inspection, **one type appears as black spots like ink encircled by four edges** (囗囗囗), **resembling needle pricks**. **Another type forms ulcers**, which **persist and eventually perforate**. **A third type rises like a stone** (囗囗囗), and **the fourth type burns like fire**, causing **blistering skin and ulcers**—**this is the most critical**, and **all types are fatal**.\n\n**The parasite thrives in regions where** (囗囗囗).\n**During heavy rains or when people are driven by floods**, it **invades homes and shoots arrows at residents**. **It also preys on geese and ducks** (囗囗). **Raising white geese or white ducks can ward it off**, as can **wearing raw rhinoceros horn** (*shēngxījǐ*).\n\n「If one observes these four types of sores on the body, **immediate treatment is essential**.\n\n**For the first method**, encircle the sore thoroughly, **at a distance of one inch from its edge**, then cauterize (*jiǎ*) the area around it **a hundred times** (*bǎi zhàng*). The sore itself should also be cauterized **a hundred times**—this will cure the ailment.\n\n**Another remedy**: crush and squeeze the stems and leaves of *red amaranth* (*chìxiāng*), **extract its juice for drinking**, and **apply the residue to the sore**. Maoyun states: **\"Administer seven *hè* measures, four or five times daily.\"**\n\n**Yet another remedy**: use *garlic chives* (*húsuàn*), **apply them warm to the sore**, and **moxibustion over the garlic chives a thousand times** (*qiān zhàng*)—this will cure it.\n\n**Another remedy**: take **two white excrement pellets of a rooster** (*bái jīshǐ*), **mix them with honey** (*xiǎo táng*), and **apply the paste to the sore**.\n\n**Another remedy**: combine **seven *hè* measures each of *woodlice* (*shǔfú chóng*) and *fermented broad beans* (*zhǐ*), three *bā* measures of *croton seeds* (*bādòu*), **with the heart removed**, and **melted with pig fat** (*zhūzhī*). **Apply this medicine directly to the sore**—this will cure it.\n\n**Another remedy**: take **one *mǔ* parasite** (*mǔ chóng*)—**a black, bean-sized creature floating and moving on water**—**place it in the mouth**, and the ailment will subside.\n\n**Another remedy**: take **one *zhàojiá* pod** (*zhàojiá*), **preferably two *chǐ* long**, **pound it into pieces**, and **simmer with bitter wine** (*kǔjiǔ*) until it thickens like syrup (*yí*). **Remove the dregs** (*qùzhì*) and **apply it to the painful area**—this will cure it.\n\n**Another remedy**: pound *toothache amaranth* (*mǎchǐxiāng*), **drink its juice in two *shēng* measures**, and **apply the residue to the sore**. **Repeat four or five times daily**—this is highly effective.\n\n**Another remedy**: take **two *liǎng* measures each of *ascending heartvine* (*shēngmá*) and *black bindweed* (*wūxī*), boil with **three *shēng* measures of water**, **reduce to one *shēng* measure**, and **consume it all**. **Apply the residue to the sore**; if no improvement, repeat. **Maoyun’s variation**: add **two *liǎng* measures of rhinoceros horn** (*xījǐ*).\n\n**It states that this parasite** (*sandòu*) **shoots sand at a person’s shadow**, causing illness. **If one wishes to cross water**, first **cast a stone into it**; from the edges, **it fires arrows** (*yùshè*)—**its jaws can flex and extend like a crossbow** (*kǒuxiān*). In winter, **it lies dormant**. **Some have a long horn protruding before the mouth**; when the crossbow’s nock (*nǔyǎn*) aligns with the tip of this horn, **it bends like a raised crossbow**, using **its *qi* as an arrow**, and **propelled by water force**, it strikes people. **If struck**, the person **loses speech**, **and the rest of the symptoms resemble those described by Ge**.\n\n**Remedies for sudden sand-flea poisoning (66th method)**:\nSand-fleas (*shāpí*) are **common in mountainous streams and rivers**; they are **extremely fine and nearly invisible**. When people **enter the water for bathing or washing**, these parasites **attach to the body while submerged**. On **rainy, overcast days**, they also **cling to people in grass**, then **burrow into the skin**.\n\n**Diagnostic signs**:\n**Initially**, the skin **turns bright red**, with **sores resembling small beans, millet grains, or foxtail millet seeds**. **When rubbed**, the reddened area **hurts like a needle prick**. After **three days**, the patient **feels stiff in every joint**, with **pain, cold, heat, and sores developing on the reddened skin**. The parasite **gradually penetrates to the bone**, **leading to death**.\n\n**Preventive measures**:\nAfter bathing in mountain streams, **dry the body with cloth several times**, then **wipe once with an old piece of silk** (*gǔbó*), and **apply powder** (*fěn*) to it.\n\n**Another remedy for sand-flea poisoning**:\nTake **ten slices of raw garlic** (*dàsuàn*), **place them in hot ashes**, and **warm them until hot**. **Cut the garlic and press the hot slices onto the sore**, using all ten slices. Then **apply moxibustion to the sore**, **seven times** (*qī zhàng*)—this is highly effective.\n\n**Another remedy**:\nTake **two *mù* measures of *leopard-spotted amaranth* (*bān māo*)**, roast one measure into a powder**, and **ingest it**. **Burn the other measure** until the smoke dissipates (*lìng juéyān*), then **apply the powdered residue to the sore**—this will cure it. **It is also effective if transmitted by arrows** (*yúshèwǎng*).\n\n**Another remedy**:\nPound **raw musk** (*shèxiāng*) and **raw garlic** (*dàsuàn*) together, **mix with sheep fat** (*yángzhī*), and **carry it in a small tube** (*xiǎo gǔnzi*) while traveling.\n\n**In the eastern regions**, sand-fleas are **found in all waters**. After bathing, **if tiny, hair-like needle pricks** (*rú máomáo zhēn cì*) are felt, **examine closely**—they will be visible. **Use bamboo leaves to scrape and remove them**. In **Lingnan**, when people **first notice this**, they **scrape with *ma* grass leaves** (*máo yè*) or **tea leaves** (*míngyè*). **Even slight skin damage is beneficial**; afterward, **repeatedly apply bitter gourd juice** (*kǔqùcài zhī*) is also effective.\n\n**For deep infestations**, **use a needle to prick and extract the parasites**, **just like scabies mites** (*jiěchóng*). **Hold them under a light** (*yǐng guāng*) to observe their movement—**if extracted**, **apply moxibustion three or four times** (*sān sì zhàng*), **and the parasites will die, curing the illness**.\n\n**If the patient still feels drowsy** (*hūn hūn*), **it indicates the infestation has gone too deep**. **Follow local customs** (*tǔsú*) for remedies, **rubbing out the parasites** (*bìchū*), and **then bathe with various decoctions** (*tāng yào*). **Use one or two *shēng* measures per bath**; **when all the medicine is exhausted**, **repeat with this method and other supplementary ones** (*zá fěn*).\n\n**Sand-flea poisoning and arrow-strike methods** require **urgent rescue**. Within **seven days**, the patient should recover. **If not**, **flying parasites** (*fēichóng*) **will then devour the person’s internal organs**, leading to death. **Be extremely cautious and do not treat lightly**.\n\n**Remedies for sudden overdose or poisoning-induced agitation (67th method)**:\n**If one overdoses on medicine**, feels **agitated and restless** (*fánmèn*), or **is severely poisoned**, leading to **agitation and impending death**, the following remedies apply:\n\n**Scrape a small amount of soil from the eastern wall**, **mix with one or two *shēng* measures of water**, and **drink it**—this is effective.\n\n**Another remedy**: dig a **rectangular pit** (*zuòkàn*) **two *chǐ* square and three *chǐ* deep** beneath the eaves (*wūliù xià*). Pour **seven *shēng* measures of water** into the pit, **stir it with an object** to create a mist (*lìng mò chū*), and **drink one *shēng* measure of the mist**. If the symptoms persist, **repeat the process**.\n\n**Another remedy**: pound *indigo plant* (*lán*), **extract its juice**, and **drink several *shēng* measures**. If no indigo is available, **wash blue silk** (*qīngguàn*) instead, **extract the juice**, and **drink it**—this also works.\n\n**For overdose-induced agitation**:\nDrinking **large amounts of fresh *kudzu root* juice** (*shēnggěrēn zhī*) is **highly effective**. If fresh kudzu is unavailable, **grind dried kudzu into powder**, **mix with water**, and **ingest five *hè* measures**. It can also be **boiled and consumed**.\n\n**Another remedy**: swallow **several raw egg yolks** (*jīzǐhuáng*)—this will cure it. If no improvement, **repeat**.\n\n**For overdose from mineral-based medicines**:\nPowdered **white duck droppings** (*báiyāshǐ*), **mixed with water and ingested**, will cure it.\n\n**Another remedy**: take **three *liǎng* measures of *rhubarb* (*dàhuáng*), two *liǎng* measures of *mirabilite* (*mángxiāo*), and **five *shēng* measures of fresh *Rehmannia root* juice** (*shēngdìhuáng zhī*), **boil until reduced to three *shēng* measures**, and **divide into three doses**. **Once vomiting occurs**, the illness will subside.\n\n**If one suddenly overdoses and vomits uncontrollably**:\nDrinking **one *shēng* measure of newly drawn water** (*xīnjì shuǐ*) will **stop the vomiting**.\n\n**If the overdose involves *croton seeds* (*bādòu*) and diarrhea persists**:\nPowder **dried ginger** (*gānjiāng*) and **turmeric** (*huánglián*), **ingest one *fāngcùn* spoonful**—this will cure it.\n\n**Another remedy**: boil **soybean juice** (*dòuzhī*) to **one *shēng* measure**, and **drink it**—this will cure it.\n\n**Supplementary Remedies (from *Wàitái Mìyào*)**:\n**For overdose or poisoning-induced agitation and impending death**:\nBurn **rhinoceros horn into powder** (*shāoxījǐ mò*), **mix with water**, and **ingest one *fāngcùn* spoonful**.\n\n**Remedies for sudden poisoning from various medicines (68th method)**.\n\n**Remedies for Poisoning by Wild Kochia (*yěgě*) Already Dead**\n\n**First method**: Open the mouth with an object, then take **three chicken eggs** (*jīzǐ*), mix them with saliva, and swallow. In a short while, the wild kochia will be vomited out.\n\n**Another method**: Warm **pork fat** (*zhūzhī*) to **one *shēng* measure**, and drink it.\n\n**Another method**: Take a live duck, cut its head near the mouth, and let its blood drip into the victim’s mouth. If the blood reaches the throat, the person will revive.\n\n**If the mouth cannot be opened**: Take a large bamboo tube (*dàzhúguǎn*), pierce its joints, and insert its head into the victim’s side. Fill the tube with cold water, repeatedly changing the water. In a short while, the mouth will open, and the antidote can be administered.\n\n**For multiple victims**: Apply the bamboo tube to both sides and the navel (*páizhōng*), which is even more effective.\n\n**Another remedy**: Drink **licorice juice** (*gāncǎo zhī*) in large quantities—this is excellent.\n\n**Maopu’s Remedy (for poisoning by various toxins and wild kochia already dead)**:\nMix **fresh urine** (*xīn xiǎobiàn*) with **human feces** (*rénshǐ*), wring out the juice to **one *shēng* measure**, and ingest it all at once. Once it enters the stomach, the person will revive. No other antidote is as effective for resolving all poisons.\n\n**For poisoning by *Datura* (*dān dú*) already dead**:\nPowder **three *hé* measures of licorice** (*gāncǎo*), mix with **three *shēng* measures of water**, and drink.\n\n**If the mouth is clenched shut**: Use a bamboo tube (*zhúguǎn*) to forcefully open the mouth and pour the antidote in.\n\n**For poisoning by *arrowhead* (*shèwǎng*) toxin**:\n**Indigo juice** (*lán zhī*), **large soybean juice** (*dàdòu zhī*), and **dog blood** (*zhūquǎn xuè*)—all can resolve it.\n\n**For poisoning by *wolfberry* (*lángdú*) toxin**:\nUse **indigo juice** (*lán zhī*) to resolve it.\n\n**For poisoning by *wolf’s claw* (*lángkuí*) toxin**:\nUse **wolf’s claw root juice** (*kuí gēn zhī*) to resolve it.\n\n**For poisoning by *Lappula* (*lí lú*) toxin**:\nUse **realgar** (*xiónghuáng*) and **onion juice** (*cōng zhī*)—both can resolve it.\n\n**For poisoning by *Dianthus superbus* (*zhízhú*) toxin**:\nUse **gardenia fruit juice** (*zhīzǐ zhī*) to resolve it.\n\n**For poisoning by *croton seeds* (*bādòu*) toxin**:\n**Turmeric** (*huánglián*), **small soybean juice** (*xiǎodòu zhī*), **mung bean juice** (*huò zhī*), and **large soybean juice** (*dàdòu zhī*)—all can resolve it.\n\n**For poisoning by *realgar* (*xiónghuáng*) toxin**:\nUse **stephania root juice** (*fángjǐ zhī*) to resolve it.\n\n**For poisoning by *Sichuan pepper* (*shǔjiāo*) toxin and *centipede* (*wúgōng*) toxin**:\nBoth toxins can be resolved by **mulberry root juice** (*sāng gēn zhī*) or by boiling **mulberry root** (*sāng gēn*) into juice.\n\n**For poisoning by *alum* (*fán shí*) toxin**:\nUse **large soybean juice** (*dàdòu zhī*) to resolve it.\n\n**For poisoning by *datura* (*yánhuā*) toxin**:\nUse **saposhnikovia root** (*fángfēng*), **licorice** (*gāncǎo*), and **cinnamon** (*guì*)—all can resolve it.\n\n**For poisoning by *Pinellia* (*bànxià*) toxin**:\nUse **fresh ginger juice** (*shēng jiāng zhī*) and **dried ginger** (*gānjiāng*)—both can resolve it.\n\n**For poisoning by *aconite* (*fùzǐ*) and *monkshood* (*wūtóu*) toxins**:\n**Large soybean juice** (*dàdòu zhī*) and **polygala root juice** (*yuǎnzhì zhī*)—both can resolve it.\n\n**For poisoning by *apricot seeds* (*xìngrén*) toxin**:\nUse **indigo fruit juice** (*lánzǐ zhī*) to resolve it.\n\n**If one has ingested metal and is already dead**:\nTake **half a *shēng* measure of chicken feces** (*jīshǐ*), rinse with water to obtain **one *shēng* measure of liquid**, and drink it—**three doses per day**.\n\n**Another method**: Swallow **two *liǎng* measures of mercury** (*shuǐyín*), which will wrap the metal and expel it. For smaller doses, **one *liǎng* measure** is also sufficient.\n\n**Maopu states**: One dose of **one *liǎng* measure**, taken **three times**, while supporting the victim in an upright sitting position, will ensure revival once ingested.\n\n**Another method**: **Duck blood** (*yāxuè*) and **chicken eggs** (*jīzǐ*) can also resolve it.\n\n**The following is a remedy that resolves one type of poison while also addressing many others**:\nTake **licorice** (*gāncǎo*), **chew it finely**, boil into a concentrated decoction, and drink the juice in large quantities. Also, eat **raw onions** (*cōng zhōng tì*) in abundance—both are excellent.\n\n**Another method**: Boil **large soybeans** (*dàdòu*), let them overflow, and drink the juice in large quantities. If no large soybeans are available, **fermented soybeans** (*zhǐ*) are also effective.\n\n**Another method**: **Indigo plant** (*lán qīng*) and **indigo fruit** (*lánzǐ*) can also universally resolve all poisons. Keep some stored for constant use.\n\n**Another secret method**: Boil **waterdropwort** (*jìbì*), strain into a concentrated juice, and drink **one to two *shēng* measures**. If none are available, boil and chew the leaves and swallow. It can also be made into a powder and ingested. This remedy is particularly effective among all antidotes.\n\n**Important note**: For all remedies involving boiling antidote juices, **do not drink them hot**. Poisons worsen when exposed to heat; it is best to drink them **slightly cooled**.\n\n**Note from the Prefect of Lingnan (Maopu)**:\nThe **Lingnan aborigines** (*lǐrén*) often poison people through food. Victims may not immediately notice, but gradually lose their ability to eat. Some may experience **a bloated heart** (*xīn zhòng*), **tightness and suffocation in the back** (*bèi jí mèn*), or **initial coldness resembling malaria** (*chán*). If symptoms are detected early, quickly take a **piece of white silver** (*bái yín*) and hold it in the mouth. After **one night**, if the silver changes color—**green** (*qīngsè*) indicates **indigo poisoning** (*lán yào*), **yellow or red** (*huángchì*) indicates **datura poisoning** (*yánhuā*). If the poisoning progresses further, the eyes may turn **green** (*qīng*) or **yellow/red** (*huángchì*), with **green** (*qīng*) still indicating **indigo poisoning** (*lán yào*) and **yellow/red** (*huángchì*) indicating **mold toxin poisoning** (*jùn yào*).\n\nThe aborigines have their own healers, who fear discovery and often **pretend to use three hundred *liǎng* measures of \"cowhead\" antidote** (*sāniǎo yào*) or **claim three hundred *liǎng* measures of \"silver\" antidote** (*yín yào*). The local leaders, through prolonged acquaintance, know these antidotes are commonly used, though the aborigines do not recognize the *Bencao* (classical pharmacopeia), so they fabricate these names. Their methods are as follows:\n\n**Initial Remedy (for aboriginal poisoning and to stabilize the patient)**:\n**Four *liǎng* measures of fresh ginger** (*shēng jiāng*), **three *liǎng* measures of licorice** (*gāncǎo*), toasted (*zhì*), cut, and decocted with **six *shēng* measures of water** to obtain **two *shēng* measures**. Divide into **three doses** and administer. Once the doses are complete, then search for the specific antidote to treat the poison.\n\n**Antidote Method**:\n**Four *liǎng* measures of *dichroa root* (*chángshān*)**, cut, and **four *qián* measures of white salt** (*bái yán*), decocted with **one *dǒu* measure of water** (*yī dǒu shuǐ*). Soak overnight, preferably on the **last day of the lunar month** (*yuè jìn rì*), or at **five o’clock on the first day of the month** (*yuè yī rì wǔ gèng*). Use an **earthenware pot** (*tǔ fǔ*), boil, and ensure **no slaves, dogs, or chickens** (*núpó jīquǎn*) witness the process. Reduce to **two *shēng* measures**, and **administer two doses in the morning** (*dàn fēn èr fú*). After ingestion, the patient will vomit shortly. Store the vomit in a **copper vessel** (*tóng qì*). If the vomit remains **green** (*qīngsè*) and does not break when held aloft with a stick for **five *chǐ* measures**, the poison remains. After **two days**, administer another dose.\n\n**Prefect Maopu’s Experience**:\nOnce, after drinking alcohol, a patient became poisoned. It took **over a month** before symptoms appeared. The local leader **Liang Fan** (*liáng fán*) prepared **soil-grown *dichroa root* (*tǔ chángshān*)**, calling it a **\"three hundred-head cow\" antidote** (*sāniǎo yào*). The patient ingested it and recovered. Afterward, for **twenty days**, they must avoid toxic foods. Only **cooked rice** (*zhǔ fàn*) can be consumed. Prefect Maopu has successfully treated **nine such cases** in total.\n\n**Another Method**:\n**Ten *liǎng* measures of *yellow vine* (*huáng téng*)**, which is abundant in Lingnan, cut and decocted with **one *dǒu* measure of water** to obtain **two *shēng* measures**. Divide into **three doses**. Once ingested, the internal poison will dissolve. If the poison is from **stephania-based aboriginal toxins** (*fángjǐ lǐrén yào*), regularly ingesting this vine will naturally prevent the poison from taking effect even if consumed.\n\n**Prefect Maopu states**: Regular ingestion of this vine **promotes urination** (*lì xiǎobiàn*). It has also cured many others.\n\n**Another Method**:\n**Ten *liǎng* measures of *Vitex trifolia* (*dōulín téng*)**, also abundant in Lingnan, known to all locals. The aborigines call it **\"three hundred *liǎng* measures of silver\" antidote** (*sānyín yào*). Its leaves are long and slender, with a **three *chǐ* measure creeping vine**. Cut fresh, decoct with **one *dǒu* measure of water** and **two *shēng* measures of wine** (*jiǔ*), to obtain **three *shēng* measures**. Divide into **three doses**. Once ingested, the poison will be expelled through urination. For **ten days**, avoid toxic foods. If symptoms persist, administer another dose, and recovery will follow.\n\n**Further Remedies:**\n\n**Another Method:**\nFour *liǎng* of **dried *Laportea decora* fruit** (*gànlán shí*) and four *liǎng* of **white-flowered vine** (*báihuā téng*), with the finest sourced from **Junzhou**. Avoid gathering wild *Pueraria* (*yěgě*) growing alongside it. Chop finely, decoct with **seven *shēng* of water** and **one *shēng* of wine**, reducing to half. Take on an empty stomach in one dose—brief dizziness is normal.\n\n**Single *Laportea decora* powder**, taken whole, also proves effective.\n\n**For internal toxins:**\nTwo *liǎng* of **creeping *Vitex trifolia* vine** (*dōulín téng*), three *cùn* long, finely shredded. Steep in **three *shēng* of wine** in a sealed jar, then seal tightly and char the edges with husk-fire until three boilings occur. Once cooled, consume warm, ensuring the wine retains its hue. No dietary restrictions apply—results are profound.\n\nIf forced to eat aboriginal food:\nFirst chew and swallow **one *cùn* of roasted licorice root** (*gān cǎo*). If poisoned, vomiting follows—this confirms ingestion. Treat as before.\n\n**Maopu’s Note:** Carry ten licorice slices in a pouch as a preventive measure.\n\n---\n**Supplementary Prescriptions:**\n\n**From *Victorious Gold Prescriptions* (*Shèngjīn Fāng*):**\n**Universal Antidote.** Grind **copper sulfate** (*dǎnzǐ fán*) into powder, mix with glutinous rice paste into pills the size of a rooster’s egg, coating each with **cinnabar** (*zhūshā*). Store with cinnabar to preserve potency. Dissolve one pill in cold water—immediate recovery follows.\n\n**From *Empirical Prescriptions* (*Jīngyàn Fāng*):**\n**For ascending drug poison** (like *Shèngsǎn*). Equal parts **bee’s nest** (*lùfēngfáng*) and licorice, toasted with bran until golden. Remove bran, pulverize. Decoct with **two bowls of water** until reduced to **one bowl (eight *shēng*)**. Drink warm before bed—expels toxins by dawn.\n\n**From *Essentials of the Imperial Library* (*Wàitái Mìyào*):**\n**For post-medication collapse**, where the patient seeks cold ground and refuses heat:\nDecoct **two *liǎng* of *Acanthopanax* bark** (*wǔjiā pí*) in **four *shēng* of water** to **two and a half *shēng***. Administer when symptoms emerge. If unresolved, repeat.\n\n**Sun Simiao’s Commentary:**\nFor **aconite** (*wūtóu*) or **croton seed** (*bādòu*) poisoning, licorice alone stabilizes the stomach. Though **soybeans** (*dàdòu*) are said to neutralize all toxins, licorice proves more effective in **licorice-soybean decoction** (*gāndòu tāng*).\n\n**From *Master Mei’s Prescriptions* (*Méi Shī Fāng*):**\n**Sichuan pepper** (*chùjiāo*) poisoning causes locked jaws, suffocation, or white froth. Decoct **cinnamon juice** (*guì zhī*) or drink **one to two *shēng* of cold water**, then induce vomiting with **thick fermented soybean paste** (*nóng zhī*).\n\n**From *Holy Benevolence Prescriptions* (*Shènghuì Fāng*):**\n**For sulfur poisoning** causing suffocation: Drink **one *hé* of sheep’s blood**—immediate relief.\n\n**Another Method:**\nFor **arrowhead fish poison** (*shèwǎng*) in meat or **leaked salted meat poison** (*lòupú*), take **half a *qián* of crushed abalone shell** (*bèizǐ*), mixed with water—effective. Same for **fermented wheat poison** (*miàn áo*).\n\n**From *Yu Shi’s Secret-Effective Prescriptions* (*Chū Yú Shì Mìxiào Fāng*):**\n**For severe drug poisoning:** Remove skin from **croton seeds** (*bādòu*), avoiding oil extraction. Grind with **sodium sulfate** (*mǎyá xiāo*) in equal parts into a paste. Dissolve **one pea-sized dose** in cold water—recovery follows.\n\n---\n**Prescription LXIX: For Food Poisoning**\n\n**Sichuan pepper poisoning** causes locked jaws, throat obstruction, suffocation, or white froth. Drink **cinnamon juice or cold water (one to two *shēng*)**, or consume **large quantities of garlic**—immediate cure. **Never drink hot liquids—fatal.**\n\nFor **internal pepper poisoning**, chew **garlic or *Isatis tinctoria*** (*jìdí*).\n\n**Misidentified *Heracleum* (*gōuwén*) poisoning** (resembling mustard greens) is lethal:\nDecoct **eight *liǎng* of *Isatis tinctoria*** in **six *shēng* of water** to **three *shēng***. Take **five *hé*** daily, five doses.\n\n**For poisoned vegetables causing delirium or suffocation:**\nBurn **chicken dung** into ash, take **one *fǔchí* dose**. If unresolved, repeat.\n\n**For *Datura* (*zhēnmáng*) poisoning:**\nDecoct licorice juice, mix with crushed *Laportea decora* juice—both effective.\n\n**For bitter gourd (*kǔhuā*) poisoning:**\nBoil **glutinous millet** (*níshú*) into a thick paste, drink **several *shēng***—optimal.\n\n**For horse liver poisoning:**\nConsume **seven pairs of field mouse droppings** (*mǔshǔ fèn*), selecting those with tapered ends, mixed with water. Repeat if unresolved.\n\n**For poisoning from six domestic animals or black beasts.**\n\n**For headscarf filth (幞头垢):**\nTake **one *qián* dose** of ash—*Xiaopin* states: *\"It can revive the dead.\"*\n\n**For fermented soybean poisoning:**\nDrink **several *shēng* of soybean juice**—effective.\n\n**General Warning on Liver Consumption:**\nNever casually consume any liver. **Self-slaughtered meat is especially forbidden**, as consuming raw liver is poisonous.\n\n**For liver poisoning:**\nPound *Aconitum carmichaelii* (附子) into powder, take **one *dāoguī* dose**, three times daily.\n\n**For arrow poison in meat:**\nUse *Indigofera* juice and **soybeans** to neutralize *Strychnos* (射罔) toxicity.\n\n**For spoiled meat poisoning (郁肉):**\nMeat stored in honey vessels overnight, or **salted meat contaminated with thatch-house juice (漏脯)**, is toxic. Burn **human feces** into ash, take **one *fǔchí* dose** in wine.\n\n**Alternative remedy:**\nPound *Allium tuberosum* (薤) juice, drink **two to three *shēng***, taken consecutively with minimal water.\n\n**For millet grain with hidden spoiled meat poisoning:**\nBoil **soybeans** until just simmered, drink **several *shēng* of the broth**—this resolves it and **neutralizes all spoiled meat toxins**.\n\n**For poisoning from self-slaughtered domestic animals:**\nTake **one *fǔchí* dose of *Phellodendron chinense* (黄檗) powder**.

Then, **use a square-inch spoon** to place salt into the mouth and swallow with saliva at the same time—**otherwise, it may dissolve entirely**.\n\nFor **chronic throat ailments** or **long-term use**, take **two to three months**, **first thing in the morning**.\n\nIf vomiting occurs or sudden illness strikes, take **three square-inch spoons**; if vomiting persists, **stop until the illness subsides**, then resume. For **newly afflicted malaria**, it will resolve; for **abdominal pain, distension, or vomiting/diarrhea**, it is also effective.\n\nFor **chronic illness**, if **internal heat** persists, take it **every three to five days**. Increased dosage **induces vomiting or diarrhea**, but diarrhea is harmless. **Long-term use greatly fortifies the spleen and kidney *qi***—no ailment remains untreated, **only regretting that people do not persist**.\n\nThis remedy varies; the *Small Treatise* states:\nFor **sudden abdominal pain from malevolent *qi*, undigested food, cholera, or abdominal distension from poisoning**, **brew as a decoction** and take **one to two *sheng***—**induce vomiting or defecation**; it is effective.\n\n**Ge’s Ever-Ready Medicine**\n**Rhubarb, cinnamon bark, licorice, dried ginger, coptis, pepper, atractylodes, evodia, mugwort, realgar, rhinoceros horn, musk, acorus, ginseng, peony, aconite, croton, pinellia, ephedra, bupleurum, apricot kernel, kudzu root, scutellaria, aconite root, asarum, and donkey-hide gelatin**—these should each be used in **small amounts**.\n\nPreviously, these medicines were **primarily used in Lingnan**, but now they are **listed again for clarity**. All should be **prepared as compound formulas**, **mixed and stored** for ready use—**prioritizing daily sustenance**.\n\n**Decoction Ingredients**\n**Toxicoscordion (Chángshān) 14 liang**, **lacquer (Shǔqī)**, **gypsum 1 catty**, **donkey-hide gelatin 7 liang**, **oyster shell, cinnabar, indigo 7 liang each**, **softshell turtle 3**, **carp scales 1 catty**, **cuttlefish bone**, **calamus fruit 1 *dou***, **Chinese angelica 14 liang**, **areca nut 50**, **dragon bone, red stone pitch, antelope horn 3 each**, **tangerine peel, corydalis**—those without specified weights, **4 liang each**. **Use 1 *sheng* of mirabilite**; it is effective.\n\n**Compound Formulas**\n**Golden Tooth Powder, Jade Bottle Yellow Pill, Three-Medicine Emergency Remedy, Purple Snow, Tangshen Decoction, Yuán Huáng Pill, Malaria-Dispelling Powder, Powdered Medicine, Middle-Reconciling Powder, Dysentery Medicine, Ding-Swelling Medicine**—if **side-annotated**, use as needed.\n\n**Lao Jun’s Divine Clearance Powder**\n**Atractylodes and prepared aconite 2 liang each**, **prepared aconite root, platycodon 2 liang**, **asarum 1 liang**—**pound and sift**. Take **five square-inch spoons daily**. If a household has this, **no illness will spread within a mile**. For travelers, **all encountered pathogenic *qi* will be dispelled**.\n\nIf others fall ill, **take with warm wine, one square-inch spoon**. If the illness lasts **four to five days**, **use three spoons of powder with three *sheng* of water**, boil to **three simmers**, and take **one *sheng***—**induce sweating to recover**.\n\nIt is said to be **constantly used as a preventive powder**.\n\n**Pearl and Musk Powder**\n**Pearl and cassia bark 1 *fēn* each**, **fritillary bulb 3 *fēn***, **parched apricot kernel 2 *fēn***, **egg white parched until yellow-black 3 *fēn***—**pound and sift**. Take **one square-inch spoon on New Year’s Day**. If **frequently ill**, take **on the first and fifteenth of each month**.\n\n**Single-Ingredient Remedy**\n**Take the eastern-facing branch of the southern community’s cypress**, **dry in the sun**, **pulverize**, and take **one square-inch spoon**.\n\n**Yáo’s Account**: **Prepare in advance during epidemics**, named **Cypress Branch Powder**; it is **divinely effective**.\n\n*The Abbreviated Excessive Treatise* states:\n**On the morning of the first day**, **see the cypress in the southern community**, **immediately collect it**.\n\n**Method to Prevent Contagion During Epidemics**\n**Parboil soybeans**, **soak in new rice wine**, and **consume regularly**.\n\n*The Small Treatise*’s **Morning Layer’s *Túsu* Wine Method** prevents **warm disease epidemics**.\n\n**Five-Part Decoction**\n**Rhubarb 5 *fēn***, **Sichuan pepper 5 *fēn***, **atractylodes and cinnamon bark 3 *fēn* each**, **platycodon 4 *fēn***, **aconite root 1 *fēn***, **arrowroot 2 *fēn***—**finely chop**, **store in silk pouches**. On the **last day of the twelfth month at noon**, **suspend in a well until muddy**, **retrieve at dawn before the New Year celebration**, and **place the medicine in wine**—**drink as *Túsu* wine**.\n\n「When facing east, **place the medicine in a well**, it can **ward off the coming year’s ills** and **ensure this disease never recurs in a lifetime**. This is **Hua Tuo’s** method, as **Emperor Wu**’s *Verified Prescriptions* attest—**from minor to severe**, adjust the dosage accordingly. **Even the weakest may take it**, and **one person’s consumption can protect an entire household**. **Take the medicine for three mornings**.\n\n**Another method**: **Preventing Warm Disease with Powdered Medicine** (by **Maopu**).\n**Chuanxiong, Angelica root (Bai zhi), and Peucedanum**—**three equal parts**, sifted and mixed into powder—**apply this powder to the body**, and it will work wonders.\n\n**Appendix: Zhang Zhongjing’s Three-Medicine Emergency Prescription**\n**Powdered form** (by **Si Kong Pei Xiu**): **For treating acute abdominal and thoracic disorders**, including **sudden fatal diseases**, **pounding and sieving** **rhubarb, dried ginger, and croton seeds** (each **1 liang**), mixing with **honey**, and further pounding **a thousand times** into **pea-sized pills**. **Take three pills**, adjusting for age—**the pill form is more potent than the powder**. If **poisonous pathogens invade** and cause **abdominal distension, sudden piercing pain like a dagger, breathlessness, and locked jaws**, or if **the patient collapses and dies suddenly**, **administer warm water or wine** to induce vomiting. If **the medicine does not descend**, **lift the patient’s head** and **force-feed it down the throat**—**immediate relief will follow**. If **the condition persists**, **give another three pills**; **abdominal rumbling and expulsion of toxins** will occur, and the patient will recover. If **the jaws remain locked**, **pry them open** and **administer the medicine by force**—**once it reaches the throat, recovery is certain**.\n\nThe **Cui Family’s *Sea of Prescriptions*** states:\n**Corydalis turtschaninovii (Wei ling xian)** **disperses all pathogenic winds**, **unblocks the twelve meridians**. **Taken in the morning, it takes effect by evening**. It **disperses stagnant cold abscesses and lingering pathogenic fluids**, **harmonizes without draining**—**those who take it will feel lightness in their limbs, warmth in their hands and feet, and relief from colds**. It also **treats frostbite**.\n\nIn **Shangzhou**, a man suffered **heavy feet that could not bear weight** for **ten years without improvement**. Then, a **Silla monk** arrived and said:\n*\"This ailment has a remedy.\"* The man **went into the mountains to seek it**, and after **administering the medicine for several days**, his condition **settled**. The monk **left behind the name of the medicine** before departing.\n\nThis medicine **treats**:\n- **Stroke-related aphasia** in men and women,\n- **Paralysis of limbs**,\n- **Ocular deviation** (eyes squinting),\n- **Wind in tendons and bones**,\n- **Fetal wind** (congenital disorders),\n- **Head wind** (migraine),\n- **Obscure wind** (unseen wind disorders),\n- **Heart wind** (cardiac-related wind),\n- **Wind-induced madness**,\n- **Headaches from injury**,\n- **Nasal congestion and discharge**—**after two doses, injury-related fevers cease**,\n- **Dizziness and vertigo**,\n- **Vitiligo**,\n- **Severe wind disorders**,\n- **Skin itching from wind**,\n- **Toxic heat and poisonous heat**,\n- **Wind rashes**.\n\nIt **deeply treats**:\n- **Chronic fatigue disorders**,\n- **Lumbar and vertebral wind**,\n- **Wrist-wrapping wind** (carpal tunnel-like symptoms),\n- **Stiffness in speech**,\n- **Phlegm accumulation**.\n\nIt **disperses and unblocks the five organs**, treating:\n- **Internal stagnation**,\n- **Phlegm in the chest**,\n- **Lingering bladder abscesses**,\n- **Excessive saliva in the mouth**,\n- **Craving for tea residue**,\n- **Stiffness and numbness in limbs**,\n- **Cold and heat stagnation**,\n- **Pain in the waist and knees**,\n- **Inability to stand for long periods**,\n- **Lingering pathogenic vapors and miasmas**,\n- **Severe aversion to cold with high fever**,\n- **Earaches progressing to abscesses and deafness**,\n- **Eye inflammation from pathogenic winds**,\n- **Constipation in the large and small intestines**—**immediate relief upon ingestion, and appetite returns**.\n\nIt **treats**:\n- **Jaundice**,\n- **Melasma** (dark spots),\n- **Loss of facial color**,\n- **Scrofula (luo li) spreading across the neck**,\n- **Postpartum constipation and lumbar pain**,\n- **Previous trauma or falls**.\n\nIt **treats**:\n- **Heart pain**,\n- **Qi stagnation**,\n- **Diaphragmatic wind**,\n- **Cold pathogenic winds attacking**.\n\nIt **treats kidney wind stagnation**, causing:\n- **Abdominal distension**,\n- **Facial and head edema**,\n- **Toxic heat in the spleen and lungs**,\n- **Phlegm-heat coughing**,\n- **Breathlessness**,\n- **Restlessness and inability to sit still**,\n- **Scaly and pruritic rashes**,\n- **Women with delayed menstruation**,\n- **Prolonged meridian activation with blood and qi surging to the heart**,\n- **Night sweats**,\n- **Stealing sweats** (spontaneous sweating),\n- **Severe body odor**,\n- **Unbearable breath**.\n\n**Diligent consumption of Corydalis turtschaninovii**, combined with **frequent hot water baths throughout the day**, **applying the medicine like saliva in the morning**, or **using it to treat body odor**, **applying it internally and externally**, will **bring about recovery**. For **children without fault**, **have their mother hold the medicine in her mouth and feed it to them**.\n\nIt **treats hemorrhoids, constipation, and dysenteric tenesmus**.\n\n**Preparation of Corydalis turtschaninovii**:\n**Wash and dry-fry** the herb into a powder. **Mix with good wine** to make it slightly moist, **place in a bamboo tube**, and **seal tightly**. **Steam nine times** and **sun-dry into pills**. **Add wine and re-dry**, then **combine with white honey** to form pills the size of **celtis seeds**. **Take twenty to thirty pills per dose**, with **decoction or wine**.\n\n*The Thousand Gold Prescriptions* states:\n**Gather on the fifth day of the fifth month at noon**, **cutting the leaves of the plant growing near the ground**. **Wash, dry, pound, and sift**. **Take one *fēn* (cubic inch) with wine or gruel**, **three times a day and three times at night**. If **the patient vomits or has diarrhea**, **mix with honey into pills**, **calculating the dosage based on the sifted powder**. For **mild wind disorders**, **take twice daily**. If **wind appears on the body**—**as small grains or millet-sized bumps**—**this is wind-toxin erupting**. **Puncture with a needle to drain**, until **yellow fluid emerges and stops**.\n\n**Collect on the fifth day of the fifth month**, **dry in the shade**, and **store in a large container**. **Use sparingly as needed**. This herb **wards off evil**. If **one wishes to prevent illness and disease**, **take it regularly**, and **no fear of harm will remain**. If **the seasonal *qi* is imbalanced**, **the whole household may take it**. If **the stomach is bloated with heat and discomfort**, **take it immediately**.\n\nIt **kills the three parasitic worms**, **treats intestinal hemorrhoids**, and **stimulates appetite**. **Ideal to take for a full year**.\n\n**Can be gathered on the seventh day of the seventh month and the ninth day of the ninth month**.\n\n**Prescription for Livestock (73rd)**:\n**For treating horses with fever, blackened forehead, nasal discharge with pus, and inability to eat water or grass**:\n**Cucumber root, Fritillaria, Platycodon, Scutellaria, Gardenia fruit, Indigo naturalis, Swallowwort flower, Rhubarb, White Aster skin, Scutellaria, and Turmeric**—**each 2 *dang liang*** (heavy ounces). **Coptis and Niter**—**each 4 *dang liang***. **Pound and sift**.

Remedies for Sudden Collapse from Malevolent Qi**\n\nSudden death may occur after prior illness or while resting in bed, with abrupt cessation of breath—all such cases are termed \"death from malevolent qi.\"\n\n**Remedies:**\n**Method 1:** Take the heart of a green onion and insert it into the nostril—left for men, right for women—penetrating seven to eight *cun*. If blood emerges from the eyes, it is auspicious. Bian Que’s method is similar, but later involves blowing into the ears. Ge [Hong] states this refers to blowing into the nose, hence it is listed as a separate method.\n\n**Another Method:** Have two people cover their mouths with cloth and blow into the patient’s ears, alternating when exhausted. Alternatively, use a tube to blow, while lifting the shoulders and leaning the body away—do not hover directly over the deceased.\n\n**Another Method:** Pierce the ears with an onion leaf. If blood emerges from the ears or nose, do not be alarmed; absence of blood makes treatment difficult, while its presence is a favorable sign. At this time, lift the patient’s hands and suddenly release them. After a moment, the deceased will raise their hands to grasp at others, and when they cry out in pain, cease the procedure. For men, pierce the left nostril; for women, the right, inserting seven to eight *cun* or more. Highly effective.",

This aligns with Bian Que’s methods.\n\n**Another Method:** Soak cotton in fine wine, then place it in the deceased’s nostrils, pressing with the hand to force the wine into the nose. Hold their limbs steady to prevent startling them.\n\n**Another Method:** Examine the upper lip’s inner ridge for white spots the size of millet grains, then pierce and remove them with a needle.\n\n**Another Method:** Pour urine over the face several times, and the person will soon speak. This is from Bian Que’s methods.\n\n**Another Method:** Take soap-bean pods the size of large soybeans and blow them into both nostrils; sneezing will restore the flow of *qi*.\n\n**Another Method:** Moxibust the *Chengjiang* point beneath the lower lip’s depression, applying ten cones—highly effective.\n\n**Another Method:** Slit a rooster’s throat and apply its blood to the face; when dry, reapply. Also, encircle the deceased with ashes.\n\n**Another Method:** Use a tube to blow into the lower orifice, having several people take turns. When *qi* flows, the person revives.\n\n**Another Method:** Split open a white dog and press it against the chest. If no white dog is available, a white parrot will also suffice.\n\n**Another Method:** Hold a drake over the deceased’s mouth, sever its head, and let the hot blood drip into the mouth. Simultaneously, use a bamboo tube to blow into the lower orifice, alternating with others when exhausted. When *qi* flows below, the person revives.\n\n**Another Method:** Extract juice from fresh cow or horse dung and pour it into the mouth, ensuring it reaches the throat. If the mouth is clenched, pry it open; if that fails, tap beneath the teeth. If no fresh dung is available, soak dried dung in urine and extract the juice. This is from Bian Que.\n\n**Another Method:** Measure the deceased’s elbow and wrist with a cord—left for men, right for women—then extend the cord from the back down to the base of the spine. Moxibust at this point, then horizontally at half the cord’s length on either side. Apply three cones at each of the three locations, and the person will rise.\n\n**Another Method:** Pinch the *Renzhong* point between the nose and upper lip to rouse them. If unresponsive, roll up the hand and moxibust the crease at the base of the palm, one cone per year of age.\n\n**Another Method:** Moxibust the *Renzhong* point at the base of the nose, applying three cones.\n\n**Another Method:** Moxibust the hairy depression at the base of the big toe’s nail on both feet, applying seven cones. This is Hua Tuo’s method. Some say twenty-one cones.\n\n**Another Method:** Moxibust the navel, applying one hundred cones. Bian Que’s method also states: sever a weasel’s tail, take its blood to drink, and bind the weasel to use as a pillow—the deceased will revive shortly.\n\nAnother version: blow *banxia* powder the size of a soybean into the nostrils.\n\n**Another Method:** Grind *nüqing* into a dose of one *qianbi*, open the mouth, place it in the throat, and administer water or bitter wine—the person will revive immediately.\n\n**Note:** The preceding four methods for reviving sudden death and subsequent *shijue* cases all derive from the transmission of the Wei Minister, as recounted by the Orthodox Unity Perfected One. Bian Que received his methods from Master Changsang; this transmission emerged over twenty years after Ge’s time, so it could not have been known to him. These techniques had long circulated, hence references to the King of Chu or the King of Zhao, with variations in sequence and phrasing.\n\nZhang Zhongjing’s essential formulas include:\n- Pound *xie* (Chinese chive) to extract juice and pour it into the nostrils.\n- Sever a red rooster’s comb, take its blood, and blow it into the nostrils through a tube.\n- Apply the rooster’s comb and blood to the face, encircling it with ashes—the person will rise immediately.\n- Boil pig fat the size of a chicken egg in a liter of bitter wine, then pour it into the throat.\n- Mix fourteen large soybeans with egg white and wine, then swallow them all.\n\nFor sudden death with high fever: boil half a *jin* of alum in three liters of water, then soak the feet up to the ankles.\n\nFor sudden death with closed eyes: straddle a cow facing the deceased, pound *xie* to extract juice and pour it into the ears, and blow soap-bean powder into the nostrils—immediately effective.\n\nFor sudden death with eyes and mouth open and tongue protruding: moxibust fourteen cones behind the fingernails and toenails, then administer Five-Poison pastes or powders containing *badou*.\n\nFor sudden death with limbs flaccid and involuntary voiding: boil a liter of horse dung in seven liters of water, reduce to four liters, and wash the body. Alternatively, take a liter of cow *dong* (thin dung), warm it with wine, and pour it into the mouth.\n\nMoxibust one hundred cones at each of the following points: one *cun* below the heart, three *cun* above the navel, and four *cun* below the navel—the condition will resolve.\n\nFor sudden death in children with vomiting and diarrhea of unknown cause: extract juice from a horse dung pellet and have the child swallow it. If no fresh dung is available, boil dried dung in water to extract the juice.\n\nThe *Emergency Three-Substance Pill* and *Pei’s Paste* are listed under the emergency medicine section; they are particularly effective for sudden death and can be prepared on the spot.\n\nAll cases of sudden death, *zhong’e* (striking by evil), and *shijue* arise from natural *yin-yang* *qi* in heaven, earth, and the human body suddenly becoming obstructed, disconnected, or imbalanced, leading to blockage between upper and lower, or depletion on one side. Even when death seems imminent, revival is possible if the *qi* has not entirely dissipated. At such times, ghosts and spirits may also be involved, so talismans and protective measures can aid recovery.\n\n**Additional Formulas**\nBian Que states: *Zhong’e* and sudden death from ghostly strikes are similar; for those already deceased, these methods may be used in combination.\n- Pound fresh *changpu* (calamus) root to extract juice and pour it in—the person will recover immediately.\n\nFor *shijue* (corpse-like syncope), where the person suddenly dies but the pulse still stirs, listen for faint murmurs in the ears and warmth in the thighs—this method also treats it.\n\nSun Simiao’s formula for sudden death: blow soap-bean powder into the nostrils.\n\n**Second Method for Reviving Sudden Death and *Shijue***\n*Shijue* is a condition where the person suddenly dies but the pulse still stirs, and a faint whistling sound can be heard in the ears, with warmth in the thighs. Even if the whistling is present and the pulse stirs, it is still classified as *shijue*.\n\n**Revival Method:**\nUse a tube to blow forcefully into the left ear three times, then the right ear three times—the person will revive.",

      "translated_text": "**Additional Methods:**\n\nAnother method: Pound dried *u** (calamus) into a piece the size of a jujube pit and place it beneath the tongue.\n\nAnother method: Moxa the philtrum (renzhong) with seven cones, and moxa the perineum one *cun* below the scrotum with one hundred cones. For women, moxa the midpoint between the two breasts. It is also said: Press the philtrum with the fingernail for a long while, or needle the philtrum down to the teeth—the person will revive immediately. These are all methods transmitted by Master Wei from Bian Que’s techniques, as in the case of Prince Zhao’s affliction.\n\nZhang Zhongjing also stated: In *shijue*, the pulse stirs but no breath is present; the qi is obstructed and fails to circulate, hence the person lies still as if dead. Insert powdered *u** (calamus) into both nostrils and blow. Have someone place powdered cinnamon beneath the tongue. It is also said that Bian Que’s method was effective for the King of Chu.\n\nAnother method: Shave the hair from the left temple in a two-*cun* square, burn it to ash, and pour wine down the throat—the person will revive immediately.\n\nAnother method: Measure the arm and wrist with a string—left for men, right for women—then extend the string from the *dazhui* (GV-14) point down along the spine. Moxa the end of the string with fifty cones—the person will revive. This is Bian Que’s secret technique.\n\nAnother method: Apply a hot compress to both flanks. Take soot from the stove the size of a bullet, mix it with fermented water, and administer it. After three or four doses, use a tube to blow into the ears, having three or four people take turns. Alternatively, use a small tube to blow into the nostrils, placing dust from the roof beams the size of a bean inside to ensure it enters.\n\nAnother method: Burn fourteen strands of a white horse’s tail and one white horse’s front hoof, then mix the ashes with vinegar into pills the size of small beans. Open the person’s mouth and administer two pills, then one pill after a short while.\n\nAnother method: Needle *baihui* (GV-20), located five *cun* within the hairline above the nose, inserting the needle three *fen* and reinforcing. Needle the flesh beside the big toe’s nail, three *fen* from the edge, and needle the top of the middle toe three *fen* each. Needle the inner side of the big toe, one leaf of garlic’s width from the tip. Also needle the tip of the styloid process of the ulna on the hand *shaoyin* meridian, one *fen* each.\n\nAnother method: Moxa the *danzhong* (CV-17) point with twenty-eight cones.\n\n**Third Method for Reviving Sudden *Kewu* (Visitation by Malevolent Qi)**\n*Kewu* is a type of *zhong’e* (strike by evil), often contracted at gates or doorways, causing twisting pain, distension, and fullness in the heart and abdomen, with qi surging into the chest.

Soak glutinous rice in water, extract one to two *sheng* of its juice, and administer as a drink. If the mouth is locked shut, force it open with an object.\n\nAnother method: Pound ink, mix with water, and administer one *qianbi* of the solution.\n\nAnother method: Use a bronze or earthenware vessel to hold hot water, placing the vessel on the abdomen. If it cools, remove clothing and press the vessel directly against the skin. If it grows very cold, replace it with hot water. Cease when recovery is achieved.\n\nAnother method: Layer three garments over the abdomen, place a bronze vessel atop the clothing, and gradually burn a small amount of thatch inside the vessel. When the thatch is consumed, add more—do not burn too much at once. Cease when recovery is achieved.\n\nAnother method: Measure the patient’s mouth with a string, then use this length to mark four points around the navel, each one string’s distance away. Moxa each point three times, igniting all four fires simultaneously. This brings relief.\n\nAnother method: Fold the string used to measure the mouth so that one end reaches the area below the heart. Moxa the lower end five times.\n\nAnother method: Mix one *fangcunbi* of cinnabar with three *ge* of honey and administer. If the mouth is locked, force the teeth apart to administer.\n\nBian Que’s method for treating *kewu* includes emergency talismans and a ritual involving *guan* (ablution) decoctions, but as these are not easily practiced by common people, they are not recorded here. This condition corresponds to what is now called *zhong’e* (strike by evil), and it resembles *sudden death by ghostly assault*. Treatments may draw from all these methods.\n\nFor those already dead: Pound fresh *changpu* (calamus) root, extract its juice, and have the patient hold it in the mouth—this brings immediate relief.\n\nFor *kewu* with a corpse-like stillness and inability to speak: Burn two *jiegeng* (platycodon) roots, grind them to powder, and administer.\n\nAnother method: Grind equal parts *xixin* (asarum) and *gui* (cinnamon) into powder and place it in the mouth.\n\nAnother method: Mix rooster’s comb blood with cinnabar, form into pellets the size of small beans, and place three or four into the mouth. This brings relief.\n\nIf the mouth is suddenly locked and cannot be opened: Grind raw *fuzi* (aconite) into powder, place it in a tube, and blow it beneath the tongue—this brings immediate relief.\n\nAnother method: Mix human blood with cinnabar, form into two pellets the size of *wutong* seeds, force the teeth apart, and place them into the throat to swallow.\n\nHua Tuo’s method for sudden *zhong’e* with shortness of breath and near-death: Moxa the area behind the toenail on the big toes, where the hairs converge, fourteen times on each foot. This brings immediate relief. If not, moxa fourteen more times. The previous method for reviving sudden death (thirty-seven moxa cones) has already been described.\n\nAnother essential formula from Zhang Zhongjing: Four *liang* of *mahuang* (ephedra), seventy *xingren* (apricot kernels), and one *liang* of *gancao* (licorice). Boil in eight *sheng* of water, reduce to three *sheng*, and administer in divided doses to swallow. This universally treats all types of *ganwu* (affliction by noxious qi).\n\nAnother method: One handful of *jiugen* (leek roots), twenty *wumei* (mume plums), and half a *jin* of *zhuyu* (evodia). Boil in one *dou* of water, then place the patient’s comb into the decoction and bring to a boil three times. If the comb floats, the patient will live; if it sinks, they will die. Reduce the decoction to three *sheng* and administer as a drink.\n\nAnother method: One *liang* of *gui* (cinnamon), three *liang* of *shengjiang* (fresh ginger), fourteen *zhizi* (gardenia), and five *ge* of *chi* (fermented soybeans). Pound the ingredients, mix with three *sheng* of wine, warm slightly, strain, and administer in one dose to bring relief.\n\n*Feishi Zouma Tang* (Flying Corpse Galloping Horse Decoction): Two *badou* (croton seeds) and two *xingren* (apricot kernels). Wrap in silk, crush, and place in two *ge* of hot water. Knead with the fingers to extract the juice, then administer immediately. Drink within the time it takes to cook rice—this brings relief. Adjust the dosage as needed to universally treat all types of *feishi* (flying corpse) and *guiji* (ghostly assault).\n\nOther pills and powders are recorded in the *Emergency Remedies* section.\n\n*Ke* (visitation) refers to an external presence, and *wu* (affliction) means to offend—thus, *kewu* describes an external qi offending a person. This is generally a malign qi. Though many recover with treatment, it is a qi borne of ghostly or toxic influences. When encountered suddenly, its power wanes, so it cannot be treated like natural malign qi. Once it enters the body and invades the organs, channels, and collaterals, even after recovery, further treatment is advisable to dispel its lingering influence. Otherwise, it may recur and eventually cause harm, leading to periodic outbreaks.\n\n**Additional Formulas**",

Also swallow musk the size of a soybean—excellent.\n\nFrom the *Guang Li Fang*:\nFor sudden *kewu* near death, finely grind one *qian* of musk, mix with two *ge* of vinegar, and administer—immediate recovery.\n\n**Fourth: Formulas for Sudden Ghostly Assault**\nGhostly assault strikes without warning, as if pierced by human force. The chest, flanks, and abdomen twist with sharp, unbearable pain, unrelieved by pressure. Some immediately vomit blood, or bleed from the nose, or pass blood.\n\nAlso called *guipai* (ghostly thrust).\n\n**Formulas for Treatment:**\nMoxa one *zhuang* at *renzong* (the philtrum below the nose)—instant cure. If unresolved, add several more *zhuang*.\n\nAnother formula: Grind equal parts *shengma* (cimicifuga), *duhuo* (angelica), and *mugui* (cassia bark) into powder, and take one *fangcunbi* with wine—immediate cure.\n\nAnother formula: Moxa two *zhuang* one *cun* below the navel.\n\nAnother formula: Moxa seven *zhuang* one *cun* above the navel, and at the white flesh of both heels—recovery follows.\n\nAnother formula: Steep three pieces of processed mugwort the size of a duck’s egg in five *sheng* of water, boil down to two *sheng*, and consume in one dose.\n\nAnother formula: Stir one *sheng* of salt into two *sheng* of water and drink. Also spray cold water on the face, but do not induce vomiting immediately—wait until vomiting occurs, then recovery follows.\n\nAnother formula: Stir a pinch of powder into water and drink.\n\nAnother formula: Blow pure wine into both nostrils.\n\nAnother formula: Sever the head of a white dog, take one *sheng* of its hot blood, and drink.\n\nAnother formula: Drip chicken crown blood into the mouth, allowing one swallow. Then split the chicken and press it against the chest until cold, discarding it by the roadside. A black hen is even more effective.\n\nAnother formula: Boil one *sheng* of calf dung in three *sheng* of wine and consume. An adult ox may also be used.\n\nAnother formula: Burn three *cun* of a scabbard, grind to powder, and drink with water.\n\nAnother formula: Burn rat droppings, grind to powder the size of millet grains, and take with a little water if unable to drink, placing it in the mouth.\n\nOther pills and powders are recorded in the *Emergency Remedies* section.\n\nNow, shamans have truly witnessed people suddenly seized by ghosts or spirits—whether disrupting their ranks, colliding with them, or when their spirit is scattered and weak, or burdened by past transgressions. The mild escape, but the severe often die, much like the tales of Yan Jian—this is no fiction. Even if death is fated, one cannot but attempt rescue.\n\n**Additional Formulas**\nFrom the *Gu Jin Lu Yan*:\nFor demonic possession or *maogui* (cat ghost) illness where the person refuses to name the ghost, pound deer antler shavings into powder, take one *fangcunbi* with water—they will then speak the truth.\n\n**Fifth: Formulas for Sudden Nightmare Unawareness**\nIf one suddenly falls into a stupor while lying down, do not shine fire upon them—fire will kill them. Instead, bite their heel or the side of the big toe’s nail, and repeatedly spit on their face to revive them.\n\n**Other Formulas for Treatment:**\nGrind *zaojiao* (Chinese honey locust) into powder and blow into both nostrils with a tube—they will awaken. This may still work after three or four days.\n\nAnother formula: Insert a hair into the nostril—left for men, right for women—twisting it inward.\n\nAnother formula: Blow into both ears with a reed tube. Also take fourteen strands of the patient’s hair, twist into a cord, and insert into the nostrils. Cut a rooster’s crown for blood, and blow it into the throat with the tube—highly effective.\n\nAnother formula: Grind yellow earth from beneath the stove into powder and blow into the nostrils with a tube.\n\nGrind *xionghuang* (realgar) and *gui* (cassia) into powder and blow into the nostrils—also excellent.\n\nAnother formula: Apply well-bottom mud to the eyes, then have the person hang their head over the well. Call their name, and they will awaken.\n\nAnother formula: Pound *jiu* (leek) for juice and blow into the nostrils. In winter, dig up the roots, extract juice, and pour into the mouth.\n\nAnother formula: Drink salt water, adjusting the amount as needed.\n\nAnother formula: Place the person on the ground, draw a line on the earth with a sharp knife from the shoulder—left for men, right for women—encircling the face. Press the knife’s tip into the patient’s nose, entering one *fen*, and hold firmly without moving. The person will speak as if possessed by ghosts or spirits, begging for mercy. Ask: “Who are you? Why have you come?” They will plead to leave. Then erase the drawn line with your finger a few *cun* from the shoulder, allowing them to depart. Do not omit these questions.\n\nAnother formula: Cover the patient’s face with an earthen steamer, then have someone swiftly smash it—they will awaken.\n\nAnother formula: Hold an ox or horse hoof over the person in a stupor—also effective for sudden death. A black ox is especially good.\n\nAnother formula: Grind *xionghuang* (realgar) finely, sift, and blow into both nostrils with a tube. *Gui* (cassia) is also excellent.\n\nAnother formula: Grind *wanpu* (calamus) into powder, blow into both nostrils, and place some beneath the tongue.\n\nAnother formula: Bind the patient’s elbow with the left cord of a steamer, left for men and right for women. Tightly twist the remaining length, and also bind the feet with hemp. Then inquire about the cause, and loosen the bindings as instructed. Have one person sit at the head to guard, while another calls the patient’s name from inside the door. The seated person responds: “Yes, they are here.” The patient will then revive.\n\nFor sudden stupor without awareness, moxa twenty-one *zhuang* at the *jumao* (hairy spot) beneath the big toe.\n\nFor those prone to nightmares and evil dreams: Place ash from extinguished fire in the shoes and under the pillow.\n\nAnother formula: Wear *xionghuang* (realgar)—left for men, right for women.\n\nAnother formula: Moxa twenty *zhuang* at the *jumao* (hairy spot) above both big toes.\n\nAnother formula: Place a piece of genuine musk by the head.\n\nAnother formula: A tiger-head pillow is especially good.\n\n**Formulas to Ward Off Nightmares:**\nCarry *xionghuang* (realgar) the size of a jujube pit under the left armpit—this ensures lifelong freedom from nightmares.\n\nAnother formula: Place a square of genuine red felt beneath the pillow.",

Over months and years, it gradually weakens the patient, leading to death, and after death, it spreads to others, even to the point of annihilating entire households. Upon recognizing these symptoms, one should treat it urgently.\n\n**Formula:**\nTake white mulberry bark, dry in the sun, and burn to ash, yielding about two *dou*. Place in a steamer, steam until the vapor permeates, then remove. Pour three to four *dou* of boiling water from a cauldron over the ash, strain, and repeat three times until the liquid is extremely concentrated. Allow to settle, then take two *dou* of the clear liquid to soak two *dou* of red adzuki beans overnight. Dry in the sun, then soak again in the ash liquid until exhausted. Steam the beans until fully cooked, then prepare a broth with mutton or venison and serve with the beans. Begin by consuming one to two *sheng* until satiated. Mild cases resolve with three to four *dou*; severe cases require seven to eight *dou*. As the disease departs, the body will feel a creeping itch. If the root is not fully eradicated, repeat the treatment. Divinely efficacious.\n\n**Another formula:**\nCrush fifty peach kernels, boil in water to produce four *sheng* of liquid, and consume in one draught to induce vomiting. If the disease is not fully expelled, repeat after two or three days. If no vomiting occurs, it is not an infusion.\n\n**Another formula:**\nGrind together one *liang* of *Asarum forbesii*, one *liang* of stem, half a *liang* of ginseng, fourteen *Trichosanthes kirilowii* seeds, six *zhu* of *Usnea*, and fourteen red adzuki beans into powder. Consume one square *cun* spoonful with warm water at dawn; by evening, one will vomit a hundred kinds of substances. If not fully expelled, consume again later.\n\n**Another formula:**\nDry one otter liver in the shade, pound into powder, and consume one square *cun* spoonful with water, three times daily. If the condition does not resolve, repeat with another liver. Yao states it is divinely efficacious.\n\n**Another formula:**\nGrind together one *liang* each of cinnabar and realgar, half a *liang* each of *Podophyllum* and *Aconitum* (or *Stellera*), forty croton seeds (with hearts and skins removed), and two centipedes. Mix with honey to form pills the size of small beans. If the condition does not resolve, consume two pills. This remedy may also be carried for long-term use.",

This last condition has its own treatment, described later as a compress.\n\nAll Five Corpses arise from corpse-demons within the body that draw in harm; though the classical arts contain methods to dispel them, these are rarely practiced in the world today. Here, I have compiled the essential techniques from the classics to remedy this neglect.\n\n**Formula:**",

Another remedy: grind cinnamon into powder and take a three-*cunbi* dose. Vinegar, ginseng, and high-quality dried ginger are also effective. Another remedy: boil two *sheng* of non-glutinous rice in six *sheng* of water for fourteen boilings, then drink. Another remedy: take a large handful of salt, swallow with plenty of water, and induce vomiting to cure.

Another remedy: prepare a black hen as for eating, finely chop seven *jin* of fresh *dihuang*, steam together in a steamer with a copper vessel to collect the juice, and drink from dawn to dusk. This will expel all cold accumulations; then gradually consume white congee. For chronic hernia, take three doses.\n\n**Additional Remedies**\nFrom *Boji Fang*: For disharmony of cold and heat *qi* with loss of appetite or stabbing abdominal pain, grind equal parts *shanzhizi* and *chuanwutou* into powder, form into *wutongzi*-sized pills with wine paste, and take fifteen pills with stir-fried ginger decoction.

Sudden cases are rare and usually arise as complications of other illnesses—such as from unresolved cold damage, post-*huoluan* depletion and dryness, stagnation after consuming tonics for taxation damage, exposure to cold or heat evil, dietary poisoning, or improper medication.

      "translated_text": "**Volume Two of Ge Xianweng’s Handbook of Emergency Prescriptions**\n**Chapter Twelve: Remedies for Sudden Cholera and Other Acute Conditions**\n\nCholera generally arises from dietary causes—consuming raw or cold foods mixed with rich, greasy fare, wine, or raw fish—while exposed to wind, damp, or drafts, wearing thin clothing, sitting in the open, or sleeping uncovered. At the first onset, ensure warmth: spread hot coals beneath the patient’s bedding and reduce heat if excessive. Alternatively, steam quilts or clothing, replacing cold layers with warm ones. Another method is to heat the ground, douse it with hot water, cover with a thin cloth, lay a mat over it, and envelop the patient thickly. One may also fill a jar with scalding water to soak the feet up to the knees, or place a copper vessel of hot water on the abdomen, padding it with clothing and replacing it when cool. A heated iron may likewise be applied to the abdomen.\n\nIf these measures fail to induce recovery, proceed immediately to moxibustion. Follow the prescribed sequence precisely; do not apply moxa haphazardly. Treat only the afflicted area—never preemptively moxa where no illness exists. Though moxibustion may not yield instant relief, it ensures the patient will not die. Do not discontinue treatment merely because improvement is not immediate.\n\nFor cholera, use moxa cones of moderate size, with a modest number of applications. The standard recommends seven cones, though forty or fifty may be applied without harm. Revival often follows the first application.\n\nWhile classical formulas such as *Li Zhong* pills, *Hou Po* (magnolia bark) with fermented soybean decoction, and *Ban Xia* (pinellia) decoctions to unblock the pulse are effective, the ingredients may be difficult to procure. Here, I outline reliable moxibustion techniques and simple, proven remedies—no less effective than costly medicines. Even in cases where death appears imminent, moxibustion may still revive the patient.\n\nOther remedies, such as *Li Zhong* pills and *Si Shun* or *Hou Po* decoctions, should be prepared in advance each autumn for emergency use.\n\n**Moxibustion for Sudden Cholera:**\n- If abdominal pain precedes symptoms, apply fourteen cones to *Tai Cang* (Great Granary), located four *cun* below the heart’s xiphoid process.\n- If watery diarrhea occurs first, apply fourteen cones one *cun* beside the navel—left for men, right for women. In severe cases, increase to thirty or forty cones. This point is *Da Chang Mu* (Large Intestine Alarm Point), particularly suited for purging.\n- If vomiting precedes symptoms, apply fourteen cones two *cun* below the heart. This also treats unremitting diarrhea.\n- For counterflow qi, apply fifty cones to *Ju Que* (Great Gateway), one *cun* below the tip of the xiphoid process.\n- For cold reversal in the extremities, apply seven cones to each *San Yin Jiao* (Three Yin Intersection), located three *cun* above the inner ankle’s prominence. Increase if no improvement.\n- For muscle spasms, apply six or seven cones to the sole’s depression beneath the big toe (*Yong Quan*, Gushing Spring). Alternatively, apply one cone to the midpoint beneath the big toe for miraculous effect, or seven cones to the nail’s edge on the big toe.\n- For spasms entering the abdomen with pain, have four assistants hold the patient’s limbs while applying fourteen cones two *cun* left of the navel. Also moxa the large tendon of the thigh, one *cun* from the groin.\n- For hiccups, apply seven cones to the first crease of the wrist (*Xin Zhu*, Heart Governor), aligned with the middle finger.\n- For unremitting diarrhea, apply seven cones to *Da Du* (Great Metropolis), at the inner side of the big toe’s base joint, on the border of white flesh.\n- For dry heaves, apply seven cones to *Wen Shi* (Interrogator), three *cun* behind the wrist between the tendons. If reversal and vomiting are extreme, moxibustion here restores flow. *The Lesser Compendium* states this revives the dead.\n- For simultaneous vomiting and diarrhea, apply seven cones to the outer edge of each nipple, near the abdomen’s white flesh.

Alternatively, consume the *Hualu Tusan* or *Kushen Longdan San*.\n\nFor cases lasting five or six days or more:\nPrepare a large quantity of green bamboo sap, simmer briefly to reduce slightly, and drink frequently; cover thickly to induce sweating.\n\nAnother formula:\nBoil half a *liang* each of rhubarb, coptis, phellodendron, and gardenia with eight *sheng* of water for six or seven bubblings; add one *sheng* of fermented soybeans and seven stalks of scallion, then boil to yield three *sheng*. Divide and consume—suitable for both elderly and young.\n\nAnother formula:\nBoil two *liang* of flavescent sophora and two *liang* of scutellaria with half a *jin* of fresh rehmannia in eight *sheng* of water to yield one *sheng*; divide into two doses. If vomiting or purging of toxins occurs, recovery follows.\n\nFor cases lasting six or seven days with extreme heat, heart vexation, delirious speech, visions of ghosts, and a desire to rise and flee:\nBoil three *sheng* of dried evodia fruit with two *sheng* of water to yield one *sheng*; strain, and consume at a moderate temperature. Sweating will bring recovery. This formula is highly reliable and must be used—an esoteric method.\n\nAnother formula:\nTake one *sheng* of large earthworms, split and remove the contents, then boil in human urine until done; strain and consume. Alternatively, extract fresh juice or decoct in water—both are effective.\n\nAnother method:\nExtract juice from feces, consuming several *ge* to one or two *sheng*—this is called *Huanglong Tang* (\"Yellow Dragon Decoction\"), with aged feces being best.\n\nAnother formula:\nTake a white dog, split it open from the back to collect its blood—more is better. While still warm, apply it thickly to the chest; remove once cooled. This revives those on the verge of death. If no white dog is available, any pure-colored dog may be used.\n\nAnother formula:\nRemove the black outer layer of paulownia bark, tear it into fine strips, and cut into four-*cun* lengths to form bundles. Boil with five *ge* of wine and one *sheng* of water to yield one *sheng*; strain and consume in one dose. Vomiting or purging of several *sheng* of green-yellow fluid will bring recovery.\n\nAnother formula:\nMix three chicken eggs, a *fangcunbi* of mirabilite, and three *ge* of wine; stir until the mirabilite dissolves completely, then consume.\n\nAnother formula:\nBoil three *liang* of coptis, two *liang* each of phellodendron and scutellaria, and fourteen gardenia fruits in six *sheng* of water to yield two *sheng*; divide into two doses. This treats vexation, vomiting, and insomnia.\n\nFor those on the verge of death from epidemic qi:\nBoil a thousand coins’ worth of coffin wood to make a decoction.\n\nAnother method:\nSteep one *liang* of flavescent sophora (crushed) in two and a half *sheng* of wine—older formulas use wine to decoct flavescent sophora, reducing it to one and a half *sheng*. Strain, adjust to a moderate temperature, and consume entirely. The patient will experience intense cold and vomit toxins resembling molten glue, then recover.\n\nAnother formula:\nBoil one hundred coins in one *dou* of water to yield eight *sheng*; grind a *dangmenzi*-sized piece of musk into powder and administer gradually until finished. This may induce sweating or vomiting.\n\nFor warm toxin with maculae and severe epidemics difficult to cure—*Heigao* (\"Black Paste\"):\nChop half a *jin* of fresh rehmannia, combine with one *sheng* of fine fermented soybeans and two *jin* of lard, and boil for five or six bubblings until reduced by one-third. Strain, then add powdered realgar and musk the size of large soybeans; mix well and consume entirely. Toxins will exit through the skin, bringing recovery.\n\nAnother formula:\nUse a live toad, split its abdomen to remove the intestines, then pound and consume raw. Dried toads from the fifth day of the fifth month, burned to ash, are also effective.\n\n*Heinu Wan* (\"Black Slave Pill\"), as recorded in *Hu Qia* and *Xiaopin*, is also called *Shuijie Wan* (\"Water-Resolving Pill\"). Another version adds one *liang* of charred wheat husks, naming it *Mainu Wan* (\"Wheat Slave Pill\"). The annotations are consistent.\n\nIngredients:\nTwo *liang* each of ephedra and rhubarb, one *liang* each of scutellaria and mirabilite, one *liang* of pot-bottom soot, two *liang* of stove chimney soot, and two *liang* of roof beam dust. Pound the ingredients, mix with honey, and form into pills the size of a bullet. Grind one pill in five *ge* of freshly drawn water and consume in one dose. If thirsty, drink water; soon, a chilling sensation will arise, followed by sweating and resolution. If no effect is observed after the time it takes for the sun to move five *chi*, consume another pill. This treats cases of five or six days with intense chest heat and lockjaw, known as \"ruined illness,\" which is otherwise incurable—use this *Heinu Wan*.\n\nAnother formula:\nBoil four *liang* of indigo plant, two *liang* each of licorice and donkey-hide gelatin, and eight *ge* of fermented soybeans in one *dou* of water. First boil the indigo and licorice to yield three and a half *sheng*; strain, add the fermented soybeans, and boil for three bubblings. Strain again, then add the gelatin and divide into four doses. Consume entirely, then prepare another batch. This is highly effective for cases lasting seven or eight days with unresolved heat after sweating or vomiting, or with intense heat.\n\nAnother formula:\nPound two *liang* of rhubarb, two *liang* of licorice, two *liang* of ephedra, thirty apricot kernels, five *ge* of mirabilite, one *liang* of scutellaria, and twenty stir-fried croton seeds; mix with honey to form pills the size of soybeans. Consume three pills to purge toxins. If purging does not cease, use rice water to stop it. Household members attending the patient may also consume this first to purge, preventing contagion. These pills may be prepared in advance.\n\nFor resolving muscle layer (heat) on the first or second day:\nBoil one *liang* each of ephedra, licorice, cimicifuga, peony, and gypsum, thirty apricot kernels, and three cowrie shells in three *sheng* of water to yield one *sheng*; consume in one dose. Cover to induce sweating, then recovery follows. Consume fermented soybean porridge afterward to replenish deficiency.\n\nAnother formula:\nBoil two *liang* of ephedra, one *liang* each of scutellaria and cinnamon, and three *liang* of fresh ginger in six *sheng* of water to yield two *sheng*; divide into four doses.\n\nAlternatively, consume *Gegen Jieji Tang* (\"Pueraria Muscle-Resolving Decoction\"):\nBoil four *liang* of pueraria root, two *liang* of peony, one *liang* each of ephedra, indigo plant, licorice, scutellaria, gypsum, and cinnamon, and four jujubes in five *sheng* of water to yield two and a half *sheng*. Strain and divide into three doses to induce mild sweating.",

      "translated_text": "For cases persisting from three to seven or eight days without resolution, *Xiao Chaihu Tang* (\"Minor Bupleurum Decoction\") may be administered:\nBoil eight *liang* of bupleurum, three *liang* each of ginseng, licorice, and scutellaria, eight *liang* of fresh ginger (or three *liang* of dried ginger if unavailable), five *liang* of pinellia (washed in hot water), and twelve jujubes in nine *sheng* of water to yield two and a half *sheng*; divide into three doses. Cover lightly to induce sweating for half a day, and recovery should follow shortly. If improvement is not observed, prepare another dose.\n\nIf heat and excess persist despite sweating, accompanied by fullness, pain, vexation, and delirious speech, *Da Chaihu Tang* (\"Major Bupleurum Decoction\") may be administered:\nBoil half a *jin* of bupleurum, two *liang* of rhubarb, three *liang* of scutellaria, two *liang* of peony, ten pieces of unripe bitter orange, five *liang* of pinellia (washed), five *liang* of fresh ginger, and twelve jujubes in one *dou* of water to yield four *sheng*; divide into four doses. Mild purgation should follow.\n\nThese four formulas are of the utmost urgency. If medicine can be obtained promptly, one need not resort to other measures, and death may be averted. All other minor treatments are merely precautionary or for extreme cases.\n\nIf the illness is mistreated or fails to resolve after ten days or more, it is termed a \"ruined disease,\" and only *Da Xiao Biejia Tang* (\"Major and Minor Turtle Shell Decoctions\") should be administered. As this formula requires many ingredients in small quantities, it is not feasible for emergency use and thus is not recorded here.\n\nIn all cases of cold damage where sweating is induced, avoid excessive fluid loss. A single dose should produce mild sweating; once the sweat clears, cease further administration. If sweating persists, apply powder and avoid drafts.\n\nWhen cold damage first manifests with generalized heaviness, lumbar and back pain, unremitting vexation, a floating pulse, a face flushed with brocade-like macules, sore throat, or diarrhea, or with delirious speech and a desire to flee, this is termed \"yang toxin.\" It is treatable within five days; beyond this, death ensues. The following formula is appropriate:\nBoil one *fen* each of realgar, licorice, cimicifuga, Chinese angelica, Sichuan pepper, and cinnamon in five *sheng* of water to yield two and a half *sheng*; divide into three doses. Cover to induce sweating. If sweating does not occur, prepare another dose.\n\nIf the body feels heavy and the back stiff, with a sensation of being beaten, abdominal pain, epigastric rigidity, shortness of breath, retching, cyanotic lips, a dark complexion, cold limbs, and a pulse that is deep, fine, tight, and rapid, this is termed \"yin toxin.\" It is treatable within five days; beyond this, death ensues. The following formula is appropriate:\nBoil two *fen* each of licorice and cimicifuga, one *fen* each of Chinese angelica and Sichuan pepper, and one *liang* of turtle shell in five *sheng* of water to yield two and a half *sheng*; divide into three doses. Cover to induce sweating. If sweating does not occur, prepare another dose by decocting the ingredients again.\n\nFor yin toxin with cold mouth and nose, grind one *fen* each of dried ginger and cinnamon into powder and consume with three *ge* of warm wine; this should produce intense heat and lead to recovery.\n\nYin and yang toxins do not only appear at the onset but may also develop after one or two days. All such cases should be treated with the aforementioned formulas. Most patients with these conditions succumb to the illness.\n\nFor heat disease that fails to resolve and leads to severe diarrhea with impending death, administer *Da Qing Tang* (\"Major Indigo Decoction\"):\nBoil four *liang* of indigo plant, three *liang* of licorice, two *liang* of donkey-hide gelatin, eight *ge* of fermented soybeans, and three *liang* of red halloysite in one *dou* of water to yield three *sheng*; divide into three doses. If the decoction is exhausted, prepare another. Administer two doses day and night to achieve recovery.\n\nAnother formula:\nBoil one *sheng* of fermented soybeans, fourteen gardenia fruits, and one handful of Chinese leek in five *sheng* of water to yield three and a half *sheng*; divide into three doses.\n\nAnother formula:\nCrush half a *jin* of dragon bone and boil in one *dou* of water to yield five *sheng*. Consume the decoction extremely cold in small sips. If sweating occurs at any point, recovery follows.\n\nAnother formula:\nForm pills the size of parasol seeds with two *liang* each of coptis and Chinese angelica, one *liang* of dried ginger, two *liang* of red halloysite, and honey. Consume twenty pills, three times during the day and twice at night.\n\nAnother formula:\nBoil two *liang* of coptis and a piece of processed mugwort the size of a duck egg in two *dou* of water to yield one *sheng*; consume in one dose to achieve immediate cessation. This formula governs all epidemic dysentery.\n\nFor all epidemic dysentery, boil three *liang* of coptis, two *liang* each of phellodendron, Chinese angelica, and dragon bone in six *sheng* of water to yield two *sheng*. Strain, add seven *ge* of honey, and decoct again to yield one and a half *sheng*; divide into three doses. This is effective.\n\nFor epidemic toxin disease with concurrent heat, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, boil half a *liang* each of cimicifuga, licorice, coptis, Chinese angelica, peony, cinnamon bark, and phellodendron in three *sheng* of water to yield one *sheng*; consumption should yield good results.\n\nFor epidemic disease with severe heat diarrhea after four or five days, boil three *liang* each of coptis and phellodendron, three *liang* of dragon bone, and a piece of mugwort the size of a chicken egg in six *sheng* of water to yield two *sheng*; divide into two doses. Avoid consuming pork and cold water.\n\nFor unremitting pus and blood in the stool, boil one *jin* of red halloysite, one *liang* of dried ginger, and one *sheng* of rice in seven *sheng* of water until the rice is cooked. Strain and consume seven *ge* twice daily.\n\nAnother formula:\nBoil one *jin* of red halloysite and two *liang* of dried ginger in five *sheng* of water to yield three *sheng*; divide into two doses.\n\nFor gripping umbilical pain, add one *liang* of Chinese angelica and two *liang* of peony, and increase the water by one *sheng*.\n\nTo promote bowel movement when the stool is hard and impacted, boil four *liang* of rhubarb, two *liang* of magnolia bark, and four pieces of unripe bitter orange in four *sheng* of water to yield one *sheng* and two *ge*; divide into two doses. Cease administration once the bowels move.\n\nFor constipation lasting over ten days, administer *Chengqi Wan* (\"Qi-Regulating Pill\"):\nGrind two *liang* each of rhubarb and apricot kernels, one *liang* of unripe bitter orange, and one *ge* of mirabilite. Mix with honey to form pills the size of a bullet. Consume with six or seven *ge* of hot water. If the bowels do not move, administer another dose.\n\nFor diarrhea with inability to eat, grind one *sheng* of coptis and twenty roasted and dried mume fruits into powder.

      "translated_text": "For distension and fullness in the lower abdomen with inability to urinate, the following remedies may be used:\n\nGrind realgar into fine powder, mix with honey, and form into pills the size of a jujube pit. Insert into the urethral opening to a depth of half an inch. Alternatively, use a bamboo tube to inject into the vagina, causing pain and inducing urination to achieve relief.\n\nAnother remedy: Grind three *liang* of talc and one *ge* of *tingli* seeds into powder. Boil in two *sheng* of water until seven *ge* remain, then consume.\n\nAnother remedy: Pound fresh scallions and apply thinly to the lower abdomen, replacing them frequently.\n\nFor fullness and oppression in the chest and rib-sides, heart blockage, qi urgency, and panting, the following remedy may be used:\n\nGrind one *liang* each of ginseng and *bai zhu*, two *liang* of *zhi shi*, and one *liang* of dried ginger. Mix with honey to form pills. Consume one pill per dose.\n\nIf coughing is present, add two *liang* of *gua lou*.\nIf vomiting occurs, add two *liang* of oyster shell.\nTake five or six pills day and night. If not cured, continue administration.\n\nFor toxic disease attacking the throat causing swelling and pain, the following remedies may be used:\n\nSlice *shanglu* and roast until hot. Place on a cloth over the throat and press with a heated cloth. Replace when cool.\n\nAnother remedy: Take a piece of real cinnabar the size of a fingernail, place in the mouth, and lightly chew to release its juice, allowing it to soak the throat. A slight unusual sensation indicates efficacy.\n\nFor toxic disease attacking the eyes afterward, the following remedies may be used:\n\nBoil a wasp’s nest and use the liquid to wash the eyes, six or seven times daily. This is effective.\n\nAnother remedy: Soak a green cloth in cold water and apply to the eyes.\n\nIf a nebula forms, burn fourteen *chi* beans, grind into powder, and blow into the nose using a tube.\n\nFor unremitting vomiting due to cold damage, the following remedies may be used:\n\nBoil one *liang* of licorice, half a *liang* of *shengma*, three *liang* of fresh ginger, and two *liang* of tangerine peel in three *sheng* of water until two *sheng* remain. Consume in one dose to cure.\n\nAnother remedy: Grind six *fen* of dried ginger and four *fen* of aconite into powder. Mix with vinegar to form pills the size of parasol seeds. Take three pills per dose, three times daily.\n\nFor unremitting hiccups due to cold damage, the following remedies may be used:\n\nBoil three *liang* of licorice and one *sheng* of tangerine peel in five *sheng* of water until three *sheng* remain. Divide and consume, three times daily, until cured.\n\nAnother remedy: Wash and dry *banxia*, then grind into powder. Take one *qian* per dose.\n\nAnother remedy: Boil one handful of red perilla in three *sheng* of water until two *sheng* remain. Drink gradually.\n\nAnother remedy: Grind six *fen* of dried ginger and four *fen* of aconite into powder. Mix with vinegar to form pills the size of parasol seeds. Take three pills per dose, three times daily.\n\nIn recent years, there has been an epidemic disease causing sores to erupt on the head, face, and body, spreading rapidly like fire sores, all filled with white pus. If ruptured, new sores form immediately. If not treated promptly, severe cases often result in death. Even after recovery, the scars remain purple-black for over a year before fading. This is caused by virulent toxic qi.\n\nIt is said that in the fourth year of Yonghui (653 CE), these sores spread from west to east across the land. Boiling mallow and consuming it with garlic paste was found to halt the condition. Eating it at the onset of symptoms, even with a small amount of rice, is effective.\n\nThis disease was acquired during the Jianwu era (25–56 CE) in Nanyang while fighting the barbarians, hence it was called \"barbarian sores.\" Various physicians collaborated on treatments, and the following effective remedies were developed:\n\nApply high-quality honey to the entire body. Alternatively, decoct *shengma* in honey and consume frequently.\n\nAnother remedy: Boil *shengma* thoroughly in water, soak cotton in the liquid, and wash the sores. Soaking in vinegar is even better, though the pain may be unbearable.\n\nOther treatments follow the methods for cold damage, but one must be vigilant against the toxicity.\n\nUsing *dihuang* black ointment is also effective.\n\nFor epidemic jaundice, the following remedy may be used:\n\nBoil six *liang* of *yinchen*, two *liang* of rhubarb, and twelve gardenia fruits in one *dou* of water. First boil *yinchen* until five *sheng* remain, strain, then add the other ingredients and boil until three *sheng* remain. Divide into four doses. Other treatments for jaundice may also be combined for efficacy.\n\nIn recent years, there has also been a \"barbarian jaundice\" disease. Initially, one feels heaviness and discomfort in the limbs. Soon after, yellowing appears in the eyes, gradually spreading to the face and eventually the entire body. Immediately test the urine with white paper; if the paper turns yellow like turmeric dye, the heat toxin has entered internally, and urgent treatment is required.\n\nAt the first sign, prepare *guadi* and red bean powder and blow it into the nose. If several *sheng* of yellow fluid discharge from the nose, recovery is likely.\n\nIf the condition has progressed deeply, inspect the underside of the tongue for two prominent white veins. Use a reed knife to incise them, allowing several *sheng* of purple blood to drain, which will provide relief. However, this must be performed by someone experienced in the procedure. Inexperienced incisions may damage the blue veins under the tongue, causing unstoppable bleeding and death.\n\nAlternatively, heat an iron spindle until red-hot and cauterize the veins to scorch them. Combine *guadi* and *badou* into pills and consume to induce discharge of yellow fluid through the stool and urine. After cauterization, avoid all杂食.\n\nIt is also said that one may sit on yellow earth to alleviate jaundice, but this must be distinguished from other conditions.\n\nRemedies include:\n\nBoil bamboo and drink the liquid like tea.\n\nAnother remedy: Pound fresh *gua* roots, extract the juice, and drink one to two or three *sheng*.\n\nAnother remedy: Soak chicken eggs in vinegar overnight and swallow the whites of several eggs.\n\nAnother remedy: Cut five *sheng* of bamboo leaves, seven *sheng* of wheat, and three *liang* of gypsum. Grind into powder, wrap in cotton, and boil in one *dou* and five *sheng* of water until seven *sheng* remain. Consume one *sheng* per dose until finished for a cure.\n\nAnother remedy: Mix two *sheng* of fresh *ge* root juice, one *sheng* of high-quality *chi*, twenty-one gardenia fruits, and one *sheng* of chopped *yinchen*. Boil in five *sheng* of water until three *sheng* remain, strain, add the *ge* juice, and divide into five doses.\n\nAnother remedy: Prepare a golden-footed hen as one would for eating. Consume the meat and broth thoroughly, adding a small amount of salted *chi* for flavor. If not cured, repeat the treatment.\n\nFor toxic attack causing swelling and pain in the hands and feet, as if about to sever, the following remedies may be used:\n\nChop *huzhang* root, boil, and soak the feet in the liquid at an appropriate temperature, stopping when the water reaches just above the ankles.\n\nAnother remedy: Soak the feet in rice-straw ash liquid.\n\nAnother remedy: Boil *kushen* in wine and soak the feet until cured.",

This also treats swelling and pain in the private parts.\n\nAnother remedy: Dig a pit three *chi* deep, just large enough to hold both feet. Heat the pit thoroughly, then pour wine into it. Step into the pit wearing clogs, ensuring the steam is contained and does not escape.\n\nAnother remedy: Boil *yangtao* juice and soak the affected area; adding a small amount of salted *chi* is especially effective.\n\nAnother remedy: Boil horse dung or sheep dung in water and soak the affected area.\n\nAnother remedy: Mix sheep dung with lard and apply to the swelling; this is also effective.\n\nAnother remedy: Wrap the swollen area with beef, and the swelling will subside and pain cease.\n\nAnother remedy: Pound *changsicao*, extract the juice, and soak the feet in it.\n\nAnother remedy: Boil one pig’s trotter with scallions, remove the dregs, add a small amount of salt, and soak the affected area.\n\nFor toxic disease causing sores in the lower body, burn a *guan* vessel and insert the ashes deeply as a suppository; no more than three applications are needed.\n\nAnother remedy: Apply raw lacquer and insert it with cotton.\n\nAnother remedy: Form large moxa cones and apply moxibustion to the lower body—this is a last resort when no other medicine is available.\n\nAnother remedy: Take three *sheng* of earthworms, boil in five *sheng* of water until two and a half *sheng* remain, and consume the entire decoction.\n\nAnother remedy: Boil peach bark until it reduces to a syrup-like consistency, then combine with cotton for insertion.\n\nAnother remedy: Pound water *xingcai*, wrap in cotton, and insert; replace five times daily until cured.\n\nAnother remedy: Boil *ju* bark and *hu* bark together until the liquid thickens like malt sugar, then use for insertion.\n\nAnother: A thick decoction of boiled peach bark, taken as a drink, is most effective.\n\nAnother remedy: Pound *shemei* to extract the juice, take three *ge* three times daily. Soak black plums in water until concentrated, then add honey from cliff bees, and drink frequently.\n\nIf the patient’s teeth lose their color, the tongue turns white, or they become excessively drowsy, confused, and insensitive to pain, or if they suffer from diarrhea, urgently treat the lower body. Those who do not recognize this will only address the upper body, neglecting the lower, allowing worms to grow in the lower body. These worms will consume the anus, and when the anus rots to reveal the five viscera, death follows.\n\nRemedy: Take egg white, mix with lacquer, return it to the eggshell, and swallow it while facing upward. This will induce vomiting of the worms, leading to recovery.\n\nAnother remedy: Burn horse hooves to ash, grind finely, mix with lard, and apply to cotton for insertion into the lower body several times daily until cured.\n\nAnother remedy: Boil fifteen peach kernels, two *sheng* of bitter wine, and one *ge* of salt until six *ge* remain, then consume.\n\nAnother remedy: Burn mugwort in a tube to fumigate the lower body, allowing the smoke to enter. Mix a small amount of realgar into the mugwort—this method is used for *xiwen* (stream warmth), hence the inclusion of its treatment.\n\nFor incessant diarrhea from an unknown cause: Two *liang* of *wutou*, one *liang* each of *nüwei* and *yunshi*, and two *fen* of *gui*. Form into honey pills the size of *tongzi* seeds, and take five pills with water three times daily.\n\nFor sudden pain in the lower body resembling a bird’s pecking: Pound one *sheng* each of red adzuki beans and large beans, place in two pouches, steam until hot, and alternate sitting on them to cure. This was originally recorded in the miscellaneous treatments section and is also caused by toxic *qi* from cold damage.\n\nThus, while there are many remedies for cold damage—including those using *mahuang*, *gegen*, *guizhi*, *chaihu*, *qinglong*, *baihu*, *sishun*, and *sini*, totaling over twenty essential formulas—the ingredients are difficult to fully prepare. Moreover, diagnosis must be precise, and other comprehensive formulas are recorded elsewhere. Here, only the four most urgently needed formulas are included. The *huanggao* and *chisang* remedies are found in the disease-prevention section and should be prepared in advance; take them at the first sign of illness.\n\nCold damage (*shanghan*), seasonal epidemics (*shixing*), and warm epidemics (*wenyi*) are three names for the same category of illness, though their origins differ slightly. When one is harmed by cold in winter, or when sweating from strenuous activity exposes one to wind and cold, the illness manifests in summer—this is called *shanghan*. When winter is not very cold, and warm air or westerly winds cause the joints to relax and become susceptible, the illness manifests in spring—this is called *shixing*. When pestilential *qi* and demonic toxins afflict a person in a given year, it is called *wenbing*. Though the diagnostic signs are similar, and refined discourse prefers the general term *shanghan*, common people call it *shixing*. Daoist talismans and inscriptions also distinguish the *five warm* diseases, but ultimately, they share the same path. However, there are differences such as *yangming*, *shaoyang*, *yin* toxin, and *yang* toxin. Cases of *shaoyin* disease that do not involve fever but present with abdominal fullness and diarrhea are the most difficult to treat.\n\n**Attached Formula**\nFrom *The Infallible Remedies*: For seasonal epidemic illness of one or two days’ duration: Take one large *liang* of *mahuang* (remove the nodes), boil in four *sheng* of water, skim off the foam, and reduce to two *sheng*. Remove the dregs, add a spoonful of rice and *chi* to make a thin porridge, and consume one *sheng* while strong. First, prepare hot water and pour over one hundred bowls’ worth over the head, then consume the porridge. Cover thickly to induce sweating; doing this at night is most effective.",

Add a small amount of rice vinegar and steamed cake, pound again until cool enough to form pills the size of a *chicken’s head*.\n\nFor *yin* toxin, decoct forty-nine *jiaomu* grains and two stalks of *cong bai* in one cup of water to six parts, and swallow one pill without chewing.\n\nFor *yang* toxin, decoct forty-nine *chi* grains and two stalks of *cong bai* in one cup of water, and swallow one pill without chewing.\n\n**Formulas from *Sun Yonghe’s Remedies***\nFor *yang* toxin entering the stomach with frequent bloody stool and unbearable pain: Take five large *yujin* roots and one *zaojiazi*-sized *niuhuang*, grind separately, then combine as a powder.

For each *qian*, decoct in one cup of water with a pinch of salt to half a cup, and consume warm.\n\nAnother formula for *yin* excess obstructing *yang* in *cold damage*, where the patient is vexingly hot yet unwilling to drink water: *Thunderbolt Powder* is appropriate. Take one *fuzi*, burn to ash while preserving its nature, grind to powder, and administer with honey water in a single dose—this dispels cold *qi*, allowing *heat qi* to ascend and induce sweating for recovery.\n\n**Formulas from *Sagely Benevolence Remedies***\nFor *yin* toxin *cold damage* with reversal cold of the limbs, moxibustion is advisable: Take one *sheng* of *wuzhuyu*, mix evenly with wine, fill two silk pouches, steam until extremely hot, and apply to the soles of the feet. Discontinue once *qi* flows smoothly and warmth is evenly restored—this method has been repeatedly verified.\n\n**Tang Dynasty: Cui Yuanliang’s Remedy**\nFor seasonal epidemic with jaundice, frenzied heart vexation, and delirium: Take one large yellow *gualou*, soak in nine *ge* of freshly drawn water; strain the juice, add half a large *ge* of honey and eight *fen* of *poxiao*, stir until dissolved, and divide into two doses—recovery follows.\n\n**Formulas from *Arcane Essentials from the Imperial Library***\nFor seasonal epidemic of four or five days’ duration with *jiexiong* (chest bind), fullness, pain, and high fever: Take one *liang* of *kushen*, slice, decoct in two *sheng* of vinegar to one *sheng* and two *ge*, and consume entirely—recovery follows vomiting. For seasonal epidemic *toxin disease*, only *kushen* and vinegar remedies resolve it, and warming to induce sweating brings recovery.\n\nAnother formula for urgent relief of post-epidemic *ou ni* (vomiting-reversal) with inability to retain food: Prepare sheep’s liver as for eating, consume raw and plain—three doses suffice to stop it.\n\nAnother formula: Take one chicken egg, boil for three to five boils, remove and soak in water until the exterior is cooked but the interior remains warm, then swallow—effective.\n\n**Formulas from *Sagely Benevolence Remedies***\nFor seasonal epidemic with *ou ni* (vomiting-reversal) and inability to retain food: Take half a *liang* of *banxia*, soak and wash seven times in hot water to remove sliminess, and one *liang* of fresh ginger; chop together, decoct in one large cup of water to six parts, remove dregs, divide into two doses, and consume warm at any time.\n\n**Formulas from *Master Shen’s Remedies***\nFor incessant *wa* (belching) in *cold damage*: Wash *banxia* thoroughly, dry, grind to powder, and take one *qianbi* with fresh ginger decoction.\n\n**Formulas from *Essential Relief for the Multitudes***\nFor unremitting cough and hiccup in *cold damage*, and persistent *yue ni* (hiccup-reversal): Take one *liang* of *xiang* and one *liang* of dried *shi di*, bake dry, grind to powder, and take one *qian* with ginseng decoction at any time.\n\n**Formulas from *Arcane Essentials from the Imperial Library***\nFor seasonal epidemic *toxin disease* with nosebleed due to *heat toxin*, where blood descends in several *sheng*: Grind fine *mo* (ink), form pills with egg white the size of *wutong* seeds, and take ten to twenty pills with fresh *dihuang* juice.

Take one pill with a *zicao* decoction; soon the heart and spirit will settle, sleep will come, and sores will erupt normally—thereafter, rest and convalesce to recover.\n\n**Drug Properties Treatise** states: *Huzhang* treats great heat with vexation and agitation, stops thirst, disinhibits urination, and suppresses all *heat toxin*. In summer, decoct with licorice—its color becomes amber-like and lovely, fit for storage. When tasted, it is sweet and fine. Place the decoction in a jar, chill in a well until it becomes as cold as water, and store in white porcelain or silver vessels. Sip it like tea; contemporaries call it *cold drink* and hold it in higher esteem than tea. It can break menstrual block in women—pound, steep in wine, and take regularly. Pregnant women must not take it, as it breaks the blood.\n\n**Formulas for Seasonal Epidemic Relapse and Overstrain (Chapter Fourteen)**\nFor all *toxin diseases* after recovery, within one hundred days, prohibit pork, dog, and mutton, as they harm the blood; also avoid fatty fish, long-stored grease, and dried fish, as they will invariably cause severe dysentery—once diarrhea begins, it cannot be saved. Further prohibit wheat-based foods, garlic, leeks, scallions, raw vegetables, and shrimp [ ], as consuming these often leads to relapse, making treatment difficult and causing repeated outbreaks in subsequent years.\n\n**Formulas for Overstrain After Severe Illness, Early Exertion, or Excessive Eating and Drinking Leading to Mortal Danger**\nBurn tortoise plastron and take one *fangcunbi*.\n\nAnother formula: Take a small amount of *hufen* with water.\n\nAnother formula: Mix three *sheng* of powder with warm water and ingest; cover thickly to induce sweating.\n\nAnother formula: Boil one handful of dried perilla in five *sheng* of water to yield two *sheng*, and consume entirely.

Cover warmly to induce sweating to resolve. Adding one *sheng* of hemp seeds and one *sheng* of water enhances the effect. May also add *zhishi* and a handful of scallion whites.\n\nAnother formula: Crush and roast chicken eggshells until yellow-black, grind to fine powder, and take one *ge* with hot water; cover warmly to induce sweating.\n\nAnother formula: Boil two *liang* each of *dahuang* and *mahuang*, fourteen *zhizi* kernels, and one *sheng* of fermented soybeans in five *sheng* of water to yield three *sheng*; divide and take twice to induce slight sweating and diarrhea.\n\nAnother formula: Thickly decoct *ganpi* and ingest—*lugen* is also excellent.\n\nFor relapse due to excessive exertion: Burn cooked rice, sift to powder, and take one *fangcunbi* for effect.\n\n**Formulas for Relapse from Sexual Intercourse, with Swollen Testicles or Retraction into the Abdomen, Abdominal Colic, or Urinary Block**\nBurn a woman’s menstrual cloth and take one *fangcunbi*.\n\nAnother formula: Take one [ ] egg, strike it thirty-six times, place at the door, and have the patient run until panting; then pierce below the ribs to draw one *sheng* of blood, mix with one *sheng* of wine, and drink. If no [ ] is available, take the blood alone, but avoid cold immediately afterward. Use *jia* [ ].\n\nAnother formula: Cover the man with the clothing of the woman with whom he had intercourse for the time it takes to eat a meal to revive.\n\nAnother formula: Take the shinbone and blood of *jia* [ ], mix with wine, and drink to resolve.\n\nAnother formula: Scrape two *sheng* of green bamboo shavings, boil in three *sheng* of water until it bubbles five or six times, then strain and discard the dregs.

The following formula may be used:\n\nTake a woman’s undergarment that has touched her private parts, cut a portion, burn it to ash, and ingest one *square-inch spoonful* three times daily. If urination becomes smooth and the genitals show slight swelling, recovery is imminent. A young girl’s undergarment is also effective. If the patient is female, a man’s undergarment may be used instead.\n\nAnother formula: Take fourteen *mouse droppings* (pointed at both ends), one handful of indigo, and five *sheng* of water. Boil to reduce to two *sheng* and ingest the entire decoction, then cover warmly to induce sweating.\n\nAnother formula: Take twenty-four earthworms and one *dou* of water. Boil to reduce to three *sheng* and ingest in one dose, then induce sweating—this is also effective.\n\nAnother formula: Grind four *liang* of dried ginger into powder, mix with hot water, and ingest at once. Cover warmly to induce sweating, and cease once relief is obtained.\n\nAnother formula: At the first sign of illness in a man, immediately apply moxibustion to the genitals—thirty-seven cones. If the condition persists, increase to one hundred cones, and recovery will follow. The eyes will remain unharmed, and genital sores will return to normal.\n\nWhen two men or two women engage in intercourse, they do not transmit *yin exchange* to one another; thus, the term *exchange* refers to the interchange of yin and yang.\n\nTo prevent relapse in a convalescent patient, take twenty fingernail clippings from a woman’s hands and feet, along with a one-*chi* length of the lower hem of her undergarment. Burn to ash and ingest with wine or rice broth.\n\nAfter recovering from a severe illness, even slight exertion may cause nosebleeds. Grind ten parts oyster shell and five parts gypsum into powder and ingest one *square-inch spoonful* with wine three or four times daily. Alternatively, form into honeyed pills the size of *wutong* seeds and ingest accordingly.\n\nAfter recovering from a severe illness, excessive sweating—including from the eyes—may occur. Use equal parts eucommia bark and oyster shell, ground into powder. Ingest five *spoonfuls* with water before bedtime; if sweating persists, repeat the dose.\n\nAnother formula: Grind two *liang* each of licorice and gypsum into powder. Ingest one *square-inch spoonful* with fermented rice water twice daily to resolve the condition.\n\nAnother formula: Grind dragon bone, oyster shell, and ephedra root into powder, mix with talcum, and dust the body—this is highly effective.\n\nFor post-recovery restlessness, insomnia, eye pain, and vexation:\nTake seven *ge* of fermented soybeans and fourteen black plums. Boil the plums in four *sheng* of water until reduced to two and a half *sheng*, then add the soybeans and boil to one and a half *sheng*. Divide into two doses. If black plums are unavailable, use fourteen gardenia fruits instead.\n\nAnother formula: Boil four *liang* of coptis, two *liang* of peony, one *liang* of scutellaria, and three small sticks of donkey-hide gelatin in six *sheng* of water until reduced to three *sheng*. Divide into three doses. Two egg yolks may also be added.\n\nAnother formula: Take one *dan* of flowing water from a thousand-*li* source, agitate it ten thousand times, then take two and a half *dou*. Wash two *liang* of pinellia, add one *dou* of glutinous rice and four *liang* of poria, and boil to five *sheng*. Divide into five doses.\n\n**Supplementary Formula (from *Master Mei’s Prescriptions*)**:\nFor post-recovery relapse triggered by intercourse, causing extreme debility, inability to open the eyes, or speechlessness:\nBoil thirty gardenia fruits in three *sheng* of water until reduced to one *sheng* and ingest.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: Formulas for Miasma, Epidemics, Warm Toxins, and Pestilence**\n\n**Dried Powder to Ward Off Epidemics**:\nTake one *liang* each of hemp seeds, cypress seeds, dried ginger, and asarum, along with half a *liang* of prepared aconite. Grind into powder, and at dawn, have each household member ingest one *square-inch spoonful* with well water. In severe epidemics, take three doses daily.\n\n**Lord Lao’s Divine White Powder**:\nGrind one *liang* of atractylodes, three *liang* of aconite, four *liang* of Sichuan aconite, two and a half *liang* of platycodon, and one *liang* of asarum into powder. At dawn, ingest one *qian-spoonful*. If one household prepares this, an entire village will remain free of illness. Carrying it while traveling will dispel pathogenic qi upon encounter. If others fall ill, administer one *square-inch spoonful* with warm wine. For those ill for four or five days, boil one *spoonful* in three *sheng* of water, ingest one *sheng*, and cover to induce sweating.\n\n**Red Powder Formula**:\nGrind five *fen* each of moutan bark and prepared gleditsia pods, three *fen* each of asarum, dried ginger, and aconite, two *fen* of cinnamon bark, four *fen* of true pearl, and four *fen* of *zhizhu* into powder. At the first sign of stiffness or malaise, insert a small amount into the nostrils to induce vomiting. Ingest one *square-inch spoonful* with warm wine, cover to induce sweating, and recovery will follow. When traveling at dawn or night or visiting the sick, dusting the body with a small amount is also beneficial. For livestock epidemics, place one *spoonful* under the tongue and administer urine as a wash three or four times daily—highly effective.\n\n**Mountain Miasma Powder**:\nTo ward off mountain miasma and malignant qi, or when encountering black fog, oppressive vapors, or warm winds from the southwest—all harbingers of epidemics:\nGrind five *fen* each of ephedra and Sichuan pepper, three *fen* of Sichuan aconite, and one *fen* each of asarum, atractylodes, saposhnikovia, platycodon, cinnamon bark, and dried ginger into powder. At dawn, ingest one *spoonful* with wine. Particularly effective for those exposed to toxic qi while traveling through mist.\n\n**Taiyi Flowing Gold Formula**:\nGrind three *liang* of realgar, two *liang* of orpiment, one and a half *liang* each of alum and *ghost arrows*, and two *liang* of goat horn into powder. Store one *liang* in a triangular crimson pouch, wear it over the heart, and hang it on doorways. On the first day of the month, wrap one *knife-point* of the powder in blue cloth, burn it in the courtyard, and have the sick inhale the fumes to recover.\n\n**Epidemic Warding Pill**:\nGrind equal parts realgar, cinnabar, croton seeds, alum, aconite, and dried ginger into powder, mix with honey, and form into pills the size of sesame seeds. At dawn, face the sun and swallow one pill daily for nine days to remain disease-free.\n\n**Common Powder for Warding Off Warm Diseases**:\nGrind one *fen* each of true pearl and cinnamon bark, three *fen* of fritillaria (roasted), and three *fen* of egg white (roasted until yellow-black) into powder. Ingest one *square-inch spoonful* on New Year’s Day. If illnesses are prevalent that year, take it on the first and fifteenth of each month.

      "translated_text": "**Remedies for Malarial Diseases (Section Sixteen)**\n\nFor malarial disease: Take fourteen *shimu* (pill bugs) and fourteen fermented soybeans, pound together, and blend. Take two pills when the episode has not yet begun, and one pill when it is about to strike.\n\nAnother remedy: Take a handful of sweet wormwood, steep in two *sheng* of water, wring out the juice, and consume it all.\n\nAnother remedy: Burn a single clove of *dufu* garlic over white charcoal, grind into powder, and take one *square-inch spoonful*.\n\nAnother remedy: On the fifth day of the fifth month, take a slice of garlic, peel and split it open, then carve with a knife to hold one *badou* (croton seed). Remove the heart and skin of the *badou*, place it inside the garlic, secure with bamboo, and roast over fire until hot. Pound into three pills. Take one pill before the episode begins; if it does not cease, take another.\n\nAnother remedy: Take one spider, seal it tightly in a reed tube, and tie the tube around the neck. Remove it only after the episode has passed.\n\nAnother remedy: At sunrise, face east and bow twice. Then kneel upright, clasp hands toward the sun, and hold your breath. Use ink to mark each ear seven times, then write with cinnabar on the tongue, saying, “Die on the *zi* day.” Bow twice again, leave without looking back, lie down calmly, and refrain from eating. The episode will cease after its time has passed.\n\nAnother remedy: Boil a large amount of fermented soybean broth, drink several *sheng* to induce heavy vomiting, and the disease will be cured.\n\nAnother remedy: Place one spider in cooked rice, form into a pill, and swallow it.\n\nAnother remedy: When the episode is about to begin, pound large *fuzi* (aconite) into powder, mix with bitter wine, and apply to the back.\n\nAnother remedy: Take four *shimu* larvae, wrap each in malt sugar, and swallow as pills to immediately cease the episode.\n\nAnother remedy: Pound three *liang* of *changshan* (dichroa root) into fine powder, mix with one *liang* of *zhen dan* (cinnabar) and white honey, and pound one hundred times to form pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take three pills before the episode, three at mid-episode, and three before sleep. There is no case where this does not cease the disease; it is consistently effective.\n\nAnother remedy: Open the mouth wide, measure the upper and lower lips with a string, then measure from the string to the heart. Moxa one hundred *zhuang* at this measured point below, and moxa fifty *zhuang* at the center of the spine. After the episode has passed, moxa twenty *zhuang*.\n\nAnother remedy: Split a large soybean, remove the skin, and inscribe one half with the character for “sun” and the other with “moon.” Hold the “sun” in the left hand and the “moon” in the right, swallow them facing the sun, and do not let others know.\n\nAnother remedy: Take three *liang* of *zaojia* (Chinese honey locust), remove the skin and roast, add one *liang* of *badou*, remove the heart and skin, pound together, and form pills the size of large soybeans. Take one pill per dose.\n\nAnother remedy: Take one *badou*, remove the heart and skin, and one piece of *shegong* (arrowhead) the size of a *badou*, along with one jujube (peeled). Pound together into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take one pill at the onset of each episode.\n\nAnother remedy: Take equal parts *changshan*, *zhimu* (anemarrhena), *gancao* (licorice), and *mahuang* (ephedra), pound into powder, mix with honey, and form pills the size of large soybeans. Take three pills before the episode to ensure it passes completely.\n\nAnother remedy: Take three *liang* of *changshan* and half a *liang* of *gancao*, boil in half a *sheng* each of water and wine, and reduce to half a *sheng*. Take one dose before the episode begins, and finish three doses by the time the episode strikes.\n\nAnother remedy: Steep three *liang* of *changshan* in three *sheng* of wine for two or three days. At dawn, take three *ge* (a measure), and induce vomiting. Take another two *ge* at the onset of the episode, and it will cease. Aged wine is also effective; in urgent cases, it may be boiled.\n\nAnother remedy: Take three *liang* of *changshan* and three hundred grains of *shu* millet, boil in six *sheng* of water, and reduce to three *sheng*. Divide and consume before the episode begins.\n\nAnother remedy: If the episodes occur irregularly with heat and vexation in the heart, take two *liang* of *changshan* and one and a half *liang* of *gancao*, boil in six *sheng* of water, and reduce to two *sheng*. Divide into two doses and consume to induce rapid vomiting, then cease. Do not eat or drink.\n\nFor chronic malaria that does not cease: Take three *liang* of *changshan*, one *liang* of roasted *biejia* (turtle shell), one *liang* of *shengma* (cimicifuga), one *liang* of *fuzi*, and one *liang* of *wuzeigu* (cuttlefish bone). Steep in six *sheng* of wine near a small fire overnight. Take one *ge* per dose, and take several doses before the episode strikes.\n\nAnother remedy: Take one *liang* each of *hualu* (flowering reed) and *zaojia*, roast, and add twenty-five *badou*. Pound together, stir-fry until yellow, and follow the method to pound into pills the size of small soybeans with honey. Take one pill on an empty stomach, one before the episode, and one at the onset. Do not eat or drink.\n\nAnother remedy: Take a handful of *niuxi* (achyranthes) stems and leaves, chop, and steep in three *sheng* of wine. Consume until there is a slight wine scent. If the disease does not cease, repeat the process, but do not exceed three doses.\n\nAnother remedy: Grind one *square-inch spoonful* of *longgu* (dragon bone) into powder. One hour before the episode, boil in one and a half *sheng* of wine for three boils, then consume while hot. Cover to induce sweating, and it will be effective immediately.\n\nAnother remedy: Take three *liang* of *changshan*, half a *liang* of *gancao*, and one *liang* of *zhimu*, pound into powder, and form pills with honey. At the onset of the episode, take ten pills the size of *wutong* seeds. For subsequent doses, reduce to seven or eight pills, then five or six pills, and the disease will be cured.\n\nAnother remedy: Two hours before the episode, place a charcoal fire under the bed to warm the spine and feet thoroughly. Cover with blankets, and cease after the episode has passed. This treats cases where cold precedes heat.\n\nAnother remedy: Roast *biejia* in advance, pound into powder, and take one *square-inch spoonful* in three doses at the onset of the episode. Moxa with fire, and there is no case where the disease does not cease.\n\nAnother remedy: Take three *liang* of *changshan*, pound into powder, and mix with egg white to form pills. Take thirty pills on an empty stomach, thirty pills long after eating, and thirty pills at the onset of the episode. Whether vomiting occurs or not, do not eat or drink from the time of taking the medicine until after the episode has passed.\n\nFor warm malaria with loss of appetite: Take two *liang* each of *zhimu*, roasted *biejia*, and *changshan*, three *liang* of *digupi* (wolfberry root bark), one *sheng* of chopped bamboo leaves, and four *liang* of *shigao* (gypsum). Boil in seven *sheng* of water and reduce to two *sheng* and five *ge*. Divide into three warm doses.",

After ten days, eat fatty meat to induce a recurrence.\n\nFor visible malaria: Take two parts roasted *bailvti* (white donkey hoof), four parts *dahuang* (rhubarb), three parts *lüdou* (mung beans), two parts *pishuang* (arsenic trioxide), half a part *guangmingsha* (cinnabar), and one part *xionghuang* (realgar). Pound into powder, form honey pills the size of *wutou* seeds, and take two pills with cold water at daybreak on the day of onset. Avoid oil for seven days.\n\n**Additional Formulas**\nFrom *Waitai Miyao*: For unrelenting malaria, take equal parts *ganjiang* (dried ginger) and *gaoliangjiang* (galangal), grind into powder, and take one *qian* per dose, boiled in one *zhongzhan* of water until reduced to seven parts.\n\nFrom *Shenghui Fang*: For chronic malaria, consumptive malaria, and miasmic malaria, take three *liang* of *biejia* (turtle shell), coat with suet, roast until yellow, remove the rim, and grind into powder. Take two *qianbi* with warm wine at the onset of the episode.\n\nFor malaria: Take one hundred *taoren* (peach kernels), remove the skin and tips, grind finely in a mortar without contact with unboiled water, and form a paste. Add three *qian* of *huangdan* (yellow lead oxide) and form pills the size of *wutou* seeds. Take three pills on the day of onset, swallowing with warm wine while facing north. If wine is not consumed, well-drawn water may be used instead. Prepare on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month at noon. Avoid chickens, dogs, and women during preparation.\n\nAnother formula: Take any amount of *xiaosuan* (garlic), grind thoroughly, mix with a small amount of *huangdan* until cohesive, and form pills the size of *jitou* (foxnut). Once dry, take one pill with freshly drawn water while facing east. Most effective.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: Remedies for Sudden Onset of Manic-Depressive Illness**\n\nFor sudden manic illness: Moxa three cones at the center of the penis. Recovery follows when urination becomes unobstructed.\n\nAnother remedy: Moxa three cones on the penis and fourteen cones at the seam below the scrotum.\n\nAnother remedy: Moxa three cones on each nipple, seven cones at the base of the big toe where the hairs converge, and seven cones at the base of the little toe.\n\nAnother remedy: Take one *sheng* of *tingli* (lepidium seed), pound three thousand times, hang a white dog upside down, strike it with a stick to draw blood, and mix with the *tingli* powder. Take one pill the size of a hemp seed, three doses to cure.\n\nAnother remedy: Steep three *sheng* of *langdang* (henbane) seeds in five *sheng* of wine, remove and dry, repeating until the wine is exhausted. Pound into powder and take one *qianbi* three times daily. Do not exceed the dose, as it may worsen mania.\n\nAnother formula from *Xiaopin*: The *Langdang* powder for manic-depressive illness. Take three *sheng* of *langdang* seeds, grind into powder, steep in one *sheng* of wine for several days, remove, pound, mix with the original liquid, strain, and simmer over hot water until it can be formed into pills. Take three pills the size of small beans three times daily. The face and mouth will feel tight, and there may be a sensation of insects moving in the head, with redness appearing on the forehead, hands, and feet—these are signs of impending recovery. If not observed, continue until the formula is finished.\n\nAnother remedy: Grind *fangkui* (ledebouriella) and take one to two *daogui* with warm wine. Numbness and slight insensitivity of the body indicate efficacy.\n\nAnother remedy: Burn the rope of a person who died by hanging and take three pinches of the ash.\n\nGenerally, for manic illness: When an episode occurs, the patient falls to the ground, foams at the mouth, loses consciousness, and upon being forcibly lifted, behaves wildly, even soiling themselves. Such cases are difficult to treat.\n\nFor sudden mania: Burn a toad, pound into powder, and take one *fangcunbi* three times daily with wine.\n\nAnother remedy: Lay the patient on the ground and pour cold water on their face continuously for an entire day.\n\nFor sudden raving or ghostly speech: Insert a needle slightly under the toenail of the big toe to stop the symptoms.",
      "overlap_context": "ty pills at the onset of the episode. Whether vomiting occurs or not, do not eat or drink from the time of taking the medicine until after the episode has passed.\n\nFor warm malaria with loss of appetite: Take two *liang* each of *zhimu*, roasted *biejia*, and *changshan*, three *liang* of *digupi* (wolfberry root bark), one *sheng* of chopped bamboo leaves, and four *liang* of *shigao* (gypsum). Boil in seven *sheng* of water and reduce to two *sheng* and five *ge*. Divide into three warm doses.",

      "translated_text": "Another remedy: Bind the patient’s two hands tightly together with a steamer’s belt, then apply moxibustion to both flanks. Grasp the elbow tips and cauterize both points simultaneously, seven cones each. After a short while, the demon will speak its name and beg to leave. Gently question it, then untie the hands.\n\nGenerally, when mania erupts, the patient may run wildly or claim exalted status, calling themselves divine or sacred. In all such cases, apply moxibustion extensively to achieve lasting recovery. If the patient instead weeps, moans, or sighs, this indicates demonic possession rather than mania, and should be treated according to methods for demonic afflictions.\n\n*The Effective Remedies of Recent Times* states: Burn paper used in silkworm rearing to ash, and take with wine or water to cure wind-induced mania.\n\n**Additional Remedies**\n*From the *Doumen Prescriptions*:* To treat epilepsy, apply moxibustion to the perineum at the midpoint between the anus and scrotum, one cone per year of age.\n\n*From the *Thousand Gold Prescriptions*:* For wind-induced epilepsy and all manner of illnesses, boil four *sheng* of hemp seeds in six *sheng* of water over high heat until the seeds split. Strain and reduce to seven *ge*, then take on an empty stomach at dawn. The patient may experience episodes, remain silent, or speak excessively—do not be alarmed. Simply massage their hands and feet until they calm. Three doses will bring recovery.\n\nAnother remedy: For sudden onset of manic possession—where the patient tears their hair, screams wildly, and attempts to harm others without regard for fire or water—form *ku shen* (sophora root) into pills the size of firmiana seeds with honey. Take ten pills per dose with mint decoction.\n\n*From the *Arcane Essentials from the Imperial Library*:* For wind-induced epilepsy with pulling pain in the flanks, episodes of vomiting, and tinnitus like cicadas, remove the heart and peel of *tian men dong* (asparagus root), dry in the sun, grind to powder, and take one *fangcunbi* with wine. Prolonged use also promotes longevity.\n\n*From the *Extensive Beneficial Prescriptions*:* For heat-induced wind epilepsy, thoroughly grind *lan long jiao* (decayed dragon’s horn) and take two *ge* of the thick juice before meals, twice daily.\n\n*From the *Proven Later Prescriptions*:* For adults and children suffering long-term wind epilepsy, throat-constricting coughs, or full-body wind rashes with sudden drooling: This remedy induces minimal vomiting, only expelling saliva. For children, administer one *zi*. Grind *gua di* (melon stalk) to a fine powder without limit. Adults take one *zi*; those under fifteen or the elderly and weak take half. Administer in the morning with well-flower water, and have the patient hold a piece of rock sugar in their mouth. After a while, saliva will flow like water. In chronic cases, once all saliva is expelled, a piece resembling a saliva cloth will float on the water like a mirror. When the saliva is fully drained, consume congee for a day or two. If vomiting becomes excessive and the patient weakens, drink a cup of musk decoction to stop it. Finely chop musk and take with warm water.\n\nFormerly, the Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices suffered from dizziness and took this remedy, expelling saliva with success.\n\n*The Miscellaneous Records of Emperor Ming* states: During the Kaiyuan era, a renowned physician named Ji Peng could diagnose illness by observing a patient’s complexion and speech, without needing to take their pulse. The emperor, having heard of him, summoned him to the palace to examine a concubine who, every afternoon, would laugh, sing, weep, and scream as if mad, yet could not stand. Ji Peng observed her and said: “This must have resulted from overeating followed by sudden exertion, causing her to collapse.” He administered a cloud-mother decoction, had her sleep deeply, and upon waking, her suffering was gone. When asked, she recounted: “During the grand celebration for Princess Taihua’s birth, the palace hosted a grand musical performance. I was the lead singer and, fearing my voice would not be clear and sustained, ate a full bowl of pig’s trotter stew before performing. After singing a long piece, I felt intense heat in my chest. While playing on the terrace, I fell from a height. It was a long while before I regained consciousness, and since then, I have suffered from madness and been unable to stand.”\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: Remedies for Sudden Fright, Demonic Possession, and Confusion**\n\nFor palpitations due to heart deficiency: Grind equal parts *ma huang* (ephedra) and *ban xia* (pinellia), form into honey pills, and take three pills the size of soybeans, twice daily, gradually increasing the dose. Wash *ban xia* to remove slipperiness and dry before use.\n\nFor distress caused by shock, sorrow, or terror—such as sudden loss of wealth, or pent-up frustration leading to mental disarray, erratic behavior, and restlessness: Combine two *liang* each of *long gu* (dragon bone), *yuan zhi* (polygala), *fu shen* (poria spirit), *fang feng* (saposhnikovia), and *mu li* (oyster shell); seven *liang* of *gan cao* (licorice); and seven *da zao* (jujubes). Boil in eight *sheng* of water, reduce to two *sheng*, and divide into two doses. Prepare daily until recovery.\n\nAnother remedy: Four *liang* each of *fu ling* (poria) and *gan di huang* (dried rehmannia); three *liang* each of *ren shen* (ginseng) and *gui* (cinnamon); two *liang* of *gan cao*; one *sheng* of *mai men dong* (ophiopogon), with the heart removed; six *liang* of *ban xia*, washed to remove slipperiness; and one *jin* of *sheng jiang* (fresh ginger). Boil in one *dou* of water with the blood and liver of a black hen, reduce to three *sheng*, and divide into four doses—three during the day and one at night. During treatment, eat lightly and avoid rich foods. Three doses will bring recovery.\n\nAnother remedy: Prepare a white rooster as for eating, cut four *liang* of *zhen zhu* (pearl) and four *liang* of *xie bai* (Chinese garlic chives), and boil in three *sheng* of water until reduced to two *sheng*. Fast overnight, then consume the entire chicken and broth at dawn.\n\nOther calming and mind-stabilizing pills are recorded in the major prescriptions.\n\nFor sudden demonic possession with confusion and chills: Apply moxibustion to the *ren zhong* point below the nose and at the base of the thumbnail on both big toes and thumbs, seven cones each. If symptoms persist, increase to fourteen cones.\n\nThis method originally appeared in the miscellaneous treatments.\n\nFor women who communicate with demonic entities, speaking or laughing alone, or experiencing sorrow and confusion: Grind one *liang* of *xiong huang* (realgar) and mix with two *liang* of melted pine resin. Stir with a tiger’s claw until the size of a bullet, then burn in a fire basket at night. Have the woman sit over it, covering herself tightly with a blanket, leaving only her head exposed. If not cured after one attempt, repeat up to three times, after which the demon will sever ties on its own.\n\nAnother remedy: Grind one *liang* each of *xiong huang*, *ren shen* (ginseng), and *fang feng* (saposhnikovia) with one *sheng* of *wu wei zi* (schisandra). Sift and take one *fangcunbi* with well water at dawn. Three doses will bring recovery.",

      "translated_text": "The master would insert five needles into the topknot of the patient’s hair. For those with manic illness, a vessel of water was prepared, covered with three layers of new red cloth, and a large knife laid horizontally atop it. Assuming a solemn demeanor, the master would call the patient forth. The afflicted would invariably attempt to rise and flee, but the master would not permit it. Instead, he would take a mouthful of water and spray it upon the patient, then exhale sharply while gazing intently—repeating this three times until the patient was thoroughly drenched. Wiping away the water, he would flick the patient’s forehead near the hairline with his finger and ask, “Do you wish to be cured?” The patient would refuse to answer, so the master would repeat the flicking twice seven times before receiving a response. Then, using a staff-like needle, he would pierce the area beneath the nose, beside the philtrum near the nostrils, leaving the needle in place. He would next insert needles into the hollows before both ear roots, again leaving them in place. Finally, he would measure one *cun* upward from the bridge of the nose into the hairline and insert a needle horizontally, then pierce straight upward from the nose into the same point. Only after these procedures would he thoroughly question the patient. Once the patient awoke in clarity and remorse, the treatment would cease.\n\nFor men or women who frequently dream of intercourse with spirits, leading to confusion and disorientation: Saw deer antler into fine shavings and take three pinches with wine, three times daily.\n\n**Attached Remedies**\nZhang Zhongjing’s remedy for palpitations below the heart: *Ban xia* and *ma huang* pills. Grind equal parts of the two ingredients into powder, form into honey pills the size of small beans, and take three pills each time, three times daily.\n\n*Jian Yao Ji Zhong Fang*: For unsettled heart *zang*, fright palpitations, and forgetfulness—upper diaphragm wind-heat transforming into phlegm. Grind one *liang* each of white quartz and cinnabar into powder. Take half a *qian* each time after meals and before bed, mixed with gold or silver-infused water.\n\nFor guest heat in the heart, qi obstruction between the bladder and ribs, constant morning sorrow, and unease with palpitations: Take two large *jin* of *sha cao* root, slice and roast until fragrant, then place in a raw silk pouch. Steep in three large *dou* of ash-free clear wine. In spring, soak for one day before drinking; after the tenth month, soak for seven days, keeping the vessel in a warm place. Drink one cup on an empty stomach, three or four times day and night, ensuring the wine’s influence remains continuous. Adjust dosage as needed. For those who do not drink wine, take ten *liang* of *sha cao* root, five *liang* of *gui xin*, and three *liang* of *wu yu*, grind into powder, and form into honey pills with one thousand pestle strikes, each the size of a *wu* seed. Take twenty pills on an empty stomach with wine or ginger-honey decoction, gradually increasing to thirty pills until recovery.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Remedies for Sudden Wind Stroke and Acute Conditions**\nFor sudden wind stroke with suffocating confusion and near-death: Moxibustion at the transverse crease beneath the big toe, one cone per year of age. Another remedy is the *Xu Ming* decoction.\n\nIf the poison is acute and mobility impaired, with inner sinew tension: Moxibustion at the inner ankle. For outer sinew tension: Moxibustion above the outer ankle, twenty cones.\n\nFor swelling and numbness due to deficiency: Grind two parts *bai lian* and one part *fu zi* into powder. Take half a *dao gui* each time, up to three doses daily.\n\nIf the eyes roll upward with the pupils obscured: Moxibustion behind both outer canthi, three cones.\n\nFor inability to recognize people: Moxibustion at the tips of the floating ribs, seven cones each (the floating ribs are the curved ends of the lower ribs).\n\nFor inability to speak: Moxibustion on the second or fifth vertebra, fifty cones.\n\nAnother remedy for speechlessness appears in a later chapter.\n\nAnother remedy: Boil one *sheng* each of fermented soybeans and *zhu yu* in five *sheng* of water until two *sheng* remain. Sip gradually.\n\nFor upward-rolling eyes, lockjaw, and acute abdominal pain: Moxibustion at the first transverse crease below the scrotum, fourteen cones.\n\nAnother remedy involves consuming medicinal pastes.\n\nFor those who rage, attempt to stab or kill others, or contemplate suicide, ceaselessly cursing and speaking in ghostly tongues: Moxibustion at the red flesh at the corners of both lips, one cone each. Also moxa the creases of both elbows, five cones each, and the space between the shoulder blades, three cones. Repeat the moxibustion three times over three days. This is Cang Gong’s secret method. Additionally, moxibustion at the seam beneath the scrotum, thirty cones.\n\nOther remedies for manic possession appear elsewhere.\n\nFor those who become manic: Take axle grease the size of a chicken egg, heat it in bitter wine, and stir until dissolved. Consume the entire mixture.\n\nFor heart vexation, confusion, abdominal fullness and pain, or intermittent loss of consciousness: Take five *sheng* of soot from beneath a cauldron, grind and sift, then mix with eight *sheng* of cold water. Strain and drink the entire liquid. If the patient’s jaw is locked, force it open and administer the liquid through a bamboo tube to ensure it is swallowed. The patient will recover immediately—this method is highly effective.\n\nFor opisthotonos with arched back, loss of limb control, and near-death from vexation: Mix five *sheng* of clear wine with one *sheng* of chicken droppings, grind and sift, then whisk a thousand times. Adults take one *sheng* three times daily; children take five *ge*. Recovery will follow.\n\nFor unbearable pain throughout the head and body, with disorientation and near-death from vexation: Take head filth the size of a large soybean and swallow it. Additionally, fill two pouches with steamed soybeans and alternate applying them as hot compresses to the painful areas. If soybeans are unavailable, steam mouse burrow soil and apply similarly.\n\nFor acute abdominal pain: Roast half a *jin* of salt until exhausted, place it in the mouth, then drink two *sheng* of hot water to induce vomiting. Recovery will follow.\n\nAnother remedy: Slice six parts *fu zi* and three *liang* of fresh ginger, boil in two *sheng* of water until one *sheng* remains, and divide into two doses.\n\nFor loss of limb control: Burn green cloth to produce smoke and fumigate the affected area using a small-mouthed vessel.\n\nAnother remedy: Boil three *sheng* of fermented soybeans in nine *sheng* of water until three *sheng* remain, and divide into three doses.\n\nAnother: Lightly roast one *sheng* of fermented soybeans, place in a pouch, and steep in three *sheng* of wine for three nights. Drink warm, enough to induce mild intoxication.\n\nFor localized spasms, numbness, and loss of control: Roll a handful of dried mugwort leaves into a ball, place it beneath a clay steamer, and seal all but one opening. Position the painful area over the open hole and burn the mugwort beneath it until the skin blackens. Recovery will occur within an hour.",

Force the mouth open with an implement and pour the liquid in, then induce sweating.\n\nAnother remedy: Four *liang* of *duhuo*, two *liang* of cinnamon, boiled in two *sheng* of wine and water to yield one and a half *sheng*.

      "translated_text": "If suddenly struck by wind-induced paralysis, with the body unable to control itself, speechlessness, and confusion rendering one unable to recognize others, the marrow fat of an aged leopard cat is most essential—this is found in the *Emergency Remedies* section.\n\n**Additional Formulas for Head Wind and Headache**\nFrom *Tested Formulas*: To treat acute wind strike with eyes closed, clenched jaw, and no way to administer medicine, use this powder. Dip the middle finger into the powder and rub the teeth thirty to forty times, focusing on the molars on both sides—the mouth will open on its own, allowing medicine to be given. Named *Opening the Pass Powder*: Grind *tiannanxing* into powder, mix with borneol in equal parts, and prepare on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month at noon. For the afflicted, administer from one *zi* to half a *qian*.\n\nFrom *Concise Aid for the Multitudes*: For wind strike with clenched jaw and foaming saliva.\nUse one *zhi* of *zaojiao*, remove the skin, coat with lard, and roast until yellow. Grind into powder and take one *qianbi* with warm wine at any time. If the pulse is strong and large, adjust the dose to two *qianbi*. If the jaw remains locked, rub the teeth with a white plum—the mouth will open, allowing the medicine to be administered to induce vomiting of wind saliva, leading to recovery.\n\nTo treat wind strike with loss of consciousness and tightly clenched jaw.\nUse one *liang* of *lilu*, remove the root, boil in a strong decoction of *fangfeng*, bathe, dry, cut finely, and stir-fry until slightly brown. Grind into powder and take half a *qian* with warm water, inducing vomiting of wind saliva as the effect. If no vomiting occurs after walking two *li*, administer again. Also treats gallbladder wind toxin, disharmony of deficiency and excess, and excessive drowsiness.\nUse one *liang* of raw *suanzaoren* and two *liang* of *jinting* wax tea, coat with fresh ginger juice, and roast until slightly scorched. Grind into powder and take two *qian* each time, boiling in seven *fen* of water to yield six *fen*, and consume warm at any time.\n\nFrom *Sun Shangyao’s Remedies*: To treat sudden wind strike with a drunken stupor, bodily heaviness, limbs unresponsive, or falling without falling, or a slanted mouth with slight drooling—if left untreated even briefly, it becomes a grave illness, thus harming the person. This condition arises from wind saliva congesting the upper diaphragm, obstructing the flow of *qi*. The *Emergency Salvation Thin-Saliva Powder* is recommended:\nFour *ting* of pig’s tusk *zaojiao* (must be plump and unblemished, with black skin removed), one *liang* of *jin fan* (clear and lustrous), grind both together, sift into fine powder, and grind again into a fine preparation. For the afflicted, administer half a *qian*; for severe cases, three *zi*. Mix with warm water and administer. It does not cause violent vomiting but only gently thins the saliva, allowing one to two *sheng* to be expelled, restoring clarity. Follow with gradual treatment—do not rush into aggressive therapy, lest it harm the patient’s life. Its repeated efficacy cannot be fully described.\n\nFrom *Master Mei’s Formulas*: To treat flaccid wind paralysis, with dragging limbs, slanted mouth and eyes, slurred speech, and unsteady gait.\nThe *Divinely Effective Black Dragon Elixir*: Five *liang* each of *chuanwu* (with skin and navel removed) and *wulingzhi*. Grind into powder, add borneol and musk, and grind finely. Form into pills the size of a bullet with water. For each dose, first dissolve one pill in fresh ginger juice, then mix with warm wine and consume. Take twice daily, on an empty stomach and before the evening meal. For one person, thirty pills suffice—after five to seven pills, one can lift the hands and move the feet; ten pills allow self-sufficiency.\n\nFrom *Sagely Benefit Formulas*: To treat all wind illnesses. If taken over time, it lightens the body, sharpens the eyes, darkens the beard, and preserves youthful appearance.\nUse the *nanzhu* tree: in spring and summer, take the branches and leaves; in autumn and winter, take the root bark. Select and finely chop five *sheng*, boil in five *dou* of water to yield two *dou*, strain, and simmer the liquid in a clean pot until it thickens like syrup. Store in a porcelain bottle and take one spoonful with warm wine, three times daily.\n\nAnother formula, with miraculous efficacy against wind.\nUse one *jin* of *mutianliao*, remove the skin, and finely chop. Place in a raw silk bag and steep in two *dou* of good wine. After seven days in spring and summer, or fourteen days in autumn and winter, open and consume. Take one cup each on an empty stomach, at noon, and in the early evening, adjusting the dose for the elderly and young. For long-term use, take only one cup each morning.\n\nAnother formula for wind-induced slanted mouth.\nCrush seven *badou*, remove the skin, and apply the paste: if the mouth slants left, apply to the right palm; if right, apply to the left palm. Place a cup of warm water over the palm—the mouth will straighten. Wash off the medicine and repeatedly pull the middle finger.\n\nAnother formula for wind-induced vertigo.\nUse two *liang* of cicada moltings, lightly stir-fry, and grind into powder. Take one *qianbi* with warm wine at any time.\n\nFrom *Essential Formulas Worth a Thousand Gold*: To treat wind strike with facial distortion, clenched jaw, and an immobile tongue.\nBoil *guixin* in wine to extract the juice, soak a cloth, and apply to the affected area—the condition will correct. If the left side is slanted, apply to the right; if the right, apply to the left. Consistently effective.\n\nAnother formula for wind stroke persisting for three years.\nFinely chop one *jin* of pine needles, boil in one *dou* of wine to yield three *sheng*, and consume in one dose to induce sweating—immediate recovery.\n\nAnother formula for sudden wind strike with facial swelling.\nPound apricot kernels into a paste and apply.\n\nAnother formula for head and facial wind, with eye and nasal congestion, dim vision, and cold tears.\nGrind three *sheng* of apricot kernels into powder, boil in water for four to five cycles, and wash the head until cold sweat is induced. Repeat three times for recovery.\n\nFrom *Arcane Essentials from the Imperial Library*: To treat sudden wind strike with slanted mouth.\nGrind five *liang* of *zaojiao* (skin removed) into powder, mix with three-year-old vinegar, and apply: if the mouth slants left, apply to the right; if right, apply to the left. Reapply as it dries—recovery follows.",

      "translated_text": "To treat this, decoctions, wines, massages, and ointments are commonly used. As there are many effective remedies (#37), not just one formula, here I select only those of singular efficacy, supplemented with moxibustion.\n\nTake one *sheng* of fine fermented soybeans, steam three times and sun-dry three times. Soak in three *dou* of good wine for three nights until drinkable, adjusting the quantity to the patient’s capacity. For prevention, administer without waiting for symptoms: boil the fermented soybeans in wine and take. When leg weakness shows slight improvement, further prepare other formulas and apply moxibustion.\n\nNext, the *Du Huo* Wine formula: five *liang* each of *du huo* (pubescent angelica) and raw, sliced *fuzi* (aconite), steeped in one *dou* of wine for three nights. Begin with one *ge* per dose, increasing until mild numbness is felt.\n\nAnother formula: two *jin* of *bai fan shi* (alunite) or *zhongru* (stalactite powder), three *liang* of *fuzi*, and three *sheng* of fermented soybeans, steeped in three *dou* of wine for four to five days. Drink gradually. If qi stagnation is present, add two *sheng* of *suzi* (perilla seed).\n\nAnother formula: grind three *liang* of fine sulfur into powder. Boil five *sheng* of cow’s milk with five *sheng* of water, add the sulfur, and reduce to three *sheng*. Take three *ge* per dose. Alternatively, boil sulfur directly in milk without water. If cow’s milk is unavailable, sheep’s milk may be used.\n\nAnother method: reduce three *sheng* of cow’s milk by half, then take five *ge* with one *liang* of sulfur powder. After ingestion, cover thickly to induce sweating, avoiding drafts. Take another dose midday and one at dusk. If sweating occurs, do not repeat; simply rest and recover. If unresolved, repeat after several days. For long-term use, it may be decocted into pills.\n\nNortherners find this sulfur remedy highly effective for leg disorders, provided the sulfur is of the finest quality. It should be prepared in advance.\n\nIf the shins are swollen such that pressing leaves an imprint, force the patient to drink two to three *sheng* of black calf’s urine to promote urination and gradually reduce swelling. Use a copper vessel, and fresh urine is best. If no black calf is available, a pure yellow one may suffice.\n\nAnother formula: grind *qianniuzi* (morning glory seeds), mix with honey into pills the size of small beans, and take five pills to promote urination. They may also be swallowed whole. The seeds are black, resembling *qiouzi* kernels, and are sold in markets.\n\nAnother formula: crush *sanbai* root and take with wine.\n\nAnother: boil black soybeans in water or wine and drink the broth.\n\nAnother: eating small red beans is also beneficial.\n\nAnother: grind raw *huma* (sesame), mix with wine, and take to cure the condition.\n\nAnother: boil three *sheng* of black soybeans in one *dou* of water to nine *sheng*, add nine *sheng* of clear wine, and reduce again to nine *sheng*. Drink gradually; urination will relieve the swelling.\n\nFormulas such as *Feng Yin*, *Bai Ji*, *Zhu Li*, and *Du Huo* decoctions, as well as *Ba Feng*, *Shi Hu*, and *Gou Ji* powders, are detailed in comprehensive medical texts.\n\n*Jin Ya* Wine is most essential for treatment; its formula is recorded here: four *liang* each of *shujiao* (Sichuan pepper), *yinyu* (skimmia), *jin ya* (golden teeth), *xixin* (asarum), *wang cao* (lithospermum), *gan dihuang* (dried rehmannia), *fangfeng* (saposhnikovia), *fuzi* (aconite), *difu* (kochia), *shuodi* (glossy privet), and *shengma* (cimicifuga); three *liang* of *renshen* (ginseng); one *jin* of *qianghuo* (notopterygium); and five *liang* of *niuxi* (achyranthes). Cut the fourteen ingredients, steep in four *dou* of wine for seven days, and drink two to three *ge* per dose, gradually increasing. It also treats speechlessness and bent legs with excellent results. *Cezi* Wine is also effective.\n\nFor rural or impoverished households, these remedies may be brewed: *baqia* (smilax), pine nodes, and pine needles are all beneficial. Wash and chop one *hu* of *baqia*, boil in three *hu* of water to nine *dou*, strain, and use the liquid to soak yeast and cook rice, brewing as one would wine. When ready, drink freely, preparing three to five *hu* at once. If using pine nodes or needles, follow the same method; the liquid should be as concentrated as possible.\n\nFor those with bent legs, unable to walk for years, or suffering from lumbar and spinal contracture and abdominal tightness, three to five doses will restore health.\n\nIf brewing is impractical, *shanglu* (pokeweed) by the water’s edge is also effective.\n\nMoxibustion points are numerous, but as not all may be known, I record only the essentials. Begin from the upper body; moxibustion on the legs alone risks trapping qi and causing danger.\n\nFirst, moxa *Dazhui*: the prominent vertebra at the nape. Apply moxa to the point above it. If qi stagnation is present, first moxa *Baihui* with fifty cones—this point lies in the depression atop the head.\n\nNext, moxa *Jianjing* on both shoulders with one hundred cones each. The point lies in the depression near the head on the shoulders; press with fingers to locate the center.\n\nNext, moxa *Danzhong* with fifty cones. This point lies between the breasts, at the junction of the sternum and ribs, where pressing elicits a subtle qi sensation. Some say it is the single point at the center of the chest.\n\nNext, moxa *Juque*, located one *cun* below the tip of the xiphoid process, measured by the patient’s finger-width. Moxibustion at these five upper points suffices to treat qi stagnation. Moxibustion at *Baihui*, *Fengfu* (#40), *Weiguan*, and the five *zang* transport points is even better, depending on the urgency of the condition. All points are recorded in moxibustion manuals and cannot be fully listed here.\n\nNext, moxa *Fengshi* with one hundred cones. This point lies on the outer thigh; stand upright, let the hands hang naturally, and press the thigh where the middle finger rests—this is the point, where pressing feels appropriate.\n\nNext, moxa *Zusanli* with two hundred cones. Have the patient place their hand horizontally below the knee, fingers together (a measure called *yifu*). The point lies one *yifu* below the kneecap, at the outer edge of the shinbone, where pressing reveals a depression.\n\nNext, moxa *Shang Lian* with one hundred cones, located one *yifu* below *Zusanli*.",

This point lies slightly more than three *cun* above the outer ankle; align the fingertip with the upper edge of the ankle bone, then bend the finger to measure four *cun*—this is the point. It roughly aligns with *Xialian*, forming two distinct points in the interstice. These eighteen points below are all essential points. For the remaining points—*Futu* and *Dubi*—when applying the prescribed number of cones, it is not necessary to complete them all at once; rather, spread the treatment over three days to fulfill the total.\n\n**Alternative Formula:**\nSteep two *jin* of *Konggongnie* and five *liang* of *shihu* in two *dou* of wine, then consume.\n\n**Appended Formulas:**\n\n*From the* **Doumen Fang***:*\nTo treat sudden wind-toxin, swelling, tightness, and acute pain: Take one *jin* of willow bark, chop it, and boil it in wine until hot. Wrap it in silk and apply it to the swollen area. When it cools, reheat and replace it. This method is highly effective.\n\n*From the* **Shenghui Fang***:*\nTo treat migratory wind-toxin pain: Grind small mustard seeds into powder, mix with egg white, and apply as a poultice.\n\n*From the* **Jingyan Hou Fang***:*\nTo treat wind-toxin bone-marrow pain: Grind two *fen* of *shaoyao* and one *liang* of roasted *hugu* into powder, place in a silk pouch, and steep in three *sheng* of wine for five days. Take two *ge* per dose, three times daily.\n\n*From the* **Shiyi Xinjing***:*\nTo dispel all wind-damp impediment and tetany of the limbs: Grind three *liang* of *cangerzi* into powder, decoct in one and a half *sheng* of water until seven *ge* remain, strain, and sip.\n\nAlso, to treat muscle spasms, chronic wind-damp impediment, downbearing *qi*, expelling pathogenic *qi* from the bones, harmonizing the intestines and stomach, dispersing water swelling, and—with prolonged use—lightening the body and augmenting *qi* and strength: Take one *sheng* of *yiyiren*, grind into powder, and for each dose, boil two *sheng* of water with two spoonfuls of the powder to make a congee. Consume on an empty stomach.\n\nAlso, to supplement deficiency, dispel wind-damp impediment: Warm one cup of wine, mix in two large *liang* of *tihu*, and take one spoonful of the mixture.\n\n*From the* **Jingyan Fang***:*\nTo treat pain beneath the skin anywhere on the body: Grind *heshouwu* into powder, mix with ginger juice to form a paste, apply to the painful area, and wrap with silk. Then, heat the sole of a shoe over fire and press it against the area. This method is highly effective.\n\n*From Sun Zhenren’s Formula:*\nTo treat *jiaoqi* and counterflow *qi*: Prepare *kuai* from one large red crucian carp and consume one or two portions at once for relief.\n\n*From the* **Qianjin Yi***:*\nTo treat *jiaoqi* surging upward to the heart: Boil two *liang* of alum in one *dou* and five *sheng* of water for three to five boilings, then soak and wash the feet. This is highly effective.\n\n*From the* **Guangli Fang***:*\nTo treat *jiaoqi* causing vexation, agitation, and loss of consciousness: Boil one *sheng* of soybeans in three *sheng* of water to make a thick decoction, then consume half a *sheng* at once. If symptoms persist, take another half *sheng* to stabilize the condition.\n\nSu Gong states: For those suffering from *jiaoqi*, eat to satiety in the morning as desired, eat lightly after noon, and fast in the evening. If hungry, consume fermented soybean congee. If digestion is poor and symptoms resemble impending cholera:\nTake two *liang* of *gaoliangjiang*, crush it, and boil in three *sheng* of water until one *sheng* remains. Consume it all at once to resolve the condition. Wait until extremely hungry, then eat a full portion of thin congee. This remedy is most effective when taken in large quantities. If *gaoliangjiang* is unavailable, substitute one *liang* of ginger, boil it thoroughly in one *sheng* of clear wine, and consume it with the dregs. Though not as effective as *gaoliangjiang*, it still yields significant results.\n\nThe *Tang Bencao* notes: For *jiaoqi*, soak the affected area in a thick decoction of *hongcao* for prolonged relief.\n\n*From the* **Jianyao Jizhong***:*\nTo treat *jiaoqi* with persistent leg swelling: Take one *liang* of black *fuzi*, remove the skin and navel, grind into powder, and mix with fresh ginger juice to form a paste. Apply to the swollen area, and when the paste dries, reapply with fresh mixture until the swelling subsides.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Formulas for Acute Onset of *Fu San* Toxicity**\n\nWhen consuming Five Minerals *Huming Gengsheng* or *Zhongru* Cold-Food Powder, improper regulation or dosage may provoke acute onset of illness, manifesting in myriad ways. If symptoms arise suddenly rather than gradually, they are due to the potency of the powder. Immediate intervention is required. For all external pains or abnormalities in the limbs or body, wash the affected area with cold water hundreds of times. If heat surges, soak a cloth in water and apply it as a compress. Alternatively, soak a cold stone in water and use it to press the area. Drink warm wine and walk leisurely.\n\nFor all internal pains or abnormalities in the heart and abdomen—such as vexation, oppression, or confusion—act swiftly. If cold, drink warm wine in one or two *sheng* increments, gradually increasing the amount. If slight relief is felt, consume more cold food. Heart pain is most urgent; if the flesh is cold and the mouth is clenched, force open the teeth and administer hot wine for relief.\n\nFor abdominal masses, heat accumulations, or other complex conditions, purge immediately. Boil fourteen *zhizi* and five *ge* of *chi* in two *sheng* of water until one *sheng* remains, then consume it all at once. If heat is severe and sores have erupted, add two *liang* of *huangqin*. If accumulations persist and appetite is poor with aversion to cold, purge again. Prepare the following powder: half a *sheng* of fine *dahuang* powder, half a *sheng* of *mangxiao*, two *liang* of *gancao*, and one *fen* each of *banxia*, *huangqin*, and *yuanhua*. Grind into powder and store in an airtight container. To administer, boil twenty *dazao* in eight *sheng* of water until soft, then strain to obtain four *sheng* of liquid. Add five *fangcunbi* of the powder, stir well, and heat the mixture three times (raising and lowering it over the fire). Divide into three doses and consume one in the morning. If bowel movements occur, the remaining doses may be omitted. If relief is not felt, take another dose.\n\nAfter purging, prepare wine congee and consume two *sheng*, followed by watery gruel. Do not delay eating, as an empty stomach may allow heat to enter, which can be fatal.\n\nAfter purging, always keep the following emergency formula on hand: one *ge* each of *dahuang* and *tingli*, thirty *xingren* and *badou*, ground and mixed with honey into pills the size of *hudou*. Take two pills daily.",

Additionally, one should avoid hot foods and drinks, heavy clothing, approaching fire, braving summer heat on long journeys, or excessive exposure to wind and cold.\n\nGenerally, the body should be in a robust state to tolerate these methods well.

Strain and divide into three doses; one dose every three days is effective.\n\n**For extreme heat exhaustion or eating hot cakes followed by excessive cold water, which fails to disperse in the throat and instead generates qi, causing wheezing and panting:**\nEqual parts rhubarb, dried ginger, and croton seeds—grind into powder and take half a *qian* spoonful.

      "translated_text": "**Cui Yuanliang’s *Remedies from the Sea*:**\n\nA singularly effective formula for coughs: Take a fine pear, remove its core, and pound to extract one teacup of juice. Add forty Sichuan peppercorns, bring to a single boil, then strain. Immediately add one large *liang* of black maltose, dissolve completely, and slowly hold in the mouth to swallow. It will take effect at once.\n\nMeng Shen states: For sudden coughing, take one pear and pierce fifty holes in it. Insert one Sichuan peppercorn into each hole, wrap in dough, and roast in hot ashes until done. Allow to cool, remove the peppercorns, and eat the pear.\n\nAnother formula: Remove the core of a pear, fill with *su* (ghee) and honey, wrap in dough, and roast until done. Eat.\n\nAnother formula: Stew pear flesh in *su* until tender, allow to cool, and eat.\n\nAnother formula: Pound one *sheng* of pear juice, one *liang* of *su*, one *liang* of honey, and one *sheng* of rehmannia juice. Simmer over a gentle fire and slowly hold in the mouth to swallow.\n\nFor all cough treatments, wait until the breathing has settled before eating, as consuming while hot will cause harm. Those with cold-induced coughs are beyond remedy. In such cases, prepare a mutton broth with noodles, eat to satiety, then lie down briefly.\n\n**From the *Qianjin Fang*:**\nTo treat coughing with counterflow *qi* in children and adults: Take three *sheng* of apricot kernels, remove skins and tips, and stir-fry until yellow. Pound into a paste, add one *sheng* of honey, and divide into three portions. Mix one portion with the apricot kernels, pound to the proper consistency, then add the next portion, and pound again until smooth. Finally, add the last portion and pound thoroughly. Take before meals, holding in the mouth to swallow the juice.\n\n**From *Yang’s Obstetrics and Pediatrics*:**\nA formula for urgent fullness in the chest, making it difficult to sit or lie down: Take one large *liang* of turtle shell, roast until yellow, and grind finely into powder. Steep one handful of *dengxin* (rush pith) in two *sheng* of water, decoct to five *ge*, and take one *qianbi* before meals. After meals, take one *qianbi* with honey water.\n\n**From Liu Yuxi’s *Transmitted Reliable Formulas*:**\nLi Ya’s remedy for all coughs and counterflow *qi*: Use dried ginger—only the finest from Taizhou—along with *zaojia* (Chinese honey locust), roasted and peeled, selecting plump, unperforated pods. Also use *guixin* (cassia bark), choosing the purple, pungent variety, peeled. Pound each ingredient separately, sift, then weigh equal parts (quantity as desired). Combine, pound and sift again, then blend with refined white honey. Pound twenty to thirty times. Take three pills per dose, slightly larger than *wutong* seeds. Take whenever coughing occurs, three to five times daily, without regard to meals. Avoid onions, oil, salt, fish, and hot wheat noodles. The effect is divine.\n\nLiu was in Huainan on the same staff as Li. Li often dispensed medicine without revealing the formula. When criticized for stinginess, Li explained: “Most people with coughs take cold medicines. If they saw this formula’s hot, drying ingredients, they would refuse to take it. That is why I only provide the medicine, and it proves effective.” Trials confirmed its reliability.\n\n**From *Concise and Effective Remedies for the Multitudes*:**\nTo treat lung *qi* panting and coughing: Take two *liang* of *madouling* (birthwort fruit), using only the inner seeds and discarding the husk. Add half a *liang* of *su*, mix well in a bowl, and stir-fry over a slow fire until dry. Add one *liang* of roasted licorice, grind both into powder, and take one *qian* per dose. Decoct in one cup of water to six *fen*, and sip warm. Alternatively, hold the powder in the mouth and swallow the saliva.\n\nFor phlegm-induced coughing with urgent panting: Take one and a half *liang* of *jiegeng* (platycodon root), grind into powder, and decoct in half a *sheng* of boys’ urine to four *ge*. Strain and take warm.\n\nYang Wenwei’s formula for phlegm-induced coughing and chest congestion: Select a large, plump *guālóu* (trichosanthes fruit), cut open, clean the seeds, crush, and scrape the peel. Slice finely and dry by baking. Take forty-nine *banxia* (pinellia rhizomes), wash ten times in hot water, crush, and dry by baking. Grind into powder, then simmer with the *guālóu* pulp and water used to wash it until it forms a paste. Grind finely into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take twenty pills with ginger decoction.\n\n**From the *Master Shen’s Formulas*:**\nFor chronic cough with counterflow *qi*, bodily swelling, shortness of breath, fullness, inability to lie flat, and constant frog-like croaking: *Baiqian* decoction governs this. Take two *liang* of *baiqian* (willowleaf swallowwort rhizome), three *liang* each of *ziwan* (tatarian aster root) and washed *banxia*, and seven *ge* of *daji* (euphorbia root). Slice, steep in one *dou* of water overnight, then decoct the next day to three *sheng*. Divide into three doses. Avoid mutton and maltose for best results.\n\n**From *Master Mei’s Formulas*:**\nFor chronic *xiā* coughing with wheezing and sleeplessness: Grind *baiqian* into powder and take two *qianbi* with warm wine.\n\nAnother formula for counterflow *qi* coughing with wheezing, gasping, and sticky phlegm: Soak indigo leaves in water for a long time, pound, and extract one *sheng* of juice. Take on an empty stomach in one dose. Shortly after, grind apricot kernels to extract juice and cook porridge to eat. Rest for one or two days, then repeat the treatment until phlegm is fully expelled.\n\n**From the *Military Ministry’s Handbook*:**\nFor coughing with counterflow *qi*, shortness of breath, and chest rattling in children and adults, with coughing up of foul, purulent phlegm: Take one *ge* of *danzhuli* (bamboo sap) three to five times daily. Adults may take one *sheng*.\n\n**From the *Sagely Benefit Formulas*:**\nTo treat sinew and vessel damage with urgent counterflow *qi* and coughing: Take twenty jujubes, remove pits, and simmer in four *liang* of *su* over a low fire until the *su* is fully absorbed. Hold one jujube in the mouth at a time and swallow slowly.\n\n**From the *Tested Later Formulas*:**\nTo suppress panting and dissolve phlegm: Take forty-nine pig trotter nails, wash and dry thoroughly. Place half a *zi* each of *banxia* and alum into each nail, seal in a jar to prevent smoke from escaping, and calcine until red-hot. Remove from fire, grind finely, and add one *qianbi* of musk. For those with upper panting and coughing, take with glutinous rice water. Children take half a *qian*. Most effective.",

      "translated_text": "**From the *Divine Garden Formulas*:**\nTo treat coughing with urgent counterflow *qi*, panting, coughing of blood, and spitting of blood: Take high-quality ginseng, pound into powder, and administer three *qianbi* per dose, mixed with egg white. Take at the fifth watch, then lie down without a pillow, supine. A single dose often suffices; for chronic cases, take again. Avoid raw, salty, pickled, or fermented foods, soy sauce, wheat-based dishes, and overindulgence in food or drink. Convalesce well.\n\nXi Yan once treated deficiency with internal heat, coughing of pus and blood, and dry mouth and throat, where cold-natured medicines could not be taken. Take four *liang* of fine astragalus and one *liang* of licorice, grind into powder, and take three *qian* per dose, infused like tea or added to porridge or gruel.\n\n**From Du Ren’s Formulas:**\nTo treat heat in the upper burner with sores in the mouth, tongue, and throat, and coughing of pus and blood: Take one *liang* of platycodon and two *liang* of licorice, grind into powder, and administer two *qian* per dose. Decoct in one cup of water until six-tenths remain, strain, and take warm after meals, sipping slowly. Also treats lung congestion.\n\n**From the *Tested Formulas*:**\nFor severe coughing, or fresh blood in sputum: Take one *jin* of mulberry root bark, soak in a rice-washed pot for three nights, scrape off the yellow outer layer, and slice finely. Add four *liang* of glutinous rice, dry over a low fire, then grind together into powder. Take one to two *qian* per dose, mixed with rice water.\n\n**From the *Doumen Formulas*:**\nTo treat lung rupture with incessant coughing of blood: Take a large piece of *hai xi* paste, roast over fire until charred yellow, then coat with *su* and roast again, repeating until fully permeated. Grind into powder, dissolve three large *qianbi* in hot water, and administer. The bleeding will cease. (This refers to *shui jiao*, highly effective.)\n\n**From the *Heart Mirror of Dietary Medicine*:**\nTo address counterflow *qi*, coughing, chest and diaphragm fullness, and panting: Take three *liang* of peach kernels, remove skins and tips, grind with one *sheng* of water to extract juice, and cook with two *ge* of polished rice into congee. Consume.\n\nAlso, to treat all lung ailments with incessant coughing of pus and blood: Take five *jin* of fine *su*, melt and clarify three times, then allow to congeal. The resulting *tihu* (purest essence) will yield one *ge* per dose, which is curative.\n\nAlso, to address chronic counterflow *qi*, coughing, copious phlegm, panting, and spitting of pus and blood: Take one *ge* of radish seeds, grind, decoct in water, and take before meals.\n\n---\n\n**Section Fourteen: Formulas for Sudden Generalized Swelling and Fullness**\n\n**For sudden swelling and fullness, with the entire body and face grossly enlarged:**\nTake one large carp and three *sheng* of undiluted wine, simmer until the wine is fully absorbed, then consume the fish. Do not add vinegar, salt, fermented beans, or other ingredients. No more than two or three doses are needed for recovery.\n\nAnother formula: Moxibust three cones on the white flesh below the inner ankle. Effective.\n\nAnother formula: Take one *dou* of soybeans, cook thoroughly, strain, and drink the broth while eating the beans. A few doses will suffice; red beans are especially effective.\n\nAnother formula: Mix egg yolk and white, apply to swollen areas, and reapply as it dries.\n\nAnother formula: Chop apricot leaves, decoct until concentrated, and soak the affected area while hot. May also be taken internally.\n\nAnother formula: Take ten kernels from within plum pits, grind thoroughly, and mix with three *ge* of polished rice. Decoct in four *sheng* of water to make congee, reducing to two *sheng*, and consume. For subsequent doses, increase the number of kernels.\n\nAnother formula: Take one *sheng* of soybeans, decoct in five *sheng* of water until two *sheng* remain, discard the beans, add eight *sheng* of wine, and further decoct to nine *sheng*. Divide into three or four doses. After swelling subsides, avoid excessive drinking if thirsty.\n\nAnother formula: Take three *sheng* of ox urine in one dose; swelling will lessen. If unresolved, take again.\n\nAnother formula: Take one *jin* of *zhanglu* root, peel and slice thinly, decoct until soft, discard the dregs, and add one *jin* of mutton, scallions, fermented beans, and salt, prepared as a meal. Consume freely. After swelling subsides, this may still be taken regularly. Alternatively, pound *zhanglu* and mix half with rice to steam into cakes for consumption.\n\nAnother formula: Take one pig kidney, divide into seven pieces, dust with one *fen* of *gansui* powder, and roast until cooked. Consume one piece daily for four to five days until bowel sounds and increased urination are noted. If not, continue until finished. Remove the skin before eating, and consume entirely for best results. Do not eat salt. If incomplete, repeat the course.\n\nAnother formula: Slice two *sheng* of *zhanglu*, steep in three *sheng* of wine for three nights, and take five *ge* to one *sheng* three times daily. This formula treats all types of fullness, whether from deficiency *qi*, wind-cold *qi*, or water-damp *qi*.\n\n**For swelling that enters the abdomen, causing severe fullness and distress, impairing food intake:**\nTake two *liang* each of *daji* and *wuzhi* powder, grind, mix with honey, and form pills the size of *tong* seeds. Take two pills at dawn; as swelling gradually recedes, continue until resolved, then cease.\n\nAnother formula: Take ten *liang* of *tingli* seeds, three *liang* of *jiaomu*, three *liang* of *fuling*, and two *liang* of *wuzhuyu*, grind, mix with honey, and form pills the size of *tong* seeds. Take ten pills three times daily.\n\nAnother formula: Take one carp weighing five *jin*, decoct in two *dou* of water until one and a half *dou* remain, discard the fish, and add five *liang* of *zejie*, three *liang* of *fuling*, and three *sheng* of sliced mulberry root bark. Further decoct to four *sheng*, and divide into four doses. Urination will increase, and swelling will gradually subside.\n\nAnother formula: Peel and roast *zaojia* until yellow, chop three *sheng*, steep in one *dou* of wine, and decoct in a stone vessel until boiling. Take one *sheng* three times daily, preparing a new batch when finished.\n\nIf swelling is localized to a specific area, mix ash with water and apply. Reapply as it dries.\n\nAnother formula: Grind red beans and hemp seeds together, and apply to swollen areas.",
      "overlap_context": "be in the mouth at a time and swallow slowly.\n\n**From the *Tested Later Formulas*:**\nTo suppress panting and dissolve phlegm: Take forty-nine pig trotter nails, wash and dry thoroughly. Place half a *zi* each of *banxia* and alum into each nail, seal in a jar to prevent smoke from escaping, and calcine until red-hot. Remove from fire, grind finely, and add one *qianbi* of musk. For those with upper panting and coughing, take with glutinous rice water. Children take half a *qian*. Most effective.",

The swelling will diminish upon application. Avoid contact with the eyes and genitals. This treats sudden swelling of the body resembling bloating.\n\nFor general swelling: Chop scallions, boil until soft, and soak the affected area two to four times daily.\n\nAnother formula: Steep one *sheng* of *tusizi* in five *sheng* of wine for two or three nights, then take one *sheng* three times daily until cured.\n\nIf swelling begins in the feet and gradually ascends, entering the abdomen proves fatal. The following formula treats this: Boil one *hu* of small beans until thoroughly soft, yielding four to five *dou* of liquid. Soak the area below the knees in the warm decoction twice daily until the swelling fully subsides. If the swelling has already entered the abdomen, do not soak; instead, consume only the boiled small beans, avoiding rice, fish, and salt. Drink the small bean decoction exclusively. In the absence of small beans, soybeans may be substituted. This condition is critical, with only one in ten surviving—treatment must be administered urgently.\n\nAnother formula: Shave paulownia or tung wood, boil to extract the juice, and soak the affected area while drinking a small amount. Adding small beans enhances efficacy.\n\nAnother formula: Finely chop one fresh pig’s liver and consume it at once. Do not consume with salt. Vinegar may be used for improved results.\n\nAnother formula: Drink boiled *chi* decoction and apply the dregs to the feet.\n\n**Additional Formulas:**\nFrom *Beiji Fang* (Emergency Remedies): For sudden full-body swelling, pound elm bark into flakes, mix with rice to make porridge, and consume to promote urination.\n\nFrom *Yangshi Chanru* (Yang’s Obstetrics and Pediatrics): For generalized swelling with inhibited urination, grind five *liang* of *zhuling* into powder, decoct in three *ge* of water, and take one *fangcunbi* dose, increasing to two if needed.\n\nFrom *Shiyi Xinjing* (Heart Mirror of Dietary Medicine): For qi panting, puffy swelling, and scanty urination, take one *liang* of apricot kernels, remove the tips and skins, stir-fry, grind, and cook with rice into a thick porridge.

The inner thighs grow cold, the shins become full, and pressing leaves an indentation. When turning the abdomen, a sound of shifting nodes is heard—these are its signs.\n\nIf left untreated, the body gradually swells, and the abdomen becomes fully distended. Pressing causes the flesh to rebound—by this stage, the disease has taken hold, though it may still be treated. Such conditions often arise from depletion following major illness, after diarrhea, in women post-childbirth, or when water intake is not promptly dispersed. The Triple Burner is afflicted, urination obstructed, and gradual accumulation binds together, eventually flowing into the channels and network vessels.\n\n**Remedies:**\n\n1. Take one *sheng* of *tingli* (tingli seeds), stir-fry, and pound in a mortar. Slit open a live male mandarin duck, mix its blood and head with the *tingli*, and pound ten thousand times. Form into pills the size of parasol-tree seeds, starting with five and gradually increasing to ten. Avoid salt. Regularly consume rice with adzuki beans and drink adzuki bean broth; snakehead fish is also beneficial.\n\n2.

Another formula: Six *fen* of *xionghuang* (realgar), three *fen* of *shexiang* (musk), and two *fen* each of *gansui* (kan-sui), *yuanhua* (genkwa), and *renshen* (ginseng).

As attested by Yao.\n\nOne *sheng* each of *tingli* and *jiaomu*, six *liang* of *mangxiao*, and ten *liang* of mercury. Boil the mercury in water for three days and nights, then combine and pound sixty thousand times. Form into pills the size of soybeans. Take three daily, increasing by one pill each day up to ten, then restart from one. After recovery, consume beef and mutton to restore strength, and drink in moderation.\n\nAnother formula: Gather and finely chop a large quantity of *ke* tree bark. Boil into a thick decoction and reduce until it can be formed into pills. Take three pills the size of parasol-tree seeds, then another after a short while. Water will be expelled. Later, take three pills three times daily. This tree is also called *munu* and is used by southerners to build boats.\n\nAnother formula: Equal parts genuine *suhexiang* (storax), mercury, and white lead, mixed with honey into pills. Take two pills the size of soybeans three times daily. Water will be expelled; regulate diet and rest well. If *suhexiang* is unavailable, omit it.\n\nAnother formula: Take twenty ripe castor beans, remove the skins, and grind. Mix with water to make three *ge* of liquid. Take once daily. Around midday, vomiting and diarrhea will expel accumulated water and fluids. If incomplete, take thirty beans three days later. If still incomplete, repeat the process. After recovery, regulate intake of fluids and salty foods.\n\nAnother formula: One *sheng* of adzuki beans and one white chicken, prepared as for eating. Boil in three *dou* of water until fully cooked. Consume the solids and drink the broth, gradually finishing all.\n\nAnother formula: Take a green-headed male duck and boil in five *sheng* of water until one *sheng* of broth remains. Drink gradually until finished. Cover thickly to induce sweating; this is beneficial.\n\nAnother formula: Swallow ten egg yolks from swallows’ eggs at once.\n\nAnother formula: Roast mole crickets until fully cooked and eat ten daily.\n\nAnother formula: For cases where only the abdomen is swollen, with fluid movement and gurgling sounds, and the skin turns black—this is called *water gu*. Take ninety *badou* (croton seeds), remove skins and hearts, and sixty apricot kernels, remove skins and tips. Stir-fry until yellow, pound together, and form into pills the size of small beans. Take one pill with water as needed. Wine may also be consumed; this is beneficial.\n\nAnother formula: Finely pound *guishan* (Chinese lobelia) and extract its juice. Drink an amount the size of a chicken egg to expel water, then treat the *water gu* again. Alternatively, grind hemp seeds into juice and drink.\n\nAnother formula: Boil thirty *jin* of *cimicao* (motherwort) and three *dan* of its seeds to obtain one *dan* of liquid. Strain and further reduce over heat until it can be formed into pills. Take three to five or six pills the size of *zaojia* seeds. Water will be expelled through urination; then consume thin rice porridge for nourishment.\n\nAnother formula: One large handful of white cogon grass roots and three *sheng* of adzuki beans. Boil in three *sheng* of water until dry, remove the grass roots, and eat the beans. Water will be expelled through urination.\n\nAnother formula: Ten *jin* each of *shuweicao* (common club moss) and *mabiancao* (European verbena). Boil in one *dan* of water to obtain five *dou* of liquid. Strain, further reduce, and mix with starch to form pills. Take two pills the size of soybeans, increasing to four or five. Avoid fatty meats and cold, raw foods.\n\nFor swelling and fullness: One handful of white mulberry tree bark, boiled in two *sheng* of water to obtain five *ge*. Grind two large white areca nuts into powder, add to the decoction, and boil for three to five more bubbles. Once done, add a small amount of *hongxue* (red snow) and consume. Also, under the section on swelling and fullness, formulas include drinking cow urine, *zhanglu* (pokeweed), mutton stew, and fragrant soft candies. The major formulas for the ten types of water swelling are recorded in a separate volume.\n\nIf water is only in the skin and not yet in the abdomen, take diaphoretic medicines to induce sweating for recovery. However, guard carefully against wind and cold. If only the abdomen is swollen and purgatives are ineffective, needle two *cun* below the navel, inserting several *fen* to drain the water. Stop when the puncture closes and the abdomen reduces.\n\n**Attached Formulas**\n\nFrom Li Jiang’s *Bingbu Shouji Fang*: A remedy for water disease, regardless of duration or severity, even with adverse pulses. One large *liang* each of *daji* (euphorbia), *danggui* (Chinese angelica), and *jupi* (tangerine peel). Chop and boil in one large *sheng* of water to obtain seven *ge*. Consume at once; two to three *dou* of water will be expelled. Do not be alarmed by the severity; recovery will follow after no more than two doses. Avoid toxic foods for one year. After water is expelled, take again to prevent recurrence. This formula originates from Zhang Shangke.\n\nFrom *Waitai Miyao*: For water qi. Peel and chop white *zhanglu* (pokeweed) roots into pieces the size of small beans, one large cupful. Boil in three *sheng* of water to obtain one *sheng*. Once thoroughly cooked, add one large cup of millet and cook into porridge. Consume on an empty stomach. If taken twice daily, excessive purging may occur; once daily ensures mild purgation. Avoid mixed foods.\n\nAnother remedy for water disease with swelling: Take one very large carp, remove the head, tail, and bones, retaining only the flesh. Boil with two *dou* of water and one large *sheng* of adzuki beans. Reduce to two *sheng* of liquid, strain through cloth, and consume at once. If unable to finish, divide into two doses, warming the second. After consumption, diarrhea will follow; recovery occurs once purging ceases.\n\nAnother formula: For sudden swelling and fullness. There was a case of sudden foot and leg swelling, gradually ascending to the knees, making walking impossible. Eventually, the head and face swelled, and the entire body became bloated and distended. Take the white pulp of a bitter gourd, shape into pieces the size of soybeans, wrap in dough, and boil briefly. Consume seven on an empty stomach. By midday, a *dou* of water will be expelled. For three days, water will continue to drain, leading to significant emaciation and recovery. Maintain dietary caution for three years.",
      "overlap_context": " *gancao* (licorice), and *tingli* (tingli seeds). Pound and mix with bitter wine to form pills the size of parasol-tree seeds. Take three pills, three times daily. Continue until the swelling subsides.\n\n3. Another formula: Six *fen* of *xionghuang* (realgar), three *fen* of *shexiang* (musk), and two *fen* each of *gansui* (kan-sui), *yuanhua* (genkwa), and *renshen* (ginseng).

      "translated_text": "The bitter gourd must be of fine quality—smooth, unblemished, with fine and orderly veins. If not, it is toxic and should not be used.\n\nFrom *Sheng Hui Fang*: To treat ten types of water retention in near-death cases, use half a *jin* of badger meat, sliced, with three *ge* of polished rice, three *sheng* of water, and cook into a porridge with scallions, Sichuan pepper, ginger, and fermented soybeans; consume.\n\nAnother formula: For ten types of water disease with swelling, fullness, panting, and inability to lie down, take five mole crickets, dry and grind into powder, and take half a *qianbi* to one *qian* before meals, mixed with hot water. When urination becomes unobstructed, the treatment is effective.\n\nFrom *Shi Yi Xin Jing*: To treat ten types of water disease in near-death cases, take one green-headed duck, prepare as for eating, finely chop, and cook with rice and the five flavors into a very soft porridge; consume on an empty stomach.\n\nAnother formula: For water qi distension, swelling, and scant, difficult urination, take one white duck, remove feathers and intestines, wash thoroughly, and stuff with half a *sheng* of rice, ginger, and Sichuan pepper. Sew shut, steam according to method, and consume when done.\n\nFrom *Yang Shi Chan Ru*: To treat bodily swelling, water qi urgency, and inability to lie down, take one large handful of *Prunus japonica* kernels, pound into powder, mix with wheat yeast, and form into cakes. Consume, and the bowels will promptly move, relieving qi and restoring health.\n\nFrom *Mei Shi Fang*: To treat water swelling with inability to sit or lie down, and swelling of the head, face, and entire body, take mulberry branches growing eastward, burn to ash, leach with water, and use the liquid to cook red adzuki beans. Consume on an empty stomach until full, then eat when hungry until all are finished; do not consume rice.\n\nAnother formula: For water swelling and scant urination, drink one *sheng* of yellow ox urine. Within a day and night, urination will become unobstructed, and recovery will follow. Do not consume salt.\n\nAnother formula: For water beneath the heart, take three *liang* of *Atractylodes macrocephala* and five *liang* of *Alisma*, slice, decoct in three *sheng* of water until reduced to one and a half *sheng*, and divide for consumption.\n\nFrom *Qian Jin Yi*: To treat inhibited urination and stagnant bladder water qi, dry *Spirodela polyrhiza* in the sun, grind into powder, and take one *fangcunbi* once or twice daily; effective.\n\nFrom *Jing Yan Fang*: A proven formula transmitted by the Pei family of Hedong for water swelling and sudden swelling: Pound three *liang* of *Lepidium* six thousand times until pasty, then add four *liang* of *Stephania tetrandra* powder. Take a green-headed duck, decapitate it over the mortar, allowing the blood to drip in. Once the blood is fully drained, mix in the duck’s head and pound another five thousand times. Form into pills the size of *Firmiana* seeds. For severe cases, take ten pills on an empty stomach with plain hot water; for milder cases, take five. Take frequently, stopping after five days. This medicine promotes urination with miraculous efficacy.\n\nFrom *Wei Zhou Du Xing Fang*: To treat water swelling that begins in the feet and ascends to the abdomen, which is fatal, cook one *dou* of red adzuki beans until extremely soft, take four to five *sheng* of the liquid, and soak the area below the knees in the warm broth. If the swelling has entered the abdomen, consume only the adzuki beans without other foods; this will also cure. Li Jiang’s *Bing Bu Shou Ji Fang* also records this method, which has proven effective.\n\n**Section Twenty-Six: Formulas for Sudden Abdominal Masses**\n\nFor sudden, violent masses in the abdomen resembling stone, with stabbing pain and day-and-night wailing, if left untreated, death occurs within a hundred days. Formula: Steep two *jin* of *Achyranthes* in one *dou* of wine, seal tightly in hot ashes to warm and extract the flavor. Consume from five *ge* to one *sheng*, adjusting according to strength.\n\nAnother formula: Use *Sambucus* root in the same manner; even better.\n\nYao notes: *Achyranthes* wine is divinely effective.\n\nAnother formula: Take a large quantity of *Phytolacca* root, steam and pound it, then spread on new cloth placed over the abdomen (not directly on the skin). Replace when cool; do not cease day or night.\n\nAnother formula: On the fifth day of the fifth month, take ten *jin* of bottle gourd (peeled), one *chi* and two *cun* of cinnamon, and a duck-egg-sized lump of yellow earth from a stove. Pound together, mix with bitter wine, and apply to the afflicted area with cloth. Recovery occurs within three applications.\n\nAnother formula: Burn *Poncirus* wood to ash, leach with water to obtain eight *sheng* of liquid, and use to brew one *hu* of rice into wine. Begin with half a *ge*, gradually increasing to one or two *sheng* if no effect is observed. All cases are cured before finishing one batch. This ash is also used in dyeing crimson; the leaves are used in brewing wine. *Poncirus* is pronounced *zhi ren*.\n\nGenerally, masses develop gradually. If suddenly noticed and already large and firm, they are difficult to treat. Abdominal masses and accumulations impair eating and lead to emaciation. Treatments often employ potent medicines like *Xian Bing*, *Yu Hu*, and the Eight Toxins. Here, only simple and accessible remedies are selected.\n\nTake *Polygonum cuspidatum* root (avoid those whose shadow falls on water), gather over a *dan* in weight, pound thoroughly, and decoct to extract juice for making pills. Cook five to six *sheng* of glutinous rice into porridge, mix with the medicine, and consume at midday after applying the medicine. Recovery follows.\n\nAnother formula: Take one *sheng* of the root, pound a thousand times, steep in wine, and consume three times daily, starting with a small amount. This wine treats masses better than many potent medicines.\n\nAnother formula: Burn one *dan* of silkworm droppings with mulberry firewood to ash, leach with water five times, and place a one-*chi*-long live softshell turtle in the liquid to cook until thoroughly done. Remove bones, shred finely, and decoct further until pills can be formed. Take seven pills the size of *Firmiana* seeds, three times daily.\n\nAnother formula: Pound two *liang* of *Aconitum* and three hundred Sichuan peppercorns into powder, mix with egg white, and form into pills the size of hemp seeds. Begin with one pill, gradually increasing to the size of soybeans, with a maximum of three pills per dose.\n\nAnother formula: Take one large pig’s heart, cut open and remove blood, pound into powder, and add five grains of realgar, five *Shexiang* *musk* grains, and one hundred *Croton* seeds (remove hearts and skins, use raw). Sew the heart shut, place in a small copper vessel with good wine, and decoct until the heart is submerged and nearly dissolved. Add up to three *sheng* of wine as needed, decoct until the mixture can be formed into pills the size of hemp seeds. Take three pills, three times daily.",

Boil to reduce to one *sheng*, strain, and consume in one draught to induce vomiting; this cures the condition. Originally listed among miscellaneous treatments, this ailment arises from phlegm reversal and qi surging upward in the chest and diaphragm, termed \"reversal headache.\" Vomiting provides immediate relief.\nAlternatively, cook rice into a thick gruel of two to three *sheng*, adjust to lukewarm temperature, and drink entirely. After a short while, induce vomiting; once vomiting ceases, drink again. Repeat several times. In severe cases, continue until bile is vomited.

First pound *badou* into a paste, then add *lilu* powder and pound ten thousand times. Form into honey pills the size of sesame seeds. Take one to two or three pills.\nThe disease of the diaphragm is termed *gaohuang* (vital region). Decoctions and pills pass through directly, while acupuncture and moxibustion cannot reach it.

This governs shortness of breath, chest fullness, hardness beneath the heart, and cold qi.\nThere are over ten formulas for this condition, most being similar. This pill is the most effective. Though its ingredients are numerous, it does not align with the names of the five diaphragms—*youge* (worry diaphragm), *qige* (qi diaphragm), *huige* (anger diaphragm), and *hange* (cold diaphragm)—each with distinct diagnostic signs. In the major formulas, there is also *Qiqi Fang* (Seven Qi Formula), largely similar with minor differences.\n\n**Supplementary Formulas**\n\nFrom *Shenghui Fang*: Formula for Phlegm Reversal Headache.\nTake the flesh of ten *wumei*, two *qian* of salt, and one *zhongzhan* of wine.

      "translated_text": "From *Qianjin Yifang*: On treating phlegm-rheum with spontaneous vomiting of water. When cold drinks are consumed excessively, the spleen and stomach become weakened in qi, unable to digest food and drink. Whatever enters the stomach transforms into cold water and is incessantly vomited. **Red Halloysite Powder** governs this. Take one *jin* of *red halloysite*, pound and sift, and take one *fangcunbi* with wine or water as preferred. Gradually increase to three *bi*; upon finishing one *jin*, one will never again vomit clear water, nor suffer from diarrhea, and the five viscera will be fortified, rendering the person robust and healthy. There was a case of phlegm-rheum unresponsive to various remedies, which was cured by this formula.\n\nFrom *Imperial Pharmacy Formulary*: **True Ancestor’s Elixir**, bestowed by Emperor Zhenzong upon the Grand Chancellor Gao, dispels phlegm, clears the eyes, and stimulates appetite. Take ten *liang* of *Sichuan lovage rhizome* (chuanxiong), selecting the firm and small pieces, soak in a clay pot with millet water for three days, changing the water daily, then slice and dry in the sun. Grind to powder and divide into two portions. To each portion add one *fen* each of musk and borneol, and half a *liang* of *raw rhinoceros horn*, boiled in a double boiler. Knead with honey into pills the size of small marbles. Chew and swallow one pill with tea or wine.\n- For phlegm, add half a *liang* of *cinnabar*;\n- For thoracic congestion, add one *fen* each of *cow-bezoar* and *water-floated iron powder*;\n- For dizziness and blurred vision, add one *fen* of *asarum*;\n- For facial paralysis, add one *fen* of *blast-fried arisaema*.\n\nAnother formula for thoracic congestion with wind-phlegm: Take any quantity of *pinellia*, soak in sour juice overnight, then wash five to seven times in warm water to remove the foul odor. Dry in the sun, pound to powder, and mix with fermented millet water into cakes. Dry in the sun, then grind to powder again. For every five *liang*, add one *qian* of *raw borneol*, grind evenly, and use thick fermented millet water to form pills the size of *chicken’s heads*. Store in a gauze bag in a well-ventilated, shaded place to dry. Take one pill with good tea or peppermint decoction.\n\nFrom Wang’s *Boji*: For disharmony of the triple burner qi, thoracic congestion, dizziness, blurred vision, copious phlegm and saliva, and mental lethargy. **Diaphragm-Freeing Pill**: Take four *liang* of *pharbitis seed*, half raw and half parched, and two *liang* of *Gleditsia sinensis* (unworm-eaten, coated with butter and roasted). Grind to powder, boil with fresh ginger juice, and form into pills the size of *tung seeds*. Take twenty pills with *schizonepeta* decoction.\n\nFrom *Tested Later Formulas*: For head wind transforming phlegm. Take any quantity of *Sichuan lovage rhizome*, wash clean, soak, slice thinly, and dry in the sun or bake. Pound to powder and form into pills with refined honey the size of small marbles. Chew and swallow at any time with tea or wine.\n\nAnother formula for wind-phlegm: Take one *fen* of *curcuma* and ten *fen* of *veratrum*, grind each to powder, mix evenly, and take one *zi* with a cup of warm fermented millet water. First dissolve a small amount in the water, then swallow the rest, rinsing the mouth with the remaining water. Follow with food to press it down.\n\nFrom *Waitai Miyao*: For all wind-phlegm, wind cholera, indigestion, and constipation. Take three *myrobalan* fruits, pound to powder, and take all at once with wine three to five times; effective.\n\nFrom *Shengjin Fang*: For wind-phlegm. Take seven *white stiff silkworms* (straight ones), grind finely, and administer with one *chabiao* of ginger juice mixed with warm water.\n\nAnother formula for wind-phlegm: Grind *radish seeds* to powder and take one spoonful with warm water. After a while, phlegm and foam will be vomited. For paralysis and slack wind, follow this emetic with a purgative, then take a qi-harmonizing powder to recover.\n\nFrom *Doumen Fang*: For thoracic congestion and stagnation, dispelling phlegm and opening the stomach. Wash *pinellia* clean, bake dry, and pound to powder. Mix with fresh ginger juice into cakes, wrap in damp paper, and bake over a slow fire until fragrant. Boil one cake the size of a marble in two cups of water with half a *qian* of salt, reducing to one cup. Take warm to dispel thoracic congestion and counterflow, strongly suppress phlegm toxin, and treat damage from alcohol and food; highly effective.\n\n**Formula Twenty-Nine for Sudden Thoracic Impediment Pain**\nThoracic impediment causes the heart to feel firm, stuffy, and suddenly painful, with the muscles suffering from numbness and tightness as if stabbed, preventing bending or stretching.

A divine formula from *Zhang Ji*.\n- Another formula: Take one *fen* each of *cinnamon*, *aconite*, and *dried ginger*, and two *fen* each of *ginseng*, *asarum*, *evodia*, and *fritillaria*. Pound together, mix with honey, and form into pills the size of small beans. Take three pills three times daily.\n- If the condition relapses after recovery: Pound five *jin* of *leek roots*, extract the juice, and drink to cure.\n\n**Supplementary Formulas**\n*Du Ren’s* treatment for chest and diaphragm pain radiating to the back, abdominal fullness and distension with obstructed qi, and phlegm cough.",

During the Zhenguan era, the imperial physicians Xu and his brothers, as well as the renowned doctors of the Chai and Jiang families, were summoned to treat me. They exhausted their skills, yet none could cure me. I grew increasingly emaciated, and death seemed imminent. Then, a guard mentioned: \"Drinking donkey urine is highly effective.\" I took two *ge* at dawn, and afterward, only half of my food was vomited. At dusk, I took another two *ge*, and by the first watch of the night, when I ate porridge, the vomiting ceased. By noon the next day, I reported this to the palace, where five or six others suffering from regurgitation were also cured after taking it together. This remedy is slightly toxic—do not exceed the dosage. Collect fresh, warm urine and take two *ge*. For severe cases of seven days or more, it works well. Many have since been cured with this method.\n\nAnother formula: For vomiting.\nTake three *liang* of hemp seeds, pound, stir-fry, and extract the juice with water. Add a pinch of salt and consume. Instantly effective. Highly praised by Advisor Li.\n\nAnother formula: For chronic coughing fits with forty or fifty consecutive coughs.\nTake half a *ge* of fresh ginger juice and one spoonful of honey, decoct until thick, and take warm. Three doses will bring immediate relief.\n\nAnother formula: For coughing.\nTake four *liang* of fresh ginger (crushed), two *liang* of *lanxiang* leaves, one *qianbi* of pepper powder, and four *liang* of salted flour. Wrap the mixture in dough, bake into a flatbread, and consume on an empty stomach. No more than two or three doses are needed for efficacy.\n\nFrom *Sun Shangyao’s Formulas*: For all types of hiccups.\nTake two *liang* of tangerine peel (soaked in hot water to remove the pith, chopped), decoct in one *sheng* of water until five *ge* remain, and take hot in one dose. For greater effect, add one *liang* of *zhike* (remove pith, stir-fry) and decoct together.\n\nFrom *Master Mei’s Formulas*: For stomach regurgitation, where food eaten in the morning is vomited in the evening, or food eaten in the evening is vomited in the morning, or vomiting occurs shortly after eating.\nMix seven *sheng* of sugarcane juice with one *sheng* of fresh ginger juice. Divide into three doses.\n\nAnother formula: For acid reflux.\nTake four *liang* of areca nut and two *liang* of tangerine peel, grind finely into powder, and take one *fangcunbi* on an empty stomach with raw honey water.\n\nFrom *The Military Ministry’s Handbook*: For acid reflux, where sour *qi* rises like strong vinegar.\nTake one *ge* of evodia fruit, decoct in three *zhong* of water until seven *fen* remain, and take in one dose. Even if the decoction is strong, it must be consumed. Recently, a man whose heart felt as if stung by a bee took this formula and remained free of symptoms for twenty years.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: Sudden Onset of Jaundice and Various Yellow Diseases**\n\n**Formulas for Jaundice:**\nTake five *sheng* of turnip seeds, pound and sift, and take one *fangcunbi* three times daily. Recovery occurs within ten days.\n\nAnother formula: Burn human hair and take one *qianbi* three times daily.\n\nSecret formula for jaundice.\n\nAnother formula: Pound fresh wheat seedlings, mix with water, and extract the juice.

This treats alcohol-induced jaundice.\n\nAnother formula: Roast *lilu* in ashes until slightly discolored, pound, sift, and take half a *qianbi*. Mild vomiting may occur, but no more than a few doses are needed. This is a secret formula.\n\nAnother formula: Take two *fen* each of small beans, glutinous rice, and white chicken droppings, pound, sift, and divide into three doses. Yellow fluid will be discharged. This universally treats yellowing of the face and eyes, bringing immediate relief.\n\nThere are five types of jaundice: yellow jaundice, grain jaundice, alcohol jaundice, female jaundice, and taxation jaundice.\n\n**For yellow sweat:** When the body and limbs are slightly swollen, the chest is full, and no sweat is produced—or sweat appears like the juice of *huangbo*—caused by sudden immersion in water after profuse sweating.\nTake one *jin* of hot lard, consume warm, three times daily.

Burn the antler until red-hot, then steep it in the wine overnight. Drink the infusion.\n\n**From Cui Yuanliang’s *Haishang Fang* for Cold Wind Qi in the Lumbar and Legs:**\nCut two large *liang* of rhubarb into pieces the size of *weiqi* stones, stir-fry with a small amount of *su* (ghee) until the *su* is fully absorbed. Take care not to scorch the rhubarb, as this will diminish its potency. Grind into powder and sift. Each day, on an empty stomach, boil three *ge* of water with two coin-sized slices of fresh ginger for over ten simmers. Remove the ginger, then take two *qian* of rhubarb powder, place it in a separate bowl, and mix with the ginger decoction. Consume in one draught. If any ginger decoction remains, sip it slowly until finished. This will purge copious cold pus and foul matter, and the ailment will be cured upon cessation.\n\nAncient physicians used potent medicines to attack illnesses, always adjusting dosages according to the patient’s strength and condition—they did not apply them indiscriminately. When Yao Sengyuan first served at court, Emperor Wu of Liang developed a fever and wished to take rhubarb. Sengyuan advised, “Rhubarb is a swift-acting purgative; Your Majesty is advanced in years and should not use it lightly.” The emperor disregarded his counsel and nearly collapsed. Later, Emperor Yuan suffered from a thoracic and abdominal ailment. All the physicians insisted that mild medicines should be used gradually to harmonize and unblock. Sengyuan, however, declared, “The pulse is surging and replete—this indicates retained food. Without rhubarb, there is no hope of recovery.” The emperor followed his advice and recovered.\n\nFrom this, we see that modern physicians often use a single potent medicine to treat myriad illnesses. When they happen to cure a condition, they deem the formula miraculous, yet when they err, they never acknowledge their misapplication of the medicine.

      "translated_text": "**Additional Prescriptions**\n\nFrom *The Heart Mirror of Food as Medicine*:\n**For cold spleen-stomach qi preventing food intake, weakness, and lack of strength—Hútú Soup:**\nFinely chop half a *jin* of crucian carp, prepare as raw fish slices, and steep in boiling fermented black soybean broth. Add powdered black pepper, dried ginger, dill, and tangerine peel. Consume on an empty stomach.\n\nFrom *Recent Prescriptions*:\n**For chronic spleen-stomach deficiency-cold leading to anorexia, prolonged emaciation, and consumptive weakness:**\nUse Wenzhou white dried ginger as the sole ingredient. Boil in fermented rice water until thoroughly permeated, then remove, moisten, and dry. Pound and sift, then cook with aged granary rice into a porridge. Form into *tongzi*-sized pills. Take thirty to fifty pills per dose, as needed; the effect is divine.\n\nFrom *Dietary Therapy*:\n**For stomach qi deficiency with wind-heat preventing food intake:**\nMix half a chicken-egg shell’s worth of fresh ginger juice, a small amount of fresh rehmannia juice, and one spoonful of honey with three *ge* of water. Consume in one dose; immediate relief follows.\n\nFrom *Tested Prescriptions*:\n**For intolerable intermittent pain in the spleen’s original qi:**\nStir-fry one *liang* of evodia fruit with one *liang* of peach kernels until the evodia turns charred black. Discard the evodia, remove the peach kernels’ skins and tips, and grind finely. Stew three scallion stalks until soft, soak in wine, and divide into two warm doses.\n\nFrom *Later Tested Prescriptions*:\n**For promoting spleen-stomach food intake:**\nPound two *liang* of fennel seeds and four *liang* of fresh ginger evenly together. Store in a clean vessel, cover with damp paper, and leave overnight. The next day, stir-fry in a silver or stone vessel over gentle heat until yellow and crisp. Grind into powder, form into *wutong*-sized wine pills, and take ten to fifteen pills per dose with tea or wine.\n\nFrom *Arcane Essentials from the Imperial Library*:\n**For chronic qi distension:**\nConsume one *sheng* of black ox urine warm on an empty stomach, once daily. Discontinue once the qi disperses.\n\n---\n\n**Prescription Thirty-Five: For Sudden Famine, Starvation, and Near-Death Exhaustion**\nGrain is the sustenance of life; deprivation for several days can prove fatal. While *The Divine Farmer’s Classic* describes methods to stave off hunger, medical texts seldom address such techniques, likely because they border on the realm of immortals and transcend common practice. Thus, in years of famine, corpses lie strewn across the roads—truly lamentable.\n\nHere, I record only the most accessible methods. If stranded in a desolate wilderness, fallen into a ravine, deep well, or ancient tomb, with no hope of rescue, one must drink water and practice qi absorption. The method is as follows:\n\nClose the mouth, stir the tongue against the upper and lower teeth to generate saliva, and swallow it. Three hundred and sixty swallows per day are ideal; with practice, one may reach a thousand, naturally eliminating hunger. Initial fatigue may arise for three to five days, but thereafter, strength gradually returns.\n\nOther methods, such as consuming the six *wu* hours of the twelve Earthly Branches, are omitted here, as one in dire straits may struggle to discern directions or time.\n\nIf water is available but no vessel, cup it in the left hand and recite: *\"By the grace of the attending officials, true famine strikes. The correct red-yellow path avoids passing beneath city walls. Physicians, take heed for yourselves.\"* Conclude by tapping the teeth three times, then tapping the left hand three times with the right hand. Repeat this thrice, then drink. If a cup is later obtained, store water in it, hold it in the left hand, and tap it with an object in the right hand as before. Drinking three *sheng* daily will prevent hunger and restore health.\n\nIf able to traverse mountains and marshes:\nGather pine or cypress leaves, finely chop, and consume two *ge* with water, two to three *sheng* at midday. Alternatively, dig and wash white cogon grass roots, chop, and consume. These three substances may be sun-dried, pounded on stone, and taken in *fangcunbi* doses to sustain for a day.\n\nIf soybeans are available, roast until hot, then consume with water until sated; this provides relief for ten days. Red small beans are also effective. Roast both beans until yellow, grind into powder, and consume one to two *sheng* to sustain for ten days.\n\nAmong herbs, *atractylodes*, asparagus root, *ophiopogon*, Solomon’s seal, and fritillaria may be eaten raw or cooked, alone or together. Tree fungi, sandalwood, and white elm bark also stave off hunger.\n\nIn times of famine when grain is scarce and life depends on medicinal aid:\nTake one *dou* of rice, wash thoroughly, steam and sun-dry it a hundred times, then pound. Consume once daily with water for thirty days; thereafter, one may abstain from food entirely while traveling three hundred *li* daily.\n\nAnother method: Soak one *dou* of non-glutinous rice in three *sheng* of wine, remove and sun-dry, then soak again until the wine is exhausted. Consume gradually, drinking when thirsty, to sustain for thirty days. One *hu* and two *sheng* suffice for a year.\n\nThere is also the *Guard the Center Pill* method. The above methods using rice and beans are easily obtained and prepared, harmonizing with grain qi to preserve strength without depletion. However, those of impure constitution may struggle with prolonged medicinal reliance; if possible, alternate with grains.\n\nRefer to my *Grain Prescriptions* for further details.\n\n**Additional Prescriptions**\n\nFrom *Imperial Grace Formulary*:\n**Method for Grain Abstinence and Immortal Ascension:**\nPound pine nuts into a paste, mix three *qian* with wine, and consume thrice daily to eliminate hunger. Drink water when thirsty, avoiding other foods. After a hundred days, the body becomes light, capable of traveling five hundred *li* daily.\n\nFrom *Leisure Talks of a Rustic*:\n**Master Fuhu’s Pine Resin Refinement Method:**\nBoil ten *jin* of pine resin in water five times to remove bitterness. For each *jin* of refined resin, mix with four *liang* of poria powder. Take one *daogui* each morning with water to abstain from food for a year, extending lifespan with a light, clear body.",

      "translated_text": "The *Xiaopin* states this formula is excellent.\n\n**Yao’s Breast Carbuncle Remedy:**\nTake one *fen* each of *dahuang* (rhubarb), moistened rat droppings, and *huanglian* (coptis). Grind the first two ingredients into powder, then pound the rat droppings again. Mix with millet porridge water and apply around the breast. The pain will cease, and the condition will heal. If millet is unavailable, polished rice may be used instead.\n\nAnother remedy: Apply cow or horse dung, both effective. These methods resolve the swelling.\n\n**Jealousy Breast Formula from the *Xiaopin*:**\nGrind equal parts of *huangqin* (scutellaria), *bailian* (ampelopsis), and *shaoyao* (peony) into powder, sift, and take one *qianbi* with fermented grain water, five times daily. If the right breast is swollen, consume milk from the left breast; if the left breast is swollen, consume milk from the right breast. This will disperse the root of the swelling. Yao’s formula is identical and guarantees a cure.\n\n**Yao’s Remedy:**\nPound fresh *dihuang* (rehmannia) and apply; replace when warm. Red beans are also effective.\n\nAnother note: If hundreds of treatments fail and the swelling remains hard and purple, use the earlier willow root bark method—heat until warm and apply to the swelling. It will heal overnight.\n\n**General Note:**\nIf breast milk is not expelled and congeals internally, it is called \"jealousy breast,\" which is more urgent than carbuncle.\n\n**Xu Yu’s Remedy for Painful Breast Nodules:**\nTake three *liang* each of *dahuang* (rhubarb) and *huanglian* (coptis). Boil in five *sheng* of water until reduced to one *sheng* and two *ge*. Divide into three doses; purgation will bring immediate healing.\n\n**Ge’s Sudden Toxic Swelling Remedy:**\nPeel and finely pound a large *wujing* (turnip) root, mix with bitter wine to a paste, boil briefly, stir rapidly, and apply to the swelling. Wrap with silk and replace two or three times daily. The seeds are also effective.\n\nAnother remedy: Burn cow dung into ash, mix with bitter wine, and apply. Replace when dry.\n\nAnother: Mix lime with water and seal the swelling.\n\nAnother: Grind *shengma* (cimicifuga), *qingmuxiang* (aristolochia), or *zitan* (red sandalwood) with bitter wine and apply. Excellent results.\n\nAnother: Pound water pepper thoroughly and apply.\n\n**For Swelling That Has Entered the Abdomen:**\nTake one *liang* each of *shexiang* (musk), *xunluxiang* (frankincense), *qingmuxiang* (aristolochia), and *jishexiang* (clove). Boil in four *sheng* of water until reduced to two *sheng*. Divide into two doses.\n\n**For Stubborn Hard Swellings:**\nPound equal parts of *wuzhuyu* (evodia) and *xiaosuan* (garlic) and apply. Red garlic is also effective.\n\nAnother remedy: Pound crucian carp and apply.\n\n**For Wind Swelling with Itching (Rising When Pressed or Hidden Rashes):**\nSimply press and rub the area vigorously several times daily; it will resolve.\n\nAnother: Grind *gui* (cinnamon) or *duhuo* (angelica) with bitter wine and apply repeatedly. Excellent results.\n\n**For Sudden Swelling on the Body or Face (Like Inflation):**\nCrush thirty *badou* (croton seeds) with their skins, boil in five *sheng* of water until reduced to three *sheng*, strain, and dip cotton to wipe the swelling. It will vanish immediately—avoid contact with the mouth.\n\n**For Sudden Red, Painful, Narrow, Elongated Swelling (Called *Yong*):**\nTake five *liang* of deer antler, one *liang* of *bailian* (ampelopsis), four *liang* of *muli* (oyster shell), and one *liang* of *fuzi* (aconite). Grind, sift, mix with bitter wine, and apply to silk. Replace when dry.\n\n**For Stone-like Carbuncle (Hard as Rock or Large Nodules, Unchanged in Color, or Stone Carbuncle That Does Not Resolve):**\nBurn eight *liang* of deer antler to ash, take two *liang* of coarse, yellow *bailian* (ampelopsis), and one *jin* of whetstone (burn until red). Grind all into powder, mix with bitter wine to a thick paste, and apply to the carbuncle. Reapply when dry until resolved. Administer *lianqiao* (forsythia) decoction internally.\n\n**Yao’s Method:**\nBurn the stone until extremely red, then quench in five *sheng* of bitter wine. Repeat until the wine is reduced by half. Pound the stone and mix with the medicine. Use the remaining wine first; if insufficient, add more.\n\n**Yao’s Note:**\nIf the swelling is extremely hard with a root, it is called \"stone carbuncle.\" Moxibustion with one hundred cones should be applied to the top; the stone will fragment and emerge. If it does not, increase the moxa.\n\n**General Warning:**\nCarbuncles, deep-rooted sores, tumors, stone carbuncles, tendon nodules, and scrofula must never be treated with needles or cupping. Such methods often lead to disaster.\n\n**For Unruptured Carbuncles:**\nGrind *wancao* (sweet flag) into powder, mix with egg white, and apply thickly to paper. Replace when dry; the pain will subside.\n\n**For Severe, Throbbing Carbuncle Swelling:**\nGrind *dahuang* (rhubarb), sift, mix with bitter wine, and apply to the swelling. Replace when dry; within three applications, the swelling will reduce, no pus will form, and it will resolve. Extremely effective.\n\n**For Unformed Carbuncle Pus:**\nApply earwax from a cow; it will heal immediately. If necrotic flesh remains, use a flesh-dissolving remedy, then apply ointment for healing.\n\n**Flesh-Dissolving Formula:**\nTake equal parts of white charcoal ash and *dihui* (reed ash), boil to a paste. Do not prepare in advance—it loses efficacy after ten days. Also effective for removing moles.\n\n**General Carbuncle Formula:**\nSoak *gualou* (trichosanthes) root and red adzuki beans in bitter wine for five days, then dry, roast, and grind into powder. Mix with bitter wine, apply to paper, and affix to the swelling. Effective.\n\n**Hidden Resident’s Effective Formula for Resolving Carbuncles:**\nGrind two parts *bailian* (ampelopsis) and one part *lilu* (veratrum) into powder, mix with wine to a paste, and apply three times daily. Highly effective.\n\n**For Bone-Exposing Sores:**\nGrind two *fen* each of *huanglian* (coptis) and *muli* (oyster shell) into powder. First wash with salted wine, then apply.\n\n**Ge’s Sudden *Biaoju* Sores (Clustering Like Grains on Hands, Feet, or Shoulders, Oozing Fluid):**\nRoast and pound *wujing* (turnip), wrap, and apply while rolling over the sores day and night without ceasing.\n\n**For Deep-Rooted Sores at the Fingertips (Red-Black, Difficult to Treat):**\nFollow major formulas; simple remedies are insufficient.\n\n**For Chronic Bone Carbuncles (Oozing Fluid When Pressed, Unhealed for Years):**\nHeat maltose and apply to the sore, then press a fresh crucian carp onto it. After the time it takes to cook rice, scrape and inspect—small worms will emerge. Wash and reapply the medicine until the worms are gone; healing will follow.",
      "overlap_context": "emedy:**\nTake two *fen* each of *dahuang* (rhubarb), *lancao* (orchid grass), and *fulonggan* (yellow earth from beneath a stove), and two *fen* of fresh ginger. First, pound and sift the first three ingredients, then combine with ginger and pound again. Mix with vinegar and apply. The breast pain will cease. Extremely effective. Liu Juanzi omits the ginger.\nAnother version uses four *fen* of fresh ginger in equal parts. Elsewhere, it is recorded that using crucian carp yields immediate results.",

      "translated_text": "**Yao’s Formula on *Biaoju* (Flame Carbuncle):**\n*Biaoju* arises suddenly in the flesh as a dark nodule, the size of a bean or grain. In severe cases, it may grow as large as a plum, appearing red, black, white, or green. The lesion contains a core with deep roots, and after a brief period, the surrounding area swells entirely. The blisters turn dusky, purplish-black, capable of rotting sinews and bones. If the toxin enters the viscera, it may prove fatal. In the South, it is called *tuozhu* (clinging toxin). Where it afflicts thick flesh, excise it, then cauterize with red-hot iron three times until charred like charcoal. Alternatively, apply moxibustion directly on the dark core, one hundred cones for best effect. In early spring, layer *suanmo* leaves around the lesion to prevent spread. Drink juices of *kuigen* (mallow root), *xijiao* (rhinoceros horn), and *shengma* (cimicifuga) to purge internal and external heat. The treatment follows the method for *dandu* (cinnabar toxin).\n\n**Liu Juanzi’s Yellow Qi Paste for Suppurating Carbuncles (Draining Pus and Blood, Promoting Flesh):**\n*Huangqi* (astragalus), *shaoyao* (peony), *dahuang* (rhubarb), *danggui* (angelica), *xiongqiong* (ligusticum), *duhuo* (angelica pubescens), *baizhi* (angelica dahurica), *xiebai* (Chinese chive), each one *liang*; *shengdihuang* (fresh rehmannia), three *liang*. Chop the nine ingredients, simmer in two and a half *sheng* of lard, stirring thrice up and thrice down. When the paste forms, strain and discard the dregs. Apply to the sore, massaging the surrounding area, three times daily.\n\n**Decoction for *Danyong* (Cinnabar Carbuncle) at Onset (Spreading and Enlarging, Including Minor *Dan Tuo* in Children):**\n*Shengma* (cimicifuga), *huanglian* (coptis), *dahuang* (rhubarb), *xiongqiong* (ligusticum), each two *liang*; *huangqin* (scutellaria), *mangxiao* (mirabilite), each three *liang*; *danggui* (angelica), *zhigancao* (honey-fried licorice), *lingyangjiao* (antelope horn), each one *liang*. Chop the nine ingredients, boil in one *dou* and three *sheng* of water to five *sheng*, strain, return to the pot, and stir in *mangxiao* with a wooden stick until a paste forms. Adjust temperature, spread on cloth, and apply to the swelling. Repeat until the swelling dissipates. This is Wang Lian’s secret formula from Ganlin—take care to avoid the genitals.\n\n**Hu Powder for *Biaochuang* (Flame Sores, Spreading with Copious Discharge):**\nRoast *hufen* (lead powder), *zhigancao* (honey-fried licorice), *qianru* (rubia), and *huanglian* (coptis), each two *fen*. Grind into powder, sift, and dust onto the sore thrice daily. Highly effective.\n\n**Paste for All Carbuncle Sores:**\nWax, *luanfa* (human hair), *fanshi* (alum), *songzhi* (pine resin), each one *liang*; lard, four *liang*. First melt the hair, then add alum when the hair dissolves. When the alum dissolves, add pine resin; when the resin dissolves, add wax; when the wax dissolves, add lard. Apply to the sore.\n\n**Red Dragon Skin Decoction for Washing Putrid, Festering Sores:**\nChop three *sheng* of *hushupi* (oak bark), boil in one *dou* of water to five *sheng*. Use cold in spring and summer, warm in autumn and winter. Wash breast sores and all putrid sores, then apply paste.\n\n**Rhubarb Decoction for Early Pain in *Fabei* (Carbuncle on the Back):**\n*Dahuang* (rhubarb), *zhigancao* (honey-fried licorice), *huangqin* (scutellaria), each two *liang*; *shengma* (cimicifuga), two *liang*; *zhizi* (gardenia), one hundred pieces. Boil the five ingredients in nine *sheng* of water to three and a half *sheng*. Drink until several bowel movements occur, then stop. If no movement, take again.\n\n**Mu Zhansi Powder for *Fabei* (Back Carbuncle), *Faru* (Breast Carbuncle in Women), and *Changyong* (Intestinal Carbuncle):**\n*Muzhansi* (aralia), *zhihoupo* (honey-fried magnolia bark), *zhigancao* (honey-fried licorice), *xixin* (asarum), *gualou* (trichosanthes), *fangfeng* (saposhnikovia), *ganjiang* (dried ginger), *renshen* (ginseng), *jiegeng* (platycodon), *baijiang* (patrinia), each one *liang*. Grind into powder, take one *fangcunbi* with wine, seven times by day and four by night—more is better. If the affliction is above, vomiting occurs; if below, pus and blood discharge. This pertains to *changyong* (intestinal carbuncle), where the swelling is painless. Long-term use treats all carbuncles and hemorrhoids. If the sore has already ulcerated, healing is swift. No *fabei* (back carbuncle) is incurable, and the swelling resolves unnoticed. For prolonged use, omit *baijiang* (patrinia), which is especially effective for *faru* (breast carbuncle), postpartum conditions, and abdominal masses in women. All are Liu Juanzi’s formulas.\n\n**Liu Juanzi’s Mu Zhansi Powder for Dissolving Pus in Carbuncles:**\n*Muzhansi* (aralia), *guixin* (cinnamon bark), *renshen* (ginseng), *xixin* (asarum), *baijiang* (patrinia), *ganjiang* (dried ginger), *zhihoupo* (honey-fried magnolia bark), *zhigancao* (honey-fried licorice), *fangfeng* (saposhnikovia), *jiegeng* (platycodon), each one *liang*. Grind into powder, take one *fangcunbi*. Upon swallowing, one feels it flow into the sore. If the carbuncle has been cauterized but not ulcerated, it may be taken. If the sore has not ulcerated, omit *baijiang*. Occasionally, this formula may reduce a carbuncle to water.\n\n**Bailian Paste for Unresolved *Yong* Swellings, Scrofula, and Nodules:**\n*Bailian* (ampelopsis), *huanglian* (coptis), *dahuang* (rhubarb), *huangqin* (scutellaria), *wangcao* (lithospermum), *chishizhi* (red halloysite), *wuzhuyu* (evodia), *shaoyao* (peony), each four *fen*. Grind, sift, and mix with egg white into a paste. Spread on old cloth and apply, leaving a small opening. Replace when dry. Heals.\n\n**For Life-Threatening *Fabei* (Back Carbuncle):**\nTake a winter melon, cut off the top, and place it over the sore. When the melon rots, cut it away and replace. Before the melon is exhausted, the sore will have contracted—then nourish with paste.\n\n**Alternative Formula:**\nGrind *fulonggan* (furnace earth) into powder, mix with wine, and apply thickly to the sore. Replace when dry; recovery follows swiftly.\n\n**Another Formula:**\nToast *wutongziye* (paulownia leaves) on a griddle until charred, sift through silk, mix with honey, and apply. Replace when dry.\n\n**Miscellaneous Effective Formulas for *Yong* Swellings (Treating Heat Swellings):**\nPound *jiazi* (mustard seeds) with *baiye* (cypress leaves) and apply—universally effective. Wild mustard is even better.\n\n**Another Formula:**\nGrind *xiaojiezi* (small mustard seeds) into powder, mix with vinegar into cakes, and apply to swellings or scrofula. Check frequently; stop when the swelling subsides to avoid damaging flesh. Effective for *mafugu* (horse bone carbuncle).\n\n**Another Formula:**\nBurn human feces into ash, mix with vinegar into a paste, and apply to the swelling. Replace when dry—highly effective.\n\n**Another Formula:**\nTake yellow *xionghuang* (realgar) and *cihuang* (orpiment), heat until red, then douse with strong vinegar. Reheat and douse again until the stones soften like mud. Scrape and apply to the swelling; if dry, mix with vinegar. This is a great secret.\n\n**Method to Resolve Swellings with Moxibustion:**\nSlice a single garlic clove crosswise to a thickness of one *fen*, place on the swelling’s head, and apply moxa cones the size of *wutongzi* (paulownia seeds), one hundred cones. If no reduction is felt, repeat frequently—more is better. Avoid excessive heat; if pain is felt, lift the garlic. Replace charred garlic with fresh. Do not burn the skin or flesh. If the body is dry, moxibustion is unnecessary.",

      "translated_text": "I have once suffered from a large swelling below the lower abdomen, and moxibustion cured it. Whenever I use this method, it proves highly effective.\n\n**Another Formula:**\nTake the kernel from the head of fresh ginseng [text unclear], or mix magnetite powder with vinegar and apply.\n\n**Another Formula:**\nApply licorice [text unclear] to this swelling—do not ingest the plantain seed.\n\n**Another Formula:**\nApply chicken-intestine herb.\n\n**Another Formula:**\nApply white *bai lian* (ampelopsis) powder—also effective.\n\n**For Hot Swellings and Boils:**\nApply roasted glue repeatedly, ten or more times a day, and it will resolve. Especially effective for treating boils in children, with divine results each time.\n\n**For All Toxic Swellings with Unbearable Pain:**\nKnead dough into a round piece the size of a coin, fill it with Sichuan peppercorns, cover the swelling’s head with the dough cake, and apply moxibustion until the pain penetrates—this will immediately stop the pain.\n\n**Another Formula:**\nPound castor bean and apply—immediate relief.\n\n**For Wind-Toxin Swellings on Palms and Soles:**\nMix equal parts ground Sichuan pepper and salt with vinegar, and apply—it will resolve.\n\n**For Carbuncles with Foul, Rotten Flesh:**\nApply white *lan ru* (Solanum) powder. When the flesh is gone, stop and apply other ointments. If flesh does not regenerate, apply astragalus powder. *Lan ru* and astragalus halt all malignant flesh. If the flesh persists, use seven heads of red-skinned *lan ru* ground into powder—take half a *qianbi* and mix with three *qianbi* of white *lan ru* powder to apply. This is Yao’s formula, and it heals.\n\n**For Malignant Vessel Disease:**\nSuddenly, red vessels resembling earthworms appear on the body. This arises from evil wind entering the collaterals in spring or winter, causing blood stasis. Take *Five Fragrances and Forsythia Decoction*, lance to remove blood, and apply *Red Sage Ointment*—it will heal after some days. When I crossed mountains and ridges, I suffered from this and regularly took *Five Fragrances Decoction*, applying mung beans to reduce the swelling. The following are all Yao’s formulas.\n\n**For Malignant Nodule Disease:**\nSuddenly, nodules like plums or apricots appear in the flesh, or small ones like soybeans, with sharp pain moving beneath the skin, accompanied by fever and chills. This disease arises abruptly; if the toxin enters the abdomen, it can kill. This affliction is common in the south. Take *Five Fragrances and Forsythia Decoction* and apply mung beans—it will resolve immediately. For children, applying *Red Sage Ointment* is also effective.\n\n**For Malignant Flesh Disease:**\nSuddenly, flesh like red adzuki beans protrudes from the body, growing into shapes like cow or horse udders or rooster combs. Take *Rhaponticum Decoction* internally, and externally cauterize with a heated iron, three times daily, until slightly charred. Apply *Cimicifuga Ointment*.\n\n**For Qi Pain Disease:**\nSuddenly, a localized pain like a blow appears in the body, unbearable and wandering, flaring up intermittently. When the pain subsides, the area feels cold as if touched by frost or snow. This arises from sudden cold injuring the body during winter warmth extending into spring. First take several doses of *Five Fragrances and Forsythia Decoction*. Also, boil willow bark in white wine and apply warm compresses. Where red spots appear, lance to remove blood.\n\n**Five Fragrances and Forsythia Decoction:**\nTreats malignant flesh, malignant vessels, malignant nodules, scrofula, wind-binding swellings, and qi pain.\n*Costus root, eaglewood, clove* (each 2 *liang*), *musk* (0.5 *liang*), *frankincense* (1 *liang*), *belamcanda rhizome, Chinese knotweed, cimicifuga, pubescent angelica, mistletoe, roasted licorice, forsythia* (each 2 *liang*), *rhubarb* (3 *liang*), *bamboo sap* (3 *sheng*). Boil the thirteen ingredients in 9 *sheng* of water until reduced by half, add 3 *sheng* of bamboo sap, and divide into three doses. Highly effective.\n\n**Rhaponticum Decoction:**\nTreats carbuncles, cinnabar toxins, swellings, and malignant flesh.\n*Rhaponticum, white ampelopsis, scutellaria, white swallowwort, roasted immature orange fruit, cimicifuga, roasted licorice, peony, ephedra* (nodes removed, each 2 *liang*), *rhubarb* (3 *liang*). Boil the ten ingredients in 1 *dou* of water to yield 3 *sheng*. If no herbs are available, use rhubarb to purge—also effective. For cinnabar toxins, lance to remove blood.\n\n**Red Sage Ointment:**\nTreats malignant flesh, malignant nodules, scrofula, wind-binding, and all vessel swellings.\n*Red sage, elder* (each 2 *liang*), *gentian, pubescent angelica, aconite, bletilla, achyranthes, chrysanthemum, saposhnikovia* (each 1 *liang*), *artemisia leaf, azalea flower, Sichuan pepper* (each 0.5 *liang*). Chop the twelve ingredients, soak in 2 *sheng* of bitter wine overnight, then simmer with 4 *jin* of lard until the wine evaporates. Do not overcook. Strain and apply to affected areas five times daily. Spread on old cloth and apply. This ointment may also be taken internally—consume sparingly after a thorough bowel movement. (Same as *Xiaopin*.)\n\n**Cimicifuga Ointment:**\nTreats cinnabar toxins, hot swellings, and sores.\n*Cimicifuga, white ampelopsis, rhaponticum, mirabilite* (each 2 *liang*), *scutellaria, immature orange fruit, forsythia, snake’s tongue herb* (each 3 *liang*), *gardenia* (20 pieces), *elder root* (4 *liang*). Chop the ten ingredients finely, place in a vessel, soak in 3 *sheng* of water for half a day, then simmer with 5 *sheng* of lard until the water evaporates. Strain and apply five times daily. For urgent cases, decoct in water. Extremely effective.\n\n**Ge’s Formula for Sudden Toxic Swellings with Acute Pain:**\nBoil willow bark in wine until hot and apply as a compress—the pain will cease.\n\n**Appended Formulas:**\n\n**From *Sheng Jin Fang*:**\nTreats brain abscesses, back carbuncles, deep-rooted boils, hot boils, and malignant sores.\nFinely chop a rabbit’s head from the twelfth month, place in a jar, and seal tightly—the longer it is stored, the better. Spread thickly on cloth and apply to hot, painful areas, changing frequently like ice. It will heal.\n\n**From *Qian Jin Fang*:**\nTreats back carbuncles and deep-rooted swellings, whether ulcerated or not.\nMix 3 *sheng* of fermented soybeans with a little water, pound into a paste, and form into cakes 0.3 *cun* thick. If the swelling has an opening, do not cover it; place the soybean cake over the opening and apply moxibustion with mugwort until warm. Maintain warmth without burning the flesh.",
      "overlap_context": "mix with vinegar. This is a great secret.\n\n**Method to Resolve Swellings with Moxibustion:**\nSlice a single garlic clove crosswise to a thickness of one *fen*, place on the swelling’s head, and apply moxa cones the size of *wutongzi* (paulownia seeds), one hundred cones. If no reduction is felt, repeat frequently—more is better. Avoid excessive heat; if pain is felt, lift the garlic. Replace charred garlic with fresh. Do not burn the skin or flesh. If the body is dry, moxibustion is unnecessary.",

      "translated_text": "**Appended Formulas:**\n\nIf the swelling is hot and painful, change the compress urgently—the ailment will abate, and the patient will soon recover. Apply twice daily.\n\nIf moxibustion is used and pus begins to flow from a preexisting sore, the condition will improve.\n\n**From *Waizhai Miyao*:**\nTreats impending back carbuncles (with chills and shivering as if about to erupt) or existing sores and swellings.\nDissolve **3 liang** of **xiao shi** (borax) in **1 sheng** of warm water until dissolved, then cool. Take an old green cloth, fold it three times, cut to fit the affected area’s size and shape, dampen it, and apply. Replace immediately when it grows hot.

Rotten flesh and bone will then be expelled entirely.\"*\n\nThus, the scholar-official Yang Yi once recorded:\n*\"When Zhishu Guan was young, a carbuncle formed on his cheek, spreading to the jaw and outer ear, swelling like an overturned bowl. It ulcerated, draining pus and blood incessantly, causing unbearable pain. After countless treatments over a year without improvement, someone advised him to follow Zheng’s method. After preparing and applying the burned medicine, within moments, the rotting bone—including two teeth—drained out, and he recovered fully, remaining healthy afterward.\"* This confirms the swift efficacy of ancient prescriptions in treating disease.\n\nThe *huangdi* (瓦) used in this process resembles the glazed tiles sold in markets today. In modern alchemy, yellow glazed tiles (*huangzhen*) are still employed, as recorded in antiquity. *Huangdi* is pronounced *wǔ*.\n\nFrom *Mei Shi Fang*:\nFor **postpartum lactation failure**, where milk accumulates and forms a carbuncle, apply crushed *pu gong yao* (蒲公草) to the swelling, changing it three or four times daily. Commonly called *pu gong ying* (蒲公英), though the name is corrupted from *púgōngyīng* to *púgōngguō* in speech. The juice may also be ingested by boiling it.\n\nAnother method for treating **jealous milk carbuncles**:\nCrush cloves into powder and administer with water, one *fangchén* dose.\n\nAnother method for treating **cracked nipples**:\nApply crushed clove powder topically.\n\nFrom *Qian Jin Fang*:\nFor **jealous milk**:\nMix **house dust** with vinegar and apply it. This also treats **scrotal swelling**.\n\nFrom *Ling Yuan Fang*:\nFor **initial breast abscesses**, where swelling and hardness form, threatening pus drainage, one dose suffices:\nTake **true birch bark from the north**, boil in *wugui* (無灰) wine, and administer one *fangchén* dose. Rest afterward until recovery.\n\nFrom *Sheng Hui Fang*:\nFor **persistent breast carbuncles**:\nUse **half a *jin* of wheat flour**, toast until golden, mix with vinegar into a paste, and apply to the breast. It will dissolve immediately.\n\nFrom *Chan Bao*:\nFor **breast and carbuncle swellings**:\nTake **chicken dung powder**, administer one *fangchén* dose, repeating three times at short intervals. It will heal.\n\n*Mei Shi Fang* also treats **cracked nipples** with the same method.\n\nFrom *Jian Yao Ji Zhong*:\nFor **female breast carbuncles** where pus does not drain, forming internal abscesses (**jealous milk**):\nBurn **wild bee combs** to ash, grind, and take two *qian* per dose with one *zhongshao* cup of water, decocting until reduced by four parts. Strain, warm, and ingest.\n\nAnother method for treating **blocked lactation** (*chui nai*):\n**Du Sheng San** (独胜散):\nTake **half *liang* of white cloves**, grind into powder. Administer one *qian* dose with warm wine, without regard to time.\n\nFrom *Zi Mu Mi Lu*:\nFor **blocked lactation** with **chills and high fever**:\nSoak **pork lard** in cold water, apply as a poultice, changing when it warms. Immediate effect.\n\nFrom *Yang Yan Nan Xing Fang*:\nFor **unbearable pain from blocked lactation**:\nUse **baked *chuan shan jia* (穿山甲), *mu tong* (木通), and raw *zi ran tong* (自然铜)**, each one *liang*. Grind into powder. Take two *qian* per dose with warm wine, without regard to time.\n\n*Shi Yi Xin Jing* states:\nFor **blocked lactation without itching or pain**, where the breast hardens like stone:\nTake **one *liang* of green tangerine peel**, boil in water to remove the white pith, dry, and grind into powder. Take two *qian* doses with warm wine, without regard to time.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven:** Methods for treating **intestinal carbuncles and lung carbuncles**\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight:** Methods for treating **sudden onset of malignant toxic sores** (*danhuo* evil carbuncles)",

      "translated_text": "「In **Shangzhou**, there was a person afflicted by **great wind** (*dàfēng*), whom his family despised. They built a thatched hut for him in the mountains, where a black snake (*wūshé*) fell into his wine jar (*jiǔ géng*). The patient was unaware, but after drinking the wine, his condition gradually improved. Only when the jar’s bottom still contained the snake’s bones did he realize its cause.\n\n**Daoist Caution** (*dào jǐn*) notes: According to **Li Zhao’s *History Supplement*** (*Guóshǐ Bǔ*), Li Zhou’s younger brother suffered from **wind** (*fēng*), and someone suggested that **snake wine** (*shéjiǔ*) could cure it. Thus, he sought a black snake, placed it alive in a jar, and fermented it with **malted barley** (*qū niè*). For several days, the snake’s cries never ceased. When the wine was ready, its aroma was intense, and he drank it fully. In moments, it all transformed into water, leaving only the snake’s **hair and scales** (*máo fā*). The account in *Zhāoyě Huìzǎi* is likely too extreme to be taken lightly.\n\n**Treatment for Sudden Onset of Verminous Fistulas** (*chú dé chóngshǔ zhūliú fāng*)—**Fourth Remedy for Afflictions of the Scrotum** (*dì sìshíyī fāng*)\n\n**Bo Ge** (*Gě Shì*) says: All swellings have their corresponding **pathogenic factors** (*xiāngzhǔ*), and patients should examine the original remedy.\n\nMost often, it appears on both sides of the head, with **clustered nodules** (*lěilěi yǒu hé*).\n\n**Bo Ge’s Remedy**: For **verminous fistulas** (*shǔliú*) where the **nodules** (*hé*) are painful and not yet suppurated (*wèi chéng nóng*), apply **cypress leaves** (*bó yè*), sprinkle with **refined salt** (*fá yán*), and **moxibust** (*wēn*) until the heat penetrates downward—it will then dissolve.\n\n**Bo Ge’s Remedy**: If one suddenly contracts **verminous fistulas** (*shǔliú*) with **afflictions of the scrotum** (*yīnzhǒng*) yet no sores have formed but the area is already hot, use the following remedy quickly: Pound **black rooster’s feet** (*wū jī zú*) or **plantain herb** (*chēqián cǎo*), and apply it. If the **nodules** (*hé*) have already formed and **pus and blood** (*nóng xuè*) are discharging, smear with **hot pig dung** (*rè niú shǐ*), three times daily.\n\nAnother remedy: Take **white fresh skin** (*bái xiān pí*), boil and consume one *sheng* (升), causing the vermin to be vomited up.\n\nAnother remedy: Take one **cat or weasel** (*māo lí*), prepare it as a soup (*zuò gēng rú shí fǎ*), and ingest it on an empty stomach (*kòng xīn jìn zhī*)—the vermin will die and exit.\n\nOr, swallow it raw—its efficacy is even greater.\n\nAnother remedy: Extract a **vermin** (*shǔ*) from the center of a fistula, one as large as a **chicken egg** (*jī zǐ dà*), and with **three-year-old pig fat** (*sān suì làyuè zhū zhī*) from the **twelfth lunar month** (*làyuè*), decoct it until the vermin’s **bones, flesh, and hair** (*gǔ ròu yú fā*) are completely dissolved. Apply half to the sore and consume the other half with wine (*jiǔ fú*)—the vermin will exit through the wound.\n\n**Bo Ge’s Remedy**: A **secret method** (*mì bù chuán zhī fǎ*)—**Liu Xun’s Remedy for Verminous Fistulas** (*Liú Xún shǔliú fāng*).\nUse **tortoise shell** (*guī ké*), **roasted licorice root** (*zhì gān cǎo*), **cinnamon bark** (*guì xīn*), **realgar** (*xióng huáng*), **dried ginger** (*gān jiāng*), and **roasted weasel bones** (*zhì lí gǔ*), divide them equally, pound into a powder, mix with **honey** (*mì*), and apply to the wound—it will never fail. First, **moxibust** (*jiǔ*) to create the wound, then apply the medicine effectively.\n\nAnother remedy: **Five升 of oak bark** (*zhà mù bái pí*), combined with **one斗 of wine** (*yī dǒu jiǔ*), decoct together. Remove the bark when done, and reduce the liquid to **two升** (*èr shēng*). Consume it all, and the **old stagnant flesh** (*sùròu*) will emerge—it will then heal.\n\nAnother remedy: **Fistula sores with seated flesh** (*liúchuāng zuò ròu gāo*).\nUse **white mulberry bark** (*kuàngshù bái pí*), **vermin flesh** (*shǔròu*), and **angelica root** (*dāngguī*), each **two liǎng** (两); **leek white** (*xiè bái*), **three liǎng**; **raw rehmannia root** (*shēng dìhuáng*), **five liǎng**; and **three升 of three-year-old pig fat** (*sān suì zhū zhī*). Decoct into a plaster (*jiān gāo chéng*), apply it to the wound, and cover the **orifice** (*kǒng*) to promote new flesh growth.\n\n**Bo Ge’s Remedy**: If the sores are numerous but the **orifices** (*kǒng*) are small, it is **ant fistula** (*mǐliú*). The remedy: Burn **dried carp scales** (*bǐng lí jiǎ*), mix with **pig fat** (*zhū gāo*), and apply.\n\nAnother remedy: Burn **twenty-one spiders** (*zhīzhū*), and use the ashes effectively.\n\nAnother remedy for **fistulas** (*liú fāng*): Decoct **peach leaves** (*táo yè*) and **peach branches** (*táo zhī*), cleanse and wash the wound, and insert the decoction into the **orifice** (*kǒng*)—this is a highly verified remedy.\n\n**Bo Ge’s Remedy**: If the **fistula** (*liú*) affects the **mouth** (*kǒu lǐ*), take **white mulberry root** (*kuàngshù gēn*) from the **eastern journey** (*dōngxíng*), finely grind it, boil in water, and use the clear liquid to **rinse the mouth** (*hán zhī*). Spit repeatedly (*shù tǔ*), but do not swallow.\n\n**Flesh Fistula Remedy** (*ròuliú fāng*): Pound **sophora bark** (*huái bái pí*) into pills (*dǎo wán*), wrap them in **cotton** (*mián*), and insert into the **lower abdomen** (*xiàbù zhōng*). Apply externally—it works.\n\n**Verminous Fistula Remedy** (*shǔliú fāng*): **Andromeda root** (*shínán*), **raw rehmannia root** (*shēng dìhuáng*), **orpiment** (*cíhuáng*), **poria** (*fúlíng*), and **scutellaria root** (*huánglián*), each **two liǎng**. Make into a powder (*wéi sǎn*), and apply to the wound twice daily.\n\nAnother remedy: **Alum** (*fánshí*), **three fēn** (分), burn it; **leopard-spotted cat** (*bān māo*), **one fēn**, roast it, remove its **head and feet** (*tóu zú*), pound and mix with **vinegar** (*cù*). Consume **half a chǐ** (匕), and in moments, the **verminous creature** (*liú chóng*) will exit through the **urine** (*xiǎobiàn*).\n\n**From *The Simplified Abbreviated Prescriptions* (*Shān Fán Fāng*).**\n\n**Additional Remedies** (*Fù fāng*)\n\n**From *The Prescriptions for Emergencies at One’s Elbow* (*Zhǒuhòu Fāng*)**: Treating **wind fistula** (*fēngliú*).\nUse **one honeycomb** (*lù fēng fáng*), roast until it turns **yellow and red** (*huáng chì sè*), grind into powder (*wéi mò*). Each dose, take **one qián** (钱), mix evenly with **three-year-old pig fat** (*làyuè zhū zhī*), and apply to the wound.\n\n**From *The Thousand-Gold Prescriptions* (*Qiān Jīn Fāng*)**: Treating **verminous fistula** (*shǔliú*).\nTake **one chicken egg** (*jī zǐ*), cook in **rice gruel** (*mǐ xià*), simmer for half a day (*bàn rì*). Remove the egg yolk (*qǔchū huáng*), and simmer until it turns **black** (*fú rèn zhī*). First, wipe the wound with the egg yolk liquid (*shì*), dry it, and insert the medicine into the **orifice** (*kǒng*). Three applications will cure it.\n\n**From *The Thousand-Gold Supplement* (*Qiān Jīn Yì*)**: Treating **ant fistula** (*mǐliú*).\nTake **twenty-one dried carp scales** (*cì lí jiǎ*), grind into powder (*wéi mò*), mix with **pig fat** (*zhū gāo*), and apply.\n\n**From *The Sacred Benevolence Prescriptions* (*Shèng Huì Fāng*)**: Treating **mole cricket fistula** (*zhōugū liú*).\nBurn **valonea leaves** (*qì yè*) into ashes (*wéi huī*), finely grind them (*xì nián*), and soak **valonea leaves** (*qì yè*) in **used rice water** (*zāi bié*) to wash the wound (*qǔ xǐ liú*).

Before sleep, mix with cold tea and take 2 sháo.\n\nAnother prescription: For cold-toxin from injury by cold attacking the eyes, causing white cataracts, use **2 liang of cuttlefish bone (wūzéiyú gǔ)**, excluding the large skin, ground into powder. Add a small amount of **camphor (lóngnáo)**, further refining until fine. Apply three to four times daily, using a small portion each time.\n\nAnother prescription: For chronic internal cataracts, grind **Plantain Seed (chēqiánzi)**, **Dried Rehmannia (gāndìhuáng)**, and **Ophiopogon (màimén'dōng)** in equal parts into a powder. Form into honey pills the size of **Chinese catalpa seeds (wútóngzi)**, and take as needed—highly effective.\n\nFor eye ailments, **rhubarb (huánglián)** is often used, but **Sheep Liver Pills** are particularly miraculous.\nTake **1 large liang of rhubarb powder**, one **white sheep’s liver**, remove the membrane, and grind together in a mortar until extremely fine. Knead with multiple hands into pills the size of **Chinese catalpa seeds (wútóngzi)**. Take seven pills with warm water after each meal, repeating for five doses.

      "translated_text": "Thus the prescription was passed down to the world.\n\nAnother prescription: the modern physician’s eye-washing decoction.\nTake equal parts of **dang gui (Chinese angelica)**, **sháo yào (white peony)**, and **huáng lián (coptis)**, finely ground. Brew with **snow water** or **sweetened water** into a thick infusion, and wash the eyes while hot—if it cools, rewarm and wash again. This greatly benefits the eyes. It treats **wind-toxicity**, **red-eye**, and **flowery cataracts**, all of which it governs.\n\nIts principle states: All eye diseases arise from stagnant blood and vessels, so **blood-moving herbs** are combined with **huáng lián** to treat them. Blood, when heated, flows freely—that is why the wash must be applied while hot. Those who use it will find miraculous results.\n\nAnother prescription: for **crow’s-eye disease** (presbyopia), regardless of age.\nTake **two liáng of cāng zhú (atractylodes)**, pound and sift into a powder. Each dose: **one qián**. At any time, take a fresh **sheep’s liver**, slit open with a bamboo knife, sprinkle the powder inside, bind tightly with hemp string, and boil in **a large bowl of fermented rice water** until done. The patient first inhales the steam, then—once the medicinal vapor has dissipated—ingests the liver. *(From *Jiǎn Yào Jì Zhòng*)* For children’s **crow’s-eye disease**. *(From *Méi Shī Fāng*)* To treat **yellowed, dim vision** where objects are unseen.\nSlice **qīng yáng (green sheep’s) liver**, eat with **diluted vinegar**. Boiling it is also effective.\n\nAnother prescription: for **eyeballs that suddenly protrude one or two inches**.\nDrench the eyes with **freshly drawn water**, changing the water repeatedly, until the eyeballs return on their own.\n\n*(From *Cuī Yuàn Liàng’s Sea-Coast Prescriptions*)* Three names: **Xīguó cǎo (Western Herb)**, **Bìléngqié (Bilva)**, and **fùpénzi (Chinese mulberry)**.\nTo treat **dim vision**, **cold tears**, **persistent weeping**, **green/blue blindness**, and **epidemic dimness**, take **Xīguó cǎo**, dry it under the sun, pound until thoroughly pulverized, wrap in thin cotton, and soak in **human breast milk** for the duration of an eight- or nine-*lǐ* walk. Apply to the eyes while lying supine—within three or four days, vision will return as in youth. **Avoid alcohol, oil, and wheat flour.**\n\n*(From *Qiān Jīn Fāng*)* To treat **children’s black, cloudy cataracts** with pain and dryness.\nBurn **one liáng of bèi chǐ (oyster shell)** into ash, grind into a fine powder, mix with a small amount of **long náo (camphor)**, and apply. This is supremely effective.\n\nAnother prescription: for **permanent clear vision**.\nTake **one dàn of hú mǎ (sesame seeds)**, steam them thirty times, grind into a powder, and take with wine—**one shāng daily**.\n\nAnother prescription: an ancient remedy for **clear vision and black hair**.\nSoak **huái zǐ (sophora seeds)** in **ox bile** for **one hundred days** in the shade, then swallow **one seed after meals**. In ten days, the body feels light; in thirty, gray hair turns black; in one hundred, one attains **spiritual penetration**.\n\n*(From *Sūn Zhēn Rén’s Food Taboos*)* To treat **eye cloudiness**.\nTake **one dà liáng of máng xiāo (mang Xiao, saline soda)**, place in a copper vessel, and refine over intense heat. Once cooled, sift through fine silk and apply to the **inner eye corners** before sleep each night. This is supremely effective.\n\n*(From *Jīng Yàn Fāng*)* **Bái Lóng Sǎn (White Dragon Powder)** to **dissolve cataracts and restore vision**.\nTake **mǎ yá xiāo (tooth coral, calcined)**, wrap in thick paper, press firmly, and carry in the breast pocket against the flesh for **one hundred twenty days**. Remove, grind into a powder, mix with a small amount of **long náo (camphor)**, and refine finely. For those with **long-standing eye films** causing dimness and blurred distance vision—even if the pupil remains unbroken—this will cure them.\n\nEach application uses **two mǐ of the powder**, applied to the eyes.\n\nAnother prescription: for **internal and external cataracts**.\nTake **four liáng of cāng zhú (atractylodes)**, soak in **rice-wash water for seven days**, changing the water daily, then scrape off the blackened skin, slice finely, and fry with **one liáng of qīng yán (green salt)** until yellow. Remove the salt.\n\nTake **two liáng of mù dì (spikemoss)**, soak in **a child’s urine overnight**, rinse with water, and dry in the sun. Combine and grind into a powder. Take **one qián sháo** daily at any time, mixed into **vegetable dishes**.\n\n*(From *Jīng Yàn Hòu Fāng*)* To treat **dim vision from exhaustion**.\nHarvest **màn jīng huā (rocket flower)** in the third month, dry in the shade, and grind into a powder. Take **two qián sháo** with **well-water** on an empty stomach. Long-term use grants **longevity** and allows **nighttime reading**.\n\n*(From *Wài Tái Mì Yào*)* To treat **eye films and protruding flesh**.\nTake the **whitest alunite**, place **one grain-sized piece** on the **film or protruding flesh**, and cold tears will flow. Wipe with cotton until the foul discharge is exhausted. The ailment will improve daily, the film will thin, and recovery will follow. **Only the purest alunite may be used.**\n\nAnother: **Bǔ Gān Sǎn (Liver-Tonifying Powder)** to treat **thirty-year blindness**.\nCollect **jí lí zǐ (spiny cocklebur seeds)** on the **seventh day of the seventh month**, dry in the shade, and pound into a powder. Take **one fāng cùn sháo** after meals with water.\n\nAnother: to **cure blindness**.\nTake **one pig’s gallbladder**, boil into pill form the size of **glutinous millet grains**, insert into the eyes. After a meal’s time, it is effective.\n\nAnother prescription: for **severe cataracts**.\nTake the **white skin of a pig’s gallbladder**, dry in the sun, twist into a small cord the thickness of a **hairpin shaft**, burn into ash, and—once cooled—apply the ash directly to the cataract. **Three to five applications** will suffice.\n\nAnother prescription: to **lighten the body, tonify qi, and sharpen vision**.\nTake **one shēng of wú jīng zǐ (rape seeds)**, boil in **nine shēng of water** until the liquid is exhausted, dry daily for three cycles, then grind into a powder. Take **one fāng cùn sháo** three times daily with water.\n\n*(From *Dòu Mén Fāng*)* To treat **fire-eye (conjunctivitis)**.\nBurn **moxa**, cover with a bowl as smoke rises, wait until the smoke condenses into soot on the bowl’s underside, then dissolve the soot in warm water to wash the eyes. This is immediately effective. Adding **huáng lián (coptis)** enhances the result.\n\n*(From *Guǎng Lì Fāng*)* To treat **eye protrusions and protruding flesh**.\nTake **seven fresh xìng rén (apricot kernels)**, remove the skins, chew finely, and—while still warm—wrap the saliva on a cotton swab to apply to the protruding flesh. **Four or five applications** will suffice.\n\n*(From *Yào Xìng Lùn*)* It is said: **Rubbing teeth with salt on an empty stomach**, then spitting into water to wash the eyes, allows **nighttime reading of small text**. This is effective.",

Then boil *gé gēn* (kudzu root) into a thick decoction to wash the wound. Pound dry *gé gēn* into powder, mix with the boiled *gé gēn* juice, and administer in a square-inch spoonful—five times daily, once at night, for optimal results.\n\n*Alternative Prescription:*\nChew *sù* (millet) and apply it to the wound.\n\n*Maopeng agrees.*\n\n*Another Prescription:*\nBoil raw iron until it emits a scent, then use it to wash the wound.\n\n*Maopeng agrees.*\n\n**General Precautions Against Ferocious Beasts and Poisonous Creatures:**\nAll wild beasts and venomous creatures are subject to human *qi* restraint. Before entering mountains or grasslands, one must first restrain them. The ritual method states:\n\n*\"Upon reaching the mountain’s base, hold your breath for thirty-five breaths. Visualize the divine spirit summoning a tiger to stand before you, then store it within your lungs. A White Emperor emerges, sealing the tiger’s eyes. Your lower *dantian* then expels lung *qi*, and the White Crown ascends above the forest canopy.*\n\n*After a long pause, hold your breath again for thirty-five breaths. With both hands, pinch the tiger’s eyes in three steps—each step taken with the right foot leading. Then halt and recite:*\n\n*'Li Er, Li Er—are you not Li Er? You stole the Yellow Emperor’s hound. The Yellow Emperor commands me to question you: How do you answer?'*\n\n*Then proceed; no tiger in the mountain will be seen.*\n\n*If encountered, stand firm, extend your left hand’s five fingers fully, and leap with all your strength—three upward-downward motions while shouting, ‘#1 *Zhuó!* Tiger, North Dipper Star commands you to depart!’ The tiger will flee. Even when camping, first dig four depressions in the ground as above.\"*\n\n*Another Method:*\nBurn cow or sheep horns—tigers will not dare approach humans.\n\n*Another Method:*\nPound *xiónghuáng* (realgar) and *zǐshí* (purple stone), sew into a pouch, and wear it.*\n\n---\n**Appendix: *Mei Shi’s Prescription***\n**Treatment for Tiger Bites on Humans:**\nDrink alcohol until heavily intoxicated; the hair will be vomited out.\n\n---\n**Treatment for Sudden Rabies from Mad Dog Bites – Fifth Thirty-Fourth Prescription**\n\n**Prescription to Cure Mad Dog Bites:**\nFirst, suck out the foul blood. Moxibustion at the wound site ten times. The next day, reduce to one moxa cone daily until reaching one hundred.\n\n*Maopeng warns:* Avoid alcohol.\n\n*Another Prescription:*\nGrind *dìyòu* (sanguisorba root) into powder, take one square-inch spoonful daily, once or twice. Also apply the powder to the wound. Pounding fresh roots and applying them is even better.\n\n*Another Prescription:*\nScrape tiger teeth or tiger bone into powder, take one spoonful.

If no fire is available, cut the snake’s tail in a circular motion until the skin is severed, then pull the skin downward—this will force the snake to exit. **Same as in *Xiǎopǐn*.**\n\nDuring the seventh and eighth months (July–August), all snakes’ venom is at its peak and should not be expelled. They bite grasses and trees, causing them to wither and die—a condition called *shéchǐ* (snake-withered wood). This substance harms people more severely than snake venom itself; treat it using the same methods as for snakebites.\n\n**Additional Prescriptions:**\n\nFrom *Guǎnglì Fāng*: For snakebite wounds, wash them with warm *jiǔ* (alcohol) three times daily.\n\nFrom *Shènghuì Fāng*: For a snake entering the mouth or any of the seven orifices, cut the tail of a sow and let its blood drip into the mouth—the snake will leave.\n\n---\n**Prescriptions for Avoiding and Treating All Snakes in Mountainous Regions and General Snake-Related Remedies (Section 58):**\n**Method for Warding Off All Snakes:**",

      "translated_text": "**Prescriptions for Avoiding and Treating All Snakes in Mountainous Regions and General Snake-Related Remedies (Section 58):**\n**Method for Warding Off All Snakes:**\n\nAs before, following Master Yao’s Daoist method for entering mountainous regions.\n\nThough many remedies exist to repel snakes, *wǔdū xiónghuáng* (realgar from Wudu) is supreme. Carry a piece with you, and if you weigh five *liang* (ounces) on your right arm at the elbow, no snake’s venom will dare approach. If others are bitten, grind it and apply it as a remedy. Also, carrying five *wǔgǔ huáng* (realgar pills) is effective. Since these pills contain *wúgǒng* (centipede), the full prescription appears in *Bèijí* (Emergency Remedies). Below is a prohibition: if one does not observe the ritual, the effect will fail.\n\nDo not cross water after a snakebite—doing so will worsen the pain beyond the initial sting. Before crossing, visualize a giant centipede ahead of you, then proceed. If traveling by boat without performing this ritual, it will be fatal.\n\nWhen entering mountains, never speak the word *\"snake.\"* Instead, refer to the bitten as *\"one struck by a snake.\"* This caution is all the more important to observe.\n\n**Method to Repel Snakes:**\nBurn *yángyáng* (ram) horns wherever you go, letting the smoke rise from the ground—the snakes will depart.\n\n**Additional Prescriptions:**\n\nFrom *Guǎnglì Fāng*: To treat snakebites where the victim is near death and to repel snakes,\ngrind equal parts *gānjiāng* (dried ginger) and *xiónghuáng* (realgar), store in a small silk pouch, and tie it on the left arm for men, right for women. The scent of the medicine will repel snakes, and the venom can be applied directly to the wound.\n\n---\n**Prescriptions for Sudden Centipede and Spider Bites (Section 59):**\n\nFrom *Gě Shì’s Prescriptions*: Cut a rooster’s comb and apply its blood to the wound.\n\nAnother method: Seal the wound with salt—it will heal immediately. It is said that if the centipede flees far enough, it will not return.\n\nAnother method: Apply hot saltwater compresses.\n\nAnother method: Chew *dàsuàn* (garlic) or *xiǎosuàn* (small garlic) or *sāngshù bái zhī* (white sap of the mulberry tree) and apply it.\n\nAlso, rub the sole of a hemp sandal on the wound—this is effective.\n\nThough *yúgǒng* (scorpions) bite fiercely, their venom is far lighter than that of bees. The pain is slight and subsides quickly. For spider bites:\n\nGrind *shēng tiě yī* (raw iron armor) with vinegar to make a thick paste and apply it.\n\nAnother method: Mix *wūmá yóu* (black sesame oil) with *húfěn* (barite powder) and apply it. Once dry, reapply until recovery.\n\nApply *yángtáo yè* (wolfberry leaves) to the wound—it will heal instantly.\n\n**Additional Prescriptions for Earthworm, Mole Cricket, Silkworm, and Other Pest Bites:**\n\nFrom *Méi Shī’s Prescriptions*: For centipede bites where the pain does not cease,\nrub the wound with *dútóu suàn* (single-clove garlic).\n\nAnother method, from *Jīngyàn Hòu Fāng*: Burn chicken dung, mix with alcohol, and apply it—this is excellent.\n\nAnother method: Mix chicken dung with vinegar and apply it.\n\nFrom *Shènghuì Fāng*: To treat centipede bites,\nextract juice from a *wōniú* (land snail) and drip it onto the bite.\n\nFrom *Bīngbù Shǒují*: To treat spider bites where the entire body breaks out in sores,\ndrink fine spring wine until intoxicated, then lie still on your back—do not move. The alcohol’s toxicity will force the pests from the flesh, emerging like grains of rice. (Note: Be cautious, as the alcohol’s poison may otherwise harm the body.)\n\nFrom *Tán Shì Xiǎo’ér Fāng*: Take a stalk of *cōng* (green onion), remove the tip, and pierce a hole at the base. Insert an earthworm into the stalk, pinch both ends tightly to prevent escape, and shake vigorously—it will liquefy. Drip the liquid onto the bite for relief.\n\nFrom *Liú Yǔxī’s Chuánxìn Fāng*: To treat injuries from venomous creatures,\ntake one bowl of *dàlán zhī* (great indigo root juice), add *xiónghuáng* (realgar) and *shèxiāng* (musk), grinding them finely. Stir into the juice and apply to the bite. If the venom is severe, also ingest a small amount of the liquid—its efficacy is miraculous.\n\nIn the past, *Zhāng Yuánwài* served as a judge under *Zhāng Yánshǎng* in Sichuan. Suddenly, a striped spider bit his neck. By the next morning, two red marks, as thin as chopsticks, circled his neck from chest to heart meridian. By the second night, his face and head swelled to the size of several bowls, his abdomen followed, and he nearly perished. *Zhāng Xiàng* (the official) valued his recommendation highly and, in gratitude, donated five hundred thousand (cash) from his personal wealth, along with additional family funds numbering hundreds of thousands more, to seek a cure.",

      "translated_text": "Suddenly, a man stepped forward and declared, *\"I can cure him.\"* Zhang Xiang initially doubted him but, wishing to test his method, ordered him to prepare the medicine on the spot. The man replied, *\"I care nothing for the formula—what matters is saving this man’s life.\"* He then took a porcelain bowl of *dàlán* (great indigo) juice, dropped a spider into it, and after a long while, it emerged from the liquid in great distress, barely able to move. He then crushed more *dàlán* juice, added powdered musk, and placed another spider into it—this one died upon immersion. Finally, he took fresh *dàlán* juice, musk, and added *xiónghuáng* (realgar), then dropped yet another spider into the mixture, where it dissolved into water.\n\nZhang Xiang and the others were astonished. They applied the liquid to the bite, and within two days, the swelling completely subsided—though a small sore remained at the wound. Once the scab fell off, the skin healed as before.\n\n**From *Jīngyàn Fāng* (Experiential Prescriptions):**\nTo treat spider bites causing itchy threads across the body—drink one *shēng* (升) of sheep’s milk.\n\nIn the *Zhēnyuán* decade of the 10th year (794 CE), *Cuī Yuànwài* reported from *Zhì* (modern Sichuan): *\"I witnessed a man bitten by a spider, his abdomen swelling like that of a pregnant woman. His family abandoned him, and he begged for food along the road. A monk encountered him and instructed him to drink sheep’s milk. Within days, he recovered.\"*\n\n**Another Prescription:**\nTo treat *qiūyǐn* (earthworm) bites—immerse the body in a concentrated salt bath several times; this will alleviate the condition.\n\nZhang Shào, a military officer from *Zhèxī* (modern Zhejiang), was bitten by such a creature. Its form was vast as a *fēng* (wind demon), causing his eyebrows and beard to fall out. Each night, the earthworms would writhe within his body, emitting sounds. A monk taught him this remedy, and he recovered.\n\n**Another Prescription:**\nTo treat *qiūyǐn* (earthworm) bites, where the victim’s form swells like a *fēng* (wind demon) and their eyebrows and beard fall out—immerse the body in lime water; this is also effective.\n\n**From *Shènghuì Fāng* (Sacred Benevolence Prescriptions):**\nTo treat *gūnyǐ* (mole cricket) bites—apply chicken dung to the wound.\n\n**Another Prescription:**\nTo treat *lónggū* (mole cricket) bites—mix lime with vinegar and apply it.\n\n**From *Guǎnglì Fāng* (Expanded Benefit Prescriptions):**\nTo treat silkworm bites—grind musk finely, mix with honey, and apply; this will cure it.\n\n**From *Qiānjīn Fāng* (Thousand-Gold Prescriptions):**\nTo treat *mòyú* (assassin bug) urine sores—burn *liàn* (melia) tree bark and skin into ash, mix with pig fat, and apply. Alternatively, pound fermented soybeans and apply them. Or mix vinegar with powder and apply. Another method: to treat *mòyú* (assassin bug) urine marks, where the victim develops sores at the point of contact, resembling clusters of millet grains, causing intense pain—if they cluster, the pain spreads like needles beneath the skin, as if stung by a venomous insect, forming small sores in groups like *zhūyú* (Chinese date) seeds, with red edges and white pus at the center. The skin tightens, the body shivers with cold, and a fever rises. In severe cases, the sores merge, spreading across the waist, ribs, and chest.\n\n**Treatment:** Upon first contact, grind rhinoceros horn and apply it to stop the spread.\n\n**From *Bówù Zhì* (Compendium of Curiosities):**\nTo treat *mòyú* (assassin bug) urine marks, which also cause sores where they touch—apply *jīchángcǎo* (chicken gizzard herb) juice; this is effective.\n\n**From *Wàitái Mìyào* (Essentials of the Imperial Library):**\nTo treat *mòyú* (assassin bug) urine sores, which encircle the body and may be fatal—mix swallow’s nest soil with pig fat and sour wine, then apply. Another method: burn deer antlers into powder, mix with sour wine, and apply.\n\n**Money Minister’s Prescription:**\nTo treat *mòyú* (assassin bug) urine sores with yellowish discharge—chew pear leaves and apply; renew as it dries.\n\n**From *Shèngjīn Fāng* (Victorious Gold Prescriptions):**\nTo treat *mòyú* (assassin bug) urine sores, which first resemble scattered millet, then grow as large as beans, eventually swelling like a branded wound, causing extreme pain—immediately apply *cǎotú* (grass tea) or *làchá* (aged tea), mixed with raw oil. The pain ceases instantly; this is miraculous.\n\n**From *Shènghuì Fāng* (Sacred Benevolence Prescriptions):**\nTo treat bites from malevolent insects—apply *zǐcǎo* (purple grass) oil. Alternatively, mix ghee with salt and apply.\n\n**Prescriptions for Sudden *bì* (wasps) Stings (60):**\nApply *Yùhú Wán* (Jade Bottle Pills) or *Wǔgū Wán* (Five Armor Pills) to the sting site; these are found in *Bèijí Wán Sǎn Fāng* (Emergency Pill and Powder Prescriptions). Another method: take soil from beneath eaves, mix with water, and apply.\n\n**Prescriptions for Sudden Bee Stings (61):**\nIf a bee stings—wash the site with human urine. Alternatively, apply the white sap of *gǔshù* (millet tree) or *sāngshù* (mulberry tree); both are effective. Another method: scrape tooth tartar and apply.

Another method: chew *qīnghāo* (wormwood) and apply.\n\n**Additional Prescriptions from *Qiānjīn Fāng* (Thousand-Gold Prescriptions):**\nTo treat bee stings—grind *lùfēngfáng* (bee’s nest) into powder, mix with pig fat, and apply.\n\n**From *Yángshì Sǎnrǔ* (Yang’s Breastfeeding):**\nBoil bee’s nest in water for washing; this is also effective.\n\n**From *Wàitái Mìyào* (Essentials of the Imperial Library):**\nPound *bóhé* (mint) and apply; this will cure it.\n\n**From *Shènghuì Fāng* (Sacred Benevolence Prescriptions):**\nApply ghee; this will heal it.\n\nShen Cúnzhōng’s *Bǐtán* (Talks on Calligraphy and Miscellany) records: *\"The recluse Liú Tāng lived in seclusion on Wūshān. Once in Qí (modern Shandong), he saw a large rat bound by spider silk, which a wasp stung, causing it to fall to the ground. Soon, its belly swelled as if ready to burst. Slowly, it entered the grass and gnawed on a taro stalk, breaking it slightly. It then rubbed the broken stalk against its wound. After some time, its belly shrank, and it moved lightly as before. Afterward, if anyone was stung by a wasp, they would pound taro stalk and apply it, and the pain would subside.\"*\n\n**Prescriptions for Sudden Scorpion Stings (62):**\nIf a scorpion stings—immerse the site in warm water. Another method: pound *mǎmiáo* (horseweed) and garlic. Or chew dried ginger and apply; this is excellent. Yao’s method: soak the sting in cold water, and the pain will not arise. If the water grows slightly warm, the pain returns—change the water immediately. Another method: soak old cloth in cold water and press it against the sting, changing it several times.\n\n**Newly Effective Prescriptions:**\nTake equal parts of *shùkuíhuā* (hibiscus flower), *shíliúhuā* (pomegranate flower), and *àixīn* (mugwort core), all harvested on the fifth day of the fifth month at noon, dried in the shade, ground together, and mixed with water to apply to the sting—this will instantly alleviate the pain. If these two flowers are unavailable, use *guǐzhēncǎo* (devil’s needle), pound its juice, and apply; this will cure it immediately. Another method: apply yellow cinnabar mixed with vinegar.",

If untreated, it will consume the five *zàng* (viscera)—death follows.\nTo distinguish true hex from false: Have the patient spit into water. If the saliva sinks, it is hex; if it floats, it is not.\n\n*—From Small Brand and Yao’s Methods.*\n\n**Revealing the Hex Practitioner’s Name:**\nTake a small piece of drumskin, burn it to ash, and give it to the patient to drink. The patient will soon call out the hex practitioner’s name. If they speak, the illness will leave.\n\nSometimes, snakes and centipedes combine to create hex poison in food, causing *jū* (abdominal masses). This type kills over years—each requires separate treatment.\n\nAnother method: Place *lǚlùyè* (lotus leaf) secretly under the patient’s outer mat. The patient will call out the hex practitioner’s name.\n\n**Treating Internal Hex Poison with Vomiting or Bleeding:**\nAll follow the *Lán Gān* (Rotten Liver) Prescription.\nTake three *liǎng* each of *qiàn* (madder root) and *lǚlùgēn* (lotus root), finely chopped, decoct with four *shēng* (720ml) of water to two *shēng*, strain, and serve warm in one dose—it will cure immediately.\nThe patient will also call out the hex practitioner’s name.\n*—From Small Brand and Yao’s Methods.*\n\n**Another Prescription:**\nTake one *bādòu* (croton seed), remove its husk, roast, and mix with three *dòu* (soybeans) and a square-inch of ink from the bottom of a pot.

When the worms die, drink only the liquid. Even the dead can be revived.\n\n**Another Prescription:**\nTake one *kǔhuā* (bitter gourd), decoct with two *shēng* (360ml) of water to one *shēng*, and serve. It will induce vomiting immediately—it will cure.\n*—Same as Small Brand.*\n\n**Zhī’s Prescription:**\nDecoct one *shēng* of *kǔjiǔ* until dissolved, then serve—divinely verified.\n\n**Another Prescription:**\nTake three *zàojiá* (soapberry pods), roast, remove the seeds, and soak in five *shēng* (900ml) of wine overnight.

Take one *hé* (10ml) daily on an empty stomach—it will purge hex poison.\n\n*—Same as Small Brand and Yao’s Methods.*\n\n**Another Prescription:**\nTake one *liǎng* (20g) each of *xiónghuáng* (realgar), *dānshā* (cinnabar), and *lílú* (hemlock), pound to powder. In the morning, take with *jǐnghuá shuǐ* (dew water) the size of a knife-blade—it will induce vomiting and expel the hex creatures.\n\n**Another Prescription:**\nDrink one to two *shēng* (180–360ml) of *yǐnyǐngcǎo* (hidden-scented grass, *Platycladus orientalis* sapling) juice.\n*—This grass is *zhègēng* (orange-hued *Platycladus*), commonly eaten.*\n\n**Treating Hex Poison That Has Descended to the Lower Abdomen, Causing Perforation:**\nTake one *chánggǔ* (long-legged toad) with a green back, and one *jīgǔ* (chicken bone). Zhī’s method: Burn one part to ash, mix, and insert deeply into the lower abdomen.\n*—Same as Small Brand. Zhī’s method is frequently verified; Yao’s method agrees.*\n\n**Another Prescription:**\nDrip *zhūdǎn* (pig bile) into the lower abdomen, then pack with cotton deeply inserted.\n\n**Another Prescription:**\n*Wǔhuáng Huáng Wán* (Five-Yellow Pill) —the most essential for treating hex.\n*—Its formula is in the Urgent Conditions section.*\n\nThere is also *natural flying hex*, appearing like ghostly mist—difficult to treat.\nThese varieties respond best to true *xījī* (rhinoceros horn) and *shèxiāng* (musk). Carrying these on one’s person also prevents hex.\n\n**Yao’s Method for Hex-Induced Bleeding Like Chicken Liver, with Stone Residue, and Five *Zàng* (Visceral) Decay—Only the Heart Remains Intact, or the Nose Breaks:**\n**Prescription for the Dying:**\nPowder *zhègēng* (orange-hued *Platycladus*), serve with wine, one *sháo* (10ml) twice daily.\n*—Ge’s Prescription.*\n\nZhī’s Imperial Physicians have transmitted over ten verified prescriptions.\nTake *mǎdōulíng* (Aristolochia) root, pound to powder, serve with water, one square-inch dose.

The sore itself should also be cauterized **a hundred times**—this will cure the ailment.\n\n**Another remedy**: crush and squeeze the stems and leaves of *red amaranth* (*chìxiāng*), **extract its juice for drinking**, and **apply the residue to the sore**. Maoyun states: **\"Administer seven *hè* measures, four or five times daily.\"**\n\n**Yet another remedy**: use *garlic chives* (*húsuàn*), **apply them warm to the sore**, and **moxibustion over the garlic chives a thousand times** (*qiān zhàng*)—this will cure it.\n\n**Another remedy**: take **two white excrement pellets of a rooster** (*bái jīshǐ*), **mix them with honey** (*xiǎo táng*), and **apply the paste to the sore**.\n\n**Another remedy**: combine **seven *hè* measures each of *woodlice* (*shǔfú chóng*) and *fermented broad beans* (*zhǐ*), three *bā* measures of *croton seeds* (*bādòu*), **with the heart removed**, and **melted with pig fat** (*zhūzhī*). **Apply this medicine directly to the sore**—this will cure it.\n\n**Another remedy**: take **one *mǔ* parasite** (*mǔ chóng*)—**a black, bean-sized creature floating and moving on water**—**place it in the mouth**, and the ailment will subside.\n\n**Another remedy**: take **one *zhàojiá* pod** (*zhàojiá*), **preferably two *chǐ* long**, **pound it into pieces**, and **simmer with bitter wine** (*kǔjiǔ*) until it thickens like syrup (*yí*). **Remove the dregs** (*qùzhì*) and **apply it to the painful area**—this will cure it.\n\n**Another remedy**: pound *toothache amaranth* (*mǎchǐxiāng*), **drink its juice in two *shēng* measures**, and **apply the residue to the sore**. **Repeat four or five times daily**—this is highly effective.\n\n**Another remedy**: take **two *liǎng* measures each of *ascending heartvine* (*shēngmá*) and *black bindweed* (*wūxī*), boil with **three *shēng* measures of water**, **reduce to one *shēng* measure**, and **consume it all**. **Apply the residue to the sore**; if no improvement, repeat. **Maoyun’s variation**: add **two *liǎng* measures of rhinoceros horn** (*xījǐ*).\n\n**It states that this parasite** (*sandòu*) **shoots sand at a person’s shadow**, causing illness. **If one wishes to cross water**, first **cast a stone into it**; from the edges, **it fires arrows** (*yùshè*)—**its jaws can flex and extend like a crossbow** (*kǒuxiān*). In winter, **it lies dormant**. **Some have a long horn protruding before the mouth**; when the crossbow’s nock (*nǔyǎn*) aligns with the tip of this horn, **it bends like a raised crossbow**, using **its *qi* as an arrow**, and **propelled by water force**, it strikes people. **If struck**, the person **loses speech**, **and the rest of the symptoms resemble those described by Ge**.\n\n**Remedies for sudden sand-flea poisoning (66th method)**:\nSand-fleas (*shāpí*) are **common in mountainous streams and rivers**; they are **extremely fine and nearly invisible**. When people **enter the water for bathing or washing**, these parasites **attach to the body while submerged**. On **rainy, overcast days**, they also **cling to people in grass**, then **burrow into the skin**.\n\n**Diagnostic signs**:\n**Initially**, the skin **turns bright red**, with **sores resembling small beans, millet grains, or foxtail millet seeds**. **When rubbed**, the reddened area **hurts like a needle prick**. After **three days**, the patient **feels stiff in every joint**, with **pain, cold, heat, and sores developing on the reddened skin**. The parasite **gradually penetrates to the bone**, **leading to death**.\n\n**Preventive measures**:\nAfter bathing in mountain streams, **dry the body with cloth several times**, then **wipe once with an old piece of silk** (*gǔbó*), and **apply powder** (*fěn*) to it.\n\n**Another remedy for sand-flea poisoning**:\nTake **ten slices of raw garlic** (*dàsuàn*), **place them in hot ashes**, and **warm them until hot**. **Cut the garlic and press the hot slices onto the sore**, using all ten slices. Then **apply moxibustion to the sore**, **seven times** (*qī zhàng*)—this is highly effective.\n\n**Another remedy**:\nTake **two *mù* measures of *leopard-spotted amaranth* (*bān māo*)**, roast one measure into a powder**, and **ingest it**. **Burn the other measure** until the smoke dissipates (*lìng juéyān*), then **apply the powdered residue to the sore**—this will cure it. **It is also effective if transmitted by arrows** (*yúshèwǎng*).\n\n**Another remedy**:\nPound **raw musk** (*shèxiāng*) and **raw garlic** (*dàsuàn*) together, **mix with sheep fat** (*yángzhī*), and **carry it in a small tube** (*xiǎo gǔnzi*) while traveling.\n\n**In the eastern regions**, sand-fleas are **found in all waters**. After bathing, **if tiny, hair-like needle pricks** (*rú máomáo zhēn cì*) are felt, **examine closely**—they will be visible. **Use bamboo leaves to scrape and remove them**.

Within **seven days**, the patient should recover. **If not**, **flying parasites** (*fēichóng*) **will then devour the person’s internal organs**, leading to death. **Be extremely cautious and do not treat lightly**.\n\n**Remedies for sudden overdose or poisoning-induced agitation (67th method)**:\n**If one overdoses on medicine**, feels **agitated and restless** (*fánmèn*), or **is severely poisoned**, leading to **agitation and impending death**, the following remedies apply:\n\n**Scrape a small amount of soil from the eastern wall**, **mix with one or two *shēng* measures of water**, and **drink it**—this is effective.\n\n**Another remedy**: dig a **rectangular pit** (*zuòkàn*) **two *chǐ* square and three *chǐ* deep** beneath the eaves (*wūliù xià*). Pour **seven *shēng* measures of water** into the pit, **stir it with an object** to create a mist (*lìng mò chū*), and **drink one *shēng* measure of the mist**. If the symptoms persist, **repeat the process**.\n\n**Another remedy**: pound *indigo plant* (*lán*), **extract its juice**, and **drink several *shēng* measures**. If no indigo is available, **wash blue silk** (*qīngguàn*) instead, **extract the juice**, and **drink it**—this also works.\n\n**For overdose-induced agitation**:\nDrinking **large amounts of fresh *kudzu root* juice** (*shēnggěrēn zhī*) is **highly effective**. If fresh kudzu is unavailable, **grind dried kudzu into powder**, **mix with water**, and **ingest five *hè* measures**. It can also be **boiled and consumed**.\n\n**Another remedy**: swallow **several raw egg yolks** (*jīzǐhuáng*)—this will cure it. If no improvement, **repeat**.\n\n**For overdose from mineral-based medicines**:\nPowdered **white duck droppings** (*báiyāshǐ*), **mixed with water and ingested**, will cure it.\n\n**Another remedy**: take **three *liǎng* measures of *rhubarb* (*dàhuáng*), two *liǎng* measures of *mirabilite* (*mángxiāo*), and **five *shēng* measures of fresh *Rehmannia root* juice** (*shēngdìhuáng zhī*), **boil until reduced to three *shēng* measures**, and **divide into three doses**. **Once vomiting occurs**, the illness will subside.\n\n**If one suddenly overdoses and vomits uncontrollably**:\nDrinking **one *shēng* measure of newly drawn water** (*xīnjì shuǐ*) will **stop the vomiting**.\n\n**If the overdose involves *croton seeds* (*bādòu*) and diarrhea persists**:\nPowder **dried ginger** (*gānjiāng*) and **turmeric** (*huánglián*), **ingest one *fāngcùn* spoonful**—this will cure it.\n\n**Another remedy**: boil **soybean juice** (*dòuzhī*) to **one *shēng* measure**, and **drink it**—this will cure it.\n\n**Supplementary Remedies (from *Wàitái Mìyào*)**:\n**For overdose or poisoning-induced agitation and impending death**:\nBurn **rhinoceros horn into powder** (*shāoxījǐ mò*), **mix with water**, and **ingest one *fāngcùn* spoonful**.\n\n**Remedies for sudden poisoning from various medicines (68th method)**.",

For smaller doses, **one *liǎng* measure** is also sufficient.\n\n**Maopu states**: One dose of **one *liǎng* measure**, taken **three times**, while supporting the victim in an upright sitting position, will ensure revival once ingested.\n\n**Another method**: **Duck blood** (*yāxuè*) and **chicken eggs** (*jīzǐ*) can also resolve it.\n\n**The following is a remedy that resolves one type of poison while also addressing many others**:\nTake **licorice** (*gāncǎo*), **chew it finely**, boil into a concentrated decoction, and drink the juice in large quantities. Also, eat **raw onions** (*cōng zhōng tì*) in abundance—both are excellent.\n\n**Another method**: Boil **large soybeans** (*dàdòu*), let them overflow, and drink the juice in large quantities. If no large soybeans are available, **fermented soybeans** (*zhǐ*) are also effective.\n\n**Another method**: **Indigo plant** (*lán qīng*) and **indigo fruit** (*lánzǐ*) can also universally resolve all poisons. Keep some stored for constant use.\n\n**Another secret method**: Boil **waterdropwort** (*jìbì*), strain into a concentrated juice, and drink **one to two *shēng* measures**. If none are available, boil and chew the leaves and swallow. It can also be made into a powder and ingested. This remedy is particularly effective among all antidotes.\n\n**Important note**: For all remedies involving boiling antidote juices, **do not drink them hot**. Poisons worsen when exposed to heat; it is best to drink them **slightly cooled**.\n\n**Note from the Prefect of Lingnan (Maopu)**:\nThe **Lingnan aborigines** (*lǐrén*) often poison people through food. Victims may not immediately notice, but gradually lose their ability to eat. Some may experience **a bloated heart** (*xīn zhòng*), **tightness and suffocation in the back** (*bèi jí mèn*), or **initial coldness resembling malaria** (*chán*). If symptoms are detected early, quickly take a **piece of white silver** (*bái yín*) and hold it in the mouth. After **one night**, if the silver changes color—**green** (*qīngsè*) indicates **indigo poisoning** (*lán yào*), **yellow or red** (*huángchì*) indicates **datura poisoning** (*yánhuā*). If the poisoning progresses further, the eyes may turn **green** (*qīng*) or **yellow/red** (*huángchì*), with **green** (*qīng*) still indicating **indigo poisoning** (*lán yào*) and **yellow/red** (*huángchì*) indicating **mold toxin poisoning** (*jùn yào*).\n\nThe aborigines have their own healers, who fear discovery and often **pretend to use three hundred *liǎng* measures of \"cowhead\" antidote** (*sāniǎo yào*) or **claim three hundred *liǎng* measures of \"silver\" antidote** (*yín yào*). The local leaders, through prolonged acquaintance, know these antidotes are commonly used, though the aborigines do not recognize the *Bencao* (classical pharmacopeia), so they fabricate these names. Their methods are as follows:\n\n**Initial Remedy (for aboriginal poisoning and to stabilize the patient)**:\n**Four *liǎng* measures of fresh ginger** (*shēng jiāng*), **three *liǎng* measures of licorice** (*gāncǎo*), toasted (*zhì*), cut, and decocted with **six *shēng* measures of water** to obtain **two *shēng* measures**. Divide into **three doses** and administer. Once the doses are complete, then search for the specific antidote to treat the poison.\n\n**Antidote Method**:\n**Four *liǎng* measures of *dichroa root* (*chángshān*)**, cut, and **four *qián* measures of white salt** (*bái yán*), decocted with **one *dǒu* measure of water** (*yī dǒu shuǐ*). Soak overnight, preferably on the **last day of the lunar month** (*yuè jìn rì*), or at **five o’clock on the first day of the month** (*yuè yī rì wǔ gèng*). Use an **earthenware pot** (*tǔ fǔ*), boil, and ensure **no slaves, dogs, or chickens** (*núpó jīquǎn*) witness the process. Reduce to **two *shēng* measures**, and **administer two doses in the morning** (*dàn fēn èr fú*). After ingestion, the patient will vomit shortly. Store the vomit in a **copper vessel** (*tóng qì*). If the vomit remains **green** (*qīngsè*) and does not break when held aloft with a stick for **five *chǐ* measures**, the poison remains. After **two days**, administer another dose.\n\n**Prefect Maopu’s Experience**:\nOnce, after drinking alcohol, a patient became poisoned. It took **over a month** before symptoms appeared. The local leader **Liang Fan** (*liáng fán*) prepared **soil-grown *dichroa root* (*tǔ chángshān*)**, calling it a **\"three hundred-head cow\" antidote** (*sāniǎo yào*). The patient ingested it and recovered. Afterward, for **twenty days**, they must avoid toxic foods. Only **cooked rice** (*zhǔ fàn*) can be consumed. Prefect Maopu has successfully treated **nine such cases** in total.\n\n**Another Method**:\n**Ten *liǎng* measures of *yellow vine* (*huáng téng*)**, which is abundant in Lingnan, cut and decocted with **one *dǒu* measure of water** to obtain **two *shēng* measures**. Divide into **three doses**. Once ingested, the internal poison will dissolve. If the poison is from **stephania-based aboriginal toxins** (*fángjǐ lǐrén yào*), regularly ingesting this vine will naturally prevent the poison from taking effect even if consumed.\n\n**Prefect Maopu states**: Regular ingestion of this vine **promotes urination** (*lì xiǎobiàn*). It has also cured many others.\n\n**Another Method**:\n**Ten *liǎng* measures of *Vitex trifolia* (*dōulín téng*)**, also abundant in Lingnan, known to all locals. The aborigines call it **\"three hundred *liǎng* measures of silver\" antidote** (*sānyín yào*). Its leaves are long and slender, with a **three *chǐ* measure creeping vine**. Cut fresh, decoct with **one *dǒu* measure of water** and **two *shēng* measures of wine** (*jiǔ*), to obtain **three *shēng* measures**. Divide into **three doses**. Once ingested, the poison will be expelled through urination. For **ten days**, avoid toxic foods. If symptoms persist, administer another dose, and recovery will follow.",

If **the medicine does not descend**, **lift the patient’s head** and **force-feed it down the throat**—**immediate relief will follow**. If **the condition persists**, **give another three pills**; **abdominal rumbling and expulsion of toxins** will occur, and the patient will recover. If **the jaws remain locked**, **pry them open** and **administer the medicine by force**—**once it reaches the throat, recovery is certain**.\n\nThe **Cui Family’s *Sea of Prescriptions*** states:\n**Corydalis turtschaninovii (Wei ling xian)** **disperses all pathogenic winds**, **unblocks the twelve meridians**. **Taken in the morning, it takes effect by evening**.
