A native of Xianyang in Jingzhao, he later relocated to Liujiang Village in Zhongnan. His mother conceived after dreaming an extraordinary dream, and he was born only after twenty-four months of gestation, on the twenty-second day of the twelfth lunar month in the second year of the *Zhenghe* reign of Emperor Huizong of the Song.\n\nFrom childhood, the Master stood apart from others. In adulthood, his physique was imposing, his beard and whiskers handsome. He was magnanimous and valorous, prizing righteousness and unconcerned with trivialities. In his youth, he pursued the path of a *jinshi*, enrolled in the imperial academy, and delighted in literary composition, his talent and wit swift and keen. Initially named Zhongfu, with the courtesy name Yunqing, he later entered the Dao and adopted his present names.\n\nIn the first year of the *Fuchang* reign of Qi—corresponding to the eighth year of the *Tianhui* reign of Emperor Taizong of Jin, when Liu Yu was enfeoffed as king and the state named Qi (the fourth year of the *Jianyan* reign of the Southern Song)—he was appointed to govern the lands beyond the Yellow River, though his jurisdiction did not extend to Qin. The years were marked by repeated famines, and people resorted to cannibalism.\n\nAt that time, in Liquan of Xianyang, only the Master’s family was wealthy enough to be considered prominent in both counties. His grandfather thus distributed surplus grain to relieve the starving. Those from afar who could not reach the distribution came to plunder, and over three hundred neighboring households followed suit, seizing what they could. As a result, the family’s wealth was entirely depleted.\n\nWhen the authorities dispatched soldiers to capture the offenders and apply the full rigor of the law, the Master declared, \"These are my starving neighbors, gathering what they find along the roads. I cannot bear to consign them to death.\" The officials, recognizing his virtue, released them without further inquiry, and the people marveled at his power.\n\nIn the fourth year of the *Zhenglong* reign of Emperor Hailing of Jin, the Master suddenly sighed, \"Confucius was free of doubt at forty, Mencius unshaken in heart at forty—yet here I remain, mired in mediocrity. Am I not a fool?\" From that time onward, his conduct grew less restrained, and his relatives reviled him, calling him \"harmed by wind\" daily. The Master accepted the name without protest. (In Guanzhong, those afflicted with madness were termed \"harmed by wind.\") Henceforth, he styled himself thus.\n\nThat year, in the sixth month, the Master became intoxicated at Ganhe Town when he encountered two men with unbound hair and felt cloaks, identical in age and appearance. Startled, he followed them and entreated earnestly. One of them slowly replied, \"This one may yet be taught.\" Thereupon, he imparted to the Master the oral formulas for cultivating the true. The Master was forty-eight that year, and later, in a poem commemorating the encounter, he wrote:\n*At forty-eight, the meeting came,*\n*The oral formulas brought swift gain.*\n\nThe figures he met were none other than the incarnations of Lü Dongbin, the Pure Yang Master of the Tang.\n\nOn the Mid-Autumn Festival of the fifth year, he encountered them again in Liquan. The Master hastened to bow, but the crowd laughed, \"You call yourself ‘harmed by wind’—how could you recognize a true immortal?\" The man invited the Master to drink, and when asked his origins, age, and surname, he replied, \"A man of Pu Prefecture, twenty-two years old,\" but did not disclose his surname. He left five secret texts with the Master, instructing him to read and then burn them, adding, \"Hasten east to the Bohai Sea to seek Tan Zhuoma.\" Soon after, they vanished without a trace.\n\nThe Master then abandoned his wife and studies, sent his second daughter to her betrothed’s family, and departed without a backward glance. He begged for alms in Langshe and inquired along the Zhongnan Mountains, his behavior resembling that of a madman, confounding all who saw him. Later, he built a hut in Nanshi Village, erecting a mound several feet high and digging a pit over a *zhang* deep, which he called his \"living-dead\" abode. He also styled himself \"Venerable Wang Harmed-by-Wind,\" hanging a placard above it that read: *Spirit Tablet of Wang Harmed-by-Wind*. At each corner of the hut, he planted a crabapple or pear tree. When his fellow hut-dweller, He the Harmonious, questioned him, the Master replied, \"I wish that one day the teachings of the four directions may unite as these trees have been planted.\"\n\nAfter three years, he moved to the waters of Liujiang in the north, where his every utterance seemed beyond the dust of the world. The villagers, long accustomed to dismissing him as \"harmed by wind,\" paid no heed to his words. Often, he carried a gourd and ladle as he wandered, singing and drinking. Those who did not scorn him would follow and join his revels, and the Master, ever magnanimous, never refused them. Once, returning from Ganhe with a chiseled pot of wine, a man called out, \"Harmed-by-Wind, will you share with me?\" The Master handed it over, and the man drained it in one gulp, then bade the Master fetch water from the Gan River to drink—it was the ambrosia of immortals. The man asked, \"Do you know Liu Haichan?\" The Master replied, \"How could I? I have only seen his portrait.\" The man laughed and departed. From that day forth, the Master never drank wine again; if invited, he would only drink water, yet when others grew drunk, he too would appear intoxicated.\n\nOne evening, he set fire to his own hut. The villagers rushed to extinguish the blaze, but the Master danced and sang amidst the flames:\n*For years I toiled with earnest care,*\n*Dwelling in Liujiang’s humble lair.*\n*Day by day, the dust of labor grew—*\n*Then sudden fire revealed the true.*\n*Now burned away, I rise above,*\n*And urge you all: let grievance cease.*\n*I tread a path you cannot know,*\n*Leaving but ashes where I go.*\n*On Penglai’s road, my steps are light,*\n*For I shall ne’er return to sight.*\n\nWhen asked the reason, he replied, \"In three years, someone will come to rebuild this place.\" Then he set out on his journey.\n\nThe Master once left a poem at Ganhe:\n*Leisurely I lift my gaze to the azure deep,*\n*Yet the leviathan I hook is not the mightiest beast.*\n\nAnd on the walls of Zisheng Palace in the Zhongnan Mountains, he inscribed:\n*The Master of Chongyang from Zhongnan came,*\n*Left the lung of earth, departed the capital’s frame.*\n*Pointed to Lantian, crossed Mount Hua’s height,*\n*Entered Nanjing, roamed the isles of the sea.*\n*Found a true friend, kept the immortal’s tryst,*\n*To Penglai’s shores, to honor the vow of his master.*\n\nHe once painted his own portrait, inscribing above it:\n*From whence did I come? By what path shall I go?*\n*One step unturned—yet a glance reveals all.*\n\nHe also drew a scroll of clouds, pines, and cranes, which he entrusted to his disciple in Liquan, Shi the Discreet. When he departed, he bid farewell to his fellow Daoists, exchanging poems that veiled his profound intent, though none understood.\n\nCarrying an iron pot, he begged for food along the way, saying, \"In the east, I have a green ear.\" Wending his way through the passes, he reached Dengzhou. One night, he returned to a Daoist abbey and inscribed on the wall a poem composed in Shaanxi:\n*Parted from Zhongnan’s waters and bamboo grove,*\n*No sons or grandsons left in my home.*\n*Three thousand li I sought a true friend,*\n*To lead me through the gate of deathless life.*\n\nAt dawn, he brushed off his robes and set out eastward.\n\nIn the seventh month of the seventh year of the *Dading* reign of Emperor Shizong, he arrived in Ninghai and went directly to the home of the scholar Fan Mingzhu. The master of the house was then hosting a fellow townsman, Ma Yifu, at his private residence. After some time, they met the Master and held him in high regard. Earlier, Yifu had dreamed of a crane emerging from the earth in his southern garden. When the Master arrived, they selected a site to build a hut, and the Master pointed to the very spot where the crane had risen, naming it \"Complete Perfection.\" Thus did the name *Quanzhen* originate.\n\nThe Master wished to journey west, but Yifu, though wealthy, delayed, and his wife, née Sun, proved even more reluctant. In the tenth month of winter, the Master entered a bare cell, agreeing with Yifu to spin hemp for a single meal each day and to lock himself in the hut for a hundred days. He divided pears, taro, and chestnuts between Yifu and his wife, each portion measured precisely. With every distribution, he would compose a poem or song, to which Yifu would respond in kind. The Master also revealed the karmic consequences of transgressions to admonish them. When the door was finally opened, Yifu cast aside his worldly burdens, changed his attire, and assumed the role of a disciple. The Master named him *Ren*, styled him *Xuanbao*, and gave him the sobriquet *Master Dan Yang*.\n\nEarlier, when the Master resided at Yifu’s estate, a certain Tan Yu, afflicted with a chronic ailment, came to seek an audience. The Master initially refused him, but Yu persistently entreated to become his disciple and was permitted to lodge in the hut. His condition soon showed marked improvement. Thereupon, Yu dismissed his wife and followed the Master, who bestowed upon him the name *Chuduan*, styled him *Yitongzheng*, and gave him the sobriquet *Master Changzhen*.\n\nSubsequently, a certain Zhu Gong, dwelling on Ox Immortal Mountain, heard of the Master’s arrival and came to pay his respects. Their exchange proved enlightening, and Zhu Gong took the Master as his teacher. Later, he resided in Cloudlight Grotto on Iron Rake Mountain, where the Master, by means of a flying canopy, conveyed his ordained name and title: *Chuyi*, with the sobriquet *Master Sanyang*.\n\nThere was also Hao Sheng, well-versed in the *Book of Changes*, who divined fortunes in the marketplace. The Master entered his stall and sat with his back turned. Sheng said, “Sir, pray turn your head.” The Master replied at once, “Why do *you* not turn your head?” Sheng was struck with awe. The Master departed, and Sheng followed him to Chaoyuan Abbey, where the Master imparted two lyrics to elucidate profound truths. Sheng was deeply moved and awakened, thereafter assuming the role of a disciple. Later, at Misty Glow Grotto, the Master granted him the name *Lin*, the sobriquet *Master Tianran*, and bestowed upon him a robe of unlined cloth.\n\nBefore long, the Master led Ma Gang and others to Kunjian Mountain. Upon arrival, he pointed and declared, “Here lies Misty Glow Grotto, where my forebears once cultivated the Dao.” He ordered it excavated, and though the tools had rotted away, the jade pool and well remained. Later, as they quarried stone from the ridge, a massive boulder threatened to crash down upon the hut. The Master shouted at it sternly, and it halted abruptly, standing firm. Woodcutters and gatherers on the mountain witnessed this and were astonished.\n\nAt that time, Qiu Gong of Bingxia, though only nineteen, had already entered the Dao but had yet to find a teacher, lingering instead on Kunlun Mountain. Hearing that the Master was at Quanzhen Abbey, he presented himself during the ritual meal.\n\nThe Master, recognizing his great potential, presented him with a poem and bestowed upon him the name *Chuji*, the courtesy name *Tongmi*, and the sobriquet *Master of Eternal Spring*. From then on, disciples gathered in considerable numbers. The Master disciplined them with scolding, flogging, and rigorous trials, and most gradually dispersed. Only Ma, Tan, and Qiu remained steadfast in their resolve.\n\nIn the eighth month of the eighth year, the Master moved from Misty Glow to Jiangshi Hut in Wendeng. By the ninth month, he resided at Suzai Hut north of the county. In the fourth month of the ninth year, Zhou Botong of Ninghai invited the Master to establish the Golden Lotus Hall and the Golden Lotus Assembly. The well water there had long been brackish, but after the Master chanted over it, it turned sweet and pure. One night, a radiance as bright as daylight appeared. People, mistaking it for fire, rushed to see and witnessed the Master walking with luminous light trailing behind him.\n\nThe Master once instructed Ma Gang’s wife, Sun, named *Bu’er*, with the sobriquet *Serene Daoist*. He also showed her paintings of the celestial realms. On the fifth day of the fifth month, he had Bu’er burn her vow document and again presented her with a poem. He established the Seven Treasures Assembly in Wendeng, the Three Lights Assembly in Fuchuan, and the Jade Flower Assembly in Dengzhou.\n\nWhile visiting Penglai Pavilion to observe the sea, a sudden gale arose. People saw the Master carried by the wind into the sea. After a moment, he leapt out again, though his hairpin and cap were lost. Later, they floated to the surface and drifted ashore.\n\nThere was a man named Jie, who had long been devoted to good works and earnestly sought to leave the household life. The Master, however, refused him. After Jie departed, the Master remarked to others: “Here are two men who wish to build a great hall. The first has already laid the foundation and gathered ample timber. Before he could seek a craftsman, one arrived of his own accord—why? Because the materials are prepared, and the work can be completed. The second merely points to where the foundation should be, yet the ground is uneven, and no laborers have gathered. The craftsmen see this and depart.”\n\nWhen the Master was at Misty Glow, Zhang Dezhao had a son, bright and only sixteen, whom he sent to the mountain to study. As the boy had a deep karmic connection from past lives, the Master repeatedly explained the principles of the Dao through songs, poems, and two paintings. Later, the boy left the mountain to visit his parents but never returned. The Master wrote to Dezhao, imparting further true teachings. Though the boy inwardly understood and revered them, and though he had the destiny of an immortal, he could not rouse himself from the dust of the world.\n\nWhenever the Master guided others, he carefully assessed their capacity. Thus, he addressed Dezhao’s son as *Little Zhang* rather than by his given name. Though he admonished him in every way, he could not bring him to fulfillment. Jie, on the other hand, pleaded earnestly to leave the household life, yet the Master ultimately refused him. Such were his methods.\n\nIn Laizhou, he established the Assembly of Equality, and from then on, people near and far were stirred. Over a thousand joined the assembly. The general proclamation of the five assemblies read: “Equality is the origin of the Dao and virtue, the source of purity and stillness, the root of the Jade Flower and Golden Lotus, and the wellspring of the Three Lights and Seven Treasures. It universally saves all beings and delivers the common people. Each person aspires to sprout the golden spore; none wander the dark path.\n\nThe Jade Flower is the origin of *qi*. The Golden Lotus is the ancestor of spirit. Spirit is the child of *qi*; *qi* is the mother of spirit. When mother and child meet, one becomes an immortal. Yet this requires true practice and true conduct: calming the mind, stabilizing intent, embracing the origin, guarding the One, preserving spirit, and consolidating *qi*—this is true practice. Cultivating benevolence, accumulating virtue, aiding the poor, relieving suffering, putting others before oneself, and acting without selfishness—this is true conduct.”\n\nThere were also the *Determining Fate of the Golden Lotus* memorial, the *Enlightenment* memorial, the *Three Lights* memorial, the *Jade Flower* memorial, the rules of the Assembly of Equality, and various poems, most of which are not recorded here.\n\nLater, the Master traveled back and forth between Dengzhou, Laizhou, and Ninghai. Whenever he departed, he left poems as farewells. In the ninth month, he took Ma, Tan, and Qiu and journeyed west. Passing through Dengzhou, the prefect, Heshelie Miao, received him with the rites due a master. At parting, Miao asked, “When shall we meet again?” The Master replied, “In Nanjing.” Later, after the Master’s ascension, Miao was appointed vice military commissioner of Nanjing.\n\nThe Master also pointed to the painted bridge outside the Wangxian Gate and told the townspeople, “In years to come, when you cross this bridge, it will surely collapse.” A full cycle of twelve years later, the prefect He Bangyan, deeming the bridge’s structure too steep for carriages and horses, ordered it rebuilt. Such were the instances of his foresight.\n\nUpon reaching Yecheng, he gained another disciple, a man named Liu, who had first come with his mother to pay respects.\n\nUpon first meeting Liu, the Master immediately perceived his destiny to leave the household life and explained this to him, to which his mother gladly assented. He bestowed upon him the name Chu Xuan and the sobriquet Master of Longevity, whereupon Liu took his leave to follow the Way. By this time, those known as Ma, Tan, Liu, and Qiu had all gathered beneath the Master’s teaching.\n\nThus the *Bamboo Staff Song* declares:\n*\"O’er seas I sought true friends to come,\nYet who could bear my trust and home?\nLast night in dreams I saw them gleam—\nFour rainbows leapt in radiant stream.\"*\nThis verse foretold their meeting.\n\nThe poems and events surrounding these beginnings are recorded in their respective biographies.\n\nThe Master arrived in Nanjing and lodged at the Wang family inn. At the time, Meng Zongxian, a friend of his, had returned from his post as vice prefect of Shanzhou due to his mother’s mourning. There was a certain Master Shenfeng, Du Ge by name, who had once prophesied four auspicious events for Zongxian, all of which came to pass. Zongxian thus revered him as an immortal. One day, Du suddenly told Zongxian, “The Marshal has arrived. I must pay my respects.” Zongxian instructed his servants to follow discreetly. Du proceeded directly to the Wang inn, where he knelt on one knee before the Master. The Master, lying down and reading, paid him no heed. Zongxian, who held Du in high regard, was astonished upon hearing this. Du returned a second time, and the Master at last glanced at him. On the third visit, the Master smiled and looked his way, whereupon Du departed in jubilation.\n\nZongxian then went to pay his respects himself. The Master continued reading, offering no greeting. When asked what he was reading, he did not reply. Zongxian drew nearer and saw it was the *Collection of Lyric Poems*. He asked, “Is this the complete edition?” The Master said, “Only one volume.” Zongxian said, “I have the full collection at home. You may read it.” He promptly had it sent over.\n\nFrom the day the Master arrived in the capital, he had sent Ma Gang and the other three to beg for money in the market. They would buy a carp by the catty, cook it, and eat it—if the scales did not measure a full catty, they would not eat. Zongxian was perplexed, musing, *A Daoist reading the *Collection of Lyric Poems*—this is already unseemly. And now he eats fish, insisting on its exact weight. What manner of man is this?*\n\nAnother day, Zongxian asked if he had finished the *Collection of Lyric Poems*. The Master said nothing but returned the original volume. Zongxian examined it and found that between the blank lines, every poem had been matched with a response. He could not help but sigh, “The words of an immortal!” He then bathed, changed his clothes, burned incense, and sought instruction, his reverence deepening day by day.\n\nFrom then on, the Master no longer ate fish, for he had intended this as a sign to Zongxian, who was a great carp in a past life. The Master then ordered Ma Gang to summon craftsmen to build a single-seat wind carriage. When the work was completed, the Master said, “Recently, fire has scorched my eyes, and I cannot see. Light a lamp and hold it close to illuminate them.” Ma Gang instantly understood.\n\nThe Master also purchased four carp from the market, threaded them, and dragged them into the inn.\n\nHaving boiled two catties of mutton alongside them until done, he stored them away for over a month, by which time the fish and meat had all rotted and spoiled. He then ordered his disciples to eat it. At the time, each had vowed to abstain from meat and strong flavors, and none dared partake. The Master pressed them, and all said they dared not. Only Ma Gang prostrated himself and said, “If the Master commands it, your disciple will eat.” The Master rebuked him, “You yourself cannot sever attachment—do you seek to shift the blame onto me?” Thereupon, he gave him a full bowl. The Master then said, “When you reach Guanzhong, you will find no such thing to eat.” For several mornings, he first had Gang eat the mutton and fish, then sent him to buy wine. He purchased steamed jujubes and honeyed sweets from the market and ate them himself. Turning to Gang, he asked, “Do you understand?” Gang had not yet grasped the lesson, so the Master intensified his harsh instruction, railing, beating, and berating him without regard for day or night, saying, “One day, you will surely awaken.” Gang bowed in gratitude, “I am indebted to the Master’s compassionate teaching; I have nothing with which to repay you.” The Master said, “Only through cultivation can you repay me.”\n\nLater, upon entering Guanzhong, Gang at last understood that all the events in the capital had been profound teachings. During the twelfth lunar month, the Master subjected Gang and the others to extreme trials, refining them relentlessly. Of the hundreds and thousands who had once followed, only a few remained, their every action and word met with scolding, their conduct upended. As the disciples had collected much money and goods, the Master purchased firewood and charcoal, burning them in great quantities in the small chamber where they slept. He ordered Ma Gang to sit upright inside, while Liu Chuxuan and Qiu Chuji stood outside. Those within could not endure the heat, while those without could not bear the cold. Chuxuan, unable to withstand it, fled. The Master then arranged the three before his bed and said, “Danyang has attained the Dao, Changzhen has comprehended the Way—I have no concerns. As for Chuji’s learning, let it be guided by Danyang and Chuxuan; Changzhen shall oversee him.” Turning to Chuji, he said, “This disciple’s future standing will be extraordinary; he will surely expand the gates of the teaching.”\n\nAt the start of the first lunar month, the Master took leave of the assembly, saying, “Now is the time to keep my true master’s appointment.” Ma Gang and the others begged for a parting gift. The Master replied, “Long ago, I wrote on the wall of Lü the Daoist’s hut in Luancun, Jingzhao, and composed a verse:\n\n*Earth’s lung, the Master of Chongyang,*\n*Called ‘Wang the Harmful Wind.’*\n*Coming, he lingered long in sun and moon;*\n*Departing, he roams west and east at will.*\n*Cloud and water his companions,*\n*Void and emptiness his neighbors.*”\n\nOne true spirit remains, its nature unlike the hearts of the multitude.\nHe cautioned them not to weep, and with those words, shed his mortal form.\nThe assembly wailed in grief, but the Master suddenly opened his eyes and said, “Why go to such extremes?”\nHe entrusted Ma Gang with the affairs to come, saying, “When you reach Guanzhong, convert my fellow villagers.”\nHe then imparted secret instructions, commanding, “Do not transmit them lightly.”\nMa Gang bowed twice and received them.\n\nTurning to Tan Chuduan and the others, he said, “Your future paths all lie in Master Ma’s hands.”\nThen he wrote a poem titled *Beyond-World Kin*:\n*One brother, one nephew, two sons—*\n*With me, five recluses in cultivation.*\n*Bound as true kin beyond the world,*\n*We cast off the false corpses of the dust.*\n*All around, we plant scenes of purity,*\n*Passing on the purple灵芝 in turn.*\n*Together we ascend the mountain to the Golden Flower Assembly,*\n*While I first journey to Penglai to pay homage to my master.*\n\nHaving written this, he passed away in an instant. He was fifty-eight years old. It was the fourth day of the first lunar month in the tenth year of the Dading era.\n\nHis disciple You said to the assembly, “As his disciple, I shall oversee the funeral rites.”\nHe performed daily offerings with utmost care, and when the coffin was later moved west, he did not slacken in the least.\nHe told his son, “Five of us received the transformative guidance of Master Chongyang Wang. I am one of them.”\n\nMa Gang and the others arrived at Lü the Daoist’s hut in Luancun, Jingzhao, where they found the verse he had written.\nThey also exchanged poems with Li Lingyang of Yuchan at Zhongnan. While the Master was in Nanjing, he had sent a poem to the two, containing the line: *“First I departed, and the three of us became one.”*\nWhen they met Shi Mi of Liquan, he produced an old diagram, and all the signs aligned.\nTogether, they repaired the Master’s former hut.\n\nThe Master had never been esteemed by his hometown, but when Ma Gang arrived in Qin, the people only then began to regret their neglect.\nLater, Ma Gang and his companions returned to Nanjing to retrieve the coffin and interred it at Liujiang.\nThey built a hut and remained for three years before each followed their own path.\nMa Gang succeeded the teaching, and with Tan, Liu, and Qiu, became the leading figures of the lineage. The Quanzhen school honored Zhong, Lü, and Liu as the Three Patriarchs, and the Master as the Grand Patriarch.\n\nIn the sixth year of the Zhiyuan era of the Great Yuan (1269), the imperial court bestowed upon him the posthumous title *Chongyang Quanzhen Kaihua Zhenjun* (True Lord Chongyang, Opener of the Quanzhen Teaching).\nHis collected works, *The Quanzhen Anthology of Concealed Radiance*, circulated in the world.\n\nMinister Dao Yi said:\n*“When the royal is insufficient, the imperial arises; when the imperial is insufficient, the kingly arises; when the kingly is insufficient, the hegemonic arises. When even the hegemonic is insufficient, it is the misfortune of the Dao.*\n*How sublime is Quanzhen, rising as a hero in the Central Land!*\n*It turned the decadent back to primordial simplicity, transformed the stubborn to yearn for non-action.*\n*One master initiated it, and the Seven Perfected harmonized with him.*\n*Magnificent and grand! In this age of statecraft,*\n*Its power did not yield to the Five Hu,*\n*Its virtue did not fall short of the Tuoba.*\n*The Mandate’s continuity was indeed preserved.*\n*Yet Heaven initiated the teaching of the Mysterious Origin, bestowing blessings upon all beings. The Dao was not lost, enduring to this day—this is the achievement of Quanzhen.”*\n\nThe *Daode Jing* says:\n*“The Great Dao flows everywhere, to left and right.*\n*All things depend on it for life, yet it does not refuse.*\n*Its work is accomplished, yet it claims no merit.*\n*It nurtures all things yet does not act as their master—thus it may be called ‘small.’*\n*All things return to it, yet it does not act as their master—thus it may be called ‘great.’*\n*Therefore, the sage never strives to be great, and so achieves greatness.”*\n*Is this not the essence of Quanzhen?*\n\n**Ma Yu**\nThe Master’s original name was Congyi, styled Yifu. Later, he took the name Gang, styled Xuanbao, and changed it again. His Daoist name was Danyangzi.\nHe was a descendant of General Ma Yuan of the Han, originally from Fufeng. Due to the warfare of the Five Dynasties, his family relocated to Ninghai. His family had long been scholars.\nHis grandfather, Jue, styled Shensou, was filial and well-versed in the Five Classics.\nHis father, Shi Yang, styled Xixian, was dignified and composed, known for his filial piety and integrity.\nIn his youth, a guest fled in alarm, leaving behind an oilcloth bundle at his home. Inside was gold. He informed his father, who ordered him to keep it until the owner returned.\n\nA fortnight later, the guest returned. He was immediately given the gold, and the guest expressed his gratitude, saying, “I am Lü Dongbin, dwelling in Yougu Village. My family has long made a living from pottery and kiln work. I had obtained two *yi* of gold and was about to make offerings at the market when I was pursued by the tax inspectors. Thanks to your kindness, I escaped. Please accept half as a token of my gratitude.” Xixian declined, refusing to accept it. Lü said, “You possess the yellow countenance of one who turns toward the wind; in the future, a lofty scholar shall emerge from your family.” Later, when he sought out Yougu Village, he found no one of the Lü surname and only then realized its strangeness.\n\nXixian had five sons, named after the virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness, and they were known as the \"Five Constants of the Ma Clan.\" The Master was the second son. When his mother was pregnant with him, she dreamed of the goddess Magu bestowing a single cinnabar pellet, which she swallowed. Upon waking, she felt an auspicious radiance. This occurred on the twentieth day of the fifth month in the first year of the Tianhui era of Emperor Taizong of Jin.\n\nIn his childhood, the Master often recited phrases about riding clouds and driving cranes. As he grew, though well-versed in Confucian studies, he took no joy in seeking official advancement. His father, fond of his talent, entrusted him with managing the family’s storehouses. He was generous in aiding others and free from selfishness, thus earning a reputation for valuing wealth lightly and delighting in charity.\n\nLi Wumeng saw him and marveled, saying, “His forehead bears the mark of three mountains, and his hands hang past his knees—truly the bearing of a great immortal!” He praised him further, saying, “His body is majestic, his face round, his ears long, his brows refined, his eyes bright, his nose straight, and his mouth square. His auspicious features are complete, and his crown radiates divine light.” Yifu received this prophecy and, in step with the Lotus Manor, took up residence there.\n\nBefore long, after his elixir was refined, Sun Zhongxian of the loyalist faction betrothed his daughter to the Master. They had three sons: Tingzhen, Tingrui, and Tinggui.\n\nThe Master once sat for the prefectural examination. One night, he dreamed of two men, both clad in coarse brown robes. One had plain patches on both shoulders and wept as he addressed the Master, saying, “We number over a hundred thousand, and our lives rest in your hands.”\n\nHaving spoken thus, they departed. He pursued them into the pigpen of the butcher Liu Qingcai, where upon the wall were written these words:\n\n*\"We, the hundred thousand of Ji-Hai,\nMore than half were slain in Xin-Si’s year.\nIf this gate knows no mercy,\nIn lives to come, your axle’s hub shall ever smear.\"*\n\nAwakening, he heard the sounds of slaughter rising—there was Qingcai’s young son, A’er, binding two pigs, one of which, its shoulder already white, had just been killed. Then he understood: *Ji-Hai* was the cyclical sign of the pen, and *Xin-Si* that of Qingcai’s age. The Master, deeming the dream inauspicious, summoned the diviner Sun Ziyuan to interpret it and inquire into his lifespan. Ziyuan said, “Your years will not exceed forty-nine.” The Master was deeply awakened, saying, “Is life and death truly not in man’s hands? I must seek those who have attained the Dao and learn the Way of long life and enduring vision.”\n\nAnother time, while playing chess with a guest, he would often recite to himself, *“If this move is not mistaken, I shall not die.”*\n\nIn the seventh month of the seventh year of the Dading era under Emperor Shizong, he drank with Gao Jucai of Liaoyang and his fellow townsman Zhan Shi at the *Yi Lao* Pavilion of Fan Mingshu. As the wine flowed freely, the Master inscribed a poem:\n\n*“Embracing the One and guarding unity—this is the work,\nYet even lazy men now lack such skill.\nAll day I hold the cup to roam my spirit’s bound,\nAnd in my drunkenness, that man comes to prop me up.”*\n\nNone present grasped its meaning.\n\nThe day after the Zhongyuan Festival, the Patriarch Chongyang arrived from Mount Zhongnan and entered the *Yi Lao* Pavilion directly. Zhan Shi asked, “In coarse cloth and bamboo hat, braving the heat to hasten here—why such diligence?” The Patriarch replied, “An old pact with immortals, and a search for one who knows me.” After eating a melon, he began from the stem. Asked why, he said, “Sweetness comes from bitterness.” When asked whence he came, he answered, “A thousand *li* distant, I come especially to support a drunken man.”\n\nThe Master thought silently, *“In my earlier poem, I spoke of ‘that man coming to prop me up’—how does this man know?”* He then asked, “What is the Dao?” The Patriarch replied, *“Where the Five Phases do not reach,\nBefore father and mother were born.”*\n\nMingshu said, “These ten words alone exhaust the subtlety—could any but a divine immortal utter them?” As they sat in conversation, the Patriarch’s words resonated deeply with the Master. The Master invited him to his private residence and became his disciple.\n\nAt first, the Master dreamed of a crane emerging from the earth. Later, he built a hut in the southern garden at the very spot where the Patriarch had pointed to the crane’s rising, naming it *Quanzhen* (\"Perfect Realization\"). The Patriarch was determined to take the Master on a journey west, but the Master, burdened by family affairs, could not easily abandon them. The Patriarch then expounded at length on the loftiness of leaving one’s homeland and the encumbrances of remaining, offering him enlightenment. From then on, the Master’s bond with the Patriarch deepened daily.\n\nThat year, in the tenth month, the Patriarch instructed the Master to lock his hut and subsist on a single meal each day. It was the depths of winter, with wind and snow sweeping in from all sides, yet the hut contained nothing but brush, inkstone, pillow, mat, a coarse robe, and straw sandals. Nevertheless, his spirit and form remained serene, as if bathed in the warmth of spring. Those who understood called it the wonder of a perfected one turning a frozen valley to spring.\n\nOn the first day of his seclusion, the Patriarch gave him a pear, telling him to eat it. Every six days, he received six taro roots and six chestnuts. On the eleventh day of the month, the pear was divided in two, and he shared it with his wife. Thereafter, the six-day taro and chestnuts and the ten-day pear became a regular schedule. The taro and chestnuts remained as before, but the pear increased by one every ten days. By the ninetieth day, the total had accumulated to fifty-five.\n\nEach time the Patriarch sent these provisions, he embedded subtle meanings in poems or lyrics, to which the Master responded in kind. Interpreters said: *Taro* (芋) signifies *encounter* (遇), and *pear* (梨) signifies *separation* (离). To establish an encounter is to embrace the principle of separation. Moreover, *division* (分) means *reduction upon reduction*. Fifty-five is the number of heaven and earth’s odd and even, intended to lead one to sever ties with kin and village until nothing remains unsevered.\n\nThe Patriarch also warned him in a dream with ten transgressions against the ten precepts. On the eleventh day of the first month of the eighth year, the lock was removed. The Patriarch said, “We will depart in three or four days. Follow me and return.” He then composed a verse:\n\n*Strange indeed! A hundred days of wind sealed in a hut.*\n\nThereupon, the Master entrusted his property to Tingzhen and others, left a letter of farewell for the Sun family, and went to the marketplace to beg. The Patriarch, recalling the Master’s dream of refining white into yellow—a formula for immortality—bestowed upon him his present name and title. In another dream, the Master followed the Patriarch into a mountain. At dawn, the Patriarch called out, “Shan Tongyin shall be your childhood name.”\n\nIn the second month, he accompanied the Patriarch to the Misty Grotto of Kunyu Mountain. Suddenly, he suffered an unbearable headache, and the Patriarch sent him home for treatment. One day, the Patriarch said to his disciples, “Master Ma has broken the Dao.” When asked how he knew, he replied, “Last night, I dreamed of drinking wine. I sent someone to inquire, and it turned out the medicine required wine as a catalyst. Unaware, he drank too much, worsening his condition.” The messenger returned, saying, “Master Ma is near death.” The Patriarch clapped his hands and said, “I searched three thousand *li* for this true friend—how could it end like this? Because his faith was not steadfast, he brought this illness upon himself. A sip of dharma-water will cure him.” He then sent a true teaching:\n\n*“All who study the Dao must first adhere to these twelve words: renounce wine, lust, wealth, anger, attachments, love, worries, thoughts, and anxieties. From now on, there is nothing more to say. If you do not follow this, even if you refine the elixir of immortality, you will not attain liberation of life and spirit.”*\n\nIn the eighth month, the Patriarch was at Jiangshi Hut in Wendeng. He warned his disciples in advance, “If Master Ma comes, do not let him in.” On the first day of the ninth month, the Master arrived as expected. The Patriarch sent word: “If we meet now, we will not meet later; if we are to meet later, we will not meet now.” The Master pleaded for a future meeting, so he was allowed to stay at Su’s Hut north of the county.\n\nIn the tenth month, the Patriarch ordered the Master to burn his vow document and presented him with a poem:\n\n*You cast the golden hook just a year ago,\nNow you swallow the fragrant bait, led by the line.\nOn Jade Capital Mountain, you transform into a roc,\nFollowing me in a whirlwind into the grotto-heaven.*\n\nOn the fifth day of the fifth month, the Patriarch was at Golden Lotus Hall. He had the Sun family burn their vow document and move to a separate hut. On the eleventh day, he summoned the Master to Fan Mingshu’s residence and presented him with a lyric, which the Master did not accept. Though briefly allowed to stay, he was soon driven out again. Later, in Nanjing, they finally lived together.\n\nThe Patriarch wished the Master to raise funds in Ninghai, but the Master declined, citing his vow never to return home. The Patriarch grew angry and beat him from night until dawn. They traveled west, reaching Bianliang, where they lodged at Wang’s inn for some time. The Patriarch subjected the Master and others to even harsher trials—scolding, beating, and unpredictable treatment, whether kind or harsh. Every aspect of their diet and daily life was imbued with immortal subtleties.\n\nAs the year drew to a close, the Patriarch addressed the assembly: “Now is the time to fulfill my true destiny.” The Master asked for a final verse, and the Patriarch replied, “I have already written it in Guanzhong.” On the fourth day of the first month of the tenth year, he entrusted his last instructions and passed away.\n\nThe Master and the others raised funds, carried the Patriarch’s remains to Jingzhao, and buried them at Liujiang, as per his final command. They then built a ring of huts around the Patriarch’s former abode and observed three years of mourning, wearing their hair in three topknots. These three topknots represented the three auspicious characters of the Patriarch’s taboo name, which the Master revered and adopted, often calling himself *Santiji Shan Tongyin* (\"Three Topknots Mountain Child\").\n\nOnce, he and Qiu, Liu, and Tan gathered at the Zhenwu Temple in Qin Crossing on a moonlit night, each declaring their aspirations. The Master said, *“The nation is poor”*; Tan said, *“The tide is right”*; Liu said, *“The nation’s will”*; and Qiu said, *“The nation is at leisure.”* Though all had emerged from Chongyang’s lineage, the Patriarch had once spoken of “one disciple and one nephew,” so the Master was specially addressed as *Shishu* (\"Master Uncle\").\n\nIn the fifteenth year, his younger brother Yunfu sent a letter inviting him to attend their parents’ burial. The Master replied: *“You bury bones; I deliver spirits. Our paths differ, but our hearts in repaying kindness are the same.”* He responded with a lyric on refining cinnabar.\n\nThe Master once composed *Ten Exhortations* and *A Hundred Negations*. One day, he showed them to the assembly, saying, *“This is not my own idea—it was originally the Patriarch’s teaching, which I completed.”*\n\nThe Master further asked his disciples, *“How many periods are there in a day and night?”* They replied, *“Twelve.”* The Master said, *“Within these twelve periods, the Dao of Heaven revolves, governing the workings of creation—does it ever pause or rest?”* They answered, *“We do not know.”* The Master said, *“Those who study the Dao must emulate the Dao of Heaven, governing the workings of creation within their own bodies. In all twelve periods, remain ever pure and ever still, without the slightest dust-like thought arising. As days pass and months progress, once your efforts reach fruition, immortality is assured.”*\n\nIn the eighteenth year, he departed for Huating. Liu Zhaoxin, Li Dacheng, and more than ten others failed to grasp his meaning, so he composed a poem containing the lines: *“The brocade-scaled fish eludes the empty casting; I gather my jade rod and return.”* Dacheng then awakened and, performing the rites of a disciple, was granted the name *Lingyangzi*.\n\nThe Master resided in Huayang Pavilion. Outside its walls stood a *laiqin* tree, long withered. On the fourth day of the fourth month, the Master drew water from the encircling moat to water it. Just then, his disciple Yao Xuan presented the genealogy of the Pure Yang Perfected, asking him to punctuate it. Only then did he learn that Pure Yang had been born beneath this very tree on the fourteenth day of the fourth month. The Master said, *“I was born on the twentieth day of the fifth month. By that day, this tree will have sprouted leaves.”* Dacheng privately remarked to others, *“The summer solstice is not far off—can it truly revive?”* The Master composed a verse: *“Thirty-six above, thirty-six below; Heaven and Earth enter the precious vessel, and the seventy-two seasonal nodes are complete.”* Li asked for an explanation, but the Master replied, *“This is a hidden saying—how could it be easily understood? Its fulfillment will come in time.”* On the appointed day, the tree burst into lush green leaves. They then realized that from the fourteenth of the fourth month to the twentieth of the fifth was thirty-six days, and the union of Heaven and Earth made seventy-two nodes. Dacheng thus composed *An Account of the Wondrous Tree*.\n\nThe Daoist friend Cui of Zhiyang read the account and doubted its excessiveness. In the fourth month, he transplanted two clumps of bamboo and a pine tree to the Quanzhen Hermitage. Due to the untimely transplanting, their branches and leaves yellowed and withered. Cui asked the Master, *“Can these pine and bamboo be revived?”* The Master replied with a poem containing the lines: *“Beyond the window, not only gentlemen turn green; before the hermitage, I rejoice that the great man flourishes.”* He then instructed his disciple Yu Zhiyi to remove the yellowed leaves and water the plants with his washing water. Within ten days, they had returned to their former luxuriance.\n\nThe Master led his disciples westward to Mount Kongtong, passing through Tingchuan. Officials and commoners alike thronged to seek his teachings, their shoulders rubbing and heels touching, fearful of being left behind. Moved by their sincerity, he patiently expounded the Dao without tiring. Even those who had once been arrogant and reckless reformed their hearts and minds, ashamed of their past misdeeds.\n\nIn the twentieth year, on the twenty-fourth day of the eighth month, the Master went to Chang’an to pray for rain. He composed a poem: *“One plow’s worth awaits fulfillment—when? Five times five, no more than twenty-five.”* The next day, the rain fell abundantly.\n\nIn the twenty-first year, while in Jingzhao, the Master asked his disciple Lai Lingyu, *“In Guanzhong, what do they call it when old clothes are taken apart and washed clean?”* Lingyu replied, *“They call it ‘unpicking and washing.’”* The Master said, *“The Eastern Teachings have grown old and corrupted over the years—I shall unpick and wash them.”* Before ten days had passed, an official document arrived, causing the Quanzhen community in Shaanxi to tremble in fear. Only Changchun said to Dacheng, *“Our Dao moves eastward. Though I am named in the document, I must not leave the Pass. If I depart, the teachings in Guanzhong will be swept away.”* The Master left the Pass, and wherever he went, the old and young vied to welcome and see him off.\n\nWhen he reached Jinan, a man named Han Taoqingfu, who admired the character of Shao Yaofu and named his residence the Garden of Peace and Joy, invited the Master to visit. He begged the Master for a teaching, who said, *“The Dao takes non-attachment as its essence, forgetting words as its function, softness and weakness as its root, and purity and stillness as its foundation. Restrain your diet, cut off distracting thoughts, sit quietly to regulate your breath, and sleep peacefully to nurture your qi. When the mind does not wander, the nature is settled; when the body is not wearied, the essence is preserved; when the spirit is not disturbed, the elixir congeals. Then, extinguish desires in emptiness, pacify the spirit in quiescence, and without leaving your courtyard, you will attain the wondrous Dao.”* Han bowed in gratitude, saying, *“The great Dao is vast and formless—there was nothing I could ask. Now, having heard your profound teaching, I have found the gate by which to enter.”*\n\nIn the twelfth month of the twenty-second year, the Master was proselytizing in Wendeng. The son-in-law of the fisherman Mr. Tan and others burned their nets at Langya. A sudden shift in the wind and snow revealed a mirage of a sea market, which the literati praised by reciting Su Dongpo’s poem on the sea market. The Master composed a poem in response.\n\nThe water of Golden Lotus Hall had long been brackish and bitter. The Master approached the well and rinsed it, and the water turned as sweet as fine wine. The people of the prefecture called it *Lingye* (“Numinous Liquid”) and built a pavilion with a stele to record the marvel.\n\nWhile at Seven Treasures Hermitage in Wendeng, the Master’s disciples dug a well nine feet deep but were blocked by a great stone. The Master then revealed a verse from the immortals of the grotto-heavens: *“Dig two feet deeper, and sweet springs will naturally respond to your pure chant.”* When they dug one foot and eight inches deeper, the spring gushed forth.\n\nOne day, the Master said to his disciples, *“Today, there shall be an extraordinary joy.”* He then sang and danced in delight.\n\nShortly after, word arrived: on the last day of the twelfth lunar month in the *renyin* year, Immortal Maiden Sun ascended in Henan Prefecture.\n\nShe once explained to her disciples the inner heaven and earth, saying:\n*“If one can remain perpetually pure and still,\nHeaven and earth will all return to you.*\nThe diaphragm and above is heaven;\nThe diaphragm and below is earth.\nWhen heavenly *qi* descends and earthly *qi* ascends,\nHarmonizing above and below,\nThe *qi* naturally becomes whole.”\n\nShe also spoke of the four bodily applications:\n*“When walking, place your feet on level ground;\nWhen standing, concentrate your spirit in the great void;\nWhen sitting, regulate the breath at the tip of your nose;\nWhen lying down, embrace the inner pearl within your abdomen.”*\n\nShe composed linked verses as well:\n*“In water, flames advance to form the Three Elixirs;\nWithin fire, a lotus blooms to perfect one’s nature.\nMale Dao-seekers, shed the illusion of self;\nFierce truth-cultivators, cast aside worldly sentiments.\nThe stone maiden plays the flute, phoenixes dance;\nThe clay ox enters the sea, tigers and dragons harmonize.\nThe Jade Crone of Exquisite Clarity strikes the dragon’s horn;\nThe Vigilant Golden Youth rides the tiger’s waist.”*\n\nSuch verses were numerous, all concerning the affairs within the Daoist’s body.\n\nLater, the Master returned to the sea. The First Patriarch had once established the Five Assemblies, which the Master then revived and expounded anew. Upon reaching Ninghai, one day he spoke to the butcher Liu Qingju and his household about a dream, saying: *“By my reckoning, over twenty years, the number of lives you have taken is now complete. If you do not change your trade, you will surely enter the Prison of No Inquiry.”* Qingju then burned all his butchering tools outside the city walls.\n\nIn the fourth month of the twenty-third year, the Master intended to visit Gao Village in Zhiyang. Along the way, nearly a hundred people gathered near him. Some remarked: *“From dawn until noon, a mirage appeared over the sea and has not yet vanished. Though such sights have occurred before, they could never be seen except at dawn. Today, with the Master’s arrival, this extraordinary event has come to pass.”* The local fishermen—Ju Fu, Guo Heng, Le Zhou, and others—without needing persuasion, gathered their nets and burned them on Mulberry Island.\n\nAfter noon, there appeared in response dragon-drawn chariots, crane-borne carriages, banners, feathered canopies, and other marvels. The scholar Hong Ru composed *A Record of the Sea Market’s Responsive Wonders*.\n\nOn the Festival of the Lower Prime, a Ninefold Yīn Offering was held at Mount Wen. That night, the Master heard a voice from the void announcing: *“The True Man of Chongyang has arrived.”* The next day at the hour of the evening meal, the First Patriarch appeared, wearing a blue headscarf and white robe, seated upon a white tortoise amidst a green lotus leaf. The tortoise wagged its tail. The assembly cheered, prostrating in the mud. The First Patriarch turned his body slightly outward and departed toward the southeast.\n\nOn the last day of the ninth month, the Master sat in incense-burning meditation with the monk Candle Discipline Master and the scholar Fan Shouqing at the Three Teachings Hall north of the city. Wang Daoshi of Yongzhou arrived bearing a zither and played it. As the sun turned westward, villagers gathered in throngs. The Master performed *The Melody of Returning to the Mountains*:\n\n*To be without doing—yet nothing left undone,*\n*To be without knowing—yet nothing left unknown.*\n*Who would not follow this Dao?*\n*Yet who truly knows it?*\n\n*The wind sighs through the trees as leaves take flight,*\n*The wild geese cry aloft, bound southward in their flight.*\n*Alas, the fleeting world—how time hastens on!*\n*Old age nears death, yet still men cling to folly and desire.*\n\n*Grieved by the world, my soul would take wing,*\n*Alas, the world—how it would break my heart!*\n*Hard to resolve—this world is not our home.*\n*Pointing to the green mountains, I say: return while time remains.*\n\n*By night, the green mountains gleam with moonlight’s glow,*\n*By dawn, the green mountains bid the moon farewell.*\n*Hunger fed on mist, thirst slaked by the stream,*\n*Cut off from the world—unknown to men.*\n\n*Without knowing, without doing,*\n*This heart extinguished—what more could be done?*\n*In the Heavenly Court, twin blossoms take flight,*\n*Ascending the Three Palaces, wandering the Purple Tenuity.*\n\nShortly after, he took up his brush and wrote *In Praise of Shedding Form*, its essence reading:\n\n*Great is the ascent to truth,*\n*The path leads into the azure void.*\n*Unicorns follow the crimson tassels,*\n*Phoenixes wield the vermilion plow.*\n*Jade chimes tinkle at the girdle,*\n*Walking the void, treading the clouds.*\n*Transcending to receive the true writ,*\n*Ascending to the Jade Dawn.*\n\nHere he veiled his intent to return to the Real.\n\nIn the twelfth month, on the anniversary of the First Patriarch’s descent, an offering was held at the Wandering Immortals Abbey in Laiyang. The Master repeatedly gazed beyond the clouds. His disciple Cao Suo asked the reason, and he replied: “The First Patriarch and Master He, my uncle, have arrived. I am bound for Penglai and Yingzhou.” Yu Zhiyi said: “The affairs here are vast—we beg you to remain in the world a while longer.” The Master said: “I depart in full majesty, to become a carefree immortal.”\n\nHe called Liu Zhenyi and instructed: “If you wish to become immortals, you must accumulate merit and pile up deeds. Even if you encounter a thousand trials or ten thousand hardships, never retreat or slacken. Only then may you grasp my words. When my eyes are open, I see; when they are closed, I see. Seeing does not depend on the eyes—only when the heart is clear will nothing remain unseen.”\n\nAs their conversation reached the second watch of the night, a great thunderclap shook the prefecture with a single peal. The Master laid his head on his arm and passed away, on the twenty-second day of the month.\n\nThat night, the Master knocked at the gate of the wine inspector Guo Fuzhong. Guo, who had never believed in such things, came out to greet him. The Master asked for a brush and wrote this verse:\n\n*Eighty-one years I lived,*\n*Yet none in the world knew me.*\n*A thunderous roar—one great cry,*\n*And I vanished like the wind, gone far away.*\n\nHe finished writing, bid farewell, and departed.\n\nThey urged him to stay, but he hurried away. On the wall of Liu Xi’s house, he left another verse:\n\n*Within the convergence of the Three Yangs, your practice reaches perfection,*\n*The wind-borne steed rides the wind—you have already become an immortal.*\n*I urge you to subdue the dragon and tiger,*\n*And you, too, shall naturally have your portion and ascend to heaven.*\n\nShortly after, word spread that the Master had already passed away, and they then realized that what they had seen were all manifestations of the Master’s yang spirit. After seven days, his spiritual form remained unchanged, and he was buried at Youxian.\n\nEarlier, while the Master resided at Zihua Hermitage beside Kunjian’s Zijin Mountain, dozens of great pines nearby turned white in their branches and leaves, remaining half-green for half a year. The Master sighed and said, *“The pines’ whiteness—could it be for me?”* In the first month of the twenty-fourth year, a *Changsheng* ritual was held in Changyang. On the eighteenth day, between the hours of *si* and *wu*, the scholar-official Xu Shaozu and others witnessed auspicious clouds, phoenixes, and cranes in the sky, shifting and dancing in indescribable forms. Chongyang appeared in a crimson robe with a cloud-shaped cap, and Danyang in white garments with three topknots, manifesting amid the clouds before vanishing after some time. This was later inscribed on a stele.\n\nIn the twenty-fifth year, the townspeople suspected that disciples from Shaanxi had stolen the immortal’s remains. Magistrate Liu of Laiyang opened the coffin to inspect them and found his countenance as if alive. They then re-clothed him in the Hall of Gold and Jade before reinterring him.\n\nThe Master’s songs and verses, including collections such as *Gradual Awakening*, *Gold and Jade*, *Gleaning the Subtle*, *The Three Treasures*, *Transforming Through Conduct*, and *Perfect Completion*, circulate in the world.\n\nIn the sixth year of the *Zhiyuan* era of the Great Yuan (the year *jisi* of the sexagenary cycle), the first month, he was posthumously honored as *Danyang Baoyi Wuwei Zhenren* (The Perfected One of Embracing Unity and Effortless Action).\n\n*Volume One of the Continuation of the Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao Throughout the Ages concludes here.*\n*Volume Two of the Continuation of the Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao Throughout the Ages begins.*\n\nMaster Tan Chuduan was initially named Yu, styled Boyu. Later, he was named Chuduan, styled Tongzheng, and given the sobriquet *Changzhenzi* (Master of Eternal Perfection) by the Patriarch. His family had long been natives of Ninghai. He was born on the first day of the third month in the first year of the *Tianhui* era of the Jin Emperor Taizong.\n\nFrom birth, his bone structure was extraordinary. At the age of six, he accidentally fell into a well. His family rushed to rescue him, only to find him seated calmly atop the water. When pulled out, he was unharmed. Another time, a fire broke out in his home, and a massive beam collapsed before his bed. Though he was fast asleep, when called to wake, his demeanor remained composed, as if nothing had occurred—people already knew he was no ordinary child.\n\nAfter entering school, he memorized texts with remarkable speed, surpassing his peers. At ten, he began studying poetry. One day, a relative pointed to a wooden grape trellis and asked him to compose a verse. His lines read: *\"One day I shall climb the azure dragon’s frame— / All who see will crane their necks to gaze.\"* The crowd marveled at his poise.\n\nAs he grew, he became unrestrained and careless of appearances, yet was renowned for his filial piety and righteousness. He delved into the classics and histories, mastering all, and was especially skilled in various styles of cursive and clerical script. Once, while drunk in the snow, he contracted a wind-induced paralysis. Knowing no medicine or stone could cure him, he secretly recited the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* to seek urgent relief. In a dream, the Great Emperor stretched across the sky, and the Master flew up to grasp him—only to find the Star Lords seated above while he bowed below. Startled awake, his resolve to follow the Dao was firmly set.\n\nIn the seventh year of the *Dading* era of Emperor Shizong, hearing that the Patriarch was staying at Ma Danyang’s home, he went directly and begged to be counted among his disciples. The Patriarch allowed him to stay the night in the hermitage. Though it was the depths of winter, he lay on seaweed without suffering the cold. The Patriarch extended his foot, bidding him hold it. Soon, sweat poured from him as if he were in a steamer. At dawn, the Patriarch used leftover water from washing his hands to cleanse his face, and his long-standing illness vanished at once. From then on, he devoted himself wholeheartedly to serving the Patriarch for life.\n\nOne day, his wife, Madam Yan, grew suspicious of his prolonged absence and came to inquire. The Master abruptly left her.\n\nThe Patriarch further commended his resolute renunciation and thus transmitted to him secret instructions, bestowing upon him his present name and title. He also presented him with a verse containing the words *\"Dazhen\"* and *\"Tanyu,\"* making his approval unmistakably clear.\n\nIn the eighth year, he followed the Patriarch into seclusion among the mist and clouds of Kunyu. In the ninth year, he accompanied him to Lushan in Huang County, at the Yan Zhen Guan. Near the place where the True Lord Lu had attained transcendence, the Master inscribed a poem on the western wall of the Jade Emperor’s Hall, with the lines:\n*\"Faint and fleeting, the wheel departs without return,\nPhoenix glue and crane chariot shatter the clouds in flight.\"*\n\nThat winter, he traveled with the Patriarch to Liang. In the spring of the tenth year, the Patriarch shed his mortal form at the Wang family inn. Together with Danyang and others, he carried the immortal remains to be buried in Liujiang Village on Mount Zhongnan, where they observed mourning for three years.\n\nIn the fourteenth year, he returned to the Pass and journeyed to the Chaoyuan Palace in Luoyang, where he inscribed a poem:\n*\"Since the Purple Edict summoned the Perfected One away,\nWho now shall succeed as the Great Luo Immortal?\"*\nThe Chaoyuan Palace was where Huang Langranzi had attained transcendence, and thus it was cherished by all near and far.\n\nIn Xiuwu, there was a man named Zhang Bage, who behaved as if mad or possessed, yet those who recognized his state deemed him a man of the Dao. One day, he cried out in the marketplace: *\"The one who comes is Master Tan, steward of the immortals!\"* Later, he resided in a hermitage at the Jun Temple in Xinxiang. Passing through Huojia County, he once again took lodging at an inn in the northern outskirts of Weizhou.\n\nThe temple official of Xinxiang, Wen Liu, suddenly saw the hermitage aglow with lamplight one night. Peering inside, he found the Master sitting alone before a fire. Wen bowed before him, and the Master acknowledged him slightly before vanishing without a word. Wen waited long, but the Master did not return. Approaching, he found no trace of him and hastily summoned the Daoist assembly to report the matter. They sent Zhu Si to Weizhou to inquire, and the innkeeper said: *\"The Master arrived here and has not left.\"* Zhu returned and informed the assembly, whereupon they realized it had been his yang spirit.\n\nIn the fifteenth year, while begging for alms at Erzu Town in Cizhou, a madman asked: *\"Where do you come from?\"* and suddenly struck the Master’s mouth with his fist, causing blood to flow and teeth to break. Yet the Master’s countenance remained unchanged. He spat the teeth into his hand, danced and leapt, and returned to his lodging. Those who witnessed it were enraged and wished to bring a lawsuit before the authorities, but the Master only said: *\"I thank him for his compassionate instruction.\"* At the time, Danyang was in Guanzhong and, hearing of this, praised him, saying: *\"One punch dissolves a lifetime of karma.\"*\n\nSuch were the marvels witnessed in the Master’s life.\n\nIn the sixteenth year, he arrived at Baijiatan in Luozhou. A farmer there had been ill for months, with no cure in sight. In a dream, he encountered a Daoist of imposing stature, who gave him a red medicine. Upon taking it, he recovered at once. The next day, seeing the Master, he exclaimed in astonishment: *\"This is the master who gave me medicine in my dream!\"* He wished to repay him with goods, but the Master declined and departed.\n\nOnce, he and Wang Silang of Junzhou prepared *Cunjin* pills together. The portion the Master received cured all ailments without fail, while Wang’s portion was only fourteen or fifteen percent effective. When they exchanged portions, the results remained the same. Only then did they realize that the efficacy lay not in the medicine alone, but in the divine power of the Dao and its methods.\n\nIn the seventeenth year, passing through Gaotang County, he encountered Wu Liu, a teahouse keeper who diligently served traveling Daoist adepts. The Master left behind the characters *\"tortoise\"* and *\"serpent\"* to hang in his shop, though Wu did not yet know they were from the true Master Tan. One day, a fire broke out in the neighboring houses, spreading widely, yet Wu’s shop alone remained untouched. People compared the two characters to the Pure Yang Perfected One’s fire-averting talisman. The Pure Yang had once left an inscription at a wineshop in Boxing County, and when the county was engulfed in flames, that shop alone was spared. Such talismans were commonly spoken of at the time.\n\nAnother time, while begging for alms in Yicun, he boarded a newly built boat to cross the river. When the vessel was about to enter the water, the gathered crowd pulled it, but their strength was insufficient to move it. The Master lent his aid, and it glided forward effortlessly. Thereafter, whenever monks or Daoists crossed the river, the boatmen willingly offered their hands to assist.\n\nTraveling east, he reached the north of Yangwu County. Rising in the night, he saw the Northern Dipper’s stars shift and revolve like a wheel. He hastily called the Daoist assembly to observe. The stars were then like parrot eggs, swaying unsteadily, but after a long while, they returned to their original positions. From then on, the Master recited the sacred name with utmost reverence.\n\nAt Qimen Town in Weizhou, Shi Kongmu asked the Master why he chanted so diligently. The Master replied: *\"All should chant. This year, there will be a great flood.\"* The assembly did not comprehend, but that year, the Yellow River breached its banks at Wanghongfu.\n\nIn the twentieth year, he journeyed west again to Xili Hermitage in Tongzhou. Disciples sought his calligraphy, and he invariably wrote the characters *\"tortoise\"* and *\"serpent,\"* the brushwork vigorous, evoking the coiled forms of dragons and snakes. To all who requested his writing, he gave these two characters. It was a veiled indication of his return date, though none initially understood. On the first day of the fourth month in the *yisi* year, he shed his mortal form, and the prophecy was fulfilled.\n\nIn the twenty-first year, while the Master was at the Pure Yang Cave in Huayin, sores appeared on his head. He said: *\"Am I about to die?\"* The assembly did not know how to respond. After a long while, he said: *\"I will not die now. If they appear on my feet, then I shall die.\"* Then he addressed the assembly, saying:\n*\"Six years to refine away the fire of ignorance,\nTen years to cultivate the elixir of bone-transformation.\nSerene and unobstructed, the empty hall,\nI know I’ve leapt beyond the gate of life and death.\"*\n\nHe also said:\n*\"Just ten years of learning to be foolish,\nWandering carefree, east and west.\nIf you ask about the Wind Child’s practice,\nIt’s when the fire dies with a soot-covered face and unkempt hair.\"*\n\nLater, he arrived east of the Chaoyuan Palace in Luoyang and obtained several acres of vacant land, where he built a hermitage and resided.\n\nIn the twenty-fifth year, he dreamed of Chongyang and Danyang, who informed him of the date of his immortal ascension. He instructed his disciples to prepare his funeral arrangements. Just then, sores appeared on his body, and he wrote a lyric:\n*\"A thunderclap at the moment of supreme harmony,\nBursts forth with a myriad rays of spiritual light.\nThe dragon, meeting swift thunder, sheds its old skin,\nSubtle and profound, golden light shoots from the crown and flies.\nOne nature hastens to the Jasper Pool,\nTo follow Danyang in companionship.\nClearly seen—the wondrous truth of Changzhen,\nSpontaneously arising, the yang spirit returns alone.\"*\n\nHaving finished writing, he reclined on his arm and passed away.\n\nIn the sixth year of the Zhiyuan reign of the Great Yuan, the cyclical year *jisi* (1269), in the first month, he was posthumously honored as the Perfected One of Cloud-and-Water, Accumulated Virtue, and Long Truth. His *Water and Cloud* collections, in two volumes, circulated in the world.\n\n**Liu Chuxuan**\nHis master’s name was Chuxuan, his courtesy name Tongmiao, and his sobriquet Changsheng. On the twelfth day of the seventh month in the seventh year of the Huangtong reign of Emperor Xizong of Jin (1147), he was born in Wuchen Village of Donglai. For nine generations, his ancestors had upheld filial piety and fraternal harmony. During the Taiping Xingguo era of Emperor Taizong of Song, the imperial court commended his family and exempted them from all corvée labor in their prefecture. In caring for relatives and aiding the poor, his grandparents continued the virtuous traditions of their forebears.\n\nHis mother, née Wang, once dreamed of an elder in white robes calling her to the southwest. Pointing, he showed her a jade tree with four branches, each bearing a golden leaf. He instructed her to take one, saying, *\"An extraordinary person will be born in the future.\"* As she reached for it, the leaf fell into her hand. Upon closer inspection, a golden cicada took flight, then returned to her mouth. The elder vanished without a trace. Thirteen months later, the master was born. That night, two streaks of purple *qi* stretched from Mount Taiji, piercing through their home.\n\nFrom childhood, the master was orphaned and served his mother with such filial devotion that it became widely known. His mother, too, harbored a desire to retreat from the world. Mount Taiji lay two *li* south of Wuguan. On its southern slope was the Valley of Daoists, where Zheng Daozhao, former governor of Guangzhou, had attained the Dao. The master often lingered there.\n\nIn his youth, his mother arranged a marriage for him. But he, having long cherished the aspiration to cultivate the Dao, firmly refused.\n\nIn the spring of the ninth year of the Dading era under Emperor Shizong of Jin, the master discovered two *gāthās* inscribed upon a neighbor’s wall in a place no one else could reach. The ink was still moist, and the final line read: *\"Wuguan, land where true immortals nurture nature— / One must become a deathless, long-lived man.\"*\n\nThat year, in the ninth month, the Patriarch arrived from the east with his disciples Danyang and Changzhen. The master and his mother both went to pay their respects. At first sight, the Patriarch asked him, *\"Do you understand the words upon the wall?\"* The master remained silent, and the four exchanged glances and smiled—the very wonder of *\"the Dao present in a glance.\"*\n\nThe Patriarch then bestowed upon him a poem:\n*\"After fishing, you return and see a turtle once more—\nAlready you know your place among the ranks of immortals.\nThe call of the mallet summons your intent—\nLeaping forth from waves ten thousand fathoms high.\"*\n\nThereafter, he conferred upon him a Daoist name.\n\nShortly after, the master followed the Patriarch to Liang, where he joined the three disciples Ma, Tan, and Qiu. One day, the Patriarch showed the four a poem containing the line: *\"I hasten to Penglai to first pay homage to my master.\"* He also said, *\"My parting words to the world I have left with Lü the Daoist in Luan Village, Chang’an.\"*\n\nTen years later, the Patriarch ascended in *feathered transformation*. The master and the three disciples carried his coffin back to Zhongnan for burial. They dwelled in a hut beside his grave for three years, each then departing as they wished.\n\nThe master and Changzhen then traveled east to Luoyang. Changzhen resided at Chaoyuan, while the master took up lodging in the Earth God’s Temple within the city market, where he remained silent for three years. Later, he moved to Yunxi Cave in the northeast of the city. Disciples gathered daily, and one day, he pointed to the ground and said, *\"Beneath here lie three wells.\"* They dug over two *zhang* deep and found a spring gushing from below. When asked how he knew, he replied, *\"This was my dwelling in a former life.\"*\n\nTwenty years later, the master pointed to the Feng family garden to the right of his hut and said, *\"This shall be my green burial ground.\"* Forty years later, the pines in the garden withered, and the watercourse reversed to flow westward. The land was then acquired without purchase. He had a stele carved and buried in the ground, inscribed: *\"When this green ground flourishes, this stele shall stand.\"*\n\nThe following year, he traveled east to Lai. When the Perfected Changchun journeyed west and passed through Yunxi, his disciples recounted the master’s parting words. Later, in the second year of the Da’an era under the Prince of Donghai, officials transporting grain discovered the plaque of *\"Changsheng Abbey.\"* By the third year of the Xingding era under Emperor Xuan, forty years had passed. The Feng family sold their garden, and Cai Qingchen acquired it for a hundred taels of silver. He invited the master’s disciple, Yufeng, to reside as abbot. Officials felled the pines and catalpas to build watchtowers and ramparts, then constructed a cloud bridge to channel the encircling waters, directing them to flow west of the abbey for the city’s defense. All the master’s words were thus fulfilled.\n\nAfter arriving in Lai, he built a hut and resided there. Twenty-two years later, he returned to Wuguan. There, the mystic wind flourished, and disciples from all directions gathered in ever greater numbers. The master then annotated the *Dao De Jing*, the *Huangting Jing*, and the *Qingjing Jing*.\n\nThat year, Danyang arrived from Guanzhong, and the master received him in full ceremonial attire. Danyang reproached him for extravagance, but the master countered, *\"I have heard that those who cultivate the Dao consume ten thousand taels of gold each day.\"* Danyang replied, *\"Consuming ten thousand taels of gold each day is precisely why one should wear coarse robes and eat plain fare.\"* In the end, he was recommended to officiate the *jiao* rites in Laizhou.\n\nOn the twenty-second day of the twelfth month in the twenty-third year, Danyang ascended in *feathered transformation*. The following year, in the first month, Jiang Shoujing invited the master to preside over the *jiao* rites in Changyang. Between the hours of *si* and *wu* on the eighteenth day, Hu Zhang, Xu Shaozu, and others suddenly saw auspicious cranes circling in the sky. The Patriarch appeared in a crimson robe and cloud crown, while Danyang, with his three topknots, manifested amidst the colored clouds.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the fourth month, during the *jiao* rites in Dengzhou, a mirage of a sea market appeared at Zhudao Island. After Danyang’s passing, the master and Yuyang jointly oversaw the burial. They guarded the tomb for a hundred days before sending the disciple Zhang Shunzhen to Luoyang with a letter, inviting Changzhen to assume leadership of the teaching.\n\nOne day, the master said to Shunzhen, *\"The affairs of the teaching do not rest with me. Danyang has attained the wandering immortals, while I have attained audience with the Primordial. Later, in a letter, he spoke of his impending departure and entrusted me with the leadership of the teaching.\"*\n\nThat year, in the fifth month, a drought struck Deng Prefecture. The prefect invited the master to pray for rain, and the sea market reappeared at Zhudao Island. The next day, Danyang manifested to the northwest of Yingxian Bridge, and on that day, the rains came in full.\n\nIn the twenty-ninth year, the master succeeded Changzhen as leader of the teaching. In the second year of the Mingchang era under Emperor Zhangzong, the Emperor’s son-in-law, the Commandery Prince, was stationed in Laizhou. Seeing many turn toward the Dao, yet finding nothing extraordinary in the master’s appearance, he grew suspicious. He ordered the military officer Le Wujie to arrest him and throw him into prison.\n\nMoments later, the townspeople saw the master in the southern part of the city, conversing with Daoist friends as usual. Zheng Yazhu, the jailer, also saw him and assumed he had escaped. When he checked the prison, the master was fast asleep. The two men were astonished and reported what they had seen. The prince immediately ordered his release.\n\nLater, Wen Dihan Mingwei of Weizhou came to visit and stayed for three days. The master told him, *\"You must return quickly—your hut is about to collapse.\"* Upon returning, he found his hut had indeed collapsed, and someone had died in the accident.\n\nIn the winter of the second year of the Cheng’an era, the master was summoned to the capital and lodged at Tianchang Abbey. When questioned on the profound mysteries of the Dao, his answers pleased the emperor. All who saw him, from officials to commoners, held him in reverence. The Ministry of Rites granted him five abbey plaques: *Lingxu*, *Taiwei*, *Longxiang*, *Jixian*, and *Miaozhen*.\n\nThe following year, in the third month, he received an imperial decree to return to the mountains and greatly expanded the grounds of Lingxu Abbey. Wu Liu, Xian Gaoming, and Yuan Zhe, fearing the master’s strictness, secretly plotted against him. The master sent Hao Mingqing to admonish them: *\"I have not yet attained the Dao, and my temper is hasty. Please seek other teachers and friends.\"* The two men looked at each other and said, *\"The master knows even the thoughts in our hearts.\"* They then apologized.\n\nMaster Liu the Barefoot fell ill and did not recover for a month. He came to beg for an early release from life. The master struck the ground with his staff and said, *\"In the past, you committed a year-long transgression against the Dao. In the worldly reckoning, merit may offset transgression, but in the hidden principles of the unseen, merit and transgression each receive their due reward.\"*\n\nThe past transgression of one year may be offset by a year’s merit. Now that we have met, a month’s merit shall suffice.\" Thereupon, Liu swore an oath, and his illness immediately healed.\n\nIn the second year of the Taihe era, the master presided over a jiao ritual in Binzhou. In mid-winter, after a light snow had cleared, the moat of the old city refroze, and upon its surface appeared jade blossoms and coral-like trees, numbering no fewer than a thousand. There were also some two thousand apricot blossoms, while the smaller branches, sprawling like olive boughs, were too numerous to count. All who witnessed this marveled, saying, *\"If even ordinary sincerity can move heaven and earth and stir the spirits, how much more fitting is it that a man of the Dao should evoke such wondrous responses?\"*\n\nLiu Zhaoyi, Vice Administrator of Dongjing and Military Commissioner of Dinghai, and Liu Shiru, having retired from office, befriended the master and found great affinity with him. In the third year, on the first month, the two gentlemen requested to formally acknowledge him as their teacher. The master declined, saying, *\"You are both renowned ministers of our age, and I am deeply honored by your regard. Yet I am soon to depart this world and am unworthy to be your companion.\"* He then presented them with a verse:\n\n*\"At the very peak of the steepest climb,\nwhy not brush one’s sleeves and turn away?\nI must now follow in those footsteps,\ngazing back toward the realm of stillness.\"*\n\nThe two men read it with sorrow.\n\nOn the twenty-eighth day of that month, the Prince of Zichuan invited the master to preside over a jiao ritual and inquired as to when he would attend. The master replied, *\"In eight days.\"* On the sixth day of the second month, the master ascended in transcendence—indeed, it was the eighth day.\n\nShiru mourned him with a poem:\n\n*\"In our later years, we grew close,\nforgetting rank as we sat face to face.\nEach day I waited, hoping you would come,\nonly to be stunned by your sudden departure, weeping with all who knew you.\nHearing the stream’s murmur, I recall your boundless eloquence;\nseeing the mountain’s hue, I think of your serene form.\nNow who remains as a recluse in these woods?\nLingxu stands desolate, locked in deep spring.\"*\n\nAt the time of his passing, he was fifty-six. In the first month of the sixth year of the Zhiyuan era of the Great Yuan, he was posthumously honored as *\"Perpetual Life, Cultivator of Transformation, Radiant Virtue Perfected.\"* His works, including *The Idle Immortal of Grand Emptiness*, *Banyang*, *Great Completion*, *Great Harmony*, *Divine Radiance*, and *Records of the Utmost Truth*, circulated widely.\n\n---\n\n**Qiu Chuji**\nThe master’s name was Chuji, styled Tongmi, and he was known as the Long Spring Master. A native of Dengzhou’s Bingxia, his family had long been prominent. In the sixth year of the Dading era of Emperor Shizong of Jin, at nineteen, he secluded himself on Kunqian Mountain. The following year, hearing that the Patriarch Chongyang resided at the Quanzhen Cloister in Ninghai, he immediately went to study under him. Chongyang presented him with a poem:\n\n*\"Fine as golden scales playing in azure streams,\nyou seek the fragrant bait and take the hook.\nGently I draw in the line,\npulling you into Penglai, forever free.\"*\n\nHis esteem for Chuji was evident.\n\nIn the spring of the eighth year, he followed the Patriarch to reside amidst mist and clouds, spending autumn and winter in Wendeng. The ninth year, he accompanied the Patriarch—along with Danyang, Changzhen, and Changsheng—on travels to Liang. The Patriarch instructed them day and night, showing particular earnestness toward Chuji compared to the others. Soon after, the Patriarch ascended in transcendence, and the four disciples escorted his coffin to be buried in Zhongnan. They guarded his tomb for three years before each departing for their own paths.\n\nThe master dwelled by Fan Brook for six years and at Dragon Gate for seven. The truths of nurturing the authentic, which he had received from his teacher, he sometimes expressed in songs and poems, and thus his reputation grew. At the invitation of Jiagu, the Military Commissioner of Jingzhao, he returned to Zhongnan to propagate the Patriarch’s teachings.\n\nIn the twenty-eighth year, Emperor Shizong summoned him for an audience and inquired about the supreme Dao. The master first expounded the essentials of prolonging life and preserving destiny, then spoke of the difficulties in maintaining prosperity and safeguarding achievements. He added, *\"Arrogance and excess in wealth and status are common human tendencies. One must remain vigilant to guard against them. If this can be practiced consistently over time, one is not far from the Dao of immortality. Deceitful illusions and strange phenomena are not what I have heard of.\"* The emperor praised and accepted his words, lodging him in the west of Wanning Palace for ease of consultation.\n\nIn the fifth month, he was summoned to Changsong Island. In the seventh month, he was received again, and the master elucidated the profound principles. He presented *\"The First Bend of Jade Terrace\"* and composed five poems by imperial command. The next day, the emperor bestowed peaches from Shanglin, which the master had not eaten in over a decade. On this occasion, he partook of them, considering it a gift from above.\n\nIn the eighth month, he was granted permission to return to Zhongnan and offered a hundred thousand coins, which he declined. The twenty-ninth year saw the passing of Emperor Shizong. The master encountered the funeral procession and composed a poem in mourning.\n\nIn the first year of the Mingchang era of Emperor Zhangzong, he returned to Bingxia and greatly expanded the abbey, which was bestowed the plaque *\"Grand Emptiness.\"* In the tenth month of the third year, during the Zhiyang jiao ritual, several riders suddenly approached from the west. The crowd was startled, thinking they were imperial messengers.\n\nIn an instant, the dust and riders vanished without a trace. For three nights, the wine cups before the altar remained full, and only then did he realize that the riders in the dust had been divine beings.\n\nIn the ninth month of the fifth year, he presided over a ritual at Fushan. As he invoked the deities, a thunderous rumble shook the Celestial Gate. A crimson glow descended from the North Star, illuminating the earth so brightly that even the minutest details were discernible.\n\nIn the seventh year of the Taihe era, the imperial consort bestowed a complete Daoist canon, which was conveyed by courier to Bingxia, where the Marquis of Donghai Commandery received it. During the Daan era’s first year, he composed the *Record of Learning Immortality*. In the second year, he wrote the *Record of the Opening of Heaven*.\n\nIn the fourth year of Emperor Xuanzong’s Zhenyou era, the master resided in Dengzhou. The emperor dispatched Wang Tingyu, the military inspector of Dongping, to deliver an imperial edict summoning him to the capital. The master said, “I follow the principle of Heaven in all my actions; if Heaven commands me to go, I dare not refuse.”\n\nIn the year *jimao* (the third year of Emperor Xinzong’s Xingding era, corresponding to the twelfth year of the Jiading era of the Southern Song), he dwelt at the Haotian Abbey in Laizhou, at a time when the Qi and Lu regions had fallen to the Song. In the eighth month of autumn, the Song sent an envoy to summon him, ordering General Peng Yifu to escort him with an honor guard, but he did not rise. The prefect of the commandery found this extraordinary. The master said, “My comings and goings are not for those like you to comprehend; one day, I fear I shall not be able to remain here.”\n\nIn the fifth month of that year, the Sagely Martial Emperor Taizu of the Great Yuan, having completed his great enterprise in the Naiman lands and unified the six directions, dispatched his minister Liu Zhonglu to invite the master. The imperial decree read in part: “Within seven years, great deeds have been accomplished; the six directions are now one. Thus, the southern lands border the Man and Song, the north adjoins the Huihe, and the eastern Xia and western Rong all submit as vassals. Entrusted with the weighty duty of governance, I fear lapses in administration.”\n\nMoreover, just as one carves a boat and shapes oars to cross rivers and streams, so too does one summon the worthy and select assistants to bring peace to the realm. Since ascending the throne, I have devoted myself to governance, yet among the ranks of the Three and Nine, I have found no such man. I have heard that you, Master, embody truth and follow the rules, possess vast knowledge and deep learning, trace the subtle to its source and exhaust principle to its end—your Dao is profound, your virtue resplendent. You carry the legacy of the ancient noble man and hold the refined conduct of a perfected transcendent. Now, learning that you still dwell in seclusion within the old borders of Shandong, my heart yearns for you without cease. Though mountains and rivers divide us, preventing me from personally welcoming you, I have withdrawn to the side of my throne, purified myself with fasting and ablutions, and dispatched a trusted minister with a light, unadorned carriage. Across thousands of miles, I humbly beseech you to grace us with your immortal steps, setting aside the hardships of the distant desert journey. Whether to discuss the affairs of the people in this age or to instruct me in the arts of preserving life, if I may but draw near your immortal seat—even a single word from your lips after a cough would suffice.\n\nIn the eighth month, Zhonglu arrived in Yan. Hearing the Master was in Laizhou, he was joined by Wu Yan and Jiang Yuan of the Yidu Pacification Office, who offered twenty riders for the journey. Upon reaching Yidu, its commander, Zhang Lin, provided four-horse chariots. Passing through Weizhou, they were met by the prefect of Qinghe. By the twelfth month, they arrived in Donglai, where the imperial summons was delivered. The Master, with a sigh, consented to the journey.\n\nOn the *gengchen* day of the first month, he selected eighteen disciples fit to accompany him. In the second month, they entered Yan, where the provincial minister Shimo provided lodging at the Jade Void Abbey. Zhonglu first sent a messenger ahead with a report, and the Master also submitted a memorial in response. In the fourth month, a grand ritual was held at the Supreme Ultimate Palace, where the Master ascended the Precious Mystery Hall to transmit the precepts. A crane came from the northwest, and as the talismanic slips were burned, one slip soared into the air, with five cranes circling and dancing above it.\n\nThe next day, the Master set out northward. Passing through Juyong, he encountered a band of robbers, who all bowed their heads in retreat, saying, “Do not alarm the Master.” In the fifth month, he arrived at the Dragon Sun Abbey in Dexing. On the Mid-Autumn Day, he conducted a ritual and, in the afternoon, transmitted the precepts. Though the assembly sat exposed in the open, the heat was intense, but soon clouds gathered above them like a round canopy, lingering for some time before dispersing. The abbey’s well, which barely sufficed for a hundred people, now yielded water without end.\n\nIn the eighth month, the Grand Tutor Yila invited him to reside at the Celestial Origin Abbey in Xuande. The Grand Tutor had built a Sagely Hall and an Ancestral Hall, wishing to adorn their walls with paintings. Though it was the tenth month, the painters declined due to the cold. The Master would not permit it, saying, “If even Zou Lu could turn back spring, would the dead sages and worthies not lend their aid?” When the work was completed, there was indeed no hindrance from the cold.\n\nThat month, Helabuhui returned with the Master’s memorial. An edict was issued, reading: “To the Perfected Realized One, Master Qiu: Having reviewed your memorial, I see that of those who answered the summons, only your Dao surpasses the Three Masters, and your virtue is weighty in all directions. I commanded my minister to hasten with the imperial carriage, seeking you across the seas, and now the time accords with your wishes—heaven does not oppose man. Though two courts repeatedly summoned you, you did not come; yet at a single invitation from a lone envoy, you rose at once. This is called ‘heaven’s mandate,’ and thus you have returned in person, enduring exposure to wind and frost, willingly traversing the sands and marshes.”\n\nThe memorial was presented, and how could words express Our joy and comfort? Military and state affairs are not what We had hoped for; rather, it is your heart for the Dao and virtue that truly deserves esteem. Though the rivers and roads stretch wide, the sight of your staff and seat is not far. In response to your memorial, let Our intent be made clear. The autumn heat lingers—may the Master remain well. This letter is brief and does not say all.\n\nAgain, to the Perfected One: See that Zhonglu does not let the Realized One suffer hunger or fatigue; he may support you and proceed at a measured pace. Such was the reverence shown.\n\nOn the second day of the second month in the year *xinsi*, Daoist companions saw him off at the western outskirts. Some grasped the bridle of his horse and wept, saying: “The Master departs ten thousand *li* away—when shall we again enjoy the old rituals of fellowship?” The Master replied: “In three years, I shall return.”\n\nOn the first day of the fifth month, he reached the Luju River, where a solar eclipse occurred. By the seventh month, he arrived at Mount Abuqan. Zhenhai came to pay respects, reporting that ahead lay towering mountains, vast marshes, and treacherous bogs, impassable by carriage. He left behind nine disciples, including Song Dao’an, to establish the Bingxia Abbey. With Zhao Xujing and others, he proceeded on horseback.\n\nOn the Mid-Autumn Day, he reached the White Bone Flats of Mount Jin. All said that the skies there were dark and gloomy, where *chimei* and *wangliang* spirits wrought mischief, and travelers had to smear blood on their horses’ heads to ward them off. The Master laughed and said: “Why should a man of the Dao fear such things?” They passed through without incident.\n\nUpon reaching the Yin Mountains, hundreds of officials, commoners, Daoist priests, and Buddhist monks came to meet him. The Master inquired about their local customs, to which they replied: “In the third year of the Jinglong era, Yang He served as Grand Protector, governing with such virtue that his benevolence endured to this day, and we still benefit from it.”\n\nIn the eleventh month, he arrived north of the great city of Yemisi. The Grand Preceptor Yila Guogong, along with Mongol masters, came bearing wine to welcome him. They pitched grand tents, and he halted his carriage there. The Grand Preceptor, citing the prevalence of Uyghur bandits and frequent thieves, feared unforeseen turmoil might arise. The Master said: “A man of the Dao drifts freely through the years, untroubled—even a blade at his throat holds no terror, so why fret over thieves before they appear? Moreover, the paths of good and evil never intersect to harm one another.” The crowd was thus put at ease.\n\nThat winter, he resided in the newly built palace of Dengduan. On the tenth day of the third month of the *renwu* year, Alixian arrived from the imperial encampment and conveyed to Zhonglu and Zhenhai: “Only you two have escorted the Perfected One here. Now order Wanhu Bolu to provide a thousand armored soldiers for his protection.” Passing through the Iron Gate, they reached the encampment, where he was settled in a guest residence before being summoned for an audience.\n\nThe Emperor commended him, saying: “You declined invitations from all other states, yet now you have come from beyond ten thousand *li*—this deeply pleases me.”\n\nThe Master replied: “That this mountain-dweller rose at the imperial summons was Heaven’s doing.” The Emperor, valuing his sincerity, had two tents pitched east of the imperial ministers’ quarters to house him.\n\nThe appointed day, the fourteenth of the fourth month, drew near when reports of mountain bandits arrived. The Emperor wished to lead the expedition himself but, after divining a more auspicious date, rescheduled for the full moon of the tenth month. The Master requested to return to his former lodging. The Emperor said: “Would it not weary you to come again?” The Master replied: “Twenty days will suffice.” The Emperor then asked: “But who will escort you?” Three days later, he ordered the emissary Yang Agou to lead over a thousand horsemen, including Uyghur chieftains, by an alternate route.\n\nIn the fifth month, they reached Yemisiqan, where officials welcomed the Master into the guest residence—it was the fifth day of the fifth month. Once settled, he found his lodging perched on a northern cliff, overlooking a clear stream plunging over ten *zhang*. The brook flowed from snow-capped mountains, its waters icy even in midsummer. When the heat grew oppressive, he would sit by the pavilion’s open windows, and at night, he slept atop the terrace of his chamber. In the scorching sixth month, he bathed in the stream. Such was his contentment in that distant land.\n\nFew visitors came to his residence. To pass the time, he amused himself with scriptures and composed a poem:\n*North beyond the Yin Mountains, ten thousand* li *and more,*\n*West past the lands of Dashi, half a year’s sojourn.*\n*In these far wastes, where customs are coarse, the Dao is hard to expound—*\n*So in this quiet, secluded chamber, I turn to my books.*\n\nIn the seventh month, he dispatched Alixian to present a memorial at the imperial encampment, seeking an audience to discourse on the Dao. On the seventh day of the eighth month, the Emperor’s rescript arrived. The next day, he set out, accompanied by the Grand Preceptor for several dozen *li*. On the twenty-second, Tian Zhenhai came to greet him. Upon reaching the encampment, the Emperor sent Zhenhai to ask: “Would you prefer to see me now or rest first?” The Master replied: “I long to enter your presence.” After the audience, he was offered fermented mare’s milk before taking his leave. The Emperor said: “Might you dine here daily?” The Master answered: “This mountain-dweller, devoted to cultivation, cherishes solitude.” The Emperor permitted him to do as he pleased.\n\nOn the twenty-seventh, the imperial cortege returned north. Along the way, the Emperor repeatedly bestowed gifts of grape wine, melons, and tea. In the ninth month, they crossed the pontoon bridge to the north. The Master, noting that the appointed time for discourse was near, petitioned the Emperor, who summoned the Grand Master Ahai.\n\nOn the night of the full moon, the Emperor had torches lit in the courtyard and drew his seat forward to receive him. The Grand Master Ahai and Alixian attended as the Emperor inquired about the supreme Dao. The Master said:\n\n“The Dao gives birth to Heaven and nurtures Earth. From it arise the sun, moon, stars, spirits, and all beings. Men know only that Heaven is vast, yet they do not know the Dao is vaster still. That which is light and pure becomes Heaven—Heaven is yang, belonging to fire. That which is heavy and turbid becomes Earth—Earth is yin, belonging to water. Man dwells between them, bearing yin while embracing yang. Thus, those who cultivate the Dao refine their practice by curbing excess, restraining desire, consolidating essence, and guarding the spirit, focusing solely on nurturing yang. When yin dissipates and yang is complete, one ascends to Heaven as an immortal, like fire rising. The ignorant, however, treat wine as their drink and delusion as their norm, indulging their passions, depleting essence, and harming the spirit. Thus, yang wanes and yin waxes, and they sink into the earth as ghosts, like water flowing downward.\n\nCultivating the true is like rolling a stone up a mountain: the higher it goes, the harder the ascent. A single misstep, and all prior effort is lost. Because it is so difficult, the world does none of it. The Daoist cultivates the true and refines the heart, thinking of nothing, like the empty void or still water. When the wind subsides, water is calm and clear, reflecting all things vividly. When the wind rises, water churns and muddies—how can it mirror anything? Man’s original true nature is as still as unmoving water. Yet the eye delights in color, the ear in sound, the tongue in flavor, and the mind clings to affairs. These senses arise in succession, like gusts whipping up waves. Taming the heart at first is exceedingly hard. With years of practice and deepening skill, one reduces and reduces again until reaching non-action.\n\nThe Daoist’s body is but one—yet even taming the heart is as difficult as it is for an ant. The Son of Heaven rules all within the Four Seas, reviewing myriad affairs daily—how much harder is it for him to tame his heart? If he can but moderate sensual desires and restrain his thoughts, he will gain Heaven’s protection. How much more blessed would he be if he could fully uphold the precepts? The ancients married to secure an heir, then abstained from desire once the heir was established. Thus, Confucius at forty was free from doubt, and Mencius at forty was unmoved. For men past forty, vitality gradually wanes. Your Majesty is now advanced in years—you should cultivate virtue and preserve your health to attain long life.”\n\nHe then explained the principle of taking medicine and sleeping alone: “Medicine is herb, essence is marrow. To replace marrow with herb is like a bag filled with gold—if you exchange gold for iron, over time the gold is spent, and only iron remains. What benefit is that? How is taking medicine any different? In food, lodging, treasures, and wealth, one should adhere to one’s station and not exceed it.\n\nBeyond the Four Seas lie countless lands and peoples, yielding many rare treasures. Yet none compare to the Central Plains, where Heaven has bestowed teachings on governing the state and cultivating the self, and where extraordinary individuals have attained the Dao and ascended to Heaven. The lands east of the mountains and north of the Yellow River are the finest under Heaven, producing fine incense, vegetables, fish, salt, silk, and hemp to supply the realm. Since ancient times, whoever held these lands held greatness—thus, dynasties have always prized them. Now they are entirely yours, yet war and fire have ravaged them, scattering the people. You should select capable officials to plan their restoration, reduce taxes appropriately, and ensure the state and army have enough cloth while the common folk recover and rest. This would achieve two goals at once and is also a means of seeking blessings.\n\nIf you appoint the unworthy, it will not only be of no benefit but will bring harm. When the Jin first gained the realm, they arose from the eastern lands, and the people of the Central Plains were not yet familiar with their ways. They enfeoffed Liu Yu in Dongping, allowing him to govern for eight years before reclaiming it—this, too, was a sound strategy for establishing a new dynasty.”\n\nThe rustic scholar briefly outlined the essentials—whether to employ or discard them rests solely with Your Majesty’s decisive will. The emperor was pleased and ordered his attendants to record it in the imperial annals. This is but a rough account; the full details may be found in the *Record of Celebrations and Gatherings*.\n\nThe following day, the emperor inquired about the matter of thunder. The scholar replied: “This humble one has heard that in the customs of Your Majesty’s land, in summer one does not bathe in rivers, does not dry clothes in the sun, does not make felt, and if mushrooms appear in the wild, their gathering is forbidden—all out of awe for the majesty of Heaven. Yet this is not the ultimate Dao of serving Heaven. I have heard that among the three thousand offenses, none is greater than unfilial conduct. Now, I observe that in the customs of Your Majesty’s land, the people have yet to understand the Way of filial piety toward their parents. Your Majesty should instruct and admonish them.”\n\nThe emperor summoned the crown prince, the princes, and the great ministers, relaying to them the master’s earlier and later words, and added: “The immortals have been sent by Heaven to speak these things to me. Let each of you engrave them in your hearts.” From this, the name “immortal” began.\n\nThe *Record of the Western Journey* states: On the first day of the tenth month, he memorialized to request returning to his former residence. On the seventh day of the second month of the *guiwei* year, he entered to take his leave. The emperor said: “Wait but three or five days. There are parts of the Daoist’s words from the other day that I have yet to fully grasp; once I do, you may go.”\n\nThe emperor went hunting on Eastern Mountain and shot a great boar, but his horse stumbled, losing control. The boar stood by, not daring to advance. The attendants brought forward another horse, and the hunt was thus abandoned.\n\nThe Master, upon hearing this, entered to admonish the emperor, saying: “The Dao of Heaven cherishes life. Now that Your Majesty’s years are advanced, you ought to reduce your hunting excursions. Falling from your horse was Heaven’s warning; the boar not daring to advance was Heaven’s protection.” The emperor replied: “I have deeply reflected. Though my skill in riding and archery is limited and I cannot cease at once, the words of the immortal remain in my heart.” From then on, he curtailed his outings.\n\nOn the seventh day of the third month, the Master again took leave, and the emperor granted his request. The gifts bestowed were exceedingly generous, but he declined them all. The emperor issued a decree of esteem and comfort to honor his return. He then commanded Alixian to escort the Master eastward, and those who saw him off wept in parting.\n\nUpon reaching Mount Abuhan, they passed the Bingxia Abbey. By the fifth month, the Master took no food, drinking only broth. The assembly asked him: “Master, what ails you?” He replied: “My affliction is not something your kind can fathom—it is the refining of the sage.”\n\nThat evening, Yin Qinghe dreamed a man who said to him: “Do not worry for the Master’s illness; he will recover of himself upon reaching Han territory.” On the last day of the sixth month, they arrived at Fengzhou, where the commissioner Yu invited him to stay at his home, offering broth and medicine. The Master then ate his fill, and afterward returned to his usual state. The assembly said to one another: “Qinghe’s dream has proven true.”\n\nWhen they reached Yunzhong, Alixian wished to summon and instruct the people of Shandong and requested to go with Qinghe. The Master said: “Heaven’s intent is unclear; even if you go, what benefit will it bring?” Alixian bowed twice and said: “If the king were to dispatch a great army, the people would surely suffer slaughter.” The Master replied: “Though you may not save them, it is still better than sitting idle.” He granted the request.\n\nIn the eighth month, they reached Xuande, where the Master took residence at the Chaoyuan Abbey in the prefecture. The officials, generals, and commanders of the Hebei prefectures and subprefectures sent letters and memorials in such numbers that they converged like spokes to a hub. The Master replied: “While the royal house remains unsettled, the Daoist gate must first flourish. The opportunities for salvation are boundless, and its expansion knows no limit.” The regional commander was the first to devote himself wholeheartedly to reverence, lamenting only that he could not manifest in multiple forms to fulfill the people’s hopes.\n\nOn the first day of the second month in the jiashen year, the Master resided at the Qiuyang Abbey on Mount Jin. Shimo of the Xing Province of Yanjing and Liu Zhonglun, the commissioner for convenience, each presented memorials earnestly requesting his presence at the Taiji Palace. He granted their request and crossed the Juyong Pass. Earlier, when the Master had departed Wuchuan, his followers asked when he would return. He replied, “In three years.” Now, his words proved true.\n\nThat month, Helala arrived from the imperial residence and conveyed the decree: “Since the Divine Immortal has reached the Han lands, he may reside in any of Our cities as he wishes.” The assembled officials all said, “The Master has already agreed to the Taiji Palace; let there be no further discussion.” Thereafter, Daoist hymns and chants gathered in abundance, and the Mysterious Teachings flourished daily. He established eight assemblies: the Assembly of Equality, the Assembly of Eternal Spring, the Assembly of Numinous Treasure, the Assembly of Longevity, the Assembly of Illuminating Truth, the Assembly of Peace, the Assembly of Disaster Dispelling, and the Assembly of Myriad Lotuses. Those seeking Dharma names increased day by day, and he often taught them through songs and praises.\n\nAt times, he would return to wander his old garden atop Qionghua Peak, accompanied by five or six followers, and sit in leisure beneath the pines. Sometimes he composed poems himself; at others, they exchanged verses in response. As the evening sun lingered on the mountains, they remained serene, forgetting to return.\n\nIn the spring of the yiyou year, the Master broke off a branch of pear blossoms and bestowed it upon the lay disciple Zhang Quhua, a man of profound mystery. Zhang treasured the gift and placed it in a vase to nurture it. By autumn, it bore twenty-four fruits, no different from those grown on the tree itself. The people of the time regarded this as an auspicious sign. Quhua was the father of Chengming. The Master’s subtle intent was profound indeed.\n\nAt the Yanxiang Abbey stood a withered locust tree. The Master struck it with his staff and declared, “This locust tree shall live.” Today, it flourishes luxuriantly, surpassing all other locust trees.\n\nIn the ninth month, the pacification commissioner Wang Ji, observing that Mars had trespassed into the Tail constellation—a harbinger of disaster for the Yan region—prepared to perform a jiao ritual to avert it. He asked about the expenses, and the Master replied, “Even if a single creature is displaced, I still feel compassion. How much more for the borderlands?” In recent years, the people had suffered under heavy corvée labor, and both public and private resources were exhausted. “I shall provide from the abbey’s common holdings,” he said. “Simply have the officials purify themselves and await the ritual.” On the evening the jiao concluded, the pacification commissioner rejoiced and congratulated him, saying, “Mars has already retreated several lodges; we need no longer worry.” The Master’s virtue had moved so swiftly! The Master replied, “What virtue do I possess? Prayer and supplication have existed since ancient times; the only concern is whether one’s sincerity is lacking.”\n\nIn the fifth month of the bingxu year, the capital suffered a great drought. The provincial administration requested the Master to preside over a jiao ritual. The rains then came in abundance. The occasion was called “the Divine Immortal’s Rain,” and eminent scholars and great literati all composed poems in celebration.\n\nIn the fifth month of the dinghai year, another drought struck. The Daoist assembly in the capital requested another jiao ritual. The Master calmly addressed them: “Just as I was considering the jiao, you have all proposed the same. This is what is meant by ‘like minds think alike without prior agreement.’” He continued, “The first day shall be for the jiao to pray for rain; the second day, for the jiao to celebrate the rain. If rain falls within three days, it is an auspicious response to the jiao. Beyond three days, it is not the jiao’s rain.” Someone asked, “Heaven’s intent is not easily fathomed. If you make such a statement before the assembly, what if the timing is missed? Will you not invite criticism?” The Master replied, “This is not for you to understand.” Later, all unfolded as the Master had foretold.\n\nThat month, the disciple Wang Zhiming arrived from Qinzhou, bearing an imperial edict that renamed the Taiyi Palace as Changchun, and Qionghua Island as Wan’an Palace, and bestowed upon him a tiger tally. All Daoist affairs were entrusted entirely to the Divine Immortal for disposition.\n\nIn the sixth month, the Master did not venture out. The following day, thunder and rain erupted violently. Someone reported: “The southern bank of Taiye Lake has ruptured, and water has surged into the Eastern Lake. The sound carried for tens of *li*. Lightning struck, and turtles and fish fled entirely; the pool then dried up. The northern mountain’s mouth also collapsed.”\n\nThe Master initially said nothing. After a long while, he smiled and said: “The mountain has crumbled, the pool has run dry—shall I go with them?”\n\nOn the fourth day of the seventh month, the Master addressed his disciples: “Long ago, [Master] Danyang once gave me a prophecy, saying: ‘After my passing, the teachings will flourish greatly. The four directions will often transform into Daoist villages, and the abbeys will all be granted names by imperial favor. You will also preside over grand palaces and monasteries, and there will be envoys bearing tallies traveling by post to oversee the affairs of the teaching. This will be the time when merit is accomplished, fame is achieved, and one retires in peace.’ Danyang’s words have all come to pass. I depart without regret.”\n\nOn the ninth day, he ascended Baoxuan Hall and left behind a verse:\n*Life and death, morning and dusk—all the same,*\n*Bubbles rise and vanish in the ever-leisurely water.*\n*Where faint light appears, the crow and hare leap;*\n*When the profound measure is at ease, it embraces seas and mountains.*\n*I cast off the eight directions as if they were a hand’s span;*\n*I exhale the ten thousand things as if they were a mechanism.*\n*Wild words fall like dust and grime from my brush—*\n*I entrust them to the deluded ears of men.*\n\nHe wrote this, then passed away, at the age of eighty.\n\nThe minister Liu Zhonglu, wiping away tears, sighed: “Since the Perfected One’s audience with the throne, ruler and subject have been in harmony with the Dao. After his departure from the capital, the emperor’s thoughts have lingered, never once forgetting him. Now that the Master has ascended, I must swiftly memorialize this.”\n\nFrom then on, mourners from all directions arrived, each grieving as if they had lost their own kin.\n\nOn the first day of the third month in the wǔzǐ year, Qinghe proposed constructing a hall for the Master at White Cloud Abbey, with the grand burial set for the ninth day of the seventh month. In the sixth month, continuous rains raised concerns of obstruction. Yet by the start of the seventh month, the skies cleared entirely. When the coffin was opened, his complexion appeared as if alive, and the onlookers formed a dense crowd. For three days, his immortal remains were enshrined in the hall, filling the air with an extraordinary fragrance that lingered for some time. Once his spirit was pacified, a heavy rain fell.\n\nCommissioner Wang Ji presided over the funeral, serving as the chief mourner, and personally inscribed the hall’s plaque with the words *Chùshùn* (\"Abiding in Compliance\"). In the first month of the jǐsì year of the Zhiyuan era, the Master was posthumously honored with the title *Chángchūn Yǎndào Zhǔjiào Zhēnrén* (\"Perfected One of the Long Spring, Who Expounds the Dao and Leads the Teaching\").\n\nHis poetic works, *The Fánxī Wūdào Collection*, circulated in the world.\n\n---\n**Volume Two of the *Continued Compendium of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao* concludes here.**\n\n**Volume Three of the *Continued Compendium of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao***\n\n**Wang Chuyi**\n\nThe Master’s name was Chuyi, a native of Dongmou in Ninghai. His sobriquet was Yuyang. In the second year of the Huangtong era of Emperor Xizong of Jin, on the eighteenth day of the third month, his mother, Lady Zhou, dreamed of red clouds swirling around her body. Startled awake, she gave birth that very day.\n\nAt the age of seven, he once collapsed to the ground, his breath suspended, and only revived after some time. His mother, alarmed, asked, “What happened to you?” He replied, “I only knew I was in a deep sleep and nothing more.” From this, the Master awakened to the principle of life and death.\n\nOne day, while wandering in the mountains, he encountered an old man seated upon a great stone, who said to him, “One day, you will rise to fame at the imperial court and become the patriarch of the Daoist teaching.” The old man then stroked his head and bade him depart.\n\nAnother time, he heard a voice from the void ask, “Do you recognize me?” He answered, “I do not.” The voice said, “I am the Lord of the Mysterious Court Palace.” Thereafter, he would sing wildly and dance madly, barefoot in winter’s cold, clad in a single garment, yet his countenance remained unchanged. Suddenly, he composed a verse and sang it aloud:\n\n*Why vie for fame? Why chase profit?*\n*Better to hear early and cultivate the heart-ground.*\n*One’s own cultivation is one’s own path;*\n*If one does not act for oneself, one is no better than the herd.*\n\nIn his youth, when someone broached the subject of marriage, he merely smiled and did not respond.\n\nIn the eighth year of the Dading era of Emperor Shizong, while the Master resided at Ox Immortal Hermitage in Wendeng, he was informed that the Patriarch had arrived. He immediately went to the Quanzhen Hermitage and requested to become his disciple. The Patriarch, recognizing him as a vessel of great capacity for the Mysterious Gate, granted his request.\n\nOn the last day of the second month, he followed the Patriarch to the Misty Cloud Grotto of Kunyu, where he received the orthodox Dharma and his present name. His mother paid homage to the Patriarch and also expressed her wish to study the Dao. The Master, knowing her purity, bestowed upon her the name Deqing and the title *Xuánjìng Sǎnrén* (\"Mysteriously Serene Laywoman\").\n\nIn the fourth month of the ninth year, while the Master was at Iron Tooth Mountain, the Patriarch, along with Danyang and several others, traveled from Wendeng toward Ninghai, passing through Dragon Spring. The day was scorching, and the Patriarch walked holding an umbrella, with Danyang and the others following. Suddenly, the umbrella soared into the sky and, from dawn until dusk, descended before the Master’s hermitage. Dragon Spring lay nearly two hundred *li* from Iron Tooth Mountain, and within the umbrella’s handle was found his present sobriquet. He was also called *Sǎn Yángzǐ* (\"Umbrella Sun Master\"), a name bestowed by the Patriarch.\n\nAmong the seven disciples, the Master ranked after Matan and Liu Qiu. Thus, the Patriarch once said, “The umbrella and bamboo unite as seven individuals,” corresponding to the sevenfold number of the golden lotus. He also remarked, “The bamboo of the golden elixir emerges from the crown, its fivefold radiance piercing the canopy of colored clouds.”\n\nIn the ninth month, as the Patriarch journeyed west, the Master secluded himself in Cloud Radiance Grotto. Often, he would stand precariously on the edge of a cliff, balancing on one foot for days without moving, earning the sobriquet *Iron-Footed Immortal*. After nine years of refinement, his heart-ground became luminous, and thereafter he frequently traveled between Qi and Lu.\n\nIn the autumn of the twenty-second year, while residing in Ninghai, the Perfected One Danyang arrived from Guanzhong. They lodged together at Golden Lotus Hall, where Danyang spoke to the Master in measured tones: “The Patriarch Chongyang traversed thousands of *li* to guide us, yet we have done little in return—does this not weigh upon our hearts? Moreover, if a realized adept benefits only himself and his merit does not extend to others, I fear this falls short of the great salvific aim. If we truly wish to illuminate the Patriarch’s virtue, nothing would be better than manifesting the Mysterious Response to bless living beings. You now hold the Dao and conceal your vessel, practicing self-cultivation alone—is this not improper?”\n\nThe Master replied, “Ah, the Dao is neither the same nor different; the difference lies in whether it is practiced or not. You, Master, embody the Dao within yourself and radiate virtue across the four seas, so that all under heaven revere and submit to you at a glance. There is no other reason—it is because the Dao flourishes and its practice is manifest. As for me, my practice is not yet manifest; for now, I merely act wildly to blend with the world.”\n\nDanyang found his words reasonable.\n\nIn the twenty-seventh year, Emperor Shizong summoned the Master to court. In all his responses, he greatly aligned with the imperial will. He was lodged at Tianchang Abbey for an extended period. When the Emperor heard that someone had attempted to harm the Master with poisoned wine, he dispatched envoys to inquire about the wine’s origin. Though pressed repeatedly, the Master never revealed its source, merely claiming illness. The Emperor, upon hearing this, expressed even deeper admiration and praise. The Master requested to return to the mountains to attend to his parents, and the Emperor granted his wish.\n\nIn the twenty-eighth year, on the second month, the Master was again summoned to court. The Emperor ordered the construction of Xiuzhen Abbey, bestowing upon it a plaque inscribed in gold seal script, and instructed the Master to reside there. In the second month, he presided over the ritual for the Wanchun Festival. In the eighth month, he received permission to return home, along with a lavish gift of gold and silk, which he declined. In the twelfth month, the Emperor fell ill and sent envoys to summon the Master. The Master said to the envoys, “Why have you come so late? I fear I may not behold the imperial visage again.” The following spring, he encountered the mourning edict in Zhuo Prefecture and firmly declined further summons, returning eastward.\n\nIn the second year of Emperor Zhangzong’s Cheng’an reign, in the seventh month, the Master was summoned to the informal palace hall. The Emperor inquired about the Dao of nurturing life. The Master replied that it lay in non-action, purity, tranquility, minimizing selfishness, and curbing desires. When asked about the principles of nature and destiny, the Master said, “The teachings of internal alchemy—using the mind to circulate qi—are all rooted in non-action and spontaneity, mastering the transformations of creation. The profound and primordial Dao achieves without striving.” The Emperor said, “This is beyond what I can discuss.”\n\nHe then asked about governance and border affairs, and the Master’s responses all accorded with the imperial intent. The Emperor said, “Whenever I ask you something, you always know the answer. Why is this?” The Master replied, “It is merely by chance.” The Emperor said, “Do not decline my praise. I wish to hear your explanation.” The Master said, “Even a bright mirror can reflect all things—how much more so the mirror of heaven and earth, which illuminates all without exception? What can escape it? This mirror of heaven and earth is the wondrous clarity of one’s own spirit.” The Emperor sighed and said, “With purity and brightness embodied, one’s qi and will become spirit-like. When desires arise, their signs appear first. This describes you, Master.”\n\nThe following spring, the Master memorialized that his mother’s age neared ninety and requested to return to attend to her. The Emperor bestowed upon him an abbey plaque and the title *Tixuan Grand Master*, along with generous gifts. In the third year, the *guihai* year, the Emperor commanded the two abbots of Taiqing Palace in Bo Prefecture to preside over the *Putian* ritual, during which over a thousand individuals received the precepts and became Daoists. On the day the Master descended to attend, his disciples all gathered. The Master’s mother said, “I am now advanced in years—how can I return?”\n\nThe Master said his mother’s lifespan might end in the seventh month of that autumn. She then spoke of neither clinging to life nor fearing death. When the time came, she fell ill, and the Master hastened to arrange her funeral. After twenty-five days, she passed away. On the day of her death, all present smelled an extraordinary fragrance, rich and lingering, while the sound of zither strings, pure and elegant, filled the air for some time before fading.\n\nThe former Vice Censor-in-Chief of Beiping, Bömolu, had long revered the Master’s teachings, honoring the Dao and holding it in the highest regard. Whenever he met the Master, whether foretelling the day rain would fall or revealing the place of their next meeting, every prediction came to pass. One day, he visited Shengshui to express his devotion, saying: “Of the divine immortals, I had only heard their names. But since meeting you, Master, every prayer I offer receives a gracious response. In my comings and goings, you foresee all, yet I, bound by worldly dust, cannot follow your cloud-wandering path. My circumstances thwart my wishes, leaving only regret.”\n\nIn the seventh year, the Yuan Consort donated a complete set of Daoist scriptures, which were conveyed by courier to Yuxu Abbey in Shengshui. Before the abbey’s water cave stood a massive rock, jutting out several *zhang* and looming over those who passed beneath, filling them with dread. One day, the Master gathered the assembly and declared, “This rock should be removed.” Hammers and chisels were raised, and for days they labored. The Master asked, “How much progress has been made?” They replied, “Only one percent.” The Master laughed and said, “How can you remove it?” He then went to the rock’s side, wielded a hammer, and struck it three times. The sound was like thunder, shaking the cliffs and valleys, and the rock fell. All who witnessed it were struck with awe.\n\nIn the fourth year of the *Zhenyou* era, Wen Deng’s magistrate, Wendi Han Gui-shou, invited the Master to return to Tianbao Abbey in the county. The following year, on the twenty-third day of the fourth month, the Master said to his disciples, “The immortals have summoned me.” With these words, he bathed, donned his robes and cap, lit incense, and paid homage to the ten directions before departing the world.\n\nThe Master’s songs and poems were compiled in the *Yunguang Collection*, which circulated in the world. In the sixth year of the *Zhiyuan* era of the Great Yuan, the first month of the *jisi* year, he was posthumously honored as *Yuyang Tixuan Guangdu Perfected*.\n\nEarlier, during the *Mingchang* era’s change of reign, on the fifth day of the fifth month, Liu Zhi of Laiyang County petitioned the Master, saying he had no heir. The Master replied, “You are wealthy and fond of propriety—how could you be without descendants? Yet I shall petition the heavens on your behalf.” On the fifteenth day of the sixth month, he visited Liu’s home, where Liu had prepared a feast. The Master said, “I have come to bestow an heir—how can I be received with ordinary wine?” Pointing to the northwest corner of the storeroom, he said, “The sealed jar there holds fine wine.” Liu went to retrieve it and found a vessel of warmed wine. The Master said, “Not only is this wine exceptional—your heir will be as well.” He then asked for paper and wrote a verse, later adding the four characters *sishi yingzhen* (“forty-four *yingzhen*”). The following year, on the fourteenth day of the fourth month, a son was born. Liu begged for a name, and the Master said, “I have already given him one.” After a long pause, Liu said, “Forty-four is plain to all—are the words *yingzhen* his name?” The Master replied, “This is the day of Pure Yang’s descent into the world—is he not an *yingzhen*?” Thus, he was named.\n\nAs for the Master’s other deeds—curing Chichi Jin’s chronic illness, reviving the condemned Pan Xin, lying in frozen snow at Zhao Shi’s gate, restoring the parrot to Qiang Huang’s perch, playing chess in winter clad only in a single robe, storing wine in a bottomless jar, summoning mountain roars and valley echoes when transmitting the Dao, and causing ghosts and spirits to emerge when inscribing talismans—such wonders were too numerous to record. These were but a few of the Master’s responses to the world, all of which are detailed in other records and thus not fully recounted here.\n\n---\n\n**Hao Datong**\n\nThe Master’s name was Datong, his courtesy name Taigu, and he was a native of Ninghai. *Guangning* was his sobriquet. Born on the third day of the first month of the third year of the *Tianjuan* era of Emperor Xizong of Jin, he came from a family of officials and was a younger cousin of Hao Chaolie. Orphaned young, he served his mother with great filial piety. Once, he dreamed of a divine being revealing to him the secret meanings of the *Book of Changes*, and from then on, he thoroughly understood the principles of yin and yang, calendrical calculations, and divination. Disdaining worldly splendor, he delighted in simplicity, concealing his virtue within the practice of divination.\n\nIn the seventh year of the *Dading* era of Emperor Shizong, the Patriarch arrived in Ninghai and, seeing the Master’s noble bearing and uncommon pursuits, was moved by the mechanism of “turning one’s back to sit.” The following evening, at Chaoyuan Abbey, he bestowed upon the Master two *ci* poems. In an instant, the Master awakened, as if a traveler lost on a ten-thousand-*li* journey had heard a single call and found his way home. This was due to the power of his inherent wisdom and the long-cultivated influence of past practice.\n\nAfter their first conversation, their bond deepened day by day. In the third month of the eighth year, the Master followed the Patriarch to Kunyu’s Yanzia Cave and requested to be counted among his disciples to seek the Dao. The Patriarch then named him *Lin* and gave him the Daoist appellation *Tianranzi*. He also cut off the sleeves of the Master’s tattered robe, saying, “Do not worry about lacking sleeves—you will achieve greatness on your own.” This was the intent of transmitting the Dao. The Master’s later names and titles were said to have been obtained by chance while traveling on the road to Fengxiang.\n\nWhile in Wendeng, the Master often carried a clay jar to beg for food. After half a year, he accidentally broke it. The Patriarch then inscribed a verse on it, saying:\n*“Shatter the true ash jar,*\n*Yet gain the Wind-Harm Abbey.*\n*Only when you awaken to the remnants*\n*Will someone call you ‘person.’”*\n\nIn the autumn of the ninth year, the four Masters—Ma, Tan, Liu, and Qiu—followed the Patriarch west, leaving the Master and Yuyang to reside at Chashan. Later, Yuyang, believing the Master lacked resolve, earnestly admonished and encouraged him. The Master then traveled west to visit the four Masters. At the time, the four were dwelling in a hut by the Patriarch’s tomb, observing mourning rites. When the rites concluded, the Master wished to stay with them. Upon hearing Tan Changzhen’s remark about “turning with the heels of others,” he set out the next day for Qishan, where he encountered a divine being who once again taught him the profound meanings of the *Book of Changes*.\n\nIn the fifteenth year, he sat beneath the bridge at Wozhou without speaking. Children often played with him, stacking bricks and stones into a pagoda on his head, warning them not to topple it. His head never turned, and even when the river flooded, he remained unmoved and unharmed.\n\nFor six years he maintained this resolve, steadfast as described. Guo Changqian, Vice Prefect of Zhen Ding, passed by and dismounted to pay his respects, offering generous gifts. Hoping the Master would glance his way, he could not elicit even a look, and departed in awe.\n\nIn his twenty-second year, he resided in Zhen Ding, where each time he ascended the hall to lecture, hundreds from near and far gathered to listen. His question-and-answer verses, poems, and discourses on the *Book of Changes*, *Can Tong Qi*, and symbolic diagrams totaled over thirty thousand words, collectively titled *The Grand Antiquity Collection*. Later, in Xian Ping, he befriended the scholar Wang Huixian and his retinue of ten or more. Their divinations proved accurate eight or nine times out of ten, while the Master’s were infallible. Thus, Huixian and his circle revered him as divine, beseeching him to occupy the master’s seat and transmit his esoteric teachings. Through this, Huixian’s name resounded even at court.\n\nOnce, the Master wished to create *Book of Changes* diagrams and suddenly demanded a brush. His disciple Fan Yuanxi announced that the porridge was ready, to which the Master replied, “Bring it quickly—I am just now grasping the meaning.” Brush in hand, he dashed off thirty diagrams in a single morning. Whether foretelling the fire at Tianchang for Hou Zizhen, entering the dreams of Wang Zhenguo of Enzhou at night, discerning fortunes and misfortunes, predicting the success or failure of the Dao’s spread, or foreseeing the timing of military campaigns—whatever was spoken before him invariably proved true afterward. As Zhang Bangzhi (Zizhong) of the Historiography Bureau remarked, his deeds startled the eyes and ears of all. His disciples often recounted these wonders, though they are not recorded here.\n\nIn the twelfth month of the first year of Chongqing’s reign, on the thirtieth day, he shed his mortal form at the Xiantian Abbey in Ninghai, aged seventy-three. Three years prior, he had instructed his disciples to prepare his burial, and the appointed time came to pass as foretold. In the sixth year of the Zhiyuan era of the Great Yuan (jisi, 1269), he was posthumously enfeoffed as *Guangning Tongxuan Taigu Zhenren* (Perfected One of Vast Serenity and Grand Antiquity Who Penetrates the Mysteries).\n\n---\n\n**He Dejin**\nThe Perfected One Yuchan, surnamed He, named Dejin, hailed from Ganquan in Qinzhou. Once a minor official, he never took ill-gotten gains. Daily, he conversed and drank with a Daoist, laughing over profound mysteries. Later, the Daoist arrived with an owl perched on his arm, remarking, “This creature is strange—large-eyed yet blind to men.” Yuchan did not grasp his meaning. Soon after, the Daoist contracted a loathsome disease and died. Yuchan prepared a proper burial with full rites. Within months, an old woman arrived at his door, saying, “The Daoist who passed was my son. Now aged and without support, what am I to do?” Yuchan presented her with gold and silk. The woman replied, “If only I could open the grave and see my son once more, I would have no regrets.” Yuchan led neighbors to the grave, unsealed the coffin—and the corpse had vanished, leaving only the gifts for the woman. Turning back, they found the woman gone as well. Moved by this revelation, Yuchan abandoned his home and entered the mountains. Later, he encountered a perfected being and attained the wonders of the Ninefold Cyclic Elixir of Gold Fluid. Wandering Mount Zhongnan, he practiced his transmission, advancing daily in refinement until he achieved harmonious subtlety, wondrous efficacy, and divine communion. When he met Perfected Wang Chongyang, they became friends in the forest of immortals, and none knew his ultimate fate.\n\n---\n\n**Li Lingyang**\nThe Perfected One Lingyang, surnamed Li (his given name and courtesy name are unknown), was a native of Jingzhao. Taciturn and sparing of desires, he was learned and erudite yet devoted to the Dao of immortality. A Daoist transmitted to him the secret of the Embracing Unity Talisman and the Great Cinnabar of Fire. Abandoning the mundane world, he practiced diligently from dawn to dusk. Over years, he attained the highest mysteries. With Yuchan and Chongyang, he became a friend of the forests and springs of Zhongnan. Once, he told Chongyang, “One day, your Dao will transform the Nine Regions, and your teachings will spread across the Four Seas—beyond the likes of us.” In the *jichou* year of the Tai Ding era of Jin Shizong (1169), Chongyang brought the Four Perfected Ones to Bianjing and sent a poem to them:\n\n*With Master He and Master Li,*\n*Three of one mind from the first.*\n\nAfter Chongyang ascended to perfection, Danyang led Qiu, Liu, and Tan to pay their respects. One day, the two masters left money at a Zhongnan inn, instructing, “If three immortals—Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma—arrive today, host them.” When the Four Masters arrived, the innkeeper called out their surnames to greet them. Danyang laughed, “How did you know our names?” The innkeeper replied, “Masters He and Li left instructions beforehand, so I recognized you.” At the time, the two masters were staying at the Taiping Abbey. After dining, the Four Masters visited the abbey to pay their respects. From then on, within the gates of the Perfected, all addressed them as “Master Uncle.”\n\n---\n\n**Huangfu Tan**\nMaster Tan, whose given name was Tan and courtesy name Lüdao, bore the surname Huangfu. His lineage and origins are obscure. Some say he once lived in Linzi and Xiaqiu, where he mastered the arts of the Three Avoidances and Five Substitutions. Later, he wandered near Mount Emei in Shu. One snowy night, he heard a voice call out, “You possess the qi of the Dao—I shall deliver you.” Turning, he saw a Daoist beneath a thatched eave. The Daoist bade him lie down, soles touching. As he slept, warmth spread from his feet, suffusing his body and rising to his crown, as if bathed in the gentle breeze of spring. At dawn, the Daoist shook out his robes and departed. When Master Tan asked his name, the Daoist only said, “Seek me later at the Lingquan Abbey.” Later, at the abbey, he saw a portrait of the Tang recluse Zhu Taochui, whom the people of Shu called Perfected One Miaotong. Only then did he realize his encounter had been with Perfected Zhu.\n\nOne day, Master Tan traveled with another Daoist and again met Miaotong on the road. Miaotong handed him a section of winter melon and several scallions, saying, “Go ahead to the wine shop in the city.” Following his instructions, he arrived at dusk near the pass. The melon had transformed into a human head, the scallions into hair, and water splashed on his clothes left bloodstains. The gate officers seized him and his companion. Master Tan alone took responsibility, offering no explanation of their origins. At dawn, they were to be sent to the prefecture—but the melon and scallions had reverted to their original forms, and the bloodstains vanished. The officials, astonished, comforted and released them. Outside the gate, Miaotong was already waiting.\n\nWith a laugh, he said, “You are truly teachable.” Thereupon, he cooked the melon and drank with him, then imparted the principles of *xu-kǎn* and *shi-lí*. Again, he led him onto a boat, raised his staff, and struck the water to demonstrate—each time the waves stilled, he struck again. After several repetitions, he turned and asked, “Do you understand?” Master Tan could only murmur in assent. Then he transmitted the secrets of the inner and outer elixirs.\n\nFrom that time on, wherever he went, he cultivated and maintained his practice, indifferent to cold or heat, seclusion or company. Even when seated at leisure, he never slept, and his outer ankles lay perfectly flat. One day, he saw a pearl of radiant flame at the crown of his head. He sang:\n\n*Atop the mountain, the red sun rises,*\n*Fresh sprouts the medicinal herb.*\n*I would entrust my heart’s affairs,*\n*Yet few know the zither’s tune—*\n*When the strings break, who will listen?*\n\nThose who recognized its meaning took it as proof of his elixir’s completion. Soon after, he traveled throughout the land, healing the sick and aiding all beings to accumulate merit and virtue.\n\nIn the twenty-seventh year of the Shaoxing reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Song, Empress Dowager Xianren suffered from an eye ailment that no imperial physician could cure. One night, she dreamed of a Daoist in yellow robes with long whiskers and broad ears. The Empress Dowager asked, “Can you heal my eyes?” He replied, “I can.” She said, “If you restore my sight, you shall be my master.” Upon waking, she found the dream strange and recounted it to Emperor Gaozong, who issued an edict to seek him out.\n\nAt the time, Master Tan was traveling in the south, calling himself an “eye doctor.” When Prefect Zhang of Lin’an saw his portrait, he recognized the likeness and dispatched men to find him in Jiankang. His name was then reported to the court. Summoned to the imperial audience hall, the emperor asked how he cultivated himself. Master Tan replied, “My cultivation of the self is like Your Majesty’s governance of the realm. When the heart is without action, the body is at peace; when the emperor is without action, the world is well-ordered.” The emperor approved of his words and informed the Empress Dowager.\n\nThe next day, he was summoned to accompany her to the Cining Palace. There, Master Tan respectfully exhaled and directed his *qi* toward the Empress Dowager. After a long while, the obstruction in her eyes cleared, and her vision returned. Recognizing him, she exclaimed with joy, “This is the master I saw in my dream!” From then on, the palace referred to him as “Master Immortal.”\n\nThere was a concubine, Lady Zhen, who had been bedridden for years and could only walk by hopping. The Empress Dowager ordered Master Tan to direct his *qi* toward her as well, and immediately she was able to walk normally. As he prepared to return to the mountains, he left a fan in the palace, saying, “If anyone suffers from chills or fever, fanning them with this will bring recovery.” Soon after, many in the palace fell ill with malaria, and the fan proved effective for all.\n\nOn the day of his farewell audience, both the emperor and the Empress Dowager bestowed lavish gifts, but Master Tan accepted only incense, tea, and clothing. The emperor held him in high regard. As he departed, he commanded that imperial incense be offered in prayer at the Zhangren Temple on Mount Qingcheng. After the rites were completed, Master Tan returned to the Anjing Temple to burn incense—this was the former hermitage of Miaotong. He then submitted a memorial requesting the renovation of the temple and composed an inscription for Miaotong’s portrait:\n\n*Perfected One of the Spirit Spring,*\n*Essence of Shu’s two lands.*\n*Attained the Dao by Ma Creek,*\n*Composed verses in thatched huts.*\n*Through ages you saved all beings,*\n*Revealing the near, yet not possessing.*\n*Only I know my master—*\n*I bow my head in reverence.*\n\nThe following year, he returned to the Xiandu Temple in Zhongzhou. Atop Pingdu Mountain stood a giant banyan tree, struck dead by lightning twenty years prior. Master Tan exhaled upon it and prayed, and within a month, its branches and leaves flourished anew. Wang Congdao recorded the event and had it carved in stone.\n\nLater, the emperor sent an envoy with a handwritten edict to express his regard, saying: *“Your pure and solitary bearing shines beyond the world, casting off the chaff of mundane dust, chanting poems amidst rosy clouds—truly a joyous life. Since we parted last autumn, a year has passed in the blink of an eye. My thoughts long for your words, my spirit reaches toward the distant. I imagine you meeting friends at Yuanlan on Mount Qingcheng, while the white clouds have no heart for the imperial capital. The autumn cold draws near—when shall we meet again? I hope you will soon fulfill your promise, for riding the *qi* and commanding the wind would be effortless for you. The Xiang River’s waves stretch white, osmanthus blossoms waft their fragrance, and the palace halls stand lofty. From afar, I yearn to inquire of the Dao, my heart ever open to your teachings. The lingering heat lingers in the season—may you preserve your clarity and emptiness.”*\n\nUpon receiving the edict, Master Tan set out at once. When he arrived, he was granted a purple robe, a black robe, and silk slippers, and was led by the Chamberlain of the Imperial Court to an audience. The emperor asked him about the way of long life and enduring vision. Master Tan replied that clarity, emptiness, and few desires came first—one must first reduce all desires and not let them run wild. “Ten thousand volumes of elixir scriptures are not as good as guarding the One.” The emperor praised him at length, saying, “A true perfected one.”\n\nFrom then on, word spread throughout the court and beyond, and all competed to call him “Perfected One.” Another day, the emperor asked again. Master Tan replied, “Immortal and Daoist are not inherently numinous—they accumulate essence and amass *qi* to become true.” Grasping the emperor’s intent, he sighed in admiration again and again, saying, “This is why he is a Perfected One.” He then inscribed the words on a fan and bestowed it upon him, along with copies of the *Daode Jing*, *Huangting Jing*, and *Yinfu Jing*.\n\nAt the time, the monk Kai of Suzhou, also a man who had heard the Dao, was summoned to court. Master Tan was already present. Though they had never met, when the monk entered, he bowed deeply to the emperor but, upon seeing Master Tan, immediately prostrated himself. Offered a seat, he declined. When asked why, he said, “The ranks of immortals have high and low—Perfected One stands above. I dare not sit.” Only when pressed did he sit on the floor.\n\nLater, Master Tan requested to return to the mountains, but the emperor detained him for the suburban sacrifice. The emperor was concerned about the prolonged rain, and Master Tan assured him it would clear. As he prepared to stay at Mount Qingcheng, the emperor sent another inquiry. Master Tan presented a poem:\n\n*At night, the stars in the sky shine bright,*\n*At dawn, the moon on the altar glows fair.*\n*The imperial enterprise stands firm, the restoration’s work,*\n*May the emperor’s reign endure for a hundred million years.*\n\nThat night, the skies indeed cleared. The emperor ordered a tent set up for Master Tan at the Jiahui Gate, providing incense, candles, food, and an array of gold vessels from the imperial collection. When the emperor returned, Master Tan greeted the imperial carriage of the retired emperor, who glanced at him and smiled faintly. That same day, he was summoned to a farewell banquet, where he composed a poem:\n\n*Each time I receive the sky’s smile,*\n*I bring spring to all things.*\n\nThe emperor was overjoyed. Soon after, Master Tan again requested to return to the mountains, but the emperor firmly urged him to stay. Unable to refuse, the emperor ordered a hermitage built on Mount Lushan for ease of summoning him. He also had a portrait of Master Tan painted, inscribed with an imperial title—*Portrait of the Perfected Royal Uncle*—and composed a eulogy:\n\n*The scholar Royal Uncle Huangfu,\nBrow marked as one of the immortals.\nBy the Dao he revives the age—\nWho could reckon his years?\nA lone cloud drifts in the void,\nA solitary crane soars through the heavens.\nWith a laugh and a toss of his beard,\nHe merges with the natural.*\n\nThe portrait was sealed in a brocade pouch and entrusted to Zhang, the Director of the Palace Eunuch Service, to present to Master Tan. It was then brought back and kept within the palace. Later, it was moved to the Daoist abbey of the De Shou Palace, where the empress dowager donated gold for the construction of a hermitage. Master Tan, lifting the cloth bundle containing his Daoist robes, declined, saying, *\"This alone is my hermitage—there is no need for gold.\"* He steadfastly refused. The empress dowager then instructed Dong Zhongyong, an officer of the Imperial Pharmacy Service, to secretly tuck the gold into Master Tan’s sleeping mat before departing. When Master Tan discovered it upon setting out, he immediately sealed it and sent it to the Lin’an Prefecture for remittance. Upon his arrival at Mount Lu, the empress dowager once more dispatched an envoy bearing gold to bestow upon him, but he again firmly declined. Shortly after, an edict was issued to Jiangzhou, ordering that funds from temple offerings be allocated for his use. Only then, out of necessity, did Master Tan accept.\n\nBy the empress dowager’s decree, two grand *jiao* rituals were established across the land to pray for blessings upon the emperor and all living beings. The remaining funds were to be remitted, but the empress dowager would not permit it. Instead, she commanded the two chief ministers, Cao Xun and Bai Yun, the Recluse of the Cloudy Abode, along with Yong Shouning, to use the money—augmented with additional gold—to purchase two estates for Master Tan on the northern and southern slopes of the mountain. The northern estate was named *Bronze Plate*, and the southern *Cinnabar Cassia*, their annual income to be used for hosting wandering Daoist scholars. Master Tan then built his hermitage at Lotus Flower Grotto, where he settled a company of cloud-roaming adepts.\n\nIn the first year of the *Longxing* era of Emperor Xiaozong, the retired emperor sent an imperial letter to Master Tan, saying: *\"Since retiring to my separate palace, I have devoted myself daily to nurturing my spirit and cultivating my will. I long to see your noble presence and share in intimate discourse on the Dao. I pray you command your carriage to come soon, that we may enjoy a moment of leisure together.\"*\n\nDeeply moved by his unwavering devotion, the emperor expressed his utmost sincerity. Upon Master Tan’s arrival, he was summoned for an audience at Kangshou Hall and lodged in the Western Study of Xianying Abbey by West Lake. The emperor appointed Cao Xun of the Two Ministries as his companion and interlocutor, hosting banquets in his honor on multiple occasions.\n\nLater, when Master Tan journeyed to Mount Tiantai, auspicious lingzhi mushrooms sprouted in Kangshou Hall. The emperor again dispatched envoys from the Two Ministries to convey his concern and bestowed two hundred taels of aloeswood, along with a painted fan featuring lingzhi motifs, personally inscribed with an imperial encomium.\n\nAt the beginning of the *Qiandao* era, as Master Tan traveled to Mount Wudang, the retired emperor sent Chamberlain Chen Qiu of Deshou Palace to summon him, catching up with him in Xiangyang. Cao Xun of the Two Ministries was then ordered to welcome and attend to him along the way. In the second year of *Qiandao*, upon arriving at the imperial residence, Master Tan was again lodged at Xianying Abbey with an official companion. The following day, he was summoned for an audience and granted a banquet. The day after, the emperor visited his quarters, inviting him aboard the imperial barge for a lakeside excursion through the gardens.\n\nThereafter, Master Tan frequently attended imperial feasts, where the emperor inquired into the principles of cultivating truth. The emperor bestowed upon him a copy of the *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for Salvation*, inscribed in his own hand, while Empress Shousheng presented the *Scripture of Pure Serenity*.\n\nWhen Emperor Xiaozong first ascended the throne, he once transmitted an edict to summon Master Tan, who responded with a memorial of over a hundred words, urging the emperor to weigh punishment and virtue judiciously, curb desires, and govern in accordance with the principles of preserving life. Later, the emperor summoned him for a private audience in the inner palace, hosting an intimate banquet where he personally offered dozens of toasts and presented rare imperial incense and tea.\n\nIn the third year of *Qiandao*, on the retired emperor’s birthday, he wished to offer prayers at Mount Song, Mount Lu, and Mount Qingcheng. Believing Master Tan’s sincerity sufficient to move the divine, he entrusted him with the sacred incense of both palaces and sent him by imperial barge to Jiujiang. Upon reaching Mount Qingcheng, as Master Tan began his prayers, a yellow dragon appeared.\n\nEarlier, during the *Jingkang* calamity of Emperor Qinzong, Cao Xun of the Two Ministries had carried an imperial letter from Emperor Huizong back from Yanjing. Stranded at the Yellow River without a boat, he encountered Master Tan by the riverside at night. Master Tan bound reeds into a raft and ferried him across. Upon reaching the shore, Cao lay frozen and near death. Master Tan kindled the reeds to warm him, and after some time, he revived. When asked his name, Master Tan did not answer, saying only: *\"The Perfected Master Zhu sent me to ferry you across, for you are destined to stabilize the realm. Thirty years hence, we shall meet again in Qiantang.\"* With that, he departed.\n\nWhen Master Tan later answered the imperial summons and reunited with Cao, they recalled the past vow. Cao, recognizing his features, wept and bowed in reverence, thereafter treating him as his master. In a poem later gifted to Master Tan, Cao wrote:\n*\"I sigh for my solitary self in youth—\nby the Yellow River’s crossing, your kindness saved me.\"*\nThis recounted their earlier encounter. The retired emperor, learning of this, ensured that all subsequent summons, welcomes, and lodgings were entrusted to Cao.\n\nMaster Tan constructed a pavilion to house the imperial calligraphy bestowed upon him. The retired emperor named it the *Shaoxing Huànwén Pavilion* and commanded the two chief ministers to inscribe its plaque. Earlier, when the hermitage on Mount Lu was completed, the number of Daoist followers gathering for meals grew daily, and drawing water from the stream had become a hardship. One day, Master Tan took up a spade and led others to dig beside the hermitage. After no more than one or two feet, a spring gushed forth from a crevice in the rock—clear, cold, and sweet—remaining unfailing even in drought. When he later answered the imperial summons, the retired emperor happened to inquire about his mountain dwelling, and Master Tan reported the matter. Empress Dowager Shousheng, who was present, remarked: *\"Wherever Master Tan resides, divine beings must surely protect him.\"* The retired emperor then named it *Divine Spring* and bestowed two characters in his own calligraphy as a gift. In the ninth year of the Qiandao era, he again granted an imperial inscription—*Qīngxū Hermitage*—for the gate plaque, along with an annual allotment of ordination certificates for Daoist priests to maintain the incense and lamps.\n\nMaster Tan answered four imperial summons in all. After the retired emperor withdrew to the *Déshòu Palace*, his favor only deepened. Each time Master Tan arrived, banquets and rewards followed without fail, and rare delicacies were bestowed daily. When he returned a second time from Mount Qingcheng, he swept the dust from the roads to the capital, yet only the *Déshòu Palace* sent seasonal inquiries without cease. Envoys were repeatedly dispatched to summon him from the mountain, but he firmly declined each time.\n\nIn the autumn of the fifth year of the Chunxi era, he suddenly declared: *\"I am about to journey far—how can I not take leave of the retired emperor?\"* He prepared his belongings as if to depart for the imperial residence, but in the end, he did not go. On the twenty-third day of the ninth month, he dictated his final words and instructed his disciples to draft a posthumous memorial for presentation. He also composed farewell letters to all scholar-officials, Daoists, and Buddhists with whom he shared close bonds.\n\nThe next morning, he rose early, bathed, and donned fresh robes. At midday, he ascended the hall, gathered his followers, and burned incense. Taking the imperial calligraphy and the garments bestowed by the throne, he handed them to his disciples, saying: *\"I am about to wander to the realm of the formless. These were gifts from the retired emperor—they should remain to guard this sacred mountain. You who come after must succeed one another as abbots, passing them down in turn. Treasure and preserve them, and do not defy my instructions.\"* He added: *\"The Dao does not fail those who uphold it. All of you, strive on—farewell, farewell.\"*\n\nWith these words, he clasped his hands, let his feet hang down, and sat upon the rope bed, where he passed away. For three days, his body neither stiffened nor slumped; his complexion remained rosy and radiant, his beard and hair black as lacquer. When placed in the coffin, his flesh was still soft and warm.\n\nThen his disciples Cao Mishen, Xie Shouxie, and twenty-four of their followers, on the renchen day of the twelfth month, reverently enshrined his remains in a burial mound to the left of the hermitage, in accordance with his final instructions. Earlier, when excavating the tomb, they unearthed a white toad from beneath several *ren* of five-colored earth, and also discovered an ancient broken stele bearing the four characters *ling cui ling zhou*. On the evening before the interment, a celestial lamp descended to illuminate the site, lingering until dawn before vanishing. Over two thousand mourners attended the funeral. As the coffin was lowered, a crane circled above, hovering until the rites were complete before departing.\n\nLuo Yan—known as \"Red-Foot Yan\" among the common folk—was a woman from the inner chambers. In her youth, she encountered a strange person who took her away, and upon returning, she gained profound understanding. During the Xuanhe reign of Emperor Huizong of the Song, someone spoke of her to the court, and she was bestowed the title *Jingying Recluse*. When Duke Zhang the Valiant was pacifying Shaanxi and Sichuan, he invited her to his military camp. As the Jin raiders besieged Feng Pass, elite troops were repeatedly dispatched. The general Wu Zhen engaged them, inflicting and suffering equal losses, yet the enemy remained entrenched. The duke grew anxious. Luo said: *\"Do not fear, my lord. Tomorrow, the raiders will retreat. If not, I shall submit to execution for misleading the army.\"* The next day, the enemy indeed withdrew, and the duke began to hold her in awe. He repeatedly memorialized the throne, and she was honored as *Master of Supreme Harmony and Tranquil Simplicity*.\n\nShe often traveled to Hanzhou, and whenever she arrived, she would lodge at the home of Wang Zhixing, a court gentleman for attendance. The Wang family had hosted her for three generations. She treated Zhixing and his wife with great reverence, saying, *\"They were my parents in a former life.\"*\n\nIn the sixth year of Emperor Gaozong’s Shaoxing reign (1136), a great famine struck Shu. Zhixing purchased a concubine from among the refugees, a woman of striking beauty. Luo saw her and exclaimed in alarm: *\"How has this person come to be in your household? If she remains, disaster will follow—no small matter. I shall remove her.\"* She ordered several *dou* of water boiled, then took a basket of lime from beneath a turtle’s shell. Summoning the concubine, she covered the woman’s head with a cloth and poured the scalding water over the lime. Smoke billowed forth, and the concubine collapsed—revealing only a pile of withered bones. Luo asked: *\"Did she pass through a female broker when she arrived? Where is the broker now?\"* *\"At such-and-such a place,\"* came the reply. Luo hastily summoned the broker, and as the woman approached, she again covered the bones with a cloth. The remains transformed back into a human figure, her movements and bearing unchanged from before. Luo then returned her to the broker and reclaimed the purchase price.\n\nZhixing’s younger cousin, Zhiju, had passed the imperial examinations and was returning home. Luo encountered him elsewhere and handed him a sealed scroll, cautioning: *\"If you encounter misfortune upon returning home, open this.\"* Three days after arriving, he received news of his mother’s death. He opened the scroll to find a painting: an official in green robes riding a horse, followed by well-wishers, and at the rear, a coffin with mourners in funeral garb weeping behind it.\n\nLonghua Temple in Guangdu was the ancestral merit cloister of the Yuwen clan. Luo sat with the abbot, then suddenly rose and said: *\"Someone from your quarters is coming.\"* The monk asked in surprise: *\"Where?\"* *\"Into the ancestral hall,\"* she replied. The monk dismissed her words as absurd. The next day, a messenger from Yuwen Shizhong arrived—his wife, née Fang, had died the previous day.\n\nOnce, while staying in Yangzhou Garrison, she lodged at the Chen residence. One night, she rushed back from the privy, exclaiming: *\"Strange, most strange!\"* She explained: *\"Just now, four men in white scaled the wall and entered the garden.\"* The Chen household was alarmed, but Luo reassured them: *\"This does not concern you. By tomorrow morning, you will understand.\"* At dawn, the gardener reported that a ewe had given birth to four lambs.\n\nIn the thirtieth year of the Shaoxing reign (1160), she fell ill in Yanting and sent word to Wenjiang, requesting to be taken to the home of Li Zhi, the judicial commissioner. Li dispatched several servants to fetch her. Though her illness had improved, she set out on the road, warning her attendants: *\"To the left lies the route through Jintang—shorter and easier. However, I do not wish to take it. Proceed instead through Guanghan or another western road. Do not disobey.\"* The servants agreed but later disregarded her words, taking her to Gucheng Town instead. She died upon reaching Wenjiang.\n\nThe people of Shu believed she had lived to the age of one hundred seventy or eighty.\n\n*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Embracing the Dao Through the Ages, Continued* – Volume Three (concluded)\n*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Embracing the Dao Through the Ages, Continued* – Volume Four\n\n**Sa Shoujian**\nThe Perfected Master Sa, named Shoujian, was a native of Nanhua. Some say he was from Xihe, and he styled himself the \"Guest of Fenyang.\" From youth, he harbored a heart for aiding others and benefiting all things. He once studied medicine but, having mistakenly killed a patient with his prescription, abandoned the profession. Hearing of the lofty Daoist arts of the thirtieth-generation Celestial Master, Master Xujing, as well as those of the two attendants, Lin and Wang, he sought to study their methods. Leaving Shu, he traveled to Shaanxi, where his traveling funds were exhausted. As he sat dejectedly upon a rock, three Daoist adepts suddenly appeared. Sa asked how far it was to Xinzhou, and the adepts inquired about his purpose. Sa replied that he wished to visit Celestial Master Xujing to study the Daoist arts. The adepts said, \"The Celestial Master has already ascended.\" Sa was dismayed, but one adept said, \"The present Celestial Master’s arts are also profound. I am acquainted with him and shall write a letter for you to visit him. I also have a method to teach you, by which you may sustain yourself daily.\" He then imparted the technique of \"chanting over jujubes.\" \"Chant over one jujube,\" he said, \"and you may take seven coins. Chant over ten jujubes in a day, and you will earn seventy coins—enough for your daily needs.\" Another adept said, \"I, too, have a method to teach you.\" He gave Sa a palm-leaf fan, saying, \"When someone is ill, fan them, and they will recover.\" The third adept said, \"I shall teach you the Thunder Rites.\" Sa bowed and received the teachings, all of which proved effective. One day, he chanted over a hundred jujubes but took only seventy coins for his daily use, distributing the rest to the poor.\n\nUpon reaching Xinzhou, he met the Celestial Master and presented the letter. The entire household wept, for it was in the hand of the thirtieth-generation Celestial Master. The letter stated: \"I and Attendants Lin and Wang have met Sa so-and-so and each imparted a method to him. You may now teach him the remaining texts.\" From then on, Sa’s Daoist arts flourished. Once, he lodged for several days in a city-god temple. The prefect dreamed that the city god told him, \"Master Sa has stayed here for days, making my dwelling uneasy. Please kindly send him away.\" The prefect went to the temple and drove Sa out. After traveling several dozen *li*, Sa encountered a man carrying a pig to the temple to fulfill a vow. Sa gave him a small bundle of incense, saying, \"After fulfilling your vow, place an incense burner and burn it.\" The man followed his instructions, and with a sudden clap of thunder, fire consumed the temple without spreading to the neighboring homes.\n\nThree years later, Sa arrived at a ferry crossing where no boatman was present. He poled the boat himself and placed three coins in it as payment for the crossing. As he cupped water to wash his hands, he saw a man in an iron crown and red robe, holding a jade axe, standing in the water. Sa rebuked him, saying, \"Who are you? Reveal yourself at once!\" The man stood to the side and said, \"I am Wang Shan, the city god of such-and-such a prefecture. Yesterday, the Perfected Master burned my temple, leaving my household of over three hundred without refuge. I am truly innocent, so I appealed to the Jade Emperor. The Emperor granted me this jade axe and ordered me to follow you. If the Perfected Master violates the celestial laws, I am permitted to act first and report later. I have followed you for three years, yet you have broken no laws. Today, when you placed coins in the boat, I realized there would be no opportunity for repayment. Now, I wish to become your subordinate general and carry out your decrees.\" Sa replied, \"Even if you follow me for another three years, it will be the same.\" He then memorialized the Jade Emperor, who promoted Wang to the rank of subordinate general. Thereafter, whenever Sa performed rituals, responses came as swiftly as an echo.\n\nHe once wrote a poem:\n*\"The Daoist arts upon the body are no trifling matter,*\n*Reflecting on precepts and conduct chills the heart.*\n*A thousand-year iron tree blooms with ease,*\n*But to emerge from Fengdu in a day is hard.\"*\n\nAnother poem read:\n*\"Speak pure words yet act with impurity—do not discuss the Dao,*\n*Disregard heaven’s laws and act recklessly.*\n*Abide by your nature and calm your spirit and qi,*\n*Why fear your name will not be recorded in the immortal realms?\"*\n\nAfter attaining the Dao, the Perfected Master traveled to Minzhong. One day, he sat upright and transcended.\n\n**Zhao Mayi**\nZhao Mayi’s origins are unknown. During the reign of Emperor Xizong of the Tang, when Huang Chao’s rebellion arose, Mayi took refuge in Mount Zhongnan. There, he saw dozens of Daoist adepts dwelling in the mountains. With no food to eat, he offered to work as a servant. Through this, he encountered an opportunity and attained the Dao. In the early Jianyan era of the Song Emperor Gaozong, he began wandering to Mount Qingcheng. After a long time, he entered the Jade Bureau of Chengdu to transcend. He built a hut from connected branches and wore a robe of hempen rags, earning the name \"Hemp-Clad.\" His form was withered like deadwood, yet his bones did not protrude, and his spirit shone with clarity. By day, he would walk and uproot any standing grass or trees he saw. By evening, he would scatter the uprooted plants across the road. No one understood his intent, nor did they see him eat or drink. When people prepared tea or wine to invite him, he sometimes ignored them, other times stayed to drink. When he offered tea to others, those who drank it found it exceptionally fragrant and refreshing. Mayi occasionally spoke of the Five Dynasties and the present dynasty, his words coherent and well-reasoned. If pressed for details, he would take the *Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment* from his sleeve and say, \"It is all here.\" High officials and nobles invited him, but he never went. Some said he had once been a soldier in the Five Dynasties, later discharged, and his discharge papers still existed. He despised the color black.\n\nOne day, he sat cross-legged and transcended. His body remained as pure and white as jade.\n\n**Liu Juzhong**\nLiu Juzhong was a native of the capital.\n\nIn his youth, Liu Juzhong secluded himself on Mount Song, dwelling in its most secluded peak at a place called the Hermitage of the Crane-Tamer. Initially, he lived there with two companions, and every month or two they would descend the mountain to procure grain. The ascent was arduous, often requiring them to clamber up vines for an entire day before reaching the summit. The two companions, unable to endure the hardship, eventually left, while Liu remained unperturbed, living thus for twenty years. Later, fleeing turmoil, he came south.\n\nDuring the Shaoxing reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Song, he was once summoned to the palace and bestowed the title \"Recluse of Serene Stillness.\" Thereafter, he built a hut by Dong Lake in Yuzhang. When recounting his past, he would speak of those days: atop the loftiest peak of Mount Song lay a level expanse of a hundred *mu* suitable for farming. Nearby were smaller peaks and crags, where clouds and rain often lingered halfway up the slopes. Hundreds of large lizards, each three or four *chi* in length, would gather there. If one offered them food, they would eat from the hand, and their bodies, when stroked, felt smooth as fat. One day, they clustered around a basin, each dipping its head to drink, only to spit the water out immediately—now hardened into round pellets like bullets. These accumulated by the side until, in an instant, the ground was strewn with them. Suddenly, a clap of thunder resounded, and the pellets vanished. The next day, people below the mountain reported that hail had fallen at midday, revealing the lizards’ strange craft.\n\nHe also heard the sound of an old man reading aloud from within a stone cliff. Pressing closer to listen, all fell silent. Only after he withdrew did the voice resume.\n\nThe stone cliff later collapsed, revealing a trove of rare books—works on yin-yang cosmology, esoteric arts, the cultivation of immortality, and the alchemical arts of *huangbai*, with no subject left untouched. Upon descending the mountain, he took only a few complete volumes from beginning to end, burning the rest. He also once detected a mysterious fragrance filling his chamber, lingering for days before dissipating, its origin unknown.\n\nScholar Liu, in the *jiazi* year of the seventh reign of Emperor Shenzong’s *Yuanfeng* era (1084), was already over a hundred years old. No one knew how his life ended.\n\n**Qiao Ding**\nMaster Qiao Ding, styled Tianshou, hailed from Yuxi in Leting County, Fuzhou. Profound in the study of the *Yijing*, he attained the Dao while secluded in the Great Face Mountain of Qingcheng. In the early years of Emperor Gaozong’s *Jianyan* reign (1127–1130), he was summoned to Yangzhou for his moral conduct. Though the court sought to retain him for lectures, he declined and was appointed *Tongzhilang* of the Straight Secretariat before retiring. Now over a hundred and twenty years old, he dwells in a perilous nest-like abode inaccessible to others, yet every few years, he emerges at the mountain’s edge, where some have glimpsed him.\n\n**Yao Pingzhong**\nYao Pingzhong, styled Xiyan, took refuge in the Great Face Mountain of Qingcheng. During the early *Jingkang* era (1126) of Emperor Qinzong, while besieged in the capital, he led a night raid with elite soldiers against the enemy camp. The assault failed, and he escaped on a swift mule. In the early *Jianyan* era of Emperor Gaozong, proclamations were posted everywhere summoning him as *Guanchashi*, yet he never emerged. Between the *jiawu* and *yiwei* years of Emperor Xiaozong’s *Chunxi* reign (1174–1175), someone encountered him at the Zhangren Abbey in Qingcheng Mountain. Nearly ninety years old, his beard and whiskers trailed to the ground. Fond of cursive calligraphy, he was said to have already achieved immortality.\n\n**Cui Yu**\nMaster Cui Yu, a native of Tangzhou, served in the capital’s imperial guard in his youth. After retiring, he embraced the Dao and styled himself Zixia. During Emperor Gaozong’s *Shaoxing* era (1131–1162), he wandered to Luofu Mountain, already advanced in years. He never disclosed his age, yet his complexion remained youthful, his pupils bright, and his heart as untamed as the wilderness. Fond of wine, he would accept any invitation to drink, becoming intoxicated and singing. Yet his songs foretold fortune and misfortune with unerring accuracy. Later, he resided in Dongguan for several years.\n\nOne evening, he instructed Daoist disciples to hold a jiao ritual at Shangqing Abbey. After the rites concluded, he ordered wine to be poured. In the western chamber, he drank to intoxication, laughing and conversing as if entertaining guests. When others asked with whom he spoke, he replied, \"Masters Zhong, Lü, and Chen are gathered here.\" Once the cups were cleared, he sat upright and passed away in an instant. The townspeople collectively carried his body to Zixia Pavilion and cremated it. A butterfly, a foot in span, soared from the raging flames into the sky. That same day, villagers who recognized him saw him returning eastward at Pomegranate Blossom Ferry—no doubt bound for Luofu Mountain.\n\n**Liu Haoran**\nDuring Emperor Gaozong’s *Shaoxing* era (1131–1162), Yu Yunwen attended his father, who served as Transport Commissioner of Tongchuan. When his father fell ill, Yunwen observed purification rites for days on end and commanded the Daoist Liu Haoran to submit a memorial petitioning for his father’s life. Liu was renowned for his meticulous devotion; from midnight, he ascended the altar, and only at dawn did he rise, declaring: \"Just now, in the Celestial Court, I saw two lines in the memorial on the imperial desk: *'I beg to forfeit my own years to extend my father’s lifespan.'* The Emperor pointed and said, *'Yu Yunwen is most filial—he may be granted a ministerial post.'*\" Later, his father indeed passed away. Eighteen years afterward, Yunwen was appointed to the highest offices, fulfilling the prophecy.\n\n**Duan Can**\nDuan Can, styled Dequ, was a native of Wanzi in Yuanzhou. Though barely literate, he was of pure and cautious nature, never causing harm. Yet when he encountered injustice, he would roll up his sleeves and step forward. During Emperor Gaozong’s *Jianyan* era (1127–1130), bandits overran the land, and Duan’s clan of forty was plundered. Can boldly took gold and silk to ransom them; the bandits, moved by his righteousness, returned them all. In the fifth year of *Shaoxing* (1135), the southeast suffered a severe drought, and a bushel of rice cost over a thousand coins. Can distributed all his stored grain, selling it at the usual price. He also prepared congee to feed the starving, saving countless lives.\n\nLater, he suddenly grew weary of worldly affairs and built a hut in the cliffs of Yantian Mountain, where he inscribed the words \"magnanimous and unburdened\" in large characters. One day, he summoned his relatives and old friends, and bid farewell to his uncle, saying, \"Soon the Heavenly Emperor will summon me.\" Others did not take his words seriously, but after several days, he ascended a tower and struck the bell. With a resonant chime, he soared into the clouds and departed. The villagers rushed to his dwelling and found only his tattered clothes and shoes. Though many wished to report the matter to the imperial court, local officials who disapproved suppressed it, and the matter was dropped.\n\n**Rao Tingzhi**\nRao Tingzhi, styled Chaobi, was a native of Nancheng in Jianchang. Having passed the imperial examinations, he was a man of bold talent and moral integrity. In the seventh year of *Shaoxing* (1137) during the reign of Emperor Gaozong, he passed through Wuchang on business and had an extraordinary encounter. From that time on, he kept his distance from his wife and concubines, living in secluded dignity like a recluse of the forest groves. He composed a poem to record the event:\n\n*On the mid-autumn night of the year dingsi,*\n*I wandered by chance to Yellow Crane Tower.*\n*There I met an extraordinary man who imparted a secret teaching—*\n*Yet I regretted still being entangled in worldly affairs,*\n*Unable to devote myself to such pursuits.*\n\nThus, he wrote a poem to mark the occasion:\n\n*Before Yellow Crane Tower, the autumn moon is cold,*\n*The river before the tower vast, the mist boundless.*\n*Deep in the night, the clouds disperse, all sounds stilled,*\n*Alone with my clear shadow, I lean on the railing.*\n*A long whistle pierces the heavens,*\n*Revealing one who dines on rosy clouds and rides the wind.*\n*Through many lives, we had forged a bond of incense and flame,*\n*And by chance met, exchanging words.*\n*Suddenly, the bustle of the marketplace was washed away,*\n*And I seemed to stand in the land of nowhere.*\n*Looking back, past affairs were but a broken meal,*\n*Gazing down, the whole world had lost its way.*\n*Alas, I remain cramped by carriages and caps,*\n*Knowing that Lu Ao’s wanderings were not far off.*\n*In years to come, I vow to follow,*\n*To gaze together at Penglai’s shallow waters.*\n\nTwo years later, in the year *gengshen* (1140), as the court reclaimed the lands south of the Yangtze, he was appointed vice-prefect of Dengzhou. When the Jurchen broke their treaty and Dengzhou fell, he died in the aftermath. His coffin was transported back to his hometown, and those who carried it found it unusually light, though none dared open it to verify. People believed he had achieved *shijie*—transcendence through the dissolution of the body.\n\n**Su Xiang**\nSu Xiang of Danyang, whose given name was Xiang and style Yangzhi, lived by the Rear Lake before moving in his later years to Ma’er Mountain by Taihu Lake in Runzhou. In the eleventh month of the fourteenth year of *Shaoxing* (1144), during the *jiazi* year, he fell ill from drinking and lay prostrate outside when a village boy he employed, named Xu Xing, knocked at his bed and announced, \"A guest calling himself Jiang Xuanzan seeks an audience.\" The calling card read: *Jiang Guanchao, the Longevity Daoist of Shuilian Cave, Luofu Mountain, Huizhou.* On either side were inscribed two lines of poetry:\n\n*Wealth and honor are easily met, but days and months are short;*\n*What is hard to encounter here is long life.*\n\nPleased by the words, Su struggled to rise and received the guest. The visitor said, \"The Perfected Yellow of Luofu Mountain—who in the Jin dynasty served as prefect of Huizhou before abandoning office to enter Shuilian Cave—has noted that you have no desire for worldly fame or profit. Your name is already recorded in the registers of immortals, and he has sent me to deliver an elixir to you.\" At the time, Su was eighty years old. He replied, \"I have never met the Perfected One, and my body is already worn out. What use would an elixir be to me?\" The guest said, \"This is no ordinary alchemy of the five metals or eight minerals, but a transformation of the Perfected One’s true *qi*. There is no harm in consuming it.\" Su observed the guest, whose clothing was extravagant and befitted a nobleman, yet his speech was coarse and vulgar, lacking refinement. Disliking him, Su wished he would leave quickly, saying, \"Even so, I do not wish to receive it. My age and infirmity make me unfit for hospitality, but I shall have my elder brother’s household attend to you.\" The guest said, \"I came specifically for you. If you do not want the elixir, I shall take it back. But the journey is long, and I would beg a night’s lodging. If the weather clears by dawn, I shall depart; otherwise, I must stay a while longer.\" Unable to refuse, Su had him accommodated in the Pine and Chrysanthemum Cottage. The weather had been dry for a long time, but at the fifth watch, a heavy rain began. Recalling the guest’s words from the previous day, Su felt a pang of regret and hastily sent for him, preparing wine.\n\nBefore they could drink, Su asked, \"May I see the elixir?\" The guest was pleased and drew it from a small basket at his waist, handing it to Su while saying, \"This will extend your life by one *ji*.\" The pill was no larger than a soybean, of a yellowish-purple hue, and not formed into any conventional shape. The guest explained, \"If your illness is severe, take it, and you will soon see its effect. For any ailment of the body, simply reverently focus on the elixir’s power as it moves through you, and you will be cured. Those who consume this will ascend and transcend the world; if worldly desires remain unfinished, it will still prolong your life by one *ji*, and even at the end of that term, you will become an immortal official.\"\n\nAfter several rounds of wine, a servant happened to lead a donkey past them. The guest remarked, \"This donkey was once a man.\" He then commanded it to laugh, and the donkey laughed. He next asked for some *ling* from his green bamboo hat to feed it, and prayed, \"Return to being human.\" Again, he ordered it to laugh, and it laughed once more, astonishing all present.\n\nHe then instructed Su to paint an image of the True Man. Su asked, \"What does he look like?\" The guest replied, \"A figure of divine transcendence, clad in a yellow Daoist robe, striking a black silk whip, wearing *qin* shoes, holding a crystal rosary, and hanging a jade gourd from his right sash. I once encountered him amidst the clouds and mist on the iron bridge of Mount Luofu’s sheer cliffs, and his attire and accessories were exactly thus.\"\n\nWith that, he took his leave, promising to return in five years, adding, \"By then, you will be different from today.\" Su placed the elixir and the inscribed characters into a bamboo container. Before the year had fully passed—just five days remained—he suddenly fell gravely ill. By New Year’s Eve, his breath ceased. His family, finding the top of his head still warm, could not bear to encoffin him.\n\nAt dawn, his sons recalled the previous events. They opened the bamboo container and found the elixir still inside. Taking it, they placed it in his mouth, and he immediately rose, as if entirely free of illness, eating and drinking as before. They again searched for the inscribed characters and the elixir residue to burn and administer, but these were nowhere to be found. Several days later, his eldest son traveled to Jingkou and, following the guest’s description, commissioned a portrait of the yellow-robed figure. When the painting was completed, it bore a striking resemblance to Jiang, and they then realized that Jiang was none other than the Yellow Lord.\n\nThough Su’s hair had turned frost-white, from that point onward, half of it gradually darkened again. Earlier, during the Jianyan era of Emperor Gaozong, he had lost the pupil of his right eye, but now his vision was restored. Tao Anshi of Wuxing, having heard of his reputation, visited him and recorded these events in full.\n\nTwenty years later, he wrote to Xiang Bo of Youlin, saying: \"I have lately heard strange sounds in the night. The immortal of Mount Luofu had promised to meet me again in several years—if my time is to end, let it end; I shall not contest it further.\" In the twelfth month, he traveled to Mount Mao to bid farewell to his Daoist companions. On New Year’s Day, he gathered his clan for a joyous feast that lasted until dawn. Then, donning his robe and leaning on his staff, he stepped outside and declared, \"The Yellow Perfected One has arrived.\" He moved as swiftly as if flying. His servants, rushing in alarm, could only grasp at his sleeves—by then, he had already attained transformation.\n\nBefore his transformation, Hong Qingshan once wrote to request his recent poems. He replied: \"Lately, I obtained an immortal’s elixir from a master of the Dao, snatching my life from the grasp of death’s specter. Since partaking of it, my mind has been fixed on poetry and calligraphy, with no other pursuits remaining.\" Qingshan treasured these words and included them in his records. Tao Anshi’s account is likewise thorough.\n\nFeng Guoguo, a native of Junwu, was precocious in his youth and devoted to his studies. Upon reaching adulthood, he grew weary of worldly concerns and fled his hometown to wander beyond the mundane. There, he encountered an extraordinary figure who taught him the arts of *daoyin* and inner alchemy. Without formal study, he mastered the mysteries of astronomy, geography, fate, fortune, and misfortune. Concealing his name, he styled himself the \"Daoist of No Fixed Abode,\" residing in Yichun for two years, sustaining himself through his arts. His predictions of human fortunes and the shifts of yin and yang invariably proved true. Some mocked his drunken eccentricities, but Guoguo paid them no heed, responding in verse:\n\n*I’ve trod the red dust of four hundred prefectures,*\n*How many winds and moons have been my true companions?*\n*Come dawn, they may laugh at this old mendicant,*\n*For the Dao and oxen share no common path.*\n\nAnother poem expressed his sentiments:\n\n*Adrift in the world’s dust, my heart burns wherever it touches,*\n*Yet hidden within lies the subtle work of immortals.*\n*At my brush’s tip, dragons and serpents coil and writhe;*\n*From my gourd, sun and moon hang suspended.*\n*I feign madness among mortals to blend with the age,*\n*Passing the years with nothing but wine in my cup.*\n*Where does my secret cultivation of merit and conduct lead?*\n*Laughing, I point to Penglai—returning to the grotto-heavens.*\n\nMany more of his poems survive, all transcending the mundane, though few could fathom their meaning.\n\nIn Rui Prefecture’s Shanggao County, a man named Li Xuanqing of Matang once instructed his servant Huang Juan at the eastern gate: \"Tomorrow, rise before dawn and report any unusual activity outside.\" The servant agreed. At daybreak, he opened the gate to find a drunken Daoist fast asleep on a bench, unresponsive to calls. He hurried to inform the household. Xuanqing ordered the Daoist lifted and invited into the study to rest, directing his attendants to provide water for washing. Once refreshed, he summoned the Daoist for an audience, inquiring after his name and origins, but received no reply. The Daoist only demanded more wine, downing vast quantities without measure, then claimed hunger and devoured an endless stream of rice. At the time, Xuanqing’s late wife, née Tang, had recently been interred, and though a hermitage had been prepared, no one had yet taken residence. He led the Daoist to inspect it, and the latter eagerly agreed to stay. Xuanqing furnished him with rice, charcoal, and other supplies, sending him to the hermitage.\n\nThree days later, Xuanqing visited to find the provisions untouched. Even the fire-starter logs he had provided remained as they were. When asked why, the Daoist replied, \"I ate my fill the other day.\" Noting the night’s chill, Xuanqing gave him paper for warmth. The next day, he found the paper torn into four strips, tied with green thatch to the bed’s four legs. When questioned, the Daoist answered, \"The cold rises from below.\"\n\nOne day, after drinking, he suddenly composed a poem:\n\n*North, south, east, west—all is home,*\n*For I know my life belongs to mist and clouds.*\n*All for the love of a single cup of wine,*\n*I’ve missed the blossoms of a thousand peach trees.*\n\nThough his verse was extraordinary, he often performed minor tricks like today’s street magicians and delighted in drunken antics, so people dismissed him as unremarkable. Over time, they learned his surname was Feng, and thus called him \"Mad Feng the Daoist.\"\n\nOne day, Xuanqing’s sons visited the hermitage to sweep the graves but found no trace of the Daoist. Instead, they saw a radiant glow suffusing the tomb. Looking up, they spotted him seated atop a tree, face turned to the heavens, exhaling qi in a descending stream that soon blazed with light. Some said he could draw in the essence of the sun.\n\nFor eighteen years, he resided in the hermitage, often jesting and cavorting with Xuanqing’s sons. At times, his words were crude, or he would overturn his seat, unable to control his bowels or bladder. Such repulsive behavior earned their disdain. One evening, as courtesans entertained the sons at their feast, the Daoist burst in, slightly drunk, and disrupted the gathering. As the guests dispersed, the sons, in jest, offered him a maidservant from the troupe, locking the two in an upper chamber. They planned to check at dawn, but the Daoist had vanished. The maidservant reported that after the door was locked, the room grew scorching hot, unbearable to approach. By midnight, she began to cool, hearing celestial music in the void. Near dawn, the rafters rustled. When she finished speaking, the sons investigated the strange occurrence, looking up to see a couplet inscribed on the beam:\n\n*Water is no mere ditch—only beyond it does the dragon roam;*\n*Wood must be wutong—only then does the phoenix alight.*\n*Do not say your elder brothers have no path to depart—*\n*Beyond the azure clouds lies a ladder to the immortals.*\n\nThe next morning, the former servant Huang Juan encountered the Daoist in the Yuanzhou marketplace. The Daoist said, \"Last night, your young masters mocked me too harshly. By dawn, I had already passed through here, leaving word: if you wish to meet again, come seek me beneath the Yichun Terrace.\" That afternoon, the city buzzed with news of a Daoist who had attained transformation beneath the terrace. Huang Juan went to see—it was Mad Feng—and returned to report to his master.\n\nThis occurred on the fourteenth day of the third month in the thirty-second year of Emperor Gaozong’s Shaoxing reign. Earlier, the Daoist had bid farewell to all his acquaintances, leaving poems to mark his departure. On that day, he sat upright, composed a final hymn, and passed away:\n\n*In life, I had no fixed abode,*\n*Living freely, ever adrift.*\n*Drunkenness was my livelihood,*\n*Heaven and earth my coffin and outer casket.*\n\nAt the time, Li Guanmin of Yizhen, the prefect of Yuanzhou, recognized him as his nephew, originally surnamed Feng, named Guoguo. At eighteen, he had passed the provincial examination but never returned home. Only now was he seen again. The prefect ordered a statue of him erected in the Zhiping Temple east of the city. Xuanqing had a son named Deqian who visited the statue and, patting its back, sighed, \"Daoist, why did you not say a proper farewell before leaving?\"\n\nSuddenly turning his head to look back—even now, the statue remains gazing to the left.\n\nHis master was the Daoist Wang Meng, and his fellow initiate was the Daoist Fang Qi. Their exchanges of poetry and lyrics were numerous.\n\n**Zhao Suoshou**\n\nZhao Suoshou—his given name unknown—was originally a scholar from Puzhou. In his youth, his parents gave him money to purchase books in Chengdu. Midway, he encountered someone from beyond the mundane world and abandoned his home to wander. By the end of Emperor Gaozong’s Shaoxing reign, he was over a hundred years old. He often visited Pengzhou and Hanzhou, walking with both hands tucked before his chest, whence his name. When invited to dine, he would finish whatever was offered, regardless of quantity. He drank anywhere from one cup to a hundred without refusal, yet at times went days without food or drink, ever content. Once, in a drunken state, he recounted in detail Wen Digung’s entry into Shu, with a clear beginning and end. When asked about it another day, he replied, “I know nothing of it.”\n\nHuang Zhongbing had his portrait painted and served him. Fang Wei of Chengdu composed a eulogy:\n\n*Cultivating qi approaches art,*\n*Discoursing on the Dao nears Chan.*\n*Clad in coarse cloth yet holding jade,*\n*His joy is as boundless as heaven.*\n*To leave when he wishes, to stay when he pleases,*\n*Hands withdrawn into his sleeves—*\n*Who could fathom his reasons?*\n\nZhao laughed upon reading it and said, “How can cultivating qi be called an art? Chan and the Dao are one—how could they be two? I withdraw my hands to my chest, not into my sleeves.” Taking up the brush, he added:\n\n*Like a donkey without a load,*\n*Like an ox without horns,*\n*Manjushri and Samantabhadra—*\n*Ever beyond grasp.*\n\nHe also composed a self-eulogy:\n\n*Amid red dust and white clouds,*\n*A fine life for a Daoist.*\n*Idly wandering east and west,*\n*Sometimes half-sober, half-drunk.*\n*Meeting, we laugh heartily—*\n*No barbarian songs or foreign clamor.*\n*Only those of the same Dao would understand,*\n*Yet how many such exist in the world?*\n\nYuan Zhongju of Mianzhu, recovering from a long illness, encountered Zhao passing by his door and invited him in for wine. He asked, “My condition is thus—what would you do, Master?” Zhao did not answer but instead sang a lyric:\n\n*I have a three-room house,*\n*Its pillars eight mountains encircling,*\n*Its four walls the sea’s embrace.*\n*The myriad forms arrayed as beams,*\n*Its roof the azure sky.*\n*Leakless for many years,*\n*Built upon karma’s roots,*\n*Perfected through three thousand meritorious deeds.*\n\nDescending the fire-dragon and taming the tiger,\nA land-bound immortal.\nYuan said, “This was composed by Lü Dongbin. I too have a verse.”\nHe then sang again:\n\n*Lose one room of the house,*\n*Just enough to sustain it—*\n*Let not wind and rain idly bully it.*\n*Seek a belt to secure the path,*\n*Mend it to steadfastness,*\n*Lest others know.*\n*No need for further ado,*\n*Strike while the advantage is yours.*\n*Know the times, yet know the perils within,*\n*Beware danger, penetrate the mysterious pass.*\n*The return path—*\n*Step then upon the cloud-ladder.*\n\nAfter singing, he drained several cups in silence and departed. Zhong Bingzheng accompanied him, slowly asking the reason. Zhao replied, “Observe the meaning of my words, and you shall see.”\n\nTen days later, Tu Zhan died in Shifang County.\n\nLocal custom held that on the first month, they celebrated the birthday of the Perfected Wei. All Daoist followers gathered, and Zhao also lodged at the home of a villager named Xie. The evening before, he told them, “Staying in your home is not convenient. Lend me this couch—I must go somewhere.” At dawn, he went directly to a small temple across the way. There, in an empty room, he sat cross-legged upon the couch. Those nearby, finding his silence strange, drew near to look—he had already transformed. Several thousand attendees rushed to witness, offering incense and reverence.\n\nThree days later, his body was cremated, and his bones remained linked like a chain.\n\n**Kou Zilong of Qingcheng Mountain**\n\nThirty *li* from Qingcheng Mountain lies Mahu Cave, said to be where the Immortal Ma Gu cultivated the Dao. Kou Zilong, a Daoist of Zhangren Abbey, went alone to pay his respects. Midway, he encountered several village women carrying radishes down from the mountain. They set down their baskets, lifted their skirts, and washed their feet and vegetables in a clear spring by the road. Seeing Kou arrive, one asked, “Where is your master going?” He replied, “To visit Ma Gu.” A woman laughed and said, “The Maiden is not on the mountain today—no need to go.” She then handed Kou a radish, saying, “Eat this.” Kou ate it and continued on his way, musing to himself, “These are all ignorant village women—how would they know who Ma Gu is? Could they be mocking me?” Suddenly, as if awakened, he turned to look—no one was there.\n\nFrom then on, his spirit was clear and his *qi* whole; he aged without illness.\n\nEach time he performed rituals or offered prayers, he styled himself as the Fire Department Minister of the Celestial Bureaucracy. Having lived past a hundred years, he ascended in transcendence during the *Longxing* era of Emperor Xiaozong of the Song.\n\nMaster Fu’s personal name was *De Yi* (Virtue-Unity), his courtesy name *Ning Dao* (Peaceful Dao), and his alternate name *Qi Xian* (Equal Worth). He was a native of Xin’gan in Qingjiang, of the Fu clan. His father, whose given name is now lost, was deeply devoted to the Daoist arts, as was his mother, née Lu, both of whom lived with reclusive integrity. Hearing that on the southern slopes of their district stood the altar of Master Liu the Immortal of National Protection, where many numinous wonders occurred, and that an immortal dwelled hidden in those mountains, they secretly admired the place. Thus, they chose to settle at the mountain’s foot.\n\nOn the night of the waxing moon in the ninth month of the fifth year of *Zhenghe* (1115) during the reign of Emperor Huizong of the Song, a crimson radiance suddenly illuminated their distant dwelling, startling the neighbors, who marveled at the sight. The following day, the Master was born. Before a month had passed, his movements and expressions already bore the precocity of a child far older. At eleven, he lost his father. A local official, Magistrate Yan, took pity on his youthful orphanhood and took him into his home.\n\nThat year, on his birthday, the Master went to pay homage to Master Liu the Immortal. On his return, halfway up the mountain, he saw six Daoist adepts playing *weiqi* amid a grove of lush bamboo, drinking from a flat boulder. Wishing to observe, he wandered about but could find no path to approach. Suddenly, an elder turned and pointed the way, allowing him to reach the stone’s side. After a moment, the same elder handed him a *zhu* fruit, commanding sternly, “You must not drink the wine.” The Master assented, took the fruit, and bit into it—its taste was bitter and astringent, inedible. He tucked it into his sleeve and returned home.\n\nAfter traveling a *li* or so, he cast the fruit by the roadside. His family, alarmed by his prolonged absence, sent someone to search for him. He was found only after a full night had passed. When questioned, he recounted all that had occurred. His family and curious neighbors, astonished, followed him up the mountain, bidding him point out the place. Yet all they saw were brambles and overgrowth—no trace of the earlier scene remained. Returning to the spot where he had discarded the *zhu* fruit, it was already dusk, and a brilliant red glow shone forth. Believing a treasure trove had been uncovered, people rushed forward to claim it, but the light soon vanished, leaving only a lingering, fragrant scent.\n\nThe Master said, “The Daoist who gave me the *zhu* fruit must still be here.” He retrieved and ate it again, finding the taste even more bitter. He threw it down once more and departed. From that moment, his spirit and *qi* felt refreshed, his steps light as flight. He gained the ability to foresee fortune and misfortune. Though his home lay ten *li* from the town, he would often make the round trip ten times in a single day. His speech was wild and strange, his laughter and singing uninhibited. Sometimes he wore flowers on his head, or lay drunk on a bridge, leaving others baffled. Some townsfolk despised him and, offering poisoned wine, pushed him into the river beneath the county bridge. The Master drifted with the current for over two *li* before emerging on the bank and re-entering the market. Smiling, he said to his would-be murderer, “Why play such a cruel joke?” People began to marvel at his strangeness. When tested repeatedly thereafter, the same invulnerability manifested.\n\nThe crowd was astonished and convinced, hailing him as Master Fu the Immortal. At eighteen, the Master suddenly felt the call of rivers and lakes, donning a straw cloak and hat, shouldering a gourd and sack, and wandering through Huguang, Huaizhe, and beyond. He traversed every sacred mountain and blessed land, sometimes dwelling alone in rocky valleys, other times sleeping beneath the open sky by overgrown shrines. Wherever he went, he behaved with unbridled abandon, free from restraint. As in Xin’gan, people still called him a mad scholar. Yet his predictions of others’ fortune and misfortune invariably came true, and the scholar-officials grew ever more intrigued by him.\n\nWhen Zhang Weigong Jun served as defender of Jiankang, he summoned the Master for conversation and immediately granted him special favor. Chancellor Shi Gong Hao once presented the Master with a poem:\n\n*\"I ask where this journey will end—*\n*In the land of Wu-you, no fixed abode.*\n*Drunk, he knows not; sober, he feigns folly—*\n*Who among the world recognizes this Daoist sage?\"*\n\nLater, he gifted another poem:\n\n*\"We’ve known each other thirty years,*\n*His body mad, his heart not so.*\n*Whoever truly understands*\n*Is an earth-treading immortal.\"*\n\nThereafter, the gifts multiplied.\n\nEarlier, before Prince Shi of Yue had risen to power, he once feasted with fellow officials of the same ministry. The Master happened upon them, and amid the gathering, he suddenly called out to the prince: *\"Master Fu alone foretells that on such-and-such a year, month, and day, you will become chancellor. When that day comes, pray do not forget me.\"* Later, the prince indeed assumed the chancellorship as predicted. One day, the Master arrived at the palace gates, and the prince immediately invited him to the seat of honor, pouring him wine. From then on, they came and went without restraint.\n\nOne day, the Master arrived utterly drunk, stumbling into the palace. He promptly stepped into the chancellor’s shoes with muddy feet, mimed holding a tablet, and looked around in exaggerated alarm. The prince asked what he wanted, and the Master replied, *\"I need a crane-feather cloak.\"* The prince understood his meaning and agreed. Coincidentally, Yang Hezheng arrived for an audience, and the prince recommended him. That very night, Hezheng dreamed of a strange figure visiting him. The next day, the prince summoned him, and upon seeing him, Hezheng found his appearance exactly as in the dream. Delighted, the prince conversed with him and immediately bestowed upon him an imperial commission, a robe, and an official title. Thus, he was honored with the rank of *Guanxia*.\n\nZu Qingzhang served as the Master’s attendant at Changqing Abbey in Wukang County, Huzhou. The abbey had been built by a prince. One day, he presented his ordination certificate to Hezheng and said, *\"Wild cranes and lone clouds—my mad nature stirs again. I cannot bear the eastern bonds; I take my leave from here.\"* Hezheng laughed heartily and sent a letter to the abbey, stating that as the Master was a free spirit, he should be governed by no rules. A month later, he sent fine wine. Soon after, the Master brushed off his sleeves and departed. The prince dispatched a blue palanquin with relics and offerings, catching up to him on the road, but the Master accepted nothing. He returned directly to Qingjiang.\n\nAt the time, Magistrate Wu of Yanling, hearing the Master’s name for long, was overjoyed at their first meeting and treated him with the reverence due a teacher, his entire household following suit. The Master refused to stay, so Wu pressed him to reside at Yunsun Mountain’s Chengtian Palace. The deputy post was not to his liking. Before long, he was invited to oversee the Chongzhen Abbey on Hezao Mountain. Within a month, Grand Master Zhu invited him to administer the Yulong Wanshou Abbey. Later, Minister Shen of Xianmo, then governing Yuzhang, along with Transport Commissioner Lu, a Vice Minister, and Academician Ren of the Bureau of Rites, transferred him to oversee the Tiezhu Yanzhen Abbey.\n\nIn the ninth year of the Qiandao era [1173], the renchen year, Master Zhu Xi of Hui’an inscribed the characters for *\"Cloud Hermitage\"* and presented a quatrain:\n\n*Wherever you go, people speak of Madman Fu,*\n*Gazing at each other, we know from lives past.*\n*Straightaway you lift the Northern Dipper to pour the Milky Way,*\n*And depart to become the Dragon Palace’s second immortal.*\n\nThereafter, Grand Master Fan of Shihu and Minister Zhang of the Bureau of Military Affairs gathered many worthies to compose tributes—too numerous to record.\n\nIn the first year of the Chunxi era [1174], the jiayin year, Prince Shi of Yue governed Min. One day, the Master suddenly called his disciple Ye Yongshou and said, *\"I wish to visit the chancellor in Fuzhou.\"* The next morning, he set off. At the time, portraits were being painted to solicit inscriptions. The prince stood before him, the Master beside him, and he readily agreed to the request, writing in the prefectural hall of Sanshan. He stayed for several months, and the prince memorialized the throne on his behalf at Deshou Hall. In the fourth month of that year, an imperial edict summoned him. From Hongdu to the imperial residence, the journey took no more than three days—though Sanshan lay nearly two thousand *li* from the capital. The Master personally attended the inner palace, where he was granted a vegetarian feast, silver, silk, an imperial fan inscribed with sacred script, and the ordination certificate of a *Lingbao* Grand Master. On the fifteenth of that month, he submitted a memorial of gratitude.\n\nDespite this extraordinary encounter, the Master remained unmoved. Soon after, he took his leave and resided at Yanzhen Abbey for twenty years. His judgments of people were invariably apt. When Grand Academician Han led the forces of Jiangxia or Vice Minister Li oversaw the transport of Jiangxi, he foretold their appointments in advance—such instances of prescience were many. Letters sent from Qiantang to the Master in Qingjiang arrived in three days. Sometimes, he would answer the summons of several households in a single day, all arriving simultaneously. People said he had mastered Fei Zhangfang’s art of shrinking distances and Ji Zixun’s technique of bilocation—though none knew if this were truly so.\n\nThe Master’s nature was open and unconstrained; he kept his distance from worldly affairs. Though he repeatedly held distinguished positions, he merely filled the office. Often he passed nights without sleep, sometimes sitting in silence for a month without emerging. Though his conduct was wild and reckless, his aspirations were pure. Entering the gates of high officials, he always urged them to do good and cherish themselves—people respected him for this.\n\nOn the twenty-second day of the eleventh month in the fifteenth year of the Chunxi era [1188], the wushen year, he called his disciples, entrusted them with final instructions, and took up his brush to compose a verse:\n\n*All my life, my courage and spirit were lofty,*\n*Embracing the Dao, I found lasting joy in freedom.*\n*Heaven and earth, yin and yang turn and overturn—*\n*Clouds gather, mists roll back, the cinnabar sky revealed.*\n\nThe verse finished, he cast aside his brush and passed away at the age of seventy-four. The following year, on the renyin day of the first month, his disciples and followers interred his remains on Zhusha Ridge outside the eastern gate of the prefecture. Over a thousand attended the funeral.\n\nXie Guan later wrote a postscript: *\"At first, when the Master was born, people said he was conceived without pregnancy, and his mother believed it. Yet consulting the biographies of immortals, even transcendent beings descending to the world, though they assume mortal form, must still rely on the qi of yin and yang and the nurturing of the Three Primes to shape this corporeal frame. Thus, before the Primordial One’s birth, the essence of the sun descended into the Mysterious Womb; before Gautama’s arrival, Queen Maya dreamed of a white elephant. Never has there been one not conceived who was born. If he were a rare being, incarnated in the world, his mother’s unawareness might be possible. Thus, Laozi lived eighty-one years, and the Primordial Lady did not notice their length; Duke Zhuang was born in a breach, and Lady Jiang doubted he was her child. The Master’s way of conducting himself and responding to things owed nothing to learned teachings or transmitted instruction—his attainments surely arose from this.*\n\n*I once heard Xu Cuo’s poem:*\n*Before the garden’s flowers, it is a land of drunkenness,*\n*Tossing back nine goblets of rosy clouds with Mother Alchemy.*\n*The immortals point and scorn him as frivolous,*\n*Exiled to the human world to play the madman with wine.*\n\n*The Master was perhaps his equal. Otherwise, why would the old immortal sternly warn him against drinking, fearing his wild nature would resurface?\"*\n\nMagistrate Xie, who had once been close to the Master, recorded these broad strokes. Later gentlemen seeking fuller details may consult the epitaph written by Prince Shi of Yue.\n\nZhang Zongyuan was a native of Bazhou in Hebei.\n\nAmidst the peaks of Qingcheng’s Great Face Mountain, upon the Purple Mulberry Ridge, he built a thatched hut, steadfast in his resolve. For fifty years he dwelt in the mountains, without attendant or servant, often sharing his abode with tigers, leopards, snakes, and vipers, yet remaining untroubled by harm. On the twenty-ninth day of the eighth month in the fourteenth year of the Chunxi reign of Emperor Xiaozong of the Song, he passed without illness.\n\n*The fourth fascicle of the Continuation of the Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao concludes here.*\n\n*The fifth fascicle of the Continuation of the Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao begins.*\n\n**Perfected Lord Zhang Daoqing**\nThe Perfected Lord’s surname was Zhang, his given name Daoqing, and his courtesy name Deyi. He was a native of Pusao Village. His mother, née Wang, conceived after dreaming an extraordinary dream. On the twentieth day of the fifth month in the sixth year of the Shaoxing reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Song, a bing-chen year, the Perfected Lord was born in the thatched cottage of Green Ox Mountain. At the time, purple qi soared into the sky, and all near and far regarded it as a marvel.\n\nIn his youth, he served under the tutelage of Lady Xi and later moved with her to Jingshan in Ying. Even as a child, his bearing was serene and pure; he abstained from meat and wine, and grasped the principles of life, death, fortune, and misfortune. Sometimes he would go days without eating. Once, he entered the mountains and did not return for half a month. When his family went to search for him, they found him lying in a ravine, with two tigers crouched beside him. The villagers were astonished and revered him as divine.\n\nAnother time, upon waking from sleep, he told his mother: “Just now, I visited the home of my elder sister Hao in Fuzhou Village and have only just returned. My eldest sister promised to bring silk slippers and fruit as offerings.” The next day, it came to pass exactly as he had said. From then on, his parents also believed in his divine and extraordinary nature.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the first lunar month in the twenty-seventh year, the Perfected Lord sat in silent meditation upon the front mountain when he beheld five-colored clouds drifting in the sky, surrounded by a host of ten thousand spirits standing guard. At their center sat the Celestial Lord upon a dragon chariot, who summoned the Perfected Lord and bestowed upon him secret talismans and sacred scriptures. Having received these, the Perfected Lord’s Daoist prestige began to flourish. Later, a shrine was erected on that very site to commemorate the place where he received the Dao, and it was named \"Imperial Bestowal.\" Thereafter, whenever the countryside suffered from drought or flooding, prayers offered there were invariably answered. Those afflicted with illness were instantly cured by his talismanic water. Thus, the people of Jing and Han came to revere and admire him in great numbers.\n\nIn the first year of the Qiandao era of Emperor Xiaozong, he donated his residence to be converted into a shrine, where an image of the Jade Emperor was enshrined and venerated as the Guang Temple. The emperor personally inscribed the name \"Changsen Bay,\" and it is now known as the Wansui Abbey. In the second year, the Perfected Lord, wearing a simple headscarf and carrying a staff of flowering wood, toured the famous mountains of Xiang and Han. Arriving at Hong Mountain, he visited the abbot of the main temple, the elder monk Mu, and together they discoursed on the mysteries of the quiescent Dao. Delighted by Mu’s wisdom and meditative steadfastness, the Perfected Lord donated all the gold and silk he had received from his hometown to the temple.\n\nIn the eighth year, when Suizhou suffered from drought and prayers for rain went unanswered, Monk Mu informed the prefecture of the Perfected Lord’s divine efficacy. The prefecture dispatched an official to Changsen Bay to pay respects and invite the Perfected Lord. Upon arriving in the prefecture, the Perfected Lord merely wrote the \"Heaven-Bestowed Divine Chapter\" on a sheet of paper and burned it, whereupon sweet rain fell at once. The officials and common people, moved by gratitude, wished to establish a perpetual incense shrine in his honor. The Perfected Lord declined and returned to Hong Mountain. Monk Mu said to him: \"The Dao is fundamentally one, yet its teachings diverge into three. I hope you will not abandon this mountain and will continue to uphold the Buddhist Dharma.\" The Perfected Lord replied: \"Coming and going each follow their destined path. Yesterday, I received a decree from the Jade Emperor, which stated that the site for establishing a sacred incense hall lies within the celestial region of Dou and Niu, connected to Mount Lu and Mount Huo, and that it would flourish upon encountering the number nine. The mandate of Heaven cannot be defied.\" He then bid farewell to Monk Mu and returned to reside at Changsen Bay.\n\nIn the first month of the seventh year of the Chunxi era, the Perfected Lord traveled to Longhu Mountain to pay homage to the Celestial Master and received the *Great Cavern Register of Supreme Clarity* before returning. In the fourth year, a monk named Zuchao arrived from Guoqing Temple on Mount Tiantai, entreating the master to journey there and recount past events. The assembly of monks marveled at his spiritual insight. Upon the Perfected Lord’s return to Ying, the people of Pulao Village, increasingly drawn to his divine efficacy, donated funds and land. On the site of his former retreat at Green Ox Mountain, they erected a shrine to enshrine his incense altar, which is now the Chongning Wanshou Abbey.\n\nIn the tenth year, the Perfected Lord journeyed to the capital. At that time, Emperor Guangzong was still heir apparent, and the Princess of Qi’an fell gravely ill. The Empress Dowager Ciyí sighed, saying: \"If only Master Zhang could come, this illness might be cured.\" Yet the distance was great, and his arrival could not be hastened. Coincidentally, the imperial guard Li brought the Perfected Lord to the palace. Upon hearing of his presence, the Eastern Palace issued a summons. The Perfected Lord presented jujube and water, which the princess drank, and she revived at once. Emperor Guangzong exclaimed: \"Truly divine!\" He bestowed lavish gifts, which the Perfected Lord declined, accepting instead a personal inscription of the characters \"True Shepherd\" carved upon an ivory tablet. Thereafter, he was frequently summoned, and his courtesy was ever increased. The Perfected Lord remained indifferent and unassuming, answering only when questioned. One day, during an audience, the emperor inquired about his place of residence. He replied: \"Changsen Bay in Yingzhou.\" The emperor then personally inscribed \"Changsen Bay\" and bestowed it upon him.\n\nIn the eleventh year, the Perfected Lord departed the capital and returned to his former retreat, where he saved countless lives. Observing that the shrine at Changsen Bay was too cramped to do justice to the imperial calligraphy, he commanded his disciple Yang Zonghua and others to renovate and expand it. Upon its completion, he addressed the assembly, saying: \"Long ago, I received a secret decree from the Jade Emperor to establish a Daoist sanctuary in a place of exceptional spiritual energy. The appointed site has awaited me for some time, and I must now set forth.\" He then journeyed from Ying into Shu, traversing the Jian and Jing regions, sailing across Dongting Lake, and descending the Pengli Marshes.\n\nIn the spring of the fourteenth year, as he passed through Mount Kanglu, an immortal elder greeted him on the road, saying: \"I have secluded myself in the Nine Palaces, and though I have come from afar to pay my respects, I hope you will soon visit that mountain, that our kind may find refuge there.\" The Perfected Lord assented. Proceeding from Fuchuan, he ascended to Tongyang and lodged at a monastic retreat in Shan Keng. That evening, an elder of the village, Zhang Zhen, dreamed of a divine figure in yellow robes riding a white horse, who entered his dwelling. The following day, when the Perfected Lord arrived, Zhang Zhen was astonished and received him with utmost reverence. The Perfected Lord told him: \"The sacred altar of the Nine Palaces has long lain in ruins. I shall restore its foundation as a place of prayer for the nation.\" He then climbed the mountain, grasping vines as he ascended for several dozen *li*, until he reached a plateau of several dozen *mu* at its summit—the very site recorded in the local gazetteer as the Level Pot Terrace.\n\nAs dusk fell, he took lodging upon the mountain and sat cross-legged beneath a pine tree. At midnight, the mountain spirits cried out in joy, startling his attendants. The Perfected Lord said: \"The mountain spirits are merely expressing their delight.\" Soon after, marvels appeared: a red serpent and a divine dragon. At dawn, his attendants complained of hunger. The Perfected Lord, just awakening from meditation, drew vegetarian cakes from his sleeve, giving one to each. They were fragrant and still warm. Upon eating, all were sated.\n\nThereupon, he oriented the site toward *zi* and *gan* beneath the Level Pot Terrace, marking out the Daoist sanctuary. Then he declared: \"I shall return to Changsen for now, but will come again in autumn.\" He transmitted talismanic methods to his disciple Yang Zonghua, instructing him to go ahead and clear the land, build thatched huts for temporary lodging, and prepare for their stay.\n\nIn the fifteenth year of the cycle, the year *wushen* (1188), the Perfected Lord arrived. The seven assemblies welcomed him into the mountain, and people from all directions—those afflicted with illness seeking peace—gathered like clouds, their prayers answered as soon as they were uttered. The poor contributed labor, while the wealthy offered wealth. Soon after, the Perfected Lord’s numinous manifestations were many, and the Nine Palaces’ construction was completed in no time.\n\nIn the first year of Shaoxi (1190) of Emperor Guangzong’s reign, a summons was issued, but he did not go. The emperor dispatched envoys to present incense, candles, brocade banners, and silver tablets into the mountain, where a grand state *jiao* ritual was held to invoke blessings for the people. While still heir apparent, Emperor Ningzong had also bestowed generous gifts. Shortly after, an imperial decree renamed the hermitage the Qintian Abbey.\n\nIn the first year of Qingyuan (1195), Emperor Ningzong ascended the throne. The Empress Ciyi, residing in the inner palace, sent envoys into the mountain each year with abundant offerings. In the third year, the Perfected Lord returned to Changsen. In the fifth year, the emperor bestowed upon him the title *Zhenmu Zhenren* (Perfected Lord of True Pastorship). In the fourth year of Jiatai (1204), Emperor Ningzong personally inscribed the six characters *Qintian Ruijing Zhi Gong* (Auspicious Abbey of Celestial Favor) and ordered the Directorate of Palace Maintenance to renovate it. The abbey was expanded into a palace, and lavish gifts were bestowed. In the sixth month, the emperor further elevated his title to *Taiping Huguo Zhenmu Zhenren* (Perfected Lord of True Pastorship, Protector of Peace and the State).\n\nIn the second year of Kaixi (1206), an edict ordered the Jiangxi Fiscal Commission to allocate unused fields, and Empress Ciming donated funds to establish estates to support the Daoist community. Repeated special decrees exempted them from corvée labor and taxes. That year, when the northern invaders raided the western capital, Changsen lay squarely in their path. As the enemy entered the region, the Daoist followers fled in panic. The Perfected Lord, however, sat serenely in the hall, and the invaders dared not harm him. When they set fire to the shrine, the flames extinguished themselves. Struck with awe, they exclaimed: \"This is a perfected immortal of the Southern Court!\"\n\nIn the third year, at the beginning of summer, the Perfected Lord returned once more to Changsen. The disciples of the Nine Palaces also came to pay their respects and, fulfilling their vows, entreated him to return to the Nine Palaces. The Perfected Lord replied: \"My comings and goings are not for you to know. I established the Nine Palaces sanctuary by heavenly mandate, to safeguard the state and secure the household, and to gather and settle the Daoist community. You must set your hearts on advancing in the Dao and not worry over my absence.\"\n\nOn the fifth day of the seventh month, the Perfected Lord struck the drum and ascended his seat. Addressing the assembly, he said: \"Life and death are but a single day and night; going forth and returning are but a single heaven and earth. Since traversing kalpas past, I have emerged in response to the times, delivering beings according to their thoughts. Though my body dwells in the dust of the world, my name is inscribed in the registers of immortals. Now I shall depart—vast and boundless, with nothing to encumber me. Each of you must uphold the precepts, follow the rules, and walk the path, so as to uphold the teachings and repay your sovereign and parents.\"\n\nThen he called for paper and wrote a verse:\n*An illusory form, a fleeting fragrance in the dust—*\n*Just passing through sixty years.*\n*Pitying all sentient beings,*\n*Like the thirsty rushing to water.*\n*Wearing through iron shoes in search,*\n*Only to find the track at the sole’s end.*\n\nIn a single instant, the myriad currents ceased.\n\nLooking up, bathed in imperial grace, one might call this a perfect beginning and end. Today, I escape this form, serene and free from its sheath.\n\n*Hmm—*\n*I recall the path I came by,*\n*Riding those white clouds back to the Emperor’s realm.*\n\nWith the verse complete, he sat upright in solemn dignity and shed his mortal coil.\n\nA memorial was submitted, and the Ning Emperor inscribed his decree:\n*\"Zhang Daoqing, True Shepherd of Peace and Protector of the Realm, cultivated clarity and emptiness, his Dao-conduct lofty and pure. Favored by the former court with utmost generosity, his prayers for rain and sunshine repeatedly met with divine response. Now that he has ascended as a feathered immortal, We grieve deeply. Let funds be drawn from the inner treasury to dispatch his disciples to Changsen Bay, where they shall escort his remains to the Nine Palaces for reverent enshrinement. The overseer of the Nine Palaces shall select an auspicious site within the sacred precinct for his interment, ensuring no negligence. No local obstruction shall be permitted. This is to be entrusted to the Qintian Ruijing Abbey. Thus decreed.\"*\n\nA subsequent imperial edict was issued:\n*\"To the Jiangxi Transport Bureau: Commission Director Zhao Longtu to supervise the relocation. Expedite the return, ensuring strict adherence by the disciples, who shall proceed to Changsen Bay to escort his remains with due honor and inter them in the stupa on an auspicious day.\"*\n\nSuddenly, the True Lord’s spirit possessed a child and declared:\n*\"Now that my spirit returns to the celestial palace, why bury this discarded form? Yet out of pity for the faithful who have come from afar with no means to pay their respects, let a hall be established for his veneration, where his true likeness shall remain.\"*\n\nIn the third year of Jiading, the Ning Emperor bestowed the calligraphic inscription *\"True Shepherd Hall\"* upon him, which was engraved on a plaque. When Emperor Lizong ascended the throne, his favor only deepened. In the fourth year of Shaoding, Zhang was posthumously enfeoffed as *\"True Shepherd of Universal Response,\"* his miracles and the emperor’s profound grace detailed in *The Complete Biography of the True Lord of Nine Palaces Mountain.*\n\n---\n\n**Master Xie Shouyu**\n\nMaster Xie, whose given name was Shouxie and courtesy name Huaiying, was a native of Yongjia. Born in the fourth year of Shaoxing during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of Song—on the twenty-second day of the third month in the year of jiayin, at the hour of noon—he displayed exceptional intelligence and acuity from childhood. In his youth, he devoted himself to learning with unwavering resolve.\n\nOne day, a wandering Daoist visited his study. The Daoist introduced himself as *\"Master Jielü.\"* After exchanging bows and taking their seats, the master withdrew to prepare tea. The Daoist nodded approvingly and remarked: *\"Ah! An ancient scholar of divine immortals!\"*\n\nAs they sat, the master fell silent, as if awakened. From that day forth, he absorbed all the classics, histories, and philosophical works without omission. Diligent in Confucian studies, his talent was vast and comprehensive. In his youth, he entered the imperial academy, later serving as a tutor in the household of Minister Cao Zhongjing.\n\nAt the time, the Pure Void Sovereign, Huangfu the True Person, enjoyed the emperor’s favor and was frequently summoned to discourse on the Dao. Minister Cao, grateful for the True Person’s past kindness in ferrying him across the Yellow River, often hosted him at his home. Admiring the True Person’s virtue, the master doffed his Confucian cap, bowed in reverence, and became his disciple, joining the ranks of the feathered immortals.\n\nThe True Person first transmitted his teachings to Cao Mitan, then to the master as his foremost disciple. Well-versed and retentive, the master’s discourses were grand and eloquent. When comparing the Three Teachings, he often favored Daoism over Buddhism, though some questioned his emphasis. The master would say: *\"The Confucians declare, ‘Those who can refute Yang and Mo are the disciples of sages.’ I say the same of Daoism.\"*\n\nOne day, a scholar—brilliant, learned, and devoted to Buddhism—asked him: *\"Which of the Three Teachings is superior?\"* The master replied: *\"There is no second Way under heaven; the ten thousand differences share a single origin. The supreme principle is luminously clear—what doubt remains?\"* Well-versed in classics and history, his words were always grounded, his eloquence like a cascading river—none could refute him.\n\nAnother challenger once said: *\"‘To believe everything in books is worse than having no books at all.’\"* The master retorted: *\"If even the classics and histories cannot be trusted, can your words be trusted?\"* The man fell silent, bowed in admiration, and departed.\n\nIn the thirteenth year of Chunxi during Emperor Xiaozong’s reign, the Jiangxi transport commissioner petitioned for him to serve as abbot of Xishan’s Yulong Wanshou Abbey. At the beginning of Emperor Guangzong’s Shaoxi era, the court bestowed upon him the title *\"Great Master of Observing Revival\"* and appointed him to oversee the Gaoshi of the imperial Shouning Abbey.\n\nThe master delved into the Three Teachings, the various philosophers, and the hundred schools, compiling *The Veritable Records of the Supreme Venerable Lord, the Primordial August Emperor of the Dao* in seven fascicles. Presented to the throne, it circulated widely. His profound scholarship and erudition resonated throughout the court and the realm.\n\nIn the fourth year of Shaoxi, he was reappointed abbot of Yulong Wanshou Abbey. In the first year of Jiatai during Emperor Ningzong’s reign, he was again entrusted with the governance of the abbey’s ritual affairs. Ascending the scripture platform, he expounded the subtleties of the Dao, guiding the Three Teachings with consummate skill. When eminent figures posed questions, his responses were instantaneous. He also borrowed temple halls to deliver sermons, earning the admiration of Chan masters.\n\nThe master had traveled extensively across rivers and seas, visiting renowned mountains. He once encountered an perfected one who bestowed upon him *The Stone Casket Record of Jingyang*, deepening his mastery of the principles of the Golden Elixir. Within, he nurtured his true nature; without, he blended with the world—none knew his depth.\n\nDuring the reigns of Emperors Guangzong and Ningzong, he enjoyed exceptional imperial favor. His friends were the great worthies of the age—unmatched in their loftiness, none could compare. In his later years, his appearance grew refined and ancient, his beard and hair snowy white. People said he was the living Laozi reborn.\n\nIn his leisure, he sat in quietude, burning incense and reciting scriptures. Upon reviewing his own *Veritable Records of the Primordial August Emperor*, he struck the table and sighed: *\"Those who understand me will do so through this book; those who condemn me will do so through this book.\"*\n\nWhen his disciples sought further instruction, he said: *\"My aim is to cultivate literature and uphold the teachings, to clarify right and wrong. My stance is firm—my words unchanging. Let posterity’s praise or blame fall where it may.\"*\n\nIn his advanced years, his complexion remained radiant and lustrous, his hearing and vision keen. On quiet nights, he would sit by lamplight deciphering texts, even the finest of small characters. Once, he took his esoteric work *The Stone Casket Record*—this piece titled *On the Symbolism of the Golden Elixir*—and, finding a later supplement to it full of erroneous methods that might mislead students, inscribed its characters like grains of millet upon silver leaves. These he concealed within a mountain cavern, awaiting one whose bone structure marked him as destined for immortality.\n\nIn his later years, he again departed to establish a temple on Purple Florescence Peak in Rui’an County of Yongjia Prefecture. He petitioned the court for its name, and it was granted as the Nine Stars Palace—this being the very place where the master had once purified himself. He lived in this world for seventy-nine years. On the nineteenth night of the second month in the fifth year of Emperor Ningzong’s Jiading reign (the year *renshen*), he suddenly dreamed of heavenly beings descending, who addressed him: *\"The Supreme Lord has issued a decree, summoning you to compile the *Veritable Records of the Perfected Immortals*.\"* The following day at noon, he prepared incense and bathed, then took leave of his fellow Daoists. He wrote this verse:\n\n*\"The Maker is but the host of an inn of passage,\nHeaven and earth—one lotus hut.\"*\n\nReturning to you what you possessed at birth,\nReturning to me what I lacked before birth.\nThe verse complete, he straightened his robes and cap, sat upright, and passed away in an instant.\n\nLater, his disciples privately bestowed upon him the posthumous title *Master of Cultivating Literature and Assisting the Teachings at the Abbey of Renewed Learning*.\n\n**Ancestral Primordial Lady**\nThe Primordial Lady’s surname was Zu, her given name Shu, and she was also called Suidào, with the courtesy name Fangzhong. A native of Qiyang County in Yongzhou, Lingling Prefecture of Guangxi during the Tang Dynasty, she was an incarnation of the Moon Comet, born on the ninth day of the ninth month. Her complexion was dark, her eyes large and round, her teeth exposed, and her hair thick and unkempt, held in place by a bamboo-twig hairpin. Her hands and feet were black and hairy, her stature seven feet tall, and she lived to the age of one hundred thirty-two.\n\nFrom childhood, she maintained her integrity and was spiritually gifted. Resolute in her pursuit of the Dao, her parents could not restrain her. She roamed famous mountains, studying under Master Xu the Perfected, Master Zheng the Realized, and the Sacred Mother of Numinous Radiance. One day, at the Divine Transformation Stream in the Cavern of Pure Emptiness in the Western Capital, she encountered the Supreme Mystery Lady descending upon the stream’s bank and became her disciple. Together, they entered the cavern for several days, where the Lady manifested as both man and woman, subjecting her to myriad trials. Yet her resolve never wavered, and so she was transmitted the Great Dao of the Primordial Beginning. The Lady instructed her to ride a withered log, drifting with the current wherever it led. After a short while, the log returned to its original place, and the Supreme Mystery Lady had vanished.\n\nThus, unifying the Four Directions into One, she was appointed to the exalted rank of Attendant of the Celestial Throne in the Qingwei Yuan Shang. She then manifested herself as the Illuminating Sovereign of Qingwei Inspection, also known as the Radiant Sovereign of Universal Transformation, commanding the thunder and lightning. Her forms were manifold: at times, she wore a red kerchief and bare-armed vest, barefoot with legs exposed, her awe-inspiring might unmatched; at others, she sat upon a rock with sword in hand, whistling to summon wind and thunder; or she rode a dragon, wielding a sword to command the myriad spirits; or she appeared in golden crown and white robes, presiding over the cavern palaces with solemn dignity. Fierce in temper and strict in command, even the Thunder Gods deferred to her discipline. After achieving transcendence, she ascended to the Golden Portal’s Zhao Ning Palace, governing the Qingwei Dong Zhao Prefecture. She also presided over the Golden Portal’s Zhong Ling Ning Zhao Prefecture, upholding the teachings to bestow grace upon living beings. Those who inherited her Dao passed it down in an unbroken lineage: the Jade Chamber’s Dong Qing Guo Yuanjun, the Blessed Harmony’s Yao Zhen Fu Yuanjun, the Dragon Radiance Dao, the Illuminating Yao Yuanjun, the Purple Essence’s Jade Grace Gao Yuanjun, the Meritorious Primordial Numinous Qingxu Hua Zhenren, the Qingcheng Mountain’s Tonghui Zhu Zhenren, the Yunshan Mountain’s Baoyi Li Zhenren, and the Meishan Mountain’s Hunyin Nan Zhenren—through whom the Qingwei Daoist teachings flourished anew.\n\n**Fire Master Wang Zhenjun**\nZhenjun’s surname was Wang, given name Zihua, courtesy name Shimei. Born in the second year of Tang Xuanzong’s reign (Jia Yin, 714) in Ruyang County, Caizhou, at forty, having failed the imperial examinations thrice, he sighed, “Having passed the age of uncertainty without attaining office, how can I face my peers? I shall study the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi and serve in the Celestial Realm.” He then became a disciple of Baiyun Master Zhang Yue alongside Yan Zhenqing, later studying under Chicheng Master Sima Chengzhen. During the An Lushan Rebellion, he abandoned his home and wandered as a cloud. At the foot of Mount Heng’s Zhurong Peak, he cultivated the Dao for nine years without descending. When Zhenqing was framed by Lu Qi and sent to Huaixi to be strangled by Li Xilie, Zhenjun encountered the Purple Void Yuanjun, who personally visited Mount Heng and transmitted to him the Supreme Dao. After cultivating for another twenty years, his elixir was perfected, and his Dao complete. On the seventh day of the first month in the fifth year of Zhenyuan (Geng Wu, 789), he ascended to heaven in broad daylight by imperial decree.\n\n**Yellow Thunder Abyss**\nThe Zhenren’s surname was Huang, given name Shunshen, a native of Jianning, Fujian. From childhood, he was exceptionally intelligent, mastering the Three Teachings and Nine Schools without exception. While serving in Guangxi, the provincial governor Nan saw him as extraordinary and entrusted him with sacred texts. The Zhenren delved into their mysteries, compiling a comprehensive collection, and scholars flocked to his door like clouds. Later, summoned by imperial edict to court, he was permitted to return to the mountains, where he secluded himself upon the Purple Mist’s Cangzhou, bestowed the title of Dan Mountain’s Thunder Abyss Guangfu Puhua Zhenren. Those he initiated as disciples had their names inscribed on stone. Thirty were recorded before the stele’s erection, and only five after. The former each received a single method, while the latter inherited his entire transmission. Among them, the Wudang Dongyuan Zhang Zhenren’s teachings spread across the Four Seas, his solitary peak revealed to all—his Dao flourishing particularly in the North. The Xishan Zhenxi Xiong Zhenren, though listed after the stele’s erection, propagated his teachings widely, especially in the southern lands. He transmitted them to Peng Ruli of Ancheng, who passed them to Zeng Chenwai of Anfu, who in turn transmitted them to Zhao Yuanyang of Junyi. All these inheritors became masters of their generation, their virtue and power harmonious, their inner and outer radiance resplendent.\n\n**Lei Mo’an**\nThe Zhenren’s surname was Lei, given name Shizhong, courtesy name Kequan, sobriquet Mo’an. His ancestors were originally from Yuzhang, later settling in Jinniu Town, Wuchang, Huguang. The stream near his residence meandered between the East and West Bridges, hence his alternate name, Double Bridge. Born on the fifth day of the eleventh month in the fourth year of Jiading (Xin Si, 1211) during the Chen hour, he studied poetry and rhapsodies in his youth, later mastering the *Book of Songs*. Having passed the provincial examinations thrice, he devoted himself to Daoist learning, focusing on the principles of nature. Befriending Jifu of Jiujiang, he relocated his family there during the disasters of Ji Wei and Geng Shen. In the Jiazi year, the palace marshal performed a thanksgiving ritual at the Taiping Palace, and the Master accompanied him. That night, lodging in the Listening Rain Pavilion of the Taiping Palace, he dimly perceived the Supreme Emperor addressing him: “Your fate holds no share of yang office, but you have a destiny in the yin bureaucracy—abandon thoughts of official rank.” That same night, the palace’s superintendent also dreamed of the Visiting Zhenjun, who declared, “At noon tomorrow, prepare the rituals with utmost reverence.” Among the Five Hundred Spirit Officers, one descended to the altar’s incense burner. The next day at noon, the marshal said to the Master, “I am exhausted—you may offer the incense in my stead.” Upon entering the altar, the superintendent was astonished, realizing the Master was one of the Five Hundred Spirit Officers. Later, the superintendent informed him, and the Master deepened his devotion to the Dao, renouncing all ambition for officialdom. Returning to Jinniu Town, he established an altar for rituals. On the third day of the third month in the Geng Wu year, the birthday of the Dark Warrior, the Master prepared a memorial, burning incense and reciting the *Scripture of Salvation*. Suddenly, a Daoist of extraordinary bearing arrived from outside, saying, “This poor Daoist possesses a method of the Dao and has come specifically to transmit it to you.” He produced a scroll from his sleeve, saying, “Place this text upon the altar. After seven days of purification, you may open it.” The Master received it and set it upon the incense table. Turning back, the Daoist had vanished, leaving him to realize he was an extraordinary being. Entering the altar to express gratitude, he maintained purification for seven days, then burned incense, bowed, and opened the text—it was the *Hunyuan Liutian Ruyi Daoist Method*. As he finished reading, the altar’s daylight turned to night, and in an instant, thunder and fire filled the space. The Thunder God Xin stood upon the table, declaring, “By decree of the August Heaven, I entrust you with propagating the teachings of thunder to universally deliver all beings. Our teachings take the Supreme Emperor as their lord, with me as his assistant and you as the executor.”\n\nThe one who bestowed upon you the text the other day was none other than the Patriarch Lu, the Perfected Lord. Your name is recorded in the immortal registers; for seven generations, your family has followed the Confucian path, and for three generations, they have practiced the Daoist arts—without the slightest transgression. Thus, you are destined to greatly prosper our teachings. During the Jin dynasty, the Patriarch Lu personally encountered the Most High Lord Lao, who transmitted this method to him. This teaching takes the *Scripture for Salvation* as its foundation. Whenever the Master transformed and guided the people of the world or initiated disciples, he would first instruct them to recite the scripture with utmost devotion, and each would attain their karmic rewards. He often expounded on the essence of the *Scripture for Salvation* to enlighten later learners. Its crux lies in the \"Ten Recitations for Salvation\"—not merely that ten recitations can save others, but that one must cultivate oneself daily to fathom the wonders of returning to the primordial. It is essential to first deliver one’s ancestors, and only then, with the Way complete, ascend to the Upper Clarity. The clarity of the scripture’s intent is unparalleled.\n\nDrawing from both the Confucian and Buddhist traditions, he broadly sought and synthesized, penetrating and harmonizing them into unity. As his Way spread far and wide, renowned for its excellence, those who sought his gate grew daily in number. His disciples numbered in the thousands, divided into the Eastern, Southern, Western, and Shu branches. He first initiated the two patriarchs, Lu and Li, as well as Zha Taiyu of Nankang. Thus, the Way of Lu and Li flourished in Western Shu, while Taiyu’s Way spread through the East and South. The teachings of the Primordial Unity thrived throughout the world. His writings—*Essentials of the Heart-Method*, *Direct Pointers to the Daoist Arts*, and *Songs of the Original Dao*—all elucidated the wonders of the Primordial Unity’s transformation.\n\nOn the fifth day of the fourth month in the yiwei year of the Zhiyuan era, he bathed, changed his robes, and sat upright. Approaching noon, he commanded Masters Lu and Li to lead all disciples in chanting the *Scripture for Salvation* once through. Then, he called for brush and paper and wrote this hymn:\n\n*A wheel of bright moon illumines the clear vault,*\n*Ten thousand miles without clouds, radiant in clarity.*\n*At ease and carefree, without a single affair,*\n*Ever in perfect harmony with the Great Void.*\n\nUpon finishing the hymn, he passed away in serene stillness.\n\nIn that winter, his disciples interred him at Yanshan in the commandery. Later, thunder and lightning repeatedly descended amid clouds and mist, proclaiming: \"The Celestial Emperor has elevated the Perfected One to the rank of Supreme Minister of the Mysterious Capital, Universal Savior of the Wondrous Dao of Primordial Unity, and Heavenly Venerable of Thunder’s Dharma-Teaching.\"\n\nMaster Moyue\nThe Perfected One Moyue bore the surname Mo, with the personal name Donyi and the courtesy name Qiyan. A native of Shuchuan in western Zhe, he was a descendant of Mo He. From birth, he was keenly intelligent, surpassing others in brilliance. Ardently drawn to the teachings of Daoist arts and immortals, he and his fellow townsman, Perfected Shen Zhenlei of Xijing, became disciples of Perfected Zou of the Iron Wall. There, he attended upon Perfected Wang of the Celestial Court and received the *Hidden Writ of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder Essence*, gaining renown in his time. Such luminaries as Han of Hunrong in Kuaiji and Yang Hemingchuan of Qiantang—men of towering prestige and revered as pillars of the Daoist arts—all gathered at his incense burner, further elevating the weight of his teachings.\n\nThe Perfected One, unattached and without a home, dwelled wherever he found shelter. Many sought his Way, often forsaking the world and its conventions, drinking wine until intoxicated, and delighting in their natural spontaneity. In receiving disciples, he frequently rebuked them, testing their sincerity and resolve before guiding them further. Those who could not endure would abandon the path midway.\n\nIn the dinghai year of the Zhiyuan era, he was summoned to the imperial court, where his talismanic arts flourished, and thunder and rain responded to his slightest gesture. His fame resounded throughout the capital, and those who flocked to him were as numerous as clouds or a towering wall. Some traveled thousands of miles to seek his teachings, while others offered fifty bolts of silk as tuition, which he accepted. One day, he tucked the silk into his sleeve and departed, entering a humble tavern upon encountering it. There, he aided the poor and destitute, invariably bestowing goods upon the elderly, infirm, orphaned, or weak. By dusk, upon his return, the silk was entirely spent.\n\nAmong his disciples, those with aptitude for the Dao or skill in its arts were nurtured with patient guidance. He revealed the profound mysteries of thunder and lightning to many seekers, elucidating their hidden depths. When issuing talismans to disciples, each was unique, for the Perfected One established his own methods to verify the lineage’s source. Yet upon examining their subtleties, all converged in unity.\n\nSince Perfected Wang of the Celestial Court first propagated the Dao, only the Perfected One and Perfected Shen of Xiying—two branching streams—have flourished along the Western River and prospered in the eastern lands. None have surpassed them in upholding the teachings and benefiting the people.\n\nIn the autumn of the gengyin year of the Yanyou era, precisely at noon, he sat cross-legged and asked his disciples, \"What time is it?\" They replied, \"The sun stands at high noon.\" He then called for paper and brush and composed this verse:\n\n*Seventy-four years of bright moon,*\n*Ever shifting through phases of cloud and clarity.*\n*Today, the great earth shines radiant,*\n*The three realms and empty void utterly transparent.*\n\nUpon finishing, he sat upright and passed away, his countenance glowing like cinnabar.\n\nJin Pengtou\nJin Pengtou, a native of Yongjia, bore the personal name Zhiyang and the sobriquet Ye’an. His hair, perpetually unkempt in a single topknot, earned him his sobriquet. From birth, he was set apart, bold and unyielding in youth, his great aspirations unbound. As he matured, he yearned for the Dao and abandoned the world, his heart ablaze as if consumed by fire or drowning. He became a disciple of Daoist Li Yuexi of the Quanzhen tradition. Yuexi was a follower of Perfected Li Zhenchang, who in turn was a senior disciple of Perfected Qiu Changchun.\n\nAt their first meeting, Yuexi recognized his potential and sent him to travel through Yan, Zhao, Qi, and Chu to seek the guidance of earlier worthies. There, he had the fortune to attend upon Perfected Li Zhenchang. Journeying south to Yuanzhou, he encountered Dian Junzi, a garrison commander whose appearance was imposing yet unadorned. By day, he shunned worldly affairs, and by night, he lodged in spirit shrines. Sensing his extraordinary nature, the master became his disciple and gained profound insights. He later traversed the Wuyi and Longhu Mountains.\n\nAt that time, the superintendent of the Primordial Dao Abbey at Mount Longhu, Master Fu Shizheng, lodged the master at Penglai Hermitage. The hermitage stood where the peaks of Zhengjun’s Sacred Well and Miaogu converged. There, the master scaled sheer cliffs and ravines, called out to deer and boars, and lay amidst clouds and mist as though it were ordinary. Sometimes, sitting upon a flat boulder at night, serpents and tigers would appear before him, only to recoil in alarm and depart. He instructed his disciples Li Quanzheng and Zhao Zhenchun to build Tianrui Hermitage atop the peak. From near and far, those who heard of his Way came knocking whenever afflicted by illness. He would offer them the fruits from his altar, and all were cured. Seekers of his teachings gathered daily.\n\nOnce, during a drought, he ascended Dragon Well and summoned the dragon forth, commanding it to heed his words. The scales of the dragon gradually shimmered, and it leapt into the sacred vessel. He admonished it sternly, and the dragon soared into the water. Soon after, a great rain fell. In the *guiyou* year of the Yuantong era (1333), he withdrew again to Mount Wuyi, residing at Zhizhi Hermitage on Jade Toad Peak. Li Taiping, the military commissioner of eastern Zhejiang, heard of him and paid him homage, saying: “When commands are strict, the people are well-ordered; when the heart is pure, desires are few.” Li grew ever more reverent.\n\nThere were those who envied him, plotting to poison him with drugs.\n\nThe Master, foreseeing this, ordered his disciples to dig a pond and store water. After taking the poisoned fruit, he bathed and expelled it, emerging unharmed. The site is now called the Cinnabar-Vomiting Well.\n\nOn the first day of the first month in the *bingzi* year of the Zhiyuan era (1336), his fellow disciple Gui Xinyuan—known in the world as Gui Fengzi—attained liberation while seated in meditation on Mount Lu. Upon hearing this, the Master, on the tenth day of the fourth month, instructed his disciples to write a eulogy. Then, seated in meditation, he passed away. Thirteen days later, his face remained as if in slumber, his limbs warm and supple as in life. He was interred beside the hermitage.\n\nHis disciples—Lao Yangsu, Guo Chuchang, Li Xilai, Zhang Tianquan, Yin Pona, and Fang Fanghu—all became renowned in the world for their mastery of the Dao.\n\n*Records of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages: A Comprehensive Mirror of Daoist Attainment*, Scroll Five—concluded.\n\nWhen this work was just completed, some asked: \"This is not an annalistic biography—why call it a *Comprehensive Mirror*?\" I replied: \"A *Comprehensive Mirror* is meant to illuminate all under heaven, allowing people to see their reflections in it. Why must it be confined to annalistic form? Moreover, records of immortals and transcendents often omit dates—this alone makes annalistic arrangement impossible. Some appear in the world across hundreds or thousands of years, shifting between past and present, their beginnings and ends difficult to trace—this too defies annalistic order. The vastness of the four seas makes it impossible to survey every record, collate discrepancies, and ensure no event or figure is omitted—thus, annalistic compilation is impractical. If one rigidly adheres to annalistic form, only the broad outlines can be preserved, while events lacking clear dates would either be forced into an ill-fitting structure or excised entirely, rendering the account too sparse. How, then, could scholars use it as a standard? After careful consideration, I concluded that annalistic arrangement is unsuitable for this work. Therefore, I have drawn from limited insight, examined various records of immortals and transcendents, consulted dynastic histories, and compiled this book. In the future, should time permit, I intend to adopt the style of the *Zizhi Tongjian*, gathering all verifiable dates from immortals’ biographies to create an annalistic *Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages*. Yet even such a work could only outline the essentials, not detail every event. If later scholars of broad learning and lofty vision wish to revise or expand this book, they may follow their own aspirations.\"\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Zhao Daoyi after offering incense and bowing twice.",

In adulthood, his physique was imposing, his beard and whiskers handsome. He was magnanimous and valorous, prizing righteousness and unconcerned with trivialities. In his youth, he pursued the path of a *jinshi*, enrolled in the imperial academy, and delighted in literary composition, his talent and wit swift and keen.

The years were marked by repeated famines, and people resorted to cannibalism.\n\nAt that time, in Liquan of Xianyang, only the Master’s family was wealthy enough to be considered prominent in both counties.

      "translated_text": "When the authorities dispatched soldiers to capture the offenders and apply the full rigor of the law, the Master declared, \"These are my starving neighbors, gathering what they find along the roads. I cannot bear to consign them to death.\" The officials, recognizing his virtue, released them without further inquiry, and the people marveled at his power.\n\nIn the fourth year of the *Zhenglong* reign of Emperor Hailing of Jin, the Master suddenly sighed, \"Confucius was free of doubt at forty, Mencius unshaken in heart at forty—yet here I remain, mired in mediocrity. Am I not a fool?\" From that time onward, his conduct grew less restrained, and his relatives reviled him, calling him \"harmed by wind\" daily. The Master accepted the name without protest. (In Guanzhong, those afflicted with madness were termed \"harmed by wind.\") Henceforth, he styled himself thus.\n\nThat year, in the sixth month, the Master became intoxicated at Ganhe Town when he encountered two men with unbound hair and felt cloaks, identical in age and appearance. Startled, he followed them and entreated earnestly. One of them slowly replied, \"This one may yet be taught.\" Thereupon, he imparted to the Master the oral formulas for cultivating the true. The Master was forty-eight that year, and later, in a poem commemorating the encounter, he wrote:\n*At forty-eight, the meeting came,*\n*The oral formulas brought swift gain.*\n\nThe figures he met were none other than the incarnations of Lü Dongbin, the Pure Yang Master of the Tang.\n\nOn the Mid-Autumn Festival of the fifth year, he encountered them again in Liquan. The Master hastened to bow, but the crowd laughed, \"You call yourself ‘harmed by wind’—how could you recognize a true immortal?\" The man invited the Master to drink, and when asked his origins, age, and surname, he replied, \"A man of Pu Prefecture, twenty-two years old,\" but did not disclose his surname. He left five secret texts with the Master, instructing him to read and then burn them, adding, \"Hasten east to the Bohai Sea to seek Tan Zhuoma.\" Soon after, they vanished without a trace.\n\nThe Master then abandoned his wife and studies, sent his second daughter to her betrothed’s family, and departed without a backward glance. He begged for alms in Langshe and inquired along the Zhongnan Mountains, his behavior resembling that of a madman, confounding all who saw him. Later, he built a hut in Nanshi Village, erecting a mound several feet high and digging a pit over a *zhang* deep, which he called his \"living-dead\" abode. He also styled himself \"Venerable Wang Harmed-by-Wind,\" hanging a placard above it that read: *Spirit Tablet of Wang Harmed-by-Wind*. At each corner of the hut, he planted a crabapple or pear tree. When his fellow hut-dweller, He the Harmonious, questioned him, the Master replied, \"I wish that one day the teachings of the four directions may unite as these trees have been planted.\"\n\nAfter three years, he moved to the waters of Liujiang in the north, where his every utterance seemed beyond the dust of the world. The villagers, long accustomed to dismissing him as \"harmed by wind,\" paid no heed to his words. Often, he carried a gourd and ladle as he wandered, singing and drinking. Those who did not scorn him would follow and join his revels, and the Master, ever magnanimous, never refused them. Once, returning from Ganhe with a chiseled pot of wine, a man called out, \"Harmed-by-Wind, will you share with me?\" The Master handed it over, and the man drained it in one gulp, then bade the Master fetch water from the Gan River to drink—it was the ambrosia of immortals. The man asked, \"Do you know Liu Haichan?\" The Master replied, \"How could I? I have only seen his portrait.\" The man laughed and departed. From that day forth, the Master never drank wine again; if invited, he would only drink water, yet when others grew drunk, he too would appear intoxicated.\n\nOne evening, he set fire to his own hut. The villagers rushed to extinguish the blaze, but the Master danced and sang amidst the flames:\n*For years I toiled with earnest care,*\n*Dwelling in Liujiang’s humble lair.*\n*Day by day, the dust of labor grew—*\n*Then sudden fire revealed the true.*\n*Now burned away, I rise above,*\n*And urge you all: let grievance cease.*\n*I tread a path you cannot know,*\n*Leaving but ashes where I go.*\n*On Penglai’s road, my steps are light,*\n*For I shall ne’er return to sight.*\n\nWhen asked the reason, he replied, \"In three years, someone will come to rebuild this place.\" Then he set out on his journey.\n\nThe Master once left a poem at Ganhe:\n*Leisurely I lift my gaze to the azure deep,*\n*Yet the leviathan I hook is not the mightiest beast.*\n\nAnd on the walls of Zisheng Palace in the Zhongnan Mountains, he inscribed:\n*The Master of Chongyang from Zhongnan came,*\n*Left the lung of earth, departed the capital’s frame.*\n*Pointed to Lantian, crossed Mount Hua’s height,*\n*Entered Nanjing, roamed the isles of the sea.*\n*Found a true friend, kept the immortal’s tryst,*\n*To Penglai’s shores, to honor the vow of his master.*\n\nHe once painted his own portrait, inscribing above it:\n*From whence did I come?

When he departed, he bid farewell to his fellow Daoists, exchanging poems that veiled his profound intent, though none understood.\n\nCarrying an iron pot, he begged for food along the way, saying, \"In the east, I have a green ear.\" Wending his way through the passes, he reached Dengzhou. One night, he returned to a Daoist abbey and inscribed on the wall a poem composed in Shaanxi:\n*Parted from Zhongnan’s waters and bamboo grove,*\n*No sons or grandsons left in my home.*\n*Three thousand li I sought a true friend,*\n*To lead me through the gate of deathless life.*\n\nAt dawn, he brushed off his robes and set out eastward.\n\nIn the seventh month of the seventh year of the *Dading* reign of Emperor Shizong, he arrived in Ninghai and went directly to the home of the scholar Fan Mingzhu. The master of the house was then hosting a fellow townsman, Ma Yifu, at his private residence. After some time, they met the Master and held him in high regard. Earlier, Yifu had dreamed of a crane emerging from the earth in his southern garden. When the Master arrived, they selected a site to build a hut, and the Master pointed to the very spot where the crane had risen, naming it \"Complete Perfection.\" Thus did the name *Quanzhen* originate.\n\nThe Master wished to journey west, but Yifu, though wealthy, delayed, and his wife, née Sun, proved even more reluctant. In the tenth month of winter, the Master entered a bare cell, agreeing with Yifu to spin hemp for a single meal each day and to lock himself in the hut for a hundred days. He divided pears, taro, and chestnuts between Yifu and his wife, each portion measured precisely. With every distribution, he would compose a poem or song, to which Yifu would respond in kind. The Master also revealed the karmic consequences of transgressions to admonish them. When the door was finally opened, Yifu cast aside his worldly burdens, changed his attire, and assumed the role of a disciple. The Master named him *Ren*, styled him *Xuanbao*, and gave him the sobriquet *Master Dan Yang*.",

      "translated_text": "Earlier, when the Master resided at Yifu’s estate, a certain Tan Yu, afflicted with a chronic ailment, came to seek an audience. The Master initially refused him, but Yu persistently entreated to become his disciple and was permitted to lodge in the hut. His condition soon showed marked improvement. Thereupon, Yu dismissed his wife and followed the Master, who bestowed upon him the name *Chuduan*, styled him *Yitongzheng*, and gave him the sobriquet *Master Changzhen*.\n\nSubsequently, a certain Zhu Gong, dwelling on Ox Immortal Mountain, heard of the Master’s arrival and came to pay his respects. Their exchange proved enlightening, and Zhu Gong took the Master as his teacher. Later, he resided in Cloudlight Grotto on Iron Rake Mountain, where the Master, by means of a flying canopy, conveyed his ordained name and title: *Chuyi*, with the sobriquet *Master Sanyang*.\n\nThere was also Hao Sheng, well-versed in the *Book of Changes*, who divined fortunes in the marketplace. The Master entered his stall and sat with his back turned. Sheng said, “Sir, pray turn your head.” The Master replied at once, “Why do *you* not turn your head?” Sheng was struck with awe. The Master departed, and Sheng followed him to Chaoyuan Abbey, where the Master imparted two lyrics to elucidate profound truths. Sheng was deeply moved and awakened, thereafter assuming the role of a disciple. Later, at Misty Glow Grotto, the Master granted him the name *Lin*, the sobriquet *Master Tianran*, and bestowed upon him a robe of unlined cloth.\n\nBefore long, the Master led Ma Gang and others to Kunjian Mountain. Upon arrival, he pointed and declared, “Here lies Misty Glow Grotto, where my forebears once cultivated the Dao.” He ordered it excavated, and though the tools had rotted away, the jade pool and well remained. Later, as they quarried stone from the ridge, a massive boulder threatened to crash down upon the hut. The Master shouted at it sternly, and it halted abruptly, standing firm. Woodcutters and gatherers on the mountain witnessed this and were astonished.\n\nAt that time, Qiu Gong of Bingxia, though only nineteen, had already entered the Dao but had yet to find a teacher, lingering instead on Kunlun Mountain.

      "translated_text": "The Master, recognizing his great potential, presented him with a poem and bestowed upon him the name *Chuji*, the courtesy name *Tongmi*, and the sobriquet *Master of Eternal Spring*. From then on, disciples gathered in considerable numbers. The Master disciplined them with scolding, flogging, and rigorous trials, and most gradually dispersed. Only Ma, Tan, and Qiu remained steadfast in their resolve.\n\nIn the eighth month of the eighth year, the Master moved from Misty Glow to Jiangshi Hut in Wendeng. By the ninth month, he resided at Suzai Hut north of the county. In the fourth month of the ninth year, Zhou Botong of Ninghai invited the Master to establish the Golden Lotus Hall and the Golden Lotus Assembly. The well water there had long been brackish, but after the Master chanted over it, it turned sweet and pure. One night, a radiance as bright as daylight appeared. People, mistaking it for fire, rushed to see and witnessed the Master walking with luminous light trailing behind him.\n\nThe Master once instructed Ma Gang’s wife, Sun, named *Bu’er*, with the sobriquet *Serene Daoist*. He also showed her paintings of the celestial realms. On the fifth day of the fifth month, he had Bu’er burn her vow document and again presented her with a poem. He established the Seven Treasures Assembly in Wendeng, the Three Lights Assembly in Fuchuan, and the Jade Flower Assembly in Dengzhou.\n\nWhile visiting Penglai Pavilion to observe the sea, a sudden gale arose. People saw the Master carried by the wind into the sea. After a moment, he leapt out again, though his hairpin and cap were lost. Later, they floated to the surface and drifted ashore.\n\nThere was a man named Jie, who had long been devoted to good works and earnestly sought to leave the household life. The Master, however, refused him. After Jie departed, the Master remarked to others: “Here are two men who wish to build a great hall. The first has already laid the foundation and gathered ample timber. Before he could seek a craftsman, one arrived of his own accord—why? Because the materials are prepared, and the work can be completed. The second merely points to where the foundation should be, yet the ground is uneven, and no laborers have gathered. The craftsmen see this and depart.”\n\nWhen the Master was at Misty Glow, Zhang Dezhao had a son, bright and only sixteen, whom he sent to the mountain to study. As the boy had a deep karmic connection from past lives, the Master repeatedly explained the principles of the Dao through songs, poems, and two paintings. Later, the boy left the mountain to visit his parents but never returned. The Master wrote to Dezhao, imparting further true teachings. Though the boy inwardly understood and revered them, and though he had the destiny of an immortal, he could not rouse himself from the dust of the world.\n\nWhenever the Master guided others, he carefully assessed their capacity. Thus, he addressed Dezhao’s son as *Little Zhang* rather than by his given name. Though he admonished him in every way, he could not bring him to fulfillment. Jie, on the other hand, pleaded earnestly to leave the household life, yet the Master ultimately refused him. Such were his methods.\n\nIn Laizhou, he established the Assembly of Equality, and from then on, people near and far were stirred. Over a thousand joined the assembly. The general proclamation of the five assemblies read: “Equality is the origin of the Dao and virtue, the source of purity and stillness, the root of the Jade Flower and Golden Lotus, and the wellspring of the Three Lights and Seven Treasures. It universally saves all beings and delivers the common people. Each person aspires to sprout the golden spore; none wander the dark path.\n\nThe Jade Flower is the origin of *qi*. The Golden Lotus is the ancestor of spirit. Spirit is the child of *qi*; *qi* is the mother of spirit. When mother and child meet, one becomes an immortal. Yet this requires true practice and true conduct: calming the mind, stabilizing intent, embracing the origin, guarding the One, preserving spirit, and consolidating *qi*—this is true practice. Cultivating benevolence, accumulating virtue, aiding the poor, relieving suffering, putting others before oneself, and acting without selfishness—this is true conduct.”\n\nThere were also the *Determining Fate of the Golden Lotus* memorial, the *Enlightenment* memorial, the *Three Lights* memorial, the *Jade Flower* memorial, the rules of the Assembly of Equality, and various poems, most of which are not recorded here.\n\nLater, the Master traveled back and forth between Dengzhou, Laizhou, and Ninghai. Whenever he departed, he left poems as farewells. In the ninth month, he took Ma, Tan, and Qiu and journeyed west. Passing through Dengzhou, the prefect, Heshelie Miao, received him with the rites due a master. At parting, Miao asked, “When shall we meet again?” The Master replied, “In Nanjing.” Later, after the Master’s ascension, Miao was appointed vice military commissioner of Nanjing.\n\nThe Master also pointed to the painted bridge outside the Wangxian Gate and told the townspeople, “In years to come, when you cross this bridge, it will surely collapse.” A full cycle of twelve years later, the prefect He Bangyan, deeming the bridge’s structure too steep for carriages and horses, ordered it rebuilt. Such were the instances of his foresight.\n\nUpon reaching Yecheng, he gained another disciple, a man named Liu, who had first come with his mother to pay respects.",

      "translated_text": "Upon first meeting Liu, the Master immediately perceived his destiny to leave the household life and explained this to him, to which his mother gladly assented. He bestowed upon him the name Chu Xuan and the sobriquet Master of Longevity, whereupon Liu took his leave to follow the Way. By this time, those known as Ma, Tan, Liu, and Qiu had all gathered beneath the Master’s teaching.\n\nThus the *Bamboo Staff Song* declares:\n*\"O’er seas I sought true friends to come,\nYet who could bear my trust and home?\nLast night in dreams I saw them gleam—\nFour rainbows leapt in radiant stream.\"*\nThis verse foretold their meeting.\n\nThe poems and events surrounding these beginnings are recorded in their respective biographies.\n\nThe Master arrived in Nanjing and lodged at the Wang family inn. At the time, Meng Zongxian, a friend of his, had returned from his post as vice prefect of Shanzhou due to his mother’s mourning. There was a certain Master Shenfeng, Du Ge by name, who had once prophesied four auspicious events for Zongxian, all of which came to pass. Zongxian thus revered him as an immortal. One day, Du suddenly told Zongxian, “The Marshal has arrived. I must pay my respects.” Zongxian instructed his servants to follow discreetly. Du proceeded directly to the Wang inn, where he knelt on one knee before the Master. The Master, lying down and reading, paid him no heed. Zongxian, who held Du in high regard, was astonished upon hearing this. Du returned a second time, and the Master at last glanced at him. On the third visit, the Master smiled and looked his way, whereupon Du departed in jubilation.\n\nZongxian then went to pay his respects himself. The Master continued reading, offering no greeting. When asked what he was reading, he did not reply. Zongxian drew nearer and saw it was the *Collection of Lyric Poems*. He asked, “Is this the complete edition?” The Master said, “Only one volume.” Zongxian said, “I have the full collection at home. You may read it.” He promptly had it sent over.\n\nFrom the day the Master arrived in the capital, he had sent Ma Gang and the other three to beg for money in the market. They would buy a carp by the catty, cook it, and eat it—if the scales did not measure a full catty, they would not eat. Zongxian was perplexed, musing, *A Daoist reading the *Collection of Lyric Poems*—this is already unseemly. And now he eats fish, insisting on its exact weight. What manner of man is this?*\n\nAnother day, Zongxian asked if he had finished the *Collection of Lyric Poems*. The Master said nothing but returned the original volume. Zongxian examined it and found that between the blank lines, every poem had been matched with a response. He could not help but sigh, “The words of an immortal!” He then bathed, changed his clothes, burned incense, and sought instruction, his reverence deepening day by day.\n\nFrom then on, the Master no longer ate fish, for he had intended this as a sign to Zongxian, who was a great carp in a past life. The Master then ordered Ma Gang to summon craftsmen to build a single-seat wind carriage. When the work was completed, the Master said, “Recently, fire has scorched my eyes, and I cannot see. Light a lamp and hold it close to illuminate them.” Ma Gang instantly understood.\n\nThe Master also purchased four carp from the market, threaded them, and dragged them into the inn.",

      "translated_text": "Having boiled two catties of mutton alongside them until done, he stored them away for over a month, by which time the fish and meat had all rotted and spoiled. He then ordered his disciples to eat it. At the time, each had vowed to abstain from meat and strong flavors, and none dared partake. The Master pressed them, and all said they dared not. Only Ma Gang prostrated himself and said, “If the Master commands it, your disciple will eat.” The Master rebuked him, “You yourself cannot sever attachment—do you seek to shift the blame onto me?” Thereupon, he gave him a full bowl. The Master then said, “When you reach Guanzhong, you will find no such thing to eat.” For several mornings, he first had Gang eat the mutton and fish, then sent him to buy wine. He purchased steamed jujubes and honeyed sweets from the market and ate them himself. Turning to Gang, he asked, “Do you understand?” Gang had not yet grasped the lesson, so the Master intensified his harsh instruction, railing, beating, and berating him without regard for day or night, saying, “One day, you will surely awaken.” Gang bowed in gratitude, “I am indebted to the Master’s compassionate teaching; I have nothing with which to repay you.” The Master said, “Only through cultivation can you repay me.”\n\nLater, upon entering Guanzhong, Gang at last understood that all the events in the capital had been profound teachings. During the twelfth lunar month, the Master subjected Gang and the others to extreme trials, refining them relentlessly. Of the hundreds and thousands who had once followed, only a few remained, their every action and word met with scolding, their conduct upended. As the disciples had collected much money and goods, the Master purchased firewood and charcoal, burning them in great quantities in the small chamber where they slept. He ordered Ma Gang to sit upright inside, while Liu Chuxuan and Qiu Chuji stood outside. Those within could not endure the heat, while those without could not bear the cold. Chuxuan, unable to withstand it, fled. The Master then arranged the three before his bed and said, “Danyang has attained the Dao, Changzhen has comprehended the Way—I have no concerns. As for Chuji’s learning, let it be guided by Danyang and Chuxuan; Changzhen shall oversee him.” Turning to Chuji, he said, “This disciple’s future standing will be extraordinary; he will surely expand the gates of the teaching.”\n\nAt the start of the first lunar month, the Master took leave of the assembly, saying, “Now is the time to keep my true master’s appointment.” Ma Gang and the others begged for a parting gift. The Master replied, “Long ago, I wrote on the wall of Lü the Daoist’s hut in Luancun, Jingzhao, and composed a verse:\n\n*Earth’s lung, the Master of Chongyang,*\n*Called ‘Wang the Harmful Wind.’*\n*Coming, he lingered long in sun and moon;*\n*Departing, he roams west and east at will.*\n*Cloud and water his companions,*\n*Void and emptiness his neighbors.*”",

He was fifty-eight years old. It was the fourth day of the first lunar month in the tenth year of the Dading era.\n\nHis disciple You said to the assembly, “As his disciple, I shall oversee the funeral rites.”\nHe performed daily offerings with utmost care, and when the coffin was later moved west, he did not slacken in the least.\nHe told his son, “Five of us received the transformative guidance of Master Chongyang Wang. I am one of them.”\n\nMa Gang and the others arrived at Lü the Daoist’s hut in Luancun, Jingzhao, where they found the verse he had written.\nThey also exchanged poems with Li Lingyang of Yuchan at Zhongnan. While the Master was in Nanjing, he had sent a poem to the two, containing the line: *“First I departed, and the three of us became one.”*\nWhen they met Shi Mi of Liquan, he produced an old diagram, and all the signs aligned.\nTogether, they repaired the Master’s former hut.\n\nThe Master had never been esteemed by his hometown, but when Ma Gang arrived in Qin, the people only then began to regret their neglect.\nLater, Ma Gang and his companions returned to Nanjing to retrieve the coffin and interred it at Liujiang.\nThey built a hut and remained for three years before each followed their own path.\nMa Gang succeeded the teaching, and with Tan, Liu, and Qiu, became the leading figures of the lineage. The Quanzhen school honored Zhong, Lü, and Liu as the Three Patriarchs, and the Master as the Grand Patriarch.\n\nIn the sixth year of the Zhiyuan era of the Great Yuan (1269), the imperial court bestowed upon him the posthumous title *Chongyang Quanzhen Kaihua Zhenjun* (True Lord Chongyang, Opener of the Quanzhen Teaching).\nHis collected works, *The Quanzhen Anthology of Concealed Radiance*, circulated in the world.\n\nMinister Dao Yi said:\n*“When the royal is insufficient, the imperial arises; when the imperial is insufficient, the kingly arises; when the kingly is insufficient, the hegemonic arises. When even the hegemonic is insufficient, it is the misfortune of the Dao.*\n*How sublime is Quanzhen, rising as a hero in the Central Land!*\n*It turned the decadent back to primordial simplicity, transformed the stubborn to yearn for non-action.*\n*One master initiated it, and the Seven Perfected harmonized with him.*\n*Magnificent and grand! In this age of statecraft,*\n*Its power did not yield to the Five Hu,*\n*Its virtue did not fall short of the Tuoba.*\n*The Mandate’s continuity was indeed preserved.*\n*Yet Heaven initiated the teaching of the Mysterious Origin, bestowing blessings upon all beings. The Dao was not lost, enduring to this day—this is the achievement of Quanzhen.”*\n\nThe *Daode Jing* says:\n*“The Great Dao flows everywhere, to left and right.*\n*All things depend on it for life, yet it does not refuse.*\n*Its work is accomplished, yet it claims no merit.*\n*It nurtures all things yet does not act as their master—thus it may be called ‘small.’*\n*All things return to it, yet it does not act as their master—thus it may be called ‘great.’*\n*Therefore, the sage never strives to be great, and so achieves greatness.”*\n*Is this not the essence of Quanzhen?*\n\n**Ma Yu**\nThe Master’s original name was Congyi, styled Yifu. Later, he took the name Gang, styled Xuanbao, and changed it again. His Daoist name was Danyangzi.\nHe was a descendant of General Ma Yuan of the Han, originally from Fufeng. Due to the warfare of the Five Dynasties, his family relocated to Ninghai. His family had long been scholars.\nHis grandfather, Jue, styled Shensou, was filial and well-versed in the Five Classics.\nHis father, Shi Yang, styled Xixian, was dignified and composed, known for his filial piety and integrity.\nIn his youth, a guest fled in alarm, leaving behind an oilcloth bundle at his home.

My family has long made a living from pottery and kiln work. I had obtained two *yi* of gold and was about to make offerings at the market when I was pursued by the tax inspectors. Thanks to your kindness, I escaped. Please accept half as a token of my gratitude.” Xixian declined, refusing to accept it. Lü said, “You possess the yellow countenance of one who turns toward the wind; in the future, a lofty scholar shall emerge from your family.” Later, when he sought out Yougu Village, he found no one of the Lü surname and only then realized its strangeness.\n\nXixian had five sons, named after the virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness, and they were known as the \"Five Constants of the Ma Clan.\" The Master was the second son. When his mother was pregnant with him, she dreamed of the goddess Magu bestowing a single cinnabar pellet, which she swallowed. Upon waking, she felt an auspicious radiance. This occurred on the twentieth day of the fifth month in the first year of the Tianhui era of Emperor Taizong of Jin.\n\nIn his childhood, the Master often recited phrases about riding clouds and driving cranes. As he grew, though well-versed in Confucian studies, he took no joy in seeking official advancement. His father, fond of his talent, entrusted him with managing the family’s storehouses. He was generous in aiding others and free from selfishness, thus earning a reputation for valuing wealth lightly and delighting in charity.\n\nLi Wumeng saw him and marveled, saying, “His forehead bears the mark of three mountains, and his hands hang past his knees—truly the bearing of a great immortal!” He praised him further, saying, “His body is majestic, his face round, his ears long, his brows refined, his eyes bright, his nose straight, and his mouth square. His auspicious features are complete, and his crown radiates divine light.” Yifu received this prophecy and, in step with the Lotus Manor, took up residence there.\n\nBefore long, after his elixir was refined, Sun Zhongxian of the loyalist faction betrothed his daughter to the Master.

Then he understood: *Ji-Hai* was the cyclical sign of the pen, and *Xin-Si* that of Qingcai’s age. The Master, deeming the dream inauspicious, summoned the diviner Sun Ziyuan to interpret it and inquire into his lifespan. Ziyuan said, “Your years will not exceed forty-nine.” The Master was deeply awakened, saying, “Is life and death truly not in man’s hands? I must seek those who have attained the Dao and learn the Way of long life and enduring vision.”\n\nAnother time, while playing chess with a guest, he would often recite to himself, *“If this move is not mistaken, I shall not die.”*\n\nIn the seventh month of the seventh year of the Dading era under Emperor Shizong, he drank with Gao Jucai of Liaoyang and his fellow townsman Zhan Shi at the *Yi Lao* Pavilion of Fan Mingshu.

Zhan Shi asked, “In coarse cloth and bamboo hat, braving the heat to hasten here—why such diligence?” The Patriarch replied, “An old pact with immortals, and a search for one who knows me.” After eating a melon, he began from the stem. Asked why, he said, “Sweetness comes from bitterness.” When asked whence he came, he answered, “A thousand *li* distant, I come especially to support a drunken man.”\n\nThe Master thought silently, *“In my earlier poem, I spoke of ‘that man coming to prop me up’—how does this man know?”* He then asked, “What is the Dao?” The Patriarch replied, *“Where the Five Phases do not reach,\nBefore father and mother were born.”*\n\nMingshu said, “These ten words alone exhaust the subtlety—could any but a divine immortal utter them?” As they sat in conversation, the Patriarch’s words resonated deeply with the Master.

      "translated_text": "At first, the Master dreamed of a crane emerging from the earth. Later, he built a hut in the southern garden at the very spot where the Patriarch had pointed to the crane’s rising, naming it *Quanzhen* (\"Perfect Realization\"). The Patriarch was determined to take the Master on a journey west, but the Master, burdened by family affairs, could not easily abandon them. The Patriarch then expounded at length on the loftiness of leaving one’s homeland and the encumbrances of remaining, offering him enlightenment. From then on, the Master’s bond with the Patriarch deepened daily.\n\nThat year, in the tenth month, the Patriarch instructed the Master to lock his hut and subsist on a single meal each day. It was the depths of winter, with wind and snow sweeping in from all sides, yet the hut contained nothing but brush, inkstone, pillow, mat, a coarse robe, and straw sandals. Nevertheless, his spirit and form remained serene, as if bathed in the warmth of spring. Those who understood called it the wonder of a perfected one turning a frozen valley to spring.\n\nOn the first day of his seclusion, the Patriarch gave him a pear, telling him to eat it. Every six days, he received six taro roots and six chestnuts. On the eleventh day of the month, the pear was divided in two, and he shared it with his wife. Thereafter, the six-day taro and chestnuts and the ten-day pear became a regular schedule. The taro and chestnuts remained as before, but the pear increased by one every ten days. By the ninetieth day, the total had accumulated to fifty-five.\n\nEach time the Patriarch sent these provisions, he embedded subtle meanings in poems or lyrics, to which the Master responded in kind. Interpreters said: *Taro* (芋) signifies *encounter* (遇), and *pear* (梨) signifies *separation* (离). To establish an encounter is to embrace the principle of separation. Moreover, *division* (分) means *reduction upon reduction*. Fifty-five is the number of heaven and earth’s odd and even, intended to lead one to sever ties with kin and village until nothing remains unsevered.\n\nThe Patriarch also warned him in a dream with ten transgressions against the ten precepts. On the eleventh day of the first month of the eighth year, the lock was removed. The Patriarch said, “We will depart in three or four days. Follow me and return.” He then composed a verse:\n\n*Strange indeed! A hundred days of wind sealed in a hut.*\n\nThereupon, the Master entrusted his property to Tingzhen and others, left a letter of farewell for the Sun family, and went to the marketplace to beg. The Patriarch, recalling the Master’s dream of refining white into yellow—a formula for immortality—bestowed upon him his present name and title. In another dream, the Master followed the Patriarch into a mountain. At dawn, the Patriarch called out, “Shan Tongyin shall be your childhood name.”\n\nIn the second month, he accompanied the Patriarch to the Misty Grotto of Kunyu Mountain. Suddenly, he suffered an unbearable headache, and the Patriarch sent him home for treatment. One day, the Patriarch said to his disciples, “Master Ma has broken the Dao.” When asked how he knew, he replied, “Last night, I dreamed of drinking wine. I sent someone to inquire, and it turned out the medicine required wine as a catalyst. Unaware, he drank too much, worsening his condition.” The messenger returned, saying, “Master Ma is near death.” The Patriarch clapped his hands and said, “I searched three thousand *li* for this true friend—how could it end like this? Because his faith was not steadfast, he brought this illness upon himself. A sip of dharma-water will cure him.” He then sent a true teaching:\n\n*“All who study the Dao must first adhere to these twelve words: renounce wine, lust, wealth, anger, attachments, love, worries, thoughts, and anxieties. From now on, there is nothing more to say. If you do not follow this, even if you refine the elixir of immortality, you will not attain liberation of life and spirit.”*\n\nIn the eighth month, the Patriarch was at Jiangshi Hut in Wendeng. He warned his disciples in advance, “If Master Ma comes, do not let him in.” On the first day of the ninth month, the Master arrived as expected. The Patriarch sent word: “If we meet now, we will not meet later; if we are to meet later, we will not meet now.” The Master pleaded for a future meeting, so he was allowed to stay at Su’s Hut north of the county.\n\nIn the tenth month, the Patriarch ordered the Master to burn his vow document and presented him with a poem:\n\n*You cast the golden hook just a year ago,\nNow you swallow the fragrant bait, led by the line.\nOn Jade Capital Mountain, you transform into a roc,\nFollowing me in a whirlwind into the grotto-heaven.*\n\nOn the fifth day of the fifth month, the Patriarch was at Golden Lotus Hall. He had the Sun family burn their vow document and move to a separate hut. On the eleventh day, he summoned the Master to Fan Mingshu’s residence and presented him with a lyric, which the Master did not accept. Though briefly allowed to stay, he was soon driven out again. Later, in Nanjing, they finally lived together.\n\nThe Patriarch wished the Master to raise funds in Ninghai, but the Master declined, citing his vow never to return home. The Patriarch grew angry and beat him from night until dawn. They traveled west, reaching Bianliang, where they lodged at Wang’s inn for some time. The Patriarch subjected the Master and others to even harsher trials—scolding, beating, and unpredictable treatment, whether kind or harsh. Every aspect of their diet and daily life was imbued with immortal subtleties.\n\nAs the year drew to a close, the Patriarch addressed the assembly: “Now is the time to fulfill my true destiny.” The Master asked for a final verse, and the Patriarch replied, “I have already written it in Guanzhong.” On the fourth day of the first month of the tenth year, he entrusted his last instructions and passed away.\n\nThe Master and the others raised funds, carried the Patriarch’s remains to Jingzhao, and buried them at Liujiang, as per his final command. They then built a ring of huts around the Patriarch’s former abode and observed three years of mourning, wearing their hair in three topknots. These three topknots represented the three auspicious characters of the Patriarch’s taboo name, which the Master revered and adopted, often calling himself *Santiji Shan Tongyin* (\"Three Topknots Mountain Child\").\n\nOnce, he and Qiu, Liu, and Tan gathered at the Zhenwu Temple in Qin Crossing on a moonlit night, each declaring their aspirations. The Master said, *“The nation is poor”*; Tan said, *“The tide is right”*; Liu said, *“The nation’s will”*; and Qiu said, *“The nation is at leisure.”* Though all had emerged from Chongyang’s lineage, the Patriarch had once spoken of “one disciple and one nephew,” so the Master was specially addressed as *Shishu* (\"Master Uncle\").\n\nIn the fifteenth year, his younger brother Yunfu sent a letter inviting him to attend their parents’ burial. The Master replied: *“You bury bones; I deliver spirits. Our paths differ, but our hearts in repaying kindness are the same.”* He responded with a lyric on refining cinnabar.\n\nThe Master once composed *Ten Exhortations* and *A Hundred Negations*. One day, he showed them to the assembly, saying, *“This is not my own idea—it was originally the Patriarch’s teaching, which I completed.”*",
      "overlap_context": "ught silently, *“In my earlier poem, I spoke of ‘that man coming to prop me up’—how does this man know?”* He then asked, “What is the Dao?” The Patriarch replied, *“Where the Five Phases do not reach,\nBefore father and mother were born.”*\n\nMingshu said, “These ten words alone exhaust the subtlety—could any but a divine immortal utter them?” As they sat in conversation, the Patriarch’s words resonated deeply with the Master. The Master invited him to his private residence and became his disciple.",

      "translated_text": "The Master further asked his disciples, *“How many periods are there in a day and night?”* They replied, *“Twelve.”* The Master said, *“Within these twelve periods, the Dao of Heaven revolves, governing the workings of creation—does it ever pause or rest?”* They answered, *“We do not know.”* The Master said, *“Those who study the Dao must emulate the Dao of Heaven, governing the workings of creation within their own bodies. In all twelve periods, remain ever pure and ever still, without the slightest dust-like thought arising. As days pass and months progress, once your efforts reach fruition, immortality is assured.”*\n\nIn the eighteenth year, he departed for Huating. Liu Zhaoxin, Li Dacheng, and more than ten others failed to grasp his meaning, so he composed a poem containing the lines: *“The brocade-scaled fish eludes the empty casting; I gather my jade rod and return.”* Dacheng then awakened and, performing the rites of a disciple, was granted the name *Lingyangzi*.\n\nThe Master resided in Huayang Pavilion. Outside its walls stood a *laiqin* tree, long withered. On the fourth day of the fourth month, the Master drew water from the encircling moat to water it. Just then, his disciple Yao Xuan presented the genealogy of the Pure Yang Perfected, asking him to punctuate it. Only then did he learn that Pure Yang had been born beneath this very tree on the fourteenth day of the fourth month. The Master said, *“I was born on the twentieth day of the fifth month. By that day, this tree will have sprouted leaves.”* Dacheng privately remarked to others, *“The summer solstice is not far off—can it truly revive?”* The Master composed a verse: *“Thirty-six above, thirty-six below; Heaven and Earth enter the precious vessel, and the seventy-two seasonal nodes are complete.”* Li asked for an explanation, but the Master replied, *“This is a hidden saying—how could it be easily understood? Its fulfillment will come in time.”* On the appointed day, the tree burst into lush green leaves. They then realized that from the fourteenth of the fourth month to the twentieth of the fifth was thirty-six days, and the union of Heaven and Earth made seventy-two nodes. Dacheng thus composed *An Account of the Wondrous Tree*.\n\nThe Daoist friend Cui of Zhiyang read the account and doubted its excessiveness. In the fourth month, he transplanted two clumps of bamboo and a pine tree to the Quanzhen Hermitage. Due to the untimely transplanting, their branches and leaves yellowed and withered. Cui asked the Master, *“Can these pine and bamboo be revived?”* The Master replied with a poem containing the lines: *“Beyond the window, not only gentlemen turn green; before the hermitage, I rejoice that the great man flourishes.”* He then instructed his disciple Yu Zhiyi to remove the yellowed leaves and water the plants with his washing water. Within ten days, they had returned to their former luxuriance.\n\nThe Master led his disciples westward to Mount Kongtong, passing through Tingchuan. Officials and commoners alike thronged to seek his teachings, their shoulders rubbing and heels touching, fearful of being left behind. Moved by their sincerity, he patiently expounded the Dao without tiring. Even those who had once been arrogant and reckless reformed their hearts and minds, ashamed of their past misdeeds.\n\nIn the twentieth year, on the twenty-fourth day of the eighth month, the Master went to Chang’an to pray for rain. He composed a poem: *“One plow’s worth awaits fulfillment—when? Five times five, no more than twenty-five.”* The next day, the rain fell abundantly.\n\nIn the twenty-first year, while in Jingzhao, the Master asked his disciple Lai Lingyu, *“In Guanzhong, what do they call it when old clothes are taken apart and washed clean?”* Lingyu replied, *“They call it ‘unpicking and washing.’”* The Master said, *“The Eastern Teachings have grown old and corrupted over the years—I shall unpick and wash them.”* Before ten days had passed, an official document arrived, causing the Quanzhen community in Shaanxi to tremble in fear. Only Changchun said to Dacheng, *“Our Dao moves eastward. Though I am named in the document, I must not leave the Pass. If I depart, the teachings in Guanzhong will be swept away.”* The Master left the Pass, and wherever he went, the old and young vied to welcome and see him off.\n\nWhen he reached Jinan, a man named Han Taoqingfu, who admired the character of Shao Yaofu and named his residence the Garden of Peace and Joy, invited the Master to visit. He begged the Master for a teaching, who said, *“The Dao takes non-attachment as its essence, forgetting words as its function, softness and weakness as its root, and purity and stillness as its foundation. Restrain your diet, cut off distracting thoughts, sit quietly to regulate your breath, and sleep peacefully to nurture your qi. When the mind does not wander, the nature is settled; when the body is not wearied, the essence is preserved; when the spirit is not disturbed, the elixir congeals. Then, extinguish desires in emptiness, pacify the spirit in quiescence, and without leaving your courtyard, you will attain the wondrous Dao.”* Han bowed in gratitude, saying, *“The great Dao is vast and formless—there was nothing I could ask. Now, having heard your profound teaching, I have found the gate by which to enter.”*\n\nIn the twelfth month of the twenty-second year, the Master was proselytizing in Wendeng. The son-in-law of the fisherman Mr. Tan and others burned their nets at Langya. A sudden shift in the wind and snow revealed a mirage of a sea market, which the literati praised by reciting Su Dongpo’s poem on the sea market. The Master composed a poem in response.\n\nThe water of Golden Lotus Hall had long been brackish and bitter. The Master approached the well and rinsed it, and the water turned as sweet as fine wine. The people of the prefecture called it *Lingye* (“Numinous Liquid”) and built a pavilion with a stele to record the marvel.\n\nWhile at Seven Treasures Hermitage in Wendeng, the Master’s disciples dug a well nine feet deep but were blocked by a great stone. The Master then revealed a verse from the immortals of the grotto-heavens: *“Dig two feet deeper, and sweet springs will naturally respond to your pure chant.”* When they dug one foot and eight inches deeper, the spring gushed forth.\n\nOne day, the Master said to his disciples, *“Today, there shall be an extraordinary joy.”* He then sang and danced in delight.",

      "translated_text": "Shortly after, word arrived: on the last day of the twelfth lunar month in the *renyin* year, Immortal Maiden Sun ascended in Henan Prefecture.\n\nShe once explained to her disciples the inner heaven and earth, saying:\n*“If one can remain perpetually pure and still,\nHeaven and earth will all return to you.*\nThe diaphragm and above is heaven;\nThe diaphragm and below is earth.\nWhen heavenly *qi* descends and earthly *qi* ascends,\nHarmonizing above and below,\nThe *qi* naturally becomes whole.”\n\nShe also spoke of the four bodily applications:\n*“When walking, place your feet on level ground;\nWhen standing, concentrate your spirit in the great void;\nWhen sitting, regulate the breath at the tip of your nose;\nWhen lying down, embrace the inner pearl within your abdomen.”*\n\nShe composed linked verses as well:\n*“In water, flames advance to form the Three Elixirs;\nWithin fire, a lotus blooms to perfect one’s nature.\nMale Dao-seekers, shed the illusion of self;\nFierce truth-cultivators, cast aside worldly sentiments.\nThe stone maiden plays the flute, phoenixes dance;\nThe clay ox enters the sea, tigers and dragons harmonize.\nThe Jade Crone of Exquisite Clarity strikes the dragon’s horn;\nThe Vigilant Golden Youth rides the tiger’s waist.”*\n\nSuch verses were numerous, all concerning the affairs within the Daoist’s body.\n\nLater, the Master returned to the sea. The First Patriarch had once established the Five Assemblies, which the Master then revived and expounded anew. Upon reaching Ninghai, one day he spoke to the butcher Liu Qingju and his household about a dream, saying: *“By my reckoning, over twenty years, the number of lives you have taken is now complete. If you do not change your trade, you will surely enter the Prison of No Inquiry.”* Qingju then burned all his butchering tools outside the city walls.\n\nIn the fourth month of the twenty-third year, the Master intended to visit Gao Village in Zhiyang. Along the way, nearly a hundred people gathered near him. Some remarked: *“From dawn until noon, a mirage appeared over the sea and has not yet vanished. Though such sights have occurred before, they could never be seen except at dawn. Today, with the Master’s arrival, this extraordinary event has come to pass.”* The local fishermen—Ju Fu, Guo Heng, Le Zhou, and others—without needing persuasion, gathered their nets and burned them on Mulberry Island.\n\nAfter noon, there appeared in response dragon-drawn chariots, crane-borne carriages, banners, feathered canopies, and other marvels. The scholar Hong Ru composed *A Record of the Sea Market’s Responsive Wonders*.\n\nOn the Festival of the Lower Prime, a Ninefold Yīn Offering was held at Mount Wen. That night, the Master heard a voice from the void announcing: *“The True Man of Chongyang has arrived.”* The next day at the hour of the evening meal, the First Patriarch appeared, wearing a blue headscarf and white robe, seated upon a white tortoise amidst a green lotus leaf. The tortoise wagged its tail. The assembly cheered, prostrating in the mud. The First Patriarch turned his body slightly outward and departed toward the southeast.",

      "translated_text": "On the last day of the ninth month, the Master sat in incense-burning meditation with the monk Candle Discipline Master and the scholar Fan Shouqing at the Three Teachings Hall north of the city. Wang Daoshi of Yongzhou arrived bearing a zither and played it. As the sun turned westward, villagers gathered in throngs. The Master performed *The Melody of Returning to the Mountains*:\n\n*To be without doing—yet nothing left undone,*\n*To be without knowing—yet nothing left unknown.*\n*Who would not follow this Dao?*\n*Yet who truly knows it?*\n\n*The wind sighs through the trees as leaves take flight,*\n*The wild geese cry aloft, bound southward in their flight.*\n*Alas, the fleeting world—how time hastens on!*\n*Old age nears death, yet still men cling to folly and desire.*\n\n*Grieved by the world, my soul would take wing,*\n*Alas, the world—how it would break my heart!*\n*Hard to resolve—this world is not our home.*\n*Pointing to the green mountains, I say: return while time remains.*\n\n*By night, the green mountains gleam with moonlight’s glow,*\n*By dawn, the green mountains bid the moon farewell.*\n*Hunger fed on mist, thirst slaked by the stream,*\n*Cut off from the world—unknown to men.*\n\n*Without knowing, without doing,*\n*This heart extinguished—what more could be done?*\n*In the Heavenly Court, twin blossoms take flight,*\n*Ascending the Three Palaces, wandering the Purple Tenuity.*\n\nShortly after, he took up his brush and wrote *In Praise of Shedding Form*, its essence reading:\n\n*Great is the ascent to truth,*\n*The path leads into the azure void.*\n*Unicorns follow the crimson tassels,*\n*Phoenixes wield the vermilion plow.*\n*Jade chimes tinkle at the girdle,*\n*Walking the void, treading the clouds.*\n*Transcending to receive the true writ,*\n*Ascending to the Jade Dawn.*\n\nHere he veiled his intent to return to the Real.\n\nIn the twelfth month, on the anniversary of the First Patriarch’s descent, an offering was held at the Wandering Immortals Abbey in Laiyang. The Master repeatedly gazed beyond the clouds. His disciple Cao Suo asked the reason, and he replied: “The First Patriarch and Master He, my uncle, have arrived. I am bound for Penglai and Yingzhou.” Yu Zhiyi said: “The affairs here are vast—we beg you to remain in the world a while longer.” The Master said: “I depart in full majesty, to become a carefree immortal.”\n\nHe called Liu Zhenyi and instructed: “If you wish to become immortals, you must accumulate merit and pile up deeds. Even if you encounter a thousand trials or ten thousand hardships, never retreat or slacken. Only then may you grasp my words. When my eyes are open, I see; when they are closed, I see. Seeing does not depend on the eyes—only when the heart is clear will nothing remain unseen.”\n\nAs their conversation reached the second watch of the night, a great thunderclap shook the prefecture with a single peal. The Master laid his head on his arm and passed away, on the twenty-second day of the month.\n\nThat night, the Master knocked at the gate of the wine inspector Guo Fuzhong. Guo, who had never believed in such things, came out to greet him.

After seven days, his spiritual form remained unchanged, and he was buried at Youxian.\n\nEarlier, while the Master resided at Zihua Hermitage beside Kunjian’s Zijin Mountain, dozens of great pines nearby turned white in their branches and leaves, remaining half-green for half a year. The Master sighed and said, *“The pines’ whiteness—could it be for me?”* In the first month of the twenty-fourth year, a *Changsheng* ritual was held in Changyang.

      "translated_text": "Master Tan Chuduan was initially named Yu, styled Boyu. Later, he was named Chuduan, styled Tongzheng, and given the sobriquet *Changzhenzi* (Master of Eternal Perfection) by the Patriarch. His family had long been natives of Ninghai. He was born on the first day of the third month in the first year of the *Tianhui* era of the Jin Emperor Taizong.\n\nFrom birth, his bone structure was extraordinary. At the age of six, he accidentally fell into a well. His family rushed to rescue him, only to find him seated calmly atop the water. When pulled out, he was unharmed. Another time, a fire broke out in his home, and a massive beam collapsed before his bed. Though he was fast asleep, when called to wake, his demeanor remained composed, as if nothing had occurred—people already knew he was no ordinary child.\n\nAfter entering school, he memorized texts with remarkable speed, surpassing his peers. At ten, he began studying poetry. One day, a relative pointed to a wooden grape trellis and asked him to compose a verse. His lines read: *\"One day I shall climb the azure dragon’s frame— / All who see will crane their necks to gaze.\"* The crowd marveled at his poise.\n\nAs he grew, he became unrestrained and careless of appearances, yet was renowned for his filial piety and righteousness. He delved into the classics and histories, mastering all, and was especially skilled in various styles of cursive and clerical script. Once, while drunk in the snow, he contracted a wind-induced paralysis. Knowing no medicine or stone could cure him, he secretly recited the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* to seek urgent relief. In a dream, the Great Emperor stretched across the sky, and the Master flew up to grasp him—only to find the Star Lords seated above while he bowed below. Startled awake, his resolve to follow the Dao was firmly set.\n\nIn the seventh year of the *Dading* era of Emperor Shizong, hearing that the Patriarch was staying at Ma Danyang’s home, he went directly and begged to be counted among his disciples. The Patriarch allowed him to stay the night in the hermitage. Though it was the depths of winter, he lay on seaweed without suffering the cold. The Patriarch extended his foot, bidding him hold it. Soon, sweat poured from him as if he were in a steamer. At dawn, the Patriarch used leftover water from washing his hands to cleanse his face, and his long-standing illness vanished at once. From then on, he devoted himself wholeheartedly to serving the Patriarch for life.\n\nOne day, his wife, Madam Yan, grew suspicious of his prolonged absence and came to inquire. The Master abruptly left her.",

      "translated_text": "The Patriarch further commended his resolute renunciation and thus transmitted to him secret instructions, bestowing upon him his present name and title. He also presented him with a verse containing the words *\"Dazhen\"* and *\"Tanyu,\"* making his approval unmistakably clear.\n\nIn the eighth year, he followed the Patriarch into seclusion among the mist and clouds of Kunyu. In the ninth year, he accompanied him to Lushan in Huang County, at the Yan Zhen Guan. Near the place where the True Lord Lu had attained transcendence, the Master inscribed a poem on the western wall of the Jade Emperor’s Hall, with the lines:\n*\"Faint and fleeting, the wheel departs without return,\nPhoenix glue and crane chariot shatter the clouds in flight.\"*\n\nThat winter, he traveled with the Patriarch to Liang. In the spring of the tenth year, the Patriarch shed his mortal form at the Wang family inn. Together with Danyang and others, he carried the immortal remains to be buried in Liujiang Village on Mount Zhongnan, where they observed mourning for three years.\n\nIn the fourteenth year, he returned to the Pass and journeyed to the Chaoyuan Palace in Luoyang, where he inscribed a poem:\n*\"Since the Purple Edict summoned the Perfected One away,\nWho now shall succeed as the Great Luo Immortal?\"*\nThe Chaoyuan Palace was where Huang Langranzi had attained transcendence, and thus it was cherished by all near and far.\n\nIn Xiuwu, there was a man named Zhang Bage, who behaved as if mad or possessed, yet those who recognized his state deemed him a man of the Dao. One day, he cried out in the marketplace: *\"The one who comes is Master Tan, steward of the immortals!\"* Later, he resided in a hermitage at the Jun Temple in Xinxiang. Passing through Huojia County, he once again took lodging at an inn in the northern outskirts of Weizhou.\n\nThe temple official of Xinxiang, Wen Liu, suddenly saw the hermitage aglow with lamplight one night. Peering inside, he found the Master sitting alone before a fire. Wen bowed before him, and the Master acknowledged him slightly before vanishing without a word. Wen waited long, but the Master did not return. Approaching, he found no trace of him and hastily summoned the Daoist assembly to report the matter. They sent Zhu Si to Weizhou to inquire, and the innkeeper said: *\"The Master arrived here and has not left.\"* Zhu returned and informed the assembly, whereupon they realized it had been his yang spirit.\n\nIn the fifteenth year, while begging for alms at Erzu Town in Cizhou, a madman asked: *\"Where do you come from?\"* and suddenly struck the Master’s mouth with his fist, causing blood to flow and teeth to break. Yet the Master’s countenance remained unchanged. He spat the teeth into his hand, danced and leapt, and returned to his lodging. Those who witnessed it were enraged and wished to bring a lawsuit before the authorities, but the Master only said: *\"I thank him for his compassionate instruction.\"* At the time, Danyang was in Guanzhong and, hearing of this, praised him, saying: *\"One punch dissolves a lifetime of karma.\"*\n\nSuch were the marvels witnessed in the Master’s life.\n\nIn the sixteenth year, he arrived at Baijiatan in Luozhou. A farmer there had been ill for months, with no cure in sight. In a dream, he encountered a Daoist of imposing stature, who gave him a red medicine. Upon taking it, he recovered at once. The next day, seeing the Master, he exclaimed in astonishment: *\"This is the master who gave me medicine in my dream!\"* He wished to repay him with goods, but the Master declined and departed.\n\nOnce, he and Wang Silang of Junzhou prepared *Cunjin* pills together. The portion the Master received cured all ailments without fail, while Wang’s portion was only fourteen or fifteen percent effective. When they exchanged portions, the results remained the same. Only then did they realize that the efficacy lay not in the medicine alone, but in the divine power of the Dao and its methods.\n\nIn the seventeenth year, passing through Gaotang County, he encountered Wu Liu, a teahouse keeper who diligently served traveling Daoist adepts. The Master left behind the characters *\"tortoise\"* and *\"serpent\"* to hang in his shop, though Wu did not yet know they were from the true Master Tan. One day, a fire broke out in the neighboring houses, spreading widely, yet Wu’s shop alone remained untouched. People compared the two characters to the Pure Yang Perfected One’s fire-averting talisman. The Pure Yang had once left an inscription at a wineshop in Boxing County, and when the county was engulfed in flames, that shop alone was spared. Such talismans were commonly spoken of at the time.\n\nAnother time, while begging for alms in Yicun, he boarded a newly built boat to cross the river. When the vessel was about to enter the water, the gathered crowd pulled it, but their strength was insufficient to move it. The Master lent his aid, and it glided forward effortlessly. Thereafter, whenever monks or Daoists crossed the river, the boatmen willingly offered their hands to assist.\n\nTraveling east, he reached the north of Yangwu County. Rising in the night, he saw the Northern Dipper’s stars shift and revolve like a wheel. He hastily called the Daoist assembly to observe. The stars were then like parrot eggs, swaying unsteadily, but after a long while, they returned to their original positions. From then on, the Master recited the sacred name with utmost reverence.\n\nAt Qimen Town in Weizhou, Shi Kongmu asked the Master why he chanted so diligently. The Master replied: *\"All should chant. This year, there will be a great flood.\"* The assembly did not comprehend, but that year, the Yellow River breached its banks at Wanghongfu.\n\nIn the twentieth year, he journeyed west again to Xili Hermitage in Tongzhou. Disciples sought his calligraphy, and he invariably wrote the characters *\"tortoise\"* and *\"serpent,\"* the brushwork vigorous, evoking the coiled forms of dragons and snakes. To all who requested his writing, he gave these two characters. It was a veiled indication of his return date, though none initially understood. On the first day of the fourth month in the *yisi* year, he shed his mortal form, and the prophecy was fulfilled.\n\nIn the twenty-first year, while the Master was at the Pure Yang Cave in Huayin, sores appeared on his head. He said: *\"Am I about to die?\"* The assembly did not know how to respond. After a long while, he said: *\"I will not die now. If they appear on my feet, then I shall die.\"* Then he addressed the assembly, saying:\n*\"Six years to refine away the fire of ignorance,\nTen years to cultivate the elixir of bone-transformation.\nSerene and unobstructed, the empty hall,\nI know I’ve leapt beyond the gate of life and death.\"*\n\nHe also said:\n*\"Just ten years of learning to be foolish,\nWandering carefree, east and west.\nIf you ask about the Wind Child’s practice,\nIt’s when the fire dies with a soot-covered face and unkempt hair.\"*\n\nLater, he arrived east of the Chaoyuan Palace in Luoyang and obtained several acres of vacant land, where he built a hermitage and resided.\n\nIn the twenty-fifth year, he dreamed of Chongyang and Danyang, who informed him of the date of his immortal ascension. He instructed his disciples to prepare his funeral arrangements. Just then, sores appeared on his body, and he wrote a lyric:\n*\"A thunderclap at the moment of supreme harmony,\nBursts forth with a myriad rays of spiritual light.\nThe dragon, meeting swift thunder, sheds its old skin,\nSubtle and profound, golden light shoots from the crown and flies.\nOne nature hastens to the Jasper Pool,\nTo follow Danyang in companionship.\nClearly seen—the wondrous truth of Changzhen,\nSpontaneously arising, the yang spirit returns alone.\"*",

      "translated_text": "In the spring of the ninth year of the Dading era under Emperor Shizong of Jin, the master discovered two *gāthās* inscribed upon a neighbor’s wall in a place no one else could reach. The ink was still moist, and the final line read: *\"Wuguan, land where true immortals nurture nature— / One must become a deathless, long-lived man.\"*\n\nThat year, in the ninth month, the Patriarch arrived from the east with his disciples Danyang and Changzhen. The master and his mother both went to pay their respects. At first sight, the Patriarch asked him, *\"Do you understand the words upon the wall?\"* The master remained silent, and the four exchanged glances and smiled—the very wonder of *\"the Dao present in a glance.\"*\n\nThe Patriarch then bestowed upon him a poem:\n*\"After fishing, you return and see a turtle once more—\nAlready you know your place among the ranks of immortals.\nThe call of the mallet summons your intent—\nLeaping forth from waves ten thousand fathoms high.\"*\n\nThereafter, he conferred upon him a Daoist name.\n\nShortly after, the master followed the Patriarch to Liang, where he joined the three disciples Ma, Tan, and Qiu. One day, the Patriarch showed the four a poem containing the line: *\"I hasten to Penglai to first pay homage to my master.\"* He also said, *\"My parting words to the world I have left with Lü the Daoist in Luan Village, Chang’an.\"*\n\nTen years later, the Patriarch ascended in *feathered transformation*. The master and the three disciples carried his coffin back to Zhongnan for burial. They dwelled in a hut beside his grave for three years, each then departing as they wished.\n\nThe master and Changzhen then traveled east to Luoyang. Changzhen resided at Chaoyuan, while the master took up lodging in the Earth God’s Temple within the city market, where he remained silent for three years. Later, he moved to Yunxi Cave in the northeast of the city. Disciples gathered daily, and one day, he pointed to the ground and said, *\"Beneath here lie three wells.\"* They dug over two *zhang* deep and found a spring gushing from below. When asked how he knew, he replied, *\"This was my dwelling in a former life.\"*\n\nTwenty years later, the master pointed to the Feng family garden to the right of his hut and said, *\"This shall be my green burial ground.\"* Forty years later, the pines in the garden withered, and the watercourse reversed to flow westward. The land was then acquired without purchase. He had a stele carved and buried in the ground, inscribed: *\"When this green ground flourishes, this stele shall stand.\"*\n\nThe following year, he traveled east to Lai. When the Perfected Changchun journeyed west and passed through Yunxi, his disciples recounted the master’s parting words. Later, in the second year of the Da’an era under the Prince of Donghai, officials transporting grain discovered the plaque of *\"Changsheng Abbey.\"* By the third year of the Xingding era under Emperor Xuan, forty years had passed. The Feng family sold their garden, and Cai Qingchen acquired it for a hundred taels of silver. He invited the master’s disciple, Yufeng, to reside as abbot. Officials felled the pines and catalpas to build watchtowers and ramparts, then constructed a cloud bridge to channel the encircling waters, directing them to flow west of the abbey for the city’s defense. All the master’s words were thus fulfilled.\n\nAfter arriving in Lai, he built a hut and resided there. Twenty-two years later, he returned to Wuguan. There, the mystic wind flourished, and disciples from all directions gathered in ever greater numbers. The master then annotated the *Dao De Jing*, the *Huangting Jing*, and the *Qingjing Jing*.\n\nThat year, Danyang arrived from Guanzhong, and the master received him in full ceremonial attire. Danyang reproached him for extravagance, but the master countered, *\"I have heard that those who cultivate the Dao consume ten thousand taels of gold each day.\"* Danyang replied, *\"Consuming ten thousand taels of gold each day is precisely why one should wear coarse robes and eat plain fare.\"* In the end, he was recommended to officiate the *jiao* rites in Laizhou.\n\nOn the twenty-second day of the twelfth month in the twenty-third year, Danyang ascended in *feathered transformation*. The following year, in the first month, Jiang Shoujing invited the master to preside over the *jiao* rites in Changyang. Between the hours of *si* and *wu* on the eighteenth day, Hu Zhang, Xu Shaozu, and others suddenly saw auspicious cranes circling in the sky. The Patriarch appeared in a crimson robe and cloud crown, while Danyang, with his three topknots, manifested amidst the colored clouds.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the fourth month, during the *jiao* rites in Dengzhou, a mirage of a sea market appeared at Zhudao Island. After Danyang’s passing, the master and Yuyang jointly oversaw the burial. They guarded the tomb for a hundred days before sending the disciple Zhang Shunzhen to Luoyang with a letter, inviting Changzhen to assume leadership of the teaching.\n\nOne day, the master said to Shunzhen, *\"The affairs of the teaching do not rest with me. Danyang has attained the wandering immortals, while I have attained audience with the Primordial. Later, in a letter, he spoke of his impending departure and entrusted me with the leadership of the teaching.\"*\n\nThat year, in the fifth month, a drought struck Deng Prefecture. The prefect invited the master to pray for rain, and the sea market reappeared at Zhudao Island. The next day, Danyang manifested to the northwest of Yingxian Bridge, and on that day, the rains came in full.\n\nIn the twenty-ninth year, the master succeeded Changzhen as leader of the teaching. In the second year of the Mingchang era under Emperor Zhangzong, the Emperor’s son-in-law, the Commandery Prince, was stationed in Laizhou. Seeing many turn toward the Dao, yet finding nothing extraordinary in the master’s appearance, he grew suspicious. He ordered the military officer Le Wujie to arrest him and throw him into prison.\n\nMoments later, the townspeople saw the master in the southern part of the city, conversing with Daoist friends as usual. Zheng Yazhu, the jailer, also saw him and assumed he had escaped. When he checked the prison, the master was fast asleep. The two men were astonished and reported what they had seen. The prince immediately ordered his release.\n\nLater, Wen Dihan Mingwei of Weizhou came to visit and stayed for three days. The master told him, *\"You must return quickly—your hut is about to collapse.\"* Upon returning, he found his hut had indeed collapsed, and someone had died in the accident.\n\nIn the winter of the second year of the Cheng’an era, the master was summoned to the capital and lodged at Tianchang Abbey. When questioned on the profound mysteries of the Dao, his answers pleased the emperor. All who saw him, from officials to commoners, held him in reverence. The Ministry of Rites granted him five abbey plaques: *Lingxu*, *Taiwei*, *Longxiang*, *Jixian*, and *Miaozhen*.\n\nThe following year, in the third month, he received an imperial decree to return to the mountains and greatly expanded the grounds of Lingxu Abbey. Wu Liu, Xian Gaoming, and Yuan Zhe, fearing the master’s strictness, secretly plotted against him. The master sent Hao Mingqing to admonish them: *\"I have not yet attained the Dao, and my temper is hasty. Please seek other teachers and friends.\"* The two men looked at each other and said, *\"The master knows even the thoughts in our hearts.\"* They then apologized.\n\nMaster Liu the Barefoot fell ill and did not recover for a month. He came to beg for an early release from life. The master struck the ground with his staff and said, *\"In the past, you committed a year-long transgression against the Dao. In the worldly reckoning, merit may offset transgression, but in the hidden principles of the unseen, merit and transgression each receive their due reward.\"*",
      "overlap_context": "d, the master was orphaned and served his mother with such filial devotion that it became widely known. His mother, too, harbored a desire to retreat from the world. Mount Taiji lay two *li* south of Wuguan. On its southern slope was the Valley of Daoists, where Zheng Daozhao, former governor of Guangzhou, had attained the Dao. The master often lingered there.\n\nIn his youth, his mother arranged a marriage for him. But he, having long cherished the aspiration to cultivate the Dao, firmly refused.",

      "translated_text": "The past transgression of one year may be offset by a year’s merit. Now that we have met, a month’s merit shall suffice.\" Thereupon, Liu swore an oath, and his illness immediately healed.\n\nIn the second year of the Taihe era, the master presided over a jiao ritual in Binzhou. In mid-winter, after a light snow had cleared, the moat of the old city refroze, and upon its surface appeared jade blossoms and coral-like trees, numbering no fewer than a thousand. There were also some two thousand apricot blossoms, while the smaller branches, sprawling like olive boughs, were too numerous to count. All who witnessed this marveled, saying, *\"If even ordinary sincerity can move heaven and earth and stir the spirits, how much more fitting is it that a man of the Dao should evoke such wondrous responses?\"*\n\nLiu Zhaoyi, Vice Administrator of Dongjing and Military Commissioner of Dinghai, and Liu Shiru, having retired from office, befriended the master and found great affinity with him. In the third year, on the first month, the two gentlemen requested to formally acknowledge him as their teacher. The master declined, saying, *\"You are both renowned ministers of our age, and I am deeply honored by your regard. Yet I am soon to depart this world and am unworthy to be your companion.\"* He then presented them with a verse:\n\n*\"At the very peak of the steepest climb,\nwhy not brush one’s sleeves and turn away?\nI must now follow in those footsteps,\ngazing back toward the realm of stillness.\"*\n\nThe two men read it with sorrow.\n\nOn the twenty-eighth day of that month, the Prince of Zichuan invited the master to preside over a jiao ritual and inquired as to when he would attend. The master replied, *\"In eight days.\"* On the sixth day of the second month, the master ascended in transcendence—indeed, it was the eighth day.\n\nShiru mourned him with a poem:\n\n*\"In our later years, we grew close,\nforgetting rank as we sat face to face.\nEach day I waited, hoping you would come,\nonly to be stunned by your sudden departure, weeping with all who knew you.\nHearing the stream’s murmur, I recall your boundless eloquence;\nseeing the mountain’s hue, I think of your serene form.\nNow who remains as a recluse in these woods?\nLingxu stands desolate, locked in deep spring.\"*\n\nAt the time of his passing, he was fifty-six. In the first month of the sixth year of the Zhiyuan era of the Great Yuan, he was posthumously honored as *\"Perpetual Life, Cultivator of Transformation, Radiant Virtue Perfected.\"* His works, including *The Idle Immortal of Grand Emptiness*, *Banyang*, *Great Completion*, *Great Harmony*, *Divine Radiance*, and *Records of the Utmost Truth*, circulated widely.\n\n---\n\n**Qiu Chuji**\nThe master’s name was Chuji, styled Tongmi, and he was known as the Long Spring Master. A native of Dengzhou’s Bingxia, his family had long been prominent. In the sixth year of the Dading era of Emperor Shizong of Jin, at nineteen, he secluded himself on Kunqian Mountain. The following year, hearing that the Patriarch Chongyang resided at the Quanzhen Cloister in Ninghai, he immediately went to study under him. Chongyang presented him with a poem:\n\n*\"Fine as golden scales playing in azure streams,\nyou seek the fragrant bait and take the hook.\nGently I draw in the line,\npulling you into Penglai, forever free.\"*\n\nHis esteem for Chuji was evident.\n\nIn the spring of the eighth year, he followed the Patriarch to reside amidst mist and clouds, spending autumn and winter in Wendeng. The ninth year, he accompanied the Patriarch—along with Danyang, Changzhen, and Changsheng—on travels to Liang. The Patriarch instructed them day and night, showing particular earnestness toward Chuji compared to the others. Soon after, the Patriarch ascended in transcendence, and the four disciples escorted his coffin to be buried in Zhongnan. They guarded his tomb for three years before each departing for their own paths.\n\nThe master dwelled by Fan Brook for six years and at Dragon Gate for seven. The truths of nurturing the authentic, which he had received from his teacher, he sometimes expressed in songs and poems, and thus his reputation grew. At the invitation of Jiagu, the Military Commissioner of Jingzhao, he returned to Zhongnan to propagate the Patriarch’s teachings.\n\nIn the twenty-eighth year, Emperor Shizong summoned him for an audience and inquired about the supreme Dao. The master first expounded the essentials of prolonging life and preserving destiny, then spoke of the difficulties in maintaining prosperity and safeguarding achievements. He added, *\"Arrogance and excess in wealth and status are common human tendencies. One must remain vigilant to guard against them. If this can be practiced consistently over time, one is not far from the Dao of immortality. Deceitful illusions and strange phenomena are not what I have heard of.\"* The emperor praised and accepted his words, lodging him in the west of Wanning Palace for ease of consultation.\n\nIn the fifth month, he was summoned to Changsong Island. In the seventh month, he was received again, and the master elucidated the profound principles. He presented *\"The First Bend of Jade Terrace\"* and composed five poems by imperial command. The next day, the emperor bestowed peaches from Shanglin, which the master had not eaten in over a decade. On this occasion, he partook of them, considering it a gift from above.\n\nIn the eighth month, he was granted permission to return to Zhongnan and offered a hundred thousand coins, which he declined. The twenty-ninth year saw the passing of Emperor Shizong. The master encountered the funeral procession and composed a poem in mourning.\n\nIn the first year of the Mingchang era of Emperor Zhangzong, he returned to Bingxia and greatly expanded the abbey, which was bestowed the plaque *\"Grand Emptiness.\"* In the tenth month of the third year, during the Zhiyang jiao ritual, several riders suddenly approached from the west.

As he invoked the deities, a thunderous rumble shook the Celestial Gate. A crimson glow descended from the North Star, illuminating the earth so brightly that even the minutest details were discernible.\n\nIn the seventh year of the Taihe era, the imperial consort bestowed a complete Daoist canon, which was conveyed by courier to Bingxia, where the Marquis of Donghai Commandery received it.

In the second year, he wrote the *Record of the Opening of Heaven*.\n\nIn the fourth year of Emperor Xuanzong’s Zhenyou era, the master resided in Dengzhou.

I have heard that you, Master, embody truth and follow the rules, possess vast knowledge and deep learning, trace the subtle to its source and exhaust principle to its end—your Dao is profound, your virtue resplendent. You carry the legacy of the ancient noble man and hold the refined conduct of a perfected transcendent. Now, learning that you still dwell in seclusion within the old borders of Shandong, my heart yearns for you without cease.

Hearing the Master was in Laizhou, he was joined by Wu Yan and Jiang Yuan of the Yidu Pacification Office, who offered twenty riders for the journey. Upon reaching Yidu, its commander, Zhang Lin, provided four-horse chariots. Passing through Weizhou, they were met by the prefect of Qinghe. By the twelfth month, they arrived in Donglai, where the imperial summons was delivered. The Master, with a sigh, consented to the journey.\n\nOn the *gengchen* day of the first month, he selected eighteen disciples fit to accompany him. In the second month, they entered Yan, where the provincial minister Shimo provided lodging at the Jade Void Abbey. Zhonglu first sent a messenger ahead with a report, and the Master also submitted a memorial in response. In the fourth month, a grand ritual was held at the Supreme Ultimate Palace, where the Master ascended the Precious Mystery Hall to transmit the precepts. A crane came from the northwest, and as the talismanic slips were burned, one slip soared into the air, with five cranes circling and dancing above it.\n\nThe next day, the Master set out northward. Passing through Juyong, he encountered a band of robbers, who all bowed their heads in retreat, saying, “Do not alarm the Master.” In the fifth month, he arrived at the Dragon Sun Abbey in Dexing. On the Mid-Autumn Day, he conducted a ritual and, in the afternoon, transmitted the precepts. Though the assembly sat exposed in the open, the heat was intense, but soon clouds gathered above them like a round canopy, lingering for some time before dispersing. The abbey’s well, which barely sufficed for a hundred people, now yielded water without end.\n\nIn the eighth month, the Grand Tutor Yila invited him to reside at the Celestial Origin Abbey in Xuande. The Grand Tutor had built a Sagely Hall and an Ancestral Hall, wishing to adorn their walls with paintings. Though it was the tenth month, the painters declined due to the cold. The Master would not permit it, saying, “If even Zou Lu could turn back spring, would the dead sages and worthies not lend their aid?” When the work was completed, there was indeed no hindrance from the cold.\n\nThat month, Helabuhui returned with the Master’s memorial. An edict was issued, reading: “To the Perfected Realized One, Master Qiu: Having reviewed your memorial, I see that of those who answered the summons, only your Dao surpasses the Three Masters, and your virtue is weighty in all directions. I commanded my minister to hasten with the imperial carriage, seeking you across the seas, and now the time accords with your wishes—heaven does not oppose man. Though two courts repeatedly summoned you, you did not come; yet at a single invitation from a lone envoy, you rose at once.

The Master inquired about their local customs, to which they replied: “In the third year of the Jinglong era, Yang He served as Grand Protector, governing with such virtue that his benevolence endured to this day, and we still benefit from it.”\n\nIn the eleventh month, he arrived north of the great city of Yemisi. The Grand Preceptor Yila Guogong, along with Mongol masters, came bearing wine to welcome him. They pitched grand tents, and he halted his carriage there. The Grand Preceptor, citing the prevalence of Uyghur bandits and frequent thieves, feared unforeseen turmoil might arise. The Master said: “A man of the Dao drifts freely through the years, untroubled—even a blade at his throat holds no terror, so why fret over thieves before they appear? Moreover, the paths of good and evil never intersect to harm one another.” The crowd was thus put at ease.\n\nThat winter, he resided in the newly built palace of Dengduan. On the tenth day of the third month of the *renwu* year, Alixian arrived from the imperial encampment and conveyed to Zhonglu and Zhenhai: “Only you two have escorted the Perfected One here.

      "translated_text": "The Master replied: “That this mountain-dweller rose at the imperial summons was Heaven’s doing.” The Emperor, valuing his sincerity, had two tents pitched east of the imperial ministers’ quarters to house him.\n\nThe appointed day, the fourteenth of the fourth month, drew near when reports of mountain bandits arrived. The Emperor wished to lead the expedition himself but, after divining a more auspicious date, rescheduled for the full moon of the tenth month. The Master requested to return to his former lodging. The Emperor said: “Would it not weary you to come again?” The Master replied: “Twenty days will suffice.” The Emperor then asked: “But who will escort you?” Three days later, he ordered the emissary Yang Agou to lead over a thousand horsemen, including Uyghur chieftains, by an alternate route.\n\nIn the fifth month, they reached Yemisiqan, where officials welcomed the Master into the guest residence—it was the fifth day of the fifth month. Once settled, he found his lodging perched on a northern cliff, overlooking a clear stream plunging over ten *zhang*. The brook flowed from snow-capped mountains, its waters icy even in midsummer. When the heat grew oppressive, he would sit by the pavilion’s open windows, and at night, he slept atop the terrace of his chamber. In the scorching sixth month, he bathed in the stream. Such was his contentment in that distant land.\n\nFew visitors came to his residence. To pass the time, he amused himself with scriptures and composed a poem:\n*North beyond the Yin Mountains, ten thousand* li *and more,*\n*West past the lands of Dashi, half a year’s sojourn.*\n*In these far wastes, where customs are coarse, the Dao is hard to expound—*\n*So in this quiet, secluded chamber, I turn to my books.*\n\nIn the seventh month, he dispatched Alixian to present a memorial at the imperial encampment, seeking an audience to discourse on the Dao. On the seventh day of the eighth month, the Emperor’s rescript arrived. The next day, he set out, accompanied by the Grand Preceptor for several dozen *li*. On the twenty-second, Tian Zhenhai came to greet him. Upon reaching the encampment, the Emperor sent Zhenhai to ask: “Would you prefer to see me now or rest first?” The Master replied: “I long to enter your presence.” After the audience, he was offered fermented mare’s milk before taking his leave. The Emperor said: “Might you dine here daily?” The Master answered: “This mountain-dweller, devoted to cultivation, cherishes solitude.” The Emperor permitted him to do as he pleased.\n\nOn the twenty-seventh, the imperial cortege returned north. Along the way, the Emperor repeatedly bestowed gifts of grape wine, melons, and tea. In the ninth month, they crossed the pontoon bridge to the north. The Master, noting that the appointed time for discourse was near, petitioned the Emperor, who summoned the Grand Master Ahai.\n\nOn the night of the full moon, the Emperor had torches lit in the courtyard and drew his seat forward to receive him. The Grand Master Ahai and Alixian attended as the Emperor inquired about the supreme Dao. The Master said:\n\n“The Dao gives birth to Heaven and nurtures Earth. From it arise the sun, moon, stars, spirits, and all beings. Men know only that Heaven is vast, yet they do not know the Dao is vaster still. That which is light and pure becomes Heaven—Heaven is yang, belonging to fire. That which is heavy and turbid becomes Earth—Earth is yin, belonging to water. Man dwells between them, bearing yin while embracing yang. Thus, those who cultivate the Dao refine their practice by curbing excess, restraining desire, consolidating essence, and guarding the spirit, focusing solely on nurturing yang. When yin dissipates and yang is complete, one ascends to Heaven as an immortal, like fire rising. The ignorant, however, treat wine as their drink and delusion as their norm, indulging their passions, depleting essence, and harming the spirit. Thus, yang wanes and yin waxes, and they sink into the earth as ghosts, like water flowing downward.\n\nCultivating the true is like rolling a stone up a mountain: the higher it goes, the harder the ascent. A single misstep, and all prior effort is lost. Because it is so difficult, the world does none of it. The Daoist cultivates the true and refines the heart, thinking of nothing, like the empty void or still water. When the wind subsides, water is calm and clear, reflecting all things vividly. When the wind rises, water churns and muddies—how can it mirror anything? Man’s original true nature is as still as unmoving water. Yet the eye delights in color, the ear in sound, the tongue in flavor, and the mind clings to affairs. These senses arise in succession, like gusts whipping up waves. Taming the heart at first is exceedingly hard. With years of practice and deepening skill, one reduces and reduces again until reaching non-action.\n\nThe Daoist’s body is but one—yet even taming the heart is as difficult as it is for an ant. The Son of Heaven rules all within the Four Seas, reviewing myriad affairs daily—how much harder is it for him to tame his heart? If he can but moderate sensual desires and restrain his thoughts, he will gain Heaven’s protection. How much more blessed would he be if he could fully uphold the precepts? The ancients married to secure an heir, then abstained from desire once the heir was established. Thus, Confucius at forty was free from doubt, and Mencius at forty was unmoved. For men past forty, vitality gradually wanes. Your Majesty is now advanced in years—you should cultivate virtue and preserve your health to attain long life.”\n\nHe then explained the principle of taking medicine and sleeping alone: “Medicine is herb, essence is marrow. To replace marrow with herb is like a bag filled with gold—if you exchange gold for iron, over time the gold is spent, and only iron remains. What benefit is that? How is taking medicine any different? In food, lodging, treasures, and wealth, one should adhere to one’s station and not exceed it.\n\nBeyond the Four Seas lie countless lands and peoples, yielding many rare treasures. Yet none compare to the Central Plains, where Heaven has bestowed teachings on governing the state and cultivating the self, and where extraordinary individuals have attained the Dao and ascended to Heaven. The lands east of the mountains and north of the Yellow River are the finest under Heaven, producing fine incense, vegetables, fish, salt, silk, and hemp to supply the realm. Since ancient times, whoever held these lands held greatness—thus, dynasties have always prized them. Now they are entirely yours, yet war and fire have ravaged them, scattering the people. You should select capable officials to plan their restoration, reduce taxes appropriately, and ensure the state and army have enough cloth while the common folk recover and rest. This would achieve two goals at once and is also a means of seeking blessings.\n\nIf you appoint the unworthy, it will not only be of no benefit but will bring harm. When the Jin first gained the realm, they arose from the eastern lands, and the people of the Central Plains were not yet familiar with their ways. They enfeoffed Liu Yu in Dongping, allowing him to govern for eight years before reclaiming it—this, too, was a sound strategy for establishing a new dynasty.”",

The officials, generals, and commanders of the Hebei prefectures and subprefectures sent letters and memorials in such numbers that they converged like spokes to a hub. The Master replied: “While the royal house remains unsettled, the Daoist gate must first flourish. The opportunities for salvation are boundless, and its expansion knows no limit.” The regional commander was the first to devote himself wholeheartedly to reverence, lamenting only that he could not manifest in multiple forms to fulfill the people’s hopes.\n\nOn the first day of the second month in the jiashen year, the Master resided at the Qiuyang Abbey on Mount Jin. Shimo of the Xing Province of Yanjing and Liu Zhonglun, the commissioner for convenience, each presented memorials earnestly requesting his presence at the Taiji Palace. He granted their request and crossed the Juyong Pass. Earlier, when the Master had departed Wuchuan, his followers asked when he would return. He replied, “In three years.” Now, his words proved true.\n\nThat month, Helala arrived from the imperial residence and conveyed the decree: “Since the Divine Immortal has reached the Han lands, he may reside in any of Our cities as he wishes.” The assembled officials all said, “The Master has already agreed to the Taiji Palace; let there be no further discussion.” Thereafter, Daoist hymns and chants gathered in abundance, and the Mysterious Teachings flourished daily. He established eight assemblies: the Assembly of Equality, the Assembly of Eternal Spring, the Assembly of Numinous Treasure, the Assembly of Longevity, the Assembly of Illuminating Truth, the Assembly of Peace, the Assembly of Disaster Dispelling, and the Assembly of Myriad Lotuses. Those seeking Dharma names increased day by day, and he often taught them through songs and praises.\n\nAt times, he would return to wander his old garden atop Qionghua Peak, accompanied by five or six followers, and sit in leisure beneath the pines. Sometimes he composed poems himself; at others, they exchanged verses in response. As the evening sun lingered on the mountains, they remained serene, forgetting to return.\n\nIn the spring of the yiyou year, the Master broke off a branch of pear blossoms and bestowed it upon the lay disciple Zhang Quhua, a man of profound mystery. Zhang treasured the gift and placed it in a vase to nurture it. By autumn, it bore twenty-four fruits, no different from those grown on the tree itself. The people of the time regarded this as an auspicious sign. Quhua was the father of Chengming. The Master’s subtle intent was profound indeed.\n\nAt the Yanxiang Abbey stood a withered locust tree. The Master struck it with his staff and declared, “This locust tree shall live.” Today, it flourishes luxuriantly, surpassing all other locust trees.\n\nIn the ninth month, the pacification commissioner Wang Ji, observing that Mars had trespassed into the Tail constellation—a harbinger of disaster for the Yan region—prepared to perform a jiao ritual to avert it. He asked about the expenses, and the Master replied, “Even if a single creature is displaced, I still feel compassion. How much more for the borderlands?” In recent years, the people had suffered under heavy corvée labor, and both public and private resources were exhausted. “I shall provide from the abbey’s common holdings,” he said. “Simply have the officials purify themselves and await the ritual.” On the evening the jiao concluded, the pacification commissioner rejoiced and congratulated him, saying, “Mars has already retreated several lodges; we need no longer worry.” The Master’s virtue had moved so swiftly! The Master replied, “What virtue do I possess? Prayer and supplication have existed since ancient times; the only concern is whether one’s sincerity is lacking.”\n\nIn the fifth month of the bingxu year, the capital suffered a great drought. The provincial administration requested the Master to preside over a jiao ritual. The rains then came in abundance. The occasion was called “the Divine Immortal’s Rain,” and eminent scholars and great literati all composed poems in celebration.\n\nIn the fifth month of the dinghai year, another drought struck. The Daoist assembly in the capital requested another jiao ritual. The Master calmly addressed them: “Just as I was considering the jiao, you have all proposed the same. This is what is meant by ‘like minds think alike without prior agreement.’” He continued, “The first day shall be for the jiao to pray for rain; the second day, for the jiao to celebrate the rain. If rain falls within three days, it is an auspicious response to the jiao. Beyond three days, it is not the jiao’s rain.” Someone asked, “Heaven’s intent is not easily fathomed. If you make such a statement before the assembly, what if the timing is missed? Will you not invite criticism?” The Master replied, “This is not for you to understand.” Later, all unfolded as the Master had foretold.",

The Master said: “Heaven’s intent is unclear; even if you go, what benefit will it bring?” Alixian bowed twice and said: “If the king were to dispatch a great army, the people would surely suffer slaughter.” The Master replied: “Though you may not save them, it is still better than sitting idle.” He granted the request.",

All Daoist affairs were entrusted entirely to the Divine Immortal for disposition.\n\nIn the sixth month, the Master did not venture out. The following day, thunder and rain erupted violently. Someone reported: “The southern bank of Taiye Lake has ruptured, and water has surged into the Eastern Lake. The sound carried for tens of *li*. Lightning struck, and turtles and fish fled entirely; the pool then dried up. The northern mountain’s mouth also collapsed.”\n\nThe Master initially said nothing. After a long while, he smiled and said: “The mountain has crumbled, the pool has run dry—shall I go with them?”\n\nOn the fourth day of the seventh month, the Master addressed his disciples: “Long ago, [Master] Danyang once gave me a prophecy, saying: ‘After my passing, the teachings will flourish greatly. The four directions will often transform into Daoist villages, and the abbeys will all be granted names by imperial favor. You will also preside over grand palaces and monasteries, and there will be envoys bearing tallies traveling by post to oversee the affairs of the teaching. This will be the time when merit is accomplished, fame is achieved, and one retires in peace.’ Danyang’s words have all come to pass. I depart without regret.”\n\nOn the ninth day, he ascended Baoxuan Hall and left behind a verse:\n*Life and death, morning and dusk—all the same,*\n*Bubbles rise and vanish in the ever-leisurely water.*\n*Where faint light appears, the crow and hare leap;*\n*When the profound measure is at ease, it embraces seas and mountains.*\n*I cast off the eight directions as if they were a hand’s span;*\n*I exhale the ten thousand things as if they were a mechanism.*\n*Wild words fall like dust and grime from my brush—*\n*I entrust them to the deluded ears of men.*\n\nHe wrote this, then passed away, at the age of eighty.\n\nThe minister Liu Zhonglu, wiping away tears, sighed: “Since the Perfected One’s audience with the throne, ruler and subject have been in harmony with the Dao.

      "translated_text": "On the first day of the third month in the wǔzǐ year, Qinghe proposed constructing a hall for the Master at White Cloud Abbey, with the grand burial set for the ninth day of the seventh month. In the sixth month, continuous rains raised concerns of obstruction. Yet by the start of the seventh month, the skies cleared entirely. When the coffin was opened, his complexion appeared as if alive, and the onlookers formed a dense crowd. For three days, his immortal remains were enshrined in the hall, filling the air with an extraordinary fragrance that lingered for some time. Once his spirit was pacified, a heavy rain fell.\n\nCommissioner Wang Ji presided over the funeral, serving as the chief mourner, and personally inscribed the hall’s plaque with the words *Chùshùn* (\"Abiding in Compliance\"). In the first month of the jǐsì year of the Zhiyuan era, the Master was posthumously honored with the title *Chángchūn Yǎndào Zhǔjiào Zhēnrén* (\"Perfected One of the Long Spring, Who Expounds the Dao and Leads the Teaching\").\n\nHis poetic works, *The Fánxī Wūdào Collection*, circulated in the world.\n\n---\n**Volume Two of the *Continued Compendium of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao* concludes here.**\n\n**Volume Three of the *Continued Compendium of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao***\n\n**Wang Chuyi**\n\nThe Master’s name was Chuyi, a native of Dongmou in Ninghai. His sobriquet was Yuyang. In the second year of the Huangtong era of Emperor Xizong of Jin, on the eighteenth day of the third month, his mother, Lady Zhou, dreamed of red clouds swirling around her body. Startled awake, she gave birth that very day.\n\nAt the age of seven, he once collapsed to the ground, his breath suspended, and only revived after some time. His mother, alarmed, asked, “What happened to you?” He replied, “I only knew I was in a deep sleep and nothing more.” From this, the Master awakened to the principle of life and death.\n\nOne day, while wandering in the mountains, he encountered an old man seated upon a great stone, who said to him, “One day, you will rise to fame at the imperial court and become the patriarch of the Daoist teaching.” The old man then stroked his head and bade him depart.\n\nAnother time, he heard a voice from the void ask, “Do you recognize me?” He answered, “I do not.” The voice said, “I am the Lord of the Mysterious Court Palace.” Thereafter, he would sing wildly and dance madly, barefoot in winter’s cold, clad in a single garment, yet his countenance remained unchanged. Suddenly, he composed a verse and sang it aloud:\n\n*Why vie for fame? Why chase profit?*\n*Better to hear early and cultivate the heart-ground.*\n*One’s own cultivation is one’s own path;*\n*If one does not act for oneself, one is no better than the herd.*\n\nIn his youth, when someone broached the subject of marriage, he merely smiled and did not respond.\n\nIn the eighth year of the Dading era of Emperor Shizong, while the Master resided at Ox Immortal Hermitage in Wendeng, he was informed that the Patriarch had arrived. He immediately went to the Quanzhen Hermitage and requested to become his disciple. The Patriarch, recognizing him as a vessel of great capacity for the Mysterious Gate, granted his request.\n\nOn the last day of the second month, he followed the Patriarch to the Misty Cloud Grotto of Kunyu, where he received the orthodox Dharma and his present name. His mother paid homage to the Patriarch and also expressed her wish to study the Dao. The Master, knowing her purity, bestowed upon her the name Deqing and the title *Xuánjìng Sǎnrén* (\"Mysteriously Serene Laywoman\").\n\nIn the fourth month of the ninth year, while the Master was at Iron Tooth Mountain, the Patriarch, along with Danyang and several others, traveled from Wendeng toward Ninghai, passing through Dragon Spring. The day was scorching, and the Patriarch walked holding an umbrella, with Danyang and the others following. Suddenly, the umbrella soared into the sky and, from dawn until dusk, descended before the Master’s hermitage. Dragon Spring lay nearly two hundred *li* from Iron Tooth Mountain, and within the umbrella’s handle was found his present sobriquet. He was also called *Sǎn Yángzǐ* (\"Umbrella Sun Master\"), a name bestowed by the Patriarch.\n\nAmong the seven disciples, the Master ranked after Matan and Liu Qiu. Thus, the Patriarch once said, “The umbrella and bamboo unite as seven individuals,” corresponding to the sevenfold number of the golden lotus. He also remarked, “The bamboo of the golden elixir emerges from the crown, its fivefold radiance piercing the canopy of colored clouds.”\n\nIn the ninth month, as the Patriarch journeyed west, the Master secluded himself in Cloud Radiance Grotto. Often, he would stand precariously on the edge of a cliff, balancing on one foot for days without moving, earning the sobriquet *Iron-Footed Immortal*. After nine years of refinement, his heart-ground became luminous, and thereafter he frequently traveled between Qi and Lu.\n\nIn the autumn of the twenty-second year, while residing in Ninghai, the Perfected One Danyang arrived from Guanzhong. They lodged together at Golden Lotus Hall, where Danyang spoke to the Master in measured tones: “The Patriarch Chongyang traversed thousands of *li* to guide us, yet we have done little in return—does this not weigh upon our hearts? Moreover, if a realized adept benefits only himself and his merit does not extend to others, I fear this falls short of the great salvific aim. If we truly wish to illuminate the Patriarch’s virtue, nothing would be better than manifesting the Mysterious Response to bless living beings. You now hold the Dao and conceal your vessel, practicing self-cultivation alone—is this not improper?”\n\nThe Master replied, “Ah, the Dao is neither the same nor different; the difference lies in whether it is practiced or not. You, Master, embody the Dao within yourself and radiate virtue across the four seas, so that all under heaven revere and submit to you at a glance. There is no other reason—it is because the Dao flourishes and its practice is manifest. As for me, my practice is not yet manifest; for now, I merely act wildly to blend with the world.”\n\nDanyang found his words reasonable.",

      "translated_text": "In the twenty-seventh year, Emperor Shizong summoned the Master to court. In all his responses, he greatly aligned with the imperial will. He was lodged at Tianchang Abbey for an extended period. When the Emperor heard that someone had attempted to harm the Master with poisoned wine, he dispatched envoys to inquire about the wine’s origin. Though pressed repeatedly, the Master never revealed its source, merely claiming illness. The Emperor, upon hearing this, expressed even deeper admiration and praise. The Master requested to return to the mountains to attend to his parents, and the Emperor granted his wish.\n\nIn the twenty-eighth year, on the second month, the Master was again summoned to court. The Emperor ordered the construction of Xiuzhen Abbey, bestowing upon it a plaque inscribed in gold seal script, and instructed the Master to reside there. In the second month, he presided over the ritual for the Wanchun Festival. In the eighth month, he received permission to return home, along with a lavish gift of gold and silk, which he declined. In the twelfth month, the Emperor fell ill and sent envoys to summon the Master. The Master said to the envoys, “Why have you come so late? I fear I may not behold the imperial visage again.” The following spring, he encountered the mourning edict in Zhuo Prefecture and firmly declined further summons, returning eastward.\n\nIn the second year of Emperor Zhangzong’s Cheng’an reign, in the seventh month, the Master was summoned to the informal palace hall. The Emperor inquired about the Dao of nurturing life. The Master replied that it lay in non-action, purity, tranquility, minimizing selfishness, and curbing desires. When asked about the principles of nature and destiny, the Master said, “The teachings of internal alchemy—using the mind to circulate qi—are all rooted in non-action and spontaneity, mastering the transformations of creation. The profound and primordial Dao achieves without striving.” The Emperor said, “This is beyond what I can discuss.”\n\nHe then asked about governance and border affairs, and the Master’s responses all accorded with the imperial intent. The Emperor said, “Whenever I ask you something, you always know the answer. Why is this?” The Master replied, “It is merely by chance.” The Emperor said, “Do not decline my praise. I wish to hear your explanation.” The Master said, “Even a bright mirror can reflect all things—how much more so the mirror of heaven and earth, which illuminates all without exception? What can escape it? This mirror of heaven and earth is the wondrous clarity of one’s own spirit.” The Emperor sighed and said, “With purity and brightness embodied, one’s qi and will become spirit-like. When desires arise, their signs appear first. This describes you, Master.”\n\nThe following spring, the Master memorialized that his mother’s age neared ninety and requested to return to attend to her. The Emperor bestowed upon him an abbey plaque and the title *Tixuan Grand Master*, along with generous gifts. In the third year, the *guihai* year, the Emperor commanded the two abbots of Taiqing Palace in Bo Prefecture to preside over the *Putian* ritual, during which over a thousand individuals received the precepts and became Daoists. On the day the Master descended to attend, his disciples all gathered. The Master’s mother said, “I am now advanced in years—how can I return?”",

      "translated_text": "The Master said his mother’s lifespan might end in the seventh month of that autumn. She then spoke of neither clinging to life nor fearing death. When the time came, she fell ill, and the Master hastened to arrange her funeral. After twenty-five days, she passed away. On the day of her death, all present smelled an extraordinary fragrance, rich and lingering, while the sound of zither strings, pure and elegant, filled the air for some time before fading.\n\nThe former Vice Censor-in-Chief of Beiping, Bömolu, had long revered the Master’s teachings, honoring the Dao and holding it in the highest regard. Whenever he met the Master, whether foretelling the day rain would fall or revealing the place of their next meeting, every prediction came to pass. One day, he visited Shengshui to express his devotion, saying: “Of the divine immortals, I had only heard their names. But since meeting you, Master, every prayer I offer receives a gracious response. In my comings and goings, you foresee all, yet I, bound by worldly dust, cannot follow your cloud-wandering path. My circumstances thwart my wishes, leaving only regret.”\n\nIn the seventh year, the Yuan Consort donated a complete set of Daoist scriptures, which were conveyed by courier to Yuxu Abbey in Shengshui. Before the abbey’s water cave stood a massive rock, jutting out several *zhang* and looming over those who passed beneath, filling them with dread. One day, the Master gathered the assembly and declared, “This rock should be removed.” Hammers and chisels were raised, and for days they labored. The Master asked, “How much progress has been made?” They replied, “Only one percent.” The Master laughed and said, “How can you remove it?” He then went to the rock’s side, wielded a hammer, and struck it three times. The sound was like thunder, shaking the cliffs and valleys, and the rock fell. All who witnessed it were struck with awe.\n\nIn the fourth year of the *Zhenyou* era, Wen Deng’s magistrate, Wendi Han Gui-shou, invited the Master to return to Tianbao Abbey in the county. The following year, on the twenty-third day of the fourth month, the Master said to his disciples, “The immortals have summoned me.” With these words, he bathed, donned his robes and cap, lit incense, and paid homage to the ten directions before departing the world.\n\nThe Master’s songs and poems were compiled in the *Yunguang Collection*, which circulated in the world. In the sixth year of the *Zhiyuan* era of the Great Yuan, the first month of the *jisi* year, he was posthumously honored as *Yuyang Tixuan Guangdu Perfected*.\n\nEarlier, during the *Mingchang* era’s change of reign, on the fifth day of the fifth month, Liu Zhi of Laiyang County petitioned the Master, saying he had no heir. The Master replied, “You are wealthy and fond of propriety—how could you be without descendants? Yet I shall petition the heavens on your behalf.” On the fifteenth day of the sixth month, he visited Liu’s home, where Liu had prepared a feast. The Master said, “I have come to bestow an heir—how can I be received with ordinary wine?” Pointing to the northwest corner of the storeroom, he said, “The sealed jar there holds fine wine.” Liu went to retrieve it and found a vessel of warmed wine. The Master said, “Not only is this wine exceptional—your heir will be as well.” He then asked for paper and wrote a verse, later adding the four characters *sishi yingzhen* (“forty-four *yingzhen*”). The following year, on the fourteenth day of the fourth month, a son was born. Liu begged for a name, and the Master said, “I have already given him one.” After a long pause, Liu said, “Forty-four is plain to all—are the words *yingzhen* his name?” The Master replied, “This is the day of Pure Yang’s descent into the world—is he not an *yingzhen*?” Thus, he was named.\n\nAs for the Master’s other deeds—curing Chichi Jin’s chronic illness, reviving the condemned Pan Xin, lying in frozen snow at Zhao Shi’s gate, restoring the parrot to Qiang Huang’s perch, playing chess in winter clad only in a single robe, storing wine in a bottomless jar, summoning mountain roars and valley echoes when transmitting the Dao, and causing ghosts and spirits to emerge when inscribing talismans—such wonders were too numerous to record. These were but a few of the Master’s responses to the world, all of which are detailed in other records and thus not fully recounted here.\n\n---\n\n**Hao Datong**\n\nThe Master’s name was Datong, his courtesy name Taigu, and he was a native of Ninghai. *Guangning* was his sobriquet. Born on the third day of the first month of the third year of the *Tianjuan* era of Emperor Xizong of Jin, he came from a family of officials and was a younger cousin of Hao Chaolie. Orphaned young, he served his mother with great filial piety. Once, he dreamed of a divine being revealing to him the secret meanings of the *Book of Changes*, and from then on, he thoroughly understood the principles of yin and yang, calendrical calculations, and divination. Disdaining worldly splendor, he delighted in simplicity, concealing his virtue within the practice of divination.\n\nIn the seventh year of the *Dading* era of Emperor Shizong, the Patriarch arrived in Ninghai and, seeing the Master’s noble bearing and uncommon pursuits, was moved by the mechanism of “turning one’s back to sit.” The following evening, at Chaoyuan Abbey, he bestowed upon the Master two *ci* poems. In an instant, the Master awakened, as if a traveler lost on a ten-thousand-*li* journey had heard a single call and found his way home. This was due to the power of his inherent wisdom and the long-cultivated influence of past practice.\n\nAfter their first conversation, their bond deepened day by day. In the third month of the eighth year, the Master followed the Patriarch to Kunyu’s Yanzia Cave and requested to be counted among his disciples to seek the Dao. The Patriarch then named him *Lin* and gave him the Daoist appellation *Tianranzi*. He also cut off the sleeves of the Master’s tattered robe, saying, “Do not worry about lacking sleeves—you will achieve greatness on your own.” This was the intent of transmitting the Dao. The Master’s later names and titles were said to have been obtained by chance while traveling on the road to Fengxiang.\n\nWhile in Wendeng, the Master often carried a clay jar to beg for food. After half a year, he accidentally broke it. The Patriarch then inscribed a verse on it, saying:\n*“Shatter the true ash jar,*\n*Yet gain the Wind-Harm Abbey.*\n*Only when you awaken to the remnants*\n*Will someone call you ‘person.’”*\n\nIn the autumn of the ninth year, the four Masters—Ma, Tan, Liu, and Qiu—followed the Patriarch west, leaving the Master and Yuyang to reside at Chashan. Later, Yuyang, believing the Master lacked resolve, earnestly admonished and encouraged him. The Master then traveled west to visit the four Masters. At the time, the four were dwelling in a hut by the Patriarch’s tomb, observing mourning rites. When the rites concluded, the Master wished to stay with them. Upon hearing Tan Changzhen’s remark about “turning with the heels of others,” he set out the next day for Qishan, where he encountered a divine being who once again taught him the profound meanings of the *Book of Changes*.\n\nIn the fifteenth year, he sat beneath the bridge at Wozhou without speaking. Children often played with him, stacking bricks and stones into a pagoda on his head, warning them not to topple it. His head never turned, and even when the river flooded, he remained unmoved and unharmed.",

In the third year, the *guihai* year, the Emperor commanded the two abbots of Taiqing Palace in Bo Prefecture to preside over the *Putian* ritual, during which over a thousand individuals received the precepts and became Daoists. On the day the Master descended to attend, his disciples all gathered. The Master’s mother said, “I am now advanced in years—how can I return?”",

      "translated_text": "For six years he maintained this resolve, steadfast as described. Guo Changqian, Vice Prefect of Zhen Ding, passed by and dismounted to pay his respects, offering generous gifts. Hoping the Master would glance his way, he could not elicit even a look, and departed in awe.\n\nIn his twenty-second year, he resided in Zhen Ding, where each time he ascended the hall to lecture, hundreds from near and far gathered to listen. His question-and-answer verses, poems, and discourses on the *Book of Changes*, *Can Tong Qi*, and symbolic diagrams totaled over thirty thousand words, collectively titled *The Grand Antiquity Collection*. Later, in Xian Ping, he befriended the scholar Wang Huixian and his retinue of ten or more. Their divinations proved accurate eight or nine times out of ten, while the Master’s were infallible. Thus, Huixian and his circle revered him as divine, beseeching him to occupy the master’s seat and transmit his esoteric teachings. Through this, Huixian’s name resounded even at court.\n\nOnce, the Master wished to create *Book of Changes* diagrams and suddenly demanded a brush. His disciple Fan Yuanxi announced that the porridge was ready, to which the Master replied, “Bring it quickly—I am just now grasping the meaning.” Brush in hand, he dashed off thirty diagrams in a single morning. Whether foretelling the fire at Tianchang for Hou Zizhen, entering the dreams of Wang Zhenguo of Enzhou at night, discerning fortunes and misfortunes, predicting the success or failure of the Dao’s spread, or foreseeing the timing of military campaigns—whatever was spoken before him invariably proved true afterward. As Zhang Bangzhi (Zizhong) of the Historiography Bureau remarked, his deeds startled the eyes and ears of all. His disciples often recounted these wonders, though they are not recorded here.\n\nIn the twelfth month of the first year of Chongqing’s reign, on the thirtieth day, he shed his mortal form at the Xiantian Abbey in Ninghai, aged seventy-three. Three years prior, he had instructed his disciples to prepare his burial, and the appointed time came to pass as foretold. In the sixth year of the Zhiyuan era of the Great Yuan (jisi, 1269), he was posthumously enfeoffed as *Guangning Tongxuan Taigu Zhenren* (Perfected One of Vast Serenity and Grand Antiquity Who Penetrates the Mysteries).\n\n---\n\n**He Dejin**\nThe Perfected One Yuchan, surnamed He, named Dejin, hailed from Ganquan in Qinzhou. Once a minor official, he never took ill-gotten gains. Daily, he conversed and drank with a Daoist, laughing over profound mysteries. Later, the Daoist arrived with an owl perched on his arm, remarking, “This creature is strange—large-eyed yet blind to men.” Yuchan did not grasp his meaning. Soon after, the Daoist contracted a loathsome disease and died. Yuchan prepared a proper burial with full rites. Within months, an old woman arrived at his door, saying, “The Daoist who passed was my son. Now aged and without support, what am I to do?” Yuchan presented her with gold and silk. The woman replied, “If only I could open the grave and see my son once more, I would have no regrets.” Yuchan led neighbors to the grave, unsealed the coffin—and the corpse had vanished, leaving only the gifts for the woman. Turning back, they found the woman gone as well. Moved by this revelation, Yuchan abandoned his home and entered the mountains. Later, he encountered a perfected being and attained the wonders of the Ninefold Cyclic Elixir of Gold Fluid. Wandering Mount Zhongnan, he practiced his transmission, advancing daily in refinement until he achieved harmonious subtlety, wondrous efficacy, and divine communion. When he met Perfected Wang Chongyang, they became friends in the forest of immortals, and none knew his ultimate fate.\n\n---\n\n**Li Lingyang**\nThe Perfected One Lingyang, surnamed Li (his given name and courtesy name are unknown), was a native of Jingzhao. Taciturn and sparing of desires, he was learned and erudite yet devoted to the Dao of immortality. A Daoist transmitted to him the secret of the Embracing Unity Talisman and the Great Cinnabar of Fire. Abandoning the mundane world, he practiced diligently from dawn to dusk. Over years, he attained the highest mysteries. With Yuchan and Chongyang, he became a friend of the forests and springs of Zhongnan. Once, he told Chongyang, “One day, your Dao will transform the Nine Regions, and your teachings will spread across the Four Seas—beyond the likes of us.” In the *jichou* year of the Tai Ding era of Jin Shizong (1169), Chongyang brought the Four Perfected Ones to Bianjing and sent a poem to them:\n\n*With Master He and Master Li,*\n*Three of one mind from the first.*\n\nAfter Chongyang ascended to perfection, Danyang led Qiu, Liu, and Tan to pay their respects. One day, the two masters left money at a Zhongnan inn, instructing, “If three immortals—Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma—arrive today, host them.” When the Four Masters arrived, the innkeeper called out their surnames to greet them. Danyang laughed, “How did you know our names?” The innkeeper replied, “Masters He and Li left instructions beforehand, so I recognized you.” At the time, the two masters were staying at the Taiping Abbey. After dining, the Four Masters visited the abbey to pay their respects. From then on, within the gates of the Perfected, all addressed them as “Master Uncle.”\n\n---\n\n**Huangfu Tan**\nMaster Tan, whose given name was Tan and courtesy name Lüdao, bore the surname Huangfu. His lineage and origins are obscure. Some say he once lived in Linzi and Xiaqiu, where he mastered the arts of the Three Avoidances and Five Substitutions. Later, he wandered near Mount Emei in Shu. One snowy night, he heard a voice call out, “You possess the qi of the Dao—I shall deliver you.” Turning, he saw a Daoist beneath a thatched eave. The Daoist bade him lie down, soles touching. As he slept, warmth spread from his feet, suffusing his body and rising to his crown, as if bathed in the gentle breeze of spring. At dawn, the Daoist shook out his robes and departed. When Master Tan asked his name, the Daoist only said, “Seek me later at the Lingquan Abbey.” Later, at the abbey, he saw a portrait of the Tang recluse Zhu Taochui, whom the people of Shu called Perfected One Miaotong. Only then did he realize his encounter had been with Perfected Zhu.\n\nOne day, Master Tan traveled with another Daoist and again met Miaotong on the road. Miaotong handed him a section of winter melon and several scallions, saying, “Go ahead to the wine shop in the city.” Following his instructions, he arrived at dusk near the pass. The melon had transformed into a human head, the scallions into hair, and water splashed on his clothes left bloodstains. The gate officers seized him and his companion. Master Tan alone took responsibility, offering no explanation of their origins. At dawn, they were to be sent to the prefecture—but the melon and scallions had reverted to their original forms, and the bloodstains vanished. The officials, astonished, comforted and released them. Outside the gate, Miaotong was already waiting.",

Again, he led him onto a boat, raised his staff, and struck the water to demonstrate—each time the waves stilled, he struck again. After several repetitions, he turned and asked, “Do you understand?” Master Tan could only murmur in assent. Then he transmitted the secrets of the inner and outer elixirs.\n\nFrom that time on, wherever he went, he cultivated and maintained his practice, indifferent to cold or heat, seclusion or company. Even when seated at leisure, he never slept, and his outer ankles lay perfectly flat. One day, he saw a pearl of radiant flame at the crown of his head. He sang:\n\n*Atop the mountain, the red sun rises,*\n*Fresh sprouts the medicinal herb.*\n*I would entrust my heart’s affairs,*\n*Yet few know the zither’s tune—*\n*When the strings break, who will listen?*\n\nThose who recognized its meaning took it as proof of his elixir’s completion. Soon after, he traveled throughout the land, healing the sick and aiding all beings to accumulate merit and virtue.\n\nIn the twenty-seventh year of the Shaoxing reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Song, Empress Dowager Xianren suffered from an eye ailment that no imperial physician could cure. One night, she dreamed of a Daoist in yellow robes with long whiskers and broad ears. The Empress Dowager asked, “Can you heal my eyes?” He replied, “I can.” She said, “If you restore my sight, you shall be my master.” Upon waking, she found the dream strange and recounted it to Emperor Gaozong, who issued an edict to seek him out.\n\nAt the time, Master Tan was traveling in the south, calling himself an “eye doctor.” When Prefect Zhang of Lin’an saw his portrait, he recognized the likeness and dispatched men to find him in Jiankang. His name was then reported to the court. Summoned to the imperial audience hall, the emperor asked how he cultivated himself. Master Tan replied, “My cultivation of the self is like Your Majesty’s governance of the realm. When the heart is without action, the body is at peace; when the emperor is without action, the world is well-ordered.” The emperor approved of his words and informed the Empress Dowager.\n\nThe next day, he was summoned to accompany her to the Cining Palace. There, Master Tan respectfully exhaled and directed his *qi* toward the Empress Dowager. After a long while, the obstruction in her eyes cleared, and her vision returned. Recognizing him, she exclaimed with joy, “This is the master I saw in my dream!” From then on, the palace referred to him as “Master Immortal.”\n\nThere was a concubine, Lady Zhen, who had been bedridden for years and could only walk by hopping. The Empress Dowager ordered Master Tan to direct his *qi* toward her as well, and immediately she was able to walk normally. As he prepared to return to the mountains, he left a fan in the palace, saying, “If anyone suffers from chills or fever, fanning them with this will bring recovery.” Soon after, many in the palace fell ill with malaria, and the fan proved effective for all.\n\nOn the day of his farewell audience, both the emperor and the Empress Dowager bestowed lavish gifts, but Master Tan accepted only incense, tea, and clothing. The emperor held him in high regard. As he departed, he commanded that imperial incense be offered in prayer at the Zhangren Temple on Mount Qingcheng. After the rites were completed, Master Tan returned to the Anjing Temple to burn incense—this was the former hermitage of Miaotong. He then submitted a memorial requesting the renovation of the temple and composed an inscription for Miaotong’s portrait:\n\n*Perfected One of the Spirit Spring,*\n*Essence of Shu’s two lands.*\n*Attained the Dao by Ma Creek,*\n*Composed verses in thatched huts.*\n*Through ages you saved all beings,*\n*Revealing the near, yet not possessing.*\n*Only I know my master—*\n*I bow my head in reverence.*\n\nThe following year, he returned to the Xiandu Temple in Zhongzhou. Atop Pingdu Mountain stood a giant banyan tree, struck dead by lightning twenty years prior. Master Tan exhaled upon it and prayed, and within a month, its branches and leaves flourished anew. Wang Congdao recorded the event and had it carved in stone.\n\nLater, the emperor sent an envoy with a handwritten edict to express his regard, saying: *“Your pure and solitary bearing shines beyond the world, casting off the chaff of mundane dust, chanting poems amidst rosy clouds—truly a joyous life. Since we parted last autumn, a year has passed in the blink of an eye. My thoughts long for your words, my spirit reaches toward the distant. I imagine you meeting friends at Yuanlan on Mount Qingcheng, while the white clouds have no heart for the imperial capital. The autumn cold draws near—when shall we meet again? I hope you will soon fulfill your promise, for riding the *qi* and commanding the wind would be effortless for you. The Xiang River’s waves stretch white, osmanthus blossoms waft their fragrance, and the palace halls stand lofty. From afar, I yearn to inquire of the Dao, my heart ever open to your teachings. The lingering heat lingers in the season—may you preserve your clarity and emptiness.”*\n\nUpon receiving the edict, Master Tan set out at once. When he arrived, he was granted a purple robe, a black robe, and silk slippers, and was led by the Chamberlain of the Imperial Court to an audience. The emperor asked him about the way of long life and enduring vision. Master Tan replied that clarity, emptiness, and few desires came first—one must first reduce all desires and not let them run wild. “Ten thousand volumes of elixir scriptures are not as good as guarding the One.” The emperor praised him at length, saying, “A true perfected one.”\n\nFrom then on, word spread throughout the court and beyond, and all competed to call him “Perfected One.” Another day, the emperor asked again. Master Tan replied, “Immortal and Daoist are not inherently numinous—they accumulate essence and amass *qi* to become true.” Grasping the emperor’s intent, he sighed in admiration again and again, saying, “This is why he is a Perfected One.” He then inscribed the words on a fan and bestowed it upon him, along with copies of the *Daode Jing*, *Huangting Jing*, and *Yinfu Jing*.\n\nAt the time, the monk Kai of Suzhou, also a man who had heard the Dao, was summoned to court. Master Tan was already present. Though they had never met, when the monk entered, he bowed deeply to the emperor but, upon seeing Master Tan, immediately prostrated himself. Offered a seat, he declined. When asked why, he said, “The ranks of immortals have high and low—Perfected One stands above. I dare not sit.” Only when pressed did he sit on the floor.\n\nLater, Master Tan requested to return to the mountains, but the emperor detained him for the suburban sacrifice. The emperor was concerned about the prolonged rain, and Master Tan assured him it would clear. As he prepared to stay at Mount Qingcheng, the emperor sent another inquiry. Master Tan presented a poem:\n\n*At night, the stars in the sky shine bright,*\n*At dawn, the moon on the altar glows fair.*\n*The imperial enterprise stands firm, the restoration’s work,*\n*May the emperor’s reign endure for a hundred million years.*\n\nThat night, the skies indeed cleared. The emperor ordered a tent set up for Master Tan at the Jiahui Gate, providing incense, candles, food, and an array of gold vessels from the imperial collection. When the emperor returned, Master Tan greeted the imperial carriage of the retired emperor, who glanced at him and smiled faintly. That same day, he was summoned to a farewell banquet, where he composed a poem:\n\n*Each time I receive the sky’s smile,*\n*I bring spring to all things.*",

      "translated_text": "The emperor was overjoyed. Soon after, Master Tan again requested to return to the mountains, but the emperor firmly urged him to stay. Unable to refuse, the emperor ordered a hermitage built on Mount Lushan for ease of summoning him. He also had a portrait of Master Tan painted, inscribed with an imperial title—*Portrait of the Perfected Royal Uncle*—and composed a eulogy:\n\n*The scholar Royal Uncle Huangfu,\nBrow marked as one of the immortals.\nBy the Dao he revives the age—\nWho could reckon his years?\nA lone cloud drifts in the void,\nA solitary crane soars through the heavens.\nWith a laugh and a toss of his beard,\nHe merges with the natural.*\n\nThe portrait was sealed in a brocade pouch and entrusted to Zhang, the Director of the Palace Eunuch Service, to present to Master Tan. It was then brought back and kept within the palace. Later, it was moved to the Daoist abbey of the De Shou Palace, where the empress dowager donated gold for the construction of a hermitage. Master Tan, lifting the cloth bundle containing his Daoist robes, declined, saying, *\"This alone is my hermitage—there is no need for gold.\"* He steadfastly refused. The empress dowager then instructed Dong Zhongyong, an officer of the Imperial Pharmacy Service, to secretly tuck the gold into Master Tan’s sleeping mat before departing. When Master Tan discovered it upon setting out, he immediately sealed it and sent it to the Lin’an Prefecture for remittance. Upon his arrival at Mount Lu, the empress dowager once more dispatched an envoy bearing gold to bestow upon him, but he again firmly declined. Shortly after, an edict was issued to Jiangzhou, ordering that funds from temple offerings be allocated for his use. Only then, out of necessity, did Master Tan accept.\n\nBy the empress dowager’s decree, two grand *jiao* rituals were established across the land to pray for blessings upon the emperor and all living beings. The remaining funds were to be remitted, but the empress dowager would not permit it. Instead, she commanded the two chief ministers, Cao Xun and Bai Yun, the Recluse of the Cloudy Abode, along with Yong Shouning, to use the money—augmented with additional gold—to purchase two estates for Master Tan on the northern and southern slopes of the mountain. The northern estate was named *Bronze Plate*, and the southern *Cinnabar Cassia*, their annual income to be used for hosting wandering Daoist scholars. Master Tan then built his hermitage at Lotus Flower Grotto, where he settled a company of cloud-roaming adepts.\n\nIn the first year of the *Longxing* era of Emperor Xiaozong, the retired emperor sent an imperial letter to Master Tan, saying: *\"Since retiring to my separate palace, I have devoted myself daily to nurturing my spirit and cultivating my will. I long to see your noble presence and share in intimate discourse on the Dao. I pray you command your carriage to come soon, that we may enjoy a moment of leisure together.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Deeply moved by his unwavering devotion, the emperor expressed his utmost sincerity. Upon Master Tan’s arrival, he was summoned for an audience at Kangshou Hall and lodged in the Western Study of Xianying Abbey by West Lake. The emperor appointed Cao Xun of the Two Ministries as his companion and interlocutor, hosting banquets in his honor on multiple occasions.\n\nLater, when Master Tan journeyed to Mount Tiantai, auspicious lingzhi mushrooms sprouted in Kangshou Hall. The emperor again dispatched envoys from the Two Ministries to convey his concern and bestowed two hundred taels of aloeswood, along with a painted fan featuring lingzhi motifs, personally inscribed with an imperial encomium.\n\nAt the beginning of the *Qiandao* era, as Master Tan traveled to Mount Wudang, the retired emperor sent Chamberlain Chen Qiu of Deshou Palace to summon him, catching up with him in Xiangyang. Cao Xun of the Two Ministries was then ordered to welcome and attend to him along the way. In the second year of *Qiandao*, upon arriving at the imperial residence, Master Tan was again lodged at Xianying Abbey with an official companion. The following day, he was summoned for an audience and granted a banquet. The day after, the emperor visited his quarters, inviting him aboard the imperial barge for a lakeside excursion through the gardens.\n\nThereafter, Master Tan frequently attended imperial feasts, where the emperor inquired into the principles of cultivating truth. The emperor bestowed upon him a copy of the *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for Salvation*, inscribed in his own hand, while Empress Shousheng presented the *Scripture of Pure Serenity*.\n\nWhen Emperor Xiaozong first ascended the throne, he once transmitted an edict to summon Master Tan, who responded with a memorial of over a hundred words, urging the emperor to weigh punishment and virtue judiciously, curb desires, and govern in accordance with the principles of preserving life. Later, the emperor summoned him for a private audience in the inner palace, hosting an intimate banquet where he personally offered dozens of toasts and presented rare imperial incense and tea.\n\nIn the third year of *Qiandao*, on the retired emperor’s birthday, he wished to offer prayers at Mount Song, Mount Lu, and Mount Qingcheng. Believing Master Tan’s sincerity sufficient to move the divine, he entrusted him with the sacred incense of both palaces and sent him by imperial barge to Jiujiang. Upon reaching Mount Qingcheng, as Master Tan began his prayers, a yellow dragon appeared.\n\nEarlier, during the *Jingkang* calamity of Emperor Qinzong, Cao Xun of the Two Ministries had carried an imperial letter from Emperor Huizong back from Yanjing. Stranded at the Yellow River without a boat, he encountered Master Tan by the riverside at night. Master Tan bound reeds into a raft and ferried him across. Upon reaching the shore, Cao lay frozen and near death. Master Tan kindled the reeds to warm him, and after some time, he revived. When asked his name, Master Tan did not answer, saying only: *\"The Perfected Master Zhu sent me to ferry you across, for you are destined to stabilize the realm. Thirty years hence, we shall meet again in Qiantang.\"* With that, he departed.\n\nWhen Master Tan later answered the imperial summons and reunited with Cao, they recalled the past vow. Cao, recognizing his features, wept and bowed in reverence, thereafter treating him as his master. In a poem later gifted to Master Tan, Cao wrote:\n*\"I sigh for my solitary self in youth—\nby the Yellow River’s crossing, your kindness saved me.\"*\nThis recounted their earlier encounter.

      "translated_text": "Master Tan constructed a pavilion to house the imperial calligraphy bestowed upon him. The retired emperor named it the *Shaoxing Huànwén Pavilion* and commanded the two chief ministers to inscribe its plaque. Earlier, when the hermitage on Mount Lu was completed, the number of Daoist followers gathering for meals grew daily, and drawing water from the stream had become a hardship. One day, Master Tan took up a spade and led others to dig beside the hermitage. After no more than one or two feet, a spring gushed forth from a crevice in the rock—clear, cold, and sweet—remaining unfailing even in drought. When he later answered the imperial summons, the retired emperor happened to inquire about his mountain dwelling, and Master Tan reported the matter. Empress Dowager Shousheng, who was present, remarked: *\"Wherever Master Tan resides, divine beings must surely protect him.\"* The retired emperor then named it *Divine Spring* and bestowed two characters in his own calligraphy as a gift. In the ninth year of the Qiandao era, he again granted an imperial inscription—*Qīngxū Hermitage*—for the gate plaque, along with an annual allotment of ordination certificates for Daoist priests to maintain the incense and lamps.\n\nMaster Tan answered four imperial summons in all. After the retired emperor withdrew to the *Déshòu Palace*, his favor only deepened. Each time Master Tan arrived, banquets and rewards followed without fail, and rare delicacies were bestowed daily. When he returned a second time from Mount Qingcheng, he swept the dust from the roads to the capital, yet only the *Déshòu Palace* sent seasonal inquiries without cease. Envoys were repeatedly dispatched to summon him from the mountain, but he firmly declined each time.\n\nIn the autumn of the fifth year of the Chunxi era, he suddenly declared: *\"I am about to journey far—how can I not take leave of the retired emperor?\"* He prepared his belongings as if to depart for the imperial residence, but in the end, he did not go. On the twenty-third day of the ninth month, he dictated his final words and instructed his disciples to draft a posthumous memorial for presentation. He also composed farewell letters to all scholar-officials, Daoists, and Buddhists with whom he shared close bonds.\n\nThe next morning, he rose early, bathed, and donned fresh robes. At midday, he ascended the hall, gathered his followers, and burned incense. Taking the imperial calligraphy and the garments bestowed by the throne, he handed them to his disciples, saying: *\"I am about to wander to the realm of the formless. These were gifts from the retired emperor—they should remain to guard this sacred mountain. You who come after must succeed one another as abbots, passing them down in turn. Treasure and preserve them, and do not defy my instructions.\"* He added: *\"The Dao does not fail those who uphold it. All of you, strive on—farewell, farewell.\"*\n\nWith these words, he clasped his hands, let his feet hang down, and sat upon the rope bed, where he passed away. For three days, his body neither stiffened nor slumped; his complexion remained rosy and radiant, his beard and hair black as lacquer. When placed in the coffin, his flesh was still soft and warm.",

      "translated_text": "She often traveled to Hanzhou, and whenever she arrived, she would lodge at the home of Wang Zhixing, a court gentleman for attendance. The Wang family had hosted her for three generations. She treated Zhixing and his wife with great reverence, saying, *\"They were my parents in a former life.\"*\n\nIn the sixth year of Emperor Gaozong’s Shaoxing reign (1136), a great famine struck Shu. Zhixing purchased a concubine from among the refugees, a woman of striking beauty. Luo saw her and exclaimed in alarm: *\"How has this person come to be in your household? If she remains, disaster will follow—no small matter. I shall remove her.\"* She ordered several *dou* of water boiled, then took a basket of lime from beneath a turtle’s shell. Summoning the concubine, she covered the woman’s head with a cloth and poured the scalding water over the lime. Smoke billowed forth, and the concubine collapsed—revealing only a pile of withered bones. Luo asked: *\"Did she pass through a female broker when she arrived? Where is the broker now?\"* *\"At such-and-such a place,\"* came the reply. Luo hastily summoned the broker, and as the woman approached, she again covered the bones with a cloth. The remains transformed back into a human figure, her movements and bearing unchanged from before. Luo then returned her to the broker and reclaimed the purchase price.\n\nZhixing’s younger cousin, Zhiju, had passed the imperial examinations and was returning home. Luo encountered him elsewhere and handed him a sealed scroll, cautioning: *\"If you encounter misfortune upon returning home, open this.\"* Three days after arriving, he received news of his mother’s death. He opened the scroll to find a painting: an official in green robes riding a horse, followed by well-wishers, and at the rear, a coffin with mourners in funeral garb weeping behind it.\n\nLonghua Temple in Guangdu was the ancestral merit cloister of the Yuwen clan. Luo sat with the abbot, then suddenly rose and said: *\"Someone from your quarters is coming.\"* The monk asked in surprise: *\"Where?\"* *\"Into the ancestral hall,\"* she replied. The monk dismissed her words as absurd. The next day, a messenger from Yuwen Shizhong arrived—his wife, née Fang, had died the previous day.\n\nOnce, while staying in Yangzhou Garrison, she lodged at the Chen residence. One night, she rushed back from the privy, exclaiming: *\"Strange, most strange!\"* She explained: *\"Just now, four men in white scaled the wall and entered the garden.\"* The Chen household was alarmed, but Luo reassured them: *\"This does not concern you. By tomorrow morning, you will understand.\"* At dawn, the gardener reported that a ewe had given birth to four lambs.\n\nIn the thirtieth year of the Shaoxing reign (1160), she fell ill in Yanting and sent word to Wenjiang, requesting to be taken to the home of Li Zhi, the judicial commissioner. Li dispatched several servants to fetch her. Though her illness had improved, she set out on the road, warning her attendants: *\"To the left lies the route through Jintang—shorter and easier. However, I do not wish to take it. Proceed instead through Guanghan or another western road. Do not disobey.\"* The servants agreed but later disregarded her words, taking her to Gucheng Town instead. She died upon reaching Wenjiang.",

      "translated_text": "The people of Shu believed she had lived to the age of one hundred seventy or eighty.\n\n*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Embracing the Dao Through the Ages, Continued* – Volume Three (concluded)\n*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Embracing the Dao Through the Ages, Continued* – Volume Four\n\n**Sa Shoujian**\nThe Perfected Master Sa, named Shoujian, was a native of Nanhua. Some say he was from Xihe, and he styled himself the \"Guest of Fenyang.\" From youth, he harbored a heart for aiding others and benefiting all things. He once studied medicine but, having mistakenly killed a patient with his prescription, abandoned the profession. Hearing of the lofty Daoist arts of the thirtieth-generation Celestial Master, Master Xujing, as well as those of the two attendants, Lin and Wang, he sought to study their methods. Leaving Shu, he traveled to Shaanxi, where his traveling funds were exhausted. As he sat dejectedly upon a rock, three Daoist adepts suddenly appeared. Sa asked how far it was to Xinzhou, and the adepts inquired about his purpose. Sa replied that he wished to visit Celestial Master Xujing to study the Daoist arts. The adepts said, \"The Celestial Master has already ascended.\" Sa was dismayed, but one adept said, \"The present Celestial Master’s arts are also profound. I am acquainted with him and shall write a letter for you to visit him. I also have a method to teach you, by which you may sustain yourself daily.\" He then imparted the technique of \"chanting over jujubes.\" \"Chant over one jujube,\" he said, \"and you may take seven coins. Chant over ten jujubes in a day, and you will earn seventy coins—enough for your daily needs.\" Another adept said, \"I, too, have a method to teach you.\" He gave Sa a palm-leaf fan, saying, \"When someone is ill, fan them, and they will recover.\" The third adept said, \"I shall teach you the Thunder Rites.\" Sa bowed and received the teachings, all of which proved effective. One day, he chanted over a hundred jujubes but took only seventy coins for his daily use, distributing the rest to the poor.\n\nUpon reaching Xinzhou, he met the Celestial Master and presented the letter. The entire household wept, for it was in the hand of the thirtieth-generation Celestial Master. The letter stated: \"I and Attendants Lin and Wang have met Sa so-and-so and each imparted a method to him. You may now teach him the remaining texts.\" From then on, Sa’s Daoist arts flourished. Once, he lodged for several days in a city-god temple. The prefect dreamed that the city god told him, \"Master Sa has stayed here for days, making my dwelling uneasy. Please kindly send him away.\" The prefect went to the temple and drove Sa out. After traveling several dozen *li*, Sa encountered a man carrying a pig to the temple to fulfill a vow. Sa gave him a small bundle of incense, saying, \"After fulfilling your vow, place an incense burner and burn it.\" The man followed his instructions, and with a sudden clap of thunder, fire consumed the temple without spreading to the neighboring homes.\n\nThree years later, Sa arrived at a ferry crossing where no boatman was present. He poled the boat himself and placed three coins in it as payment for the crossing. As he cupped water to wash his hands, he saw a man in an iron crown and red robe, holding a jade axe, standing in the water. Sa rebuked him, saying, \"Who are you? Reveal yourself at once!\" The man stood to the side and said, \"I am Wang Shan, the city god of such-and-such a prefecture. Yesterday, the Perfected Master burned my temple, leaving my household of over three hundred without refuge. I am truly innocent, so I appealed to the Jade Emperor. The Emperor granted me this jade axe and ordered me to follow you. If the Perfected Master violates the celestial laws, I am permitted to act first and report later. I have followed you for three years, yet you have broken no laws. Today, when you placed coins in the boat, I realized there would be no opportunity for repayment. Now, I wish to become your subordinate general and carry out your decrees.\" Sa replied, \"Even if you follow me for another three years, it will be the same.\" He then memorialized the Jade Emperor, who promoted Wang to the rank of subordinate general. Thereafter, whenever Sa performed rituals, responses came as swiftly as an echo.\n\nHe once wrote a poem:\n*\"The Daoist arts upon the body are no trifling matter,*\n*Reflecting on precepts and conduct chills the heart.*\n*A thousand-year iron tree blooms with ease,*\n*But to emerge from Fengdu in a day is hard.\"*\n\nAnother poem read:\n*\"Speak pure words yet act with impurity—do not discuss the Dao,*\n*Disregard heaven’s laws and act recklessly.*\n*Abide by your nature and calm your spirit and qi,*\n*Why fear your name will not be recorded in the immortal realms?\"*\n\nAfter attaining the Dao, the Perfected Master traveled to Minzhong. One day, he sat upright and transcended.\n\n**Zhao Mayi**\nZhao Mayi’s origins are unknown. During the reign of Emperor Xizong of the Tang, when Huang Chao’s rebellion arose, Mayi took refuge in Mount Zhongnan. There, he saw dozens of Daoist adepts dwelling in the mountains. With no food to eat, he offered to work as a servant. Through this, he encountered an opportunity and attained the Dao. In the early Jianyan era of the Song Emperor Gaozong, he began wandering to Mount Qingcheng. After a long time, he entered the Jade Bureau of Chengdu to transcend. He built a hut from connected branches and wore a robe of hempen rags, earning the name \"Hemp-Clad.\" His form was withered like deadwood, yet his bones did not protrude, and his spirit shone with clarity. By day, he would walk and uproot any standing grass or trees he saw. By evening, he would scatter the uprooted plants across the road. No one understood his intent, nor did they see him eat or drink. When people prepared tea or wine to invite him, he sometimes ignored them, other times stayed to drink. When he offered tea to others, those who drank it found it exceptionally fragrant and refreshing. Mayi occasionally spoke of the Five Dynasties and the present dynasty, his words coherent and well-reasoned. If pressed for details, he would take the *Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment* from his sleeve and say, \"It is all here.\" High officials and nobles invited him, but he never went. Some said he had once been a soldier in the Five Dynasties, later discharged, and his discharge papers still existed. He despised the color black.\n\nOne day, he sat cross-legged and transcended. His body remained as pure and white as jade.\n\n**Liu Juzhong**\nLiu Juzhong was a native of the capital.",

      "translated_text": "In his youth, Liu Juzhong secluded himself on Mount Song, dwelling in its most secluded peak at a place called the Hermitage of the Crane-Tamer. Initially, he lived there with two companions, and every month or two they would descend the mountain to procure grain. The ascent was arduous, often requiring them to clamber up vines for an entire day before reaching the summit. The two companions, unable to endure the hardship, eventually left, while Liu remained unperturbed, living thus for twenty years. Later, fleeing turmoil, he came south.\n\nDuring the Shaoxing reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Song, he was once summoned to the palace and bestowed the title \"Recluse of Serene Stillness.\" Thereafter, he built a hut by Dong Lake in Yuzhang. When recounting his past, he would speak of those days: atop the loftiest peak of Mount Song lay a level expanse of a hundred *mu* suitable for farming. Nearby were smaller peaks and crags, where clouds and rain often lingered halfway up the slopes. Hundreds of large lizards, each three or four *chi* in length, would gather there. If one offered them food, they would eat from the hand, and their bodies, when stroked, felt smooth as fat. One day, they clustered around a basin, each dipping its head to drink, only to spit the water out immediately—now hardened into round pellets like bullets. These accumulated by the side until, in an instant, the ground was strewn with them. Suddenly, a clap of thunder resounded, and the pellets vanished. The next day, people below the mountain reported that hail had fallen at midday, revealing the lizards’ strange craft.\n\nHe also heard the sound of an old man reading aloud from within a stone cliff.

Though barely literate, he was of pure and cautious nature, never causing harm. Yet when he encountered injustice, he would roll up his sleeves and step forward. During Emperor Gaozong’s *Jianyan* era (1127–1130), bandits overran the land, and Duan’s clan of forty was plundered. Can boldly took gold and silk to ransom them; the bandits, moved by his righteousness, returned them all. In the fifth year of *Shaoxing* (1135), the southeast suffered a severe drought, and a bushel of rice cost over a thousand coins. Can distributed all his stored grain, selling it at the usual price. He also prepared congee to feed the starving, saving countless lives.",

He never disclosed his age, yet his complexion remained youthful, his pupils bright, and his heart as untamed as the wilderness. Fond of wine, he would accept any invitation to drink, becoming intoxicated and singing. Yet his songs foretold fortune and misfortune with unerring accuracy.

      "translated_text": "Later, he suddenly grew weary of worldly affairs and built a hut in the cliffs of Yantian Mountain, where he inscribed the words \"magnanimous and unburdened\" in large characters. One day, he summoned his relatives and old friends, and bid farewell to his uncle, saying, \"Soon the Heavenly Emperor will summon me.\" Others did not take his words seriously, but after several days, he ascended a tower and struck the bell. With a resonant chime, he soared into the clouds and departed. The villagers rushed to his dwelling and found only his tattered clothes and shoes. Though many wished to report the matter to the imperial court, local officials who disapproved suppressed it, and the matter was dropped.\n\n**Rao Tingzhi**\nRao Tingzhi, styled Chaobi, was a native of Nancheng in Jianchang. Having passed the imperial examinations, he was a man of bold talent and moral integrity. In the seventh year of *Shaoxing* (1137) during the reign of Emperor Gaozong, he passed through Wuchang on business and had an extraordinary encounter. From that time on, he kept his distance from his wife and concubines, living in secluded dignity like a recluse of the forest groves. He composed a poem to record the event:\n\n*On the mid-autumn night of the year dingsi,*\n*I wandered by chance to Yellow Crane Tower.*\n*There I met an extraordinary man who imparted a secret teaching—*\n*Yet I regretted still being entangled in worldly affairs,*\n*Unable to devote myself to such pursuits.*\n\nThus, he wrote a poem to mark the occasion:\n\n*Before Yellow Crane Tower, the autumn moon is cold,*\n*The river before the tower vast, the mist boundless.*\n*Deep in the night, the clouds disperse, all sounds stilled,*\n*Alone with my clear shadow, I lean on the railing.*\n*A long whistle pierces the heavens,*\n*Revealing one who dines on rosy clouds and rides the wind.*\n*Through many lives, we had forged a bond of incense and flame,*\n*And by chance met, exchanging words.*\n*Suddenly, the bustle of the marketplace was washed away,*\n*And I seemed to stand in the land of nowhere.*\n*Looking back, past affairs were but a broken meal,*\n*Gazing down, the whole world had lost its way.*\n*Alas, I remain cramped by carriages and caps,*\n*Knowing that Lu Ao’s wanderings were not far off.*\n*In years to come, I vow to follow,*\n*To gaze together at Penglai’s shallow waters.*\n\nTwo years later, in the year *gengshen* (1140), as the court reclaimed the lands south of the Yangtze, he was appointed vice-prefect of Dengzhou. When the Jurchen broke their treaty and Dengzhou fell, he died in the aftermath. His coffin was transported back to his hometown, and those who carried it found it unusually light, though none dared open it to verify. People believed he had achieved *shijie*—transcendence through the dissolution of the body.\n\n**Su Xiang**\nSu Xiang of Danyang, whose given name was Xiang and style Yangzhi, lived by the Rear Lake before moving in his later years to Ma’er Mountain by Taihu Lake in Runzhou. In the eleventh month of the fourteenth year of *Shaoxing* (1144), during the *jiazi* year, he fell ill from drinking and lay prostrate outside when a village boy he employed, named Xu Xing, knocked at his bed and announced, \"A guest calling himself Jiang Xuanzan seeks an audience.\" The calling card read: *Jiang Guanchao, the Longevity Daoist of Shuilian Cave, Luofu Mountain, Huizhou.* On either side were inscribed two lines of poetry:\n\n*Wealth and honor are easily met, but days and months are short;*\n*What is hard to encounter here is long life.*\n\nPleased by the words, Su struggled to rise and received the guest. The visitor said, \"The Perfected Yellow of Luofu Mountain—who in the Jin dynasty served as prefect of Huizhou before abandoning office to enter Shuilian Cave—has noted that you have no desire for worldly fame or profit. Your name is already recorded in the registers of immortals, and he has sent me to deliver an elixir to you.\" At the time, Su was eighty years old. He replied, \"I have never met the Perfected One, and my body is already worn out. What use would an elixir be to me?\" The guest said, \"This is no ordinary alchemy of the five metals or eight minerals, but a transformation of the Perfected One’s true *qi*. There is no harm in consuming it.\" Su observed the guest, whose clothing was extravagant and befitted a nobleman, yet his speech was coarse and vulgar, lacking refinement. Disliking him, Su wished he would leave quickly, saying, \"Even so, I do not wish to receive it. My age and infirmity make me unfit for hospitality, but I shall have my elder brother’s household attend to you.\" The guest said, \"I came specifically for you. If you do not want the elixir, I shall take it back. But the journey is long, and I would beg a night’s lodging. If the weather clears by dawn, I shall depart; otherwise, I must stay a while longer.\" Unable to refuse, Su had him accommodated in the Pine and Chrysanthemum Cottage. The weather had been dry for a long time, but at the fifth watch, a heavy rain began. Recalling the guest’s words from the previous day, Su felt a pang of regret and hastily sent for him, preparing wine.",

The guest explained, \"If your illness is severe, take it, and you will soon see its effect. For any ailment of the body, simply reverently focus on the elixir’s power as it moves through you, and you will be cured. Those who consume this will ascend and transcend the world; if worldly desires remain unfinished, it will still prolong your life by one *ji*, and even at the end of that term, you will become an immortal official.\"\n\nAfter several rounds of wine, a servant happened to lead a donkey past them. The guest remarked, \"This donkey was once a man.\" He then commanded it to laugh, and the donkey laughed. He next asked for some *ling* from his green bamboo hat to feed it, and prayed, \"Return to being human.\" Again, he ordered it to laugh, and it laughed once more, astonishing all present.\n\nHe then instructed Su to paint an image of the True Man. Su asked, \"What does he look like?\" The guest replied, \"A figure of divine transcendence, clad in a yellow Daoist robe, striking a black silk whip, wearing *qin* shoes, holding a crystal rosary, and hanging a jade gourd from his right sash. I once encountered him amidst the clouds and mist on the iron bridge of Mount Luofu’s sheer cliffs, and his attire and accessories were exactly thus.\"\n\nWith that, he took his leave, promising to return in five years, adding, \"By then, you will be different from today.\" Su placed the elixir and the inscribed characters into a bamboo container.

      "translated_text": "Before his transformation, Hong Qingshan once wrote to request his recent poems. He replied: \"Lately, I obtained an immortal’s elixir from a master of the Dao, snatching my life from the grasp of death’s specter. Since partaking of it, my mind has been fixed on poetry and calligraphy, with no other pursuits remaining.\" Qingshan treasured these words and included them in his records. Tao Anshi’s account is likewise thorough.\n\nFeng Guoguo, a native of Junwu, was precocious in his youth and devoted to his studies. Upon reaching adulthood, he grew weary of worldly concerns and fled his hometown to wander beyond the mundane. There, he encountered an extraordinary figure who taught him the arts of *daoyin* and inner alchemy. Without formal study, he mastered the mysteries of astronomy, geography, fate, fortune, and misfortune. Concealing his name, he styled himself the \"Daoist of No Fixed Abode,\" residing in Yichun for two years, sustaining himself through his arts. His predictions of human fortunes and the shifts of yin and yang invariably proved true. Some mocked his drunken eccentricities, but Guoguo paid them no heed, responding in verse:\n\n*I’ve trod the red dust of four hundred prefectures,*\n*How many winds and moons have been my true companions?*\n*Come dawn, they may laugh at this old mendicant,*\n*For the Dao and oxen share no common path.*\n\nAnother poem expressed his sentiments:\n\n*Adrift in the world’s dust, my heart burns wherever it touches,*\n*Yet hidden within lies the subtle work of immortals.*\n*At my brush’s tip, dragons and serpents coil and writhe;*\n*From my gourd, sun and moon hang suspended.*\n*I feign madness among mortals to blend with the age,*\n*Passing the years with nothing but wine in my cup.*\n*Where does my secret cultivation of merit and conduct lead?*\n*Laughing, I point to Penglai—returning to the grotto-heavens.*\n\nMany more of his poems survive, all transcending the mundane, though few could fathom their meaning.\n\nIn Rui Prefecture’s Shanggao County, a man named Li Xuanqing of Matang once instructed his servant Huang Juan at the eastern gate: \"Tomorrow, rise before dawn and report any unusual activity outside.\" The servant agreed. At daybreak, he opened the gate to find a drunken Daoist fast asleep on a bench, unresponsive to calls. He hurried to inform the household. Xuanqing ordered the Daoist lifted and invited into the study to rest, directing his attendants to provide water for washing. Once refreshed, he summoned the Daoist for an audience, inquiring after his name and origins, but received no reply. The Daoist only demanded more wine, downing vast quantities without measure, then claimed hunger and devoured an endless stream of rice. At the time, Xuanqing’s late wife, née Tang, had recently been interred, and though a hermitage had been prepared, no one had yet taken residence. He led the Daoist to inspect it, and the latter eagerly agreed to stay. Xuanqing furnished him with rice, charcoal, and other supplies, sending him to the hermitage.\n\nThree days later, Xuanqing visited to find the provisions untouched. Even the fire-starter logs he had provided remained as they were. When asked why, the Daoist replied, \"I ate my fill the other day.\" Noting the night’s chill, Xuanqing gave him paper for warmth. The next day, he found the paper torn into four strips, tied with green thatch to the bed’s four legs. When questioned, the Daoist answered, \"The cold rises from below.\"\n\nOne day, after drinking, he suddenly composed a poem:\n\n*North, south, east, west—all is home,*\n*For I know my life belongs to mist and clouds.*\n*All for the love of a single cup of wine,*\n*I’ve missed the blossoms of a thousand peach trees.*\n\nThough his verse was extraordinary, he often performed minor tricks like today’s street magicians and delighted in drunken antics, so people dismissed him as unremarkable. Over time, they learned his surname was Feng, and thus called him \"Mad Feng the Daoist.\"\n\nOne day, Xuanqing’s sons visited the hermitage to sweep the graves but found no trace of the Daoist. Instead, they saw a radiant glow suffusing the tomb. Looking up, they spotted him seated atop a tree, face turned to the heavens, exhaling qi in a descending stream that soon blazed with light. Some said he could draw in the essence of the sun.\n\nFor eighteen years, he resided in the hermitage, often jesting and cavorting with Xuanqing’s sons. At times, his words were crude, or he would overturn his seat, unable to control his bowels or bladder. Such repulsive behavior earned their disdain. One evening, as courtesans entertained the sons at their feast, the Daoist burst in, slightly drunk, and disrupted the gathering. As the guests dispersed, the sons, in jest, offered him a maidservant from the troupe, locking the two in an upper chamber. They planned to check at dawn, but the Daoist had vanished. The maidservant reported that after the door was locked, the room grew scorching hot, unbearable to approach. By midnight, she began to cool, hearing celestial music in the void. Near dawn, the rafters rustled. When she finished speaking, the sons investigated the strange occurrence, looking up to see a couplet inscribed on the beam:\n\n*Water is no mere ditch—only beyond it does the dragon roam;*\n*Wood must be wutong—only then does the phoenix alight.*\n*Do not say your elder brothers have no path to depart—*\n*Beyond the azure clouds lies a ladder to the immortals.*\n\nThe next morning, the former servant Huang Juan encountered the Daoist in the Yuanzhou marketplace. The Daoist said, \"Last night, your young masters mocked me too harshly. By dawn, I had already passed through here, leaving word: if you wish to meet again, come seek me beneath the Yichun Terrace.\" That afternoon, the city buzzed with news of a Daoist who had attained transformation beneath the terrace. Huang Juan went to see—it was Mad Feng—and returned to report to his master.\n\nThis occurred on the fourteenth day of the third month in the thirty-second year of Emperor Gaozong’s Shaoxing reign. Earlier, the Daoist had bid farewell to all his acquaintances, leaving poems to mark his departure.

Their exchanges of poetry and lyrics were numerous.\n\n**Zhao Suoshou**\n\nZhao Suoshou—his given name unknown—was originally a scholar from Puzhou. In his youth, his parents gave him money to purchase books in Chengdu. Midway, he encountered someone from beyond the mundane world and abandoned his home to wander. By the end of Emperor Gaozong’s Shaoxing reign, he was over a hundred years old. He often visited Pengzhou and Hanzhou, walking with both hands tucked before his chest, whence his name. When invited to dine, he would finish whatever was offered, regardless of quantity. He drank anywhere from one cup to a hundred without refusal, yet at times went days without food or drink, ever content. Once, in a drunken state, he recounted in detail Wen Digung’s entry into Shu, with a clear beginning and end. When asked about it another day, he replied, “I know nothing of it.”\n\nHuang Zhongbing had his portrait painted and served him. Fang Wei of Chengdu composed a eulogy:\n\n*Cultivating qi approaches art,*\n*Discoursing on the Dao nears Chan.*\n*Clad in coarse cloth yet holding jade,*\n*His joy is as boundless as heaven.*\n*To leave when he wishes, to stay when he pleases,*\n*Hands withdrawn into his sleeves—*\n*Who could fathom his reasons?*\n\nZhao laughed upon reading it and said, “How can cultivating qi be called an art? Chan and the Dao are one—how could they be two? I withdraw my hands to my chest, not into my sleeves.” Taking up the brush, he added:\n\n*Like a donkey without a load,*\n*Like an ox without horns,*\n*Manjushri and Samantabhadra—*\n*Ever beyond grasp.*\n\nHe also composed a self-eulogy:\n\n*Amid red dust and white clouds,*\n*A fine life for a Daoist.*\n*Idly wandering east and west,*\n*Sometimes half-sober, half-drunk.*\n*Meeting, we laugh heartily—*\n*No barbarian songs or foreign clamor.*\n*Only those of the same Dao would understand,*\n*Yet how many such exist in the world?*\n\nYuan Zhongju of Mianzhu, recovering from a long illness, encountered Zhao passing by his door and invited him in for wine. He asked, “My condition is thus—what would you do, Master?” Zhao did not answer but instead sang a lyric:\n\n*I have a three-room house,*\n*Its pillars eight mountains encircling,*\n*Its four walls the sea’s embrace.*\n*The myriad forms arrayed as beams,*\n*Its roof the azure sky.*\n*Leakless for many years,*\n*Built upon karma’s roots,*\n*Perfected through three thousand meritorious deeds.*",

      "translated_text": "Each time he performed rituals or offered prayers, he styled himself as the Fire Department Minister of the Celestial Bureaucracy. Having lived past a hundred years, he ascended in transcendence during the *Longxing* era of Emperor Xiaozong of the Song.\n\nMaster Fu’s personal name was *De Yi* (Virtue-Unity), his courtesy name *Ning Dao* (Peaceful Dao), and his alternate name *Qi Xian* (Equal Worth). He was a native of Xin’gan in Qingjiang, of the Fu clan. His father, whose given name is now lost, was deeply devoted to the Daoist arts, as was his mother, née Lu, both of whom lived with reclusive integrity. Hearing that on the southern slopes of their district stood the altar of Master Liu the Immortal of National Protection, where many numinous wonders occurred, and that an immortal dwelled hidden in those mountains, they secretly admired the place. Thus, they chose to settle at the mountain’s foot.\n\nOn the night of the waxing moon in the ninth month of the fifth year of *Zhenghe* (1115) during the reign of Emperor Huizong of the Song, a crimson radiance suddenly illuminated their distant dwelling, startling the neighbors, who marveled at the sight. The following day, the Master was born. Before a month had passed, his movements and expressions already bore the precocity of a child far older. At eleven, he lost his father. A local official, Magistrate Yan, took pity on his youthful orphanhood and took him into his home.\n\nThat year, on his birthday, the Master went to pay homage to Master Liu the Immortal. On his return, halfway up the mountain, he saw six Daoist adepts playing *weiqi* amid a grove of lush bamboo, drinking from a flat boulder. Wishing to observe, he wandered about but could find no path to approach. Suddenly, an elder turned and pointed the way, allowing him to reach the stone’s side. After a moment, the same elder handed him a *zhu* fruit, commanding sternly, “You must not drink the wine.” The Master assented, took the fruit, and bit into it—its taste was bitter and astringent, inedible. He tucked it into his sleeve and returned home.\n\nAfter traveling a *li* or so, he cast the fruit by the roadside. His family, alarmed by his prolonged absence, sent someone to search for him. He was found only after a full night had passed. When questioned, he recounted all that had occurred. His family and curious neighbors, astonished, followed him up the mountain, bidding him point out the place. Yet all they saw were brambles and overgrowth—no trace of the earlier scene remained. Returning to the spot where he had discarded the *zhu* fruit, it was already dusk, and a brilliant red glow shone forth. Believing a treasure trove had been uncovered, people rushed forward to claim it, but the light soon vanished, leaving only a lingering, fragrant scent.\n\nThe Master said, “The Daoist who gave me the *zhu* fruit must still be here.” He retrieved and ate it again, finding the taste even more bitter. He threw it down once more and departed. From that moment, his spirit and *qi* felt refreshed, his steps light as flight. He gained the ability to foresee fortune and misfortune. Though his home lay ten *li* from the town, he would often make the round trip ten times in a single day. His speech was wild and strange, his laughter and singing uninhibited. Sometimes he wore flowers on his head, or lay drunk on a bridge, leaving others baffled. Some townsfolk despised him and, offering poisoned wine, pushed him into the river beneath the county bridge. The Master drifted with the current for over two *li* before emerging on the bank and re-entering the market. Smiling, he said to his would-be murderer, “Why play such a cruel joke?” People began to marvel at his strangeness. When tested repeatedly thereafter, the same invulnerability manifested.",

      "translated_text": "The crowd was astonished and convinced, hailing him as Master Fu the Immortal. At eighteen, the Master suddenly felt the call of rivers and lakes, donning a straw cloak and hat, shouldering a gourd and sack, and wandering through Huguang, Huaizhe, and beyond. He traversed every sacred mountain and blessed land, sometimes dwelling alone in rocky valleys, other times sleeping beneath the open sky by overgrown shrines. Wherever he went, he behaved with unbridled abandon, free from restraint. As in Xin’gan, people still called him a mad scholar. Yet his predictions of others’ fortune and misfortune invariably came true, and the scholar-officials grew ever more intrigued by him.\n\nWhen Zhang Weigong Jun served as defender of Jiankang, he summoned the Master for conversation and immediately granted him special favor. Chancellor Shi Gong Hao once presented the Master with a poem:\n\n*\"I ask where this journey will end—*\n*In the land of Wu-you, no fixed abode.*\n*Drunk, he knows not; sober, he feigns folly—*\n*Who among the world recognizes this Daoist sage?\"*\n\nLater, he gifted another poem:\n\n*\"We’ve known each other thirty years,*\n*His body mad, his heart not so.*\n*Whoever truly understands*\n*Is an earth-treading immortal.\"*\n\nThereafter, the gifts multiplied.\n\nEarlier, before Prince Shi of Yue had risen to power, he once feasted with fellow officials of the same ministry. The Master happened upon them, and amid the gathering, he suddenly called out to the prince: *\"Master Fu alone foretells that on such-and-such a year, month, and day, you will become chancellor. When that day comes, pray do not forget me.\"* Later, the prince indeed assumed the chancellorship as predicted. One day, the Master arrived at the palace gates, and the prince immediately invited him to the seat of honor, pouring him wine. From then on, they came and went without restraint.\n\nOne day, the Master arrived utterly drunk, stumbling into the palace. He promptly stepped into the chancellor’s shoes with muddy feet, mimed holding a tablet, and looked around in exaggerated alarm. The prince asked what he wanted, and the Master replied, *\"I need a crane-feather cloak.\"* The prince understood his meaning and agreed. Coincidentally, Yang Hezheng arrived for an audience, and the prince recommended him. That very night, Hezheng dreamed of a strange figure visiting him. The next day, the prince summoned him, and upon seeing him, Hezheng found his appearance exactly as in the dream. Delighted, the prince conversed with him and immediately bestowed upon him an imperial commission, a robe, and an official title. Thus, he was honored with the rank of *Guanxia*.",

One day, he presented his ordination certificate to Hezheng and said, *\"Wild cranes and lone clouds—my mad nature stirs again.

Before long, he was invited to oversee the Chongzhen Abbey on Hezao Mountain. Within a month, Grand Master Zhu invited him to administer the Yulong Wanshou Abbey. Later, Minister Shen of Xianmo, then governing Yuzhang, along with Transport Commissioner Lu, a Vice Minister, and Academician Ren of the Bureau of Rites, transferred him to oversee the Tiezhu Yanzhen Abbey.\n\nIn the ninth year of the Qiandao era [1173], the renchen year, Master Zhu Xi of Hui’an inscribed the characters for *\"Cloud Hermitage\"* and presented a quatrain:\n\n*Wherever you go, people speak of Madman Fu,*\n*Gazing at each other, we know from lives past.*\n*Straightaway you lift the Northern Dipper to pour the Milky Way,*\n*And depart to become the Dragon Palace’s second immortal.*\n\nThereafter, Grand Master Fan of Shihu and Minister Zhang of the Bureau of Military Affairs gathered many worthies to compose tributes—too numerous to record.\n\nIn the first year of the Chunxi era [1174], the jiayin year, Prince Shi of Yue governed Min. One day, the Master suddenly called his disciple Ye Yongshou and said, *\"I wish to visit the chancellor in Fuzhou.\"* The next morning, he set off. At the time, portraits were being painted to solicit inscriptions. The prince stood before him, the Master beside him, and he readily agreed to the request, writing in the prefectural hall of Sanshan. He stayed for several months, and the prince memorialized the throne on his behalf at Deshou Hall. In the fourth month of that year, an imperial edict summoned him. From Hongdu to the imperial residence, the journey took no more than three days—though Sanshan lay nearly two thousand *li* from the capital. The Master personally attended the inner palace, where he was granted a vegetarian feast, silver, silk, an imperial fan inscribed with sacred script, and the ordination certificate of a *Lingbao* Grand Master. On the fifteenth of that month, he submitted a memorial of gratitude.\n\nDespite this extraordinary encounter, the Master remained unmoved. Soon after, he took his leave and resided at Yanzhen Abbey for twenty years. His judgments of people were invariably apt. When Grand Academician Han led the forces of Jiangxia or Vice Minister Li oversaw the transport of Jiangxi, he foretold their appointments in advance—such instances of prescience were many. Letters sent from Qiantang to the Master in Qingjiang arrived in three days. Sometimes, he would answer the summons of several households in a single day, all arriving simultaneously. People said he had mastered Fei Zhangfang’s art of shrinking distances and Ji Zixun’s technique of bilocation—though none knew if this were truly so.\n\nThe Master’s nature was open and unconstrained; he kept his distance from worldly affairs. Though he repeatedly held distinguished positions, he merely filled the office. Often he passed nights without sleep, sometimes sitting in silence for a month without emerging. Though his conduct was wild and reckless, his aspirations were pure. Entering the gates of high officials, he always urged them to do good and cherish themselves—people respected him for this.\n\nOn the twenty-second day of the eleventh month in the fifteenth year of the Chunxi era [1188], the wushen year, he called his disciples, entrusted them with final instructions, and took up his brush to compose a verse:\n\n*All my life, my courage and spirit were lofty,*\n*Embracing the Dao, I found lasting joy in freedom.*\n*Heaven and earth, yin and yang turn and overturn—*\n*Clouds gather, mists roll back, the cinnabar sky revealed.*\n\nThe verse finished, he cast aside his brush and passed away at the age of seventy-four. The following year, on the renyin day of the first month, his disciples and followers interred his remains on Zhusha Ridge outside the eastern gate of the prefecture. Over a thousand attended the funeral.\n\nXie Guan later wrote a postscript: *\"At first, when the Master was born, people said he was conceived without pregnancy, and his mother believed it. Yet consulting the biographies of immortals, even transcendent beings descending to the world, though they assume mortal form, must still rely on the qi of yin and yang and the nurturing of the Three Primes to shape this corporeal frame. Thus, before the Primordial One’s birth, the essence of the sun descended into the Mysterious Womb; before Gautama’s arrival, Queen Maya dreamed of a white elephant. Never has there been one not conceived who was born. If he were a rare being, incarnated in the world, his mother’s unawareness might be possible. Thus, Laozi lived eighty-one years, and the Primordial Lady did not notice their length; Duke Zhuang was born in a breach, and Lady Jiang doubted he was her child. The Master’s way of conducting himself and responding to things owed nothing to learned teachings or transmitted instruction—his attainments surely arose from this.*\n\n*I once heard Xu Cuo’s poem:*\n*Before the garden’s flowers, it is a land of drunkenness,*\n*Tossing back nine goblets of rosy clouds with Mother Alchemy.*\n*The immortals point and scorn him as frivolous,*\n*Exiled to the human world to play the madman with wine.*\n\n*The Master was perhaps his equal. Otherwise, why would the old immortal sternly warn him against drinking, fearing his wild nature would resurface?\"*\n\nMagistrate Xie, who had once been close to the Master, recorded these broad strokes. Later gentlemen seeking fuller details may consult the epitaph written by Prince Shi of Yue.\n\nZhang Zongyuan was a native of Bazhou in Hebei.",
      "overlap_context": "cloak.\"* The prince understood his meaning and agreed. Coincidentally, Yang Hezheng arrived for an audience, and the prince recommended him. That very night, Hezheng dreamed of a strange figure visiting him. The next day, the prince summoned him, and upon seeing him, Hezheng found his appearance exactly as in the dream. Delighted, the prince conversed with him and immediately bestowed upon him an imperial commission, a robe, and an official title. Thus, he was honored with the rank of *Guanxia*.",

For fifty years he dwelt in the mountains, without attendant or servant, often sharing his abode with tigers, leopards, snakes, and vipers, yet remaining untroubled by harm.

At the time, purple qi soared into the sky, and all near and far regarded it as a marvel.\n\nIn his youth, he served under the tutelage of Lady Xi and later moved with her to Jingshan in Ying. Even as a child, his bearing was serene and pure; he abstained from meat and wine, and grasped the principles of life, death, fortune, and misfortune. Sometimes he would go days without eating. Once, he entered the mountains and did not return for half a month. When his family went to search for him, they found him lying in a ravine, with two tigers crouched beside him. The villagers were astonished and revered him as divine.\n\nAnother time, upon waking from sleep, he told his mother: “Just now, I visited the home of my elder sister Hao in Fuzhou Village and have only just returned.

      "translated_text": "On the fifteenth day of the first lunar month in the twenty-seventh year, the Perfected Lord sat in silent meditation upon the front mountain when he beheld five-colored clouds drifting in the sky, surrounded by a host of ten thousand spirits standing guard. At their center sat the Celestial Lord upon a dragon chariot, who summoned the Perfected Lord and bestowed upon him secret talismans and sacred scriptures. Having received these, the Perfected Lord’s Daoist prestige began to flourish. Later, a shrine was erected on that very site to commemorate the place where he received the Dao, and it was named \"Imperial Bestowal.\" Thereafter, whenever the countryside suffered from drought or flooding, prayers offered there were invariably answered. Those afflicted with illness were instantly cured by his talismanic water. Thus, the people of Jing and Han came to revere and admire him in great numbers.\n\nIn the first year of the Qiandao era of Emperor Xiaozong, he donated his residence to be converted into a shrine, where an image of the Jade Emperor was enshrined and venerated as the Guang Temple. The emperor personally inscribed the name \"Changsen Bay,\" and it is now known as the Wansui Abbey. In the second year, the Perfected Lord, wearing a simple headscarf and carrying a staff of flowering wood, toured the famous mountains of Xiang and Han. Arriving at Hong Mountain, he visited the abbot of the main temple, the elder monk Mu, and together they discoursed on the mysteries of the quiescent Dao. Delighted by Mu’s wisdom and meditative steadfastness, the Perfected Lord donated all the gold and silk he had received from his hometown to the temple.\n\nIn the eighth year, when Suizhou suffered from drought and prayers for rain went unanswered, Monk Mu informed the prefecture of the Perfected Lord’s divine efficacy. The prefecture dispatched an official to Changsen Bay to pay respects and invite the Perfected Lord. Upon arriving in the prefecture, the Perfected Lord merely wrote the \"Heaven-Bestowed Divine Chapter\" on a sheet of paper and burned it, whereupon sweet rain fell at once. The officials and common people, moved by gratitude, wished to establish a perpetual incense shrine in his honor. The Perfected Lord declined and returned to Hong Mountain. Monk Mu said to him: \"The Dao is fundamentally one, yet its teachings diverge into three. I hope you will not abandon this mountain and will continue to uphold the Buddhist Dharma.\" The Perfected Lord replied: \"Coming and going each follow their destined path. Yesterday, I received a decree from the Jade Emperor, which stated that the site for establishing a sacred incense hall lies within the celestial region of Dou and Niu, connected to Mount Lu and Mount Huo, and that it would flourish upon encountering the number nine. The mandate of Heaven cannot be defied.\" He then bid farewell to Monk Mu and returned to reside at Changsen Bay.\n\nIn the first month of the seventh year of the Chunxi era, the Perfected Lord traveled to Longhu Mountain to pay homage to the Celestial Master and received the *Great Cavern Register of Supreme Clarity* before returning. In the fourth year, a monk named Zuchao arrived from Guoqing Temple on Mount Tiantai, entreating the master to journey there and recount past events. The assembly of monks marveled at his spiritual insight. Upon the Perfected Lord’s return to Ying, the people of Pulao Village, increasingly drawn to his divine efficacy, donated funds and land. On the site of his former retreat at Green Ox Mountain, they erected a shrine to enshrine his incense altar, which is now the Chongning Wanshou Abbey.\n\nIn the tenth year, the Perfected Lord journeyed to the capital. At that time, Emperor Guangzong was still heir apparent, and the Princess of Qi’an fell gravely ill. The Empress Dowager Ciyí sighed, saying: \"If only Master Zhang could come, this illness might be cured.\" Yet the distance was great, and his arrival could not be hastened. Coincidentally, the imperial guard Li brought the Perfected Lord to the palace. Upon hearing of his presence, the Eastern Palace issued a summons. The Perfected Lord presented jujube and water, which the princess drank, and she revived at once. Emperor Guangzong exclaimed: \"Truly divine!\" He bestowed lavish gifts, which the Perfected Lord declined, accepting instead a personal inscription of the characters \"True Shepherd\" carved upon an ivory tablet. Thereafter, he was frequently summoned, and his courtesy was ever increased. The Perfected Lord remained indifferent and unassuming, answering only when questioned. One day, during an audience, the emperor inquired about his place of residence. He replied: \"Changsen Bay in Yingzhou.\" The emperor then personally inscribed \"Changsen Bay\" and bestowed it upon him.\n\nIn the eleventh year, the Perfected Lord departed the capital and returned to his former retreat, where he saved countless lives. Observing that the shrine at Changsen Bay was too cramped to do justice to the imperial calligraphy, he commanded his disciple Yang Zonghua and others to renovate and expand it. Upon its completion, he addressed the assembly, saying: \"Long ago, I received a secret decree from the Jade Emperor to establish a Daoist sanctuary in a place of exceptional spiritual energy. The appointed site has awaited me for some time, and I must now set forth.\" He then journeyed from Ying into Shu, traversing the Jian and Jing regions, sailing across Dongting Lake, and descending the Pengli Marshes.\n\nIn the spring of the fourteenth year, as he passed through Mount Kanglu, an immortal elder greeted him on the road, saying: \"I have secluded myself in the Nine Palaces, and though I have come from afar to pay my respects, I hope you will soon visit that mountain, that our kind may find refuge there.\" The Perfected Lord assented. Proceeding from Fuchuan, he ascended to Tongyang and lodged at a monastic retreat in Shan Keng. That evening, an elder of the village, Zhang Zhen, dreamed of a divine figure in yellow robes riding a white horse, who entered his dwelling. The following day, when the Perfected Lord arrived, Zhang Zhen was astonished and received him with utmost reverence. The Perfected Lord told him: \"The sacred altar of the Nine Palaces has long lain in ruins. I shall restore its foundation as a place of prayer for the nation.\" He then climbed the mountain, grasping vines as he ascended for several dozen *li*, until he reached a plateau of several dozen *mu* at its summit—the very site recorded in the local gazetteer as the Level Pot Terrace.\n\nAs dusk fell, he took lodging upon the mountain and sat cross-legged beneath a pine tree. At midnight, the mountain spirits cried out in joy, startling his attendants. The Perfected Lord said: \"The mountain spirits are merely expressing their delight.\" Soon after, marvels appeared: a red serpent and a divine dragon. At dawn, his attendants complained of hunger. The Perfected Lord, just awakening from meditation, drew vegetarian cakes from his sleeve, giving one to each. They were fragrant and still warm. Upon eating, all were sated.",

Then he declared: \"I shall return to Changsen for now, but will come again in autumn.\" He transmitted talismanic methods to his disciple Yang Zonghua, instructing him to go ahead and clear the land, build thatched huts for temporary lodging, and prepare for their stay.\n\nIn the fifteenth year of the cycle, the year *wushen* (1188), the Perfected Lord arrived. The seven assemblies welcomed him into the mountain, and people from all directions—those afflicted with illness seeking peace—gathered like clouds, their prayers answered as soon as they were uttered. The poor contributed labor, while the wealthy offered wealth. Soon after, the Perfected Lord’s numinous manifestations were many, and the Nine Palaces’ construction was completed in no time.\n\nIn the first year of Shaoxi (1190) of Emperor Guangzong’s reign, a summons was issued, but he did not go. The emperor dispatched envoys to present incense, candles, brocade banners, and silver tablets into the mountain, where a grand state *jiao* ritual was held to invoke blessings for the people. While still heir apparent, Emperor Ningzong had also bestowed generous gifts. Shortly after, an imperial decree renamed the hermitage the Qintian Abbey.\n\nIn the first year of Qingyuan (1195), Emperor Ningzong ascended the throne. The Empress Ciyi, residing in the inner palace, sent envoys into the mountain each year with abundant offerings. In the third year, the Perfected Lord returned to Changsen. In the fifth year, the emperor bestowed upon him the title *Zhenmu Zhenren* (Perfected Lord of True Pastorship). In the fourth year of Jiatai (1204), Emperor Ningzong personally inscribed the six characters *Qintian Ruijing Zhi Gong* (Auspicious Abbey of Celestial Favor) and ordered the Directorate of Palace Maintenance to renovate it. The abbey was expanded into a palace, and lavish gifts were bestowed. In the sixth month, the emperor further elevated his title to *Taiping Huguo Zhenmu Zhenren* (Perfected Lord of True Pastorship, Protector of Peace and the State).\n\nIn the second year of Kaixi (1206), an edict ordered the Jiangxi Fiscal Commission to allocate unused fields, and Empress Ciming donated funds to establish estates to support the Daoist community. Repeated special decrees exempted them from corvée labor and taxes. That year, when the northern invaders raided the western capital, Changsen lay squarely in their path. As the enemy entered the region, the Daoist followers fled in panic. The Perfected Lord, however, sat serenely in the hall, and the invaders dared not harm him. When they set fire to the shrine, the flames extinguished themselves. Struck with awe, they exclaimed: \"This is a perfected immortal of the Southern Court!\"\n\nIn the third year, at the beginning of summer, the Perfected Lord returned once more to Changsen. The disciples of the Nine Palaces also came to pay their respects and, fulfilling their vows, entreated him to return to the Nine Palaces. The Perfected Lord replied: \"My comings and goings are not for you to know. I established the Nine Palaces sanctuary by heavenly mandate, to safeguard the state and secure the household, and to gather and settle the Daoist community. You must set your hearts on advancing in the Dao and not worry over my absence.\"\n\nOn the fifth day of the seventh month, the Perfected Lord struck the drum and ascended his seat. Addressing the assembly, he said: \"Life and death are but a single day and night; going forth and returning are but a single heaven and earth. Since traversing kalpas past, I have emerged in response to the times, delivering beings according to their thoughts. Though my body dwells in the dust of the world, my name is inscribed in the registers of immortals. Now I shall depart—vast and boundless, with nothing to encumber me. Each of you must uphold the precepts, follow the rules, and walk the path, so as to uphold the teachings and repay your sovereign and parents.\"\n\nThen he called for paper and wrote a verse:\n*An illusory form, a fleeting fragrance in the dust—*\n*Just passing through sixty years.*\n*Pitying all sentient beings,*\n*Like the thirsty rushing to water.*\n*Wearing through iron shoes in search,*\n*Only to find the track at the sole’s end.*",

      "translated_text": "In a single instant, the myriad currents ceased.\n\nLooking up, bathed in imperial grace, one might call this a perfect beginning and end. Today, I escape this form, serene and free from its sheath.\n\n*Hmm—*\n*I recall the path I came by,*\n*Riding those white clouds back to the Emperor’s realm.*\n\nWith the verse complete, he sat upright in solemn dignity and shed his mortal coil.\n\nA memorial was submitted, and the Ning Emperor inscribed his decree:\n*\"Zhang Daoqing, True Shepherd of Peace and Protector of the Realm, cultivated clarity and emptiness, his Dao-conduct lofty and pure. Favored by the former court with utmost generosity, his prayers for rain and sunshine repeatedly met with divine response. Now that he has ascended as a feathered immortal, We grieve deeply. Let funds be drawn from the inner treasury to dispatch his disciples to Changsen Bay, where they shall escort his remains to the Nine Palaces for reverent enshrinement. The overseer of the Nine Palaces shall select an auspicious site within the sacred precinct for his interment, ensuring no negligence. No local obstruction shall be permitted. This is to be entrusted to the Qintian Ruijing Abbey. Thus decreed.\"*\n\nA subsequent imperial edict was issued:\n*\"To the Jiangxi Transport Bureau: Commission Director Zhao Longtu to supervise the relocation. Expedite the return, ensuring strict adherence by the disciples, who shall proceed to Changsen Bay to escort his remains with due honor and inter them in the stupa on an auspicious day.\"*\n\nSuddenly, the True Lord’s spirit possessed a child and declared:\n*\"Now that my spirit returns to the celestial palace, why bury this discarded form? Yet out of pity for the faithful who have come from afar with no means to pay their respects, let a hall be established for his veneration, where his true likeness shall remain.\"*\n\nIn the third year of Jiading, the Ning Emperor bestowed the calligraphic inscription *\"True Shepherd Hall\"* upon him, which was engraved on a plaque. When Emperor Lizong ascended the throne, his favor only deepened. In the fourth year of Shaoding, Zhang was posthumously enfeoffed as *\"True Shepherd of Universal Response,\"* his miracles and the emperor’s profound grace detailed in *The Complete Biography of the True Lord of Nine Palaces Mountain.*\n\n---\n\n**Master Xie Shouyu**\n\nMaster Xie, whose given name was Shouxie and courtesy name Huaiying, was a native of Yongjia. Born in the fourth year of Shaoxing during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of Song—on the twenty-second day of the third month in the year of jiayin, at the hour of noon—he displayed exceptional intelligence and acuity from childhood. In his youth, he devoted himself to learning with unwavering resolve.\n\nOne day, a wandering Daoist visited his study. The Daoist introduced himself as *\"Master Jielü.\"* After exchanging bows and taking their seats, the master withdrew to prepare tea. The Daoist nodded approvingly and remarked: *\"Ah! An ancient scholar of divine immortals!\"*\n\nAs they sat, the master fell silent, as if awakened. From that day forth, he absorbed all the classics, histories, and philosophical works without omission. Diligent in Confucian studies, his talent was vast and comprehensive. In his youth, he entered the imperial academy, later serving as a tutor in the household of Minister Cao Zhongjing.\n\nAt the time, the Pure Void Sovereign, Huangfu the True Person, enjoyed the emperor’s favor and was frequently summoned to discourse on the Dao. Minister Cao, grateful for the True Person’s past kindness in ferrying him across the Yellow River, often hosted him at his home. Admiring the True Person’s virtue, the master doffed his Confucian cap, bowed in reverence, and became his disciple, joining the ranks of the feathered immortals.\n\nThe True Person first transmitted his teachings to Cao Mitan, then to the master as his foremost disciple. Well-versed and retentive, the master’s discourses were grand and eloquent. When comparing the Three Teachings, he often favored Daoism over Buddhism, though some questioned his emphasis. The master would say: *\"The Confucians declare, ‘Those who can refute Yang and Mo are the disciples of sages.’ I say the same of Daoism.\"*\n\nOne day, a scholar—brilliant, learned, and devoted to Buddhism—asked him: *\"Which of the Three Teachings is superior?\"* The master replied: *\"There is no second Way under heaven; the ten thousand differences share a single origin. The supreme principle is luminously clear—what doubt remains?\"* Well-versed in classics and history, his words were always grounded, his eloquence like a cascading river—none could refute him.\n\nAnother challenger once said: *\"‘To believe everything in books is worse than having no books at all.’\"* The master retorted: *\"If even the classics and histories cannot be trusted, can your words be trusted?\"* The man fell silent, bowed in admiration, and departed.\n\nIn the thirteenth year of Chunxi during Emperor Xiaozong’s reign, the Jiangxi transport commissioner petitioned for him to serve as abbot of Xishan’s Yulong Wanshou Abbey. At the beginning of Emperor Guangzong’s Shaoxi era, the court bestowed upon him the title *\"Great Master of Observing Revival\"* and appointed him to oversee the Gaoshi of the imperial Shouning Abbey.\n\nThe master delved into the Three Teachings, the various philosophers, and the hundred schools, compiling *The Veritable Records of the Supreme Venerable Lord, the Primordial August Emperor of the Dao* in seven fascicles. Presented to the throne, it circulated widely. His profound scholarship and erudition resonated throughout the court and the realm.\n\nIn the fourth year of Shaoxi, he was reappointed abbot of Yulong Wanshou Abbey. In the first year of Jiatai during Emperor Ningzong’s reign, he was again entrusted with the governance of the abbey’s ritual affairs. Ascending the scripture platform, he expounded the subtleties of the Dao, guiding the Three Teachings with consummate skill. When eminent figures posed questions, his responses were instantaneous. He also borrowed temple halls to deliver sermons, earning the admiration of Chan masters.\n\nThe master had traveled extensively across rivers and seas, visiting renowned mountains. He once encountered an perfected one who bestowed upon him *The Stone Casket Record of Jingyang*, deepening his mastery of the principles of the Golden Elixir. Within, he nurtured his true nature; without, he blended with the world—none knew his depth.\n\nDuring the reigns of Emperors Guangzong and Ningzong, he enjoyed exceptional imperial favor. His friends were the great worthies of the age—unmatched in their loftiness, none could compare. In his later years, his appearance grew refined and ancient, his beard and hair snowy white. People said he was the living Laozi reborn.\n\nIn his leisure, he sat in quietude, burning incense and reciting scriptures. Upon reviewing his own *Veritable Records of the Primordial August Emperor*, he struck the table and sighed: *\"Those who understand me will do so through this book; those who condemn me will do so through this book.\"*\n\nWhen his disciples sought further instruction, he said: *\"My aim is to cultivate literature and uphold the teachings, to clarify right and wrong. My stance is firm—my words unchanging. Let posterity’s praise or blame fall where it may.\"*",
      "overlap_context": ". Now I shall depart—vast and boundless, with nothing to encumber me. Each of you must uphold the precepts, follow the rules, and walk the path, so as to uphold the teachings and repay your sovereign and parents.\"\n\nThen he called for paper and wrote a verse:\n*An illusory form, a fleeting fragrance in the dust—*\n*Just passing through sixty years.*\n*Pitying all sentient beings,*\n*Like the thirsty rushing to water.*\n*Wearing through iron shoes in search,*\n*Only to find the track at the sole’s end.*",

On quiet nights, he would sit by lamplight deciphering texts, even the finest of small characters. Once, he took his esoteric work *The Stone Casket Record*—this piece titled *On the Symbolism of the Golden Elixir*—and, finding a later supplement to it full of erroneous methods that might mislead students, inscribed its characters like grains of millet upon silver leaves. These he concealed within a mountain cavern, awaiting one whose bone structure marked him as destined for immortality.\n\nIn his later years, he again departed to establish a temple on Purple Florescence Peak in Rui’an County of Yongjia Prefecture. He petitioned the court for its name, and it was granted as the Nine Stars Palace—this being the very place where the master had once purified himself. He lived in this world for seventy-nine years.

      "translated_text": "Thus, unifying the Four Directions into One, she was appointed to the exalted rank of Attendant of the Celestial Throne in the Qingwei Yuan Shang. She then manifested herself as the Illuminating Sovereign of Qingwei Inspection, also known as the Radiant Sovereign of Universal Transformation, commanding the thunder and lightning. Her forms were manifold: at times, she wore a red kerchief and bare-armed vest, barefoot with legs exposed, her awe-inspiring might unmatched; at others, she sat upon a rock with sword in hand, whistling to summon wind and thunder; or she rode a dragon, wielding a sword to command the myriad spirits; or she appeared in golden crown and white robes, presiding over the cavern palaces with solemn dignity. Fierce in temper and strict in command, even the Thunder Gods deferred to her discipline. After achieving transcendence, she ascended to the Golden Portal’s Zhao Ning Palace, governing the Qingwei Dong Zhao Prefecture. She also presided over the Golden Portal’s Zhong Ling Ning Zhao Prefecture, upholding the teachings to bestow grace upon living beings. Those who inherited her Dao passed it down in an unbroken lineage: the Jade Chamber’s Dong Qing Guo Yuanjun, the Blessed Harmony’s Yao Zhen Fu Yuanjun, the Dragon Radiance Dao, the Illuminating Yao Yuanjun, the Purple Essence’s Jade Grace Gao Yuanjun, the Meritorious Primordial Numinous Qingxu Hua Zhenren, the Qingcheng Mountain’s Tonghui Zhu Zhenren, the Yunshan Mountain’s Baoyi Li Zhenren, and the Meishan Mountain’s Hunyin Nan Zhenren—through whom the Qingwei Daoist teachings flourished anew.\n\n**Fire Master Wang Zhenjun**\nZhenjun’s surname was Wang, given name Zihua, courtesy name Shimei. Born in the second year of Tang Xuanzong’s reign (Jia Yin, 714) in Ruyang County, Caizhou, at forty, having failed the imperial examinations thrice, he sighed, “Having passed the age of uncertainty without attaining office, how can I face my peers? I shall study the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi and serve in the Celestial Realm.” He then became a disciple of Baiyun Master Zhang Yue alongside Yan Zhenqing, later studying under Chicheng Master Sima Chengzhen. During the An Lushan Rebellion, he abandoned his home and wandered as a cloud. At the foot of Mount Heng’s Zhurong Peak, he cultivated the Dao for nine years without descending. When Zhenqing was framed by Lu Qi and sent to Huaixi to be strangled by Li Xilie, Zhenjun encountered the Purple Void Yuanjun, who personally visited Mount Heng and transmitted to him the Supreme Dao. After cultivating for another twenty years, his elixir was perfected, and his Dao complete. On the seventh day of the first month in the fifth year of Zhenyuan (Geng Wu, 789), he ascended to heaven in broad daylight by imperial decree.\n\n**Yellow Thunder Abyss**\nThe Zhenren’s surname was Huang, given name Shunshen, a native of Jianning, Fujian. From childhood, he was exceptionally intelligent, mastering the Three Teachings and Nine Schools without exception. While serving in Guangxi, the provincial governor Nan saw him as extraordinary and entrusted him with sacred texts. The Zhenren delved into their mysteries, compiling a comprehensive collection, and scholars flocked to his door like clouds. Later, summoned by imperial edict to court, he was permitted to return to the mountains, where he secluded himself upon the Purple Mist’s Cangzhou, bestowed the title of Dan Mountain’s Thunder Abyss Guangfu Puhua Zhenren. Those he initiated as disciples had their names inscribed on stone. Thirty were recorded before the stele’s erection, and only five after. The former each received a single method, while the latter inherited his entire transmission. Among them, the Wudang Dongyuan Zhang Zhenren’s teachings spread across the Four Seas, his solitary peak revealed to all—his Dao flourishing particularly in the North. The Xishan Zhenxi Xiong Zhenren, though listed after the stele’s erection, propagated his teachings widely, especially in the southern lands. He transmitted them to Peng Ruli of Ancheng, who passed them to Zeng Chenwai of Anfu, who in turn transmitted them to Zhao Yuanyang of Junyi. All these inheritors became masters of their generation, their virtue and power harmonious, their inner and outer radiance resplendent.\n\n**Lei Mo’an**\nThe Zhenren’s surname was Lei, given name Shizhong, courtesy name Kequan, sobriquet Mo’an. His ancestors were originally from Yuzhang, later settling in Jinniu Town, Wuchang, Huguang. The stream near his residence meandered between the East and West Bridges, hence his alternate name, Double Bridge. Born on the fifth day of the eleventh month in the fourth year of Jiading (Xin Si, 1211) during the Chen hour, he studied poetry and rhapsodies in his youth, later mastering the *Book of Songs*. Having passed the provincial examinations thrice, he devoted himself to Daoist learning, focusing on the principles of nature. Befriending Jifu of Jiujiang, he relocated his family there during the disasters of Ji Wei and Geng Shen. In the Jiazi year, the palace marshal performed a thanksgiving ritual at the Taiping Palace, and the Master accompanied him. That night, lodging in the Listening Rain Pavilion of the Taiping Palace, he dimly perceived the Supreme Emperor addressing him: “Your fate holds no share of yang office, but you have a destiny in the yin bureaucracy—abandon thoughts of official rank.” That same night, the palace’s superintendent also dreamed of the Visiting Zhenjun, who declared, “At noon tomorrow, prepare the rituals with utmost reverence.” Among the Five Hundred Spirit Officers, one descended to the altar’s incense burner. The next day at noon, the marshal said to the Master, “I am exhausted—you may offer the incense in my stead.” Upon entering the altar, the superintendent was astonished, realizing the Master was one of the Five Hundred Spirit Officers. Later, the superintendent informed him, and the Master deepened his devotion to the Dao, renouncing all ambition for officialdom. Returning to Jinniu Town, he established an altar for rituals. On the third day of the third month in the Geng Wu year, the birthday of the Dark Warrior, the Master prepared a memorial, burning incense and reciting the *Scripture of Salvation*. Suddenly, a Daoist of extraordinary bearing arrived from outside, saying, “This poor Daoist possesses a method of the Dao and has come specifically to transmit it to you.” He produced a scroll from his sleeve, saying, “Place this text upon the altar. After seven days of purification, you may open it.” The Master received it and set it upon the incense table. Turning back, the Daoist had vanished, leaving him to realize he was an extraordinary being. Entering the altar to express gratitude, he maintained purification for seven days, then burned incense, bowed, and opened the text—it was the *Hunyuan Liutian Ruyi Daoist Method*. As he finished reading, the altar’s daylight turned to night, and in an instant, thunder and fire filled the space. The Thunder God Xin stood upon the table, declaring, “By decree of the August Heaven, I entrust you with propagating the teachings of thunder to universally deliver all beings. Our teachings take the Supreme Emperor as their lord, with me as his assistant and you as the executor.”",

      "translated_text": "The one who bestowed upon you the text the other day was none other than the Patriarch Lu, the Perfected Lord. Your name is recorded in the immortal registers; for seven generations, your family has followed the Confucian path, and for three generations, they have practiced the Daoist arts—without the slightest transgression. Thus, you are destined to greatly prosper our teachings. During the Jin dynasty, the Patriarch Lu personally encountered the Most High Lord Lao, who transmitted this method to him. This teaching takes the *Scripture for Salvation* as its foundation. Whenever the Master transformed and guided the people of the world or initiated disciples, he would first instruct them to recite the scripture with utmost devotion, and each would attain their karmic rewards. He often expounded on the essence of the *Scripture for Salvation* to enlighten later learners. Its crux lies in the \"Ten Recitations for Salvation\"—not merely that ten recitations can save others, but that one must cultivate oneself daily to fathom the wonders of returning to the primordial. It is essential to first deliver one’s ancestors, and only then, with the Way complete, ascend to the Upper Clarity. The clarity of the scripture’s intent is unparalleled.\n\nDrawing from both the Confucian and Buddhist traditions, he broadly sought and synthesized, penetrating and harmonizing them into unity. As his Way spread far and wide, renowned for its excellence, those who sought his gate grew daily in number. His disciples numbered in the thousands, divided into the Eastern, Southern, Western, and Shu branches. He first initiated the two patriarchs, Lu and Li, as well as Zha Taiyu of Nankang. Thus, the Way of Lu and Li flourished in Western Shu, while Taiyu’s Way spread through the East and South. The teachings of the Primordial Unity thrived throughout the world. His writings—*Essentials of the Heart-Method*, *Direct Pointers to the Daoist Arts*, and *Songs of the Original Dao*—all elucidated the wonders of the Primordial Unity’s transformation.\n\nOn the fifth day of the fourth month in the yiwei year of the Zhiyuan era, he bathed, changed his robes, and sat upright. Approaching noon, he commanded Masters Lu and Li to lead all disciples in chanting the *Scripture for Salvation* once through. Then, he called for brush and paper and wrote this hymn:\n\n*A wheel of bright moon illumines the clear vault,*\n*Ten thousand miles without clouds, radiant in clarity.*\n*At ease and carefree, without a single affair,*\n*Ever in perfect harmony with the Great Void.*\n\nUpon finishing the hymn, he passed away in serene stillness.",

As he finished reading, the altar’s daylight turned to night, and in an instant, thunder and fire filled the space.

Our teachings take the Supreme Emperor as their lord, with me as his assistant and you as the executor.”",

      "translated_text": "In that winter, his disciples interred him at Yanshan in the commandery. Later, thunder and lightning repeatedly descended amid clouds and mist, proclaiming: \"The Celestial Emperor has elevated the Perfected One to the rank of Supreme Minister of the Mysterious Capital, Universal Savior of the Wondrous Dao of Primordial Unity, and Heavenly Venerable of Thunder’s Dharma-Teaching.\"\n\nMaster Moyue\nThe Perfected One Moyue bore the surname Mo, with the personal name Donyi and the courtesy name Qiyan. A native of Shuchuan in western Zhe, he was a descendant of Mo He. From birth, he was keenly intelligent, surpassing others in brilliance. Ardently drawn to the teachings of Daoist arts and immortals, he and his fellow townsman, Perfected Shen Zhenlei of Xijing, became disciples of Perfected Zou of the Iron Wall. There, he attended upon Perfected Wang of the Celestial Court and received the *Hidden Writ of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder Essence*, gaining renown in his time. Such luminaries as Han of Hunrong in Kuaiji and Yang Hemingchuan of Qiantang—men of towering prestige and revered as pillars of the Daoist arts—all gathered at his incense burner, further elevating the weight of his teachings.\n\nThe Perfected One, unattached and without a home, dwelled wherever he found shelter. Many sought his Way, often forsaking the world and its conventions, drinking wine until intoxicated, and delighting in their natural spontaneity. In receiving disciples, he frequently rebuked them, testing their sincerity and resolve before guiding them further. Those who could not endure would abandon the path midway.\n\nIn the dinghai year of the Zhiyuan era, he was summoned to the imperial court, where his talismanic arts flourished, and thunder and rain responded to his slightest gesture. His fame resounded throughout the capital, and those who flocked to him were as numerous as clouds or a towering wall. Some traveled thousands of miles to seek his teachings, while others offered fifty bolts of silk as tuition, which he accepted. One day, he tucked the silk into his sleeve and departed, entering a humble tavern upon encountering it. There, he aided the poor and destitute, invariably bestowing goods upon the elderly, infirm, orphaned, or weak. By dusk, upon his return, the silk was entirely spent.\n\nAmong his disciples, those with aptitude for the Dao or skill in its arts were nurtured with patient guidance. He revealed the profound mysteries of thunder and lightning to many seekers, elucidating their hidden depths. When issuing talismans to disciples, each was unique, for the Perfected One established his own methods to verify the lineage’s source. Yet upon examining their subtleties, all converged in unity.\n\nSince Perfected Wang of the Celestial Court first propagated the Dao, only the Perfected One and Perfected Shen of Xiying—two branching streams—have flourished along the Western River and prospered in the eastern lands. None have surpassed them in upholding the teachings and benefiting the people.\n\nIn the autumn of the gengyin year of the Yanyou era, precisely at noon, he sat cross-legged and asked his disciples, \"What time is it?\" They replied, \"The sun stands at high noon.\" He then called for paper and brush and composed this verse:\n\n*Seventy-four years of bright moon,*\n*Ever shifting through phases of cloud and clarity.*\n*Today, the great earth shines radiant,*\n*The three realms and empty void utterly transparent.*\n\nUpon finishing, he sat upright and passed away, his countenance glowing like cinnabar.\n\nJin Pengtou\nJin Pengtou, a native of Yongjia, bore the personal name Zhiyang and the sobriquet Ye’an. His hair, perpetually unkempt in a single topknot, earned him his sobriquet. From birth, he was set apart, bold and unyielding in youth, his great aspirations unbound. As he matured, he yearned for the Dao and abandoned the world, his heart ablaze as if consumed by fire or drowning. He became a disciple of Daoist Li Yuexi of the Quanzhen tradition. Yuexi was a follower of Perfected Li Zhenchang, who in turn was a senior disciple of Perfected Qiu Changchun.\n\nAt their first meeting, Yuexi recognized his potential and sent him to travel through Yan, Zhao, Qi, and Chu to seek the guidance of earlier worthies. There, he had the fortune to attend upon Perfected Li Zhenchang. Journeying south to Yuanzhou, he encountered Dian Junzi, a garrison commander whose appearance was imposing yet unadorned. By day, he shunned worldly affairs, and by night, he lodged in spirit shrines. Sensing his extraordinary nature, the master became his disciple and gained profound insights.

      "translated_text": "At that time, the superintendent of the Primordial Dao Abbey at Mount Longhu, Master Fu Shizheng, lodged the master at Penglai Hermitage. The hermitage stood where the peaks of Zhengjun’s Sacred Well and Miaogu converged. There, the master scaled sheer cliffs and ravines, called out to deer and boars, and lay amidst clouds and mist as though it were ordinary. Sometimes, sitting upon a flat boulder at night, serpents and tigers would appear before him, only to recoil in alarm and depart. He instructed his disciples Li Quanzheng and Zhao Zhenchun to build Tianrui Hermitage atop the peak. From near and far, those who heard of his Way came knocking whenever afflicted by illness. He would offer them the fruits from his altar, and all were cured. Seekers of his teachings gathered daily.\n\nOnce, during a drought, he ascended Dragon Well and summoned the dragon forth, commanding it to heed his words. The scales of the dragon gradually shimmered, and it leapt into the sacred vessel. He admonished it sternly, and the dragon soared into the water. Soon after, a great rain fell. In the *guiyou* year of the Yuantong era (1333), he withdrew again to Mount Wuyi, residing at Zhizhi Hermitage on Jade Toad Peak. Li Taiping, the military commissioner of eastern Zhejiang, heard of him and paid him homage, saying: “When commands are strict, the people are well-ordered; when the heart is pure, desires are few.” Li grew ever more reverent.\n\nThere were those who envied him, plotting to poison him with drugs.",

The site is now called the Cinnabar-Vomiting Well.\n\nOn the first day of the first month in the *bingzi* year of the Zhiyuan era (1336), his fellow disciple Gui Xinyuan—known in the world as Gui Fengzi—attained liberation while seated in meditation on Mount Lu. Upon hearing this, the Master, on the tenth day of the fourth month, instructed his disciples to write a eulogy. Then, seated in meditation, he passed away. Thirteen days later, his face remained as if in slumber, his limbs warm and supple as in life. He was interred beside the hermitage.\n\nHis disciples—Lao Yangsu, Guo Chuchang, Li Xilai, Zhang Tianquan, Yin Pona, and Fang Fanghu—all became renowned in the world for their mastery of the Dao.\n\n*Records of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages: A Comprehensive Mirror of Daoist Attainment*, Scroll Five—concluded.\n\nWhen this work was just completed, some asked: \"This is not an annalistic biography—why call it a *Comprehensive Mirror*?\" I replied: \"A *Comprehensive Mirror* is meant to illuminate all under heaven, allowing people to see their reflections in it. Why must it be confined to annalistic form? Moreover, records of immortals and transcendents often omit dates—this alone makes annalistic arrangement impossible. Some appear in the world across hundreds or thousands of years, shifting between past and present, their beginnings and ends difficult to trace—this too defies annalistic order. The vastness of the four seas makes it impossible to survey every record, collate discrepancies, and ensure no event or figure is omitted—thus, annalistic compilation is impractical. If one rigidly adheres to annalistic form, only the broad outlines can be preserved, while events lacking clear dates would either be forced into an ill-fitting structure or excised entirely, rendering the account too sparse. How, then, could scholars use it as a standard? After careful consideration, I concluded that annalistic arrangement is unsuitable for this work. Therefore, I have drawn from limited insight, examined various records of immortals and transcendents, consulted dynastic histories, and compiled this book. In the future, should time permit, I intend to adopt the style of the *Zizhi Tongjian*, gathering all verifiable dates from immortals’ biographies to create an annalistic *Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages*. Yet even such a work could only outline the essentials, not detail every event. If later scholars of broad learning and lofty vision wish to revise or expand this book, they may follow their own aspirations.\"\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Zhao Daoyi after offering incense and bowing twice.",
