  "full_translation": "**The Esoteric Meaning of the Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Infinity for the Salvation of Humanity**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Esoteric Meaning of the Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Infinity for the Salvation of Humanity*\n**Author:** Xiao Yingsou, a Daoist of the Southern Song Dynasty\n**Volume:** Five\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Jade Instructions* Category\n\n---\n\n**Memorial on the Esoteric Meaning of the Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Infinity for the Salvation of Humanity**\n\nYour subject, Yingsou, respectfully states: Having examined *The Wondrous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for the Salvation of Humanity*, I have compiled its esoteric meaning into this work, carved onto wood for transmission.\n\nThe *Primordial Kalpa* is called the *Prior Heaven*; the *Root Chapter of the Numinous Treasure* is thus named the *Supreme Scripture*. Its transformative power may be likened to the solitary return of the elixir, yet who but the Great Brahmā could encompass its vastness?\n\nNow that its publication is complete, how dare I neglect to make this solemn declaration? With utmost reverence and awe, I bow my head in prostration.\n\nI humbly reflect: The vast and undifferentiated One Reality forms the shared body of Heaven and Earth; the myriad transformations, though diverse, share the same root in life and death. Though sentient beings differ in awareness, they all fundamentally accord with the wondrous emptiness of the formless.\n\nYet why do fame and profit stir the will, while emotions and desires delude the mind? Though the source is one, its streams diverge; though natures are near, habits grow distant. All this arises from clinging to illusion—how can one know the Eternal? The five colors dazzle the eyes—who will turn their gaze inward? The ten thousand changes bloom in profusion—who can reverse their course?\n\nOne may fortify the valley’s boat or store treasures in the abyss, yet how can one halt the sun’s chariot from departing? Rather than lamenting early death while clinging to life, it is better to cultivate the True and honor destiny.\n\nThus, our August Sovereign of the Void, the Sagely Lord, expounded the wondrous Dao before the empty kalpas; the Most High Jade Clarity, the Supreme Honored One, received the true transmission within the millet-like pearl. The salvation of beings is boundless, and the blessings bestowed are inexhaustible.\n\nYet the Great Dao is nothing but the true mean, and later generations, through repetition and distortion, have turned the contemplation of the wondrous into golden shackles, while their confusion of the source resembles fish trapped in a basin. Discoursing on emptiness and purity, they drown in suffering and void; debating cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver, they cling to what is fixed and substantial. Without understanding the transformative power of the *Ancestral Qi*, how can one fathom the subtle mysteries of the Great Brahmā?\n\nTaking the true scripture as its foundation, this work elucidates the profound mechanism without divulging its essence. In former times, crows were mistaken for horses, leading to endless confusion; today, the butcher’s eye sees no whole ox, yet his touch knows restraint. Turning the wheel of delusion to point back toward the southern homeland, damming the raging waves to follow the downward flow—may all the people below ascend to benevolence and longevity.\n\nWith utmost reverence, I contemplate the Most High August Heavenly Honored One, the Jade Emperor, Your August Jade Majesty: majestic beyond measure, vast beyond naming, impartial and selfless, penetrating even the most hidden, ever benefiting beings with goodness, ever saving beings without abandoning a single one. Thus, You have permitted even one of such modest talent as I to dare compose this humble work. If it may contribute even a ten-thousandth part, I pray You deign to regard my earnest devotion.\n\nIf it offers not even the slightest benefit, I can but hope for pardon of my presumption.\n\nThis inner teaching, comprising one work in two scrolls, has been carved onto printing blocks and compiled. Humbly submitted to the Department of State Affairs, I beseech that it be presented for imperial consideration. With trepidation, I offer this memorial for Your August Majesty’s perusal, dreading the offense to Your celestial majesty.\n\nI, Your servant, am awestruck and trembling, bowing my head to the ground in reverence.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nOn the seventh day of the seventh month, the first day of which was *jiayin*, in the second year of the *Baoqing* reign, cyclical year *bingxu* (17th August, 1226), Your servant Xiao Yingsou, Master of the Three Radiant Realms of the Great Cavern of Supreme Purity and the Mysterious Capital, respectfully presents this memorial.\n\n---\n\n**Essential Meaning of the Scripture**\n\nThe Most High is the Supreme of the Boundless, the inception of the Primordial Beginning. Prior to the existence of one’s father and mother, a single spark of true yang essence—when the two *qi* interact—gives rise to the two kidneys. Once the kidneys are formed, the two eyes emerge. Then, the five viscera gather and coalesce, shaping the countenance, and only then does the body exist. This is called *the Cavern*.\n\n*The Cavern* refers to the fully formed physical frame, the descent into birth as a human being—here, one merely perceives the body. *The Mysterious* denotes the essence of the Mysterious Unity. Once the body exists, the essence is preserved at the *Guanyuan* (Gate of Origin). When essence is preserved at *Guanyuan*, *qi* circulates throughout; when *qi* circulates, spirit is whole. With spirit whole, the hundred apertures open, and the myriad things respond.\n\nThe eyes, permeated with light, can see all things; the nose, opened to its pores, can detect fragrances; the ears, unsealed, can hear sounds; the mouth, connected to the heart, can savor all flavors. When these four are fully developed, one becomes numinous. This is what is meant by \"among the ten thousand things, humans are the most numinous.\"\n\nYet humans, though numinous, fail to awaken. The reason one may attain longevity and agelessness lies in preserving the singular numinosity, preventing its dissipation outward. Let the eyes not gaze upon forms, so that the *hun*-soul guards the liver, consolidating the wood-*qi* without leakage. Let the nose not perceive fragrances, so that the *po*-soul guards the lungs, consolidating the metal-*qi* without leakage. Let the ears not heed sounds, so that essence guards the kidneys, consolidating the water-*qi* without leakage. Let the mouth not speak, so that spirit guards the heart, consolidating the fire-*qi* without leakage. Let the entire body sit upright, the four great elements unmoving, so that intent guards the spleen, consolidating the earth-*qi* without leakage.\n\nWhen the five directions are firmly rooted, spirit, *qi*, and essence merge into one, returning to the origin and reverting to the root to fulfill destiny. Then, the myriad spirits gather, transforming into an infant. Abandoning the illusory husk, one moves freely without entanglement with creation, merging with the Dao in truth—this is the treasure.\n\nOne who attains this treasure within the body moves with unrestrained freedom, drifting carefree, ever-springing and ageless, sharing the same eternal rest as Heaven. By emitting true *qi*, one can transmute earth and stone into treasures; by emitting true *qi*, one can revive withered bones into living beings; by emitting true *qi*, one can cure the ten thousand ailments, and all maladies heal of themselves; by emitting true *qi*, one can repel malevolent spirits, and they vanish of themselves; by emitting true *qi*, one can stir wind and thunder, and they resound of themselves. By emitting true *qi*, one can sustain the ten thousand things, and they flourish of themselves; by emitting true *qi*, one can deliver lost souls, and they are freed of themselves—this is the boundless salvation of beings.\n\nThe highest grade is the Great Vehicle’s method. *The Wondrous* is the swift path to the profound and obscure. *The Scripture* is the road to cultivating truth. If one can recite its words and inwardly grasp its mysteries, then with every thought, there will be a mysterious response. As for cultivating truth and learning the Dao, saving the living and delivering the dead—all is contained herein. Practice it in secrecy, and one may attain the Dao.\n\nThe meaning of the *Scripture of Wondrous Treasure* is vast and its principles profound; without delving deeply, seeking the hidden, and plumbing the mysterious to its subtleties, it is not easily fathomed. Yet I say otherwise. Thus, the Scripture states: \"If one attains the One, all things are complete.\" Would the Heavenly Worthy create arduous matters to confuse people? In all daily actions and ordinary conduct, this Scripture is present.\n\nThose who thoroughly investigate it are like the wealthy observing drinking vessels: though goblets, cups, and chalices lie scattered before them, they know them to be gold. What difficulty is there? Those who do not observe well are led astray by the vessels—how could they not be confused?\n\nThis Scripture is simply the Dao. Its wondrous discourse on profound principles, its subtle elucidation of grand names—all are but the branching of the *fan-qi* (Brahma-*qi*) and the revelation of true emptiness. When people engage with circumstances, they scatter and find it hard to enter. To clarify this Scripture, one should measure oneself against creation: that is as it is, and I am as it is. Observe carefully and contemplate deeply, and one will surely find resonance.\n\nNot only is this true of this Scripture; the entire canon of teachings is thus. As the elder Su of Laoquan said: \"That which Heaven bestows upon me—can it be by chance? What it bestows must have a use for me. If I know it but do not practice it, nor share it with others, though Heaven intends to use it, I cast it aside—this is called abandoning Heaven. To humble oneself in seeking fortune through its words, to belittle oneself in seeking to employ its Dao—how does Heaven bestow upon me, and how do I respond thus? This is called profaning Heaven.\"\n\nAbandoning Heaven is my sin; profaning Heaven is also my sin. I have always taken this as a warning. Reflecting on Heaven’s grace, the polishing of teachers and friends, and my glimpse of the essence of the *Wondrous Treasure*—this, too, is Heaven bestowing upon me. Having received it, I strive to practice it, not daring to abandon Heaven. Explaining it in detail and guarding it carefully, I dare not profane Heaven. Neither abandoning nor profaning, I wander in it, rest in it, cultivate in it, and preserve it in it—this is my aspiration.\n\nIf like-minded individuals know of it and wish to share it with others, I fear profaning Heaven and decline. They then say: \"Have you not heard of Li Guangxuan’s story? Long ago, Guangxuan diligently sought the Dao for many years. One day, on Shaoshi Mountain, he encountered an extraordinary person who asked him: 'In your quest for the Dao, should you not also uplift the people of the world?'\"\n\n\"Should you only perfect yourself? If it is solely for one’s own person, even immortals would not accept it. Have you not heard of the foolish man of Song? Long ago, a foolish man of Song obtained a swallow stone and treasured it as a precious jewel. A visitor from Zhou heard of it and came to see it, chuckling and saying: 'This is merely a swallow stone—no different from a common tile.' The foolish man grew furious and guarded it all the more stubbornly. If your words are correct, then you are of the same class as Li Guangxuan; if your reasoning is flawed, then you tread the path of the foolish man of Song. If you share it with others, those of great wisdom may correct your errors, open your obstructions, and enlighten your understanding—not only benefiting others, but also bringing profound gain to you from Heaven. Though I am dull of wit, I respectfully heed these words. Thus, I have selected the commentaries of Yan, Xue, Cheng, and Li, extracting their clearest explanations, and appended the teachings of my teachers and friends beneath each line—these are the small characters in the main scroll, to clarify the meaning of the scripture. As for the principle being revealed through the image and the image being illuminated by the principle, the essence of the scripture and the cinnabar Dao being one and without distinction, I have appended the explanations of the images and recorded them afterward. Though my gaze is but a pipe’s view of the sky and my measure a gourd’s dip of the sea, and I have not plumbed even the tiniest fraction, this is the extent of my capacity. Alas!\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Those who understand me do so through the *Spring and Autumn Annals*; those who condemn me do so through the *Spring and Autumn Annals*.\"\n\nIn the second year of the Baoqing reign, cyclical year *bingxu*, on the first day of the seventh month, the *jiayin* day, recorded by Xiaoying the Daoist of Guanfu.\n\n**Chart of the Wondrous Transformations of the Supreme Ultimate and the Numinous Chaos of the Vermilion Writ of Hun Dun**\n\nThe Vermilion Writ of *Hun Dun*—the Non-Ultimate’s Supreme Perfection—is what is called \"the Non-Ultimate and yet the Supreme Ultimate.\" At the primordial beginning of the ancestral kalpa, it gave birth to the myriad heavens, unfolding the Three Luminaries, thus becoming the root of Heaven. With no ancestor beyond itself, its body is the Dao alone—this is what is meant by \"the Supreme Ultimate moves and generates yang.\" When movement reaches its limit, it becomes still; stillness generates yin; when stillness reaches its limit, it moves again. One movement, one stillness, each the root of the other. Yin and yang divide, and the Two Modes are established.\n\nThe Five Scripts unfold and expand—this is what is meant by \"yang transforms, yin conjoins, and water, fire, wood, metal, and earth are born.\" The five *qi* flow in sequence, and the four seasons proceed. The Five Phases are one yin-yang; yin-yang is one Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate is fundamentally the Non-Ultimate. The generation of the Five Phases, each with its own nature.\n\nUniversally planting the numinous, without script there is no illumination, no clarity, no establishment, no completion, no deliverance, no generation. This is what is meant by \"the true of the Non-Ultimate, the essence of the Two and Five, wondrously conjoined and congealed.\" The Way of Qian forms the male; the Way of Kun forms the female. The two *qi* interact and transform, giving birth to the myriad things. The myriad things, endlessly generating and transforming, are inexhaustible.\n\nThe scholar must investigate its words and seek its meaning, then the Way of Prior Heaven will unconsciously align, and the wondrous workings of creation may be glimpsed. Thus, the Confucian, knowing the causes of the hidden and the manifest, encompasses the myriad things, traces beginnings to return to endings, exhausts principle and fulfills nature, and attains the wondrous mystery beyond life and death. Laozi, however, says: \"Deeply root, firmly stem, for long life and enduring vision.\" Each has its own tradition.\n\nIf this is so, how then is it to be achieved?\n\nThe Scripture states: \"Know the masculine, yet guard the feminine, and return to the state of the infant. Know the white, yet guard the black, and return to the boundless.\" This is the Way of the Golden Elixir and Returning Cinnabar, by which one may deeply root and firmly stem, attaining long life and enduring vision.\n\n**Diagram of the Body’s Symbolism of Yin-Yang Ascending and Descending**\n*Analogy:*\nThis body is the furnace and stove of Heaven and Earth; the Central Palace is the crucible, while the space beyond the body is the Great Void. The Qian Palace is the Sea of Marrow; the Kun Palace is the Chamber of Essence; the Chamber of Spirit and the Cinnabar Crucible are called the Three Palaces. Qian and Kun are the warp and woof of Heaven and Earth. Yin and yang circulate within them. Heaven and Earth are the great forge; yin and yang are the mechanism of transformation; the single *qi* is the medicinal substance.\n\nIn refining the elixir, one relies on the *qi* of Qian and Kun, the male and female, nurturing them through the cyclical stars to form the crucible. The Golden Mother resides within, employing the wondrous generative *qi* to interact and stimulate, a process called cultivation and refinement. When yang essence blazes daily and the true spirit transforms and generates, it is called the Sacred Embryo. When yin is shed and yang is pure, it is called the Infant. This is what is meant by the Great One containing the true, harmonizing with the void, and returning to the boundless.\n\nThe locus of the Spirit Chamber and the mechanism of nurturing must not be lightly disclosed, for oaths and pacts govern their transmission. The teacher must clearly instruct to avoid misleading the aspirant into the depths of delusion.\n\n**The Eight Rings of the Diagram:**\n1. The first ring, with the Eight Trigrams, represents Earth. The Eight Trigrams form images and interact.\n2. The second ring, with the twenty-eight constellations, represents Heaven. It clarifies the great reckoning of the celestial cycles, beginning with the Celestial Origin.\n3. The third ring, with thirty waxings and wanings, represents the fire phases of a month, corresponding to the sixty hexagrams and their interactions.\n4. The fourth ring, with one hundred white and black dots, represents the yin tally and yang fire of the water clock, corresponding to the celestial tally’s movement and stillness.\n5. The fifth ring, with twelve hexagrams, represents the advancing and retreating of the lines, the rising and falling of the Dragon and Tiger.\n6. The sixth ring, with the twelve earthly branches, represents the fire phases’ ascent and descent, gathering the celestial tally.\n7. The seventh ring reveals the great reckoning of the celestial cycle, resonating with the four seasons and five phases, corresponding to the inner symbolism.\n8. The eighth ring arranges the myriad images of yin, yang, and the five phases into the crucible, assisting the Gold Fire and Dragon Tiger, the Li Woman and Kan Man, the yin and yang spouses. Through their union, true cinnabar and true mercury are generated, forming the divine elixir.\n\nThe above is the *Diagram of Fire Phases in the Great Return’s Heart-Mirror* by Zhenyizi Peng Xiao, adopted to elucidate the use of the Great Brahma’s esoteric language.\n\n**Recitation of Scriptures and Precepts**\nThere are the Five Precepts and the Ten Useless Matters. The method of reciting scriptures must be understood: purify oneself with fasting and bathing, cast aside worldly concerns, and align inner and outer to do good.\n\nI have witnessed the method of scripture recitation by the Supreme Pole’s Immortal Ge, which includes the Five Precepts and the Ten Useless Matters. The noble seeker of goodness who adheres to these words will gain boundless benefits—far beyond merely ascending and transcending oneself, for blessings will flow to descendants as well.\n\n**The Five Precepts:**\n1. Do not recite with the mouth while the heart resists.\n2. Do not treat the words and principles with disdain.\n3. Do not conceive of oneself as a living person.\n4. Be humble and defer to the teacher’s guidance.\n5. Practice compassion and guidance, mutually enlightening one another.\n\n**The Ten Useless Matters:**\n1. Disloyalty to the sovereign.\n2. Lack of filial piety toward parents.\n3. Lack of kindness toward all beings.\n4. Clinging to ignorance and comparing self and others.\n5. Envying the worthy and resenting those superior to oneself.\n6. Slandering the good and humiliating the orphaned and poor.\n7. Engaging in malicious speech and double-tongued gossip.\n8. Deceiving the heart and harming beings.\n9. Indulging in wine and meat, and favoring depravity.\n10. Giving rise to greed, anger, hatred, and attachment.\n\nIf one can adhere to these, what disaster will not be averted, what sin will not be dissolved? The names will be recorded in the heavens, and demon kings will vouch for one. Otherwise, even a lifetime of recitation will not bring the desired blessings and wisdom.\n\nThe noble and enlightened should take heed and be cautious.\n\n**Method of Recitation (for Daoists and laypersons, men and women alike):**\nPurify the fast within, free from distracting thoughts, and abstain from rich foods and meat externally. Enter the *jing*—a purified chamber. Don the ritual attire (a robe or jacket will suffice, as long as it is clean).\n\nTap the teeth to align the central incisors, sounding the Dharma Drum to gather the body’s spirits. Burn incense—abundant and fragrant—to convey sincerity.\n\nBow to the four directions (east, south, west, north), then to the four corners (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest), and finally to the above and below, one bow each. After bowing, sit facing east. The bowing to the ten directions relates to the scripture’s content. A bow of the heart surpasses a bow of the body. Facing east follows the order of ascending to heaven, from east to west. Sit upright—whether cross-legged or with feet hanging, there is no strict rule.\n\nNext, tap the teeth, recite the *Heart-Mouth Purification Mantra* and the *Body Purification Mantra* to adorn the body’s spirits. Then tap the teeth and recite the *Heaven-Earth Purification Mantra* and the *Scripture’s Mysterious Essence Mantra*. After reciting these mantras, open the scroll and begin the scripture recitation. The remaining precepts and details are fully annotated below.\n\n**The Inner Meaning of the Supreme Scripture of Limitless Salvation, First Scroll**\n*Observations by Guanfuzi Xiao Yingsou:*\nAccording to the *Numinous Treasure Great Method*, the *Scripture of Salvation* encompasses seven matters, broadly outlined as follows:\n- The Primordial *Qi* of the Origin, before formlessness—how can it be compared?\n- Descending to form *qi*, transforming and generating the myriad treasures—what is its present manifestation?\n- Refining this *qi* into treasure and ingesting it to ascend as a perfected being.\n\nI observe that the former perfected and supreme sages revealed this single principle as the supreme mechanism of life and death, the great essential of nature and destiny. Without the Way of the Golden Elixir and Returning Cinnabar, how could the mystery of the Primordial *Qi* of the Origin be illuminated? Exhaustively probing the subtle and profound, pursuing the abstruse and wondrous, dredging forth divine grace to irrigate the field of immortality—such is the intent.\n\n**The Supreme Scripture of Limitless Salvation from the Numinous Treasure of the Supreme Mystery**\nThis scripture is revered by the myriad sages and venerated by all perfected beings. It is supreme beyond all, mysterious beyond the mysterious.\n\nMoreover, *Dongxuan Lingbao* (\"Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure\") is the general designation of its ranks and grades, while *Wu Liang Du Ren* (\"Limitless Salvation of Humankind\") is the title of this particular scroll. Revered as the source of all scriptures, it is thus called the \"Supreme Grade\"; through it the Dao is illuminated, hence it is termed the \"Wondrous Scripture.\"\n\nOur dynasty’s True Sovereign, Emperor Zhenzong, composed a preface stating: *The Great Change* imparts its teachings, originating in the utmost numinous; *Hunyuan* (\"Primal Origin\") sets forth its writings, rooted in the wondrous Dao. It accords with the unfathomable of yin and yang, and marks the indescribable of profound silence. For it expounds the action of non-action, manifests the form of the formless, encompasses the hidden and assists the subtle, concealing its function while revealing its benevolence. Vast and obscure, it transforms the people and nurtures all things. Though its systems differ across past and present, its instruction and guidance converge as one.\n\nAs for the sacred texts stored in the hidden chambers, the secret records on the luminous terrace, the jade-bound scrolls in profusion, the cinnabar-sealed cases in abundance—these were transmitted down from the loftiest perfected beings through the walled cities of the turtle-gate, flowing through the kalpas of Red Brightness and Dragon Han in accord with the cycles of fate. Such truths transcend what sight and hearing can perceive, existing beyond the realm of names and words. They assist in perfecting the utmost governance and gradually permeate all beings.\n\nFirst emerging among the nine schools, standing firm through the ages, even amid the tumult of war and strife, who would find time to employ them? Yet in times when \"the insects and fish are all at peace,\" who would deem them dispensable?\n\nThe *Scripture of Salvation* is the wondrous utterance of the Primordial Beginning, the precious proclamation of the Jade Dawn. In the Floating Black Realm, it records the initial transmission; in the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, it reveals the traces of its concealed treasures. It is the hidden rhyme of all heavens, the immortal hymn of the Great Brahmā. Its eight-cornered radiance descends from divine brushstrokes; its thousand *qi*-guardians array in defense, universally delivering the numinous essence of humankind.\n\nThose who nurture their essence in roundness and squareness, who receive harmony between heaven and earth, who diminish selfishness and desire, who turn from falsity to return to truth, who purify their thoughts through solemn fasting and cleanse their hearts through recitation—when their focus accumulates externally and purity fills them internally, they may obscure themselves to become luminous, illuminating all that is hidden. Like a vacant chamber generating brightness, like a warm spring dispelling evil, they ascend the springtime terrace in joy, mounting the realm of longevity in solemnity. Where utmost sincerity reaches, what bound is there to the blessings bestowed?\n\nHow magnificent! As for the *Lingbao* (\"Numinous Treasure\"), some say *ling* (\"numinous\") is the transformation of the sagely, and *bao* (\"treasure\") is what is cherished and esteemed. Others say *ling* is the general term for all sages, and *bao* is what all sages treasure. Still others say *ling* denotes boundless transformation, while *bao* denotes reverence and precious love. Some say *ling* is in heaven, and *bao* is on earth. Others say the divine descends as *ling*, and *qi* gathers as *bao*.\n\nAs it is said: \"The benevolent see it and call it spirit; the wise see it and call it wisdom. The common people use it daily yet do not know it.\" Thus, we forcibly give it form to respond to transformation, establish teachings, govern things, and benefit life.\n\n*Qi* refined to utmost subtlety becomes formless; vastness reaches the point of being unencompassable. Taking examples from afar or near—from things or from the self—it is great as heaven and earth, minute yet not departing from the tiniest detail. Manifest, it is the sun and moon; hidden, it is yin and yang. In Confucianism, it is benevolence and righteousness; in Buddhism, it is wisdom and knowledge. In humans, it is spirit and *qi*; in the elixir, it is mercury and lead. It lodges in the nature and emotions of the myriad things, unites the primordial *qi* as creation—yet in truth, it is all the Dao.\n\nOnly those who comprehend can unify it. Yet those who cling to illusion and lose sight of reality, who follow their emotions and chase after things, cause the numinous source to rupture and the wondrous root to scatter. They cannot return to youth and recover from decay.\n\nThus, the *Chapter on Generating Spirit* states: \"When a person attains rebirth in the human realm, bathing their form in the Great Yang, it shakes heaven and earth—such honor is hard to surpass. Heavenly perfected and earthly spirits, the three realms all attend, for it is not lightly bestowed. At the time of birth, one is not deemed base. Yet people, having received life, fail to honor their *qi*, treasure their form, cherish their life, or love their spirit. They bring about their own decay and death, departing from their original truth.\"\n\nThe *Scripture of Western Ascension* says: \"Life births me in emptiness, places me in nothingness. What gives me life is spirit; what kills me is the heart. Accumulated *qi* and gathered blood form my body. The body is the chariot of spirit, the abode of spirit, the master of spirit. When tranquil, spirit resides within; when restless, spirit departs.\"\n\nThe *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: \"For long life, be most cautious in the chamber of intimacy—why invite death and make the spirit weep? The inch-field and foot-dwelling can cultivate life; if you breach the sea, the hundred streams will pour out. Leaves fall, the tree withers, losing its verdancy; *qi* perishes, fluids leak—this is no longer one’s true form.\"\n\n*Zhuangzi* said: \"Our life has limits, but knowledge has none. To pursue the limitless with the limited is perilous.\" He also said: \"Human life is the gathering of *qi*. When it gathers, there is life; when it scatters, there is death. If the form labors without rest, it wears out; if essence is used without cease, it exhausts. Exhaustion leads to depletion.\"\n\nThe Grand Historian said: \"What gives life to humans is spirit; what it relies upon is form. If spirit is overused, it depletes; if form is overworked, it wears out. When form and spirit separate, death comes. The dead cannot be revived; the departed cannot return. Thus, the sage values them highly.\"\n\nCarefully observing these words, all point to returning to the root and restoring the source. Therefore, the natural *Lingbao* Dao and the principle of the Great Return of Golden Fluid have been admired by those who comprehend, and such people have never been lacking through the ages.\n\nThe Supreme Lord revealed the method of guidance and proclaimed to humankind: \"Constantly abide in desirelessness to observe its mystery; constantly abide in desire to observe its subtlety.\" The Buddhist tradition also says: \"People are turned by things; if one can turn things, one is the same as the Tathāgata.\"\n\nThus, the Daoist and Buddhist teachings each possess principles for transcending life and death. Buddhism takes nature as its foundation, hence it cultivates meditation and stillness. Daoism takes spirit as its master, hence it refines the golden elixir. The utmost of meditation and stillness is quiescence in yin; the utmost of the golden elixir is return to yang. These two emerge from the same source but differ in application. Both achieve true perfection from the root of what gives life, not through reliance on external things or artificial creation.\n\nThe spirit and nature may be grasped intuitively but cannot be dissected by reason. To dissect them is to invite confusion and dispute, creating divisions between self and other; to grasp them intuitively is to harmonize differences, erasing distinctions between this and that. This is the wondrous Dao of the supreme and perfect truth—thus, the myriad methods and thousand gates are none other than the numinous treasure.\n\nThe *True Record of the Primordial Unity* states: Since the Dragon Han era, Lord Lao has divided his body to teach and transform, revealing true scriptures in the Central Heaven Great Blessing Hall Kingdom, the Southern Culmen Vermilion Brightness Kingdom, the Eastern Culmen Floating Black Kingdom, the Western Culmen Western Na Kingdom, and the Northern Culmen Yü-tan Kingdom—within these five, all received the teachings of the Numinous Treasure. Moreover, during the Xia dynasty, he bestowed upon Yu the Five Talismans of the Numinous Treasure and the True Scriptures of the Numinous Treasure. He also transformed to address the Hu king, saying: \"In the Central Lands, I constantly employ the Daoist methods to enlighten the people of the world.\" The king asked: \"What are the Daoist methods?\" Lord Lao replied: \"The Daoist methods are none other than the Supreme Numinous Treasure, born before heaven and earth, vast enough to embrace all, subtle enough to contain all. Without it, heaven could not shine; without it, earth could not manifest form.\"\n\nWithout this, spirits cannot enter the hidden; without this, humans cannot be born or completed—thus the teeming ten thousand things take the Dao as their root. The serpent that attains it becomes a dragon; the bird that attains it becomes a phoenix; the beast that attains it becomes a qilin; the ordinary person who attains it becomes an immortal. Those who cultivate it roam the Great Void, transform their five viscera, alter their form and appearance, command ghosts and spirits, and appear or vanish at will—this is the Way of the Upper Immortals.\n\nThe king said: \"What you speak of as the Numinous Treasure is indeed rare. From this, it seems that what is called ‘attaining’ and ‘cultivating’ it—what is it, in the end?\" Thereupon it was known that the Numinous Treasure and the Golden Elixir emerge from the same source but bear different names.\n\nThe *Scriptures of the Numinous Treasure* were bestowed by the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign upon the Yellow Emperor at Mount Emei. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign also transmitted them to Emperor Ku at the Terrace of Pastoral Virtue. Xia Yu received them in full at Mount Zhong, while Helü of Wu secretly glimpsed them at Mount Gouqu. Later, figures such as Ge Xiaoxian and Zheng Siyuan, master and disciple, passed them down in an unbroken lineage—this is how the scriptural teachings emerged.\n\nThe Dao says: The words of the Supreme Jade Dawn Dao Lord are the words of the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy. Formerly, he received the scriptures from the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void Sovereign, compiled them into volumes, and concealed them in the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Mysterious Capital. The Dao Lord transmitted them to the Perfected of the Mysterious Unity, whence they spread.\n\nIn the past, within the Primordial Azure Heaven—\nThe Eastern Nine Qi form the Azure Heaven.\n\"Primordial\" is the name of the inception of the Five Directions;\n\"Azure\" is the color of the East.\nThe Azure Empyrean resounds with celestial song in the Great Floating Li Land—\nThis heaven’s qi is azure and emerald, its radiance vast and boundless, hence called the Azure Empyrean.\nThe numinous wind and jade trees strike celestial melodies in the void, hence called \"celestial song.\"\nThe Great Floating Li Land is the kingdom of the Eastern Culmen’s Great Floating Li.\nThere, the Dao Lord received the *Primordial Beginning’s Scripture on the Salvation of Innumerable Beings of the Supreme Grade*.\n\nThe Dao Lord said: \"In that heaven and that land, I formerly received the wondrous scriptures of the Void Sovereign Heavenly Worthy, widely delivering humans and gods. The merit is beyond reckoning—this is the true essence of the Supreme Grade.\"\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: Of heaven and earth’s vastness and the tiniest of creatures, all things bound by form and subject to number are born and completed by embodying the workings of creation. The Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy’s opening of the scriptures—\"In the Primordial Azure Heaven, the Azure Empyrean resounds with celestial song in the Great Floating Li Land\"—reveals the inception of creation.\n\nThings are born from earth and return to earth, thus the *Scripture of the Hidden Correspondences* says: \"Fire is born from wood; when calamity erupts, it must be subdued.\" Those who know this and refine it are called sages.\n\nWithin wood lies fire; if unleashed without restraint, it reduces all to flying ash and vanishing smoke, leaving no trace of its original nature. Those who restrain it, though fire scorches wood to cinders, gather it into earth—once it becomes earth, its original nature is preserved.\n\nThe Primordial Azure Heaven is the sprouting of grain;\nThe Azure Empyrean’s celestial song is the symbol of fire.\nThe Eastern Culmen’s Great Floating Li Land is all of azure jade, ever generating azure radiance. There are also the verdant forests, whose trees, stirred by wind, produce sounds like cavernous hymns, resplendent and luminous throughout the Great Void.\n\nThe Floating Li Kingdom belongs to the Jade Prosperity Heaven of the Northeast. The Northeast is the *yin* position, the land where fire is born. The wind-stirred verdant forests—verdant is the color of wood, and \"forest\" is two trees. Guan Yin said: \"When two woods rub, fire is born.\" Trees are also wood. Wood and wind are *xun*. The Daoist in Hemp Robes said: \"Earth two generates fire,\" for the qi of *li* is conceived within *xun* wood. The resplendence and luminosity throughout the Great Void are the symbol of fire’s brilliance. The azure radiance’s vastness and boundlessness resemble the void’s sound in their emptiness and clarity—hence \"Azure Empyrean celestial song.\" The Great Floating Li Land is the root of earth. Earth is the foundation of the Returned Elixir. The Returned Elixir is the Way of returning to the origin.\n\nThe scripture says: \"Attain utmost emptiness, guard deep stillness; as the ten thousand things arise together, I observe their return.\" The teeming things each return to their root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called the restoration of life—this is the principle of returning. The *Book of Changes*’ *Fu* hexagram embodies this. *Fu* is the Way of yin and yang’s return. Thus it is said: \"*Fu* reveals the heart of heaven and earth.\" Heaven and earth are the body of yin and yang; \"heart\" clarifies their function. Heaven moves and earth is still; yang moves and yin is still. When heaven’s movement reaches its limit, yin is born; when earth’s stillness reaches its limit, yang is born. This is the stripping away above and the returning below—movement and stillness wax and wane, thus revealing their heart. Humans are the same.\n\nIn the *Fu* hexagram, one yang lies beneath five yins, its body *zhen* below and *kun* above. *Zhen* is wood—the Primordial Azure Heaven. Wood generates fire—the Azure Empyrean’s celestial song. Fire generates earth—thus *kun* earth is the Great Floating Li Land.\n\nThe Azure Empyrean’s celestial song, in terms of the scriptures, is qi and sound, emerging from nonbeing into being. In terms of the Elixir, *zhen* wood and *kun* earth each have their solid substance, yet within their emptiness appears the symbol of fire. From this, one may clearly understand the scriptural purport and the natural alignment of the Elixir Way with the workings of creation.\n\nEarth is the root of creation, thus earth generates metal, called \"void qi.\" The Metal Embryo is truly the primordial ancestral qi, hence it is said: \"Received the *Primordial Beginning’s Scripture on the Salvation of Innumerable Beings of the Supreme Grade*.\" \"Primordial Beginning\" is the ancestral qi—the indestructible primordial spirit from past kalpas, called True Lead, which serves as the mother of the Elixir.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Dragon and Tiger* says: \"Metal and fire are True Lead.\" In the art of the Elixir, nothing is more essential than metal and fire. The Perfected Zhang Ziyang’s *Awakening to Reality* states:\n\"Fire is born from wood, wood conceals its edge;\nWithout skill in drilling and grinding, do not force it.\nCalamity erupts only because it harms oneself—\nOne must seek to subdue it and find the Metal Duke.\"\n\nIt also says:\n\"If *li* and *kan* lack *wu* and *ji*,\nThough they contain the Four Images, no Elixir is formed.\"\n\nAll this arises from the mutual embrace of True Earth between them, thus enabling the Golden Elixir to return and revert. From this, the Dao of the Elixir may be clearly discerned, and its fruition truly witnessed.\n\nThe Chan master of Zhaozhou said:\n\"A golden Buddha cannot pass through the furnace,\nA wooden Buddha cannot pass through fire,\nA clay Buddha cannot pass through water—\nHow then may *I* be delivered?\nIf you would deliver *me*,\nNone but *I* can deliver *me*.\"\n\nThus this Dao is the return of my spirit, the restoration of my nature, and the deliverance of my body. Each delivers oneself—none remains undelivered. Without limit or number, this is the Supreme Vehicle. Hence it is called *the Supreme Grade Scripture on the Salvation of Innumerable Beings*.\n\nThe *Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning*—this is the responsive title of the *Vacuous Sovereign*, arising from the True and manifesting in the phenomenal, termed *realization through cultivation*. The subtle contemplation of the profound source is the unique possession of one’s own nature. The *Scripture of Cavernous Spirit* states: \"The wondrous image is formless; responsive resonance takes bodily form.\"\n\nWhen this scripture is expounded—\n*Scripture* means *path*: it is by this that one may proceed to attain the Dao.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* says: \"The *Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning* is the ancestral qi of the Dharmakāya—the so-called *original face*, the indestructible primordial spirit, termed *True Lead*.\" When this scripture is expounded, it clarifies that ancestral qi is the essence of the Elixir.\n\nLord Lao told Master Yin: \"If you can know the One, all things are complete. Seal off passions and desires, enter the inner chamber, refine metal and ingest qi—this is foremost. If you can know this, guard it and do not lose it.\"\n\nHe also said:\n\"Red Lead and Black Tin are the great heads of the Elixir;\nEntering the Black from the Red is true cultivation.\nExtract essence from the Black, marrow from the Red—\nIf you can resolve the Red and Black, the medicine is peerless.\nUsing the Red to enter the Black ensures longevity;\nUsing the Black to enter the Red ascends to celestial immortality.\"\n\nHe further said:\n\"One is Lead, and Lead is the sovereign;\nTwo is Mercury, and Mercury is the minister.\nIf Lead is not true, Mercury will not draw near;\nIf Lead is true, the household minister is not lost.\nThe Green-Waisted Envoy, the Red-Blooded General—\nHarmonizing the two clans, distinct yet united in fellowship.\nWhite Mercury becomes the brain, Yellow Sprout the root.\nTransform Lead into powder, refine Mercury into dust.\nYin resides in the position of Yang, Yang’s number and Yin’s are balanced.\nThe moon waxes as the sun wanes; cold and heat are distinct.\nThe symbolic configurations are established, resplendent in pattern.\nOnly this Dao of mine endures with Heaven and Earth.\"\n\nThe principle of expounding this scripture is thus made manifest.\n\nSomeone may ask: \"In this scripture, only cultivation, recitation, salvation of the living, and deliverance of the dead are mentioned—where are the principles of Dragon and Tiger, Kan and Li, cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver?\"\n\nThe answer: \"The Great Dao is without fixed form; it lodges in things to reveal its principles. Consider the *Book of Changes*: it begins with the primordial qi, divides into Yin and Yang, whose interplay of hardness and softness generates endless transformations. Fu Xi drew its hexagrams to illuminate the Dao; Shen Nong modeled tools upon it. Yao used it to face south as sovereign; Shun practiced it facing north as minister. King Wen unfolded it to exhaust the wonders of creation; Confucius expanded it to plumb the depths of Heaven and Earth. Laozi borrowed it to expound the aims of the Elixir; Master Mayi employed it to speak of the mechanisms of transformation. Chen Tuan distinguished its images and numbers; Lü Dongbin discoursed on nature and destiny; Shao Yong investigated the Prior Heaven; Zhou Dunyi and Zhang Zai established the Supreme Ultimate. Some explored the principles of things, others deduced divination—its round mechanism encompasses ten thousand transformations, never confined to one aspect. How is the Dao of this scripture different?\"\n\nAs the saying goes: \"One who knows ritual but not the spirit is no adept of long life.\" Transcending principle to enter the spirit, merging with qi, acting without acting yet accomplishing all—this is the true teaching of my tradition.\n\nThus Master Yin said: \"Those who are skilled in my Dao, within a single thing, know Heaven and exhaust the spirit, attaining the mysterious and reaching the ultimate destiny. Those who lose it chase after differences, splitting names while the reality remains the same; those who attain it harmonize in sameness, though intentions and names may differ.\"\n\nCirculating ten times to summon the ten directions—\nThe *Inner Meaning* says: \"Expounding the scripture ten times in a cycle summons the true sages and lofty worthies of Heaven and Earth. Refining the Elixir for ten months to completion is the work of circulating the essence and quintessence of Yin and Yang.\"\n\nThus circulating ten times comprises the generating number five and the completing number five. Heaven One is Water, Earth Two is Fire, Heaven Three is Wood, Earth Four is Metal, Heaven Five is Earth. Earth Six is Lead, Heaven Seven is Mercury, Earth Eight is Cinnabar, Heaven Nine is Silver, Earth Ten is the Elixir. Summoning the ten directions comprises the odd numbers—One, Three, Five, Seven, Nine—Yang; and the even numbers—Two, Four, Six, Eight, Ten—Yin. This is the wondrous function of the Returned Elixir; as for the subtle workings of creation, they are detailed below.\n\nAt the commencement of the assembly,\nThe *Vacuous Sovereign Celestial Worthy* ascends to the seat.\nThe celestial perfected, supreme sages, and lofty worthies,\nThe wondrously practicing immortals, and the innumerable hosts—\nThese are the five hundred million heavens,\nThe eight spherical worlds,\nThe Three Origins and Nine Saints,\nThe Nine Perfected and Nine Immortals,\nThe sun, moon, and stars,\nThe celestial and terrestrial spirits—\nArrive riding the void,\nFlying upon cinnabar clouds in the rosy dawn,\nAmidst the clouds of the Three Primes and the crimson mists.\nGreen carriages and jade wheels,\nFeathered canopies casting shade.\nWhen the Queen Mother of the West transmitted the scripture to Emperor Wu of Han, all the vessels, texts, and regalia followed Han dynasty conventions. Observing the present, one knows the past—thus no further details are given.\nRadiant jade light streams forth,\nFive colors billowing in profusion,\nIlluminating the vastness of the Great Void.\n\nThe streaming essence is the radiance of the sun, moon, and stars; the jade light is the perfect image of the immortals and perfected beings. The five colors interweave, illuminating the Great Void.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* states: When one first approaches the seat, it is the Metal Mother entering the chamber. When the Metal Mother is in the chamber, she summons the Two Non-Beings to the Yellow Path and gathers the Three Natures in the Primordial Palace. The Five Phases cluster together, the Four Symbols harmonize—this is called the arrival of the Heavenly Perfected Great Spirits, the Lofty and Exalted Sages, the Wondrous-Practicing Perfected Ones, and the innumerable hosts, riding the void.\n\nWith spirit directing qi, with qi refining spirit, lead and mercury merge, yin and yang rush forth in harmony. The Metal Mother radiates her splendor in the spirit-chamber, the silver essence emits its brilliance in the cinnabar chamber. The empty chamber generates whiteness, the spirit-abode attains great tranquility—thus the flying cinnabar clouds, the green carriages and jade wheels, the feathered canopies casting shade, the streaming essence and jade light, the five colors billowing in profusion, illuminating the vastness of the Great Void.\n\nFor seven days and seven nights, the sun, moon, and stars of all heavens, the jade pivot and jade balance, halt their wheels at once. The divine wind falls silent, mountains and seas conceal their clouds. The heavens are free of drifting veils; the four qi shine clearly. Throughout the land, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees stretch level as one, no longer distinguished by high or low.\n\nWhen speaking of \"all heavens,\" it refers to the thirty-two heavens. Within each heaven, there are sun and moon. Their essence and light, originally transformed, all take root in this realm. The \"jade pivot and jade balance\" are the seven stars of the Northern Dipper. The \"four qi shining clearly\" are the qi of heaven, earth, sun, and moon.\n\nFor the true transmit the true, the sages instruct the sages; thus the Three Luminaries cease their turning, mountains and seas gather qi, the Wind Earl dares not rustle the branches, the Cloud Marshal buries all shadows. Heaven and earth open in clarity, sun and moon shine purely, mountains and rivers lie level, all distinctions dissolved. Since it is said their wheels halt, how could there be night? Measured by ordinary time, this is the span of seven days and seven nights.\n\nThe Mystic Master says: This is the Great Stillness, where the divine light is profoundly serene, revealing the Jade Clarity Realm.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* states: *The Great Commentary on the Book of Changes* says: \"Hard and soft are the images of day and night.\" Some explain that day is yang-hard, night is yin-soft. Master Yichuan says: \"Hard and soft are the coming and going of one qi.\" In humans, the coming and going of qi is breath. One exhalation and one inhalation make a single breath; within each breath, yin and yang divide. Exhaling and brightening is yang and day; inhaling and darkening is yin and night. The seven orifices’ exhalation is the seven days; their inhalation is the seven nights. Through the Metal Mother’s merit and practice, the celestial mechanism does not move; spirit congeals, eyes fix, pulses cease, the heart stills—thus it is said that for seven days and seven nights, the sun, moon, and stars of all heavens, the jade pivot and jade balance, halt their wheels at once. The \"divine wind falling silent\" means breath does not enter or exit. The \"mountains and seas concealing their clouds\" means qi does not rise or fall. The \"heavens free of drifting veils\" means delusive thoughts and false conditions do not arise. The \"four qi shining clearly\" means movement and stillness, being and non-being are all transcended. To the point of forgetting form and cutting off thought, the myriad existences all empty, with no self and no other, profoundly embodying one’s nature—thus it is said that throughout the land, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees stretch level as one, no longer distinguished by high or low. The earth all turns to azure jade, without any other color. The former were celestial omens; these are terrestrial responses.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* states: \"Earth\" is the purity of nature. When nature is empty and transforms, it generates spirit; stored within the chamber, it is called \"wu-earth.\" When qi is stirred and moved to feeling, gathered within the cauldron, it is called \"ji-earth.\" When spirit is joyful and qi is still, nature returns to the darkness of feeling—like color’s azure without flaw, like jade’s purity without admixture—thus it is said the land all turns to azure jade, without any other color.\n\nThe assembled perfected ones attend the seat.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* states: When intention is undivided, it congeals in spirit. The Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s mysterious seat floats in emptiness above five-colored lions—this is the Dao-form of the Heavenly Worthy.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* states: The \"Primordial Heavenly Worthy\" is the primordial spirit. The \"mysterious seat\" is the spirit-chamber. \"Floating in emptiness\" is the Dharma-body. The \"five colors\" are the qi of wondrous transformation. The \"lions\" are the knowing heart. When the primordial spirit is in the chamber, directing the heart to gather qi, the Dharma-body is empty and still, the knowing heart is luminous and wondrous—spirit commands qi, the heart takes form as a lion. Is this not the Dao-form of the Heavenly Worthy?\n\nAfter expounding the scripture once, all the heavenly great sages simultaneously praise its excellence. At that time, the deaf and ailing men and women of the land all regain their hearing.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* states: \"Expounding the scripture once\" is Heaven One generating water, the qi of Kan nurtured within Qian-metal. The \"heavenly great sages simultaneously praising its excellence\" is the myriad spirits all rejoicing at once. The \"men and women of the land\" are the yin and yang qi of the Dharma-body. \"Deafness and ailment\" belong to Kan, which governs the ears. When human spirit and qi nourish each other, if spirit is dull, qi stagnates; if qi is chaotic, spirit is turbid—dim and obscure, like deafness. When practice flows smoothly, qi is still and spirit is clear, awakening what was unawakened—thus it is called \"regaining hearing.\" This is the initial step in entering the Dao. As for bodily illnesses, when one encounters scripture and method and is cured, it need not be explained.\n\nAfter expounding the scripture a second time, the blind regain their sight.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* states: \"Expounding the scripture a second time\" is Earth Two generating fire, the qi of Li nurtured within Xun-wood. Li governs the eyes, which correspond to the heart. When the heart is deluded by things, it darkens as if blind. Following the Dao, the heart opens and intention awakens—nothing can obscure it. Right and wrong become clear, like eyes seeing the path ahead.\n\nAfter expounding the scripture a third time, the mute can speak.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* states: \"Expounding the scripture a third time\" is Heaven Three generating wood, the qi of Zhen nurtured within Gen-water.\n\nGen corresponds to the mountain, where the peaks are high and the earth deep, and springs emerge from within. This is the doctrine of hemp and ashes. Speech is sound, which pertains to the nature of metal. Heaven Three generates wood, and after expounding the scripture a third time, why is it said that the mute can speak? This reveals the image of metal within wood. Wood is severed at *shen* and conceived at *you*; though metal overcomes wood, wood paradoxically lodges its embryo in the realm of metal. For metal generates water, and water generates wood—thus metal is the ancestor of wood. Heaven Three generates wood, and the third transmission of metal gives rise to wood, as in *jiazi* and *yichou* (Sea Middle Metal). Metal resides in the sea, and water generates *zi* and *chou*; water generates wood, which is *jia* and *yi*. Yang arises at *zi*, and the three yangs ascend from earth. Thus *Zhuangzi* states: \"Brilliant brilliance emerges from earth.\" Rising from below, the upper trigram *zhen* transforms into *dui*, illuminating the presence of metal within wood.\n\nAfter expounding the scripture a fourth time, those afflicted with lameness, chronic ailments, or hereditary infirmities can all rise and walk. \"Hereditary infirmities\" refer to illnesses passed down through generations. *The Inner Meaning* states: \"Expounding the scripture a fourth time\" is Earth Four generating metal, the qi of *dui* nurtured within *kun*-earth. \"Rising and walking\" describes the act of standing upright, which pertains to the nature of wood. Earth Four generates metal, and after expounding the scripture a fourth time, why is it said that those with lameness, chronic ailments, or hereditary infirmities can all rise and walk? This reveals the image of wood within metal. Metal is severed at *yin* and conceived at *mao*; metal is the ghost of wood, yet it lodges its embryo in the realm of wood. For wood generates fire, fire generates earth, and earth generates metal—thus wood is the origin of metal. Earth Four generates metal, and the fourth transmission of wood gives rise to metal, as in *jiawu* and *yiwei* (Sand Middle Metal). *Jia* and *yi* are wood, generating fire; *wu* and *wei* are fire, generating earth; sand and stone are earth, generating metal. Yin arises at *wu*, and the three yins descend from heaven. Thus *Zhuangzi* states: \"Solemn solemnity emerges from heaven.\" Descending from above, the trigram *dui* transforms into *zhen*, illuminating the presence of wood within metal. From this, the principle of alternation between metal and wood becomes evident. Yet the workings of creation are subtle and profound, far beyond what can be fully grasped through mere study on paper.\n\nAfter expounding the scripture a fifth time, long-standing chronic illnesses are restored to wholeness in an instant. *The Inner Meaning* states: \"Expounding the scripture a fifth time\" is Heaven Five generating earth, the qi of *li* lodging in *wu*, with earth-qi nurtured within *li*. All things arise from earth and return to earth, as above—this is the generative number of the Five Phases. Regarding \"long-standing chronic illnesses,\" the *Daoist Canon* states: \"Humans are the most spiritually endowed of beings. Their natural lifespan is over forty-three thousand two hundred days, and their spirit consists of thirty-six thousand primordial yang qi. Their original weight is three hundred eighty-four *zhu*, corresponding internally to *qian*. If one does not know how to preserve it and instead dissipates it, one will meet an untimely end midway. *Qian* embodies six yangs yet remains inactive and undispersed; those who understand this and cultivate it become immortals. From fifteen to twenty-five years of age, if one indulges in dissipation without cease, the primordial qi is depleted by forty-eight *zhu*, leaving a correspondence to *gou*. If desires grow more intense, and this continues for another decade, another forty-eight *zhu* is lost, leaving a correspondence to *dun*. If one still does not nurture it and adds another decade, another forty-eight *zhu* is lost, leaving a correspondence to *pi*. At this point, one reaches the midpoint of heaven and earth’s qi. If one still does not nurture it and adds another decade, seventy-two *zhu* are lost, leaving a correspondence to *guan*. If one still does not nurture it and adds another five years, ninety-six *zhu* are lost, leaving a correspondence to *bo*. If one still does not nurture it, by the sixty-four hexagrams, the primordial qi is exhausted, leaving a correspondence to *kun*. *Kun* is pure yin; one lives only by the grace of grain qi, hence the term 'borrowed lifespan.' At this stage, death is near, and one can no longer refine the elixir. Those who have severely damaged themselves may not even reach this point before perishing. The depletion of primordial qi—is this not what we call long-standing chronic illness? 'Restored to wholeness in an instant' means that through cultivating this Way, the true spirit grows daily stronger, the primordial qi flourishes, one returns to life and restores the root, attaining peace and longevity—this is the meaning.\n\nAfter expounding the scripture a sixth time, white hair turns black again, and fallen teeth regrow. *The Inner Meaning* states: \"Expounding the scripture a sixth time\" is Heaven One generating water, Earth Six completing it. Dwelling in the north, the accumulated yin of *kan* is the true qi of lead, where *qian* and *kan* unite to form water from metal. Lead is the mother of metal; lead is black and metal is white—this refers to white hair returning to its original root. \"Fallen teeth regrowing\" means that which was withered revives.\n\nAfter expounding the scripture a seventh time, the old regain their youth, and the young grow stronger. *The Inner Meaning* states: \"Expounding the scripture a seventh time\" is Earth Two generating fire, Heaven Seven completing it. Returning south to the palace of *li* is mercury, where *xun* and *li* unite to form fire from wood. Mercury is drawn from cinnabar. The south is fire, and mercury is also fire—the image of blazing flames without cease. The scripture states: \"When things reach their peak, they age—this is called 'not the Way.' What is not the Way perishes early.\" If one does not know the Way of return, fire blazes and smoke scatters, leaving nothing of the original state—how can one remain strong without aging? Once one grasps the principle of return, mastering the workings of cyclical reversal, returning to restore the root and reverting to the origin, the old become youthful and the young grow strong.\n\nAfter expounding the scripture an eighth time, pregnant women, birds, and beasts carrying young—whether already born or not yet born—all attain full development. *The Inner Meaning* states: \"Expounding the scripture an eighth time\" is Heaven Three generating wood, Earth Eight completing it. Returning east to the abode of *zhen* is cinnabar, where *gen* and *zhen* unite to form wood from water.\n\nCinnabar forms when mercury responds to lead-qi and congeals. Cinnabar contains the essence of mercury, resembling a womb carrying a fetus. Just as mercury solidifies upon encountering lead, qi blends with spirit and merges as one. This qi is not the postnatal yin-qi of the body but the wondrously transformed, life-generating primordial qi. Scholars must not fail to discern this. Once congealed, this qi grows ever more robust, while the arising spirit-qi repeatedly fuses and solidifies, no longer subject to material decay. It nurtures the sacred embryo, hence it is said that \"whether already born or not yet born, all attain full development.\"\n\nExpounding the scripture a ninth time, Earth’s treasury releases its store, and gold and jade reveal their forms. *The Inner Meaning* states: \"Expounding the scripture a ninth time\" is Earth Four generating metal, with Heaven Nine completing it. Returning west to the *dui* direction yields gold, where *kun* and *dui* unite to form metal from earth. For mercury returns to the earthen crucible and becomes treasure. *The Kinship of the Three* says: \"When metal comes to return to its nature, it is called the Reverted Elixir\"—this is what is meant by \"qi returning to the origin.\" The Heavenly One’s water first arises from the empty qi of the metal embryo before the metal’s substance appears. Earth Four generates metal, still a transformative mechanism; at this stage, it returns to the origin and restores its nature, residing in the Central Palace—this is the elixir’s body, bearing a mysterious image. The Central Palace is earth. Earth is the realm, and the Metal Mother dwells within it, hence it is said that \"Earth’s treasury releases its store, and gold and jade reveal their forms.\"\n\nExpounding the scripture a tenth time, withered bones revive, and all rise as complete beings. *The Inner Meaning* states: \"Expounding the scripture a tenth time\" is Heaven Five generating earth, with Earth Ten completing it. This is *li* separating from *ji* so that earth forms from fire, residing at the center as the root of all creation and the foundation of the elixir’s body. The *Daoist Scripture* says: \"The harmonious arises from the void.\" The harmony within qi is what enables the generation of the myriad things. Heaven Five’s earth is yang earth; Earth Ten’s earth is yin earth. When the two earths overlap, metal resides within them, hence the Reverted Elixir is called the \"knife-point.\" The marvel of the Reverted Elixir lies in reverting old age to youth and transcending the mundane to attain sagehood. The world’s people, bound to mortality, are but walking corpses in the eyes of those who behold them. Yet once this Way is attained and cultivated, one achieves longevity and does not become a ghost of the yellow springs—is this not \"withered bones reviving and all rising as complete beings\"? This is the completion of the Five Phases’ numbers.\n\nThe Han Celestial Master’s preface to *The Scripture of Divine Golden Fluid* states: \"The path of divine immortals, the subtlest of words, the supreme principle beyond principles, the great truth beyond what is so—all are fully contained in the profound tradition, not to be conveyed by even the slightest trace.\" The Most High likewise expounded this wondrous Way of emptiness and subtlety. At that time, every man and woman in the land turned their hearts toward it, all received protection and deliverance, and all attained longevity. Those who clearly grasped this Way achieved immortality and did not die. In that era, whether man or woman, old or young, all in the land received the sagely grace and were universally saved and delivered. The living did not die, and the dead revived.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* says: \"A land is like a single body; men and women are like yin and yang. Turning the heart is akin to mutual affinity. Protection and deliverance mean receiving nourishment. When yin and yang are in harmony, spirit and qi are nourished, the body is at peace, and the Way flourishes—this is the principle of longevity.\"\n\n*End of The Inner Meaning of the Supreme Mystery of the Infinite Salvation Scripture, Scroll One*\n*Beginning of The Inner Meaning of the Supreme Mystery of the Infinite Salvation Scripture, Scroll Two*\n\nDisciple Guanfu, Xiao Yingsou, studying the Dao, said: At that time, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounded the scripture once, and the boundless, innumerable hosts of perfected great spirits from the eastern realm of the Infinite arrived, floating through the void. He expounded the scripture a second time, and the boundless, innumerable hosts of perfected great spirits from the southern realm of the Infinite arrived, floating through the void. He expounded the scripture a third time, and the boundless, innumerable hosts of perfected great spirits from the western realm of the Infinite arrived, floating through the void. He expounded the scripture a fourth time, and the boundless, innumerable hosts of perfected great spirits from the northern realm of the Infinite arrived, floating through the void. He expounded the scripture a fifth time, and the boundless, innumerable hosts of perfected great spirits from the northeastern realm of the Infinite arrived, floating through the void. He expounded the scripture a sixth time, and the boundless, innumerable hosts of perfected great spirits from the southeastern realm of the Infinite arrived, floating through the void. He expounded the scripture a seventh time, and the boundless, innumerable hosts of perfected great spirits from the southwestern realm of the Infinite arrived, floating through the void. He expounded the scripture an eighth time, and the boundless, innumerable hosts of perfected great spirits from the northwestern realm of the Infinite arrived, floating through the void. He expounded the scripture a ninth time, and the boundless, innumerable hosts of perfected great spirits from the upper realm of the Infinite arrived, floating through the void. He expounded the scripture a tenth time, and the boundless, innumerable hosts of perfected great spirits from the lower realm of the Infinite arrived, floating through the void.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* says: In terms of the scripture, when the Celestial Worthy expounded the scripture ten times, the great spirits of the ten directions arrived—these were the Three Origins and Nine Sages, the Nine Perfected and Nine Immortals, the lofty perfected and exalted sages, the celestial spirits and earthly deities, all assembling in the Azure Beginning Heaven’s Floating Black Realm to listen to the Dharma.\n\nIn terms of the elixir, when the Primordial Beginning expounded the scripture, true lead became the ancestor of the medicine, and mysterious essence formed the foundation of the cinnabar. The ten recitations correspond to the numbers of heaven and earth’s generation. The ten directions correspond to the numbers of the Five Phases’ combinations. One, three, five, seven, nine—twenty-five in total—are the celestial numbers, the essence of yang. Two, four, six, eight, ten—thirty in total—are the terrestrial numbers, the splendor of yin. One, two, three, four, five correspond to the four cardinal directions and the upper direction; six, seven, eight, nine, ten correspond to the four corners and the lower direction. The generative numbers of yang are five, the root of the Five Phases. The consummate numbers of yin are ten, the root of the myriad transformations. One and nine, four and six, each combine to make ten—metal and water share the same origin. Two and eight, three and seven, each combine to make ten—wood and fire share the same body. In sum, fifty-five, distributed among the five directions. One and six reside in the north; two and seven in the south; three and eight in the east; four and nine in the west; five and ten in the center. Applying the method of division, the five directions subtract one, two, three, four, five—these are the origins of water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. Subtracting again, one, two, three, four, five—these are the roots of the Five Phases. After subtraction, each of the five directions retains five numbers, totaling twenty-five, the root of the Five Phases, the true yang body of the central earth. Further removing the root numbers of the five directions—one from the north, two from the south, three from the east, four from the west, five from the center—reveals four remaining numbers in the north, symbolizing metal. Metal fundamentally generates water, yet metal itself is born from water, as lead arises from the qi of silver, and silver is born within lead—this is the child producing the mother. Metal is the tiger. Metal within water is the tiger born within water. Three remaining numbers in the south symbolize wood. Wood fundamentally generates fire, yet wood itself arises from fire, as mercury responds to the qi of lead to form cinnabar, and cinnabar is born from mercury—this is the child producing the mother. Wood is the dragon, the dragon emerging from within fire. Two remaining numbers in the east symbolize fire. Fire is born from wood, mercury drawn from cinnabar—this is the sevenfold return of cinnabar to its origin. One remaining number in the west symbolizes water. Water is born from metal, the one qi returning to its origin—this is the ninefold return of golden liquid to the true. The center, emptiness, combines the four images to form ten, revealing the wondrous function of true yin earth.\n\nThus, Master Zhang Ziyang said:\n*The dragon of thunder mercury emerges from the land of fire,*\n*The tiger of marsh lead is born in the region of water.*\n*These two things arise from the child producing the mother,*\n*The Five Phases must all enter the center.*\n\nHe also said:\n*The red dragon and black tiger each dwell west and east,*\n*The four images interact within the central earth.*\n*From this reversal and union, transformation is set in motion—*\n*Who could say the golden elixir would not succeed?*\n\nThe Perfected of the Great One said: \"The art of inverting the Five Phases—\n*The dragon emerges from within fire,*\n*The Five Phases do not proceed in order,*\n*The tiger is born within water—*\nThis is the meaning.\"\n\nThe arrival of the boundless great spirits takes the hidden movements of the pure and true Qian and Kun as its model, dividing the three hundred eighty-four lines, circulating within the fire, revolving the five stars and twenty-eight constellations, arrayed within the crucible, condensing the three thousand six hundred primordial qi, traversing the seventy-two seasonal nodes, driving the sixty-four hexagrams’ yin tally, stirring the twenty-four qi’s yang fire. Subtle and detailed, revealed in the hidden language of the heart’s mirror. Thus, heaven and earth cannot conceal the mechanism of creation, yin and yang cannot hide the root of nurturance. Thereby, spiritual transformations are boundless, and pure generation is achieved, all gathered within grasp, merged within the empty and cavernous.\n\nSomeone asked Cheng Yi: \"The sage does not learn from the immortal; their arts differ. Could the sage perform such things?\" He replied: \"This is a thief within heaven and earth. If one does not steal the mechanism of creation, how could one prolong life?\" Thus, the *Scripture of Unconscious Unison* says: \"Humans are the thieves of the myriad things.\" To steal creation and plunder the myriad things is to make all within heaven and earth one’s own—taking without prohibition, using without exhaustion.\n\nWhen the ten recitations were complete, the boundless perfected great spirits of the ten directions arrived simultaneously. The men and women of the land turned their hearts in reverence, coming like fine rain and dense mist.\n\nThe innumerable multitude pressed upon the land, occupying half its breadth, and the earth sank unevenly—none could prevent it. When the Heavenly Venerable opened the realm, the ten thousand sages assembled, their majesty and virtue so weighty that the earth could not bear it, hence the uneven sinking. For extraordinary events, there are extraordinary responses. When Chan Master Farong of Niutou Mountain expounded the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra* and reached the \"Accomplishment of Stillness\" chapter, the earth trembled—how much more so when the August Emperor of Emptiness enacts transformation!\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: When the ten recitations were complete and the perfected great spirits of the ten directions arrived simultaneously, this was the settling of the spirit in quiescence, the return of qi to the chamber. When the men and women of the land turned their hearts in reverence, this was the blending and refinement of the yin and yang qi within the body. The gathering of spirit and qi exuded a dense, fragrant vapor. The *Cantong Qi* says: \"When gold and cinnabar enter the five viscera, their mist scatters like wind and rain.\" Gold is the purest essence of heaven and earth—it is spirit. Cinnabar is the pure quintessence of yin and yang—it is qi. Thus it is said: \"They came like fine rain and dense mist.\" The innumerable multitude, reaching the golden essence behind the elbow and the true qi beyond the Yang Pass, was the mutual stirring of nature and emotion, the silent operation of heaven’s mechanism, the mutual excitation of yin and yang, and the transformation of the true spirit. Though it is said that the body moves naturally, it still resides within the realm of effort, unable to avoid the alternations of restlessness overcoming cold and stillness overcoming heat. This is because, when held and filled, nature and emotion are not yet merged. Nature and emotion belong to earth, hence it is said that half the land was pressed upon, the earth sank unevenly, and none could prevent it.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning suspended a precious pearl, as large as a grain of millet, within the empty mystery, five measures above the earth. The pearl symbolizes the Dao; suspended in the empty mystery, it shares the meaning of the \"mysterious pearl.\" Within it, the transmission of scriptures reveals treasure within treasure, mystery within mystery, the true within the true, the Dao within the Dao. \"Five measures above the earth\" signifies that one departs from the Five Turbidities of the world and sheds the use of the Five Phases. When the Five Turbidities all emerge, afflictions naturally vanish; when the Five Phases are no longer used, mutual conquest ceases forever. Thus, when the Five Phases do not conquer one another, all things may be preserved, and one naturally attains long life and enduring vision, achieving the Dao and becoming a perfected being.\n\nThe Mysterious Master said: This is the precious pearl of Jade Purity, the Dao of the womb-transformation of divine immortals. The *Inner Meaning* states: The Primordial Beginning’s suspension of the pearl is the union of spirit and Dao. Previously, the lion upon which the scriptures were expounded was the spirit congealed within the chamber, proceeding from non-being to being. Now, this pearl suspended in the empty mystery transcends spirit and things, moving from being into non-being. The Heavenly Venerable, fearing that later students of the degenerate age would not grasp this principle and merely cling to dull emptiness, manifested wondrous transformations to clarify that within the utmost non-being, the utmost true and utmost pure abide. The scripture says: \"Vast and obscure, within it there is essence; its essence is most true, within it there is sincerity.\" In terms of principle, this is the return of spirit to the obscurity of nature, standing alone in perfect clarity, suddenly without obstruction, emptily without foundation. Radiant and joyful, dark and silent—it is not bound by the reckoning of the Five Phases nor sullied by the realm of the Five Turbidities. Master Chuan said: \"Forms and seeking are both delusion; formlessness and invisibility fall into barrenness. How could the resplendent and dense ever be separate? A single beam of cold light shines through the great void.\"\n\nThe Primordial Beginning ascended and led the great spirits of the perfected heavens, the lofty sages and venerable ones, the perfected of wondrous conduct, the perfected great spirits of the ten directions and the boundless realms—all the innumerable multitude—into the precious pearl. The heavenly beings gazed upward and saw them bustling as they entered the pearl’s mouth; once inside, their whereabouts were unknown. The Heavenly Venerable enacted wondrous and profound transformations, suspending the pearl within the empty mystery, its suspending thread unfathomable. He ascended and led the Three Origins and Nine Saints, the Nine Perfected and Nine Immortals, all into its midst. All the heavenly beings, not being the perfected of the heavens, the lofty sages, or the true persons, could not follow the transformative mechanism of non-action nor enter the wondrousness of the empty mystery; they could only gaze upward. They saw them bustling as they entered the pearl’s mouth; once inside, their whereabouts were unknown.\n\nMoreover, even lesser immortals of lower rank possess the wondrous ability to contain Mount Sumeru within a mustard seed and suspend heaven and earth within a gourd—how much more so the great sagely Heavenly Venerable, who unfolds and proclaims great transformations, manifesting divine marvels! The precious pearl, though said to be as large as a grain of millet, is already subtle and wondrous; to be five measures distant and still see the pearl within the empty mystery is beyond the capacity of heavenly beings, let alone perceiving its mouth. Furthermore, to witness the Heavenly Venerable leading the perfected sages into the realm of wondrous being and empty non-being—when the heavenly beings gazed upward as they followed the Heavenly Venerable into the pearl, they saw them enter its midst but could not perceive the wondrous transformations within.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: When the true spirit is already obscure, qi also follows into stillness, uniting with emptiness and merging with the non-being, ascending into the mysterious and entering the wondrous. This is called gathering the ten thousand beings into a single breath and dispersing a single breath into the ten thousand beings. In welcoming it, one does not see its beginning; in following it, one does not see its end. Its coming has no source; its going has no place. When the people of the land dispersed and moved, the earth returned to level stillness, no longer uneven or sunken.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: Movement and stillness both forgotten, being and non-being both relinquished. The Primordial Beginning then completed the recitation of the scriptures within the precious pearl. The *Inner Meaning* states: The Primordial Beginning is the spirit and the precious pearl—it is nature. \"Reciting the scriptures\" signifies illuminating the primordial qi as the body of the elixir. \"Completed\" means that spirit and nature are perfectly clear, utterly devoid of any thing. The assembled perfected monitored and transmitted it to me. The *Inner Meaning* states: The \"assembled perfected\" are the qi of wondrous transformation and arising. \"I\" is the Dao Lord.\n\nAt this time, joy and celebration were beyond words. The ritual matters were roughly concluded, and the various heavens returned to their positions. In an instant, all was silent, without lingering resonance.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: In the midst of practicing the work, wondrous responses are indescribable—like one who drinks water, knowing its warmth or coolness for oneself. When the work is complete, the myriad spirits return to their origin, and within the state of *huanghu*, luminosity is forgotten and reflection ceases.\n\nAt this time, when heavenly beings and humans encounter the scriptural Dharma, all universally receive deliverance, preserving their allotted years without harm or injury. The *Inner Meaning* states: Examining the past and mirroring the present, the principle is not distant. The scriptural Dharma and the Dao of the elixir share a single principle without distinction. The Sixth Patriarch said: \"My expounding of the Dharma is like the timely rain, universally moistening the earth. Your buddha-nature is like seeds—when they encounter this moisture, all sprout and grow.\" This is the principle of encountering the scriptural Dharma and universally receiving deliverance. The inner symbolic workings of the body embody this meaning.\n\nThose who attain it know its spirit and cherish it, understand its *qi* and treasure it. Thus, they may preserve their allotted years without harm or injury. \"Allotted years\" means avoiding untimely death. As for the single step beyond, one should advance further. The world turns in reverence, and all cultivate a heart of goodness: refraining from killing or harming, from envy or jealousy, from licentiousness or theft, from greed or desire, from hatred or resentment; speaking without embellishment, uttering no evil words; equalizing kindness and love, transforming even strangers into kin.\n\nThe *Severing Destiny* states: Harming through killing or injury is called \"harm\"; resenting others for surpassing oneself is called \"envy\"; hating one’s peers is called \"jealousy\"; male and female engaging improperly is called \"licentiousness\"; stealing others’ possessions is called \"theft\"; insatiability is called \"greed\"; indulgence in cravings is called \"desire\"; disliking others is called \"hatred\"; suspicion is called \"resentment.\" When the ten evils are extinguished, even strangers become kin, and when the myriad practices are mystically aligned, voices carry no strife.\n\nThe section on licentiousness refers to improper conduct between men and women, for the purpose of rectifying human relationships. For those cultivating the Way, it must be entirely abandoned. Thus, the *Supreme Mystery Numinous Writ* places licentious desire at the head of the ten defeats. Formerly, the Purple Void Primordial Lady and Lord Mao examined the gains and losses of perfected immortals under heaven—forty-seven fell in rank, while only two ascended. This was because they harbored desires for licentiousness while practicing the Way of the Supreme Perfected. Not only did they fall, but they were also subject to judgment by the Three Officials. Those seeking long life—how could they not sever such thoughts?\n\nThe section on theft does not only mean stealing others’ possessions; any acquisition not obtained by proper means is theft. The section on desire does not only mean indulgence in cravings; it refers to selfishness. The Most High said: \"No sin is greater than what desire makes permissible; no fault is greater than covetousness.\" When the heart of desire stirs, the self arises, and from this, all the aforementioned evils follow, leading to the corruption of state governance and the loss of peace among the multitudes. Can the heart that seeks profit not be guarded against?\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The human heart is inherently good, without anything inherently evil. Yet, it is obscured by material desires, dimming its original nature. Upon hearing the essentials of the Dao, all evils melt like ice, and self and others become one, with no barrier between close and distant. The matters described above are elaborated in detail in the *Treatise on Responses and Retributions*—they are the daily missteps of worldly people. The Shu scholar Li Changling’s explanation of karmic causes and conditions spans over a hundred thousand words; reading it sends a chill down the spine, so that not even the slightest selfish thought dares arise in the mind. It is of great benefit to the teachings of the world.\n\nCarefully observing the scriptural intent, the phrase \"all cultivate a heart of goodness, refraining from killing or harming, and so on\" means the complete absence of evil thoughts. If even the faintest evil thought lingers in the heart, it cannot be called good. Why? Can jade with the slightest flaw still be called fine jade? Good and evil do not wait to manifest in action; the moment a thought arises, the divine records it.\n\nFormerly, Wei Zhongda, a court academician, was summoned to the netherworld. The nether official ordered the clerks to present his records of good and evil. When they arrived, the evil record filled the courtyard, while the good record was as thin as a chopstick. The nether official changed countenance and ordered a scale to weigh them. The small scroll of good deeds outweighed the evil record, shaking the earth. The official then joyfully said: \"You may depart.\" Wei said: \"I am not yet forty—how could I have committed so many evils?\" The official replied: \"Not so. Any improper thought is recorded; it does not wait for a transgression.\" Wei asked: \"Then what is recorded on the small scroll?\" The official said: \"The court once undertook a great construction project to repair the stone bridge of Three Mountains. You submitted a memorial to admonish and stop it—this is the draft of that memorial.\" Wei said: \"Though I submitted it, the court did not heed it. What benefit did it bring, that it could have such power?\" The official said: \"Though the court did not heed it, the thought in your heart was already sufficient. Had they listened, your merit would have been far greater. You would have immediately attained liberation from the world—how could you have been summoned here? Alas, your evil thoughts were too numerous, reducing your merit by half. You can no longer hope for a high position.\"\n\nAlas! Even empty thoughts diminish fortune—how much more so for actual transgressions. The retributions of good and evil are too numerous to record entirely, but observing Fan Wenzheng’s account of Dou the Remonstrator’s *Record of Hidden Virtues* suffices to know that goodness is attainable.\n\nSome may ask: \"Though I treat others with goodness, if they repay me with evil, how can I remain at peace?\" Not so. If one knows the words of the Red Lord of Southern Marchmount, the *qi* will naturally be at peace. The Red Lord of Southern Marchmount said: \"If others bring misfortune upon me, but I respond with fortune, then the *qi* of fortune and virtue will always arise within me, while the *qi* of harm and calamity will naturally befall them.\" This is the great practice of those who study the Dao. Could the Red Lord of Southern Marchmount deceive others?\n\nWhen the state is secure and the people prosper, all rejoice in great peace—this is the result of universally cultivating a heart of goodness.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: According to what the Most High Lord Lao conferred upon the Perfected Gan Ji as the Way of Great Peace, its essential teaching is this: when a person is born, Heaven bestows spirit upon them, Earth bestows essence, and the harmonious center bestows *qi*. If one can preserve essence, cherish spirit, and safeguard *qi*, then inwardly one preserves the body and attains long life, while outwardly one brings the state to great peace.\n\nIt further states: The conduct of a minister should be to love their ruler above all, desiring their long life. As a child, one should think of their parents, fearing their mortality, and transform their intentions through moral influence, guiding them into the Dao, constantly seeking rare formulas and extraordinary arts to offer to ruler and kin. As a disciple, one should remember the kindness of their teacher. A person is born of their parents, their virtue and power are perfected by their teacher, and they attain honor through their ruler. Ever mindful of ruler, father, and teacher—when they grow old and can no longer repay them—one may study further, seek wise counsel, and obtain rare formulas and wondrous methods to benefit them. Such is the most excellent loyal minister, filial child, and obedient disciple of the High Antiquity and August Sovereign. If all people act thus, the world will be at great peace.\n\nWhat is within must manifest without: thus, virtuous conduct becomes visible as good fortune, and the clarity of the spirit-nature is called wisdom. Cultivating both fortune and wisdom, inwardly and outwardly, one achieves mutual fulfillment. The state is like the body, the people like *qi*; the state has its ruler, the body its heart. When the ruler governs well, the people are at peace; when the heart is upright, *qi* is harmonious.\n\nThe *Classic* says: \"If I practice non-action, the people transform themselves; if I love stillness, the people rectify themselves; if I am without affairs, the people enrich themselves; if I am without desire, the people become simple.\" Governing the state and cultivating the heart share the same principle.\n\nWhen the *Classic* first emerged to instruct a single state, those who approached it with utmost sincerity, revered its teachings, honored its rituals, and respected its virtue all attained deliverance from the world.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: When the *Classic* is revealed and teachings are established, people follow the Dao in practice. The word \"approach\" (*yu*) means \"beforehand\" or \"in advance.\" People are born endowed with the *qi* of the Dao—how could their hearts be without it? Yet, deluded by illusory attachments, they sink into confusion and darkness. Upon encountering the *Classic* and its teachings, this heart regains clarity, like pointing out the cinnabar elixir—it is each person’s original possession, not something that was absent before and now exists. Though obtained after hearing the *Classic* and the Dao, it was already present before such hearing. Hence, it is said: \"approaching with utmost sincerity.\"\n\n\"Revering\" (*zong*) means taking the Dao as one’s ancestor. \"Upholding\" (*feng*) means exalting its texts. \"Ritual\" (*li*) means honoring its methods. \"Respect\" (*jing*) means venerating its virtue.\n\nThus, the *Sutra of Origins* states: Those who practice the Dao should know the methods of the Way, virtue, *Classic*, and conduct. The Way is the path; virtue and power are good works; the *Classic* is the direct path; conduct is the steps taken; method is completion. The Way and *Classic* can be cultivated to attain the Dao—there is a completed path to follow.\n\nIf people act accordingly, all will attain deliverance from the world.\n\nThe Dao says: What the Most High Heavenly Worthy expounds in the *Classic* consists entirely of the hidden rhymes of the inner names of the Celestial Emperors—these are the inner sounds of the Jade Characters of the Heavenly Emperor. They are also the inner taboo names of demon kings and the hidden names of the hundred spirits, not ordinary words of the world.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The so-called inner names of the Celestial Emperors, hidden rhymes, inner taboo names of demon kings, and hidden names of the hundred spirits are like what the *Elixir Classic* describes: solar soul and lunar spirit, Metal Tiger and Wood Dragon, mercury and cinnabar, red lead and black tin, yellow sprout and white snow, the maiden and the infant, the yellow woman and the golden lord, the furnace and the cauldron. Though their names and designations differ, all are the primordial unity of *qi*, not separate yin or miscellaneous things.\n\nThe highest sages who have attained perfection as Perfected Ones penetrate the profound and fathom the subtle.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The highest sages who cultivate the wondrous Dao have already achieved success. The Perfected Ones thoroughly understand the profound principles and comprehend the mysteries. Their practice is substantive, not clinging to empty texts. For example, the *Red Writ of Chaos*, the Three Luminaries revealed by the Primordial Ancestor at the dawn of kalpas, and the great circulation of Brahman *qi*—they know their depths and grasp their essential mechanisms. Thus, the wonders of Heaven and Earth’s creation, the principles of life and death, being and non-being, all lie before their eyes, not far from the body.\n\nIf one can master its chapters and recite them ten times,\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: Having penetrated the profound and fathomed the subtle, one can know the Dao. The effect of ten recitations equals the merit of the Primordial Ancestor. In terms of the elixir, ten recitations correspond to ten months in the chamber in practice, and nine revolutions in principle.\n\nThe myriad heavens sing from afar, praising their merit. The ten thousand emperors prepare rites.\n\nRevere this scripture. When rivers and seas lie in silent stillness, even as the Duke of Zhou governed the realm, the seas did not stir their waves. When the Perfected recite the scripture, the Yellow River runs clear and the seas remain serene. Though the affairs differ, the principle is one; though the merits vary, their virtue is the same.\n\nMountains and peaks store clouds. They gather clouds to bring forth rain, nourishing the myriad beings. Sun and moon halt their radiance; the celestial pivot ceases its turning. The effect of ten recitations equals the merit of the Primordial Ancestor—this is what is meant.\n\nAll demons bind their forms; ghostly spirits perish in clarity. The scripture speaks of binding: dispatching demonic spirits and beheading the six ghostly blades. Reviving the dead from corpses, transforming white bones into living beings—such was Lord Lao’s restoration of Xu Jia’s withered bones.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: When the myriad heavens sing from afar and the ten thousand emperors prepare rites, this is what *Zhuangzi* calls “tranquil and boundless, with all beauties following in its wake”—the virtue of Heaven and Earth, the Dao of the sage. The “silent stillness of rivers and seas” refers to the River of Love and the Sea of Suffering, both born of the illusory delusions of the human heart. Love arises from emotion; suffering stems from perception. Once one’s virtue harmonizes with Heaven and Earth and one’s Dao aligns with the sagely Perfected, the River of Love falls silent and the Sea of Suffering lies profoundly still.\n\n“Mountains and peaks store clouds” refers to what the *Huangting Jing* calls “the cloud-*qi* of the Five Peaks”—here, the expansive *qi* of the five viscera. The Perfected, whose breath is deep and serene, fill their five viscera with *qi*, like mountains gathering clouds.\n\n“Sun and moon” are the two eyes; “radiance” is their light, which is spirit. When the Perfected’s spirit does not stray outward, their eyes, though observing things, remain unmoving—hence “halting their radiance.” The “celestial pivot” is the Dipper’s handle. The human heart, mirroring this axis, turns yet does not shift; though it observes and examines, it seems motionless. The Perfected, following nature, respond to things while remaining profoundly still—hence “ceases its turning.”\n\n“All demons” are the myriad distractions that confuse and disturb the heart. When one follows nature, responding as if to nothing, this is called “binding their forms.” “Ghostly spirits” are the Three Corpses. If the Three Corpses do not depart, the Dao cannot be achieved. By embodying purity, the Three Corpses naturally perish—hence “perishing in clarity.”\n\n“Reviving the dead from corpses, transforming white bones into living beings”: Those who attain the elixir not only perfect themselves but must extend their merit to others. As the *Pure Brightness* method states: “Once my elixir is complete, transformation is effortless. What remains lacking is the Celestial Mandate; thus, one accumulates merit to await the true decree.” For all beings of good conduct, one may prolong their years and increase their lifespan. If misfortune strikes and they fall ill or die, one revives them—such was the case when the Perfected Lord Wu raised Yu Qing from the dead.\n\nThe most devoted scholars—those whose hearts are firm as iron and stone, whose conduct stands unshaken by water or fire, whom neither Heaven and Earth can surpass nor ghosts and spirits delude, who walk paths others cannot tread—are those whose true names reside above the Great Ultimate. Yet even more advanced are those who do not wait for thoughts to arise or affairs to arrive before practicing, but instead cultivate diligently in the spaces between thought and no-thought, action and inaction. Such Perfected are of a slightly lesser rank.\n\nAfter ten recitations, the Five Emperors stand guard, and the Three Realms bow in reverence. This scripture is formed of wondrous *qi*, coalescing into numinous text—the ancestral origin of the ten thousand *qi*. Wherever the *qi* of the Five Phases resides, the spirits of the Five *Qi* follow, known as the Emperors. Thus, “the Five Emperors stand guard.” When Ji Kangzi asked Confucius about the Five Emperors, Confucius replied: “They assist the Supreme Emperor, governing as the Five Emperors.”\n\nThe “Three Realms” are the great demons of the Three Realms. When the most devoted scholars accumulate merit through steadfast practice, the demon kings of the Three Realms protect and revere them—hence “the Three Realms bow in reverence.” Demonic spirits lose their sight; ghostly beings perish in clarity. Once the great demons offer protection and reverence, how dare ghosts and spirits meet their gaze? This is the principle of binding forms and extinguishing clarity.\n\nSaving those on the verge of death, restoring life where it has been severed.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The Five Emperors are the spirits of the five viscera—liver-soul, lung-po, heart-spirit, kidney-essence, and spleen-intent. When one is tranquil, the spirit is settled, the soul clear, the intent at peace, the po composed, and essence unlost. But when one is restless and competitive, the spirit tires, the soul grows turbid, the intent scatters, the po disperses, and essence dissipates in ruin.\n\nThough all desire peace and longevity, daily affairs weary the spirit, allowing the Three Corpses and Nine Worms to become thieves within. Thus, the true *qi* of the Crimson Palace is disturbed. For those who cultivate the elixir, the corpse-worms vanish entirely.\n\nThe spirits of the five viscera each fulfill their duties, thus they are called \"attendants and guardians.\" The Three Realms are the Three Corpses—these are the turbid, murky, and perverse *qi* of the three divisions of the human body, belonging to the realms of the three malefactors. The Upper Corpse, Peng Ju, dwells in the head; the Middle Corpse, Peng Zhi, dwells in the intestines; the Lower Corpse, Peng Qiao, dwells in the feet. All human cravings, lusts, and myriad unwholesome deeds are instigated by these corpse-demons. On the day of *gengshen*, they ascend to the Heavenly Bureau to report one’s transgressions, omitting not even the slightest fault. They delight in hastening a person’s death. Thus, Ge Zhichuan said: \"Can you sever the enmity of the Three Peng?\" The Three Peng are the Three Corpses. Methods to eradicate them are numerous, fully recorded in the *Daoist Canon* under the *Gengshen* section. Yet none compare to the marvel of the Golden Elixir. An ancient poem states: \"Of all the boundless methods in the world, only the elixir can slay the Three Corpses.\" Master Zhang the Perfected said: \"Since ancient times, the *geng* and *jia* days enforce the decree; slay the Three Corpses, and the Dao may be attained.\" This is the transformation of evil into benevolence, the subjugation of the stubborn to goodness. Thus, they are made to bow in submission. As for demonic essences and spectral apparitions—these belong to the Nine Worms and Six Thieves. The Three Corpses are their ringleaders; the worms and thieves, their followers. Destroy the ringleaders, and the followers scatter of themselves. Hence, it is said: \"their eyes are extinguished, their clarity lost.\"\n\nThus, one may prolong the years of those on the verge of death and restore life where it has been severed. The spirit and *qi* grow robust and flourishing. Scholars, exert yourselves in this practice—its merit is self-evident.\n\nThe reason for this is that when a scholar’s impure *qi* has not yet dissipated and their body has not attained true transparency, their summons may command the ten directions, yet their authority does not govern the celestial administration. Their virtue may subdue earthly spirits and bind demonic spirits, but this only averts death—it does not restore life. The *Inner Meaning* states: If a scholar’s desires remain unsevered and their nature and principle are not yet illuminated, though they diligently explore and refine, they will not penetrate the mysteries of the void. They may only preserve the spirit, husband the *qi*, subdue yin demons, prolong their years, and ward off illness. The Way of long life remains beyond their hope.\n\nTo recite this chapter lightly brings misfortune upon oneself. This refers to failing to rectify one’s form and attire, neglecting the rituals and protocols, reciting casually whether standing, sitting, lying, or walking. If one recites without reverence, it would be better not to recite at all. The *Inner Meaning* states: \"To recite this chapter lightly\" means to treat the Dao with frivolity. The essence of the Golden Elixir lies wholly in harmonious regulation. First, one must act in gathering and refining; next, one must be vigilant in maintaining fullness, awaiting the completion of the crucible and the readiness of the medicinal ingredients. Then, one advances the talismanic fire, regulates the withdrawal and addition of mercury and lead, aligning the hours and seasons without error. Thus, the *qi* of yin and yang becomes abundant, the pearl of *Li* and *Kan* is perfected, the spirit transforms into the true, and one attains long life and enduring vision.\n\nIf, however, one is hasty in emotion and negligent in heart, acting recklessly and carelessly, the celestial cycles fall out of alignment, the talismanic nodes fail to correspond—then scorching heat arises in midwinter, bitter frost in midsummer, the Maiden of Cinnabar flees, the Crimson Dragon bolts. The spirit and essence are lost, the golden liquid is unattainable, the *qi* is exhausted, the body emaciated, the form declines, and life perishes.\n\nThrough reverent offering and solemn ritual, the household flourishes. Generation after generation prospers, bound to good causes. Myriad calamities do not encroach; divine luminaries guard the gate. The *Inner Meaning* states: If one cultivates with earnest reverence, externally, the household thrives; internally, body and mind find peace. Daily, one’s virtue is renewed, and every action meets with good fortune. Disasters do not intrude; divine luminaries provide protection.\n\nThis scripture is exalted and wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital. It delivers countless beings and serves as the origin of the myriad Daoist ways. Its majestic model is of virtue beyond measure. The *Inner Meaning* states: The *Seven Bamboo Slips of the Scriptural Teachings* states: \"The Three Caverns are the wondrous essence of the One Vehicle, the profound words of the Three Realms. Those who comprehend them may ascend as supreme sages; those who awaken to them may rise as lofty perfected ones. Dragon scripts and phoenix seals reveal the finest explications of the supreme principle; jade tablets and golden books guide the essential techniques for returning to the source.\" Thus, this scripture is called \"exalted and wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital,\" for it is the crown of the Three Caverns. From ancient times to the present, no immortal, perfected one, or supreme sage has not relied upon it for cultivation and realization. Records and registers abound—none can count their number. The myriad methods and thousand gates all emerge from this. Vast and boundless, it transcends naming, thought, and discussion.\n\nThe Dao states: Whoever recites this scripture ten times will have all the heavens arrive, and the suffering souls of billions of ancestors will immediately receive deliverance, ascending to the Vermilion Palace. There is no distinction of high or low in recitation. Those who, in accordance with the method, recite with a concentrated mind ten times will have all the heavens arrive, and the host of sages descend and gather in their ancestral temple. They will rescue the suffering souls of their ancestors and the afflicted spirits of their clan, lifting them from the Northern Mansion and ushering them into the Southern Palace. After nine years of refinement, they will be transformed and reborn, becoming noble persons. Those who love learning, fulfill the scripture’s merit, and perfect their virtue will all attain divine transcendence, ascending to the Golden Gates and roaming the Jade Capital.\n\nThe \"nine years\" refers to the nine-year refinement, following the number of the Three Fires—three times three makes nine. The Vermilion Palace belongs to the south, which pertains to fire. Refining the form with fire is thus called the Three Fires. After nine years of refinement and transformation, one is then reborn into nobility. Upon birth, one immediately cultivates this scripture. The former practice remains, and when the merit of ten thousand recitations is complete and the virtue of three thousand is restored, one transcends and ascends, directly attaining divine transcendence. They ascend to the Golden Gates to serve the Sage Lord and roam the Jade Capital to pay homage to the Primordial Beginning.\n\nAccording to the *Three Primal Commandments*, the standards for deliverance in the Vermilion Numinosity include three grades: great fortune requires three years, medium fortune nine years, and lesser fortune twenty-four years. The nine years here correspond to the medium fortune standard. The *Inner Meaning* states: \"Ten times\" refers to the principle of the lunar month. \"All the heavens arrive\" means the myriad spirits merge into the primordial unity.\n\nThe billions of ancestors and forebears are but transient unions of father and mother; the suffering souls and hidden spirits, once they possess form, are all shrouded in the murky qi of ignorance—yet all may receive deliverance. Those who ascend to the Vermilion Palace undergo the refinement of this transient, murky qi, transcending into the radiant domain of luminous clarity. The standard for all is nine years of transformation and rebirth. To become a noble being means that the refining of the transient, murky qi wholly transforms it into yang spirit, rebirthing true qi, where the myriad spirits become one spirit and the myriad qi become one qi—this is the nurturing of the sacred embryo. Scholars who attain this station have already achieved the fullness of spirit and the sufficiency of qi, prolonging life and extending years; yet this is not yet what may be called immortality. Thus it is said: those who diligently study the scriptures, whose merit is complete and virtue perfected, all attain divine transcendence. Yet further cultivation is still required, for inner attainment must be realized and virtuous conduct fulfilled before one may aspire to such a state.\n\nInner attainment refers to the Dao of fire phases, embryo liberation, and spirit transformation—methods of practice that will be detailed later. Virtuous conduct lies in aiding others and benefiting the world, as exemplified by the Han Celestial Master discerning between humans and ghosts, Master Ge universally delivering suffering souls, and Perfected Lord Xu slaying dragons and serpents. The scripture states: though a scholar may uphold the Dao, without performing meritorious deeds, they cannot attain it. In ancient times, when the Han Celestial Master’s elixir was complete but not yet ingested, he said to Perfected Lord Wang: \"The divine elixir is accomplished; if I consume it, I shall surely ascend to heaven and become a perfected one. Yet I have not yet performed great virtue. I must first serve the nation and the people, eliminating harm and promoting benefit, before I may ingest the elixir and lightly ascend. Only then will I have served the Three Realms without shame.\" Only thus may one ascend to the Golden Gates and roam the Jade Capital.\n\nScholars of the highest order who study and recite this scripture all receive deliverance and ascend to the Southern Palace. Those of the highest learning, upon hearing the Dao, practice diligently, study the teachings without fail, and persevere through cold and heat—these are the immortals recorded below the Nine Palaces of Great Clarity. Having recited this scripture, they attain the Dao in body and ascend to the immortal realm, undergoing refinement in the Southern Palace of Vermilion Numinosity. When the hun and po ascend as immortals, the ghostly substance is tempered by fire; when the living vessel attains the Dao, the filth and defilement are purged by fire—thus all enter the Southern Palace before ascending to their true original station.\n\nThose in the world who recite this scripture extend their years and prolong their lives, later attaining the Dao of corpse liberation. Their souls temporarily dissolve, sparing them the underworld, and they swiftly regain form, roaming the vast heavens. Ordinary people—those not set apart from the multitude—though their ancestral blessings are shallow and their personal merit slight, may still enjoy long life in their years. Upon death, their forms dissolve temporarily. Unbound by the regulations of the Three Offices or the trials of the Nine Bureaus, after a set number of ascents, their spirits return and their forms are restored. Having transformed their appearance in the halls of the Three Palaces and renewed their youthful countenance in the chambers of the Nine Refinements, they do not enter the upper palaces of the South but instead traverse the celestial realms.\n\nCorpse liberation takes four forms:\nFirst, liberation by violence, as when Ji Kang met execution in the marketplace or the Prince of Huainan entrusted his form to prison.\nSecond, liberation by writing, as when Ci Qing exchanged his essence for sandals or Lord Changfang assumed the guise of bamboo.\nThird, liberation through water or fire, as when Feng Yi drowned in the great river or Feng Zi was consumed by the fire tree.\nFourth, liberation through the Great Yin’s refinement, where the body appears dead—feet uncyanosed, skin unwrinkled, eyes undimmed—yet remains pliable to others, also a form of corpse liberation. The flesh remains uncorrupted for a hundred years before reviving as a complete person.\n\nThe *True Records* states: corpse-liberation immortals may not ride the floral canopy, mount flying dragons, ascend the Great Ultimate, or roam the Nine Palaces—they merely avoid death. The *Inner Meaning* says: though the methods of practice differ, their success is the same. The Dao of the golden elixir is rare to encounter yet easy to accomplish. If one’s past life aligns with the truth and they obtain it, they must strive to practice, surely aligning with the scripture’s intent without doubt. This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering boundless beings. All heavenly and mortal beings receive its blessings, and immeasurable fortune extends to the living and the dead.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: this scripture is profound and recondite, the Dao’s most mysterious essence, broadly aiding sentient beings and universally delivering the innumerable. When the scripture’s merit is complete and the elixir’s Dao perfected, the departed receive liberation’s grace, and the living are endowed with life’s blessings. Treasured by heaven, it is not transmitted to the lower world. Only the most devoted scholars, offering gold and treasure with sincere hearts, may swear oaths to heaven and receive it. To lightly divulge or disdain it brings calamity upon nine generations, condemning them to eternal servitude as ghostly officials.\n\nSuch servitude entails the dead soul’s banishment to the ranks of:\n- Heavenly servitors, who drive thunder and wield lightning;\n- Earthly servitors, who bear sand and carry stones;\n- Watery servitors, who lash the waves of the boundless deep.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* says: the Three Caverns’ true scriptures are recorded in the golden registers, hidden in the Mystic Capital, revealed but once in ten thousand kalpas. Transmission requires oaths, as the scriptures themselves decree. In a past kalpa, when the world’s fortunes were dire and its destiny obstructed, the Tortoise Mother of the Western Terrace petitioned the Jade Capital, and thus it was bestowed to deliver the people. The Jade Dawn Dao Lord transmitted it to Perfected Lord Xuan Yi, who passed it to Perfected Lord Xu of the Great Ultimate, who then entrusted it to Master Ge, spreading it through the world. The method encompasses both inner and outer aspects, both matters preserved.\n\nRegarding the elixir, prohibitions are especially strict. One must swear solemn vows, daring not to leak its secrets. The inner symbolism’s mechanisms have already been disclosed; one must invoke heaven in practice, broadly aiding and uplifting others. Those who receive this must never treat it lightly. Divine might protects and guards, while numinous officials oversee and observe. To violate this oath brings personal calamity and implicates nine generations, with inescapable punishment in the netherworld.\n\nThe Five Emperors who attend the scripture, along with their attendants, have already been explained. Twenty-four Jade Lads and twenty-four Jade Maidens, totaling forty-eight, safeguard the sacred text and protect the scripture’s recipients. The maidens, in particular, constantly guard the divine scripture and also protect those who recite it.\n\nOne must recommend and elevate those of utmost sincerity, for overseers monitor carelessness and leaks—those who receive and recite this scripture must be ever vigilant. When going out or traveling, one must carry it at all times, allowing the text to shield the body, avert misfortune, and dispel all concerns.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The scripture is the ancestral qi. The Five Emperors are the wondrous transformations of the five phases’ qi. The twenty-four Jade Lads and twenty-four Jade Maidens are the true spirits of the inner and outer luminous visions, the true qi. To nurture and safeguard the primordial spirit is called \"safeguarding the divine scripture and protecting its recipients.\"\n\nThe Dao teaches: In the first month, observe a prolonged fast and chant this scripture to sever the earthly corvée labor of past generations’ souls and deliver them to the Southern Palace. The first month is the great celebration of the Upper Prime, and thus its blessings extend to ancestors and forebears, freeing suffering spirits from the toils of ghostly servitude and granting them the felicity of transcendence by the offices of the immortals. Fasting means the body is free of杂务, the mind does not wander externally, inner and outer are pure and empty, and one embraces the origin and guards the One throughout the month—hence it is called a prolonged fast. The Southern Palace has already been explained earlier.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The first month is *yin*.\n\nRefining the elixir and gathering the medicine take *yin* and *shen* as the phases of ascent and descent. *Yin* marks the rise of yang; to practice the work at *shen*-hour, one must first guard at *yin*-hour, then apply it at *shen*-hour. A prolonged fast is the purification of the heart. Reciting the scripture is the gathering of *qi*—this is called gathering the medicine. The souls of past generations are *yin*-*qi*. Though yang-*qi* is said to arise at *zi*-hour, a single yang still lies beneath five *yin*. By *yin*-hour, *yin* and yang are evenly matched, *yin* above and yang below, pent up and not yet free—hence it is called ghostly servitude. When at *shen*-hour the method is applied to steam and refine, yang-*qi* surges upward and ascends into the *Li* Palace—can this not be called severing earthly servitude and delivering them to the Southern Palace?\n\nIn the seventh month, observe a prolonged fast and chant this scripture to attain immortality, have one’s name inscribed in the registers of the heavens, recorded on the Yellow Register and White Tablet, and have death erased and life bestowed. The seventh month is the great celebration of the Middle Prime. It extends to one’s own person: the heavens inscribe one’s name for ascension on the White Tablet, while Fengdu strikes one’s name from the Black Book of the dead. One attains immortality and ascends to the Heavenly Court. The Yellow Register and White Tablet are written in gold on tablets of white jade. All methods of Daoist cultivation universally deliver the nine orifices and bridge the realms of life and death.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The seventh month is *shen*, the phase of yang’s retreat. To practice the work at *yin*-hour, one must first guard at *shen*-hour. By *yin*-hour, mercury is circulated and lead is infused, entering the crucible to form the treasure—this is also called gathering the medicine or casting the crucible. Thus yang-*qi* grows daily stronger while *yin*-*qi* daily wanes. What was purely *yin* becomes a ghost; what is purely yang becomes an immortal. As yang-*qi* strengthens, the gradual refinement of immortality begins. When merit is complete and *qi* is full, the spirit transforms and one attains long life—hence it is said one attains immortality. All who achieve the Dao have their names stricken from Fengdu and transferred to the registers of immortals, receiving charts and records to ascend—thus it is said their names are inscribed in the heavens on the Yellow Register and White Tablet, and death is erased while life is bestowed.\n\nIn the tenth month, observe a prolonged fast and chant this scripture for the sake of the king, the lord, ruler and ministers, father and son, to secure the nation’s destiny, preserve the heavens’ enduring existence, and ensure the lineage continues unbroken. Always be a sovereign, secure in one’s domain, with the people proclaiming great peace. *Yin* in the first month is the ghostly path, hence it delivers the departed; *shen* in the seventh month is the human gate, hence it delivers oneself; *hai* in the tenth month is the heavenly gate, hence it secures the nation’s destiny for the emperor and ensures everlasting peace.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: When the medicine is fully gathered and the crucible is perfectly cast, enter the chamber in the tenth month to harmonize spirit and *qi*. Beginning fifteen days before the winter solstice, carefully guard the spirit between the kidneys—this is called fortifying the numinous root, causing the root’s original primordial spirit and *qi* to arise together. The nation is the body. The spirit is the body’s lord; *qi* is the spirit’s minister. When spirit is full and *qi* is abundant, the hundred bones are all ordered. The elixir is completed, the form is shed, and one attains long life and enduring vision. Bone and flesh ascend together, form and spirit are both wondrous—just as the scripture describes.\n\nOn the eight nodal days, chant this scripture to become a Perfected One of the Nine Palaces. On the eight nodal days, the Primordial Beginning dispatches Heavenly Worthies, Heavenly Lords, Heavenly Emperors, and immortals with their hosts to instruct and transform the world, delivering all beings. The Northern Dipper, Southern Asterism, Four Directors, and Five Emperors also descend to record merits and transgressions. All beings that partake of *qi*—on these days, each undergoes transformation: flying, crawling, plants, trees, creatures of the air and water—all respond to conditions, changing the old and renewing themselves. Light may become heavy, heavy may become light. Good and evil reverse, the movement of *qi* and images occurs naturally. Those who study the higher teachings should on these days meditate and offer prayers, adapting to change, cultivating good and eliminating evil, advancing brightness and abandoning darkness, entering rectitude and expelling perversity, refining the false into the true, striving to ascend to perfection, delivering all beings, and nurturing the myriad things.\n\nThe eight nodes correspond to the eight trigrams and nine palaces. Thus, chanting the scripture on the eight nodes allows one to become a Perfected One of the Nine Palaces.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: On the eight nodes, enter the chamber, circulate the talisman, and advance the fire. Beginning on the winter solstice at *zi*-hour, invoke the Fire Spirit and guard it in the kidneys. The yang fire circulates, and the spirit follows it. The kidneys are the root; the spirit chamber is the stem. From root to stem, root and stem are connected, forming the embryo and bearing fruit. One cycle spans three hours, from *zi* to the end of *yin*. Metal and fire press forward, driving it to the spirit chamber. The elixir gradually forms, corresponding to the winter solstice and the *Li-Chun* node, the *Kan* and *Gen* trigrams. At *mao*-hour, bathe; at *chen*-hour, advance the fire until the end of *si*. Metal and fire press forward, driving it to the sea of marrow, corresponding to the spring equinox and *Li-Xia* node, the *Zhen* and *Xun* trigrams. When the yang fire reaches its peak at *wu*-hour, circulate the talisman until the end of *shen*. Metal and water propel it, entering the chamber from the Magpie Bridge at the double pass. The dark pearl gradually appears, corresponding to the summer solstice and *Li-Qiu* node, the *Li* and *Kun* trigrams. At *you*-hour, bathe; at *xu*-hour, circulate the talisman until the end of *hai*. True *qi* returns to the origin, and a single yang revives, corresponding to the autumn equinox and *Li-Dong* node, the *Dui* and *Qian* trigrams. This cycle repeats endlessly. Thus, a year’s work is compressed into a single day to correspond to the eight nodes, using the eight trigrams as talismans. All these operations of yang fire and yin talismans return to the Central Palace. Nurturing the sacred embryo for ten months, when *qi* is full, the precious crucible’s work is complete. The embryo is shed, the spirit transforms—this is the Perfected One. The eight trigrams are arrayed in a circle, solid without and empty within. The *Book of Changes* says: \"The eight trigrams are arrayed, and the images are within them.\" This is why one becomes a Perfected One of the Nine Palaces.\n\nOn one’s natal day, chant this scripture to purify and rectify the hun-soul and spirit, preserve the myriad *qi* for eternity, avoid suffering and affliction, and radiate light from the body. The Three Realms provide attendants, the Five Emperors oversee reception, the myriad spirits pay homage, one’s name is inscribed in heaven, merit is complete and virtue perfected, and one ascends to the Upper Clarity.\n\nThe human body possesses three *hun*-souls: one resides in the celestial bureaus, originally belonging to its destined office; one dwells in the earthly prisons, and one abides within the physical form. The seven *po*-souls remain constantly present, never dispersing. On one’s natal day, the *hun*-souls descend into the body to join the corpse, merging in an unbroken cycle of return. Thus, the living person remains at peace, free from calamity and illness. If on that day one purifies body and mind, abstains from wine and lust, dons new garments, burns incense, and cultivates goodness—and further, if one sleeps briefly—then the *hun* and *po* unite, yin and yang merge, the Dao’s *qi* flourishes within, and the root of life is firmly secured. But if one indulges in wine and lust, befuddling the body, then when the *hun* should return, it lingers three paces away, unable to rejoin. Filth and defilement assail it, and the *hun* retreats. If this befuddlement occurs thrice, and the *hun* fails to unite with the *po*, yang wanes while yin waxes, and the numinous *po* consorts with yin ghosts. This gives rise to wandering nightmares, excessive sleep, confusion, and the onset of calamity and illness, ultimately leading to death. Yet if one observes a fast and recites scriptures on one’s natal day, the aforementioned responses occur: merit is complete, virtue perfected, and one ascends in flight.\n\nHaving cultivated and recited on one’s natal day, one thereby preserves one’s spirit and *qi*. The sages established these models, all for good reason. Extending this principle, the Way of cultivating the Real becomes self-evident.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: When the firing process is complete, practice the Way of shedding the embryo and transforming the spirit. The sacred embryo abides within the Sea of Marrow. Taking the sixty-day cycle of the stars as the period, one full natal cycle aligns with the stellar number. Suddenly, as if a thunderclap resounds, the Gate of Heaven splits open, the sacred embryo emerges, the mortal husk is shed for immortality, and one attains everlasting life. The Demon Kings bear witness, the hosts of heaven offer reception, merit is fulfilled, virtue exalted, and ascension awaits.\n\nLi Changling said: Merit is the work of daily practice; virtue is the renewal of each day. If one is as earnest as a farmer awaiting the harvest, as diligent as a merchant pursuing wealth—today accumulating virtue, tomorrow again accumulating virtue; today amassing merit, tomorrow again amassing merit—then the celestial immortal’s one thousand three hundred good deeds may be accomplished in four years, and the earthly immortal’s three hundred good deeds in one year. Yet most people falter midway, failing to heed the lessons of drilling stone or bowing to trees.\n\nThe Lady of Purple Tenuity said: Long ago, there was a Master Fu who, from youth, loved the Dao. He entered a stone chamber on Mount Jiao and practiced for seven years. Suddenly, he encountered the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate, who bestowed upon him a wooden drill and instructed him to bore through a stone chime. The Perfected One warned: \"When the stone is pierced, I shall deliver you.\" The stone was over five feet thick, yet Master Fu drilled without cease for forty-seven years. The stone was suddenly pierced, and the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate indeed came to deliver him.\n\nThe Lady of Southern Marchmount also said: Once, a man resolved to pursue the Dao but knew not the method. Day and night, he bowed to a withered tree, beseeching long life, never ceasing. After twenty-eight years, the tree suddenly bloomed, and its blossoms exuded a sap like honey. The man consumed the flowers and sap, and thus attained deliverance from the world. Alas! If drilling stone and bowing to trees can lead to deliverance, how much more so the holding of scriptures and practice of the wondrous Dao—could there be any who fail to attain it?\n\nThe Dao teaches: On days of practice, one should bathe in fragrant waters, fast, and enter the chamber. Facing east, knock the teeth thirty-two times, making it heard in the thirty-two heavens, and bow in the heart thirty-two times. On days of scripture recitation, first don proper attire, wash the hands and rinse the mouth, and place the scripture upon the desk. Then burn incense, perform the ritual invocation, kneel, and declare one’s intent to recite. Sit upright facing east, burn incense, open the scripture, focus the mind, and read in a soft voice. If an error occurs, return thirty characters and reread. Avoid haste; if one rushes to complete the count, it becomes a loss of merit and misleads many. Modulate the voice in recitation so that spirit and *hun* harmonize and flow smoothly, ensuring the incense’s fragrance never fades in the chamber.\n\nTo knock the teeth: bring the upper and lower central teeth together in pairs, making them resound. Internally, this gathers the spirit; externally, it reaches the heavens. The *Declarations of the Perfected* states: \"Knock the teeth to gather the spirit; swallow the saliva to harmonize the Real.\"\n\nNext, visualize bowing to the thirty-two heavens, imagining the Heavenly Emperor with each bow. Begin at the northeast, proceed eastward in a leftward circuit, and conclude at the northwest. Close the eyes and meditate, sitting amidst clouds of cyan, yellow, and white *qi*. The Mysterious *qi* is cyan, the Primordial *qi* is yellow, and the Initial *qi* is white. Within and without, all is misty and obscure. The Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Lion, and White Crane array themselves to left and right. Sun and moon shine brightly, illuminating the chamber. A circular radiance appears above the head, its light suffusing the ten directions—all vividly clear. The Azure Dragon to the left, White Tiger to the right, Vermilion Bird before, Dark Warrior behind; lions in two rows on either side, eight in each row, seated facing one another; white cranes likewise. The sun at the left of the forehead, the moon at the right. The chamber is filled with light, a circular radiance above the head; nine colors intermingle—cyan, red, yellow, white, black, green, crimson, purple, and deep blue—illuminating the ten directions. Visualize all with perfect clarity.\n\nThe secret incantation: \"Secret\" means the mouth moves but no sound is made.\n*Tanluo yuluo, fuwu sutuo.\nTaichong taiji, yinyang baohe.\nChu you ru wu, chusheng ru si.\nGuishen moce, bianhua ziru.\nYuanshi hunqi, xuan zhong you xuan.\nShang gan you ding, xia dong taiyuan.\nSong zhi yi bian, chen’e zi quan.\nLian hun yu po, zhenyang zi quan.\nZhaijie lishong, wan guo fei xian.\nWushang mizhou, wanshen mianmian.\nXin zhong xin zhou, chongfu xuanchuan.*\n\nThe *Tanluo* Cavern shines bright, merging with the Dao in truth.\nThe Jade Clarity’s highest realm, Brahmanic *qi* billows and swirls.\nDividing the numinous, spreading *qi*, it descends and pours into this servant’s body.\nForm and spirit both wondrous, transforming and ascending in flight.\nLet it be as the ordained pattern, governing and embracing the ten thousand spirits.\nHasten! As the law commands.\n\nThe Primordial of the Three Heavens above, the Mysterious Primordial Three *Qi*, the Most High Dao Lord.\nThe Mysterious Primordial Three *Qi* transform and give birth to the Three Treasures Lords, each dwelling in one heaven.\nThe Three Heavens reside at the hairline upon the human forehead:\nThe center is the Qingwei Heaven, ruled by the Heavenly Treasure Lord;\nThe left is the Yuyu Heaven, ruled by the Numinous Treasure Lord;\nThe right is the Taichi Heaven, ruled by the Spirit Treasure Lord.\nWhenever reciting scripture, one must visualize the Three Emperor Lords.\nSummon forth from this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Incense-Bearing Golden Youths, the Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans, and the Direct-Day Incense Officials—thirty-six of each.\nIn the upper, middle, and lower three realms, eight in each, three eights making twenty-four, together with the three *hun* souls, seven *po* souls, and the Yin and Yang Lords, totaling thirty-six.\nUnlock and declare what is to be said.\nThose who have received the register of the law shall state their rank.\nIf one has not received the register, they shall be called a Dao-disciple, and should devote their heart to the words they wish to speak.\nYet brevity and sincerity are most precious; present it silently and earnestly.\nToday is an auspicious day, a long fast—\nToday, on this auspicious day, speak according to the day.\nIf it is a long fast, say so; if not, do not mention it.\nIn the Pure Hall, cultivating the scripture to its completion—\nIf one knows the way of the covenant within the Three Caverns, and sees the practice being performed, say “cultivating the scripture to its completion.” If not, simply say “reciting scripture in the Pure Hall.”\nSaving boundless beings.\nIf reciting for a single matter, say “reciting scripture for such-and-such a matter.”\nIf for universal salvation in the ten directions, then one may say “saving boundless beings.”\nThis servant and so-and-so, turning the scripture to receive rebirth—\nIf reciting for oneself at ordinary times, say “this servant and my ancestors.”\nIf for another, say “this servant for so-and-so.”\nSimply state it according to one’s intent.\n“So-and-so” refers to the principle of such-and-such a person.\nMay what is declared ascend directly to the presence of the Most High Thirty-Two Heavens’ Primordial Thearch, the August One.\nThe Primordial Thearch is not the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, but the Highest Thearch, whose rank is equal to the Primordial One.\nSome say the Primordial Thearch is the Heavenly Worthy.\nWhen finished, draw in *qi* thirty-two times—\n“Drawing” means inhaling through the nose and swallowing.\n“Thirty-two times” means in the four directions—east, south, west, and north—eight heavens in each direction, one inhalation per direction.\nThe green *qi* of the east is absorbed into the liver;\nThe red *qi* of the south is absorbed into the heart;\nThe white *qi* of the west is absorbed into the lungs;\nThe mysterious *qi* of the north is absorbed into the kidneys.\nWhen it thoroughly permeates the five viscera, then recite the scripture.\nFace east when reciting scripture.\nThe east is the direction of long life, revered by all heavens.\nThe method of reciting scripture: the first cycle begins with the preface and continues until the visualization is complete, then recite the subsequent scripture.\nThe second cycle should begin with *The Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial’s Boundless Salvation of Beings, Upper Chapter*.\nEvery ten cycles make one completion. If seeking to dispel misfortune or deliver salvation, ten cycles are best, in accordance with the principle of saving beings ten times over.\nIf temporarily interrupted by other matters, even if the recitation has lasted some time, one must return to the previous method.\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: As above, when the furnace is activated, the secret incantation is recited, the practice is performed, the officials are summoned, and the intent of the fast is communicated to seek resonance and response.\nAs for the three *qi* billowing in darkness, the six spirits standing guard, the sun and moon shining brilliantly, and the circular image illuminating all—all these are prepared within the inner image.\nAll methods have both inner and outer aspects; matters are preserved in both. If there is inner without outer, it is not the Great Dao, but belongs to side teachings. Inner cultivation is secret, outer application is manifest.\nThus, the Most High subtly reveals inner cultivation and makes outer application evident, guiding people to trace the flow back to its source, to exhaust the end and know the root, enabling them to awaken and realize for themselves, to practice both together, and thereby attain the Dao of immortality.\n\n*Inner Meaning of the Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial’s Boundless Salvation of Beings, Upper Chapter, Scroll Two* ends.\n\n*Inner Meaning of the Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial’s Boundless Salvation of Beings, Upper Chapter, Scroll Three*\n\nGuanfuzi Xiao Yingsou studies *The Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial’s Boundless Salvation of Beings, Upper Chapter*. The August Personage says: This is the title bestowed by the Dao Lord.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* states: Jade tablets and numinous chapters are divided into the Three Caverns—Cavern of Perfection, Cavern of Mystery, and Cavern of Divinity. Taken together, they form the One Vehicle. This scripture belongs to the Cavern of Mystery and stands as the crown of all scriptures. Thus, the Most High Dao Lord prefaced it, entitling it *The Most High Cavern of Mystery, Numinous Treasure*. Yet here it is directly titled *The Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial’s Boundless Salvation of Beings, Upper Chapter*, to clarify that it was spoken by the Heavenly Worthy of the Primordial Void. As scripture, it bears this name; as elixir, it is the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir.\n\n*Primordial Cavern of Mystery, Numinous Treasure Fundamental Chapter*—this is the inner title given by the August Personage. *Primordial* means first, born before Heaven. *Beginning* means congealing, where the primordial qi first coalesces. *Cavern* means penetrating, boundless in reach. *Mystery* means emptiness, profound and void. Thus, the primordial qi first congeals to form the jade script within the empty mystery, illuminating the four directions. Emptiness becomes numinous, and concealment becomes treasure.\n\nIt is also said: The beginning gives rise to the One, and the One is Heaven. Heaven emerges from the beginning, so the beginning is also primordial. When all converges in the primordial, at the time of primordial generation, there is no Heaven, no Earth, no spirits, no ghosts—only the vast, chaotic expanse, undifferentiated and indistinct. Then the primordial congeals to form the jade script. Jade is the essence of spontaneity; its essence radiates light to form Heaven and Earth, giving rise to the sun, moon, and stars. The Primordial Venerable Deity is so named to reveal its numinosity. The generation of Heaven, Earth, sun, moon, and stars serves to nurture the myriad beings. That Heaven, Earth, and the myriad beings later receive names demonstrates the creative transformation of the Primordial Beginning. The name *Primordial Beginning* is given to show people that the end and the beginning share the same destination.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* states: *Primordial Beginning* refers to the primordial ancestral qi of the spontaneous Void, penetrating and mysterious. *Penetrating* means pervading all; *mysterious* means wondrously inexhaustible. *Numinous Treasure* is another name for the Golden Elixir. *Fundamental* means root; *chapter* means text. It signifies that the primordial ancestral qi of the spontaneous Void, pervading all and wondrously inexhaustible, serves as the root of the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir, unfolding as text to reveal its traces.\n\n*Upper Chapter, Wondrous Beginning, Ten Cycles of Salvation*—In the era of Dragon Han, the jade script first emerged, the sun and moon first shone, and Heaven and Earth were divided. The host of sages took their places, and the Primordial Beginning expounded the Dharma to save beings, reciting the scripture ten times, circling the ten directions, and delivering countless beings. The Primordial Beginning thus composed ten divisions of wondrous scriptures, inscribed with purple brush on the Azure Forest of Empty Green. Revered by all sages as the ancestral scripture, it is called *Upper Chapter, Wondrous Beginning*.\n\n*Hundred Demons Conceal the Rhyme, Separation and Union Spontaneous*—These four lines summarize the essential purport of the entire scripture.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* states: *Upper Chapter, Wondrous Beginning* refers to the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir as the crown of the supreme wondrous Dao. *Ten Cycles of Salvation* signifies the ten months’ work of elixir refinement, delivering one to immortality—this is the practice of ten months’ seclusion. *Hundred Demons Conceal the Rhyme* is like the various names of the elixir; *Separation and Union Spontaneous* resembles the alternation of metal and wood, which though distinct can merge, or water and fire, which though opposing achieve harmony—all spontaneously completing the transformation.\n\n*Chaotic Red Script, Supreme True of the Non-None*—*Chaotic* is the name of primordial chaos; *cavern* refers to the qi of cavernous yang; *red script* is the vermilion true script. At the dawn of chaos, before Heaven and Earth, it coagulated above the empty cavern, condensing within the Great None. The *none* of the Great None is itself non-existent; since it is non-existent, it is called the *Non-None*, hence the *Supreme True of the Non-None*.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* states: *Chaotic Red Script* is the root-source of the myriad transformations and the true nature of all beings. In the Dao, it is the ancestor of the One Qi; in humans, it is the origin of the myriad spirits. Before Heaven, Earth, and the myriad beings, none know its beginning, hence *Primordial Beginning*; in forming Heaven, Earth, and the myriad beings, none know its numinous wonder, hence *Numinous Treasure*; in governing Heaven, Earth, and the myriad beings, none know its vastness, hence *Virtue/Power*; in guiding people to return to the root and practice, it is called *Wondrous Scripture*; in gathering people to revert to the origin and cultivate, it is called *Returned Elixir*. It unfolds into the Three Vehicles, establishes the Three Teachings, and gives rise to boundless Dharma gates—all its transformations.\n\nTang Emperor Minghuang’s *Eulogy of the Primordial* says:\nGreat indeed is the Supreme Dao!\nPrimordial is spontaneity,\nEnding and beginning kalpas,\nBefore Earth, before Heaven,\nEnveloping light in silence,\nEternally enduring.\nIn the East, it instructed Confucius;\nIn the West, it transformed the Golden Immortal.\nA hundred kings took it as model,\nMyriad sages transmitted it.\nAncestor of the Great Teaching,\nMysterious beyond mystery.\n\nThus, the *Dao De Jing* says: There is a thing chaotically formed, born before Heaven and Earth. I know not its name, so I style it the *Dao*. The *Scripture of Western Ascent* says: The Void gives rise to spontaneity, and spontaneity gives rise to the Dao. The Dao is formless and bodiless—it is the primordial One Qi. Yet in generating the myriad beings, it is truly the root of Heaven and Earth’s creative transformation. Those who refine the Golden Elixir emulate this transformation, using the qi of the spontaneous Void—primordial, pure, true, and unified—called the *Empty Qi Golden Embryo*, to generate the Golden Mother and establish the foundation of the elixir.\n\nThis pure, true, unified qi, before the union of father and mother, was one body with chaos. The *Dao De Jing* says: The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth—this is it. In scripture, it is thus called *chaotic*. At the moment of the parents’ union, this qi suddenly attaches, forcibly named *spirit*, called *yang essence*, likened to silver ore. This is the primordial spirit, concealed within the Palace of Earth.\n\nBetween the two kidneys—this is called *nature*, our original face. Before birth, it is termed *yin metal*; after birth, *yang lead*, the mother of the five metals. There is nothing in Heaven and Earth or the ten thousand transformations that does not rely on this qi for its establishment. The *Dao De Jing* says: \"The named is the mother of the myriad beings\"—this is it.\n\nMaster Zhenyi Peng’s preface to the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Directly pointing to the numinous root of Heaven and Earth, it is taken as the ancestor of the medicine; clearly revealing the sagely mother of yin and yang, it is used as the foundation of the elixir\"—this is it. As the wondrously transforming qi of daily use returns to the Central Palace to become the *Elixir Mother*, it is said: \"The Dao gives birth to the One,\" resembling the *Ancestral Qi*, coalescing into the *Jade Letter*. In scripture, it is called *Red Script*—this is *metal and fire*. *Metal* is the spontaneous qi of the primordial, the *Golden Embryo*; *fire* is the yang qi of daily arising. Both emerge from a single source, forming substance and function.\n\nThis is the supreme, unsurpassable, most true and wondrous Dao, hence called the *Peerless True*. From the primordial beginning of the ancestral kalpa, the myriad heavens were generated. *Ancestral* means *beginning*. The mysterious primordial qi at the dawn of the ancestral kalpa suddenly gave rise to the five billion heavens. Now, Heaven and Earth undergo one completion and one destruction—this is called a *kalpa*. The *beginning kalpa* refers to the world’s initial arising, before any completion or destruction.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: Zhou Lianhan said: \"Great indeed is Qian’s origin! The myriad beings rely on it for their beginning—it is the source of sincerity. As the Qian Dao transforms and changes, each attains its nature and destiny, and sincerity is thereby established.\" Thus, the *primordial ancestral kalpa* is the greatness of Qian’s origin, on which the myriad beings rely for their beginning—this is the source of the true. The generation of the myriad heavens is the Qian Dao’s transformation and change, wherein each attains its nature and destiny—then the true is established.\n\nTracing the origin of the myriad heavens’ generation: from the One Qi, the Three Realms are established; from the Three Realms, the Nine Heavens arise. Each of the Three Realms and Nine Heavens further generates three heavens below, totaling thirty-six heavens. Below these are the four kinds of mortal heavens, then the division into the Three Realms and twenty-eight heavens, followed by the eight Brahma heavens, extending to the generation of five billion heavens and eight spherical worlds. Human birth follows a similar pattern: the parents’ essence and blood envelop one’s inherent nature and destiny to form them.\n\nWhen a person first takes shape in the mother’s womb, essence and blood have not yet congealed, drifting and shifting like pearls or dew. After congealing, the form develops three segments: the head and four limbs. In males, the left kidney forms first, then the right *Gate of Destiny*; in females, the reverse. The original nature continues the lineage between the two kidneys, called the *Palace of Earth*, whence the wondrously transforming qi of daily use arises. Next, the divine water of the two pupils forms above, extending to the generation of the five viscera and six bowels. Relying on the mother’s breath, when qi is sufficient, birth occurs.\n\nThus, Laozi said: \"Heaven and Earth unite their essences, and yin and yang distribute transformation. In the first month, it is the *embryo sac*, as essence and blood congeal; in the second, the *fetus*, as form begins to take shape; in the third, the yang spirit becomes the *three hun*, moving to generate life; in the fourth, the yin numen becomes the *seven po*, stillness stabilizing form; in the fifth, the five phases divide into the five viscera, to settle the spirit; in the sixth, the six pitch-standards determine the six bowels, to aid the numinous; in the seventh, the seven essences open the seven orifices, to communicate light; in the eighth, the eight luminous spirits are complete, descending true numen; in the ninth, palaces are arrayed, to secure essence; in the tenth, qi is sufficient, and the myriad images are complete.\"\n\nThough humans share the same creative transformation as Heaven and Earth, they do not attain equal longevity—why? It is because they cannot return to their root. The *root* is the *Ancestral Qi*. Rooted in the One Heart, one concentrates on the One Qi to attain softness, cultivates the One Heart to accomplish the Dao. If one can penetrate and unite them, then \"closing the door to build the cart\" and \"exiting the gate to match the tracks\" are one—returning to the root and restoring the origin, with form and spirit both wondrous.\n\nThus, Master Fu’s eulogy for Śākyamuni says: \"For what reason did he spend six years on Snow Mountain? Only to harmonize qi and spirit. In one hundred moments making one breath, one then knows the Great Dao is the complete body.\" To penetrate and unite them—this eulogy is it. Therefore, the Daoist crown, Confucian shoes, and Buddhist kasaya are not worn in vain.\n\nThe *Three Luminaries* revealed are called the *Heavenly Root*. As the Two Modes divide form and the Three Lights hang their radiance, all receive the *Beginning Qi*—hence it is the *Heavenly Root*. The *Inner Meaning* states: The scripture says, \"The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two give birth to the Three, and the Three give birth to the myriad beings.\" Thus, the *Scripture of the Spontaneous Origin of the Void and Natural* says: \"Only when the Dao attains the Three is it complete.\" Hence it is said: \"The Three unite to form virtue\"; if the Dao does not fill the Three, nothing is accomplished.\n\nThe *Appended Sayings* states: \"The *Yi* has the Supreme Ultimate, which gives birth to the Two Modes.\" From the One Qi, clear and turbid divide—this is the Three. The *Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Generation of the Spirit* says: \"Three qi combine to generate nine qi. The Three Qi are the ancestors of Heaven and Earth; the Nine Qi are the roots of the myriad beings. From the Three completing the Nine, they become the roots of beings—this is called 'the Three give birth to the myriad beings.' The Three unite to form virtue: in the Dao, they are the Three Qi; in beings, the Three Powers; in Heaven, the Three Lights; in humans, the Three Origins. All are the *Ancestral Qi* of the primordial beginning, the root of the myriad beings.\" Hence it is said: \"The Three Luminaries revealed are the Heavenly Root.\"\n\nWith regard to the internal, borrowing metaphorical images, they are called *lead, mercury, and cinnabar*. Directly pointing to the thing itself, they are one’s inherent nature and the two qi of daily wondrous transformation—yin and yang. Though one may know the inherent nature, without understanding the function of the two realms, one still cannot avoid decline and decay.\n\nMaster Zhongli said: \"The interpenetration of being and non-being is called the root of the elixir; the correspondence of concealment and revelation is *water and metal*...\"\n\nDo not call this body a mere vessel of the Dao, for solitary cultivation of one thing is but solitary yin.\n\nAmong the myriad beings between Heaven and Earth, first there is the root, and only then the stem. Take the fruit with its kernel as the root; when planted in soil, yin and yang contend and fuse, the husk splits, the sprout emerges, and roots take hold—thus it grows lush, blossoms, bears fruit, and its life knows no end. Without roots and trunk, to seek the root’s enduring presence is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the Heavenly Worthy first pointed to *Ancestral Qi* as the root of the Dao, then clarified the Three Realms as the Dao’s stem. From this, root descends and branches flow, giving rise to the myriad beings. If one can constantly be desireless to observe its wonders, turning inward to embody sincerity, then one encompasses Heaven and Earth, and creation arises from the self.\n\nThe scripture says: \"The cosmos lies within the hand, the myriad transformations arise from the body.\" This is no reckless claim.\n\nAbove, there is no ancestor beyond the Dao; the Dao alone is the body. The wondrous root forms of itself, without prior ancestor, all-encompassing and boundless—this is the Dao-body. The Dao takes emptiness and nothingness as its宗, spontaneity as its root, and the Dao as its body.\n\nYet these three are all without form or appearance. Tracing their principle, they are true emptiness. Within the true lies essence, inherently without name. When the sages established teachings, they could not be without a宗, so they raised emptiness and nothingness as the Dao’s ancestor. In truth, the three bodies converge in the one real, utterly without form, yet able to penetrate all wonders.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* says: \"Though the categories of Heaven, Earth, and beings differ, they share no separate root; all are transformed by the Dao alone.\"\n\nThus the *Scripture of Laozi’s Ascent to the West* says: \"The Dao is the *primordial qi* of emptiness and nothingness, the undifferentiated spontaneity, without exterior or interior, without high or low. Heaven and Earth are born from it, and the myriad beings take shape through it.\"\n\nIt also says: \"All beings with form are born from the Dao.\"\n\nThe *Scripture of Ascent to the West* says: \"Heaven, Earth, and beings all originate from the Dao’s source, emerging together from the primordial beginning of Great Simplicity and emptiness.\" Thus the Golden Elixir of Returning Cinnabar shares the same essence.\n\nThe Five Scripts unfold and establish the numinous. Without script, there is no radiance; without script, no illumination; without script, no establishment; without script, no completion; without script, no deliverance; without script, no life. The Five True Scripts unfold their forms, universally planting Heaven and Earth and arranging the numinous spirits. Without the unfolding of the True Scripts, the sun and moon would not shine, the stars would not gleam, Qian and Kun would not stand, the world would not be at peace, the hidden souls would not be delivered, and the withered bones would not live.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* says: \"Within the elixir, the Five Scripts are the Five Agents, transformed from the *primordial qi* of the Prior Heaven. Timed and stored within the chamber as *lead-water*, their wondrous function stirs and gives rise to *cinnabar-wood*. When yang reaches its extreme and generates yin, it is called *mercury*—fire. When yin returns to the yang chamber, it becomes *silver*—metal. Within the Central Palace, it is perfected as the elixir—earth. Distributed through the Five Phases, it scatters and transforms the myriad spirits, all through the wondrous function of the one *qi*, the root and宗 of the myriad Dao.\"\n\nThus it is said: \"The Five Scripts unfold and establish the numinous.\" Without this, the eyes do not see, the heart is not bright, the body does not stand, the elixir does not form, the living are not delivered, and the dead do not live.\n\nThis is the Great Brahma, the Heaven within Heaven.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* says: \"These two lines summarize the preceding text, referring to the profound within the profound of the Great Dao. Regarding the elixir, the Way of the Golden Elixir is scattered throughout the scriptures—some take clarity and stillness as their宗, some emptiness and nothingness, some speak of yin and yang, some of creation and transformation, some of dragon and tiger, lead and mercury, some of spirit and *qi*, water and fire. This scripture encompasses all forms and is most complete, analyzing the utmost principle without omission. Thus it is called the Great Brahma, the Heaven within Heaven.\"\n\nThose who attain it may plumb the root and seek the source, fathom the divine and know transformation, repose in the realm of the mysterious and empty, and wander freely in the field of the numinous treasure. In the four dignified postures, there is nothing that is not the practice of the Dao.\n\nThe lush and verdant Terrace of Great Luo, the Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital.\n\n\"Lush\" means flourishing; \"Luo\" is the Great Luo Heaven. Above the Great Luo Heaven lies the Jade Capital Mountain, upon which stands the Seven Treasures Mystic Terrace within the Seven Treasures City. Within it is the Jade Clarity Palace, where the Highest Jade Emperor resides.\n\nAbove the Jade Clarity is a nine-tiered terrace, reaching the utmost heights, merging with the Great Nothingness. Thus it shines upon the lush Great Luo, the serene nine-tiered terrace. \"Great Nothingness\" is the Great Luo; as the mountain is of jade, it is called the Jade Mountain. Atop the mountain is a capital, hence the Upper Capital, also called the Jade Capital or Jade Clarity, all named for jade. This is collectively known as the Mystic Capital Jade Capital.\n\nAbove, it reaches the utmost, the Great Luo Jade Clarity. The realm of the Great Luo Jade Clarity is of boundless height and distance, with nothing above it, able to encompass all heavens—thus it is called the Great Luo. Above it is no dust, vast and open, the realm of the effortless Dao.\n\nVast and immeasurable, as if vanished, as if present. \"Vast\" means distant and far-reaching. \"Eon\" is like a giant stone, four hundred *li* square, or like an empty city, four hundred *li* square, equal in height and breadth, filled with mustard seeds. Every hundred years, a heavenly being takes one mustard seed. When the stone is worn away by a silk robe and the mustard seeds are exhausted, this is called one eon. Thus the *Scripture of Pacing the Void* says: \"Gazing up at the Terrace of Eons\"—this is what it means.\n\nThe Seven Treasures Terrace is not seen by earthly immortals, much less by ordinary people. Those who see it say it exists; those who do not say it is gone—thus it is \"as if vanished, as if present.\" This is not a fixed appearance. Though it may have form, it has no substance, the true essence of creation, spontaneous and self-so.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: \"The Terrace of Lush Canopy\" refers to the space between the brain. \"The Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital\" is the Mud-Pill Palace. \"The Supreme, Unsurpassed Great Luo Jade Clarity\" is the Great Mystery above the Mud-Pill. The secret inner mechanism is called the \"soaring of sun and moon,\" the essential method of spirit-transformation and womb-escape. The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: \"Soaring above sun and moon, I ascend the Dao—only then does one behold the Jade Clarity’s Void-and-Aged One.\" Vast and measureless as eons, \"as if vanished, as if present\"—this is the nature, not something measurable by images, numbers, directions, or colors, nor is it a dim obscurity utterly devoid of substance. It is akin to the Great Void, elusive and profound, thus \"vast and measureless as eons,\" beyond all scrutiny. \"As if vanished, as if present\"—this is the elusive and profound.\n\nThe scripture says: \"Gazing, it cannot be seen; listening, it cannot be heard; using, it cannot be exhausted.\" Master Zhang the Perfected says: \"Gazing, its form cannot be seen; yet when called, it responds. Do not say this sound is like an echo in a valley—for if there were no valley, what sound would there be?\"\n\nThe Three Flowers depart and transform, revealing the wondrous court of the Great Existence. The Three Flowers are the Golden Flower, Jade Flower, and Ninefold Flower—three palaces. \"Depart and transform\" means these three palaces are the detached halls of the Jade Clarity’s realm. \"Great Existence\" refers to the Supreme Great Existence. The Jade Clarity Palace is where the Heavenly Worthy presides, hence it is called the wondrous court.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The Mud-Pill’s brain-space is called the Detached Palace, also the Noon Position, also the Qian Palace. The number three corresponds to the south. \"Flower\" refers to the flower canopy, also called the round canopy—the cavity where all passages converge, where the myriad spirits pay homage. This is the Mud-Pill’s brain-space. \"Detached\" is the south’s Noon Position. \"Transform\" means change: when yang *qi* reaches *si* (the sixth earthly branch), it reaches its peak and transforms to generate yin, which begins at *wu* (the seventh branch). The *Scripture of Dragon and Tiger* says: \"The yang line ends at *si*; true yin arises, emanating from *li* (fire) at *wu*.\"\n\n\"Great Existence\" is explained in the *Book of Changes*: \"Fire in the sky is Great Existence.\" *Li* and *wu* are fire; the Qian Palace is heaven. \"Wondrous\" is the mysterious; \"court\" is the center. The mysterious is the mysterious *qi*—the primordial *qi* of the Mysterious Origin. The center is the brain’s center. \"Center\" refers to the middle of the four directions; applied to inner matters, it means the brain’s center, heart’s center, or spleen’s center. When mysterious *qi* resides in the brain’s center, true yin is born at *li* and *wu*. In terms of hexagrams, the yielding occupies the honored position, and all yang lines respond to it. This symbolizes the August Heavenly Worthy, serene atop the Jade Clarity, while heaven, earth, and the myriad things naturally transform and take shape below.\n\nThe Golden Gates and Jade Chambers stand in solemn array, pure and luminous. The gates of gold gleam resplendently, encircling the chambers of white jade—pristine, majestic, and radiant. The *Inner Meaning* states: The Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery’s Golden Flower says: \"Earth’s essence generates stone; stone’s yin essence becomes jade, and its yang essence becomes gold.\" Thus the *Scripture of Gold* says: \"Within a single stone, yin and yang divide to become gold and jade—this is what is meant by 'one yin, one yang, that is the Dao.'\"\n\nThe Golden Gates are the sun; the Jade Chambers are the moon. \"Solemn array\" refers to the constellations; \"pure and luminous\" describes the sun, moon, and stars—clear, bright, and resplendent. The sun and moon are the essence of yin and yang, the substance of *kan* and *li*, the function of *qian* and *kun*. Within the sun is the image of a crow; within *li* (fire) is the yin moon, and within it is the image of a rabbit. Within *kan* (water) is yang, but yang cannot shine without yin, just as its spirit cannot glow without yang. Its corporeal soul arranges the constellations to encircle the heavens as the warp, while the sun, moon, and five planets move through their degrees as the weft, shifting cold and heat to transform the myriad things. In the elixir path, this becomes the mechanism of transmutation, the wondrous function of talismanic fire. Thus the *Triplex Unity* cites the *Book of Changes*: \"Heaven and earth establish their positions, and the *Changes* move within them.\"\n\n\"Heaven and earth\" are *qian* and *kun*. \"Establish their positions\" means arranging yin and yang in proper alignment. The *Changes* refer to *kan* and *li*. *Kan* and *li* are the two functions of *qian* and *kun*. These two functions, without fixed lines, circulate through the six voids. Their coming and going are unfixed; their rising and falling have no constancy. It also says: \"*Kan* is *wu*’s lunar essence; *li* is *ji*’s solar radiance. Sun and moon are the *Changes*, hard and soft in balance.\" The *Changes* are images. No image is more luminous than the suspended sun and moon. To fathom the spirit is to know transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives.\n\nIt also says: \"Once chaos is conjoined, connect the roots, establish the foundation, cultivate and nourish the calyx, and concentrate the spirit to form the body.\" Master True Unity annotates: \"Heaven and earth establish their positions\" refers to the *ji-ji* (already-accomplished) cauldron, which symbolizes *qian* and *kun*. The *Changes* move within it—yin and yang, *li* and *kan*, operate within it. Within, the Golden Mother is settled; without, water and fire are applied. Through movement and stillness, circulation through the six voids, they become the source of transformation and the foundation of mutual generation.\n\n\"*Kan* is *wu*’s lunar essence.\" The moon is yin; *wu* is yang—thus it is yang within yin, symbolizing the golden tiger within water. \"*Li* is *ji*’s solar radiance.\" The sun is yang; *ji* is yin—thus it is yin within yang, symbolizing the mercurial dragon within fire. Therefore, the *Changes* are the image of the medicine. They are formed by the union of sun and moon. The great elixir of golden fluid is created by combining the essence-*qi* of the sun and moon’s yin and yang. Thus the *qi* of yin and yang emerges and withdraws, expands and contracts, circulating day and night in an endless cycle. Talismanic fire advances and retreats; yin comes and yang goes, yang hides and yin acts.\n\n\"Chaos\" is the spirit-chamber. The yin-yang dragon and tiger within chaos receive the transformative *qi* of intercourse, establishing the root, nurturing the calyx, and ultimately concentrating the spirit to form the body. Thus, within the cauldron-chamber, another heaven and earth, another sun and moon, operate wondrously.\n\nThe Great Circulating *Fanqi* pervades the ten directions.\nThe True Dao of Jade Purity’s *fanqi* flows abundantly through the realms of the ten directions, circulating through the bounds of all heavens. Within it dwells the spirit who delivers people from death—\nacross the ten directions of all heavens, this spirit presides over the deliverance of the world from mortality, not that the spirit itself is immortal.\nWithin it dwells the Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen,\nthe Great Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen, who governs the register of life.\nWithin it dwells the Great Spirit Marshal who delivers the world,\nin the Southern Palace resides the Marshal who delivers the world, along with the Great Spirit who delivers the world, both governing within the palace and presiding over deliverance.\nWithin it dwells the Venerable Lord Han, Master of Life.\nThe Lord of Life, named You, rules the Upper Palace of Nanchang. Lord Han is the most revered among spirits, called the Venerable Master, who oversees the register of longevity.\nWithin it dwell the Exalted Spirits of the Southern Upper Offices of Life and Register, of Prolonging Life and Augmenting Destiny, of Delivering from Tribulation—\nthe Southern Upper is another name for the Cavernous Yang Palace. The Exalted Spirits are the True Lords of the Six Offices of the Southern Dipper.\nThey restore bones and raise the dead, delivering countless beings.\nThese two lines summarize the preceding text: from the spirit who delivers people to all these offices of true officials, all possess the power to restore bones, raise the dead, and deliver beings to the Dao across kalpas.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The Great Circulating *Fanqi* is the primordial pure essence, the True One’s *qi* stored within the Kun Palace. Wondrously transforming and generating, it ascends to the Qian Palace; when yang reaches its peak, yin arises, descending to return to the origin. Ascending and descending in ceaseless circulation, it flows without end—hence it is said to pervade the ten directions. Master Zhang the Perfected says: It is merely mercury, a single flavor circulating through all the celestial bodies. Dao Guang says: It is the barefoot fierce general traversing the twelve positions. Thus, as yang-*qi* daily flourishes, it nurtures the sacred embryo to deliver the world and attain longevity, transcending the mortal form through spiritual transformation. Through cultivation, this is attained without limit—is this not the spirit who delivers people from death, the Lord of Longevity, the Great Spirit who delivers the world, the Venerable Lord Han, the Offices of Life and Register, the Prolongers of Life and Augmenters of Destiny, the Exalted Spirits who deliver from tribulation, who restore bones, raise the dead, and deliver countless beings?\n\nThe Mysterious Master says: The Metal Mother resides on Tortoise Mountain in the West, speaking of the body of metal; it is also called Dragon Mountain, speaking of the Dao of wood. It is the root and pivot of primordial *qi*, the abyssal palace of true earth. At the northwest corner, between Hai and Zi, dwells the sovereign of *fanqi*, the True Mother of the Feminine One. The myriad *qi* pay homage day and night; if even a speck of worldly thought arises, the Great Circulation is lost, and *fanqi* cannot suffuse the body. Can the cultivator of truth not be vigilant?\n\nThe above is the main scripture, the original text spoken by the Primordial Beginning. Today, it is collated and recorded as the heavens look down. Today marks the beginning of the Red Clarity Kalpa, the day of unfolding the chart and collating the records in the land of Fuli. The collation compares the records of merit and transgression. The *Inner Meaning* states: At this time, the myriad spirits gather in the chamber.\n\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit-King, Great Sage of Longevity, Infinite Deliverer of Beings of the Eastern Direction—\nin the Eight Directions of the Mysterious Capital’s Jade Capital Mountain, each of the three thousand great thousand worlds holds the Eastern Boundless Heavens’ Great Hall Township, the Great Thousand World of Gathering Worthies.\n\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit-King, Great Sage of Longevity, Infinite Deliverer of Beings of the Southern Direction—\nthe Southern Heavens’ Wanli City, the Great Thousand World of Abandoning Worthies.\n\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit-King, Great Sage of Longevity, Infinite Deliverer of Beings of the Western Direction—\nthe Western Heavens’ Fortune Hall Continent, the Great Thousand World of Universal Conduct.\n\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit-King, Great Sage of Longevity, Infinite Deliverer of Beings of the Northern Direction—\nthe Northern Heavens’ Yudan Plain, the Great Thousand World of Purity.\n\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit-King, Great Sage of Longevity, Infinite Deliverer of Beings of the Northeastern Direction—\nthe Northeastern Heavens’ Fortune Gathering Capital, the Great Thousand World of Eternal Peace.\n\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit-King, Great Sage of Longevity, Infinite Deliverer of Beings of the Southeastern Direction—\nthe Southeastern Heavens’ Primordial Fortune Field, the Great Thousand World of Employing Worthies.\n\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit-King, Great Sage of Longevity, Infinite Deliverer of Beings of the Southwestern Direction—\nthe Southwestern Heavens’ Longevity Township, the Great Thousand World of Benevolent Stillness.\n\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit-King, Great Sage of Longevity, Infinite Deliverer of Beings of the Northwestern Direction—\nthe Northwestern Heavens’ Fortune Virtue Plain, the Great Thousand World of Prolonging Worthies.\n\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit-King, Great Sage of Longevity, Infinite Deliverer of Beings of the Upper Direction—\nwithin the Boundless Supreme Mysterious Capital’s Jade Capital and Purple Tenuity, the countless Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings.\n\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit-King, Great Sage of Longevity, Infinite Deliverer of Beings of the Lower Direction—\nthe hosts of the Five Marchmounts, Five Emperors, Cavernous Yin, Pure Numinosity, and Northern Capital’s various palaces below.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: In terms of the body, from the Mud Pill above to the Bubbling Spring below, the *qi* of the five viscera, three fields, and myriad joints. The myriad spirits gather into one spirit, the myriad *qi* merge into one *qi*, grasping and lifting heaven and earth, seizing and holding the principles of yin and yang.\n\nThe Perfected Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings of the Ten Directions, Great Spirits of Longevity and Deliverance—\nthis summarizes the preceding text: these Perfected Sages of the ten directions all oversee the supervision of attaining the Dao, achieving perfection, longevity, and deliverance. Hence they are called the Great Sages, Infinite Deliverers of Beings. Together they ride flying clouds, cinnabar chariots, and green carriages, with feathered canopies and jade wheels, drawn by a single vermilion phoenix and five-colored dark dragons, bearing nine-colored standards and ten mystic banners. The flying clouds are the Three Pure Clouds. Each Spirit-King rides a chariot of cinnabar mist and a carriage of azure mist, with vermilion sparrows and phoenixes as canopies, and wheels of seven treasures and jade. Jade maidens bear the nine-colored standards, and Perfected Ones hold the ten mystic banners. Ahead, nine phoenixes sing in unison; behind, eight simurghs cry in harmony. Before them, there is singing and whistling, so nine phoenixes sing together; behind them, pipes and flutes sound, so eight simurghs cry in unison.\n\nLions and white cranes chant and sing in harmonious resonance—this is the Music of the Celestial Sphere. In the Left Palace of Heavenly Unity, there are musical instruments: on the *zi* day, Jade Maidens play the *sheng* and *yu*; on the *chou* day, Jade Maidens chant and sing; on the *yin* day, Jade Maidens pluck the zither; on the *mao* day, Jade Maidens strike the *zhu*; on the *chen* day, Jade Maidens play the *qin*; on the *si* day, Jade Maidens chime bells and strike chimes; on the *wu* day, Jade Maidens blow the *xiao*; on the *wei* day, Jade Maidens play the *jia*; on the *shen* day, Jade Maidens sing the Nine-Toned Song; on the *you* day, Jade Maidens sing the Six-Variation Song; on the *xu* day, Jade Maidens imitate the cries of a hundred beasts; and on the *hai* day, Jade Maidens compose the world’s newest melodies. Their names align with the mortal realm, yet their sounds differ from worldly music—where mortal tunes are mournful and hasten life’s end, celestial music is harmonious and prolongs existence.\n\nThe Five Elders lead the way, while hosts of immortals flank the chariot poles. The Ten Directions’ Great Sages, their Dao ranks most exalted, are moved to have the Five Emperors guide them from the front, with legions of immortals as their escort. The Five Elders are: in the East, the Azure Spirit First Elder, surnamed Guan, named Kai, styled Lingwei Yang, who harmonizes the spring *qi* to birth the myriad things; in the South, the Cinnabar Spirit True Elder, surnamed Dongfu, named Jiyan, styled Chibiao Nu, who harmonizes the summer *qi* to nurture the myriad things; in the Center, the Primordial Spirit Prime Elder, surnamed Tongban, named Yuanshi, styled Hanzhu Niu, who harmonizes the earth *qi* to uphold the Nine Heavens; in the West, the Radiant Spirit August Elder, surnamed Shangjin, named Changkai, styled Yaopo Bao, who harmonizes the autumn *qi* to ripen the myriad things; and in the North, the Five Spirits Mystic Elder, surnamed Heijie, named Linghui, styled [Yinhou Ju], who harmonizes the winter *qi* to store the myriad things. All are celestial perfected spirits of nature, thus called the Primordial Five Elders. They are not those who attain perfection through later study but receive their mandates by destiny, each governing a direction. Only when great kalpas cycle anew do their positions change.\n\nMyriad chariots and ten thousand riders arrive floating through the void. The *Inner Meaning* states: The Ten Directions’ Great Spirits are the *qi* of the Dharma-body, the spirits that govern *qi*. Yin and yang intermingle and return, with myriad Dharma-images contained within—hence they \"together ride flying clouds, cinnabar chariots, and green carriages, with feathered canopies and jade wheels, drawn by a single vermilion phoenix and five-colored dark dragons.\" As for the nine-colored standards, they are the essence of yang; the ten mystic banners, the splendor of yin. The phoenixes ahead are yang, leading the song; the simurghs behind are yin, following in harmony. The lion is the king of beasts, symbolizing the heart; the crane is a spirit bird, embodying nature. Their resonant chanting and singing evoke a mind at ease and joyful.\n\nThe Five Elders leading the way represent the ancestral *qi* wondrously transforming into the Five Phases, flourishing and ascending. The hosts of immortals flanking the chariot poles represent the myriad spirits gathering around the Primordial Palace. The myriad chariots and ten thousand riders arriving through the void signify the Three Divisions and Eight Sceneries—yang souls and yin spirits, the twelve hundred forms and shadows, the twelve thousand luminous essences—all merging at once and returning to the Primordial Unity.\n\nTheir radiance pours forth, their chariots turn back. \"Pouring forth radiance\" refers to the flowing essence of jade light, mutually illuminating and resplendent. \"Turning back the chariots\" refers to the flying clouds and wheel hubs revolving around the Dharma-throne. They oversee the perfection of beings and deliver the living. The Ten Directions’ exalted sages assemble at the Emperor’s abode to supervise the hosts of perfected ones and deliver the multitudes of beings.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: \"Pouring forth radiance and turning back the chariots\" symbolize the completion of the *kan*-*li* hexagrams, the image of yin and yang in harmonious union. As yang ascends and yin follows, they converge in the cauldron chamber. Creation gathers and contracts, the two *qi* merge—this is what was previously called \"the spirits governing *qi*, yin and yang intermingling, Dharma-images all contained.\" The two *qi* are the yin and yang of *kan* and *li*. The yang line within *kan* descends to join the yin line within *li*, causing the yang light to pour downward—hence \"pouring forth radiance.\" Yin follows yang’s ascent, like a chariot bearing its load. Inner yin seeks to gather outer yang, while outer yang yearns for inner yin. Yin and yang intermingle—hence \"turning back the chariots.\" Through this, the purest essence is stirred, the hosts of yang flow unimpeded, the upright *qi* flourishes, and true spirits transform and arise—hence \"overseeing the perfection of beings and delivering the living.\"\n\nThe Prime Ministers of the Heavens and the Upper Palace of Southern Prosperity—*qi* of ministers and *qi* of chancellors, capable of establishing creation. The Prime Ministers are the divine lords of the Great Luo Heaven. The Upper Palace of Southern Prosperity is the Vermilion Numinous Palace, located within the Heaven of Crimson Clarity and Harmonious Yang.\n\nHan, the Controller of Records, and the Great Spirit of Life-Monitoring—Han the Controller is the Deity of Destiny, overseeing the records of those who receive refinement and deliverance. The Great Spirit of Life-Monitoring governs the deliverance of souls from the Nine Dark Realms.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: Inwardly, this symbolizes the *qi* of the Dharma-body’s Great Brahma, the wondrous transforming *qi* of arising and flourishing. Though the true spirit dwells within the chamber, without this *qi*, nothing could come into being.\n\nHolding records and grasping registers, they arrive together before the Emperor. The *Inner Meaning* states: Records and registers document merits and transgressions. When the deities who govern the heavens and preside over all assemble with the ritual officers before the August Heavenly Worthy of the Void, it is to assess merits, measure blessings, and universally deliver humans and gods.\n\nThis symbolizes the *qi* of wondrous transformation returning to the spirit chamber, embodying the principle of nurturing life and transformation. Before the Great Void, what was there in the boundless silence? Once the ancestral *qi* divided, yin and yang separated. At the dawn of primordial chaos, darkness was without trace. After the Three Powers were established, documents and records arose. Manifesting benevolence, they become records and registers; concealed in function, they become yin and yang. Without records and registers in the hidden and manifest realms, how could merits and transgressions be recorded? Without yin and yang in heaven and earth, how could creation be accomplished?\n\nYin and yang are the functions of the cinnabar Dao. Though their names diverge when analyzed, they cannot be fully enumerated. Briefly speaking, their dynamic interplay is called Dragon and Tiger; their medicinal forms, Mercury and Cinnabar; their transformative mechanism, *Kan* and *Li*; their ascent and descent, Water and Fire. Schools name them differently—seek them by their categories.\n\nThe preceding refers to the Central Palace’s spirit chamber, where yin and yang are the wondrous functions of the Golden Elixir. The spirit chamber is the pivot of the Golden Elixir, the Emperor’s domain where all within the Four Seas pay tribute, converging like spokes toward the hub.\n\nWhere the spirit abides, the myriad qi respond and attach, all coalescing without exception. The spirit serves as the sovereign qi, while the spirits of the ministers dwell within the chamber—here, the myriad qi gather as one. Thus it is said: holding the records and ledgers, all arrive in unison before the Emperor.\n\nMaster Zhang the Perfected states: Those who refine the Elixir must thoroughly comprehend yin and yang and profoundly grasp the workings of creation. Only then can they pursue the two qi along the Yellow Path and unite the three natures within the Primordial Palace. They assemble the Five Agents, harmonize the Four Images, where Dragon intones and Tiger roars, husband leads and wife follows, the Jade Crucible simmers, and the Golden Furnace blazes with fire. The Mysterious Pearl takes form, and the Great One returns to truth.\n\nFrom this perspective, the essence of the Returned Elixir lies in nothing beyond yin and yang, which originate from the Dao. The Dao gives birth to the One, the One to the Two, the Two to the Three, and the Three to the myriad things. As *The Awakening to Reality* states: \"The Dao arises from emptiness and generates the One qi; from this One qi, yin and yang emerge. Yin and yang recombine to form the Three Bodies, and from these Three Bodies, the myriad things flourish.\"\n\nThe Elixir, then, is cultivated by following the patterns of creation. All other countless names and boundless wondrous meanings arise from yin and yang, like a ball rolling upon a tray—whether traversing horizontally or vertically, its true nature remains unfathomable, yet never leaves the confines of the tray.\n\nThose who fail to embody creation’s patterns or follow yin and yang, though they may possess essential and subtle teachings, practice only peripheral and minor methods. How can these compare to the Golden Elixir?\n\nYet those who cultivate the Elixir must first reform their faults and uphold precepts to guard against transgressions. Above all, they must abandon deceit, still their scheming, purify their minds, and diminish desires. If cunning and calculation stir within, the spirit becomes disordered and qi muddled; the qi and signs within the body no longer align with heaven and earth, and the medicine cannot be gathered. If external attachments to sounds, forms, and desires persist, the spirit scatters and qi dissipates; inner and outer creation fail to interact, and the Crucible cannot be formed.\n\nThose who aspire to this path yet cannot relinquish these hindrances are like one who walks backward while seeking to advance. Alas! Worldly people chase the trivial and forget the fundamental, devaluing life and treating the body with disregard.\n\nThe heroic and the bold are enslaved by their pursuit of merit, fame, and career; the wise and the exceptional are lured by ambition, advancement, and wealth. Those with ample clothing and food are bewildered by schemes and calculations; the poor and destitute are tormented by the burdens of mere survival. Even those who stand apart from the world, delighting only in ease and comfort, mistakenly call this \"purity and non-action.\" All these miss the truth before their very eyes, forgetting Zhang Pingshu’s words: \"A man of resolve, if he cultivates the Elixir, may do so whether in the marketplace or at court.\"\n\nIf worldly people could take up this Way as their own task, setting aside distractions even for a brief moment each day, practicing diligently without retreat, they would surely see results. In all their interactions with the world, if they never forget to turn their light inward and return to reflection, the radiance of the Golden Elixir will ever shine brightly. Even if they have not yet forged it into a single whole, this is still a path of peace and joy, prolonging life and extending years, free from the turning of karma.\n\nIf one’s resolve is firm, the Dao will not fail them. As Immortal Zhongli Quan said: \"If Heaven were to betray those of Daoist heart, it would make my three disciples into lowly ghosts.\" Could an immortal speak falsely?\n\nThe Scripture says: \"Those who engage with the Dao become one with the Dao; those who engage with virtue become one with virtue; those who engage with loss become one with loss. Those who become one with the Dao, the Dao delights in obtaining them; those who become one with virtue, virtue delights in obtaining them; those who become one with loss, loss delights in obtaining them. Where trust is insufficient, there will be distrust.\"\n\nAs for the subtle mechanisms of the Dao, I dare not lightly disclose them, but I shall slightly open the path to guide those who come after. The Song of Master Ge the Immortal says:\n\n*Flowing Pearl, Flowing Pearl,*\n*You enslave my humble self.*\n*I roam the four seas, traverse ten thousand texts,*\n*Burn gold and stone to ash, boil mercury to naught.*\n*Seeking in vain, my thoughts grow dull.*\n*By the Master’s transmission, primal qi arises from emptiness,*\n*Dwelling in the dim and indistinct, abiding in the vague and fleeting.*\n*True yin and true yang, one inhalation, one exhalation.*\n*First visualize the Golden Crucible, then prepare the Jade Furnace.*\n*Stir the Fire of Li, model the Water of Kan.*\n*Jade liquid irrigates, the Grotto Chamber flows with butter.*\n*The Immortal delivers men—only the great of heart may grasp this.*\n*Hold fast to this, remember these words.*\n\nImmortal Peng says:\n*The Supreme Dao is subtle, rare, and profound;*\n*To refine the Elixir, first recognize the Great Returning Mind.*\n*The sun’s hexagram, yin paired, births true mercury;*\n*The moon’s trigram, yang odd, produces true gold.*\n*The woman conceives cinnabar, the man nurtures snow;*\n*Gui conceals fire, Bing contains Ren.*\n*At the two ends lies the lead, the ancestor of metals—*\n*Do not seek it haphazardly among the myriad things.*\n\nMaster Xu of the Heavenly Teacher says:\n*If the spirit departs, recall it swiftly;*\n*When the spirit returns to the body, qi follows of itself.*\n*Thus morning and evening, day after day,*\n*The true embryo of the Red Child naturally takes form.*\n\nThe *Song of the Original Dao* by Fuqiu Bo says:\n*The tiger lies low, the dragon too hides;*\n*The dragon hides only after the tiger submits.*\n*Simply complete the work of the River Chariot,*\n*No need for barriers or resistance.*\n*Those who seek to become flying immortals*\n*Wander in madness, unable to abide.*\n*Left and right, they find lord and minister;*\n*The Four Agents guard and protect one another.*\n*The law and image of Qian and Kun are fulfilled—*\n*Of itself, the True Person attends.*\n\nThough I have not revealed the subtle mechanisms, the essentials are already contained within these songs and poems. If one of resolve studies them, they will surely grasp the truth. This is what Heaven has bestowed.\n\n[580/3] According to the measure of those to be delivered, the heavens are strictly examined. According to the weight of merit, the heavens open the path to deliverance, strictly examining all, that none be lost.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The Way of the Golden Elixir differs from other arts. Once attained, it is attained forever; reward follows merit. Ten parts effort yield ten parts reward; if one’s work is flawed, so too is the recompense. Yet what is cultivated is most secret, without sound or scent, yet the vast and distant realm of Great Luo, the boundless and empty expanse, is connected to all, reaching all. Strictly examined and recorded, not a hair’s breadth is omitted. If one practices with diligence and unwavering perseverance, they will surely ascend beyond the world.\n\nThe above is the preface and exposition of the Jade Dawn Dao Lord.\n\nA universal proclamation to the Three Realms and the Boundless Divine Realm:\nThe Three Realms are the Realm of Desire, the Realm of Form, and the Formless Realm. The Boundless refers to the ten directions of the infinite worlds.\n\nThe winding springs of the underworld, the Northern Capital of Fengdu:\nIn the far north below lies a great sea, foul and black, its bounds unfathomable. Within it stands a mountain, a hundred and six thousand miles high, its summit piercing the azure heavens, its base descending into the windy springs—this is the Northern Capital of Fengdu Mountain. Near the water’s surface lies a great cavern, called the Heavenly Palace of Yin Shadows, thirty-six thousand miles in circumference, containing thirty-seven hells. The lord of this cavern is the Heavenly Lord of Great Yin. Above the mountain are six other caverns, each ruled by a great demon, forming the Six Bureaus under the Heavenly Lord of Great Yin, with a combined host of three hundred and sixty thousand officials.\n\nThe first cavern is the Heavenly Palace of Zhou’s Absolute Yin; the second, the Heavenly Palace of Tai’s Lethal Judgment; the third, the Heavenly Palace of Mingchen’s Enduring Offense; the fourth, the Heavenly Palace of Tianzhao’s Sinful Qi; the fifth, the Heavenly Palace of Zongling’s Seven Transgressions; the sixth, the Heavenly Palace of Gansi’s Continuous Torment. If one can hold the names of these six palaces in reverence and awe, the demon kings will vouch for them, erasing their sins, sparing them from life and death, and granting boundless blessings. This Fengdu lies in the northernmost Gui region beyond heaven and earth.\n\nThe Three Offices and Nine Bureaus:\nThe Three Offices are the Offices of Heaven, Earth, and Water. Each office has three bureaus, hence the Nine Bureaus. The Upper Primordial Office of Heaven, under the Jade Pure Realm, establishes the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, with thirty-six departments. The officials are all formed from the qi of spontaneity, governing all. The Supreme Perfected of the Jade Void, the High Sovereign Emperor, the Lords of the Heavens, the Great Saints and Divine Ones, the thousand Perfected who have attained the Dao, along with the records of the lives of men and women, and the registers of blessings and sins of the hundred clans—both those who have attained the Dao and those who have not—are all under their purview.\n\nThe Middle Primordial Office of Earth, under the Supreme Clarity Realm, establishes three palaces, nine bureaus, and forty-two departments. Its officials are all the souls of the deceased who have accumulated merit and virtue, receiving deliverance to assume their posts, each with a set term. When their merit is fulfilled and virtue perfected, they ascend to become celestial officials of the Heavenly Bureaus. Those whose merit remains unfulfilled are reborn among men.\n\nThe Central Palace governs the Five Emperors and Five Sacred Peaks, all Perfected Ones, all earth deities, and those immortals who have attained the Dao. The Left Palace oversees the nine lands of the earth, the Earth Sovereign, the spirits of the eight directions, and the registers of human lives. The Right Palace governs all earthly spirit-officials.\n\nThe Lower Primordial Office of Water, under the Grand Clarity Realm, likewise establishes three palaces, nine bureaus, and forty-two departments, with officials identical in nature to those of the Middle Primordial. These are the souls of the meritorious deceased, who supplement the Central Palace. They collectively govern the Water Emperor, the Divine Kings of Yang Valley, the Nine River Water Bureaus, the River Earls, the great spirits of the waters, and the registers of immortals. The Left Palace presides over the myriad water spirits—dragons, jiao-serpents, whales, and salamanders—along with the cycles of deliverance at the Dragon Gate and the Water Mother, as well as the records of human lives, deaths, merits, and transgressions. The Right Palace governs the refined souls and myriad spirits dwelling within the waters. The details are recorded in the *Scripture of the Three Primordials’ Precepts and Commandments*.\n\nThe Twelve River Sources:\nThe Twelve River Sources are the moon, the essence of Great Yin and mother of all waters. Wells are the sources of the Celestial River and the springs of all waters. Each month, the moon completes a circuit of the heavens, and over twelve months, it passes through the Eastern Well, irrigating the Yellow Blossoms and bathing the countenances of the celestial beings. This dissolves the bonds of ancestors and parents across countless kalpas. Whenever the Three Offices conduct their reviews, if descendants have accrued great merit, the Jade Emperor immediately delivers their distant forebears, swiftly erasing their names from the ledgers of sins and extinguishing the roots of evil.\n\nThe \"roots of evil\" refer to the fundamental nature of wicked thoughts, which persist even after death and must be scoured through refinement and deliverance. They are not to be detained or forced into the company of ghosts.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: In terms of the body, the Three Fields correspond to the Three Realms. From the Mud Pill Palace above to the Bubbling Spring below lies the boundless divine homeland. The large and small intestines are the winding palaces of the springs, while below the kidneys lies the Northern Capital of Fengdu. The Three Corpses and Nine Worms are the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, and the twelve meridians are the Twelve River Sources. As described above, each of these places has its own deities. The *Yellow Court* and *Great Cavern* scriptures provide thorough explanations. However, all these spirits are post-celestial entities, disturbed by the competition of flowers and obscured by desires, sinking into turbidity and stagnation, unable to attain clarity. They are like one’s deceased ancestors, bound in the dark yin realms, unable to achieve deliverance.\n\nFor those who cultivate refinement, the myriad qi converge at the Gate of Life, and the hundred spirits guard the Door of Death. They swiftly transcend the dusty realm, awakening to non-action, avoiding entanglement and the descent into bitter destinies.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning’s Mandate ensures promotion at every moment. The Cold Pool of the Northern Capital protects and escorts the forms and souls. Demons are subdued, and merits are vouched for, delivering beings to the Southern Palace for refinement. Deceased souls undergo refinement and are transformed into immortals. Those who receive deliverance in life endure across kalpas. As kalpas turn, they share the same lifespan as heaven. They forever escape the Three Paths, Five Sufferings, and Eight Difficulties, transcending the Three Realms and roaming freely in the Supreme Clarity.\n\nThis refers to the Primordial Beginning’s descending decree, the Northern Emperor’s escort, the proclamation to restrain the dark souls, the demon kings’ guarantee of deliverance, and the Southern Palace’s refinement and rebirth. If a deceased soul had merit and virtue in life, their form and spirit temporarily perish, and their ghostly essence undergoes refinement and immortal transformation. If they lacked merit, upon encountering the assembly, they receive refinement and are reborn in the human realm. Those who cultivate to the point of scriptural mastery receive deliverance in life and endure across kalpas. Even if the roots of life and death remain unsevered, they do not lose their human form across kalpas. Once they comprehend this cause and nurture the roots of goodness to maturity, they forever escape the Three Paths, Five Sufferings, and Eight Difficulties, transcending the Three Realms and roaming freely in the Supreme Clarity.\n\nThe Three Paths are:\n1. The Gate of Sensual Desire, the path of the Upper Corpse leading to the celestial realm of servitude.\n2. The Gate of Attachment, the path of the Middle Corpse leading to the human realm of servitude.\n3. The Gate of Greed, the path of the Lower Corpse leading to the earthly realm of servitude.\n\nThese are called the Three Evils, obstructing the path to immortal study.\n\nThe Five Sufferings are:\n1. The suffering of sensory entanglements afflicting the heart, known as the Hell of Mount Tai.\n2. The suffering of emotional attachments afflicting the spirit, known as the Wind and Blade Hell.\n3. The suffering of greed afflicting the body, known as the Hell of Carrying Stones and Mountains.\n4. The suffering of floral competition afflicting the essence, known as the Hell of Filling the Sea to Make Rivers.\n5. The suffering of bodily burdens afflicting the soul, known as the Hell of Swallowing Fire, Eating Coals, and Boiling Cauldrons.\n\nThe Three Paths and Five Sufferings together constitute the Eight Difficulties, encompassing all eight kinds of hardship.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The Primordial Beginning’s Mandate is the primordial ancestral qi. This qi emerges from yin and enters yang, ascending and transforming at every moment. At the zi hour, a single yang arises in the Kun Palace, forming the hexagram *Fu* (Return), born of the ancestral qi of the one yang. Qian begins beneath the six yielding lines of Kun, transforming one line into firmness, with yang qi taking charge and gradually ascending. Thus, it is called the Primordial Beginning’s Mandate, promoting at every moment.\n\nThe Cold Pool of the Northern Capital lies beneath the five yin. It protects and escorts the forms and souls. As the one yang ascends, the yang qi rises. By the si hour, it reaches the Li Palace, where the six yin transform into pure Qian. Thus, demons are subdued, merits are vouched for, and beings are delivered to the Southern Palace for refinement. Deceased souls undergo refinement in pure yin, transforming into immortals in pure yang.\n\nThose who receive deliverance in life possess the primordial one qi, which attaches to the parents’ union at the moment of conception, giving rise to this body. Hence, it is called \"receiving deliverance in life.\" After gaining consciousness, once the passions awaken, the primordial qi is gradually lost, leading to old age and death. The wise and determined act otherwise: they restore their nature, return to their origin, master the subtleties of creation, and operate the wondrous principles of yin and yang. This is akin to yang reaching its peak at si and yin beginning to arise at wu.\n\nBeneath the six firm yang lines, a single yielding line transforms, and yin qi takes effect, gradually descending to gather within the Central Palace, where the divine maiden and numinous youth conjoin yin and yang in the chamber of spirit. Soaring dragons and crouching tigers unite hun and po within the womb of the mother—thus is it called \"receiving deliverance.\" \"Kalpa upon kalpa\" signifies day after day. As yang ascends and yin descends, life returns to its root, wondrous transformations endless, cycling without cease—hence \"abiding kalpa upon kalpa.\" Now yang is exhausted above yet reborn below, circulating without end, accompanying the body from beginning to end—thus \"revolving with the kalpa’s wheel, matching heaven’s years.\" Through unceasing practice and flawless fire timing, both form and spirit attain perfection, merging with the Dao in truth—thus \"forever transcending the three paths, five sufferings, and eight difficulties, ascending beyond the three realms, and roaming freely in the Shangqing.\"\n\nThe heavens of Shangqing, where the Heavenly Emperor of Jade Perfection dwells in the primal-hued radiance of pure conduct. The *Inner Meaning* states: Xue Youqi says: The Heavenly Emperor of the Shangqing heavens refers to the thirty-six Heavenly Emperors. The most exalted among them, whose Dao equals that of the Primordial Beginning and whose rank is arrayed in the Jade Purity, is called the Jade Perfection. These are the thirty-six heavens below Shangqing, distinct from the thirty-two heavens. Possessing radiance yet devoid of color, hence it is called \"pure conduct.\" Pure conduct is the Dao within the Dao, the heaven within heaven, entering and exiting without obstruction, true emptiness without hindrance.\n\nFrom the inner perspective, when the elixir is perfected, it assumes the image of pure yang qian metal. Qian employs the nine of metal, and the number four times nine is thirty-six. The Dao equals that of the Primordial Beginning—all is one qi. Ranked among the Jade Purity—wondrous unity pervades all. When metal returns to the origin of nature, one attains radiance without color. At this stage of returning the elixir, all yin is exhausted, the yang body is wholly complete, and the heart-mind shines with clarity, ascending into the mysterious and entering the wondrous, like the limpid azure of autumn skies or the still depths of a cold pool. The slightest deviation would blind the eye—how then could one attain the colorless radiance of pure conduct?\n\nThe Heavenly Emperor of Taihuang Huangzeng Heaven: Yulan Yuming.

The correct intonation: \"Eternal Mystery, Ninefold Life—Heavenly Qi of Blue-Green, linked to the Straddling Mansion.\"\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: These jade names and jade intonations of the various heavens are all inscribed in azure script upon red crystal jade and concealed within the Supreme Clarity Palace. Those who hold this scripture may not request to read or recite them.\n\nAmong the thirty-two heavens, the lifespans of their inhabitants are fixed by number. For instance, the people of Huangzeng Heaven live nine million years, and from this point upward, each heaven’s lifespan doubles in succession. Thus, the people of Taiming Yuwan Heaven live eighteen million years. Doubling again, the people of Hetong Heaven live thirty-six million years. Continuing this doubling, the people of Xiule Jin Shang Heaven live 1,207,795,712 million years.\n\nThese twenty-eight heavens constitute the Three Realms: the Realm of Desire, the Realm of Form, and the Formless Realm. The Realm of Desire is the lower realm. It comprises six heavens, from Huangzeng to the Seven Luminaries Heaven. The inhabitants of these heavens possess form and desire, clinging to sensory attachments. In the first two heavens, desire is expressed through bodily union; in the next two, through hand-holding; in the fifth heaven, through speech; and in the sixth, through gaze. As they engage in carnal desire, procreating through sexual union, and giving birth to offspring, this is called the Realm of Desire. When one sense-root is purified, one ascends to the next heaven; when all six sense-roots are purified, one enters the Realm of Form.\n\nThe Realm of Form is the middle realm. It comprises eighteen heavens, from Yueheng Heaven to Tanshi Heaven. The inhabitants of these heavens possess form but no desire, though they are subject to six colors and eighteen dusts—six coarse dusts, six fine dusts, and six subtle dusts. When one coarse dust is purified, one ascends to the next heaven; when all six coarse dusts are purified, one advances six heavens. Likewise, for the six fine dusts, purifying one fine dust allows ascent to the next heaven, and purifying all six fine dusts advances one six heavens further. For the six subtle dusts, purifying one subtle dust allows ascent to the next heaven, and purifying all six subtle dusts elevates one into the Formless Realm.\n\nThe Formless Realm is the upper realm. It comprises four heavens, from Haoting to Xiule Heaven. The *Code of Supreme Perfection* states: Within the Formless Realm, the perfected are without emotion, do not engage in sexual union, and their people are born through transformation. They subsist solely on fragrant qi, free from the afflictions of form and substance. Thus, with both form and desire extinguished, one cultivates to reach the first heaven, retaining only consciousness to merge with qi, contemplating qi and the Dao, and upon attainment, ascending to the next heaven. If consciousness still remains, one must relinquish it to attain non-action and ascend further. When all past causes are forgotten, consciousness abides in this heaven. Here, one does not entirely forget, so when action is required, there is response; when non-action is called for, there is emptiness. If one clings to either emptiness or existence, one loses the responsiveness within the true. For within emptiness lies the true, and within the true lies responsiveness—all phenomena arise from emptiness. The myriad dharmas reside in the mind, yet lack form or appearance. Guiding practitioners to contemplate the mind as neither existent nor non-existent, one ascends further. As the contemplation of qi becomes increasingly subtle, all habitual tendencies are forgotten, and one merges with spontaneity, ascending to the heaven of the Seed People.\n\nThe *Code of Supreme Perfection* states: Within the Formless Realm, the bodies of its inhabitants are wondrous and subtle, devoid of form or color. Some may be hundreds of feet tall, yet remain invisible to ordinary beings—only the perfected can perceive them. As they are without visible form, this is called the Formless Realm. However, the people of the Three Realms have not severed the root of birth and death, and the qi of yin and yang still lingers, binding them to numerical fate. Their lifespans are finite; they may ascend to higher realms or descend to the human world, their rebirth determined by the measure of their merit, endlessly revolving. Only those who attain the Dao transcend this cycle, reaching the ever-harmonious Pingyu Heaven—the Four Seed-People Heavens, where lifespans also double in succession.\n\nOne account states: The people of these four heavens exist beyond the dual qi, unbound by limits of years or lifespan, abiding in joy and purity. Thus, the *Sutra of the Fundamental Limit* says: \"When habitual tendencies are exhausted, one transcends the station of the Seed People.\" Here, *knots* refer to afflictions, and *habits* to the fruits of study.\n\nThe *Code of Supreme Perfection* states: Ascending through the four heavens, one merges with the realm of the Dao, rising and falling with the qi, untouched by calamity. The qi of the thirty-two heavens and their corresponding stellar lodges are recorded in the *Scripture of Cavernous Spirit*. The lifespans of their inhabitants and the purification of sense-roots and dusts are found in the *Scripture of the Dragon’s Ascent*. Other details appear in the commentaries of Li Shaowei and Cheng Xuanying.\n\nNumbers begin with the primordial qi: the Dao generates the One, and the Supreme Ultimate generates the Two Modes. Once bound to number, there must be an end—this is why escape from birth and death is so difficult. The lifespans of heavenly beings can be calculated because they are bound to number, and thus cannot avoid the cycles of rebirth and descent. Hence, Master Fu said: \"Though one endures for a hundred thousand kalpas, one ultimately falls into emptiness and annihilation.\" The Buddhists refer to the ten kinds of immortals as such. These are the lesser vehicles of conditioned action, akin to the Pratyekabuddhas and Śrāvakas, for they have not yet attained the purity of non-action. But those who refine the Golden Elixir merge with emptiness and unite with the formless; both form and spirit become wondrous, transcending the bounds of qi and number. How could birth, death, lifespan, or form confine them?\n\nXue Youqi said: The thirty-two heavens of the four directions refer to the Four Brahma Heavens. The Heavenly Emperors are supremely exalted, their forms distinct yet ephemeral, like empty space. They move without obstruction, unobstructed by phenomena.\n\nI, Jing, note that the scriptures say: In the primordial kalpa of the Original Beginning, all heavens were transformed from the primordial qi. Thus, the thirty-two heavens are all manifestations of a single qi. The practice of the Returned Elixir originates from this primordial qi. When merit is perfected and the Dao attained, one becomes empty and traceless, just as the Heavenly Emperors, though possessing true forms, are like empty space.\n\nYet the secret talismanic names of the heavens serve as contracts to deliver souls from suffering, while the return of primordial qi to its origin to form the Elixir can liberate the mortal frame. Though the methods differ, the Dao is the same; though the merits vary, the principle is one.\n\nThe foregoing main text was spoken by the Most High Lord of the Original Beginning.\n\nThe thirty-two heavens, thirty-two emperors, the hidden names and secret appellations of the heavens, the empty void within the heavens, the spontaneous numinous scriptures—these are the hidden melodies of the heavens, the sounds within the heavens, the exalted ones within the heavens, the spirits within the heavens, the great demons within the heavens, the numina within the heavens. Nine harmonies and ten unions transform and ascend to the Upper Clarity. Their boundless mysteries are too profound to fathom. They spread forth the divine perfected to universally deliver heaven and humanity.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The hidden names and secret appellations of the heavens and emperors, the numinous scriptures and melodies, the divine, exalted, demonic, and numinous—these symbolize the single qi transformed into the various names of lead, silver, cinnabar, mercury, dragon, tiger, water, fire, and the Elixir. The nine harmonies and ten unions refer to the intertwining of yin and yang, mutually engendering and completing one another. Their transformation to ascend to the Upper Clarity occurs when yang reaches its zenith in *qian* and yin arises at *wu*. Creation leaves no trace; yin and yang have no beginning. Even the Jade Dawn Lord of the Dao has said: \"Their boundless mysteries are too profound to fathom.\" How much more so for those of shallow learning!\n\nGuan Ling once said: It is like the great sea, which can transform into countless dragons and fish, yet is but a single water. I and all things, flourishing and lush, exist within the great transformation—our natures are but one. From this perspective, the mechanism of creation may be glimpsed. Thus, by delving into the profound subtleties of the scriptures and the Dao, adhering to the wondrous principle of return, investigating the medicinal substances, and recognizing the foundation of the Elixir, one clarifies the workings of lead, silver, cinnabar, and mercury, and employs the functions of the sun and moon, yin and yang. The aim is to achieve long life and transcend the world, enter sagehood and ascend to perfected being, transmit the true essence, and benefit both self and others—this is what is meant by \"spreading forth the divine perfected to universally deliver heaven and humanity.\"\n\nThe foregoing main text was composed by the Jade Dawn Lord of the Dao.\n\nToday is the joyous occasion of receiving deliverance, passing through the barriers of the heavens—today refers to the day when the Original Beginning transmitted the scriptures to the Lord of the Dao. \"Pleasing the eradication of the three evils\" refers to the three paths of suffering. \"Severing the roots of the earth\" refers to hell. \"Flying past the five gates\" refers to the five sufferings. \"Named among the Supreme Mystery\" refers to the Mysterious Capital. The demon kings oversee and raise up, and the gates of heaven impose no restraints.\n\nThe *Heaven-Ascending Contract from the Wondrous Spirit Scripture* is the sixty-eighth character in the *August Writ of Humanity*, worn as a pure white sash on the body. On the day a Daoist ascends to heaven, if the Five Marchmounts do not see this contract, they will detain the soul and prevent it from ascending together. If the Jiang, He, Huai, and seas do not see this contract, they will retain the blood and fluids and prevent them from ascending together. If the Earth Bureau does not see this contract, it will detain the body and prevent ascension. If the Heaven Bureau does not see this contract, it will bar the gates of heaven and prevent advancement. The celestial gatekeepers demand the contract; upon obtaining it, one proceeds into the Purple Palace to meet the Great Lord of the Dao, after which all spirits dare not impose restraints.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: \"Today is the joyous occasion of receiving deliverance\" refers to the completion of the Elixir. When the Elixir is complete, the yang spirit gathers in the *qian* palace and directly ascends the Three Realms. The yin qi is stripped away at the *kun* gate, transcending the Five Phases—hence \"passing through the barriers of the heavens,\" \"pleasing the eradication of the three evils,\" \"severing the roots of the earth,\" \"flying past the five gates,\" and \"named among the Supreme Mystery.\" This occurs when the sacred embryo is stored in the sea of marrow, demonic trials do not disturb it, spirits and numina offer their aid, the gates of heaven suddenly open, and a body exists beyond the body—this is what is meant by \"the demon kings oversee and raise up, and the gates of heaven impose no restraints.\"\n\nThe foregoing main text was spoken by the Most High Lord of the Original Beginning.\n\nThe Eastern Dipper governs destiny, the Western Dipper records names, the Northern Dipper decrees death, the Southern Dipper bestows life, and the Central Dipper, the Great Chief, oversees all spirits.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Eastern Dipper for Long Life and Protection of Destiny* states: The Eastern Dipper has five stars.\nThe *Scripture of the Western Dipper for Great Calculation and Protection of the Body* states: The Western Dipper has four stars.\nThe *Scripture of the Northern Dipper for Extension of Life Based on One’s Original Destiny* states: The Northern Dipper has seven stars.\nThe *Scripture of the Southern Dipper for Extending Lifespan and Delivering Humanity* states: The Southern Dipper has six stars.\nThe *Scripture of the Central Dipper, the Great Chief, for Calculating and Subduing Demons* states: The Central Dipper has three stars.\n\nSome identify the Eastern, Western, Southern, and Northern Dippers with the seven lunar lodges in the four directions, taking what is now called the Northern Dipper as the Central Dipper. They cite the *Treatise on the Celestial Offices* as evidence, which states: \"The Dipper is the emperor’s chariot, moving at the center to govern the four directions and observe portents.\" Since the people of the divine continent dwell south of the pole, when viewed from the north, it is called the Northern Dipper.\n\nThe *True One Oral Instructions* states: Within the Dipper itself are five dippers: Yang Brightness is the Eastern Dipper, Yin Essence is the Western Dipper, Cinnabar Prime is the Southern Dipper, the Northern Culmen is the Northern Dipper, and the Celestial Pass is the Central Dipper. The accounts differ, so both are preserved here.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: For those who have attained deliverance and completed the Elixir, the four Dippers govern their destiny, record their names, decree death, and bestow life. The Central Dipper oversees all these matters.\n\nThe Azure Emperor guards the hun-soul, the White Emperor attends the po-soul, the Vermilion Emperor nurtures qi, the Black Emperor circulates blood, and the Yellow Emperor presides at the center—none of the myriad spirits transcend them. The Azure Emperor’s surname is Chang, his personal name Jingming. The White Emperor’s surname is Hun, his personal name Rushou. The Vermilion Emperor’s surname is Yan, his personal name Dongdan. The Black Emperor’s surname is Xuan, his personal name Mingmeng. The Yellow Emperor’s surname is Ma, his personal name Zhonghui.\n\nThe Five Emperors in Heaven govern the flying immortals; on Earth, they are enthroned upon the Five Peaks, commanding ghosts and spirits; within humans, they govern the five viscera and their five spirits—the liver stores the hun-soul, the lungs store the po-soul, the heart stores qi, the kidneys store blood, while the spleen resides in the Central Palace, ruling over the flesh.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: For those who have attained deliverance and undergo rebirth in the womb, the Five Emperors descend with qi to transform and generate the five viscera, completing the Five Phases. For those who have completed the Elixir and attained eternal life, the Five Emperors descend with their spirits to merge with them, transcending the Five Phases.\n\nThe *Upper Clarity Comprehensive Record of the Five Emperors’ Numinous Communication* states: The Five Emperors coexist with Heaven and Earth. When yin and yang divided, they gave rise to the Five Phases. They condense the qi of spontaneity, feast in the Jasper Palace of Radiant Scenery, and wander through the Upper Clarity. They roam and observe the Eternal Yang and Primordial Origin, hastening the Five Phases to propel their movement, gathering later learners to replenish their authenticity. They oversee the registers of life and death, determining the allotted years of destiny.\n\nThe texts of the Five Emperors’ inner numinous communication arise within the Nine Mysteries, congealing the qi of Azure Yang to form jade script. They assist the Five Emperors, their divine radiance gleaming in the Purple Void, their flowing authenticity luxuriant in the Jade Clarity. The Five Phases merge and blend, illuminating the Jasper Palace with resplendent light. Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth transform and alternate, dividing their numinosity and dispersing their effulgence. They emerge from the profound and enter the subtle, penetrating the boundless. Their qi envelops Heaven and Earth, their essence pervades the Great Void. They can separate or unite, be yin or yang, ascend or descend, die or live, exist or vanish, fail or succeed. Contemplating this text exhausts the Dao of the Returned Elixir.\n\nThe Azure Heaven Demon King Bayuan Choubo, the Vermilion Heaven Demon King Futian Danshi, the White Heaven Demon King Fanshan Liumu, the Black Heaven Demon King Jianchou Langfu, and the Yellow Heaven Demon King Hengtian Danli—these are the Five Emperor Demon Kings. The first four are their titles, the middle two their personal names, and the last two their courtesy names. Some say they have different surnames and personal names, all clad in garments of dark script, wearing crowns that span the heavens, girded with swords bearing dragon-head hilts. They constantly ride feathered wheels, flying through the clouds, and often compose ballads of three thousand words to disrupt and corrupt later learners. The Most High thus recorded their songs in the *Scripture for Dispelling Demons*.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The old accounts claim that demon kings compose ballads to disrupt later learners. Upon reflection, this is not so. Demon kings do not deliberately corrupt learners but rather test them. The *Chapter on the Demon Kings of the Form Realm* says: \"My realm is difficult to cross, so I compose numinous texts, transforming and flying through the void to test your person. Many aspire to the Dao but lack steadfast faith, pursuing empty reputation without genuine practice. How could demon kings not test them? Those who pass the trial are protected and recommended to achieve perfection; those who fail and falter bear the fault of their own lack of resolve—what blame lies with the demon kings?\"\n\nThe Five Emperor Great Demons are the ancestors of the myriad spirits. These are distinct from the Five Heavenly Demon Kings, for beneath the Five Emperors there are Great Demon Kings with different names. They fly with drumming retinues, commanding ghostly legions, brandishing banners and beating drums, roaming the Great Void. They style themselves as resplendent, their merits equaling those of all heavens.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The *Hidden Book of Jade Clarity* says: The Five Emperor Demon Kings lead their officials and subordinates, born with Heaven, and constantly harass learners, unwilling for them to achieve the Dao. They even boast of equaling the sagely merits of the Heavenly Emperors. Later, during the Dragon Han era when the charts were revealed, they submitted to the transformation of the Primordial Beginning. Thus, the *Hymn of Pacing the Void* says: \"The demon kings respectfully receive their tasks, and thus can ascend to all heavens.\" From this, if learners hold fast to their original resolve, unwavering as an arrow shot forth, their Dao will flourish and their Elixir will be complete. Then the demon kings will respectfully serve them, turning to their aid—how could they dare to obstruct?\n\nHeaven delivers humanity, strictly governing the Northern Feng. The *Inner Meaning* states: The final chapter of the *Celestial Aerial Chant of the Desire Realm* says: \"Within the Northern Capital’s Winding Stream Prefecture dwell myriad ghosts, all seeking to obstruct human destiny and sever the Gate of Life.\" The perfected sing the *Cavernous Chapter* to govern the Northern Luo Feng, binding and dispatching demonic spirits, severing the blades of the Six Ghosts. The qi of all heavens surges, and my Dao daily ascends.\n\nFor the Northern Feng ghosts and spirits are charged with killing, delighting in obstructing destiny and cutting off life. When the Heavenly Worthy opens the path to deliverance, demon kings submit to transformation. Commanding and restraining the Ghost Emperor, proclaiming decrees to all passes and covenants, they issue orders to cease wanton cruelty. Thus, those who complete the Elixir are likewise protected.\n\nDivine Lords receive their mandate to universally sweep away inauspiciousness. The Eight Awes spew venom, the fierce steeds open their jaws to the four directions. The Divine Lord of the Great Luo Heaven commands the Five Emperor Great Demons to sweep away inauspiciousness and guard learners. The Eight Awesome Divine Dragons are the celestial numinous steeds of the earth. Heavenly Soldiers lead the vanguard, the Great Marshal wields the banner, hurling fire for ten thousand miles, with flowing bells in eight directions.\n\nWhen attaining deliverance and ascending, the Emperor decrees that the Great Marshal Divine Lord wield the banner to lead the way, with Heavenly Soldiers and the Fire Bell Generals to his left and right, just as in the case of the Wondrous Aid Lord Xu. Should any dare to test or obstruct the perfected, the golden axes will strike first, and the mighty Queen of the Rear will mete out punishment. Ghostly souls will be butchered, wind and fire unceasing. Thousands upon thousands will be decapitated, myriads upon myriads will have their forms severed. Demons will not dare to intrude, ghosts will have no malevolent spirits.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: When merit is complete and the Dao perfected, inner and outer align as one. The Three Officials and Northern Feng clearly inspect the ghostly camps.\n\nNo concealment shall be tolerated, the Golden Horse Post shall present the report. Universally proclaimed without end, all spirits shall heed. The Five Emperors of the Three Realms shall submit their declarations to the Highest Clarity.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the Northern Capital and Fengdu, are the offices that examine the sins of worldly beings. Those who have attained the Dao must consider their karmic entanglements from past lives, which may yet remain unresolved there. Perhaps their departed ancestors have fallen into its grasp, not yet granted pardon, their ascent obstructed. Thus, a thorough investigation is ordered: the ghostly camps’ records of sins, all grievances and transgressions, shall be entirely absolved. Let no delay be permitted; the post-horses shall present the report above, just as in the case of the Wondrous Aid Lord Xu, when the Emperor bestowed the register of merits and pardoned transgressions. This principle is proclaimed throughout the ten directions to all divine spirits, that all may hear and know. All shall act in accordance with the decree: the Five Emperors of the Three Realms, the great demons of the heavens, shall bear witness, submit their declarations, and swiftly memorialize the Highest Clarity.\n\nThe foregoing is the main text, the command bestowed by the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning, recorded by the Dao Lord.\n\nHere ends the third scroll of the *Inner Meaning of the Wondrous Scripture of the Upper Chapters on the Limitless Salvation of Beings*.\nBeginning of the fourth scroll of the *Inner Meaning of the Wondrous Scripture of the Upper Chapters on the Limitless Salvation of Beings*.\n\nGuan Fuzi Xiao Yingsou’s study of the *Primordial Cavern Jade Chronicle*:\n\nThis chapter discusses the formation and dissolution of kalpic cycles. According to the *Mysterious Record of Mount Gui*, the Celestial Worthy congealed the qi of the Primordial Cavern to compose the *Jade Chronicle*. The *Inner Meaning* states: The *Wondrous Transformation of the Supreme Ultimate, the Divine and Numinous Chaotic Crimson Writ* declares: \"The Nine Empyreans govern the universal recitation; the Eight Emperors rule the heavens. Without the Chaotic Crimson Writ, one cannot govern the Nine Yangs and illuminate the celestial measures.\" These Nine Empyreans and Nine Heavens are all transformed by the Chaotic Crimson Writ. Thus, the Crimson Writ transforms the Chaotic, and the Chaotic transforms the Infinite. Five kalpas unfold in this transformation.\n\nThe *Chapter of the Primordial Cavern Jade Chronicle* states: \"In ancient times, when the Primordial Chaos and the Great Brahma Infinite pervaded all, the myriad heavens were undivided, and the Nine Yangs merged in darkness. Through three causes and nine revolutions, six transformations and seven returns, the Primordial Beginning first took form, and the five kalpas commenced their transformation.\" Thereupon, the Dao Lord was commanded to record the celestial origin and govern the five kalpic cycles. Thus, the *Primordial Cavern* clarifies the ancestral qi, while the *Jade Chronicle* records the celestial origin. After five kalpic cycles, all returns to the One. Therefore, when the five kalpas are complete, the Vast Heaven assumes its form.\n\nFrom this, we infer that the Chaotic Crimson Writ is called the *Wondrous Transformation of the Supreme Ultimate*. The divine and numinous are the Dao of the primordial and spontaneous. The *Primordial Cavern* and *Jade Chronicle*, in their reference to the five kalpas of transformation, expound the principle of post-celestial cultivation and realization. Thus, Li Shaowei was correct in stating that this chapter discusses the formation and dissolution of kalpic cycles.\n\nIn terms of internal alchemy, the *Primordial Cavern* is the ancestral qi of the pre-celestial void, the empty qi and golden embryo. The *Jade Chronicle* is the qi congealed into form—our original countenance, the foundation of the elixir and the root of the medicine. It shares the same principle as the Chaotic Crimson Writ, hence the saying: \"The *Primordial Cavern* clarifies the ancestral qi; the *Jade Chronicle* records the celestial origin.\" The celestial origin is the root of humanity. Through this, one cultivates and realizes the true Dao.\n\n*Longhan* and *Yankang* are names of kalpas. *Long* signifies the numinous; *Han*, the great; *Yan*, the enduring; *Kang*, the peaceful. The *Inner Meaning* states: Yan Dongyun said, \"The primordial qi first congealed into the jade script, manifest in the *Longhan* kalpa, concealed in the *Yankang*, radiant in the *Crimson Clarity*, resplendent in the *Kaihuang*, and enduring through the *Shanghuang*.\"\n\nIn the *Longhan* kalpa, the jade script first appeared, akin to the initial infusion of qi at human birth. In the *Yankang* kalpa, the jade script receded into concealment, like the dissolution of the human body. In the *Crimson Clarity* kalpa, the chart unfolded, and the jade script shone anew, akin to human rebirth. In the *Kaihuang* and *Shanghuang* kalpas, the jade script blazed forth, like humanity’s sojourn in the world. This is what is meant by \"five kalpic cycles returning to the One; when the five kalpas are complete, the Vast Heaven assumes its form.\"\n\nHeaven and Earth regard the destruction of the Three Realms as a kalpa, while the human body regards death as a kalpa. Heaven and Earth have undergone countless cycles of formation and dissolution; the human body has passed through innumerable births and deaths. Yet the qi of the void and spontaneity endures through all kalpas. When a kalpa ends and the Three Realms are destroyed, the essences of the myriad beings abide in the Great Void. When a person ages and dies, the hundred bones wither and decay, yet the single spirit and true nature remain unchanged. The *Scripture of Western Ascension* states: \"From the beginningless past, the changes endured are as numerous as grains of sand. Each movement spans kalpas, and I reflect on the toil of this suffering. This is the root of birth and death, the rise and fall through the Six Paths, the unceasing wheel of suffering. Only the attainment of the Dao brings it to an end.\"\n\nIn the boundless kalpas, within the primordial chaos...\n\nThese two kalpas stretch vast and distant, their duration beyond reckoning, existing within the primordial chaos. Above, no color remains; below, no abyss persists.\n\nWith each kalpic cycle’s end, the Three Luminaries darken, heaven and earth merge into chaos—what color lingers above, what abyss below? The *Inner Meaning* states: The *Scripture of Yin Convergence* says, \"The Dao of heaven is established to stabilize humanity.\" The *Supreme Clarity Scripture* says: \"At the turning of the great kalpa, celestial qi is exhausted in the Supreme Yin, earthly qi reaches its limit in the Supreme Yang. When Yang is extreme, it erupts; when Yin is extreme, it stagnates. At Yang’s extremity, its essence transforms into water; at Yin’s extremity, its essence transforms into fire. First, great fire incinerates; next, great floods submerge—from the space below the Nine Heavens to the depths within the Nine Earths, not a hair’s end is spared. Then the primordial qi reunites, and this is called chaos. Chaos divides anew, just as in the initial kalpa. Such transformations, in sum, are called the separation and reunion of primordial qi.\"\n\nBefore the Dragon Han and Yan Kang eras, and before this body’s existence, who knows how many cycles of separation and reunion have occurred, returning to the empty vastness of no color and no abyss? The *Wind and Marsh* pervade the void; the *Vajra* rides the heavens. *Wind and Marsh* are the qi of the Dao. *Vajra* is the qi of essence. When the qi of the Dao is utterly yielding, it permeates the void; when the qi of essence is utterly firm, it courses through the heavens. The *Inner Meaning* says: Wind is qi without form; marsh is form without substance—this is the principle of spontaneity and voidness. Xue Youqi says: This is the qi of the Dao. The *Book of Changes* states: \"Wind above the marsh—*Zhong Fu*.\" As a hexagram, it is solid without and solid within, yet hollow at its core, symbolizing the void. The *Dao De Jing* says: \"Between heaven and earth, is it not like a bellows? Empty yet inexhaustible, the more it moves, the more it produces.\" Thus it can comply with all things, creating and transforming the myriad beings. Hence it is said: \"Persuade and yield, and the state is transformed.\" The *Mao Robe* says: *Zhong Fu* is the principle of initial generation. Is not the qi of the Dao the principle of initial generation?\n\n*Gold* endures unchanged through the ages; *firmness* remains unbroken in its integrity. This is the pure, wondrous essence. Xue says: This is the qi of essence, which accords with the Qian Dao. Qian, with its six yang lines, when inverted or reversed, remains unchanged in its nature. Possessing all four virtues, the myriad beings flourish and mature through it. The *Mao Robe* says: Qian is the pivot of creation. Is not the qi of essence the pivot of creation?\n\nThese two—what the *Dao De Jing* calls \"dimly, dimly, within it there are images; vaguely, vaguely, within it there is something; obscurely, profoundly, within it there is essence. Its essence is utterly real, within it there is sincerity\"—from ancient times to the present, their name has never faded. This is the wondrous existence of the human spirit.\n\nWhen kalpic cycles transform and the Three Realms dissolve, above the seed-people all remains serene and unmoving. Thus this qi, with its wondrous pervasion of the void, rides the indestructible heavens, divides and unfolds the cosmic chart, and establishes the Three Realms—just as the human spirit, once more encased in the womb, gives rise to a body. This qi is the foundation of golden elixir and returning cinnabar.\n\nAbove heaven and below heaven, there is no darkness, no obscurity, no form, no shadow, no limit, no end. It is said that above and below heaven cannot be observed or measured, for it is self-so and naturally independent. The *Inner Meaning* says: It is like a person’s death, where the body perishes but the true nature alone endures. The *Dao De Jing* states: \"Looked at but not seen—it is called *Yi*; listened to but not heard—it is called *Xi*; grasped but not obtained—it is called *Wei*.\" Thus it is said: no darkness, no obscurity, no form, no shadow, no limit, no end. It cannot be questioned or fathomed, and so it merges into oneness—this is called the *Great Conduct of Brahman Qi*.\n\nAfter the kalpa’s dissolution, only the vast Brahman qi remains, boundless and lightless. The *Inner Meaning* says: Zhang Ziping’s *Ling Xian* states: \"Before the Great Simplicity, within it was only emptiness; within that emptiness was only nothingness.\" This is called the root of the Dao in the primordial chaos. The Mysterious Master says: Humans are born from the vast Brahman and die into the vast Brahman. The vast Brahman is the qi of spontaneity, the undifferentiated chaos. At the moment of parents’ union, this qi suddenly attaches and forms the embryo—crudely named *spirit*. This is detailed in the annotations to the *Red Text of the Chaotic Abyss*. From this, life arises.\n\nThe boundless darkness without light is the undivided chaos, where Yin and Yang are pent up, the sun and moon extinguished, and heaven and earth plunged into gloom—like a person in the mother’s womb, not yet born into the world. When it moves, it dies. Thus *Zhuangzi* says: \"The Lord of the Southern Sea was Shu, the Lord of the Northern Sea was Hu, and the Lord of the Center was Hundun. Shu and Hu often met in Hundun’s land, and Hundun treated them very well. Shu and Hu plotted to repay Hundun’s kindness, saying: 'All people have seven orifices for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing—only this one has none. Let us try to bore them.' Each day they bored one orifice, and on the seventh day Hundun died.\" The commentary says: Shu represents form; Hu represents formlessness. Hundun is the undifferentiated clarity and turbidity, symbolizing spontaneity. To bore it is to violate spontaneity, forcibly opening ears and eyes. This metaphor illustrates how the seven emotions, once aroused, scatter the ancestral qi of the vast Brahman, leading to decay and death—this is what is meant by \"from this, death arises.\"\n\nThe *Red Clarity* unfolds the cosmic chart, and the kalpa’s course proceeds naturally.\n\nIn the midst of the Era of Extended Prosperity, the Primordial Beginning inaugurated the course of the Red Clarity, unfurling the resplendence of the cosmic chart and tally, and setting in motion the measured division of yin and yang. Thus, this kalpa came to be called the Kalpa of Red Clarity.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The Red Clarity marks the rekindling of yang qi following the dissolution of a kalpa, establishing the name of this new epoch. The \"unfurling of the chart\" signifies the re-establishment of the kalpic cycle, wherein the Heavenly Worthy unfolds the cosmic chart and tally, naturally setting the Dao’s course in motion. The \"chart and tally\" refer to the *Chaotic Cavern’s Crimson Script* and the *Primordial Cavern’s Jade Calendar*. Thereupon, Heaven and Earth took form, the sun and moon shone brightly, all beings followed their nature, and the myriad things were nurtured and reared.\n\nSpeaking of humans: emerging from the mother’s womb marks the beginning of this kalpic cycle. The stirring of innate nature and consciousness embodies the principle of the \"unfurling of the chart.\" Speech and sight, scent and hearing, grasping hands and walking feet, a lucid mind and discerning intent—these are the natural course of the Dao’s motion. Yet the foolish fall short, the wise exceed, and thus lose the mean, forfeiting the Dao of spontaneity.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning, securely enthroned, disseminated the Five Scriptures. The crimson writings on jade tablets heralded the rekindling of the ancestral qi, stabilizing Heaven and anchoring Earth. The Five Scripts unfolded the expanse, and the *Chaotic Cavern’s Crimson Script* was proclaimed anew. The *Eight Might’s Dragon Script*—the register of the Eight Might’s dragon-summoning—could subdue and tame demonic anomalies, command and employ divine spirits, safeguard and regulate the kalpic cycle, ensuring Heaven’s eternal endurance.\n\nOnce the Great Simplicity scattered, qi congealed into script. Being and non-being mutually sustained, manifesting benevolence while concealing utility. As the scripture says: \"Being provides advantage; non-being provides function.\" In the Dao, this ensures creation’s flawless transformation; in Heaven and Earth, it secures enduring imperishability; in humans, it grants immortality. Thus it is said: safeguarding and regulating the kalpic cycle ensures Heaven’s eternal endurance.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The Primordial Beginning’s secure enthronement signifies the pure, unified qi anchoring the Kun Palace. The dissemination of the Five Scriptures embodies the wondrous transformation of the Five Phases. The clustering within the divine chamber, the crimson writings on jade tablets, represent the primordial essence and true qi. The *Eight Might’s Dragon Script* embodies the Eight Radiant Yang Spirits, preserving and conveying this body through endless kalpas, transcending life and death, and attaining eternal union with Heaven.\n\nHumans, at birth, possess both destiny and nature: destiny is finite, but nature is indestructible. Though nature does not perish, the mediocre and foolish, upon the end of their destiny, cannot avoid dissolution and dispersion. The enlightened, through vigilant cultivation, unify life and death as one governance. Though destiny may end, nature undergoes no alteration. Yet even so, it does not compare to the Way of the Golden Elixir, wherein form and spirit are both perfected.\n\nThus Master Peng said: \"With the boundless primordial qi, one continues the limited mortal frame.\" The primordial qi is the true essence of Heaven and Earth’s eternal life, the qi of the sacred parents. The mortal frame is the turbid, ephemeral, chaotic vessel of ordinary parents. Thus, transforming the qi of the sacred parents to transmute the body of ordinary parents into a form of pure yang essence and true spirit enables one to attain longevity equal to Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Brahman qi pervades the cosmos, and the myriad patterns unfold. The *Inner Meaning* states: The Dao’s qi envelops and embraces the Great Void; the myriad things’ norms and models arise from this unfolding. The sun, moon, stars, and constellations, the peoples and all categories of beings, are all born, formed, and transformed by the Brahman qi.\n\nAccording to the *Sutra of Establishing Grades and Transformations*: \"Within the nameless and formless, the veiled and boundless primordial chaos, I initiated the mysterious and the yellow, dividing the numinous and dispersing the qi. From the Great Luo descended the Three Realms, then the Nine Heavens were generated. The Nine Heavenly Emperors were established as the mysterious ford of the Three Treasures, the Twenty-Seven Heavens as the cultivated grades of the realms, and the Thirty-Six Divisions as the mysterious roots of the Three Radiant Heavens, below which lie the domains of the Thirty-Six Heavens. Next, the Thirty-Two Heavens and Thirty-Two Emperors subtly set transformation in motion, dividing below into the Three Realms. Flanking the celestial pivot, the Twenty-Eight Constellations and Five Planets trace their courses to illuminate the Five Directions. Pure qi ascended, heavy turbidity congealed below, giving rise to the Nine Earths. At the center, the Nine Humans were born. Heaven, Earth, and all beings were thus complete.\n\nThus, the harmonious and upright qi of yang transformed into lofty sages and perfected immortals; the gentle, tranquil, and serene qi transformed into primordial lords, sacred consorts, immortal maidens, and jade women; the fierce, valiant, and heroic qi transformed into heavenly soldiers, divine warriors, and martial officials; the qi of yin and yang and the Five Phases transformed into men and women; and the chaotic and errant qi transformed into birds and beasts. All receive the same qi yet manifest in myriad forms, each following its own generation and transformation.\n\nSince the Great Void lies within the enveloping and embracing Dao qi, this body, too, resides within it. Like the norms of the myriad things, the sun, moon, stars, constellations, peoples, and all categories of beings, it is akin to the qi’s ascent and descent responding to yin and yang, or the cyclical revolutions of cold and heat manifesting as cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver. This is the transformation from non-being into being, forcibly named and modeled. To cling to it as real is to miss the wondrous Dao; returning to merge with the primordial is to achieve the Elixir.\n\nThe Primordial Net flows through the Thirty-Two Heavens, wheeling through the formless and circling the Ten Directions. Revolving the Dipper and traversing the Winnowing Basket, it cycles through the Five Constants. The Thirty-Five Divisions gather the qi of the Upper Origin. The Eight Radiant Realms merge in darkness, and qi enters the Mysterious of the Mysterious.\n\nThe Five Constants are the Five Phases. The Thirty-Five Divisions are the sun, moon, Five Planets, and Twenty-Eight Constellations. The *Inner Meaning* states: The Primordial Beginning’s ancestral qi, like a net’s guiding cords, is a unified whole. The Three Officials ascend and descend, circulating endlessly. This is what is meant by the Primordial Net flowing through the Thirty-Two Heavens, wheeling through the formless and circling the Ten Directions.\n\n\"Revolving the Dipper and traversing the Winnowing Basket, cycling through the Five Constants\" clarifies how the great Brahman ancestral qi begins its revolution at the Dipper and concludes at the Winnowing Basket, circling through the celestial degrees to complete the Five Phases. The Dipper and Winnowing Basket belong to the northeast, the position of Gen and Yin. Measuring celestial degrees through the human body, this corresponds to the region above the lower cinnabar field. The primordial qi first stirs, surging through the obscure and hidden. At the Yin hour, above the lower cinnabar field, it begins to unfold and expand.\n\nAt this moment, with lead drawing mercury and yin summoning yang, it resembles the great potter’s wheel shaping all things—nothing fails to arise. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"In the primal chaos of the vast expanse, the female and male follow one another, their nourishing fluids moistening and enriching, their transformative influence flowing and circulating.\" Beginning in the northeast realm of the Dipper and Winnowing Basket, it revolves and turns rightward, spewing forth the wheel of sprouts, revealing hidden depths in the abyss, and scattering radiant essence.\n\nThereafter, yang qi ascends, and at its extreme, yin is born; yin qi descends, returning to the root and reverting to the source, encircling the entire body and revolving the Five Phases. Thus, Master Yixuan said:\n*\"The returning elixir extends life,\nReversing and cycling yin and yang qi.\nFather and son, ruler and minister,\nCirculate and return to one position.\"*\n\nSpring’s benevolence warms wood,\nSummer’s fire abides in ritual.\nAutumn’s justice belongs to metal,\nWinter’s wisdom is water.\nThe Yellow Lord alone upholds trust,\nEarth’s tally is wu and ji.\nThese are the true Five Phases,\nThe Five Phases fundamentally of one kind.\nVirtue and power are most distinct,\nThe ancestral masters focus solely on this.\n\nWithin a single day, within a year’s seasonal qi, heaven, earth, and the myriad things are all complete within me. The primordial qi stirs and yin-yang divides; yin-yang divides and the four seasons form; the four seasons form and the qi nodes cycle; the qi nodes cycle and the Five Phases are complete; the Five Phases are complete and creation is achieved.\n\nYin and yang qi are the sun and moon.\nThe four seasons are the four images.\nThe twenty-four qi nodes are the fire times.\nThe Five Phases are the medicinal substances.\nYin-yang and the Five Phases correspond to the Dipper’s four seasons.\nThe twenty-four qi correspond to the twenty-eight lunar lodges.\nThis is called the thirty-five divisions.\nCreation’s achievement arises entirely from the one qi’s guiding net, the Eight Trigrams’ transformations, the subtle workings of the mysterious mechanism, and the hidden accord with the profound principle. Thus, it is said: the thirty-five divisions, the upper origin of all qi, and the eight luminous scenes merge in darkness. It cannot be exhaustively questioned, so it is blended into one, endlessly beyond naming, reverting to nothingness—hence, \"qi enters the profound mystery.\" Within the profound is the Supreme August, the Highest Perfected, the Celestial Thearch.\n\nWhenever \"August\" is invoked, it is the title of the Heavenly Worthy, equal in rank to the Primordial Beginning. As the *Inner Meaning* states: \"Within the profound is the immortal among immortals, the perfected among the perfected, the sage among sages, the Dao among the Dao.\" The Supreme August is the Primordial Beginning; the Celestial Thearch is the Lord of the Dao; the Highest Perfected is the Venerable Lord. The annals say: The Primordial Beginning is a being of the Great Canopy Heaven; the Lord of the Dao is a being of the Western Na country; the Venerable Lord is the utmost essence of primordial generation, the utmost spirit of incipient form. Though their titles differ, their Dao is one.\n\nInwardly speaking, the Primordial Beginning as a being of the Great Canopy Heaven is the ancestral qi; the Lord of the Dao as a being of the Western Na country is the Metal Mother; the Venerable Lord as the utmost essence of primordial generation and the utmost spirit of incipient form is the cinnabar body. All are my true nature, originally no different from any other thing. As the Daoist scriptures say: \"The formless form, the imageless image.\" This is what the Buddhists call the three bodies inherent in one’s own nature. The Sixth Patriarch said: \"The pure Dharma-body is your nature; the perfect Reward-body is your wisdom; the hundred thousand million Transformation-bodies are your conduct.\" The Confucian texts say the same. The *Doctrine of the Mean* states: \"What Heaven imparts is called nature\"—this is the Primordial Beginning. \"Following nature is called the Dao\"—this is the Lord of the Dao. \"Cultivating the Dao is called teaching\"—this is the Venerable Lord. Though one thread runs through them all, they are the Dao.\n\nThe Confucians use it to govern the world, to order ruler and minister, to rectify high and low, their merit extending to things, and they too can transcend the world. Thus, the *Records of the Primordial Beginning’s Ascended Immortals* states: \"From ancient times, those of utmost loyalty, utmost filial piety, utmost integrity, and utmost incorruptibility—unlike the common crowd—have all been promoted to immortal offices.\" The Buddhists use it to transcend the world, hence they say: \"All conditioned things are impermanent, a dharma of arising and ceasing; when arising and ceasing cease, quiescence is bliss.\" The Daoist gate employs both presence and absence, interpenetrating the empty and the real, gathering to form shape and dispersing to form qi. Thus, it is said: \"The jade tally preserves the spirit, the golden liquid refines the form; when form and spirit are both wondrous, they unite with the Dao in truth.\"\n\nFloating upon the great aurora, chanting the cavernous chapters.\n\"Floating\" means drifting; \"scene\" means body. It speaks of the Heavenly Worthy drifting upon the auroral clouds and intoning the cavernous chapters. As the *Inner Meaning* states: \"Floating scene\" refers to the principle in the scriptures that \"the great Dao drifts—it can go left or right.\" \"Great aurora\" is the qi of constant yang, for the Dao is omnipresent. Wherever it drifts, it is not beyond the realm of constant yang, and intoning the cavernous chapters is the principle of ease and contentment. If one’s true nature is immersed in the primordial harmony, it is joyful and at peace. As *Zhuangzi* says: \"Wandering the mind in blandness, uniting qi in the vastness.\"\n\nThe golden perfection shines resplendently, its flowing resonance in the cloudy encampment.\nThe jade sound gathers qi, the numinous wind assembles mist.\nThe Purple Void flourishes luxuriantly, aiding and sheltering the ten thousand immortals.\n\n\"Golden perfection\" is the chapter of natural radiance, its flowing resonance in the palace of auspicious clouds. \"Jade sound\" is the chapter of jade light; with a single dawn roar, the numinous wind gathers mist. As the *Inner Meaning* states: \"Golden perfection shines resplendently\" means the true spirit is luminous and abundant. \"Flowing resonance in the cloudy encampment\" means qi returns to the spirit chamber. \"Jade sound gathers qi\" means lead qi attracts mercury. \"Numinous wind assembles mist\" means true mercury coagulates cinnabar. \"The Purple Void flourishes luxuriantly, aiding and sheltering the ten thousand immortals\" means the yang spirit is concealed and radiant, surrounded by the ten thousand qi, dwelling within the spirit chamber. This is called the body of the golden elixir.\n\nThus, Master Wen Shi’s *Eulogy on the Purple Void’s Yang Light Record* says:\n*\"The Void Origin’s peerless Purple Void Secret Record,\nRoot of the Three Caverns’ mystery,\nTrue ancestor of heaven and earth,\nUtmost high, utmost supreme,\nUtmost wondrous, utmost numinous.\nCultivating it, one attains long life;\nPracticing it as an immortal, one returns to simplicity and reverts to the uncarved block.\"*\n\nCarefully observing these words, the Dao of the Purple Void is no different from the golden elixir.\n\nA thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—naturally they form the true.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: \"A thousand spirits harmonize into one spirit; ten thousand qi unite into one qi.\" By the principle of spontaneity, they coalesce into truth. Within truth dwells the spirit, the Great Lord of Longevity.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* says: \"This is the true spirit within nature, the fundamental Dao of undying life.\" As the scripture declares: *\"Its essence is most true, within it lies constancy. From ancient times to now, its name has never faded.\"* This is called the golden liquid returned elixir.\n\nThe Noble Youth of Non-Flourishing, the Venerable White Prime, the Great One Who Oversees Destiny, Peach Prosperity and Union Longevity—\nThe Noble Youth of Non-Flourishing is the spirit of the liver; the White Prime is the spirit of the lungs; the Great One is the lord of all spirits; the Overseer of Destiny is the true one of the southern summit; Peach Prosperity and Union Longevity are the spirits of the left and right kidneys.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: \"The *Method of Uniting the Imperial One* says: 'White Prime, Non-Flourishing, Peach Lord, Overseer of Destiny, and the Great One—unite the five spirits, bearing the register and standing in attendance.'\" Each of the five spirits governs its domain; through nine transformations they merge, and the Three and Five penetrate and transform. Thus the Three Palaces are secured in truth, and the hundred joints receive numinosity. The Imperial Lord’s precious register ensures that one’s predestined life remains unshaken.\n\nRevolving through the misty void, they open the passage to mysterious essence. The twenty-four perfected ones suddenly manifest, ascending to open the Upper Prime, descending to open the Eight Dark Realms. To the left they summon the Six Jia, to the right they dispatch the Six Ding. The Jade Splendor draws the sun, and the Great One merges with form. A thousand chariots, ten thousand riders—with the whole body they ascend at dawn.\n\nCultivating the true Dao of the Imperial One, when merit is complete and the hundred spirits unite, the principle of the golden elixir is likewise fulfilled. Holding the talisman and grasping the register, one preserves life and roots existence.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* says: \"Talismans and registers: in terms of form, they are written characters; in terms of the formless, they are numinous qi. The adept of the elixir grasps yin and yang, wields heaven and earth, clarifies the marvelous workings of creation, and moves the subtle mysteries of lead and mercury. When spirit is whole and qi complete, one unites with the Dao in truth. The true spirit guards one’s nature and life; the numinous qi protects the root of one’s existence.\"\n\nAbove they roam the Upper Clarity, entering and exiting the Flowery Chambers. Within the Eight Dark Realms, amid the finest subtleties, below they guard the human body—Mud Pill Palace and Crimson Palace. In the center they govern the five qi and unite the hundred spirits. Ten revolutions return the numinous; ten thousand qi ascend as immortals together.\n\nThe Flowery Chambers are the Three Flowery Chambers of Jade Clarity. The Eight Dark Realms are the Eight Poles. The finest subtleties are the tips of hairs. Mud Pill Palace is the palace of the brain; Crimson Palace is the heart. These true spirits, with the Great One as their lord, roam the Three Clarities, enter and exit the Flowery Chambers, circulate within the Eight Poles, and pervade the finest subtleties. Below, they guard the human body: the Great One resides in the brain, governing all spirits; the Overseer of Destiny dwells in the heart, receiving the primordial of life; Non-Flourishing is in the liver, controlling the three hun souls; White Prime is in the lungs, restraining the seven po souls; Peach Lord is in the navel, preserving the root of essence; Union Longevity is in the kidneys, guarding the Gate of Life. In the center, within the hollow emptiness, they regulate the qi and harmonize the hundred spirits. As the *Book of Changes* says: *\"The spirit’s origin is boundless—this is what is meant by the unfathomability of yin and yang.\"*\n\nThus the spirit is present everywhere; wherever it is, there is nothing it does not penetrate. Wisdom and knowledge cannot be defined by existence or non-existence.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: \"The principles of inner and outer are identical and without distinction. The Flowery Chambers of Upper Clarity, the Eight Dark Realms, and the finest subtleties—these are outer manifestations, transformed by a single qi. Mud Pill Palace, Crimson Palace, the five qi, and the hundred spirits—these are inner manifestations, likewise transformed by a single qi. Now, the non-existent: vast, it encompasses all; minute, it enters all. As for the spirit—it is not swift, yet it is fast; it does not move, yet it arrives.\" Mencius said: *\"The vast qi fills the space between heaven and earth.\"* Zhuangzi said: *\"The spirit reaches in all four directions, flowing without limit, ascending to heaven above, coiling upon the earth below.\"*\n\nIf one nurtures it in accord with nature, then the Three Divisions and Eight Effulgences, the Three Passes and Five Viscera, the Six Bowels, the Nine Palaces and Golden Towers and Jade Chambers, the Twelve Heavy Gates and Purple Doors and Jade Enclosures, the thirty-six thousand joints—all these, from root to origin, when spirit is whole and qi sufficient, are called the pure and unadorned Dao. Thus it is said: *\"One who embodies purity and simplicity\"* is called a true person. They roam and ascend to Upper Clarity, enter and exit the Flowery Chambers, vast enough to embrace the Eight Dark Realms, subtle enough to enter the tips of hairs. When gathered, they form a body; when dispersed, they become qi. The Heavenly Pass revolves ten times; the perfected ones transmit the numinous. The ten thousand qi return to the origin, and all attain the immortal Dao.\n\nThe immortal Dao values life and delivers beings without limit. Above, the Eight Gates open, and the Wheel of the Flying Celestial Law turns. Transgressions and blessings, prohibitions and precepts, predestined causes and conditions—all receive deliverance, and the souls of the dead are reborn in bodies. Once the body attains rebirth, it ascends to be heard by the various heavens. Above the various heavens, each has its Gate of Life. Within the heavens are countless great sages who constantly review the records of life and death for those who study immortality, delivering the souls of the Nine Dark Realms to ascend through the Eight Gates of the Dharma Wheel.\n\nThe above is the main text, spoken by the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: What the immortal Dao values above all is longevity. Without limit in its boundlessness, it delivers beings as they become ripe for deliverance. The *Treatise on Stimulus and Response* says: Those who seek longevity must advance through the Dao and retreat from what is not the Dao; they must accumulate virtue and merit, cherish compassion toward all things, be loyal and filial, friendly and fraternal, rectify themselves and transform others. Such are called good people—all people respect them, the heavenly Dao protects them, blessings and prosperity follow them, all evil departs from them, divine spirits guard them, their undertakings surely succeed, and immortality may be hoped for. Those who seek to become Celestial Immortals must establish one thousand three hundred good deeds; those who seek to become Earthly Immortals must establish three hundred good deeds. Refrain from all evil and practice all good. Thus, the fortunate person speaks good, sees good, and does good—three good deeds in a single day. After three years, Heaven will surely bestow blessings upon them. The ill-fated person speaks evil, sees evil, and does evil—three evil deeds in a single day. After three years, Heaven will surely bring down calamity upon them. The good and evil of people are all created by the heart. The heart, in its issuing and entering, takes form as an image; its gate moves in accord with the image. Its wheel of mental mechanism is perfected within, and the heavenly mechanism responds without. Thus, there are the Eight Gates of the Dharma Wheel, within which lies the arena of transgressions and blessings, the traces of prohibitions and precepts, and the origins of causes and conditions—all recorded in the *Dharma Wheel Sutra*. Though it is said that the transformation of great compassion universally opens deliverance, blessings vary in depth, and karmic retribution differs in degree. This is called: \"All predestined lives are heard, and the heavens above bestow according to one’s meritorious deeds.\" In receiving life, the souls of the dead enter the gate corresponding to their karmic fruit, while the reborn body attains ranks of immortality, high or low.\n\nWithin these are the chapters of the *Empty Cavern Songs*, the *Numinous Writ of the Demon Kings*, and verses that rival those of the loftiest perfected beings. The *Inner Meaning* states: The preceding text speaks of the Gate of Life above each of the various heavens. The Dao Lord continues, saying: \"Within these are the chapters of the *Empty Cavern Songs*.\" Some say \"Empty Cavern\" is the general name for the Three Realms; others say it refers to the principle of the *Cavern Chapters*. Taken together, the Three Realms encompass all the heavens, and within these heavens are the *Empty Cavern Songs*—the scriptures and records of the Three Caverns, the writings of the celestial perfected, hymns of praise, and the wondrous principles of the mysterious texts that awaken later learners. The flying songs of the Demon Kings, composed in midair, serve as warnings and admonitions, their principles in harmony with the celestial perfected. The Dao Lord has recorded them here, though they are not part of the original *Numinous Treasure* chapters and thus do not belong to the inner symbolic order; only their meaning is explained.\n\nThe above is the main text, recorded by the Jade Dawn Dao Lord.\n\nThe first is the *Flying Song of the Desire Realm*:\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The Demon King of the Desire Realm composed this song. When the karmic deeds of speech in a person are entirely purified, and they possess the ten virtues, they ascend to be reborn in the Six Heavens of the Desire Realm. The human realm is fleeting and frivolous; the immortal Dao is vast and difficult to fathom.\n\nThe Ghostly Way delights in the gate of human life,\nYet perverse paths rush toward death.\nThe Heavenly Way treasures life,\nDesiring humanity’s long existence.\nThe Ghostly Way treasures endings,\nDesiring humanity’s final death.\nThe Immortal Way is ever auspicious,\nFor it knows the constant, understands the luminous—thus is it auspicious.\nThe Ghostly Way is ever inauspicious,\nFor it acts in delusion—thus is it inauspicious.\nThe lofty and pure numinous spirits,\nSing mournful songs resounding through the vast sky.\nThey only wish the Immortal Way to succeed,\nAnd do not desire the human way to come to ruin.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: In clarity, they are the lofty perfected and exalted sages; in obscurity, they are the pure and numinous spirits. Moved by compassion for the world’s people, they proclaim the principles of all things, awakening those of utmost learning and illuminating the space between Heaven and Earth. They only wish the Immortal Way to succeed, and do not desire the human way to come to ruin.\n\nAn ancient virtuous one said: In the secluded forest, birds call; in the emerald stream, fish leap. Clouds drift and unfold; waterfalls murmur in sorrow. Such scenes reveal the path for humanity to enter. From this perspective, the myriad transformations, though vast and chaotic, are nothing but mournful songs.\n\nMaster Dongshan said: If you rely on the ear to listen, you will never grasp it; only when the eye hears the sound will you come to know.\n\n*Zhuangzi* said: Do not listen with the ear, but listen with the heart.\n\nLike rushing waters in a swift river, like a white colt passing through a gap—sun-bird and moon-hare reveal the foundation of cinnabar. The snake’s sloughing and cicada’s molting manifest the principle of liberation. The spirit turtle imbibes qi; the dung beetle rolls its ball. The fish by the Hao River’s banks in Qiyuan, the grass before Lianxi’s window—all can be inwardly apprehended, the Way perceived in the very act of seeing. This is the teaching without words, the hearing without sound.\n\nIn the winding springs of the Northern Capital’s subterranean府,\nA myriad ghosts gather in throngs.\nThey only seek to cut short human destiny,\nSevering the gate of human life.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The offices of Mount Fengdu govern punishment and retribution, recording transgressions and diminishing lifespans. Once the lifespan is exhausted, the limit of life is extinguished.\n\nAs the scripture notes: The lifespan a person receives at birth is called their \"allotment,\" recorded among the heavens. By decree of the Most High, the heavens and earth, sun and moon, stars and constellations, celestial perfected and exalted sages, generals and messengers, great spirits and divine youths, flying immortals of Heaven and Earth, the four bureaus of the Three Realms, and the officials of mountains and rivers—all hold registers and ledgers, patrolling and examining. Every three days, a report is made; every ten days, a memorial is submitted; every hundred days, a reckoning is settled. At the Three Primes, Eight Nodes, Five La Festivals, and Three Assemblies, merits and faults are assessed without cease. If one cultivates goodness, their years are extended; if one commits evil, their allotment is reduced, and they are sent to Fengdu with not a fraction lost.\n\nAh, the people sing the cavernous chapters,\nTo restrain the northern Luo and Deng.\nBinding and delivering demonic spirits,\nSevering the blades of the Six Ghosts.\nThe qi of the myriad heavens surges boundlessly,\nMy Way flourishes day by day.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: When external deviance is eliminated, the qi of the myriad heavens surges boundlessly; when inner conduct is established, my Way flourishes day by day.\n\nThe second is the *Song of the Form Realm’s Demon King*:\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The Demon King of the Form Realm composed this song. When the karmic deeds of the body in a person are entirely purified, and they possess three hundred virtues, they ascend to be reborn in the Eighteen Heavens of the Form Realm. Lofty and expansive—this is Heaven. Radiant qi shines in four directions—this is qi. The Brahma-conduct heavens encircle the ten directions; Brahma-qi envelops all. Immeasurable great spirits all arise from my body. All those who attain the Way are recommended for perfection by the Demon King. This demonstrates to practitioners the principle of promotion and demotion, so they may know what to take warning from.\n\nI possess cavernous chapters,\nTen thousand repetitions make an immortal.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The cavernous chapters are the *Flying Mystery Purple Writ of Mount Gui’s Cinnabar and Yellow*. When the Perfected Lord Yin attained the Way, the Elder Lord granted him the Western Tower of Hao Terrace. Entering the Seven Treasures Garden, he beheld its scripture. Practicing it according to the method, as fully recorded in the *Numinous Treasure Scriptures and Methods*, one achieves the rank of Numinous Treasure Perfected—this is not the Demon King’s song. \"Ten thousand repetitions make an immortal\"—ten thousand is the accumulation of one; it cannot be accomplished in a single morning or evening. Thus, it is achieved through accumulated practice.\n\nFormerly, the Perfected Lord of Fixed Records said to Lord Xu of Leiping: \"Studying the Way is like digging a well: the deeper the well, the harder it is to remove the soil. If one does not steadfastly cultivate correct conduct, how can they reach the spring’s source?\" This is the principle of accumulated practice.\n\nThe Immortal Way values deliverance,\nWhile the Ghostly Way clings to connection.\nWhat the Immortal Way values is long life and deliverance from the world; otherwise, when the body perishes and qi scatters, the hun and po souls are examined, and ancestors are implicated—how can one not be cautious?\n\nHeaven and Earth are vast and boundless,\nFoul qi swirls in abundance.\nThe joys of the Three Realms—\nPass beyond them to abide forever.\nCrossing into my realm,\nThe body enters spontaneity.\nAt this time, joy—\nIs but a trifling grace from me.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: In the vastness of physical forms, none surpass Heaven and Earth, yet foul and turbid qi also fill their midst. The Great Void is vast and empty, unobstructed by the myriad encounters.\n\nA master of great wisdom said: In the vastness of empty space, is there anything that obstructs it? Though it is not obstructed by things, it does not hinder things from coming and going. If a person’s nature is as vast and empty as Heaven, unobstructed by things, emulating the all-embracing nature of the Great Void, they transcend the six senses and six dusts, surpassing the Desire Realm, Form Realm, and Formless Realm. Habitual tendencies are entirely forgotten, and they no longer sink into the cycle of rebirth. Flesh and bones ascend together, entering the formless, attaining this state—true joy abides forever. Though this comes from cultivation, merit fulfilled and virtue perfected, it is also through the Demon King’s recommendation. This is one who attains the Way through the power of scriptural practice. If the work of the cinnabar path is accomplished, one ascends without passing through the ranks, immediately attaining the highest grade of immortality.\n\nThe Dragon Han era stretches boundlessly—\nHow can one distinguish the true?\n\nThe Dragon Han is the name of the first kalpa. At that time, the Great Way was pure and simple, its transformations effortless and unadulterated; human nature was likewise. The *Inner Meaning* states: At the inception of receiving one’s nature, like an infant before it can smile, how could there be distinctions of refinement and coarseness? The originally inherent nature is serene and pure; it is only through the delusions of emotions and consciousness that defilement and attachment arise.\n\nThe Most High said: \"My greatest affliction is that I have a body.\"\n\n\"And when I have no body, what affliction could I have?\nTo have a body is to have consciousness and emotion.\nTo be without a body is to be without consciousness and emotion.\nAll consciousness and emotion arise from delusion by false illusions;\nIf one can recognize false illusions, consciousness and emotion naturally dissolve.\nThe *Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment* states: *Knowing illusion is to depart from it; departing from illusion is awakening.*\nNor is there need for forced rejection—\nThen one’s nature returns to the darkness of the mind, merging wholly with the inception of the Dragon Han.\nThe scriptures say: *Focus the qi to attain suppleness, and one can be like an infant.*\nThus, what is real, and what is not?\nMy realm is difficult to transcend, so I compose this *Dongwen*.\nMy realm is the realm of form.\n*Dongwen* is this song.\nFor the demon kings wish to encourage people toward the Dao and thus compose songs to exhort them.\nThey transform and fly through the void to test your resolve.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: *Master Guan Yin said: ‘Things come without end, but my mind has its limits.’*\nThus, my good heart is constrained by emotion;\nMy original emotion is constrained by things.\nThe world’s entanglements, myriad and chaotic, are like obstacles to the Dao.\nRespond to circumstances as they arise, but do not cling to them in the mind.\nThus it is said: *Things are not my things, yet I cannot but respond;\nI am not my self, yet I cannot but nurture it.*\nThough one responds to things, there are no things;\nThough one nurtures the self, there is no self.\nWhat cannot be avoided are clothing and food.\nYet clothing and food are but the boat and oars for crossing the world’s river.\nOnce the other shore is reached, they are no longer needed.\nWhen all matters are settled, the floating life busies itself in vain.\nSuccess and fame come as they will—\nChariots and crowns may arrive by chance,\nSo do not strive for them through force or cunning; follow the conditions of the world.\nBut if one is deluded by sounds and sights, recklessly squandering spirit,\nSevering the bonds of nature and life, creating the karma of birth and death—\nThen the mind chases after things, and the spirit drifts and scatters.\nIn the midst of utter nothingness, one clings to existence;\nIn the midst of ceaseless change, one clings to constancy.\n\nThe scriptures say:\n*Ears and eyes, sounds and sights—these are the faults that detain you;\nNose and mouth, fragrances and flavors—these are your foes.\nThe body is the root of affliction—pain, itching, cold, and heat;\nThe mind is the burden of form—sorrow, poison, worry, and vexation.\nIf you do not swiftly cast them aside, your lifespan will not be prolonged.*\nThe noble person acts upon seeing the subtle signs, not waiting until the day’s end—\nWhy await the test?\nHow many among the transcenders falter in success or failure?\nI laugh at your failure to transcend, so I sing this song.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: *Success and failure, slackening and retreat—within these four words, one benefit and three harms.*\nIf one does not take the cycles of rebirth and death to heart,\nThen faith in the Dao is not sincere, and one advances an inch only to retreat a foot—this is certain.\nThus the scriptures say: *People in their endeavors often fail when nearly accomplished.*\nIf one remains as vigilant at the end as at the beginning, there will be no failure—\nThis refers to the rarity of those who persevere to the end.\n\nThe Third Song of the Formless Realm Demon King states:\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* says: *The Formless Realm Demon King composes this song. When the karmic deeds of the human mind are entirely purified, and six hundred meritorious acts are accumulated, one is born in the four heavens of the Formless Realm.*\nAbove the Three Realms, the vast and distant Great Luo.\nAbove the Three Realms are the Seed People’s Four Heavens.\nAbove the Seed People is the Great Luo Heaven.\nWithout form or root, cloud layers rise towering.\nAbove the Great Luo Heaven is the Jade Capital Mountain, born without roots, suspended in the void.\nUpon the mountain stand nine-tiered cloud towers, lofty and majestic.\nOnly the Primordial Beginning dwells there, the home of kalpas vast.\nHe governs my realm, presiding over the Mysterious Capital.\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy has resided there since the Empty Kalpa, ruling over the Three Realms.\nThose who transcend my realm enter the Jade Void.\nThe *Inner Meaning* says: *My realm is the Formless Realm; the Jade Void is the Void Jade Capital.*\nThe practitioner who transcends the Formless Realm ascends above the four heavens of the Seed People to the Dao realm of the Jade Capital’s void—only then is there no risk of falling.\nThose who have not yet transcended remain bound in the cycle of rebirth;\nFor the root of birth and death is not severed, and the qi of yin and yang still lingers.\nStill subject to fate, they rise or fall without end, ceaselessly turning—\nOnly attaining the Dao brings it to an end.\nI reign as the supreme king, governing the multitude of demons.\nTen thousand transformations in the void, impure qi blooms in profusion.\nFew preserve the true; many are deluded.\"\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: Those who preserve the true remain steadfast and unchanging; those who are deluded dwell in illusion and are easily swayed. What is fragrant as orchid and musk, the enlightened call foul and wanton qi; the arena of right and wrong, the enlightened call the turmoil of sin and fortune; the allure of powdered faces, the enlightened call the poisonous blossoms of the turtledove. The world delights in these, hence the deluded are many.\n\nThe Dao of immortals is hard to uphold; the path of ghosts is easily corrupted. The Dao of immortals is tranquil and non-action—though precepts are set, few firmly abide. Worldly affairs indulge the heart’s desires; without instruction or temptation, one naturally follows dissipation. The human Dao lies in the heart—truly, it does not come from elsewhere.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The Three Teachings all arise from the ground of the heart. The Confucians speak of preserving the heart, the Daoists of cultivating the heart, and the Buddhists of illuminating the heart. Some say rectifying the heart, washing the heart; some say emptying the heart, quieting the heart; some say stilling the heart, subduing the heart—all aim to refine it and restore its goodness. Thus, the Confucian cultivates the self, orders the family, governs the state, and brings peace to the world, all proceeding from the rectification of the heart. Extending this to others, one finds ample room—how could it be external to the heart?\n\nThe *Book of Documents* says: *The human heart is perilous; the Dao-heart is subtle. Only with precision and unity can one truly hold to the center.* As for extending knowledge and investigating things, these too are attained through rectifying the heart.\n\nThe Daoists say: *The void gives me life; non-being places me. That which gives me life is spirit; that which destroys me is the heart.* They also say: *All the evil karma of sentient beings arises from the heart’s deluded thoughts and inversions, failing to awaken to non-action. All roots of sin are created by the heart. The joys of heaven arise from the heart; the sinking into the Three Realms also begins in the heart.*\n\nThe Buddhists say: *If one wishes to fully know all buddhas of the three times, one should contemplate the nature of the dharma-realm—all is created by the heart.* They also say: *A hundred thousand dharma-gates all return to the square inch of the heart; the sands of the Ganges’ wondrous virtues all reside in the source of the heart. All gates of precepts, concentration, and wisdom, all spiritual transformations and miracles, are fully possessed within—none are apart from your heart.* As Mazu said: *The heart itself is buddha.* The *Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment* states: *All sentient beings are the ground of pure awakening.*\n\nPei Xiu said: *That which is truly pure, luminous, wondrous, and empty—penetrating and spiritually efficacious, standing solitary and unchanging—is the heart. Turning away from it makes one ordinary; following it makes one sagely. Delusion gives rise to the beginning of birth and death; awakening brings the end of rebirth.*\n\nYang Guishan said: *The entire *Mencius* is but an effort to rectify the human heart, teaching people to preserve the heart and nurture nature, to gather the scattered heart. Though a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, all arise from the heart. If one can rectify the heart, nothing else need be done.*\n\nShao Kangjie said: *Heaven divides creation from the One Center; humans initiate governance from the heart.* He also said: *The body is born after heaven and earth; the heart exists before heaven and earth. Heaven and earth emerge from me—what else need be said?*\n\nFrom this, we see it is truly not from elsewhere. The essential lies in vigilance in solitude: do not look at what is contrary to propriety, do not listen to what is contrary to propriety, do not speak what is contrary to propriety, do not act in ways contrary to propriety. Do not see what may be desired, lest the heart be disturbed. Abide in stillness and quietude, anchoring the spirit—let no stray thoughts arise. Embrace the One and guard the true; spirit harmonizes and qi clarifies. Let the heart be like dead ashes, the form like withered wood. External scenes do not enter; inner scenes naturally close. Do not pursue, do not cling—ten thousand thoughts will settle of themselves. Concentrate qi to attain suppleness. Return to the nature of an infant.\n\nShould one act contrary to this, one merely invites hardship. The Dao of immortals values substance: *See the plain and embrace the uncarved; returning to life is called constancy.* The human Dao values splendor: like feasting on grand sacrifices, like ascending spring terraces. If you do not delight in the Dao of immortals, how can you transcend the Three Realms? If you wish to turn through the Five Paths, what can I do for you?\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: Those who do not delight in the Dao of immortals value the splendor of the human realm. Enamored of worldly pleasures, they do not know the suffering of rebirth. According to the *Sutra of Origins*: *When thoughts cannot return and one turns away from the Dao, one enters the Five Paths without respite.* What are the Five Paths? The first path: the spirit ascends to heaven as a heavenly spirit. The second path: the spirit enters flesh and bone to become a human spirit. The third path: the spirit enters birds and beasts to become an animal. The fourth path: the spirit enters creeping vines to become a hungry ghost. The fifth path: the spirit enters the hells of mud and plough to be tormented.\n\nAlas! The Great Sage, in boundless compassion, earnestly warns: if one awakens to the fact that worldly pleasures are not true pleasures and that transcending the Three Realms is true joy, one will surely not endure rebirth through the Five Paths.\n\nThe above is the main text as narrated by the Dao Lord.\n\nAbove the Three Realms, in the void of flight, the Demon King’s song resonates, its melody interwoven with cavernous hymns. Reciting it a hundred times is called *Passing the Southern Palace*. Reciting it a thousand times, the Demon King will protect and welcome you. After ten thousand recitations, the Dao is perfected, and you will ascend to the great void, transcend the Three Realms, and be enthroned as an immortal duke. Those who hear the numinous sound—the Demon King will show reverence. The numinous sound refers to the original hymns of the *Numinous Treasure*; the Dao Lord praised the Demon King’s song, saying that even reciting it can lead to perfection and entry into the Dao—how much more so the original hymns of the *Numinous Treasure*!\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: When the heart aligns with the scripture and conduct accords with it, uniting goodness as one and cutting off all conditions, recitation then truly embodies the scripture’s intent. It commands and restrains earthly deities, who escort and receive, delivering one from the Five Sufferings and Eight Difficulties of the earthly realm. Seven generations of ancestors ascend, forever departing the ghostly officials. The soul crosses the Vermilion Mound, undergoes refinement, and is reborn.\n\nThe above command and restraint were bestowed by the Celestial Venerable of Original Beginning; the Dao Lord recorded them.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: *Command and restraint* refers to the decrees of the Celestial Venerable of Original Beginning—the primordial qi of the Original Beginning. Decrees are the workings of creation. *Earth* is soil; *only* is spirit, signifying that the primordial qi of creation, the true nature of soil, gives birth to spirit.\n\nThose who *escort and guard* cultivate correctness, sustain fullness, preserve the feminine, and embrace the One. Those who *send off and receive* are the flow of *kan* into *wu*, the movement of *li* toward *ji*—this is the completion of merit and the perfection of the elixir. Thus the *Wuzhen Pian* says:\n\n*Take the solid from the next position in the heart,\nRefine the yin within the Palace of Li.*\nFrom this, it transforms into the firmness of *qian*,\nA hidden, soaring, and free heart.\n\nWhen yang *qi* is pure and complete, and yin *qi* is entirely stripped away, one transcends the reckoning of the Five Phases and escapes the mechanism of the Eight Trigrams—hence it is said: *delivered from the earthly realm’s Five Sufferings and Eight Difficulties.* Yin *qi* is severed at the Gate of *kun*, thus *seven generations of ancestors ascend, forever departing the ghostly officials.* The yang spirit gathers in the Palace of *li*, thus *the soul crosses the Vermilion Mound, undergoes refinement, and is reborn.* This is the divine transformation of shedding the mortal coil—*the immortal of eternal life.*\n\nSuch is the boundless, universally liberating power. It holds the secret celestial script, revered by all heavens. To leak or profane it is to fall into hell, bringing calamity upon seven generations of ancestors.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: Vast as heaven and earth, minute as insects, this Dao is complete, lacking nothing. It is not bestowed because of nobility, nor withheld because of lowliness. Its secrecy exists only to prevent disrespect. If one can revere and practice it, blessings are infinite; if one is negligent, dark retribution remains.\n\nThe Dao says: These two chapters are the hidden sounds of the Heavenly Emperors and the Divine Kings of Spirits—utterances of the Great Brahma, not the common speech of the world. Their words lack ornate rhythm, their melodies lack florid beauty; thus they are called profound and obscure, difficult to fathom.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: These two chapters are the *Hundun Chiwen* and the *Yuandong Yuli.* One reveals the Dao of the Primordial Heaven, the other the principles of the Posterior Heaven. Their hidden sounds, the words of the Great Brahma, the mysteries of the elixir—all follow the same principle. Not being the language of the world, they are hard to investigate. Without a master’s guidance, how could they be easily understood?\n\nThis treasure of heaven is kept secret in the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Mysterious Capital. According to the celestial statutes, it is transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas. If a perfected person offers gold and treasures with a sincere heart, following the old protocol and pledging allegiance to the Ten Heavens, only then is it bestowed. Ten thousand kalpas are like last night; a thousand springs are like this morning. Thus, a transmission once every forty thousand kalpas is not truly distant—this is the celestial standard, not the timeframe of mortal transmission.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: This scripture and this Dao are heavenly treasures, with strict protocols for transmission. How could they be treated lightly?\n\nThe Dao says: The revolutions of heaven and earth also have their ends. *End* refers to the calamity of the *yang* nine and hundred-six. *Termination* refers to the dissolution of the Three Realms. The sun, moon, and five planets also wax and wane. Even the most sagely and divine beings experience cycles of flourishing and decline. Lesser students also face illness and injury. If heaven, earth, and sages have their times of decline, how could lesser students avoid affliction? If one encounters such, accept it without resentment.\n\nWhen such disasters arise, all of shared *qi* must act together: with unified hearts, perform purification rites, burn incense in the six periods, and recite the scripture ten times. Blessings and virtue will descend immediately, dissolving all misfortune. The boundless scripture universally liberates without end.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: Humans, heaven, earth, and the myriad things are of a single *qi.* Thus the Most High addressed the four assemblies: When any among them face disaster, all of shared *qi* should unite in purification rites, burning incense and reciting scriptures—this is to view all as one body. How could one who cultivates the Dao place self and others in the chamber of the mind?\n\nMaster Zeng said: The Master’s Dao is nothing but loyalty and reciprocity. *Loyalty* is exhausting oneself; *reciprocity* is extending oneself to others. If I desire peace, how could others not desire it as well? Thus, when I wish to stand, I help others stand; when I wish to succeed, I help others succeed. Then there is no killing or harming, no jealousy or envy, no licentiousness or theft, no greed or desire, no hatred or resentment. Words are free of embellishment, speech free of malice. With unified compassion and love, even those of different bones become kin. This is how it is achieved.\n\nIt is said: To become an earthly immortal, perform three hundred good deeds; to become a heavenly immortal, perform one thousand three hundred good deeds—this is not difficult. If one can follow this, why merely become an immortal? The Dao of Great Peace will be complete.\n\nThe Dao says: If a student’s cultivation is shallow and their immortal rank incomplete, when their destined time of passing arrives and their body enters the Great Yin, at the moment of transition, fellow students and perfected ones should burn incense and recite the scripture ten times to deliver the corpse according to the method. The soul will ascend directly to the Southern Palace, and according to their merit, after a set number of days, they will be reborn. Escaping the wheel of rebirth, they will attain immortality.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: If one’s practice is insufficient, fate cannot be escaped. Though this form is shed and appears dead, the feet do not turn green, the skin does not wrinkle, the eyes do not dim, and the limbs remain pliable. Following the protocol for delivering the corpse, the spirit undergoes refinement in the Yin realm. According to the depth of their merit and the length of their practice, after the allotted time, the spirit returns to the body, and they are reborn. Though outwardly deceased, after years or even decades, it is but a moment in time. From then on, they attain immortality—this is also the Dao of corpse liberation.\n\nThe Dao says: When the revolutions of heaven and earth end, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When the stars and constellations fall into disorder and the sun and moon lose their regularity, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When the four seasons lose their order and yin and yang fall out of harmony, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. These three cannot escape the reckoning of fate, but human effort can assist them. Human effort cannot alter their outcome, yet the Dao grants it.\n\nWhen the ruler of a state faces disaster and warfare erupts on all sides, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When plague and pestilence spread, causing the death of the people, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures.\n\nWhen masters or friends face the end of their allotted span, one should likewise perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. In these three matters, Heaven cannot manifest its efficacy unaided; human effort brings them to fruition, yet human effort cannot exhaust their utmost sincerity—this, too, is granted by the Dao.\n\nNow, purification rites and scripture recitation carry profound merit: above, they dissolve celestial calamities and safeguard the emperor; below, they dispel poisonous harms and deliver the multitudes. In life and death, all depend upon them, their blessings beyond measure. Thus it is said: boundless, they universally ferry across heaven and humanity.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: Humans, bearing the form of Heaven, dwell between yin and yang, never departing the bounds of their mold—how could they escape hardship and adversity? The workings of creation move in secret; cold and heat shift imperceptibly. If one does not adjust in accord with the seasons, suddenly afflicted by pestilence, how could illness be avoided? Speaking inwardly, when \"the movements of Heaven and Earth reach their end,\" this is the exhaustion of fate. When \"the stars and constellations fall into disorder and the sun and moon lose their regularity,\" this is the turbidity and chaos of spirit and qi, the dizziness and palpitations of heart and eyes. When \"the four seasons lose their order and yin and yang fall out of harmony,\" this is the imbalance of dryness and dampness, cold and warmth, the discord of the two qi. As for \"performing purification rites, burning incense, and reciting scriptures,\" this is to empty the heart and refine qi, to nurture the spirit and preserve the true. It can succor the world and revive the dying, avert misfortune and dispel illness.\n\nIf the ruler of a state faces disaster, warfare erupts on all sides, plague and pestilence spread, causing the death of the people, or masters and friends face the end of their span, one should rouse loyalty and sincerity, compassion and pity, dispel calamities and rescue the afflicted, employing arts of salvation to accumulate good karma and amass hidden merit. Thus it is said: purification rites and scripture recitation carry profound merit.\n\nNow, purification is the purification of the heart. When Yanzi abstained from wine and meat, Confucius called it the purification for sacrifice, not the purification of the heart. The purification of the heart is to empty the heart. The *Daoist Canon’s Record of Calculations* states: \"A ten-day purification fast adds a twelve-year cycle to one’s lifespan; a one-day purification fast adds a hundred days.\" This purification is none other than the purification of the heart.\n\nAs for precepts, Lord Laozi said: \"Those who study the supreme Dao yet do not uphold the great precepts—reciting scriptures, chanting incantations, wearing talismans, praying to spirits, compounding elixirs, ingesting medicines, or retiring to the mountains to seek ascent as immortals—may hardly hope for success. If one can fully uphold the precepts inwardly while harmonizing one’s light outwardly, one may approach the threshold of the numinous. It is not cultivation that is difficult, but upholding the precepts. If you can fully uphold the precepts, extending your thoughts to the ten directions, the Most High will ensure your ascent as an immortal. If one upholds the precepts fully, recites the precious scriptures, wears the great talismans, and performs the rites, yet still does not ascend as an immortal, then there is no path to deathlessness under Heaven. What I lament about the world is the rarity of such people.\"\n\nTo have scriptures without precepts is like crossing the sea without a boat or oars, like having a mouth without a tongue—how could one ferry across the multitudes? The essence of the Dao lies in aligning one’s conduct with the true regulations and accumulating goodness within; only then may one enter the realm of the great Dao. Those who cannot do so labor in vain amidst the dust, gaining nothing for the length of their lives.\n\nThus, precepts have distinct texts, their outlines briefly set forth: the Five Precepts of Lord Laozi, the One Hundred Eighty Precepts conferred upon Master Yin, the Seventy-Two Precepts conferred upon the Perfected Master Gan, the Twenty-Four Precepts of the Great Clarity, the Twelve Precepts for Purification Rites and Daoist Practices, the Ten Precepts for Cultivating the True, the Nine Wondrous Precepts of the Nine Perfected, the Nine Precepts of the Numinous Treasure, the Five Precepts of the Orthodox Unity—others are fully recorded in the scriptures and repentance texts, too numerous to name. Without exception, they serve to examine the heart and restrain the self, to cease evil and prevent wrongdoing. In short: think no deviance, respect all things. What is most urgent is to place lust first. Thus it is said: lust is the foremost of the ten defeats, killing comes next. Other actions that hinder Daoist practice or obstruct principle should all be abandoned. The scriptures say: \"Diminish and diminish again, until reaching non-action.\"\n\nAll who uphold the precepts must meticulously study and practice them. If there is anything not understood, omitted, violated, or mistakenly transgressed, all incur transgressions and sins, collectively called \"breaking the precepts.\" One should then repent and confess. The Queen Mother of the West said: \"Those who yearn for the Dao and aspire to immortality must concentrate their sincerity and will, purify themselves and reflect on transgressions, thereby eliminating a hundred faults. Restraining the self and returning to goodness, revering the true spirits, preserving the true and guarding the One—practicing this for a month eliminates a thousand faults. Thus, faults are transformed, the preserved becomes numinous, the world is succored, the state is blessed, and all under Heaven enjoy its great benefits. Yin and yang harmonize and settle, ghosts and spirits do not disturb, all beings fulfill their natures, and the myriad things remain unharmed. Outwardly, this is the response; inwardly, the result may be known. How could it not 'dissolve celestial calamities above, safeguard the emperor, dispel poisonous harms below, and deliver the multitudes'? How could its blessings not be 'beyond measure, universally ferrying across heaven and humanity'?\"\n\nHere ends *Volume Four of the Inner Meaning of the Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of the Boundless Salvation of Humanity*.\n\n*Volume Five of the Inner Meaning of the Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of the Boundless Salvation of Humanity*\n\nObserving Reversion said: Master Xiao Ying studied the Dao.\n\nThe Dao states: Whoever possesses this scripture and performs these meritorious deeds for Heaven and Earth, the emperor, and the multitudes—on days of disaster, rousing the heart to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures ten times—all the heavens record their names, the myriad spirits attend and protect them, and the distinguished Perfected Ones of the right distinguish them, enabling them to become ministers of the Golden Gates of the Sage Lord.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: As previously said, when \"the movements of Heaven and Earth reach their end, the sun, moon, and five planets wane and wax, the sagely flourish or decline, and the unlearned suffer illness or harm,\" one should perform purification rites and recite scriptures. It is also said: \"Purification rites and scripture recitation can dissolve celestial calamities, safeguard the emperor, dispel poisonous harms, and deliver the multitudes. Performing these meritorious deeds, all the heavens record their names, the myriad spirits attend and protect them, the distinguished Perfected Ones of the right distinguish them, enabling them to become ministers of the Golden Gates of the Sage Lord.\" Thus, merit returns to oneself. Therefore, the ancients said: \"The word 'goodness' is most capable of accomplishing all practices.\"\n\nMay one’s good intentions be voiced, and the heavens above shall hear them—resounding like the crack of firecrackers—whereupon the Perfected Ones and all the sages above will surely uphold them, for their hearts are in accord. As the scripture says: “Having acted for others, one finds oneself all the more enriched; having given to others, one finds oneself all the more abundant.” How could the purport of the *Contemplation Scripture* deceive us? The heavens record each person’s merits and transgressions, not missing even the slightest fraction. Even the demon-kings of the celestial realms will safeguard and commend those who attain the Way, for this is the luminous truth of the most profound teachings.\n\nThe old commentary states: In cultivating the Dao, as merit and virtue accumulate and become manifest, the heavens record one’s goodness, and the demon-kings protect and commend one, naturally leading to profound understanding, embodiment of the real, and penetration of the scriptures’ purport.\n\nWithin the heavens, the Great Brahma’s hidden language resounds with boundless tones. The *Inner Meaning* says: The Great Brahma is the primordial qi of the Original Beginning, which coalesces and disperses to form sound. *Fan* (梵) means “pervasive,” for it is the same throughout the six directions. “Hidden language” refers to the secrets of the celestial realms, which worldly people cannot comprehend. “Boundless tones” means that beings of all regions and kinds universally hear the wondrous meaning, without limit or end. Altogether, there are two hundred fifty-six characters, distributed among the thirty-two heavens, eight characters to each. They are also inscribed upon the palaces and towers of the Mysterious Capital and the various heavens. If one can ingest these characters, then according to one’s practice, one rides the qi and returns to one’s proper place.\n\nAccording to the *Scripture of Inner Sounds*: Once, the Most High Lord of the Original Beginning was seated in the Cypress Mound Lodge of the Vermilion Brightness World. At that time, clouds and mist surged for three days and nights, and the dark yin did not disperse. The Five Elders addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Today, as we attend your seat, we witness what we have never seen before. When the Heavenly Worthy expounds the teachings, rivers and seas fall silent, and mountains and peaks conceal their clouds. Yet now, in broad daylight, darkness prevails, and the heavenly and human realms are filled with dread. We do not know the reason.” The Heavenly Worthy replied: “Today, the heavens have emitted auspicious signs, and numinous responses arise spontaneously. Jade characters gleam resplendently, obscuring the light of heaven. Let all in the four directions close their eyes and listen reverently.” In an instant, the celestial qi suddenly parted, the gloom vanished, and five-colored radiance illuminated the ten directions. Suddenly, a divine scripture appeared in the empty mystery above, its characters a full *zhang* in size, its patterns and hues dazzling, its eight corners trailing rays of light. The brilliance was so intense that none could gaze upon it directly. The Heavenly Worthy proclaimed to all: “This is the *Numinous Scripture of the Eight Assemblies*. Its characters have no fixed form; their import is subtle and profound, difficult to fathom. They must be annotated.” Thereupon, the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign received the Heavenly Worthy’s luminous command and annotated its sounds, transmitting them to the Dao Lord, who taught them to all in the heavens who were destined to attain the Way, achieve Perfection, and gain immortal names.\n\n---\n\n**The Middle Section of the Numinous Scripture of the Original Beginning**\n*Composed by the Dao Lord*\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* says: The white characters marked in the *Numinous Scripture* correspond to the symbolic forms of the hexagrams’ qi, the seasonal nodes, and the times of day. The ancient Perfected Ones declared that this *Numinous Scripture* accords with the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Great Change*. This scripture existed before heaven and earth, before the hexagrams came into being. The Queen Mother of the West, over nine days, guided the *Qian* and *Kun* hexagrams to manifest the *Mu* and *Dong* trigrams, so that *Qian* and *Kun* began with these, followed by *Zhun* and *Meng*, and concluding with *Ji Ji*, forming the warp and woof of creation. The sixty *jiazi* cycles listed below clarify the beginning and end of the qi’s numerical circulation. The twelve hexagrams of the monthly nodes and seasons that follow illustrate the waxing and waning of yin and yang, the advance and retreat of cold and heat over the year. The separate notations for the waxing and waning of the new and full moons clarify a single month. The twelve two-hour periods further mark the fire phases and the advance and retreat of the water tally within a single day. Thus, the nodes of a year are compressed into a month, and two and a half days correspond to a month. The twelve hexagrams that follow, matching the twelve two-hour periods, further condense a month into a single day. One two-hour period corresponds to two and a half days. Therefore, the upper and lower hexagrams differ in their applications, and the *jiazi* cycles and seasonal nodes also vary in meaning. In sum, the upper hexagrams’ *jiazi* are the warp, while the lower hexagrams’ seasonal nodes and times of day are the weft. The cultivated person need only observe the movements and stillness, the rises and falls, the waxings and wanings, and naturally will grasp the meaning beyond words, for the subtlest principles are all contained herein. Following the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign’s annotations of the inner sounds, some passages have been abridged to retain essentials, while others have been expanded with additional characters to elucidate the text, all to ensure that people may understand its meaning.\n\n**Dǎnlóu Ācāng, Yù**\n*Dīngchǒu*\n\nThe old commentary says: *Dǎn* describes a vast and boundless appearance. *Lóu* refers to the long tower beneath the Jade Capital Mountain, which supports the Mysterious Capital Palace. *Ā* is the name of the spirit of the palace’s eaves, who oversees the tower’s surveillance and governs the qi of the Great Brahma. When the qi’s cycles complete their circuit, *Ānà* sounds the drum of the tower capital, assembling the multitude of Perfected Ones to pay homage to the Original Beginning. This occurs three times daily, with one drumbeat, as the regular observance. *Cāng* is the name of the terrace where the Imperial Lord roams, lush with verdant splendor. *Wúhé Guānyīn*.\n\n**Suí**\n*Wùyín*   The Spring Equinox node corresponds to the *Great Strength* hexagram, and the sun corresponds to the *mǎo* hour.\n\nThe old commentary says: *Wú* is the Great Void. Within the Great Void, the true sages naturally arise. *Hé* is the name of the gate of the sun and moon. *Guān* means “awakening,” and is the taboo name of the Heavenly Emperor. The sound is that of the eight characters; reciting them enables the Perfected to ride the golden wheel and open the darkness, while the Jade Maidens wave flowered banners to unfasten the gates. The *Awakening* oversees the records of the long night, delivers the four dark realms, and rescues the nine nether palaces. The seven generations of ancestors are illuminated, and decayed bones revive. These eight characters are the inner sounds of the Yellow and Primeval Heavens.\n\n**Xūyán Míngshǒu, Gǔ**\n*Jǐmǎo*\n\nThe old commentary says: *Xūyán* is the name of the northwest gate of the Jade Perfection. When the great kalpas intersect, it opens at *Xūyán*, and the Jade Perfected and Upper Sages return. *Míngshǒu* is the title of the capital’s warden under the Original Beginning. When the Original Beginning initiates the kalpa, the warden opens the Dao and begins the Brahma practices, and the various qi suddenly become radiant. *Fǎlǎn Lìkǒu Tán*.\n\n**Lín**\n*Gēngchén*\n\nThe old commentary states: The *Dharmachakra* is the field of sin and merit. *Lǎn* is *Awakening*, the taboo name of the Heavenly Emperor, who presides over the deliverance of souls and their rebirth. *Pú* is *Bodhi*, wielding the nine-colored banner. *Tán* is *Tányí*, grasping the ten absolute pennants—both are Upper Prime Realized Ones. If one constantly recites the cavernous chapters, the *Dharmachakra* guides the registers to the Controller of Destinies, *Awakening* delivers souls to rebirth, *Bodhi* revolves the nine colors in cyclic motion, and *Tányí* whirls the ten absolutes to still the kalpa. Heaven and earth, receiving this, do not collapse; the myriad beings, receiving this, endure forever. These eight characters are the inner sounds of the Jade Perfection Heaven. Hereafter, every eight characters form the inner sounds of a heaven, proceeding eastward, circling south to the west, and halting in the north at the *Píngyù Jiǎyì* Heaven.\n\n**Jiànà Āyì, Guān**\n*Xīnsì*\nThe Ritual of Establishing the Chen Month, Pure Brightness Festival.\n\nThe old commentary says: *Jiànà* is the title of the Heavenly Master of Diagrams, who oversees the records of human life and death and governs the registers of divine immortals. *Āyì* is the name of a tree in the Seven Treasures Grove, shading the four directions. It is the pleasure garden of the Upper Sages and the playground of the Realized Ones.\n\n**Hūhē Liúyín.**\n*Shìkè*\n*Rénwǔ*\nThe Ritual of the Chen Month’s End, Grain Rain Festival.\n\nThe old commentary says: *Hū* means \"awakening\" and is the name of a Flying Heavenly Spirit. *Hē* is *hēmó*, the title by which the Heavenly Worthies invoke the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. *Liúyín* means \"flowing chants.\" When the kalpic destiny reaches its end, *hēmó* reveals the teachings to transform and universally deliver heaven-dwellers and humans. Before the kalpic dissolution arrives, the Heavenly Worthy, already foreseeing the concealment of the true scriptures, preemptively chants these verses. Those who constantly recite the cavernous chapters will have the Heavenly Master of Diagrams erase their transgressions from the records of eternal night and inscribe their names in the Southern Palace.\n\n**Huādū Qūlì, Bì**\n*Guǐwèi*\nGrain Rain Festival, corresponding to the *Guài* hexagram, with the sun aligned at the *chén* hour.\n\nThe old commentary says: *Huādū* is a special commission of the Great Ultimate Palace’s Azure Flower Gate in the heavens. *Qū* refers to the Brahmanic divine beings who soar above the Great Ultimate, singing the melodies of cavernous chapters upon the invigorating winds of the *shuǎnglíng* qi. *Lì* is the name of a Jade Maiden of Supreme Harmony.\n\n**Xiānpú Yùzhēn.**\n*Bō*\n*Jiǎshēn*\n\nThe old commentary says: *Xiān* refers to *xiānyún*, the auspicious clouds. *Pú* is *púlóu*, the name of a heavenly tower. *Yù* is the hidden name of an Imperial Lord. *Zhēn* means \"to arrive.\" The Imperial Lord of *Yù* perpetually rides the wheel of the Eight Radiances, roaming beyond the Eight Poles to the abodes of ghosts and spirits. There, he unfurls the banners of the Ten Absolutes to summon heavenly demons and universally deliver heaven-dwellers and humans. Those who constantly recite the cavernous chapters will have Flying Heavenly Spirits chant from afar, the Three Realms’ administrators welcome them, and their seven ancestors emerge from eternal night to ascend to the Southern Palace.\n\n**Dāluò Dàfàn, Fù**\n*Yǐyǒu*\n\nThe old commentary says: *Dā* is the name of a jade tower in the heavens. *Luò* means \"falling open.\" *Dà* refers to the Great Amnesty. At the inception of the Heavenly Worthy’s kalpic revolution, universal pardons are granted, known as the Great Amnesty. *Fàn* is the qi of Brahmanic conduct, inaugurating the Dragon Han kalpa and setting in motion the era of Red Clarity.\n\n**Sànyān Qìngyún, Wúwàng**\n*Bǐngxū*\nThe Ritual of Establishing the Fourth Month, Beginning of Summer Festival.\n\nThe old commentary says: *Sànyān* refers to the Realized Ones dispersing incense in the jade towers. *Qìngyún* are the five-colored auspicious clouds. As the auspicious clouds ascend to the Purple Mansion, Flying Heavenly Spirits dance in the celestial wheel.\n\n**Fēisǎ Yùdū, Dàxù**\n*Dīnghài*\n\nThe old commentary says: *Fēi* is the title of the Flying Heavenly Spirits. When heaven and earth undergo kalpic transformation and sink into the *Yánkāng* era, plunging into boundless darkness, the Flying Heavenly Spirits illuminate the light, dispersing radiance so that all heavens receive the qi. *Sǎ* refers to the swift revolutions of the Dragon Han kalpa. *Yù* is the sacred title of the Jade Perfected Lord who opens the gates of eternal night. *Dū* is *Fēngdū*, the nether capital of the Nine Dark Realms. Those who accumulate meritorious deeds will have the Jade Perfected Lord open the gates of eternal night and *Fēngdū* deliver them from the Eight Tribulations. Their seven ancestors will be reborn, and the souls of the departed will shine forth. The Demon Lords ascend to the gates of enlightenment.\n\nAt *Yí* (戊子), the *Lesser Fullness* solar term aligns with the *Qian* hexagram, and the day corresponds to the *Si* hour.\n\nThe old commentary says: *Míng* means to elucidate the meaning of the Eight Characters. *Mó* refers to the Demon Lords. *Shàng* is the Supreme Emperor. *Mén* is the gate below. If one can clearly comprehend the meaning of the Eight Characters, the Demon Lords will revere and submit, and the Supreme Emperor will nurture and sustain the spirit-gate of one’s initial birth. Beneath the gate, Han Jun, the Controller of Destiny and Registrar of Records, calculates and measures in the Southern Palace, bestowing blessings upon the nine clans, so that both the living and the dead receive grace.\n\n*Wúxíng Shàngshǒu* (无行上首), *Dàguò* (己丑)\n\nThe old commentary says: *Wú* is the supreme Dao. It speaks of the primordial qi of the Origin Beginning, which opens the luminous Dao of the primordial origin above. *Xíng* is the guiding principle of the Celestial Origin, weaving through the eight directions, with Brahmanic qi pervading and circulating without cease. *Shàngshǒu* is the Sin-Palace of the Northern Dipper. It revolves and stumbles, flowing into the mysterious.\n\n*Kǎn*\n*Kǎn* is water. *Xuán* is the tortoise. *Huà* is the mechanism. The yin within contains the yang symbol; within lead lies true silver. Yin without yang cannot refine its own essence, hence it is called \"masculine metal.\" Belonging to the north, it is called the *Kǎn* male.\n\nThe old commentary says: *Huí* means to revolve. *Zhí* means to tread. At the inception of the kalpic revolution, the Origin Beginning treads the void and wheels in revolution, disseminating transformation throughout the ten directions. *Liú* is the flowing light of dawn, illuminating the palace of eternal night. *Xuán* is emptiness. Beyond the celestial balance of the *Xuándū* in the heavens above, there is the *Kōngfēng* Mountain, where myriad sages wander, where the living and the dead return. When the Dao is not yet fully attained and the body is destined for extinction, the soul ascends to *Kōngfēng*, undergoes refinement, and is measured in the Southern Palace.\n\n*Ātuó Lóngluó*, *Lí*\n*Lí* is fire, the Vermilion Bird, the mechanism of transformation. The yang within contains yin; within cinnabar lies true mercury. Yang without yin cannot radiate its own spirit, hence it is called \"feminine fire.\" Belonging to the south, it is called the *Lí* female.\n\nThe old commentary says: *Ā* refers to the nine-fold mountains in the heavens, connected in continuous ridges. *Tuó* is the tower upon the mountain, which ascends to the qi of the Jade Purity and gazes upon the realms of the Three Worlds. The Lord Emperor often roams the peaks of *Āqiū*, overseeing the transgressions of all beings. *Lóng* is Dragon Mountain, separated from *Ātuó* by nine hundred million miles. *Luó* are the names of the sun and moon. The Perfected of the Nine Heavens of Highest Purity call the sun *Zhuó*. *Luó* describes how the mountain’s form intertwines, with the sun and moon shining above its peaks.\n\nThe Four Symbols exhale and inhale in harmony.\n\n*Xián* (庚寅)\n\n\"Xián\" means \"resonance.\" It is the place of union in the Central Palace. When the Four Symbols exhale and inhale in harmony, those who align with this hexagram may perceive the essential concord of the scriptures, the true essence, and the primordial qi. As for the intertwining of Dragon and Tiger in the Central Palace, yin and yang unite in kind, Metal and Water achieve balance, Kan and Li attain completion—sweet dew descends, the yellow sprout arises, and this is the substance of the Returned Elixir.\n\nThe hexagram *Xián* consists of *Gèn* below and *Duì* above. The scripture states: \"The earth’s treasury releases its secrets; gold and jade reveal their forms.\" This is sufficiently clear.\n\nThe old commentary says: The \"Four\" refers to the palaces of the Four Poles—namely, the Eastern Flower, Southern Pole, Western Numinous, and Northern Perfected. The Perfected of the Four Poles govern the registers of life and death. \"Symbol\" refers to the chariot of the symbolic wheel; the Perfected constantly ride these symbolic carriages, roaming the Three Realms to audit the records of beings’ lives and deaths, and to initiate those who cultivate the Dao.\n\n\"Xū\" means \"nurturing.\" It is the taboo name of the Heavenly Emperor, who presides as the Lord of Life-Measurement in the Southern Palace, refining and delivering decayed souls. \"Yuán\" means \"youth.\" It is the Youth Born at Midday, who pours divine fluid upon the heavenly and earthly beings. If one recites and chants the cavernous scriptures, their jade name enters the Emperor’s register, their life and death are delivered in the Southern Palace, the Four Poles bestow natural feathered chariots, and their seven ancestors rejoice in the Hall of Blessings.\n\nThe above sixty-four characters constitute the True Writ of the Eight Heavens of the East.\n\nThe Cavernous Floating of the Southern Crimson—*Héng* (恒), *Xīn-Mǎo* (辛卯), established in the month of *Wǔ*, during the Grain in Ear solar term.\n\nThe old commentary says: The \"Southern Crimson\" refers to the Flowing Fire Courtyard in the south, seventy thousand miles in breadth, its flying flames blazing across the eight directions. \"Cavernous Floating\" refers to the Cavernous Yang Palace, where the qi of flowing fire burns and floats. The jade pupils gleam brilliantly.\n\n*Dùn* (遁), *Rén-Chén* (壬辰).\n\nThe old commentary states: The \"jade pupils\" are the essence of flowing fire, which refines the body, generates jade radiance, and shines as brilliantly as the eyes. The Perfected of the Southern Culmen govern within the palace, and all those who first attain the Dao proceed to the Courtyard of Flowing Fire. The Perfected of the Southern Culmen washes and refines them with the fire’s essence, purging the dust and filth, whereupon they become companions to the Perfected. *Shēnshēn* (诜诜) means \"multitudinous.\"\n\nThe Dharma-body descends from emptiness,\n*Zhuàng* (壮), *Guǐ-Sì* (癸巳), at the full moon.\n\nThe old commentary states: The \"Dharma-body\" was the title of the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning during the Dragon Han kalpa. In the Crimson Clarity kalpa, he was called the Nameless Lord; in the Highest Sovereign’s kalpa, he was called the Primordial Venerable. The Dharma-qi transforms and manifests through kalpas, appearing as a single spirit without undergoing womb-birth. \"Descends from emptiness\" means the Primordial Beginning arises from emptiness.\n\nThe Nine Numinous Ones advance forward,\n*Jìn* (晋), *Jiǎ-Wǔ* (甲午), at the Summer Solstice, corresponding to the *Gòu* hexagram, on a waning-moon day, at the hour of *wǔ*.\n\nAs the first yin arises, cinnabar draws forth mercury. The *Scripture of Dragon and Tiger* says: \"When true yin stirs at *lí-wǔ*, the Red Water flows as mercury.\" True yin descends like the moon’s image, returning to the Central Palace; yin returns to the yang chamber, and mercury comes to merge with lead.\n\nThe old commentary states: The \"Nine Numinous Ones\" are the Nine Radiant Perfected of the Southern Palace. King Nine governs the dark lodges of the dead. \"Advance forward\" means the Perfected oversee the ledgers of destiny, calculating the merits of the dead from past lives.\n\nTranscribed in the Terrace of Transcendence,\n*Míngyí* (明夷), *Yǐ-Wèi* (乙未). *Zé* (泽) is pronounced *tuō*; *luò* (落) is also written as *@*, pronounced *hè*.\n\nThe old commentary states: *Zé* refers to the grottoes of the Heavenly Center Mountain, where dragons gather in yellow chambers. *Luò* is the inner name of the Perfected of the Dawn Dao Lord, who governs within the Yellow Chamber, enduring through the great kalpa without end and growing ever brighter through the Dragon Han kalpa. *Pú* (菩) is the hidden title of the Flying Celestial Perfected, numbering beyond count. *Tái* (台) is the Jade Terrace, located on the southern slope of Mount É.\n\nThe Verdant Net spans the great chiliocosm,\n*Jiārén* (家人), *Bǐng-Shēn* (丙申), in the month of *wèi*, at the Lesser Heat solar term.\n\nThe old commentary states: The \"Verdant Net\" is the celestial being of the moon, named Luó Yīnglǐ, who resides in the palace of the sun and moon, ascending to the Great Net Heaven. The Dharma-conduct qi governs the pivot of kalpic transformation, aligning with the numerology of heaven and earth and enduring until the great kalpa. Having received the union of sun and moon, one meets upon the Jade Terrace. \"Great chiliocosm\" refers to the enumeration of worlds. Master Lù says: Counting a thousand to a thousand makes a small chiliocosm; counting a thousand small chiliocosms makes a medium chiliocosm; counting a thousand medium chiliocosms makes a great chiliocosm. Those who recite and chant the Cavernous Writ shall ride the feathered-wheel chariot, ascend to the Yellow Chamber, wander above the Jade Terrace, and behold the realm of the great chiliocosm.\n\nThe Nine Uglies are obscure and vast,\n*Kuí* (睽), *Dīng-Yǒu* (丁酉).\n\nThe old commentary states: *Miǎo* (眇) means the jade script is veiled and not manifest, appearing faint and distant.\n\n\"Mǎng\" (莽) signifies that its script shines again, vast and boundless.\n\nWhen one encounters the true Dao, both men and women shall live for thirty-six thousand years. At the culmination of this cycle, after enduring one kalpa, the nine qi each give birth to a beast to harm the wicked. Once the kalpa unfolds, these nine beasts are called the Nine Uglies of ghosts. The Northern Emperor and the Perfected of the Upper Realm preside over the Register of Life and Death, thus establishing the Nine Uglies to assist the Three Officials. When the count reaches eighty-one myriad, at the convergence of heavenly qi, the Nine Uglies are fit to serve as aids, known as the Envoys of the Nine Capitals.\n\nThe *Sháo* hymns follow the *Yuán-Zhān* cycle.\n*Saì* (赛), *Wù-Xū* — at the Great Heat solar term, corresponding to the *Dùn* hexagram, the day aligns with the *Wèi* hour.\n\nThe old commentary states: *Sháo* is the inner name of the Celestial Sovereign of the *Huáng-Jiā* Heaven. The Celestial Sovereign of *Shén-Xiāo* is the spirit of the Demon King, who constantly tests those who study the Dao to discern whether they are upright or not, composing songs to disturb the human mind. Those with steadfast hearts are protected and recommended by the Sovereign, ascending to the *Huáng-Jiā* Heaven. *Yuán-Zhān* is the inner taboo name of the Northern and Southern Dipper Lords. When one accumulates good deeds, they are recorded by the Southern Dipper, which then delivers them from the tribulations of the Three Realms and the sufferings of the Nine Darks, notifying the Demon King below to refrain from harming or corrupting them. If one commits evil, the Three Officials list their sins before the Northern Dipper, which then instructs the Demon King below to extinguish their souls and consign them to the depths of the Nine Darks, where they toil in eternal night for ten thousand kalpas without end.\n\nAbove the Nine Capitals, *Jiě* (解), *Jǐ-Hài*.\nThe old commentary states: \"Above the Clouds\" is the inner taboo name of the Flying Celestial Divine King. At the dawn of the *Lóng-Hàn* kalpa, the *Chì-Míng* cycle was inaugurated, the spontaneous scriptures were bestowed, and the roots of heaven and earth were established. The Nine Capitals refer to the nine-tiered terrace that arose after the Three Images were divided, situated upon the Jade Capital Mountain, resplendent above the Mysterious Void. Flying celestial beings constantly scatter the fragrance of a hundred lotuses and strew the blossoms of the five clouds to behold the Flying Perfected. Upon the terrace stands the Jade Lad of the Great Perfected, who thrice daily waves the Ten Absolute Banners. With each revolution of the banners, the Divine Emperors of all heavens thrice circumambulate the Mysterious Terrace, chanting the Cavernous Writ in procession.\n\nThe flying ones ascend of their own accord.\n*Sun* (损), *Gēng-Zǐ*.\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: \"Flying Life\" refers to the divine being of renewed existence in the southern heavens. Should a scholar recite the Cavernous Writ, Flying Life shall open the path of deathlessness, pour forth the qi of enduring life, and refine the five souls below—thus the Eight Radiant Ones are preserved. *Qiān* denotes the Forest of Ascension. Once the body is raised together to ascend the Mysterious Terrace and wander beneath the Forest of Ascension, bearing the Celestial Writ and reciting the Cavernous Writ for twenty-four years, one may ascend to pay homage at the Mysterious Capital.\n\n*Na-Yu* is lush and fragrant.\n*Benefit* (Yì), *Xīn-Chǒu*.\nOn the day of *Jiàn-Shēn* in the month of *Lì-Qiū*.\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Na* is the esoteric name of the Heavenly King’s attendant. It governs the qi of heaven’s four seasons and the net of emptiness and non-action to rectify and pacify the celestial divisions. *Yu* is the name of the Heavenly Gate’s hollow wheel. *Yù-Fù* is the name of the numinous youth within the Dipper, who constantly turns the Wheel of Yu to summon the Perfected. When the Heavenly Gate revolves ten times, the great sages of the ten directions ascend to pay homage to the Jade Emperor, and all spirits assemble—whereupon *Yù-Fù* intones the rites.\nThe *Móluó* Dharma-Wheel.\n*Decisiveness* (Guài), *Rén-Yín*.\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Móluó* is the esoteric inner name of the Great Demon of Heaven. When *Yù-Fù* intones once, the Demon King binds his form. The adept who understands the arising of qi in the four seasons and the ten revolutions of the Gate enters the portal of the Dharma-Wheel, mounts the chariot to ascend to *Yù-Qīng*, and pays homage at the Terrace of the *Zǐ-Wēi*.\n\n*Hòng* holds the *Wú-Jìng*.\n*Gòu* (Yǐn), *Guǐ-Mǎo*.\nAt the *Chǔ-Shǔ* solar term, corresponding to the hexagram *Pǐ*, the day aligns with the *Shēn* hour. By the *Gēng* hour, it is called \"half a catty of water,\" when yin returns to the yang chamber, mercury comes to join lead, its essence resembling the mother, and white silver is formed.\n\nThe ancient scripture says:\n*The Primordial Lord first refined mercury,\nThe divine chamber held emptiness profound.\nMysterious white gave birth to Metal’s Duke—\nLofty, the first glimpse of the primal ground.*\n\nThis speaks of Metal returning to its original nature; only then may it be called the *Returned Elixir*.\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Hòng* is the inner name of the Celestial Capital’s supervisory spirit. *Holding* is the name of *Lóng-Yuān*. Within it coil the myriad dragons, bearing the golden infant to convey the blossom of the Eastern Well, ever irrigating the celestial perfected. *Wú-Jìng* is the radiance of the Flying Heavenly Divine King, issuing colorless light to govern the register of life and death, opening the path for those who cultivate the Dao.\n\n*Lǎn-Zī* moves with grace.\n*Cuì*, *Jiǎ-Chén*.\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Lǎn-Zī* is the name of the gate to the Three Realms. Should one know this title, the Divine King will open the palace of eternal night, rescue the souls from the nine depths of darkness, and guide them through the gate of the Three Realms.\n\n*Yùn-Róng* is the name of the Mysterious Harmony Jade Maiden. Once *Lǎn-Zī* is attained, *Yùn-Róng* employs the vermilion spirit-qi to guide it into form, while the fluid of Great Harmony irrigates the spirit, ascending to the Hall of Fortune and Virtue. *Fù-Lǎng* shines resplendent, *Kuò-Yì* soars—ascending on *Yǐ-Sì*.\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Fù-Lǎng* is another name for the Jade Capital Terrace in the midst of heaven. The Western Numinous Perfected constantly recites the cavernous scriptures while wandering above it. *Kuò-Yì* is the inner name of the Heavenly Divine Lord. Born together with the Primordial Beginning, he serves as the model of the mysterious qi, instructing those who study immortality. Should one comprehend the sounds of the eight characters, the Divine Lord will open the gate of eternal darkness, allowing ascent through the Gate of Renewed Life to mount the Jade Capital Terrace.\n\nThe divine tassel returns to the palace—*Kùn* on *Bǐng-Wǔ*. Established in the *Yǒu* month, at the White Dew node.\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: The *divine tassel* is the Purple Tenuity Numinous Youth, who presides over the dissolution of the corpse. Should one obtain the *divine tassel* and chant the boundless chapters, the form will return to the chamber of the Three Refinements, receive the qi of spontaneity, and rejoice in limitless longevity.\n\nThe above sixty-four characters constitute the true script of the Southern Eight Heavens.\n\n*Dāo-Lì* Chan practices—*Jǐng* on *Dīng-Wèi*.\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Dāo-Lì* is the name of the Southern Limitless World. Chan is the kingdom of *Dāo-Lì*, also called *Chán-Lí*. Within this kingdom lies the Cavernous Yang Palace and the Flowing Fire Court. The numinous script originates from the Flowing Fire; once refinement is complete and enlightenment attained, *Dāo-Lì* transforms into the Hall of Fortune and Virtue. *Yóu* is the inner name of the Southern Lord of Compassionate Life. All suffering souls are delivered to enter the Cavernous Yang Palace.\n\n*Pó-Ní-Gāu-Tōng*.\n\nAt *Gé*, *Wù-Shēn*—the Autumn Equinox—corresponds to the *Guān* hexagram, with the sun aligned at the *Yǒu* hour.\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Pó-Ní* is the numinous youth of the Fire-Refinement Pool. When one attains deliverance to the Cavernous Yang Palace, they proceed to the Fire Pool to undergo refinement and be reborn in the kingdom of Fortune and Virtue. *Gāu-Tōng* is the demonic spirit of the *Dāo-Lì* world, ever obstructing the path of human life. Yet when one knows the name of the Lord of Compassionate Life and approaches the numinous youth for refinement, they are born into the kingdom of Fortune and Virtue, and the demonic spirit submits. If one recites the sound of these eight characters, the limitless numinous officials of *Dāo-Lì* will guard their body, escorting them directly to the Southern Palace, where immortals shall receive them. Within three years, they will surely ride the cinnabar wheels of the celestial void, ascending to the heavens of the Three Qi.\n\n*Wǎn-Sǒu-Dí-Sè*, *Dǐng*, *Jǐ-Yǒu*.\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Wǎn-Sǒu* is the inner name of the Heavenly Emperor of the August Cliff. He presides over the opening of the scriptures of the Great Desert, illuminating the text of the eight characters. *Dí-Sè* is the flying immortal of the Form Realm, ever riding a chariot drawn by dragons, moving in and out of the Jade Purity, delivering the virtuous. The Hall of the Vast and Subtle, *Zhèn*, *Gēng-Xū*.\n\nThe *Zhèn* trigram is Wood, the Dragon, the transformative mechanism of Fire—its subtle principles of alternation and concealment were expounded earlier.\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: The Hall of the Vast and Subtle is the Hall of Transformative Generation. The transformations of the hollow void condense into natural patterns, vast and boundless, unfolding the destinies of the ten thousand beings. When a practitioner masters the sound of the eight characters, flying immortals descend in cloud chariots to bear them upward into the Hall of Transformative Generation.\n\n*Liú-Luó-Fàn-Méng*, *Gèn*, *Xīn-Hài*. Established in the tenth lunar month, at the Cold Dew node.\n\nThe *Gèn* trigram is Earth, the root of generation and completion, the foundation of creation and transformation—its profound meaning was elucidated earlier.\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Liú* is the inner name of the Heavenly King, who dwells above the Purple Empyrean, roaming the Jade Capital Mountain. *Luó* is the taboo name of the Moon Maiden, who presides over the rites of the royal excursions and feasts. *Fàn* is the name of a flying immortal, who governs the turning of the Nine Heavens’ gates. *Méng* is the Primordial Celestial Divinity, the root of the Supreme Wind’s origin.\n\n*Jǐng-Wèi-Xiāo-Yú*, *Jiàn*, *Rén-Zǐ*.\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Jǐng* is *Jǐnghuáng*, the Perfected One of the Four Poles above. *Wèi* is *Wèixiù*, the Immortal of Radiant Empyrean. Together, they govern the Jade Capital Terrace, ever traversing the long night to deliver the souls of good roots. *Xiāo* is *rèn*—the palace of the White Primordial Sovereign. *Yú* is the cove of *Xiāo-Rèn*, the place where guests are received. Those who constantly recite the cavernous scriptures may ride the nine-colored clouds to ascend the Terrace of *Jǐnghuáng*.\n\n*Yì-Miǎo-Wú-Jì*, *Guīmèi*, *Guǐ-Chǒu*. At the Frost Descent node, corresponding to the *Bō* hexagram, the hour aligns with *xū*.\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Yì-Miǎo* is the title of the Heavenly King of Filial Radiance. *Wú-Jì* is the Court of Emptiness and Stillness. It speaks of the Heavenly King coming from the Dragon Han, emerging in the Crimson Clarity, and dwelling within the Court of Emptiness and Stillness.\n\n*Wǎn-Shǒu-Shào-Dū*, *Fēng*, *Jiǎ-Yín*. The *Old Commentary* states: *Wǎn-Shǒu* is the inner name of the Supreme Dao Lord. The Dao Lord ever unfolds the profound mysteries of the Primordial Beginning, expounding the Great Dharma to deliver beings. *Shào-Dū* is the name of the Spirit Youth within the sun, who scatters solar essence to irrigate the true currents and scatters flying blossoms to brush away dust. Those who know the sound of these eight characters will have the Heavenly King descend in a chariot of radiant clouds, plow the Three Pristine Fields, deliver their person above the Three Realms, and enter the Court of Stillness.\n\n*Ā-Lán-Yù-Zhú*, *Lǚ*, *Yǐ-Mǎo*. The *Old Commentary* states: *Ā-Lán* is the hidden name of the Heavenly King, who constantly rides the wheel of Radiant Empyrean, roams the nine-tiered terraces, dwells in the Jade Tower, and chants the cavernous scriptures to subdue demon kings. *Yù* is *Mò-Yù*, the hidden name of the Demon King of Heaven’s Center. *Zhú* means desire—the Demon King’s capital is ever in the realm of *Kǎn*, chanting songs of emptiness.\n\n*Huá-Mò-Yán-Yóu*, *Xùn*, *Bǐng-Chén*. Established in the eleventh lunar month, at the Beginning of Winter node. *Xùn* is Wind. All things rely on its breath to grow, flourish, and bear fruit. Yin does not congeal without wind; Yang does not harmonize without wind. The *Book of Changes* says: \"Following the wind, *Xùn*.\" The noble one issues commands and acts—this is the principle of Yin and Yang in application.\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Huá* refers to the radiant splendor of the Form Realm. *Mò* refers to the vast and untraceable Desire Realm. *Yán* is the Court of Binding Demons; *Yóu* is the Chamber of Restraining Demons. When the Heavenly King ascends the Cloud Tower and chants the boundless scriptures, celestial demons respond by binding themselves, and all ghosts submit their forms at *Yóu*. Those who uphold this will see their nine ancestors prosper; those who cultivate it will have their ashen bones reborn.\n\n*Jiǔ-Kāi-Zì-Biàn*, *Duì*, *Dīng-Sì*. *Duì* is the Metal Tiger. Metal is the transformative mechanism of Water—its subtle principles of separation and concealment were explained earlier.\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Jiǔ-Kāi-Zì-Biàn* refers to the Great Expansion’s beginning, when Heaven and Earth were not yet sealed. The revolving Three *Qi* opened into nine divisions. Once the nine degrees were clarified, the nine positions were arrayed, and the ten thousand kinds of Yin and Yang could then arise, naturally discerning and distinguishing.\n\n*Ā-Nà-Pǐn-Shǒu*, *Huàn*, *Wù-Wǔ*. At the Lesser Snow node, corresponding to the *Kūn* hexagram, the hour aligns with *hài*.\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Ā* is the inner name of the Heavenly King of *Ā-Qiū*, who constantly drives a dragon chariot, ascends the peaks of Dragon Mountain, and roams within the Nine Mysteries. *Nà* is the hidden name of the Flying Immortal *Nà-Xié*, who traverses the Three Realms, reviews the long night, and skillfully delivers the souls of the good. Those who know the sound of these eight characters will have the Heavenly King grade and deliver their person, transform their withered bones, and restore the countenance of a youth.\n\n*Wú-Liàng-Fú-Gài*, *Jié*, *Jǐ-Wèi*. The *Old Commentary* states: *Wú-Liàng* is the Primordial Spirit of the Boundless Great Sage, who governs all flying immortals, all of whom receive their grades and promotions from him. *Fú* is the inner name of the True Person of Regeneration, who ever reviews the records of the long night and examines the roots of good and evil. *Gài* is the title of the Blessed Hall within the Mysterious.\n\n*Fú-Luó-Hé-Shén*, *Zhōng-Fú*, *Gēng-Shēn*. The *Old Commentary* states: *Fú* refers to the delivered souls of the deceased, received by the True Person. *Luó* is the Great Net—opening the realms of the Great Thousand, summoning the guests of regeneration, and proceeding to the Heaven of the Great Net to fix their registers and erase death. *Hé* is union with blessings; *Shén* is the Divine Duke, the prime minister of the Great Net. Those who know the sound of these eight characters will unite with the Divine Duke in blessings, be delivered as guests of regeneration—hence it is called *Hé-Shén*.\n\n*Yù-Dàn-Cháng-Sāng*, *Xiǎo-Guò*, *Xīn-Yǒu*. Established in the twelfth lunar month, at the Great Snow node. The *Old Commentary* states: *Yù-Dàn* is the name of the Jade Capital in the Heaven of *Tán-Shì*. *Cháng-Sāng* is the Heavenly *Qiān* Grove, also called Mulberry Grove.\n\n*Bǎi-Kōng-Dù-Xiān*, *Jì-Jì*, *Rén-Xū*.\n\nWhen *Jì-Jì* is achieved, cinnabar is formed. Mercury responds to the qi of lead and congeals into cinnabar. *Kǎn* is lead; *Lí* is mercury. When water and fire achieve *Jì-Jì*, *Kǎn* and *Lí* unite to manifest the image of cinnabar. The *Old Commentary* states: The *Qiān* Grove shades the Eastern Florescence Palace, its leaves bearing the script of the Great Cavern—purple writings in jade characters, resplendent in the Upper Clarity. Below stands the Fusang Tree; above, the dense thickets of *Qiān* Wood. Azure fowl sing beneath its canopy, while verdant mists crown its peaks. Divine winds stir the fragrant grasses, and the Mulberry Grove sets forth the music of a hundred pipes. With a single gust of the divine wind, the cavern script becomes sound—hence it is called *Bǎi-Kōng-Dù-Xiān*. Flying celestial perfected ones examine those who study immortality, delivering the souls of the Nine Glooms. The preceding sixty-four characters constitute the true script of the Western Eighth Heaven.\n\n*Jué-Wú-Zì-Yù*, *Wèi-Jì*, *Guǐ-Hài*—the last day of the lunar month. *Wèi-Jì* is mercury. Water and fire remain apart; mercury has not yet formed cinnabar. *Lí* and *Kǎn* return to their origin, and mercury regains its fundamental nature. The *Old Commentary* states: *Jué-Wú* was a flying celestial spirit of the *Lóng-Hàn* era. From the primal qi of the original beginning, within the formless expanse of the primordial chaos, *Jué-Wú* emerged borne by the turning of the cosmos, coagulating qi to take form. Once the *Xiāo* Heaven was established, it endured through the unending kalpas. *Yù* is the inner name of the Heavenly King of *Xiāo* Heaven. Nine suns guide *Qián*. *Qián*...\n\n*Qián* is the beginning of the ten thousand things, the spontaneous void of nature. The pure essence of the true unity of qi is called *Empty Qi*. The golden embryo is likened to silver plating: when father and mother unite in essence, the responsive attachment forms the embryo, concealed within the kidneys—this is called the *Original Spirit*. As the unified qi transforms and returns to the Central Palace, it becomes the *Elixir Mother*; through the cyclical movement of metal and fire, it reverts to its origin—this is silver.\n\n*Metal* is the spontaneous qi of prior heaven. *Metal* is the embryo. *Fire* is the yang qi of daily life and generation. Though they emerge as one with different names, forming substance and function, they are not originally two things.\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: The nine refers to the Heavenly King of *Yù* riding the elephant-wheel chariot, roaming the Nine Dark Gates, turning the Nine Celestial Mechanisms, and responding to the kalpa’s appointed time. The *sun* refers to the Sun Lad within heaven, guiding and harmonizing qi. When the Sun Lad reaches the end of heaven’s movement, he halts his radiance to deliver the adept, bathing them in the essence of the *Water Mother*, guiding them with the qi of *Great Harmony*, refining the Five Spirits, and entering the Vermilion Palace. The *Mother of Kūn* covers the east—*Kūn*.\n\n*Kūn* is the completion of the ten thousand transformations.\n\nAfter the adept receives the embryo, the spirit conceals itself within the kidneys—this is called the *Kun* Palace. It is termed *nature*, and called *lead*; the mechanism of transformation returns to the Central Palace. This mechanism is the yang qi of daily arising and generation. As the foundation of the elixir and the ancestor of medicine, it is called *primordial essence*; gathering and refining cinnabar and mercury, it forms the substance of the elixir.\n\nNow, in the workings of creation, existence arises from the primordial, and so *Kun* is established through *Qian*, while *Qian* is completed through *Kun*. *Qian* and *Kun* mutually generate and complete one another, with no before or after. As Yi Chuan said: \"Creation has no beginning; yin and yang have no origin.\" It is like the principle by which lead arises from silver, and silver is completed by lead.\n\nAccording to the *Daoist Scriptures*: \"These two emerge as one with different names.\" Why then do the ancient perfected and supreme sages, in elucidating the principles of things and clarifying the workings of creation, forcibly employ lead, silver, cinnabar, and mercury as metaphors for the elixir’s mysteries? It is simply to make it easier for later generations to understand.\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: The *Kun* Mother is the Great Yin’s capital, the Ninefold Spirit Mother. She governs the abyss of the Eastern Sea’s Fusang and Yang Valley, ever controlling the earth’s mechanism, turning the wheel of primordial qi, and corresponding above to the Celestial Pass. When the Celestial Pass turns and the earth’s mechanism moves, the heavens complete one revolution, and the waters surge forth in thirty-three hundred degrees. When the qi of heaven and earth intermingle, the nine seas merge into one, and the waters fill the sky.\n\nThe *east* refers to the Eastern Sea, the meeting point and controlling source of the river’s origin. *Covering* means the Water Spirit governs Kunlun Mountain, filling and securing the vast sea, blocking the Eastern Well—thus the earth’s mechanism does not leak, and the kalpa’s long preservation is ensured. Its form gathers the Upper Mystery.\n\n*Tun* (屯)\n*Jiazi* (甲子): The Winter Solstice node, corresponding to the *Fu* hexagram, the new moon, and the hour of *zi*. The yang qi’s wondrous workings arise from the *Kun* Palace as the first yang returns. The ancient scriptures say: \"The yang qi’s black emanation arises from *Kun*; the sundial points to the southern pole, the five stars align in a string, and the sun and moon form a jade bi.\" It also says: \"When the metal essence undergoes its first transformation, the Azure Dragon receives the talisman, and the yang line is the pool.\" True yang ascends like the image of the sun. Upon reaching the Central Palace, the Metal Mother gathers and refines it—this is called *cinnabar*. *Cinnabar* is wood; wood is the dragon. This is the Azure Dragon receiving the talisman.\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Gathering form* refers to the time of calamitous conjunction, when the *Kun* Mother’s form emerges above the Eastern River, summoning the Bird Mother with a phoenix chariot to welcome the adept ascending to the wastes of Kunlun. The Bird Mother is the spirit overseeing water. *Above* means the *Kun* Mother ascends to the Celestial Lord to report the kalpa’s appointed time, delivering the adept and inscribing their name in the Dark Capital.\n\n*Tuoluo Yumiao* (陀罗育邈)\n*Yichou* (乙丑)\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Tuo* is the inner name of the Celestial Emperor, born together with the Miao Cheng Heaven on the Cloud Ridge. *Luo* is the name of the moon at its first appearance. *Tuo* dwells above the Cloud Ridge, embracing the moon to illuminate it. *Yu* is the name of the Divine King, who governs the ten directions and the flying gods of heaven. *Miao* is the name of the celestial overseer of the Feathered Forest. The Divine King constantly commands the guardians of the Three Realms, reviewing the registers of human life and death, and ordering the demon kings to protect and deliver those who attain the Dao.\n\n*Miao qi* merges with the clouds.\n\n*Xu* (需)\n*Bingyin* (丙寅): The month of *jianchou*, the Lesser Cold node.\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Miao qi* refers to the adept, having been delivered and protected, ascending to the Feathered Forest overseer to receive the talisman and ascend to heaven, traveling the subtle qi of the clouds. *Merging* means merging with the luminous essence. Once entering the Feathered Forest, they weave cloud qi into garments and then ascend together with the heavens, merging with the luminous essence.\n\n*The Great Ugly of Flying Heaven* (飞天大丑)\n*Dingmao* (丁卯)\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Flying Heaven* refers to the flying mystery of qi, forming the scripture of the Cavernous Void. The Flying Heaven Divine King constantly recites it to receive the adept. *Great* refers to the Three Realms’ comprehensive register, governing the charts of life and death. *Ugly* means elder. He is the great demon of the Three Realms, serving the Great Ugly. If the adept recognizes the sound of the eight characters, the demon kings protect their authenticity, and their body ascends to the Three Clarities.\n\n*Overseeing the heavens above*.\n\n*Shi* (师)\n*Wuchen* (戊辰): The Greater Cold node, corresponding to the *Lin* hexagram, and the hour of *chou*.\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Overseeing* refers to the official who governs the Flying Heavens, constantly gathering the qi of the eight assemblies to preserve the heavens’ and earth’s movements, supervising the officials of the long night, and delivering the souls of the dark. If one knows the sounds of heaven, the celestial demons arrange their words, the Great Ugly records the immortal ranks, and they ascend to the Forbidden Upper Heavens.\n\n*The Kalpa Measure of Shatuo* (沙陀劫量)\n*Jisi* (己巳)\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Sha* refers to the Purple Tenuity’s separate palace, the Shalan Palace within the Constant Fusion Heaven. *Tuo* refers to the multitudes of Tuoqiu, numbering in the hundreds of millions, all newly delivered and attaining the Dao, their merits incomplete, dwelling scattered within the palace. *Kalpa Measure* means that with each transition of the kalpa’s movement, the multitudes of Tuoqiu have their merits and virtues assessed, ascending to the Vermilion Mound Palace to receive blessings and become immortals.\n\n*The Radiant Brilliance of Longhan* (龙汉瑛鲜)\n*Xiaoxu* (小畜)\n*Gengwu* (庚午)\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Longhan* is the name of the primordial kalpa. *Ying* refers to the Flying Celestial Deities of the Longhan era, who constantly deliver the souls of the departed, ascending them to the Shalan Palace. *Xian* refers to the youths of the Southern Palace. When disciples attain deliverance, the *Xian* youths refine their countenance.\n\n*The Azure Vault and Floating Li*\n*Biluo Fuli*\n*Xinwei* (辛未)\n*Establishing the first lunar month, the Beginning of Spring solar term.*\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Bi* refers to the jade-green radiance of the *qi* perpetually born in the Jade Capital Heaven. *Luo* is the name of the Flying Celestial Deities in the void. Thrice daily, they guide the multitudes of celestial sages to ascend and pay court at the Seven Treasures Palace. *Fuli* is the inner name of the Heavenly King. When the multitudes of sages ascend to pay court, the Heavenly King proclaims his jubilation. The *Dongzhang* further states: *\"Soaring triumphant, the Azure Youths ride the clouds; the Luo-net gleams upon the Supreme Mystery.\"* Truly, these are not merely the names of deities.\n\n*The Treasured Song of the Void*\n*Ta*\n*Renshen* (壬申)\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Kong* is the name of the celestial attendants who serve the dawn. *Ge* refers to the melodies of the *Dongzhang*. When the attendants of the dawn emit a single cry, the numinous winds begin to play, and the music forms the *Dongzhang*. Thus, it is called *\"The Treasured Song of the Void.\"* When disciples comprehend the sounds of these eight characters, they ascend to the Southern Palace as guests among the Flying Celestial Deities. They preserve this kalpa without end and treasure the natural patterns of its scripture; thus, it is called *\"preserving the treasure.\"*\n\n*The Unranked Evil Yi*\n*Pi*\n*Guiyou* (癸酉)\n*The Rain Water solar term, corresponding to the hexagram* Tai*, with the sun aligned in the hour of* Yin*.*\n\n*Tai* signifies the union of Heaven and Earth, from which all things are born. By the hour of *Shen*, it is called *\"half a catty of gold.\"* The Dragon and Tiger intertwine, yin and yang unite in kind. The ancient scripture states: *\"Yin and yang intermingle; essence and fluid envelop the primordial qi. The ten thousand images arise from the void, each responding to its kind through resonance.\"* This is the sign of the sacred embryo’s formation.\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Eyi* (also written as *Yi*) is the inner name of the Heavenly King. In the Longhan kalpa of old, all karmic conditions were exhausted. Having transcended the Three Realms, they ascended to the Pavilion of the Great Void, received the register of the Nine Immortals, and attained the title of Great Sage.\n\nWhen the Kalpa of Red Clarity and Renewed Fortune dawned, the Primordial Beginning bestowed upon him the title of Brahmā-Steadfast Heavenly King.\n\n*Wu* signifies the Supreme Non-Being Perfected One. This Perfected One, dwelling in the Heavenly King’s palace, delivers the souls of the Long Night. *Pin* denotes the weighing of the dark souls’ sins and blessings.\n\n*\"Penetrating subtlety arises from the real.\"*\n\n*Fellowship*\n*Jiaxu*\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *\"Penetrating subtlety arises from the real\"* means that the Supreme Non-Being Perfected One delivers the souls of the Nine Netherworlds, thoroughly discerning their past lives. All evil conditions are exhausted, and they are guided into the hall of wondrous transformation. *Zi* means *\"with.\"* With the Flying Immortals, they merge into the real.\n\n*\"The Primordial Brahmā’s vast expanse\"*\n*Dahuo*\n*Yihai*\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: The *Primordial Brahmā* refers to the qi of the Primordial Beginning’s great Brahmā wind and marsh, which uplifts and clarifies the essence of the Han River. Lofty, it pervades the floating void; suspended, it never falls. *Vast expanse* means distant yet unimpeded, existent yet as if non-existent, subtle yet indescribable, wondrous yet untraceable.\n\nDelivering beings in profound stillness.\n*Humility*\n*Bingzi*\n*Establishing the third month, Awakening of Insects*\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Profound stillness* means dark and silent, beyond hearing or seeing. Within it lies the real; within the real lies essence. In darkness, the Heavenly Ones are delivered.\n\nThe Heavenly Perfected Sovereign said: The inner sounds of the heavens, the spontaneous jade scriptures, are all formed from the qi of soaring mystery, uniting the sounds of the five directions. They arise above the Primordial Beginning and emerge within the empty vastness. Their texts are profound and intricate, difficult to trace in detail. The Heavenly Worthy, in reward and exhortation, commands their meanings to be expounded.\n\nThe Daoist regulations have their decrees, and none dare disobey the mandate. When taking up the brush, the spirit soars to the Great Empyrean, refining both essence and coarse matter to the utmost of one’s heart and thought.\n\nOnce the August Way is made manifest, the myriad heavens rejoice in celebration. Those who treasure it receive the descent of Perfected Ones; those who cultivate it attain promotion in rank. Its majestic numen is vast and boundless, defying all description.\n\nThe above sixty-four characters constitute the *True Writ of the Eight Heavens of the North*.\n\nThe Dao declares: These are the great Brahmā’s hidden words and the boundless sounds within the heavens. The hidden words are the names of the Heavenly Thearchs, concealed and not revealed. The boundless sounds are the *True Cavern Chapters*, whose natural resonance pervades all heavens.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The great Brahmā’s hidden words and boundless sounds are formed from the spontaneous coagulation of wondrous qi. All the principles of Heaven and Earth reside within them. Void and solid interpenetrate, images and numbers become visible. When guided by the nine days to deduce the Qian hexagram, no principle remains unilluminated.\n\nThat Qian begins in the north signifies yang’s birth at *zi*. *Jiazi* is paired with Qian, and *zi* corresponds to the Yellow Bell, hence *jiazi* commences at the winter solstice. The *Han Records* state: Fu Xi’s composition of the *Yijing* marked the inception of yang qi, establishing it as the standard for pitch. The day of the winter solstice is governed by the Yellow Bell, the origin of sound and qi.\n\nThe *Collected Essentials of the Imperial Dynasty* states: In antiquity, the Yellow Bell was the root of all affairs. From this perspective, the nine days guiding the Qian position mark the beginning of Brahmā qi and the inception of *jiazi*. As this qi spreads, the myriad beings are equally nourished. The four seasons and their transformations—how could they lie outside the Way of this hidden-qi language? Creation itself operates thus.\n\nThe elixir of return follows the body’s cultivation of the great Brahmā. Within its hidden words are contained the Four Symbols, Five Phases, Three Origins, Eight Trigrams, sun and moon, dragon and tiger, cinnabar and mercury, lead and silver—all culminating in the *Yin Talisman*. Fire times, gentle nurturing, extraction, and replenishment depend on the hexagrams’ qi ascending and descending, the cyclical flow of *jiazi*. Without these, one gropes in vain for a standard.\n\nThus, the four hexagrams Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li represent Heaven, Earth, sun, and moon, encompassing the myriad things as the crucible, vessel, medicine, and pivot of the root. The remaining sixty hexagrams correspond to the *jiazi* cycle, aligning with the seasons, shifting through cold and heat, dividing into the twenty-four qi, and subdividing into the seventy-two seasonal markers. The nodes of the twelve months are condensed into a single month; the markers of a month are embedded within the twelve hours of a day and night. One fixes the water clock, corrects the sundial, clarifies *zi* and *wu*, regulates yin and yang, harmonizes darkness and dawn, unites dragon and tiger, follows the great reckoning of Heaven and Earth, and accords with the transformative mechanism of yin and yang.\n\nThus, the hexagrams comprise three hundred eighty-four lines, and each line contains three hundred eighty-four *zhu*. Thereby, the myriad transformations arise from the void. Is it the void that gives birth to me, or I who give birth to the void? The principle of the great Brahmā—how vast is its Way!\n\nThe ancient script was a full *zhang* in length. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign of old inscribed its text to establish the correct pronunciation. The original hidden words, each character a *zhang* wide, bore eight-pointed rays. During the Dragon Han era, the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign transcribed and annotated them.\n\nThose who know their sounds and can fast and recite them will have the flying Heavenly Deva-Kings descend to observe their person, record their merit and diligence, and report to the heavens. The myriad spirits will pay homage, earth deities will attend at the gate, and the Great Merit Demon-Kings will sponsor their promotion. Once the Dao of the Upper Immortals is complete, they may roam the Three Realms and ascend through the Golden Gate.\n\nThis sound repels all, dispels all, delivers all, and accomplishes all—it is the natural sound of the Heavenly Perfected Ones.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: This boundless sound can repel and expel all demonic spirits, dissolve and avert all calamities, deliver and liberate all from birth and death, and bring to fruition all heavenly and human endeavors. Thus, it is called the *Heavenly Perfected Numinous Writ* and the *Natural Jade Characters*.\n\nAs for the Way of the Golden Elixir, it is the great Brahmā’s spontaneous primordial essence and wondrous qi, uniting with the void and merging with non-being. Those who cultivate it are observed by the myriad heavens, silently aided by the ten thousand spirits. When merit is complete and the Dao perfected, they will surely attain immortality.\n\nThe term *elixir* denotes union with the void and merging with non-being—it is fundamentally without form or substance. Those who speak falsely claim it is as large as a pellet and red as a tangerine—how utterly mistaken! They know not what the Golden Elixir truly is.\n\nTo say it is neither existent nor non-existent is also incorrect; to say it is sometimes existent and sometimes non-existent is likewise wrong; to say it is neither existent nor non-existent is still amiss. Yet if this is so, what then is it?\n\nThe Golden Elixir lodges in things to reveal its substance yet adorns things without form.\n\nWhat does it mean to *lodge in things to reveal its substance*? Thus, the *Scripture of Purity* states: The Great Dao is formless yet gives birth to Heaven and Earth—though the Dao is formless, Heaven and Earth reveal its form. The Great Dao is passionless yet moves the sun and moon—though the Dao is passionless, the sun and moon reveal its passion. The Great Dao is nameless yet nurtures the myriad things—though the Dao is nameless, the myriad things reveal its name.\n\nWhat does it mean to *adorn things without form*? Inwardly observe the heart: the heart has no heart—it is unattached. Thus, outwardly observe form: form has no form—it is not possessed. Thus, distantly observe things: things have no things—they are unimpeded. Thus, when this void is seen, the elixir’s Way unites with the void and merges with non-being, leaving no residue.\n\nAll arises from the body’s natural spontaneity, not through forced action. Hence, the great Brahmā’s hidden words are called the natural sound of the Heavenly Perfected Ones. Therefore, they can repel all, dispel all, deliver all, and accomplish all.\n\nIn harmony with the *Great Change*, aligned with *jiazi*, they complete creation and unite with the Golden Elixir.\n\n*Repels all* means eternal separation from all existence.\n*Dispels all* means illumination and function are all empty.\n*Delivers all* means transcending birth and death.\n\n*Accomplishes all* means the creation of Heaven and Earth. To speak briefly of the great is sufficient, for the small may then be inferred.\n\nThus, when one recites it, the flying immortals descend to observe below, the Celestial Emperor sings from afar, the myriad spirits pay homage, the Three Realms attend in reverence, the host of demons bow their heads, and ghostly essences vanish of themselves. The jade tablets and golden script resound—hence \"jewel-like tones.\" The recitation and chanting of the pivotal verses—hence \"vibrant resonance.\" The ten directions grow solemn and pure, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks swallow the mist, the ten thousand spirits tremble in submission, and the assembly of immortals is summoned.\n\nWhen this is recited, the jade groves shake with celestial music, the ten directions bask in the radiance of the Three Luminaries, rivers and seas still their winds and waves, mountains and peaks inhale the clouds and mist, the ten thousand spirits are subdued in awe, and the host of immortals gathers at one’s chamber.\n\nHeaven is free of defiling vapors, Earth is free of demonic dust. Heaven is without the qi of defilement; Earth is without the calamity of demonic dust.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: When merit is complete and conduct perfected, when the Dao is achieved and virtue established, one ascends to observe the records of merit below. The Celestial Emperor sings from afar in praise. The myriad spirits pay homage in reverence. The Three Realms attend as guardians. The host of demons bow their heads, and demonic thieves submit. Ghostly essences perish of themselves, and corpse-worms are extinguished. The jewel-like tones resound—this is spontaneous resonance. The ten directions grow solemn and pure—utterly unadulterated. Rivers and seas fall silent—nature and emotion merge in darkness. Mountains and peaks swallow the mist—spirit and breath settle into stillness. The ten thousand spirits tremble in submission—the multitude of sages stand in awe. The assembly of immortals is summoned—none but the true are gathered. Heaven is free of defiling vapors—yang is without transgression. Earth is free of demonic dust—yin is without concealment. Dark wisdom illumines the pure—vast and profoundly mysterious.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: This reveals the inner sound of the heavens, the power of dark penetration and luminous insight. *Dark* means profound and unfathomable; *wisdom* means illumination without limit. Wisdom can illuminate the void—hence \"dark wisdom.\" Lofty without end is called *illuminating*; radiant throughout the Three Clarities is called *pure*. *Illuminating* is emptiness; *pure* is stillness. Boundless and limitless is called *vast capacity*. Within this vast capacity, only true emptiness exists. Within the true lies essence; within essence lies sincerity. It can generate true sages, neither existing nor non-existing, eternally serene and subtle beyond measure. To exhaust its principle is impossible. Within the mysterious lies yet deeper mystery—hence \"profoundly mysterious.\"\n\nThe Most High, in compassion for the lower realms, bestowed this true scripture, arranging it in mysterious statutes to open the way for beings and deliver creatures. Those who recite and chant it move the heavens above, who revere and embrace its sacred text. As their qi reaches its destination, merit is perfected and conduct fulfilled, and they ascend as ministers of the Golden Towers. Thus, through accumulated study, one penetrates the true and enters sagehood, born in Heaven or born on Earth, with limitless application. Those who know the sound of the jade script will one day ascend with flesh and bone together. Scholars of the highest learning, strive diligently.\n\nAt the beginning of the Heavenly Worthy’s discourse, creation is spoken of at the outset; at the end, the Great Brahmā is spoken of in conclusion. This is how its essence and function cycle endlessly. Fearing that learners may not awaken to the principle of constant purity and stillness, falling into the views of clinging to existence or non-existence, the scripture clearly proclaims: *Dark wisdom illumines the pure, vast and profoundly mysterious.*\n\n*Dark* means uniting with the void and merging with non-being; *wisdom* means perfect clarity and wondrous insight; *illuminating* means penetrating without obstruction; *pure* means limpid and formless. *Vast capacity* means all-embracing and beyond measure; *profoundly mysterious* means wondrous within the wondrous, beyond conception.\n\nThus, when speaking of dragon and tiger, one does not stagnate in manipulating essence and spirit; when discussing nature and destiny, one does not lean toward clinging to emptiness and quiescence. The ten directions are thoroughly permeated, and all eight sides are transparent. As the scripture says: *Use its light, return to its clarity*—this is the meaning.\n\nThe Dao’s relation to humanity is no less than a loving mother’s care for her infant: it shelters and sustains, gives life and nurtures. Even to the point of dividing its body and descending into the world, it establishes the warp and weft, orders ruler and subject, rectifies high and low, provides sustenance in life and burial in death. For those who stand out from the multitude, it remains with them from beginning to end. As for those who follow the world with flowery eyes, fear death, and seek immortality, it perfects them according to their learning and merit. Not a single good deed is overlooked—this may be called the ultimate.\n\nIf people could embody the Dao, all would be like the people of Huai and Getian, without need for scriptures to emerge or teachings to be established. Yet because of their lack of benevolence, I have this scripture, and thus the teachings arise, and thus they are established. Hence, there are the retributions of Heaven and Hell—this is but a provisional means to encourage good and punish evil.\n\nSome say that with death, all ends—what else could there be? Heaven and Hell are both unreal. Such words may be penetrating, but what can be done about them? Now, after a person dies, they may appear in dreams, be seen, speak through others, or possess objects and manifest numinosity. From this, it cannot be said that with death, all ends—what else could there be? The pure caverns of spirit, the tranquil halls of the clear, the burial of white bones, the gloom of the watery prisons—these cannot be dismissed as unrealities of Heaven and Hell.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy says: *Before beings awaken, there are karmic conditions; once beings awaken, where are the karmic conditions? Heaven and Hell—who is not a temporary convergence? These are all created by the human mind. How can one sweepingly deny cause and effect?*\n\nThe Most High ever excels at saving, yet people do not love the Dao. Thus, the scripture admonishes the worldly, urging them not to misuse their minds, to return to their nature and darken their emotions, to abandon evil and follow good. At the highest, one may transcend the ordinary and enter sagehood; next, one may dissolve transformations and ascend to the true; next, one may withdraw and attain long life. Below, one may extend years in peace and joy, never losing human form across lifetimes, nurturing the root of nature until one also attains the immortal Dao. Compared to those afflicted by illness, bound by suffering, cut off in youth, endangered, dying unnaturally, or sinking into evil destinies—who gains and who loses? The discerning will surely choose wisely.\n\nThe Celestial Qi’s Mysterious and Vast Heavenly Treasure: The Spontaneous Eightfold Harmonies\n*Lower Scroll of the Numinous Writ of Primordial Commencement*\nComposed by the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign\n\n**Postface Exegesis** states:\nAccording to careful examination, *The Wondrous Scripture of the Upper Chapters on Salvation through the Numinous Treasure* was bestowed upon Emperor Wu of Han during the Yuanfeng era by the descent of the Queen Mother of the West, marking the seventh transmission. Between transmissions, the lineage remained obscure, with only this single chapter surviving among the celestial scrolls’ vast ranks. By the Jin dynasty, the Immortal Duke of the Left Palace of the Great Ultimate in Shangyu of Kuaiji, moved by the revelation of the Perfected Xu Laile of the Great Ultimate, received *The Scripture of Salvation*, which included *The Lower Scroll of the Numinous Writ* and *The Postface of the Perfected of the Great Ultimate*. These were conferred upon the assembled immortals, gathering the texts of their final dispersal to form a complete corpus. Thereafter, due to the ravages of war and fire, Ge Hong of the *Baopuzi* received the transmission from the Perfected Zheng Siyuan, though it extended no further than the *Great Measure of the Mysterious Mysterious*. The Lower Scroll was lost, rendering it irrecoverable, and thus the world lacked the complete scripture, unattainable in its entirety.\n\nNow, as the propitious fortune flows and celestial officials descend, the missing text is appended to the scripture’s end. Those who recite and chant it attain the wondrous model of the original scripture’s two chapters and three scrolls; those who cultivate and apply it fulfill the full merit of the ten transgressions and ten directions. Through fasting and observance, one may ascend to the Upper Clarity.\n\n*The Scripture of the Five Teeth* states:\nThe Heavenly Perfected Sovereign’s origins in the Dao remain unknown, yet he was one who perfected the ultimate Dao through cultivation in a prior kalpa. His stature measured nine feet, his body covered in dark fur, each strand over a foot long. During the Yellow Emperor’s reign, he dwelled beneath the Absolute Yin of Mount Emei, his abode wrought of azure jade, his seat of yellow gold. Banners of patterned silk fluttered, and the fragrance of thousand-fold harmony burned. Attended by immortal youths and jade maidens, with three seated guests, all styled as Perfected Kings of the Great Clarity, the Yellow Emperor bowed twice to inquire of the Dao and was granted the texts of the *Five Teeth* and *Three Ones*.\n\n**Eastern Eight Heavens:**\nForest-dense clouds amass, nine souls refine essence.\n*Jimo* gazes through jade rings, floating plumes and pestles.\nDeer benches and willow chambers, azure vines coil and return.\nPool depths bear burdens, crawling creatures retreat and advance.\n*Zaozhang* transforms jade, orchid pools shatter jade.\nVast surges wild-born, utmost within Kun’s clarity.\nRadiance unfolds through cavernous drought, silence without the faintest congealment.\nWhite leans on the empty net, the august reaches the primordial numen.\n\n**Southern Eight Heavens:**\nFlaming forges in spacious halls, the Great Empyrean’s jasper corners.\nThrough distant tides, offerings ripple, encircling seals add diagrams.\nTraversing towering paths, *gudan* and *hundu* merge.\nHalberds of artemisia blaze, wells deceive with rushes.\nPalms maintain constricted rites, luminous brilliance cascades.\nCarved threads augment but, the subtle and minute complete thunder.\nTiny streams fill the east, crimson radiance thickens.\nJade mystery evolves lords, cypress jade attains the compass.\n\n**Western Eight Heavens:**\nRefined rectitude veers left, *Poni* slays the numinous.\nSorrow summons balanced borders, extending southward to entwine the *Kui*.\nTranquil Yi diminishes light, the Primordial Awakens to conditions.\nThe Dao guards distant peaks, silk’s征 knows proclamation.\nThe Great Numen submerges in desert, radiant harmony follows *Lusui*.\nWise capitals bloom eternally, ruins and sands harden.\nChestnut bells cast out stocks, assemblies extend to *Qiupei*.\nEminent clouds of the Azure Mansion, karma beholds *Banji*.\n\n**Northern Eight Heavens:**\nHollow children embrace sweetness, jade eaves of nine gates.\nReeds and hooks stir ripples, dragon’s *Fen* guards the numinous pass.\nDitches and abysses dissolve demons, vast barbarians pray for passage.\nMysterious desolation’s vast breath, the unknowing indulge in clarity.\nPythons cultivate auspicious evenings, fragrant altars mark the fields.\nHot springs spread prosperity, not mediocrity but reverent aid.\nMorning tranquility and sagely generosity, secret methods expand fittingly.\nThe Vast Emperor governs life, guards the grand inception of humanity.\n\n**Postface Exegesis** states:\nThis resembles the cryptic language of the Middle Scroll, lacking the Heavenly Perfected’s inner teachings found therein. Yet the Eastern character *sen* (森) derives from wood, the Southern *yan* (炎) from fire, the Western *hao* (镐) from metal, and the Northern *wa* (洼) from water and earth. Water and earth both flourish in the North, and the character *hai* (孩) combines *hai* (亥) and *zi* (子), surely relating to the wondrous principles of Heaven and Earth’s creation. Only those who attain the Dao may thoroughly comprehend these profound words.\n\nThe Heavenly Perfected Sovereign’s *Celestial Qi’s Mysterious and Vast Heavenly Treasure: The Spontaneous Eightfold Harmonies* governs the governance of worldly kalpas, earthly ramparts, vast marshes, calamities, and dire adversities. Those who recite it dispel demonic misfortunes, purify the Dao’s qi, and find all tranquility. Earth officials present the writ, the hundred spirits revere and respect it, divine vermilion transcribes the text, and wearing or bearing it yields evident efficacy. Applied to the utmost study, it is not proclaimed to the vulgar below.\n\n**The Perfected of the Great Ultimate’s Hymn** states:\nDivine clouds gleam in layered voids, the Brahma-net gathers in azure skies.\nPrimordial Commencement’s nine dragons draw the chariot, the Sovereign reins the azure carriage.\nNuminous light gathers the myriad Perfected, pearl shadows open the sun’s desolation.\nRevealing the Numinous Treasure’s scroll, blessings and virtue thereby summoned.\nThe Cavernous Mystery conceals lofty solemnity, jade tones ripple like cloud-borne zithers.\nThe Immeasurable defies contemplation, the Dao’s ocean births waves and billows.\nDharma principles flow like rivulets, nurturing and cultivating fine sprouts.\nApplied to relieve the destitute and hungry, the teaching flourishes to guard the central court.\nThe Emperor’s honor endures for myriad years, Great Peace abolishes blades of war.\nBowing heads toward the Jade Dawn, numinous blossoms scatter golden rays.\n\n**The Perfected of the Great Ultimate** states:\nThe Most High Lord of the Jade Dawn and Great Dao resides above the Purple Mist in the Sevenfold Radiance of Heaven, recording the mysterious writ. Jade consorts bear the scripture, golden youths scatter incense, the Great One holds the towel, jade lads attend the banquet. Dragons chant and tigers roar, auspicious clouds shroud in mist. The ten directions’ Perfected Celestial Deities, exalted sages, Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, boundless flying heavenly kings, great demons of the three realms, elders of the nine heavens, and innumerable hosts chant the Jade Scripture, taking refuge in the Most High Numinous Treasure’s wondrous Dharma. As propitious fortune flows, it endures for kalpas uncounted.\n\nUpon completing ten recitations of the scripture, knock the teeth thirty-six times, bow in the heart to the ten directions, rise, face south to descend the seat, and stand facing east. Bow three times in the heart and secretly intone:\nYour servant has completed the scripture’s recitation. The thirty-five merit officials of the body’s emanations, the attendants of the left and right, the incense-bearing golden youths, the message-transmitting jade maidens, the five emperors’ direct talismans, and the incense officials of the appointed days—thirty-two each—are entreated to return into your servant’s body and resume their places within the palace chambers, without error or confusion.\n\nWhen the subsequent summons arrives, proceed in the same manner as before. Next, concentrate the mind to ensure all spirits within the body return to their respective palaces. Knock the teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, offer incense, and secretly intone:\n\nThe sacred assembly that has gathered to hear the scripture shall now dissolve the altar and disperse. May the divine winds fall silent, mountains and seas grow solemn and clear, all myriad evils hide in submission, and the hundred spirits guard this form.\n\nBeginning from the east, visualize the Perfected of Heaven ascending, bow three times in the heart for each direction, and knock the teeth three times to send them forth. Then draw in the three-colored cloud-qi through the nose, swallow it into the five viscera, and envision the Four Celestial Beasts returning to their original positions. Knock the teeth three times and swallow saliva three times. Only then may the scripture be gathered and one exit the chamber, speech unrestrained.\n\nShould the recitation not follow this order, it would be better left undone, lest negligence incur fault. Some may ask why alchemical principles require such observances—it is because the Dao abides both within and without, and this cannot be otherwise. May all who know this hold it in reverence and thereby summon forth fortune and virtue.\n\nHere ends the fifth fascicle of the *Esoteric Meaning of the Supreme Scripture of Limitless Salvation by the Primordial Beginning*.",

      "translated_text": "**The Esoteric Meaning of the Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Infinity for the Salvation of Humanity**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Esoteric Meaning of the Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Infinity for the Salvation of Humanity*\n**Author:** Xiao Yingsou, a Daoist of the Southern Song Dynasty\n**Volume:** Five\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Jade Instructions* Category\n\n---\n\n**Memorial on the Esoteric Meaning of the Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Infinity for the Salvation of Humanity**\n\nYour subject, Yingsou, respectfully states: Having examined *The Wondrous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for the Salvation of Humanity*, I have compiled its esoteric meaning into this work, carved onto wood for transmission.\n\nThe *Primordial Kalpa* is called the *Prior Heaven*; the *Root Chapter of the Numinous Treasure* is thus named the *Supreme Scripture*. Its transformative power may be likened to the solitary return of the elixir, yet who but the Great Brahmā could encompass its vastness?\n\nNow that its publication is complete, how dare I neglect to make this solemn declaration? With utmost reverence and awe, I bow my head in prostration.\n\nI humbly reflect: The vast and undifferentiated One Reality forms the shared body of Heaven and Earth; the myriad transformations, though diverse, share the same root in life and death. Though sentient beings differ in awareness, they all fundamentally accord with the wondrous emptiness of the formless.\n\nYet why do fame and profit stir the will, while emotions and desires delude the mind? Though the source is one, its streams diverge; though natures are near, habits grow distant. All this arises from clinging to illusion—how can one know the Eternal? The five colors dazzle the eyes—who will turn their gaze inward? The ten thousand changes bloom in profusion—who can reverse their course?\n\nOne may fortify the valley’s boat or store treasures in the abyss, yet how can one halt the sun’s chariot from departing? Rather than lamenting early death while clinging to life, it is better to cultivate the True and honor destiny.\n\nThus, our August Sovereign of the Void, the Sagely Lord, expounded the wondrous Dao before the empty kalpas; the Most High Jade Clarity, the Supreme Honored One, received the true transmission within the millet-like pearl. The salvation of beings is boundless, and the blessings bestowed are inexhaustible.\n\nYet the Great Dao is nothing but the true mean, and later generations, through repetition and distortion, have turned the contemplation of the wondrous into golden shackles, while their confusion of the source resembles fish trapped in a basin. Discoursing on emptiness and purity, they drown in suffering and void; debating cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver, they cling to what is fixed and substantial. Without understanding the transformative power of the *Ancestral Qi*, how can one fathom the subtle mysteries of the Great Brahmā?\n\nTaking the true scripture as its foundation, this work elucidates the profound mechanism without divulging its essence. In former times, crows were mistaken for horses, leading to endless confusion; today, the butcher’s eye sees no whole ox, yet his touch knows restraint. Turning the wheel of delusion to point back toward the southern homeland, damming the raging waves to follow the downward flow—may all the people below ascend to benevolence and longevity.\n\nWith utmost reverence, I contemplate the Most High August Heavenly Honored One, the Jade Emperor, Your August Jade Majesty: majestic beyond measure, vast beyond naming, impartial and selfless, penetrating even the most hidden, ever benefiting beings with goodness, ever saving beings without abandoning a single one. Thus, You have permitted even one of such modest talent as I to dare compose this humble work. If it may contribute even a ten-thousandth part, I pray You deign to regard my earnest devotion.",

      "translated_text": "If it offers not even the slightest benefit, I can but hope for pardon of my presumption.\n\nThis inner teaching, comprising one work in two scrolls, has been carved onto printing blocks and compiled. Humbly submitted to the Department of State Affairs, I beseech that it be presented for imperial consideration. With trepidation, I offer this memorial for Your August Majesty’s perusal, dreading the offense to Your celestial majesty.\n\nI, Your servant, am awestruck and trembling, bowing my head to the ground in reverence.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nOn the seventh day of the seventh month, the first day of which was *jiayin*, in the second year of the *Baoqing* reign, cyclical year *bingxu* (17th August, 1226), Your servant Xiao Yingsou, Master of the Three Radiant Realms of the Great Cavern of Supreme Purity and the Mysterious Capital, respectfully presents this memorial.\n\n---\n\n**Essential Meaning of the Scripture**\n\nThe Most High is the Supreme of the Boundless, the inception of the Primordial Beginning. Prior to the existence of one’s father and mother, a single spark of true yang essence—when the two *qi* interact—gives rise to the two kidneys. Once the kidneys are formed, the two eyes emerge. Then, the five viscera gather and coalesce, shaping the countenance, and only then does the body exist. This is called *the Cavern*.\n\n*The Cavern* refers to the fully formed physical frame, the descent into birth as a human being—here, one merely perceives the body. *The Mysterious* denotes the essence of the Mysterious Unity. Once the body exists, the essence is preserved at the *Guanyuan* (Gate of Origin). When essence is preserved at *Guanyuan*, *qi* circulates throughout; when *qi* circulates, spirit is whole. With spirit whole, the hundred apertures open, and the myriad things respond.\n\nThe eyes, permeated with light, can see all things; the nose, opened to its pores, can detect fragrances; the ears, unsealed, can hear sounds; the mouth, connected to the heart, can savor all flavors. When these four are fully developed, one becomes numinous. This is what is meant by \"among the ten thousand things, humans are the most numinous.\"\n\nYet humans, though numinous, fail to awaken. The reason one may attain longevity and agelessness lies in preserving the singular numinosity, preventing its dissipation outward. Let the eyes not gaze upon forms, so that the *hun*-soul guards the liver, consolidating the wood-*qi* without leakage. Let the nose not perceive fragrances, so that the *po*-soul guards the lungs, consolidating the metal-*qi* without leakage. Let the ears not heed sounds, so that essence guards the kidneys, consolidating the water-*qi* without leakage. Let the mouth not speak, so that spirit guards the heart, consolidating the fire-*qi* without leakage. Let the entire body sit upright, the four great elements unmoving, so that intent guards the spleen, consolidating the earth-*qi* without leakage.\n\nWhen the five directions are firmly rooted, spirit, *qi*, and essence merge into one, returning to the origin and reverting to the root to fulfill destiny. Then, the myriad spirits gather, transforming into an infant. Abandoning the illusory husk, one moves freely without entanglement with creation, merging with the Dao in truth—this is the treasure.\n\nOne who attains this treasure within the body moves with unrestrained freedom, drifting carefree, ever-springing and ageless, sharing the same eternal rest as Heaven. By emitting true *qi*, one can transmute earth and stone into treasures; by emitting true *qi*, one can revive withered bones into living beings; by emitting true *qi*, one can cure the ten thousand ailments, and all maladies heal of themselves; by emitting true *qi*, one can repel malevolent spirits, and they vanish of themselves; by emitting true *qi*, one can stir wind and thunder, and they resound of themselves. By emitting true *qi*, one can sustain the ten thousand things, and they flourish of themselves; by emitting true *qi*, one can deliver lost souls, and they are freed of themselves—this is the boundless salvation of beings.\n\nThe highest grade is the Great Vehicle’s method. *The Wondrous* is the swift path to the profound and obscure. *The Scripture* is the road to cultivating truth. If one can recite its words and inwardly grasp its mysteries, then with every thought, there will be a mysterious response. As for cultivating truth and learning the Dao, saving the living and delivering the dead—all is contained herein. Practice it in secrecy, and one may attain the Dao.\n\nThe meaning of the *Scripture of Wondrous Treasure* is vast and its principles profound; without delving deeply, seeking the hidden, and plumbing the mysterious to its subtleties, it is not easily fathomed. Yet I say otherwise. Thus, the Scripture states: \"If one attains the One, all things are complete.\" Would the Heavenly Worthy create arduous matters to confuse people? In all daily actions and ordinary conduct, this Scripture is present.\n\nThose who thoroughly investigate it are like the wealthy observing drinking vessels: though goblets, cups, and chalices lie scattered before them, they know them to be gold. What difficulty is there? Those who do not observe well are led astray by the vessels—how could they not be confused?\n\nThis Scripture is simply the Dao. Its wondrous discourse on profound principles, its subtle elucidation of grand names—all are but the branching of the *fan-qi* (Brahma-*qi*) and the revelation of true emptiness. When people engage with circumstances, they scatter and find it hard to enter. To clarify this Scripture, one should measure oneself against creation: that is as it is, and I am as it is. Observe carefully and contemplate deeply, and one will surely find resonance.\n\nNot only is this true of this Scripture; the entire canon of teachings is thus. As the elder Su of Laoquan said: \"That which Heaven bestows upon me—can it be by chance? What it bestows must have a use for me. If I know it but do not practice it, nor share it with others, though Heaven intends to use it, I cast it aside—this is called abandoning Heaven. To humble oneself in seeking fortune through its words, to belittle oneself in seeking to employ its Dao—how does Heaven bestow upon me, and how do I respond thus? This is called profaning Heaven.\"\n\nAbandoning Heaven is my sin; profaning Heaven is also my sin. I have always taken this as a warning. Reflecting on Heaven’s grace, the polishing of teachers and friends, and my glimpse of the essence of the *Wondrous Treasure*—this, too, is Heaven bestowing upon me. Having received it, I strive to practice it, not daring to abandon Heaven. Explaining it in detail and guarding it carefully, I dare not profane Heaven. Neither abandoning nor profaning, I wander in it, rest in it, cultivate in it, and preserve it in it—this is my aspiration.\n\nIf like-minded individuals know of it and wish to share it with others, I fear profaning Heaven and decline. They then say: \"Have you not heard of Li Guangxuan’s story? Long ago, Guangxuan diligently sought the Dao for many years. One day, on Shaoshi Mountain, he encountered an extraordinary person who asked him: 'In your quest for the Dao, should you not also uplift the people of the world?'\"",

With no ancestor beyond itself, its body is the Dao alone—this is what is meant by \"the Supreme Ultimate moves and generates yang.\" When movement reaches its limit, it becomes still; stillness generates yin; when stillness reaches its limit, it moves again.

Yin and yang divide, and the Two Modes are established.\n\nThe Five Scripts unfold and expand—this is what is meant by \"yang transforms, yin conjoins, and water, fire, wood, metal, and earth are born.\" The five *qi* flow in sequence, and the four seasons proceed. The Five Phases are one yin-yang; yin-yang is one Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate is fundamentally the Non-Ultimate.

      "translated_text": "The Scripture states: \"Know the masculine, yet guard the feminine, and return to the state of the infant. Know the white, yet guard the black, and return to the boundless.\" This is the Way of the Golden Elixir and Returning Cinnabar, by which one may deeply root and firmly stem, attaining long life and enduring vision.\n\n**Diagram of the Body’s Symbolism of Yin-Yang Ascending and Descending**\n*Analogy:*\nThis body is the furnace and stove of Heaven and Earth; the Central Palace is the crucible, while the space beyond the body is the Great Void. The Qian Palace is the Sea of Marrow; the Kun Palace is the Chamber of Essence; the Chamber of Spirit and the Cinnabar Crucible are called the Three Palaces. Qian and Kun are the warp and woof of Heaven and Earth. Yin and yang circulate within them. Heaven and Earth are the great forge; yin and yang are the mechanism of transformation; the single *qi* is the medicinal substance.\n\nIn refining the elixir, one relies on the *qi* of Qian and Kun, the male and female, nurturing them through the cyclical stars to form the crucible. The Golden Mother resides within, employing the wondrous generative *qi* to interact and stimulate, a process called cultivation and refinement. When yang essence blazes daily and the true spirit transforms and generates, it is called the Sacred Embryo. When yin is shed and yang is pure, it is called the Infant. This is what is meant by the Great One containing the true, harmonizing with the void, and returning to the boundless.\n\nThe locus of the Spirit Chamber and the mechanism of nurturing must not be lightly disclosed, for oaths and pacts govern their transmission. The teacher must clearly instruct to avoid misleading the aspirant into the depths of delusion.\n\n**The Eight Rings of the Diagram:**\n1. The first ring, with the Eight Trigrams, represents Earth. The Eight Trigrams form images and interact.\n2. The second ring, with the twenty-eight constellations, represents Heaven. It clarifies the great reckoning of the celestial cycles, beginning with the Celestial Origin.\n3. The third ring, with thirty waxings and wanings, represents the fire phases of a month, corresponding to the sixty hexagrams and their interactions.\n4. The fourth ring, with one hundred white and black dots, represents the yin tally and yang fire of the water clock, corresponding to the celestial tally’s movement and stillness.\n5. The fifth ring, with twelve hexagrams, represents the advancing and retreating of the lines, the rising and falling of the Dragon and Tiger.\n6. The sixth ring, with the twelve earthly branches, represents the fire phases’ ascent and descent, gathering the celestial tally.\n7. The seventh ring reveals the great reckoning of the celestial cycle, resonating with the four seasons and five phases, corresponding to the inner symbolism.\n8. The eighth ring arranges the myriad images of yin, yang, and the five phases into the crucible, assisting the Gold Fire and Dragon Tiger, the Li Woman and Kan Man, the yin and yang spouses. Through their union, true cinnabar and true mercury are generated, forming the divine elixir.\n\nThe above is the *Diagram of Fire Phases in the Great Return’s Heart-Mirror* by Zhenyizi Peng Xiao, adopted to elucidate the use of the Great Brahma’s esoteric language.\n\n**Recitation of Scriptures and Precepts**\nThere are the Five Precepts and the Ten Useless Matters. The method of reciting scriptures must be understood: purify oneself with fasting and bathing, cast aside worldly concerns, and align inner and outer to do good.\n\nI have witnessed the method of scripture recitation by the Supreme Pole’s Immortal Ge, which includes the Five Precepts and the Ten Useless Matters. The noble seeker of goodness who adheres to these words will gain boundless benefits—far beyond merely ascending and transcending oneself, for blessings will flow to descendants as well.\n\n**The Five Precepts:**\n1. Do not recite with the mouth while the heart resists.\n2. Do not treat the words and principles with disdain.\n3. Do not conceive of oneself as a living person.\n4. Be humble and defer to the teacher’s guidance.\n5. Practice compassion and guidance, mutually enlightening one another.\n\n**The Ten Useless Matters:**\n1. Disloyalty to the sovereign.\n2. Lack of filial piety toward parents.\n3. Lack of kindness toward all beings.\n4. Clinging to ignorance and comparing self and others.\n5. Envying the worthy and resenting those superior to oneself.\n6. Slandering the good and humiliating the orphaned and poor.\n7. Engaging in malicious speech and double-tongued gossip.\n8. Deceiving the heart and harming beings.\n9. Indulging in wine and meat, and favoring depravity.\n10. Giving rise to greed, anger, hatred, and attachment.\n\nIf one can adhere to these, what disaster will not be averted, what sin will not be dissolved? The names will be recorded in the heavens, and demon kings will vouch for one. Otherwise, even a lifetime of recitation will not bring the desired blessings and wisdom.\n\nThe noble and enlightened should take heed and be cautious.\n\n**Method of Recitation (for Daoists and laypersons, men and women alike):**\nPurify the fast within, free from distracting thoughts, and abstain from rich foods and meat externally. Enter the *jing*—a purified chamber. Don the ritual attire (a robe or jacket will suffice, as long as it is clean).\n\nTap the teeth to align the central incisors, sounding the Dharma Drum to gather the body’s spirits. Burn incense—abundant and fragrant—to convey sincerity.\n\nBow to the four directions (east, south, west, north), then to the four corners (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest), and finally to the above and below, one bow each. After bowing, sit facing east. The bowing to the ten directions relates to the scripture’s content. A bow of the heart surpasses a bow of the body. Facing east follows the order of ascending to heaven, from east to west. Sit upright—whether cross-legged or with feet hanging, there is no strict rule.\n\nNext, tap the teeth, recite the *Heart-Mouth Purification Mantra* and the *Body Purification Mantra* to adorn the body’s spirits. Then tap the teeth and recite the *Heaven-Earth Purification Mantra* and the *Scripture’s Mysterious Essence Mantra*. After reciting these mantras, open the scroll and begin the scripture recitation. The remaining precepts and details are fully annotated below.\n\n**The Inner Meaning of the Supreme Scripture of Limitless Salvation, First Scroll**\n*Observations by Guanfuzi Xiao Yingsou:*\nAccording to the *Numinous Treasure Great Method*, the *Scripture of Salvation* encompasses seven matters, broadly outlined as follows:\n- The Primordial *Qi* of the Origin, before formlessness—how can it be compared?\n- Descending to form *qi*, transforming and generating the myriad treasures—what is its present manifestation?\n- Refining this *qi* into treasure and ingesting it to ascend as a perfected being.\n\nI observe that the former perfected and supreme sages revealed this single principle as the supreme mechanism of life and death, the great essential of nature and destiny. Without the Way of the Golden Elixir and Returning Cinnabar, how could the mystery of the Primordial *Qi* of the Origin be illuminated? Exhaustively probing the subtle and profound, pursuing the abstruse and wondrous, dredging forth divine grace to irrigate the field of immortality—such is the intent.\n\n**The Supreme Scripture of Limitless Salvation from the Numinous Treasure of the Supreme Mystery**\nThis scripture is revered by the myriad sages and venerated by all perfected beings. It is supreme beyond all, mysterious beyond the mysterious.",

Thus, the Confucian, knowing the causes of the hidden and the manifest, encompasses the myriad things, traces beginnings to return to endings, exhausts principle and fulfills nature, and attains the wondrous mystery beyond life and death. Laozi, however, says: \"Deeply root, firmly stem, for long life and enduring vision.\" Each has its own tradition.\n\nIf this is so, how then is it to be achieved?",

      "original_text": "且洞玄灵宝，是品秩之总名； 无量度人，即此卷之篇目。 诸经所宗，故曰上品； 由兹明道，是谓妙经。 我朝真宗御制序曰：大易垂教，先於至神； 混元着书，本於妙道。 契阴阳之不测，标冲默之难名。 盖以阐无为之为，着无象之象，范围幽赞，藏用而显仁； 怳惚窈冥，化民而育物。 虽古今而异制，诚训导以同归。 若乃藏室灵文，昭台秘籍，纷纶玉笈，充溢丹函。 龟关墉城，自高真而降授； 赤明龙汉，应劫运以流传。 斯固超视听之先，在名言之表，弼成至治，渐渍群生。 首出於九流，抗行於百代，干戈俶扰之际，用之而岂遑？ 虫鱼咸若之辰，拾之而孰可？ 《度人经》者，元始之妙言，玉晨之宝诰。 浮黎真境，纪谈受之初，紫微上宫，显械藏之迹。 实诸天之隐韵，为大梵之仙章。 八角垂芒，本由於神翰； 千祇列卫，普度於人灵。 其或育质圆方，禀和霄壤，少私寡欲，背伪归真，端虑以洁斋，洗心而成诵。 精专外积，纯粹内充，可以自晦而明，无幽不烛。 类虚室之生白，同温泉之荡邪，熙熙而陟春台，济济而跻寿域。 至诚所极，介福何穷。 猗欤伟哉，夫灵宝者，或曰灵即圣化也，宝即珍尚也。 或曰灵者，众圣之通称，宝者，众圣之所珍。 或曰变化无方曰灵，钦崇贵爱曰宝。 或曰在天曰灵，在地曰宝。 或曰神降为灵，炁聚为宝。 所谓仁者见之谓之神，知者见之谓之知，百姓日用而不知，故强为之容，以应化设教，御物利生也。 炁而精至於无形，大至於不可围。 若夫远取诸物，近取诸身，则大而为天地，微不离肖翘； 明则为日月，隐则为阴阳； 在儒为仁义，在释为知慧，在人为神炁，在丹为汞铅。 寓万物为性情，统元炁为造化，其实皆道也。 惟达者能一贯之，然其执幻迷真，任情逐物，遂使灵源决荡，妙本支离，不能返老还童，以至衰坏。 故《生神章》云：夫人得还生於人道，濯形太阳，惊天骇地，贵亦难胜。 天真地神，三界齐临，亦不轻也； 当生之时，亦不为陋也。 但人得生而自不能尊其炁，贵其形，宝其命，爱其神，自取死坏，离其本真耳。 《西升经》云：生我於虚，置我於无； 生我者神，杀我者心； 积气聚血，成我身耳。 身乃神之车，神之舍，神之主。 安静，神则居之； 躁动，神则去之。 《黄庭经》云：长生至慎房中急，何为死作令神泣。 寸田尺宅可治生，若当决海百渎倾。 叶去树枯失青青，气亡液漏非已形。 《庄子》曰：吾生也有涯，而知也无涯； 以有涯随无涯，殆矣。 又曰：夫人生炁之聚也。 聚则为生，散则为死。 形劳而不休则弊，精用而不已则劳，劳则竭矣。 太史公曰：凡人所生者，神也。 所托者，形也。 神太用则竭，形太劳则弊。 形神离则死，死者不可复生，离者不可复返，故圣人重之。 谛观斯言，皆知返本还源者也。 所以自然灵宝之道，金液大还之旨，达者向慕，代不乏人。 太上启接引之方而诏人曰：常无欲以观其妙，常有欲以观其微。 而释氏亦云：人被物转，若能转物，即同如来。 故道、释二教，各有超越死生之理。 释氏以性为宗，故修禅定； 道家以神为主，故炼金丹。 禅定之极，寂乎阴； 金丹之极，归乎阳。 此两者同出而异用，皆由所生之本而成正真，非假外物而造作者也。",
      "translated_text": "Moreover, *Dongxuan Lingbao* (\"Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure\") is the general designation of its ranks and grades, while *Wu Liang Du Ren* (\"Limitless Salvation of Humankind\") is the title of this particular scroll. Revered as the source of all scriptures, it is thus called the \"Supreme Grade\"; through it the Dao is illuminated, hence it is termed the \"Wondrous Scripture.\"\n\nOur dynasty’s True Sovereign, Emperor Zhenzong, composed a preface stating: *The Great Change* imparts its teachings, originating in the utmost numinous; *Hunyuan* (\"Primal Origin\") sets forth its writings, rooted in the wondrous Dao. It accords with the unfathomable of yin and yang, and marks the indescribable of profound silence. For it expounds the action of non-action, manifests the form of the formless, encompasses the hidden and assists the subtle, concealing its function while revealing its benevolence. Vast and obscure, it transforms the people and nurtures all things. Though its systems differ across past and present, its instruction and guidance converge as one.\n\nAs for the sacred texts stored in the hidden chambers, the secret records on the luminous terrace, the jade-bound scrolls in profusion, the cinnabar-sealed cases in abundance—these were transmitted down from the loftiest perfected beings through the walled cities of the turtle-gate, flowing through the kalpas of Red Brightness and Dragon Han in accord with the cycles of fate. Such truths transcend what sight and hearing can perceive, existing beyond the realm of names and words. They assist in perfecting the utmost governance and gradually permeate all beings.\n\nFirst emerging among the nine schools, standing firm through the ages, even amid the tumult of war and strife, who would find time to employ them? Yet in times when \"the insects and fish are all at peace,\" who would deem them dispensable?\n\nThe *Scripture of Salvation* is the wondrous utterance of the Primordial Beginning, the precious proclamation of the Jade Dawn. In the Floating Black Realm, it records the initial transmission; in the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, it reveals the traces of its concealed treasures. It is the hidden rhyme of all heavens, the immortal hymn of the Great Brahmā. Its eight-cornered radiance descends from divine brushstrokes; its thousand *qi*-guardians array in defense, universally delivering the numinous essence of humankind.\n\nThose who nurture their essence in roundness and squareness, who receive harmony between heaven and earth, who diminish selfishness and desire, who turn from falsity to return to truth, who purify their thoughts through solemn fasting and cleanse their hearts through recitation—when their focus accumulates externally and purity fills them internally, they may obscure themselves to become luminous, illuminating all that is hidden. Like a vacant chamber generating brightness, like a warm spring dispelling evil, they ascend the springtime terrace in joy, mounting the realm of longevity in solemnity. Where utmost sincerity reaches, what bound is there to the blessings bestowed?\n\nHow magnificent! As for the *Lingbao* (\"Numinous Treasure\"), some say *ling* (\"numinous\") is the transformation of the sagely, and *bao* (\"treasure\") is what is cherished and esteemed. Others say *ling* is the general term for all sages, and *bao* is what all sages treasure. Still others say *ling* denotes boundless transformation, while *bao* denotes reverence and precious love. Some say *ling* is in heaven, and *bao* is on earth. Others say the divine descends as *ling*, and *qi* gathers as *bao*.\n\nAs it is said: \"The benevolent see it and call it spirit; the wise see it and call it wisdom. The common people use it daily yet do not know it.\" Thus, we forcibly give it form to respond to transformation, establish teachings, govern things, and benefit life.\n\n*Qi* refined to utmost subtlety becomes formless; vastness reaches the point of being unencompassable. Taking examples from afar or near—from things or from the self—it is great as heaven and earth, minute yet not departing from the tiniest detail. Manifest, it is the sun and moon; hidden, it is yin and yang. In Confucianism, it is benevolence and righteousness; in Buddhism, it is wisdom and knowledge. In humans, it is spirit and *qi*; in the elixir, it is mercury and lead. It lodges in the nature and emotions of the myriad things, unites the primordial *qi* as creation—yet in truth, it is all the Dao.\n\nOnly those who comprehend can unify it. Yet those who cling to illusion and lose sight of reality, who follow their emotions and chase after things, cause the numinous source to rupture and the wondrous root to scatter. They cannot return to youth and recover from decay.\n\nThus, the *Chapter on Generating Spirit* states: \"When a person attains rebirth in the human realm, bathing their form in the Great Yang, it shakes heaven and earth—such honor is hard to surpass. Heavenly perfected and earthly spirits, the three realms all attend, for it is not lightly bestowed. At the time of birth, one is not deemed base. Yet people, having received life, fail to honor their *qi*, treasure their form, cherish their life, or love their spirit. They bring about their own decay and death, departing from their original truth.\"\n\nThe *Scripture of Western Ascension* says: \"Life births me in emptiness, places me in nothingness. What gives me life is spirit; what kills me is the heart. Accumulated *qi* and gathered blood form my body. The body is the chariot of spirit, the abode of spirit, the master of spirit. When tranquil, spirit resides within; when restless, spirit departs.\"\n\nThe *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: \"For long life, be most cautious in the chamber of intimacy—why invite death and make the spirit weep? The inch-field and foot-dwelling can cultivate life; if you breach the sea, the hundred streams will pour out. Leaves fall, the tree withers, losing its verdancy; *qi* perishes, fluids leak—this is no longer one’s true form.\"\n\n*Zhuangzi* said: \"Our life has limits, but knowledge has none. To pursue the limitless with the limited is perilous.\" He also said: \"Human life is the gathering of *qi*. When it gathers, there is life; when it scatters, there is death. If the form labors without rest, it wears out; if essence is used without cease, it exhausts. Exhaustion leads to depletion.\"\n\nThe Grand Historian said: \"What gives life to humans is spirit; what it relies upon is form. If spirit is overused, it depletes; if form is overworked, it wears out. When form and spirit separate, death comes. The dead cannot be revived; the departed cannot return. Thus, the sage values them highly.\"\n\nCarefully observing these words, all point to returning to the root and restoring the source. Therefore, the natural *Lingbao* Dao and the principle of the Great Return of Golden Fluid have been admired by those who comprehend, and such people have never been lacking through the ages.\n\nThe Supreme Lord revealed the method of guidance and proclaimed to humankind: \"Constantly abide in desirelessness to observe its mystery; constantly abide in desire to observe its subtlety.\" The Buddhist tradition also says: \"People are turned by things; if one can turn things, one is the same as the Tathāgata.\"\n\nThus, the Daoist and Buddhist teachings each possess principles for transcending life and death. Buddhism takes nature as its foundation, hence it cultivates meditation and stillness. Daoism takes spirit as its master, hence it refines the golden elixir. The utmost of meditation and stillness is quiescence in yin; the utmost of the golden elixir is return to yang. These two emerge from the same source but differ in application. Both achieve true perfection from the root of what gives life, not through reliance on external things or artificial creation.",

      "translated_text": "Without this, spirits cannot enter the hidden; without this, humans cannot be born or completed—thus the teeming ten thousand things take the Dao as their root. The serpent that attains it becomes a dragon; the bird that attains it becomes a phoenix; the beast that attains it becomes a qilin; the ordinary person who attains it becomes an immortal. Those who cultivate it roam the Great Void, transform their five viscera, alter their form and appearance, command ghosts and spirits, and appear or vanish at will—this is the Way of the Upper Immortals.\n\nThe king said: \"What you speak of as the Numinous Treasure is indeed rare. From this, it seems that what is called ‘attaining’ and ‘cultivating’ it—what is it, in the end?\" Thereupon it was known that the Numinous Treasure and the Golden Elixir emerge from the same source but bear different names.\n\nThe *Scriptures of the Numinous Treasure* were bestowed by the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign upon the Yellow Emperor at Mount Emei. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign also transmitted them to Emperor Ku at the Terrace of Pastoral Virtue. Xia Yu received them in full at Mount Zhong, while Helü of Wu secretly glimpsed them at Mount Gouqu. Later, figures such as Ge Xiaoxian and Zheng Siyuan, master and disciple, passed them down in an unbroken lineage—this is how the scriptural teachings emerged.\n\nThe Dao says: The words of the Supreme Jade Dawn Dao Lord are the words of the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy. Formerly, he received the scriptures from the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void Sovereign, compiled them into volumes, and concealed them in the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Mysterious Capital. The Dao Lord transmitted them to the Perfected of the Mysterious Unity, whence they spread.\n\nIn the past, within the Primordial Azure Heaven—\nThe Eastern Nine Qi form the Azure Heaven.\n\"Primordial\" is the name of the inception of the Five Directions;\n\"Azure\" is the color of the East.\nThe Azure Empyrean resounds with celestial song in the Great Floating Li Land—\nThis heaven’s qi is azure and emerald, its radiance vast and boundless, hence called the Azure Empyrean.\nThe numinous wind and jade trees strike celestial melodies in the void, hence called \"celestial song.\"\nThe Great Floating Li Land is the kingdom of the Eastern Culmen’s Great Floating Li.\nThere, the Dao Lord received the *Primordial Beginning’s Scripture on the Salvation of Innumerable Beings of the Supreme Grade*.\n\nThe Dao Lord said: \"In that heaven and that land, I formerly received the wondrous scriptures of the Void Sovereign Heavenly Worthy, widely delivering humans and gods. The merit is beyond reckoning—this is the true essence of the Supreme Grade.\"\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: Of heaven and earth’s vastness and the tiniest of creatures, all things bound by form and subject to number are born and completed by embodying the workings of creation. The Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy’s opening of the scriptures—\"In the Primordial Azure Heaven, the Azure Empyrean resounds with celestial song in the Great Floating Li Land\"—reveals the inception of creation.\n\nThings are born from earth and return to earth, thus the *Scripture of the Hidden Correspondences* says: \"Fire is born from wood; when calamity erupts, it must be subdued.\" Those who know this and refine it are called sages.\n\nWithin wood lies fire; if unleashed without restraint, it reduces all to flying ash and vanishing smoke, leaving no trace of its original nature. Those who restrain it, though fire scorches wood to cinders, gather it into earth—once it becomes earth, its original nature is preserved.\n\nThe Primordial Azure Heaven is the sprouting of grain;\nThe Azure Empyrean’s celestial song is the symbol of fire.\nThe Eastern Culmen’s Great Floating Li Land is all of azure jade, ever generating azure radiance. There are also the verdant forests, whose trees, stirred by wind, produce sounds like cavernous hymns, resplendent and luminous throughout the Great Void.\n\nThe Floating Li Kingdom belongs to the Jade Prosperity Heaven of the Northeast. The Northeast is the *yin* position, the land where fire is born. The wind-stirred verdant forests—verdant is the color of wood, and \"forest\" is two trees. Guan Yin said: \"When two woods rub, fire is born.\" Trees are also wood. Wood and wind are *xun*. The Daoist in Hemp Robes said: \"Earth two generates fire,\" for the qi of *li* is conceived within *xun* wood. The resplendence and luminosity throughout the Great Void are the symbol of fire’s brilliance. The azure radiance’s vastness and boundlessness resemble the void’s sound in their emptiness and clarity—hence \"Azure Empyrean celestial song.\" The Great Floating Li Land is the root of earth. Earth is the foundation of the Returned Elixir. The Returned Elixir is the Way of returning to the origin.\n\nThe scripture says: \"Attain utmost emptiness, guard deep stillness; as the ten thousand things arise together, I observe their return.\" The teeming things each return to their root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called the restoration of life—this is the principle of returning. The *Book of Changes*’ *Fu* hexagram embodies this. *Fu* is the Way of yin and yang’s return. Thus it is said: \"*Fu* reveals the heart of heaven and earth.\" Heaven and earth are the body of yin and yang; \"heart\" clarifies their function. Heaven moves and earth is still; yang moves and yin is still. When heaven’s movement reaches its limit, yin is born; when earth’s stillness reaches its limit, yang is born. This is the stripping away above and the returning below—movement and stillness wax and wane, thus revealing their heart. Humans are the same.\n\nIn the *Fu* hexagram, one yang lies beneath five yins, its body *zhen* below and *kun* above. *Zhen* is wood—the Primordial Azure Heaven. Wood generates fire—the Azure Empyrean’s celestial song. Fire generates earth—thus *kun* earth is the Great Floating Li Land.\n\nThe Azure Empyrean’s celestial song, in terms of the scriptures, is qi and sound, emerging from nonbeing into being. In terms of the Elixir, *zhen* wood and *kun* earth each have their solid substance, yet within their emptiness appears the symbol of fire. From this, one may clearly understand the scriptural purport and the natural alignment of the Elixir Way with the workings of creation.\n\nEarth is the root of creation, thus earth generates metal, called \"void qi.\" The Metal Embryo is truly the primordial ancestral qi, hence it is said: \"Received the *Primordial Beginning’s Scripture on the Salvation of Innumerable Beings of the Supreme Grade*.\" \"Primordial Beginning\" is the ancestral qi—the indestructible primordial spirit from past kalpas, called True Lead, which serves as the mother of the Elixir.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Dragon and Tiger* says: \"Metal and fire are True Lead.\" In the art of the Elixir, nothing is more essential than metal and fire. The Perfected Zhang Ziyang’s *Awakening to Reality* states:\n\"Fire is born from wood, wood conceals its edge;\nWithout skill in drilling and grinding, do not force it.\nCalamity erupts only because it harms oneself—\nOne must seek to subdue it and find the Metal Duke.\"\n\nIt also says:\n\"If *li* and *kan* lack *wu* and *ji*,\nThough they contain the Four Images, no Elixir is formed.\"",

      "translated_text": "All this arises from the mutual embrace of True Earth between them, thus enabling the Golden Elixir to return and revert. From this, the Dao of the Elixir may be clearly discerned, and its fruition truly witnessed.\n\nThe Chan master of Zhaozhou said:\n\"A golden Buddha cannot pass through the furnace,\nA wooden Buddha cannot pass through fire,\nA clay Buddha cannot pass through water—\nHow then may *I* be delivered?\nIf you would deliver *me*,\nNone but *I* can deliver *me*.\"\n\nThus this Dao is the return of my spirit, the restoration of my nature, and the deliverance of my body. Each delivers oneself—none remains undelivered. Without limit or number, this is the Supreme Vehicle. Hence it is called *the Supreme Grade Scripture on the Salvation of Innumerable Beings*.\n\nThe *Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning*—this is the responsive title of the *Vacuous Sovereign*, arising from the True and manifesting in the phenomenal, termed *realization through cultivation*. The subtle contemplation of the profound source is the unique possession of one’s own nature. The *Scripture of Cavernous Spirit* states: \"The wondrous image is formless; responsive resonance takes bodily form.\"\n\nWhen this scripture is expounded—\n*Scripture* means *path*: it is by this that one may proceed to attain the Dao.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* says: \"The *Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning* is the ancestral qi of the Dharmakāya—the so-called *original face*, the indestructible primordial spirit, termed *True Lead*.\" When this scripture is expounded, it clarifies that ancestral qi is the essence of the Elixir.\n\nLord Lao told Master Yin: \"If you can know the One, all things are complete. Seal off passions and desires, enter the inner chamber, refine metal and ingest qi—this is foremost. If you can know this, guard it and do not lose it.\"\n\nHe also said:\n\"Red Lead and Black Tin are the great heads of the Elixir;\nEntering the Black from the Red is true cultivation.\nExtract essence from the Black, marrow from the Red—\nIf you can resolve the Red and Black, the medicine is peerless.\nUsing the Red to enter the Black ensures longevity;\nUsing the Black to enter the Red ascends to celestial immortality.\"\n\nHe further said:\n\"One is Lead, and Lead is the sovereign;\nTwo is Mercury, and Mercury is the minister.\nIf Lead is not true, Mercury will not draw near;\nIf Lead is true, the household minister is not lost.\nThe Green-Waisted Envoy, the Red-Blooded General—\nHarmonizing the two clans, distinct yet united in fellowship.\nWhite Mercury becomes the brain, Yellow Sprout the root.\nTransform Lead into powder, refine Mercury into dust.\nYin resides in the position of Yang, Yang’s number and Yin’s are balanced.\nThe moon waxes as the sun wanes; cold and heat are distinct.\nThe symbolic configurations are established, resplendent in pattern.\nOnly this Dao of mine endures with Heaven and Earth.\"\n\nThe principle of expounding this scripture is thus made manifest.\n\nSomeone may ask: \"In this scripture, only cultivation, recitation, salvation of the living, and deliverance of the dead are mentioned—where are the principles of Dragon and Tiger, Kan and Li, cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver?\"\n\nThe answer: \"The Great Dao is without fixed form; it lodges in things to reveal its principles. Consider the *Book of Changes*: it begins with the primordial qi, divides into Yin and Yang, whose interplay of hardness and softness generates endless transformations. Fu Xi drew its hexagrams to illuminate the Dao; Shen Nong modeled tools upon it. Yao used it to face south as sovereign; Shun practiced it facing north as minister. King Wen unfolded it to exhaust the wonders of creation; Confucius expanded it to plumb the depths of Heaven and Earth. Laozi borrowed it to expound the aims of the Elixir; Master Mayi employed it to speak of the mechanisms of transformation. Chen Tuan distinguished its images and numbers; Lü Dongbin discoursed on nature and destiny; Shao Yong investigated the Prior Heaven; Zhou Dunyi and Zhang Zai established the Supreme Ultimate. Some explored the principles of things, others deduced divination—its round mechanism encompasses ten thousand transformations, never confined to one aspect. How is the Dao of this scripture different?\"\n\nAs the saying goes: \"One who knows ritual but not the spirit is no adept of long life.\" Transcending principle to enter the spirit, merging with qi, acting without acting yet accomplishing all—this is the true teaching of my tradition.\n\nThus Master Yin said: \"Those who are skilled in my Dao, within a single thing, know Heaven and exhaust the spirit, attaining the mysterious and reaching the ultimate destiny. Those who lose it chase after differences, splitting names while the reality remains the same; those who attain it harmonize in sameness, though intentions and names may differ.\"\n\nCirculating ten times to summon the ten directions—\nThe *Inner Meaning* says: \"Expounding the scripture ten times in a cycle summons the true sages and lofty worthies of Heaven and Earth. Refining the Elixir for ten months to completion is the work of circulating the essence and quintessence of Yin and Yang.\"\n\nThus circulating ten times comprises the generating number five and the completing number five. Heaven One is Water, Earth Two is Fire, Heaven Three is Wood, Earth Four is Metal, Heaven Five is Earth. Earth Six is Lead, Heaven Seven is Mercury, Earth Eight is Cinnabar, Heaven Nine is Silver, Earth Ten is the Elixir. Summoning the ten directions comprises the odd numbers—One, Three, Five, Seven, Nine—Yang; and the even numbers—Two, Four, Six, Eight, Ten—Yin. This is the wondrous function of the Returned Elixir; as for the subtle workings of creation, they are detailed below.\n\nAt the commencement of the assembly,\nThe *Vacuous Sovereign Celestial Worthy* ascends to the seat.\nThe celestial perfected, supreme sages, and lofty worthies,\nThe wondrously practicing immortals, and the innumerable hosts—\nThese are the five hundred million heavens,\nThe eight spherical worlds,\nThe Three Origins and Nine Saints,\nThe Nine Perfected and Nine Immortals,\nThe sun, moon, and stars,\nThe celestial and terrestrial spirits—\nArrive riding the void,\nFlying upon cinnabar clouds in the rosy dawn,\nAmidst the clouds of the Three Primes and the crimson mists.\nGreen carriages and jade wheels,\nFeathered canopies casting shade.\nWhen the Queen Mother of the West transmitted the scripture to Emperor Wu of Han, all the vessels, texts, and regalia followed Han dynasty conventions.

One exhalation and one inhalation make a single breath; within each breath, yin and yang divide. Exhaling and brightening is yang and day; inhaling and darkening is yin and night. The seven orifices’ exhalation is the seven days; their inhalation is the seven nights. Through the Metal Mother’s merit and practice, the celestial mechanism does not move; spirit congeals, eyes fix, pulses cease, the heart stills—thus it is said that for seven days and seven nights, the sun, moon, and stars of all heavens, the jade pivot and jade balance, halt their wheels at once. The \"divine wind falling silent\" means breath does not enter or exit. The \"mountains and seas concealing their clouds\" means qi does not rise or fall. The \"heavens free of drifting veils\" means delusive thoughts and false conditions do not arise. The \"four qi shining clearly\" means movement and stillness, being and non-being are all transcended. To the point of forgetting form and cutting off thought, the myriad existences all empty, with no self and no other, profoundly embodying one’s nature—thus it is said that throughout the land, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees stretch level as one, no longer distinguished by high or low. The earth all turns to azure jade, without any other color. The former were celestial omens; these are terrestrial responses.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* states: \"Earth\" is the purity of nature. When nature is empty and transforms, it generates spirit; stored within the chamber, it is called \"wu-earth.\" When qi is stirred and moved to feeling, gathered within the cauldron, it is called \"ji-earth.\" When spirit is joyful and qi is still, nature returns to the darkness of feeling—like color’s azure without flaw, like jade’s purity without admixture—thus it is said the land all turns to azure jade, without any other color.\n\nThe assembled perfected ones attend the seat.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* states: When intention is undivided, it congeals in spirit. The Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s mysterious seat floats in emptiness above five-colored lions—this is the Dao-form of the Heavenly Worthy.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* states: The \"Primordial Heavenly Worthy\" is the primordial spirit. The \"mysterious seat\" is the spirit-chamber. \"Floating in emptiness\" is the Dharma-body. The \"five colors\" are the qi of wondrous transformation. The \"lions\" are the knowing heart. When the primordial spirit is in the chamber, directing the heart to gather qi, the Dharma-body is empty and still, the knowing heart is luminous and wondrous—spirit commands qi, the heart takes form as a lion. Is this not the Dao-form of the Heavenly Worthy?\n\nAfter expounding the scripture once, all the heavenly great sages simultaneously praise its excellence. At that time, the deaf and ailing men and women of the land all regain their hearing.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* states: \"Expounding the scripture once\" is Heaven One generating water, the qi of Kan nurtured within Qian-metal. The \"heavenly great sages simultaneously praising its excellence\" is the myriad spirits all rejoicing at once. The \"men and women of the land\" are the yin and yang qi of the Dharma-body. \"Deafness and ailment\" belong to Kan, which governs the ears. When human spirit and qi nourish each other, if spirit is dull, qi stagnates; if qi is chaotic, spirit is turbid—dim and obscure, like deafness. When practice flows smoothly, qi is still and spirit is clear, awakening what was unawakened—thus it is called \"regaining hearing.\" This is the initial step in entering the Dao. As for bodily illnesses, when one encounters scripture and method and is cured, it need not be explained.\n\nAfter expounding the scripture a second time, the blind regain their sight.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* states: \"Expounding the scripture a second time\" is Earth Two generating fire, the qi of Li nurtured within Xun-wood. Li governs the eyes, which correspond to the heart. When the heart is deluded by things, it darkens as if blind. Following the Dao, the heart opens and intention awakens—nothing can obscure it. Right and wrong become clear, like eyes seeing the path ahead.\n\nAfter expounding the scripture a third time, the mute can speak.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* states: \"Expounding the scripture a third time\" is Heaven Three generating wood, the qi of Zhen nurtured within Gen-water.",

      "translated_text": "Gen corresponds to the mountain, where the peaks are high and the earth deep, and springs emerge from within. This is the doctrine of hemp and ashes. Speech is sound, which pertains to the nature of metal. Heaven Three generates wood, and after expounding the scripture a third time, why is it said that the mute can speak? This reveals the image of metal within wood. Wood is severed at *shen* and conceived at *you*; though metal overcomes wood, wood paradoxically lodges its embryo in the realm of metal. For metal generates water, and water generates wood—thus metal is the ancestor of wood. Heaven Three generates wood, and the third transmission of metal gives rise to wood, as in *jiazi* and *yichou* (Sea Middle Metal). Metal resides in the sea, and water generates *zi* and *chou*; water generates wood, which is *jia* and *yi*. Yang arises at *zi*, and the three yangs ascend from earth. Thus *Zhuangzi* states: \"Brilliant brilliance emerges from earth.\" Rising from below, the upper trigram *zhen* transforms into *dui*, illuminating the presence of metal within wood.\n\nAfter expounding the scripture a fourth time, those afflicted with lameness, chronic ailments, or hereditary infirmities can all rise and walk. \"Hereditary infirmities\" refer to illnesses passed down through generations. *The Inner Meaning* states: \"Expounding the scripture a fourth time\" is Earth Four generating metal, the qi of *dui* nurtured within *kun*-earth. \"Rising and walking\" describes the act of standing upright, which pertains to the nature of wood. Earth Four generates metal, and after expounding the scripture a fourth time, why is it said that those with lameness, chronic ailments, or hereditary infirmities can all rise and walk? This reveals the image of wood within metal. Metal is severed at *yin* and conceived at *mao*; metal is the ghost of wood, yet it lodges its embryo in the realm of wood. For wood generates fire, fire generates earth, and earth generates metal—thus wood is the origin of metal. Earth Four generates metal, and the fourth transmission of wood gives rise to metal, as in *jiawu* and *yiwei* (Sand Middle Metal). *Jia* and *yi* are wood, generating fire; *wu* and *wei* are fire, generating earth; sand and stone are earth, generating metal. Yin arises at *wu*, and the three yins descend from heaven. Thus *Zhuangzi* states: \"Solemn solemnity emerges from heaven.\" Descending from above, the trigram *dui* transforms into *zhen*, illuminating the presence of wood within metal. From this, the principle of alternation between metal and wood becomes evident. Yet the workings of creation are subtle and profound, far beyond what can be fully grasped through mere study on paper.\n\nAfter expounding the scripture a fifth time, long-standing chronic illnesses are restored to wholeness in an instant. *The Inner Meaning* states: \"Expounding the scripture a fifth time\" is Heaven Five generating earth, the qi of *li* lodging in *wu*, with earth-qi nurtured within *li*. All things arise from earth and return to earth, as above—this is the generative number of the Five Phases. Regarding \"long-standing chronic illnesses,\" the *Daoist Canon* states: \"Humans are the most spiritually endowed of beings. Their natural lifespan is over forty-three thousand two hundred days, and their spirit consists of thirty-six thousand primordial yang qi. Their original weight is three hundred eighty-four *zhu*, corresponding internally to *qian*. If one does not know how to preserve it and instead dissipates it, one will meet an untimely end midway. *Qian* embodies six yangs yet remains inactive and undispersed; those who understand this and cultivate it become immortals. From fifteen to twenty-five years of age, if one indulges in dissipation without cease, the primordial qi is depleted by forty-eight *zhu*, leaving a correspondence to *gou*. If desires grow more intense, and this continues for another decade, another forty-eight *zhu* is lost, leaving a correspondence to *dun*. If one still does not nurture it and adds another decade, another forty-eight *zhu* is lost, leaving a correspondence to *pi*. At this point, one reaches the midpoint of heaven and earth’s qi. If one still does not nurture it and adds another decade, seventy-two *zhu* are lost, leaving a correspondence to *guan*. If one still does not nurture it and adds another five years, ninety-six *zhu* are lost, leaving a correspondence to *bo*. If one still does not nurture it, by the sixty-four hexagrams, the primordial qi is exhausted, leaving a correspondence to *kun*. *Kun* is pure yin; one lives only by the grace of grain qi, hence the term 'borrowed lifespan.' At this stage, death is near, and one can no longer refine the elixir. Those who have severely damaged themselves may not even reach this point before perishing. The depletion of primordial qi—is this not what we call long-standing chronic illness? 'Restored to wholeness in an instant' means that through cultivating this Way, the true spirit grows daily stronger, the primordial qi flourishes, one returns to life and restores the root, attaining peace and longevity—this is the meaning.\n\nAfter expounding the scripture a sixth time, white hair turns black again, and fallen teeth regrow. *The Inner Meaning* states: \"Expounding the scripture a sixth time\" is Heaven One generating water, Earth Six completing it. Dwelling in the north, the accumulated yin of *kan* is the true qi of lead, where *qian* and *kan* unite to form water from metal. Lead is the mother of metal; lead is black and metal is white—this refers to white hair returning to its original root. \"Fallen teeth regrowing\" means that which was withered revives.\n\nAfter expounding the scripture a seventh time, the old regain their youth, and the young grow stronger. *The Inner Meaning* states: \"Expounding the scripture a seventh time\" is Earth Two generating fire, Heaven Seven completing it. Returning south to the palace of *li* is mercury, where *xun* and *li* unite to form fire from wood. Mercury is drawn from cinnabar. The south is fire, and mercury is also fire—the image of blazing flames without cease. The scripture states: \"When things reach their peak, they age—this is called 'not the Way.' What is not the Way perishes early.\" If one does not know the Way of return, fire blazes and smoke scatters, leaving nothing of the original state—how can one remain strong without aging? Once one grasps the principle of return, mastering the workings of cyclical reversal, returning to restore the root and reverting to the origin, the old become youthful and the young grow strong.\n\nAfter expounding the scripture an eighth time, pregnant women, birds, and beasts carrying young—whether already born or not yet born—all attain full development. *The Inner Meaning* states: \"Expounding the scripture an eighth time\" is Heaven Three generating wood, Earth Eight completing it. Returning east to the abode of *zhen* is cinnabar, where *gen* and *zhen* unite to form wood from water.",

      "translated_text": "Cinnabar forms when mercury responds to lead-qi and congeals. Cinnabar contains the essence of mercury, resembling a womb carrying a fetus. Just as mercury solidifies upon encountering lead, qi blends with spirit and merges as one. This qi is not the postnatal yin-qi of the body but the wondrously transformed, life-generating primordial qi. Scholars must not fail to discern this. Once congealed, this qi grows ever more robust, while the arising spirit-qi repeatedly fuses and solidifies, no longer subject to material decay. It nurtures the sacred embryo, hence it is said that \"whether already born or not yet born, all attain full development.\"\n\nExpounding the scripture a ninth time, Earth’s treasury releases its store, and gold and jade reveal their forms. *The Inner Meaning* states: \"Expounding the scripture a ninth time\" is Earth Four generating metal, with Heaven Nine completing it. Returning west to the *dui* direction yields gold, where *kun* and *dui* unite to form metal from earth. For mercury returns to the earthen crucible and becomes treasure. *The Kinship of the Three* says: \"When metal comes to return to its nature, it is called the Reverted Elixir\"—this is what is meant by \"qi returning to the origin.\" The Heavenly One’s water first arises from the empty qi of the metal embryo before the metal’s substance appears. Earth Four generates metal, still a transformative mechanism; at this stage, it returns to the origin and restores its nature, residing in the Central Palace—this is the elixir’s body, bearing a mysterious image. The Central Palace is earth. Earth is the realm, and the Metal Mother dwells within it, hence it is said that \"Earth’s treasury releases its store, and gold and jade reveal their forms.\"\n\nExpounding the scripture a tenth time, withered bones revive, and all rise as complete beings. *The Inner Meaning* states: \"Expounding the scripture a tenth time\" is Heaven Five generating earth, with Earth Ten completing it. This is *li* separating from *ji* so that earth forms from fire, residing at the center as the root of all creation and the foundation of the elixir’s body. The *Daoist Scripture* says: \"The harmonious arises from the void.\" The harmony within qi is what enables the generation of the myriad things. Heaven Five’s earth is yang earth; Earth Ten’s earth is yin earth. When the two earths overlap, metal resides within them, hence the Reverted Elixir is called the \"knife-point.\" The marvel of the Reverted Elixir lies in reverting old age to youth and transcending the mundane to attain sagehood. The world’s people, bound to mortality, are but walking corpses in the eyes of those who behold them. Yet once this Way is attained and cultivated, one achieves longevity and does not become a ghost of the yellow springs—is this not \"withered bones reviving and all rising as complete beings\"? This is the completion of the Five Phases’ numbers.\n\nThe Han Celestial Master’s preface to *The Scripture of Divine Golden Fluid* states: \"The path of divine immortals, the subtlest of words, the supreme principle beyond principles, the great truth beyond what is so—all are fully contained in the profound tradition, not to be conveyed by even the slightest trace.\" The Most High likewise expounded this wondrous Way of emptiness and subtlety. At that time, every man and woman in the land turned their hearts toward it, all received protection and deliverance, and all attained longevity. Those who clearly grasped this Way achieved immortality and did not die. In that era, whether man or woman, old or young, all in the land received the sagely grace and were universally saved and delivered. The living did not die, and the dead revived.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* says: \"A land is like a single body; men and women are like yin and yang. Turning the heart is akin to mutual affinity. Protection and deliverance mean receiving nourishment.

He expounded the scripture a tenth time, and the boundless, innumerable hosts of perfected great spirits from the lower realm of the Infinite arrived, floating through the void.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* says: In terms of the scripture, when the Celestial Worthy expounded the scripture ten times, the great spirits of the ten directions arrived—these were the Three Origins and Nine Sages, the Nine Perfected and Nine Immortals, the lofty perfected and exalted sages, the celestial spirits and earthly deities, all assembling in the Azure Beginning Heaven’s Floating Black Realm to listen to the Dharma.\n\nIn terms of the elixir, when the Primordial Beginning expounded the scripture, true lead became the ancestor of the medicine, and mysterious essence formed the foundation of the cinnabar. The ten recitations correspond to the numbers of heaven and earth’s generation. The ten directions correspond to the numbers of the Five Phases’ combinations. One, three, five, seven, nine—twenty-five in total—are the celestial numbers, the essence of yang. Two, four, six, eight, ten—thirty in total—are the terrestrial numbers, the splendor of yin. One, two, three, four, five correspond to the four cardinal directions and the upper direction; six, seven, eight, nine, ten correspond to the four corners and the lower direction. The generative numbers of yang are five, the root of the Five Phases. The consummate numbers of yin are ten, the root of the myriad transformations. One and nine, four and six, each combine to make ten—metal and water share the same origin. Two and eight, three and seven, each combine to make ten—wood and fire share the same body. In sum, fifty-five, distributed among the five directions. One and six reside in the north; two and seven in the south; three and eight in the east; four and nine in the west; five and ten in the center. Applying the method of division, the five directions subtract one, two, three, four, five—these are the origins of water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. Subtracting again, one, two, three, four, five—these are the roots of the Five Phases. After subtraction, each of the five directions retains five numbers, totaling twenty-five, the root of the Five Phases, the true yang body of the central earth. Further removing the root numbers of the five directions—one from the north, two from the south, three from the east, four from the west, five from the center—reveals four remaining numbers in the north, symbolizing metal. Metal fundamentally generates water, yet metal itself is born from water, as lead arises from the qi of silver, and silver is born within lead—this is the child producing the mother. Metal is the tiger. Metal within water is the tiger born within water. Three remaining numbers in the south symbolize wood. Wood fundamentally generates fire, yet wood itself arises from fire, as mercury responds to the qi of lead to form cinnabar, and cinnabar is born from mercury—this is the child producing the mother. Wood is the dragon, the dragon emerging from within fire. Two remaining numbers in the east symbolize fire. Fire is born from wood, mercury drawn from cinnabar—this is the sevenfold return of cinnabar to its origin. One remaining number in the west symbolizes water. Water is born from metal, the one qi returning to its origin—this is the ninefold return of golden liquid to the true. The center, emptiness, combines the four images to form ten, revealing the wondrous function of true yin earth.\n\nThus, Master Zhang Ziyang said:\n*The dragon of thunder mercury emerges from the land of fire,*\n*The tiger of marsh lead is born in the region of water.*\n*These two things arise from the child producing the mother,*\n*The Five Phases must all enter the center.*\n\nHe also said:\n*The red dragon and black tiger each dwell west and east,*\n*The four images interact within the central earth.*\n*From this reversal and union, transformation is set in motion—*\n*Who could say the golden elixir would not succeed?*\n\nThe Perfected of the Great One said: \"The art of inverting the Five Phases—\n*The dragon emerges from within fire,*\n*The Five Phases do not proceed in order,*\n*The tiger is born within water—*\nThis is the meaning.\"\n\nThe arrival of the boundless great spirits takes the hidden movements of the pure and true Qian and Kun as its model, dividing the three hundred eighty-four lines, circulating within the fire, revolving the five stars and twenty-eight constellations, arrayed within the crucible, condensing the three thousand six hundred primordial qi, traversing the seventy-two seasonal nodes, driving the sixty-four hexagrams’ yin tally, stirring the twenty-four qi’s yang fire. Subtle and detailed, revealed in the hidden language of the heart’s mirror. Thus, heaven and earth cannot conceal the mechanism of creation, yin and yang cannot hide the root of nurturance. Thereby, spiritual transformations are boundless, and pure generation is achieved, all gathered within grasp, merged within the empty and cavernous.\n\nSomeone asked Cheng Yi: \"The sage does not learn from the immortal; their arts differ. Could the sage perform such things?\" He replied: \"This is a thief within heaven and earth. If one does not steal the mechanism of creation, how could one prolong life?\" Thus, the *Scripture of Unconscious Unison* says: \"Humans are the thieves of the myriad things.\" To steal creation and plunder the myriad things is to make all within heaven and earth one’s own—taking without prohibition, using without exhaustion.\n\nWhen the ten recitations were complete, the boundless perfected great spirits of the ten directions arrived simultaneously. The men and women of the land turned their hearts in reverence, coming like fine rain and dense mist.",

      "translated_text": "The innumerable multitude pressed upon the land, occupying half its breadth, and the earth sank unevenly—none could prevent it. When the Heavenly Venerable opened the realm, the ten thousand sages assembled, their majesty and virtue so weighty that the earth could not bear it, hence the uneven sinking. For extraordinary events, there are extraordinary responses. When Chan Master Farong of Niutou Mountain expounded the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra* and reached the \"Accomplishment of Stillness\" chapter, the earth trembled—how much more so when the August Emperor of Emptiness enacts transformation!\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: When the ten recitations were complete and the perfected great spirits of the ten directions arrived simultaneously, this was the settling of the spirit in quiescence, the return of qi to the chamber. When the men and women of the land turned their hearts in reverence, this was the blending and refinement of the yin and yang qi within the body. The gathering of spirit and qi exuded a dense, fragrant vapor. The *Cantong Qi* says: \"When gold and cinnabar enter the five viscera, their mist scatters like wind and rain.\" Gold is the purest essence of heaven and earth—it is spirit. Cinnabar is the pure quintessence of yin and yang—it is qi. Thus it is said: \"They came like fine rain and dense mist.\" The innumerable multitude, reaching the golden essence behind the elbow and the true qi beyond the Yang Pass, was the mutual stirring of nature and emotion, the silent operation of heaven’s mechanism, the mutual excitation of yin and yang, and the transformation of the true spirit. Though it is said that the body moves naturally, it still resides within the realm of effort, unable to avoid the alternations of restlessness overcoming cold and stillness overcoming heat. This is because, when held and filled, nature and emotion are not yet merged. Nature and emotion belong to earth, hence it is said that half the land was pressed upon, the earth sank unevenly, and none could prevent it.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning suspended a precious pearl, as large as a grain of millet, within the empty mystery, five measures above the earth. The pearl symbolizes the Dao; suspended in the empty mystery, it shares the meaning of the \"mysterious pearl.\" Within it, the transmission of scriptures reveals treasure within treasure, mystery within mystery, the true within the true, the Dao within the Dao. \"Five measures above the earth\" signifies that one departs from the Five Turbidities of the world and sheds the use of the Five Phases. When the Five Turbidities all emerge, afflictions naturally vanish; when the Five Phases are no longer used, mutual conquest ceases forever. Thus, when the Five Phases do not conquer one another, all things may be preserved, and one naturally attains long life and enduring vision, achieving the Dao and becoming a perfected being.\n\nThe Mysterious Master said: This is the precious pearl of Jade Purity, the Dao of the womb-transformation of divine immortals. The *Inner Meaning* states: The Primordial Beginning’s suspension of the pearl is the union of spirit and Dao. Previously, the lion upon which the scriptures were expounded was the spirit congealed within the chamber, proceeding from non-being to being. Now, this pearl suspended in the empty mystery transcends spirit and things, moving from being into non-being. The Heavenly Venerable, fearing that later students of the degenerate age would not grasp this principle and merely cling to dull emptiness, manifested wondrous transformations to clarify that within the utmost non-being, the utmost true and utmost pure abide. The scripture says: \"Vast and obscure, within it there is essence; its essence is most true, within it there is sincerity.\" In terms of principle, this is the return of spirit to the obscurity of nature, standing alone in perfect clarity, suddenly without obstruction, emptily without foundation. Radiant and joyful, dark and silent—it is not bound by the reckoning of the Five Phases nor sullied by the realm of the Five Turbidities. Master Chuan said: \"Forms and seeking are both delusion; formlessness and invisibility fall into barrenness. How could the resplendent and dense ever be separate? A single beam of cold light shines through the great void.\"\n\nThe Primordial Beginning ascended and led the great spirits of the perfected heavens, the lofty sages and venerable ones, the perfected of wondrous conduct, the perfected great spirits of the ten directions and the boundless realms—all the innumerable multitude—into the precious pearl. The heavenly beings gazed upward and saw them bustling as they entered the pearl’s mouth; once inside, their whereabouts were unknown. The Heavenly Venerable enacted wondrous and profound transformations, suspending the pearl within the empty mystery, its suspending thread unfathomable. He ascended and led the Three Origins and Nine Saints, the Nine Perfected and Nine Immortals, all into its midst. All the heavenly beings, not being the perfected of the heavens, the lofty sages, or the true persons, could not follow the transformative mechanism of non-action nor enter the wondrousness of the empty mystery; they could only gaze upward. They saw them bustling as they entered the pearl’s mouth; once inside, their whereabouts were unknown.\n\nMoreover, even lesser immortals of lower rank possess the wondrous ability to contain Mount Sumeru within a mustard seed and suspend heaven and earth within a gourd—how much more so the great sagely Heavenly Venerable, who unfolds and proclaims great transformations, manifesting divine marvels! The precious pearl, though said to be as large as a grain of millet, is already subtle and wondrous; to be five measures distant and still see the pearl within the empty mystery is beyond the capacity of heavenly beings, let alone perceiving its mouth. Furthermore, to witness the Heavenly Venerable leading the perfected sages into the realm of wondrous being and empty non-being—when the heavenly beings gazed upward as they followed the Heavenly Venerable into the pearl, they saw them enter its midst but could not perceive the wondrous transformations within.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: When the true spirit is already obscure, qi also follows into stillness, uniting with emptiness and merging with the non-being, ascending into the mysterious and entering the wondrous. This is called gathering the ten thousand beings into a single breath and dispersing a single breath into the ten thousand beings. In welcoming it, one does not see its beginning; in following it, one does not see its end. Its coming has no source; its going has no place. When the people of the land dispersed and moved, the earth returned to level stillness, no longer uneven or sunken.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: Movement and stillness both forgotten, being and non-being both relinquished. The Primordial Beginning then completed the recitation of the scriptures within the precious pearl. The *Inner Meaning* states: The Primordial Beginning is the spirit and the precious pearl—it is nature. \"Reciting the scriptures\" signifies illuminating the primordial qi as the body of the elixir. \"Completed\" means that spirit and nature are perfectly clear, utterly devoid of any thing. The assembled perfected monitored and transmitted it to me. The *Inner Meaning* states: The \"assembled perfected\" are the qi of wondrous transformation and arising. \"I\" is the Dao Lord.\n\nAt this time, joy and celebration were beyond words. The ritual matters were roughly concluded, and the various heavens returned to their positions. In an instant, all was silent, without lingering resonance.",

      "translated_text": "The *Inner Meaning* states: In the midst of practicing the work, wondrous responses are indescribable—like one who drinks water, knowing its warmth or coolness for oneself. When the work is complete, the myriad spirits return to their origin, and within the state of *huanghu*, luminosity is forgotten and reflection ceases.\n\nAt this time, when heavenly beings and humans encounter the scriptural Dharma, all universally receive deliverance, preserving their allotted years without harm or injury. The *Inner Meaning* states: Examining the past and mirroring the present, the principle is not distant. The scriptural Dharma and the Dao of the elixir share a single principle without distinction. The Sixth Patriarch said: \"My expounding of the Dharma is like the timely rain, universally moistening the earth. Your buddha-nature is like seeds—when they encounter this moisture, all sprout and grow.\" This is the principle of encountering the scriptural Dharma and universally receiving deliverance. The inner symbolic workings of the body embody this meaning.\n\nThose who attain it know its spirit and cherish it, understand its *qi* and treasure it. Thus, they may preserve their allotted years without harm or injury. \"Allotted years\" means avoiding untimely death. As for the single step beyond, one should advance further. The world turns in reverence, and all cultivate a heart of goodness: refraining from killing or harming, from envy or jealousy, from licentiousness or theft, from greed or desire, from hatred or resentment; speaking without embellishment, uttering no evil words; equalizing kindness and love, transforming even strangers into kin.\n\nThe *Severing Destiny* states: Harming through killing or injury is called \"harm\"; resenting others for surpassing oneself is called \"envy\"; hating one’s peers is called \"jealousy\"; male and female engaging improperly is called \"licentiousness\"; stealing others’ possessions is called \"theft\"; insatiability is called \"greed\"; indulgence in cravings is called \"desire\"; disliking others is called \"hatred\"; suspicion is called \"resentment.\" When the ten evils are extinguished, even strangers become kin, and when the myriad practices are mystically aligned, voices carry no strife.\n\nThe section on licentiousness refers to improper conduct between men and women, for the purpose of rectifying human relationships. For those cultivating the Way, it must be entirely abandoned. Thus, the *Supreme Mystery Numinous Writ* places licentious desire at the head of the ten defeats. Formerly, the Purple Void Primordial Lady and Lord Mao examined the gains and losses of perfected immortals under heaven—forty-seven fell in rank, while only two ascended. This was because they harbored desires for licentiousness while practicing the Way of the Supreme Perfected. Not only did they fall, but they were also subject to judgment by the Three Officials. Those seeking long life—how could they not sever such thoughts?\n\nThe section on theft does not only mean stealing others’ possessions; any acquisition not obtained by proper means is theft. The section on desire does not only mean indulgence in cravings; it refers to selfishness. The Most High said: \"No sin is greater than what desire makes permissible; no fault is greater than covetousness.\" When the heart of desire stirs, the self arises, and from this, all the aforementioned evils follow, leading to the corruption of state governance and the loss of peace among the multitudes. Can the heart that seeks profit not be guarded against?\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The human heart is inherently good, without anything inherently evil. Yet, it is obscured by material desires, dimming its original nature. Upon hearing the essentials of the Dao, all evils melt like ice, and self and others become one, with no barrier between close and distant. The matters described above are elaborated in detail in the *Treatise on Responses and Retributions*—they are the daily missteps of worldly people. The Shu scholar Li Changling’s explanation of karmic causes and conditions spans over a hundred thousand words; reading it sends a chill down the spine, so that not even the slightest selfish thought dares arise in the mind. It is of great benefit to the teachings of the world.\n\nCarefully observing the scriptural intent, the phrase \"all cultivate a heart of goodness, refraining from killing or harming, and so on\" means the complete absence of evil thoughts. If even the faintest evil thought lingers in the heart, it cannot be called good. Why? Can jade with the slightest flaw still be called fine jade? Good and evil do not wait to manifest in action; the moment a thought arises, the divine records it.\n\nFormerly, Wei Zhongda, a court academician, was summoned to the netherworld. The nether official ordered the clerks to present his records of good and evil. When they arrived, the evil record filled the courtyard, while the good record was as thin as a chopstick. The nether official changed countenance and ordered a scale to weigh them. The small scroll of good deeds outweighed the evil record, shaking the earth. The official then joyfully said: \"You may depart.\" Wei said: \"I am not yet forty—how could I have committed so many evils?\" The official replied: \"Not so. Any improper thought is recorded; it does not wait for a transgression.\" Wei asked: \"Then what is recorded on the small scroll?\" The official said: \"The court once undertook a great construction project to repair the stone bridge of Three Mountains. You submitted a memorial to admonish and stop it—this is the draft of that memorial.\" Wei said: \"Though I submitted it, the court did not heed it. What benefit did it bring, that it could have such power?\" The official said: \"Though the court did not heed it, the thought in your heart was already sufficient. Had they listened, your merit would have been far greater. You would have immediately attained liberation from the world—how could you have been summoned here? Alas, your evil thoughts were too numerous, reducing your merit by half. You can no longer hope for a high position.\"\n\nAlas! Even empty thoughts diminish fortune—how much more so for actual transgressions. The retributions of good and evil are too numerous to record entirely, but observing Fan Wenzheng’s account of Dou the Remonstrator’s *Record of Hidden Virtues* suffices to know that goodness is attainable.\n\nSome may ask: \"Though I treat others with goodness, if they repay me with evil, how can I remain at peace?\" Not so. If one knows the words of the Red Lord of Southern Marchmount, the *qi* will naturally be at peace. The Red Lord of Southern Marchmount said: \"If others bring misfortune upon me, but I respond with fortune, then the *qi* of fortune and virtue will always arise within me, while the *qi* of harm and calamity will naturally befall them.\" This is the great practice of those who study the Dao. Could the Red Lord of Southern Marchmount deceive others?",

      "translated_text": "When the state is secure and the people prosper, all rejoice in great peace—this is the result of universally cultivating a heart of goodness.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: According to what the Most High Lord Lao conferred upon the Perfected Gan Ji as the Way of Great Peace, its essential teaching is this: when a person is born, Heaven bestows spirit upon them, Earth bestows essence, and the harmonious center bestows *qi*. If one can preserve essence, cherish spirit, and safeguard *qi*, then inwardly one preserves the body and attains long life, while outwardly one brings the state to great peace.\n\nIt further states: The conduct of a minister should be to love their ruler above all, desiring their long life. As a child, one should think of their parents, fearing their mortality, and transform their intentions through moral influence, guiding them into the Dao, constantly seeking rare formulas and extraordinary arts to offer to ruler and kin. As a disciple, one should remember the kindness of their teacher. A person is born of their parents, their virtue and power are perfected by their teacher, and they attain honor through their ruler. Ever mindful of ruler, father, and teacher—when they grow old and can no longer repay them—one may study further, seek wise counsel, and obtain rare formulas and wondrous methods to benefit them. Such is the most excellent loyal minister, filial child, and obedient disciple of the High Antiquity and August Sovereign. If all people act thus, the world will be at great peace.\n\nWhat is within must manifest without: thus, virtuous conduct becomes visible as good fortune, and the clarity of the spirit-nature is called wisdom. Cultivating both fortune and wisdom, inwardly and outwardly, one achieves mutual fulfillment. The state is like the body, the people like *qi*; the state has its ruler, the body its heart. When the ruler governs well, the people are at peace; when the heart is upright, *qi* is harmonious.\n\nThe *Classic* says: \"If I practice non-action, the people transform themselves; if I love stillness, the people rectify themselves; if I am without affairs, the people enrich themselves; if I am without desire, the people become simple.\" Governing the state and cultivating the heart share the same principle.\n\nWhen the *Classic* first emerged to instruct a single state, those who approached it with utmost sincerity, revered its teachings, honored its rituals, and respected its virtue all attained deliverance from the world.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: When the *Classic* is revealed and teachings are established, people follow the Dao in practice. The word \"approach\" (*yu*) means \"beforehand\" or \"in advance.\" People are born endowed with the *qi* of the Dao—how could their hearts be without it? Yet, deluded by illusory attachments, they sink into confusion and darkness. Upon encountering the *Classic* and its teachings, this heart regains clarity, like pointing out the cinnabar elixir—it is each person’s original possession, not something that was absent before and now exists. Though obtained after hearing the *Classic* and the Dao, it was already present before such hearing. Hence, it is said: \"approaching with utmost sincerity.\"\n\n\"Revering\" (*zong*) means taking the Dao as one’s ancestor. \"Upholding\" (*feng*) means exalting its texts. \"Ritual\" (*li*) means honoring its methods. \"Respect\" (*jing*) means venerating its virtue.\n\nThus, the *Sutra of Origins* states: Those who practice the Dao should know the methods of the Way, virtue, *Classic*, and conduct. The Way is the path; virtue and power are good works; the *Classic* is the direct path; conduct is the steps taken; method is completion. The Way and *Classic* can be cultivated to attain the Dao—there is a completed path to follow.\n\nIf people act accordingly, all will attain deliverance from the world.\n\nThe Dao says: What the Most High Heavenly Worthy expounds in the *Classic* consists entirely of the hidden rhymes of the inner names of the Celestial Emperors—these are the inner sounds of the Jade Characters of the Heavenly Emperor. They are also the inner taboo names of demon kings and the hidden names of the hundred spirits, not ordinary words of the world.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The so-called inner names of the Celestial Emperors, hidden rhymes, inner taboo names of demon kings, and hidden names of the hundred spirits are like what the *Elixir Classic* describes: solar soul and lunar spirit, Metal Tiger and Wood Dragon, mercury and cinnabar, red lead and black tin, yellow sprout and white snow, the maiden and the infant, the yellow woman and the golden lord, the furnace and the cauldron. Though their names and designations differ, all are the primordial unity of *qi*, not separate yin or miscellaneous things.\n\nThe highest sages who have attained perfection as Perfected Ones penetrate the profound and fathom the subtle.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The highest sages who cultivate the wondrous Dao have already achieved success. The Perfected Ones thoroughly understand the profound principles and comprehend the mysteries. Their practice is substantive, not clinging to empty texts. For example, the *Red Writ of Chaos*, the Three Luminaries revealed by the Primordial Ancestor at the dawn of kalpas, and the great circulation of Brahman *qi*—they know their depths and grasp their essential mechanisms. Thus, the wonders of Heaven and Earth’s creation, the principles of life and death, being and non-being, all lie before their eyes, not far from the body.\n\nIf one can master its chapters and recite them ten times,\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: Having penetrated the profound and fathomed the subtle, one can know the Dao. The effect of ten recitations equals the merit of the Primordial Ancestor. In terms of the elixir, ten recitations correspond to ten months in the chamber in practice, and nine revolutions in principle.\n\nThe myriad heavens sing from afar, praising their merit. The ten thousand emperors prepare rites.",
      "overlap_context": " me with evil, how can I remain at peace?\" Not so. If one knows the words of the Red Lord of Southern Marchmount, the *qi* will naturally be at peace. The Red Lord of Southern Marchmount said: \"If others bring misfortune upon me, but I respond with fortune, then the *qi* of fortune and virtue will always arise within me, while the *qi* of harm and calamity will naturally befall them.\" This is the great practice of those who study the Dao. Could the Red Lord of Southern Marchmount deceive others?",

      "translated_text": "Revere this scripture. When rivers and seas lie in silent stillness, even as the Duke of Zhou governed the realm, the seas did not stir their waves. When the Perfected recite the scripture, the Yellow River runs clear and the seas remain serene. Though the affairs differ, the principle is one; though the merits vary, their virtue is the same.\n\nMountains and peaks store clouds. They gather clouds to bring forth rain, nourishing the myriad beings. Sun and moon halt their radiance; the celestial pivot ceases its turning. The effect of ten recitations equals the merit of the Primordial Ancestor—this is what is meant.\n\nAll demons bind their forms; ghostly spirits perish in clarity. The scripture speaks of binding: dispatching demonic spirits and beheading the six ghostly blades. Reviving the dead from corpses, transforming white bones into living beings—such was Lord Lao’s restoration of Xu Jia’s withered bones.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: When the myriad heavens sing from afar and the ten thousand emperors prepare rites, this is what *Zhuangzi* calls “tranquil and boundless, with all beauties following in its wake”—the virtue of Heaven and Earth, the Dao of the sage. The “silent stillness of rivers and seas” refers to the River of Love and the Sea of Suffering, both born of the illusory delusions of the human heart. Love arises from emotion; suffering stems from perception. Once one’s virtue harmonizes with Heaven and Earth and one’s Dao aligns with the sagely Perfected, the River of Love falls silent and the Sea of Suffering lies profoundly still.\n\n“Mountains and peaks store clouds” refers to what the *Huangting Jing* calls “the cloud-*qi* of the Five Peaks”—here, the expansive *qi* of the five viscera. The Perfected, whose breath is deep and serene, fill their five viscera with *qi*, like mountains gathering clouds.\n\n“Sun and moon” are the two eyes; “radiance” is their light, which is spirit. When the Perfected’s spirit does not stray outward, their eyes, though observing things, remain unmoving—hence “halting their radiance.” The “celestial pivot” is the Dipper’s handle. The human heart, mirroring this axis, turns yet does not shift; though it observes and examines, it seems motionless. The Perfected, following nature, respond to things while remaining profoundly still—hence “ceases its turning.”\n\n“All demons” are the myriad distractions that confuse and disturb the heart. When one follows nature, responding as if to nothing, this is called “binding their forms.” “Ghostly spirits” are the Three Corpses. If the Three Corpses do not depart, the Dao cannot be achieved. By embodying purity, the Three Corpses naturally perish—hence “perishing in clarity.”\n\n“Reviving the dead from corpses, transforming white bones into living beings”: Those who attain the elixir not only perfect themselves but must extend their merit to others. As the *Pure Brightness* method states: “Once my elixir is complete, transformation is effortless. What remains lacking is the Celestial Mandate; thus, one accumulates merit to await the true decree.” For all beings of good conduct, one may prolong their years and increase their lifespan. If misfortune strikes and they fall ill or die, one revives them—such was the case when the Perfected Lord Wu raised Yu Qing from the dead.\n\nThe most devoted scholars—those whose hearts are firm as iron and stone, whose conduct stands unshaken by water or fire, whom neither Heaven and Earth can surpass nor ghosts and spirits delude, who walk paths others cannot tread—are those whose true names reside above the Great Ultimate. Yet even more advanced are those who do not wait for thoughts to arise or affairs to arrive before practicing, but instead cultivate diligently in the spaces between thought and no-thought, action and inaction. Such Perfected are of a slightly lesser rank.\n\nAfter ten recitations, the Five Emperors stand guard, and the Three Realms bow in reverence. This scripture is formed of wondrous *qi*, coalescing into numinous text—the ancestral origin of the ten thousand *qi*. Wherever the *qi* of the Five Phases resides, the spirits of the Five *Qi* follow, known as the Emperors. Thus, “the Five Emperors stand guard.” When Ji Kangzi asked Confucius about the Five Emperors, Confucius replied: “They assist the Supreme Emperor, governing as the Five Emperors.”\n\nThe “Three Realms” are the great demons of the Three Realms. When the most devoted scholars accumulate merit through steadfast practice, the demon kings of the Three Realms protect and revere them—hence “the Three Realms bow in reverence.” Demonic spirits lose their sight; ghostly beings perish in clarity. Once the great demons offer protection and reverence, how dare ghosts and spirits meet their gaze? This is the principle of binding forms and extinguishing clarity.\n\nSaving those on the verge of death, restoring life where it has been severed.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The Five Emperors are the spirits of the five viscera—liver-soul, lung-po, heart-spirit, kidney-essence, and spleen-intent. When one is tranquil, the spirit is settled, the soul clear, the intent at peace, the po composed, and essence unlost. But when one is restless and competitive, the spirit tires, the soul grows turbid, the intent scatters, the po disperses, and essence dissipates in ruin.\n\nThough all desire peace and longevity, daily affairs weary the spirit, allowing the Three Corpses and Nine Worms to become thieves within. Thus, the true *qi* of the Crimson Palace is disturbed. For those who cultivate the elixir, the corpse-worms vanish entirely.",

      "translated_text": "The spirits of the five viscera each fulfill their duties, thus they are called \"attendants and guardians.\" The Three Realms are the Three Corpses—these are the turbid, murky, and perverse *qi* of the three divisions of the human body, belonging to the realms of the three malefactors. The Upper Corpse, Peng Ju, dwells in the head; the Middle Corpse, Peng Zhi, dwells in the intestines; the Lower Corpse, Peng Qiao, dwells in the feet. All human cravings, lusts, and myriad unwholesome deeds are instigated by these corpse-demons. On the day of *gengshen*, they ascend to the Heavenly Bureau to report one’s transgressions, omitting not even the slightest fault. They delight in hastening a person’s death. Thus, Ge Zhichuan said: \"Can you sever the enmity of the Three Peng?\" The Three Peng are the Three Corpses. Methods to eradicate them are numerous, fully recorded in the *Daoist Canon* under the *Gengshen* section. Yet none compare to the marvel of the Golden Elixir. An ancient poem states: \"Of all the boundless methods in the world, only the elixir can slay the Three Corpses.\" Master Zhang the Perfected said: \"Since ancient times, the *geng* and *jia* days enforce the decree; slay the Three Corpses, and the Dao may be attained.\" This is the transformation of evil into benevolence, the subjugation of the stubborn to goodness. Thus, they are made to bow in submission. As for demonic essences and spectral apparitions—these belong to the Nine Worms and Six Thieves. The Three Corpses are their ringleaders; the worms and thieves, their followers. Destroy the ringleaders, and the followers scatter of themselves. Hence, it is said: \"their eyes are extinguished, their clarity lost.\"\n\nThus, one may prolong the years of those on the verge of death and restore life where it has been severed. The spirit and *qi* grow robust and flourishing. Scholars, exert yourselves in this practice—its merit is self-evident.\n\nThe reason for this is that when a scholar’s impure *qi* has not yet dissipated and their body has not attained true transparency, their summons may command the ten directions, yet their authority does not govern the celestial administration. Their virtue may subdue earthly spirits and bind demonic spirits, but this only averts death—it does not restore life. The *Inner Meaning* states: If a scholar’s desires remain unsevered and their nature and principle are not yet illuminated, though they diligently explore and refine, they will not penetrate the mysteries of the void. They may only preserve the spirit, husband the *qi*, subdue yin demons, prolong their years, and ward off illness. The Way of long life remains beyond their hope.\n\nTo recite this chapter lightly brings misfortune upon oneself. This refers to failing to rectify one’s form and attire, neglecting the rituals and protocols, reciting casually whether standing, sitting, lying, or walking. If one recites without reverence, it would be better not to recite at all. The *Inner Meaning* states: \"To recite this chapter lightly\" means to treat the Dao with frivolity. The essence of the Golden Elixir lies wholly in harmonious regulation. First, one must act in gathering and refining; next, one must be vigilant in maintaining fullness, awaiting the completion of the crucible and the readiness of the medicinal ingredients. Then, one advances the talismanic fire, regulates the withdrawal and addition of mercury and lead, aligning the hours and seasons without error. Thus, the *qi* of yin and yang becomes abundant, the pearl of *Li* and *Kan* is perfected, the spirit transforms into the true, and one attains long life and enduring vision.\n\nIf, however, one is hasty in emotion and negligent in heart, acting recklessly and carelessly, the celestial cycles fall out of alignment, the talismanic nodes fail to correspond—then scorching heat arises in midwinter, bitter frost in midsummer, the Maiden of Cinnabar flees, the Crimson Dragon bolts. The spirit and essence are lost, the golden liquid is unattainable, the *qi* is exhausted, the body emaciated, the form declines, and life perishes.\n\nThrough reverent offering and solemn ritual, the household flourishes. Generation after generation prospers, bound to good causes. Myriad calamities do not encroach; divine luminaries guard the gate. The *Inner Meaning* states: If one cultivates with earnest reverence, externally, the household thrives; internally, body and mind find peace. Daily, one’s virtue is renewed, and every action meets with good fortune. Disasters do not intrude; divine luminaries provide protection.\n\nThis scripture is exalted and wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital. It delivers countless beings and serves as the origin of the myriad Daoist ways. Its majestic model is of virtue beyond measure. The *Inner Meaning* states: The *Seven Bamboo Slips of the Scriptural Teachings* states: \"The Three Caverns are the wondrous essence of the One Vehicle, the profound words of the Three Realms. Those who comprehend them may ascend as supreme sages; those who awaken to them may rise as lofty perfected ones. Dragon scripts and phoenix seals reveal the finest explications of the supreme principle; jade tablets and golden books guide the essential techniques for returning to the source.\" Thus, this scripture is called \"exalted and wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital,\" for it is the crown of the Three Caverns. From ancient times to the present, no immortal, perfected one, or supreme sage has not relied upon it for cultivation and realization. Records and registers abound—none can count their number. The myriad methods and thousand gates all emerge from this. Vast and boundless, it transcends naming, thought, and discussion.\n\nThe Dao states: Whoever recites this scripture ten times will have all the heavens arrive, and the suffering souls of billions of ancestors will immediately receive deliverance, ascending to the Vermilion Palace. There is no distinction of high or low in recitation. Those who, in accordance with the method, recite with a concentrated mind ten times will have all the heavens arrive, and the host of sages descend and gather in their ancestral temple. They will rescue the suffering souls of their ancestors and the afflicted spirits of their clan, lifting them from the Northern Mansion and ushering them into the Southern Palace. After nine years of refinement, they will be transformed and reborn, becoming noble persons. Those who love learning, fulfill the scripture’s merit, and perfect their virtue will all attain divine transcendence, ascending to the Golden Gates and roaming the Jade Capital.\n\nThe \"nine years\" refers to the nine-year refinement, following the number of the Three Fires—three times three makes nine. The Vermilion Palace belongs to the south, which pertains to fire. Refining the form with fire is thus called the Three Fires. After nine years of refinement and transformation, one is then reborn into nobility. Upon birth, one immediately cultivates this scripture. The former practice remains, and when the merit of ten thousand recitations is complete and the virtue of three thousand is restored, one transcends and ascends, directly attaining divine transcendence. They ascend to the Golden Gates to serve the Sage Lord and roam the Jade Capital to pay homage to the Primordial Beginning.\n\nAccording to the *Three Primal Commandments*, the standards for deliverance in the Vermilion Numinosity include three grades: great fortune requires three years, medium fortune nine years, and lesser fortune twenty-four years.

      "translated_text": "The billions of ancestors and forebears are but transient unions of father and mother; the suffering souls and hidden spirits, once they possess form, are all shrouded in the murky qi of ignorance—yet all may receive deliverance. Those who ascend to the Vermilion Palace undergo the refinement of this transient, murky qi, transcending into the radiant domain of luminous clarity. The standard for all is nine years of transformation and rebirth. To become a noble being means that the refining of the transient, murky qi wholly transforms it into yang spirit, rebirthing true qi, where the myriad spirits become one spirit and the myriad qi become one qi—this is the nurturing of the sacred embryo. Scholars who attain this station have already achieved the fullness of spirit and the sufficiency of qi, prolonging life and extending years; yet this is not yet what may be called immortality. Thus it is said: those who diligently study the scriptures, whose merit is complete and virtue perfected, all attain divine transcendence. Yet further cultivation is still required, for inner attainment must be realized and virtuous conduct fulfilled before one may aspire to such a state.\n\nInner attainment refers to the Dao of fire phases, embryo liberation, and spirit transformation—methods of practice that will be detailed later. Virtuous conduct lies in aiding others and benefiting the world, as exemplified by the Han Celestial Master discerning between humans and ghosts, Master Ge universally delivering suffering souls, and Perfected Lord Xu slaying dragons and serpents. The scripture states: though a scholar may uphold the Dao, without performing meritorious deeds, they cannot attain it. In ancient times, when the Han Celestial Master’s elixir was complete but not yet ingested, he said to Perfected Lord Wang: \"The divine elixir is accomplished; if I consume it, I shall surely ascend to heaven and become a perfected one. Yet I have not yet performed great virtue. I must first serve the nation and the people, eliminating harm and promoting benefit, before I may ingest the elixir and lightly ascend. Only then will I have served the Three Realms without shame.\" Only thus may one ascend to the Golden Gates and roam the Jade Capital.\n\nScholars of the highest order who study and recite this scripture all receive deliverance and ascend to the Southern Palace. Those of the highest learning, upon hearing the Dao, practice diligently, study the teachings without fail, and persevere through cold and heat—these are the immortals recorded below the Nine Palaces of Great Clarity. Having recited this scripture, they attain the Dao in body and ascend to the immortal realm, undergoing refinement in the Southern Palace of Vermilion Numinosity. When the hun and po ascend as immortals, the ghostly substance is tempered by fire; when the living vessel attains the Dao, the filth and defilement are purged by fire—thus all enter the Southern Palace before ascending to their true original station.\n\nThose in the world who recite this scripture extend their years and prolong their lives, later attaining the Dao of corpse liberation. Their souls temporarily dissolve, sparing them the underworld, and they swiftly regain form, roaming the vast heavens. Ordinary people—those not set apart from the multitude—though their ancestral blessings are shallow and their personal merit slight, may still enjoy long life in their years. Upon death, their forms dissolve temporarily. Unbound by the regulations of the Three Offices or the trials of the Nine Bureaus, after a set number of ascents, their spirits return and their forms are restored. Having transformed their appearance in the halls of the Three Palaces and renewed their youthful countenance in the chambers of the Nine Refinements, they do not enter the upper palaces of the South but instead traverse the celestial realms.\n\nCorpse liberation takes four forms:\nFirst, liberation by violence, as when Ji Kang met execution in the marketplace or the Prince of Huainan entrusted his form to prison.\nSecond, liberation by writing, as when Ci Qing exchanged his essence for sandals or Lord Changfang assumed the guise of bamboo.\nThird, liberation through water or fire, as when Feng Yi drowned in the great river or Feng Zi was consumed by the fire tree.\nFourth, liberation through the Great Yin’s refinement, where the body appears dead—feet uncyanosed, skin unwrinkled, eyes undimmed—yet remains pliable to others, also a form of corpse liberation. The flesh remains uncorrupted for a hundred years before reviving as a complete person.\n\nThe *True Records* states: corpse-liberation immortals may not ride the floral canopy, mount flying dragons, ascend the Great Ultimate, or roam the Nine Palaces—they merely avoid death. The *Inner Meaning* says: though the methods of practice differ, their success is the same. The Dao of the golden elixir is rare to encounter yet easy to accomplish. If one’s past life aligns with the truth and they obtain it, they must strive to practice, surely aligning with the scripture’s intent without doubt. This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering boundless beings. All heavenly and mortal beings receive its blessings, and immeasurable fortune extends to the living and the dead.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: this scripture is profound and recondite, the Dao’s most mysterious essence, broadly aiding sentient beings and universally delivering the innumerable. When the scripture’s merit is complete and the elixir’s Dao perfected, the departed receive liberation’s grace, and the living are endowed with life’s blessings. Treasured by heaven, it is not transmitted to the lower world. Only the most devoted scholars, offering gold and treasure with sincere hearts, may swear oaths to heaven and receive it. To lightly divulge or disdain it brings calamity upon nine generations, condemning them to eternal servitude as ghostly officials.\n\nSuch servitude entails the dead soul’s banishment to the ranks of:\n- Heavenly servitors, who drive thunder and wield lightning;\n- Earthly servitors, who bear sand and carry stones;\n- Watery servitors, who lash the waves of the boundless deep.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* says: the Three Caverns’ true scriptures are recorded in the golden registers, hidden in the Mystic Capital, revealed but once in ten thousand kalpas. Transmission requires oaths, as the scriptures themselves decree. In a past kalpa, when the world’s fortunes were dire and its destiny obstructed, the Tortoise Mother of the Western Terrace petitioned the Jade Capital, and thus it was bestowed to deliver the people. The Jade Dawn Dao Lord transmitted it to Perfected Lord Xuan Yi, who passed it to Perfected Lord Xu of the Great Ultimate, who then entrusted it to Master Ge, spreading it through the world. The method encompasses both inner and outer aspects, both matters preserved.\n\nRegarding the elixir, prohibitions are especially strict. One must swear solemn vows, daring not to leak its secrets. The inner symbolism’s mechanisms have already been disclosed; one must invoke heaven in practice, broadly aiding and uplifting others. Those who receive this must never treat it lightly. Divine might protects and guards, while numinous officials oversee and observe. To violate this oath brings personal calamity and implicates nine generations, with inescapable punishment in the netherworld.\n\nThe Five Emperors who attend the scripture, along with their attendants, have already been explained. Twenty-four Jade Lads and twenty-four Jade Maidens, totaling forty-eight, safeguard the sacred text and protect the scripture’s recipients. The maidens, in particular, constantly guard the divine scripture and also protect those who recite it.",

      "translated_text": "Refining the elixir and gathering the medicine take *yin* and *shen* as the phases of ascent and descent. *Yin* marks the rise of yang; to practice the work at *shen*-hour, one must first guard at *yin*-hour, then apply it at *shen*-hour. A prolonged fast is the purification of the heart. Reciting the scripture is the gathering of *qi*—this is called gathering the medicine. The souls of past generations are *yin*-*qi*. Though yang-*qi* is said to arise at *zi*-hour, a single yang still lies beneath five *yin*. By *yin*-hour, *yin* and yang are evenly matched, *yin* above and yang below, pent up and not yet free—hence it is called ghostly servitude. When at *shen*-hour the method is applied to steam and refine, yang-*qi* surges upward and ascends into the *Li* Palace—can this not be called severing earthly servitude and delivering them to the Southern Palace?\n\nIn the seventh month, observe a prolonged fast and chant this scripture to attain immortality, have one’s name inscribed in the registers of the heavens, recorded on the Yellow Register and White Tablet, and have death erased and life bestowed. The seventh month is the great celebration of the Middle Prime. It extends to one’s own person: the heavens inscribe one’s name for ascension on the White Tablet, while Fengdu strikes one’s name from the Black Book of the dead. One attains immortality and ascends to the Heavenly Court. The Yellow Register and White Tablet are written in gold on tablets of white jade. All methods of Daoist cultivation universally deliver the nine orifices and bridge the realms of life and death.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The seventh month is *shen*, the phase of yang’s retreat. To practice the work at *yin*-hour, one must first guard at *shen*-hour. By *yin*-hour, mercury is circulated and lead is infused, entering the crucible to form the treasure—this is also called gathering the medicine or casting the crucible. Thus yang-*qi* grows daily stronger while *yin*-*qi* daily wanes. What was purely *yin* becomes a ghost; what is purely yang becomes an immortal. As yang-*qi* strengthens, the gradual refinement of immortality begins. When merit is complete and *qi* is full, the spirit transforms and one attains long life—hence it is said one attains immortality. All who achieve the Dao have their names stricken from Fengdu and transferred to the registers of immortals, receiving charts and records to ascend—thus it is said their names are inscribed in the heavens on the Yellow Register and White Tablet, and death is erased while life is bestowed.\n\nIn the tenth month, observe a prolonged fast and chant this scripture for the sake of the king, the lord, ruler and ministers, father and son, to secure the nation’s destiny, preserve the heavens’ enduring existence, and ensure the lineage continues unbroken. Always be a sovereign, secure in one’s domain, with the people proclaiming great peace. *Yin* in the first month is the ghostly path, hence it delivers the departed; *shen* in the seventh month is the human gate, hence it delivers oneself; *hai* in the tenth month is the heavenly gate, hence it secures the nation’s destiny for the emperor and ensures everlasting peace.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: When the medicine is fully gathered and the crucible is perfectly cast, enter the chamber in the tenth month to harmonize spirit and *qi*. Beginning fifteen days before the winter solstice, carefully guard the spirit between the kidneys—this is called fortifying the numinous root, causing the root’s original primordial spirit and *qi* to arise together. The nation is the body. The spirit is the body’s lord; *qi* is the spirit’s minister. When spirit is full and *qi* is abundant, the hundred bones are all ordered. The elixir is completed, the form is shed, and one attains long life and enduring vision. Bone and flesh ascend together, form and spirit are both wondrous—just as the scripture describes.\n\nOn the eight nodal days, chant this scripture to become a Perfected One of the Nine Palaces. On the eight nodal days, the Primordial Beginning dispatches Heavenly Worthies, Heavenly Lords, Heavenly Emperors, and immortals with their hosts to instruct and transform the world, delivering all beings. The Northern Dipper, Southern Asterism, Four Directors, and Five Emperors also descend to record merits and transgressions. All beings that partake of *qi*—on these days, each undergoes transformation: flying, crawling, plants, trees, creatures of the air and water—all respond to conditions, changing the old and renewing themselves. Light may become heavy, heavy may become light. Good and evil reverse, the movement of *qi* and images occurs naturally. Those who study the higher teachings should on these days meditate and offer prayers, adapting to change, cultivating good and eliminating evil, advancing brightness and abandoning darkness, entering rectitude and expelling perversity, refining the false into the true, striving to ascend to perfection, delivering all beings, and nurturing the myriad things.\n\nThe eight nodes correspond to the eight trigrams and nine palaces. Thus, chanting the scripture on the eight nodes allows one to become a Perfected One of the Nine Palaces.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: On the eight nodes, enter the chamber, circulate the talisman, and advance the fire. Beginning on the winter solstice at *zi*-hour, invoke the Fire Spirit and guard it in the kidneys. The yang fire circulates, and the spirit follows it. The kidneys are the root; the spirit chamber is the stem. From root to stem, root and stem are connected, forming the embryo and bearing fruit. One cycle spans three hours, from *zi* to the end of *yin*. Metal and fire press forward, driving it to the spirit chamber. The elixir gradually forms, corresponding to the winter solstice and the *Li-Chun* node, the *Kan* and *Gen* trigrams. At *mao*-hour, bathe; at *chen*-hour, advance the fire until the end of *si*. Metal and fire press forward, driving it to the sea of marrow, corresponding to the spring equinox and *Li-Xia* node, the *Zhen* and *Xun* trigrams. When the yang fire reaches its peak at *wu*-hour, circulate the talisman until the end of *shen*. Metal and water propel it, entering the chamber from the Magpie Bridge at the double pass. The dark pearl gradually appears, corresponding to the summer solstice and *Li-Qiu* node, the *Li* and *Kun* trigrams. At *you*-hour, bathe; at *xu*-hour, circulate the talisman until the end of *hai*. True *qi* returns to the origin, and a single yang revives, corresponding to the autumn equinox and *Li-Dong* node, the *Dui* and *Qian* trigrams. This cycle repeats endlessly. Thus, a year’s work is compressed into a single day to correspond to the eight nodes, using the eight trigrams as talismans. All these operations of yang fire and yin talismans return to the Central Palace. Nurturing the sacred embryo for ten months, when *qi* is full, the precious crucible’s work is complete. The embryo is shed, the spirit transforms—this is the Perfected One. The eight trigrams are arrayed in a circle, solid without and empty within. The *Book of Changes* says: \"The eight trigrams are arrayed, and the images are within them.\" This is why one becomes a Perfected One of the Nine Palaces.\n\nOn one’s natal day, chant this scripture to purify and rectify the hun-soul and spirit, preserve the myriad *qi* for eternity, avoid suffering and affliction, and radiate light from the body. The Three Realms provide attendants, the Five Emperors oversee reception, the myriad spirits pay homage, one’s name is inscribed in heaven, merit is complete and virtue perfected, and one ascends to the Upper Clarity.",

      "translated_text": "The human body possesses three *hun*-souls: one resides in the celestial bureaus, originally belonging to its destined office; one dwells in the earthly prisons, and one abides within the physical form. The seven *po*-souls remain constantly present, never dispersing. On one’s natal day, the *hun*-souls descend into the body to join the corpse, merging in an unbroken cycle of return. Thus, the living person remains at peace, free from calamity and illness. If on that day one purifies body and mind, abstains from wine and lust, dons new garments, burns incense, and cultivates goodness—and further, if one sleeps briefly—then the *hun* and *po* unite, yin and yang merge, the Dao’s *qi* flourishes within, and the root of life is firmly secured. But if one indulges in wine and lust, befuddling the body, then when the *hun* should return, it lingers three paces away, unable to rejoin. Filth and defilement assail it, and the *hun* retreats. If this befuddlement occurs thrice, and the *hun* fails to unite with the *po*, yang wanes while yin waxes, and the numinous *po* consorts with yin ghosts. This gives rise to wandering nightmares, excessive sleep, confusion, and the onset of calamity and illness, ultimately leading to death. Yet if one observes a fast and recites scriptures on one’s natal day, the aforementioned responses occur: merit is complete, virtue perfected, and one ascends in flight.\n\nHaving cultivated and recited on one’s natal day, one thereby preserves one’s spirit and *qi*. The sages established these models, all for good reason. Extending this principle, the Way of cultivating the Real becomes self-evident.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: When the firing process is complete, practice the Way of shedding the embryo and transforming the spirit. The sacred embryo abides within the Sea of Marrow. Taking the sixty-day cycle of the stars as the period, one full natal cycle aligns with the stellar number. Suddenly, as if a thunderclap resounds, the Gate of Heaven splits open, the sacred embryo emerges, the mortal husk is shed for immortality, and one attains everlasting life. The Demon Kings bear witness, the hosts of heaven offer reception, merit is fulfilled, virtue exalted, and ascension awaits.\n\nLi Changling said: Merit is the work of daily practice; virtue is the renewal of each day. If one is as earnest as a farmer awaiting the harvest, as diligent as a merchant pursuing wealth—today accumulating virtue, tomorrow again accumulating virtue; today amassing merit, tomorrow again amassing merit—then the celestial immortal’s one thousand three hundred good deeds may be accomplished in four years, and the earthly immortal’s three hundred good deeds in one year. Yet most people falter midway, failing to heed the lessons of drilling stone or bowing to trees.\n\nThe Lady of Purple Tenuity said: Long ago, there was a Master Fu who, from youth, loved the Dao. He entered a stone chamber on Mount Jiao and practiced for seven years. Suddenly, he encountered the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate, who bestowed upon him a wooden drill and instructed him to bore through a stone chime. The Perfected One warned: \"When the stone is pierced, I shall deliver you.\" The stone was over five feet thick, yet Master Fu drilled without cease for forty-seven years. The stone was suddenly pierced, and the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate indeed came to deliver him.\n\nThe Lady of Southern Marchmount also said: Once, a man resolved to pursue the Dao but knew not the method. Day and night, he bowed to a withered tree, beseeching long life, never ceasing. After twenty-eight years, the tree suddenly bloomed, and its blossoms exuded a sap like honey. The man consumed the flowers and sap, and thus attained deliverance from the world. Alas! If drilling stone and bowing to trees can lead to deliverance, how much more so the holding of scriptures and practice of the wondrous Dao—could there be any who fail to attain it?\n\nThe Dao teaches: On days of practice, one should bathe in fragrant waters, fast, and enter the chamber. Facing east, knock the teeth thirty-two times, making it heard in the thirty-two heavens, and bow in the heart thirty-two times. On days of scripture recitation, first don proper attire, wash the hands and rinse the mouth, and place the scripture upon the desk. Then burn incense, perform the ritual invocation, kneel, and declare one’s intent to recite. Sit upright facing east, burn incense, open the scripture, focus the mind, and read in a soft voice. If an error occurs, return thirty characters and reread. Avoid haste; if one rushes to complete the count, it becomes a loss of merit and misleads many. Modulate the voice in recitation so that spirit and *hun* harmonize and flow smoothly, ensuring the incense’s fragrance never fades in the chamber.\n\nTo knock the teeth: bring the upper and lower central teeth together in pairs, making them resound. Internally, this gathers the spirit; externally, it reaches the heavens. The *Declarations of the Perfected* states: \"Knock the teeth to gather the spirit; swallow the saliva to harmonize the Real.\"\n\nNext, visualize bowing to the thirty-two heavens, imagining the Heavenly Emperor with each bow. Begin at the northeast, proceed eastward in a leftward circuit, and conclude at the northwest. Close the eyes and meditate, sitting amidst clouds of cyan, yellow, and white *qi*. The Mysterious *qi* is cyan, the Primordial *qi* is yellow, and the Initial *qi* is white. Within and without, all is misty and obscure. The Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Lion, and White Crane array themselves to left and right. Sun and moon shine brightly, illuminating the chamber. A circular radiance appears above the head, its light suffusing the ten directions—all vividly clear. The Azure Dragon to the left, White Tiger to the right, Vermilion Bird before, Dark Warrior behind; lions in two rows on either side, eight in each row, seated facing one another; white cranes likewise. The sun at the left of the forehead, the moon at the right. The chamber is filled with light, a circular radiance above the head; nine colors intermingle—cyan, red, yellow, white, black, green, crimson, purple, and deep blue—illuminating the ten directions. Visualize all with perfect clarity.\n\nThe secret incantation: \"Secret\" means the mouth moves but no sound is made.\n*Tanluo yuluo, fuwu sutuo.\nTaichong taiji, yinyang baohe.\nChu you ru wu, chusheng ru si.\nGuishen moce, bianhua ziru.\nYuanshi hunqi, xuan zhong you xuan.\nShang gan you ding, xia dong taiyuan.\nSong zhi yi bian, chen’e zi quan.\nLian hun yu po, zhenyang zi quan.\nZhaijie lishong, wan guo fei xian.\nWushang mizhou, wanshen mianmian.\nXin zhong xin zhou, chongfu xuanchuan.*",
      "overlap_context": "the images are within them.\" This is why one becomes a Perfected One of the Nine Palaces.\n\nOn one’s natal day, chant this scripture to purify and rectify the hun-soul and spirit, preserve the myriad *qi* for eternity, avoid suffering and affliction, and radiate light from the body. The Three Realms provide attendants, the Five Emperors oversee reception, the myriad spirits pay homage, one’s name is inscribed in heaven, merit is complete and virtue perfected, and one ascends to the Upper Clarity.",

      "translated_text": "Guanfuzi Xiao Yingsou studies *The Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial’s Boundless Salvation of Beings, Upper Chapter*. The August Personage says: This is the title bestowed by the Dao Lord.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* states: Jade tablets and numinous chapters are divided into the Three Caverns—Cavern of Perfection, Cavern of Mystery, and Cavern of Divinity. Taken together, they form the One Vehicle. This scripture belongs to the Cavern of Mystery and stands as the crown of all scriptures. Thus, the Most High Dao Lord prefaced it, entitling it *The Most High Cavern of Mystery, Numinous Treasure*. Yet here it is directly titled *The Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial’s Boundless Salvation of Beings, Upper Chapter*, to clarify that it was spoken by the Heavenly Worthy of the Primordial Void. As scripture, it bears this name; as elixir, it is the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir.\n\n*Primordial Cavern of Mystery, Numinous Treasure Fundamental Chapter*—this is the inner title given by the August Personage. *Primordial* means first, born before Heaven. *Beginning* means congealing, where the primordial qi first coalesces. *Cavern* means penetrating, boundless in reach. *Mystery* means emptiness, profound and void. Thus, the primordial qi first congeals to form the jade script within the empty mystery, illuminating the four directions. Emptiness becomes numinous, and concealment becomes treasure.\n\nIt is also said: The beginning gives rise to the One, and the One is Heaven. Heaven emerges from the beginning, so the beginning is also primordial. When all converges in the primordial, at the time of primordial generation, there is no Heaven, no Earth, no spirits, no ghosts—only the vast, chaotic expanse, undifferentiated and indistinct. Then the primordial congeals to form the jade script. Jade is the essence of spontaneity; its essence radiates light to form Heaven and Earth, giving rise to the sun, moon, and stars. The Primordial Venerable Deity is so named to reveal its numinosity. The generation of Heaven, Earth, sun, moon, and stars serves to nurture the myriad beings. That Heaven, Earth, and the myriad beings later receive names demonstrates the creative transformation of the Primordial Beginning. The name *Primordial Beginning* is given to show people that the end and the beginning share the same destination.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* states: *Primordial Beginning* refers to the primordial ancestral qi of the spontaneous Void, penetrating and mysterious. *Penetrating* means pervading all; *mysterious* means wondrously inexhaustible. *Numinous Treasure* is another name for the Golden Elixir. *Fundamental* means root; *chapter* means text. It signifies that the primordial ancestral qi of the spontaneous Void, pervading all and wondrously inexhaustible, serves as the root of the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir, unfolding as text to reveal its traces.\n\n*Upper Chapter, Wondrous Beginning, Ten Cycles of Salvation*—In the era of Dragon Han, the jade script first emerged, the sun and moon first shone, and Heaven and Earth were divided. The host of sages took their places, and the Primordial Beginning expounded the Dharma to save beings, reciting the scripture ten times, circling the ten directions, and delivering countless beings. The Primordial Beginning thus composed ten divisions of wondrous scriptures, inscribed with purple brush on the Azure Forest of Empty Green. Revered by all sages as the ancestral scripture, it is called *Upper Chapter, Wondrous Beginning*.\n\n*Hundred Demons Conceal the Rhyme, Separation and Union Spontaneous*—These four lines summarize the essential purport of the entire scripture.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* states: *Upper Chapter, Wondrous Beginning* refers to the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir as the crown of the supreme wondrous Dao. *Ten Cycles of Salvation* signifies the ten months’ work of elixir refinement, delivering one to immortality—this is the practice of ten months’ seclusion. *Hundred Demons Conceal the Rhyme* is like the various names of the elixir; *Separation and Union Spontaneous* resembles the alternation of metal and wood, which though distinct can merge, or water and fire, which though opposing achieve harmony—all spontaneously completing the transformation.\n\n*Chaotic Red Script, Supreme True of the Non-None*—*Chaotic* is the name of primordial chaos; *cavern* refers to the qi of cavernous yang; *red script* is the vermilion true script. At the dawn of chaos, before Heaven and Earth, it coagulated above the empty cavern, condensing within the Great None. The *none* of the Great None is itself non-existent; since it is non-existent, it is called the *Non-None*, hence the *Supreme True of the Non-None*.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* states: *Chaotic Red Script* is the root-source of the myriad transformations and the true nature of all beings. In the Dao, it is the ancestor of the One Qi; in humans, it is the origin of the myriad spirits. Before Heaven, Earth, and the myriad beings, none know its beginning, hence *Primordial Beginning*; in forming Heaven, Earth, and the myriad beings, none know its numinous wonder, hence *Numinous Treasure*; in governing Heaven, Earth, and the myriad beings, none know its vastness, hence *Virtue/Power*; in guiding people to return to the root and practice, it is called *Wondrous Scripture*; in gathering people to revert to the origin and cultivate, it is called *Returned Elixir*. It unfolds into the Three Vehicles, establishes the Three Teachings, and gives rise to boundless Dharma gates—all its transformations.\n\nTang Emperor Minghuang’s *Eulogy of the Primordial* says:\nGreat indeed is the Supreme Dao!\nPrimordial is spontaneity,\nEnding and beginning kalpas,\nBefore Earth, before Heaven,\nEnveloping light in silence,\nEternally enduring.\nIn the East, it instructed Confucius;\nIn the West, it transformed the Golden Immortal.\nA hundred kings took it as model,\nMyriad sages transmitted it.\nAncestor of the Great Teaching,\nMysterious beyond mystery.\n\nThus, the *Dao De Jing* says: There is a thing chaotically formed, born before Heaven and Earth. I know not its name, so I style it the *Dao*. The *Scripture of Western Ascent* says: The Void gives rise to spontaneity, and spontaneity gives rise to the Dao. The Dao is formless and bodiless—it is the primordial One Qi. Yet in generating the myriad beings, it is truly the root of Heaven and Earth’s creative transformation. Those who refine the Golden Elixir emulate this transformation, using the qi of the spontaneous Void—primordial, pure, true, and unified—called the *Empty Qi Golden Embryo*, to generate the Golden Mother and establish the foundation of the elixir.\n\nThis pure, true, unified qi, before the union of father and mother, was one body with chaos. The *Dao De Jing* says: The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth—this is it. In scripture, it is thus called *chaotic*. At the moment of the parents’ union, this qi suddenly attaches, forcibly named *spirit*, called *yang essence*, likened to silver ore. This is the primordial spirit, concealed within the Palace of Earth.",

      "translated_text": "Between the two kidneys—this is called *nature*, our original face. Before birth, it is termed *yin metal*; after birth, *yang lead*, the mother of the five metals. There is nothing in Heaven and Earth or the ten thousand transformations that does not rely on this qi for its establishment. The *Dao De Jing* says: \"The named is the mother of the myriad beings\"—this is it.\n\nMaster Zhenyi Peng’s preface to the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Directly pointing to the numinous root of Heaven and Earth, it is taken as the ancestor of the medicine; clearly revealing the sagely mother of yin and yang, it is used as the foundation of the elixir\"—this is it. As the wondrously transforming qi of daily use returns to the Central Palace to become the *Elixir Mother*, it is said: \"The Dao gives birth to the One,\" resembling the *Ancestral Qi*, coalescing into the *Jade Letter*. In scripture, it is called *Red Script*—this is *metal and fire*. *Metal* is the spontaneous qi of the primordial, the *Golden Embryo*; *fire* is the yang qi of daily arising. Both emerge from a single source, forming substance and function.\n\nThis is the supreme, unsurpassable, most true and wondrous Dao, hence called the *Peerless True*. From the primordial beginning of the ancestral kalpa, the myriad heavens were generated. *Ancestral* means *beginning*. The mysterious primordial qi at the dawn of the ancestral kalpa suddenly gave rise to the five billion heavens. Now, Heaven and Earth undergo one completion and one destruction—this is called a *kalpa*. The *beginning kalpa* refers to the world’s initial arising, before any completion or destruction.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: Zhou Lianhan said: \"Great indeed is Qian’s origin! The myriad beings rely on it for their beginning—it is the source of sincerity. As the Qian Dao transforms and changes, each attains its nature and destiny, and sincerity is thereby established.\" Thus, the *primordial ancestral kalpa* is the greatness of Qian’s origin, on which the myriad beings rely for their beginning—this is the source of the true. The generation of the myriad heavens is the Qian Dao’s transformation and change, wherein each attains its nature and destiny—then the true is established.\n\nTracing the origin of the myriad heavens’ generation: from the One Qi, the Three Realms are established; from the Three Realms, the Nine Heavens arise. Each of the Three Realms and Nine Heavens further generates three heavens below, totaling thirty-six heavens. Below these are the four kinds of mortal heavens, then the division into the Three Realms and twenty-eight heavens, followed by the eight Brahma heavens, extending to the generation of five billion heavens and eight spherical worlds. Human birth follows a similar pattern: the parents’ essence and blood envelop one’s inherent nature and destiny to form them.\n\nWhen a person first takes shape in the mother’s womb, essence and blood have not yet congealed, drifting and shifting like pearls or dew. After congealing, the form develops three segments: the head and four limbs. In males, the left kidney forms first, then the right *Gate of Destiny*; in females, the reverse. The original nature continues the lineage between the two kidneys, called the *Palace of Earth*, whence the wondrously transforming qi of daily use arises. Next, the divine water of the two pupils forms above, extending to the generation of the five viscera and six bowels. Relying on the mother’s breath, when qi is sufficient, birth occurs.\n\nThus, Laozi said: \"Heaven and Earth unite their essences, and yin and yang distribute transformation. In the first month, it is the *embryo sac*, as essence and blood congeal; in the second, the *fetus*, as form begins to take shape; in the third, the yang spirit becomes the *three hun*, moving to generate life; in the fourth, the yin numen becomes the *seven po*, stillness stabilizing form; in the fifth, the five phases divide into the five viscera, to settle the spirit; in the sixth, the six pitch-standards determine the six bowels, to aid the numinous; in the seventh, the seven essences open the seven orifices, to communicate light; in the eighth, the eight luminous spirits are complete, descending true numen; in the ninth, palaces are arrayed, to secure essence; in the tenth, qi is sufficient, and the myriad images are complete.\"\n\nThough humans share the same creative transformation as Heaven and Earth, they do not attain equal longevity—why? It is because they cannot return to their root. The *root* is the *Ancestral Qi*. Rooted in the One Heart, one concentrates on the One Qi to attain softness, cultivates the One Heart to accomplish the Dao. If one can penetrate and unite them, then \"closing the door to build the cart\" and \"exiting the gate to match the tracks\" are one—returning to the root and restoring the origin, with form and spirit both wondrous.\n\nThus, Master Fu’s eulogy for Śākyamuni says: \"For what reason did he spend six years on Snow Mountain? Only to harmonize qi and spirit. In one hundred moments making one breath, one then knows the Great Dao is the complete body.\" To penetrate and unite them—this eulogy is it. Therefore, the Daoist crown, Confucian shoes, and Buddhist kasaya are not worn in vain.\n\nThe *Three Luminaries* revealed are called the *Heavenly Root*. As the Two Modes divide form and the Three Lights hang their radiance, all receive the *Beginning Qi*—hence it is the *Heavenly Root*. The *Inner Meaning* states: The scripture says, \"The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two give birth to the Three, and the Three give birth to the myriad beings.\" Thus, the *Scripture of the Spontaneous Origin of the Void and Natural* says: \"Only when the Dao attains the Three is it complete.\" Hence it is said: \"The Three unite to form virtue\"; if the Dao does not fill the Three, nothing is accomplished.\n\nThe *Appended Sayings* states: \"The *Yi* has the Supreme Ultimate, which gives birth to the Two Modes.\" From the One Qi, clear and turbid divide—this is the Three. The *Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Generation of the Spirit* says: \"Three qi combine to generate nine qi. The Three Qi are the ancestors of Heaven and Earth; the Nine Qi are the roots of the myriad beings. From the Three completing the Nine, they become the roots of beings—this is called 'the Three give birth to the myriad beings.' The Three unite to form virtue: in the Dao, they are the Three Qi; in beings, the Three Powers; in Heaven, the Three Lights; in humans, the Three Origins. All are the *Ancestral Qi* of the primordial beginning, the root of the myriad beings.\" Hence it is said: \"The Three Luminaries revealed are the Heavenly Root.\"\n\nWith regard to the internal, borrowing metaphorical images, they are called *lead, mercury, and cinnabar*. Directly pointing to the thing itself, they are one’s inherent nature and the two qi of daily wondrous transformation—yin and yang. Though one may know the inherent nature, without understanding the function of the two realms, one still cannot avoid decline and decay.\n\nMaster Zhongli said: \"The interpenetration of being and non-being is called the root of the elixir; the correspondence of concealment and revelation is *water and metal*...\"",

      "translated_text": "Do not call this body a mere vessel of the Dao, for solitary cultivation of one thing is but solitary yin.\n\nAmong the myriad beings between Heaven and Earth, first there is the root, and only then the stem. Take the fruit with its kernel as the root; when planted in soil, yin and yang contend and fuse, the husk splits, the sprout emerges, and roots take hold—thus it grows lush, blossoms, bears fruit, and its life knows no end. Without roots and trunk, to seek the root’s enduring presence is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the Heavenly Worthy first pointed to *Ancestral Qi* as the root of the Dao, then clarified the Three Realms as the Dao’s stem. From this, root descends and branches flow, giving rise to the myriad beings. If one can constantly be desireless to observe its wonders, turning inward to embody sincerity, then one encompasses Heaven and Earth, and creation arises from the self.\n\nThe scripture says: \"The cosmos lies within the hand, the myriad transformations arise from the body.\" This is no reckless claim.\n\nAbove, there is no ancestor beyond the Dao; the Dao alone is the body. The wondrous root forms of itself, without prior ancestor, all-encompassing and boundless—this is the Dao-body. The Dao takes emptiness and nothingness as its宗, spontaneity as its root, and the Dao as its body.\n\nYet these three are all without form or appearance. Tracing their principle, they are true emptiness. Within the true lies essence, inherently without name. When the sages established teachings, they could not be without a宗, so they raised emptiness and nothingness as the Dao’s ancestor. In truth, the three bodies converge in the one real, utterly without form, yet able to penetrate all wonders.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* says: \"Though the categories of Heaven, Earth, and beings differ, they share no separate root; all are transformed by the Dao alone.\"\n\nThus the *Scripture of Laozi’s Ascent to the West* says: \"The Dao is the *primordial qi* of emptiness and nothingness, the undifferentiated spontaneity, without exterior or interior, without high or low. Heaven and Earth are born from it, and the myriad beings take shape through it.\"\n\nIt also says: \"All beings with form are born from the Dao.\"\n\nThe *Scripture of Ascent to the West* says: \"Heaven, Earth, and beings all originate from the Dao’s source, emerging together from the primordial beginning of Great Simplicity and emptiness.\" Thus the Golden Elixir of Returning Cinnabar shares the same essence.\n\nThe Five Scripts unfold and establish the numinous. Without script, there is no radiance; without script, no illumination; without script, no establishment; without script, no completion; without script, no deliverance; without script, no life. The Five True Scripts unfold their forms, universally planting Heaven and Earth and arranging the numinous spirits. Without the unfolding of the True Scripts, the sun and moon would not shine, the stars would not gleam, Qian and Kun would not stand, the world would not be at peace, the hidden souls would not be delivered, and the withered bones would not live.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* says: \"Within the elixir, the Five Scripts are the Five Agents, transformed from the *primordial qi* of the Prior Heaven. Timed and stored within the chamber as *lead-water*, their wondrous function stirs and gives rise to *cinnabar-wood*. When yang reaches its extreme and generates yin, it is called *mercury*—fire. When yin returns to the yang chamber, it becomes *silver*—metal. Within the Central Palace, it is perfected as the elixir—earth. Distributed through the Five Phases, it scatters and transforms the myriad spirits, all through the wondrous function of the one *qi*, the root and宗 of the myriad Dao.\"\n\nThus it is said: \"The Five Scripts unfold and establish the numinous.\" Without this, the eyes do not see, the heart is not bright, the body does not stand, the elixir does not form, the living are not delivered, and the dead do not live.\n\nThis is the Great Brahma, the Heaven within Heaven.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* says: \"These two lines summarize the preceding text, referring to the profound within the profound of the Great Dao. Regarding the elixir, the Way of the Golden Elixir is scattered throughout the scriptures—some take clarity and stillness as their宗, some emptiness and nothingness, some speak of yin and yang, some of creation and transformation, some of dragon and tiger, lead and mercury, some of spirit and *qi*, water and fire. This scripture encompasses all forms and is most complete, analyzing the utmost principle without omission. Thus it is called the Great Brahma, the Heaven within Heaven.\"\n\nThose who attain it may plumb the root and seek the source, fathom the divine and know transformation, repose in the realm of the mysterious and empty, and wander freely in the field of the numinous treasure. In the four dignified postures, there is nothing that is not the practice of the Dao.\n\nThe lush and verdant Terrace of Great Luo, the Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital.\n\n\"Lush\" means flourishing; \"Luo\" is the Great Luo Heaven. Above the Great Luo Heaven lies the Jade Capital Mountain, upon which stands the Seven Treasures Mystic Terrace within the Seven Treasures City. Within it is the Jade Clarity Palace, where the Highest Jade Emperor resides.\n\nAbove the Jade Clarity is a nine-tiered terrace, reaching the utmost heights, merging with the Great Nothingness. Thus it shines upon the lush Great Luo, the serene nine-tiered terrace. \"Great Nothingness\" is the Great Luo; as the mountain is of jade, it is called the Jade Mountain. Atop the mountain is a capital, hence the Upper Capital, also called the Jade Capital or Jade Clarity, all named for jade. This is collectively known as the Mystic Capital Jade Capital.\n\nAbove, it reaches the utmost, the Great Luo Jade Clarity. The realm of the Great Luo Jade Clarity is of boundless height and distance, with nothing above it, able to encompass all heavens—thus it is called the Great Luo. Above it is no dust, vast and open, the realm of the effortless Dao.\n\nVast and immeasurable, as if vanished, as if present. \"Vast\" means distant and far-reaching. \"Eon\" is like a giant stone, four hundred *li* square, or like an empty city, four hundred *li* square, equal in height and breadth, filled with mustard seeds. Every hundred years, a heavenly being takes one mustard seed. When the stone is worn away by a silk robe and the mustard seeds are exhausted, this is called one eon. Thus the *Scripture of Pacing the Void* says: \"Gazing up at the Terrace of Eons\"—this is what it means.\n\nThe Seven Treasures Terrace is not seen by earthly immortals, much less by ordinary people. Those who see it say it exists; those who do not say it is gone—thus it is \"as if vanished, as if present.\" This is not a fixed appearance. Though it may have form, it has no substance, the true essence of creation, spontaneous and self-so.",

      "translated_text": "The *Inner Meaning* states: \"The Terrace of Lush Canopy\" refers to the space between the brain. \"The Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital\" is the Mud-Pill Palace. \"The Supreme, Unsurpassed Great Luo Jade Clarity\" is the Great Mystery above the Mud-Pill. The secret inner mechanism is called the \"soaring of sun and moon,\" the essential method of spirit-transformation and womb-escape. The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: \"Soaring above sun and moon, I ascend the Dao—only then does one behold the Jade Clarity’s Void-and-Aged One.\" Vast and measureless as eons, \"as if vanished, as if present\"—this is the nature, not something measurable by images, numbers, directions, or colors, nor is it a dim obscurity utterly devoid of substance. It is akin to the Great Void, elusive and profound, thus \"vast and measureless as eons,\" beyond all scrutiny. \"As if vanished, as if present\"—this is the elusive and profound.\n\nThe scripture says: \"Gazing, it cannot be seen; listening, it cannot be heard; using, it cannot be exhausted.\" Master Zhang the Perfected says: \"Gazing, its form cannot be seen; yet when called, it responds. Do not say this sound is like an echo in a valley—for if there were no valley, what sound would there be?\"\n\nThe Three Flowers depart and transform, revealing the wondrous court of the Great Existence. The Three Flowers are the Golden Flower, Jade Flower, and Ninefold Flower—three palaces. \"Depart and transform\" means these three palaces are the detached halls of the Jade Clarity’s realm. \"Great Existence\" refers to the Supreme Great Existence. The Jade Clarity Palace is where the Heavenly Worthy presides, hence it is called the wondrous court.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The Mud-Pill’s brain-space is called the Detached Palace, also the Noon Position, also the Qian Palace. The number three corresponds to the south. \"Flower\" refers to the flower canopy, also called the round canopy—the cavity where all passages converge, where the myriad spirits pay homage. This is the Mud-Pill’s brain-space. \"Detached\" is the south’s Noon Position. \"Transform\" means change: when yang *qi* reaches *si* (the sixth earthly branch), it reaches its peak and transforms to generate yin, which begins at *wu* (the seventh branch). The *Scripture of Dragon and Tiger* says: \"The yang line ends at *si*; true yin arises, emanating from *li* (fire) at *wu*.\"\n\n\"Great Existence\" is explained in the *Book of Changes*: \"Fire in the sky is Great Existence.\" *Li* and *wu* are fire; the Qian Palace is heaven. \"Wondrous\" is the mysterious; \"court\" is the center. The mysterious is the mysterious *qi*—the primordial *qi* of the Mysterious Origin. The center is the brain’s center. \"Center\" refers to the middle of the four directions; applied to inner matters, it means the brain’s center, heart’s center, or spleen’s center. When mysterious *qi* resides in the brain’s center, true yin is born at *li* and *wu*. In terms of hexagrams, the yielding occupies the honored position, and all yang lines respond to it. This symbolizes the August Heavenly Worthy, serene atop the Jade Clarity, while heaven, earth, and the myriad things naturally transform and take shape below.\n\nThe Golden Gates and Jade Chambers stand in solemn array, pure and luminous. The gates of gold gleam resplendently, encircling the chambers of white jade—pristine, majestic, and radiant. The *Inner Meaning* states: The Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery’s Golden Flower says: \"Earth’s essence generates stone; stone’s yin essence becomes jade, and its yang essence becomes gold.\" Thus the *Scripture of Gold* says: \"Within a single stone, yin and yang divide to become gold and jade—this is what is meant by 'one yin, one yang, that is the Dao.'\"\n\nThe Golden Gates are the sun; the Jade Chambers are the moon. \"Solemn array\" refers to the constellations; \"pure and luminous\" describes the sun, moon, and stars—clear, bright, and resplendent. The sun and moon are the essence of yin and yang, the substance of *kan* and *li*, the function of *qian* and *kun*. Within the sun is the image of a crow; within *li* (fire) is the yin moon, and within it is the image of a rabbit. Within *kan* (water) is yang, but yang cannot shine without yin, just as its spirit cannot glow without yang. Its corporeal soul arranges the constellations to encircle the heavens as the warp, while the sun, moon, and five planets move through their degrees as the weft, shifting cold and heat to transform the myriad things. In the elixir path, this becomes the mechanism of transmutation, the wondrous function of talismanic fire. Thus the *Triplex Unity* cites the *Book of Changes*: \"Heaven and earth establish their positions, and the *Changes* move within them.\"\n\n\"Heaven and earth\" are *qian* and *kun*. \"Establish their positions\" means arranging yin and yang in proper alignment. The *Changes* refer to *kan* and *li*. *Kan* and *li* are the two functions of *qian* and *kun*. These two functions, without fixed lines, circulate through the six voids. Their coming and going are unfixed; their rising and falling have no constancy. It also says: \"*Kan* is *wu*’s lunar essence; *li* is *ji*’s solar radiance. Sun and moon are the *Changes*, hard and soft in balance.\" The *Changes* are images. No image is more luminous than the suspended sun and moon. To fathom the spirit is to know transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives.\n\nIt also says: \"Once chaos is conjoined, connect the roots, establish the foundation, cultivate and nourish the calyx, and concentrate the spirit to form the body.\" Master True Unity annotates: \"Heaven and earth establish their positions\" refers to the *ji-ji* (already-accomplished) cauldron, which symbolizes *qian* and *kun*. The *Changes* move within it—yin and yang, *li* and *kan*, operate within it. Within, the Golden Mother is settled; without, water and fire are applied. Through movement and stillness, circulation through the six voids, they become the source of transformation and the foundation of mutual generation.\n\n\"*Kan* is *wu*’s lunar essence.\" The moon is yin; *wu* is yang—thus it is yang within yin, symbolizing the golden tiger within water. \"*Li* is *ji*’s solar radiance.\" The sun is yang; *ji* is yin—thus it is yin within yang, symbolizing the mercurial dragon within fire. Therefore, the *Changes* are the image of the medicine. They are formed by the union of sun and moon. The great elixir of golden fluid is created by combining the essence-*qi* of the sun and moon’s yin and yang. Thus the *qi* of yin and yang emerges and withdraws, expands and contracts, circulating day and night in an endless cycle. Talismanic fire advances and retreats; yin comes and yang goes, yang hides and yin acts.\n\n\"Chaos\" is the spirit-chamber. The yin-yang dragon and tiger within chaos receive the transformative *qi* of intercourse, establishing the root, nurturing the calyx, and ultimately concentrating the spirit to form the body. Thus, within the cauldron-chamber, another heaven and earth, another sun and moon, operate wondrously.",
      "overlap_context": "e and the mustard seeds are exhausted, this is called one eon. Thus the *Scripture of Pacing the Void* says: \"Gazing up at the Terrace of Eons\"—this is what it means.\n\nThe Seven Treasures Terrace is not seen by earthly immortals, much less by ordinary people. Those who see it say it exists; those who do not say it is gone—thus it is \"as if vanished, as if present.\" This is not a fixed appearance. Though it may have form, it has no substance, the true essence of creation, spontaneous and self-so.",

Master Zhang the Perfected says: It is merely mercury, a single flavor circulating through all the celestial bodies. Dao Guang says: It is the barefoot fierce general traversing the twelve positions. Thus, as yang-*qi* daily flourishes, it nurtures the sacred embryo to deliver the world and attain longevity, transcending the mortal form through spiritual transformation. Through cultivation, this is attained without limit—is this not the spirit who delivers people from death, the Lord of Longevity, the Great Spirit who delivers the world, the Venerable Lord Han, the Offices of Life and Register, the Prolongers of Life and Augmenters of Destiny, the Exalted Spirits who deliver from tribulation, who restore bones, raise the dead, and deliver countless beings?\n\nThe Mysterious Master says: The Metal Mother resides on Tortoise Mountain in the West, speaking of the body of metal; it is also called Dragon Mountain, speaking of the Dao of wood.

The myriad *qi* pay homage day and night; if even a speck of worldly thought arises, the Great Circulation is lost, and *fanqi* cannot suffuse the body.

The Five Elders are: in the East, the Azure Spirit First Elder, surnamed Guan, named Kai, styled Lingwei Yang, who harmonizes the spring *qi* to birth the myriad things; in the South, the Cinnabar Spirit True Elder, surnamed Dongfu, named Jiyan, styled Chibiao Nu, who harmonizes the summer *qi* to nurture the myriad things; in the Center, the Primordial Spirit Prime Elder, surnamed Tongban, named Yuanshi, styled Hanzhu Niu, who harmonizes the earth *qi* to uphold the Nine Heavens; in the West, the Radiant Spirit August Elder, surnamed Shangjin, named Changkai, styled Yaopo Bao, who harmonizes the autumn *qi* to ripen the myriad things; and in the North, the Five Spirits Mystic Elder, surnamed Heijie, named Linghui, styled [Yinhou Ju], who harmonizes the winter *qi* to store the myriad things. All are celestial perfected spirits of nature, thus called the Primordial Five Elders. They are not those who attain perfection through later study but receive their mandates by destiny, each governing a direction. Only when great kalpas cycle anew do their positions change.\n\nMyriad chariots and ten thousand riders arrive floating through the void. The *Inner Meaning* states: The Ten Directions’ Great Spirits are the *qi* of the Dharma-body, the spirits that govern *qi*. Yin and yang intermingle and return, with myriad Dharma-images contained within—hence they \"together ride flying clouds, cinnabar chariots, and green carriages, with feathered canopies and jade wheels, drawn by a single vermilion phoenix and five-colored dark dragons.\" As for the nine-colored standards, they are the essence of yang; the ten mystic banners, the splendor of yin. The phoenixes ahead are yang, leading the song; the simurghs behind are yin, following in harmony. The lion is the king of beasts, symbolizing the heart; the crane is a spirit bird, embodying nature. Their resonant chanting and singing evoke a mind at ease and joyful.\n\nThe Five Elders leading the way represent the ancestral *qi* wondrously transforming into the Five Phases, flourishing and ascending. The hosts of immortals flanking the chariot poles represent the myriad spirits gathering around the Primordial Palace. The myriad chariots and ten thousand riders arriving through the void signify the Three Divisions and Eight Sceneries—yang souls and yin spirits, the twelve hundred forms and shadows, the twelve thousand luminous essences—all merging at once and returning to the Primordial Unity.\n\nTheir radiance pours forth, their chariots turn back. \"Pouring forth radiance\" refers to the flowing essence of jade light, mutually illuminating and resplendent. \"Turning back the chariots\" refers to the flying clouds and wheel hubs revolving around the Dharma-throne. They oversee the perfection of beings and deliver the living. The Ten Directions’ exalted sages assemble at the Emperor’s abode to supervise the hosts of perfected ones and deliver the multitudes of beings.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: \"Pouring forth radiance and turning back the chariots\" symbolize the completion of the *kan*-*li* hexagrams, the image of yin and yang in harmonious union. As yang ascends and yin follows, they converge in the cauldron chamber. Creation gathers and contracts, the two *qi* merge—this is what was previously called \"the spirits governing *qi*, yin and yang intermingling, Dharma-images all contained.\" The two *qi* are the yin and yang of *kan* and *li*. The yang line within *kan* descends to join the yin line within *li*, causing the yang light to pour downward—hence \"pouring forth radiance.\" Yin follows yang’s ascent, like a chariot bearing its load. Inner yin seeks to gather outer yang, while outer yang yearns for inner yin. Yin and yang intermingle—hence \"turning back the chariots.\" Through this, the purest essence is stirred, the hosts of yang flow unimpeded, the upright *qi* flourishes, and true spirits transform and arise—hence \"overseeing the perfection of beings and delivering the living.\"\n\nThe Prime Ministers of the Heavens and the Upper Palace of Southern Prosperity—*qi* of ministers and *qi* of chancellors, capable of establishing creation. The Prime Ministers are the divine lords of the Great Luo Heaven. The Upper Palace of Southern Prosperity is the Vermilion Numinous Palace, located within the Heaven of Crimson Clarity and Harmonious Yang.\n\nHan, the Controller of Records, and the Great Spirit of Life-Monitoring—Han the Controller is the Deity of Destiny, overseeing the records of those who receive refinement and deliverance. The Great Spirit of Life-Monitoring governs the deliverance of souls from the Nine Dark Realms.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: Inwardly, this symbolizes the *qi* of the Dharma-body’s Great Brahma, the wondrous transforming *qi* of arising and flourishing. Though the true spirit dwells within the chamber, without this *qi*, nothing could come into being.\n\nHolding records and grasping registers, they arrive together before the Emperor. The *Inner Meaning* states: Records and registers document merits and transgressions. When the deities who govern the heavens and preside over all assemble with the ritual officers before the August Heavenly Worthy of the Void, it is to assess merits, measure blessings, and universally deliver humans and gods.\n\nThis symbolizes the *qi* of wondrous transformation returning to the spirit chamber, embodying the principle of nurturing life and transformation. Before the Great Void, what was there in the boundless silence? Once the ancestral *qi* divided, yin and yang separated. At the dawn of primordial chaos, darkness was without trace. After the Three Powers were established, documents and records arose. Manifesting benevolence, they become records and registers; concealed in function, they become yin and yang. Without records and registers in the hidden and manifest realms, how could merits and transgressions be recorded? Without yin and yang in heaven and earth, how could creation be accomplished?\n\nYin and yang are the functions of the cinnabar Dao. Though their names diverge when analyzed, they cannot be fully enumerated. Briefly speaking, their dynamic interplay is called Dragon and Tiger; their medicinal forms, Mercury and Cinnabar; their transformative mechanism, *Kan* and *Li*; their ascent and descent, Water and Fire. Schools name them differently—seek them by their categories.\n\nThe preceding refers to the Central Palace’s spirit chamber, where yin and yang are the wondrous functions of the Golden Elixir. The spirit chamber is the pivot of the Golden Elixir, the Emperor’s domain where all within the Four Seas pay tribute, converging like spokes toward the hub.",

      "translated_text": "Where the spirit abides, the myriad qi respond and attach, all coalescing without exception. The spirit serves as the sovereign qi, while the spirits of the ministers dwell within the chamber—here, the myriad qi gather as one. Thus it is said: holding the records and ledgers, all arrive in unison before the Emperor.\n\nMaster Zhang the Perfected states: Those who refine the Elixir must thoroughly comprehend yin and yang and profoundly grasp the workings of creation. Only then can they pursue the two qi along the Yellow Path and unite the three natures within the Primordial Palace. They assemble the Five Agents, harmonize the Four Images, where Dragon intones and Tiger roars, husband leads and wife follows, the Jade Crucible simmers, and the Golden Furnace blazes with fire. The Mysterious Pearl takes form, and the Great One returns to truth.\n\nFrom this perspective, the essence of the Returned Elixir lies in nothing beyond yin and yang, which originate from the Dao. The Dao gives birth to the One, the One to the Two, the Two to the Three, and the Three to the myriad things. As *The Awakening to Reality* states: \"The Dao arises from emptiness and generates the One qi; from this One qi, yin and yang emerge. Yin and yang recombine to form the Three Bodies, and from these Three Bodies, the myriad things flourish.\"\n\nThe Elixir, then, is cultivated by following the patterns of creation. All other countless names and boundless wondrous meanings arise from yin and yang, like a ball rolling upon a tray—whether traversing horizontally or vertically, its true nature remains unfathomable, yet never leaves the confines of the tray.\n\nThose who fail to embody creation’s patterns or follow yin and yang, though they may possess essential and subtle teachings, practice only peripheral and minor methods. How can these compare to the Golden Elixir?\n\nYet those who cultivate the Elixir must first reform their faults and uphold precepts to guard against transgressions. Above all, they must abandon deceit, still their scheming, purify their minds, and diminish desires. If cunning and calculation stir within, the spirit becomes disordered and qi muddled; the qi and signs within the body no longer align with heaven and earth, and the medicine cannot be gathered. If external attachments to sounds, forms, and desires persist, the spirit scatters and qi dissipates; inner and outer creation fail to interact, and the Crucible cannot be formed.\n\nThose who aspire to this path yet cannot relinquish these hindrances are like one who walks backward while seeking to advance. Alas! Worldly people chase the trivial and forget the fundamental, devaluing life and treating the body with disregard.",

      "translated_text": "The heroic and the bold are enslaved by their pursuit of merit, fame, and career; the wise and the exceptional are lured by ambition, advancement, and wealth. Those with ample clothing and food are bewildered by schemes and calculations; the poor and destitute are tormented by the burdens of mere survival. Even those who stand apart from the world, delighting only in ease and comfort, mistakenly call this \"purity and non-action.\" All these miss the truth before their very eyes, forgetting Zhang Pingshu’s words: \"A man of resolve, if he cultivates the Elixir, may do so whether in the marketplace or at court.\"\n\nIf worldly people could take up this Way as their own task, setting aside distractions even for a brief moment each day, practicing diligently without retreat, they would surely see results. In all their interactions with the world, if they never forget to turn their light inward and return to reflection, the radiance of the Golden Elixir will ever shine brightly. Even if they have not yet forged it into a single whole, this is still a path of peace and joy, prolonging life and extending years, free from the turning of karma.\n\nIf one’s resolve is firm, the Dao will not fail them. As Immortal Zhongli Quan said: \"If Heaven were to betray those of Daoist heart, it would make my three disciples into lowly ghosts.\" Could an immortal speak falsely?\n\nThe Scripture says: \"Those who engage with the Dao become one with the Dao; those who engage with virtue become one with virtue; those who engage with loss become one with loss. Those who become one with the Dao, the Dao delights in obtaining them; those who become one with virtue, virtue delights in obtaining them; those who become one with loss, loss delights in obtaining them. Where trust is insufficient, there will be distrust.\"\n\nAs for the subtle mechanisms of the Dao, I dare not lightly disclose them, but I shall slightly open the path to guide those who come after. The Song of Master Ge the Immortal says:\n\n*Flowing Pearl, Flowing Pearl,*\n*You enslave my humble self.*\n*I roam the four seas, traverse ten thousand texts,*\n*Burn gold and stone to ash, boil mercury to naught.*\n*Seeking in vain, my thoughts grow dull.*\n*By the Master’s transmission, primal qi arises from emptiness,*\n*Dwelling in the dim and indistinct, abiding in the vague and fleeting.*\n*True yin and true yang, one inhalation, one exhalation.*\n*First visualize the Golden Crucible, then prepare the Jade Furnace.*\n*Stir the Fire of Li, model the Water of Kan.*\n*Jade liquid irrigates, the Grotto Chamber flows with butter.*\n*The Immortal delivers men—only the great of heart may grasp this.*\n*Hold fast to this, remember these words.*\n\nImmortal Peng says:\n*The Supreme Dao is subtle, rare, and profound;*\n*To refine the Elixir, first recognize the Great Returning Mind.*\n*The sun’s hexagram, yin paired, births true mercury;*\n*The moon’s trigram, yang odd, produces true gold.*\n*The woman conceives cinnabar, the man nurtures snow;*\n*Gui conceals fire, Bing contains Ren.*\n*At the two ends lies the lead, the ancestor of metals—*\n*Do not seek it haphazardly among the myriad things.*\n\nMaster Xu of the Heavenly Teacher says:\n*If the spirit departs, recall it swiftly;*\n*When the spirit returns to the body, qi follows of itself.*\n*Thus morning and evening, day after day,*\n*The true embryo of the Red Child naturally takes form.*\n\nThe *Song of the Original Dao* by Fuqiu Bo says:\n*The tiger lies low, the dragon too hides;*\n*The dragon hides only after the tiger submits.*\n*Simply complete the work of the River Chariot,*\n*No need for barriers or resistance.*\n*Those who seek to become flying immortals*\n*Wander in madness, unable to abide.*\n*Left and right, they find lord and minister;*\n*The Four Agents guard and protect one another.*\n*The law and image of Qian and Kun are fulfilled—*\n*Of itself, the True Person attends.*\n\nThough I have not revealed the subtle mechanisms, the essentials are already contained within these songs and poems. If one of resolve studies them, they will surely grasp the truth. This is what Heaven has bestowed.\n\n[580/3] According to the measure of those to be delivered, the heavens are strictly examined. According to the weight of merit, the heavens open the path to deliverance, strictly examining all, that none be lost.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The Way of the Golden Elixir differs from other arts. Once attained, it is attained forever; reward follows merit. Ten parts effort yield ten parts reward; if one’s work is flawed, so too is the recompense. Yet what is cultivated is most secret, without sound or scent, yet the vast and distant realm of Great Luo, the boundless and empty expanse, is connected to all, reaching all. Strictly examined and recorded, not a hair’s breadth is omitted. If one practices with diligence and unwavering perseverance, they will surely ascend beyond the world.\n\nThe above is the preface and exposition of the Jade Dawn Dao Lord.\n\nA universal proclamation to the Three Realms and the Boundless Divine Realm:\nThe Three Realms are the Realm of Desire, the Realm of Form, and the Formless Realm. The Boundless refers to the ten directions of the infinite worlds.\n\nThe winding springs of the underworld, the Northern Capital of Fengdu:\nIn the far north below lies a great sea, foul and black, its bounds unfathomable. Within it stands a mountain, a hundred and six thousand miles high, its summit piercing the azure heavens, its base descending into the windy springs—this is the Northern Capital of Fengdu Mountain. Near the water’s surface lies a great cavern, called the Heavenly Palace of Yin Shadows, thirty-six thousand miles in circumference, containing thirty-seven hells. The lord of this cavern is the Heavenly Lord of Great Yin. Above the mountain are six other caverns, each ruled by a great demon, forming the Six Bureaus under the Heavenly Lord of Great Yin, with a combined host of three hundred and sixty thousand officials.\n\nThe first cavern is the Heavenly Palace of Zhou’s Absolute Yin; the second, the Heavenly Palace of Tai’s Lethal Judgment; the third, the Heavenly Palace of Mingchen’s Enduring Offense; the fourth, the Heavenly Palace of Tianzhao’s Sinful Qi; the fifth, the Heavenly Palace of Zongling’s Seven Transgressions; the sixth, the Heavenly Palace of Gansi’s Continuous Torment. If one can hold the names of these six palaces in reverence and awe, the demon kings will vouch for them, erasing their sins, sparing them from life and death, and granting boundless blessings. This Fengdu lies in the northernmost Gui region beyond heaven and earth.\n\nThe Three Offices and Nine Bureaus:\nThe Three Offices are the Offices of Heaven, Earth, and Water. Each office has three bureaus, hence the Nine Bureaus. The Upper Primordial Office of Heaven, under the Jade Pure Realm, establishes the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, with thirty-six departments. The officials are all formed from the qi of spontaneity, governing all. The Supreme Perfected of the Jade Void, the High Sovereign Emperor, the Lords of the Heavens, the Great Saints and Divine Ones, the thousand Perfected who have attained the Dao, along with the records of the lives of men and women, and the registers of blessings and sins of the hundred clans—both those who have attained the Dao and those who have not—are all under their purview.",

Those whose merit remains unfulfilled are reborn among men.\n\nThe Central Palace governs the Five Emperors and Five Sacred Peaks, all Perfected Ones, all earth deities, and those immortals who have attained the Dao.

The details are recorded in the *Scripture of the Three Primordials’ Precepts and Commandments*.\n\nThe Twelve River Sources:\nThe Twelve River Sources are the moon, the essence of Great Yin and mother of all waters. Wells are the sources of the Celestial River and the springs of all waters. Each month, the moon completes a circuit of the heavens, and over twelve months, it passes through the Eastern Well, irrigating the Yellow Blossoms and bathing the countenances of the celestial beings. This dissolves the bonds of ancestors and parents across countless kalpas. Whenever the Three Offices conduct their reviews, if descendants have accrued great merit, the Jade Emperor immediately delivers their distant forebears, swiftly erasing their names from the ledgers of sins and extinguishing the roots of evil.\n\nThe \"roots of evil\" refer to the fundamental nature of wicked thoughts, which persist even after death and must be scoured through refinement and deliverance. They are not to be detained or forced into the company of ghosts.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: In terms of the body, the Three Fields correspond to the Three Realms. From the Mud Pill Palace above to the Bubbling Spring below lies the boundless divine homeland. The large and small intestines are the winding palaces of the springs, while below the kidneys lies the Northern Capital of Fengdu. The Three Corpses and Nine Worms are the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, and the twelve meridians are the Twelve River Sources. As described above, each of these places has its own deities. The *Yellow Court* and *Great Cavern* scriptures provide thorough explanations. However, all these spirits are post-celestial entities, disturbed by the competition of flowers and obscured by desires, sinking into turbidity and stagnation, unable to attain clarity. They are like one’s deceased ancestors, bound in the dark yin realms, unable to achieve deliverance.\n\nFor those who cultivate refinement, the myriad qi converge at the Gate of Life, and the hundred spirits guard the Door of Death. They swiftly transcend the dusty realm, awakening to non-action, avoiding entanglement and the descent into bitter destinies.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning’s Mandate ensures promotion at every moment. The Cold Pool of the Northern Capital protects and escorts the forms and souls. Demons are subdued, and merits are vouched for, delivering beings to the Southern Palace for refinement. Deceased souls undergo refinement and are transformed into immortals. Those who receive deliverance in life endure across kalpas. As kalpas turn, they share the same lifespan as heaven. They forever escape the Three Paths, Five Sufferings, and Eight Difficulties, transcending the Three Realms and roaming freely in the Supreme Clarity.\n\nThis refers to the Primordial Beginning’s descending decree, the Northern Emperor’s escort, the proclamation to restrain the dark souls, the demon kings’ guarantee of deliverance, and the Southern Palace’s refinement and rebirth. If a deceased soul had merit and virtue in life, their form and spirit temporarily perish, and their ghostly essence undergoes refinement and immortal transformation. If they lacked merit, upon encountering the assembly, they receive refinement and are reborn in the human realm. Those who cultivate to the point of scriptural mastery receive deliverance in life and endure across kalpas. Even if the roots of life and death remain unsevered, they do not lose their human form across kalpas. Once they comprehend this cause and nurture the roots of goodness to maturity, they forever escape the Three Paths, Five Sufferings, and Eight Difficulties, transcending the Three Realms and roaming freely in the Supreme Clarity.\n\nThe Three Paths are:\n1. The Gate of Sensual Desire, the path of the Upper Corpse leading to the celestial realm of servitude.\n2. The Gate of Attachment, the path of the Middle Corpse leading to the human realm of servitude.\n3. The Gate of Greed, the path of the Lower Corpse leading to the earthly realm of servitude.\n\nThese are called the Three Evils, obstructing the path to immortal study.\n\nThe Five Sufferings are:\n1. The suffering of sensory entanglements afflicting the heart, known as the Hell of Mount Tai.\n2. The suffering of emotional attachments afflicting the spirit, known as the Wind and Blade Hell.\n3. The suffering of greed afflicting the body, known as the Hell of Carrying Stones and Mountains.\n4. The suffering of floral competition afflicting the essence, known as the Hell of Filling the Sea to Make Rivers.\n5. The suffering of bodily burdens afflicting the soul, known as the Hell of Swallowing Fire, Eating Coals, and Boiling Cauldrons.\n\nThe Three Paths and Five Sufferings together constitute the Eight Difficulties, encompassing all eight kinds of hardship.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The Primordial Beginning’s Mandate is the primordial ancestral qi. This qi emerges from yin and enters yang, ascending and transforming at every moment. At the zi hour, a single yang arises in the Kun Palace, forming the hexagram *Fu* (Return), born of the ancestral qi of the one yang. Qian begins beneath the six yielding lines of Kun, transforming one line into firmness, with yang qi taking charge and gradually ascending. Thus, it is called the Primordial Beginning’s Mandate, promoting at every moment.\n\nThe Cold Pool of the Northern Capital lies beneath the five yin. It protects and escorts the forms and souls. As the one yang ascends, the yang qi rises. By the si hour, it reaches the Li Palace, where the six yin transform into pure Qian. Thus, demons are subdued, merits are vouched for, and beings are delivered to the Southern Palace for refinement. Deceased souls undergo refinement in pure yin, transforming into immortals in pure yang.\n\nThose who receive deliverance in life possess the primordial one qi, which attaches to the parents’ union at the moment of conception, giving rise to this body. Hence, it is called \"receiving deliverance in life.\" After gaining consciousness, once the passions awaken, the primordial qi is gradually lost, leading to old age and death. The wise and determined act otherwise: they restore their nature, return to their origin, master the subtleties of creation, and operate the wondrous principles of yin and yang. This is akin to yang reaching its peak at si and yin beginning to arise at wu.",

      "translated_text": "Beneath the six firm yang lines, a single yielding line transforms, and yin qi takes effect, gradually descending to gather within the Central Palace, where the divine maiden and numinous youth conjoin yin and yang in the chamber of spirit. Soaring dragons and crouching tigers unite hun and po within the womb of the mother—thus is it called \"receiving deliverance.\" \"Kalpa upon kalpa\" signifies day after day. As yang ascends and yin descends, life returns to its root, wondrous transformations endless, cycling without cease—hence \"abiding kalpa upon kalpa.\" Now yang is exhausted above yet reborn below, circulating without end, accompanying the body from beginning to end—thus \"revolving with the kalpa’s wheel, matching heaven’s years.\" Through unceasing practice and flawless fire timing, both form and spirit attain perfection, merging with the Dao in truth—thus \"forever transcending the three paths, five sufferings, and eight difficulties, ascending beyond the three realms, and roaming freely in the Shangqing.\"\n\nThe heavens of Shangqing, where the Heavenly Emperor of Jade Perfection dwells in the primal-hued radiance of pure conduct. The *Inner Meaning* states: Xue Youqi says: The Heavenly Emperor of the Shangqing heavens refers to the thirty-six Heavenly Emperors. The most exalted among them, whose Dao equals that of the Primordial Beginning and whose rank is arrayed in the Jade Purity, is called the Jade Perfection. These are the thirty-six heavens below Shangqing, distinct from the thirty-two heavens. Possessing radiance yet devoid of color, hence it is called \"pure conduct.\" Pure conduct is the Dao within the Dao, the heaven within heaven, entering and exiting without obstruction, true emptiness without hindrance.\n\nFrom the inner perspective, when the elixir is perfected, it assumes the image of pure yang qian metal. Qian employs the nine of metal, and the number four times nine is thirty-six. The Dao equals that of the Primordial Beginning—all is one qi. Ranked among the Jade Purity—wondrous unity pervades all. When metal returns to the origin of nature, one attains radiance without color. At this stage of returning the elixir, all yin is exhausted, the yang body is wholly complete, and the heart-mind shines with clarity, ascending into the mysterious and entering the wondrous, like the limpid azure of autumn skies or the still depths of a cold pool. The slightest deviation would blind the eye—how then could one attain the colorless radiance of pure conduct?\n\nThe Heavenly Emperor of Taihuang Huangzeng Heaven: Yulan Yuming.

      "translated_text": "The Heavenly Emperor of Longbian Fandu Heaven, Yunshang Xuanxuan: Xiangling Miaoguang. The correct intonation: \"Numinous Radiance, Wondrous Light—Heavenly Qi of Red, linked to the Bond Mansion.\"\nThe Heavenly Emperor of Taiji Pingyu Jiayi Heaven, Daze Famen: Yongxuan Jiusheng. The correct intonation: \"Eternal Mystery, Ninefold Life—Heavenly Qi of Blue-Green, linked to the Straddling Mansion.\"\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: These jade names and jade intonations of the various heavens are all inscribed in azure script upon red crystal jade and concealed within the Supreme Clarity Palace. Those who hold this scripture may not request to read or recite them.\n\nAmong the thirty-two heavens, the lifespans of their inhabitants are fixed by number. For instance, the people of Huangzeng Heaven live nine million years, and from this point upward, each heaven’s lifespan doubles in succession. Thus, the people of Taiming Yuwan Heaven live eighteen million years. Doubling again, the people of Hetong Heaven live thirty-six million years. Continuing this doubling, the people of Xiule Jin Shang Heaven live 1,207,795,712 million years.\n\nThese twenty-eight heavens constitute the Three Realms: the Realm of Desire, the Realm of Form, and the Formless Realm. The Realm of Desire is the lower realm. It comprises six heavens, from Huangzeng to the Seven Luminaries Heaven. The inhabitants of these heavens possess form and desire, clinging to sensory attachments. In the first two heavens, desire is expressed through bodily union; in the next two, through hand-holding; in the fifth heaven, through speech; and in the sixth, through gaze. As they engage in carnal desire, procreating through sexual union, and giving birth to offspring, this is called the Realm of Desire. When one sense-root is purified, one ascends to the next heaven; when all six sense-roots are purified, one enters the Realm of Form.\n\nThe Realm of Form is the middle realm. It comprises eighteen heavens, from Yueheng Heaven to Tanshi Heaven. The inhabitants of these heavens possess form but no desire, though they are subject to six colors and eighteen dusts—six coarse dusts, six fine dusts, and six subtle dusts. When one coarse dust is purified, one ascends to the next heaven; when all six coarse dusts are purified, one advances six heavens. Likewise, for the six fine dusts, purifying one fine dust allows ascent to the next heaven, and purifying all six fine dusts advances one six heavens further. For the six subtle dusts, purifying one subtle dust allows ascent to the next heaven, and purifying all six subtle dusts elevates one into the Formless Realm.\n\nThe Formless Realm is the upper realm. It comprises four heavens, from Haoting to Xiule Heaven. The *Code of Supreme Perfection* states: Within the Formless Realm, the perfected are without emotion, do not engage in sexual union, and their people are born through transformation. They subsist solely on fragrant qi, free from the afflictions of form and substance. Thus, with both form and desire extinguished, one cultivates to reach the first heaven, retaining only consciousness to merge with qi, contemplating qi and the Dao, and upon attainment, ascending to the next heaven. If consciousness still remains, one must relinquish it to attain non-action and ascend further. When all past causes are forgotten, consciousness abides in this heaven. Here, one does not entirely forget, so when action is required, there is response; when non-action is called for, there is emptiness. If one clings to either emptiness or existence, one loses the responsiveness within the true. For within emptiness lies the true, and within the true lies responsiveness—all phenomena arise from emptiness. The myriad dharmas reside in the mind, yet lack form or appearance. Guiding practitioners to contemplate the mind as neither existent nor non-existent, one ascends further. As the contemplation of qi becomes increasingly subtle, all habitual tendencies are forgotten, and one merges with spontaneity, ascending to the heaven of the Seed People.\n\nThe *Code of Supreme Perfection* states: Within the Formless Realm, the bodies of its inhabitants are wondrous and subtle, devoid of form or color. Some may be hundreds of feet tall, yet remain invisible to ordinary beings—only the perfected can perceive them. As they are without visible form, this is called the Formless Realm. However, the people of the Three Realms have not severed the root of birth and death, and the qi of yin and yang still lingers, binding them to numerical fate. Their lifespans are finite; they may ascend to higher realms or descend to the human world, their rebirth determined by the measure of their merit, endlessly revolving. Only those who attain the Dao transcend this cycle, reaching the ever-harmonious Pingyu Heaven—the Four Seed-People Heavens, where lifespans also double in succession.\n\nOne account states: The people of these four heavens exist beyond the dual qi, unbound by limits of years or lifespan, abiding in joy and purity. Thus, the *Sutra of the Fundamental Limit* says: \"When habitual tendencies are exhausted, one transcends the station of the Seed People.\" Here, *knots* refer to afflictions, and *habits* to the fruits of study.\n\nThe *Code of Supreme Perfection* states: Ascending through the four heavens, one merges with the realm of the Dao, rising and falling with the qi, untouched by calamity. The qi of the thirty-two heavens and their corresponding stellar lodges are recorded in the *Scripture of Cavernous Spirit*. The lifespans of their inhabitants and the purification of sense-roots and dusts are found in the *Scripture of the Dragon’s Ascent*. Other details appear in the commentaries of Li Shaowei and Cheng Xuanying.\n\nNumbers begin with the primordial qi: the Dao generates the One, and the Supreme Ultimate generates the Two Modes. Once bound to number, there must be an end—this is why escape from birth and death is so difficult. The lifespans of heavenly beings can be calculated because they are bound to number, and thus cannot avoid the cycles of rebirth and descent. Hence, Master Fu said: \"Though one endures for a hundred thousand kalpas, one ultimately falls into emptiness and annihilation.\" The Buddhists refer to the ten kinds of immortals as such. These are the lesser vehicles of conditioned action, akin to the Pratyekabuddhas and Śrāvakas, for they have not yet attained the purity of non-action. But those who refine the Golden Elixir merge with emptiness and unite with the formless; both form and spirit become wondrous, transcending the bounds of qi and number. How could birth, death, lifespan, or form confine them?\n\nXue Youqi said: The thirty-two heavens of the four directions refer to the Four Brahma Heavens. The Heavenly Emperors are supremely exalted, their forms distinct yet ephemeral, like empty space. They move without obstruction, unobstructed by phenomena.\n\nI, Jing, note that the scriptures say: In the primordial kalpa of the Original Beginning, all heavens were transformed from the primordial qi.

      "translated_text": "Yet the secret talismanic names of the heavens serve as contracts to deliver souls from suffering, while the return of primordial qi to its origin to form the Elixir can liberate the mortal frame. Though the methods differ, the Dao is the same; though the merits vary, the principle is one.\n\nThe foregoing main text was spoken by the Most High Lord of the Original Beginning.\n\nThe thirty-two heavens, thirty-two emperors, the hidden names and secret appellations of the heavens, the empty void within the heavens, the spontaneous numinous scriptures—these are the hidden melodies of the heavens, the sounds within the heavens, the exalted ones within the heavens, the spirits within the heavens, the great demons within the heavens, the numina within the heavens. Nine harmonies and ten unions transform and ascend to the Upper Clarity. Their boundless mysteries are too profound to fathom. They spread forth the divine perfected to universally deliver heaven and humanity.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The hidden names and secret appellations of the heavens and emperors, the numinous scriptures and melodies, the divine, exalted, demonic, and numinous—these symbolize the single qi transformed into the various names of lead, silver, cinnabar, mercury, dragon, tiger, water, fire, and the Elixir. The nine harmonies and ten unions refer to the intertwining of yin and yang, mutually engendering and completing one another. Their transformation to ascend to the Upper Clarity occurs when yang reaches its zenith in *qian* and yin arises at *wu*. Creation leaves no trace; yin and yang have no beginning. Even the Jade Dawn Lord of the Dao has said: \"Their boundless mysteries are too profound to fathom.\" How much more so for those of shallow learning!\n\nGuan Ling once said: It is like the great sea, which can transform into countless dragons and fish, yet is but a single water. I and all things, flourishing and lush, exist within the great transformation—our natures are but one. From this perspective, the mechanism of creation may be glimpsed. Thus, by delving into the profound subtleties of the scriptures and the Dao, adhering to the wondrous principle of return, investigating the medicinal substances, and recognizing the foundation of the Elixir, one clarifies the workings of lead, silver, cinnabar, and mercury, and employs the functions of the sun and moon, yin and yang. The aim is to achieve long life and transcend the world, enter sagehood and ascend to perfected being, transmit the true essence, and benefit both self and others—this is what is meant by \"spreading forth the divine perfected to universally deliver heaven and humanity.\"\n\nThe foregoing main text was composed by the Jade Dawn Lord of the Dao.\n\nToday is the joyous occasion of receiving deliverance, passing through the barriers of the heavens—today refers to the day when the Original Beginning transmitted the scriptures to the Lord of the Dao. \"Pleasing the eradication of the three evils\" refers to the three paths of suffering. \"Severing the roots of the earth\" refers to hell. \"Flying past the five gates\" refers to the five sufferings. \"Named among the Supreme Mystery\" refers to the Mysterious Capital. The demon kings oversee and raise up, and the gates of heaven impose no restraints.\n\nThe *Heaven-Ascending Contract from the Wondrous Spirit Scripture* is the sixty-eighth character in the *August Writ of Humanity*, worn as a pure white sash on the body. On the day a Daoist ascends to heaven, if the Five Marchmounts do not see this contract, they will detain the soul and prevent it from ascending together. If the Jiang, He, Huai, and seas do not see this contract, they will retain the blood and fluids and prevent them from ascending together. If the Earth Bureau does not see this contract, it will detain the body and prevent ascension. If the Heaven Bureau does not see this contract, it will bar the gates of heaven and prevent advancement. The celestial gatekeepers demand the contract; upon obtaining it, one proceeds into the Purple Palace to meet the Great Lord of the Dao, after which all spirits dare not impose restraints.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: \"Today is the joyous occasion of receiving deliverance\" refers to the completion of the Elixir. When the Elixir is complete, the yang spirit gathers in the *qian* palace and directly ascends the Three Realms. The yin qi is stripped away at the *kun* gate, transcending the Five Phases—hence \"passing through the barriers of the heavens,\" \"pleasing the eradication of the three evils,\" \"severing the roots of the earth,\" \"flying past the five gates,\" and \"named among the Supreme Mystery.\" This occurs when the sacred embryo is stored in the sea of marrow, demonic trials do not disturb it, spirits and numina offer their aid, the gates of heaven suddenly open, and a body exists beyond the body—this is what is meant by \"the demon kings oversee and raise up, and the gates of heaven impose no restraints.\"\n\nThe foregoing main text was spoken by the Most High Lord of the Original Beginning.\n\nThe Eastern Dipper governs destiny, the Western Dipper records names, the Northern Dipper decrees death, the Southern Dipper bestows life, and the Central Dipper, the Great Chief, oversees all spirits.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Eastern Dipper for Long Life and Protection of Destiny* states: The Eastern Dipper has five stars.\nThe *Scripture of the Western Dipper for Great Calculation and Protection of the Body* states: The Western Dipper has four stars.\nThe *Scripture of the Northern Dipper for Extension of Life Based on One’s Original Destiny* states: The Northern Dipper has seven stars.\nThe *Scripture of the Southern Dipper for Extending Lifespan and Delivering Humanity* states: The Southern Dipper has six stars.\nThe *Scripture of the Central Dipper, the Great Chief, for Calculating and Subduing Demons* states: The Central Dipper has three stars.\n\nSome identify the Eastern, Western, Southern, and Northern Dippers with the seven lunar lodges in the four directions, taking what is now called the Northern Dipper as the Central Dipper. They cite the *Treatise on the Celestial Offices* as evidence, which states: \"The Dipper is the emperor’s chariot, moving at the center to govern the four directions and observe portents.\" Since the people of the divine continent dwell south of the pole, when viewed from the north, it is called the Northern Dipper.\n\nThe *True One Oral Instructions* states: Within the Dipper itself are five dippers: Yang Brightness is the Eastern Dipper, Yin Essence is the Western Dipper, Cinnabar Prime is the Southern Dipper, the Northern Culmen is the Northern Dipper, and the Celestial Pass is the Central Dipper. The accounts differ, so both are preserved here.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: For those who have attained deliverance and completed the Elixir, the four Dippers govern their destiny, record their names, decree death, and bestow life. The Central Dipper oversees all these matters.",

      "translated_text": "The Azure Emperor guards the hun-soul, the White Emperor attends the po-soul, the Vermilion Emperor nurtures qi, the Black Emperor circulates blood, and the Yellow Emperor presides at the center—none of the myriad spirits transcend them. The Azure Emperor’s surname is Chang, his personal name Jingming. The White Emperor’s surname is Hun, his personal name Rushou. The Vermilion Emperor’s surname is Yan, his personal name Dongdan. The Black Emperor’s surname is Xuan, his personal name Mingmeng. The Yellow Emperor’s surname is Ma, his personal name Zhonghui.\n\nThe Five Emperors in Heaven govern the flying immortals; on Earth, they are enthroned upon the Five Peaks, commanding ghosts and spirits; within humans, they govern the five viscera and their five spirits—the liver stores the hun-soul, the lungs store the po-soul, the heart stores qi, the kidneys store blood, while the spleen resides in the Central Palace, ruling over the flesh.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: For those who have attained deliverance and undergo rebirth in the womb, the Five Emperors descend with qi to transform and generate the five viscera, completing the Five Phases. For those who have completed the Elixir and attained eternal life, the Five Emperors descend with their spirits to merge with them, transcending the Five Phases.\n\nThe *Upper Clarity Comprehensive Record of the Five Emperors’ Numinous Communication* states: The Five Emperors coexist with Heaven and Earth. When yin and yang divided, they gave rise to the Five Phases. They condense the qi of spontaneity, feast in the Jasper Palace of Radiant Scenery, and wander through the Upper Clarity. They roam and observe the Eternal Yang and Primordial Origin, hastening the Five Phases to propel their movement, gathering later learners to replenish their authenticity. They oversee the registers of life and death, determining the allotted years of destiny.\n\nThe texts of the Five Emperors’ inner numinous communication arise within the Nine Mysteries, congealing the qi of Azure Yang to form jade script. They assist the Five Emperors, their divine radiance gleaming in the Purple Void, their flowing authenticity luxuriant in the Jade Clarity. The Five Phases merge and blend, illuminating the Jasper Palace with resplendent light. Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth transform and alternate, dividing their numinosity and dispersing their effulgence. They emerge from the profound and enter the subtle, penetrating the boundless. Their qi envelops Heaven and Earth, their essence pervades the Great Void. They can separate or unite, be yin or yang, ascend or descend, die or live, exist or vanish, fail or succeed. Contemplating this text exhausts the Dao of the Returned Elixir.\n\nThe Azure Heaven Demon King Bayuan Choubo, the Vermilion Heaven Demon King Futian Danshi, the White Heaven Demon King Fanshan Liumu, the Black Heaven Demon King Jianchou Langfu, and the Yellow Heaven Demon King Hengtian Danli—these are the Five Emperor Demon Kings. The first four are their titles, the middle two their personal names, and the last two their courtesy names. Some say they have different surnames and personal names, all clad in garments of dark script, wearing crowns that span the heavens, girded with swords bearing dragon-head hilts. They constantly ride feathered wheels, flying through the clouds, and often compose ballads of three thousand words to disrupt and corrupt later learners. The Most High thus recorded their songs in the *Scripture for Dispelling Demons*.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The old accounts claim that demon kings compose ballads to disrupt later learners. Upon reflection, this is not so. Demon kings do not deliberately corrupt learners but rather test them. The *Chapter on the Demon Kings of the Form Realm* says: \"My realm is difficult to cross, so I compose numinous texts, transforming and flying through the void to test your person. Many aspire to the Dao but lack steadfast faith, pursuing empty reputation without genuine practice. How could demon kings not test them? Those who pass the trial are protected and recommended to achieve perfection; those who fail and falter bear the fault of their own lack of resolve—what blame lies with the demon kings?\"\n\nThe Five Emperor Great Demons are the ancestors of the myriad spirits. These are distinct from the Five Heavenly Demon Kings, for beneath the Five Emperors there are Great Demon Kings with different names. They fly with drumming retinues, commanding ghostly legions, brandishing banners and beating drums, roaming the Great Void. They style themselves as resplendent, their merits equaling those of all heavens.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The *Hidden Book of Jade Clarity* says: The Five Emperor Demon Kings lead their officials and subordinates, born with Heaven, and constantly harass learners, unwilling for them to achieve the Dao. They even boast of equaling the sagely merits of the Heavenly Emperors. Later, during the Dragon Han era when the charts were revealed, they submitted to the transformation of the Primordial Beginning. Thus, the *Hymn of Pacing the Void* says: \"The demon kings respectfully receive their tasks, and thus can ascend to all heavens.\" From this, if learners hold fast to their original resolve, unwavering as an arrow shot forth, their Dao will flourish and their Elixir will be complete. Then the demon kings will respectfully serve them, turning to their aid—how could they dare to obstruct?\n\nHeaven delivers humanity, strictly governing the Northern Feng. The *Inner Meaning* states: The final chapter of the *Celestial Aerial Chant of the Desire Realm* says: \"Within the Northern Capital’s Winding Stream Prefecture dwell myriad ghosts, all seeking to obstruct human destiny and sever the Gate of Life.\" The perfected sing the *Cavernous Chapter* to govern the Northern Luo Feng, binding and dispatching demonic spirits, severing the blades of the Six Ghosts. The qi of all heavens surges, and my Dao daily ascends.\n\nFor the Northern Feng ghosts and spirits are charged with killing, delighting in obstructing destiny and cutting off life. When the Heavenly Worthy opens the path to deliverance, demon kings submit to transformation. Commanding and restraining the Ghost Emperor, proclaiming decrees to all passes and covenants, they issue orders to cease wanton cruelty. Thus, those who complete the Elixir are likewise protected.\n\nDivine Lords receive their mandate to universally sweep away inauspiciousness. The Eight Awes spew venom, the fierce steeds open their jaws to the four directions. The Divine Lord of the Great Luo Heaven commands the Five Emperor Great Demons to sweep away inauspiciousness and guard learners. The Eight Awesome Divine Dragons are the celestial numinous steeds of the earth. Heavenly Soldiers lead the vanguard, the Great Marshal wields the banner, hurling fire for ten thousand miles, with flowing bells in eight directions.\n\nWhen attaining deliverance and ascending, the Emperor decrees that the Great Marshal Divine Lord wield the banner to lead the way, with Heavenly Soldiers and the Fire Bell Generals to his left and right, just as in the case of the Wondrous Aid Lord Xu. Should any dare to test or obstruct the perfected, the golden axes will strike first, and the mighty Queen of the Rear will mete out punishment. Ghostly souls will be butchered, wind and fire unceasing. Thousands upon thousands will be decapitated, myriads upon myriads will have their forms severed. Demons will not dare to intrude, ghosts will have no malevolent spirits.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: When merit is complete and the Dao perfected, inner and outer align as one. The Three Officials and Northern Feng clearly inspect the ghostly camps.",

      "translated_text": "Guan Fuzi Xiao Yingsou’s study of the *Primordial Cavern Jade Chronicle*:\n\nThis chapter discusses the formation and dissolution of kalpic cycles. According to the *Mysterious Record of Mount Gui*, the Celestial Worthy congealed the qi of the Primordial Cavern to compose the *Jade Chronicle*. The *Inner Meaning* states: The *Wondrous Transformation of the Supreme Ultimate, the Divine and Numinous Chaotic Crimson Writ* declares: \"The Nine Empyreans govern the universal recitation; the Eight Emperors rule the heavens. Without the Chaotic Crimson Writ, one cannot govern the Nine Yangs and illuminate the celestial measures.\" These Nine Empyreans and Nine Heavens are all transformed by the Chaotic Crimson Writ. Thus, the Crimson Writ transforms the Chaotic, and the Chaotic transforms the Infinite. Five kalpas unfold in this transformation.\n\nThe *Chapter of the Primordial Cavern Jade Chronicle* states: \"In ancient times, when the Primordial Chaos and the Great Brahma Infinite pervaded all, the myriad heavens were undivided, and the Nine Yangs merged in darkness. Through three causes and nine revolutions, six transformations and seven returns, the Primordial Beginning first took form, and the five kalpas commenced their transformation.\" Thereupon, the Dao Lord was commanded to record the celestial origin and govern the five kalpic cycles. Thus, the *Primordial Cavern* clarifies the ancestral qi, while the *Jade Chronicle* records the celestial origin. After five kalpic cycles, all returns to the One. Therefore, when the five kalpas are complete, the Vast Heaven assumes its form.\n\nFrom this, we infer that the Chaotic Crimson Writ is called the *Wondrous Transformation of the Supreme Ultimate*. The divine and numinous are the Dao of the primordial and spontaneous. The *Primordial Cavern* and *Jade Chronicle*, in their reference to the five kalpas of transformation, expound the principle of post-celestial cultivation and realization. Thus, Li Shaowei was correct in stating that this chapter discusses the formation and dissolution of kalpic cycles.\n\nIn terms of internal alchemy, the *Primordial Cavern* is the ancestral qi of the pre-celestial void, the empty qi and golden embryo. The *Jade Chronicle* is the qi congealed into form—our original countenance, the foundation of the elixir and the root of the medicine. It shares the same principle as the Chaotic Crimson Writ, hence the saying: \"The *Primordial Cavern* clarifies the ancestral qi; the *Jade Chronicle* records the celestial origin.\" The celestial origin is the root of humanity. Through this, one cultivates and realizes the true Dao.\n\n*Longhan* and *Yankang* are names of kalpas. *Long* signifies the numinous; *Han*, the great; *Yan*, the enduring; *Kang*, the peaceful. The *Inner Meaning* states: Yan Dongyun said, \"The primordial qi first congealed into the jade script, manifest in the *Longhan* kalpa, concealed in the *Yankang*, radiant in the *Crimson Clarity*, resplendent in the *Kaihuang*, and enduring through the *Shanghuang*.\"\n\nIn the *Longhan* kalpa, the jade script first appeared, akin to the initial infusion of qi at human birth. In the *Yankang* kalpa, the jade script receded into concealment, like the dissolution of the human body. In the *Crimson Clarity* kalpa, the chart unfolded, and the jade script shone anew, akin to human rebirth. In the *Kaihuang* and *Shanghuang* kalpas, the jade script blazed forth, like humanity’s sojourn in the world. This is what is meant by \"five kalpic cycles returning to the One; when the five kalpas are complete, the Vast Heaven assumes its form.\"\n\nHeaven and Earth regard the destruction of the Three Realms as a kalpa, while the human body regards death as a kalpa. Heaven and Earth have undergone countless cycles of formation and dissolution; the human body has passed through innumerable births and deaths. Yet the qi of the void and spontaneity endures through all kalpas. When a kalpa ends and the Three Realms are destroyed, the essences of the myriad beings abide in the Great Void. When a person ages and dies, the hundred bones wither and decay, yet the single spirit and true nature remain unchanged. The *Scripture of Western Ascension* states: \"From the beginningless past, the changes endured are as numerous as grains of sand. Each movement spans kalpas, and I reflect on the toil of this suffering. This is the root of birth and death, the rise and fall through the Six Paths, the unceasing wheel of suffering. Only the attainment of the Dao brings it to an end.\"\n\nIn the boundless kalpas, within the primordial chaos...",

      "translated_text": "These two kalpas stretch vast and distant, their duration beyond reckoning, existing within the primordial chaos. Above, no color remains; below, no abyss persists.\n\nWith each kalpic cycle’s end, the Three Luminaries darken, heaven and earth merge into chaos—what color lingers above, what abyss below? The *Inner Meaning* states: The *Scripture of Yin Convergence* says, \"The Dao of heaven is established to stabilize humanity.\" The *Supreme Clarity Scripture* says: \"At the turning of the great kalpa, celestial qi is exhausted in the Supreme Yin, earthly qi reaches its limit in the Supreme Yang. When Yang is extreme, it erupts; when Yin is extreme, it stagnates. At Yang’s extremity, its essence transforms into water; at Yin’s extremity, its essence transforms into fire. First, great fire incinerates; next, great floods submerge—from the space below the Nine Heavens to the depths within the Nine Earths, not a hair’s end is spared. Then the primordial qi reunites, and this is called chaos. Chaos divides anew, just as in the initial kalpa. Such transformations, in sum, are called the separation and reunion of primordial qi.\"\n\nBefore the Dragon Han and Yan Kang eras, and before this body’s existence, who knows how many cycles of separation and reunion have occurred, returning to the empty vastness of no color and no abyss? The *Wind and Marsh* pervade the void; the *Vajra* rides the heavens. *Wind and Marsh* are the qi of the Dao. *Vajra* is the qi of essence. When the qi of the Dao is utterly yielding, it permeates the void; when the qi of essence is utterly firm, it courses through the heavens. The *Inner Meaning* says: Wind is qi without form; marsh is form without substance—this is the principle of spontaneity and voidness. Xue Youqi says: This is the qi of the Dao. The *Book of Changes* states: \"Wind above the marsh—*Zhong Fu*.\" As a hexagram, it is solid without and solid within, yet hollow at its core, symbolizing the void. The *Dao De Jing* says: \"Between heaven and earth, is it not like a bellows? Empty yet inexhaustible, the more it moves, the more it produces.\" Thus it can comply with all things, creating and transforming the myriad beings. Hence it is said: \"Persuade and yield, and the state is transformed.\" The *Mao Robe* says: *Zhong Fu* is the principle of initial generation. Is not the qi of the Dao the principle of initial generation?\n\n*Gold* endures unchanged through the ages; *firmness* remains unbroken in its integrity. This is the pure, wondrous essence. Xue says: This is the qi of essence, which accords with the Qian Dao. Qian, with its six yang lines, when inverted or reversed, remains unchanged in its nature. Possessing all four virtues, the myriad beings flourish and mature through it. The *Mao Robe* says: Qian is the pivot of creation. Is not the qi of essence the pivot of creation?\n\nThese two—what the *Dao De Jing* calls \"dimly, dimly, within it there are images; vaguely, vaguely, within it there is something; obscurely, profoundly, within it there is essence. Its essence is utterly real, within it there is sincerity\"—from ancient times to the present, their name has never faded. This is the wondrous existence of the human spirit.\n\nWhen kalpic cycles transform and the Three Realms dissolve, above the seed-people all remains serene and unmoving. Thus this qi, with its wondrous pervasion of the void, rides the indestructible heavens, divides and unfolds the cosmic chart, and establishes the Three Realms—just as the human spirit, once more encased in the womb, gives rise to a body. This qi is the foundation of golden elixir and returning cinnabar.\n\nAbove heaven and below heaven, there is no darkness, no obscurity, no form, no shadow, no limit, no end. It is said that above and below heaven cannot be observed or measured, for it is self-so and naturally independent. The *Inner Meaning* says: It is like a person’s death, where the body perishes but the true nature alone endures. The *Dao De Jing* states: \"Looked at but not seen—it is called *Yi*; listened to but not heard—it is called *Xi*; grasped but not obtained—it is called *Wei*.\" Thus it is said: no darkness, no obscurity, no form, no shadow, no limit, no end. It cannot be questioned or fathomed, and so it merges into oneness—this is called the *Great Conduct of Brahman Qi*.\n\nAfter the kalpa’s dissolution, only the vast Brahman qi remains, boundless and lightless. The *Inner Meaning* says: Zhang Ziping’s *Ling Xian* states: \"Before the Great Simplicity, within it was only emptiness; within that emptiness was only nothingness.\" This is called the root of the Dao in the primordial chaos. The Mysterious Master says: Humans are born from the vast Brahman and die into the vast Brahman. The vast Brahman is the qi of spontaneity, the undifferentiated chaos. At the moment of parents’ union, this qi suddenly attaches and forms the embryo—crudely named *spirit*. This is detailed in the annotations to the *Red Text of the Chaotic Abyss*. From this, life arises.\n\nThe boundless darkness without light is the undivided chaos, where Yin and Yang are pent up, the sun and moon extinguished, and heaven and earth plunged into gloom—like a person in the mother’s womb, not yet born into the world. When it moves, it dies. Thus *Zhuangzi* says: \"The Lord of the Southern Sea was Shu, the Lord of the Northern Sea was Hu, and the Lord of the Center was Hundun. Shu and Hu often met in Hundun’s land, and Hundun treated them very well. Shu and Hu plotted to repay Hundun’s kindness, saying: 'All people have seven orifices for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing—only this one has none. Let us try to bore them.' Each day they bored one orifice, and on the seventh day Hundun died.\" The commentary says: Shu represents form; Hu represents formlessness. Hundun is the undifferentiated clarity and turbidity, symbolizing spontaneity. To bore it is to violate spontaneity, forcibly opening ears and eyes. This metaphor illustrates how the seven emotions, once aroused, scatter the ancestral qi of the vast Brahman, leading to decay and death—this is what is meant by \"from this, death arises.\"\n\nThe *Red Clarity* unfolds the cosmic chart, and the kalpa’s course proceeds naturally.",

      "translated_text": "In the midst of the Era of Extended Prosperity, the Primordial Beginning inaugurated the course of the Red Clarity, unfurling the resplendence of the cosmic chart and tally, and setting in motion the measured division of yin and yang. Thus, this kalpa came to be called the Kalpa of Red Clarity.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The Red Clarity marks the rekindling of yang qi following the dissolution of a kalpa, establishing the name of this new epoch. The \"unfurling of the chart\" signifies the re-establishment of the kalpic cycle, wherein the Heavenly Worthy unfolds the cosmic chart and tally, naturally setting the Dao’s course in motion. The \"chart and tally\" refer to the *Chaotic Cavern’s Crimson Script* and the *Primordial Cavern’s Jade Calendar*. Thereupon, Heaven and Earth took form, the sun and moon shone brightly, all beings followed their nature, and the myriad things were nurtured and reared.\n\nSpeaking of humans: emerging from the mother’s womb marks the beginning of this kalpic cycle. The stirring of innate nature and consciousness embodies the principle of the \"unfurling of the chart.\" Speech and sight, scent and hearing, grasping hands and walking feet, a lucid mind and discerning intent—these are the natural course of the Dao’s motion. Yet the foolish fall short, the wise exceed, and thus lose the mean, forfeiting the Dao of spontaneity.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning, securely enthroned, disseminated the Five Scriptures. The crimson writings on jade tablets heralded the rekindling of the ancestral qi, stabilizing Heaven and anchoring Earth. The Five Scripts unfolded the expanse, and the *Chaotic Cavern’s Crimson Script* was proclaimed anew. The *Eight Might’s Dragon Script*—the register of the Eight Might’s dragon-summoning—could subdue and tame demonic anomalies, command and employ divine spirits, safeguard and regulate the kalpic cycle, ensuring Heaven’s eternal endurance.\n\nOnce the Great Simplicity scattered, qi congealed into script. Being and non-being mutually sustained, manifesting benevolence while concealing utility. As the scripture says: \"Being provides advantage; non-being provides function.\" In the Dao, this ensures creation’s flawless transformation; in Heaven and Earth, it secures enduring imperishability; in humans, it grants immortality. Thus it is said: safeguarding and regulating the kalpic cycle ensures Heaven’s eternal endurance.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The Primordial Beginning’s secure enthronement signifies the pure, unified qi anchoring the Kun Palace. The dissemination of the Five Scriptures embodies the wondrous transformation of the Five Phases. The clustering within the divine chamber, the crimson writings on jade tablets, represent the primordial essence and true qi. The *Eight Might’s Dragon Script* embodies the Eight Radiant Yang Spirits, preserving and conveying this body through endless kalpas, transcending life and death, and attaining eternal union with Heaven.\n\nHumans, at birth, possess both destiny and nature: destiny is finite, but nature is indestructible. Though nature does not perish, the mediocre and foolish, upon the end of their destiny, cannot avoid dissolution and dispersion. The enlightened, through vigilant cultivation, unify life and death as one governance. Though destiny may end, nature undergoes no alteration. Yet even so, it does not compare to the Way of the Golden Elixir, wherein form and spirit are both perfected.\n\nThus Master Peng said: \"With the boundless primordial qi, one continues the limited mortal frame.\" The primordial qi is the true essence of Heaven and Earth’s eternal life, the qi of the sacred parents. The mortal frame is the turbid, ephemeral, chaotic vessel of ordinary parents. Thus, transforming the qi of the sacred parents to transmute the body of ordinary parents into a form of pure yang essence and true spirit enables one to attain longevity equal to Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Brahman qi pervades the cosmos, and the myriad patterns unfold. The *Inner Meaning* states: The Dao’s qi envelops and embraces the Great Void; the myriad things’ norms and models arise from this unfolding. The sun, moon, stars, and constellations, the peoples and all categories of beings, are all born, formed, and transformed by the Brahman qi.\n\nAccording to the *Sutra of Establishing Grades and Transformations*: \"Within the nameless and formless, the veiled and boundless primordial chaos, I initiated the mysterious and the yellow, dividing the numinous and dispersing the qi. From the Great Luo descended the Three Realms, then the Nine Heavens were generated. The Nine Heavenly Emperors were established as the mysterious ford of the Three Treasures, the Twenty-Seven Heavens as the cultivated grades of the realms, and the Thirty-Six Divisions as the mysterious roots of the Three Radiant Heavens, below which lie the domains of the Thirty-Six Heavens. Next, the Thirty-Two Heavens and Thirty-Two Emperors subtly set transformation in motion, dividing below into the Three Realms. Flanking the celestial pivot, the Twenty-Eight Constellations and Five Planets trace their courses to illuminate the Five Directions. Pure qi ascended, heavy turbidity congealed below, giving rise to the Nine Earths. At the center, the Nine Humans were born. Heaven, Earth, and all beings were thus complete.\n\nThus, the harmonious and upright qi of yang transformed into lofty sages and perfected immortals; the gentle, tranquil, and serene qi transformed into primordial lords, sacred consorts, immortal maidens, and jade women; the fierce, valiant, and heroic qi transformed into heavenly soldiers, divine warriors, and martial officials; the qi of yin and yang and the Five Phases transformed into men and women; and the chaotic and errant qi transformed into birds and beasts. All receive the same qi yet manifest in myriad forms, each following its own generation and transformation.\n\nSince the Great Void lies within the enveloping and embracing Dao qi, this body, too, resides within it. Like the norms of the myriad things, the sun, moon, stars, constellations, peoples, and all categories of beings, it is akin to the qi’s ascent and descent responding to yin and yang, or the cyclical revolutions of cold and heat manifesting as cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver. This is the transformation from non-being into being, forcibly named and modeled. To cling to it as real is to miss the wondrous Dao; returning to merge with the primordial is to achieve the Elixir.\n\nThe Primordial Net flows through the Thirty-Two Heavens, wheeling through the formless and circling the Ten Directions. Revolving the Dipper and traversing the Winnowing Basket, it cycles through the Five Constants. The Thirty-Five Divisions gather the qi of the Upper Origin. The Eight Radiant Realms merge in darkness, and qi enters the Mysterious of the Mysterious.\n\nThe Five Constants are the Five Phases. The Thirty-Five Divisions are the sun, moon, Five Planets, and Twenty-Eight Constellations. The *Inner Meaning* states: The Primordial Beginning’s ancestral qi, like a net’s guiding cords, is a unified whole. The Three Officials ascend and descend, circulating endlessly. This is what is meant by the Primordial Net flowing through the Thirty-Two Heavens, wheeling through the formless and circling the Ten Directions.\n\n\"Revolving the Dipper and traversing the Winnowing Basket, cycling through the Five Constants\" clarifies how the great Brahman ancestral qi begins its revolution at the Dipper and concludes at the Winnowing Basket, circling through the celestial degrees to complete the Five Phases. The Dipper and Winnowing Basket belong to the northeast, the position of Gen and Yin.

      "translated_text": "At this moment, with lead drawing mercury and yin summoning yang, it resembles the great potter’s wheel shaping all things—nothing fails to arise. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"In the primal chaos of the vast expanse, the female and male follow one another, their nourishing fluids moistening and enriching, their transformative influence flowing and circulating.\" Beginning in the northeast realm of the Dipper and Winnowing Basket, it revolves and turns rightward, spewing forth the wheel of sprouts, revealing hidden depths in the abyss, and scattering radiant essence.\n\nThereafter, yang qi ascends, and at its extreme, yin is born; yin qi descends, returning to the root and reverting to the source, encircling the entire body and revolving the Five Phases. Thus, Master Yixuan said:\n*\"The returning elixir extends life,\nReversing and cycling yin and yang qi.\nFather and son, ruler and minister,\nCirculate and return to one position.\"*\n\nSpring’s benevolence warms wood,\nSummer’s fire abides in ritual.\nAutumn’s justice belongs to metal,\nWinter’s wisdom is water.\nThe Yellow Lord alone upholds trust,\nEarth’s tally is wu and ji.\nThese are the true Five Phases,\nThe Five Phases fundamentally of one kind.\nVirtue and power are most distinct,\nThe ancestral masters focus solely on this.\n\nWithin a single day, within a year’s seasonal qi, heaven, earth, and the myriad things are all complete within me. The primordial qi stirs and yin-yang divides; yin-yang divides and the four seasons form; the four seasons form and the qi nodes cycle; the qi nodes cycle and the Five Phases are complete; the Five Phases are complete and creation is achieved.\n\nYin and yang qi are the sun and moon.\nThe four seasons are the four images.\nThe twenty-four qi nodes are the fire times.\nThe Five Phases are the medicinal substances.\nYin-yang and the Five Phases correspond to the Dipper’s four seasons.\nThe twenty-four qi correspond to the twenty-eight lunar lodges.\nThis is called the thirty-five divisions.\nCreation’s achievement arises entirely from the one qi’s guiding net, the Eight Trigrams’ transformations, the subtle workings of the mysterious mechanism, and the hidden accord with the profound principle. Thus, it is said: the thirty-five divisions, the upper origin of all qi, and the eight luminous scenes merge in darkness. It cannot be exhaustively questioned, so it is blended into one, endlessly beyond naming, reverting to nothingness—hence, \"qi enters the profound mystery.\" Within the profound is the Supreme August, the Highest Perfected, the Celestial Thearch.\n\nWhenever \"August\" is invoked, it is the title of the Heavenly Worthy, equal in rank to the Primordial Beginning. As the *Inner Meaning* states: \"Within the profound is the immortal among immortals, the perfected among the perfected, the sage among sages, the Dao among the Dao.\" The Supreme August is the Primordial Beginning; the Celestial Thearch is the Lord of the Dao; the Highest Perfected is the Venerable Lord. The annals say: The Primordial Beginning is a being of the Great Canopy Heaven; the Lord of the Dao is a being of the Western Na country; the Venerable Lord is the utmost essence of primordial generation, the utmost spirit of incipient form. Though their titles differ, their Dao is one.\n\nInwardly speaking, the Primordial Beginning as a being of the Great Canopy Heaven is the ancestral qi; the Lord of the Dao as a being of the Western Na country is the Metal Mother; the Venerable Lord as the utmost essence of primordial generation and the utmost spirit of incipient form is the cinnabar body. All are my true nature, originally no different from any other thing. As the Daoist scriptures say: \"The formless form, the imageless image.\" This is what the Buddhists call the three bodies inherent in one’s own nature. The Sixth Patriarch said: \"The pure Dharma-body is your nature; the perfect Reward-body is your wisdom; the hundred thousand million Transformation-bodies are your conduct.\" The Confucian texts say the same. The *Doctrine of the Mean* states: \"What Heaven imparts is called nature\"—this is the Primordial Beginning. \"Following nature is called the Dao\"—this is the Lord of the Dao. \"Cultivating the Dao is called teaching\"—this is the Venerable Lord. Though one thread runs through them all, they are the Dao.\n\nThe Confucians use it to govern the world, to order ruler and minister, to rectify high and low, their merit extending to things, and they too can transcend the world. Thus, the *Records of the Primordial Beginning’s Ascended Immortals* states: \"From ancient times, those of utmost loyalty, utmost filial piety, utmost integrity, and utmost incorruptibility—unlike the common crowd—have all been promoted to immortal offices.\" The Buddhists use it to transcend the world, hence they say: \"All conditioned things are impermanent, a dharma of arising and ceasing; when arising and ceasing cease, quiescence is bliss.\" The Daoist gate employs both presence and absence, interpenetrating the empty and the real, gathering to form shape and dispersing to form qi. Thus, it is said: \"The jade tally preserves the spirit, the golden liquid refines the form; when form and spirit are both wondrous, they unite with the Dao in truth.\"\n\nFloating upon the great aurora, chanting the cavernous chapters.\n\"Floating\" means drifting; \"scene\" means body. It speaks of the Heavenly Worthy drifting upon the auroral clouds and intoning the cavernous chapters. As the *Inner Meaning* states: \"Floating scene\" refers to the principle in the scriptures that \"the great Dao drifts—it can go left or right.\" \"Great aurora\" is the qi of constant yang, for the Dao is omnipresent. Wherever it drifts, it is not beyond the realm of constant yang, and intoning the cavernous chapters is the principle of ease and contentment. If one’s true nature is immersed in the primordial harmony, it is joyful and at peace. As *Zhuangzi* says: \"Wandering the mind in blandness, uniting qi in the vastness.\"\n\nThe golden perfection shines resplendently, its flowing resonance in the cloudy encampment.\nThe jade sound gathers qi, the numinous wind assembles mist.\nThe Purple Void flourishes luxuriantly, aiding and sheltering the ten thousand immortals.\n\n\"Golden perfection\" is the chapter of natural radiance, its flowing resonance in the palace of auspicious clouds. \"Jade sound\" is the chapter of jade light; with a single dawn roar, the numinous wind gathers mist. As the *Inner Meaning* states: \"Golden perfection shines resplendently\" means the true spirit is luminous and abundant. \"Flowing resonance in the cloudy encampment\" means qi returns to the spirit chamber. \"Jade sound gathers qi\" means lead qi attracts mercury. \"Numinous wind assembles mist\" means true mercury coagulates cinnabar. \"The Purple Void flourishes luxuriantly, aiding and sheltering the ten thousand immortals\" means the yang spirit is concealed and radiant, surrounded by the ten thousand qi, dwelling within the spirit chamber. This is called the body of the golden elixir.\n\nThus, Master Wen Shi’s *Eulogy on the Purple Void’s Yang Light Record* says:\n*\"The Void Origin’s peerless Purple Void Secret Record,\nRoot of the Three Caverns’ mystery,\nTrue ancestor of heaven and earth,\nUtmost high, utmost supreme,\nUtmost wondrous, utmost numinous.\nCultivating it, one attains long life;\nPracticing it as an immortal, one returns to simplicity and reverts to the uncarved block.\"*\n\nCarefully observing these words, the Dao of the Purple Void is no different from the golden elixir.",

From ancient times to now, its name has never faded.\"* This is called the golden liquid returned elixir.\n\nThe Noble Youth of Non-Flourishing, the Venerable White Prime, the Great One Who Oversees Destiny, Peach Prosperity and Union Longevity—\nThe Noble Youth of Non-Flourishing is the spirit of the liver; the White Prime is the spirit of the lungs; the Great One is the lord of all spirits; the Overseer of Destiny is the true one of the southern summit; Peach Prosperity and Union Longevity are the spirits of the left and right kidneys.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: \"The *Method of Uniting the Imperial One* says: 'White Prime, Non-Flourishing, Peach Lord, Overseer of Destiny, and the Great One—unite the five spirits, bearing the register and standing in attendance.'\" Each of the five spirits governs its domain; through nine transformations they merge, and the Three and Five penetrate and transform. Thus the Three Palaces are secured in truth, and the hundred joints receive numinosity. The Imperial Lord’s precious register ensures that one’s predestined life remains unshaken.\n\nRevolving through the misty void, they open the passage to mysterious essence. The twenty-four perfected ones suddenly manifest, ascending to open the Upper Prime, descending to open the Eight Dark Realms. To the left they summon the Six Jia, to the right they dispatch the Six Ding. The Jade Splendor draws the sun, and the Great One merges with form. A thousand chariots, ten thousand riders—with the whole body they ascend at dawn.\n\nCultivating the true Dao of the Imperial One, when merit is complete and the hundred spirits unite, the principle of the golden elixir is likewise fulfilled. Holding the talisman and grasping the register, one preserves life and roots existence.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* says: \"Talismans and registers: in terms of form, they are written characters; in terms of the formless, they are numinous qi. The adept of the elixir grasps yin and yang, wields heaven and earth, clarifies the marvelous workings of creation, and moves the subtle mysteries of lead and mercury. When spirit is whole and qi complete, one unites with the Dao in truth. The true spirit guards one’s nature and life; the numinous qi protects the root of one’s existence.\"\n\nAbove they roam the Upper Clarity, entering and exiting the Flowery Chambers. Within the Eight Dark Realms, amid the finest subtleties, below they guard the human body—Mud Pill Palace and Crimson Palace. In the center they govern the five qi and unite the hundred spirits. Ten revolutions return the numinous; ten thousand qi ascend as immortals together.\n\nThe Flowery Chambers are the Three Flowery Chambers of Jade Clarity. The Eight Dark Realms are the Eight Poles. The finest subtleties are the tips of hairs. Mud Pill Palace is the palace of the brain; Crimson Palace is the heart. These true spirits, with the Great One as their lord, roam the Three Clarities, enter and exit the Flowery Chambers, circulate within the Eight Poles, and pervade the finest subtleties. Below, they guard the human body: the Great One resides in the brain, governing all spirits; the Overseer of Destiny dwells in the heart, receiving the primordial of life; Non-Flourishing is in the liver, controlling the three hun souls; White Prime is in the lungs, restraining the seven po souls; Peach Lord is in the navel, preserving the root of essence; Union Longevity is in the kidneys, guarding the Gate of Life. In the center, within the hollow emptiness, they regulate the qi and harmonize the hundred spirits. As the *Book of Changes* says: *\"The spirit’s origin is boundless—this is what is meant by the unfathomability of yin and yang.\"*\n\nThus the spirit is present everywhere; wherever it is, there is nothing it does not penetrate. Wisdom and knowledge cannot be defined by existence or non-existence.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: \"The principles of inner and outer are identical and without distinction. The Flowery Chambers of Upper Clarity, the Eight Dark Realms, and the finest subtleties—these are outer manifestations, transformed by a single qi. Mud Pill Palace, Crimson Palace, the five qi, and the hundred spirits—these are inner manifestations, likewise transformed by a single qi. Now, the non-existent: vast, it encompasses all; minute, it enters all. As for the spirit—it is not swift, yet it is fast; it does not move, yet it arrives.\" Mencius said: *\"The vast qi fills the space between heaven and earth.\"* Zhuangzi said: *\"The spirit reaches in all four directions, flowing without limit, ascending to heaven above, coiling upon the earth below.\"*\n\nIf one nurtures it in accord with nature, then the Three Divisions and Eight Effulgences, the Three Passes and Five Viscera, the Six Bowels, the Nine Palaces and Golden Towers and Jade Chambers, the Twelve Heavy Gates and Purple Doors and Jade Enclosures, the thirty-six thousand joints—all these, from root to origin, when spirit is whole and qi sufficient, are called the pure and unadorned Dao. Thus it is said: *\"One who embodies purity and simplicity\"* is called a true person. They roam and ascend to Upper Clarity, enter and exit the Flowery Chambers, vast enough to embrace the Eight Dark Realms, subtle enough to enter the tips of hairs. When gathered, they form a body; when dispersed, they become qi. The Heavenly Pass revolves ten times; the perfected ones transmit the numinous. The ten thousand qi return to the origin, and all attain the immortal Dao.\n\nThe immortal Dao values life and delivers beings without limit.

      "translated_text": "The *Inner Meaning* states: What the immortal Dao values above all is longevity. Without limit in its boundlessness, it delivers beings as they become ripe for deliverance. The *Treatise on Stimulus and Response* says: Those who seek longevity must advance through the Dao and retreat from what is not the Dao; they must accumulate virtue and merit, cherish compassion toward all things, be loyal and filial, friendly and fraternal, rectify themselves and transform others. Such are called good people—all people respect them, the heavenly Dao protects them, blessings and prosperity follow them, all evil departs from them, divine spirits guard them, their undertakings surely succeed, and immortality may be hoped for. Those who seek to become Celestial Immortals must establish one thousand three hundred good deeds; those who seek to become Earthly Immortals must establish three hundred good deeds. Refrain from all evil and practice all good. Thus, the fortunate person speaks good, sees good, and does good—three good deeds in a single day. After three years, Heaven will surely bestow blessings upon them. The ill-fated person speaks evil, sees evil, and does evil—three evil deeds in a single day. After three years, Heaven will surely bring down calamity upon them. The good and evil of people are all created by the heart. The heart, in its issuing and entering, takes form as an image; its gate moves in accord with the image. Its wheel of mental mechanism is perfected within, and the heavenly mechanism responds without. Thus, there are the Eight Gates of the Dharma Wheel, within which lies the arena of transgressions and blessings, the traces of prohibitions and precepts, and the origins of causes and conditions—all recorded in the *Dharma Wheel Sutra*. Though it is said that the transformation of great compassion universally opens deliverance, blessings vary in depth, and karmic retribution differs in degree. This is called: \"All predestined lives are heard, and the heavens above bestow according to one’s meritorious deeds.\" In receiving life, the souls of the dead enter the gate corresponding to their karmic fruit, while the reborn body attains ranks of immortality, high or low.\n\nWithin these are the chapters of the *Empty Cavern Songs*, the *Numinous Writ of the Demon Kings*, and verses that rival those of the loftiest perfected beings. The *Inner Meaning* states: The preceding text speaks of the Gate of Life above each of the various heavens. The Dao Lord continues, saying: \"Within these are the chapters of the *Empty Cavern Songs*.\" Some say \"Empty Cavern\" is the general name for the Three Realms; others say it refers to the principle of the *Cavern Chapters*. Taken together, the Three Realms encompass all the heavens, and within these heavens are the *Empty Cavern Songs*—the scriptures and records of the Three Caverns, the writings of the celestial perfected, hymns of praise, and the wondrous principles of the mysterious texts that awaken later learners. The flying songs of the Demon Kings, composed in midair, serve as warnings and admonitions, their principles in harmony with the celestial perfected. The Dao Lord has recorded them here, though they are not part of the original *Numinous Treasure* chapters and thus do not belong to the inner symbolic order; only their meaning is explained.\n\nThe above is the main text, recorded by the Jade Dawn Dao Lord.\n\nThe first is the *Flying Song of the Desire Realm*:\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The Demon King of the Desire Realm composed this song.

      "translated_text": "The Ghostly Way delights in the gate of human life,\nYet perverse paths rush toward death.\nThe Heavenly Way treasures life,\nDesiring humanity’s long existence.\nThe Ghostly Way treasures endings,\nDesiring humanity’s final death.\nThe Immortal Way is ever auspicious,\nFor it knows the constant, understands the luminous—thus is it auspicious.\nThe Ghostly Way is ever inauspicious,\nFor it acts in delusion—thus is it inauspicious.\nThe lofty and pure numinous spirits,\nSing mournful songs resounding through the vast sky.\nThey only wish the Immortal Way to succeed,\nAnd do not desire the human way to come to ruin.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: In clarity, they are the lofty perfected and exalted sages; in obscurity, they are the pure and numinous spirits. Moved by compassion for the world’s people, they proclaim the principles of all things, awakening those of utmost learning and illuminating the space between Heaven and Earth. They only wish the Immortal Way to succeed, and do not desire the human way to come to ruin.\n\nAn ancient virtuous one said: In the secluded forest, birds call; in the emerald stream, fish leap. Clouds drift and unfold; waterfalls murmur in sorrow. Such scenes reveal the path for humanity to enter. From this perspective, the myriad transformations, though vast and chaotic, are nothing but mournful songs.\n\nMaster Dongshan said: If you rely on the ear to listen, you will never grasp it; only when the eye hears the sound will you come to know.\n\n*Zhuangzi* said: Do not listen with the ear, but listen with the heart.\n\nLike rushing waters in a swift river, like a white colt passing through a gap—sun-bird and moon-hare reveal the foundation of cinnabar. The snake’s sloughing and cicada’s molting manifest the principle of liberation. The spirit turtle imbibes qi; the dung beetle rolls its ball. The fish by the Hao River’s banks in Qiyuan, the grass before Lianxi’s window—all can be inwardly apprehended, the Way perceived in the very act of seeing. This is the teaching without words, the hearing without sound.\n\nIn the winding springs of the Northern Capital’s subterranean府,\nA myriad ghosts gather in throngs.\nThey only seek to cut short human destiny,\nSevering the gate of human life.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The offices of Mount Fengdu govern punishment and retribution, recording transgressions and diminishing lifespans. Once the lifespan is exhausted, the limit of life is extinguished.\n\nAs the scripture notes: The lifespan a person receives at birth is called their \"allotment,\" recorded among the heavens. By decree of the Most High, the heavens and earth, sun and moon, stars and constellations, celestial perfected and exalted sages, generals and messengers, great spirits and divine youths, flying immortals of Heaven and Earth, the four bureaus of the Three Realms, and the officials of mountains and rivers—all hold registers and ledgers, patrolling and examining. Every three days, a report is made; every ten days, a memorial is submitted; every hundred days, a reckoning is settled. At the Three Primes, Eight Nodes, Five La Festivals, and Three Assemblies, merits and faults are assessed without cease. If one cultivates goodness, their years are extended; if one commits evil, their allotment is reduced, and they are sent to Fengdu with not a fraction lost.\n\nAh, the people sing the cavernous chapters,\nTo restrain the northern Luo and Deng.\nBinding and delivering demonic spirits,\nSevering the blades of the Six Ghosts.\nThe qi of the myriad heavens surges boundlessly,\nMy Way flourishes day by day.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: When external deviance is eliminated, the qi of the myriad heavens surges boundlessly; when inner conduct is established, my Way flourishes day by day.\n\nThe second is the *Song of the Form Realm’s Demon King*:\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The Demon King of the Form Realm composed this song. When the karmic deeds of the body in a person are entirely purified, and they possess three hundred virtues, they ascend to be reborn in the Eighteen Heavens of the Form Realm. Lofty and expansive—this is Heaven. Radiant qi shines in four directions—this is qi. The Brahma-conduct heavens encircle the ten directions; Brahma-qi envelops all. Immeasurable great spirits all arise from my body. All those who attain the Way are recommended for perfection by the Demon King. This demonstrates to practitioners the principle of promotion and demotion, so they may know what to take warning from.\n\nI possess cavernous chapters,\nTen thousand repetitions make an immortal.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The cavernous chapters are the *Flying Mystery Purple Writ of Mount Gui’s Cinnabar and Yellow*. When the Perfected Lord Yin attained the Way, the Elder Lord granted him the Western Tower of Hao Terrace. Entering the Seven Treasures Garden, he beheld its scripture. Practicing it according to the method, as fully recorded in the *Numinous Treasure Scriptures and Methods*, one achieves the rank of Numinous Treasure Perfected—this is not the Demon King’s song. \"Ten thousand repetitions make an immortal\"—ten thousand is the accumulation of one; it cannot be accomplished in a single morning or evening. Thus, it is achieved through accumulated practice.\n\nFormerly, the Perfected Lord of Fixed Records said to Lord Xu of Leiping: \"Studying the Way is like digging a well: the deeper the well, the harder it is to remove the soil. If one does not steadfastly cultivate correct conduct, how can they reach the spring’s source?\" This is the principle of accumulated practice.\n\nThe Immortal Way values deliverance,\nWhile the Ghostly Way clings to connection.\nWhat the Immortal Way values is long life and deliverance from the world; otherwise, when the body perishes and qi scatters, the hun and po souls are examined, and ancestors are implicated—how can one not be cautious?\n\nHeaven and Earth are vast and boundless,\nFoul qi swirls in abundance.\nThe joys of the Three Realms—\nPass beyond them to abide forever.\nCrossing into my realm,\nThe body enters spontaneity.\nAt this time, joy—\nIs but a trifling grace from me.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: In the vastness of physical forms, none surpass Heaven and Earth, yet foul and turbid qi also fill their midst. The Great Void is vast and empty, unobstructed by the myriad encounters.\n\nA master of great wisdom said: In the vastness of empty space, is there anything that obstructs it? Though it is not obstructed by things, it does not hinder things from coming and going. If a person’s nature is as vast and empty as Heaven, unobstructed by things, emulating the all-embracing nature of the Great Void, they transcend the six senses and six dusts, surpassing the Desire Realm, Form Realm, and Formless Realm. Habitual tendencies are entirely forgotten, and they no longer sink into the cycle of rebirth. Flesh and bones ascend together, entering the formless, attaining this state—true joy abides forever. Though this comes from cultivation, merit fulfilled and virtue perfected, it is also through the Demon King’s recommendation. This is one who attains the Way through the power of scriptural practice. If the work of the cinnabar path is accomplished, one ascends without passing through the ranks, immediately attaining the highest grade of immortality.\n\nThe Dragon Han era stretches boundlessly—\nHow can one distinguish the true?\n\nThe Dragon Han is the name of the first kalpa. At that time, the Great Way was pure and simple, its transformations effortless and unadulterated; human nature was likewise. The *Inner Meaning* states: At the inception of receiving one’s nature, like an infant before it can smile, how could there be distinctions of refinement and coarseness? The originally inherent nature is serene and pure; it is only through the delusions of emotions and consciousness that defilement and attachment arise.\n\nThe Most High said: \"My greatest affliction is that I have a body.\"",

When the karmic deeds of speech in a person are entirely purified, and they possess the ten virtues, they ascend to be reborn in the Six Heavens of the Desire Realm. The human realm is fleeting and frivolous; the immortal Dao is vast and difficult to fathom.",

      "translated_text": "The *Inner Meaning* states: Those who preserve the true remain steadfast and unchanging; those who are deluded dwell in illusion and are easily swayed. What is fragrant as orchid and musk, the enlightened call foul and wanton qi; the arena of right and wrong, the enlightened call the turmoil of sin and fortune; the allure of powdered faces, the enlightened call the poisonous blossoms of the turtledove. The world delights in these, hence the deluded are many.\n\nThe Dao of immortals is hard to uphold; the path of ghosts is easily corrupted. The Dao of immortals is tranquil and non-action—though precepts are set, few firmly abide. Worldly affairs indulge the heart’s desires; without instruction or temptation, one naturally follows dissipation. The human Dao lies in the heart—truly, it does not come from elsewhere.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The Three Teachings all arise from the ground of the heart. The Confucians speak of preserving the heart, the Daoists of cultivating the heart, and the Buddhists of illuminating the heart. Some say rectifying the heart, washing the heart; some say emptying the heart, quieting the heart; some say stilling the heart, subduing the heart—all aim to refine it and restore its goodness. Thus, the Confucian cultivates the self, orders the family, governs the state, and brings peace to the world, all proceeding from the rectification of the heart. Extending this to others, one finds ample room—how could it be external to the heart?\n\nThe *Book of Documents* says: *The human heart is perilous; the Dao-heart is subtle. Only with precision and unity can one truly hold to the center.* As for extending knowledge and investigating things, these too are attained through rectifying the heart.\n\nThe Daoists say: *The void gives me life; non-being places me. That which gives me life is spirit; that which destroys me is the heart.* They also say: *All the evil karma of sentient beings arises from the heart’s deluded thoughts and inversions, failing to awaken to non-action. All roots of sin are created by the heart. The joys of heaven arise from the heart; the sinking into the Three Realms also begins in the heart.*\n\nThe Buddhists say: *If one wishes to fully know all buddhas of the three times, one should contemplate the nature of the dharma-realm—all is created by the heart.* They also say: *A hundred thousand dharma-gates all return to the square inch of the heart; the sands of the Ganges’ wondrous virtues all reside in the source of the heart. All gates of precepts, concentration, and wisdom, all spiritual transformations and miracles, are fully possessed within—none are apart from your heart.* As Mazu said: *The heart itself is buddha.* The *Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment* states: *All sentient beings are the ground of pure awakening.*\n\nPei Xiu said: *That which is truly pure, luminous, wondrous, and empty—penetrating and spiritually efficacious, standing solitary and unchanging—is the heart. Turning away from it makes one ordinary; following it makes one sagely. Delusion gives rise to the beginning of birth and death; awakening brings the end of rebirth.*\n\nYang Guishan said: *The entire *Mencius* is but an effort to rectify the human heart, teaching people to preserve the heart and nurture nature, to gather the scattered heart. Though a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, all arise from the heart. If one can rectify the heart, nothing else need be done.*\n\nShao Kangjie said: *Heaven divides creation from the One Center; humans initiate governance from the heart.* He also said: *The body is born after heaven and earth; the heart exists before heaven and earth. Heaven and earth emerge from me—what else need be said?*\n\nFrom this, we see it is truly not from elsewhere. The essential lies in vigilance in solitude: do not look at what is contrary to propriety, do not listen to what is contrary to propriety, do not speak what is contrary to propriety, do not act in ways contrary to propriety. Do not see what may be desired, lest the heart be disturbed. Abide in stillness and quietude, anchoring the spirit—let no stray thoughts arise. Embrace the One and guard the true; spirit harmonizes and qi clarifies. Let the heart be like dead ashes, the form like withered wood. External scenes do not enter; inner scenes naturally close. Do not pursue, do not cling—ten thousand thoughts will settle of themselves. Concentrate qi to attain suppleness. Return to the nature of an infant.\n\nShould one act contrary to this, one merely invites hardship. The Dao of immortals values substance: *See the plain and embrace the uncarved; returning to life is called constancy.* The human Dao values splendor: like feasting on grand sacrifices, like ascending spring terraces. If you do not delight in the Dao of immortals, how can you transcend the Three Realms? If you wish to turn through the Five Paths, what can I do for you?\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: Those who do not delight in the Dao of immortals value the splendor of the human realm. Enamored of worldly pleasures, they do not know the suffering of rebirth. According to the *Sutra of Origins*: *When thoughts cannot return and one turns away from the Dao, one enters the Five Paths without respite.* What are the Five Paths? The first path: the spirit ascends to heaven as a heavenly spirit. The second path: the spirit enters flesh and bone to become a human spirit. The third path: the spirit enters birds and beasts to become an animal. The fourth path: the spirit enters creeping vines to become a hungry ghost. The fifth path: the spirit enters the hells of mud and plough to be tormented.\n\nAlas! The Great Sage, in boundless compassion, earnestly warns: if one awakens to the fact that worldly pleasures are not true pleasures and that transcending the Three Realms is true joy, one will surely not endure rebirth through the Five Paths.\n\nThe above is the main text as narrated by the Dao Lord.\n\nAbove the Three Realms, in the void of flight, the Demon King’s song resonates, its melody interwoven with cavernous hymns. Reciting it a hundred times is called *Passing the Southern Palace*. Reciting it a thousand times, the Demon King will protect and welcome you. After ten thousand recitations, the Dao is perfected, and you will ascend to the great void, transcend the Three Realms, and be enthroned as an immortal duke. Those who hear the numinous sound—the Demon King will show reverence. The numinous sound refers to the original hymns of the *Numinous Treasure*; the Dao Lord praised the Demon King’s song, saying that even reciting it can lead to perfection and entry into the Dao—how much more so the original hymns of the *Numinous Treasure*!\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: When the heart aligns with the scripture and conduct accords with it, uniting goodness as one and cutting off all conditions, recitation then truly embodies the scripture’s intent. It commands and restrains earthly deities, who escort and receive, delivering one from the Five Sufferings and Eight Difficulties of the earthly realm. Seven generations of ancestors ascend, forever departing the ghostly officials. The soul crosses the Vermilion Mound, undergoes refinement, and is reborn.\n\nThe above command and restraint were bestowed by the Celestial Venerable of Original Beginning; the Dao Lord recorded them.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: *Command and restraint* refers to the decrees of the Celestial Venerable of Original Beginning—the primordial qi of the Original Beginning. Decrees are the workings of creation. *Earth* is soil; *only* is spirit, signifying that the primordial qi of creation, the true nature of soil, gives birth to spirit.",

      "translated_text": "Those who *escort and guard* cultivate correctness, sustain fullness, preserve the feminine, and embrace the One. Those who *send off and receive* are the flow of *kan* into *wu*, the movement of *li* toward *ji*—this is the completion of merit and the perfection of the elixir. Thus the *Wuzhen Pian* says:\n\n*Take the solid from the next position in the heart,\nRefine the yin within the Palace of Li.*\nFrom this, it transforms into the firmness of *qian*,\nA hidden, soaring, and free heart.\n\nWhen yang *qi* is pure and complete, and yin *qi* is entirely stripped away, one transcends the reckoning of the Five Phases and escapes the mechanism of the Eight Trigrams—hence it is said: *delivered from the earthly realm’s Five Sufferings and Eight Difficulties.* Yin *qi* is severed at the Gate of *kun*, thus *seven generations of ancestors ascend, forever departing the ghostly officials.* The yang spirit gathers in the Palace of *li*, thus *the soul crosses the Vermilion Mound, undergoes refinement, and is reborn.* This is the divine transformation of shedding the mortal coil—*the immortal of eternal life.*\n\nSuch is the boundless, universally liberating power. It holds the secret celestial script, revered by all heavens. To leak or profane it is to fall into hell, bringing calamity upon seven generations of ancestors.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: Vast as heaven and earth, minute as insects, this Dao is complete, lacking nothing. It is not bestowed because of nobility, nor withheld because of lowliness. Its secrecy exists only to prevent disrespect. If one can revere and practice it, blessings are infinite; if one is negligent, dark retribution remains.\n\nThe Dao says: These two chapters are the hidden sounds of the Heavenly Emperors and the Divine Kings of Spirits—utterances of the Great Brahma, not the common speech of the world. Their words lack ornate rhythm, their melodies lack florid beauty; thus they are called profound and obscure, difficult to fathom.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: These two chapters are the *Hundun Chiwen* and the *Yuandong Yuli.* One reveals the Dao of the Primordial Heaven, the other the principles of the Posterior Heaven. Their hidden sounds, the words of the Great Brahma, the mysteries of the elixir—all follow the same principle. Not being the language of the world, they are hard to investigate. Without a master’s guidance, how could they be easily understood?\n\nThis treasure of heaven is kept secret in the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Mysterious Capital. According to the celestial statutes, it is transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas. If a perfected person offers gold and treasures with a sincere heart, following the old protocol and pledging allegiance to the Ten Heavens, only then is it bestowed. Ten thousand kalpas are like last night; a thousand springs are like this morning. Thus, a transmission once every forty thousand kalpas is not truly distant—this is the celestial standard, not the timeframe of mortal transmission.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: This scripture and this Dao are heavenly treasures, with strict protocols for transmission. How could they be treated lightly?\n\nThe Dao says: The revolutions of heaven and earth also have their ends. *End* refers to the calamity of the *yang* nine and hundred-six. *Termination* refers to the dissolution of the Three Realms. The sun, moon, and five planets also wax and wane. Even the most sagely and divine beings experience cycles of flourishing and decline. Lesser students also face illness and injury. If heaven, earth, and sages have their times of decline, how could lesser students avoid affliction? If one encounters such, accept it without resentment.\n\nWhen such disasters arise, all of shared *qi* must act together: with unified hearts, perform purification rites, burn incense in the six periods, and recite the scripture ten times. Blessings and virtue will descend immediately, dissolving all misfortune. The boundless scripture universally liberates without end.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: Humans, heaven, earth, and the myriad things are of a single *qi.* Thus the Most High addressed the four assemblies: When any among them face disaster, all of shared *qi* should unite in purification rites, burning incense and reciting scriptures—this is to view all as one body. How could one who cultivates the Dao place self and others in the chamber of the mind?\n\nMaster Zeng said: The Master’s Dao is nothing but loyalty and reciprocity. *Loyalty* is exhausting oneself; *reciprocity* is extending oneself to others. If I desire peace, how could others not desire it as well? Thus, when I wish to stand, I help others stand; when I wish to succeed, I help others succeed. Then there is no killing or harming, no jealousy or envy, no licentiousness or theft, no greed or desire, no hatred or resentment. Words are free of embellishment, speech free of malice. With unified compassion and love, even those of different bones become kin. This is how it is achieved.\n\nIt is said: To become an earthly immortal, perform three hundred good deeds; to become a heavenly immortal, perform one thousand three hundred good deeds—this is not difficult. If one can follow this, why merely become an immortal? The Dao of Great Peace will be complete.\n\nThe Dao says: If a student’s cultivation is shallow and their immortal rank incomplete, when their destined time of passing arrives and their body enters the Great Yin, at the moment of transition, fellow students and perfected ones should burn incense and recite the scripture ten times to deliver the corpse according to the method. The soul will ascend directly to the Southern Palace, and according to their merit, after a set number of days, they will be reborn. Escaping the wheel of rebirth, they will attain immortality.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: If one’s practice is insufficient, fate cannot be escaped. Though this form is shed and appears dead, the feet do not turn green, the skin does not wrinkle, the eyes do not dim, and the limbs remain pliable. Following the protocol for delivering the corpse, the spirit undergoes refinement in the Yin realm. According to the depth of their merit and the length of their practice, after the allotted time, the spirit returns to the body, and they are reborn. Though outwardly deceased, after years or even decades, it is but a moment in time. From then on, they attain immortality—this is also the Dao of corpse liberation.\n\nThe Dao says: When the revolutions of heaven and earth end, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When the stars and constellations fall into disorder and the sun and moon lose their regularity, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When the four seasons lose their order and yin and yang fall out of harmony, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. These three cannot escape the reckoning of fate, but human effort can assist them. Human effort cannot alter their outcome, yet the Dao grants it.\n\nWhen the ruler of a state faces disaster and warfare erupts on all sides, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When plague and pestilence spread, causing the death of the people, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures.",

      "translated_text": "When masters or friends face the end of their allotted span, one should likewise perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. In these three matters, Heaven cannot manifest its efficacy unaided; human effort brings them to fruition, yet human effort cannot exhaust their utmost sincerity—this, too, is granted by the Dao.\n\nNow, purification rites and scripture recitation carry profound merit: above, they dissolve celestial calamities and safeguard the emperor; below, they dispel poisonous harms and deliver the multitudes. In life and death, all depend upon them, their blessings beyond measure. Thus it is said: boundless, they universally ferry across heaven and humanity.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: Humans, bearing the form of Heaven, dwell between yin and yang, never departing the bounds of their mold—how could they escape hardship and adversity? The workings of creation move in secret; cold and heat shift imperceptibly. If one does not adjust in accord with the seasons, suddenly afflicted by pestilence, how could illness be avoided? Speaking inwardly, when \"the movements of Heaven and Earth reach their end,\" this is the exhaustion of fate. When \"the stars and constellations fall into disorder and the sun and moon lose their regularity,\" this is the turbidity and chaos of spirit and qi, the dizziness and palpitations of heart and eyes. When \"the four seasons lose their order and yin and yang fall out of harmony,\" this is the imbalance of dryness and dampness, cold and warmth, the discord of the two qi. As for \"performing purification rites, burning incense, and reciting scriptures,\" this is to empty the heart and refine qi, to nurture the spirit and preserve the true. It can succor the world and revive the dying, avert misfortune and dispel illness.\n\nIf the ruler of a state faces disaster, warfare erupts on all sides, plague and pestilence spread, causing the death of the people, or masters and friends face the end of their span, one should rouse loyalty and sincerity, compassion and pity, dispel calamities and rescue the afflicted, employing arts of salvation to accumulate good karma and amass hidden merit. Thus it is said: purification rites and scripture recitation carry profound merit.\n\nNow, purification is the purification of the heart. When Yanzi abstained from wine and meat, Confucius called it the purification for sacrifice, not the purification of the heart. The purification of the heart is to empty the heart. The *Daoist Canon’s Record of Calculations* states: \"A ten-day purification fast adds a twelve-year cycle to one’s lifespan; a one-day purification fast adds a hundred days.\" This purification is none other than the purification of the heart.\n\nAs for precepts, Lord Laozi said: \"Those who study the supreme Dao yet do not uphold the great precepts—reciting scriptures, chanting incantations, wearing talismans, praying to spirits, compounding elixirs, ingesting medicines, or retiring to the mountains to seek ascent as immortals—may hardly hope for success. If one can fully uphold the precepts inwardly while harmonizing one’s light outwardly, one may approach the threshold of the numinous. It is not cultivation that is difficult, but upholding the precepts. If you can fully uphold the precepts, extending your thoughts to the ten directions, the Most High will ensure your ascent as an immortal. If one upholds the precepts fully, recites the precious scriptures, wears the great talismans, and performs the rites, yet still does not ascend as an immortal, then there is no path to deathlessness under Heaven. What I lament about the world is the rarity of such people.\"\n\nTo have scriptures without precepts is like crossing the sea without a boat or oars, like having a mouth without a tongue—how could one ferry across the multitudes? The essence of the Dao lies in aligning one’s conduct with the true regulations and accumulating goodness within; only then may one enter the realm of the great Dao. Those who cannot do so labor in vain amidst the dust, gaining nothing for the length of their lives.\n\nThus, precepts have distinct texts, their outlines briefly set forth: the Five Precepts of Lord Laozi, the One Hundred Eighty Precepts conferred upon Master Yin, the Seventy-Two Precepts conferred upon the Perfected Master Gan, the Twenty-Four Precepts of the Great Clarity, the Twelve Precepts for Purification Rites and Daoist Practices, the Ten Precepts for Cultivating the True, the Nine Wondrous Precepts of the Nine Perfected, the Nine Precepts of the Numinous Treasure, the Five Precepts of the Orthodox Unity—others are fully recorded in the scriptures and repentance texts, too numerous to name. Without exception, they serve to examine the heart and restrain the self, to cease evil and prevent wrongdoing. In short: think no deviance, respect all things. What is most urgent is to place lust first. Thus it is said: lust is the foremost of the ten defeats, killing comes next. Other actions that hinder Daoist practice or obstruct principle should all be abandoned. The scriptures say: \"Diminish and diminish again, until reaching non-action.\"\n\nAll who uphold the precepts must meticulously study and practice them. If there is anything not understood, omitted, violated, or mistakenly transgressed, all incur transgressions and sins, collectively called \"breaking the precepts.\" One should then repent and confess. The Queen Mother of the West said: \"Those who yearn for the Dao and aspire to immortality must concentrate their sincerity and will, purify themselves and reflect on transgressions, thereby eliminating a hundred faults. Restraining the self and returning to goodness, revering the true spirits, preserving the true and guarding the One—practicing this for a month eliminates a thousand faults. Thus, faults are transformed, the preserved becomes numinous, the world is succored, the state is blessed, and all under Heaven enjoy its great benefits. Yin and yang harmonize and settle, ghosts and spirits do not disturb, all beings fulfill their natures, and the myriad things remain unharmed. Outwardly, this is the response; inwardly, the result may be known. How could it not 'dissolve celestial calamities above, safeguard the emperor, dispel poisonous harms below, and deliver the multitudes'? How could its blessings not be 'beyond measure, universally ferrying across heaven and humanity'?\"\n\nHere ends *Volume Four of the Inner Meaning of the Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of the Boundless Salvation of Humanity*.\n\n*Volume Five of the Inner Meaning of the Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of the Boundless Salvation of Humanity*\n\nObserving Reversion said: Master Xiao Ying studied the Dao.\n\nThe Dao states: Whoever possesses this scripture and performs these meritorious deeds for Heaven and Earth, the emperor, and the multitudes—on days of disaster, rousing the heart to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures ten times—all the heavens record their names, the myriad spirits attend and protect them, and the distinguished Perfected Ones of the right distinguish them, enabling them to become ministers of the Golden Gates of the Sage Lord.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: As previously said, when \"the movements of Heaven and Earth reach their end, the sun, moon, and five planets wane and wax, the sagely flourish or decline, and the unlearned suffer illness or harm,\" one should perform purification rites and recite scriptures. It is also said: \"Purification rites and scripture recitation can dissolve celestial calamities, safeguard the emperor, dispel poisonous harms, and deliver the multitudes. Performing these meritorious deeds, all the heavens record their names, the myriad spirits attend and protect them, the distinguished Perfected Ones of the right distinguish them, enabling them to become ministers of the Golden Gates of the Sage Lord.\" Thus, merit returns to oneself. Therefore, the ancients said: \"The word 'goodness' is most capable of accomplishing all practices.\"",

      "translated_text": "May one’s good intentions be voiced, and the heavens above shall hear them—resounding like the crack of firecrackers—whereupon the Perfected Ones and all the sages above will surely uphold them, for their hearts are in accord. As the scripture says: “Having acted for others, one finds oneself all the more enriched; having given to others, one finds oneself all the more abundant.” How could the purport of the *Contemplation Scripture* deceive us? The heavens record each person’s merits and transgressions, not missing even the slightest fraction. Even the demon-kings of the celestial realms will safeguard and commend those who attain the Way, for this is the luminous truth of the most profound teachings.\n\nThe old commentary states: In cultivating the Dao, as merit and virtue accumulate and become manifest, the heavens record one’s goodness, and the demon-kings protect and commend one, naturally leading to profound understanding, embodiment of the real, and penetration of the scriptures’ purport.\n\nWithin the heavens, the Great Brahma’s hidden language resounds with boundless tones. The *Inner Meaning* says: The Great Brahma is the primordial qi of the Original Beginning, which coalesces and disperses to form sound. *Fan* (梵) means “pervasive,” for it is the same throughout the six directions. “Hidden language” refers to the secrets of the celestial realms, which worldly people cannot comprehend. “Boundless tones” means that beings of all regions and kinds universally hear the wondrous meaning, without limit or end. Altogether, there are two hundred fifty-six characters, distributed among the thirty-two heavens, eight characters to each. They are also inscribed upon the palaces and towers of the Mysterious Capital and the various heavens. If one can ingest these characters, then according to one’s practice, one rides the qi and returns to one’s proper place.\n\nAccording to the *Scripture of Inner Sounds*: Once, the Most High Lord of the Original Beginning was seated in the Cypress Mound Lodge of the Vermilion Brightness World. At that time, clouds and mist surged for three days and nights, and the dark yin did not disperse. The Five Elders addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Today, as we attend your seat, we witness what we have never seen before. When the Heavenly Worthy expounds the teachings, rivers and seas fall silent, and mountains and peaks conceal their clouds. Yet now, in broad daylight, darkness prevails, and the heavenly and human realms are filled with dread. We do not know the reason.” The Heavenly Worthy replied: “Today, the heavens have emitted auspicious signs, and numinous responses arise spontaneously. Jade characters gleam resplendently, obscuring the light of heaven. Let all in the four directions close their eyes and listen reverently.” In an instant, the celestial qi suddenly parted, the gloom vanished, and five-colored radiance illuminated the ten directions. Suddenly, a divine scripture appeared in the empty mystery above, its characters a full *zhang* in size, its patterns and hues dazzling, its eight corners trailing rays of light. The brilliance was so intense that none could gaze upon it directly. The Heavenly Worthy proclaimed to all: “This is the *Numinous Scripture of the Eight Assemblies*. Its characters have no fixed form; their import is subtle and profound, difficult to fathom. They must be annotated.” Thereupon, the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign received the Heavenly Worthy’s luminous command and annotated its sounds, transmitting them to the Dao Lord, who taught them to all in the heavens who were destined to attain the Way, achieve Perfection, and gain immortal names.\n\n---\n\n**The Middle Section of the Numinous Scripture of the Original Beginning**\n*Composed by the Dao Lord*\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* says: The white characters marked in the *Numinous Scripture* correspond to the symbolic forms of the hexagrams’ qi, the seasonal nodes, and the times of day. The ancient Perfected Ones declared that this *Numinous Scripture* accords with the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Great Change*. This scripture existed before heaven and earth, before the hexagrams came into being. The Queen Mother of the West, over nine days, guided the *Qian* and *Kun* hexagrams to manifest the *Mu* and *Dong* trigrams, so that *Qian* and *Kun* began with these, followed by *Zhun* and *Meng*, and concluding with *Ji Ji*, forming the warp and woof of creation. The sixty *jiazi* cycles listed below clarify the beginning and end of the qi’s numerical circulation. The twelve hexagrams of the monthly nodes and seasons that follow illustrate the waxing and waning of yin and yang, the advance and retreat of cold and heat over the year. The separate notations for the waxing and waning of the new and full moons clarify a single month. The twelve two-hour periods further mark the fire phases and the advance and retreat of the water tally within a single day. Thus, the nodes of a year are compressed into a month, and two and a half days correspond to a month. The twelve hexagrams that follow, matching the twelve two-hour periods, further condense a month into a single day. One two-hour period corresponds to two and a half days. Therefore, the upper and lower hexagrams differ in their applications, and the *jiazi* cycles and seasonal nodes also vary in meaning. In sum, the upper hexagrams’ *jiazi* are the warp, while the lower hexagrams’ seasonal nodes and times of day are the weft. The cultivated person need only observe the movements and stillness, the rises and falls, the waxings and wanings, and naturally will grasp the meaning beyond words, for the subtlest principles are all contained herein. Following the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign’s annotations of the inner sounds, some passages have been abridged to retain essentials, while others have been expanded with additional characters to elucidate the text, all to ensure that people may understand its meaning.\n\n**Dǎnlóu Ācāng, Yù**\n*Dīngchǒu*\n\nThe old commentary says: *Dǎn* describes a vast and boundless appearance. *Lóu* refers to the long tower beneath the Jade Capital Mountain, which supports the Mysterious Capital Palace. *Ā* is the name of the spirit of the palace’s eaves, who oversees the tower’s surveillance and governs the qi of the Great Brahma. When the qi’s cycles complete their circuit, *Ānà* sounds the drum of the tower capital, assembling the multitude of Perfected Ones to pay homage to the Original Beginning. This occurs three times daily, with one drumbeat, as the regular observance. *Cāng* is the name of the terrace where the Imperial Lord roams, lush with verdant splendor. *Wúhé Guānyīn*.\n\n**Suí**\n*Wùyín*   The Spring Equinox node corresponds to the *Great Strength* hexagram, and the sun corresponds to the *mǎo* hour.\n\nThe old commentary says: *Wú* is the Great Void. Within the Great Void, the true sages naturally arise. *Hé* is the name of the gate of the sun and moon. *Guān* means “awakening,” and is the taboo name of the Heavenly Emperor. The sound is that of the eight characters; reciting them enables the Perfected to ride the golden wheel and open the darkness, while the Jade Maidens wave flowered banners to unfasten the gates. The *Awakening* oversees the records of the long night, delivers the four dark realms, and rescues the nine nether palaces. The seven generations of ancestors are illuminated, and decayed bones revive. These eight characters are the inner sounds of the Yellow and Primeval Heavens.\n\n**Xūyán Míngshǒu, Gǔ**\n*Jǐmǎo*\n\nThe old commentary says: *Xūyán* is the name of the northwest gate of the Jade Perfection. When the great kalpas intersect, it opens at *Xūyán*, and the Jade Perfected and Upper Sages return. *Míngshǒu* is the title of the capital’s warden under the Original Beginning. When the Original Beginning initiates the kalpa, the warden opens the Dao and begins the Brahma practices, and the various qi suddenly become radiant. *Fǎlǎn Lìkǒu Tán*.\n\n**Lín**\n*Gēngchén*",

Therefore, the ancients said: \"The word 'goodness' is most capable of accomplishing all practices.\"",

      "translated_text": "After the adept receives the embryo, the spirit conceals itself within the kidneys—this is called the *Kun* Palace. It is termed *nature*, and called *lead*; the mechanism of transformation returns to the Central Palace. This mechanism is the yang qi of daily arising and generation. As the foundation of the elixir and the ancestor of medicine, it is called *primordial essence*; gathering and refining cinnabar and mercury, it forms the substance of the elixir.\n\nNow, in the workings of creation, existence arises from the primordial, and so *Kun* is established through *Qian*, while *Qian* is completed through *Kun*. *Qian* and *Kun* mutually generate and complete one another, with no before or after. As Yi Chuan said: \"Creation has no beginning; yin and yang have no origin.\" It is like the principle by which lead arises from silver, and silver is completed by lead.\n\nAccording to the *Daoist Scriptures*: \"These two emerge as one with different names.\" Why then do the ancient perfected and supreme sages, in elucidating the principles of things and clarifying the workings of creation, forcibly employ lead, silver, cinnabar, and mercury as metaphors for the elixir’s mysteries? It is simply to make it easier for later generations to understand.\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: The *Kun* Mother is the Great Yin’s capital, the Ninefold Spirit Mother. She governs the abyss of the Eastern Sea’s Fusang and Yang Valley, ever controlling the earth’s mechanism, turning the wheel of primordial qi, and corresponding above to the Celestial Pass. When the Celestial Pass turns and the earth’s mechanism moves, the heavens complete one revolution, and the waters surge forth in thirty-three hundred degrees. When the qi of heaven and earth intermingle, the nine seas merge into one, and the waters fill the sky.\n\nThe *east* refers to the Eastern Sea, the meeting point and controlling source of the river’s origin. *Covering* means the Water Spirit governs Kunlun Mountain, filling and securing the vast sea, blocking the Eastern Well—thus the earth’s mechanism does not leak, and the kalpa’s long preservation is ensured. Its form gathers the Upper Mystery.\n\n*Tun* (屯)\n*Jiazi* (甲子): The Winter Solstice node, corresponding to the *Fu* hexagram, the new moon, and the hour of *zi*. The yang qi’s wondrous workings arise from the *Kun* Palace as the first yang returns. The ancient scriptures say: \"The yang qi’s black emanation arises from *Kun*; the sundial points to the southern pole, the five stars align in a string, and the sun and moon form a jade bi.\" It also says: \"When the metal essence undergoes its first transformation, the Azure Dragon receives the talisman, and the yang line is the pool.\" True yang ascends like the image of the sun. Upon reaching the Central Palace, the Metal Mother gathers and refines it—this is called *cinnabar*. *Cinnabar* is wood; wood is the dragon. This is the Azure Dragon receiving the talisman.\n\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Gathering form* refers to the time of calamitous conjunction, when the *Kun* Mother’s form emerges above the Eastern River, summoning the Bird Mother with a phoenix chariot to welcome the adept ascending to the wastes of Kunlun. The Bird Mother is the spirit overseeing water. *Above* means the *Kun* Mother ascends to the Celestial Lord to report the kalpa’s appointed time, delivering the adept and inscribing their name in the Dark Capital.\n\n*Tuoluo Yumiao* (陀罗育邈)\n*Yichou* (乙丑)\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Tuo* is the inner name of the Celestial Emperor, born together with the Miao Cheng Heaven on the Cloud Ridge. *Luo* is the name of the moon at its first appearance. *Tuo* dwells above the Cloud Ridge, embracing the moon to illuminate it. *Yu* is the name of the Divine King, who governs the ten directions and the flying gods of heaven. *Miao* is the name of the celestial overseer of the Feathered Forest. The Divine King constantly commands the guardians of the Three Realms, reviewing the registers of human life and death, and ordering the demon kings to protect and deliver those who attain the Dao.\n\n*Miao qi* merges with the clouds.\n\n*Xu* (需)\n*Bingyin* (丙寅): The month of *jianchou*, the Lesser Cold node.\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Miao qi* refers to the adept, having been delivered and protected, ascending to the Feathered Forest overseer to receive the talisman and ascend to heaven, traveling the subtle qi of the clouds. *Merging* means merging with the luminous essence. Once entering the Feathered Forest, they weave cloud qi into garments and then ascend together with the heavens, merging with the luminous essence.\n\n*The Great Ugly of Flying Heaven* (飞天大丑)\n*Dingmao* (丁卯)\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Flying Heaven* refers to the flying mystery of qi, forming the scripture of the Cavernous Void. The Flying Heaven Divine King constantly recites it to receive the adept. *Great* refers to the Three Realms’ comprehensive register, governing the charts of life and death. *Ugly* means elder. He is the great demon of the Three Realms, serving the Great Ugly. If the adept recognizes the sound of the eight characters, the demon kings protect their authenticity, and their body ascends to the Three Clarities.\n\n*Overseeing the heavens above*.\n\n*Shi* (师)\n*Wuchen* (戊辰): The Greater Cold node, corresponding to the *Lin* hexagram, and the hour of *chou*.\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Overseeing* refers to the official who governs the Flying Heavens, constantly gathering the qi of the eight assemblies to preserve the heavens’ and earth’s movements, supervising the officials of the long night, and delivering the souls of the dark. If one knows the sounds of heaven, the celestial demons arrange their words, the Great Ugly records the immortal ranks, and they ascend to the Forbidden Upper Heavens.\n\n*The Kalpa Measure of Shatuo* (沙陀劫量)\n*Jisi* (己巳)\nThe *Old Commentary* states: *Sha* refers to the Purple Tenuity’s separate palace, the Shalan Palace within the Constant Fusion Heaven. *Tuo* refers to the multitudes of Tuoqiu, numbering in the hundreds of millions, all newly delivered and attaining the Dao, their merits incomplete, dwelling scattered within the palace. *Kalpa Measure* means that with each transition of the kalpa’s movement, the multitudes of Tuoqiu have their merits and virtues assessed, ascending to the Vermilion Mound Palace to receive blessings and become immortals.\n\n*The Radiant Brilliance of Longhan* (龙汉瑛鲜)\n*Xiaoxu* (小畜)\n*Gengwu* (庚午)",

      "translated_text": "The Daoist regulations have their decrees, and none dare disobey the mandate. When taking up the brush, the spirit soars to the Great Empyrean, refining both essence and coarse matter to the utmost of one’s heart and thought.\n\nOnce the August Way is made manifest, the myriad heavens rejoice in celebration. Those who treasure it receive the descent of Perfected Ones; those who cultivate it attain promotion in rank. Its majestic numen is vast and boundless, defying all description.\n\nThe above sixty-four characters constitute the *True Writ of the Eight Heavens of the North*.\n\nThe Dao declares: These are the great Brahmā’s hidden words and the boundless sounds within the heavens. The hidden words are the names of the Heavenly Thearchs, concealed and not revealed. The boundless sounds are the *True Cavern Chapters*, whose natural resonance pervades all heavens.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The great Brahmā’s hidden words and boundless sounds are formed from the spontaneous coagulation of wondrous qi. All the principles of Heaven and Earth reside within them. Void and solid interpenetrate, images and numbers become visible. When guided by the nine days to deduce the Qian hexagram, no principle remains unilluminated.\n\nThat Qian begins in the north signifies yang’s birth at *zi*. *Jiazi* is paired with Qian, and *zi* corresponds to the Yellow Bell, hence *jiazi* commences at the winter solstice. The *Han Records* state: Fu Xi’s composition of the *Yijing* marked the inception of yang qi, establishing it as the standard for pitch. The day of the winter solstice is governed by the Yellow Bell, the origin of sound and qi.\n\nThe *Collected Essentials of the Imperial Dynasty* states: In antiquity, the Yellow Bell was the root of all affairs. From this perspective, the nine days guiding the Qian position mark the beginning of Brahmā qi and the inception of *jiazi*. As this qi spreads, the myriad beings are equally nourished. The four seasons and their transformations—how could they lie outside the Way of this hidden-qi language? Creation itself operates thus.\n\nThe elixir of return follows the body’s cultivation of the great Brahmā. Within its hidden words are contained the Four Symbols, Five Phases, Three Origins, Eight Trigrams, sun and moon, dragon and tiger, cinnabar and mercury, lead and silver—all culminating in the *Yin Talisman*. Fire times, gentle nurturing, extraction, and replenishment depend on the hexagrams’ qi ascending and descending, the cyclical flow of *jiazi*. Without these, one gropes in vain for a standard.\n\nThus, the four hexagrams Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li represent Heaven, Earth, sun, and moon, encompassing the myriad things as the crucible, vessel, medicine, and pivot of the root. The remaining sixty hexagrams correspond to the *jiazi* cycle, aligning with the seasons, shifting through cold and heat, dividing into the twenty-four qi, and subdividing into the seventy-two seasonal markers. The nodes of the twelve months are condensed into a single month; the markers of a month are embedded within the twelve hours of a day and night. One fixes the water clock, corrects the sundial, clarifies *zi* and *wu*, regulates yin and yang, harmonizes darkness and dawn, unites dragon and tiger, follows the great reckoning of Heaven and Earth, and accords with the transformative mechanism of yin and yang.\n\nThus, the hexagrams comprise three hundred eighty-four lines, and each line contains three hundred eighty-four *zhu*. Thereby, the myriad transformations arise from the void. Is it the void that gives birth to me, or I who give birth to the void? The principle of the great Brahmā—how vast is its Way!\n\nThe ancient script was a full *zhang* in length. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign of old inscribed its text to establish the correct pronunciation. The original hidden words, each character a *zhang* wide, bore eight-pointed rays. During the Dragon Han era, the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign transcribed and annotated them.\n\nThose who know their sounds and can fast and recite them will have the flying Heavenly Deva-Kings descend to observe their person, record their merit and diligence, and report to the heavens. The myriad spirits will pay homage, earth deities will attend at the gate, and the Great Merit Demon-Kings will sponsor their promotion. Once the Dao of the Upper Immortals is complete, they may roam the Three Realms and ascend through the Golden Gate.\n\nThis sound repels all, dispels all, delivers all, and accomplishes all—it is the natural sound of the Heavenly Perfected Ones.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: This boundless sound can repel and expel all demonic spirits, dissolve and avert all calamities, deliver and liberate all from birth and death, and bring to fruition all heavenly and human endeavors. Thus, it is called the *Heavenly Perfected Numinous Writ* and the *Natural Jade Characters*.\n\nAs for the Way of the Golden Elixir, it is the great Brahmā’s spontaneous primordial essence and wondrous qi, uniting with the void and merging with non-being. Those who cultivate it are observed by the myriad heavens, silently aided by the ten thousand spirits. When merit is complete and the Dao perfected, they will surely attain immortality.\n\nThe term *elixir* denotes union with the void and merging with non-being—it is fundamentally without form or substance. Those who speak falsely claim it is as large as a pellet and red as a tangerine—how utterly mistaken! They know not what the Golden Elixir truly is.\n\nTo say it is neither existent nor non-existent is also incorrect; to say it is sometimes existent and sometimes non-existent is likewise wrong; to say it is neither existent nor non-existent is still amiss. Yet if this is so, what then is it?\n\nThe Golden Elixir lodges in things to reveal its substance yet adorns things without form.\n\nWhat does it mean to *lodge in things to reveal its substance*? Thus, the *Scripture of Purity* states: The Great Dao is formless yet gives birth to Heaven and Earth—though the Dao is formless, Heaven and Earth reveal its form. The Great Dao is passionless yet moves the sun and moon—though the Dao is passionless, the sun and moon reveal its passion. The Great Dao is nameless yet nurtures the myriad things—though the Dao is nameless, the myriad things reveal its name.\n\nWhat does it mean to *adorn things without form*? Inwardly observe the heart: the heart has no heart—it is unattached. Thus, outwardly observe form: form has no form—it is not possessed. Thus, distantly observe things: things have no things—they are unimpeded. Thus, when this void is seen, the elixir’s Way unites with the void and merges with non-being, leaving no residue.\n\nAll arises from the body’s natural spontaneity, not through forced action. Hence, the great Brahmā’s hidden words are called the natural sound of the Heavenly Perfected Ones. Therefore, they can repel all, dispel all, deliver all, and accomplish all.\n\nIn harmony with the *Great Change*, aligned with *jiazi*, they complete creation and unite with the Golden Elixir.\n\n*Repels all* means eternal separation from all existence.\n*Dispels all* means illumination and function are all empty.\n*Delivers all* means transcending birth and death.",

      "translated_text": "*Accomplishes all* means the creation of Heaven and Earth. To speak briefly of the great is sufficient, for the small may then be inferred.\n\nThus, when one recites it, the flying immortals descend to observe below, the Celestial Emperor sings from afar, the myriad spirits pay homage, the Three Realms attend in reverence, the host of demons bow their heads, and ghostly essences vanish of themselves. The jade tablets and golden script resound—hence \"jewel-like tones.\" The recitation and chanting of the pivotal verses—hence \"vibrant resonance.\" The ten directions grow solemn and pure, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks swallow the mist, the ten thousand spirits tremble in submission, and the assembly of immortals is summoned.\n\nWhen this is recited, the jade groves shake with celestial music, the ten directions bask in the radiance of the Three Luminaries, rivers and seas still their winds and waves, mountains and peaks inhale the clouds and mist, the ten thousand spirits are subdued in awe, and the host of immortals gathers at one’s chamber.\n\nHeaven is free of defiling vapors, Earth is free of demonic dust. Heaven is without the qi of defilement; Earth is without the calamity of demonic dust.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: When merit is complete and conduct perfected, when the Dao is achieved and virtue established, one ascends to observe the records of merit below. The Celestial Emperor sings from afar in praise. The myriad spirits pay homage in reverence. The Three Realms attend as guardians. The host of demons bow their heads, and demonic thieves submit. Ghostly essences perish of themselves, and corpse-worms are extinguished. The jewel-like tones resound—this is spontaneous resonance. The ten directions grow solemn and pure—utterly unadulterated. Rivers and seas fall silent—nature and emotion merge in darkness. Mountains and peaks swallow the mist—spirit and breath settle into stillness. The ten thousand spirits tremble in submission—the multitude of sages stand in awe. The assembly of immortals is summoned—none but the true are gathered. Heaven is free of defiling vapors—yang is without transgression. Earth is free of demonic dust—yin is without concealment. Dark wisdom illumines the pure—vast and profoundly mysterious.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: This reveals the inner sound of the heavens, the power of dark penetration and luminous insight. *Dark* means profound and unfathomable; *wisdom* means illumination without limit. Wisdom can illuminate the void—hence \"dark wisdom.\" Lofty without end is called *illuminating*; radiant throughout the Three Clarities is called *pure*. *Illuminating* is emptiness; *pure* is stillness. Boundless and limitless is called *vast capacity*. Within this vast capacity, only true emptiness exists. Within the true lies essence; within essence lies sincerity. It can generate true sages, neither existing nor non-existing, eternally serene and subtle beyond measure. To exhaust its principle is impossible. Within the mysterious lies yet deeper mystery—hence \"profoundly mysterious.\"\n\nThe Most High, in compassion for the lower realms, bestowed this true scripture, arranging it in mysterious statutes to open the way for beings and deliver creatures. Those who recite and chant it move the heavens above, who revere and embrace its sacred text. As their qi reaches its destination, merit is perfected and conduct fulfilled, and they ascend as ministers of the Golden Towers. Thus, through accumulated study, one penetrates the true and enters sagehood, born in Heaven or born on Earth, with limitless application. Those who know the sound of the jade script will one day ascend with flesh and bone together. Scholars of the highest learning, strive diligently.\n\nAt the beginning of the Heavenly Worthy’s discourse, creation is spoken of at the outset; at the end, the Great Brahmā is spoken of in conclusion. This is how its essence and function cycle endlessly. Fearing that learners may not awaken to the principle of constant purity and stillness, falling into the views of clinging to existence or non-existence, the scripture clearly proclaims: *Dark wisdom illumines the pure, vast and profoundly mysterious.*\n\n*Dark* means uniting with the void and merging with non-being; *wisdom* means perfect clarity and wondrous insight; *illuminating* means penetrating without obstruction; *pure* means limpid and formless. *Vast capacity* means all-embracing and beyond measure; *profoundly mysterious* means wondrous within the wondrous, beyond conception.\n\nThus, when speaking of dragon and tiger, one does not stagnate in manipulating essence and spirit; when discussing nature and destiny, one does not lean toward clinging to emptiness and quiescence. The ten directions are thoroughly permeated, and all eight sides are transparent. As the scripture says: *Use its light, return to its clarity*—this is the meaning.\n\nThe Dao’s relation to humanity is no less than a loving mother’s care for her infant: it shelters and sustains, gives life and nurtures. Even to the point of dividing its body and descending into the world, it establishes the warp and weft, orders ruler and subject, rectifies high and low, provides sustenance in life and burial in death. For those who stand out from the multitude, it remains with them from beginning to end. As for those who follow the world with flowery eyes, fear death, and seek immortality, it perfects them according to their learning and merit. Not a single good deed is overlooked—this may be called the ultimate.\n\nIf people could embody the Dao, all would be like the people of Huai and Getian, without need for scriptures to emerge or teachings to be established. Yet because of their lack of benevolence, I have this scripture, and thus the teachings arise, and thus they are established. Hence, there are the retributions of Heaven and Hell—this is but a provisional means to encourage good and punish evil.\n\nSome say that with death, all ends—what else could there be? Heaven and Hell are both unreal. Such words may be penetrating, but what can be done about them? Now, after a person dies, they may appear in dreams, be seen, speak through others, or possess objects and manifest numinosity. From this, it cannot be said that with death, all ends—what else could there be? The pure caverns of spirit, the tranquil halls of the clear, the burial of white bones, the gloom of the watery prisons—these cannot be dismissed as unrealities of Heaven and Hell.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy says: *Before beings awaken, there are karmic conditions; once beings awaken, where are the karmic conditions? Heaven and Hell—who is not a temporary convergence? These are all created by the human mind. How can one sweepingly deny cause and effect?*\n\nThe Most High ever excels at saving, yet people do not love the Dao. Thus, the scripture admonishes the worldly, urging them not to misuse their minds, to return to their nature and darken their emotions, to abandon evil and follow good. At the highest, one may transcend the ordinary and enter sagehood; next, one may dissolve transformations and ascend to the true; next, one may withdraw and attain long life. Below, one may extend years in peace and joy, never losing human form across lifetimes, nurturing the root of nature until one also attains the immortal Dao. Compared to those afflicted by illness, bound by suffering, cut off in youth, endangered, dying unnaturally, or sinking into evil destinies—who gains and who loses? The discerning will surely choose wisely.",

      "translated_text": "The Celestial Qi’s Mysterious and Vast Heavenly Treasure: The Spontaneous Eightfold Harmonies\n*Lower Scroll of the Numinous Writ of Primordial Commencement*\nComposed by the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign\n\n**Postface Exegesis** states:\nAccording to careful examination, *The Wondrous Scripture of the Upper Chapters on Salvation through the Numinous Treasure* was bestowed upon Emperor Wu of Han during the Yuanfeng era by the descent of the Queen Mother of the West, marking the seventh transmission. Between transmissions, the lineage remained obscure, with only this single chapter surviving among the celestial scrolls’ vast ranks. By the Jin dynasty, the Immortal Duke of the Left Palace of the Great Ultimate in Shangyu of Kuaiji, moved by the revelation of the Perfected Xu Laile of the Great Ultimate, received *The Scripture of Salvation*, which included *The Lower Scroll of the Numinous Writ* and *The Postface of the Perfected of the Great Ultimate*. These were conferred upon the assembled immortals, gathering the texts of their final dispersal to form a complete corpus. Thereafter, due to the ravages of war and fire, Ge Hong of the *Baopuzi* received the transmission from the Perfected Zheng Siyuan, though it extended no further than the *Great Measure of the Mysterious Mysterious*. The Lower Scroll was lost, rendering it irrecoverable, and thus the world lacked the complete scripture, unattainable in its entirety.\n\nNow, as the propitious fortune flows and celestial officials descend, the missing text is appended to the scripture’s end. Those who recite and chant it attain the wondrous model of the original scripture’s two chapters and three scrolls; those who cultivate and apply it fulfill the full merit of the ten transgressions and ten directions. Through fasting and observance, one may ascend to the Upper Clarity.\n\n*The Scripture of the Five Teeth* states:\nThe Heavenly Perfected Sovereign’s origins in the Dao remain unknown, yet he was one who perfected the ultimate Dao through cultivation in a prior kalpa. His stature measured nine feet, his body covered in dark fur, each strand over a foot long. During the Yellow Emperor’s reign, he dwelled beneath the Absolute Yin of Mount Emei, his abode wrought of azure jade, his seat of yellow gold. Banners of patterned silk fluttered, and the fragrance of thousand-fold harmony burned. Attended by immortal youths and jade maidens, with three seated guests, all styled as Perfected Kings of the Great Clarity, the Yellow Emperor bowed twice to inquire of the Dao and was granted the texts of the *Five Teeth* and *Three Ones*.\n\n**Eastern Eight Heavens:**\nForest-dense clouds amass, nine souls refine essence.\n*Jimo* gazes through jade rings, floating plumes and pestles.\nDeer benches and willow chambers, azure vines coil and return.\nPool depths bear burdens, crawling creatures retreat and advance.\n*Zaozhang* transforms jade, orchid pools shatter jade.\nVast surges wild-born, utmost within Kun’s clarity.\nRadiance unfolds through cavernous drought, silence without the faintest congealment.\nWhite leans on the empty net, the august reaches the primordial numen.\n\n**Southern Eight Heavens:**\nFlaming forges in spacious halls, the Great Empyrean’s jasper corners.\nThrough distant tides, offerings ripple, encircling seals add diagrams.\nTraversing towering paths, *gudan* and *hundu* merge.\nHalberds of artemisia blaze, wells deceive with rushes.\nPalms maintain constricted rites, luminous brilliance cascades.\nCarved threads augment but, the subtle and minute complete thunder.\nTiny streams fill the east, crimson radiance thickens.\nJade mystery evolves lords, cypress jade attains the compass.\n\n**Western Eight Heavens:**\nRefined rectitude veers left, *Poni* slays the numinous.\nSorrow summons balanced borders, extending southward to entwine the *Kui*.\nTranquil Yi diminishes light, the Primordial Awakens to conditions.\nThe Dao guards distant peaks, silk’s征 knows proclamation.\nThe Great Numen submerges in desert, radiant harmony follows *Lusui*.\nWise capitals bloom eternally, ruins and sands harden.\nChestnut bells cast out stocks, assemblies extend to *Qiupei*.\nEminent clouds of the Azure Mansion, karma beholds *Banji*.\n\n**Northern Eight Heavens:**\nHollow children embrace sweetness, jade eaves of nine gates.\nReeds and hooks stir ripples, dragon’s *Fen* guards the numinous pass.\nDitches and abysses dissolve demons, vast barbarians pray for passage.\nMysterious desolation’s vast breath, the unknowing indulge in clarity.\nPythons cultivate auspicious evenings, fragrant altars mark the fields.\nHot springs spread prosperity, not mediocrity but reverent aid.\nMorning tranquility and sagely generosity, secret methods expand fittingly.\nThe Vast Emperor governs life, guards the grand inception of humanity.\n\n**Postface Exegesis** states:\nThis resembles the cryptic language of the Middle Scroll, lacking the Heavenly Perfected’s inner teachings found therein. Yet the Eastern character *sen* (森) derives from wood, the Southern *yan* (炎) from fire, the Western *hao* (镐) from metal, and the Northern *wa* (洼) from water and earth. Water and earth both flourish in the North, and the character *hai* (孩) combines *hai* (亥) and *zi* (子), surely relating to the wondrous principles of Heaven and Earth’s creation. Only those who attain the Dao may thoroughly comprehend these profound words.\n\nThe Heavenly Perfected Sovereign’s *Celestial Qi’s Mysterious and Vast Heavenly Treasure: The Spontaneous Eightfold Harmonies* governs the governance of worldly kalpas, earthly ramparts, vast marshes, calamities, and dire adversities. Those who recite it dispel demonic misfortunes, purify the Dao’s qi, and find all tranquility. Earth officials present the writ, the hundred spirits revere and respect it, divine vermilion transcribes the text, and wearing or bearing it yields evident efficacy. Applied to the utmost study, it is not proclaimed to the vulgar below.\n\n**The Perfected of the Great Ultimate’s Hymn** states:\nDivine clouds gleam in layered voids, the Brahma-net gathers in azure skies.\nPrimordial Commencement’s nine dragons draw the chariot, the Sovereign reins the azure carriage.\nNuminous light gathers the myriad Perfected, pearl shadows open the sun’s desolation.\nRevealing the Numinous Treasure’s scroll, blessings and virtue thereby summoned.\nThe Cavernous Mystery conceals lofty solemnity, jade tones ripple like cloud-borne zithers.\nThe Immeasurable defies contemplation, the Dao’s ocean births waves and billows.\nDharma principles flow like rivulets, nurturing and cultivating fine sprouts.\nApplied to relieve the destitute and hungry, the teaching flourishes to guard the central court.\nThe Emperor’s honor endures for myriad years, Great Peace abolishes blades of war.\nBowing heads toward the Jade Dawn, numinous blossoms scatter golden rays.\n\n**The Perfected of the Great Ultimate** states:\nThe Most High Lord of the Jade Dawn and Great Dao resides above the Purple Mist in the Sevenfold Radiance of Heaven, recording the mysterious writ. Jade consorts bear the scripture, golden youths scatter incense, the Great One holds the towel, jade lads attend the banquet. Dragons chant and tigers roar, auspicious clouds shroud in mist. The ten directions’ Perfected Celestial Deities, exalted sages, Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, boundless flying heavenly kings, great demons of the three realms, elders of the nine heavens, and innumerable hosts chant the Jade Scripture, taking refuge in the Most High Numinous Treasure’s wondrous Dharma. As propitious fortune flows, it endures for kalpas uncounted.\n\nUpon completing ten recitations of the scripture, knock the teeth thirty-six times, bow in the heart to the ten directions, rise, face south to descend the seat, and stand facing east. Bow three times in the heart and secretly intone:\nYour servant has completed the scripture’s recitation. The thirty-five merit officials of the body’s emanations, the attendants of the left and right, the incense-bearing golden youths, the message-transmitting jade maidens, the five emperors’ direct talismans, and the incense officials of the appointed days—thirty-two each—are entreated to return into your servant’s body and resume their places within the palace chambers, without error or confusion.",
