This work gathers essential discourses on elixir refinement from over thirty Tang and Song masters, preserving many lost ancient alchemical formulas. One scroll.\n*Source of Base Text:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n**Preface to *The Assembly of Immortals on the Cyclically Transformed Elixir***\nBy Yang Zai, the Recluse of Baofu Mountain\n\nThe cyclically transformed elixir begins with the Flowery Pond. Within the Flowery Pond, divine water is born. Pure and numinous above and below, it is serene, luminous, and still. As the divine water transforms, it becomes as white as frost, called the White Metal and Yellow Sprout. Next, the essence of the Three Yangs is introduced, boiled with water and refined with fire. After nine revolutions, it becomes a purple powder, called the Purple River Chariot. Mercury is then added to the River Chariot, undergoing another nine revolutions to produce true gold, called the Golden Duke. When the Golden Duke unites with mercury, metal and water meet, refined through nine further revolutions to form the cyclically transformed elixir. Those who ingest it attain longevity; the aged revert to youth; illnesses vanish of themselves; the mortal becomes immortal—naturally undying.\n\nThe cyclically transformed elixir requires direct oral transmission of the secret formulas to recognize lead and mercury. Lead is true lead; mercury is true mercury. Lead is not black tin; mercury is not liquid silver. Lead is the essence of lead; mercury is cinnabar mercury. When lead and mercury unite, the Yellow Sprout is born. The Yellow Sprout is the ancestor of the cyclically transformed elixir and the foundation of the great medicine. The *kan* trigram’s lunar lead conceals the true tiger; the *li* trigram’s solar mercury conceals the true dragon. When dragon and tiger meet, *wu* and *ji* form of themselves. The *kan* water generates metal; the *li* fire generates wood. Naturally, the four images are complete, and the five phases are unblemished.\n\nThe cyclically transformed elixir is metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Metal is the tiger; wood is the dragon; fire is the Vermilion Bird; water is the Dark Warrior; earth is the convergence of the four images. It does not employ worldly gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, tin, salt, alkali, ashes, or frost. The cyclically transformed elixir is lead and mercury. Lead, receiving water, has no fixed form; mercury, receiving fire, attains numinosity. From nonbeing, being arises: true lead is transformed by water, and true mercury is formed by fire.\n\nAs for true lead and true mercury, the divine water of the Flowery Pond, the Azure Dragon and White Tiger, the Yellow Sprout and White Snow, the River Chariot and the divine chamber—since ancient times, these cannot be understood without oral transmission. I am a man of Xihe in Fenyang. From my youth, I loved the Dao. After more than thirty years, I met an enlightened master and received oral transmission of the secret formulas. Only then did I comprehend the principles of the elixir scriptures, penetrate the profound and subtle texts, witness the truth of creation, and grasp the marvels of ascent and descent. On the eighth day of the eleventh month in the fourth year of the Huangyou era of the Song, I had leisure to compile essential passages from various elixir scriptures into one scroll, entitled *The Assembly of Immortals on the Cyclically Transformed Elixir*, in the hope that it may await those of like aspiration.\n\n---\n\n**The Assembly of Immortals on the Cyclically Transformed Elixir**\n\nThe Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning said:\nIn the profound and obscure, the pure and still Dao;\nIn the dim and silent, the ancestral void of Great Emptiness.\nThe nature and essence are serene, abiding in nothingness;\nThe physical form is utterly quiescent, one with true emptiness.\n\nHe also said:\nBefore the separation of the undifferentiated chaos, the true unity was contained within.\nOnce the true unity divided, the clear and dark became heaven, the turbid and dark became earth.\nThe darkness of the true unity ascends and descends, inhaling and exhaling without cease.\nFrom the darkness, essence is born: the essence and *qi* of heaven are the sun, moon, and stars; the essence and *qi* of earth are lead and mercury.\nLead is the lunar essence; mercury is the solar soul.\n\nThe Lord of the Dao said:\nThe solar soul and lunar essence are the marrow of the cyclically transformed elixir.\nObtaining the yin darkness, it becomes the White Sprout and cinnabar;\nObtaining the yang darkness, it becomes golden cinnabar.\nWhen golden cinnabar enters the five viscera, it disperses like mist and rain, permeating the four limbs.\n\nLord Lao said:\nThe external elixir arises amid the divine water’s inquiry;\nThe internal elixir arises amid the dharma water’s juncture.\n\nHe also said:\nRed lead and black lead are the head of the great elixir.\nRed lead entering black is true gold.\nExtracting the essence from red lead and the marrow from black,\nWhen skillfully employed, the red-black medicine is unparalleled.\nUsing red to enter black ensures longevity;\nUsing black to enter red makes one a celestial immortal.\nBoth red and black are called the cyclically transformed;\nBlack can transform, but red takes precedence.\nBy the side of Liang Mountain near the Hangu Pass,\nLord Lao carved these words into stone.\n\nShennong said:\nCinnabar and mercury are the essence and *qi* of the sun and moon.\nWhen in the sun, it is called radiant cinnabar—\nThe essence of the Great Yang.\nWhen in the moon, it is mercury—\nThe essence of the Great Yin.\n\n*The Yellow Emperor’s Scripture of the Nine Cauldrons* said:\nLead does not travel alone; if it moves, it must have a companion.\nWhen carefully employed, lead and mercury share a single origin,\nAble to generate golden blossoms, called the beautiful golden blossom.\n\nThe Supreme Sovereign said:\nThe plain and light are despised by the world;\nThe flowery and granular are prized by the world.\n*Geng* and *xin* in equal measure,\nMelted and fused together.\nThe emergent male and female medicines,\nRefined in the upper nest.\nHard and soft as one body,\nNothing compares to this truth.\n\nLord Mao marveled and said:\nWithin yin there is yang; within yang there is yin.\nCold and heat oppose each other; the tiger roars and the dragon sings.\nAzure, black, red, and white each reside in their own direction.\nIf they are misaligned, the guiding principle is lost.\nYang acts as minister; yin becomes sovereign.\nAttend to the subtle shifts, and the heavenly Dao will naturally flourish.\n\nHe also said:\nWithin the cyclical there is no elixir; within the elixir there is cyclical return.\nWithout lead, the elixir cannot form;\nThe cyclically transformed elixir is born from lead.\n\nHe also said:\nWhite Snow Powder, Golden Sprout—\nWithout mastery, do not boast idly.\nPeople of this age do not recognize the true Yellow Sprout,\nKnowing only to identify lead’s yellow blossom.\nThe blossom is but a dead thing;\nHow can it lead one to the immortal’s realm?\n\nThe Divine Chamber marveled and said:\nHeaven and earth are mysterious and yellow;\nLead and white form the frame.\nThe divine chamber above and below\nDoes not depart from its original text.\nExamine the harmony of six and one,\nProceeding in unison with the above.\nWhen empty, it becomes a thief;\nWhen full, it defends itself.\n\nThe Three Terraces and Five Peaks follow the strongest path of refinement.\nThose who awaken attain it; those who lose it fall into madness.\n\nLongshu commented:\nThirty catties of yellow dragon and black essence,\nWhen fired without flight, are most divine.\nThe furnace’s base is small, its mouth two fen wide,\nAbove opens a starry path to the Celestial Ford.\n\nThus, the White Tiger serves as the brain,\nThe Yellow Sprout as the root.\nAfter one cycle of cultivation,\nIt yields yellow silver.\n\nMaster Yin Zhen said:\nWhen Gold Flower is thrice refined and nine times tempered,\nIt is called Old Yin—cast it into a crucible.\nIf a practitioner completes this crucible,\nThe cinnabar clouds and azure skies are not hard to reach.\n\nHe also said:\nTo obtain the Yellow Sprout, first ignite lead.\nIf Ren does not flee in the fire,\nHow can Gui form a union?\nThe hen incubates her eggs until the days are full;\nWhen the cicada matures, its shell parts naturally.\n\n*The Golden Tiger Formula of Ma Mingsheng* states:\nBlack lead transforms into the Yellow Sprout,\nWithin it, the number nine repeated ninefold.\nIts changes are but three kinds;\nWhen refined to the Purple Yang Palace,\nGold has no place to rest.\n\n*The Golden and Azure Disquisition on Doubts* says:\nWhen mercury obtains the Gold Flower,\nTheir forms become akin—\nDragon and Tiger unite,\nThus forming the cyclically transformed elixir.\nWhen Gold Flower obtains gold and silver,\nTheir forms become supreme treasures.\nThese two matters cannot be heard of lightly.\nIf one speaks of Gold Flower, it is but the Yellow Sprout.\n\n*The Hundred Questions Treatise* states:\nA true person forms gold and silver with medicine—\nMust one seek cinnabar as the mother?\nIf one must create golden treasure,\nWhat harm is there in having the mother?\nDead mother is true silver;\nBefore returning to the mother’s body,\nHow can this not be principle?\nApart from the Yellow Sprout as supreme medicine,\nOther medicines are difficult to subdue.\nThere is no false mercury,\nNo true asafoetida.\nNo other substances enter the Yellow Sprout’s body—\nMercury, moved by the essence of the Five Phases,\nReceives the qi of true yang.\nWhen the year’s elixir is complete,\nThe bones stand firm and the spirit is whole.\nIf mercury is thus subdued,\nHow can one not become immortal?\nIf there are杂 impurities,\nIt cannot be accomplished.\n\n*The Heart Mirror of Cyclically Transformed Elixir* says:\nLead contains the five colors,\nMercury emits the three flowers.\nWhen the two unite as one body,\nIt is called the River Chariot.\nThe world is deluded by it,\nExhausting their wealth and families.\nThose who attain the formula\nMay tread the clouds and mist.\n\nIt also says:\nMercury has the flaw of sinking at the waist;\nIt must obtain the essence of true lead.\nIf one does not recognize the essence of true lead,\nAfter kalpas of refinement,\nOne will ultimately achieve nothing.\n\nMaster Yuanyang annotated:\nIf white gold is to be subdued by fire,\nThe resonance lies within a foot’s distance—\nIt must be an oral formula,\nDifficult to transmit in writing.\n\n*Wei Boyang’s Five Categories* states:\nThe cyclically transformed elixir fundamentally relies on lead as its root.\nWhen the root is formed, the sprout grows;\nWhen the sprout grows, mercury is subdued;\nWhen mercury is subdued, the elixir is complete—\nIt is not an external thing.\nThose who cultivate the elixir\nMust not use worldly gold and silver.\n\n*The Secret Record of the Golden Elixir* says:\nSimply use nine-times-refined lead essence as the divine chamber,\nWithin which nurture the golden water,\nTemporarily borrowing the power of lead’s qi.\n\nHu Gangzi said:\nAll immortals do not speak of this one ingredient.\nWithout transformation,\nIt is not truly complete.\nLike nine-times-refined lead essence subdued by fire,\nIf one has not obtained it for consumption,\nEating it would cause immediate death.\n\n*The Master Who Embraces Simplicity* writes:\nWhen divine immortals create gold,\nThey do so to consume it themselves,\nNot for the sake of wealth and nobility.\nDivine immortals’ silver may also be consumed—\nIt is not counterfeit.\n\n*The Treatise on the Kinship of the Three* states:\nThe golden elixir cannot be formed with many medicines;\nAfter ten thousand refinements, it still cannot be subdued by fire.\n\nThe Classic says:\nCinnabar can be made into gold,\nThe River Chariot can be made into silver.\nSilver is instantly formed,\nAnd when formed, it is true.\nAttaining this Dao,\nOne may become an immortal.\n\n*The Secret Record of the Golden Elixir* says:\nLead’s nature is white but inwardly red;\nCinnabar’s nature is red but inwardly white.\nThey become watery clouds and frost-like snow—\nAll are the qi of heaven and earth.\nWhen made with medicine,\nThey are no different from the real.\n\n*The Three Envoys Formula of the Great One* states:\nWithin lead there is a child—\nNo need for the three yellows.\nFire is the same as this;\nMoreover, it creates the Yellow Sprout.\nWithin the sprout there is a child—\nNo need for the mother’s obstruction.\nWithin the child, the mother transforms;\nChild and mother are thus the same.\nThe world calls it the Gushing Spring Repository—\nThis method is not falsely transmitted.\nRemember the three yellows,\nBut do not speak of the one black.\n\nRihua Zi said:\nYellow lead subdues black lead,\nWhite mercury is sagely and profound.\nThe western marsh meets the southeast,\nThe eastern palace’s matron is wise.\nThey marry following the sun and moon,\nTransforming the Dao to verify immortality.\nAfter nine refinements, the elixir’s radiance shines,\nAnd one lives long without counting the years.\n\nHe also said:\nSpiritual lead is the lord of mercury,\nSpiritual mercury is the minister of fire-lead.\nLead and true mercury—\nThese are the essentials of the yellow and white.\n\n*The Great One’s Elixir Book* says:\nTake eight ounces of true lead to make a vessel,\nCall it the divine chamber.\nCoat it with burned borax,\nAdd one catty of mercury,\nAnd refine it with water and fire—\nNo external repository is needed.\nThen, from the mutual subjugation of water and fire,\nThe Jade Smile Child is born,\nPossessing the five colors—\nIt is called Purple Tooth Cinnabar.\nIts forms have twenty-four kinds,\nBut only those resembling mounds and tombs are unfit—\nDiscard them in the eastern flowing waters.\n\n*The Divine Mercury Treatise of Hu Gangzi* says:\nRefine lead essence into yellow earth,\nUse the yellow earth to make a repository,\nWithin which nurture flying frost to form the elixir.\nEarth becomes the River Chariot,\nReady to be used as a cover or base.\nBefore the various elixirs are complete,\nThe River Chariot cannot be used—\nUsing it would be without merit.\n\n*Master Yin Zhen’s Five Categories* says:\nIf lead is used to gather flowers,\nLead loses its qi.\nIf it gathers essence,\nLead loses its bones.\nThe Yellow Sprout—\nThe Three Powers are complete,\nBone and flesh do not separate.\n\nA song says:\nMercury is a single ingredient without other things.\nFirst it is flesh, then it becomes bone.\nWhen bone and flesh follow one another, they endure forever;\nFrom this, the River Chariot has no end.\nLike a person giving birth to a son or daughter,\nThe parents remain clearly present—\nThis illustrates that the true gold’s original source remains.\n\nIf one fails to grasp the principles in this text, one will ultimately gain nothing.\n\n*The Scripture of the Flowery Pond* states:\nTo combine gold and silver is the fixed method.\nMastering the transformations of metals and minerals,\nSimply introduce the medicine into the Flowery Pond to subdue mercury,\nWhich dies at one’s touch—all within a single day.\nWhat difficulty could there be?\n\nYet examine the twelve Flowery Ponds:\nTheir rising, descending, advancing, and retreating—\nWith only the dissolving brine,\nOne can still subdue mercury.\nHow much more so with gold, silver,\nAnd the twelve hours?\n\nThe gold-fermented and silver-fermented River Chariot subdues mercury.\n\n*The Commentary on the Scripture of the Hidden Talisman* says:\nWithin true lead lies mercury, called the Tiger;\nMercury is known as dead mercury.\n\nAn ancient immortal said:\nTo make mercury die, first let mercury die.\nThus, dead mercury within lead becomes Earth.\n\nThe mercury within cinnabar is living mercury.\nIn refining the elixir, one must know the three mercuries acting in unison.\nWithout knowing the three mercuries,\nEven if one understands ten thousand methods,\nThere is no path to transcendence.\n\nOne must know the three mercuries—mercury, mercury, mercury.\n\n*Master Yin Zhen’s Exegesis on the Three Elixirs* says:\nBoiling and refining require no fixed number;\nWashing and steeping have no set method.\nEntering the crucible demands knowing the number,\nThe true words open the gate of fire.\nThe gate is distinguished by fire-timing;\nThe primordial qi is hard to discern.\nEmbryonic breathing governs the Flowery Pond,\nAnd the adept enters the gate of fire.\nIf no gate is missed or misapplied,\nOne returns to the body of embryonic breathing.\n\n*The Treatise on the Three Ways Unified* says:\nCinnabar first transforms into mercury,\nMercury second transforms into snow,\nThird into sand, fourth into earth,\nFifth into lead—lead is gold.\n\nThe scripture says:\nA single thing contains five hues,\nForever serving as the immortal’s bounty.\n\n*Master Yin Zhen’s Exegesis on the Three Elixirs* says:\nWithin cinnabar lies the immortal adept,\nWho harmonizes the red glow to turn it white,\nSubduing fire with yin without losing its original form.\nIts body also becomes white, called White Horse’s Tooth.\nUsed thus in the primordial four images,\nIt attains the undivided Water.\n\nIt also says:\nThe primordial qi resides entirely within the Purple Palace,\nWhere the divine-transforming elixir is nurtured.\nThis is like a person formed within the mother’s womb,\nUnconsciously growing over ten months into a complete being—no different.\n\nIf one masters the Purple Palace,\nOne already bears the title of immortal.\nThe Purple Palace has three forms:\nSome complete in a month, some in a day, some in a year—\nUsing mercury and sulfur to subdue fire.\n\nThe second is the Golden Crucible,\nWhere lead powder subdues fire over a year.\n\nWhere the original qi departs,\nFrom Wood fire is born,\nAnd fire returns to Wood—\nThis mirrors the Green.\nGreen is Water; Water meets Fire,\nAnd Fire, through the flourishing Green Wood,\nCondenses the qi into essence,\nResembling malachite.\n\nFirst harmonizing malachite,\nLike gathering the spring’s third month’s yang harmony and darkness,\nAnd moving through the pitch-pipes,\nOne can bring forth the arising of all things.\nIf malachite is harmonized in the elixir,\nIt is like the pitch-pipes of yin and yang—\nThe great creation of the original spirit’s three elixirs.\n\nThe formula says:\nThe primordial Five Phases’ ancestor is malachite on the day of Jia.\nMalachite is the essence of Wood,\nEssence becomes the agent, the agent becomes qi,\nQi becomes sinew—also called yang within yin.\nYang is the sun’s soul,\nThe soul is the sun’s essence,\nEssence is yang,\nYang is the father.\nThe father’s afterbirth transforms into white liquid,\nWhich hardens into white ice—\nThis is yang within yin.\nYang becomes bone;\nFrom qi, white liquid is born,\nAnd the white liquid naturally has four names.\n\nThe world does not realize malachite is fire\nAnd mistakenly uses malachite.\nFirst is Water;\nMercury is the qi of flesh,\nQi becomes blood,\nBlood transforms into hair,\nHair into skin and the body’s frame—\nBy the third month, form is known;\nBy the tenth month, birth occurs,\nWith two additional months for bathing.\n\n*The Three Palaces’ Lead-Controlling Formula* says:\nSimmer lead into cakes to make golden flowers,\nGather the cakes into the furnace to refine nine-times sand.\nGold and Water harmonize with level clam powder;\nMercury’s liquid and yellow pulp—\nThe path is not distant.\n\nOriginally, only mercury is the celestial Water;\nGold born in Lishui is the River Chariot.\nIf one plays with common lead, one misleads the world—\nWater and Earth support each other as one family.\n\nAnother *Yellow Sprout Song* says:\nSeeking immortality, seek the Yellow Sprout;\nOne must recognize the true lead flower.\nOnly what forms naturally\nCan become golden sand.\nIngesting one pill after repeated refinement,\nOne soars into the clouds and mist.\nBeyond the words of heaven and earth,\nEverywhere are immortal abodes.\n\nIt also says:\nThe natural Yellow Sprout blooms red flowers,\nWu and Ji transform into golden sand.\nBorn within the mysterious yellow and autumn stone,\nYet people do not awaken to seek the golden flower.\n\nIt also says:\nTo make mercury die, first let mercury die.\nIf mercury does not die first,\nHow can mercury die?\nMercury controls itself;\nSelf-control leads to spiritual communion.\nIf one uses various杂 substances,\nFrom beginning to end, nothing true is achieved.\n\nThe Green Dragon faces the White Tiger,\nThe Vermilion Bird connects with the Dark Warrior.\nThe four lie in separate directions,\nYet each contains and protects the others.\nFrom beginning to end, they are naturally close,\nNever failing to watch over one another.\nIf you obtain the Purple River Chariot,\nYou will ascend to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nIt also says:\nHeaven-born natural things,\nWho can fathom their spiritual workings?\nIf one can stabilize the three cinnabar fields,\nThey will gleam with the five colors.\nAt the sight of fire, ghosts vanish;\nMeeting Earth, they can reverse course.\nTrue fire is not necessarily red;\nTrue lead is not black.\nThough the world values gold and silver,\nTheir ultimate principle is hard to subdue.\nThe four yellows and eight stones,\nIn the end, lack sufficient qi.\nThough the Maiden is gentle and weak,\nTen thousand cannot obtain one.\nI possess the five spirits’ timing,\nTheir majestic radiance most wondrous.\n\nWater seeks to flow due east,\nBut I raise my sword to block the north.\nThe Green Dragon tries to flee,\nBut the Yellow Dog pounces on its head.\nDrinking qi, we become one family,\nSwallowing voices, not daring to weep.\nGradually turning to ash and dust,\nYin and yang alternately subdue each other.\nForming the Purple River Chariot,\nDrawing out the poison of yellow gold.\nIt can save the suffering of death and illness,\nRestoring youth and a jade-like complexion.\n\nEmbracing the One, maintain serene harmony,\nWith mind obscured, sever all cravings and desires.\nIngest but a single *dao-gui*,\nAnd colored clouds shall bear your feet aloft.\n\nIt is also said:\nTo use lead, one must blend it with mercury,\nTwo families unite as bride and groom sing.\nRefined to the Purple River Chariot, it shakes the earth,\nWhite clouds accompany as cranes pass by.\n\nIt is also said:\nGreen Dragon and White Tiger merge as an embryo,\nTen months of gestation, only then does it fully open.\nThis is the true oral formula of lead’s sprouts—\nWhere in the world can one seek the Three Powers?\n\nIt is also said:\nThe market brims with yellow sprouts, yet none find their home,\nThe world scorns them, reducing them to dust.\nThough nobles and ministers recognize the numinous medicine,\nGreed alone obscures and confounds them.\n\nMaster Yuanyang states:\nThe profound subtleties of the Five Phases are hard to know,\nDragon hides, Tiger conceals—within Kan and Li they dwell.\nThe arts of returning elixir number in the hundreds,\nYet the most wondrous requires the Golden Flower Pool.\n\nIt is also said:\nLead and mercury cannot be relied upon as one,\nThe secret of the Golden Elixir—even sages know it not.\nIf one uses mundane lead and mercury from the world,\nYear after year, with fire they contend in vain.\n\nIt is also said:\nTrue Yin and True Yang are the true Dao,\nYet they lie before your eyes—why seek them afar?\nThe common crowd year after year refines divine cinnabar,\nSometimes seeing blue and yellow, they deem it fine.\n\nIt is also said:\nThe nine-fold refined cinnabar marks desire’s end,\nOnly when the furnace opens does the elixir’s flower bloom red.\nTransformed by water and fire, all becomes earth—\nWhere then can one find the Golden Duke?\n\nMaster Peng marvels and says:\nBlack lead enters the crescent moon,\nAt the hour of Zi, it naturally disperses.\nAbove, it bears the green creek’s sand,\nBelow, golden flowers appear.\nRaised eastward, then rising west,\nComing and going, seizing the opportune moment.\nFor a long while, hands do not cease,\nBlack lead scatters the green sand.\nFierce fire roasts without pause,\nAs it circulates, it transforms into yellow flowers.\nGreen sand quenched into ceruse,\nYellow flowers become red lead.\nThough the world sees it all,\nNone grasp the difficulty it entails.\nA myriad refinements are not easily achieved,\nWhat one ingests must endure long peace.\n\nMaster Yin received the Green Elixir and marveled, saying:\nNüwa refined stone into five hues,\nSoaring to the Great Veil as a canopy of splendor.\nWithin the azure void, the yin wheel is born,\nSulfur and wood’s essence can pair.\nThe Human Sovereign refined silver to attain longevity,\nJoining Li with Zhen to complete the Five Phases.\nTwelve months traversing the nine-fold cycle,\nThe Golden Elixir is truly the essence of wood.\nThe Golden Elder’s two characters are the water of Kan,\nFlying into Gen’s palace, never to rise again.\nYin and yang form substance, naturally from the east,\nAll affairs must return to Wu and Ji.\nThe supreme Dao of heaven and earth must not be transmitted,\nGold and silver are my Green Elixir’s children.\nKnow well that the Most High is beyond thought,\nYin Xi received Nüwa’s record.\n\nThe *Song of the Golden Elixir* says:\nThough Dragon and Tiger bear two names,\nTheir root and origin arise from one center.\nIf one seeks the method of the Returning Elixir,\nSimply nurture metal’s essence with wood’s essence.\n\nIt is also said:\nThe wondrous principle of true emptiness is clear,\nHidden within lead, its name does not appear.\nDiscern the yellow sprout when it ought to emerge,\nAnd know the White Tiger is destined for long life.\n\nIt is also said:\nSilver serves as the outer frame, containing three things,\nGold acts as the embankment, receiving the Five Phases.\nBest is the secret of the Flower Pool’s divine water—\nYet people do not understand, and ten thousand fail to succeed.\n\nMaster Zhang the Celestial says:\nMountain stone gold and silver, hard in nature and hotly toxic,\nWhen made into liquid gold, are difficult to complete,\nLike glue or paste, unfit for ingestion,\nThey consume one’s marrow.\nBut if medicinal gold is made into liquid,\nIts path must flourish,\nYellow and red as water,\nIngested, it soars to the heavens.\n\nThe *Three Essays of the Pottery Altar* states:\nWhite gold, from the northern water’s midst,\nTransforms its form and substance.\nThrough forging and refining,\nIt is cultivated into the Great Elixir.\nThe water’s essence never ceases,\nThus it is said to dissolve into water.\n\nThe *Golden Casket Jade Book* states:\nIf it encounters divine water,\nBlack and white separate.\n\nThe *Golden and Azure Fire Mirror for Ingesting Medicine* states:\nZiming binds into the golden spirit’s coffer,\nAble to transform the body’s hue to azure and purple.\nThe twenty-eight constellations align with heaven’s heart—\nThis is true lead, capable of transmuting into water.\n\nMaster Zheng transmitted to Ge Zhichuan, saying:\nThere is a thing, there is a thing,\nIt can be great, it can endure.\nGathered before the silkworm’s feeding,\nUsed after the fire’s transformation.\nBearing broth from above to pour below,\nIt irrigates the empty cauldron, receiving all.\nSun and moon revolve,\nFive phases lie in wait.\nThe moth’s wind swiftly stirs,\nGolden juice does not flee.\nWater irrigates it,\nFrom being to non-being.\nFire burns it,\nFrom non-being to being.\nWhite powder accumulates like snow,\nYellow butter congeals into golden pairing.\nLifting and overturning, intent on blackness,\nReversing decay and decrepitude.\nIs it gold? Is it stone?\nHeaven’s years, earth’s longevity,\nEver turning without cease,\nSpirits hasten, ghosts gallop.\nNo attachment to words,\nThe secret lies in heart and mouth.\n\nThe *Secret Essentials of the Great Dao* states:\nThe Great White Star of Venus is the essence of metal.\nReceiving the moon’s po, containing the earth star’s qi,\nIts inner color is yellow—this is the Golden Flower.\nThe moon’s qi’s influence is po, po belongs to water,\nThus it obtains the qi of metal and water,\nCorresponding to the northern Chen star,\nAnd generates lead.\nThe Year Star is wood.\nThe sun’s hun, the essence of water’s blackness.\nIts hun is red fire.\nFire generates wood,\nCorresponding to the black of Mars,\nAnd generates cinnabar.\nCinnabar internally contains wood’s yin qi,\nThus it has mercury.\nMercury is called the Green Dragon,\nThe Green Dragon belongs to wood.\nThe Chen star is water.\nThe essence of water,\nTransmitting the qi of the Great White metal,\nFlowing essence corresponds to earth,\nAnd receiving the moon’s po, it generates lead.\nThus lead is born of the Golden Flower,\nThe Golden Flower has five colors,\nCalled the yellow sprout.\nThe qi of the water constellation descends upon wood,\nAnd generates malachite.\nThe Mars star is fire.\nThe essence of fire,\nObtaining the black of the wood star,\nAnd transmitting the sun’s hun,\nFlowing essence enters earth,\nAnd generates cinnabar.\nHun belongs to fire,\nBorn of wood,\nInternally containing yin, it generates mercury.\nFire generates earth,\nEarth contains true yang,\nGenerating realgar,\nIts flavor is sweet.\nThe Saturn star is earth.\nReceiving the qi of the fire and earth constellations,\nContaining true yang, it has realgar.\n\nThus do the Five Stars transmit and receive the essence of the sun and moon, circulating and generating one another, naturally aligning with the Dao. The sun’s true name is the Father of the Dao; the moon’s true name is the Mother of the Dao. Venus is called the White Tiger; Saturn is the Curved Array; Mercury is named the Dark Warrior; Jupiter corresponds to the Azure Dragon; Mars is the Vermilion Bird, its black essence flowing through the Five Stars.\n\nA poem says:\n*The Great Elixir must be the yellow sprout,*\n*Lead and mercury transmit from one house.*\n*Cultivation’s order clearly understood,*\n*Then naturally one attains the Golden Flower.*\n\nThe Golden Flower’s *gen* crucible follows the method,\nDiligently refine for me the yellow sprout.\nThis is the profound secret of the Great Mystery,\nAttained through cultivation, one rides the clouds and mist.\n\nMaster Mingdao, discoursing on the Flowery Pond, says:\n*Yin and yang alternate, birthing south and north,*\n*Lead-water and mercury-water emerge from lead.*\n*Comprehending these four wondrous principles,*\n*Only then does the Flowery Pond’s red and black intermingle.*\n\n*The Golden Mercury Formula* states:\n*Lead arises truly from within lead,*\n*Brought forth, it binds cinnabar’s flowing essence.*\n*The Golden Flower tames mercury, the pheasant subdues the sparrow,*\n*Transforming into the Reverted Elixir—a most extraordinary affair.*\n\n*The Water-Fire Diagram of the Golden Elixir* says:\n*To recognize cinnabar, test it with fire—*\n*Smokeless, deep purple, that is the Reverted Elixir.*\n*Worldly folk know not the true Dragon and Tiger,*\n*Mistaking the yellow sprout for two separate things.*\n\nMeng Can says:\n*Focus the mind to fathom the Mystery’s origin,*\n*Once awakened, profound mechanisms seem effortless.*\n*Before speaking of the Elixir’s return to the grotto,*\n*First discuss the divine transformations aiding the mortal realm.*\n*Fleeting life—abandon glory and rank,*\n*In this world, one must inquire of Creation’s workings.*\n*Attempting to tame Dragon and Tiger in vain,*\n*Alas, how time ages the countenance.*\n\nHe also says:\n*First bind lead and mercury into cinnabar,*\n*Nurturing them as one household.*\n*Not toward the ash pool for white liquid,*\n*How could strict red transform into the yellow sprout?*\n*The golden radiance shines brightly, worthy of cherishing,*\n*The jade medicine gleams, even more praiseworthy.*\n*Seal tightly, then re-enter the crucible,*\n*Lest yin’s darkness harm the essence.*\n\n*The Posthumous Formula of the Perfected Sovereign* states:\n*The Reverted Elixir has inner and outer methods,*\n*Each with its Three-in-One technique.*\n*The inner Three-in-One is the Elixir medicine,*\n*The outer Three-in-One serves as assistance.*\n\nThe Hermit of Changbai Mountain says:\n*Huainan refines autumn stone,*\n*The Yellow Emperor extols the Golden Flower.*\n*Autumn stone is not stone,*\n*The Golden Flower is not a flower.*\n*Flower refined within autumn,*\n*Stone blossoms in spring.*\n\nAnother formula says:\n*Autumn stone is true lead,*\n*The Golden Flower is the yellow sprout.*\n*The yellow sprout does not leave lead,*\n*From lead, its essence is drawn.*\n*Mother and child dwell together,*\n*As if in an immortal’s abode.*\n\n*The Hidden Canon of Jia* states:\n*These two substances use vessels yet do not,*\n*Use form yet do not.*\n*Only then is it mercury within mercury,*\n*Lead within lead—knowing this, there is no confusion.*\n\n*The Stone Wall Record of Sun the Perfected* says:\n*A thousand classics, ten thousand discourses speak no falsehood,*\n*Only that black gold lies before your eyes.*\n*Those who gather without following the proper directions,*\n*Complain that immortals refuse to transmit the Way.*\n*Gather lead’s essence, refine cinnabar,*\n*Within ten days, the River Chariot appears.*\n*The River Chariot is but black gold wrought,*\n*Quicksilver is the path of the Reverted Elixir.*\n*Without black gold and quicksilver,*\n*One wastes spirit and energy, aging in vain.*\n\n*The Stone Wall Record of Mount Hua*:\n*The Three Yang Sacred Stones vie in merit,*\n*Only Mysterious Essence is the great unifier.*\n*Refining the Great Yang exhausts its strength,*\n*Then naturally the Crone does not journey west.*\n\n*The Exegesis on the Three Elixirs by Lord Yin the Perfected* says:\n*Students of the immortal’s path, fortunate to encounter sacred teachings,*\n*If bestowed by Heaven, do not forget Heaven’s grace.*\n*If one betrays Heaven, Heaven will not long tolerate such evil.*\n*If gods and humans grant it, one must not betray them,*\n*But honor and serve them with reverence and offerings.*\n*If obtained from the Yangtze, Huai, or Ji rivers,*\n*One must not forget the dragon pools, water wombs, and the creatures born of moisture.*\n*If obtained from mountain forests or stone chambers,*\n*One must not forget the land spirits of those places,*\n*And must also honor them with offerings.*\n*If learned from a human teacher,*\n*One must not betray that teacher,*\n*But revere them as parents, serving with devotion.*\n*As long as the seeker’s heart does not stray from the Dao,*\n*They will move Heaven and Earth,*\n*All spirits and transformations will follow the path of goodness,*\n*Never falling into evil ways.*\n*The seeker’s heart must remain as it was at first.*\n*The one who transmits the Dao must not:*\n*First, betray Heaven’s grace;*\n*Second, deceive the principles of the gods;*\n*Third, fail their teacher.*\n*If one’s words, trust, conduct, and integrity are lacking,*\n*Even if they consume the medicine, they will surely die.*\n*Why? Without virtue, consuming the Golden Elixir rots the five viscera.*\n*Transmitting it to the unworthy brings calamity upon descendants.*\n\nIt also says:\n*August Heaven has no favorites,*\n*Yet transforms all through rectification.*\n*Humans have no root,*\n*But the Dharma-body’s four qi serve as their root.*\n*The root arises from the heart,*\n*The heart has no root,*\n*Yet takes my nine-times-cycled Divine Elixir as its root.*\n*Thus all methods find their root in the medicine.*\n\n*Master Lü’s Orthodox Yang Chapter* says:\n*The Crone dwells in the south,*\n*By her side, six yang are born.*\n*In the Toad Palace, jade liquid is brewed,*\n*At the Kan Gate, nectar is refined.*\n*Past immortals consumed it,*\n*Now it comes for me to taste.*\n*A single cup extends ten thousand ages,*\n*Beyond the world, the spirit soars.*\n\nHe also says:\n*Suddenly grasping the principle of the yellow sprout,*\n*Yin and yang are endowed by Nature.*\n*Within the Qian-Kun furnace, it is refined,*\n*In the sun-moon crucible, it is decocted.*\n*Wood yields the life-prolonging mercury,*\n*Metal stews the life-extending lead.*\n*Whoever understands this Dao,*\n*Instantly reverts to youthful countenance.*\n\nYi Xuanzi says:\n*True lead and worldly lead,*\n*Purity and turbidity—earth debates heaven.*\n*If mixed with ash and sand,*\n*How can propriety and justice be complete?*\n*The deluded become lowly ghosts,*\n*The attuned become exalted immortals.*\n*Should you ask of its form and substance,*\n*Within the mysterious, it is even more mysterious.*\n\nHe also says:\n*The Crone is called Brightness,*\n*Her body dwells in the grotto chamber.*\n*In water, hear the tiger’s roar,*\n*In fire, see the dragon’s radiance.*\n*The attuned gain nobility,*\n*Those who hear of it find their Dao flourishing.*\n\nThe Patriarch once declared,\nThis is the sovereign of all joys.\n\nMaster Hai Chan says:\n*Sea winds toss the golden boat on wave-crested terraces,*\n*Only within it may one awaken to the Mystery.*\n*Mother and child, upon meeting, are fit for tender devotion;*\n*Monarch and minister, once united, rejoice in perfect reunion.*\n*Eight directions encircle the dragon’s fiery course;*\n*Four quarters push forth the tiger’s descent to the spring.*\n*Let this be told to later Dao-seekers:*\n*To refine the elixir, one must employ the lead of the watery realm.*\n\nHe also says:\n*A patch of limpid clarity, a single blossom,*\n*White hibiscus enfolding purple cinnabar.*\n*Beyond the world’s bounds, none can rival it;*\n*In heaven above or among men below, nothing compares.*\n*The golden tiger descends, veiling its dark hue;*\n*The fire dragon first subdues, then transforms into yellow sprout.*\n*When spirit and clarity penetrate the scene of true return,*\n*Without encountering an extraordinary person, one dare not boast.*\n\n**The Well-Dredging Formula**\nAfter dredging the well for elixir refinement, take care not to stir up filth. Wait until the water pulse settles, then draw and replace it to flush away stagnant spring water. Only then may it be left exposed to the open sky, where stars and moon may shine upon it. Once the water’s nature is settled and the black earth has been gathered, one may then draw the water to refine the elixir.\nIf the stone base appears bluish-white, this is the water of the yang pulse—most urgently suited for elixir circulation.\nIf one encounters black mud, yellow spring water, red veins, or iron-rust bitterness with an astringent taste, these signs indicate intermingled water pulses, yin-yang stagnation, and unsuitability for elixir refinement. One should select another site and construct anew.\n\n**The Immortal’s Method for Dwelling in Mountains**\nFor those who would ascend mountains to cultivate perfection or reside securely in the world, one must examine the auspiciousness of the dwelling’s earth. On a *wu* or *ji* day, inscribe the Yellow Writ of the Nine Earths and Thirty-Six Sounds upon white paper, place it at the center of the dwelling, and cover it with a clean basin for three nights. Upon uncovering, observe:\n- If the paper is moistened with green, a corpse lies buried beneath.\n- If moistened with white, great misfortune.\n- If red, there will be fright and terror.\n- If black, treasure lies below.\n- If yellow, great fortune.\n- If purple, one will attain immortality.\nIf no change appears, the dwelling may be safe for three years; beyond that, harm will surely follow.\n\n**The Furnace-Building Method**\nDuring the *jiazi* decade, on a *wushen* day, gather earth from the southwest *shen* direction. First, pile the earth into an altar of three tiers. The furnace shall have eight faces and eight gates, with partitions above each gate. Place the cauldrons upon the partitions: the water cauldron above, the medicine cauldron below. The water cauldron’s mouth should remain open to receive water, then sealed with a lid.\nThe furnace body shall be two *chi* and one *cun* in length, one *chi* and six *cun* in width, with a central clear space of one *chi* and three *cun*, and a thickness of three *cun*. Open a fire gate at the front, five *cun* high and four *cun* wide. Leave an aperture at the rear to vent black fire, like a turtle’s chimney.\n\n**The Fire-Timing Formula**\nOne month comprises six periods, each period lasting five days. The day-count method follows:\n- **First period**: On the first day, one *liang* of the direct tally, two days and a half (thirty hours). Increase to two *liang*, sixty hours.\n- **Second period**: Three *liang*, two days and a half (thirty hours). Increase to four *liang*, sixty hours.\n- **Third period**: Five *liang*, two days and a half (thirty hours). Increase to six *liang*, sixty hours.\n- **Fourth period**: Neither increase nor decrease; use only six *liang*, two days and a half (thirty hours). Then reduce to five *liang*, sixty hours.\n- **Fifth period**: Four *liang*, two days and a half (thirty hours). Reduce to three *liang*, sixty hours.\n- **Sixth period**: Two *liang*, two days and a half (thirty hours). Reduce to one *liang*, sixty hours.\n\nThe six-period direct tally’s waxing and waning over one month is arranged as follows, cycling without end. At the start of the second month, begin the fire anew, increasing to two *liang* over thirty hours, then to three *liang* over sixty hours. Each subsequent month, up to nine months, requires an additional *liang*, reaching nine *liang* by the ninth month—this is the fixed measure. Thus it is said: *Nine yang, nine yin; no further increase.* Even after three or nine years, no further addition is made; adhere strictly to this method.\nBegin the fire on a *jiazi* day. The daily fire moves forward; the hourly fire moves backward. From midnight to noon, divide the black [yin] to the month’s end. Each month, increase the fire by one *liang*; each year, increase the fire by one *liang*. On days governed by the Water Star, increase the fire; on days governed by the Fire Star, reduce the water.\n\n**The Formula for Discerning True Lead and Mercury**\nFor lead: take one *jin* of the first-refined silver from which lead has been removed, and employ it at the furnace.\nFor mercury: take half a *jin* of large cinnabar pieces the size of a hibiscus arrowhead, and employ it at the furnace.\nLead is called the White Tiger; mercury is called the Green Dragon. Such is the principle for discerning lead and mercury.\n\n**The Hua Pond Pairing Formula**\nThe pairing of the Hua Pond unites the primordial One. When lead, mercury, and cinnabar encounter fire, they transform; when they meet wine, they congeal. The Perfected One’s method uses wine to bind them and fire to transform them. Thus, brew a thousand-day rice wine until it is limpid, then use it to boil and unite the lead, mercury, and cinnabar—the method is thus established.\n\n**The Formula for Subduing Lead and Mercury**\nLead can subdue cinnabar, but without tin, it will not succeed. Cinnabar can subdue silver, but without silver, it will not transform. Mercury can alloy with lead, but without fire, they will not unite. Fire can transform things, but without wine, they will not congeal.\n\n**The Furnace-Entry Formula**\nTake lead as earth—earth must receive three.\nTake mercury as marsh—one can encompass three.\nTake cinnabar as seed—two seeds serve as the model.\nTake wine as plowing—ten plowings are complete.\nTake fire as reception—half is the essence.\nTake the vessel as the granary—sealed and secured, it is complete.\nWhen cinnabar forms a pact with lead, enter and merge with the cinnabar. Return to the origin, pouring mercury without cease. The method is natural—what need is there for defense or flourish? Within a hundred days, one attains the sentiment of immortals.\n\n**The Formula for Drawing Mercury from Cinnabar**\nGrind one *jin* of luminous cinnabar into powder. Take a bamboo tube with tightly spaced nodes, leaving three nodes intact.\n\n**Method for Drawing Mercury from the Upper Node**\nOpen the upper node to the size of a pellet.\nOpen the middle node to the size of a malt-sugar lump—this is where the mercury will flow downward.\nAbove the opening of the middle node, first lay two layers of waxed paper. Place cinnabar powder on the waxed paper, then insert it into the upper end of the tube. Bind it tightly with hemp fiber. Steam the bamboo tube in rice for one day.\nNext, coat it with Six-One Mud to a thickness of three *fen*. Bury it in the earth so the tube is level with the ground, packing the soil tightly around it to prevent any leakage of *qi*.\nThen pile firewood and burn it over the tube’s opening for one full cycle. Let the fire’s power penetrate the upper node, causing the mercury to flow down into the lower node without the slightest loss.\nIf the fire is too weak and the mercury is not fully extracted—if the residue remains heavy and dark purple—burn it again as before until the mercury reaches its original weight. Once it reaches fourteen *liang*, stop.\n\nFor extracting mercury from Red Horse-Sprout Cinnabar, White Horse-Sprout Cinnabar, or Purple Spirit-Light Cinnabar, follow this same method; all others are incorrect.\n\n**Method for Removing Fire-Toxin from the Elixir**\nPlace the elixir in a thin porcelain bottle, seal the mouth with yellow wax, then wrap it tightly in oil-dan silk. Secure it firmly and submerge it in a cold spring for fourteen days before removing.\nSet the bottle in a double boiler and steam it for one day to dispel the cold *qi*. Then take it out, grind it to a fine powder, and mix it with paper-mulberry juice to form pills (jujube pulp may also be used). Make the pills the size of mung beans.\nTake one pill with well-water at dawn. After half a month, increase to two pills; after thirty days, increase to three pills—no more.\nFirst, offer seven pills to Heaven, seven to Earth, and seven to the stars. Then bathe, fast, and purify yourself, cutting off all desires before consuming the elixir.\nTake it at dawn, facing east, either standing or sitting.\n\n**Signs of Efficacy After Consuming the Golden Elixir**\nAt first, the elixir will make the limbs weak, the waist and knees heavy, and cause pain below the navel. The mouth will constantly taste foul and black, the teeth will loosen, and the breath will reek of blood. At night, there will be burning thirst, vomiting, or nausea, along with mild diarrhea. Food will lose its flavor, the body will gradually waste away, the eyes will strain, the spirit will wander, sores and swellings will appear, and the whole body will ache. The skin will feel as if insects are crawling over it, and mouth sores will develop—all these are signs of the elixir driving out diseases.\nThere may be throat soreness, chest tightness, and blackened congestion, with foul, dark watery stools resembling shrimp or spider skins, or like mallow or gromwell juice. The waist may feel blocked, or various worms may be expelled. The skin may swell, and the sinews may twitch or spasm, sometimes slack, sometimes tense. Within ten days, wind-toxins will gradually emerge. The abdomen may rumble, and clumps of flesh may pass—this is the elixir attacking long-standing illnesses. Wait until hunger returns, then eat one or two servings of bland gruel or take the *Yu Dan* powder to counteract the elixir’s toxicity.\n\n**Prescription for Counteracting Elixir Toxicity**\n*Ophiopogon* (with hearts removed) – 4 *liang*\n*Asparagus* (with hearts removed) – 4 *liang*\n*Rehmannia* (dried) – 5 *liang*\n*Licorice* – 1 *liang*\n*Ginseng* – 3 *liang*\n*Poria* – 2 *liang*\n*Aster* (with roots removed) – 2.5 *liang*\n*Burnet* – 3.5 *liang*\n*Hematite* – 1.5 *liang*\n*Seaweed* – 1.5 *liang*\n*Gardenia* – 4.5 *liang*\nGrind the above ingredients into a powder. Take two *qian* per dose, mixed with rice water, after consuming the elixir.\n\n**Signs of the Three Corpses’ Departure**\nWhen the Three Corpses are about to leave, one will feel restless and on the verge of madness. The spirit will wander, and there may be fright, palpitations, or nightmares of being devoured by venomous snakes, tigers, or wolves, or of falling from cliffs, encountering enemies, or parting from loved ones—these are the omens.\nWhen sensing these signs of the Three Corpses leaving, remain patient and at ease, control anger, and simply drink one or two bowls of thick licorice decoction. A slight sweat will dispel all disturbances.\n\n**Signs of the Three Corpses Leaving the Body**\nAfter the Three Corpses depart, one will feel lighter, free from thoughts and worries, desires will vanish, and the heart will rejoice—this is the sign of the elixir’s spirit taking effect and offering support.\n\n**Signs of Bone and Skin Transformation**\nAfter taking the elixir, old ailments will flare up, sores and swellings may appear, and there may be slight bleeding or clear scars—these are signs of long-accumulated toxins being expelled through the skin by the elixir’s influence.\n\n**Signs of Rejuvenated Appearance and New Teeth**\nAfter consuming the elixir for a thousand days, the complexion will gradually grow youthful. The teeth may loosen, and the jaw may feel tight—this is the replacement of old teeth with new, elixir-born teeth.\nThe head and face may itch deeply, even to the marrow, and hair may grow on the ears and brows—this is the effect of the elixir strengthening the hair roots.\nAfter three years of taking the elixir, all chronic illnesses will vanish. The flesh will grow smooth, the beard and temples will turn black, the blood vessels will flow freely, the complexion will transform, lost teeth will regrow, hearing and vision will sharpen, and the sinews will strengthen.\nAfter three full years, the bone marrow will fill with black blood, the face will become childlike, the name will be recorded in the Southern Palace and stricken from the Northern Dipper’s register. All spirits will revere you, dragons and tigers will submit, the intestines will turn to gold, the body will be like cold jade, and the form will become immortal material. You will commune with spirits, attain sagehood, and naturally ascend, untouched by cold or heat, your lifespan equaling Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Another Method for Removing Fire-Toxin**\n*Eleuthero* – 1 *jin*\n*Burnet* – 1 *jin*\n*Phyllanthus* – 1 *jin*\n*Niter* – 4 *liang*\n*Licorice* – 4 *liang*\nGrind the above ingredients into a fine powder and mix with the elixir. Boil them together in water, adding more water as needed, for seven days and nights. Then place the mixture in a cold spring for one month.\nNext, boil it in cow’s milk for one day, then transfer it to a bottle and steam it in a double boiler for seven days. Remove, dry, grind into an extremely fine powder, and form into pills with jujube pulp.\n\n**Another Method**\nChar licorice over fire, hold it in the mouth, and swallow the saliva to gradually resolve the toxin. Alternatively, decoct licorice in water, let it cool, and drink it to achieve the same effect.\n\n**Another Method**\nBefore the beginning of spring, collect snow from the central beam of the roof in a porcelain vessel and boil it. Snow from the rooftop is unsuitable.\n\n**Another Method**\nPlace the medicinal ingredients into a bamboo tube, first scraping away its green outer layer. Wrap the opening of the tube in multiple layers of raw silk cloth and set it in a pot filled with black soybeans, ensuring the soybeans do not submerge the tube’s mouth. Add water gradually and boil for the duration of the three *fu* periods. Meanwhile, dissolve honey in hot water and pour it into the tube, then steam in a double boiler, replenishing as it reduces to prevent the tube from tilting. Once the time is complete, remove the contents, refine with water, and form into pills the size of hemp seeds with jujube pulp. Take two pills on an empty stomach with saliva.\n\n*On the Reverted Elixir: Discourse of the Immortals Concluded*",

      "translated_text": "**The Assembly of Immortals on the Cyclically Transformed Elixir**\n\n*Scripture Title:* *The Assembly of Immortals on the Cyclically Transformed Elixir*\nCompiled by Yang Zai, the Recluse of Baofu Mountain, during the Huangyou era of the Northern Song. This work gathers essential discourses on elixir refinement from over thirty Tang and Song masters, preserving many lost ancient alchemical formulas. One scroll.\n*Source of Base Text:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n**Preface to *The Assembly of Immortals on the Cyclically Transformed Elixir***\nBy Yang Zai, the Recluse of Baofu Mountain\n\nThe cyclically transformed elixir begins with the Flowery Pond. Within the Flowery Pond, divine water is born. Pure and numinous above and below, it is serene, luminous, and still. As the divine water transforms, it becomes as white as frost, called the White Metal and Yellow Sprout. Next, the essence of the Three Yangs is introduced, boiled with water and refined with fire. After nine revolutions, it becomes a purple powder, called the Purple River Chariot. Mercury is then added to the River Chariot, undergoing another nine revolutions to produce true gold, called the Golden Duke. When the Golden Duke unites with mercury, metal and water meet, refined through nine further revolutions to form the cyclically transformed elixir. Those who ingest it attain longevity; the aged revert to youth; illnesses vanish of themselves; the mortal becomes immortal—naturally undying.\n\nThe cyclically transformed elixir requires direct oral transmission of the secret formulas to recognize lead and mercury. Lead is true lead; mercury is true mercury. Lead is not black tin; mercury is not liquid silver. Lead is the essence of lead; mercury is cinnabar mercury. When lead and mercury unite, the Yellow Sprout is born. The Yellow Sprout is the ancestor of the cyclically transformed elixir and the foundation of the great medicine. The *kan* trigram’s lunar lead conceals the true tiger; the *li* trigram’s solar mercury conceals the true dragon. When dragon and tiger meet, *wu* and *ji* form of themselves. The *kan* water generates metal; the *li* fire generates wood. Naturally, the four images are complete, and the five phases are unblemished.\n\nThe cyclically transformed elixir is metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Metal is the tiger; wood is the dragon; fire is the Vermilion Bird; water is the Dark Warrior; earth is the convergence of the four images. It does not employ worldly gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, tin, salt, alkali, ashes, or frost. The cyclically transformed elixir is lead and mercury. Lead, receiving water, has no fixed form; mercury, receiving fire, attains numinosity. From nonbeing, being arises: true lead is transformed by water, and true mercury is formed by fire.\n\nAs for true lead and true mercury, the divine water of the Flowery Pond, the Azure Dragon and White Tiger, the Yellow Sprout and White Snow, the River Chariot and the divine chamber—since ancient times, these cannot be understood without oral transmission. I am a man of Xihe in Fenyang. From my youth, I loved the Dao. After more than thirty years, I met an enlightened master and received oral transmission of the secret formulas. Only then did I comprehend the principles of the elixir scriptures, penetrate the profound and subtle texts, witness the truth of creation, and grasp the marvels of ascent and descent. On the eighth day of the eleventh month in the fourth year of the Huangyou era of the Song, I had leisure to compile essential passages from various elixir scriptures into one scroll, entitled *The Assembly of Immortals on the Cyclically Transformed Elixir*, in the hope that it may await those of like aspiration.\n\n---\n\n**The Assembly of Immortals on the Cyclically Transformed Elixir**\n\nThe Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning said:\nIn the profound and obscure, the pure and still Dao;\nIn the dim and silent, the ancestral void of Great Emptiness.\nThe nature and essence are serene, abiding in nothingness;\nThe physical form is utterly quiescent, one with true emptiness.\n\nHe also said:\nBefore the separation of the undifferentiated chaos, the true unity was contained within.\nOnce the true unity divided, the clear and dark became heaven, the turbid and dark became earth.\nThe darkness of the true unity ascends and descends, inhaling and exhaling without cease.\nFrom the darkness, essence is born: the essence and *qi* of heaven are the sun, moon, and stars; the essence and *qi* of earth are lead and mercury.\nLead is the lunar essence; mercury is the solar soul.\n\nThe Lord of the Dao said:\nThe solar soul and lunar essence are the marrow of the cyclically transformed elixir.\nObtaining the yin darkness, it becomes the White Sprout and cinnabar;\nObtaining the yang darkness, it becomes golden cinnabar.\nWhen golden cinnabar enters the five viscera, it disperses like mist and rain, permeating the four limbs.\n\nLord Lao said:\nThe external elixir arises amid the divine water’s inquiry;\nThe internal elixir arises amid the dharma water’s juncture.\n\nHe also said:\nRed lead and black lead are the head of the great elixir.\nRed lead entering black is true gold.\nExtracting the essence from red lead and the marrow from black,\nWhen skillfully employed, the red-black medicine is unparalleled.\nUsing red to enter black ensures longevity;\nUsing black to enter red makes one a celestial immortal.\nBoth red and black are called the cyclically transformed;\nBlack can transform, but red takes precedence.\nBy the side of Liang Mountain near the Hangu Pass,\nLord Lao carved these words into stone.\n\nShennong said:\nCinnabar and mercury are the essence and *qi* of the sun and moon.\nWhen in the sun, it is called radiant cinnabar—\nThe essence of the Great Yang.\nWhen in the moon, it is mercury—\nThe essence of the Great Yin.\n\n*The Yellow Emperor’s Scripture of the Nine Cauldrons* said:\nLead does not travel alone; if it moves, it must have a companion.\nWhen carefully employed, lead and mercury share a single origin,\nAble to generate golden blossoms, called the beautiful golden blossom.\n\nThe Supreme Sovereign said:\nThe plain and light are despised by the world;\nThe flowery and granular are prized by the world.\n*Geng* and *xin* in equal measure,\nMelted and fused together.\nThe emergent male and female medicines,\nRefined in the upper nest.\nHard and soft as one body,\nNothing compares to this truth.\n\nLord Mao marveled and said:\nWithin yin there is yang; within yang there is yin.\nCold and heat oppose each other; the tiger roars and the dragon sings.\nAzure, black, red, and white each reside in their own direction.\nIf they are misaligned, the guiding principle is lost.\nYang acts as minister; yin becomes sovereign.\nAttend to the subtle shifts, and the heavenly Dao will naturally flourish.\n\nHe also said:\nWithin the cyclical there is no elixir; within the elixir there is cyclical return.\nWithout lead, the elixir cannot form;\nThe cyclically transformed elixir is born from lead.\n\nHe also said:\nWhite Snow Powder, Golden Sprout—\nWithout mastery, do not boast idly.\nPeople of this age do not recognize the true Yellow Sprout,\nKnowing only to identify lead’s yellow blossom.\nThe blossom is but a dead thing;\nHow can it lead one to the immortal’s realm?\n\nThe Divine Chamber marveled and said:\nHeaven and earth are mysterious and yellow;\nLead and white form the frame.\nThe divine chamber above and below\nDoes not depart from its original text.\nExamine the harmony of six and one,\nProceeding in unison with the above.\nWhen empty, it becomes a thief;\nWhen full, it defends itself.",

catties of yellow dragon and black essence,\nWhen fired without flight, are most divine.\nThe furnace’s base is small, its mouth two fen wide,\nAbove opens a starry path to the Celestial Ford.\n\nThus, the White Tiger serves as the brain,\nThe Yellow Sprout as the root.\nAfter one cycle of cultivation,\nIt yields yellow silver.\n\nMaster Yin Zhen said:\nWhen Gold Flower is thrice refined and nine times tempered,\nIt is called Old Yin—cast it into a crucible.\nIf a practitioner completes this crucible,\nThe cinnabar clouds and azure skies are not hard to reach.\n\nHe also said:\nTo obtain the Yellow Sprout, first ignite lead.\nIf Ren does not flee in the fire,\nHow can Gui form a union?\nThe hen incubates her eggs until the days are full;\nWhen the cicada matures, its shell parts naturally.\n\n*The Golden Tiger Formula of Ma Mingsheng* states:\nBlack lead transforms into the Yellow Sprout,\nWithin it, the number nine repeated ninefold.\nIts changes are but three kinds;\nWhen refined to the Purple Yang Palace,\nGold has no place to rest.\n\n*The Golden and Azure Disquisition on Doubts* says:\nWhen mercury obtains the Gold Flower,\nTheir forms become akin—\nDragon and Tiger unite,\nThus forming the cyclically transformed elixir.\nWhen Gold Flower obtains gold and silver,\nTheir forms become supreme treasures.\nThese two matters cannot be heard of lightly.\nIf one speaks of Gold Flower, it is but the Yellow Sprout.\n\n*The Hundred Questions Treatise* states:\nA true person forms gold and silver with medicine—\nMust one seek cinnabar as the mother?\nIf one must create golden treasure,\nWhat harm is there in having the mother?\nDead mother is true silver;\nBefore returning to the mother’s body,\nHow can this not be principle?\nApart from the Yellow Sprout as supreme medicine,\nOther medicines are difficult to subdue.\nThere is no false mercury,\nNo true asafoetida.\nNo other substances enter the Yellow Sprout’s body—\nMercury, moved by the essence of the Five Phases,\nReceives the qi of true yang.\nWhen the year’s elixir is complete,\nThe bones stand firm and the spirit is whole.\nIf mercury is thus subdued,\nHow can one not become immortal?\nIf there are杂 impurities,\nIt cannot be accomplished.\n\n*The Heart Mirror of Cyclically Transformed Elixir* says:\nLead contains the five colors,\nMercury emits the three flowers.\nWhen the two unite as one body,\nIt is called the River Chariot.\nThe world is deluded by it,\nExhausting their wealth and families.\nThose who attain the formula\nMay tread the clouds and mist.\n\nIt also says:\nMercury has the flaw of sinking at the waist;\nIt must obtain the essence of true lead.\nIf one does not recognize the essence of true lead,\nAfter kalpas of refinement,\nOne will ultimately achieve nothing.\n\nMaster Yuanyang annotated:\nIf white gold is to be subdued by fire,\nThe resonance lies within a foot’s distance—\nIt must be an oral formula,\nDifficult to transmit in writing.\n\n*Wei Boyang’s Five Categories* states:\nThe cyclically transformed elixir fundamentally relies on lead as its root.\nWhen the root is formed, the sprout grows;\nWhen the sprout grows, mercury is subdued;\nWhen mercury is subdued, the elixir is complete—\nIt is not an external thing.\nThose who cultivate the elixir\nMust not use worldly gold and silver.\n\n*The Secret Record of the Golden Elixir* says:\nSimply use nine-times-refined lead essence as the divine chamber,\nWithin which nurture the golden water,\nTemporarily borrowing the power of lead’s qi.\n\nHu Gangzi said:\nAll immortals do not speak of this one ingredient.\nWithout transformation,\nIt is not truly complete.\nLike nine-times-refined lead essence subdued by fire,\nIf one has not obtained it for consumption,\nEating it would cause immediate death.\n\n*The Master Who Embraces Simplicity* writes:\nWhen divine immortals create gold,\nThey do so to consume it themselves,\nNot for the sake of wealth and nobility.\nDivine immortals’ silver may also be consumed—\nIt is not counterfeit.\n\n*The Treatise on the Kinship of the Three* states:\nThe golden elixir cannot be formed with many medicines;\nAfter ten thousand refinements, it still cannot be subdued by fire.\n\nThe Classic says:\nCinnabar can be made into gold,\nThe River Chariot can be made into silver.\nSilver is instantly formed,\nAnd when formed, it is true.\nAttaining this Dao,\nOne may become an immortal.\n\n*The Secret Record of the Golden Elixir* says:\nLead’s nature is white but inwardly red;\nCinnabar’s nature is red but inwardly white.\nThey become watery clouds and frost-like snow—\nAll are the qi of heaven and earth.\nWhen made with medicine,\nThey are no different from the real.\n\n*The Three Envoys Formula of the Great One* states:\nWithin lead there is a child—\nNo need for the three yellows.\nFire is the same as this;\nMoreover, it creates the Yellow Sprout.\nWithin the sprout there is a child—\nNo need for the mother’s obstruction.\nWithin the child, the mother transforms;\nChild and mother are thus the same.\nThe world calls it the Gushing Spring Repository—\nThis method is not falsely transmitted.\nRemember the three yellows,\nBut do not speak of the one black.\n\nRihua Zi said:\nYellow lead subdues black lead,\nWhite mercury is sagely and profound.\nThe western marsh meets the southeast,\nThe eastern palace’s matron is wise.\nThey marry following the sun and moon,\nTransforming the Dao to verify immortality.\nAfter nine refinements, the elixir’s radiance shines,\nAnd one lives long without counting the years.\n\nHe also said:\nSpiritual lead is the lord of mercury,\nSpiritual mercury is the minister of fire-lead.\nLead and true mercury—\nThese are the essentials of the yellow and white.\n\n*The Great One’s Elixir Book* says:\nTake eight ounces of true lead to make a vessel,\nCall it the divine chamber.\nCoat it with burned borax,\nAdd one catty of mercury,\nAnd refine it with water and fire—\nNo external repository is needed.\nThen, from the mutual subjugation of water and fire,\nThe Jade Smile Child is born,\nPossessing the five colors—\nIt is called Purple Tooth Cinnabar.\nIts forms have twenty-four kinds,\nBut only those resembling mounds and tombs are unfit—\nDiscard them in the eastern flowing waters.\n\n*The Divine Mercury Treatise of Hu Gangzi* says:\nRefine lead essence into yellow earth,\nUse the yellow earth to make a repository,\nWithin which nurture flying frost to form the elixir.\nEarth becomes the River Chariot,\nReady to be used as a cover or base.\nBefore the various elixirs are complete,\nThe River Chariot cannot be used—\nUsing it would be without merit.\n\n*Master Yin Zhen’s Five Categories* says:\nIf lead is used to gather flowers,\nLead loses its qi.\nIf it gathers essence,\nLead loses its bones.\nThe Yellow Sprout—\nThe Three Powers are complete,\nBone and flesh do not separate.\n\nA song says:\nMercury is a single ingredient without other things.\nFirst it is flesh, then it becomes bone.\nWhen bone and flesh follow one another, they endure forever;\nFrom this, the River Chariot has no end.\nLike a person giving birth to a son or daughter,\nThe parents remain clearly present—\nThis illustrates that the true gold’s original source remains.",

aloft.\n\nIt is also said:\nTo use lead, one must blend it with mercury,\nTwo families unite as bride and groom sing.\nRefined to the Purple River Chariot, it shakes the earth,\nWhite clouds accompany as cranes pass by.\n\nIt is also said:\nGreen Dragon and White Tiger merge as an embryo,\nTen months of gestation, only then does it fully open.\nThis is the true oral formula of lead’s sprouts—\nWhere in the world can one seek the Three Powers?\n\nIt is also said:\nThe market brims with yellow sprouts, yet none find their home,\nThe world scorns them, reducing them to dust.\nThough nobles and ministers recognize the numinous medicine,\nGreed alone obscures and confounds them.\n\nMaster Yuanyang states:\nThe profound subtleties of the Five Phases are hard to know,\nDragon hides, Tiger conceals—within Kan and Li they dwell.\nThe arts of returning elixir number in the hundreds,\nYet the most wondrous requires the Golden Flower Pool.\n\nIt is also said:\nLead and mercury cannot be relied upon as one,\nThe secret of the Golden Elixir—even sages know it not.\nIf one uses mundane lead and mercury from the world,\nYear after year, with fire they contend in vain.\n\nIt is also said:\nTrue Yin and True Yang are the true Dao,\nYet they lie before your eyes—why seek them afar?\nThe common crowd year after year refines divine cinnabar,\nSometimes seeing blue and yellow, they deem it fine.\n\nIt is also said:\nThe nine-fold refined cinnabar marks desire’s end,\nOnly when the furnace opens does the elixir’s flower bloom red.\nTransformed by water and fire, all becomes earth—\nWhere then can one find the Golden Duke?\n\nMaster Peng marvels and says:\nBlack lead enters the crescent moon,\nAt the hour of Zi, it naturally disperses.\nAbove, it bears the green creek’s sand,\nBelow, golden flowers appear.\nRaised eastward, then rising west,\nComing and going, seizing the opportune moment.\nFor a long while, hands do not cease,\nBlack lead scatters the green sand.\nFierce fire roasts without pause,\nAs it circulates, it transforms into yellow flowers.\nGreen sand quenched into ceruse,\nYellow flowers become red lead.\nThough the world sees it all,\nNone grasp the difficulty it entails.\nA myriad refinements are not easily achieved,\nWhat one ingests must endure long peace.\n\nMaster Yin received the Green Elixir and marveled, saying:\nNüwa refined stone into five hues,\nSoaring to the Great Veil as a canopy of splendor.\nWithin the azure void, the yin wheel is born,\nSulfur and wood’s essence can pair.\nThe Human Sovereign refined silver to attain longevity,\nJoining Li with Zhen to complete the Five Phases.\nTwelve months traversing the nine-fold cycle,\nThe Golden Elixir is truly the essence of wood.\nThe Golden Elder’s two characters are the water of Kan,\nFlying into Gen’s palace, never to rise again.\nYin and yang form substance, naturally from the east,\nAll affairs must return to Wu and Ji.\nThe supreme Dao of heaven and earth must not be transmitted,\nGold and silver are my Green Elixir’s children.\nKnow well that the Most High is beyond thought,\nYin Xi received Nüwa’s record.\n\nThe *Song of the Golden Elixir* says:\nThough Dragon and Tiger bear two names,\nTheir root and origin arise from one center.\nIf one seeks the method of the Returning Elixir,\nSimply nurture metal’s essence with wood’s essence.\n\nIt is also said:\nThe wondrous principle of true emptiness is clear,\nHidden within lead, its name does not appear.\nDiscern the yellow sprout when it ought to emerge,\nAnd know the White Tiger is destined for long life.\n\nIt is also said:\nSilver serves as the outer frame, containing three things,\nGold acts as the embankment, receiving the Five Phases.\nBest is the secret of the Flower Pool’s divine water—\nYet people do not understand, and ten thousand fail to succeed.\n\nMaster Zhang the Celestial says:\nMountain stone gold and silver, hard in nature and hotly toxic,\nWhen made into liquid gold, are difficult to complete,\nLike glue or paste, unfit for ingestion,\nThey consume one’s marrow.\nBut if medicinal gold is made into liquid,\nIts path must flourish,\nYellow and red as water,\nIngested, it soars to the heavens.\n\nThe *Three Essays of the Pottery Altar* states:\nWhite gold, from the northern water’s midst,\nTransforms its form and substance.\nThrough forging and refining,\nIt is cultivated into the Great Elixir.\nThe water’s essence never ceases,\nThus it is said to dissolve into water.\n\nThe *Golden Casket Jade Book* states:\nIf it encounters divine water,\nBlack and white separate.\n\nThe *Golden and Azure Fire Mirror for Ingesting Medicine* states:\nZiming binds into the golden spirit’s coffer,\nAble to transform the body’s hue to azure and purple.\nThe twenty-eight constellations align with heaven’s heart—\nThis is true lead, capable of transmuting into water.\n\nMaster Zheng transmitted to Ge Zhichuan, saying:\nThere is a thing, there is a thing,\nIt can be great, it can endure.\nGathered before the silkworm’s feeding,\nUsed after the fire’s transformation.\nBearing broth from above to pour below,\nIt irrigates the empty cauldron, receiving all.\nSun and moon revolve,\nFive phases lie in wait.\nThe moth’s wind swiftly stirs,\nGolden juice does not flee.\nWater irrigates it,\nFrom being to non-being.\nFire burns it,\nFrom non-being to being.\nWhite powder accumulates like snow,\nYellow butter congeals into golden pairing.\nLifting and overturning, intent on blackness,\nReversing decay and decrepitude.\nIs it gold? Is it stone?\nHeaven’s years, earth’s longevity,\nEver turning without cease,\nSpirits hasten, ghosts gallop.\nNo attachment to words,\nThe secret lies in heart and mouth.\n\nThe *Secret Essentials of the Great Dao* states:\nThe Great White Star of Venus is the essence of metal.\nReceiving the moon’s po, containing the earth star’s qi,\nIts inner color is yellow—this is the Golden Flower.\nThe moon’s qi’s influence is po, po belongs to water,\nThus it obtains the qi of metal and water,\nCorresponding to the northern Chen star,\nAnd generates lead.\nThe Year Star is wood.\nThe sun’s hun, the essence of water’s blackness.\nIts hun is red fire.\nFire generates wood,\nCorresponding to the black of Mars,\nAnd generates cinnabar.\nCinnabar internally contains wood’s yin qi,\nThus it has mercury.\nMercury is called the Green Dragon,\nThe Green Dragon belongs to wood.\nThe Chen star is water.\nThe essence of water,\nTransmitting the qi of the Great White metal,\nFlowing essence corresponds to earth,\nAnd receiving the moon’s po, it generates lead.\nThus lead is born of the Golden Flower,\nThe Golden Flower has five colors,\nCalled the yellow sprout.\nThe qi of the water constellation descends upon wood,\nAnd generates malachite.\nThe Mars star is fire.\nThe essence of fire,\nObtaining the black of the wood star,\nAnd transmitting the sun’s hun,\nFlowing essence enters earth,\nAnd generates cinnabar.\nHun belongs to fire,\nBorn of wood,\nInternally containing yin, it generates mercury.\nFire generates earth,\nEarth contains true yang,\nGenerating realgar,\nIts flavor is sweet.\nThe Saturn star is earth.\nReceiving the qi of the fire and earth constellations,\nContaining true yang, it has realgar.",

one rides the clouds and mist.\n\nMaster Mingdao, discoursing on the Flowery Pond, says:\n*Yin and yang alternate, birthing south and north,*\n*Lead-water and mercury-water emerge from lead.*\n*Comprehending these four wondrous principles,*\n*Only then does the Flowery Pond’s red and black intermingle.*\n\n*The Golden Mercury Formula* states:\n*Lead arises truly from within lead,*\n*Brought forth, it binds cinnabar’s flowing essence.*\n*The Golden Flower tames mercury, the pheasant subdues the sparrow,*\n*Transforming into the Reverted Elixir—a most extraordinary affair.*\n\n*The Water-Fire Diagram of the Golden Elixir* says:\n*To recognize cinnabar, test it with fire—*\n*Smokeless, deep purple, that is the Reverted Elixir.*\n*Worldly folk know not the true Dragon and Tiger,*\n*Mistaking the yellow sprout for two separate things.*\n\nMeng Can says:\n*Focus the mind to fathom the Mystery’s origin,*\n*Once awakened, profound mechanisms seem effortless.*\n*Before speaking of the Elixir’s return to the grotto,*\n*First discuss the divine transformations aiding the mortal realm.*\n*Fleeting life—abandon glory and rank,*\n*In this world, one

autumn,*\n*Stone blossoms in spring.*\n\nAnother formula says:\n*Autumn stone is true lead,*\n*The Golden Flower is the yellow sprout.*\n*The yellow sprout does not leave lead,*\n*From lead, its

      "translated_text": "The Patriarch once declared,\nThis is the sovereign of all joys.\n\nMaster Hai Chan says:\n*Sea winds toss the golden boat on wave-crested terraces,*\n*Only within it may one awaken to the Mystery.*\n*Mother and child, upon meeting, are fit for tender devotion;*\n*Monarch and minister, once united, rejoice in perfect reunion.*\n*Eight directions encircle the dragon’s fiery course;*\n*Four quarters push forth the tiger’s descent to the spring.*\n*Let this be told to later Dao-seekers:*\n*To refine the elixir, one must employ the lead of the watery realm.*\n\nHe also says:\n*A patch of limpid clarity, a single blossom,*\n*White hibiscus enfolding purple cinnabar.*\n*Beyond the world’s bounds, none can rival it;*\n*In heaven above or among men below, nothing compares.*\n*The golden tiger descends, veiling its dark hue;*\n*The fire dragon first subdues, then transforms into yellow sprout.*\n*When spirit and clarity penetrate the scene of true return,*\n*Without encountering an extraordinary person, one dare not boast.*\n\n**The Well-Dredging Formula**\nAfter dredging the well for elixir refinement, take care not to stir up filth. Wait until the water pulse settles, then draw and replace it to flush away stagnant spring water. Only then may it be left exposed to the open sky, where stars and moon may shine upon it. Once the water’s nature is settled and the black earth has been gathered, one may then draw the water to refine the elixir.\nIf the stone base appears bluish-white, this is the water of the yang pulse—most urgently suited for elixir circulation.\nIf one encounters black mud, yellow spring water, red veins, or iron-rust bitterness with an astringent taste, these signs indicate intermingled water pulses, yin-yang stagnation, and unsuitability for elixir refinement. One should select another site and construct anew.\n\n**The Immortal’s Method for Dwelling in Mountains**\nFor those who would ascend mountains to cultivate perfection or reside securely in the world, one must examine the auspiciousness of the dwelling’s earth. On a *wu* or *ji* day, inscribe the Yellow Writ of the Nine Earths and Thirty-Six Sounds upon white paper, place it at the center of the dwelling, and cover it with a clean basin for three nights. Upon uncovering, observe:\n- If the paper is moistened with green, a corpse lies buried beneath.\n- If moistened with white, great misfortune.\n- If red, there will be fright and terror.\n- If black, treasure lies below.\n- If yellow, great fortune.\n- If purple, one will attain immortality.\nIf no change appears, the dwelling may be safe for three years; beyond that, harm will surely follow.\n\n**The Furnace-Building Method**\nDuring the *jiazi* decade, on a *wushen* day, gather earth from the southwest *shen* direction. First, pile the earth into an altar of three tiers. The furnace shall have eight faces and eight gates, with partitions above each gate. Place the cauldrons upon the partitions: the water cauldron above, the medicine cauldron below. The water cauldron’s mouth should remain open to receive water, then sealed with a lid.\nThe furnace body shall be two *chi* and one *cun* in length, one *chi* and six *cun* in width, with a central clear space of one *chi* and three *cun*, and a thickness of three *cun*. Open a fire gate at the front, five *cun* high and four *cun* wide. Leave an aperture at the rear to vent black fire, like a turtle’s chimney.\n\n**The Fire-Timing Formula**\nOne month comprises six periods, each period lasting five days. The day-count method follows:\n- **First period**: On the first day, one *liang* of the direct tally, two days and a half (thirty hours). Increase to two *liang*, sixty hours.\n- **Second period**: Three *liang*, two days and a half (thirty hours). Increase to four *liang*, sixty hours.\n- **Third period**: Five *liang*, two days and a half (thirty hours). Increase to six *liang*, sixty hours.\n- **Fourth period**: Neither increase nor decrease; use only six *liang*, two days and a half (thirty hours). Then reduce to five *liang*, sixty hours.\n- **Fifth period**: Four *liang*, two days and a half (thirty hours). Reduce to three *liang*, sixty hours.\n- **Sixth period**: Two *liang*, two days and a half (thirty hours). Reduce to one *liang*, sixty hours.\n\nThe six-period direct tally’s waxing and waning over one month is arranged as follows, cycling without end. At the start of the second month, begin the fire anew, increasing to two *liang* over thirty hours, then to three *liang* over sixty hours. Each subsequent month, up to nine months, requires an additional *liang*, reaching nine *liang* by the ninth month—this is the fixed measure. Thus it is said: *Nine yang, nine yin; no further increase.* Even after three or nine years, no further addition is made; adhere strictly to this method.\nBegin the fire on a *jiazi* day. The daily fire moves forward; the hourly fire moves backward. From midnight to noon, divide the black [yin] to the month’s end. Each month, increase the fire by one *liang*; each year, increase the fire by one *liang*. On days governed by the Water Star, increase the fire; on days governed by the Fire Star, reduce the water.\n\n**The Formula for Discerning True Lead and Mercury**\nFor lead: take one *jin* of the first-refined silver from which lead has been removed, and employ it at the furnace.\nFor mercury: take half a *jin* of large cinnabar pieces the size of a hibiscus arrowhead, and employ it at the furnace.\nLead is called the White Tiger; mercury is called the Green Dragon. Such is the principle for discerning lead and mercury.\n\n**The Hua Pond Pairing Formula**\nThe pairing of the Hua Pond unites the primordial One. When lead, mercury, and cinnabar encounter fire, they transform; when they meet wine, they congeal. The Perfected One’s method uses wine to bind them and fire to transform them. Thus, brew a thousand-day rice wine until it is limpid, then use it to boil and unite the lead, mercury, and cinnabar—the method is thus established.\n\n**The Formula for Subduing Lead and Mercury**\nLead can subdue cinnabar, but without tin, it will not succeed. Cinnabar can subdue silver, but without silver, it will not transform. Mercury can alloy with lead, but without fire, they will not unite. Fire can transform things, but without wine, they will not congeal.\n\n**The Furnace-Entry Formula**\nTake lead as earth—earth must receive three.\nTake mercury as marsh—one can encompass three.\nTake cinnabar as seed—two seeds serve as the model.\nTake wine as plowing—ten plowings are complete.\nTake fire as reception—half is the essence.\nTake the vessel as the granary—sealed and secured, it is complete.\nWhen cinnabar forms a pact with lead, enter and merge with the cinnabar. Return to the origin, pouring mercury without cease. The method is natural—what need is there for defense or flourish? Within a hundred days, one attains the sentiment of immortals.\n\n**The Formula for Drawing Mercury from Cinnabar**\nGrind one *jin* of luminous cinnabar into powder. Take a bamboo tube with tightly spaced nodes, leaving three nodes intact.",

      "translated_text": "**Method for Drawing Mercury from the Upper Node**\nOpen the upper node to the size of a pellet.\nOpen the middle node to the size of a malt-sugar lump—this is where the mercury will flow downward.\nAbove the opening of the middle node, first lay two layers of waxed paper. Place cinnabar powder on the waxed paper, then insert it into the upper end of the tube. Bind it tightly with hemp fiber. Steam the bamboo tube in rice for one day.\nNext, coat it with Six-One Mud to a thickness of three *fen*. Bury it in the earth so the tube is level with the ground, packing the soil tightly around it to prevent any leakage of *qi*.\nThen pile firewood and burn it over the tube’s opening for one full cycle. Let the fire’s power penetrate the upper node, causing the mercury to flow down into the lower node without the slightest loss.\nIf the fire is too weak and the mercury is not fully extracted—if the residue remains heavy and dark purple—burn it again as before until the mercury reaches its original weight. Once it reaches fourteen *liang*, stop.\n\nFor extracting mercury from Red Horse-Sprout Cinnabar, White Horse-Sprout Cinnabar, or Purple Spirit-Light Cinnabar, follow this same method; all others are incorrect.\n\n**Method for Removing Fire-Toxin from the Elixir**\nPlace the elixir in a thin porcelain bottle, seal the mouth with yellow wax, then wrap it tightly in oil-dan silk. Secure it firmly and submerge it in a cold spring for fourteen days before removing.\nSet the bottle in a double boiler and steam it for one day to dispel the cold *qi*. Then take it out, grind it to a fine powder, and mix it with paper-mulberry juice to form pills (jujube pulp may also be used). Make the pills the size of mung beans.\nTake one pill with well-water at dawn. After half a month, increase to two pills; after thirty days, increase to three pills—no more.\nFirst, offer seven pills to Heaven, seven to Earth, and seven to the stars. Then bathe, fast, and purify yourself, cutting off all desires before consuming the elixir.\nTake it at dawn, facing east, either standing or sitting.\n\n**Signs of Efficacy After Consuming the Golden Elixir**\nAt first, the elixir will make the limbs weak, the waist and knees heavy, and cause pain below the navel. The mouth will constantly taste foul and black, the teeth will loosen, and the breath will reek of blood. At night, there will be burning thirst, vomiting, or nausea, along with mild diarrhea. Food will lose its flavor, the body will gradually waste away, the eyes will strain, the spirit will wander, sores and swellings will appear, and the whole body will ache. The skin will feel as if insects are crawling over it, and mouth sores will develop—all these are signs of the elixir driving out diseases.\nThere may be throat soreness, chest tightness, and blackened congestion, with foul, dark watery stools resembling shrimp or spider skins, or like mallow or gromwell juice. The waist may feel blocked, or various worms may be expelled. The skin may swell, and the sinews may twitch or spasm, sometimes slack, sometimes tense. Within ten days, wind-toxins will gradually emerge. The abdomen may rumble, and clumps of flesh may pass—this is the elixir attacking long-standing illnesses. Wait until hunger returns, then eat one or two servings of bland gruel or take the *Yu Dan* powder to counteract the elixir’s toxicity.\n\n**Prescription for Counteracting Elixir Toxicity**\n*Ophiopogon* (with hearts removed) – 4 *liang*\n*Asparagus* (with hearts removed) – 4 *liang*\n*Rehmannia* (dried) – 5 *liang*\n*Licorice* – 1 *liang*\n*Ginseng* – 3 *liang*\n*Poria* – 2 *liang*\n*Aster* (with roots removed) – 2.5 *liang*\n*Burnet* – 3.5 *liang*\n*Hematite* – 1.5 *liang*\n*Seaweed* – 1.5 *liang*\n*Gardenia* – 4.5 *liang*\nGrind the above ingredients into a powder. Take two *qian* per dose, mixed with rice water, after consuming the elixir.\n\n**Signs of the Three Corpses’ Departure**\nWhen the Three Corpses are about to leave, one will feel restless and on the verge of madness. The spirit will wander, and there may be fright, palpitations, or nightmares of being devoured by venomous snakes, tigers, or wolves, or of falling from cliffs, encountering enemies, or parting from loved ones—these are the omens.\nWhen sensing these signs of the Three Corpses leaving, remain patient and at ease, control anger, and simply drink one or two bowls of thick licorice decoction. A slight sweat will dispel all disturbances.\n\n**Signs of the Three Corpses Leaving the Body**\nAfter the Three Corpses depart, one will feel lighter, free from thoughts and worries, desires will vanish, and the heart will rejoice—this is the sign of the elixir’s spirit taking effect and offering support.\n\n**Signs of Bone and Skin Transformation**\nAfter taking the elixir, old ailments will flare up, sores and swellings may appear, and there may be slight bleeding or clear scars—these are signs of long-accumulated toxins being expelled through the skin by the elixir’s influence.\n\n**Signs of Rejuvenated Appearance and New Teeth**\nAfter consuming the elixir for a thousand days, the complexion will gradually grow youthful. The teeth may loosen, and the jaw may feel tight—this is the replacement of old teeth with new, elixir-born teeth.\nThe head and face may itch deeply, even to the marrow, and hair may grow on the ears and brows—this is the effect of the elixir strengthening the hair roots.\nAfter three years of taking the elixir, all chronic illnesses will vanish. The flesh will grow smooth, the beard and temples will turn black, the blood vessels will flow freely, the complexion will transform, lost teeth will regrow, hearing and vision will sharpen, and the sinews will strengthen.\nAfter three full years, the bone marrow will fill with black blood, the face will become childlike, the name will be recorded in the Southern Palace and stricken from the Northern Dipper’s register. All spirits will revere you, dragons and tigers will submit, the intestines will turn to gold, the body will be like cold jade, and the form will become immortal material. You will commune with spirits, attain sagehood, and naturally ascend, untouched by cold or heat, your lifespan equaling Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Another Method for Removing Fire-Toxin**\n*Eleuthero* – 1 *jin*\n*Burnet* – 1 *jin*\n*Phyllanthus* – 1 *jin*\n*Niter* – 4 *liang*\n*Licorice* – 4 *liang*\nGrind the above ingredients into a fine powder and mix with the elixir. Boil them together in water, adding more water as needed, for seven days and nights. Then place the mixture in a cold spring for one month.\nNext, boil it in cow’s milk for one day, then transfer it to a bottle and steam it in a double boiler for seven days.
