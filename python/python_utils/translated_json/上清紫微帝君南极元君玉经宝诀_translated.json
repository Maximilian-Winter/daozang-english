  "full_translation": "**The Jade Canon and Precious Instructions of the Supreme Clarity Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord and the South Pole Primordial Sovereign**\n\n**Canon Title:** *The Jade Canon and Precious Instructions of the Supreme Clarity Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord and the South Pole Primordial Sovereign*. Author unknown, approximately dating to the Northern and Southern Dynasties. Contains two texts: *The Twenty-Four Divine Perfected Ones of the Supreme Tenuity Emperor Lord’s Scripture of the Return to the Origin* and *The Jade Canon and Precious Instructions of the South Pole Primordial Sovereign*. One scroll. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Cavern Mystery Section*, *Jade Instructions Category*.\n\n---\n\n**The Jade Canon and Precious Instructions of the Supreme Clarity Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord and the South Pole Primordial Sovereign**\n\nThe Supreme Tenuity Emperor Lord, formed by the Great One, the inner spirits of the Purple Origin, and the Twenty-Four Perfected Ones, arises from the intermingling of qi, governing the essence of transcendent ascent. They dissolve the knots of the womb and release obstructions to open the origin. The twenty-four knots and nodes must be commanded by the twenty-four spirits before they can be untied and dispelled.\n\nIf one cultivates and visualizes their names, they will govern and stabilize the entire body, preserving the primordial essence. On the day one seeks to dissolve the knots, one must first invoke them to open the gates.\n\nThe Purple Numinosity is the profound origin of knotted qi, the true spirits that complete the body. They guide clouds and mist, bearing the true smoke of generation, each capable of summoning jade chariots and dragon-riders, arrayed in the thousands, ascending as one body into the dawn of the white sun. This is the Way of the Supreme Perfected Ones’ twenty-four spirits, the method of preserving the mysterious and guarding the origin, by which one ascends to the Jade Clarity and rides the whirlwind.\n\nOne must always settle the body, calm the mind, align the qi, and rectify the form. Closing the eyes to gaze inward, forgetting the body and contemplating the spirits, purifying with ablutions, preserving the spirits and guarding the true—one faintly perceives the threefold entry into the radiant, misty brilliance of the mysterious. Practicing this for eighteen years, the Supreme One commands the Supreme Tenuity Emperor Lord, the Great One, and the Five Spirits to transform and give rise to the Lord of the Mixed Numinous Dao. They summon the Twenty-Four Perfected Ones, accompanied by a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, treading the wind and traveling the clouds, inhaling the flowing rosy clouds, ascending to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nThe Way of preserving the spirits requires avoiding improper associations, retreating into seclusion, nurturing essence and gathering the numinous. With the mind contemplating and the eyes visualizing, subtly guarding the tranquil, calming the hun and settling the form—then the myriad harms will not injure, the hundred ghosts will flee, the thousand demons will not arise, misfortunes will disperse, and calamities will vanish. Its wonders are beyond measure.\n\nFirst, knock the teeth twenty-four times, then proceed with visualization. The *Divine Regulations of the Precious Scriptures of the Most High* states: The method of knocking the teeth—left against left is called \"Breaking the Heavenly Bell\"; right against right is called \"Striking the Heavenly Chime\"; upper and lower center against each other is called \"Resounding the Heavenly Drum.\" If suddenly encountering inauspicious omens or malevolence, one should break the Heavenly Bell ten times. When traversing mountains and repelling evil spirits with mighty invocations, one should strike the Heavenly Chime. When visualizing and invoking the Dao to summon the true and attract the numinous, one should resound the Heavenly Drum.\n\nThough the act of knocking the teeth is singular, in truth, it involves left, right, upper, and lower. Thus, malevolence fears the sound of the Heavenly Bell, mountain spirits are subdued by the resonance of the Heavenly Chime, and the summoning of spirits is solemnized by the thunder of the Heavenly Drum. The mysterious notes have their measures, subtly resonating within; they cannot be sought through careless transmission nor attained by mere chance. Whether in a thousand or ten thousand instances, all must follow this principle—the method of knocking the teeth unfolds, and the sounds of the bell and drum are distinct.\n\nTherefore, the methods of the Dao must not be violated or confused, nor should techniques be mixed or disordered. Violation and confusion lead to obscurity and failure; disorder and chaos result in slander and ruin. It is not that the profound lacks coherence, but that practice lacks proper sequence. The failure of the Dao and the inefficacy of affairs stem from seekers of the true not obtaining the proper method, treading the edge of the path and erring in their approach.\n\nBreaking the Heavenly Bell thirty times refers to performing this alone to dispel inauspiciousness without other invocations. If following a specific practice, one should knock the teeth according to the prescribed number in the text, not necessarily breaking it thirty times.\n\nThe brain spirit is named Awakened Origin Lad, styled Dao Capital. Its form is one cun and one fen in length, of pure white color.\n\nThe hair spirit is named Mysterious Patterned Florescence, styled Dao Balance. Its form is two cun and three fen in length, of dark color.\n\nThe skin spirit is named Universal Uniter, styled Dao Link. Its form is one cun and five fen in length, of yellow color.\n\nThe eye spirit is named Numinous Overseer of Life, styled Dao Youth. Its form is two cun and five fen in length, clad in five-colored garments.\n\nThe neck marrow spirit is named Numinous Plan Cover, styled Dao Circumference. Its form is five cun and three fen in length, of white color.\n\nThe spinal spirit is named Beneficial Sequence Support, styled Dao Pillar. Its form is three cun and five fen in length, clad in plain white jade garments.\n\nThe nose spirit is named Central Dragon Jade, styled Dao Subtlety. Its form is two cun and five fen in length, clad in garments of blue, yellow, and white.\n\nThe tongue spirit is named Originating Beam Peak, styled Dao Fork. Its form is seven cun in length, clad in red garments.\n\nFirst, visualize the names of the eight numinous lads of the upper body’s eight luminous spirits, imagining them in infant form, faintly present within the body, each residing in its proper place. Upon completion, knock the teeth eight times, swallow saliva eight times, and softly invoke:\n\n*\"The eight spirits of the upper luminous realm unite and enter the body. The Emperor Lord and Mysterious Mother, the Five Spirits each arrayed, lift the form and transform it, flowing and changing to attain the true. A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders together ascend to the imperial dawn. The White Origin and Non-Ultimate guide and nurture the Grand Guest. The eight numinous ones flank the body, jade radiance bearing mist. In ten cycles of vagueness, they pass directly through the gate of the sun.\"*\n\nAt the beginning of visualization, first call the names of the spirits three times, then invoke them. After the invocation, call their names three more times, so that the sound barely leaves the mouth, and the three sections respond in unison. At dawn, midday, and midnight, always visualize the Twenty-Four Spirits in sequence, invoking and calling them as described above.\n\nThe throat spirit is named Hundred Streams Released, styled Dao Passage. Its form is eight cun and nine fen in length, of red color.\n\nThe lung spirit is named Plain Numinous Life, styled Dao Level. Its form is eight cun and one fen in length, of pure white.\n\nThe heart spirit is named Radiant Yang Prosperity, styled Dao Brightness. Its form is nine cun in length, of red color.\n\nThe liver spirit is named Opening Lord Lad, styled Dao Azure.\n\nThe liver spirit’s form is six cun in length, of azure color.\n\nThe gallbladder spirit is named Dragon Virtue Bound, styled Dao Release. Its form is three cun and six fen in length, of azure, yellow, and green color.\n\nThe spleen spirit is named Treasure Origin Complete, styled Dao Ascendant. Its form is seven cun and three fen in length, of yellow color.\n\nThe left kidney spirit is named Spring Origin Upright, styled Dao Minister. Its form is three cun and seven fen in length, of dark color, shifting between white and red, its five colors inconstant.\n\nThe right kidney spirit is named Image Other None, styled Dao Jade. Its form is three cun in length, of white or black color.\n\nNext visualize the Eight Radiant Spirit Youths of the central body, in sequence, each resembling an infant in form, faintly present within the body, each settled in its proper place. When done, knock the teeth eight times, swallow saliva eight times, and softly intone the invocation:\n\nEight spirits of the central radiance,\nFour transformations, nine flights,\nRefining the hun-soul, preserving the body,\nBright radiance shares its splendor.\nThe Lord Emperor unties the knots,\nThe fetal bonds return to the four directions.\nAbove, they commune with the Mysterious Mother,\nDispersing numinous power, releasing majesty.\nAttaining union with the eight spirits,\nTogether we ride in shared flight,\nA thousand chariots, ten thousand riders,\nAscending to the Grand Tenuity.\n\nThe stomach spirit is named Together Come Nurture, styled Dao Unfolding. Its form is seven cun in length, of yellow color.\n\nThe spirit within the hollow intestines is named Omen Knee Health, styled Dao Return. Its form is two cun and four fen in length, of yellow-red color.\n\nThe spirit within the large and small intestines is named Vast Send Remain, styled Dao Kitchen. Its form is two cun and one fen in length, of red-yellow color.\n\nThe spirit within the torso is named Receive Abundance Vigorous, styled Dao Void. Its form is nine cun and one fen in length, clad in nine-colored robes.\n\nThe spirit of the chest diaphragm is named Vast Crystal Abode, styled Dao Surge. Its form is five cun in length, of white color.\n\nThe two flank spirits are named Ward Off False Horse, styled Dao Accomplished. Their form is four cun and one fen in length, of red-white color.\n\nThe left yin and left yang spirit is named Support Flow Rise, styled Dao Jade Tablet. Its form is two cun and three fen in length, of azure, yellow, and white color. In men, visualize it as the left yang; in women, as the left yin.\n\nThe right yin and right yang spirit is named Embrace Manifest Brightness, styled Dao Life. Its form is two cun and three fen in length, of azure, yellow, and white color. In men, visualize it as the right yang; in women, as the right yin.\n\nNext visualize the Eight Radiant Spirit Youths of the lower body, in sequence, each resembling an infant in form, faintly present within the body, each settled in its proper place. When done, knock the teeth eight times, swallow saliva eight times, and softly intone the invocation:\n\nEight spirits of the lower radiance,\nDispersed forms transform into numinous power,\nPurple mist rises thickly,\nContaining origin, guarding essence.\nThe Great One, Primordial Father,\nThe Lord Emperor engenders life.\nSeven flowers reflect the register,\nThe Controller of Destiny records the numinous.\nHun and po are at peace,\nFive flowers nurture brightness.\nA thousand chariots, ten thousand riders,\nTogether with me they advance,\nFirst to the Grand Simplicity,\nThen to salute the Highest Clarity.\n\nThe inner spirit of the Dao Unity is named Escape None Horse, styled Dao Ultimate Life. Its form is two cun and two fen in length, of purple color. In men, it is visualized as the inner spirit of the Dao Unity; in women, as the central numen of the True Origin.\n\nThis is the profound spirit of the body’s utmost root, the supreme numen guarding the center. Next visualize it in the form of an infant, seated peacefully in its place.\n\nWhen finished, knock the teeth thirty times, swallow saliva twenty-four cycles, and softly intone the incantation:\n\n\"Dark Prime’s inner truth,\nNurtures form to serve the dawn,\nMastering the web and its guiding threads,\nNine revolutions, eight spirals,\nOuter stars arrayed in ranks,\nInner halls arrayed in ninefold rows,\nThe Lord Emperor joins in flourishing,\nNine Ways, seven swallows,\nEssence flows forth, inner essence refined,\nHarmonizing to bathe the host of spirits,\nThe five viscera bloom with radiance,\nReversing age to a child’s face,\nA thousand chariots, ten thousand riders,\nAscend with me to heaven,\nTo pay court at the Grand Steps,\nTo bow deeply to Jade Dawn.\"\n\nThis is the precious inner name of the body, the spirit of transformation and life. Without knowing this name, the immortal Way cannot be achieved. If on the day of untying the knots one does not first recite this incantation, the knots will not be undone. Should the knots remain unloosed, the three *hun* will lose their proper state, the Upper Prime’s inner power will be lost, the Five Elders will lose their clarity, and the Lord Emperor will become distant. In men, visualize it as the spirit of a male child; in women, as the spirit of a female child—both share the same name. Visualize the twenty-four spirits: always at midnight, remove the pillow and lie flat, clasp the hands firmly, relax the body, and regulate the breath until it is subtle. Compose the body’s spirits in thought, settle the mind on the Lord Emperor, and cause him to seem as if present in his place. Close the eyes and inwardly behold him. If any are not fully present, then burn incense, sit upright with eyes closed, clasp the hands over the knees, and with focused intent recite the incantations as prescribed. At dawn and midday, visualize the spirits while sitting upright, ensuring no one sees you—always inwardly behold with eyes closed.\n\nOn the first day of the month at midnight, after visualizing the spirits, next visualize within the two eyes a white *qi* the size of a chicken’s egg, suspended before the face. After a moment, it transforms into two luminous mirrors, nine inches in diameter, which shine before and behind, illuminating the twenty-four spirits upon the body with perfect clarity. After a long while, intone the incantation:\n\n\"Great Bright Treasure Mirror,\nDispersing forms and transforming,\nIllumining the primordial spirit,\nSubduing the ten thousand demons,\nSoaring to fly in the Upper Clarity,\nParting the clouds and celestial gauze,\nCommanding the myriad spirits,\nSealing mountains and summoning rivers.\"\n\nWhen finished, practice this once every five days. This is what is meant by \"enveloping and embracing inner essence, gathering and restraining the five spirits.\" By practicing this constantly, calamities will not arise, and one will ascend to the rank of high immortal.\n\nThe method of the \"Brushing Child\" enables one to clearly behold the Lord Emperor’s five spirits and the twenty-four spirits. Always on the *jiazi* day of the旬, the *gengwu* day, at noon, take one *sheng* of pure water and add one *zhu* of true cinnabar. Stir it counterclockwise twenty-one times and intone the incantation:\n\n\"Mysterious Flow of Vermilion Nectar,\nGenerating the eightfold brilliance,\nThe body’s spirits arrayed in ranks,\nAll come to manifest their forms,\nPiercing vision for ten thousand *li*,\nPenetrating the nine numina,\nThe Lord Emperor illumines the child,\nEnabling my supreme essence.\"\n\nWhen finished, face east and wash the eyes with the water fourteen times. Those who practice this constantly will clearly behold the myriad spirits. The incantation should be softly spoken, with the water directed toward the moon’s position.\n\n**The Supreme Perfected’s Inner Record of Divine Immortals**\n**The Supreme Perfected’s Secret Method for Summoning the Five Celestial Bodies and Flying *Hun* in the Grotto Chamber and Six Harmonies**\n\nThe Supreme Perfected summons the five celestial bodies in the Grotto Chamber and registers the flying *hun* in the Six Harmonies’ hidden store of secret methods. From the *Jade Canon of the Numinous Essentials of the Southern Culmen*, the precious method:\n\nAt midnight, in stillness, sit or lie as you wish. Calm the body, purify the heart, relax the breath, and harmonize the spirit. Close the eyes and inwardly visualize: in the west, the Great White Star, positioned above the two eyebrows, called Jade Pendants of the Purple Palace. One *cun* above the eyebrows and one *cun* inward is the Jade Pendants of the Purple Palace. On yang days, visualize the star above the left eyebrow; on yin days, above the right eyebrow.\n\nNext, visualize the north’s Celestial Body Star in the Heavenly Center’s Imperial Realm of the Dark Palace. The Imperial Realm of the Dark Palace is five *fen* straight up from the nose to the hairline, then one *cun* inward.\n\nNext, visualize the east’s Wood Star in the Vermilion Terrace of the Grotto Pass. The Vermilion Terrace of the Grotto Pass is one *cun* behind the eyes and one *cun* inward. On yang days, visualize the star behind the left eye; on yin days, behind the right eye.\n\nNext, visualize the south’s Sparkling Deluder Star in the Flowery Chamber of the Jade Gate. The Flowery Chamber of the Jade Gate is five *fen* inward from the inner canthi of the two eyes. On yang days, visualize the star at the left eye’s canthus; on yin days, at the right eye’s canthus.\n\nNext, visualize the center’s Quelling Star in the Yellow Chamber of the Golden Coffer and Long Valley. The Yellow Chamber of the Golden Coffer and Long Valley is two *fen* straight inward from the center of the philtrum. The star seems suspended above.\n\nWhen the visualization is complete, cause the stars to seem as if occupying their positions. One should feel the five stars emitting rays of light, releasing five-colored mists that penetrate the entire body, inside and out, as if dark star-essences are entering within.\n\nThen knock the teeth five times, swallow saliva twenty-five cycles, and softly intone the incantation:\n\n\"Lofty Purple Palace,\nWithin behold the Lord Emperor,\nGreat One in primordial union,\nGate of the Purple Chamber,\nWithin the gate, radiant brightness,\nThis is the Three Primes,\nThe Three Primes conjoin essence,\nThus arise the five spirits,\nPrecious luminaries spread their splendor,\nEmitting light to guard the dawn,\nEssence transforms and accumulates,\nChanging into an elder,\nHead crowned with a plain cap,\nGreen mantle, crimson skirt,\nRight side bearing flowing bells,\nLeft side girded with the Tiger’s Might,\nHand grasping Heaven’s Steel,\nDispersing blades to fly the celestial bodies,\nFeet treading the flowery canopy,\nSpewing rays to refine the body,\nThe Three Effulgences guard and protect,\nEnabling me to attain the true,\nNurturing the *po*, restraining the *hun*,\nRiding the whirlwind to fly as an immortal.\"\n\nWhen finished, swallow saliva three more times and knock the teeth three times.\n\nThose who can practice this method for fifteen years will be met by the Southern Culmen’s Elder of Cinnabar Mound, the Upper Perfected, who will welcome them with a chariot of green clouds; the Western Culmen’s Elder of Plain Clouds, the Master of the Appointed Time, who will welcome them with a carriage of yellow whirlwinds; the Northern Culmen’s Elder of the Dark Prime, the Celestial Sovereign, who will welcome them with a dragon of dark effulgence; the Eastern Culmen’s Elder, the Duke Who Upholds Yang, who will welcome them with a retinue of azure chariots; and the Central Prime’s Elder, the Supreme Dark Child of the Center, who will welcome them with a canopy of curved dawn. The Five Elders will unite and together ascend to the Purple Void.\n\nPractice this without fail, and visualize with precision.\n\nAvoid treading upon filth, refrain from mingling with the impure, regularly burn incense, and bathe frequently. Those who violate these precepts will wither and decay; those who observe them will ascend as flying immortals.\n\nOnce the visualization of the stars is complete and you harbor a wish, express it immediately after your prayer. Envision the Five Stars dwelling together, entering two *cun* below the nape and spreading one *cun* in each direction, each star like a pellet illuminating the body through and through.\n\nOn the first, fifteenth, seventh, ninth, thirteenth, seventeenth, twentieth, and twenty-fifth days of the lunar month, at cock’s crow, visualize the images of the sun and moon within the *Hun Chamber of the Six Harmonies*. The *Hun Chamber of the Six Harmonies* lies in the small upward curve above the outer corners of the eyes, within the high void. Press upon it, click the teeth, and listen below—where the four convergences stir beneath is the location. It extends one *cun* inward and spans nine *fen* in width, known as the *Mansion of the Hun Chamber of the Six Harmonies*.\n\nWith the sun on the left and the moon on the right, visualize their radiance penetrating the form, ensuring their faint presence in position. Open the eyes and concentrate intensely, allowing no lapse. Upon completion, click the teeth seven times and softly intone:\n\n*\"O Radiant Dawn of the Great Clarity,\nNinefold verdant mist ascends,\nSummoning rosy clouds to conceal their splendor,\nBathing and refining the Five Forms.\nThe palace chariot of the Six Harmonies,\nThe seven spirits in harmonious balance—\nLet me ascend as a flying immortal,\nMy hun-soul mounting the Upper Clarity.\"*\n\nPractice this for fifteen years, and the Jade Emperor will dispatch the *Three Simplicity Chariots* to welcome you. You must train the cock to crow, ensuring it governs the dawn with regularity. Should you conceal the script and practice in secret, you will surely lose the intertwined radiance of the sun and moon.\n\nThe Southern Culmen Lady received this method from the Supreme Lofty Perfected, naming it *The Hidden Way of Dual Radiance and Winged Form*. Only those with true immortal bones may behold this scripture.\n\nFace east toward the *Great Clarity, Primordial Origin, Upper Three Heavens, Boundless Great Dao, and the Venerable Lords of the Multitudes*. Face west toward the *Celestial Masters, Female Masters, Heir Masters, and Lineage Masters—the Three Master Lords*. Face north toward the *Supreme Lord Lao, Supreme Mystery Upper First Lord, and Supreme Venerable Lord*. Face south toward the *Lord of Virtue and the Venerable Lord of Virtue, Lord of Myriad Blessings and the Venerable Lord of Myriad Blessings, Lord of Myriad Lives and the Venerable Lord of Myriad Lives*.\n\nHere ends the *Jade Scripture Precious Formulae of the Upper Clarity Purple Tenuity Emperor and the Southern Culmen Primordial Lord*.",

The Emperor Lord and Mysterious Mother, the Five Spirits each arrayed, lift the form and transform it, flowing and changing to attain the true. A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders together ascend to the imperial dawn. The White Origin and Non-Ultimate guide and nurture the Grand Guest. The eight numinous ones flank the body, jade radiance bearing mist. In ten cycles of vagueness, they pass directly through the gate of the sun.\"*\n\nAt the beginning of visualization, first call the names of the spirits three times, then invoke them. After the invocation, call their names three more times, so that the sound barely leaves the mouth, and the three sections respond in unison. At dawn, midday, and midnight, always visualize the Twenty-Four Spirits in sequence, invoking and calling them as described above.\n\nThe throat spirit is named Hundred Streams Released, styled Dao Passage. Its form is eight cun and nine fen in length, of red color.\n\nThe lung spirit is named Plain Numinous Life, styled Dao Level.

      "translated_text": "When finished, knock the teeth thirty times, swallow saliva twenty-four cycles, and softly intone the incantation:\n\n\"Dark Prime’s inner truth,\nNurtures form to serve the dawn,\nMastering the web and its guiding threads,\nNine revolutions, eight spirals,\nOuter stars arrayed in ranks,\nInner halls arrayed in ninefold rows,\nThe Lord Emperor joins in flourishing,\nNine Ways, seven swallows,\nEssence flows forth, inner essence refined,\nHarmonizing to bathe the host of spirits,\nThe five viscera bloom with radiance,\nReversing age to a child’s face,\nA thousand chariots, ten thousand riders,\nAscend with me to heaven,\nTo pay court at the Grand Steps,\nTo bow deeply to Jade Dawn.\"\n\nThis is the precious inner name of the body, the spirit of transformation and life. Without knowing this name, the immortal Way cannot be achieved. If on the day of untying the knots one does not first recite this incantation, the knots will not be undone. Should the knots remain unloosed, the three *hun* will lose their proper state, the Upper Prime’s inner power will be lost, the Five Elders will lose their clarity, and the Lord Emperor will become distant. In men, visualize it as the spirit of a male child; in women, as the spirit of a female child—both share the same name. Visualize the twenty-four spirits: always at midnight, remove the pillow and lie flat, clasp the hands firmly, relax the body, and regulate the breath until it is subtle. Compose the body’s spirits in thought, settle the mind on the Lord Emperor, and cause him to seem as if present in his place. Close the eyes and inwardly behold him. If any are not fully present, then burn incense, sit upright with eyes closed, clasp the hands over the knees, and with focused intent recite the incantations as prescribed. At dawn and midday, visualize the spirits while sitting upright, ensuring no one sees you—always inwardly behold with eyes closed.\n\nOn the first day of the month at midnight, after visualizing the spirits, next visualize within the two eyes a white *qi* the size of a chicken’s egg, suspended before the face. After a moment, it transforms into two luminous mirrors, nine inches in diameter, which shine before and behind, illuminating the twenty-four spirits upon the body with perfect clarity. After a long while, intone the incantation:\n\n\"Great Bright Treasure Mirror,\nDispersing forms and transforming,\nIllumining the primordial spirit,\nSubduing the ten thousand demons,\nSoaring to fly in the Upper Clarity,\nParting the clouds and celestial gauze,\nCommanding the myriad spirits,\nSealing mountains and summoning rivers.\"\n\nWhen finished, practice this once every five days. This is what is meant by \"enveloping and embracing inner essence, gathering and restraining the five spirits.\" By practicing this constantly, calamities will not arise, and one will ascend to the rank of high immortal.\n\nThe method of the \"Brushing Child\" enables one to clearly behold the Lord Emperor’s five spirits and the twenty-four spirits. Always on the *jiazi* day of the旬, the *gengwu* day, at noon, take one *sheng* of pure water and add one *zhu* of true cinnabar. Stir it counterclockwise twenty-one times and intone the incantation:\n\n\"Mysterious Flow of Vermilion Nectar,\nGenerating the eightfold brilliance,\nThe body’s spirits arrayed in ranks,\nAll come to manifest their forms,\nPiercing vision for ten thousand *li*,\nPenetrating the nine numina,\nThe Lord Emperor illumines the child,\nEnabling my supreme essence.\"\n\nWhen finished, face east and wash the eyes with the water fourteen times. Those who practice this constantly will clearly behold the myriad spirits. The incantation should be softly spoken, with the water directed toward the moon’s position.\n\n**The Supreme Perfected’s Inner Record of Divine Immortals**\n**The Supreme Perfected’s Secret Method for Summoning the Five Celestial Bodies and Flying *Hun* in the Grotto Chamber and Six Harmonies**\n\nThe Supreme Perfected summons the five celestial bodies in the Grotto Chamber and registers the flying *hun* in the Six Harmonies’ hidden store of secret methods. From the *Jade Canon of the Numinous Essentials of the Southern Culmen*, the precious method:\n\nAt midnight, in stillness, sit or lie as you wish. Calm the body, purify the heart, relax the breath, and harmonize the spirit. Close the eyes and inwardly visualize: in the west, the Great White Star, positioned above the two eyebrows, called Jade Pendants of the Purple Palace. One *cun* above the eyebrows and one *cun* inward is the Jade Pendants of the Purple Palace. On yang days, visualize the star above the left eyebrow; on yin days, above the right eyebrow.\n\nNext, visualize the north’s Celestial Body Star in the Heavenly Center’s Imperial Realm of the Dark Palace. The Imperial Realm of the Dark Palace is five *fen* straight up from the nose to the hairline, then one *cun* inward.\n\nNext, visualize the east’s Wood Star in the Vermilion Terrace of the Grotto Pass. The Vermilion Terrace of the Grotto Pass is one *cun* behind the eyes and one *cun* inward. On yang days, visualize the star behind the left eye; on yin days, behind the right eye.\n\nNext, visualize the south’s Sparkling Deluder Star in the Flowery Chamber of the Jade Gate. The Flowery Chamber of the Jade Gate is five *fen* inward from the inner canthi of the two eyes. On yang days, visualize the star at the left eye’s canthus; on yin days, at the right eye’s canthus.\n\nNext, visualize the center’s Quelling Star in the Yellow Chamber of the Golden Coffer and Long Valley. The Yellow Chamber of the Golden Coffer and Long Valley is two *fen* straight inward from the center of the philtrum. The star seems suspended above.\n\nWhen the visualization is complete, cause the stars to seem as if occupying their positions. One should feel the five stars emitting rays of light, releasing five-colored mists that penetrate the entire body, inside and out, as if dark star-essences are entering within.\n\nThen knock the teeth five times, swallow saliva twenty-five cycles, and softly intone the incantation:\n\n\"Lofty Purple Palace,\nWithin behold the Lord Emperor,\nGreat One in primordial union,\nGate of the Purple Chamber,\nWithin the gate, radiant brightness,\nThis is the Three Primes,\nThe Three Primes conjoin essence,\nThus arise the five spirits,\nPrecious luminaries spread their splendor,\nEmitting light to guard the dawn,\nEssence transforms and accumulates,\nChanging into an elder,\nHead crowned with a plain cap,\nGreen mantle, crimson skirt,\nRight side bearing flowing bells,\nLeft side girded with the Tiger’s Might,\nHand grasping Heaven’s Steel,\nDispersing blades to fly the celestial bodies,\nFeet treading the flowery canopy,\nSpewing rays to refine the body,\nThe Three Effulgences guard and protect,\nEnabling me to attain the true,\nNurturing the *po*, restraining the *hun*,\nRiding the whirlwind to fly as an immortal.\"\n\nWhen finished, swallow saliva three more times and knock the teeth three times.\n\nThose who can practice this method for fifteen years will be met by the Southern Culmen’s Elder of Cinnabar Mound, the Upper Perfected, who will welcome them with a chariot of green clouds; the Western Culmen’s Elder of Plain Clouds, the Master of the Appointed Time, who will welcome them with a carriage of yellow whirlwinds; the Northern Culmen’s Elder of the Dark Prime, the Celestial Sovereign, who will welcome them with a dragon of dark effulgence; the Eastern Culmen’s Elder, the Duke Who Upholds Yang, who will welcome them with a retinue of azure chariots; and the Central Prime’s Elder, the Supreme Dark Child of the Center, who will welcome them with a canopy of curved dawn.
