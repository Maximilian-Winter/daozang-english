Author and era unknown. One scroll. Base text from *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Cavernous Mystery Division, *Scriptural Texts* category.\n\n---\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy, seated with the Most High Lord Lao with their crowns properly adorned, spoke of all ordinary beings who rear silkworms and cultivate the five grains—these are the very lifeblood of all sentient beings.\n\nSilkworm eggs emerge from the Purple Tenuity Palace, cherished and reared by the jade maidens of the ten directions. The five grains and silkworm eggs are the foundation of all beings; their cultivation and rearing in the human realm are matters of utmost importance.\n\nLord Lao then addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: \"Excellent indeed, Heavenly Worthy! I observe that the ordinary beings of this world, temporarily dwelling in Jambudvīpa, rely solely on clothing and food to sustain their lives. Tilling the fields is the highest vocation, and silkworm rearing is a teaching of immortals and sages. All meritorious deeds and virtues begin here; both sages and commoners clothe and nourish themselves through fields and silkworms. Filial piety toward parents and the creation of revered images bring abundance in fields, silkworms, and the five grains. If one follows the Dao, elders and kings will be at peace, and the barbarians of the four directions will universally follow the true path. Through the power of this scripture, the people will rejoice, and wind and rain will come in due season. May the five grains flourish abundantly, and may all people follow the Dao, treasuring fields and silkworms as the source of wealth and nobility.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Ordinary beings in the world who harbor malicious envy, scheme against the poor and lowly, steal from the Three Treasures, or pilfer common property—such persons will die and be reborn ten thousand times in a single day and night. Their bodies will be shattered in repayment, and they will suffer calamities. Their descendants will endure illness, constantly encountering misfortune. The ghostly soldiers will punish such evil persons, and even a thousand or ten thousand lifetimes will not suffice to repay their debts to their teachers and the Dao. For every needle and thread stolen, repayment of ten thousand taels of gold will not suffice. If the debt remains unpaid for three years, the debtor will fall ill. In the third month of spring, the demon kings will unleash poison to slay such a person. Those who fail to perform meritorious deeds or practice generosity will remain impoverished, their descendants disfigured, forever unequal to others. Those who slander the Dao and scriptures, speak ill of their teachers, or disrespect their parents will contract incurable white leprosy.\n\nYet if one performs meritorious deeds year after year and practices generosity toward teachers and the Dao, the rewards in fields and silkworms will be ten thousandfold. Those who steal from others and toil bitterly in cultivation do so only to repay past debts. If one desires abundance in silkworm silk and the five grains, one should recite this scripture to gain boundless blessings. Even wicked thieves will turn to compassion, recalling the Dao and their teachers.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy, gazing from the void with the eye of wisdom, naturally perceives all evildoers in the world. Heaven will surely punish them. But those who wholeheartedly revere the Dao will receive immediate rewards in their fields and silkworms, without need for strenuous effort. The Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions will send you good teachers. Heavenly beings will protect you, and you will daily witness wealth and nobility. All your desires will be fulfilled, and neither humans nor ghosts will encroach upon you. Your silkworms will yield ten thousandfold, and whatever you aspire to, demonic influences will vanish, and heavenly spirits will naturally guard you.\n\nYou who rear silkworms, bow in reverence, burn incense, and place silkworm eggs in the four directions and the fields. Then recite the names of the heavenly deities of the ten directions, saying:\n\n*With reverence, I invoke the Azure Emperor of the East and the Ten Thousand Lords of Silkworm Protection to descend into this dwelling as they will;*\n*I invoke the Vermilion Emperor of the South and the Ten Thousand Lords of Silkworm Protection to descend into this dwelling as they will;*\n*I invoke the White Emperor of the West and the Ten Thousand Lords of Silkworm Protection to descend into this dwelling as they will;*\n*I invoke the Black Emperor of the North and the Ten Thousand Lords of Silkworm Protection to descend into this dwelling as they will;*\n*I invoke the Yellow Emperor of the Center and the Ten Thousand Lords of Silkworm Protection to descend into this dwelling as they will;*\n*I invoke the Divine Lords of the Five Directions and the Five Emperors, along with the Ten Thousand Generals and Soldiers of Silkworm Protection, to descend as they will and guard the divine silkworms.*\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"You ordinary beings in the world, I now dispatch the Lords of Silkworm Protection from the five directions to rescue and deliver suffering sentient beings. Yet you, in this world, lack faith in the sagely teachings, and thus you suffer poverty and hardship—lacking clothes when cold, lacking food when hungry, constantly in want. If you desire silkworm silk and the five grains to fill your granaries to overflowing, you should burn incense before the Daoist sanctuary each year, prepare fine delicacies and varied dishes, and offer them to the immortals and sages. Entreat the Three Treasures for silkworms, invite a teacher to your home, and provide them with a hundred flavors of offerings. Recite this scripture, and a hundred demonic and malevolent spirits will not enter your dwelling. Benevolent spirits will descend, bestowing upon you silkworm silk and the five grains. Heavenly beings will deliver them to your home, yielding a thousand-thousandfold increase. You will recall the kindness of the Dao and your teachers.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy, facing east, commanded the demons, saying:\n*\"I address you, devouring ghosts and spectral spirits,*\n*And you, corpse-flying demons of the roads,*\n*Generals of the Five Lands and Three Armies.*\n*If you but act with goodness,*\n*And protect all heavenly beings,*\n*Fields and silkworms will yield ten thousandfold,*\n*Your dwellings will abound with gold and silver.*\n*Malicious gossip will cease,*\n*Surpassing even five neighboring households.*\n*Demon soldiers will sink into the earth,*\n*And your wishes will be instantly fulfilled.*\n*Grain and silk will flow in from the five directions,*\n*And joy will greet you each day.*\n*Recite the scriptures of the Dharma Protectors,*\n*And heaven will send you the seven treasures.*\n*Should demonic forces approach,*\n*Their heads will be split into seven parts.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"If you desire abundance in fields and silkworms, cultivate sincere devotion and supplicate the heavenly deities. The heavenly immortals will descend as you will, bestowing their blessings, ensuring your efforts are not in vain. Present your silkworms to your teacher, who will pray over the silkworm eggs, and their propagation will be blessed by the Dao’s grace. All thousand demons and ten thousand specters, all devouring ghosts, will scatter and flee a thousand *li* from your dwelling when they see the teacher enter. If you perform meritorious deeds when rearing silkworms, not a single silkworm will be lost.\"\n\nBurn incense to the four directions and recite this sutra, and you will immediately receive ten thousandfold recompense. Do not slight your teacher or disdain the sutra, nor steal the Three Treasures of your master—such acts will bring sudden death as retribution. To speak your teacher’s name is to invite the retribution of shortened life. To eat the flesh of others is to invite the retribution of manifold illness. To kill living beings with your own hands is to invite the retribution of owing a life. To engage in malicious speech and sow discord is to invite the retribution of muteness and dumbness. To beat servants and slaves until their backs are broken is to invite the retribution of being reborn as a donkey. To curse and revile on days of abstinence is to invite the retribution of madness. To steal others’ possessions at night is to invite the retribution of being reborn as a rat. To eat alone without calling others is to invite the retribution of being reborn as a pig or dog. To hold the sutra with unclean hands or an impure body is to invite the retribution of festering sores. To cultivate silkworms or harvest grain without giving thanks for the Dao’s grace is to invite the retribution of poverty, cold, hunger, and hardship. To bow without touching your head to the ground is to invite the retribution of being infested with parasites. To fish or dig into burrows is to invite the retribution of a cleft lip. To promise offerings to your teacher but fail to deliver is to invite the retribution of empty harvests each time. To break faith and defy heaven is to invite the retribution of white leprosy. To be obstinate and unyielding is to invite the retribution of blindness. To deceive and betray your teacher’s kindness is to invite the retribution of lifelong illness. To vow to hold a fast but fail to observe it is to invite the retribution of hunger, cold, and nakedness. To recite the sutra without washing your hands or rinsing your mouth is to invite the retribution of perpetual foul breath. To curse and humiliate your parents is to invite the retribution of hellish karma and unfilial descendants for generations.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: \"All ordinary beings commit sins with their own bodies and suffer retribution in their own bodies—there is no leniency. If you desire long life in this very existence, beware of harboring malice toward others, lest you invite poverty, low status, poor silkworm harvests, daily ailments, failed descendants, and all manner of suffering as immediate retribution. If you do not cultivate good deeds, practice generosity, or show kindness, but instead constantly scheme and plot, how can you attain longevity? Sudden death will be your retribution.\"\n\nDay and night, the Heavenly Worthy abides in the void, gazing with the Dao-eye to perceive those who perform good and evil—nothing escapes even the weight of a hair. If a good man or good woman seeks long life and success in fields and silkworms, let them offer incense and flowers to the Three Treasures, the Three Masters, and the Lord of the Dao. The heavenly officials will descend to repay your kindness, and those who pray for blessings will be freed from poison and harm. Whatever you pray for, you will receive profound grace. All violent and devouring spirits and ghosts will be unable to advance; upon hearing the sutra, they will rejoice and scatter of their own accord.\n\nHeavenly beings and heavenly deities repay good with good and evil with evil. If you in this world seek blessings, burn fine incense, express your sincerity, and invoke the myriad good spirits to fulfill your wishes. With single-minded devotion, invite the Protector Spirit King to descend into your dwelling according to your will.\n\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit King, the Great Sage of Longevity of the East, comes to guard and protect.\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit King, the Great Sage of Longevity of the South, comes to guard and protect.\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit King, the Great Sage of Longevity of the West, comes to guard and protect.\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit King, the Great Sage of Longevity of the North, comes to guard and protect.\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit King, the Great Sage of Longevity of the Northeast, comes to guard and protect.\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit King, the Great Sage of Longevity of the Southeast, comes to guard and protect.\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit King, the Great Sage of Longevity of the Southwest, comes to guard and protect.\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit King, the Great Sage of Longevity of the Northwest, comes to guard and protect.\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit King, the Great Sage of Longevity of the Above, comes to guard and protect.\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit King, the Great Sage of Longevity of the Below, comes to guard and protect.\n\nThe Heavenly Kings of the ten directions all descend in flying clouds, crimson auroras, jade chariots, and wheel-like radiance to bestow blessings upon your household day after day, repaying your cultivation of merit. Thus, your efforts in performing good deeds and establishing virtue will never be in vain.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: \"First, contemplate the Dao; second, contemplate the sutra; third, contemplate your teacher. At all times, invoke the Dao and pray for grace—blessings will descend from heaven. Your faithful household will be free from illness, calamity, disaster, and suffering. Whatever you seek will be fulfilled according to your heart’s desire: if you seek sons or daughters, you will receive sons or daughters; if you seek official rank, you will receive official rank; if you seek gold and silver, you will receive gold and silver; if you seek fields and silkworms, you will receive fields and silkworms; if you seek peace and stability, you will receive peace and stability; if you seek extended life, you will receive extended life; if you seek clothing and food, you will receive clothing and food; if you seek long life, you will receive long life.\n\nIf you are about to embark on a journey, the four roads will open before you. Recite this sutra, and you will receive the compassion of the sages. For over a hundred days, you will be free from all unjust harm and will enjoy blessings and protection. If your prayers go unanswered, invoke the Eastern Spirit of Good Dwelling, the Western Spirit, the Southern Spirit, the Northern Spirit, and the Central Spirit. They will remove your misfortunes and harms, and any epidemic or poisonous qi will vanish at once. Official oppression will not arise, a thousand calamities will be severed, and all the myriad ghosts on earth and in heaven will flee to other lands. Jealous ghosts and envious spirits will all be crushed like rats, while mighty spirit kings descend to guard and protect. For those who recite this sutra, blessings will come to fruition, and no misfortune will befall them. You will sit and lie in peace, free from all unjust harm.\n\nThe words spoken by the Heavenly Worthy are without flaw.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: \"You heavenly beings, this sutra is supremely wondrous, its spiritual power boundless. If kept in your home, it will extend your life and destiny, fulfill your desires, and cause evil demons to perish, no longer daring to harm you. If you suffer from grave illness, heavenly youths and maidens will come to heal you, curing your ailments and leaving no injury. No evil will harm you, and the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions will always protect you.\n\nFor those who recite this sutra, their households will be secure and their doors auspicious. Their lives will be long and eternal, free from harm. Wherever they go, the myriad good spirit kings will follow behind, warding off a thousand disasters and preventing ten thousand evils from approaching. Those who study and recite it will have blessings as vast as mountains, and those who listen and receive it will enjoy strength and well-being for ten thousand generations. Whoever holds this sutra will cause a hundred demons to tremble in awe. If you uphold it according to the Dao, your heart’s wishes will surely be fulfilled.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy says: All you ordinary beings, regardless of high or low status, should reverently recite this sutra, and you will naturally find peace and joy. The eight classes of heavenly demons will vanish upon hearing this sutra, while good spirits will guard and protect you. The door gods and household guardians will ward off a thousand calamities. The silkworms you raise will flourish and overflow your home. Gold, silver, money, and grain will be abundant. Sons and daughters will come in succession, and servants of extraordinary form will multiply. A hundred ghosts will flee in haste, while heavenly beings will safeguard you. Silkworm threads will grow ever longer, and no harm or evil will arise. Every wish will be fulfilled according to your heart, for the sacred power and divine efficacy are beyond measure.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declares: All you wandering ghosts of the world who disregard the bright majesty of the Great Dao, who alter your forms and change your appearances—whether becoming monstrous spirits, impersonating family or local deities, assuming various shapes, mimicking the cries of birds, appearing in nightmares, or deceiving mortals to demand blood offerings—you disrupt fields and silkworms, preventing their growth, causing harm year after year. If you do not depart, I shall summon the Nine Million Destroyers of Harmful Ghosts, the Nine Million Binders of Ghosts, the Nine Million Devourers of Ghosts, the Nine Million Beheaders of Ghosts, and the Seventy Million Iron-Faced Soldiers with Lofty Banners, all wielding ghost-slaying weapons with blades turned outward. I shall also call forth the Nine Hundred Thousand Ravenous Ghost-Horsemen, the Four Hundred Thousand Capturers of Ghosts, the Four Hundred Thousand Slayers of Ghosts, the One Hundred Twenty Thousand Breakers of [missing character] Ghosts, the One Hundred Twenty Thousand Gatherers of [missing character] Ghosts, the Three Hundred Eighty Thousand Removers of Stale Qi and Buried Bones from the House, and the Nine Hundred Thousand Severers of Ghosts. Together, they shall descend to eliminate the ghosts of this land for such-and-such a household, scattering and destroying them at once. Should any ghost remain and refuse to leave by rightful means, I shall summon the Hundreds of Millions of Protectors of Silkworms from the Ten Directions to descend and slay them, along with any presumptuous ghosts and the spirits of the Five Lands.\n\nIf tree spirits approach, the Metal Spirit shall slay them. If fire spirits approach, the Water Spirit shall extinguish them. If metal spirits approach, the Fire Spirit shall consume them. If water spirits approach, the Earth Spirit shall sever them. If earth spirits approach, the Wood Spirit shall overcome them. These five ghosts, by the command of the Heavenly Worthy and the authority of the Celestial Master, shall be gathered and dispersed by the spirits of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth, ensuring all affairs are auspicious. Ghosts of waste and depletion, the hundred kinds of demons, the thousand specters and ten thousand goblins, the female spirits and local earth gods—all shall be scattered in the four directions. The central ghosts shall be buried a thousand *zhang* and ten thousand *chi* underground, while guardian spirit kings shall protect the master of the house. Silkworms shall yield a thousandfold, and all goings and comings shall be auspicious. The household-protecting warriors shall dispel harm and remove misfortune. The year’s silkworms shall thrive, and the harvest shall ripen. Every wish shall be fulfilled according to the heart, and blessings shall arrive at the mere thought.\n\nThose who recite this sutra shall have their years extended and their lifespan increased. Their homes shall produce yellow gold, and the earth shall yield treasures. Poisonous creatures and venomous pests shall be driven a thousand *li* away. Heavenly immortals, sacred spirits, dragon hosts, and Brahma assemblies shall all come to hear this sutra. Divine youths from the ten directions shall descend to gaze upon it, and the guardian spirit kings shall surround and protect. This sutra is supremely wondrous, beyond all conception. The great assembly, upon hearing it, shall each bow in reverence, circumambulate the Heavenly Worthy, praise its goodness, and pay homage, vowing to uphold and practice it.\n\nThus concludes *The Heavenly Worthy of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavern Mystery’s Sutra on Raising Silkworms and Cultivating Crops*.",

      "translated_text": "Burn incense to the four directions and recite this sutra, and you will immediately receive ten thousandfold recompense. Do not slight your teacher or disdain the sutra, nor steal the Three Treasures of your master—such acts will bring sudden death as retribution. To speak your teacher’s name is to invite the retribution of shortened life. To eat the flesh of others is to invite the retribution of manifold illness. To kill living beings with your own hands is to invite the retribution of owing a life. To engage in malicious speech and sow discord is to invite the retribution of muteness and dumbness. To beat servants and slaves until their backs are broken is to invite the retribution of being reborn as a donkey. To curse and revile on days of abstinence is to invite the retribution of madness. To steal others’ possessions at night is to invite the retribution of being reborn as a rat. To eat alone without calling others is to invite the retribution of being reborn as a pig or dog. To hold the sutra with unclean hands or an impure body is to invite the retribution of festering sores. To cultivate silkworms or harvest grain without giving thanks for the Dao’s grace is to invite the retribution of poverty, cold, hunger, and hardship. To bow without touching your head to the ground is to invite the retribution of being infested with parasites. To fish or dig into burrows is to invite the retribution of a cleft lip. To promise offerings to your teacher but fail to deliver is to invite the retribution of empty harvests each time. To break faith and defy heaven is to invite the retribution of white leprosy. To be obstinate and unyielding is to invite the retribution of blindness. To deceive and betray your teacher’s kindness is to invite the retribution of lifelong illness. To vow to hold a fast but fail to observe it is to invite the retribution of hunger, cold, and nakedness. To recite the sutra without washing your hands or rinsing your mouth is to invite the retribution of perpetual foul breath. To curse and humiliate your parents is to invite the retribution of hellish karma and unfilial descendants for generations.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: \"All ordinary beings commit sins with their own bodies and suffer retribution in their own bodies—there is no leniency. If you desire long life in this very existence, beware of harboring malice toward others, lest you invite poverty, low status, poor silkworm harvests, daily ailments, failed descendants, and all manner of suffering as immediate retribution. If you do not cultivate good deeds, practice generosity, or show kindness, but instead constantly scheme and plot, how can you attain longevity? Sudden death will be your retribution.\"\n\nDay and night, the Heavenly Worthy abides in the void, gazing with the Dao-eye to perceive those who perform good and evil—nothing escapes even the weight of a hair. If a good man or good woman seeks long life and success in fields and silkworms, let them offer incense and flowers to the Three Treasures, the Three Masters, and the Lord of the Dao. The heavenly officials will descend to repay your kindness, and those who pray for blessings will be freed from poison and harm. Whatever you pray for, you will receive profound grace. All violent and devouring spirits and ghosts will be unable to advance; upon hearing the sutra, they will rejoice and scatter of their own accord.\n\nHeavenly beings and heavenly deities repay good with good and evil with evil. If you in this world seek blessings, burn fine incense, express your sincerity, and invoke the myriad good spirits to fulfill your wishes. With single-minded devotion, invite the Protector Spirit King to descend into your dwelling according to your will.\n\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit King, the Great Sage of Longevity of the East, comes to guard and protect.\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit King, the Great Sage of Longevity of the South, comes to guard and protect.\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit King, the Great Sage of Longevity of the West, comes to guard and protect.\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit King, the Great Sage of Longevity of the North, comes to guard and protect.\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit King, the Great Sage of Longevity of the Northeast, comes to guard and protect.\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit King, the Great Sage of Longevity of the Southeast, comes to guard and protect.\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit King, the Great Sage of Longevity of the Southwest, comes to guard and protect.\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit King, the Great Sage of Longevity of the Northwest, comes to guard and protect.\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit King, the Great Sage of Longevity of the Above, comes to guard and protect.\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit King, the Great Sage of Longevity of the Below, comes to guard and protect.\n\nThe Heavenly Kings of the ten directions all descend in flying clouds, crimson auroras, jade chariots, and wheel-like radiance to bestow blessings upon your household day after day, repaying your cultivation of merit. Thus, your efforts in performing good deeds and establishing virtue will never be in vain.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: \"First, contemplate the Dao; second, contemplate the sutra; third, contemplate your teacher. At all times, invoke the Dao and pray for grace—blessings will descend from heaven. Your faithful household will be free from illness, calamity, disaster, and suffering. Whatever you seek will be fulfilled according to your heart’s desire: if you seek sons or daughters, you will receive sons or daughters; if you seek official rank, you will receive official rank; if you seek gold and silver, you will receive gold and silver; if you seek fields and silkworms, you will receive fields and silkworms; if you seek peace and stability, you will receive peace and stability; if you seek extended life, you will receive extended life; if you seek clothing and food, you will receive clothing and food; if you seek long life, you will receive long life.\n\nIf you are about to embark on a journey, the four roads will open before you. Recite this sutra, and you will receive the compassion of the sages. For over a hundred days, you will be free from all unjust harm and will enjoy blessings and protection. If your prayers go unanswered, invoke the Eastern Spirit of Good Dwelling, the Western Spirit, the Southern Spirit, the Northern Spirit, and the Central Spirit. They will remove your misfortunes and harms, and any epidemic or poisonous qi will vanish at once. Official oppression will not arise, a thousand calamities will be severed, and all the myriad ghosts on earth and in heaven will flee to other lands. Jealous ghosts and envious spirits will all be crushed like rats, while mighty spirit kings descend to guard and protect. For those who recite this sutra, blessings will come to fruition, and no misfortune will befall them. You will sit and lie in peace, free from all unjust harm.\n\nThe words spoken by the Heavenly Worthy are without flaw.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: \"You heavenly beings, this sutra is supremely wondrous, its spiritual power boundless. If kept in your home, it will extend your life and destiny, fulfill your desires, and cause evil demons to perish, no longer daring to harm you. If you suffer from grave illness, heavenly youths and maidens will come to heal you, curing your ailments and leaving no injury. No evil will harm you, and the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions will always protect you.\n\nFor those who recite this sutra, their households will be secure and their doors auspicious. Their lives will be long and eternal, free from harm. Wherever they go, the myriad good spirit kings will follow behind, warding off a thousand disasters and preventing ten thousand evils from approaching. Those who study and recite it will have blessings as vast as mountains, and those who listen and receive it will enjoy strength and well-being for ten thousand generations. Whoever holds this sutra will cause a hundred demons to tremble in awe. If you uphold it according to the Dao, your heart’s wishes will surely be fulfilled.\"",

The eight classes of heavenly demons will vanish upon hearing this sutra, while good spirits will guard and protect you. The door gods and household guardians will ward off a thousand calamities. The silkworms you raise will flourish and overflow your home. Gold, silver, money, and grain will be abundant. Sons and daughters will come in succession, and servants of extraordinary form will multiply. A hundred ghosts will flee in haste, while heavenly beings will safeguard you. Silkworm threads will grow ever longer, and no harm or evil will arise. Every wish will be fulfilled according to your heart, for the sacred power and divine efficacy are beyond measure.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declares: All you wandering ghosts of the world who disregard the bright majesty of the Great Dao, who alter your forms and change your appearances—whether becoming monstrous spirits, impersonating family or local deities, assuming various shapes, mimicking the cries of birds, appearing in nightmares, or deceiving mortals to demand blood offerings—you disrupt fields and silkworms, preventing their growth, causing harm year after year. If you do not depart, I shall summon the Nine Million Destroyers of Harmful Ghosts, the Nine Million Binders of Ghosts, the Nine Million Devourers of Ghosts, the Nine Million Beheaders of Ghosts, and the Seventy Million Iron-Faced Soldiers with Lofty Banners, all wielding ghost-slaying weapons with blades turned outward. I shall also call forth the Nine Hundred Thousand Ravenous Ghost-Horsemen, the Four Hundred Thousand Capturers of Ghosts, the Four Hundred Thousand Slayers of Ghosts, the One Hundred Twenty Thousand Breakers of [missing character] Ghosts, the One Hundred Twenty Thousand Gatherers of [missing character] Ghosts, the Three Hundred Eighty Thousand Removers of Stale Qi and Buried Bones from the House, and the Nine Hundred Thousand Severers of Ghosts. Together, they shall descend to eliminate the ghosts of this land for such-and-such a household, scattering and destroying them at once. Should any ghost remain and refuse to leave by rightful means, I shall summon the Hundreds of Millions of Protectors of Silkworms from the Ten Directions to descend and slay them, along with any presumptuous ghosts and the spirits of the Five Lands.\n\nIf tree spirits approach, the Metal Spirit shall slay them. If fire spirits approach, the Water Spirit shall extinguish them. If metal spirits approach, the Fire Spirit shall consume them. If water spirits approach, the Earth Spirit shall sever them. If earth spirits approach, the Wood Spirit shall overcome them. These five ghosts, by the command of the Heavenly Worthy and the authority of the Celestial Master, shall be gathered and dispersed by the spirits of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth, ensuring all affairs are auspicious. Ghosts of waste and depletion, the hundred kinds of demons, the thousand specters and ten thousand goblins, the female spirits and local earth gods—all shall be scattered in the four directions. The central ghosts shall be buried a thousand *zhang* and ten thousand *chi* underground, while guardian spirit kings shall protect the master of the house. Silkworms shall yield a thousandfold, and all goings and comings shall be auspicious. The household-protecting warriors shall dispel harm and remove misfortune. The year’s silkworms shall thrive, and the harvest shall ripen. Every wish shall be fulfilled according to the heart, and blessings shall arrive at the mere thought.\n\nThose who recite this sutra shall have their years extended and their lifespan increased. Their homes shall produce yellow gold, and the earth shall yield treasures. Poisonous creatures and venomous pests shall be driven a thousand *li* away. Heavenly immortals, sacred spirits, dragon hosts, and Brahma assemblies shall all come to hear this sutra. Divine youths from the ten directions shall descend to gaze upon it, and the guardian spirit kings shall surround and protect. This sutra is supremely wondrous, beyond all conception. The great assembly, upon hearing it, shall each bow in reverence, circumambulate the Heavenly Worthy, praise its goodness, and pay homage, vowing to uphold and practice it.\n\nThus concludes *The Heavenly Worthy of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavern Mystery’s Sutra on Raising Silkworms and Cultivating Crops*.",
