At the right side hangs a white jade girdle, holding a tricolored (green, yellow, white) staff.\n\nNext, the master proclaims the dharma rank with great gratitude:\n\n**Disciple of the Upper Clarity Mysterious Capital Three Caverns, Supreme August Supreme Great One Lord, Heavenly Master under the Great One Primordial Lord, Supervisor of the Grand Metropolitan Inspector, Yellow-Red Perfected One of the Three Ones, Venerable One, Boundless Great One *Vajra* Golden Portal Emperor Lord, Three Caverns Dharma Master, Jade Clarity Left Supervisor of the Numinous Grand Master, [Peak] Mountain Master, Lesser Manifestation Perfected One, your servant [Name], bows twice and respectfully addresses the Supreme August Supreme August Heavenly Thearch, Boundless Supreme August Primordial Lord, Great One Primordial Lord Grand Supervisor, Ghost Inspector Perfected One, Heavenly Emperor Great King, Nine Heavens Primordial Cavernous Boundless Great Emperor Lord, Great Emperor Venerable One, Jade Cavern Nine Mysterious Cavernous Perfected Cavernous Mysterious Numinous Treasure Three Sovereigns, Cavernous Divine Cavernous Spring Perfected Lords, Supreme Ultimate Lofty Numinous Supreme Thearch Perfected One, Altar-Supervising Mighty Numinous Great Spirits, Great Cavernous Venerable Spirits, Primordial Lord, Upper Clarity Golden Portal Posterior Sage Emperor Lord, Thirty-Six Divisions of Treasure Scriptures and Talismanic Charts Perfected Lords, Perfected Venerable One, Supreme August Wangchen Void August Great Dao Lord, and the Boundless Responsive and Attuned Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions.**\n\nYour servant, amidst the nine lands, is but a speck of dust, a trifling being. Born in an age of Dao transformation and the flourishing of the true dharma, selected among the seed people to propagate its essential teachings, I have been privileged to partake in the rites of transmission, to glimpse the treasure texts, and to receive the deliverance of numinous officials, generals, officers, and soldiers. Externally, this serves to aid the state, rescue the distressed, and succor the people; internally, it serves to establish merit, protect the spirit, and guard life. The grace bestowed is profound, the favor weighty—beyond what worms and ants can repay.\n\nYet I fear that, since time immemorial, the transgressions of my dark ancestors have accumulated, their faults and errors amassed, and remain unforgiven. My own flaws and blemishes, too, remain unresolved. How could I dare overstep the heavenly statutes and transmit or propagate this teaching? Only by invoking the ancient covenant of the Primordial Mystery, where the five and eight numbers are fulfilled, does the dharma rightfully flow forth. Now, [Name] and others, having purified body and mind, taken refuge in the Great Dao, and presented our vows in sincerity, do solemnly swear before the divine numina. We humbly request to receive the Three Sovereigns’ Treasure Texts and the Cavernous Divine Great Dharma.\n\nHaving examined the words and weighed the intent, it is difficult to refuse or deny. Thus, we now present the revealed text before the altar, praying for a response to confirm its efficacy, that human and divine may commune in harmony, as if in accord with heavenly statutes. On such-and-such a day, we shall ascend the altar to complete the transmission and conferral.\n\nI, [Name], have truly pursued the Dao of my own volition, yearning for longevity and transcendence—not coerced by others nor compelled against my will. May all transgressions and evils I and my kin have committed from the past until now be graciously pardoned and swept away, that I may reform myself and begin anew from this day forward.\n\nI humbly dispatch the Yuan Shi Gong Cao and Fei Yun Shi Zhe to bear this covenant document and proclaim its bestowal. With reverence, I present this petition before Your August Majesty—the Most High, Lofty, and Numinous, the Ten Thousand Saints’ Most Revered, the August Heavenly Supreme Emperor, the Supreme Jade Thearch. May You take pity on my entreaty, grant what I have offered, and permit me to receive and bear this teaching.\n\nI specially beseech that You command the Five Directional Emperors, each to lead three thousand jade boys and jade maidens, to attend the sacred scriptures and protect my person. Further, may You decree the Lords of the Nine Yi, Eight Man, Six Rong, Five Di, and Three Qin, each to lead their respective hosts, to purify the dharma altar, where I shall fast and offer obeisance.\n\nMay I ever emulate the sagely Sovereigns of the Three August Ones, their gaze ever watchful, that my cultivation may attain completion, my merits and deeds become radiant and full. May the celestial officials and numinous immortals promote my virtues and elevate my goodness. May the seven generations of my ancestors ascend to the heavenly halls, and may the accumulated transgressions of past ages be cleansed this day. May I command spirits and ghosts, subdue malevolent demons, become a teacher to heaven and humanity, benefit the people, and aid the state. When my merits are fulfilled, may I be ranked among the immortal grades.\n\nShould I violate this covenant, break my oath, slight my teachers, or disdain the dharma; should my cultivation be careless, harming my celestial authenticity—then may I submit to the Three Officials and endure eternal punishment. If I observe these precepts with reverence and diligence, may the Three Treasures bestow their protection, the statutes and admonitions bear witness. When the appointed term is complete, may I transmit this teaching to the worthy and faithful, perpetuating the great transformation, upholding and sustaining the teachings’ rites. May the myriad numina of heaven and earth witness this solemn vow.\n\nWe, your servants, are overwhelmed with earnest devotion and utmost repentance. With reverence, we submit this petition.\n\nRising, each performs three bows.\n\nNext, take the ritual sash and tie it outside the robe, with the sun emblem at the front and the moon emblem at the rear, knotting it below the heart. Next, place the contract document in a pouch and bind it to the elbow. Next, insert the large-character *Huangwen* into the ritual sash. Next, fasten the Yellow Woman talisman at the waist. Next, bind the Nine Augusts Diagram before the heart. Next, place the Heaven-Water talisman in the topknot. Next, secure the Nine Heavens talisman behind the elbow. Next, tie the Ascension talisman at the waist. Next, place the transmission tablet at the back. Next, bind the *Lingshu* to the elbow. Next, fasten the Cinnabar Script at the waist. Next, arrange the Eight Might and Five Victorious talismans before the heart. Next, hold the Three Ones’ True Form. Next, bind the Youth Register to the elbow. Next, place the talismanic contract at the elbow. Next, affix the Three Augusts’ *Yuezhang* seal at the waist. Next, position the Talisman Envoy talisman beneath the collar at the back. Next, place the general petition tablet upon the tablet held in the hands, gripping it firmly. Men to the left, women to the right.\n\nNext, proceed leftward to the *Shen* Altar’s Earth Gate.\nThe master says: *\"Disciples of the Three Augusts’ Inner Radiance of the Cavernous Divine, [Name] and others, pay respects to the Earth Gate’s Pavilion Chief and Chamber Guardian Spirits.\"*\nBow once.\nThe master says: *\"The August Lord commands that disciples [Name] and others pass through the Earth Gate, dispelling the Five Pestilences, Five Demons, and all calamities of disaster, illness, and plague.\"*\nThe disciples bow again.\n\nNext, exit the Earth Gate and stand at the lower-tier altar’s central position.\nThe master says: *\"Disciples of the Three Augusts’ Inner Radiance of the Cavernous Divine, [Name] and others, pay homage to the Supreme One Lord.\"*\nBow twice.\n*\"To the Supreme August Lord,\"* bow twice.\n*\"To the Heavenly August Lord,\"* bow twice.\nThe master says: *\"The August Lord commands that disciples [Name] and others pay homage to the Supreme One, escaping misfortune and calamity, forever parting from earthly suffering, and eternally preserving celestial blessings.\"*\nThe disciples bow again.\n\nNext, the master instructs the disciples to exit the altar.\n\nNext, the master recites the Twelve Vows.\nThen, return to the incense burner. The Jade Maidens of the fragrant smoke and the attending officials shall transmit the Dao in this place, where the divine mushroom and jade essence spontaneously arise before the Celestial August Lord.\nYour servant and disciples shall be clad in purple mist, their hair concealed in crimson vapor. All beings shall enjoy blessings, and households and nations shall receive grace. The jade maidens attending the ten directions shall transmit our petitions, which shall swiftly reach the presence of the Three August True Lords.\n\nNext, chant the *Hymn of the Wandering Spirits*:\n*\"Vast and blazing is the Court of Broad Cold,\nSerene and empty, the Chamber of Celestial Feasts.\nThe Dark and Mysterious sings the Yang hymn,\nThe Great Radiance parts the clouds to emerge.\nRefining and bathing in the essence of Yang,\nEver chanting the praises of the Supreme One.\nWithout steadfast resolve and wisdom,\nHow could one delight in such wandering?\"*\n\nNext, the disciples descend from the altar.\nThey exit the gate and recite the incantation:\n*\"The Three Mysteries of the Great Void,\nThe Three Origins of the Void-Heaven,\nThe Pure Numinous Jade Maidens,\nThe Seven Luminous and Resplendent Ones,\nHumbly petition the August Lord.\"*\n\nOn this day, month, and year of the reign of [Name of State] in the [Year of the Great Year Star], the [Day of the Month], at the hour of [Time], in the [State], [County], [Village], and [Hamlet], the disciple of the Cavernous Divine’s Inner Radiance of the Three Augusts, born in the year, month, and day of [Birth Year], today at the August Altar of [Location], bows twice.\n\n**First Tablet:** Petition the Heavenly August Lord.\nUpon reading this, bow twice, kneel, and place the tablet on the case.\n*(Ancient method used cinnabar-inscribed jade tablets with characters of red gold; now, cinnabar script is used.)*\n\n**Second Tablet:** Petition the Earthly August Lord.\n**Third Tablet:** Petition the Human August Lord.\n*(The text of each tablet is identical. Each is two feet and two inches in length, two inches and four fen in width, and two fen in thickness. Ivory, jade, gold, silver, or silverwood may be used. Write in five columns, ensuring the script is complete and proper. Once the petitions are presented, the ritual bowing concludes.)*\n\nNext, the master guides the disciples through the Four Gates to resolve calamities, descending to the southwest Moon Gate beneath the central altar.\nThe master says: *\"Disciples of the Cavernous Divine’s Inner Radiance of the Three Augusts, [Name] and others, pay homage to the Supreme Yin Moon Lord.\"*\nBow twice.\nThe master says: *\"The August Lord commands that disciples [Name] and others pass through the calamity of the Supreme Yin’s water disaster.\"*\nThe disciples bow again.\nNext, proceed to the northeast Human Gate.\n\nThe master says: *\"Disciples of the Cavernous Divine’s Inner Radiance of the Three Augusts, [Name] and others, pay homage to the Supreme Yang Sun Lord.\"*\nThe disciples bow twice.\nThe master says: *\"The August Lord commands that disciples [Name] and others pass through the calamities of the Sun Gate—mountain forests, penal prisons, tigers, wolves, and venomous creatures.\"*\nThe disciples bow again.\n\nNext, proceed to the left toward the Celestial Gate.\nThe master says: *\"Disciples of the Cavernous Divine’s Inner Radiance of the Three Augusts, [Name] and others, pay homage to the Celestial Gate Lord.\"*\nThe disciples bow twice.\nThe master says: *\"The August Lord commands that disciples [Name] and others pass through the calamities of the Celestial Gate—blades, weapons, executions, and slaughter.\"*\nThe disciples bow again.\n\nWithout the Inner Radiance of the Supreme Mystery, the numinous essence of True Origin protects this servant’s body, so that morning and evening invocations resound to the exalted ones. Calamities are transcended, and the attainment of divine transcendence is secured, to behold the Lord of the Purple Court of the Great One and ultimately merge with the formless, uniting with the Dao in truth.\n\nNext, the master leads the disciples in praise to the Mystic Master, dispersing as in the usual rites.\nIf performing the Offering of Registers, proceed to the Offering before the Twelve Vows; or if the Offering was completed the previous morning, next present the memorial to report merits.\n\nThe *Transmission Rites of the Supreme Cavernous Divine Three Augusts* concludes.",
