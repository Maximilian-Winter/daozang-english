  "full_translation": "**Preface to the *Nanhua Zhenjing Zhangju Yinyi* (Exegetical Notes and Phonetic Glosses on the *True Scripture of Southern Florescence*)**\nBy Bixuzi\n\nThe Grand Historian states: Zhuangzi once served as the warden of Meng’s Lacquer Garden and composed a work of over one hundred thousand characters. The *Han Shu: Yiwen Zhi* records fifty-two chapters of the *Zhuangzi*. The *Sui Shu: Jingji Zhi* notes Xiang Xiu’s commentary in twenty fascicles, Guo Xiang’s in thirty-three fascicles, and further that Liang Qian compiled the *Nanhua Lun* in twenty-five fascicles. Tao Hongjing’s preface to the *Zhen’gao* states: Zhuangzi received esoteric teachings from Master Changsang and composed the seven *Inner Chapters*, each titled with three characters—modeled after the revolving jade rings of the celestial sphere and the radiant brilliance of the Three Luminaries. Thus, when Hongjing composed the *Zhen’gao*, he arranged it into seven sections, likewise using three-character headings. His writings evidently followed this tradition.\n\nDuring the Tianbao era of the Tang, an imperial edict decreed that Zhuangzi’s work should retain its former title, *True Scripture of Southern Florescence*, from which we know the significance of *Nanhua* has endured since antiquity. From my youth, I have delighted in reciting this scripture. When not occupied with worldly affairs, I would unroll the scroll and read—such is the vocation of Daoists, who seek longevity and enduring vision, forgetting both praise and blame while trusting in the Dao. How can this be compared to those who rely on external conditions?\n\nNow, I have compiled exegetical notes, dividing the text into seven fascicles. This involves parsing chapters and distinguishing sentences, tracing the intricate branches of its discourse. The seven *Inner Chapters*—*Free and Easy Wandering*, *On the Equality of Things*, *The Secret of Caring for Life*, *The Human World*, *Signs of Full Virtue*, *The Great and Venerable Teacher*, and *Fit for Emperors and Kings*—are the very ones named by the Lacquer Garden master. The remaining chapters take their titles from the first two or three characters of each, comprising fifteen *Outer Chapters* and eleven *Miscellaneous Chapters*. Some claim the *Outer* and *Miscellaneous Chapters* were edited by Guo Xiang. However, Tao Hongjing states that Zhuangzi authored the *Inner* and *Outer Chapters* without mentioning the *Miscellaneous*. Examining earlier commentaries, I find them often cursory and difficult to verify. Here, I have selected twenty-six chapters, using two-character headings for those that form complete sections—*Webbed Toes*, *Horses’ Hooves*, *Opening Trunks*, *Engraving Intent*, *Mending Nature*, *Discourse on Swords*, and *The Old Fisherman*—to pair with the *Inner Chapters* as the *Outer Chapters*. The remaining nineteen—*Yielding the Throne*, *Robber Zhi*, *In the Realm of*, *Heaven and Earth*, *The Way of Heaven*, *The Revolution of Heaven*, *Autumn Floods*, *Perfect Happiness*, *Mastering Life*, *The Mountain Tree*, *Master Tian*, *Knowledge Wanders North*, *Gengsang Chu*, *Xu Wugui*, *Zeyang*, *External Things*, *Parables*, *Lie Yukou*, and *The World*—alternate like odd and even numbers, their titles drawn from figures or events, their principles aligning with the numerology of yin and yang, their meanings resonating with the subtleties of speech and silence. Thus, they are called the *Miscellaneous Chapters*.\n\nWithin these thirty-three chapters, I have divided the text into 250 sections, assigning titles based on their themes, designating them as *Zhangju* (Exegetical Notes). Beneath each section, I provide phonetic glosses, exegetical explanations, and clarifications of allusions, labeling them as *Zhangyi* (Sectional Meanings). Upon completion, I tallied the characters in the main text, totaling 65,923—four-tenths fewer than Sima Qian’s record. I further collated the *Baowen Tonglu* from the Central Taiyi Palace, which contained several versions of the *Zhuangzi*, along with hand-copied manuscripts from my satchel. Comparing these with the 1004 edition printed by the Directorate of Education, I found 349 discrepancies. Additionally, I consulted other commentaries to address lacunae and errors in one fascicle, resolving doubts and including three chapters by Gongsun Long for reference.\n\nAlas! Later scholars are unfortunate not to witness the complete bamboo slips of the Lacquer Garden or grasp the grand purport of its chapters—its profound insights have gradually been fragmented by various schools.\n\nComposed on the Lantern Festival of the Jiazi year of the Yuanfeng era.\n\n**Nanhua Zhenjing Zhangju Yinyi, Fascicle One**\n\nZhuangzi’s surname was Zhuang, his given name Zhou, and he was also styled Zixiu. A native of Mengcheng in Song, he lived contemporaneously with King Hui of Liang and King Wei of Qi. He once served as the Keeper of the Lacquer Garden. His teacher was Gongsun Long, from whom he received esoteric teachings. He composed a work of over one hundred thousand characters, which he titled *Nanhua*. His scholarship was rooted in the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, and he also studied under the Chu master Juan Yuan. Later, he secluded himself on Mount Baodu, where he ingested the Northern Nurturing Fire Elixir, ascended to heaven in broad daylight, and was appointed as a Compiling Gentleman in the Pavilion of the Supreme Ultimate. On the fourth day of the fifth month in the nineteenth year of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, the Minister of the Court Pei Guangting requested the canonization of the Four Masters. On the twentieth day of the second month in the first year of the Tianbao era, an imperial edict decreed that Zhuangzi’s work retain its original title, *Nanhua Zhenjing* (*True Scripture of Nanhua*); Wenzi’s work be titled *Tongxuan Zhenjing* (*True Scripture of Pervading Mystery*); Liezi’s work be titled *Chongxu Zhenjing* (*True Scripture of Soaring Emptiness*); and Gengsangzi’s work be retitled *Dongling Zhenjing* (*True Scripture of Penetrating Spirit*). The title *Nanhua* signifies the radiance of separation, the flourishing essence that reveals the subtleties of the Dao.\n\n**Inner Chapters: \"Free and Easy Wandering\" (1)**\nThe seven titles of the Inner Chapters were bestowed by the Lacquer Garden. Only when one is free of self can merit and fame dissolve, and only then may one speak of \"free and easy wandering.\" The *Free and Easy Wandering* chapter is placed first because, though it strides beyond the mundane, it still harbors pride and boasting, and thus is followed by *The Equality of Things*. \"Equality\" means forgetting things to achieve self-equality; those who have not yet attained equality still engage in debates of self and other. When self and other revolve in cycles, entering the emptiness within the cycle brings equality. Those who equalize through emptiness have yet to recognize the master of life and death, so this is followed by *The Secret of Caring for Life*. The \"master\" is the true lord of spirit and bone. The body is like firewood, and the master is like fire. One who preserves fire relies on firewood, but when the firewood is exhausted, the fire dies. Only the adept in nurturing remains unaware of its end. Yet there are those who shine alone and cannot join the multitude, so this is followed by *The World of Men*. One who dwells in filth without contamination excels in harmonizing light and dust, and by harmonizing with dust, one attains virtue, hence the next chapter, *The Sign of Fullness of Virtue*. When virtue takes form, things are forgotten. Only those who remain obscure preserve their talents in full, and with talents complete, one may become a teacher, hence *The Great and Venerable Teacher*. The true teacher is none other than the perfected person. How could the perfected person possess a heart-mind? Without a heart-mind, one may assist in the transformations of creation, hence *Responding to Emperors and Kings*. Emperors and kings are the source of the great Dao, the masters of teaching and transformation, occupying one of the Four Greatnesses and presiding as the most honored over the myriad things. Vast and profound, their appearance cannot be fathomed by physiognomists. The chapters from *Webbed Toes* onward lack distinct thematic significance and are arranged to elaborate and amplify the subtleties of the seven Inner Chapters.\n\n**Annotations on \"Free and Easy Wandering\"**\n*Beiming* (Northern Darkness) is also written as *溟* (*míng*), pronounced like *觅经* (*mì jīng*). Xi Kang states it signifies \"boundless and vast.\" Emperor Jianwen of Liang says *窅冥* (*yǎo míng*), meaning \"without limit.\" *Kun* (鯤) is pronounced *gǔn* (公浑切). The *Erya* defines it as \"fish roe.\" The name *Kun* refers to the initial transformation of fish eggs, before they differentiate into whale or loach, embodying the meaning of primordial unity, hence \"hún ěr\" (混尔). When the *Kun* grows large, it spans thousands of *li* without measure.\n\n*Peng* (鵬) was originally written as *朋* (*péng*), implying the meaning of \"companionship,\" hence its sound does not differ from other birds. It signifies \"a flock of companions.\" When the *Peng* takes flight, it spans thousands of *li* without measure.\n\n*Nanming* (Southern Darkness) refers to the Southern Sea, analogous to *Beiming* (Northern Darkness).\n\n*Qi Xie* (齐谐) is pronounced *hù jiē* (户皆切). Sima Biao says it is a person’s name; Emperor Jianwen says it is a book’s title.\n\n*Bo* (搏) is pronounced *tú duān* (徒端切), referring to a bird flying through the air, using its claws to strike the wind and propel itself upward.\n\n*Fuyao* (扶摇): The *Erya* defines it as a whirlwind.\n\n*Xie* (邪) is pronounced *yé* (也嗟切), an auxiliary particle indicating uncertainty, as in subsequent instances.\n\n*Shi er yi yi* (是而已矣) follows the *Wen Ruhai* edition; older versions write *则* (*zé*).\n\n*Aotang* (坳堂) is pronounced *yú jiāo* (於交切).

Sima [Biao] says it means \"to break.\"\n\n*Guan* (关) is pronounced *yú gé* (於葛切).

The *Maoshi Caomu Shu* states that *hú jiū* (鹘鸠) is a turtledove.\n\n*Wo jue* (我决) is pronounced *xǐ quē hū* (喜缺乎), *jué* (决) as *xué* (穴二切). Li [Yi] says it means \"swift.\"\n\n*Qiang* (抢) is pronounced *qī liáng* (七良切). Sima [Biao] says it means \"to gather\"; Cui [Yun] says \"to attach\"; Zhi Dun says \"to collide.\"\n\n*Yu* (榆) is pronounced *yú* (踰), the name of a tree.\n\n*Fang er zhi* (枋而止) is pronounced *fāng* (方), with *fang* (枋) as *fāng* (方). Li [Yi] says it is a sandalwood tree. The *Wen Ruhai* and the ancient Jiangnan manuscript read *抢榆枋而止* (*qiāng yú fāng ér zhǐ*).\n\n*Kong* (控) is pronounced *kǔ gòng* (苦贡切). Sima [Biao] says it means \"to cast\" or \"to draw.\"\n\nCui [Yun] says it means \"to knock.\"\n\n*Mǎng* (莽) is pronounced *mò làng* (莫浪) or *mò lǎng* (莫朗二切). *Cāng* (苍) is pronounced *qī dàng* (七荡切), or as the character itself.

Sima [Biao] says it is \"dog's ear fungus,\" growing on dung in overcast weather and perishing at sunrise. Also called *bái jí* (白及), it knows neither the beginning nor the end of a month. Cui [Yun] says it is a dung-born fungus, sprouting at dawn and dying by dusk—those that appear at dusk do not live to see the next dawn, and those that appear at dawn do not live to see dusk. Zhi Dun says it is the morning glory, blooming at dawn and withering by dusk. Pan Ni says it is the \"platform of ten thousand trees.\" The *Wen* text calls it a \"suddenly sprouting fungus.\" *Huì* (晦) means \"darkness,\" and *shuò* (朔) means \"dawn.\"\n\n*Huì* (蟪) is pronounced *huì* (惠). *Gū* (蛄) is pronounced *gū* (姑). Sima [Biao] says *huì gū* (蟪蛄) is the winter cicada, also called *dì liáo* (蝭蟧). Those born in spring die in summer, and those born in summer die in autumn. Cui [Yun] calls it *diāo liáo* (蛁蟧). Some say it is the mountain cicada—those that sing in spring do not live to autumn, and those that sing in autumn do not live to winter. The *Chu Ci* calls it the \"cold cicada,\" while others say it is the summer cicada, born in wheat stalks (also called *mài jié* [麦节]), living from summer to autumn. Thus, it knows neither spring nor autumn.\n\n*Míng líng* (冥灵) was originally written as *míng* (榠). Li [Yi] says it is the name of a tree growing in Jiangnan, where the sprouting of leaves marks spring and their falling marks autumn. This tree counts two thousand years as one year. *Dà chūn* (大椿) is pronounced *chǒu lún* (丑伦切). Li [Yi] says it grows in Jiangnan, while others say it grows in the north. This tree counts thirty-two thousand years as one year. \"This is a great span of years\"—this line was originally missing in the *Chengben*.\n\nPeng Zu, as recorded by Cheng [Gong], was surnamed *Jiān* (籛) and named *Kēng* (铿), a distant descendant of Emperor Ku. Skilled in nurturing life and regulating the cauldron, he presented pheasant soup to Yao. Yao, recognizing his mastery of flavors and thus his ability to cultivate life, believed one who could nurture life could also nurture others, and enfeoffed him at Pengcheng. His Way was worthy of being ancestral, hence the name Peng Zu. He lived through the Xia and Shang dynasties into the Zhou, reaching eight hundred years of age.\n\n*Tè wén* (特闻) in Cui’s version reads *dài wén* (待闻). *Jí biàn xiāo yáo* (极变逍遥):\n\nThe *Tang Shi Ji* states that in the system of posthumous names, \"Tang\" means \"to eliminate cruelty and remove tyranny.\" A descendant of Emperor Ku and scion of Xie, [Tang] was surnamed *Zi* (子) and named *Tiān Yǐ* (天乙). Possessing sagely virtue, he banished Jie to Nanchao.\n\n*Jí* (棘) was a worthy of the Tang era, a man of vast knowledge. *Qióng fà* (穷发): Cui [Yun] says it is the barren northern land without vegetation, where mountains take grass and trees as their \"hair.\"\n\n*Yáng jiǎo* (羊角): Sima [Biao] says it refers to wind curling upward like a ram’s horns. *Chì* (斥) is pronounced *chāng shí* (昌石切), meaning \"to point\" or \"to name\"; some say it means \"great.\" *Yàn* (鴳) is also written as *yàn* (鴳), pronounced *yú liàn* (於练切), a type of sparrow.\n\n*Áo xiáng* (翱翔) is pronounced *wǔ dāo* (五刀切), meaning \"to wheel in flight.\" *Xíng* (行) is pronounced *xià mèng* (下孟切). *Bǐ* (比) is pronounced *pí zhì* (毗至) or *fú zhì* (扶至二切). Li [Yi] says it means \"to join.\" In the *Yupian*, it is pronounced *néng* (能), *nú dēng* (奴登切). The *Shuowen* says it is a kind of bear, with deer-like feet and a sturdy body, hence called \"capable\" (*néng*). Some read it as the character itself, meaning \"then\" or \"peace,\" as in the *Yi*: \"It is fitting to establish a lord, yet not at ease.\" Zheng’s reading is not followed here.\n\n*Zhēng* (征) is read as the character itself; Sima [Biao] says it means \"trust,\" while Cui [Yun] says it means \"to complete.\"\n\nSong Rongzi: Sima [Biao] says he was a worthy man of Song. *Yóu rán xiào zhī* (犹然笑之): Li [Yi] says it means \"to regard as laughable.\" *Jiā jǔ* (加沮) is pronounced *cí lǚ* (慈吕切), meaning \"to defeat.\"\n\n\"Shuòshuò\" is pronounced *shuò* (朔), with the same pronunciation below. Sima [Biao] says it means \"like *jíjí* (汲汲, hurriedly)\"; Cui [Yun] says it conveys a sense of urgency. [Emperor] Jianwen reads it as *suǒ* (所渝切), meaning \"to calculate.\"\n\nLiezi: Li [Yi] says he was a man of Zheng, named Yǔkòu (圄寇), or sometimes written as Yùkòu (御寇). He attained the art of riding the wind and traveling upon it, and was a contemporary of Duke Mu of Zheng. Lu Ji’s *Yaolan* states that Liezi rode the wind regularly on the day of *Lìchūn* (立春), journeying to the Eight Wastes. *Língrán* is pronounced *líng* (零). Cheng [Xuanying] says it describes a light and soaring appearance.\n\nThe Six Qi: wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and fire are called the Six Qi. Sima [Biao] says they are yin, yang, wind, rain, darkness, and brightness. *Zhī biàn* is pronounced *píng miǎn* (平免切). *Biàn* means \"to transform.\" Guo Xiang’s commentary states that \"riding the transformations of the Six Qi\" refers to traversing the paths of change. *Wū hū* is pronounced *wū* (乌). Cheng [Xuanying] says it means \"in what\" or \"where.\" *Wú jǐ* is pronounced *jǐ* (纪). \"Free and unfettered without self.\"\n\nYao: In the *Shǐ Lǒng Xū Shì Fǎ* (*Book of Posthumous Names*), \"assisting virtue and transmitting sagacity\" is called *Yáo* (尧). He was the son of Emperor Ku, surnamed Yī Qí (伊祁), styled Fàngxūn (放勋), and possessed sagely virtue. At fifteen, he was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Tang; at twenty-one, he ascended the imperial throne and established his capital at Pingyang. After seventy years of rule, he found Shun, and after twenty more years, he retired. Shun then administered the Son of Heaven’s governance, recommending Yao to Heaven. Yao abdicated for a total of twenty-eight years. He lived to one hundred and eighteen, ruled for ninety-eight years, and upon his death was buried in Yangcheng. In the *Book of Songs*, he is associated with the state of Tang.\n\nXu You: The *Gāoshì Zhuàn* (*Biographies of Lofty Scholars*) states his courtesy name was Zhòngwǔ (仲武), and he was a native of Huaili in Yangcheng. He fled to cultivate the land north of the Ying River, beneath Mount Ji, and was posthumously named Duke Ji. *Juéhuǒ* is pronounced *jué* (爵), or alternatively *zǐ zhào* (子召切).

The *Shuōwén* says it is the *fén* (mole). Li [Yun] says it is the *xī-shǔ* (dormouse). Cheng says the *yǎn-shǔ* is the size of an ox, with a reddish-black color like a river deer, its ears resembling three overlapping shells, a white-tipped tail, and a habit of entering rivers to drink. The *Jīnlóuzǐ* states that in the borders of Jìnníng County, large rats appear, resembling oxen, which the locals call *yǎn-shǔ*. When disaster is imminent, these rats emerge from the mountains to roam the fields, shedding their fur, which transforms entirely into small rats, consuming all five grains.\n\nThe *páo-rén* is pronounced *bāo jiāo* (鲍交切), referring to the kitchen steward. The *Rites of Zhou* includes the office of *páo-rén*.\n\n*Shī-zhù* is pronounced *liù* (六切). The *shī* is the spirit tablet in the grand ancestral temple; the *zhù* is the grand invocator. It refers to holding the sacrificial tablet and invoking before the *shī*. Alternatively, it means transmitting the words of ghosts and spirits, called *zhù*.\n\n*Zūn* is pronounced *cún* (存切).

The *Gāoshì Zhuàn* (*Biographies of Lofty Scholars*) states his surname was Lù, given name Tōng, courtesy name Jiē Yú. A worthy recluse of Chǔ, he lived contemporaneously with Confucius but feigned madness and refused office, often tilling the land himself. The King of Chǔ sent an envoy with a hundred *yì* of gold and two teams of four horses to summon him, but he did not respond. Thereupon, he carried his wife on his back and wandered among mountains and seas, their end unknown.\n\nUnworthy is pronounced *dīng làng* (丁浪切).

His father was called Gǔ Sǒu, and his mother, Wò Dēng, conceived him after perceiving a great rainbow. He was born at Yáo Xū and thus took the surname Yáo. Born by the Guǐ River, he was also called the Guǐ clan. His eyes bore double pupils, so he was styled Chóng Huá. His filial piety and benevolence were renowned in his village. Yáo, hearing of his virtue, wed him to his two daughters and enfeoffed him at Yú. At twenty, his filial piety was widely known; at thirty, he oversaw all government affairs; at fifty, he acted as regent for the Son of Heaven; at fifty-eight, Yáo passed away; and at sixty-one, he succeeded Yáo as emperor. His capital was at Pú Jī—some say Píng Yáng, others Pān Pān (now in Shàng Gǔ). After thirty-nine years on the throne, he died while on a southern inspection tour at Cāng Wú’s wilds and was buried south of the Jiǔ Yí Mountains, in what is now Líng Líng.\n\n*Nameless* and *carefree*: The people of Sòng—modern Suī Yáng County in Liáng Guó—were descendants of Wēi Zǐ, the last ruler of the Shāng Dynasty, enfeoffed there.\n\n*Zī zhāng fǔ*: Lǐ [Yún] says *zī* (资) means \"to trade,\" and *zhāng fǔ* (章甫) refers to the ceremonial cap of the Shāng Dynasty—here, using caps as merchandise.\n\n*Yuè* refers to the region of Kuài Jī in Shān Yīn County.\n\nThe term *duàn dīng* (断丁) is pronounced with *tú* (徒) as the initial and *duǎn* (短) as the final; Sīmǎ [Biāo] glosses it as *dūn dūn duàn* (敦敦断), meaning \"to sever decisively.\"\n\nThe *Four Masters*, according to Sīmǎ [Biāo], are Wáng Ní, Niè Quē, Bèi Yī, and Xǔ Yóu.\n\n*Fén shuǐ zhī yáng* (汾水之阳): *Fén* (汾) is pronounced with *fú* (扶) as the initial and *yún* (云) as the final.

It is also called *xiāo*, *xiū*, or by the people of Wú as *□hún*—an ill-omened bird of harsh cry.\" Jiǎ Yí writes: \"The *péng* resembles the *xiāo*, though they are in fact the same creature.\" Another name is *yú hú*, an inauspicious bird.\n\n*Zhī xī* is pronounced *xī*, meaning \"what.\" *Shěn* means \"to discern what sound.\" *Bó* is pronounced *bó* or *bó* (as in *bó zàng*, \"meager burial,\" or *bó guāng*, \"dim light\"). *Yī* means \"clothing.\" *Xié* is pronounced *dié*.

The text means: unlike the *shé fù* or *tiáo yì*, which depend on external conditions, my solitary transformation arises from the natural—what does it depend upon?\n\nTo equalize through transformation—*hú dié* is pronounced *tú xié* (butterfly). *Jiá dié* is the same. *Xǔ xǔ* is pronounced *kuàng fǔ*; the text states: \"the manner of attuning to one’s nature.\" Chéng explains: \"the manner of joyful ease.\" Xú says: \"the manner of delight.\" Cuī’s original text reads *piān piān* (fluttering). *Zì yù*: Lǐ explains it as \"pleasure\"; Chéng, as \"awakening.\" *Zhì* and *yǔ* share the same pronunciation (identical below). *Jué* is pronounced *gǔ xiào*. *Qú qú* is pronounced *qú*; Lǐ explains it as \"having form.\" The text states: \"the manner of astonishment.\" Cuī’s original text reads *jù jù*, citing the *Dàzōngshī*: \"*jù rán* awakens.\" Modern texts also write it as *qú*.

The senses halt at their posts—this is the method. The method lies in knowing when to stop, yet the principle cannot be paused, thus in a single morning he unravels the nine oxen. Yet the spirit desires to traverse the empty hollows, having forgotten itself.\n\n*Pī* is pronounced *bèi jié* or *pū mí*—it means to strike. *Dà què* is pronounced *qù nì*—it refers to the spaces where joints intersect. *Dà kuǎn* is pronounced *kǔ guǎn*—it means hollow. *Kěn* is pronounced *kǔ děng*—it denotes where flesh adheres to bone.

Cuī says it refers to the coiled, knotted bones. *Liáng páo*: *liáng* means good, skilled. To cut—Sīmǎ explains it as using a knife to sever flesh, hence the blade is renewed yearly.

In the time of King Kāng, he served as the Historian Beneath the Pillar; in the time of King Zhāo, he crossed west through the Hánguān Pass, having lived in Zhōu for over two hundred years.

All swords made from it were sharp, and the soil itself was refined and pure. On the mountain lived a beast the size of a hare, its fur golden, feeding on the cinnabar beneath the earth. It burrowed deep into the ground for its den and also consumed copper and iron. Its gallbladder and kidneys were like iron, and the female was white as silver. In the past, the armory of that kingdom had all its weapons and iron implements eaten away, yet the seals remained intact. The king ordered the armory’s den to be searched, and a pair of hares—one white, one yellow—were hunted. When killed and opened, their bellies contained iron gallbladders and kidneys. Only then was it known that the weapons’ iron had been devoured by the hares. The king summoned his swordsmiths and ordered them to forge the gallbladders and kidneys into swords.

Now, those whose nature is rich in benevolence and righteousness inevitably become self-important and lose their nature; those whose nature is deficient in them strive after them and forfeit their authenticity. Racing along the path of self-importance and striving, drifting amid the realm of right and wrong, they vie in boasting and emulation—can this be the true Way of virtue and power?\nIf people abide in their nature, the feelings of \"much\" and \"little\" become one; if things keep to their proper place, the principles of benevolence and righteousness naturally align.

Though the dispositions of the five viscera are not the true Way of virtue and power, they are arrayed in nature and cannot be governed.\"\nNow, to establish the teachings of benevolence and righteousness in order to govern the dispositions of the five viscera is like cutting off supernumerary toes and growths. It injures the principle of nature and only exacerbates the affliction.\n*Ér duō fāng yú cōng míng zhī yòng* – The old text reads: \"Yet they multiply methods in the use of intelligence.\" Zhang Junfang removed the character *fāng*, making it resemble the phrase below, \"excessive in intelligence.\"\nTo pair intelligence with supernumerary toes is to be deficient, for compared to the number of the five fingers, it is called \"lacking.\" To pair intelligence is to be excessive, for it doubles other natures and is called \"redundant.\"\n*Wén zhāng* – Green and red form *wén*; red and white form *zhāng*.\n*Fǔ fú* – Pronounced *fǔ fú*; explained in the \"Da Zong Shi\" chapter.\n*Huáng huáng* – Pronounced *huáng*, meaning \"radiant.\" It also describes dazzling eyes.\n*Fēi hū* – \"Is it not so?\"; to affirm.\n*Lí Zhū* – That is, Li Lou.

In the fourteenth year of Duke Ai of Lu, Tian Chang assassinated Duke Jian and seized the lands from Anping east to Langye as his own fief. From Jing Zhong, who was enfeoffed in Qi, to King Wei, who became the lord of Qi, this spans twelve generations. *Hé cháng bù fǎ shèng zhì zāi* (曷尝不法圣智哉)—originally \"Why did they not model themselves on the sages?\" *Shàn rén bù dé shèng rén zhī dào bù lì, Zhí bù dé shèng rén zhī dào bù xíng* (善人不得圣人之道不立，跖不得圣人之道不行)—Good people cannot stand without the Way of the sage, and Zhi cannot act without the Way of the sage. Thus, the sage’s benefit to the world is slight. *Shèng rén shēng ér dà dào qǐ* (圣人生而大盗起)—When sages arise, great thieves appear. *Péi jī shèng rén, shèng rén yǐ sǐ, shèng rén bù sǐ, suī zhòng shèng rén shì nǎi shèng rén zhī guò yě* (培击圣人，圣人已死，圣人不死，虽重圣人是乃圣人之过也)—Strike down the sage, and once the sage is dead, even if sages multiply, this is the fault of the sages. Those sages are the sharpest tools of the world—from here upward, the eleven sages.\n\n*Lóng Féng zhǎn* (龙逢斩)—beheaded by Jie. *Bǐ Gān pōu* (比干剖), pronounced *pǔ kǒu*—Bi Gan said, \"As a minister, one cannot but remonstrate even unto death.\" He forcefully admonished Zhou, who flew into a rage: \"I have heard the sage’s heart has seven apertures.\" He then split open Bi Gan to examine his heart. *Cháng* (苌), pronounced *zhí liáng*. *Hóng chǐ* (弘胣), pronounced *chì zhǐ*.\n\nChǐ means \"to rend.\" Cháng Hóng was a worthy minister of King Ling of Zhou, a grandee of King Jing, and was killed by the people of Zhou in the sixth month of the third year of Duke Ai of Lu. It is also said that Liu Kang slandered him before the king, saying, \"Cháng Hóng sent a letter to Shu Xiang, saying, 'Raise the Jin troops to attack Zhou, and Jin will kill the Liu clan.'\" King Ling then had Cháng Hóng flayed and killed in Shu. It is also said that he was dismembered by a sword or that his intestines were ripped out—this is called *chǐ*.\n\nZǐxū, pronounced *mí róng chí*. He was torn apart and rotted in the river; the explanation is found in the \"Great and Venerable Master\" chapter.\n\nGù Zhí, pronounced *zhí shí*.

Duke Gong refused to accept the reproach, saying, \"I am a descendant of the Duke of Zhou, elder among the feudal lords, and perform the rites and music of the Son of Heaven. My merit is recorded in the house of Zhou. Though I have already erred in presenting the wine, to now reproach me for its thinness is excessive.\" He then departed without taking leave. King Xuan, furious, dispatched troops with Qi to attack Lu. King Hui of Liang had long wished to strike Zhao but feared Chu’s rescue. Since Chu was occupied with Lu, Liang was able to besiege Hán Dān. This shows how matters arise from one another—it is also a case of resonance.\n\nKing Xuan’s name was Xióng Liángfū, son of King Dao. Duke Gong’s name was Fèn, son of King Mu.\n\nIt is also said that at a gathering of the feudal lords, both Lu and Zhao presented wine to the King of Chu. The wine of Lu was thin, while that of Zhao was rich. The Chu official in charge of wine sought wine from Zhao, but Zhao refused. The official, enraged, exchanged Zhao’s rich wine for Lu’s thin wine and presented it to the King of Chu, claiming that Zhao’s wine was weak. For this reason, Hán Dān was besieged.\n\nPǒu, pronounced *pǔ kǒu*. Strike, pronounced *gǔ lì*.\n\nTo shatter sagely wisdom is what \"abolish sagely wisdom and discard cleverness\" means. *Fàngshě* is pronounced *pǒu*.\n\nWhat thieves and bandits covet are gold and treasures, hence \"do not prize goods hard to obtain.\"\n\nOnce sagely wisdom is dead, great thieves do not arise—daily renewal in the clouds’ work is ever new. The new is life, the old is death, thus \"the sage is already dead.\"\n\nRiding the uprightness of Heaven and Earth, steering the ceaseless transformations of the ever-new, attaining reality while diminishing its name, returning to the true while forgetting its theft—then great thievery ceases.\n\nIf sagely wisdom does not die, great thievery does not end. As the saying goes, \"the sage does not die,\" meaning one clings to the old without daily renewal, is bound by names without creating reality.\n\nIf great thievery does not cease, is this not fitting?\n\nMaking measuring vessels like *dǒu* and *hú* to quantify—from here onward, all illustrate that without the right person, even laws are of no benefit.\n\n*Quánhéng*: Li says *quán* is the weight, *héng* is the beam. *Chuí* is pronounced *zhíwěi*.\n\n*Fújì*: a tally split into two, reunited as one—nowadays, bronze fish or wooden contracts.\n\n*Xǐ*: a jade seal.\n\n*Jiǎo* is pronounced *jūbiǎo*.\n\n*Qiègōu*: a belt hook.\n\n*Jiē* is pronounced *yè* or *liè*.\n\n*Fǔyuè*: an axe.\n\n*Néngjìn* is pronounced *jūzhǎi*.\n\nBelow, \"cannot be prohibited\" is the same.\n\n*Tīyù* is pronounced *chìchì*.

The earthen drum and thistle drumsticks are the music of the Lord of Qi. The *Classic of Filial Piety* states: \"To pacify superiors and govern the people, nothing is better than ritual; to transform customs and alter habits, nothing is better than music.\" Thus, these can govern the world.\n\nBe sure to examine the means by which one attains kingship—through the sagely person’s authenticity in maintaining the self. The remainder is for governing the state, thus every movement and action must be examined therein.\n\nThe \"means by which one attains\" refers to the direction in which virtue extends; the \"means by which one acts\" refers to how one treats others. If actions are taken here, examination is not necessary.\n\nThe Pearl of Marquis Sui: The state of Sui lay near the Han River, where genuine pearls were produced.

In adulthood, he once served as an officer under the Ji family, ensuring fair measurements. He also served as an officer in charge of livestock, which flourished under his care, and thus became Minister of Works. Later, he left Lu, was rebuffed in Qi, expelled from Song and Wei, and beset with hardship between Chen and Cai. Thereupon he returned to Lu, where he was once again treated well. Duke Ding appointed Confucius as governor of Zhongdu. Within a year, all the states followed his example. From Zhongdu, he became Minister of Works, then Minister of Justice, and then acted as regent. When the people of Qi heard of this, they grew fearful, saying: \"If Confucius holds power, Lu will surely become hegemonic.\" Thereupon they selected female musicians and sent them to the Lord of Lu. The Lord of Lu accepted them and neglected state affairs. Confucius then departed and went to Wei—this was his second exile from Lu.\n\nErasing his traces in Wei—meaning to sever all ties. *The Records of the Grand Historian* states: Duke Ling of Wei was aged and negligent in governance, showing no regard for Confucius. Confucius sighed and said: \"If someone were to employ me, in a single month I would set things in order, and in three years, I would achieve success.\" Yet in the end, he was not employed.\n\nFelling the tree in Song—*The Records of the Grand Historian* states: When Confucius was in Song, he practiced rituals with his disciples beneath a great tree. Huan Tui, the Minister of War of Song, sought to kill Confucius. Confucius departed, and later Huan Kui, resenting the place where Confucius had sat, had the tree cut down.\n\nBeset in Shang and Zhou—*The Records of the Grand Historian* states: Shang was the land of Yin, and Zhou was Eastern Zhou. Confucius traveled widely on diplomatic missions and was once distressed in these places.\n\nBesieged in Chen and Cai—*The Records of the Grand Historian* states: King Zhao of Chu sent an envoy to invite Confucius.

The same below.\n\n*Attained his ambition at Qiu Shou*—Sima [Qian] says: \"Gong Bo’s given name was He. He cultivated his conduct and esteemed worthy men, and all the feudal lords regarded him as virtuous. During King Li of Zhou’s calamity, when the Son of Heaven’s line was severed, the feudal lords all requested that he be made emperor. Gong Bo refused and declined the royal throne. After fourteen years of great drought, when houses burned, divination was performed at Taiyang, and the oracle declared that King Li was the baleful influence. Then the Duke of Shao enthroned King Xuan. Gong Bo returned to his clan and roamed carefree, content at the summit of Gong Mountain. Gong is a mountain, now located west of Gong County in Henan. The ancient southern repository reads: 'Gong Bo attained his ambition at Qiu Shou.' One version says 'the summit of Gong Mountain,' or alternatively 'Qiu Shou.'\"\n\n*Shame and disgrace.*\n\n*Fields*—pronounced *quǎn*.\n\nThe ridges of the field are called *mǔ*, and the furrows between them are called *quǎn*.\n\n*Xíng*—pronounced *mèng*.

Desiring to offer his services to Tang but lacking an opportunity, he became a servant of the Youxin clan, carrying his cauldron and chopping board to expound on flavors and persuade Tang toward the kingly Way. Another account says Yi Yin was a scholar-recluse; Tang sent envoys to summon him five times before he consented to go. He then discoursed on the \"Unadorned King\" and the \"Nine Lords,\" after which Tang entrusted him with governance.\n*Zéi* refers to secretly assessing current affairs.\n*Shuòwén*—pronounced *shuò*.\n*Chóu* River—pronounced *zhíliú*.

Another version says it is within Fanyang Commandery.\n*Qínán*—pronounced *nǎi*.\n*Wǒ* means to receive.\n\nThe *Lú* River—pronounced *lǘ*.

This is present-day Fufeng.\n\n**Shū Dàn**\nZhou Gong’s name was Dàn; he was King Wu’s younger brother, hence called *Shū*.

Cheng [Xuanying] explains: \"If I were to coexist with Zhou, I would fear the corruption of my conduct.\" Another says: In the *Yielding the Throne* chapter, many passages emphasize the value of life, yet Wù Guāng and two or three others cast themselves into the water—why? The answer: The rise of Zhuangzi’s writings lies in returning to the root; the means of returning to the root begins with relinquishing glory. Thus, the *Yielding the Throne* chapter establishes a lofty standard of defiance toward the world, its purport being to refuse submission in order to refine custom, not to indulge the self in preserving life. The occasional passages that value life are merely expressions of the intent to abandon glory. Deeply weary of the toils of worldly affairs, they saw them as corrupting. Those of a lesser resolve, though clad in coarse cloth and sipping porridge, merely preserved their bodies. Those who fully embodied the Way stood far above the vulgar, transcending worldly bonds. They would sooner cast themselves into limpid waters than bow to the burdens of the age.\n\nThis was recorded in the old collection of pronunciations; it is copied here for its meaning, though it may not be entirely apt.\n\n*The Southern Florescence: Genuine Scripture – Chapter Sentences, Pronunciations, and Meanings, Volume Six Concluded*\n\n*The Southern Florescence: Genuine Scripture – Chapter Sentences, Pronunciations, and Meanings, Volume Seven*\n*Composed by Master Bi Xu*\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters: \"Robber Zhi\" (Sixteen: \"Following Nature\")**\n\nConfucius and Liuxia Ji were friends. Liuxia Hui—surname Zhan, given name Huo, style Jiqin. Some say his style was Ziqin. He dwelt beneath the willows and extended virtue and kindness. Some say *Hui* was his posthumous title. Others say *Liuxia* was the name of his fief. According to the *Zuo Tradition*, Zhan Qin lived during the reign of Duke Xi of Lu, over eighty years before Confucius’ birth. If he lived until Zilu’s death, he would have been one hundred fifty or sixty years old—impossible to have been Confucius’ friend. Thus, this is a parable.\n\n*Zhi* (跖): *shi* rhyme. Li Qi’s commentary to the *Book of Han* states that Zhi was a great robber of Qin. Master Huang says that Zhi was the younger brother of Ji, named Yong, a great robber.

The *Records of the Historian* state: Zhong You, styled Zilu, was a man of lowly status, crude and fond of strength, with a forthright and unyielding nature. He wore a rooster’s crest as a cap and bore a boar’s tusk as a pendant, bullying and insulting Confucius. Confucius gradually guided Zilu with ritual, and later Zilu donned scholar’s robes, offered his allegiance, and became a disciple. Zilu served as a grandee of Wei. When he heard that Kuai Kui, steward of Kong Kui’s fief, had conspired with Kong Kui to stage a rebellion and install him as Duke Zhuang, Zilu, who was outside, rushed in to confront Kuai Kui. Kuai Kui and Kong Kui ascended a tower, and Zilu sought to burn it down. Kuai Kui, in fear, sent Shi Qi and Hu Yan to attack Zilu, striking and severing his cap’s tassel. Zilu said, “A gentleman dies with his cap intact,” and so tied his tassel before perishing. One version states his body was minced into pickled meat.\nHis end: *zi xu* rhyme.\n\nHis end: *zhu zhuang ju* rhyme. *Zhu* means pickled meat.\n\nExpelled twice from Lu and his traces erased in Wei—already explained in the \"Abdication and Kingship\" chapter.\n\nDestitute in Qi: The *Records of the Historian* states that when Confucius journeyed to Qi, he became a retainer in the household of Gao Zhaozhi, hoping to gain an audience with Duke Jing. He discoursed on music with the Grand Master of Qi, heard the *Shao* melody, and studied it for three months, forgetting the taste of meat. The people of Qi praised him. Later, Duke Jing received Confucius with reverence, treating him with a rank between the Ji and Meng clans. In Lu, there were three ministers: the Ji clan held the highest office, while the Meng clan, though of lower rank, wielded no power—meaning the Duke treated him between these two. When Qi’s grandees sought to harm Confucius, he learned of it. Duke Jing said, “I am old and cannot employ you.” Confucius then departed—this is what is meant by “destitute in Qi.”\n\nBesieged in Chen and Cai—already explained in the \"Abdication and Kingship\" chapter.\n\nYao was not filial and did not cede the realm to Dan Zhu. Shun was not filial—some say he fled from his blind father; others, that he married without informing him. Yu was lamed by his labors in regulating the waters. Tang exiled his lord, banishing Jie to Mingtiao. King Wu attacked Zhou and slew him at Muye. King Wen was imprisoned in Youli. The *Records of the Historian* states that when Zhou minced the Nine Lords, Lord Chang of the West sighed in secret. Chong Houhu learned of it and reported it to Zhou. In the twentieth year of Zhou’s reign, he imprisoned Lord Chang in Youli. Youli was the name of a prison in Heyang, in Tangyin.\n\nAnd *qiang* rhymes with *zhang*.\n\nBao Jiao: Han Ying states that Bao Jiao was a recluse of the Zhou era. His clothes were tattered, his skin exposed, and he carried a basket as he gathered vegetables. He encountered Zigong on the road, who asked, “Sir, how have you come to this?” Bao Jiao replied, “Those who abandon virtue and teaching in the world are many—why should I alone not reach this state? I have heard that one who acts without being known by the age commits reckless deeds, and one who strives without being known by superiors destroys integrity. To persist in reckless deeds and destroyed integrity, yet not desist, is to be deluded by profit.” Zigong said, “I have heard that one who does not belong to the age does not partake of its benefits, and one who defiles his lord does not tread his land. Now you defile your lord yet tread his land, do not belong to the age yet gather its vegetables—whose are these?” Bao Jiao said, “Alas! I have heard that the worthy advance with weight and retreat lightly, while the incorruptible are quick to shame and slow to death.” Thereupon, he cast aside his vegetables and stood erect, withering away by the Luo River. A gentleman hearing of this said, “How unyielding was that incorruptible man! A mountain too sharp will not rise high; waters too narrow will not run deep. One who acts singularly lacks profound virtue; one whose ambitions rival heaven and earth brings misfortune upon himself. Bao Jiao may be called inauspicious. His measure of depth and shallowness led him only to this.” Some say he stood embracing a tree and withered away.\n\nHis end: *shi* rhymes with *si*.\n\nShentu Di: Han Ying states that Shentu Di was a man of the Shang era. Finding the age unworthy, he resolved to cast himself into the river. Cui Jia heard of it and stopped him, saying, “I have heard that the sagely and benevolent, in their place between heaven and earth, are the parents of the people. Now, for the sake of wetting your feet, you would not save a drowning man—is this permissible?” Shentu Di said, “Not so. In ancient times, Jie slew Guan Longfeng, Zhou slew Prince Bigan, and the realm was lost. Wu slew Wu Zixu, Chen slew Xie Zhi, and their states were destroyed. Thus, the ruin of states and the destruction of families were not for lack of sagacity and wisdom, but because they were not heeded.” Thereupon, he strapped a stone to himself and sank into the river. A gentleman hearing of this said, “As for incorruptibility, benevolence, and wisdom—I have yet to see them.”\n\nJie Zitui: The *Records of the Historian* states that Jie Zitui was a man of Jin. When Duke Wen returned to his state and rewarded his followers, the reclusive Jie Zitui was not among them. He neither spoke of his deeds nor received any emolument. Zitui said, “Lord Xian had nine sons, and only the Duke remains. Hui and Huai had no kin, and all within and without abandoned them. Heaven did not wish to end Jin, so it must have a lord. Who but the Duke should preside over Jin’s sacrifices? Heaven opened the way for him—yet these men claim it as their own doing. Is this not deceit? To steal another’s wealth is called theft—how much worse to covet Heaven’s merit and claim it as one’s own strength? Below, they conceal their crimes; above, they reward their treachery. When superiors and inferiors deceive one another, it is difficult to dwell among them.” His mother said, “Why not seek reward as well? If you die, whom will you blame?” Zitui said, “To imitate their faults would be a greater crime. Moreover, I have spoken resentful words and will not eat their emoluments.” His mother said, “At least let them know—what then?” He replied, “Words are the ornament of the person. If I wish to hide, why adorn myself? To adorn oneself is to seek recognition.” His mother said, “Can you truly do this? Then I will hide with you, and we shall not be seen again until death.” Jie Zitui’s followers pitied him and hung a letter on the palace gate, which read: “The dragon seeks to ascend to heaven, and five serpents aid it. The dragon has risen into the clouds, and four of them have found their place. One serpent alone resents that it has no station.” Duke Wen went out, saw the letter, and said, “This is Jie Zitui.” He was then preoccupied with the royal house and had not considered his merit. He sent men to summon Zitui, but he had fled. Learning that he had entered the mountains of Mianshang, Duke Wen encircled the mountains and enfeoffed them as Jie Zitui’s fields, naming them Jieshan, to record his error and honor the virtuous. Another account states that Duke Wen entreated him, but he would not emerge. When the Duke could not find him, he resolved to burn the mountain to force him out. When the mountain was set ablaze, Zitui would not emerge and was burned to death.\n\nHis end: *shi* rhymes with *si*.\n\nWei Sheng: A man of Lu. Some write his name as Weisheng.\n\nDismembered dog: *zhe* rhymes with *ke*. To display a corpse is called *zhe*. The *Feng and Hui Records* of the *Records of the Historian* state that Duke De of Qin first instituted the summer sacrifice, dismembering dogs at the four gates of the capital to ward off pestilence.\n\nFloating pig: Butchers boil pigs—this is called *floating*.\n\nWielding a ladle: *cao* rhymes with *qi*.\n\nGourd gourd: *bi* rhymes with *yao*.\n\nThe beggar spoke of the six above as not meeting proper ends—like pigs, dogs, beggars, and those who drift in ditches.\n\nThe beggar’s *qi* may also be written as *zou*.\n\n*Li-ming* appears in Zhang Junfang’s edition; the old text has *li*.\n\nZixu drowned in the river: The *Annals of Wu and Yue* state that when Zixu remonstrated, the King of Wu would not heed him. He stamped the ground and wept, saying: “Alas! How grievous—this silence shall be our undoing. Loyal ministers are silenced, while flatterers stand at the ruler’s side. Governance and instruction lie in ruins; sycophancy knows no bounds. Perverse doctrines and false words twist right into wrong. Loyalty is abandoned and attacked; thus Wu shall be destroyed. Its ancestral temples razed, its altars forsaken, its cities turned to ruins, its halls overgrown with brambles.” The King of Wu flew into a rage and bestowed upon him the *Shulou* sword, commanding him to take his own life. Zixu thereupon fell upon his sword and died. The King of Wu then took Zixu’s corpse, placed it in a *chiyi* vessel, and cast it into the river.\n\nBigan was disemboweled: The *Records of the Historian* state that King Zhou’s debauchery and disorder knew no end. Viscount Weizi remonstrated repeatedly, but the king would not listen, so he plotted with the Grand Tutor and Junior Tutor and departed. Bigan said: “As a minister, if one does not remonstrate even unto death, how can the common people be without blame?” He then spoke forthrightly to admonish King Zhou. Enraged, the king said: “I have heard that the heart of a sage has seven apertures—is this true?” Thereupon he slew Prince Bigan and cut open his chest to examine his heart.\n\n*Buguo*: *wo* rhymes with *guo*. To transcend.\n\nIllness and emaciation: *se* rhymes with *you*.\n*Qilin* and *jifu*: *qi* as in *qi*, *ji* as in *ji*.\nFleeting as a galloping shadow: *guo* rhymes with *xi*.\nSwift: *ji* rhymes with *li*.

He was a disciple of Confucius, steadfast in conduct and trustworthiness.\n*Man Gou De* (\"Fullness from Haphazard Gains\"): A parable. It illustrates those who attain fullness through careless or undeserved gains.\nWhy not: *he* rhymes with *la*.\nTo practice: *xing* as in *meng*. Same below.\nAn exhortation: Why not cultivate virtue and conduct?\nTo extend: *shen* as in *xin*. Same pronunciation.\nThe *Shuowen* defines it as bending and extending. In the Classics, *xin* is interchangeable with *shen*. Same below.\nTo seek it through righteousness.\n*Zang* and *ju*: Sima Biao explains this as referring to *zanghuo*—those who steal, plunder, and amass illicitly.\nThen ashamed in countenance: As seen in Zhang Junfang’s edition. Formerly written as \"then there would be shame in countenance.\"\nPrime minister: *xiang* rhymes with *liang*. Same below for *xiang*.\nTo enter: *sao* as in *zao*.\nCheng explains: Duke Huan, whose given name was Xiaobai, killed his elder brother’s son Jiu, took his sister-in-law into his household, and employed Guan Zhong—a worthy man—as his minister.\nAs a minister: Sometimes written as \"as a prime minister.\"\nRegicide: *shi* rhymes with *zhi*.\nCheng explains: Initially, when Confucius heard that Tian Chengzi had assassinated Duke Jian, he bathed and went to court, informing Duke Ai: \"Chen Huan has murdered his lord; I request that you punish him.\" This was to humble and subordinate himself to the lowly. Later, he accepted Tian Chengzi’s gifts and received his tribute—this was a contradiction between words and deeds.\nTo discuss: *ze* rhymes with *dun*.\nPerverse: *bei* as in *zhan*.\nAlso rebellious: *bo* as in *fu*. To oppose.\nElders and juniors: *zhang* as in *zhang*. Same below for \"eldest son.\"\nThe Five Constants: Sima Biao explains these as the years, days, months, stars, and calendrical calculations.\nThe *Wen* states: Heaven orders the earth; the sun orders the stars; the ruler orders the minister; the father orders the son; the husband orders the wife.\nCheng explains: Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Also, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust. Also, ancestors, father, self, son, and grandson.\nThe Six Positions: Ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife.\nThe *Wen* states: These are the six positions of the *Yi*.\nTo distinguish: *bie* as in *lie*. Same below.\n\nEmperor Yao executed his eldest son—Cui Yun states this refers to Yao’s execution of his eldest son, *Kao Jianming*.\nCheng explains: He did not grant the throne to Dan Zhu, calling this an execution in the name of righteousness.\n*Lüshi Chunqiu* states: Yao had ten sons; Shun had nine sons.\nShun exiled his younger half-brother—*liu* means banishment.\n*Mencius* says: Shun enfeoffed Xiang at Youbi, yet while he himself was Son of Heaven, his brother remained a commoner. Could this be called familial love?\n\nKing Ji was the rightful heir—*Records of the Grand Historian* states: Gu Gong had an eldest son, Tai Bo, and a second son, Yu Zhong. Tai Jiang bore a youngest son, Ji Li, who married Tai Ren, both virtuous women. They gave birth to Chang, who bore signs of sageliness. Gu Gong said: \"Our line is destined to flourish—surely it will be through Chang.\" The eldest sons, Tai Bo and Yu Zhong, knowing Gu Gong wished to establish Ji Li as heir to pass the throne to Chang, fled together to the Jing Man. After Gu Gong’s death, Ji Li ascended, becoming Gong Ji—thus was King Ji the rightful heir.\n\nKing Wu overthrew Zhou and enfeoffed his younger brother, the Duke of Zhou, at Qufu, calling it Lu; his brother Shu Xian at Guan; and his brother Shu Du at Cai. When King Wu died, the crown prince Song succeeded, becoming King Cheng. As King Cheng was young, the Duke of Zhou assumed regency and governed the state. Guan Shu and Cai Shu suspected the Duke of Zhou of rebellion. The Duke of Zhou, bearing King Cheng’s mandate, executed Guan Shu and exiled Cai Shu—thus was this the Duke of Zhou’s execution of his elder brother.\n\nConfucian fabrications—*Records of the Grand Historian* states: When Confucius left Chen and passed through Pu, he encountered Gongshu Shi’s rebellion in Pu, and the people of Pu detained Confucius. Among his disciples was Gongliang Ru, who followed Confucius with five private chariots. Tall and virtuous, possessed of great strength, he said: \"Formerly, I followed the Master and encountered danger at Kuang; now we face it again here. This is fate. Having twice suffered hardship with the Master, I would rather die fighting swiftly.\" The people of Pu, alarmed, said to Confucius: \"If you do not proceed to Wei, we will release you and swear an oath.\" They sent Confucius out the eastern gate, and he then went to Wei. Zigong said: \"Can one break an oath?\" Confucius replied: \"It was a coerced oath—spirits do not heed it. Moreover, you were merely feigning compliance for the sake of appearances.\" *Wei* is pronounced *yu wei*; below, \"for profit\" is the same.\n\n*Jian* in some editions is written as *jian* (to reflect).\nI once saw in Zhang Junfang’s edition the character *ri* (sun) written as *ren* (person), pronounced *shi*.\n*Song* is read as written, or Xu pronounces it *yao*.\n*Song* means to debate or expound.\nWu Zixu gouged out his eyes—*Records of the Grand Historian* states: Wu Zixu remonstrated, but the King of Wu did not listen and bestowed upon him the *Shu Lou* sword to die. As he was about to die, he said: \"Gouge out my eyes and place them on Wu’s eastern gate to witness Yue’s destruction of Wu.\"\nThe upright Gong—*Analects* states: There was an upright Gong whose father stole a sheep, and the son testified against him.\nWei Sheng (Baozi) was explained earlier.\nShen Sheng did not defend himself—*Records of the Grand Historian* states: Crown Prince Shen Sheng of Jin was slandered by Lady Li, who secretly had someone speak ill of him and placed poison in the sacrificial meat. Weeping, he said: \"How could the crown prince bear such cruelty? To plot against his own father—how much more so others? Moreover, the lord is old, a man of twilight years. Could I not wait and yet seek to usurp him?\" Hearing this, he fled to Xincheng. The enraged Duke Xian executed his tutor, Du Yuan Yi. Someone told the crown prince: \"The one who prepared the poison was Lady Li. Why not defend yourself and clarify the truth?\" The crown prince said: \"Our lord is old; without Lady Li, he cannot rest or eat in peace. To argue would only anger him further.\" Another said: \"You could flee to another state.\" The crown prince replied: \"Bearing such an evil name and leaving—who would take me in? I will kill myself.\" Shen Sheng took his own life in Xincheng.\nConfucius did not see his mother; Kuang Zhang did not see his father—The text states: Confucius traveled extensively on diplomatic missions but did not see his mother after her death. Kuang Zhang: The people of Qi remonstrated with his father, who drove him away, and he never saw his father again.\n*Suo zhuan* is pronounced *zhuan*. To dwell in peace.\n\nThe text reads *Wu Zu* in one version as *Wu Zhi*. *Le yi* is pronounced *luò*; the same applies below.\n\nThus, when one upholds the correct Way without forgetfulness—forgetfulness may also be written as delusion—it means that ruler and minister need only follow the true path without wavering, and so they do not employ wealth and nobility. Those who deviate do so because their wisdom and strength are insufficient, and thus they do not resort to deception.\n\nThe recluses who cut themselves off from the world and surpass their age say: \"The human heart is easily swayed. Yet if one is born alongside the worthy, one may already consider oneself above others—how much more so if one personally attains wealth and nobility?\"\n\n*Can* is pronounced *qī*; *dan* is pronounced *hé*; *zhi* is pronounced *kǒng*; *qiong* in *qiong mei* means \"to exhaust\"; *jiu* in *jiu shi* means \"to complete.\" *Xia ren* is pronounced *xié*.\n\nDesire is pronounced *wù*; contention is pronounced *zhēng*. Huang’s commentary states that this refers to Tang and Wu. According to the *Book of Shang*: \"When Ge Bo failed to perform sacrifices, Tang first attacked him. Later, when he campaigned eastward, the Western Yi complained; when he campaigned southward, the Northern Di complained, all saying, 'Why does our lord come so late?' Was this not contention on all four fronts?\" *Yao ming* is pronounced *yāo*.\n\nHere follows the translation:\n\n---\n\nIt is also akin to the ancient Southern repository edition, which was formerly incomplete.\n\n*Chang’e* is pronounced *è*. *Guan yue* is pronounced *yào*; in one version, *guan yue* is written as *xūn chí*, while *qiàn* is pronounced *kǎn*. *Láo lǐ* is pronounced *lì dāo*. *Gāi* is pronounced *ài*; in eating and drinking, *gāi* refers to the point of swallowing. *Fèn qì* is pronounced *fèn*, meaning \"full\"; the same below, referring to pent-up, obstructed *qi*. *Shang ban* appears in Zhang Junfang’s edition, formerly incomplete. *Qu wèi* is also written as *wèi*. From Zhang Junfang’s edition. *Rǔ bù shě* is pronounced *shě*, the same below. *Qī jiào* is pronounced *zài yāo*. Li [Yun] says it means \"to rest.\" *Yí* is pronounced *xǔ yè*. In Li [Yun]’s commentary on *nèi zhōu qī*, it reads \"repeated seclusion within the jade tablet.\" *Wǎn xuān* refers to external defensive preparations. *Cái dān* is pronounced *dān*, or sometimes written as *qí*. *Liáo* is pronounced *liǎo*, describing an entangled appearance.\n\n*End of the Seventh Fascicle of the* Nan Hua Zhen Jing Zhang Ju Yin Yi *(Exegesis and Phonetic Glosses on the* Nan Hua Zhen Jing*).*\n*Beginning of the Eighth Fascicle of the* Nan Hua Zhen Jing Zhang Ju Yin Yi*.*\n*Composed by Bi Xu Zi*\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters: \"In You\" (Seventeen)**\n**Acting Through Non-Action**\n\nIn the *Shuo Wen*, *chǔ* means \"to abide.\" *Yòu* is pronounced *yòu*, meaning \"lenient.\" To indulge one’s nature is to lose it—this is called *yín*. *Yín* also means \"to linger\" or \"to stagnate.\" To deviate from one’s *dé* is to lose it—this is called *qiān*. *Rén lè* is pronounced *luò*. *Tián* is pronounced *qiān*, meaning \"tranquil.\" *Cuì* is pronounced *zài jì*, meaning \"ailing\" or \"distressed.\" *Yú* is pronounced *yù*, meaning \"joyful.\" *Pí*, according to Sima [Biao], means \"to assist\" or \"to join.\" *Qiáo* is pronounced *xiāo*. Guo [Xiang] pronounces it *jiǎo*. *Jié* is pronounced *gōng jí*. Cui [Yuan] says *qiáo jié* means \"a mind that is not at peace.\" *Zhuó* is pronounced *chì jiǎo*. *Zhì* is pronounced *chì èr*. Cui [Yuan] says *zhuó zhì* means \"conduct that is not level.\" *Zhī xíng* is pronounced *xià mèng*. *Jǐ* means \"to be sufficient in mutual support.\" *Xiōng xiōng* is pronounced *xiōng*, describing the clamor of competitive clamor. *Shì bèi* is pronounced *bì nèi*, meaning \"contrary.\" *Shì xiāng* is pronounced *xī liàng*, meaning \"to assist\"; the same below. *Yú jì* is pronounced *qǐ*. *Shèng* is pronounced *shì zhèng*; the *Shuo Wen* says it means \"to penetrate.\" Cheng [Xuanying] says *shèng* refers to sagely traces. *Yì* is pronounced *ní jì*, meaning \"skill\" or \"ability.\" *Yú cī* is pronounced *jí sī*. *Luán* is pronounced *lì zhuǎn*. *Juàn juàn* is pronounced *miǎn*. Sima [Biao] says *luán juàn* describes a state of being coiled and unable to stretch. *Cāng* is pronounced *cāng*; Cui [Yuan]’s version writes it as *qiāng*. The *Nang* edition writes it as *cāng náng*, meaning \"difficult to bear.\" Cui [Yuan] says *qiāng náng* is like \"tumultuous disorder.\" The text says *cāng náng*, describing a state of haste. *Guì* is pronounced *guǐ*. *Lì* is pronounced *lì*, meaning \"to oversee.\"\n\n---\n\nThus, one who values their person over the wealth of the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their person over the world may be entrusted with the world. These two phrases differ slightly from the currently transmitted *Dao De Jing*, yet align with Wang Bi’s version. It is suspected that during the Kaiyuan era’s collation of the classic, alterations were made based on another text. Here, the version from the *Qi Yuan* is taken as definitive.\n\nTo dwell like a corpse yet manifest like a dragon—this is the image of spirit. Without speech, reverence arises. The dragon’s manifestation is drawn from its transformative ascent. Profoundly silent, like still water. The thunder’s voice is heard throughout the world. *Cóng róng*: a state of ease. *Chuī*: pronounced *chǎng shuì*. *Lèi*: pronounced *liè wěi*. Guo [Xiang] says it resembles dust motes moving of their own accord.\n\nThe sage empties the heart-mind. *Cuī Qú*: ancient worthies. *Lǎo Dān*: pronounced *tǔ lán*. \"Take care, sir, not to disturb the human heart.\" The *Lü Shi Chun Qiu* states: \"That which gives life is Heaven; that which nurtures and completes is man. To nourish what Heaven has begotten without disturbing it—this is the role of the Son of Heaven.\" The Son of Heaven’s actions aim to preserve Heaven’s wholeness as their purpose. Gao You’s commentary says: \"*Yīng* means to offend; *gù* means affair.\"\n\n*Pái*: pronounced *pí jiē*. *Nào*: pronounced *chāng lüè*. *Lián guì*: pronounced *jū wèi*, meaning \"to injure\" or \"to benefit.\" *Zhuó*: pronounced *dīng jué*. *Xuán*: a state of lofty and distant vastness. *Fèn*: pronounced *fěn jiān*, meaning \"to collapse.\" *Jiāo fèn*: the unbridled gallop of a proud steed—an unstoppable force. It also refers to defying ritual and law, like a horse running wild.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor first used benevolence and righteousness to disturb the human heart. In high antiquity, people dwelled in nests and caves, lacked fire for cooking grains, and suffered from many illnesses due to their diet. The Yellow Emperor then introduced robes and skirts, constructed houses, invented pestles and mortars, and promoted plowing and weeding, allowing the people to enjoy the comforts of clothing, food, and shelter—all through the sagely governance of the Yellow Emperor. People benefited from this and called it *ren* (benevolence). When Chiyou disrupted order and cruelly harmed the people, the Yellow Emperor punished and executed him—again, an act of sagely governance. People found this fitting and called it *yi* (righteousness). Yet benevolence and righteousness arise naturally, their origins long preceding this. Later generations, unaware of this, merely saw their traces and claimed that benevolence and righteousness began with the Yellow Emperor.\n\n*Bā*: pronounced *pàn mò*, meaning \"white flesh.\" *Jìng*: pronounced *xíng dìng*, meaning \"shin.\" Without hair—this describes how Yao and Shun followed the Yellow Emperor’s traces, exhausting their hearts and bodies, their thighs emaciated without white flesh, their shins bare of fine hair. *Huān*: pronounced *huān*. *Dōu*: pronounced *dīng hóu*.\n\nHuan Dou was the son of Emperor Hongshi, known as Hundun. He hailed from the southern foothills of Mount Chong. In the sixtieth year of his reign, Yao banished Huan Dou to Mount Chong. The San Miao were the descendants of Jinyunshi, known as Taotie. The Three Peaks (pronounced *wēi*) were mountains in the western frontier, now under Tianshui. In the sixty-sixth year of his reign, Yao exiled the San Miao to the Three Peaks. Gong Gong was the son of Shaohao, known as Qiongqi. He came from the northern frontier of Youdu in Youzhou. In the sixty-fourth year of his reign, Yao banished Gong Gong to Youdu.\n\n*Shī* (施): pronounced *yǐ chǐ*, meaning \"to extend.\" *Dà hài* (大骇): \"great shock.\" *Shàn fǒu* (善否): pronounced *pǐ*, meaning \"evil.\" *Jīn jù* (釿锯): pronounced *jīn jù*. *Zhì yān jīn jù* (制焉釿锯): refers to the application of corporal punishment. *Shéng mò shā yān* (绳墨杀焉): Cui Yun states this means \"to execute by the standard of the law,\" while others say that those whose crimes are already determined are bound with black cords, and those not yet determined with red cords. The binding of criminals follows a hierarchy of severity. *Zhuī* (椎): pronounced *zhí zhuī*. *Záo* (凿): pronounced *zài luò*. *Jué yān* (决焉): pronounced *gǔ xuè*, meaning \"to bore holes for shackles using a mallet and chisel.\" *Jǐ* (脊): pronounced *jí*, also *zài yì*. *Xiāng jiàn* (相践): \"to trample upon.\" One variant reads *xiāo* (肴), meaning \"chaos.\" *Kān* (堪): pronounced *kǔ yán*. *Yán* (岩): pronounced *yǔ xián*. *Shū sǐ* (殊死): *shū* means \"to sever\"; the Han ordinance states that chieftains of the Man and Yi tribes guilty of crimes are to be executed by beheading. *Xiāng zhěn zhī* (相枕之): pronounced *zhǐ*. *Héng* (桁): pronounced *hù gāng*; Sima states this refers to long-footed shackles, while Yang and Cui say that shackles for the neck and shins are all called *héng*. *Lí* (离): pronounced *lì zhì* or *lì shì*. *Qǐ* (跂): pronounced *qiū shì*. *Rǎng bì* (攘臂): pronounced *rú yáng*. *Zhì* (桎): pronounced *zhī shí*. *Gù* (梏): pronounced *gǔ dú*. *Jiē* (椄): pronounced *xiè*. *Xí* (槢): pronounced *xí*; Sima states that *jiē xí* refers to wooden wedges for shackles, while another says they are beams for restraints. The *Honglie Jie* explains that large ones serve as pillars, and small ones as *jiē xí*. *Záo* (凿): pronounced *zài bào* or *zài luò*. *Ruì* (枘): pronounced *rén ruì*; the *San Cang* states this is the tenon at the top of a pillar, fitting into a mortise like the tenon of a pillar. *Yān zhī* (焉知): pronounced *wū yú*. *Xiāo shǐ* (嗃矢): pronounced *xǔ jiāo*, referring to arrows that whistle or are fierce. One variant includes an additional twenty-four characters here: \"The mutual arising of being and non-being is extreme. Zeng and Shi, Jie and Zhi—whether they possess being or non-being, how could they not collide with one another?\"\n\n*Qīng jìng mín zhèng* (清静民正): The Yellow Emperor has already explained this in the *Qi Wu* chapter. Guangchengzi was an ancient Daoist master. Kongtong is a mountain name, said to be where the Northern Dipper culminates; another account places it thirty *li* east of Yucheng in Liangguo. The character *zhī* (之) in \"of the mountain\" follows Zhang Junfang’s edition, while older versions read *shàng* (上). *Zhì* (质): refers to coarse and shallow physical form. Clouds and qi do not wait to gather before raining—Sima states that *zú* (族) means \"to assemble\"; rain before gathering implies scant moisture. Plants and trees do not wait to yellow before falling—Sima states that *luò* (落) means \"to die,\" indicating an excess of killing energy. *Jiǎn jiǎn* (翦翦): Sima states this describes a glib appearance; another says it means \"flattering.\" Li explains it as \"shallow and narrow,\" while another glosses it as \"cramped.\" *Juān* (捐): pronounced *yuè jīn*, meaning \"to discard.\" *Yāo zhī* (邀之): pronounced *gǔ yáo*, meaning \"to encounter.\" *Nán shǒu* (南首): pronounced *shòu*, meaning \"facing the light.\" *Cù* (蹙): pronounced *qī*, meaning \"to startle and rise.\" *Wú yǔ* (吾语): pronounced *yú jù*; the same below. *Yǎo yǎo* (窈窈): pronounced *wū liǎo*. *Wú wéi* (我为): pronounced *yú wěi*; the same below. *Yǒu cáng* (有藏): pronounced *cái làng*.\n\nAt one thousand two hundred years—Li Chunfeng states that heaven has no master and things grow thin—this span of one thousand two hundred years is called the \"Ten Great Measures,\" the first being the minor reckoning of yin and yang. Four nines make thirty-six, totaling three hundred sixty; four eights make thirty-two, totaling three hundred twenty; four sevens make twenty-eight, totaling two hundred eighty; four sixes make twenty-four, totaling two hundred forty; together these sum to one thousand two hundred.\n\nThe hundred flourishings: all things thrive. *Mín* (缗): pronounced *wǔ jīn*. *Yuǎn* (远): pronounced *wàn*. *Hūn* (昏): darkness; Sima states that *mín* and *hūn* both denote absence of intent. *Wúwéi* (无为): the people are transformed. *Yúnjiāng* (云将): pronounced *zǐ jiàng*. Li explains this as \"master of clouds and leader.\" *Hóngméng* (鸿蒙): primordial qi.

Another version lists them as wind-cold, summer-heat and dampness, dryness and fire; or wind-wood, cold-water, summer-heat-fire, dampness-earth, dryness-metal, and ministerial fire—these are called the six qi. *Diào* (掉): pronounced *tú diào*. *Yǒu Sòng* (有宋): name of a state. *Yāngzhǎng* (鞅掌): pronounced *yú zhàng*.\n\nMultitudes. *Zhīfàng* (之放): pronounced *fāng wǎng*, meaning to imitate. *Yī* (噫): pronounced *yī*, same below. *Xiānxiān* (仙仙): pronounced *xiān*, describing a light and soaring appearance. *Duò* (堕): pronounced *xǔ guī*, meaning to destroy. *Tǔ* (吐): pronounced as written, defined in the *Shuowen* as \"to write.\" *Xìng* (涬): pronounced *hù dǐng*. *Míng* (溟): pronounced *wáng dǐng*. *Zǐmíng* (滓溟): a state of primordial chaos. Sima explains this as the natural qi. *Húnhún* (浑浑): pronounced *hù běn*. *Dùndùn* (沌沌): pronounced *tú běn*. *Bùlí* (不离): pronounced *lì lí*, same below. To uphold, excel, bear, and embody the Way—yet detest. *Wū* (恶): pronounced *wū lù*.\n\nRelying on the multitude to attain tranquility: accepting what the multitude has seen and heard, entrusting and yielding to it, one naturally finds peace. Inferior to the many arts: *Qǐ* (绮): pronounced *qǐ*. The multitude surpasses me in knowledge and skill; the many arts of others far exceed my own. How can one not become self-ensnared? *Cǐlǎn* (此揽): pronounced *lǎn*, same as *lǎn* (揽). This passage, \"taking hold of another’s state,\" follows the Jiangnan ancient manuscript; the old text was incomplete.\n\n*Yáo* (侥): pronounced *gǔ yáo*. *Xìng* (幸): pronounced *xìng*, describing an insatiable pursuit of gain. Also, *yáo* means to demand. Seeking illicit advantage from the realm of august kings for one’s own fleeting fortune—how much can one gain? *Jǐhé* (几何): pronounced *jū qǐ*. Not losing: *Xīlàng* (息浪): pronounced *xī làng*, same below.\n\nHolding the latter yet placing it first. *Qiè* (挈): pronounced *kǔ jié*, meaning to grasp or hold. *Náo* (挠): pronounced *náo* with a falling tone.

Describing a demeanor of yielding, following, and effortless compliance. *Hēnghēng* (誙誙): pronounced *hù gēng*. Li [Yun] glosses it as the appearance of hastening toward death.\n\n\"I know not whether this is joy or not-joy—whether joy truly exists or not. I find joy in the sincerity of non-action.\" This passage follows the Jiangnan ancient manuscript; the old text read: \"I know not this joy, nor this not-joy—whether joy truly exists or not. I find sincerity in non-action as joy.\"\n\n*Huàshēng* (化生): follows the Jiangnan ancient manuscript; the old text was incomplete. *Mánghū* (芒乎): pronounced *huāng*, same below. *Wùhū* (芴乎): pronounced *hū*, same below. Vaguely, things arise; suddenly, they emerge—arising from nothingness, taking form in being.\n\nThe myriad things flourish—Li [Yun] says this describes their profusion. The *Erya* states: *zhí* (職) means \"to govern,\" referring to each having its own ruler and distinction.\n\n*Yí qínglèi* (遗情累): to cast off emotional burdens. *Jījù* (箕踞): pronounced *jù*.

Li [Yun] says *píncù* describes a sorrowful appearance.\n\n\"Joy\"—pronounced *luò*. \"And again\"—pronounced *fú yòu*. \"Is it for the toil of the living?\"—follows Zhang Junfang’s edition; the old text read: \"and again for the toil of the human world?\"\n\n*Míngshí* (名实): *chǔ* (褚): pronounced *zhù*.\n\nThe *náng* (囊): to hold with tolerance and receptivity.\n\n*Gěng* (绠): pronounced *gé měng*, a well-rope for drawing water. *Jí* (汲): pronounced *jū jí*, the act of drawing water. *Ér zhòng* (而重): pronounced *zhí yòng*.\n\nRegarding the \"sea crow\"—Sima [Qian] notes in the *Guoyu*: it is called *àijū* (爱居). When it alighted outside the eastern gate of Lu for three days, Zang Wenzhong ordered the people to offer sacrifice to it—not to the Lord of Lu. Yet it was worshipped in the Lu temple, hence the text refers to the \"Lord of Lu,\" and the *Ode* speaks of the *yuān jū* (爰居). Another name is *zá xiàn* (杂县). It stands eight *chi* tall, its form resembling the *fènghuáng* (凤皇), and its cry sounds like *yà* (讶).\n\n*Shāng* (觞): pronounced *shāng*. \"In the temple\"—Sima [Qian] explains this means it was given drink within the temple.\n\n*Jiǔ sháo* (九韶): pronounced *cháng yáo*, the name of Shun’s music.\n\n*Xuàn* (眩): pronounced *xiàn*, meaning the eyes have no fixed focus.\n\n*Yī luán* (一脔): pronounced *lǐ zhuǎn*.\n\n*Tán* (坛): pronounced *dà dān*.

Sima [Qian]’s edition reads *jì* (继), explaining: though the myriad things bear signs, only with the qi of water and earth do they succeed one another in generation. The *Shuōwén* defines *jì* (继) as continuation. Another saying: the reversal of *là* (腊) is *jué* (绝). The present text reads *xùn* (), which is the reversal of *là* (腊).\n\nAt the juncture of water and earth, it becomes *lóng* (龙), pronounced *hù wā*.\n\n*Pín* (蠙): pronounced *bù tián*.\n\n*Zhī yī* (之衣): Sima [Qian] explains: the roots of things lie at the water-earth juncture, spreading through the water; when viewed from above, they are unseen, but when scooped, they may be obtained—like silk floss submerged in water. The people of Chu call it the *wā pín* (鼃蠙) garment.\n\nCheng [Xuanying] says: green moss spreads in the water like silk floss; commonly called the frog’s garment.\n\nIt grows on mounds, *líng tún* (陵屯), pronounced *tú mén*. A hill or mound.\n\nThen it becomes *líng xì* (陵舄), pronounced *xī*. Sima [Qian] says: things form through water, yet land-borne life arises on mounds, transforming into plantain. Its name is changed to *líng xì*. Another name is *zé xì* (泽舄), altering with dryness and moisture. Yet none know its origin—things transform without fixed form. When humans die, some may turn into grasses or trees; the essence of grasses and trees may become human.\n\n*Líng xì* that obtains *yù qī* (郁栖) becomes *wū zú* (乌足). Li [Yun] says: *yù qī* is manure and soil; when mound crows dwell in manure and soil, they transform into *wū zú* grass. Sima [Qian] says: *yù qī* is an insect’s name, *wū zú* a grass’s name, growing by water. When *yù qī* resides among mound crows, it transforms into *wū zú*.\n\nThe root of *wū zú* becomes *qí cáo* (蛴螬), pronounced *qí cáo*, an insect’s name. Its leaves become *hú dié* (胡蝶), pronounced *dié*. Sima [Qian] says: the butterfly. Grass transforms into insects, insects into grass—without beginning or end.\n\n*Hú dié xū yě* (胡蝶胥也): *xū* means mutual arising. Things mutually generate one another.\n\nTransforming into an insect born beneath the stove, Sima [Qian] says: it arises from warmth and *qi*. Its form resembles a cast-off skin, pronounced *tuō tā*. That is, shedding its skin. Sima [Qian] pronounces it *yuè*, saying: newly emerged, its skin is smooth and fine. Its name is *qú duō* (鸲掇), pronounced *qú duō*. *Qú duō* is an insect’s name.\n\n*Qú rǎng* (鸲攘) after a thousand days becomes a crow; its name is *gān* (乾), pronounced *gān*. The foam of *yú gǔ gān* (余骨乾)—*yú gǔ*’s foam, pronounced *mò*—Li [Yun] says: the juice in its mouth—becomes the *sī mí* (斯弥) insect. *Sī mí* becomes *shí xī* (食酰), pronounced *xī*. Sima [Qian] says: the midge that swarms over bitter wine.\n\n*Shí xī* arises from *yí lù* (颐辂), *yí lù* pronounced *yí lù*, an insect’s name. It arises from *huáng xuàn* (黄軦), pronounced *kuàng*, an insect’s name. *Huáng xuàn* arises from *jiǔ yóu* (九猷), pronounced *yóu*. Li [Yun] says: *jiǔ* means long-lasting; *yóu* is an insect’s name. *Jiǔ yóu* arises from *mào ruì* (瞀芮), pronounced *mào ruì*. Small insects, fond of flying in chaotic swarms. Also a grass’s name.\n\n*Mào ruì* arises from *fǔ quán* (腐蠸), pronounced *fǔ quán*, an insect’s name. The *Ěryǎ* says: another name is *shǒu guā* (守瓜); also called the yellow beetle in melons. Another says: the firefly. Another says: the mole rat.\n\n*Fǔ quán* arises from *yáng xī* (羊奚), *yáng xī* pronounced *bǐ zhì*. The two characters above in red ink follow Zhang Junfang’s edition; previously omitted. It arises from *bù shī* (不), pronounced *xī yǐn*. Long bamboo gives rise to *qīng níng* (青宁). Sima [Qian] says: *yáng xī* is a grass’s name, its root resembling turnip; when it joins with long bamboo, they form a being—all arising from unlike kinds. *Qīng níng* is an insect’s name.\n\n*Qīng níng* gives rise to *chéng* (程). Jia [Kui] says: *chéng* is called *bào* (豹) in the Central States, *mò* (貊) by the Yue people—another name for the leopard. *Chéng* gives rise to the horse; the horse gives rise to humans. The *Shǐjì*’s *Chronological Tables* say: in the twenty-first year of Duke Xiao of Qin, a horse gave birth to a human—all transformations of a single *qi*, adapting without limit.\n\n*End of the Eighth Fascicle of the* Nan Hua Zhen Jing Zhang Ju Yin Yi\n*Beginning of the Ninth Fascicle of the* Nan Hua Zhen Jing Zhang Ju Yin Yi\n\nMaster Bi Xu crafted *Miscellaneous Chapters: \"Attaining Life\" (23)*\n\n\"Attaining Life\" (*dá shēng*): \"Attaining\" (*dá*) means to flow freely; \"life\" (*shēng*) refers to that which has life.\n\n*Wú lí* (无离): *Lì* rhymes with *zhì* (智).

The pellets are the same, yet some perish—this is because they must have something externally valued. When something is externally valued, it leaks, for internally it is hollowed out.\" *Fúzǐ* states: \"King Xia sent Yi to shoot at a target the size of a square *cùn* and a bullseye the size of a *cùn* in diameter; he never missed a shot. The king said, 'Well done! If you hit the target again, I shall reward you with ten thousand gold; if you miss, I shall strip you of ten cities.'

Lǐ states: when *yáng* scatters, *yīn* congeals—hence anger; when *yīn* rises and *yáng* lies hidden—hence forgetfulness.\nIf it neither ascends nor descends: pronounced *dīng zhòng*.

According to the *Zuo Zhuan*, Sunshu Ao was the prime minister of King Zhuang of Chu. Confucius had not yet been born, and in the sixteenth year of Duke Ai of Lu, Confucius passed away. Later, when the Duke of Bai caused chaos, Yi Liao had never served in Chu. The *Zuo Zhuan* of the twelfth year of Duke Xuan also records that Chu had Xiong Yi Liao, who was a contemporary of Sunshu Ao, far removed from Confucius—this is likely a figurative reference. Cheng [Xuanying] says the *jué* is also a wine vessel, holding one *sheng*.\n\nIn this context, the phrase \"words of the ancients\" refers to the invocations spoken by the ancients during gatherings and alliances, at the time of libation sacrifices. *Nòng wán*: *wán* means \"pearl.\" *Nòng wán* refers to the skill of juggling pearls. Yi Liao regarded the affairs of the world as if turning pearls in his palm, finding amusement in this alone. The *Master of Ghost Valley* has a method for turning pearls, akin to the boundless ferocity of beasts. The infinite wisdom of the sage is like the ceaseless turning of pearls, resembling the inexhaustible might of beasts—thus Yi Liao demonstrated his skill in juggling pearls.\n\n*Liǎng jiā zhī nàn*\nPronounced *nǎi dàn*. *Jiě* pronounced *xiè*. Sima [Biao] says Yi Liao was a brave warrior of Chu, skilled in juggling pearls. When Bai Gong Sheng of Chu was about to cause chaos, he killed the prime minister Zixi and Ziqi. They said, \"In the south of the market, there is Xiong Yi Liao. If we obtain him, he can match five hundred men.\" They went to inform him, but he refused. When they pressed him with a sword, he remained unmoved, continuing to juggle pearls as before, saying, \"I will not betray you.\" Bai Gong then killed Zixi. Ziqi sighed over the conflict between the two families, while Yi Liao remained uninvolved in their troubles.\n\nThe text says: Bai Gong Sheng and the grandee Zixi raised armies to fight each other. The two families’ grandees said, \"Yi Liao is a reclusive scholar; one man is worth five hundred.\" They both sent envoys to summon him. Yi Liao lay at ease, resting his head high, receiving the envoys of the two grandees. He juggled pearls with both hands without pause, then lay back down without rising. When they pressed him with a sword, he remained unmoved. The envoys of the two grandees returned and fully explained Yi Liao’s intent. The two grandees said, \"His high pillow and reclining show us his non-action; his unmoving response to the sword shows that military force is not to be relied upon. The two hands represent the two families; the pearls are round objects of non-action. Juggling them without cease means both will reach exhaustion. This makes clear that if the two families continue their conflict, they will surely perish.\" The two grandees disbanded their troops and returned, no longer resorting to arms.\n\n*Gān qǐn bǐng yǔ*\n*Qǐn* read as written; it means covering the face with a fan. Sima [Biao]’s edition reads *dèng*, glossed as *hé* (or *chì*, \"wings\"), the implement held by dancers in the *yú* sacrifice. Cui’s edition reads *yì* (\"wings\").\n\nThe people of Ying laid down their weapons. Sima [Biao] says this means Sunshu Ao wished to sleep peacefully and rest in tranquility, cultivating his virtue in the ancestral temple while repelling enemies a thousand *li* away. The state of Ying laid down its weapons, having no need for attack or conquest.\n\n*Huì*\nPronounced *xū huì*. *Sān chǐ*: *chǐ* means \"long.\" Sima [Biao] says *huì* means \"breath.\" Yi Liao juggled pearls amid mounting difficulties; Sunshu Ao removed obstacles to repel enemies. I, too, wish to sigh over my *sān chǐ*. *Sān chǐ* refers to a dagger. Cheng [Xuanying] says *huì* means \"mouth.\" If one’s words are fitting, then silence is no different from having a mouth three *chǐ* long. Thus, I wish for this.\n\n*Bǐ zhī wèi*\n*Bǐ* refers to Yi Liao and Sunshu Ao. One says *bǐ* refers to peaceful repose.\n\n*Cǐ zhī wèi*\n*Cǐ* refers to Confucius. One says *cǐ* refers to juggling pearls.\n\n*Zǒng*\nPronounced *zǒng*. One edition reads \"mutually identical.\"\n\n*Shàn fèi*\nPronounced *fèi*. Sima [Biao] says it means not distinguishing between guest and host, bringing things to a halt.\n\n*Shàn yán*\nSima [Biao] says it means losing the root while chasing the branches, speaking without cease.\n\n*Xún gǔ ér bù mó*\nOne edition reads *mó* (\"to grind\"). Guo [Xiang] says *mó* means \"to wipe.\" Wang [Bi] says *mó* means \"to erase.\" Though one constantly engages with things, one does not lose oneself. Though governing the present, one should follow the Way of the ancients.

Wang [Bi] says it means the appearance of compassion, encouragement, and diligence. *Qí rén yǔ rén xiāng shí*: *yǔ* pronounced *yú*. It means they will rush toward benevolence and righteousness, no longer tending to agriculture, and when hungry, will consume one another.\n\n*Suǒ wù*\nPronounced *wū lù*, referring to their conduct.\n\nMoreover, let us suppose that the implements of the greedy among birds and beasts—Shi Ma says: the greedy among birds and beasts kill without limit; those greedy for benevolence and righteousness harm without end.

Another version says: the true person has no stench, thus does not attract ants—this is ants abandoning wisdom. To dwell together in the great Dao of mutual forgetfulness, possessing no virtue of clinging or delay—this is the fish’s strategy. Sheep, having no stench, do not attract ants—this is sheep abandoning intent.\n\n*Self-concealment*\nWaiting for others with the heavens; as seen in Zhang Junfang’s edition, formerly written as *zhī*.\n\n**Dǒng**\nPronounced *jǐn*. Sima [Qian] states: this is *wūtóu* (aconite), which treats wind-cold impediment.\n\n**Jié gěng**\nPronounced *jié*, anciently *měng* cut. Sima [Qian] states: *jié gěng* (platycodon) treats blood stasis, concretions, and impediment in the heart and abdomen.\n\n**Jī yōng**\nPronounced *yú róng*. Sima [Qian] states: this is *jītóu* (foxnut), also called *qiàn*; when ground with lotus seeds into powder and ingested, it prolongs life. The original text sometimes writes it as *yōng*.\n\n**Shǐ líng**\nSima’s edition writes it as *shǐ náng* (pig’s sac), also called *zhū líng* (polyporus); its root resembles a pig’s testicles and can treat thirst. Note: these four are all names of medicinal herbs.\n\n**At this time, they serve as the emperor’s [remedies]**\nSima [Qian] states: medicinal herbs have their seasons, taking turns as the \"emperor,\" referring to their phases of dominance, decline, and rest, each finding its proper use.\n\n**Shèng yán**\nPronounced *shēng*.\n\n**Gōu Jiàn**\nPronounced *gōu*.

Sima [Qian] states: to remove. *Chéng* states: the crane’s legs, having received their allotted measure, grow long; thus they can be long but not short. Such are the joints of its limbs—when severed, it grieves. This is like Zhong [Zhangyong], who was dim in self-preservation but skilled in preserving the state.\n\n**There is loss in this**\nWhen forms naturally burden one another, the world can burden things, and things can burden people—thus Minister Zhong could not avoid [his fate].\n\n**Those who rely on the source and proceed**\nWater flows from its source; though it may encounter wind and sun, it cannot be harmed. When the Dao is perfected, one’s nature, though in the world, cannot be altered.\n\n**Zhī**\nPronounced *dīng zhàng*.\n\n**Zī**\nTo gather or assemble.

They do not know that employing wisdom must lead to loss, and having lost, they then worry over the lack of wisdom. As for their congratulatory deeds—flawed and unavailing—thus their roots of sorrow and trouble intertwine without a moment’s pause, hence *constantly lacks even brief respite*. When it comes to rest, unable to relinquish wisdom and abandon anxiety—what is there if not sorrow?\n\n**Shēng-ér-měi-zhě**\nThose born beautiful—others reflect and approve them. If not told, they do not know their beauty surpasses others. The moment reflection arises, the beauty of things exists, yet it is bestowed by those without intent.\n\n**Zuò-míng**\nBlind reflection.\nThus people praise them.

Because good and evil, loyalty and filial piety cannot preserve life in full, it is said: \"In doing good, do not seek fame; in doing evil, do not incur punishment.\"\n\nLóngféng and Bǐgān—already explained in the *Human World* chapter.\n\nJīzǐ the Mad—*Records of the Grand Historian* states: \"Zhòu was dissolute and excessive; Jīzǐ remonstrated but was not heeded. Someone said, 'You could leave.' Jīzǐ replied: 'As a minister, to remonstrate and not be heeded, then to leave, is to expose the ruler’s faults and seek favor with the people—I cannot bear to do so.' He then let his hair down, feigned madness, and became a slave, playing the zither in sorrow to conceal his grief. Thus the tradition speaks of *Jīzǐ’s Melody*.\"\n\nÈlái’s Death—*Records of the Grand Historian* states: \"Fēilián begot Èlái, who was strong; Fēilián was swift.

The old pronunciation of *fū* is *hàowàn*. Guo Xiang’s commentary, in discussing its fundamental principles, may truly be said to have grasped the essence of Zhuangzi’s thought.\n\nGuo, in his lifetime, lamented the sophistry of the wealthy and refined; I, too, have lately witnessed the vain discourse of the privileged and idle. This is what is meant by \"different eras, same customs\"—what more can be said?\n\nSome ask: Zhuangzi and Huizi shared the bond of the Hao River’s bridge and modeled themselves after the master craftsman of Ying, yet why is it said that his works fill five carts while his words miss the mark? Could it be that their bond was like that of the craftsman of Ying, where even Xiang’s adze, when laid to rest, was met with criticism? Such words are truly excessive.\n\nI reply: If one wishes to rescue the workshops of established teachings and illuminate their words with divine clarity, how can one fail to refine their expression and exhaust their analogies? Zhuangzi struck the resonant note of mystery across his seven chapters, arranging these writings for all generations. His profound words traverse the path of the arcane, and his endeavors unfold in the order of eloquent discourse. Though he discoursed on the primal and prized disputation, his teachings were never empty rhetoric. Yet his text is easy to peruse, while its deeper meaning is difficult to fathom. Those who approach it without full comprehension may harbor suspicions of overreaching its principles, and thus the flaws of such misapprehensions must be dispelled. This is why I have broadly addressed Huizi’s views on disputation.\n\n*Colophon: The Fourteenth Scroll of the* Nan Hua Zhen Jing Zhang Ju Yin Yi *is complete.*",

      "translated_text": "**Preface to the *Nanhua Zhenjing Zhangju Yinyi* (Exegetical Notes and Phonetic Glosses on the *True Scripture of Southern Florescence*)**\nBy Bixuzi\n\nThe Grand Historian states: Zhuangzi once served as the warden of Meng’s Lacquer Garden and composed a work of over one hundred thousand characters. The *Han Shu: Yiwen Zhi* records fifty-two chapters of the *Zhuangzi*. The *Sui Shu: Jingji Zhi* notes Xiang Xiu’s commentary in twenty fascicles, Guo Xiang’s in thirty-three fascicles, and further that Liang Qian compiled the *Nanhua Lun* in twenty-five fascicles. Tao Hongjing’s preface to the *Zhen’gao* states: Zhuangzi received esoteric teachings from Master Changsang and composed the seven *Inner Chapters*, each titled with three characters—modeled after the revolving jade rings of the celestial sphere and the radiant brilliance of the Three Luminaries. Thus, when Hongjing composed the *Zhen’gao*, he arranged it into seven sections, likewise using three-character headings. His writings evidently followed this tradition.\n\nDuring the Tianbao era of the Tang, an imperial edict decreed that Zhuangzi’s work should retain its former title, *True Scripture of Southern Florescence*, from which we know the significance of *Nanhua* has endured since antiquity. From my youth, I have delighted in reciting this scripture. When not occupied with worldly affairs, I would unroll the scroll and read—such is the vocation of Daoists, who seek longevity and enduring vision, forgetting both praise and blame while trusting in the Dao. How can this be compared to those who rely on external conditions?\n\nNow, I have compiled exegetical notes, dividing the text into seven fascicles. This involves parsing chapters and distinguishing sentences, tracing the intricate branches of its discourse. The seven *Inner Chapters*—*Free and Easy Wandering*, *On the Equality of Things*, *The Secret of Caring for Life*, *The Human World*, *Signs of Full Virtue*, *The Great and Venerable Teacher*, and *Fit for Emperors and Kings*—are the very ones named by the Lacquer Garden master. The remaining chapters take their titles from the first two or three characters of each, comprising fifteen *Outer Chapters* and eleven *Miscellaneous Chapters*. Some claim the *Outer* and *Miscellaneous Chapters* were edited by Guo Xiang. However, Tao Hongjing states that Zhuangzi authored the *Inner* and *Outer Chapters* without mentioning the *Miscellaneous*. Examining earlier commentaries, I find them often cursory and difficult to verify. Here, I have selected twenty-six chapters, using two-character headings for those that form complete sections—*Webbed Toes*, *Horses’ Hooves*, *Opening Trunks*, *Engraving Intent*, *Mending Nature*, *Discourse on Swords*, and *The Old Fisherman*—to pair with the *Inner Chapters* as the *Outer Chapters*. The remaining nineteen—*Yielding the Throne*, *Robber Zhi*, *In the Realm of*, *Heaven and Earth*, *The Way of Heaven*, *The Revolution of Heaven*, *Autumn Floods*, *Perfect Happiness*, *Mastering Life*, *The Mountain Tree*, *Master Tian*, *Knowledge Wanders North*, *Gengsang Chu*, *Xu Wugui*, *Zeyang*, *External Things*, *Parables*, *Lie Yukou*, and *The World*—alternate like odd and even numbers, their titles drawn from figures or events, their principles aligning with the numerology of yin and yang, their meanings resonating with the subtleties of speech and silence. Thus, they are called the *Miscellaneous Chapters*.\n\nWithin these thirty-three chapters, I have divided the text into 250 sections, assigning titles based on their themes, designating them as *Zhangju* (Exegetical Notes). Beneath each section, I provide phonetic glosses, exegetical explanations, and clarifications of allusions, labeling them as *Zhangyi* (Sectional Meanings). Upon completion, I tallied the characters in the main text, totaling 65,923—four-tenths fewer than Sima Qian’s record. I further collated the *Baowen Tonglu* from the Central Taiyi Palace, which contained several versions of the *Zhuangzi*, along with hand-copied manuscripts from my satchel. Comparing these with the 1004 edition printed by the Directorate of Education, I found 349 discrepancies. Additionally, I consulted other commentaries to address lacunae and errors in one fascicle, resolving doubts and including three chapters by Gongsun Long for reference.\n\nAlas! Later scholars are unfortunate not to witness the complete bamboo slips of the Lacquer Garden or grasp the grand purport of its chapters—its profound insights have gradually been fragmented by various schools.\n\nComposed on the Lantern Festival of the Jiazi year of the Yuanfeng era.\n\n**Nanhua Zhenjing Zhangju Yinyi, Fascicle One**",

      "translated_text": "Zhuangzi’s surname was Zhuang, his given name Zhou, and he was also styled Zixiu. A native of Mengcheng in Song, he lived contemporaneously with King Hui of Liang and King Wei of Qi. He once served as the Keeper of the Lacquer Garden. His teacher was Gongsun Long, from whom he received esoteric teachings. He composed a work of over one hundred thousand characters, which he titled *Nanhua*. His scholarship was rooted in the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, and he also studied under the Chu master Juan Yuan. Later, he secluded himself on Mount Baodu, where he ingested the Northern Nurturing Fire Elixir, ascended to heaven in broad daylight, and was appointed as a Compiling Gentleman in the Pavilion of the Supreme Ultimate. On the fourth day of the fifth month in the nineteenth year of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, the Minister of the Court Pei Guangting requested the canonization of the Four Masters. On the twentieth day of the second month in the first year of the Tianbao era, an imperial edict decreed that Zhuangzi’s work retain its original title, *Nanhua Zhenjing* (*True Scripture of Nanhua*); Wenzi’s work be titled *Tongxuan Zhenjing* (*True Scripture of Pervading Mystery*); Liezi’s work be titled *Chongxu Zhenjing* (*True Scripture of Soaring Emptiness*); and Gengsangzi’s work be retitled *Dongling Zhenjing* (*True Scripture of Penetrating Spirit*). The title *Nanhua* signifies the radiance of separation, the flourishing essence that reveals the subtleties of the Dao.\n\n**Inner Chapters: \"Free and Easy Wandering\" (1)**\nThe seven titles of the Inner Chapters were bestowed by the Lacquer Garden. Only when one is free of self can merit and fame dissolve, and only then may one speak of \"free and easy wandering.\" The *Free and Easy Wandering* chapter is placed first because, though it strides beyond the mundane, it still harbors pride and boasting, and thus is followed by *The Equality of Things*. \"Equality\" means forgetting things to achieve self-equality; those who have not yet attained equality still engage in debates of self and other. When self and other revolve in cycles, entering the emptiness within the cycle brings equality. Those who equalize through emptiness have yet to recognize the master of life and death, so this is followed by *The Secret of Caring for Life*. The \"master\" is the true lord of spirit and bone. The body is like firewood, and the master is like fire. One who preserves fire relies on firewood, but when the firewood is exhausted, the fire dies. Only the adept in nurturing remains unaware of its end. Yet there are those who shine alone and cannot join the multitude, so this is followed by *The World of Men*. One who dwells in filth without contamination excels in harmonizing light and dust, and by harmonizing with dust, one attains virtue, hence the next chapter, *The Sign of Fullness of Virtue*. When virtue takes form, things are forgotten. Only those who remain obscure preserve their talents in full, and with talents complete, one may become a teacher, hence *The Great and Venerable Teacher*. The true teacher is none other than the perfected person. How could the perfected person possess a heart-mind? Without a heart-mind, one may assist in the transformations of creation, hence *Responding to Emperors and Kings*. Emperors and kings are the source of the great Dao, the masters of teaching and transformation, occupying one of the Four Greatnesses and presiding as the most honored over the myriad things. Vast and profound, their appearance cannot be fathomed by physiognomists. The chapters from *Webbed Toes* onward lack distinct thematic significance and are arranged to elaborate and amplify the subtleties of the seven Inner Chapters.\n\n**Annotations on \"Free and Easy Wandering\"**\n*Beiming* (Northern Darkness) is also written as *溟* (*míng*), pronounced like *觅经* (*mì jīng*). Xi Kang states it signifies \"boundless and vast.\" Emperor Jianwen of Liang says *窅冥* (*yǎo míng*), meaning \"without limit.\" *Kun* (鯤) is pronounced *gǔn* (公浑切). The *Erya* defines it as \"fish roe.\" The name *Kun* refers to the initial transformation of fish eggs, before they differentiate into whale or loach, embodying the meaning of primordial unity, hence \"hún ěr\" (混尔). When the *Kun* grows large, it spans thousands of *li* without measure.\n\n*Peng* (鵬) was originally written as *朋* (*péng*), implying the meaning of \"companionship,\" hence its sound does not differ from other birds. It signifies \"a flock of companions.\" When the *Peng* takes flight, it spans thousands of *li* without measure.\n\n*Nanming* (Southern Darkness) refers to the Southern Sea, analogous to *Beiming* (Northern Darkness).\n\n*Qi Xie* (齐谐) is pronounced *hù jiē* (户皆切).

Cheng Wuying says it refers to a sunken area in a courtyard.\n\n*Jie* (芥) is pronounced *jí mài* (吉迈切). Li Yi says it means \"small grass.\"\n\n*Ze jiao* (则胶) is pronounced *gǔ yáo* (古肴切), or alternatively as *jiāo* (胶). Li [Yi] says it means \"to stick.\"\n\n*Feng si* (风斯) is pronounced *xiāng zhī* (相支切), meaning \"to split.\"\n\n*Pei* (培) is pronounced *bó huí* (薄回切), meaning \"to increase.\" The *Liji* states, \"Grave mounds are not *peí* (培).\" *Peí* means \"to cultivate.\"\n\n*Yao* (夭) is pronounced *yú biǎo* (於表切). Sima [Biao] says it means \"to break.\"\n\n*Guan* (关) is pronounced *yú gé* (於葛切). Sima [Biao] says it means \"to stop\"; Li [Yi] says it means \"to block.\"\n\n*Tiao* (蜩) is pronounced *tián liáo* (田聊切). Sima [Biao] says it is a cicada.\n\n*Xuejiu* (鸴鸠) is pronounced *yú jiǎo* (於角切). It is also written as *学* (*xué*) or *鸴* (*xué*), pronounced *yù* (预). Sima [Biao] says it is a small turtledove. The *Maoshi Caomu Shu* states that *hú jiū* (鹘鸠) is a turtledove.\n\n*Wo jue* (我决) is pronounced *xǐ quē hū* (喜缺乎), *jué* (决) as *xué* (穴二切). Li [Yi] says it means \"swift.\"\n\n*Qiang* (抢) is pronounced *qī liáng* (七良切). Sima [Biao] says it means \"to gather\"; Cui [Yun] says \"to attach\"; Zhi Dun says \"to collide.\"\n\n*Yu* (榆) is pronounced *yú* (踰), the name of a tree.\n\n*Fang er zhi* (枋而止) is pronounced *fāng* (方), with *fang* (枋) as *fāng* (方). Li [Yi] says it is a sandalwood tree. The *Wen Ruhai* and the ancient Jiangnan manuscript read *抢榆枋而止* (*qiāng yú fāng ér zhǐ*).\n\n*Kong* (控) is pronounced *kǔ gòng* (苦贡切).

To equalize by following—*wǎng liǎng*: Guō explains it as \"the faint yin beyond the shadow.\" Xiàng says: \"the shadow’s shadow.\" Cuī’s original text reads *wǎng làng*, glossed as \"the state of being and non-being.\" *Nǎng* is pronounced *nǎi dàng*; Lǐ explains it as \"formerly.\" *Wú tè* means \"not alone\"; some write it as *chí* (to hold). *Cāo* and *yǔ* share the same pronunciation. *Shé fù* is pronounced *fù*; Chéng explains: \"*shé fù* is the shedding of a snake’s skin.\" *Tiáo yì*: Chéng explains that the wings of the *tiáo* are not true wings but refer to the cicada’s molted shell, akin to *tiáo jiǎ* in the \"Yùyù\" chapter. The text means: unlike the *shé fù* or *tiáo yì*, which depend on external conditions, my solitary transformation arises from the natural—what does it depend upon?\n\nTo equalize through transformation—*hú dié* is pronounced *tú xié* (butterfly). *Jiá dié* is the same. *Xǔ xǔ* is pronounced *kuàng fǔ*; the text states: \"the manner of attuning to one’s nature.\" Chéng explains: \"the manner of joyful ease.\" Xú says: \"the manner of delight.\" Cuī’s original text reads *piān piān* (fluttering). *Zì yù*: Lǐ explains it as \"pleasure\"; Chéng, as \"awakening.\" *Zhì* and *yǔ* share the same pronunciation (identical below). *Jué* is pronounced *gǔ xiào*. *Qú qú* is pronounced *qú*; Lǐ explains it as \"having form.\" The text states: \"the manner of astonishment.\" Cuī’s original text reads *jù jù*, citing the *Dàzōngshī*: \"*jù rán* awakens.\" Modern texts also write it as *qú*.

All swords made from it were sharp, and the soil itself was refined and pure. On the mountain lived a beast the size of a hare, its fur golden, feeding on the cinnabar beneath the earth. It burrowed deep into the ground for its den and also consumed copper and iron. Its gallbladder and kidneys were like iron, and the female was white as silver. In the past, the armory of that kingdom had all its weapons and iron implements eaten away, yet the seals remained intact. The king ordered the armory’s den to be searched, and a pair of hares—one white, one yellow—were hunted. When killed and opened, their bellies contained iron gallbladders and kidneys. Only then was it known that the weapons’ iron had been devoured by the hares. The king summoned his swordsmiths and ordered them to forge the gallbladders and kidneys into swords.

The text says: \"The liver corresponds to wood and benevolence; the lungs to metal and righteousness; the heart to fire and propriety; the kidneys to water and wisdom; the spleen to earth and trust.\"\nAll beings endowed with consciousness, all creatures born into life, possess the nature of benevolence and righteousness. Whether little or much, this is naturally determined. Though Yan [Hui] and Confucius differ by but a fraction, the latter can never be matched—how much less those who differ further still? Now, those whose nature is rich in benevolence and righteousness inevitably become self-important and lose their nature; those whose nature is deficient in them strive after them and forfeit their authenticity. Racing along the path of self-importance and striving, drifting amid the realm of right and wrong, they vie in boasting and emulation—can this be the true Way of virtue and power?\nIf people abide in their nature, the feelings of \"much\" and \"little\" become one; if things keep to their proper place, the principles of benevolence and righteousness naturally align. When each office is filled according to its capacity, the world will know no disorder.\n*Yín pì* – Pronounced *pǐ yì*. The same below.\n*Yú rén yì zhī xíng* – Pronounced *xià mèng*. Cui [Yun] says: \"Though supernumerary toes and growths are not the true nature of the body, they arise from form and cannot be removed. Though the dispositions of the five viscera are not the true Way of virtue and power, they are arrayed in nature and cannot be governed.\"\nNow, to establish the teachings of benevolence and righteousness in order to govern the dispositions of the five viscera is like cutting off supernumerary toes and growths. It injures the principle of nature and only exacerbates the affliction.\n*Ér duō fāng yú cōng míng zhī yòng* – The old text reads: \"Yet they multiply methods in the use of intelligence.\" Zhang Junfang removed the character *fāng*, making it resemble the phrase below, \"excessive in intelligence.\"\nTo pair intelligence with supernumerary toes is to be deficient, for compared to the number of the five fingers, it is called \"lacking.\" To pair intelligence is to be excessive, for it doubles other natures and is called \"redundant.\"\n*Wén zhāng* – Green and red form *wén*; red and white form *zhāng*.\n*Fǔ fú* – Pronounced *fǔ fú*; explained in the \"Da Zong Shi\" chapter.\n*Huáng huáng* – Pronounced *huáng*, meaning \"radiant.\" It also describes dazzling eyes.\n*Fēi hū* – \"Is it not so?\"; to affirm.\n*Lí Zhū* – That is, Li Lou.

Later, he left Lu, was rebuffed in Qi, expelled from Song and Wei, and beset with hardship between Chen and Cai. Thereupon he returned to Lu, where he was once again treated well. Duke Ding appointed Confucius as governor of Zhongdu. Within a year, all the states followed his example. From Zhongdu, he became Minister of Works, then Minister of Justice, and then acted as regent. When the people of Qi heard of this, they grew fearful, saying: \"If Confucius holds power, Lu will surely become hegemonic.\" Thereupon they selected female musicians and sent them to the Lord of Lu.

The answer: The rise of Zhuangzi’s writings lies in returning to the root; the means of returning to the root begins with relinquishing glory. Thus, the *Yielding the Throne* chapter establishes a lofty standard of defiance toward the world, its purport being to refuse submission in order to refine custom, not to indulge the self in preserving life. The occasional passages that value life are merely expressions of the intent to abandon glory. Deeply weary of the toils of worldly affairs, they saw them as corrupting. Those of a lesser resolve, though clad in coarse cloth and sipping porridge, merely preserved their bodies. Those who fully embodied the Way stood far above the vulgar, transcending worldly bonds. They would sooner cast themselves into limpid waters than bow to the burdens of the age.\n\nThis was recorded in the old collection of pronunciations; it is copied here for its meaning, though it may not be entirely apt.",

Others say *Liuxia* was the name of his fief. According to the *Zuo Tradition*, Zhan Qin lived during the reign of Duke Xi of Lu, over eighty years before Confucius’ birth. If he lived until Zilu’s death, he would have been one hundred fifty or sixty years old—impossible to have been Confucius’ friend. Thus, this is a parable.\n\n*Zhi* (跖): *shi* rhyme. Li Qi’s commentary to the *Book of Han* states that Zhi was a great robber of Qin. Master Huang says that Zhi was the younger brother of Ji, named Yong, a great robber.

He discoursed on music with the Grand Master of Qi, heard the *Shao* melody, and studied it for three months, forgetting the taste of meat. The people of Qi praised him. Later, Duke Jing received Confucius with reverence, treating him with a rank between the Ji and Meng clans. In Lu, there were three ministers: the Ji clan held the highest office, while the Meng clan, though of lower rank, wielded no power—meaning the Duke treated him between these two. When Qi’s grandees sought to harm Confucius, he learned of it. Duke Jing said, “I am old and cannot employ you.” Confucius then departed—this is what is meant by “destitute in Qi.”\n\nBesieged in Chen and Cai—already explained in the \"Abdication and Kingship\" chapter.\n\nYao was not filial and did not cede the realm to Dan Zhu. Shun was not filial—some say he fled from his blind father; others, that he married without informing him. Yu was lamed by his labors in regulating the waters. Tang exiled his lord, banishing Jie to Mingtiao. King Wu attacked Zhou and slew him at Muye. King Wen was imprisoned in Youli. The *Records of the Historian* states that when Zhou minced the Nine Lords, Lord Chang of the West sighed in secret. Chong Houhu learned of it and reported it to Zhou. In the twentieth year of Zhou’s reign, he imprisoned Lord Chang in Youli. Youli was the name of a prison in Heyang, in Tangyin.\n\nAnd *qiang* rhymes with *zhang*.\n\nBao Jiao: Han Ying states that Bao Jiao was a recluse of the Zhou era. His clothes were tattered, his skin exposed, and he carried a basket as he gathered vegetables. He encountered Zigong on the road, who asked, “Sir, how have you come to this?” Bao Jiao replied, “Those who abandon virtue and teaching in the world are many—why should I alone not reach this state? I have heard that one who acts without being known by the age commits reckless deeds, and one who strives without being known by superiors destroys integrity. To persist in reckless deeds and destroyed integrity, yet not desist, is to be deluded by profit.” Zigong said, “I have heard that one who does not belong to the age does not partake of its benefits, and one who defiles his lord does not tread his land. Now you defile your lord yet tread his land, do not belong to the age yet gather its vegetables—whose are these?” Bao Jiao said, “Alas! I have heard that the worthy advance with weight and retreat lightly, while the incorruptible are quick to shame and slow to death.” Thereupon, he cast aside his vegetables and stood erect, withering away by the Luo River. A gentleman hearing of this said, “How unyielding was that incorruptible man! A mountain too sharp will not rise high; waters too narrow will not run deep. One who acts singularly lacks profound virtue; one whose ambitions rival heaven and earth brings misfortune upon himself. Bao Jiao may be called inauspicious. His measure of depth and shallowness led him only to this.” Some say he stood embracing a tree and withered away.\n\nHis end: *shi* rhymes with *si*.\n\nShentu Di: Han Ying states that Shentu Di was a man of the Shang era. Finding the age unworthy, he resolved to cast himself into the river. Cui Jia heard of it and stopped him, saying, “I have heard that the sagely and benevolent, in their place between heaven and earth, are the parents of the people. Now, for the sake of wetting your feet, you would not save a drowning man—is this permissible?” Shentu Di said, “Not so. In ancient times, Jie slew Guan Longfeng, Zhou slew Prince Bigan, and the realm was lost. Wu slew Wu Zixu, Chen slew Xie Zhi, and their states were destroyed. Thus, the ruin of states and the destruction of families were not for lack of sagacity and wisdom, but because they were not heeded.” Thereupon, he strapped a stone to himself and sank into the river. A gentleman hearing of this said, “As for incorruptibility, benevolence, and wisdom—I have yet to see them.”\n\nJie Zitui: The *Records of the Historian* states that Jie Zitui was a man of Jin. When Duke Wen returned to his state and rewarded his followers, the reclusive Jie Zitui was not among them. He neither spoke of his deeds nor received any emolument. Zitui said, “Lord Xian had nine sons, and only the Duke remains. Hui and Huai had no kin, and all within and without abandoned them. Heaven did not wish to end Jin, so it must have a lord. Who but the Duke should preside over Jin’s sacrifices? Heaven opened the way for him—yet these men claim it as their own doing. Is this not deceit? To steal another’s wealth is called theft—how much worse to covet Heaven’s merit and claim it as one’s own strength? Below, they conceal their crimes; above, they reward their treachery. When superiors and inferiors deceive one another, it is difficult to dwell among them.” His mother said, “Why not seek reward as well? If you die, whom will you blame?” Zitui said, “To imitate their faults would be a greater crime. Moreover, I have spoken resentful words and will not eat their emoluments.” His mother said, “At least let them know—what then?” He replied, “Words are the ornament of the person. If I wish to hide, why adorn myself? To adorn oneself is to seek recognition.” His mother said, “Can you truly do this? Then I will hide with you, and we shall not be seen again until death.” Jie Zitui’s followers pitied him and hung a letter on the palace gate, which read: “The dragon seeks to ascend to heaven, and five serpents aid it. The dragon has risen into the clouds, and four of them have found their place. One serpent alone resents that it has no station.” Duke Wen went out, saw the letter, and said, “This is Jie Zitui.” He was then preoccupied with the royal house and had not considered his merit. He sent men to summon Zitui, but he had fled. Learning that he had entered the mountains of Mianshang, Duke Wen encircled the mountains and enfeoffed them as Jie Zitui’s fields, naming them Jieshan, to record his error and honor the virtuous. Another account states that Duke Wen entreated him, but he would not emerge. When the Duke could not find him, he resolved to burn the mountain to force him out. When the mountain was set ablaze, Zitui would not emerge and was burned to death.\n\nHis end: *shi* rhymes with *si*.\n\nWei Sheng: A man of Lu. Some write his name as Weisheng.\n\nDismembered dog: *zhe* rhymes with *ke*. To display a corpse is called *zhe*.

Governance and instruction lie in ruins; sycophancy knows no bounds. Perverse doctrines and false words twist right into wrong. Loyalty is abandoned and attacked; thus Wu shall be destroyed.

Tai Jiang bore a youngest son, Ji Li, who married Tai Ren, both virtuous women. They gave birth to Chang, who bore signs of sageliness. Gu Gong said: \"Our line is destined to flourish—surely it will be through Chang.\" The eldest sons, Tai Bo and Yu Zhong, knowing Gu Gong wished to establish Ji Li as heir to pass the throne to Chang, fled together to the Jing Man. After Gu Gong’s death, Ji Li ascended, becoming Gong Ji—thus was King Ji the rightful heir.\n\nKing Wu overthrew Zhou and enfeoffed his younger brother, the Duke of Zhou, at Qufu, calling it Lu; his brother Shu Xian at Guan; and his brother Shu Du at Cai. When King Wu died, the crown prince Song succeeded, becoming King Cheng. As King Cheng was young, the Duke of Zhou assumed regency and governed the state. Guan Shu and Cai Shu suspected the Duke of Zhou of rebellion. The Duke of Zhou, bearing King Cheng’s mandate, executed Guan Shu and exiled Cai Shu—thus was this the Duke of Zhou’s execution of his elder brother.\n\nConfucian fabrications—*Records of the Grand Historian* states: When Confucius left Chen and passed through Pu, he encountered Gongshu Shi’s rebellion in Pu, and the people of Pu detained Confucius. Among his disciples was Gongliang Ru, who followed Confucius with five private chariots. Tall and virtuous, possessed of great strength, he said: \"Formerly, I followed the Master and encountered danger at Kuang; now we face it again here. This is fate. Having twice suffered hardship with the Master, I would rather die fighting swiftly.\" The people of Pu, alarmed, said to Confucius: \"If you do not proceed to Wei, we will release you and swear an oath.\" They sent Confucius out the eastern gate, and he then went to Wei. Zigong said: \"Can one break an oath?\" Confucius replied: \"It was a coerced oath—spirits do not heed it.

As he was about to die, he said: \"Gouge out my eyes and place them on Wu’s eastern gate to witness Yue’s destruction of Wu.\"\nThe upright Gong—*Analects* states: There was an upright Gong whose father stole a sheep, and the son testified against him.\nWei Sheng (Baozi) was explained earlier.\nShen Sheng did not defend himself—*Records of the Grand Historian* states: Crown Prince Shen Sheng of Jin was slandered by Lady Li, who secretly had someone speak ill of him and placed poison in the sacrificial meat. Weeping, he said: \"How could the crown prince bear such cruelty? To plot against his own father—how much more so others? Moreover, the lord is old, a man of twilight years. Could I not wait and yet seek to usurp him?\" Hearing this, he fled to Xincheng. The enraged Duke Xian executed his tutor, Du Yuan Yi. Someone told the crown prince: \"The one who prepared the poison was Lady Li. Why not defend yourself and clarify the truth?\" The crown prince said: \"Our lord is old; without Lady Li, he cannot rest or eat in peace. To argue would only anger him further.\" Another said: \"You could flee to another state.\" The crown prince replied: \"Bearing such an evil name and leaving—who would take me in? I will kill myself.\" Shen Sheng took his own life in Xincheng.\nConfucius did not see his mother; Kuang Zhang did not see his father—The text states: Confucius traveled extensively on diplomatic missions but did not see his mother after her death.

These two phrases differ slightly from the currently transmitted *Dao De Jing*, yet align with Wang Bi’s version. It is suspected that during the Kaiyuan era’s collation of the classic, alterations were made based on another text. Here, the version from the *Qi Yuan* is taken as definitive.\n\nTo dwell like a corpse yet manifest like a dragon—this is the image of spirit. Without speech, reverence arises. The dragon’s manifestation is drawn from its transformative ascent. Profoundly silent, like still water. The thunder’s voice is heard throughout the world. *Cóng róng*: a state of ease. *Chuī*: pronounced *chǎng shuì*. *Lèi*: pronounced *liè wěi*. Guo [Xiang] says it resembles dust motes moving of their own accord.\n\nThe sage empties the heart-mind. *Cuī Qú*: ancient worthies. *Lǎo Dān*: pronounced *tǔ lán*. \"Take care, sir, not to disturb the human heart.\" The *Lü Shi Chun Qiu* states: \"That which gives life is Heaven; that which nurtures and completes is man. To nourish what Heaven has begotten without disturbing it—this is the role of the Son of Heaven.\" The Son of Heaven’s actions aim to preserve Heaven’s wholeness as their purpose. Gao You’s commentary says: \"*Yīng* means to offend; *gù* means affair.\"\n\n*Pái*: pronounced *pí jiē*. *Nào*: pronounced *chāng lüè*. *Lián guì*: pronounced *jū wèi*, meaning \"to injure\" or \"to benefit.\" *Zhuó*: pronounced *dīng jué*. *Xuán*: a state of lofty and distant vastness. *Fèn*: pronounced *fěn jiān*, meaning \"to collapse.\" *Jiāo fèn*: the unbridled gallop of a proud steed—an unstoppable force. It also refers to defying ritual and law, like a horse running wild.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor first used benevolence and righteousness to disturb the human heart. In high antiquity, people dwelled in nests and caves, lacked fire for cooking grains, and suffered from many illnesses due to their diet. The Yellow Emperor then introduced robes and skirts, constructed houses, invented pestles and mortars, and promoted plowing and weeding, allowing the people to enjoy the comforts of clothing, food, and shelter—all through the sagely governance of the Yellow Emperor. People benefited from this and called it *ren* (benevolence). When Chiyou disrupted order and cruelly harmed the people, the Yellow Emperor punished and executed him—again, an act of sagely governance. People found this fitting and called it *yi* (righteousness). Yet benevolence and righteousness arise naturally, their origins long preceding this. Later generations, unaware of this, merely saw their traces and claimed that benevolence and righteousness began with the Yellow Emperor.\n\n*Bā*: pronounced *pàn mò*, meaning \"white flesh.\" *Jìng*: pronounced *xíng dìng*, meaning \"shin.\" Without hair—this describes how Yao and Shun followed the Yellow Emperor’s traces, exhausting their hearts and bodies, their thighs emaciated without white flesh, their shins bare of fine hair. *Huān*: pronounced *huān*. *Dōu*: pronounced *dīng hóu*.",

Its name is changed to *líng xì*. Another name is *zé xì* (泽舄), altering with dryness and moisture. Yet none know its origin—things transform without fixed form. When humans die, some may turn into grasses or trees; the essence of grasses and trees may become human.\n\n*Líng xì* that obtains *yù qī* (郁栖) becomes *wū zú* (乌足). Li [Yun] says: *yù qī* is manure and soil; when mound crows dwell in manure and soil, they transform into *wū zú* grass. Sima [Qian] says: *yù qī* is an insect’s name, *wū zú* a grass’s name, growing by water. When *yù qī* resides among mound crows, it transforms into *wū zú*.\n\nThe root of *wū zú* becomes *qí cáo* (蛴螬), pronounced *qí cáo*, an insect’s name. Its leaves become *hú dié* (胡蝶), pronounced *dié*. Sima [Qian] says: the butterfly. Grass transforms into insects, insects into grass—without beginning or end.\n\n*Hú dié xū yě* (胡蝶胥也): *xū* means mutual arising. Things mutually generate one another.\n\nTransforming into an insect born beneath the stove, Sima [Qian] says: it arises from warmth and *qi*. Its form resembles a cast-off skin, pronounced *tuō tā*. That is, shedding its skin. Sima [Qian] pronounces it *yuè*, saying: newly emerged, its skin is smooth and fine. Its name is *qú duō* (鸲掇), pronounced *qú duō*. *Qú duō* is an insect’s name.\n\n*Qú rǎng* (鸲攘) after a thousand days becomes a crow; its name is *gān* (乾), pronounced *gān*. The foam of *yú gǔ gān* (余骨乾)—*yú gǔ*’s foam, pronounced *mò*—Li [Yun] says: the juice in its mouth—becomes the *sī mí* (斯弥) insect. *Sī mí* becomes *shí xī* (食酰), pronounced *xī*. Sima [Qian] says: the midge that swarms over bitter wine.\n\n*Shí xī* arises from *yí lù* (颐辂), *yí lù* pronounced *yí lù*, an insect’s name. It arises from *huáng xuàn* (黄軦), pronounced *kuàng*, an insect’s name. *Huáng xuàn* arises from *jiǔ yóu* (九猷), pronounced *yóu*. Li [Yun] says: *jiǔ* means long-lasting; *yóu* is an insect’s name. *Jiǔ yóu* arises from *mào ruì* (瞀芮), pronounced *mào ruì*. Small insects, fond of flying in chaotic swarms. Also a grass’s name.\n\n*Mào ruì* arises from *fǔ quán* (腐蠸), pronounced *fǔ quán*, an insect’s name. The *Ěryǎ* says: another name is *shǒu guā* (守瓜); also called the yellow beetle in melons.

Jia [Kui] says: *chéng* is called *bào* (豹) in the Central States, *mò* (貊) by the Yue people—another name for the leopard. *Chéng* gives rise to the horse; the horse gives rise to humans.

Bǎi Lǐ Xī fled Qín and went to Wǎn, where a border guard of Chǔ seized him. Hearing of Bǎi Lǐ Xī’s worthiness, Duke Mù wished to ransom him heavily, but feared the Chǔ people would not consent. He then dispatched an envoy to Chǔ, saying: \"My dowry attendant Bǎi Lǐ Xī is there; I request to ransom him with five black ram skins.\" The Chǔ people thus permitted it. At that time, Bǎi Lǐ Xī was already over seventy. Duke Mù released him from captivity and consulted him on state affairs. Bǎi Lǐ Xī declined, saying: \"I am a minister of a ruined state; how am I worthy of such inquiry?\" Duke Mù replied: \"The lord of Yú did not employ you, hence his downfall—this was not your fault.\" After three days of persistent questioning, Duke Mù was greatly pleased and entrusted him with governance, styling him the Five Ram Skins Grandee. Bǎi Lǐ Xī demurred, saying: \"I am not the equal of my friend Jiǎn Shū. Truly, though the world does not know him, I once wandered destitute in Qí and begged for food from a chariot driver. Jiǎn Shū took me in, and I then wished to serve Lord Wú Zhī of Qí. Jiǎn Shū dissuaded me, and I thus escaped the calamity of Qí. I then went to Zhōu, where Prince Tuí of Zhōu favored cattle. I offered my skills in cattle-rearing to gain his favor. When Prince Tuí wished to employ me, Jiǎn Shū again dissuaded me, and I departed, thereby avoiding execution. Later, when serving the lord of Yú, Jiǎn Shū once more dissuaded me. I knew the lord of Yú would not heed me, yet I remained for private gain of rank and emolument.

      "translated_text": "*Shāng*\nPronounced *shāng*; Li [Yi] says it is the general term for wine vessels.\n\nSunshu Ao held the *jué*-cup. According to the *Zuo Zhuan*, Sunshu Ao was the prime minister of King Zhuang of Chu. Confucius had not yet been born, and in the sixteenth year of Duke Ai of Lu, Confucius passed away. Later, when the Duke of Bai caused chaos, Yi Liao had never served in Chu. The *Zuo Zhuan* of the twelfth year of Duke Xuan also records that Chu had Xiong Yi Liao, who was a contemporary of Sunshu Ao, far removed from Confucius—this is likely a figurative reference. Cheng [Xuanying] says the *jué* is also a wine vessel, holding one *sheng*.\n\nIn this context, the phrase \"words of the ancients\" refers to the invocations spoken by the ancients during gatherings and alliances, at the time of libation sacrifices. *Nòng wán*: *wán* means \"pearl.\" *Nòng wán* refers to the skill of juggling pearls. Yi Liao regarded the affairs of the world as if turning pearls in his palm, finding amusement in this alone. The *Master of Ghost Valley* has a method for turning pearls, akin to the boundless ferocity of beasts. The infinite wisdom of the sage is like the ceaseless turning of pearls, resembling the inexhaustible might of beasts—thus Yi Liao demonstrated his skill in juggling pearls.\n\n*Liǎng jiā zhī nàn*\nPronounced *nǎi dàn*. *Jiě* pronounced *xiè*. Sima [Biao] says Yi Liao was a brave warrior of Chu, skilled in juggling pearls. When Bai Gong Sheng of Chu was about to cause chaos, he killed the prime minister Zixi and Ziqi. They said, \"In the south of the market, there is Xiong Yi Liao. If we obtain him, he can match five hundred men.\" They went to inform him, but he refused. When they pressed him with a sword, he remained unmoved, continuing to juggle pearls as before, saying, \"I will not betray you.\" Bai Gong then killed Zixi. Ziqi sighed over the conflict between the two families, while Yi Liao remained uninvolved in their troubles.\n\nThe text says: Bai Gong Sheng and the grandee Zixi raised armies to fight each other. The two families’ grandees said, \"Yi Liao is a reclusive scholar; one man is worth five hundred.\" They both sent envoys to summon him. Yi Liao lay at ease, resting his head high, receiving the envoys of the two grandees. He juggled pearls with both hands without pause, then lay back down without rising. When they pressed him with a sword, he remained unmoved. The envoys of the two grandees returned and fully explained Yi Liao’s intent. The two grandees said, \"His high pillow and reclining show us his non-action; his unmoving response to the sword shows that military force is not to be relied upon. The two hands represent the two families; the pearls are round objects of non-action. Juggling them without cease means both will reach exhaustion. This makes clear that if the two families continue their conflict, they will surely perish.\" The two grandees disbanded their troops and returned, no longer resorting to arms.\n\n*Gān qǐn bǐng yǔ*\n*Qǐn* read as written; it means covering the face with a fan. Sima [Biao]’s edition reads *dèng*, glossed as *hé* (or *chì*, \"wings\"), the implement held by dancers in the *yú* sacrifice. Cui’s edition reads *yì* (\"wings\").\n\nThe people of Ying laid down their weapons. Sima [Biao] says this means Sunshu Ao wished to sleep peacefully and rest in tranquility, cultivating his virtue in the ancestral temple while repelling enemies a thousand *li* away. The state of Ying laid down its weapons, having no need for attack or conquest.\n\n*Huì*\nPronounced *xū huì*. *Sān chǐ*: *chǐ* means \"long.\" Sima [Biao] says *huì* means \"breath.\" Yi Liao juggled pearls amid mounting difficulties; Sunshu Ao removed obstacles to repel enemies. I, too, wish to sigh over my *sān chǐ*. *Sān chǐ* refers to a dagger. Cheng [Xuanying] says *huì* means \"mouth.\" If one’s words are fitting, then silence is no different from having a mouth three *chǐ* long. Thus, I wish for this.\n\n*Bǐ zhī wèi*\n*Bǐ* refers to Yi Liao and Sunshu Ao. One says *bǐ* refers to peaceful repose.\n\n*Cǐ zhī wèi*\n*Cǐ* refers to Confucius. One says *cǐ* refers to juggling pearls.\n\n*Zǒng*\nPronounced *zǒng*. One edition reads \"mutually identical.\"\n\n*Shàn fèi*\nPronounced *fèi*. Sima [Biao] says it means not distinguishing between guest and host, bringing things to a halt.\n\n*Shàn yán*\nSima [Biao] says it means losing the root while chasing the branches, speaking without cease.\n\n*Xún gǔ ér bù mó*\nOne edition reads *mó* (\"to grind\"). Guo [Xiang] says *mó* means \"to wipe.\" Wang [Bi] says *mó* means \"to erase.\" Though one constantly engages with things, one does not lose oneself. Though governing the present, one should follow the Way of the ancients. From ancient times to the present, one’s name is not erased.\n\n*Xiāng xíng*\nJiu Fang Yin, pronounced *yīn*, was a skilled horse physiognomist; the *Huainanzi* writes this as Jiu Fang Gao.\n\n*Wéi wǒ*\nPronounced *yú wěi*.\n\n*Xiāng wú zǐ*\nPronounced *xī liàng*.\n\n*Kǔn*\nPronounced *kùn*.\n\n*Qú rán*\nPronounced *jì jū*.

At that time, the Confucian and Mohist schools were both flourishing, and Huan wished for his younger brother Di to study Mohism, hoping to receive the benefits of being a Mohist.\n\n*Shēnyín* (呻吟), pronounced *shēn*, refers to the sound of chanting and reciting in study. Another interpretation says *lù shēnyín* (露呻吟), meaning reading aloud. *Qiú shì zhī dì* (裘氏之地): a place name; Cui says *Qiú* refers to Confucian robes, hence the name. The *dì qí* (地祇) spent three years before Huan transformed into a Confucian—*qiào* (翹), pronounced *yí*. The *Shuōwén* says *dì qí* is that which brings forth the myriad things, meaning that after a thousand days of study, his Confucian learning was complete.\n\n*The river moistens nine li*: the text says the river comes from the *qián* position, and *qián* corresponds to the yang number nine. *Shǐ qí dì Mò* (使其弟墨): to make his younger brother Di become a Mohist. *Hé hé* (阖阖): \"why not?\" *Cháng shì qí liáng* (尝视其良): *liáng* (良) refers to the good man, meaning Huan, saying, \"Why not go and see the fruit of the *jiūbǎi* (揪栢) that has grown on Huan’s grave?\" Some write it as *yín* (垠), pronounced *làng*. *Zhǒng* (冢) means grave. *Hé cháng shì qí liáng* (阖尝视其良): In the ancient southern Jiāngnán edition, the old text reads *Hé hú cháng shì qí liáng* (阖胡尝视其良).\n\n*Xiāng zuó* (相捽), pronounced *cái gǔ*. It speaks of the man who digs a well, claiming the merit of creating the spring for himself, while those who drink from it do not know the spring’s natural origin. This is a metaphor for Huan not recognizing Di’s innate Mohist nature and resenting him.\n\n*Nèi xī* (内熙): Zhuangzi says, \"Those who know the Way are easy\"—*yǐ* (以), pronounced *chǐ*. *Gǔ zhī zhìrén* (古之至人): The Zhang Junfang edition has this; the old text omits it. *Wú yì* (无益): *Zhū píng* (朱泙), pronounced *píng*.",

Guo Xiang’s commentary, in discussing its fundamental principles, may truly be said to have grasped the essence of Zhuangzi’s thought.\n\nGuo, in his lifetime, lamented the sophistry of the wealthy and refined; I, too, have lately witnessed the vain discourse of the privileged and idle. This is what is meant by \"different eras, same customs\"—what more can be said?\n\nSome ask: Zhuangzi and Huizi shared the bond of the Hao River’s bridge and modeled themselves after the master craftsman of Ying, yet why is it said that his works fill five carts while his words miss the mark? Could it be that their bond was like that of the craftsman of Ying, where even Xiang’s adze, when laid to rest, was met with criticism? Such words are truly excessive.\n\nI reply: If one wishes to rescue the workshops of established teachings and illuminate their words with divine clarity, how can one fail to refine their expression and exhaust their analogies? Zhuangzi struck the resonant note of mystery across his seven chapters, arranging these writings for all generations. His profound words traverse the path of the arcane, and his endeavors unfold in the order of eloquent discourse. Though he discoursed on the primal and prized disputation, his teachings were never empty rhetoric. Yet his text is easy to peruse, while its deeper meaning is difficult to fathom. Those who approach it without full comprehension may harbor suspicions of overreaching its principles, and thus the flaws of such misapprehensions must be dispelled. This is why I have broadly addressed Huizi’s views on disputation.\n\n*Colophon: The Fourteenth Scroll of the* Nan Hua Zhen Jing Zhang Ju Yin Yi *is complete.*",
