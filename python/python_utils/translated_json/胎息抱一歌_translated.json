  "full_translation": "**Song of Embryonic Breathing and Embracing the One, with Preface**\n\n*The text is titled* Song of Embryonic Breathing and Embracing the One. *Its author is unknown. One fascicle. Based on the* Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Dongshen Section, Methods Category.*\n\nThe root of human life is none other than primordial qi. If one knows where primordial qi resides, one is not far from the great Dao. As Lord Lao said: \"All things embrace the One in their generation; there is not a single thing that does not carry yin and embrace yang.\" If one does not know how to embrace the One, it is difficult to draw near to the Dao—thus the Dao is born from the One. The One is the mother of qi. Qi congeals to form the embryo; the embryo congeals to form breath. These two mysteries each have their own principle.\n\nThus, the scripture states: \"While in the mother’s womb, there is an embryo but no breath. Borrowing the mother’s respiration, the body grows. After parting from the spiritual source, both embryo and breath are complete.\" Those who study the Dao must thoroughly understand the two principles of embryo and breath, plumbing their subtleties. If one grasps the original source, one transcends the mundane and attains sagehood.\n\nOrdinary people, when closing their breath, do not secure the embryo. Sages, when preserving the embryo, do not fixate on the breath. \"Closing\" refers to fullness in the chest and disorder in the qi. Yanluozi said: \"Swallowing and closing only bring self-disorder.\" Master Yin said: \"Simply let the spirit constantly govern the qi, and the nose will not lose its breath.\" *The Yellow Court Classic* states: \"The zither-heart in triple folds dances with the embryonic immortal.\"\n\nSince ancient times, sages have achieved the Dao by securing embryonic breathing, not by merely closing the breath. When spirit and qi congeal as an embryo, the breath becomes settled. Rarely does one hear of attaining perfection through closing the breath. The sage said: \"Embrace the One and guard the center, and the child will naturally be empty. Guard the Three and return to the One, and spirit and qi will be refined.\" These words truly reveal the profound principle of embryonic breathing. Thus, twenty verses of the *Song of Embracing the One* are composed to elucidate its essentials.\n\n**Embracing the One, one must know the true source of the One;**\n**The numinous brightness ultimately resides in the Cinnabar Field.**\n**Exiting and entering, coming and going, the mind-ground opens;**\n**Qi and spirit respond, transforming into the embryonic immortal.**\n\n**Embracing the One was first transmitted, yet the real was not known;**\n**With diligent practice over time, one naturally communes with the divine.**\n**In the profound darkness, no resonance is found;**\n**Like an oyster containing the autumn moon, a radiant pearl forms.**\n\n**Embracing the One in cultivation has extraordinary gates;**\n**Through stillness and non-being, one directly reaches Kunlun.**\n**The wondrous breath does not disturb the record of the Mysterious Female;**\n**The qi of the timely center abides long.**\n\n**Embracing the One must be at ease and unconstrained;**\n**Do not let qi congest in the throat.**\n**If one can comprehend the true meaning of the doctrine,**\n**The five viscera and three palaces will naturally find peace.**\n\n**Embracing the One returns to the origin and reaches the root of life;**\n**Why labor over internal and external practices?**\n**Simply secure the stem and deepen the root,**\n**And in this very place lies longevity.**\n\n**The true origin of Embracing the One is extraordinary;**\n**Do not let spirit and qi diverge.**\n**Wherever one sits or moves, they are ever guarded;**\n**When circulated to the Heavenly Gate, life naturally grows.**\n\n**Embracing the One returns to the center of the Five Movements;**\n**How can the black form and its resonance be void?**\n**The gate of emptiness holds nothing—why seek it?**\n**To waste one’s life in vain effort is futile.**\n\n**Embracing the One is like a person within a mirror;**\n**Within form, only the form-body appears.**\n**From this, one gradually transcends the Three Realms;**\n**How can deluded dust ever again be dust?**\n\n**Embracing the One, the numinous terrace opens on a moonlit night;**\n**With every breath, the embryo rests within the embryo.**\n**If spirit and qi congeal and return as treasure,**\n**The primordial numen, though about to scatter, returns again.**\n\n**The defense of Embracing the One follows the correct origin;**\n**Do not let panting interfere.**\n**The true embryo does not pass beyond the Palace of Departure;**\n**It must be made to dwell in the lower Cinnabar Field.**\n\n**Embracing the One, the harmony of the original treasure flourishes;**\n**Do not let spirit and qi become estranged.**\n**If one intends to make breathing the true stem,**\n**It will be difficult to reach the land of immortality.**\n\n**Embracing the One, never pause for a moment;**\n**The Six-Word Practice is accomplished, and the five viscera are purified.**\n**If one preserves the physical form to abide in the world,**\n**In the realm of future lives, one will be born again.**\n\n**Embracing the One, only preserve the essence of spirit and qi;**\n**Guard the Three and return to the One, and the work is naturally complete.**\n**By what means does this body abide?**\n**In the golden chamber and the field of mushrooms, refinement reaches crystallization.**\n\n**Embracing the One is not about dwelling in quiet mountains;**\n**Living in the world without the Dao is also in vain.**\n**With long fasting and abstention from grains, dwelling in leisure,**\n**Only when the spirit-embryo is congealed does one become an immortal.**\n\n**Embracing the One, one naturally consumes the sweet dew nectar;**\n**Wind, thunder, clouds, and rain pervade the vast fields.**\n**After the five aggregates become solemn, bright, and still,**\n**One drives the mortal form together toward the immortal realm.**\n\n**Embracing the One, the true origin nourishes the Dao’s reality;**\n**There is no need to wander like clouds and water in search of an immortal lord.**\n**Returning and departing, coming and going, without interval one attains;**\n**Puffing the cheeks for too long harms the body.**\n\n**Embracing the One, always contain the Great Harmony;**\n**How dare the crow’s nest give rise to demonic errors?**\n**The seven po and three corpses—what harm could they do?**\n**Beneath Kunlun Mountain, the bright moon is abundant.**\n\n**Embracing the One, the body dwells in the land of no death;**\n**Golden lotus flowers bloom, seated in pure cold.**\n**The belly is full, the heart is empty, without filth;**\n**The Jade Pool is filled with the eightfold nectar of jade.**\n\n**The true meaning of Embracing the One has secret barriers;**\n**How can scholars of high talent discuss and proclaim it?**\n**Returning the spirit and restoring the heat to the master of the embryonic origin,**\n**Only then does one know the wondrous principle is profound and mysterious.**\n\n**Seeking life through Embracing the One is not difficult;**\n**Spirit and form resonate and enter the Three Fields.**\n**What is revealed in words—why doubt?**\n**Receive the oral transmission from an enlightened teacher.**\n\n*The Song of Embryonic Breathing and Embracing the One concludes.*",
