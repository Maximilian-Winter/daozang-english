The great Perfected Ones of Salvation and all the immortals assembled spoke of the karmic causes of those who perished in blood lakes, childbirth, or blood-related deaths.\n\nThen the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct arose from the ranks, prostrated himself, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: \"Your servant now gazes down upon the desire realm, upon the various hells of Mount Fengdu in the underworld—nine dark prisons by other names—followed by twenty-four hells, thirty-six hells, one hundred and eight hells, the Avīci Hell, the eighteen blade-strewn hells of Mount Tai, the great and small Iron Enclosure Hells of Unremitting Torment, the five lakes, four seas, nine rivers, and winding springs of the subterranean hells, the Mengjin Yellow Waves and Flowing Sands Hell, and the eighty-four thousand transformation prisons of the dark abyss.\n\nThough all may receive amnesty through the grace of benevolence, universally partaking in the great mercy, none know of the Blood Lake Hell. South of the Great Iron Enclosure Mountain lies another vast prison, called the Hell of Unremitting Torment. Within this hell is yet another, named the Gorge Stone Hell. To its northeast lies a place called the Blood Lake, stretching twelve thousand *li* in length and eighty-four thousand *li* in circumference. Below, it has a single gate named Subduing Waves, governed by the great deity of the Blood Lake.\n\nThis hell comprises five divisions: the Hell of Blood and Pus, the Hell of Cold Blood, the Hell of Filthy Blood, the Hell of Blood Offerings, and the Hell of the Blood Lake. This solitary prison is further divided into five, bearing the names Gorge Stone and Unremitting Torment. The great and small Iron Enclosure Mountains all confine the souls of the blood-stained and the boundlessly foul, even unto the ghosts that devour fetal yellow spheres, who bring lawsuits before the Three Officials, and the green-faced, black-toothed deities who drag souls into the nine nether realms. The celestial wolves and celestial hounds vie in their ravenous might, while the Six Jias and Six Dings offer no protective power. Moving through kalpas without end, there is no hope of escape.\n\nThese are the souls of those who died in childbirth or from blood-related injuries, cast into this hell. The retribution for such sins stems from past lives filled with cruelty, harm to beings, disloyalty, unfiliality, inhumanity, and unrighteousness—indulging in the five defilements, their spiritual consciousness sunk in delusion, mired in the three evil destinies, their form and spirit scattered and disordered.\n\nYou, these sinful souls, bear the karmic debts of former lives, suffering retribution in these bodies—plagued by blood and corpses, their lives cut short in childbirth. Some carried the six *jia* months, their fate bound to the Three Origins, their children lost in miscarriage, dying in distress. Some mothers lived while their children perished; others perished while their children lived. Some mothers and children both died, male and female undifferentiated in death. Some perished as mere embryos; others, their forms barely formed, met sudden death. Some fell ill as their time of delivery neared; others, pregnant, suffered falls from high places. Some were poisoned by mistaken medicine; others succumbed to abscesses, dysentery, or other ailments. Some bled to death; others perished from incessant dripping. Some carried their fetuses to term yet never delivered; others gave birth only for their children to die within the month. Some died from blood diseases; others, wounded by blades, perished before their allotted years, cut down in their prime. Some fell in battle, their souls scattered amid arrows and stones; others met their end through grave illness or execution by royal decree. Their bodies were foul, their spirits dim, all who died in blood—reeking of filth, their forms putrid. For a thousand lives and ten thousand kalpas, there is no escape.\n\nMoreover, the suffering of the dark yin is most profound, the karmic retribution most severe. The Gorge Stone Hell is unseen and unheard; the Iron Enclosure rains endlessly, its thousand layers of sword-blades unsheathed. Towering peaks loom perilously, their summits split by a single chasm. Black mists shroud the mountains, the gloom arising of itself. Vile, poisonous juices flow and submerge the sinners, boiling their bodies and minds, their flesh and bones dissolving in unbearable agony. Moving through kalpas without end, they never glimpse the light. Heaven’s grace and decrees have never reached this place. The officials of the underworld torture them day and night without cease—devouring marrow, eating hearts, flaying bodies, hurling corpses. Of all the hells’ torments, the Blood Lake is the most grievous. Once trapped within its gates, when shall they find release?\"\n\nAt that time, the Sovereign of Salvation from Suffering, for the sake of all beings, proclaimed the True Talismans of the Most High, the Radiant Treasure Talismans, the Jade Registers of the Cinnabar Terrace, and the Flying Mystery Numinous Chapters, dispatching them to the dark prisons of all hells, straight to the Gorge Stone Blood Lake. Universally radiating light, they illuminated the dark abyss, shattering the iron city and drying the Blood Lake. The Ashen River transformed into a pool of jasper; the Gorge Stone became a seat of cool purity.\n\nThe sins of the common folk, their karmic debts, cannot be escaped. Those who were enemies in past lives become mother and child in this one. Who could have foreseen that from the very dream of bears and leopards, the ominous thoughts of owl and kite would arise? Scarcely had the ten months passed before they became ghosts of the nine springs. The wailing of infants—where do their wandering souls return? Some perished together after delivery; others died before parting. Their forms were foul, their natures dim—the souls of women who died in childbirth, trapped in the Blood Lake.\n\nMay all who have been born or are yet to be born swiftly attain the joy of life’s fulfillment; may all who have passed or will pass receive the profound benevolence of transformation. Moreover, all creatures of blood and breath—every being with a womb—share this same body. Those who harm fetuses or break eggs suffer bitterness and bear grievances. The evil causes of past lives manifest as karmic retribution in this one. Before the moon could wax full, the stirring of pregnancy was felt. Ghostly qi, though formless, poisoned the viscera; the hidden devouring of yellow spheres pierced liver and bowels. Some drank poison to destroy themselves.\"\n\nSome perished while clinging to illness, buried in the depths to await their turn—who pities their suffering? May their blood and qi find harmony, swiftly escaping the bounds of dark yin; may their souls attain clarity and uprightness, ascending to the halls of fortune and blessing.\n\nThere were those who fought over land and cities, from ancient times bearing the calamity of slaughter; those who schemed for kingship or hegemony, unluckily meeting the hour of battle. Just as they donned armor to join the ranks, they hoped to seize captives and return in triumph. Yet with strength outmatched and allies few, their qi spent and strength exhausted, their bodies became sustenance for blades upon the field, their bones interred in the wilds of green desolation. The distance to their homeland stretched too far; to whom could they turn for offerings? Snow piled high and ice hardened upon the vast, barren sands; under skies of gloom and rain’s damp, the night echoed with mournful wails. Though they gave their lives in loyal service to their nation, in truth they died blameless. Some could not escape their destined fate, yet still suffered mutilation. Such sinking into oblivion is truly pitiable. Within the Blood Lake Hell dwell the souls of men who fell in battle or perished on the field.\n\nMay auspicious clouds open the gate of life, sparing them from the realm of confusion; may divine power gather their wandering qi, granting rebirth in households of loyalty and righteousness.\n\nThere were those afflicted by strange maladies, not merely the sudden onset of misfortune; the retribution of past causes, whether good or ill, must be without error. If not for slander against the Three Treasures, then surely it was the harm done to living beings that brought this upon them. Those stricken with wind-leprosy saw their skin fester and rot; those tormented by carbuncles and ulcers endured blood and pus flowing unceasingly. Their gasps upon the pillow, their lingering ghosts beneath the springs—who would not recoil at the sight? Yet even in death, who pities them? Some succumbed to ceaseless vomiting and diarrhea, their bodies exuding foul, putrid stench. Without salvation, how could they attain liberation? Within the Blood Lake Hell dwell all those who died of ulcers, flux, wind-leprosy, sores, and festering wounds.\n\nMay their chronic ailments be healed and their forms restored, swiftly purifying the six senses; beneath the light of wisdom, may they together behold the guidance of the Three Treasures.\n\nMoreover, the laws of the realm stood clear, their statutes and ordinances fully established; yet human hearts, twisted and perverse, fell into the snares of punishment unawares. Did they not fear the severity of the law’s blade? Yet they could not endure the fury of a single moment’s wrath. The violent brawlers, the ruthless plunderers—when their souls fled at the clank of shackles, their heads were severed from their bodies; after their lives ended upon the execution ground, their flesh and blood dripped in pools. Though their bodies were cast into the charnel groves, their souls were bound in the subterranean depths. Their karmic ties unexhausted, their vengeful qi still lingered. Within the Blood Lake Hell dwell all those who met death by defying the king’s law.\n\nMay they hear the sacred scriptures of life, restoring form and spirit; may they hold the Register of the Primal Beginning, instantly dissolving their evil karma.\n\nThus, the Most High Lord of Salvation from Suffering emits nine-colored rays of auspicious light, illuminating all hells, pardoning the sinful souls, universally delivering all those trapped in the Blood Lake Hell from the woes of childbirth to behold the light of the sun.\n\nTherefore, we burn incense, surrender body and life, prostrate

that time, the True Sage Who Saves from Suffering said: Once more, we perform repentance. Beneath the altar, the faithful men and women, along with the departed souls they commend, from past lives to the present incarnation, having taken female form, have committed manifold transgressions and faults. After marriage, in maintaining the household and managing affairs, they have unwittingly incurred sins. Perhaps the sins of reciting scriptures with unclean hands or unrinsed mouths; of breaking fasts, violating precepts, or disbelieving in yin and yang; of drinking wine to intoxication and disordering the spirit; of asserting one’s own rightness and others’ wrongs, or speaking of others’ faults; of using heavy scales and large measures for oneself, or light scales and small measures for others; of failing to honor the Three Lights, or indulging in lust at inauspicious times; of bearing and raising children, or causing miscarriages and abortions; of resenting the number of children, or wasting water to drown and discard them.\n\nThe sins of recklessly using water and broth to pollute rivers and streams; of cursing the wind and reviling the rain, resenting cold and loathing heat; of washing rice and straining swill, letting grains and sand fall to waste; of despising humble grains, rice, vegetables, and greens; of cutting and tailoring silks and fabrics at will for clothing; of intentional killing, accidental killing, inciting killing, and self-inflicted killing; of pouring scalding water on the ground, harming all manner of insects and ants; of slighting and humiliating parents-in-law, parents, uncles, and brothers; of groundlessly invoking ghosts and spirits, uttering curses, and making false oaths; of refusing alms to the orphaned and impoverished; of greed and insatiability in wealth and nobility; of plowing fields and tilling the soil, digging pits and excavating earth, harming sentient beings; of immoderately raising geese and silkworms; of breeding sacrificial animals for profit.\n\nNow, before the august presence of the Three Clarities, having repented each and every transgression, may all sins be washed clean in every life, and may purity as ice prevail in every generation. May long-accumulated offenses be forever dissolved, and may blessings of peace and well-being be received. With vows firmly made and devotion turned toward the Dao, in gratitude for the gift of life, each shall reverently and sincerely pay homage.\n\nReverently pay homage to the Dark Heaven Lord, Sovereign of Fengdu Prefecture.\nReverently pay homage to the Life-Registering Dark Bureaucrat of the Left Prefecture’s Palace of the Great Yang.\nReverently pay homage to the Death-Registering Dark Bureaucrat of the Right Prefecture’s Palace of the Great Yin.\nReverently pay homage to the Spirit-Officials of the Fengdu Cauldron-Torture Hell, who determine guilt and examine ghosts.\nReverently pay homage to the Spirit-Officials of the Fengdu Wind-and-Thunder Hell, who determine guilt and examine ghosts.\nReverently pay homage to the Spirit-Officials of the Fengdu Bronze-Pillar Hell, who determine guilt and examine ghosts.\nReverently pay homage to the Spirit-Officials of the Fengdu Fire-Shroud Hell, who determine guilt and examine ghosts.\nReverently pay homage to the Spirit-Officials of the Fengdu Slaughter Hell, who determine guilt and examine ghosts.\nReverently pay homage to the Spirit-Officials of the Fengdu Vajra Hell, who determine guilt and examine ghosts.\nReverently pay homage to the Spirit-Officials of the Fengdu Fire-Cart Hell, who determine guilt and examine ghosts.\nReverently pay homage to the Spirit-Officials of the Fengdu Dark-and-Cold Hell, who determine guilt and examine ghosts.\nReverently pay homage to the Spirit-Officials of the Fengdu Universal-Torture Hell, who determine guilt and examine ghosts.\nReverently pay homage to the Spirit-Officials of the Fengdu Fire-Pit Hell, who determine guilt and examine ghosts.\nReverently pay homage to the Spirit-Officials of the Fengdu Filth-and-Filth Hell, who determine guilt and examine ghosts.\nReverently pay homage to the Spirit-Officials of the Fengdu Gorge-and-Stone Hell, who determine guilt and examine ghosts.\nReverently pay homage to the Spirit-Officials of the Fengdu Blood-Lake Hell, who determine guilt and examine ghosts.\nReverently pay homage to the Spirit-Officials of the Fengdu Great Iron Enclosure Mountain, who determine guilt and examine ghosts.\nReverently pay homage to the Spirit-Officials of the Fengdu Lesser Iron Enclosure Mountain, who determine guilt and examine ghosts.\nReverently pay homage to the Spirit-Officials of the Fengdu Avīci Hell, who determine guilt and examine ghosts.\nReverently pay homage to the Spirit-Officials of the Fengdu Uninterrupted Hell, who determine guilt and examine ghosts.\nReverently pay homage to the Spirit-Officials of all the great hells of Fengdu, who determine guilt and examine ghosts.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation from Suffering addressed the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct, saying: “I now disseminate this scripture of repentance throughout the ten thousand states, the nine provinces, and the worlds of the ten directions. If there are Dao-following people—men and women of the world—who, on the Three Primes, the Eight Festivals, the Five La Days, the Three Fu Fast Days, or birthdays and death anniversaries, awaken the supreme Dao-mind, encounter difficulties in childbirth or all manner of calamities, and recite these causes and conditions, all shall attain deliverance. Those who burn incense and pay homage to the names and titles of the Heavenly Worthies, Perfected Ones, and Celestial Masters shall have their souls ascend to Heaven, where they shall enjoy carefree bliss.”\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation from Suffering proclaimed this verse:\n\nThe true and numinous converge in assembly,\nThe sacred edict summons all spirits.\nSix heavens layer upon dark yin,\nFengdu’s nine gloomy hells.\nOfficials govern the nether caverns,\nThe Three Offices hold the nine bureaus.\nSpirit-officials and clerks in multitude,\nAll record and judge sins.\nDeliver those in peril from blood and birth,\nFree them from the suffering of the Three Wretched Paths.\nThe radiant Jade Prime Talisman shines,\nBreaking through the Blood Lake Hell.\nCharcoal furnaces bloom with blue lotuses,\nSwords and blades sprout forests of *jian* trees.\nFire pools transform into warm springs,\nCauldron-boiling waters become spring gardens.\nDeliver the souls of the long night,\nThat they may be reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss.\n\nThus concludes the *Precious Repentance for Deliverance from the Blood Lake*, proclaimed by the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity and Salvation from Suffering.",

The great and small Iron Enclosure Mountains all confine the souls of the blood-stained and the boundlessly foul, even unto the ghosts that devour fetal yellow spheres, who bring lawsuits before the Three Officials, and the green-faced, black-toothed deities who drag souls into the nine nether realms. The celestial wolves and celestial hounds vie in their ravenous might, while the Six Jias and Six Dings offer no protective power. Moving through kalpas without end, there is no hope of escape.\n\nThese are the souls of those who died in childbirth or from blood-related injuries, cast into this hell. The retribution for such sins stems from past lives filled with cruelty, harm to beings, disloyalty, unfiliality, inhumanity, and unrighteousness—indulging in the five defilements, their spiritual consciousness sunk in delusion, mired in the three evil destinies, their form and spirit scattered and disordered.\n\nYou, these sinful souls, bear the karmic debts of former lives, suffering retribution in these bodies—plagued by blood and corpses, their lives cut short in childbirth. Some carried the six *jia* months, their fate bound to the Three Origins, their children lost in miscarriage, dying in distress. Some mothers lived while their children perished; others perished while their children lived. Some mothers and children both died, male and female undifferentiated in death. Some perished as mere embryos; others, their forms barely formed, met sudden death. Some fell ill as their time of delivery neared; others, pregnant, suffered falls from high places. Some were poisoned by mistaken medicine; others succumbed to abscesses, dysentery, or other ailments. Some bled to death; others perished from incessant dripping. Some carried their fetuses to term yet never delivered; others gave birth only for their children to die within the month. Some died from blood diseases; others, wounded by blades, perished before their allotted years, cut down in their prime. Some fell in battle, their souls scattered amid arrows and stones; others met their end through grave illness or execution by royal decree. Their bodies were foul, their spirits dim, all who died in blood—reeking of filth, their forms putrid. For a thousand lives and ten thousand kalpas, there is no escape.\n\nMoreover, the suffering of the dark yin is most profound, the karmic retribution most severe. The Gorge Stone Hell is unseen and unheard; the Iron Enclosure rains endlessly, its thousand layers of sword-blades unsheathed. Towering peaks loom perilously, their summits split by a single chasm. Black mists shroud the mountains, the gloom arising of itself. Vile, poisonous juices flow and submerge the sinners, boiling their bodies and minds, their flesh and bones dissolving in unbearable agony. Moving through kalpas without end, they never glimpse the light. Heaven’s grace and decrees have never reached this place. The officials of the underworld torture them day and night without cease—devouring marrow, eating hearts, flaying bodies, hurling corpses. Of all the hells’ torments, the Blood Lake is the most grievous. Once trapped within its gates, when shall they find release?\"\n\nAt that time, the Sovereign of Salvation from Suffering, for the sake of all beings, proclaimed the True Talismans of the Most High, the Radiant Treasure Talismans, the Jade Registers of the Cinnabar Terrace, and the Flying Mystery Numinous Chapters, dispatching them to the dark prisons of all hells, straight to the Gorge Stone Blood Lake. Universally radiating light, they illuminated the dark abyss, shattering the iron city and drying the Blood Lake. The Ashen River transformed into a pool of jasper; the Gorge Stone became a seat of cool purity.\n\nThe sins of the common folk, their karmic debts, cannot be escaped. Those who were enemies in past lives become mother and child in this one. Who could have foreseen that from the very dream of bears and leopards, the ominous thoughts of owl and kite would arise? Scarcely had the ten months passed before they became ghosts of the nine springs. The wailing of infants—where do their wandering souls return? Some perished together after delivery; others died before parting. Their forms were foul, their natures dim—the souls of women who died in childbirth, trapped in the Blood Lake.\n\nMay all who have been born or are yet to be born swiftly attain the joy of life’s fulfillment; may all who have passed or will pass receive the profound benevolence of transformation. Moreover, all creatures of blood and breath—every being with a womb—share this same body. Those who harm fetuses or break eggs suffer bitterness and bear grievances. The evil causes of past lives manifest as karmic retribution in this one. Before the moon could wax full, the stirring of pregnancy was felt. Ghostly qi, though formless, poisoned the viscera; the hidden devouring of yellow spheres pierced liver and bowels. Some drank poison to destroy themselves.\"",

      "translated_text": "Some perished while clinging to illness, buried in the depths to await their turn—who pities their suffering? May their blood and qi find harmony, swiftly escaping the bounds of dark yin; may their souls attain clarity and uprightness, ascending to the halls of fortune and blessing.\n\nThere were those who fought over land and cities, from ancient times bearing the calamity of slaughter; those who schemed for kingship or hegemony, unluckily meeting the hour of battle. Just as they donned armor to join the ranks, they hoped to seize captives and return in triumph. Yet with strength outmatched and allies few, their qi spent and strength exhausted, their bodies became sustenance for blades upon the field, their bones interred in the wilds of green desolation. The distance to their homeland stretched too far; to whom could they turn for offerings? Snow piled high and ice hardened upon the vast, barren sands; under skies of gloom and rain’s damp, the night echoed with mournful wails. Though they gave their lives in loyal service to their nation, in truth they died blameless. Some could not escape their destined fate, yet still suffered mutilation. Such sinking into oblivion is truly pitiable. Within the Blood Lake Hell dwell the souls of men who fell in battle or perished on the field.\n\nMay auspicious clouds open the gate of life, sparing them from the realm of confusion; may divine power gather their wandering qi, granting rebirth in households of loyalty and righteousness.\n\nThere were those afflicted by strange maladies, not merely the sudden onset of misfortune; the retribution of past causes, whether good or ill, must be without error. If not for slander against the Three Treasures, then surely it was the harm done to living beings that brought this upon them. Those stricken with wind-leprosy saw their skin fester and rot; those tormented by carbuncles and ulcers endured blood and pus flowing unceasingly. Their gasps upon the pillow, their lingering ghosts beneath the springs—who would not recoil at the sight? Yet even in death, who pities them? Some succumbed to ceaseless vomiting and diarrhea, their bodies exuding foul, putrid stench. Without salvation, how could they attain liberation? Within the Blood Lake Hell dwell all those who died of ulcers, flux, wind-leprosy, sores, and festering wounds.\n\nMay their chronic ailments be healed and their forms restored, swiftly purifying the six senses; beneath the light of wisdom, may they together behold the guidance of the Three Treasures.\n\nMoreover, the laws of the realm stood clear, their statutes and ordinances fully established; yet human hearts, twisted and perverse, fell into the snares of punishment unawares. Did they not fear the severity of the law’s blade? Yet they could not endure the fury of a single moment’s wrath. The violent brawlers, the ruthless plunderers—when their souls fled at the clank of shackles, their heads were severed from their bodies; after their lives ended upon the execution ground, their flesh and blood dripped in pools. Though their bodies were cast into the charnel groves, their souls were bound in the subterranean depths. Their karmic ties unexhausted, their vengeful qi still lingered. Within the Blood Lake Hell dwell all those who met death by defying the king’s law.\n\nMay they hear the sacred scriptures of life, restoring form and spirit; may they hold the Register of the Primal Beginning, instantly dissolving their evil karma.\n\nThus, the Most High Lord of Salvation from Suffering emits nine-colored rays of auspicious light, illuminating all hells, pardoning the sinful souls, universally delivering all those trapped in the Blood Lake Hell from the woes of childbirth to behold the light of the sun.\n\nTherefore, we burn incense, surrender body and life, prostrate

May long-accumulated offenses be forever dissolved, and may blessings of peace and well-being be received.

Those who burn incense and pay homage to the names and titles of the Heavenly Worthies, Perfected Ones, and Celestial Masters shall have their souls ascend to Heaven, where they shall enjoy carefree bliss.”\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation from Suffering proclaimed this verse:\n\nThe true and numinous converge in assembly,\nThe sacred edict summons all spirits.\nSix heavens layer upon dark yin,\nFengdu’s nine gloomy hells.\nOfficials govern the nether caverns,\nThe Three Offices hold the nine bureaus.\nSpirit-officials and clerks in multitude,\nAll record and judge sins.\nDeliver those in peril from blood and birth,\nFree them from the suffering of the Three Wretched Paths.\nThe radiant Jade Prime Talisman shines,\nBreaking through the Blood Lake Hell.\nCharcoal furnaces bloom with blue lotuses,\nSwords and blades sprout forests of *jian* trees.\nFire pools transform into warm springs,\nCauldron-boiling waters become spring gardens.\nDeliver the souls of the long night,\nThat they may be reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss.\n\nThus concludes the *Precious Repentance for Deliverance from the Blood Lake*, proclaimed by the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity and Salvation from Suffering.",
