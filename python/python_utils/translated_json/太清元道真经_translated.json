  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Primordial Dao of the Origin**\n\n**Title:** *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Primordial Dao of the Origin* (*Taiqing Yuandao Zhenjing*). Author unknown. According to the postscript of the text, it was composed during the Tang dynasty. Three fascicles. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon* (*Zhengtong Daozang*), Proper Section I. Collated with the *Heshengzi Annotated Edition* of *The Supreme Lord Lao’s Scripture of the Primordial Dao of the Origin* (*Taishang Laojun Yuandao Zhenjing Zhujie*), classified under the *Jade Commentaries of the River Spirit Section* of the *Daoist Canon*.\n\n**Preface to *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Primordial Dao of the Origin***\n\nThe Primordial Dao is the supreme Dao above the Mysterious Origin, the esoteric heart-mind of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. During the *Yuanhe* era, the banished immortal Meng descended into the world. His parents had long accumulated utmost sincerity and purity, and his own nature was deeply compassionate and filial. They first received a revelation from Tao Datong of the Eastern Mountains, who foretold the transformations of life and death and commanded them to grasp the Root Origin. This Root Origin is the Primordial Dao. Later, they received a revelation from Fan Dajun of the Southern Lineage, who descended in the *wuxu* year and orally transmitted this scripture. Thus, it encompasses the great essentials of the cosmic pivot, directly pointing to the Dao of long life and enduring vision—indeed, as the *Yellow Court Scripture* says, \"The supreme Dao is not burdensome.\"\n\n**Fascicle One of *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Primordial Dao of the Origin***\n\nThe Primordial Dao is the supreme Dao above the Supreme Lord Lao’s Dao. The Lord Lao’s Dao has three levels: upper, middle, and lower. The *Yellow Court* Dao also has three levels: upper, middle, and lower. Moreover, all other Daos have three levels, each subordinate to the next. The Lord Lao’s middle Dao compares to the upper *Yellow Court* Dao, while other Daos are further subordinate. The Primordial Dao has three levels, and this scripture represents its highest, hence called the *Primordial Supreme Primordial Dao*. This Dao is supremely exalted, empty and primordial, mysterious and subtle, tranquil and formless, moving in accord with nature—thus, scholars find it difficult to approach. Unless one is a superior person of swift and profound insight, one cannot study it. Unless one is reverent in the face of death and ardently aspires to life, one cannot study it. Many who practice the middle and lower Daos admire and emulate the higher, yet this Dao is difficult to attain, and thus it has rarely been transmitted. If a superior person of swift insight practices it with singular devotion, they will naturally attain the primordial measure—what is called the *empty tranquility of the primordial measure*, the *unobstructed ease of the primordial measure*, the *unfettered joy of the primordial measure*.\n\nMoreover, all other Daos require a master to serve and prescribe penalties for transgressions, but this Dao has no master to serve and thus no penalties. All other Daos require selecting a quiet mountain retreat or a separate thatched hut to practice; otherwise, harm may result. Only this Dao can be accomplished amidst the dust of the world.\n\nThe scripture states: \"Inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth can dispel superficial cold and empty heat, but it cannot expel accumulated turbid *qi*. Regulating *qi* can open the hundred passages and govern the myriad illnesses, but it is not the restoration of primordial *qi*. Swallowing *qi* can relieve hunger and weakness, but it is not natural fullness. Circulating *qi* can moisten the vessels and gladden the skin, but it is not the eternal Dao.\" This Dao is the way of returning to the root and restoring life, hence called the *Primordial Dao*. Such practices as strengthening the sinews and replenishing the marrow, securing and protecting the five viscera, purifying and benefiting the Mud Pill Palace, stabilizing the residence of the cinnabar spirit, ensuring the six senses do not recklessly enter and the three treasures do not recklessly depart, expelling all turbidity, and allowing true *qi* to wander freely—ascending through the Great Void to the Jade Clarity Heaven and becoming a perfected lord—all belong to this Dao.\n\n**Fascicle One of *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Primordial Dao of the Origin***\n\n*(Note: The character \"學\" (study) is missing in the original; supplied according to the *Heshengzi Annotated Edition*. The same applies to the next instance of \"學.\")*\n\n**Fascicle Two of *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Primordial Dao of the Origin***\n\nHumans are the most spiritually endowed among the myriad beings, born together with heaven and earth at the inception of the primordial void. They take form through the coagulation of primordial *qi*. Once the physical body is established, the spirits of the ten heavens descend into it, becoming the human spirit, and thus a person is formed. Since humans are born together with heaven and earth at the inception of the primordial void, they should naturally share the same longevity as heaven and earth. Yet while heaven and earth endure, humans do not—why is this? It is because heaven and earth remain tranquil and harmonious, unchanging in their fundamental nature, perpetually abiding in the primordial void, serene and untroubled, attaining the Dao of nature, and thus their primordial *qi* does not dissipate. Humans, however, cannot endure because they indulge in deluded thoughts, deviate from their fundamental nature, fail to uphold the natural, do not guard their root, and bring labor upon themselves. Moreover, they constantly seek self-benefit, causing their primordial *qi* to scatter and preventing them from enduring.\n\nThe six thieves arise recklessly: the eyes recklessly see, the ears recklessly hear, the nose recklessly discerns fragrance and stench, the mouth recklessly speaks of flavors, the body recklessly engages in labor, and the mind recklessly ponders. Thus, they never return to the root. Therefore, returning to the root enables one to endure and attain long life. The Dao of the True One, which enables one to endure and return to the root, is the restoration of primordial *qi*. The way to restore primordial *qi* is nothing other than profound stillness. If one can constantly return the mind to profound stillness, primordial *qi* will naturally be restored.\n\nThe method for restoring primordial *qi*:\nOne should always observe the signs of breath regulation. When the mind-source is profoundly still, the breath gradually becomes subtle. Reducing the breath by half doubles one’s lifespan. From reducing the breath to the cessation of breath, one restores the primordial and returns to the root, thereby attaining the ability to abide in the world. Ordinary people regard having breath as normal. Sages regard the cessation of breath as normal—active, they have breath; still, they have no breath. Thus, having breath or not having breath is spontaneous. Practitioners of the Primordial Dao should always regard the cessation of breath as normal and having breath as delusion, the cessation of breath as correct and having breath as incorrect. In profound stillness, nurturing *qi*, the three spirits rejoice, the three *hun* souls are at ease, and the spirit and *po* soul are joyful—thus, primordial *qi* is naturally restored.\n\nThe *Yellow Court* Dao prescribes thirty-six cautions, and responding to each from one to thirty-six constitutes half the achievement. Other Daos also require many cautions, but this supreme Primordial Dao achieves success with a single caution and three responses. The single caution is to be cautious in rest and cessation. Without rest and cessation, one cannot attain the Primordial Dao. The three responses are the three transformations of the mind, each requiring a hundred days. The first transformation of the mind responds for a hundred days: whether in affairs or non-affairs, one may cease breath—this is the first transformation of the mind, called the initial shame of having affairs cease and non-affairs proceed. Practicing this stills worldly concerns and increases empty tranquility, constituting the first transformation and response—thus, the lesser achievement is accomplished.\n\nThe second transformation of the mind responds for two hundred days: suddenly, one ceases of itself—this is the second transformation of the mind. By this stage, one no longer craves the taste of grains, and neither great hunger nor thirst arises—this is the second transformation and response, and the middle achievement is accomplished.\n\nThe third transformation of the mind responds for three hundred days: utterly, one abides of itself—this is the third transformation of the mind. By this stage, hunger and thirst do not reach one, cold and heat cannot invade, the register of death is forever erased, and one’s lifespan equals that of Heaven and Earth—this is the third transformation and response. Completing thirty-one cycles, the great achievement is accomplished.\n\nThe Great Lord says: Whether in affairs or non-affairs, all may be ceased—this is the sprouting of achievement. Whether in affairs or non-affairs, all may be ceased—thus, the primordial *qi* gradually returns. Suddenly ceasing of itself—this is the primordial *qi* nearing stability. Utterly abiding of itself—this is the primordial *qi* returning to the root and stabilizing.\n\nThe Great Lord says: From cessation of breath to primordial breath, from primordial breath to stability—this stability neither grasps nor rejects; it is the stability of the Primordial, not the stability of rigid fixation. Those who attain this stability find yin and yang naturally harmonized, the four seasons naturally transcended, the primordial *qi* naturally full, and the host of spirits naturally settled. Thus, they penetrate the profound and mysterious.\n\nTherefore, when yin and yang are harmonized, the hundred diseases do not arise; when the four seasons are transcended, neither scorching heat nor freezing cold affects one; when the primordial *qi* is full, neither hunger nor thirst arises; when the host of spirits abides, neither weapons nor tigers can harm; when wisdom penetrates the profound and mysterious, the myriad affairs do not arise.\n\nThe Great Lord says: When a person’s thoughts and concerns are not unified, the primordial *qi* scatters. When the achievement of this Dao is complete, false thoughts do not stir, and what arises is never unwholesome; what is employed is never misapplied. Thus, what is not fitting is not employed, and what is not employed is not aroused. Therefore, there are wholesome arousal, wise arousal, and penetrating arousal—all arise naturally of themselves. Thus, there is no arising of joy, anger, desire, contention, morning fear, love, or aversion.\n\nThe Great Lord says: Longevity is nothing other than the completeness of spirit, *qi*, and form. When spirit is complete, one delights in emptiness and void, rejoices in clarity and stillness, and abides in profound *qi*-harmony—thus, the spirit is naturally complete. When the primordial *qi* is replete and accumulated, both form and spirit endure forever. When both spirit and *qi* are complete, one ascends as an immortal by merely raising the body.\n\nThe *Scripture on Abiding in Qi and Concurrent Practice* says: The achievement of regulating *qi* and ceasing breath is as described; the achievement of abiding in *qi* and concurrent practice is twice as great. Abiding in *qi* means awaiting the spirit and *qi* to settle in tranquility, then abiding therein to its utmost—this is one cycle. Each time one can practice five or six cycles before the cry of the parrot, gradually increasing to ten cycles. Practicing the Dao of ceasing breath in this manner, the achievement doubles in speed.\n\nBe cautious of violent exhalation and sudden exertion. Initially, one cannot avoid them, but one should be cautious of sudden exertion and violent exhalation, and in the end, both should become subtle.\n\nThe Great Lord says: Abiding in *qi* can open the hundred passages, dissolve obstructions, heal the myriad illnesses, and guide the primordial *qi*. When the hundred passages are open, illnesses are dispelled; where the primordial *qi* flows, the pathways of essence circulate. Where the primordial *qi* and fluids reach, there is eternal incorruptibility—this is called \"golden marrow and jade bones,\" attaining longevity and immortality.\n\nThe Great Lord says: Ceasing breath and abiding in *qi* both succeed through the stability of primordial breath and *qi*. If one practices only breath reduction, the achievement is slow; if one practices only abiding in *qi*, it is difficult to reach primordial breath. If one opens the hundred passages while concurrently ceasing breath, the primordial *qi* easily fills and overflows, and the achievement doubles.\n\nThe *Perfect Scripture of the Primordial Dao of Great Clarity, Middle Scroll* concludes.\n\n---\n\nThe *Perfect Scripture of the Primordial Dao of Great Clarity, Lower Scroll* only presents the titles of its opening chapters, and their contents are not seen—only when the Dao is accomplished and one is about to ascend may they be witnessed. These speak of the repayment of achievement, where one achievement yields ten thousand rewards, roughly akin to the Nine Bestowments of Lord Mao. This is the supreme Dao, a hundredfold greater. Those who study the primordial Dao must not shirk diligence.\n\nThe lower scroll’s opening titles number several dozen, but only five are recorded by later sages:\n1. *Repayment of Achievement*\n2. *Repayment of Aspiration*\n3. *Repayment of Non-Retreat*\n4. *Repayment of Non-Delusion*\n5. *Repayment of No-Need-for-Abandonment*\n\n---\n\n*Separate Record of the Primordial Dao*:\nThe Primordial Dao is nothing other than this: be cautious in rest and cessation. Without rest and cessation, the myriad affairs cannot be properly arranged.\n\nWorldly scholars may find it difficult to practice constantly and may occasionally rest, but even in rest, one must not be incautious. Hereafter are recorded the cautions for those who temporarily rest:\n\n- One great sigh: deduct two days\n- One minor fatigue: deduct thirty days (fifteen great sighs constitute one minor fatigue)\n- One major fatigue: deduct sixty days (thirty great sighs constitute one major fatigue)\n- One outburst of anger: deduct ten days\n- One minor intoxication: deduct fifty days\n- One major intoxication: deduct one hundred days\n- One instance of sexual indulgence: deduct ten days\n- One instance of negligence: deduct twenty days\n- One instance of fear: deduct seven days\n- One instance of anger: deduct thirty days\n- One instance of hunger: deduct three days\n- One instance of overeating: deduct five days\n- One transgression of desire: deduct fifty days\n- One instance of fright: deduct ten days\n- One instance of labor or fatigue: deduct five days each\n\nMoreover, dietary transgressions, excessive cold or heat, exposure to wind or dampness, irregular daily life, scattered speech, and restless thoughts—all these harm the primordial *qi*. The deductions vary according to the severity of the transgression. All instances of \"deduction\" refer to the actual loss of achievement.\n\nCultivators of the Primordial Dao must be deeply cautious. The primordial *qi* is difficult to accumulate yet easy to scatter; the joints are easy to block yet difficult to open. Abiding in *qi* must not be severed, and what is attained must be cherished.\n\nThis scripture was transmitted through the bloodline from the Most High Lord Lao of Great Antiquity, passed down through nineteen successive masters before ceasing—all of whom ascended to the ranks of immortals, occupying the highest positions. The scripture did not remain in the world. In the *wuxu* year of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang (798 CE), the Southern Lineage’s Lord Fan orally transmitted it to Meng the Banished Immortal, who in turn orally transmitted it to Wang Xuyuan. Xuyuan established three scrolls, expounding the essentials of the Primordial Dao.\n\nThe *Perfect Scripture of the Primordial Dao of Great Clarity, Lower Scroll* concludes.",

      "translated_text": "The second transformation of the mind responds for two hundred days: suddenly, one ceases of itself—this is the second transformation of the mind. By this stage, one no longer craves the taste of grains, and neither great hunger nor thirst arises—this is the second transformation and response, and the middle achievement is accomplished.\n\nThe third transformation of the mind responds for three hundred days: utterly, one abides of itself—this is the third transformation of the mind. By this stage, hunger and thirst do not reach one, cold and heat cannot invade, the register of death is forever erased, and one’s lifespan equals that of Heaven and Earth—this is the third transformation and response. Completing thirty-one cycles, the great achievement is accomplished.\n\nThe Great Lord says: Whether in affairs or non-affairs, all may be ceased—this is the sprouting of achievement. Whether in affairs or non-affairs, all may be ceased—thus, the primordial *qi* gradually returns. Suddenly ceasing of itself—this is the primordial *qi* nearing stability. Utterly abiding of itself—this is the primordial *qi* returning to the root and stabilizing.\n\nThe Great Lord says: From cessation of breath to primordial breath, from primordial breath to stability—this stability neither grasps nor rejects; it is the stability of the Primordial, not the stability of rigid fixation. Those who attain this stability find yin and yang naturally harmonized, the four seasons naturally transcended, the primordial *qi* naturally full, and the host of spirits naturally settled. Thus, they penetrate the profound and mysterious.\n\nTherefore, when yin and yang are harmonized, the hundred diseases do not arise; when the four seasons are transcended, neither scorching heat nor freezing cold affects one; when the primordial *qi* is full, neither hunger nor thirst arises; when the host of spirits abides, neither weapons nor tigers can harm; when wisdom penetrates the profound and mysterious, the myriad affairs do not arise.\n\nThe Great Lord says: When a person’s thoughts and concerns are not unified, the primordial *qi* scatters. When the achievement of this Dao is complete, false thoughts do not stir, and what arises is never unwholesome; what is employed is never misapplied. Thus, what is not fitting is not employed, and what is not employed is not aroused. Therefore, there are wholesome arousal, wise arousal, and penetrating arousal—all arise naturally of themselves. Thus, there is no arising of joy, anger, desire, contention, morning fear, love, or aversion.\n\nThe Great Lord says: Longevity is nothing other than the completeness of spirit, *qi*, and form. When spirit is complete, one delights in emptiness and void, rejoices in clarity and stillness, and abides in profound *qi*-harmony—thus, the spirit is naturally complete. When the primordial *qi* is replete and accumulated, both form and spirit endure forever. When both spirit and *qi* are complete, one ascends as an immortal by merely raising the body.\n\nThe *Scripture on Abiding in Qi and Concurrent Practice* says: The achievement of regulating *qi* and ceasing breath is as described; the achievement of abiding in *qi* and concurrent practice is twice as great. Abiding in *qi* means awaiting the spirit and *qi* to settle in tranquility, then abiding therein to its utmost—this is one cycle. Each time one can practice five or six cycles before the cry of the parrot, gradually increasing to ten cycles. Practicing the Dao of ceasing breath in this manner, the achievement doubles in speed.\n\nBe cautious of violent exhalation and sudden exertion. Initially, one cannot avoid them, but one should be cautious of sudden exertion and violent exhalation, and in the end, both should become subtle.\n\nThe Great Lord says: Abiding in *qi* can open the hundred passages, dissolve obstructions, heal the myriad illnesses, and guide the primordial *qi*. When the hundred passages are open, illnesses are dispelled; where the primordial *qi* flows, the pathways of essence circulate. Where the primordial *qi* and fluids reach, there is eternal incorruptibility—this is called \"golden marrow and jade bones,\" attaining longevity and immortality.\n\nThe Great Lord says: Ceasing breath and abiding in *qi* both succeed through the stability of primordial breath and *qi*. If one practices only breath reduction, the achievement is slow; if one practices only abiding in *qi*, it is difficult to reach primordial breath. If one opens the hundred passages while concurrently ceasing breath, the primordial *qi* easily fills and overflows, and the achievement doubles.\n\nThe *Perfect Scripture of the Primordial Dao of Great Clarity, Middle Scroll* concludes.\n\n---\n\nThe *Perfect Scripture of the Primordial Dao of Great Clarity, Lower Scroll* only presents the titles of its opening chapters, and their contents are not seen—only when the Dao is accomplished and one is about to ascend may they be witnessed. These speak of the repayment of achievement, where one achievement yields ten thousand rewards, roughly akin to the Nine Bestowments of Lord Mao. This is the supreme Dao, a hundredfold greater. Those who study the primordial Dao must not shirk diligence.\n\nThe lower scroll’s opening titles number several dozen, but only five are recorded by later sages:\n1. *Repayment of Achievement*\n2. *Repayment of Aspiration*\n3. *Repayment of Non-Retreat*\n4. *Repayment of Non-Delusion*\n5. *Repayment of No-Need-for-Abandonment*\n\n---\n\n*Separate Record of the Primordial Dao*:\nThe Primordial Dao is nothing other than this: be cautious in rest and cessation. Without rest and cessation, the myriad affairs cannot be properly arranged.\n\nWorldly scholars may find it difficult to practice constantly and may occasionally rest, but even in rest, one must not be incautious. Hereafter are recorded the cautions for those who temporarily rest:\n\n- One great sigh: deduct two days\n- One minor fatigue: deduct thirty days (fifteen great sighs constitute one minor fatigue)\n- One major fatigue: deduct sixty days (thirty great sighs constitute one major fatigue)\n- One outburst of anger: deduct ten days\n- One minor intoxication: deduct fifty days\n- One major intoxication: deduct one hundred days\n- One instance of sexual indulgence: deduct ten days\n- One instance of negligence: deduct twenty days\n- One instance of fear: deduct seven days\n- One instance of anger: deduct thirty days\n- One instance of hunger: deduct three days\n- One instance of overeating: deduct five days\n- One transgression of desire: deduct fifty days\n- One instance of fright: deduct ten days\n- One instance of labor or fatigue: deduct five days each\n\nMoreover, dietary transgressions, excessive cold or heat, exposure to wind or dampness, irregular daily life, scattered speech, and restless thoughts—all these harm the primordial *qi*. The deductions vary according to the severity of the transgression. All instances of \"deduction\" refer to the actual loss of achievement.\n\nCultivators of the Primordial Dao must be deeply cautious. The primordial *qi* is difficult to accumulate yet easy to scatter; the joints are easy to block yet difficult to open. Abiding in *qi* must not be severed, and what is attained must be cherished.\n\nThis scripture was transmitted through the bloodline from the Most High Lord Lao of Great Antiquity, passed down through nineteen successive masters before ceasing—all of whom ascended to the ranks of immortals, occupying the highest positions. The scripture did not remain in the world. In the *wuxu* year of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang (798 CE), the Southern Lineage’s Lord Fan orally transmitted it to Meng the Banished Immortal, who in turn orally transmitted it to Wang Xuyuan. Xuyuan established three scrolls, expounding the essentials of the Primordial Dao.\n\nThe *Perfect Scripture of the Primordial Dao of Great Clarity, Lower Scroll* concludes.",
      "overlap_context": "hree responses are the three transformations of the mind, each requiring a hundred days. The first transformation of the mind responds for a hundred days: whether in affairs or non-affairs, one may cease breath—this is the first transformation of the mind, called the initial shame of having affairs cease and non-affairs proceed. Practicing this stills worldly concerns and increases empty tranquility, constituting the first transformation and response—thus, the lesser achievement is accomplished.",
