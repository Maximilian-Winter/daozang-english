  "full_translation": "**Soushen Ji**\n\n**Title:** *Soushen Ji* (*Records of Spirits Investigated*). Six juan. Likely compiled during the Ming dynasty. Base text from: *Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon*.\n\n**Preface to the Soushen Ji**\n\nWhat does one guard against in spirits? They are the essences of the myriad things. They enact the Dao for the people, toil to stabilize the state, diligently serve in governance, defend against calamities, and manifest as wondrous phenomena in mountains, forests, rivers, valleys, and hills—where clouds arise, winds and rains form, and strange beings appear. All these are called *shen* (spirits). Their *qi* ascends and flourishes above, becoming radiant light, the rustling of reeds, and mournful cries.\n\nThe rites of sacrifice honor the spirits of all under heaven, for they are held in great reverence. In former times, Yu Changshi of Xincai compiled a *Soushen Ji* in thirty juan. Liu Dan, upon seeing it, remarked: \"Ghosts are to the people of Jin what Dong Hu was to history—a faithful recorder. Yet a thousand years have passed, and even the finest editions have crumbled. Though some survive in fragments, barely a tenth remains, and even these are riddled with omissions, inviting endless criticism.\"\n\nI, unworthy as I am, have long wandered in pursuit of livelihood, traversing Yan and Que, exploring the lands of Zou and Lu, journeying through Qi and Liang, and descending into the regions of Wu, Chu, Ou, and Yue. Everywhere I went, I delved into the boundaries of the numinous and the divine, encountering marvels without end, all of which I have meticulously recorded.\n\nIn the *guisi* year of the Wanli reign’s first era (1593), I arrived in the auxiliary capital and, while perusing books and records, obtained a copy of the *Soushen Ji* from Sanshan Fuchun Hall. Upon reading it, I found that its carvings were organized by category and volume, each accompanied by illustrations—a quality I, in my inadequacy, could not match. What I had previously seen paled in comparison; this edition neither slavishly followed the old nor merely expanded upon it. Instead, it captured what was previously obscure, filled what was lacking, and achieved a brilliance truly worthy of the spirits.\n\nIts essence lies in fostering blessings for the people and upholding the imperial realm for ten thousand generations. Could even one as unworthy as I fail to feel the same admiration in my heart as Liu Jun did for Dong Hu?\n\nAlas, the realms of the unseen and the visible are intertwined! Spirits endure in memory only through their numinosity, and records preserve their numinosity for posterity. Those who wear towering caps and trailing sashes, who command respect and protection, are rightly called *shen*. Yet if their lives and deeds, like grass and wood, rot into oblivion, leaving no trace in the annals of history, how could this be just?\n\n**Soushen Ji, Juan One**\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n**Lineages of the Ru, Shi, and Daoist Traditions**\n\n**Appendices:**\n*Shengmu (Holy Mother)*\n*Supreme August Jade Emperor and Sacred Ancestral Titles*\n*Shengmu’s Titles*\n*Queen of the Earth, Houtu*\n*Eastern August Lord (Donghuang Dijun), also known as the Eastern King (Dongwang Gong)*\n*Queen Mother of the West (Xiwang Mu)*\n*Supreme August Emperor of the Upper Prime (Shangyuan Yipin Dadi)*\n*August Emperor of the Middle Prime (Zhongyuan Erpin Dadi)*\n*August Emperor of the Lower Prime (Xiayuan Sanpin Dadi)*\n*The Five Sacred Peaks:*\n- *Eastern Peak (Dongyue)*\n- *Southern Peak (Nanyue)*\n- *Western Peak (Xiyue)*\n- *Northern Peak (Beiyue)*\n- *Central Peak (Zhongyue)*\n*The Four Luminous Deities*\n*The Five Directions’ Deities*\n*The Essence of Taiyi*\n*Jianwu*\n*Zhu Yin*\n*Thunder Deity*\n*Lightning Deity*\n*Appendices: Wind Earl and Rain Master*\n\n---\n\n**Lineage of the Ru Tradition**\n*Birthday: The Fifteenth Day of the Ninth Month*\n\nThe Ultimate Sage, Cultured and Propagating King (Zhisheng Wenxuan Wang), hailing from Queli in Changping Township, Lu, traced his ancestry to the state of Song. His great-grandfather, Kong Fangshu, fled the turmoil of Hua Du’s rebellion in Song and resettled in Lu, where he fathered Bosha. Bosha begot Shuliang He, whose eldest son, Meng Pi (styled Boniu), was afflicted with illness and unfit to inherit. His second son was the Ultimate Sage.\n\nIn the twenty-first year of Duke Xiang of Lu, on the winter solstice of the tenth month (gengzi day), the Ultimate Sage was born. That night, two dragons encircled the chamber, and the Five Elders descended into the courtyard—the Five Elders being the essences of the five planets. His mother, Lady Yan, dreamed of the celestial music of *Goutian*, and a voice resounded from the void: *\"Heaven, moved, gives birth to a sagely son,\"* accompanied by the harmonious strains of reed pipes and flutes. His head bore a protuberance at the crown, hence his name *Qiu* (\"Mound\"), styled *Zhongni*.\n\nOrphaned in youth, he buried his father on Mount Fang. The Ultimate Sage stood nine *chi* and two *cun* tall, his waist spanning ten *wei*. His forty-nine garments draped backward, his head inclined forward, his face bearing the marks of the moon and sun. Seated, he resembled a crouching dragon; standing, a perched phoenix. From afar, he appeared unrefined; up close, towering. His ears hung like pearls, his forehead broad as a tortoise’s shell, his form dragon-like, his palms tiger-like, his cheeks full, his chest ample, his eyes like rivers, his mouth vast as the sea, his navel deep as a mountain, his back broad as a forest, his arms winged, his lips like a tadpole’s, his head sloping, his nose tortoise-like, his complexion rich, his brows like embankments, his feet grounded, his voice thunderous, his abdomen expansive, his countenance radiant, his cheeks luminous, his teeth aligned like a steed’s. His brows bore twelve hues, his eyes sixty-four patterns. His head resembled Yao’s, his forehead Shun’s, his beard Gaoyao’s, his shoulders Zichan’s. From the waist down, he fell three *cun* short of Yu. Possessing the virtue of a great sage, his learning encompassed heaven and humanity, his Dao plumbed the profound and arcane. He mastered the scriptures borne by tortoises and dragons, the affairs of the Seven Governors and Five Wefts, the arts of Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor, and the virtues of Yao, Shun, and the Duke of Zhou.\n\nDuke Ding of Lu appointed him Magistrate of Zhongdu. Within a year, the feudal lords of the four directions emulated his governance. In the ninth year, he became Prefect of Yi; in the tenth, Minister of Works; and in the eleventh, Grand Minister of Justice, acting as Chancellor. In the fourteenth year, he executed Shaozheng Mao, a Lu minister who had disrupted governance. After three months of overseeing state affairs, the markets saw no haggling over prices, men and women walked separate paths, and lost items remained unclaimed on the roads. Visitors to the capital required no official summons—they were all received and sent off with propriety.\n\nAfter fourteen years away from Lu, in the eleventh year of Duke Ai, the Ultimate Sage returned and edited the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*, codified the *Rites* and *Music*, and completed the Six Arts. In his later years, he delighted in the *Book of Changes*, plumbing its mysteries of heaven and earth. He composed the *Tuanzhuan*, *Xiangzhuan*, *Wenyan*, and *Xici* to elucidate its secrets. To his disciples at the southern bank of the Wei and northern bank of the Si, he imparted his teachings. His disciples numbered three thousand, with seventy-two who attained mastery and sixty thousand who achieved broad learning.\n\nBefore the Ultimate Sage’s birth, a qilin appeared in Queli, spitting forth a jade tablet inscribed: *\"Son of the Water Essence’s lineage, a plain-clothed king in Zhou’s decline.\"* Lady Yan, astonished, struck the qilin’s horn with an embroidered sash. By dawn, the qilin had vanished. In the fourteenth year of Duke Ai, during a western hunt at Taiye, Shusun’s charioteer, Chu Shang, captured a strange beast, deeming it inauspicious. The Ultimate Sage examined it and said, *\"It is a qilin. Why has it come?\"* He turned his sleeve to wipe his face, his tears staining his lapels. Only then did Shusun retrieve it, finding the sash still tied to its horn. The Ultimate Sage sighed, *\"My Dao is exhausted.\"* He then composed the *Spring and Autumn Annals* based on Lu’s chronicles, infusing praise and censure to convey the mandate of restoration. The qilin’s appearance heralded heaven’s decree—an omen of the Ultimate Sage’s passing.\n\nOn his sickbed, the Ultimate Sage dreamed he stood between the pillars of a hall. Zigong sought an audience, and the Sage said, *\"You, carrying a staff, wander leisurely at the gate. Why have you come so late, Ci?\"* He sighed, *\"Is Mount Tai collapsing? Is the ridgepole crumbling? Is the wise man withering?\"* Tears streamed down his face. Zigong replied, *\"The world has long been without the Dao. None could revere you.\"* Seven days later, he passed away at the age of seventy-three. In the sixteenth year of Duke Ai, on the summer solstice of the fourth month (jichou day), he was buried in the Zhuang district of Lu’s capital. In the eleventh year of Duke Ai, a temple was erected at his former residence, with a hundred households assigned to guard his tomb. His disciples observed three years of mourning, then parted ways, weeping until their grief was spent. Some lingered, but only Zigong remained by the tomb for six years before departing. His disciples enshrined the Ultimate Sage’s robes, cap, zither, carriage, and writings in the temple. The people of Lu and his disciples built over a hundred chambers around his tomb, naming it the Kong Clan’s Eternal Abode. Sacrifices were offered at the tomb in perpetuity, with descendants inheriting the lineage without interruption.\n\nThe sagely dynasty revered him, posthumously bestowing the title *Ultimate Sage, Cultured and Propagating King*. His wife was honored as *Lady of Deng State*, his father as *Duke of Qi*, and his mother as *Grand Lady of Lu*.\n\n---\n\n**Lineage of the Shi Tradition**\n*Birthday: The Eighth Day of the Fourth Month*\n\nŚākyamuni Buddha, of the *kṣatriya* caste, was born to King Śuddhodana and Queen Māyā. Before descending to the human realm, he resided in Tuṣita Heaven as the *bodhisattva* *Vijaya* (Victorious), also known as *Rāhula* (Guardian of Light). He expounded the *bodhisattva* path to the heavenly hosts and manifested in the ten directions to preach the Dharma.\n\nThe *Sūtra of Universal Radiance* states: When the Buddha was first born into the *kṣatriya* royal house, he emitted a great light of wisdom that illumined the ten directions. Golden lotuses surged from the earth to naturally support his feet. He strode seven steps in each of the four directions—east, west, south, and north—then raised a finger toward heaven and earth, roaring like a lion: \"Above, below, and in the four quarters, none is my equal.\" This occurred in the twenty-fourth year of King Zhao of Zhou, the *jiayin* year, on the eighth day of the fourth month.\n\nBy the forty-second year of his reign, on the eighth day of the third month, the Buddha was nineteen years old. Contemplating his future, he thought, \"When shall I encounter the right time?\" Observing the four gates, he witnessed four kinds of suffering—birth, aging, sickness, and death—and his heart filled with sorrow and resolve. He reflected, \"This cycle of old age, illness, and death is truly to be renounced.\" That night, at midnight, a deva named *Zhengju* appeared at his window, clasped his hands, and addressed the prince: \"The time for leaving home has come; you may depart.\" Overjoyed, the prince immediately leapt over the city walls and retreated to Mount Dantig to cultivate the Dao.\n\nFirst, he studied the \"state of neither perception nor non-perception\" under *Ārāḍa Kālāma* for three years, but recognizing its inadequacy, he abandoned it. He then went to *Udraka Rāmaputra* and studied the same state for another three years, only to discard it as well. Next, he journeyed to Elephant Head Mountain, where he practiced with other ascetics, subsisting on sesame and wheat for six years. As the scriptures say: \"With no-mind and no-reliance, he subdued all external paths.\" Having tested heterodox methods and demonstrated various expedient means, he dispelled divergent views and attained bodhi.\n\nThus, the *Sūtra of Universal Assembly* records: On the eighth day of the second month, as the morning star appeared, the bodhisattva attained buddhahood and became the *Teacher of Gods and Humans* at the age of thirty. This was the third year of King Mu of Zhou, the *guiwei* year. Thereafter, at Deer Park, he turned the Dharma wheel of the Four Noble Truths for Kauṇḍinya and four others, expounding the fruits of the path. He taught for forty-nine years, then addressed his disciple Mahākāśyapa: \"I now entrust to you the pure Dharma-eye, the wondrous mind of nirvāṇa, the true mark of the non-mark, and the subtle true Dharma. You must guard and uphold it. Assist Ānanda in propagating it, ensuring it is never severed.\" He then spoke this verse:\n\nThe Dharma is originally Dharma-less,\nA Dharma-less Dharma is also Dharma.\nNow, entrusting the Dharma-less,\nHow could Dharma ever be Dharma?\n\nHaving spoken this verse, the World-Honored One further instructed Mahākāśyapa: \"I now transmit to you this golden-thread *saṃghāṭī* robe. Pass it on to the next buddha-to-be until Maitreya appears in the world. Do not let it decay.\" Mahākāśyapa, hearing the verse, prostrated at the Buddha’s feet and said: \"Excellent! Excellent! I shall obey with reverence and devotion.\"\n\nLater, the World-Honored One arrived at the city of Kuśinagara and addressed the great assembly: \"I now suffer back pain and wish to enter nirvāṇa.\" He proceeded to the banks of the Ajitavatī River, beneath a pair of *śāla* trees. Lying on his right side with feet stacked, he entered tranquil extinction. He then arose from the coffin to preach the Dharma for his mother, miraculously displaying his feet to the elders of *Vāśiṣṭha*, and spoke this verse on impermanence:\n\nAll conditioned things are impermanent,\nSubject to arising and ceasing.\nHaving ceased, their stilling is bliss.\n\nHis disciples then cremated him with fragrant firewood. After the flames subsided, the golden coffin remained intact. The assembly chanted this verse before the Buddha:\n\nHow could worldly fires burn fiercely?\nThe fire of the sages’ samādhi\nConsumes the golden-hued body of Yama.\n\nAt that moment, the golden coffin rose from its seat and soared into the sky, circling seven *tāla* trees before the fire of samādhi reduced it to ashes. Eight *hū* and four *dou* of relics were collected. This occurred on the fifteenth day of the second month in the fifty-second year of King Mu of Zhou, the *renchen* year.\n\nOne thousand seventeen years after the World-Honored One’s nirvāṇa, his teachings reached the Middle Kingdom. Emperor Ming of the Later Han dreamed of a golden figure, tall and radiant, with sun and moon light at his neck. Upon consulting his ministers, one said: \"In the West there is a deity called Buddha. Could this be whom Your Majesty dreamed?\" The emperor dispatched envoys to India to inquire about the Dao. They returned with scriptures and monks. The monks explained: \"The Buddha stands sixteen feet tall, with a golden complexion and sun-and-moon light at his neck. His transformations are boundless, and he pervades all things, greatly benefiting sentient beings.\"\n\n**Lineage of the Daoist Tradition – The Fifteenth Day of the Second Month**\n*The Sacred Birth of the Supreme Venerable Sovereign, Lord Lao of the Golden Portal*\n\nAccording to the *Scripture of the Nine True Teachings of the Primordial Lord of the Numinous Treasure*, the Dao Lord addressed the emperor: \"Before heaven and earth divided and yin and yang separated, there was boundless chaos, vast and dark, without light. Within it, the sacred and spontaneous arose, and from a hundred million myriad layers of primordial qi, the Wondrous Non-Being Sage Lord was born. His august titles include *Mysterious Non-Being Supreme Emperor* and *Primordial Celestial Worthy of Original Commencement*, also called *Heavenly Treasure Elder*.\n\nAfter nine hundred ninety-nine trillion, nine hundred ninety-nine billion, nine hundred ninety million kalpas, from a hundred million myriad layers of true qi, the Wondrous Being Sage Lord was born. He styled himself *Mysterious Being Great Emperor*, *Vacuous Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord*, also called *Numinous Treasure Elder*.\n\nAfter eight hundred eighty-eight billion, eight hundred eighty million kalpas, from a hundred million myriad layers of Dao-qi, the Chaos Sage Lord was born. His title is *Perfect Great Emperor of Myriad Transformations*, *Chaos Primordial Lord Lao*, also called *Divine Treasure Elder*.\n\nAs recorded in the *Scripture of the Sacred Records of Lord Lao*, the Supreme Venerable Sovereign dwells in the Grand Purity, the ancestral origin of primordial qi and the root of heaven and earth. Within the utmost quiescence and emptiness, before the Great Beginning and Great Commencement, he alone governed the unfolding of qi, refining essence to initiate transformation. The heavens, earth, and the Three Powers have passed through kalpas beyond reckoning. His emanations pervade worlds as numerous as motes of dust, beyond all calculation or measure.\n\nAfter the opening of heaven and earth, observing the degeneracy of the age, he established teachings in accordance with the times, serving as the imperial preceptor and instituting laws and ordinances. Sometimes he flowed through the Nine Heavens, sometimes he transmitted across the Four Seas. From the Three Sovereigns onward, successive emperors and kings all revered and upheld his teachings.\"\n\nThus it is known that within the Dao-qi of heaven above and heaven below, all is the transformation of the Venerable Lord. His countless teachings universally deliver and ferry across, yet the common people employ them daily without awareness.\n\nLaozi said: \"I was born before the formless, arose prior to the Great Beginning, moved within the origin of the Great Simplicity, stood at the verge of the Great Vastness, and roamed amidst the profound emptiness, entering and exiting the gate of the obscure and dark. Therefore, Ge Xuan’s preface to the *Dao De Jing* states: Laozi’s essence was naturally so, born before the Great Non-Being, arising without cause, traversing heaven and earth, his beginning and end beyond all reckoning. It further states: The world says Laozi descended in the Yin dynasty, yet Laozi’s title originated in kalpas beyond count—most obscure, dark, distant, and remote. Before the opening of heaven and earth, he repeatedly descended as the imperial preceptor, unbroken through the ages, though none could know this.\n\nAccording to the *Biographies of Laozi*, from before the opening of heaven and earth down to Tang of Yin, he served as the teacher of kings in every generation, manifesting transformed bodies to descend into the world. In the forty-seventh year of Tang of Yin, the gengshen year, he first revealed the traces of his birth. From the Everlasting Dao Realm of the Great Clarity, he rode the essence of the sun, transforming into a pellet of five-colored dark and yellow, large as a pellet, which the Jade Maiden swallowed in her tranquil daytime slumber. She conceived and carried him for eighty-one years, until the ninth year of Wuding of Yin, the gengchen year, when he emerged from the left armpit of the Jade Maiden. Born with a white complexion, he was named Laozi. Born beneath a plum tree, he pointed to it and said, 'This is my surname.' His given name was Er, and his courtesy name Boyang.\n\nFrom the ninth year of Wuding of Yin, the gengchen year, to the ninth year of King Zhao of Qin, when he ascended westward to Kunlun, spans nine hundred and ninety-six years. According to Li Shi’s *Continuation of the Treatise on Broad Learning*: In the third year of Wude of Emperor Gaozu of Tang, a man from Jinzhou named Ji Shanxing saw a white-robed elder on Yangjiao Mountain, who called to him, saying, 'Tell the Son of Heaven of Tang that I am Lord Lao, your ancestor.' Gaozu thereupon established a temple. Emperor Gaozong later honored him as the Mysterious Origin Emperor, and Emperor Xuanzong annotated the *True Scripture of Dao and Virtue*. Today, scholars have summarized that in the two capitals and various prefectures, temples to the Mysterious Origin Emperor were established—the capital’s called the Mysterious Origin Palace, and the prefectures’ called the Purple Ultimate Palaces. Later, the Western Capital’s was renamed the Great Clarity Palace, and the Eastern Capital’s the Great Tenuity Palace, each with students in attendance. His honorific title was: Great Sage Ancestor, Supreme Highest Dao, Golden Watchtower, Mysterious Origin, Heavenly August Emperor.\n\nThe *Institutional Compilation of the Song Dynasty* records: In the sixth year of Taiping Xingguo of Emperor Zhenzong of Song, on the eleventh day of the eighth month, an edict was issued to reverently bestow the honorific title: Supreme Lord Lao, Primordial Origin, Emperor of Supreme Virtue. As for the honorific title of the Sacred Mother: In the third year of Guangze of Empress Wu of Tang, on the jiayin day of the ninth month, the Sacred Mother was posthumously honored as the Primordial Heaven Empress. The ancestral hall is in the Great Clarity Palace of Bozhou.\n\nOn the ninth day of the first month, the Jade August Thearch was born, his sacred name being Radiant and Wondrous Medicine, and his royal name Contending Virtue. At that time, the king had a queen named Treasure Moonlight. The king, having no heir, often pondered: 'Now that I am growing old without a crown prince, if my body should perish, to whom shall I entrust the altars of soil and grain and the nine ancestral temples?' Having thought thus, he immediately issued an edict to all the assemblies, ordering them to adorn the palace halls according to the various scriptural teachings, hang banners and canopies, and meticulously prepare offerings. For six periods of the day, they performed the Daoist rites and prayed to the true sages, persisting for half a year without wavering in their devotion.\n\nOne night, Queen Treasure Moonlight dreamed that the Supreme Lord Dao and the assembly of perfected beings, with golden forms and jade-like qualities, their purity contending with the brightest, rode a five-colored dragon chariot, surrounded by banners of boundless light and canopies of luminous clouds. At that time, the Supreme Lord Dao sat serenely in the dragon chariot, holding an infant. From every pore of his body emanated a hundred million rays of light, illuminating the palace halls with the hues of a hundred treasures. Preceded by banners and standards, they floated through the air and arrived. The queen’s heart filled with joy, and she reverently received them, kneeling before the Dao and addressing the Lord: 'The king has no heir. I beseech you to grant this child as the lord of the altars of soil and grain. I humbly pray for your compassion and mercy to hear and permit this.' Then the Lord Dao replied to the queen, saying, 'I specially bestow him upon you.'\n\nThe queen bowed in gratitude to the Lord Dao and received the child. Upon receiving him, she awoke from her dream and conceived. After carrying the child for a year, on the ninth day of the first month of the bingwu year, at the hour of noon, he was born in the royal palace. At the moment of his birth, his sacred radiance filled the kingdom, his form and appearance wondrous and fine, delighting all who beheld him. As a child, he was keen and wise; as he grew, he was kind and virtuous. Throughout his kingdom, he distributed all the treasures from the royal storehouses, aiding the destitute, the suffering, the widowed, the orphaned, and the solitary, those without support, the starving, the sick, and the disabled. All beings, bereft of love and harmony, sang his praises, and his transformation extended to distant lands. The world looked up to him and turned toward benevolence, and the crown prince’s father, the king, rejoiced.\n\nThereafter, the king suddenly passed away, and the crown prince, governing with humility, announced to his ministers: 'I, inheriting the throne by the Dao, now relinquish my kingdom.' He retired to the Bright and Luminous Rock Mountain to cultivate the Dao. Upon achieving perfection, he transcended this kalpa, having passed through eight hundred kalpas. He often relinquished his kingdom to be reborn as a commoner, thus severing his attachments to study the Dao. Later, for eight hundred kalpas, he practiced medicine to cure illnesses and rescue beings, bringing them peace and joy. When this kalpa ended, he passed through another eight hundred kalpas, broadly performing expedient means, revealing the treasuries of the Dao, expounding sacred scriptures, proclaiming the true transformation, disseminating divine works, aiding the state and saving the people, from the hidden to the manifest. After this, for another eight hundred kalpas, he relinquished his body and life, practicing forbearance and offering his own flesh and blood.\n\nThrough such cultivation for three thousand two hundred kalpas, he finally attained the Golden Immortal, known as the Tathāgata of Pure and Natural Awakening. The *Veritable Records of Emperor Zhenzong of Song* states: In the seventh year of Dazhong Xiangfu, in the ninth month, the emperor addressed his attending ministers, saying: 'Since the descent of the auspicious signs, I have wished for all the officials and common people of the realm to jointly bestow an honorific title upon the August King.'\"\n\nIn the first month of the first year of Tianxi, on the day of *xinchou* marking the new moon, the Emperor proceeded to the Great Initial Hall to reverently bestow the honorific title upon the Jade August Great Heavenly Emperor: \"Supreme Venerable of Primordial Opening, Holder of the Talisman, Governor of the Calendar, Embracer of Truth, Embodying the Dao, Jade August Great Heavenly Emperor.\"\n\nRespectfully inscribing the honorific title of the Sacred Ancestor, the *Record of Divine Encounters* composed by imperial decree states: In the early Jingde era, Wang Zhongzheng encountered the True Lord of the Controller of Destinies, who transmitted the Golden Elixir Method. In the fourth year, during the eleventh month, it descended upon the true abode of Liu Chenggui. In the fifth year, the honorific title \"Celestial Worthy of the Controller of Destinies of the Nine Heavens\" was reverently bestowed.\n\nThe *Veritable Records of Emperor Zhenzong of Song* states: On the seventeenth day of the tenth month in the fifth year of Dazhong Xiangfu, the Emperor recalled that in the fourth year of Jingde, a divine person had descended to transmit the Jade Emperor’s decree, saying, \"This month, on the twenty-fourth day, your ancestor Zhao shall descend, as in the Geng Zhenyuan affair.\" On that day, the Celestial Worthy descended upon the Hall of Extended Grace. In the intercalary tenth month, on the day of *jisi*, the honorific title was augmented: \"Supreme Sacred Ancestor, Lofty Dao of the Upper Numinous, Celestial Worthy of the Nine Heavens Who Pardons and Protects Life.\"\n\n**Honorific Title of the Sacred Mother**\nThe *Collected Statutes of the Reigning Dynasty* states: On the sixth day of the third month in the first year of Tianxi, the honorific title \"August Heavenly Great Sage Empress\" was conferred upon the Sacred Mother. Previously, in the fifth year of Dazhong Xiangfu, an edict had been issued to augment the honorific title of the Sacred Ancestress, awaiting the completion of the Supreme Ultimate Abbey in Chanzhou before selecting an auspicious day for the investiture. On this occasion, Wang Dan and others performed the conferral rites.\n\n**The August Earthly Deity, Queen of the Soil**\nOn the eighteenth day of the third month, the sacred birth of the Earthly Deity occurred. Before Heaven and Earth divided, all was a chaotic unity. When the Two Modes separated and the Yin and Yang settled into their positions, the pure *qi* ascended to form the Yang Heaven, while the turbid *qi* descended to form the Yin Earth. The Yang Heaven was transmitted through the Five Supremes, with the Five Lords establishing their positions, above which the sun and moon were set, and the celestial patterns arrayed. The Yin Earth was borne through the Five Phases in mutual generation, with the Five *qi* congealing and coalescing to uphold the rivers and seas, mountains and forests, and all dwellings. Thus, Heaven is Yang and Earth is Yin; Heaven is the Father and Earth the Mother.\n\nThe world calls her the Queen of the Soil, for she is the Yellow Earth from the primordial division of Heaven and Earth, hence termed the Mother of Soil. The principal temple is located in Fenyin. During the Dazhong Xiangfu era of Emperor Zhenzong of Song, on the twenty-third day of the seventh month of that year, an edict was issued to enfeoff the August Earthly Deity, Queen of the Soil. That year, the imperial carriage proceeded to Huayin for the personal sacrifice. Today, the Temple of the Queen of the Soil in the Fanli Abbey of Yangzhou stands, before whose hall grows a single jade flower tree, its fragrance, color, branches, and leaves surpassing all ordinary species.\n\n**The Eastern August Emperor**\nThe Eastern August Emperor was profoundly versed in the *qi* of the Dao, his quiescent and tranquil essence embodying non-action. Aspiring to guide and perfect the mysterious workings that generate and transform the myriad things, he first transformed the Eastern August Perfect *qi* to give birth to Wood Lord. Upon the Azure Sea, in the Wilderness of Verdant Numinosity, Wood Lord presided over the harmonious Yang *qi* and governed the East, also styled as Lord Wang.\n\nBoth he and the Metal Mother emerged from the primordial essence of the Great Origin, their divine and profound natures taking form within the confluence of the Eastern Ford, where the pure and refined *qi* of the Great Dao coalesced. Together with the Queen Mother, they governed the Two *qi* and nurtured Heaven and Earth, shaping and fostering the myriad things. All men under Heaven, across the Three Realms and the Ten Directions, who ascend as immortals and attain the Dao, fall under his jurisdiction. Dwelling above Fangzhu, according to the *Record Beyond the Dust*, Fangzhu Mountain lies within the Eastern Sea. Its thirty-five bureaus of destiny administer the karmic rewards and retributions of the celestial and human realms. The August Emperor, as the Great Controller of Destinies, oversees them all. The mountain bears the Eastern August Terrace, where the Emperor customarily ascends on *dingmao* days to survey the four directions.\n\nAmong those who cultivate the Dao, immortals are ranked in nine grades: first, the True Kings of the Nine Heavens; second, the True Sovereigns of the Three Heavens; third, the Supreme Perfected; fourth, the Flying Celestial Perfected; fifth, the Numinous Immortals; sixth, the Perfected; seventh, the Numinous Beings; eighth, the Flying Immortals; and ninth, the Immortals. When ascending to Heaven in these ranks, they first pay homage to Wood Lord, then present themselves to the Metal Mother. Only after completing these rites may they ascend to the Nine Heavens, enter the Three Clarities, bow before the Supreme Venerable, and behold the Primordial Commencement.\n\nThus, in the early Han dynasty, four or five children were playing by the roadside. One child recited a poem: \"Donning a blue skirt, ascending to Heaven’s gate, bowing to the Metal Mother, saluting Wood Lord.\" None understood its meaning, save Zhang Liang, who bowed in reverence, saying, \"These are the jade lads of the Eastern August Lord.\"\n\nFormerly, the Primordial Commencement addressed the celestial beings of the Ten Directions, saying: \"Since I first spoke of the chaotic generation, the Two Modes have been set in motion, and the Yin and Yang have been sealed in their beginnings. The August Supreme Primordial Lord and the Eastern August Fusang Great Emperor, among others, measured the balance of water and fire and determined the kalpas.\" In the first year of Zhonghuang, the Supreme Venerable, within the Jade Clarity’s resplendent chamber and the Golden Portal’s upper palace, bestowed upon the Emperor the Precious Scripture, the Floral Chart, and the Jade Instructions, commanding him to transmit them to later learners, those whose names harmonize with truth. Thus, the *Mysterious Canon* states: \"The Eastern August does not conceal the true instructions.\"\n\n**The Purple Palace**\nThe Purple Palace is where the August Emperor evaluates the merits and conduct of immortals. Within the seas lie three islands, around which the Ten Continents are arrayed. The upper islands and three continents are Penglai, Fangzhang, and Yingzhou; the middle islands and three continents are Furong, Banyuan, and Yaochi; the lower islands and three continents are Chicheng, Xuanguan, and Taoyuan. Amidst the three islands and nine continents, standing like tripods in unity, lies the continent called the Purple Palace, situated among the three islands. It is the alternate domain of the August Emperor, where he transfers and promotes the offices of the numinous officials, assessing the merits and conduct of the host of immortals. From earthly immortals to divine immortals, from divine immortals to celestial immortals, and from celestial immortals to true sages who enter the Void and Penetrating Heavens—three promotions in all—are all governed by the August Emperor.\n\nAs for his names: \"Eastern August\" derives from the August Emperor being born of the Eastern August Perfect *qi*, ruling the Eastern Extremity and dwelling above the Eastern August. \"Purple Palace\" refers to his office in the Purple Palace, where he oversees the thirty-five bureaus of destiny and promotes the ranks of true immortals. As Yang, he presides over the East, where the nine *qi* of Lesser Yang generate and transform the myriad things. \"August Emperor\" denotes his station in the East, the honored sovereign of all heavens, the lord who shepherds the multitude of sages and the king who engenders all beings.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"The Lord emerges from the *Zhen* trigram\"—this is the meaning. Thus, he is called the Eastern August Purple Palace Lesser Yang Emperor Lord.\n\nThe *True Teachings of the Primordial Talisman Scripture* further states: In the time before the Two Modes had divided, when the primordial chaos was vast and boundless like an egg’s yolk suspended in the dark and yellow, there naturally arose the True Person Pan Gu. Moving from antiquity to the present, he is called Pan Gu, the essence of Heaven and Earth. He styled himself the Primordial Celestial King and roamed the Void. There was also the Supreme Primordial Mother, who transformed and was born within the celestial spine. After one kalpa, the Celestial King performed the rites, and the Mother gave birth to the Heavenly Sovereign, who was titled the Supreme August of the First Era. He ruled for sixteen thousand years and received the talismanic mandate of the Primordial Celestial Venerable to become the Eastern Palace Great Emperor and Fusang Great Lord. The Eastern August Lord is also called the Primordial Yang Father. According to the immortals’ scriptures, he is sometimes called the Eastern King Lord, sometimes the Azure Lad, sometimes the Square Cauldron Lord, and sometimes the Azure Stem Lord. Though his names differ, he is the same Eastern August.\n\nIn the sixth year of the Zhiyuan era of the Sagely Dynasty, on the first day of the first month, he was bestowed the honorific title: Eastern August Purple Palace Lesser Yang Emperor Lord.\n\nThe Queen Mother of the West was born on the eighteenth day of the seventh month. The Queen Mother of the West is the Ninefold Numinous Great Wondrous Tortoise Mountain Metal Mother, also known as the Supreme Void Ninefold Radiance Tortoise Terrace Metal Mother. I am the utmost wondrous of the Western August, the supreme honored of the Profound Yin. In ancient times, when the Dao’s *qi* congealed in stillness and her formless essence dwelled in nonaction, she desired to assist the mysterious work of engendering and transforming the myriad things. First, she generated the Wood Lord from the Eastern August’s perfect *qi*. The Wood Lord was born above the Azure Sea in the Wilderness of Verdant Numinosity, presiding over the harmonious Yang *qi* and governing the East. He is also called the Eastern King Lord. Then, from the Western August’s utmost wondrous *qi*, she generated the Metal Mother. The Metal Mother was divinely born in Yi River, her surname being Zong. At birth, she soared in flight, presiding over the profound mysteries of primordial nurturance within the vast and boundless. She coalesced the pure essence of the Great Dao, forming her shape, and together with the Eastern King Lord, they governed the Two Modes, nurturing Heaven and Earth and shaping the myriad things. As the root of gentleness and compliance, she is the primordial Yin, her position corresponding to the West. She mothers and nourishes all beings. All women in the Three Realms and Ten Directions who ascend as immortals or attain the Dao are under her jurisdiction. Her abode is the Garden of Kunlun, the Park of Gentle Winds, the Ninefold Jade Radiance Profound Terrace, with the Jasper Pool to its left and the Emerald Waters encircling its right. Her five daughters are Hua Lin, Juan Lan, Qing E, Yao Ji, and Yu Zhi.\n\nIn the thirty-fifth year of King Mu of Zhou, he commanded his eight steeds to journey west on a royal progress. Arriving at Kunlun, he paid homage and offered sacrifices, presenting white jade and layered brocade to honor the Queen Mother. At that time, the Queen Mother feasted King Mu at the Jasper Pool with treasures, purple palace nectar, and the elixirs of the Nine Heavens. On the seventh day of the seventh month, she descended to the palace of Emperor Wu of Han. The Queen Mother presented seven flat peaches, having already eaten two herself. The Emperor wished to keep the remaining ones, but the Mother said: \"These peaches do not exist in the mortal world; they bear fruit once every three thousand years.\" Suddenly, Dongfang Shuo peeked through the window. The Mother pointed at him and said: \"This child has already stolen my peaches three times.\" On that day, she commanded her attendant Dong Shuangcheng to play the cloud-harmonizing flute, Wang Zideng to strum the jade zither, Xu Feiqiong to strike the numinous zither, and An Faxing to sing the mysterious hymn, offering blessings to Emperor Wu.\n\nThe Eastern King Lord is said to play pitch-pot with the Jade Maiden. When the arrow misses and fails to be caught, Heaven laughs, opening its mouth—this is the flowing light now seen as lightning.\n\nThe Supreme August of the First Rank of the Upper Prime\nThe Supreme August of the First Rank of the Nine *Qi* Celestial Palace, the Purple Tenuity Great Emperor, is formed from the *qi* of the life-extending talisman and the beginning Yang. Dwelling in the Primordial Yang’s Seven Treasures Purple Tenuity Upper Palace of the Dark Capital, he oversees all the Celestial Emperors, August Lords, Supreme Sages, and High Perfected Ones, as well as the myriad star lords of the constellations. Every year, on the fifteenth day of the first month—the Upper Prime Moon Day—the Celestial Officials review the registers throughout the great thousandfold world, within the ten directions and all lands. They examine the records of all great immortals and transcendent beings who ascend and descend, the stellar influences over the lands and their corresponding regions, the lifespans of human beings, and the cycles of transformation for fish, dragons, flying creatures, crawling beings, and all that moves and lives. On the day the Celestial Officials gather with the sages, they record and memorialize, distinguishing each according to their deeds: some are reshaped by their karma, some receive rewards by their blessings, some are transferred through kalpas, some live and die by their actions, and all follow the consequences of good and evil without exception.\n\nThe August Emperor of the Second Rank of the Middle Prime\nThe August Emperor of the Second Rank of the Seven *Qi* Earth Palace, the Clear Void Great Emperor, dwells in the Boundless World’s Cavernous Void Clear Palace. He oversees the Lords of the Five Peaks, the Emperors of the Twenty-Four Sacred Mountains, the Earth Sovereigns of the Nine Lands, and the deities of the Four Directions and Eight Extremities. Every year, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month—the Middle Prime Moon Day—the Earth Officials review the registers throughout the great thousandfold world, within the ten directions and all lands. They examine the records of all great immortals and transcendent beings who ascend and descend, the stellar influences over the lands and their corresponding regions, the lifespans of human beings, and the cycles of transformation for fish, dragons, flying creatures, crawling beings, and all that moves and lives. On the day the Earth Officials gather with the sages, they record and memorialize, distinguishing each according to their deeds: some are reshaped by their karma, some receive rewards by their blessings, some are transferred through kalpas, some live and die by their actions, and all follow the consequences of good and evil without exception.\n\nThe August Emperor of the Third Rank of the Lower Prime\nThe August Emperor of the Third Rank of the Five *Qi* Water Palace, the Cavernous Yin Great Emperor, is the essence of the Cavernous Primordial Wind Marsh and the purity of dawn’s radiance. Dwelling in the Golden Numinous Eternal Joy Palace, he oversees the Lords of the Nine Rivers, the deities of the Four Marshes, the Perfected Ones of the Twelve Streams, and the Lords of the Three Rivers and Four Seas. Every year, on the fifteenth day of the tenth month—the Lower Prime Moon Day—the Water Officials review the registers throughout the great thousandfold world, within the ten directions and all lands. They examine the records of all great immortals and transcendent beings who ascend and descend, the stellar influences over the lands and their corresponding regions, the lifespans of human beings, and the cycles of transformation for fish, dragons, flying creatures, crawling beings, and all that moves and lives. On the day the Water Officials gather with the sages, they record and memorialize, distinguishing each according to their deeds: some are reshaped by their karma, some receive rewards by their blessings, some are transferred through kalpas, some live and die by their actions, and all follow the consequences of good and evil without exception. Let this be fully known.\n\nThe Eastern Marchmount is born on the twenty-eighth day of the third month. Mount Tai is the ancestor of all mountains, the patriarch of the Five Marchmounts, the spirit of Heaven and Earth, and the abode of divine numina. It is located in Fengfu County of Yanzhou, now known as Tai’an Prefecture, with Liangfu Mountain as its deputy.\n\nAccording to *The Classic of Divine Marvels* by Dongfang Shuo: In ancient times, among the descendants of Pangu, the fifth generation was He Tian Shi, followed by Xu Bo Shi, then Xuan Ying Shi. Xuan Ying Shi’s son was King Jin Shu, whose younger brother was Shao Hai Shi. Shao Hai Shi’s wife was the Immortal Lady Mi Lun. One night, the Immortal Lady Mi Lun dreamed of swallowing two suns and awoke pregnant, giving birth to two sons. The elder was named Jin Chan Shi, and the younger was Jin Hong Shi. Jin Hong Shi became the Lord of the Eastern Marchmount, while Jin Chan Shi became the Lord of the Eastern Florescence.\n\nJin Hong Shi rendered meritorious service on Changbai Mountain. During the reign of Fuxi, he was enfeoffed as Gu Sui, the True Person of Mount Taihua, and entrusted with the registers of the six celestial immortals. Thus, he took Sui as his surname, with the personal name Chong. Gu Sui was the capital of the Supreme Heavenly Worthy before the Five Marchmounts, now known as Fenghao. His mother was the daughter of the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Water.\n\nDuring the reign of Shennong, he was granted the celestial tally as the Prefect of the Capital and titled Lord. In the Han dynasty, Emperor Ming enfeoffed him as Marshal of Mount Tai, overseeing the distinctions of nobility and humility among the world’s inhabitants, the duration of their official salaries, the registers of the eighteen hells and six bureaus, and the life-and-death cycles of the seventy-five departments.\n\nSince the eras of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Wei dynasties, the Divine Lord has been known only as the Prefect of Tiandu. According to *The Tang Compendium*: In the second year of Chuigong during Empress Wu’s reign, on the first day of the seventh month, the Eastern Marchmount was enfeoffed as the Divine Marchmount King of the Central Heaven. In the first year of Wansui Tongtian, on the first day of the fourth month, he was honored as the Heavenly Equal Lord. In the thirteenth year of Kaiyuan during Emperor Xuanzong’s reign, he was further enfeoffed as the Heavenly Equal King. In the first year of Dazhong Xiangfu during Emperor Zhenzong’s reign, on the fifteenth day of the tenth month, an edict enfeoffed him as the Heavenly Equal Benevolent and Sagely King. By the fourth year of Xiangfu, on a day in the fifth month, he was elevated to the imperial title: Heavenly Equal Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of the Eastern Marchmount. The Virtuous and Illustrious Empress was later honored with the addition of \"Great Life\" to her title, while the rest of her enfeoffment remained unchanged.\n\nThe Emperor has five sons: the Proclaiming Numen Marquis, the Kindly Numen Marquis, the Harmonious Kindness Lady, the Illustrious Numen King of Utmost Sagacity, and the Eternal Peace Lady. They reside as the Revered Master of Benevolence and Exhaustive Insight, the Assisting Numen Marquis, and the Virtuous Kindness Lady. The Emperor has one daughter, the Great Immortal Jade Maiden, known as the Jade Maiden Lady of the Taiping Peak of Mount Tai.\n\nThe Southern Marchmount: Mount Heng of the Southern Marchmount is located in Hengshan County of Hengzhou, with Mount Huo as its deputy. *The Classic of Divine Marvels* by Dongfang Shuo states that the deity’s surname is Chong, with the personal name Tan. The Southern Marchmount governs the stellar correspondences of the world and oversees the affairs of scaled creatures, aquatic beings, dragons, and fish.\n\nIn the fourth year of Dazhong Xiangfu, on the twenty-fifth day of the fifth month, he was posthumously honored with the imperial title: Illuminating Sagely Emperor of Celestial Governance, with the Radiant and Illustrious Empress. The sagely dynasty later added the characters \"Great Transformation\" to his title, while the rest of his enfeoffment remained unchanged.\n\nThe Western Marchmount: Mount Hua of the Western Marchmount is located in Huayin County of Huazhou, with Mount Taibai as its deputy. *The Classic of Divine Marvels* by Dongfang Shuo states that the deity’s surname is Shan, with the personal name Li. The Western Marchmount governs the world’s gold, silver, copper, iron, and other metals, as well as foundries, smelting, and the affairs of feathered birds.\n\nIn the fourth year of Dazhong Xiangfu, on a day in the fifth month, he was posthumously honored with the imperial title: Compliant and Sagely Emperor of the Golden Heaven, with the Solemn and Illustrious Empress. The sagely dynasty later added the characters \"Great Profit\" to his title, while the rest of his enfeoffment remained unchanged.\n\nThe Northern Marchmount: Mount Heng of the Northern Marchmount is located in Quyang County of Dingzhou, with Mount Luodong as its deputy. *The Classic of Divine Marvels* by Dongfang Shuo states that the deity’s surname is Chen, with the personal name E. The Northern Marchmount governs the world’s rivers—Jiang, Huai, and Ji—and oversees tigers, leopards, and other beasts, as well as snakes, vipers, and insects.\n\nIn the fourth year of Dazhong Xiangfu, on a day in the fifth month, he was posthumously honored with the imperial title: Mysterious and Sagely Emperor of Peaceful Heaven, with the Serene and Illustrious Empress. The sagely dynasty later added the characters \"Great Integrity\" to his title, while the rest of his enfeoffment remained unchanged.\n\nThe Central Marchmount: Mount Song of the Central Marchmount is located in Dengfeng County of the Western Capital’s Henan Prefecture, with Mount Shaoshi as its deputy. *The Classic of Divine Marvels* by Dongfang Shuo states that the deity’s surname is Dan, with the personal name Shan. The Central Marchmount governs the world’s marshes, valleys, ravines, ditches, mountains, forests, and trees.\n\nIn the fourth year of Dazhong Xiangfu, on a day in the fifth month, he was posthumously honored with the imperial title: Revered and Sagely Emperor of the Central Heaven, with the Upright and Illustrious Empress. The sagely dynasty later added the characters \"Great Peace\" to his title, while the rest of his enfeoffment remained unchanged.\n\nThe Gods of the Four Waterways: The God of the Jiang Waterway is Qu Yuan, the Grand Master of Chu. The Tang dynasty initially enfeoffed him as a two-character duke, and the Song dynasty added two more characters to his title. The present dynasty further enfeoffed him as a four-character king, titled the King of Vast Source and Compliant Salvation.\n\nThe God of the He Waterway is Chen Ping of the Han dynasty. The Tang dynasty initially enfeoffed him as a two-character duke, and the Song dynasty added two more characters to his title. The present dynasty further enfeoffed him as a four-character king, titled the King of Numinous Source and Vast Salvation.\n\nThe God of the Huai Waterway is Pei Du of the Tang dynasty. The Tang dynasty initially enfeoffed him as a two-character duke, and the Song dynasty added two more characters to his title.

The Tang dynasty initially enfeoffed him as a one-character duke, and the Song dynasty added three more characters to his title. The present dynasty further enfeoffed him as a four-character king, titled the King of Pure Source and Han Salvation.\n\nThe Gods of the Five Directions: When King Wu of Zhou conquered Zhou and established his capital in Luoyi, Heaven sent a great snowstorm. On the first day of the jiazi month, the five divine chariots and cavalry halted outside the king’s gate, seeking an audience. The king asked, “Do the gods each have names?” Marshal Jiang Shang replied, “The God of the Southern Sea is named Zhu Rong, the God of the Northern Sea is named Xuan Ming, the God of the Eastern Sea is named Gou Mang, the God of the Western Sea is named Ru Shou, and the God of the Rivers and Lakes is named Feng Xiu.”\n\nThe herald was sent to summon them by name, and the gods all came forth in solemn attendance to meet King Wu. The king asked, “What instructions do you bring?” The gods replied, “Heaven has overthrown Yin and established Zhou. We come in reverence to receive our mandates, each to fulfill our appointed tasks.” King Wu said, “You shall not neglect the seasonal rites in your honor.”\n\nAccording to tradition, Gonggong’s son, Ri Long, presides over the earth as the God of the Soil (Houtu). Shaohao’s son, Ri Zhong, presides over wood as the God Gou Mang. Zhuanxu’s son, Li Xi, presides over fire as the God Zhu Rong. Shaohao’s second son, Gai, presides over metal as the God Ru Shou. Shaohao’s third son, Xi Wang, presides over water as the God Xuan Ming.\n\nTaiyi is a celestial deity. According to the *Book of Han*, when Liu Xiang was collating texts in the Tianlu Pavilion, an old man in yellow robes, holding a staff tipped with blue blossoms, appeared before him. As Liu Xiang sat in darkness, the staff’s light illuminated his reading. When asked his name, the old man replied, “I am the essence of Taiyi.”\n\nJianwu: According to the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*, Kunlun’s peak is the divine capital where the emperor descends. The god Lu Wu governs it—a being with a human face, tiger’s body, tiger’s claws, and nine tails, overseeing the nine celestial divisions and the emperor’s seasonal gardens. This is the same Jianwu whom Zhuangzi speaks of as dwelling on Mount Tai.\n\nZhuyin: The god of Zhong Mountain beyond the seas is named Zhuyin, also called the Torch Dragon. His eyes open to create daylight and close to bring night. He exhales to summon winter’s breath and inhales to cease in summer. He neither eats nor drinks nor rests, and his breath becomes wind. His body stretches a thousand *li*, with a human face, serpent’s form, one red foot, and he dwells in the land of Wuxi.\n\nThe Thunder God was born on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month. His temple lies eight *li* southwest of Leizhou. In former times, villagers crafted thunder drums and thunder chariots, placing them in the temple. Once, a man ate fish and meat together, and instantly a thunderbolt struck him. Ancient records state: During the Tianjian era of the Chen dynasty, a man of the Chen clan, while hunting, found an egg over a *chi* in circumference and took it home. One day, it split open with a thunderclap, revealing a child with markings on his hand reading *Leizhou*. Raised to adulthood, he was named Wen Yu, and the locals called him the “Seed of Thunder.” Later, he became prefect of the region. After his death, he displayed divine power, and the villagers built a temple in his honor. Before storms, lightning and roars would issue from the temple. The Song and Yuan dynasties repeatedly enfeoffed him as a king, and his temple was named Xianzhen. During the Deyou era, it was renamed Weihua.\n\nThe *Guoshi Bu* notes: In Leizhou, thunder is frequent in spring and summer, but in autumn, it burrows into the earth, taking the form of a curled creature, which people dig up and eat. On Mount Wawu in Yazhou, there is a Thunder Grotto—when tiles or stones are thrown in, they trigger lightning in response.\n\nThe Lightning God: Legend holds that the Eastern King and the Jade Maiden were playing a game of pitch-pot. When a shot missed, Heaven laughed, its open mouth streaming light—what we now call lightning.\n\nThe Wind Earl is Feilian. Ying Shao states: Feilian is a divine bird that commands the winds. Its body resembles a deer, its head a sparrow, with horns and a serpent’s tail, and it is as large as a leopard.\n\nThe Rain Master is Shangyang.\n\nThe Divine Bird Shangyang is small in form, yet when it inhales, the vast seas of Qi and Bo may be drained dry.\n\n---\n\n**Hunt for the Supernatural, Scroll One** (End)\n\n**Hunt for the Supernatural, Scroll Two**\n*Catalogue*\nThe Dark Celestial Thearch  Left Judging Official of the Northern Culmen Exorcism Court\nThe Lord Emperor of Zitong  Three Perfected Lords of Wu  Perfected Lord Xu\nHeavenly Master Zhang  Three Mao Perfected Lords\nThe Great Emperor of Mount Ci  Five Saints  Illustrious Numinous King of Supreme Sanctity\nThe Protector Perfected Lord  Wang Shichen  Yuan Qianli\nZhang Guolao  Perfected of the Western Marchmount  Perfected of Great Simplicity\nPerfected Sa  Perfected of Shouchun  The Gentleman Who Carries the Kiln on His Back\nDivine Master of Pitch and Timbre, Liu Shi\n\nThe Dark Celestial Thearch was born on the third day of the third month. According to the *Red Writ of the Chaotic Abyss*, the Dark Thearch is an emanation of the Primordial Beginning, a distinct embodiment of the Supreme Ultimate. During the era of the Upper Three Sovereigns, he descended as the Perfected of Great Inception; in the Middle Three Sovereigns, as the Perfected of Great Simplicity; and in the Lower Three Sovereigns, as the Perfected of Great Simplicity. By the time of the Yellow Emperor, he descended as the Sovereign of the Supreme Heaven. At the dawn of the Kaihuang kalpa, he descended into the world. In the first year of Ziyun, the jiawu year, on the jiayin day of the third month, at the gengwu hour, he aligned with the essence of the Great Yang and entered the womb of Lady Shansheng of the King of Shengle, gestating for fourteen months—this was the eighty-second transformation of the Supreme.\n\nShengle was a kingdom beneath the lunar lodges Kui and Lou, beyond the eastern sea, corresponding to the Dragon-Transformation Brahma-Heaven. When the Dark Thearch was born from his mother’s left cheek, at the moment of his birth, auspicious clouds enveloped the kingdom, rare fragrances filled the air, and the earth transformed into gold and jade, manifesting wondrous omens. Born with divine numinosity, his every movement was mysterious and elusive. By the age of ten, he had mastered all classics at a glance, comprehending them in silence. Gazing above and below, there was nothing he did not penetrate. He concealed his heart in the Dao, his aspirations aligned with the Great Void, and he vowed to assist the Thearch in bestowing universal blessings upon the people. His father could not restrain his resolve. At fifteen, he bid farewell to his parents to seek secluded valleys and refine his primordial authenticity. Thereupon, the Purple Void Primordial Sovereign of the Jade Purity Saintly Ancestress was moved and transmitted to him the Supreme Dao of the Limitless.\n\nThe Primordial Sovereign addressed the Dark Thearch, saying: “You should cross the eastern sea and journey beneath the wings of the Han. There is a mountain whose traces rise from Qian and Dui, coiling for fifty thousand li. Its waters flow from the Zhen Palace. This mountain arises naturally with the Supreme Ultimate, corresponding to the Wind Heaven of the Firmly Established Culmen and the Great Peace August Cliff of the Second Heaven. You should enter this mountain and dwell among its peaks, choosing the central and loftiest one, the Purple Empyrean. When the era of Supreme Harmony and ascension arrives, five hundred years later, during the two kalpas of Dragon Han, you shall bind your hair, tread barefoot, and gather the true essences of Li and Kan to return to the root and restore your position. Above, you will become a minister of the Three Realms; below, a great sage of the Ten Directions. Only then will your name be manifest for countless kalpas, equal to heaven and earth, sun and moon—this will be the fulfillment of your fruit.”\n\nHaving spoken, the Primordial Sovereign ascended upon the clouds and departed. The Dark Thearch followed his master’s instructions, crossing the Eastern Sea and journeying until he stood beneath the wings of the Han. There, he indeed saw the mountain his master had described, its waters and terrain all matching his words. He entered to survey it and found seventy-two peaks, among which one soared emerald-green, piercing the Purple Empyrean. Below it lay a ravine facing the sun, serene and empty. Thus, the Dark Thearch, honoring his master’s sincerity, named the mountain Great Harmony, the peak Purple Empyrean Peak, and the ravine Purple Empyrean Ravine. He then divined his dwelling there, concealing himself in the mysterious unity of the Void and silently communing with the myriad Perfected.\n\nAfter forty-nine years, he profoundly attained the Supreme Dao. In the fifty-seventh year, on the ninth day of the ninth month of the jiazi year, at dawn on the bingyin day, suddenly auspicious clouds and celestial blossoms descended from the sky, filling the valleys. For three hundred li in every direction, the forests and peaks resounded with the spontaneous music of the immortals’ *bu xu* hymns. At that moment, the Dark Thearch stood nine feet tall, his face like the full moon, brows like dragons, eyes like phoenixes, his hair bound in a topknot, his beard fine. His countenance was as clear as ice, his head crowned with a nine-qi jade coronet, his body clad in pine-fiber robes. Barefoot and with hands clasped, he stood upon Purple Empyrean Peak.\n\nIn an instant, the clouds dispersed, and five Perfected Ones and a host of immortals descended before the Dark Thearch, their retinue magnificent beyond mortal perception. The Dark Thearch bowed deeply, reverently receiving them. The Five Perfected said: “We bear the decree of the Three Clarities and the Jade Emperor. Your merit is complete, your Dao perfected, and you are to ascend. We have heard that your sagely father and sagely mother now reside in the Nine Empyreans.” The Dark Thearch knelt and prostrated himself, receiving the edict with reverence. The Five Perfected then proclaimed the decree, appointing him as the Supreme Marshal of the Great Mystery and Unity, charged with overseeing the affairs of the Yuanhe Migration Bureau. They bestowed upon him the Nine-Virtue Crescent Moon Golden Dawn Jade Coronet, the Jade Hairpin of Qionghua, the Jasper Jade Scepter, the Cloud-Soaring Silver Robe of Golden Radiance, the Purple Cloud Dragon Robe with Cinnabar Skirt and Feathered Adornments, the Seven-Treasure Silk Garment, the Vermilion Shoes of Primordial Light, the Flying Red Cloud Crow, the Jade Tablet of the Supreme Marshal of the Great Mystery, the Qian-Yuan Treasure Seal, the Northern and Southern Dippers, the Three Terraces Dragon Sword, the Jade Rein of Flying Clouds, the Cinnabar Chariot of Green Ascension, the Nine-Colored Jade Wheel of Feathered Beneficence, the Ten Unfailing Numinous Provisions, nine phoenixes leading the way, eight simurghs following, and a hundred million jade maidens and celestial steeds. He was to ascend to the Nine Clarities and carry out the decree.”\n\nThe Dark Thearch bowed twice, received the decree, changed his attire, and ascended to the Golden Portal. According to the *Jade Calendar of the Primordial Abyss*, during the reign of King Zhou of Yin, his daily transgressions and malevolence grew ever more rampant, provoking the descent of six great demon kings who led hordes of ghosts to harm living beings. The Primordial Beginning then commanded the Jade Emperor to issue a decree to the Purple Tenuity: in the yang realm, King Wu of Zhou would overthrow Zhou; in the yin realm, the Dark Thearch would subdue the demons.\n\nAt that time, the Supreme One bestowed upon the Dark Thearch flowing hair, bare feet, golden armor, a black robe, and a dark banner. Leading the hosts of celestial soldiers, he descended to the mortal realm. There, he battled the six demon kings of the Six Heavens in the wilds of the Cavernous Yin. The demon kings transformed the qi of Kan and Li into a colossal black turtle and a monstrous serpent, but the Dark Thearch’s divine power pressed them beneath his feet, binding the ghostly hordes within the Great Cavern of Fengdu. With the cosmos pacified, the Dark Thearch returned in triumph. The Supreme One conferred upon him a sacred title, appointing him Preceptor of the Jade Void and Dark Heaven Thearch, as well as Inspector of the Nine Heavens.\n\nHis sacred father was named Heavenly Lord Mo Le, Radiant Perfected Great Thearch; his sacred mother, Supreme Consort Shan Sheng, Jade Perfected Celestial Immortal. Beneath the Celestial Pass was the Dark Mystery Fire Essence, Yin General, Red Numinous Venerable Deity. At the Earthly Axis was the Dark Mystery Water Essence, Yang-Nurturing General, Fish Numinous Venerable Deity, both dwelling in the Heavenly One.\n\nAt the Northern Dipper’s Bureau for Expelling Evil, the Left Judge—who was Yan Zhenqing of the Tang—served. Emperor Dezong dispatched Zhenqing to punish Li Xilie’s kin, and his family saw him off at the Slope of Everlasting Joy. Intoxicated, Zhenqing leapt and danced before the pillars, saying: “Long ago, I met the Daoist Tao Ba, who bestowed upon me the Jade Radiance Elixir of the Azure Dawn. To this day, I have not aged.” He added: “At seventy, I shall face a calamity, yet it will turn auspicious. One day, await me on Mount Luofu—could this be that very calamity?” Arriving in Daliang, Xilie ordered him strangled, and he was buried south of the city. When Xilie’s house fell, someone opened the coffin and found his countenance lifelike, his body suffused with golden light, his nails extending beyond his hands, his beard and hair grown several feet long. He was reburied in the northern mountains of Yanshi. Later, a merchant traveled to Mount Luofu, where he saw two Daoists playing chess beneath a tree. One asked: “Who has come here?”\n\nThe merchant replied, “I am but a humble traveler from Luoyang.”\n\nThe Daoist smiled and said, “Would you deliver a letter to my family?”\n\nHe sent a young disciple to fetch paper and brush, then wrote a letter. When the merchant returned to the northern mountains of Yanshi, the descendants of the Yan family received the letter and exclaimed in shock, “This is our late Grand Preceptor’s own hand!”\n\nThey opened the tomb and found the coffin empty.\n\nLater, Bai Yuchan stated: “Yan Zhenqing serves as the Left Judgment Official of the Northern Dipper, Expeller of Demons.” The Emperor of Zitong was born on the third day of the second month.\n\nAccording to the *Inner Records of Qinghe*: I was originally a being of the Heavenly Assembly, born at the beginning of the Zhou dynasty. After seventy-three transformations, I became a scholar-official, never oppressing the people or abusing my authority. My nature was stern and my conduct scrutinous—unyielding as autumn frost or the noonday sun.\n\nAt the end of the Western Jin, I was reborn in the region between Yue and Jun. It was the dingwei year, the third day of the second month, when I was born. Auspicious light enveloped the household, and yellow clouds shrouded the fields. My dwelling lay near the sea. The villagers addressed me as the Old Man of Qinghe and said, “At sixty, you have at last been blessed with a noble heir.” As a child, I disliked play and yearned for mountains and marshes. My speech often seemed cryptic, yet I recited all the classics. I shunned the company of other children, laughing and rejoicing alone. My body radiated light, and when the villagers came to pray, I would scoff at them. I would cry out in a long whistle: “If mere earth and wood can clothe themselves in human garments, eat human food, and bring blessings when worshipped or misfortune when slandered—how can I, a man, lack spirit?”\n\nThereafter, I dreamed at night of becoming a dragon, or of receiving the celestial tally of a king, or of bearing the water tally. Though I found these dreams strange, I did not fully believe them to be auspicious omens. When the three harvests failed and drought withered the crops, the rain dances and prayers to the gods yielded no response. I thought: “In my dream, I governed the Water Palace. Tonight, it shall be proven.”\n\nThat night, I went to the water’s edge and, as in my dream, presented the river god with an official document. My soul trembled with fear, and I could not compose myself. Suddenly, dark clouds gathered, winds howled, and thunder roared. An official knelt before me and said, “The Regional Judge has arrived.”\n\nI replied, “It is not I. I am the son of Zhang the Elder, named Ya.”\n\nThe Water Palace had received word, so they called me Xuemei.\n\nThe official said, “I am here at your command.”\n\nI asked, “How fares my family?”\n\nHe replied, “They have already arrived at the administrative office.”\n\nStill trembling, I bowed my head. The official gestured toward a white donkey, and we departed. In the midst of the storm, I lost all sense of my homeland. We arrived at a mountain, where the Sword Ridge soared like the stars of Shen and Can, resembling a phoenix at rest. Below, a tongue-like path led me into a vast cavern. At the entrance stood a stone. The official said, “When the people pray for rain and touch this stone, their prayers are answered. It is called the Thunder Pillar.”\n\nAs I lifted my robe to enter the cavern, the official spoke again: “Do you recall that in the Zhou dynasty, you were a man who, after seventy-three transformations, passed down hidden virtue through your family—does this continue to this day?”\n\nThen I fully awakened, as if from a dream.\n\nThe official said, “Your name is recorded in the celestial registers as a divine being. In the human world, there are those who know of you. The Jin dynasty will soon show signs of revival. You may seek a method to manifest your transformation.”\n\nI replied, “I thank the celestial messenger for this revelation.”\n\nUpon entering the cavern, I felt as though I had fallen into an abyss of a thousand fathoms, yet my feet did not touch the ground—I seemed to float in midair. Within the palace of the king, guards stood at attention. I entered and saw my family, all gathered there.\n\nOn another day, I donned the robes of a scholar and traveled to Xianyang, where I lectured on the tales of Yao and Mu. The temple stands north of the Nine Bends in Zitong County, Jianzhou. Within its halls is the Pavilion of Descending Brush, where a five-colored flying simurgh is suspended by a golden chain. The simurgh’s beak holds a brush adorned with hundreds of layers of golden blossoms. The brush remains poised above the pavilion, with ink and paper always at the ready. The temple’s doors are sealed by officials appointed by the prefecture to prevent fraud.\n\nWhen the brush descends, a bronze bell in the pavilion rings of its own accord. The temple officials report this to the prefecture, and the appointed officials unlock the doors to retrieve the message. The writings often exhort people to take loyalty and filial piety as their foundation.\n\nRecently, the usurper Xi arrogated the title of King of Shu. He prepared sacrificial animals and ritual vessels, purified himself, and personally visited the temple of the Emperor to offer sacrifices. As he was about to perform the rites, a black wind suddenly rose, extinguishing the candles and scattering the incense. Xi trembled in fear and prostrated himself before the hall. When the wind subsided, he saw that the prayer tablet had split in two.\n\nThe Emperor was posthumously enfeoffed by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang as Left Chancellor. Emperor Xizong of Tang further enfeoffed him as King of Shunji. Emperor Taizu of Song bestowed upon him the sacred title *Loyal, Martial, Filial, and Virtuous Divine King*. His sacred consort was the *Virtuous and Harmonious Concubine of Cooperative Power*; his sacred father, the *Manifest, Celebrated, Benevolent, and Protective King of Abundant Kindness*; his sacred mother, the *Illustrious and Virtuous Concubine of Accumulated Blessings*; his sacred son, the *Hereditary King of Continuing Virtue*; his sacred daughter-in-law, the *Virtuous and Manifest Lady of Excellent Assistance*; his sacred second son, the *King of Flourishing Virtue*; his sacred second daughter-in-law, the *Virtuous and Harmonious Lady of Compliant Assistance*; his sacred grandson, the *Marquis of Illustrious Response to Inherited Mandate*; his sacred grandson’s wife, the *Lady of Virtuous Response*; his sacred second grandson, the *Marquis of Proclaiming Response to Mandate*; and his sacred second grandson’s wife, the *Lady of Kind Response*.\n\nAmong his assisting deities: the *King of Blessed Peace, Loyal, Martial, and Assisting Wings*, who serves as the Grand Marshal of Auspicious Tidings; the two celestial officials of the left and right registers of cinnamon and emolument.\n\nOn the seventh day of the third month of the third year of the Yanyou era, he was further enfeoffed with the sacred title *Emperor of Vast Assistance, Opener of Transformation, Controller of Emolument, and Vast Benevolence*.\n\nThe Three Perfected Lords of Wu:\nIn the time of King Li of Zhou, there were three remonstrating officials: Tang, Ge, and Zhou. The king was fond of hunting and neglected governance. The three officials admonished him, saying: “The former kings governed the state with benevolence and righteousness, transforming the people through virtue. Thus, the realm submitted in harmony. We have never heard of a ruler who indulged in the reckless pursuit of game.”\n\nTheir repeated remonstrances went unheeded, so the three officials resigned their posts and journeyed south to Wu. The King of Wu was greatly pleased. When the army of Chu invaded Wu, the king was deeply troubled. The three officials stepped forward and said: “We offer our lives in service to Your Majesty. We have a plan to secure the state—do not worry.”\n\nThe three officials met the enemy, each employing divine strategies. Chu surrendered, and the King of Wu wished to reward them. They declined, saying: “We are but guest ministers. We dare not accept your gifts.”\n\nLater, learning of King Li’s death and King Xuan’s ascension, they returned to the Zhou realm. King Xuan bestowed upon them rich rewards and restored their ranks. Subsequently, they rescued Crown Prince Jing by subduing the envoys of the Five Directions and averted unnatural disasters. King Xuan then stationed the three officials in Dongcui, where they governed with compassion, soothing the people and distributing their bounty. Merchants petitioned for their resources, and wherever they went, want was unknown. The state flourished, and the three officials were elevated and enfeoffed as marquises. Tang Hong, styled Wenming, was granted the title *Fuling Hou* and was born on the twenty-first day of the seventh month. Ge Yong, styled Wendu, was granted the title *Weiling Hou* and was born on the thirteenth day of the second month. Zhou Wu, styled Wengang, was granted the title *Jialing Hou* and was born on the second day of the tenth month.\n\nIn the first year of the Xiangfu era of the Song, Emperor Zhenzong performed the Feng sacrifice at Mount Tai. As he reached the Heavenly Gate, he suddenly saw three immortals descend from the sky. The emperor respectfully inquired of them. The three immortals replied: “We are commanded by Heaven to protect Your Majesty’s carriage.” The emperor then enfeoffed the three immortals as *Shangyuan Daohua Zhenjun*, *Zhongyuan Huzheng Zhenjun*, and *Xiayuan Dingzhi Zhenjun*, jointly overseeing the netherworld administration of Mount Tai.\n\nThe eulogy reads:\n*Adaptive sages, lords of virtue and power,*\n*They left Zhou for Wu, saving the world and its people.*\n*In Zhou, their glory reached its peak; in Wu, they were honored as guest ministers.*\n*In Song, they met Zhenzong, revealing themselves at the Heavenly Gate.*\n*The emperor personally inquired, and thus learned their cause.*\n*Tang, Ge, and Zhou—spirits of Heaven, Earth, and Water—*\n*By royal decree, they guarded the sagely carriage.*\n*The emperor composed a wondrous eulogy, inscribing their names.*\n*At the summit’s shrine, the Three Spirits were established.*\n\n---\n\n**Xu Zhenjun** (born on the first day of the eighth month)\nXu Zhenjun, named Xu Xun, styled Jingzhi, was a native of Runan. His ancestors had long revered the supreme Dao. In his youth, Zhenjun studied under the Great Cavern Perfected Lord Wu Meng, receiving the teachings of the Three Clarities. He was recommended as a *xiaolian* and appointed magistrate of Jinyang in Shu. Due to the chaos of the Jin, he resigned his post and traveled east of the Yangtze with Lord Wu. When Wang Dun rebelled, the two lords presented themselves to Wang, bearing talismans and incantations, seeking to halt his rebellion and preserve the Jin.\n\nOne day, they visited Wang Dun alongside Guo Pu. Wang, harboring resentment, received them and said: “Last night, I dreamed of lifting a wooden beam that shattered the heavens. Will my usurpation of the imperial throne be entirely successful?” He asked them to interpret the dream. Xu replied: “This dream is not auspicious. The wood breaking through the heavens forms the character *song* (宋). Your Grace must not act rashly.” He then instructed Guo Pu to divine the matter, who said: “It will not succeed.” When asked about Wang’s lifespan, Guo replied: “If you rise in rebellion, disaster will come swiftly. If you remain in Wuchang, your fate will be unfathomable.” Enraged, Wang asked: “How long is *your* lifespan?” Guo answered: “My life ends today.” Wang ordered his guards to seize Guo Pu and execute him. The two lords, still at the banquet, vanished in an instant.\n\nThey reached the mouth of the Lu River and summoned a boat to cross to Zhongling. The boatman refused, saying no one was available to row. The two lords said: “Just take us aboard; we will propel the boat ourselves.” They warned the boatman: “You must firmly shut the door and hide. If you hear the sound of the boat moving, do not peek.” Once aboard, the boatman soon heard the creaking of the vessel and the rustling of leaves. Unable to resist, he stole a glance and saw two dragons pulling the boat atop Zixiao Peak. The dragons, sensing his gaze, abandoned the boat and departed. The two lords said: “You disobeyed our instructions. What is to be done now?” They then left the boatman atop the peak, teaching him to consume sacred herbs and imparting the arts of immortality. The boat’s traces remain there to this day.\n\nLater, in Yuzhang, Zhenjun encountered a young man of refined bearing who called himself Shen Lang. Zhenjun conversed with him and knew he was not human. After the youth departed, he told his disciples: “That young man was a jiao-shen spirit. I fear that if we do not eliminate him, he will continue to bring floods to Jiangxi.” He surveyed the area with his Daoist vision and saw the spirit transformed into a yellow ox on a sandbar. Zhenjun said to his disciple Shi Taiyu: “That yellow ox is the one. I will transform into a black ox and engage it in battle with a white cloth. You must strike it with your sword.” Soon, the two oxen charged at each other, and Taiyu’s blade struck the yellow ox’s left thigh. It fled into a well west of the city, followed by the black ox, and the spirit escaped.\n\nEarlier, the spirit had transformed into a clever young man in Tanzhou, amassing treasures and marrying the daughter of the prefect, Jia Yu. He often traveled the rivers and lakes, returning with abundant goods. This time, he returned empty-handed, claiming to have been robbed and wounded. Shortly after, the steward announced: “A Daoist named Xu Jingzhi seeks an audience with the prefect.” Jia Yu received him and seated him. Zhenjun said: “I hear you have a fine son-in-law. May I meet him?” Shen feigned illness and refused to appear. Zhenjun thundered: “Jiao spirit, old demon, how dare you conceal your form!” The spirit then reverted to its true shape before the hall, and Zhenjun commanded the celestial spirits to slay it. He also ordered the two children brought before him, sprinkled them with water, and they transformed into small shen. The wife, Jia Shi, nearly changed as well, but her parents pleaded fervently, and Zhenjun relented. He instructed them to dig over a *zhang* beneath the house, where the earth was dry and waterless. He then ordered them to move quickly. Moments later, the official residence sank entirely, leaving only the traces of the shen.\n\nLater, in the second year of the Taikang era of the Eastern Jin dynasty, on the first day of the eighth month, the entire household ascended to the heavens in broad daylight at West Mountain in Hongzhou. After Zhenjun’s ascension, the villagers and his clansmen established a shrine on that site. They inscribed the one hundred twenty poems he had left behind onto bamboo slips, placed them in a bamboo basket, and allowed people to draw lots from them to divine fortune and misfortune—calling them the \"Sacred Lots.\" On the seventeenth day of the fifth month in the second year of the Zhenghe era of Emperor Huizong of the Song, he was bestowed the honorific title: \"Zhenjun of Divine Merit and Wondrous Salvation.\" The temple was elevated to an abbey, and the plaque was granted the name \"Jade Prosperity and Longevity of Ten Thousand Years.\"\n\nThe emperor, while reading in the Chongzheng Hall, suddenly seemed to dream of a Daoist at the north of the Donghua Gate, wearing a Nine-Flowered Crown and a crimson robe, leading a great entourage. Approaching the vermilion steps, the Daoist bowed and presented a bamboo slip. The emperor asked: \"Who are you, that you arrive without summons?\" The Daoist replied: \"I am Xu Jingyang, temporarily overseeing the affairs of the Nine Heavens. By the decree of the Supreme Emperor, I was passing through the former kingdom on my way to inspect the Western Kingdom of Shravasti.\"\n\nThe emperor further inquired: \"I suffer from the *anxi* sores, and no medicine has been able to cure them. Does the Perfected Lord have a remedy?\" The Perfected Lord immediately took a small gourd, poured out a single pill the size of a mung bean, breathed an incantation over it, and applied it to the sores. The emperor felt as though flowing ghee suffused his body, penetrating to the bone with a cool, soothing sensation. The Perfected Lord then bowed and departed. After several steps, he turned back and said: \"My humble abode has long fallen into desolation. I would be most fortunate if Your Sacred Majesty would deign to glance upon it.\" The emperor awoke with a start, and at once ordered a portrait painted in likeness of the figure from his dream. It was enshrined with reverence in the Upper Clarity Repository of Auspicious Blessings Abbey. An edict was issued to seek out the Perfected Lord’s former dwelling; where no abbey or temple existed, officials of the local jurisdiction were to construct one. If any abbey or temple had fallen into disrepair, it was to be restored according to proper standards. Where no permanent endowment existed, nearby official fields were to be allocated for its upkeep. The sagely court honored him further with the four-character title \"Mysteriously Responsive of the Supreme Dao,\" while his other honorifics remained unchanged.\n\n**Celestial Master Zhang**\nThe Celestial Master was Zhang Daoling of the Han. A descendant of Zhang Liang in the eighth generation, he was born in the Wutianmu Mountains during the *Jianwu* era of Emperor Guangwu. He studied the arts of longevity and dwelled in seclusion on Mount Beiyu. Emperors Zhang and He repeatedly summoned him, but he declined. After a time, he wandered among the famous mountains. Traveling east to the Yunjin Stream in Xing’an, he ascended a height and gazed out, saying: \"This place holds extraordinary wonders.\" He then followed the current to the Yunjin Grotto, where he found a cliffside cave and refined the elixir within.\n\nAfter three years, the Azure Dragon and White Tiger circled above at a distance, and the elixir was completed. He consumed it, and though then sixty years of age, his appearance grew ever more youthful. He also obtained secret texts, mastering divine transformations to expel demons and spirits. Later, on Cloud Terrace Peak in Shu, he ascended to heaven, leaving behind his scriptures, talismans, seals, and sword to be passed down to his descendants. His lineage flourished through four generations, and they continued to dwell upon this mountain, revered through the ages. Today, his descendants, inheriting the title of Perfected One, reside at Dragon-Tiger Mountain in Guixi County, Guangxin Prefecture, Jiangxi.\n\n**The Three Mao Perfected Lords**\nThe Three Mao Perfected Lords were born on the eighteenth day of the third month. Mao Ying, styled Shushen, was a descendant of Mao Xuan. His younger brothers were Mao Gu, styled Jiwei, and Mao Zhong, styled Sihe. Born in the fifth year of Emperor Jing of Han’s *Zhongyuan* era, Mao Ying was exceptional from youth, devoted to purity and emptiness. At eighteen, he left home to cultivate the Dao on Mount Da, consuming pine resin. Later, he studied under Master Wang, journeyed west to Tortoise Mountain, and was received by the Queen Mother of the West, who bestowed upon him the *Scripture of the Supreme Ultimate and Mysterious Perfection*. He returned to the northern valley of Mount Heng at the age of forty-nine.\n\nMao Ying’s parents were still living. His father, displeased with his prolonged absence, sought to cane him. Mao Ying knelt and said: \"I have received sacred talismans from my master, and celestial soldiers always attend me. If you cane me, I fear they will intervene, and my offense will only grow heavier.\" His father, wishing to test his words, struck him, but the cane shattered into dozens of pieces, as if shot from a bow—where it struck the wall, the wall was pierced; where it struck a pillar, the pillar sank. Only then did his parents recognize his attainment of the Dao and desist. Mao Ying said: \"I feared precisely this outcome.\"\n\nLater, his two younger brothers both rose to prominence: Mao Zhong became Governor of Xihe, and Mao Gu became Commandant of the Palace Guard. When they were to depart for their posts, hundreds from their hometown came to see them off. Mao Ying, also present, smiled and said to the guests: \"Though I do not hold a two-thousand-bushel office, next year on the third day of the fourth month, when I ascend as an immortal, the send-off will not be inferior to today’s.\" The crowd did not believe him. This was the fourth year of Emperor Xuan’s *Chuyuan* era.\n\nOn the appointed day, several *qing* of land before his gate suddenly leveled themselves, not a blade of grass remaining. They were covered with azure silk tents, and white felt carpets were laid beneath, accommodating hundreds. The guests assembled, and a grand feast was held. Though no attendants were seen, golden platters and jade cups appeared before the mats of their own accord, filled with fine wine, rare delicacies, and exotic fruits beyond description. Music of strings, bamboo, metal, and stone filled their ears, and the fragrance of orchid and musk wafted for miles. Soon, the welcoming officials arrived—hundreds clad in vermilion robes and jade belts, their banners and armor gleaming like the sun. Mao Ying bid farewell to his family and friends, then mounted his carriage and ascended upon the clouds, drifting away.\n\nHis two brothers, still in office, heard of Mao Ying’s ascension and resigned, returning home to seek their brother on the eastern mountain. Mao Ying appeared to them and said: \"Why have you awakened so late? Now you are both aged, and though you may still attain the true methods, you can only become earthbound immortals.\" He first taught them methods to prolong life and avoid death, instructing them to maintain a strict fast for three years. He then transmitted the supreme Dao, teaching them to cultivate the *qi* of the Mysterious Perfection within the Hall of Light. To each, he gave a dose of nine-times-cycled returning elixir and a divine formula. They ingested and wore these, and thus also attained immortality. Later generations called them the Three Mao Perfected Lords. Their temples stand in majestic array upon the three peaks of Mount Mao in Jurong, where their numinous efficacy is wondrously manifest. Pilgrims from south of the Yangtze flock to pay homage.\n\n**Lord Zhang of Mount Ci**\nThe Great Emperor’s surname was Zhang, his given name Bo, and his courtesy name Boqi. He was a native of Longyang in Wuling. His father was the Dragon Lord of Longyang, and his mother was Lady Zhang. The Dragon Lord and Lady Zhang were traveling by the embankments of Lake Tai when suddenly a storm arose—wind, rain, and darkness, with thunder and lightning. Lady Zhang vanished, but after a moment, the skies cleared, and she said she had seen a celestial deity who bestowed upon her a golden elixir. Soon after, she conceived.\n\nOn the night of the eleventh day of the second month in the third year of the *Shenjue* era of the Western Han, he was born. As he grew, he became extraordinarily tall, with a prominent nose, long whiskers, and an awe-inspiring presence. He declared that the land was too desolate to establish a home. Following an animal that guided his path, he journeyed east with Lady Li to Wu and Kuaiji, crossed the Zhe River, and arrived at Mount Caoyun and White Crane Mountain. There, four streams converged below the mountain, and the lord settled there.\n\nAt White Crane Mountain, he took Lady Liu as his consort, and at Mulberry Site in Wucheng, he took Lady Zhao as his attendant. He had nine younger brothers, five sons, one daughter, and eight grandsons. Initially, in Wu and Changxing County of Guiji Prefecture, he employed yin soldiers to dredge and excavate the Sacred Ditch, extending thirty *li* from Changxing to Jingxi, intending to connect the waterway to Guangde. The lord’s drum platform was misled by a crow, and seeing that Lady Li had transformed, he did not meet with her again. He transformed atop Mount Heng, five *li* west of Guangde County, and the locals, missing him, established a temple in his honor. Lady Li also transformed two *li* east of the county, and the people built a temple for her as well.\n\nThe river of the Sacred Ditch silted up and became farmland, now known as the Bathing Soldiers’ Pond. It formed a lake for irrigation, nourishing nearly ten thousand *qing* of fields along its shores. The Drum Platform remains—birds dare not perch there, nor ants gather. It is said that during the *Dabao* era of the Tang, prayers for rain were answered. He was first posthumously appointed Gentleman of the Waterworks. Mount Heng was renamed Mount Ci. Emperor Zhaozong of the Tang posthumously appointed him Vice Minister of Agriculture and bestowed upon him the title of *Jinzi*. Emperor Jingzong of the Later Tang enfeoffed him as Marquis of Guangde. The Southern Tang enfeoffed him as Minister of Works and Duke of Guangde. The Later Jin enfeoffed him as King of Guangde. Emperor Renzong of the Song enfeoffed him as King of Lingji. By the reign of Emperor Ningzong, his title had expanded to an eight-character honorific. In the fifth year of *Chunyou* during the reign of Emperor Lizong, he was renamed Perfected Lord of Upright Protection, Sacred Efficacy, and Illustrious Might. In the second year of *Duanping*, he was further honored as Perfected Lord of Upright Protection, Sacred Efficacy, Illustrious Virtue, Prosperity, and Blessed Fortune.\n\nHis birthday, the eleventh day of the second month, was celebrated. Lady Li, born on the second day of the second month, was enfeoffed as Consort of Harmonious Response, Beneficent Aid, Compassionate Radiance, and Vast Kindness. Lady Zhao was enfeoffed as Consort of Harmonious Compliance, Bearing Aid, Compassionate Protection, and Vast Assistance.\n\nThe Perfected Marquis of Manifest Blessings, Lasting Glory, Far-Reaching Numinosity, and Benevolent Wisdom. His grandmother, the Lady of Manifest Responses, Foundational Numinosity, and Illustrious Radiance. His grandfather, the Perfected Marquis of Compassionate Responses, Harboring Light, Storing Blessings, and Proliferating Numinosity. His mother, the Lady of Compassionate Wisdom, Continuing Excellence, Sagely Goodness, and Sacred Virtue.\n\nHis nine younger brothers:\nThe Perfected Marquis of Numinous Efficacy, Universal Salvation, and Illustrious Assistance; the Lady of Numinous Virtue, Illustrious Wisdom, and Auspicious Kindness.\nThe Perfected Marquis of Good Fortune, Pervasive Efficacy, and Numinous Assistance; the Lady of Good Virtue, Assisting Wisdom, and Upright Kindness.\nThe Perfected Marquis of Harmonious Success, Trustworthy Responses, and Manifest Assistance; the Lady of Harmonious Virtue, Proliferating Wisdom, and Illustrious Kindness.\nThe Perfected Marquis of Healthful Defense, Illustrious Responses, and Vast Assistance; the Lady of Healthful Virtue, Harmonious Wisdom, and Manifest Kindness.\nThe Perfected Marquis of Tranquil Guardianship, Ascending Prosperity, and Vast Assistance; the Lady of Tranquil Virtue, Refined Wisdom, and Numinous Kindness.\nThe Perfected Marquis of Restful Responses, Abundant Blessings, and Trustworthy Assistance; the Lady of Restful Virtue, Spreading Wisdom, and Serene Kindness.\nThe Perfected Marquis of Illustrious Salvation, Blessed Humility, and Good Assistance; the Lady of Salvific Virtue, Moderating Wisdom, and Prosperous Kindness.\nThe Perfected Marquis of Illustrious Protection, Pervasive Salvation, and Trustworthy Assistance; the Lady of Illustrious Virtue, Serene Wisdom, and Bright Kindness.\nThe Perfected Marquis of Auspicious Wisdom, Upright Compliance, and Harmonious Assistance; the Lady of Auspicious Virtue, Gentle Wisdom, and Radiant Kindness.\n\nHis sons:\nThe Prince of Inheriting Glory, Manifest Salvation, and Initiating Protection, born on the fifteenth day of the fifth month.\nThe Lady of Inheriting Sacrifices, Assisting Blessings, Primordial Solemnity, and Harmonious Responses.\nThe Duke of Continuing Responses and Illustrious Protection, born on the fourth day of the first month.\nThe Lady of Continuing Concubines, Multicolored Blessings, and Illustrious Solemnity.\nThe Duke of Flourishing Beauty and Revered Protection, born on the fifteenth day of the third month.\nThe Lady of Salvific Harmony, Preserving Blessings, and Reverent Solemnity.\nThe Duke of Continuing Rest, Vast Protection, born on the twelfth day of the twelfth month.\nThe Lady of Continuing Matriarchs, Revered Blessings, and Harmonious Solemnity.\nThe Duke of Good Succession and Trustworthy Protection, born on the eleventh day of the first month.\nThe Lady of Good Conduct, Spreading Blessings, and Auspicious Solemnity.\n\nHis daughters.\n\nThe Lady of Refined Manifestation, Gentle Excellence, and Commanding Demeanor.\n\nThe royal son-in-law, the Lady Li, originally held the position of *Guangwu Wuxiang* and presided over the ritual altar and sacrificial rites, where she was invoked as follows:\n\nThe royal grandsons:\nFirst: Marquis of Eternal Blessings.\nSecond: Marquis of Extending the Community.\nThird: Marquis of Extending Protection.\nFourth: Marquis of Extending Grace.\nFifth: Marquis of Extending Auspiciousness.\nSixth: Marquis of Extending Abundance.\nSeventh: Marquis of Extending Felicitation.\nEighth: Marquis of Extending Benevolence.\n\nThe assisting deities, the Three Sages of *Ding* and *Ren*, and the ritual attendants were enfeoffed as *Xieling Zhu*.\n\nThe Five Sages’ origins: born on the twenty-eighth day of the ninth month.\nAccording to the *Record of the Ancestral Hall’s Divine Responses*: The deities of the Five Manifest Lords existed between Heaven and Earth as their primordial origin. During the *Guangqi* era of the Tang, they descended upon this town. No records were kept in official registers, so later generations had no means to verify their history. Only the town’s elders transmitted the account orally: A townsman, Wang Yu, owned a garden on the northern outskirts. One night, a crimson glow illuminated the sky above the garden. The townspeople, led by Mi Wang, observed five deities descending from Heaven, their retinue and bearing like those of kings and marquises. Clad in yellow robes with black silk sashes, they sat upon armrest chairs and summoned Yu, saying: “We are entrusted with Heaven’s mandate to receive offerings in this land and bestow blessings upon its people. Tenfold greater than seeking seclusion, we have come to dwell here. If our temple is established here, your blessings shall be boundless.” Yu bowed and replied, “As you command.” With these words, auspicious clouds gathered on all sides, and the deities ascended to Heaven.\n\nThe next day, the townspeople came to inspect the site. To the east stood Fang Mountain, to the west Pei Mountain. On the left, Yaodun Hill encircled it; on the right, Shecheng coiled around it. To the south, two ponds stood majestic, while a great stream flowed before and behind. From the north, the terrain wound sinuously; from the west, two peaks descended, uniquely precipitous and verdant. The water’s outlet was propitious—a fine location indeed. Together, they cut bamboo and thatched grass to construct a splendid hall, sculpted images in the deities’ likeness, and reverently enshrined their spirits. Word spread, and people from afar gathered in throngs.\n\nSince then, the deities descended, demonstrating merit for the state and bestowing blessings upon the people without cease. Initially, the temple was simply called the *Five Manifestations*. During the *Dazhong* era, it was granted the temple plaque *Lingshun*. In the *Xuanhe* era, the deities were enfeoffed as Two-Character Marquises. In the *Shaoxing* era, they were elevated to Four-Character Marquises; in the *Qiandao* era, to Eight-Character Marquises. In the early *Chunxi* era, they were enfeoffed as Two-Character Dukes; in the *Jiachen* year, as Four-Character Dukes. In the eleventh year, they were elevated to Six-Character Dukes; in the sixth year of *Qingyuan*, to Eight-Character Dukes. In the second year of *Jiatai*, they were enfeoffed as Two-Character Kings; in the first year of *Jiding*, as Four-Character Kings. For their unseen assistance in the Jiangzuo region, they were enfeoffed as Six-Character Kings. In the sixth year, an imperial edict in the eleventh month elevated them to Eight-Character Kings. Emperor Lizong later altered their title to the Eight-Character Kingly designation.\n\nThe *Dagong Hu* of the 102nd rank, Inspector.\nThe *Dudagong Hu Jingyi*, Commander-in-Chief.\n\nThe *Dagong* Huang Taibao.\nThe *Dagong* Wang Taibao.\nThe Two Commanders of the Gold Mace.\nThe Judges Who Reward Good and Punish Evil.\n\nAccording to the *Rites of Zhou: Minor Zongbo*, the Five Thearchs were sacrificed to in the four suburbs. The Han ceremonial system worshipped the Five Sacrifices. In the Song dynasty’s *Mingtang* diagram, the Five Directional Thearchs were positioned beside the August Heaven, accompanied by the Five Human Emperors and the Five Official Spirits—all manifestations of the qi governing the Five Phases. For the Five Phases are the greatest forces between Heaven and Earth, the sovereigns of all transformation and action. Thus, they are named Xuanming, Zhurong, Goumang, Rushou, and Houtu—each corresponding to Water, Fire, Metal, Wood, and Earth. If these Five Spirits descend here, is it not to silently aid the creative transformations of the Five Phases and bless the people?\n\nSome mistakenly equate the Five Sages with the *Wutong* spirits, claiming they are not orthodox deities—a confusion of names and reality indeed. Every year on the eighth day of the fourth month, this county holds a grand fast, drawing crowds of scholars and commoners.\n\nThe imperial edicts of our dynasty have conferred the following titles:\n\n**First Rank:**\nManifestly Wise, Resonantly Responsive, Numinously Efficacious, Vastly Beneficent King;\nManifestly Auspicious, Harmoniously Blessed, Resonantly Assisting Consort.\n\n**Second Rank:**\nManifestly Illustrious, Resonantly Arrayed, Numinously Protective, Vastly Blessing King;\nManifestly Benevolent, Harmoniously Auspicious, Kindly Assisting Consort.\n\n**Third Rank:**\nManifestly Upright, Resonantly Compliant, Numinously Guarding, Vastly Kind King;\nManifestly Harmonious, Harmoniously Assisting, Uprightly Aiding Consort.\n\n**Fourth Rank:**\nManifestly Upright, Resonantly Blessing, Numinously Nourishing, Vastly Merciful King;\nManifestly Assisting, Harmoniously Harmonious, Joyfully Aiding Consort.\n\n**Fifth Rank:**\nManifestly Virtuous, Resonantly Beneficent, Numinously Aiding, Vastly Accomplished King;\nManifestly Fortunate, Harmoniously Loving, Tranquilly Assisting Consort.\n\n**Ancestral Line:**\nThe King’s paternal grandfather: Initiating Protection, Joyfully Responsive, Spreading Mercy Marquis;\nHis grandmother: Prolonging Blessings, Assisting Compliance, Compassionately Nourishing Consort.\n\nThe King’s father: Vastly Kind, Compassionately Beneficent, Squarely Righteous Marquis;\nHis mother: Honoring Blessings, Compassionately Harmonious, Auspiciously Kind Consort.\n\nHis elder sister: Joyfully Responsive, Assisting Wisdom, Gracefully Manifest Consort;\nHis younger sister: Reverently Compliant, Fortunate and Kind, Tranquilly Manifest Consort.\n\nAs for the two subordinate spirits, it is said that the Five Lords, being exalted, do not wish to startle the eyes and ears of the people with matters of fortune and misfortune, and thus delegate these tasks to the two spirits.\n\nThe Yellow-Robed Daoist;\nThe Purple-Robed Yuanjue Great Marshal.\n\nThe Assisting Numinous, Brilliant and Kindly Scribe Marquis;\nThe Assisting Compliant, Brilliant and Benevolent Subordinate Marquis.\n\nThe Brilliant and Responsive, Assisting and Compliant Zhou Marquis;\nMagistrate Linghu.\n\nThe Two Yuan Masters, Wang Nian;\nThe *Dagong* Gao Taibao.\n\n**The Most Sacred, Illuminously Numinous King** (born on the twelfth day of the fifth month):\nThe Most Sacred, Illuminously Numinous King is the third son of the Eastern Peak, Heavenly Equal, Benevolent and Sacred Thearch. Emperor Taizong of Tang bestowed upon him the title of Mighty and Heroic General. By the time of Emperor Taizong of Song, he was enfeoffed as the Supreme August, Illuminously Numinous Duke. In the first year of *Dazhong Xiangfu*, on the fifteenth day of the first month, he was elevated to the Most Sacred, Illuminously Numinous King.\n\n**The Protective Sage Perfected Lord:**\nThe Protective Sage Perfected Lord, surnamed Mao and named Ying, was originally from Xianyang in Chang’an. From childhood, he left home to seek the Dao, visiting famous mountains and grottoes. He encountered the Perfected Lord Wang, who bestowed upon him the arts of longevity, and he attained the Way, becoming known as a Heavenly Immortal. During the reign of Emperor Ming of Han, in the third year of *Yongping*, a celestial script suddenly descended, inscribed in jade seal characters with dragon patterns, proclaiming that the Great Thearch, Protective Life Perfected Lord, would jointly oversee matters of life and death in the netherworld with the Eastern Peak, Heavenly Equal, Benevolent and Sacred Thearch. Emperor Taizong of Song enfeoffed him as the Protective Sage Perfected Lord, and Emperor Zhenzong later elevated him to the Nine Heavens’ Controller of Destinies, Supreme Minister, Bestowing Blessings Protective Sage Perfected Lord.\n\n**Wang Shichen:**\nShichen, surnamed Wang and named Wenqing, was a native of Linchuan during the Song dynasty. *Shichen* was his official title. He possessed an extraordinary physiognomy, and those of the Dao esteemed him. In his youth, he traveled the four directions, traversing nearly the entire cosmos. He once encountered an extraordinary person who transmitted to him the Daoist arts, enabling him to summon wind and thunder. Emperor Huizong of Song honored him as the Golden Gate Feathered Guest and *Ningshen* Hall *Shichen*, his favor unmatched at the time, though he declined all rewards. When a great drought struck Yangzhou, an imperial edict sought rain. Shichen drew his sword and struck the water, saying, “I borrow three feet of the Yellow River’s water.” Several days later, Yangzhou reported rain, its waters yellow and turbid. He repeatedly displayed numinous wonders. During the Yuan dynasty, a shrine was first established for him, and today it stands within the prefectural city of Jianchang.\n\nThose who hold sacrificial animals and silk to seek numinous responses crowd the roads.\n\n**Yuan Qianli:**\nYuan Sheng, styled Qianli, was a native of Nanfeng and the nephew of Wang Shichen. He mastered the arts of commanding thunder and lightning, inheriting them from his uncle. During the *Duanping* era, he lodged with Dai Dian. One day, he said to Dai Dian, “I am departing. You may cremate me.” Having spoken, he passed away. Dai cremated him, and amidst the flames of the pyre, a banner appeared, inscribed in golden characters: *Yunlei Er Pandao Yuan Qianli* (Second Judge of Thunderclouds, Yuan Qianli).\n\n**Zhang Guolao:**\nSurnamed Zhang, named Guo, he secluded himself on Mount Zhongtiao in Hengzhou, traveling between Fen and Jin.\n\nHe was said to have mastered the secret arts of longevity. Elders recalled seeing him in their youth, already claiming to be several centuries old. He once rode a white donkey that could travel tens of thousands of *li* in a day. When resting, he would fold it up until it was as thin as paper and store it in his headscarf box. To ride again, he would sprinkle water upon it, and it would transform back into a donkey. Emperor Taizong and Emperor Gaozong of the Tang summoned him, but he refused to emerge. Empress Wu Zetian later called him out of the mountains, yet he feigned death before the Temple of Tuo Nu. Later, someone encountered him again in the mountains of Hengzhou. Emperor Xuanzong sent an imperial edict to welcome him, and he arrived shortly after, being installed in the Academy of Scholarly Worthies. When questioned about the immortals, he remained silent, though his divine arts were tested repeatedly without end.\n\n**Perfected of the Western Marchmount**\nThe Perfected of the Western Marchmount, surnamed Feng and named Chang, was a native of Mount Li. During the reign of King Xuan of Zhou, he served as *zhuxiashi* (archivist). Witnessing celestial omens, he retired to cultivate longevity. He encountered Perfected Deng, who transmitted to him sacred scriptures. As his merit and practice neared completion, he met Perfected Peng, who bestowed upon him the *Hidden Writ of the Supreme*. Thereupon, he attained transcendence and used his arts to save lives. In the twentieth year of King Ping’s reign, he ascended and departed.\n\n**Perfected of Great Simplicity**\nThe Perfected of Great Simplicity, surnamed Zhou and named Liang, styled Taizhen, was a native of Taiyuan. His mother, while resting one night, saw five-colored radiant clouds covering her home and conceived. After fifteen months, she gave birth. In his youth, he studied under Yao Tan, who transmitted to him the *Five Thousand Character Writ* and the *Eightfold Scripture of True Simplicity*. He could subdue malevolent spirits, restoring them to their true forms. Crown Prince Jin of King Ling of Zhou heard of him and summoned him for an audience, bestowing upon him the *Ninefold Radiance and Sevenfold Brilliance Mushroom*. Liang ingested it and gained the power of transformation: at times, he would appear as a seventy-year-old with white hair and fallen teeth, yet after a night’s seclusion, he would reemerge as a youth with a visage like blossoms. If ever insulted by ruffians, the offenders would unknowingly bind themselves, suffering blows and cries until their mouths bled, only to be released upon begging for mercy. At over one hundred ninety years of age, in the fourteenth year of King Weilie’s reign, the Celestial Emperor dispatched heavenly officials to welcome him, appointing him Perfected of Qin and Long and granting him entry into the Great Purity.\n\n**Perfected Sa**\nPerfected Sa, named Shoujian, was a native of Xihe in Shu. He once studied medicine but, having mistakenly killed a patient with his prescriptions, abandoned the profession. Hearing of the lofty arts of Celestial Master Zhang Xujing, Wang Shichen of Jianchang, and Lin Lingsu of Fuzhou, he traveled to study under them. Arriving in Shu, his provisions were exhausted, and he sat upon a rock, deeply troubled. Suddenly, three Daoist adepts appeared. The Perfected asked how far it was to Xinzhou. The adepts inquired about his purpose. He replied, “I wish to seek Celestial Master Xujing to study the Dao.” The adepts said, “The Celestial Master has passed away.” He then asked about Wang Shichen, and they replied, “He too has passed.” He asked about Lin Lingsu, and they said, “He also has died.” The Perfected grew despondent, whereupon one adept said, “Though the Celestial Master is gone, his arts remain profound. I am acquainted with him and shall write a letter on your behalf. You may go to seek him. I will also teach you a method to sustain yourself daily.” He then transmitted the art of sucking jujubes: each jujube sucked would yield seven *wen*, and by sucking ten a day, he could earn seventy *wen*—enough for a day’s livelihood. Another adept said, “I too have a method to teach you,” and gave him a palm-leaf fan, saying, “Wave this over the sick, and they will recover.” The third adept said, “I also have a method to teach you,” and transmitted the arts of thunder. The Perfected received these teachings and departed. All proved efficacious when put into practice.\n\nOne day, he sucked over a hundred jujubes but accepted only seventy *wen* for daily expenses, using the remainder to relieve the poor.\n\nUpon arriving in Xinzhou to meet the Celestial Master and presenting the letter, the entire household wept, for it was in the hand of the Vacuously Tranquil Celestial Master. The letter stated, “I have encountered Adept Sa along with Attendant Wang Shen and Celestial Master Lin, each of whom transmitted a method to him. He may be recorded as a Perfected One for memorial submission; later, his arts will grow ever more illustrious.”\n\nOnce, passing through Tanzhou, people heard a divine voice proclaim, “The Perfected One, Commissioner of Penal Affairs, arrives tomorrow.” The next day, the people gathered and saw only the Perfected One approaching with a bamboo hat and jar, bearing a placard inscribed *Commissioner of Penal Affairs*—they marveled at the sight.\n\nProceeding to the Floating Bridge in Xiangyin County, he saw locals sacrificing boys and girls to the local temple deity. The Perfected One said, “Such licentious spirits deserve to have their temple burned.” As soon as he spoke, thunder and fire descended from the sky, and the temple was instantly consumed.\n\nWhen the Perfected One reached the riverbank in Longxing Prefecture to wash his feet, he saw the reflection of a deity in the water—square-faced, wearing a yellow kerchief and golden armor, his left hand grasping his sleeve and his right hand holding a whip. The Perfected One asked, “What spirit are you?” The reply came, “I am Wang Shan, the deity of the Xiangyin temple. After you burned my temple, I have followed you for twelve years, awaiting an opportunity to avenge myself. Now that your merit and conduct are lofty and your office is under the Celestial Pivot, I beseech you to memorialize and appoint me as a subordinate general.” The Perfected One said, “You are a malevolent spirit; if I seat you within my arts, you will surely harm them.” The temple deity immediately swore an oath never to betray the covenant, whereupon the Perfected One memorialized the Emperor and conferred upon him an official post.\n\nArriving in Zhangzhou, one day all the generals manifested their forms and surrounded him in attendance. A celestial edict summoned the Perfected One to assume the position of Lord of the Celestial Pivot. The Perfected One then rose and immediately transformed.\n\n**Perfected One of Shouchun**\nThe Perfected One’s surname was Mei, given name Fu, courtesy name Zizhen, a native of Shouchun. He served the Han as Magistrate of Nanchang but, seeing Wang Mang usurp power, abandoned his family to seek immortality. He wandered through the mountains of southern Min and Fujian, later entering Xianxia Mountain, where he encountered the Immortal Lord of Kongtong, who transmitted to him the arts of inner and outer elixirs.\n\nEntering Jilong Mountain, his cultivation remained unfulfilled, so he proceeded to the western ridge of the Jian River. There he again encountered the Immortal Lord of Kongtong, who addressed Fu: \"Your destiny lies upon Feihong Mountain.\" Fu then journeyed to Feihong Mountain, where he built a thatched hut to refine his elixir. Once the cinnabar was complete, he hastened to pack and returned to Shouchun. One day, purple clouds drifted across the sky amid swirling immortal music, and golden lads and jade maidens descended bearing an edict, riding phoenixes from the heavens. Fu received the edict, bid farewell to his family, and ascended on a blue phoenix. During the Yuanfeng era of the Song, he was enfeoffed as the Perfected One of Shouchun. His temple now stands outside Jubao Gate in Jinling, renowned for its divine efficacy and marvels, commonly called the Temple of General Mei.\n\n**Master of the Alchemy Satchel**\nThe Master of the Alchemy Satchel spoke with an accent reminiscent of the Yan and Dai regions. Whenever he polished mirrors, he would ask the owner if they suffered any ailments; if so, he would produce purple pills and red medicines for them, and all were cured. During a great epidemic, he distributed medicine to households, healing tens of thousands without accepting a single coin. Later, he dwelled upon the sheer cliffs of Mount Wu, where he perpetually dispensed medicine to people. He declared, \"I wish to return to Penglai Mountain to bring down divine water for you all.\" One day, milky water flowed from the stone cliff, and many who drank it were healed. The villagers then erected a shrine to worship him.\n\n**Divine Lülü**\n\nThe shrine stands five *li* north of Hunyuan Prefecture in Datong Prefecture, atop Fox Stone by the Divine Stream, first constructed during the Northern Wei and later restored under the Yuan. According to legend, in the sixth month of the first year of the Tai Chu era, a man from Hongzhou named Zhang Gui rested at dusk upon Fox Stone when suddenly a divine figure—elegant, radiant, and untouched by worldly dust—descended from the heavens. Gazing at Gui, the spirit intoned, *\"Lülü, lülü, Heaven commands you: on the twentieth day of this month, a violent storm shall strike.\"* With these words, the figure ascended into the sky. Gui grasped the warning and returned home to urge his neighbors to hasten the wheat harvest. Those who failed to gather their crops by the appointed day saw them ruined by the deluge. The matter reached the imperial court, and envoys were dispatched to offer sacrifices.\n\nMaster Liu, compiler of *A Comprehensive Record of the Universe*, bore the surname Liu and the courtesy name Mohe. Profoundly versed in the scriptures and precepts, he delved deeply into the essence of meditation, and his divinations of fortune and misfortune never failed to prove true. During the reign of Juqu Mengxun, he sought immortality and studied the Dao, eventually settling in a small thatched hut south of Suzhou’s garrison. There, he joined his palms in reverence, took refuge in the Three Jewels, and entered *nirvana*. His disciples cremated his remains, whereupon his bones transformed into pearls and his blood into cinnabar. A shrine was erected at the site of his passing. It is said that those who pray there often receive pearls and elixirs. Since then, supplicants have found that fires are extinguished when invoked, rains pour forth when beseeched, and illnesses are cured when entreated—so much so that devotees from near and far vie to honor him.\n\n*Concluding the second scroll of* **Records of Divine Marvels** *#1*\n*(Note: \"Second scroll\" added per stylistic convention.)*\n\n**Records of Divine Marvels, Third Scroll #1**\n\n**Catalogue**\nGuanyin (Avalokiteśvara)　　　　Heavenly Kings　　　　Kṣitigarbha (Earth Treasury)\nVajra Warriors　　　　　Ten Great Wisdom Kings　　Ten Lords of the Ten Courts of Hell\nEighteen Arhats　　　　　Baozhi the Venerable　　　Sixth Patriarch Lu\nBodhidharma　　　　　　Pu’an　　　　　　　　　　Sizhou Great Sage\nFu Dashi　　　　　　　　Erlang Shen　　　　　　　Master Xiao\nMaster Yan　　　　　　　Third Attendant of the Zong Clan　　General Yang the Fourth\nWater Palace Deities　　　Patrolling River Gods　　　　Lord of Dongting\nLord of the Xiang　　　　　Grandmother of Chaohu　　　　God of Gongting Lake\nSea Gods, Tide Gods, Water Gods, Admonishing Gods, and Spring Gods—all affiliated with the God of Mount Lu\nGod of Su Ridge　　　　　God of Silla Mountain　　　　God of Shemu Mountain\n\n**Guanyin**\nBorn on the nineteenth day of the second lunar month.\nIn ancient times, there was a king named Miaozhuang. He had three daughters: the eldest, Miaoyin; the second, Miaolü; and the youngest, Miaoshan, who was the bodhisattva herself.\nThe king ordered her to marry, but she refused and was banished to the rear garden, where she resided at White Sparrow Temple. The nuns there burdened her with hauling tea and water, but ghostly attendants did the labor in her stead.\nEnraged, the king commanded the temple be burned. Though the nuns perished in the flames, the bodhisattva remained unharmed, as if untouched.\nHe then ordered her execution, but the blade shattered thrice.\nWhen he commanded her strangulation with a white silk sash, suddenly a black mist shrouded the sky, and a white tiger bore her away to the Forest of Corpses.\nA youth in blue robes stood in attendance. She traversed the underworld, crossed the Bridge of Helplessness, and rescued the suffering. Reviving, she returned to the Forest of Corpses.\nThe Star Lord of Venus, disguised as an old man, directed her to cultivate on Fragrant Mountain.\nLater, King Miaozhuang fell gravely ill. Miaoshan gouged out her eyes and severed her arms to save him. When the king went to pay homage, she attained enlightenment. In the void appeared the wondrous form of the Thousand-Armed, Thousand-Eyed Guanyin, the Miraculous Bodhisattva, who thereafter manifested eternally on Fragrant Mountain.\n\n**Heavenly Kings**\nAccording to *The Origins of the Śākya Clan*, there are Virūḍhaka, Virūpākṣa, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, and Vaiśravaṇa, the Heavenly Kings.\nDuring the Tang, when Emperor Taizong followed his father Gaozu in raising an army, a deity descended before them, declaring himself Vaiśravaṇa and vowing to aid in quelling the rebellion. His general bore a banner with an elephant’s trunk, and wherever they turned, they triumphed.\nAfter ascending the throne, the emperor decreed that all public offices in the realm worship him. In the early Tiansheng era, he commanded every prefecture to establish shrines and build Buddhist temples, all bearing the name \"Heavenly King.\" Thus did the veneration of the Heavenly Kings spread widely.\n\n**Kṣitigarbha**\nBorn on the thirtieth day of the seventh lunar month.\nHe presides over the netherworld, governs the Ten Stages, and receives the obeisance of the Lords of Hell in ceremonial audience.\nIt is said that in the city of Rājagṛha, he transmitted the Dharma to a disciple named Maudgalyāyana, who once studied under the Tathāgata. To rescue his mother from the realm of hungry ghosts, he held the Ullambana Assembly. After his death, he became Kṣitigarbha.\nThe thirtieth day of the seventh month is celebrated as his birthday, and scholars pay him homage.\nSome say that the Kṣitigarbha of Jiuhua Mountain in Qingyang is he.\nAccording to tradition, a monk from Silla crossed the sea during the Tang and dwelled on Jiuhua Mountain. At ninety-nine, he suddenly summoned his disciples to bid them farewell. The mountains rumbled and rocks fell, and soon he sat cross-legged in his coffin. Three years later, when the coffin was opened for interment, his countenance appeared as in life. When lifted, his joints moved like golden chains. Thus he was called \"Golden Kṣitigarbha,\" revealing the errors in the earlier account.\n\n**Vajra Warriors**\nThey are the Vajra *guhyapāda*.\n\nAccording to the *Samādhi Sūtra*, when the Tathāgata arrived in Nāgārhāra to subdue the five rākṣasa demons, the Vajra deities wielded great clubs, flames bursting from their tips to burn the evil dragons. The dragon kings, seized with terror, fled into the Buddha’s shadow. Another time, they brandished mighty swords at the foreheads of demon kings, who, trembling in fear, clutched their children and knelt before the Buddha. They also once petitioned the Buddha to bestow alms upon the host of hungry ghosts.\n\nWhen the World-Honored One entered nirvāṇa, the Vajra deities, overcome with grief and despair, lamented: “The Tathāgata has abandoned us to enter quiescence. From this day forth, we are without refuge, without shelter, without protection. A single reversal has brought calamity crashing down, and the poisoned arrows of sorrow pierce our hearts. For whom shall we now wield these Vajra clubs? We cast them aside—whom shall we serve hereafter?” Thus they spoke, their longing for the Tathāgata manifesting in myriad forms. Such are the transformations of the Vajra deities.\n\n**The Ten Great Wisdom Kings**\n1. Yamāntaka, the Great Wrathful Wisdom King of Flames\n2. Trailokyavijaya, the Great Wrathful Wisdom King of Invincibility\n3. Pāṇḍaravāsin, the Great Wrathful Wisdom King\n4. Vajrahūṃkāra, the Great Wrathful Wisdom King\n5. Acala, the Great Wrathful Wisdom King of Immovability\n6. Ucchuṣma, the Great Wrathful Wisdom King\n7. Kundali, the Wrathful Wisdom King\n8. Mahābala, the Great Wrathful Wisdom King of Mighty Strength\n9. Sumbha, the Great Wrathful Wisdom King\n10. Cundī, the Great Wrathful Wisdom King\n\nThese ten great wrathful wisdom kings each possess three faces, with three eyes on each face. All bear the Buddha atop their heads, wear tiger skins as garments, and crown themselves with skulls. Their hair stands erect in topknots.\n\n**The Ten Lords of the Earthly Courts**\n1. The First Court: Lord Qin Guang, King Yama of the First Hall.\n\n**The Ten Lords of the Earthly Courts**\n2. The Second Court: Lord Chu Jiang, King Cao of the Second Hall.\n3. The Third Court: Lord Song Di, King Lian of the Third Hall.\n4. The Fourth Court: Lord Wu Guan, King Huang of the Fourth Hall.\n5. The Fifth Court: Lord Yanluo, King Han of the Fifth Hall.\n6. The Sixth Court: Lord Bian Cheng, King Shi of the Sixth Hall.\n7. The Seventh Court: Lord Tai Shan, King Bi of the Seventh Hall.\n8. The Eighth Court: Lord Ping Deng, Prince Zi of the Eighth Hall.\n9. The Ninth Court: Lord Du Shi, King Xue of the Ninth Hall.\n10. The Tenth Court: Lord Zhuan Lun, King Xue of the Tenth Hall.\n\n**The Eighteen Venerable Arhats**\n1. The First Venerable Arhat, Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja.\n2. The Second Venerable Arhat, Kanaka the Vatsa.\n3. The Third Venerable Arhat, Kanaka the Pūrṇa.\n4. The Fourth Venerable Arhat, Subinda.\n5. The Fifth Venerable Arhat, Nakula.\n6. The Sixth Venerable Arhat, Bodhidharma.\n7. The Seventh Venerable Arhat, Kālika.\n8. The Eighth Venerable Arhat, Vajraputra.\n9. The Tenth Venerable Arhat, Pantha the Elder.\n10.

The Fifteenth Venerable Arhat, Ajita.\n15. The Sixteenth Venerable Arhat, Cūḍapanthaka.\n16. The Seventeenth Venerable Arhat, Kundadhāna.\n17. The Eighteenth Venerable Arhat, Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja.\n\n**Chan Master Baozhi**\nChan Master Baozhi appeared in the form of a child in an eagle’s nest atop an ancient tree in Dongyang Town during the Yuanjia era of the Liu-Song dynasty. The Zhu family heard a child’s cries from the nest and took him in, raising him as their own. They thus gave him the surname Zhu and donated their residence to be made into a temple.\n\nFrom a young age, the Master left home and took refuge at Daolin Temple on Mount Zhong. He always carried a tin staff hung with a knife, ruler, mirror, whisk, and the like, or a strip of cloth a foot or two long. He would go days without eating yet showed no signs of hunger. At times, he would sing songs, their words often bearing prophetic omens. Both scholars and commoners revered him.\n\nDuring the Jianyuan era of the Qi dynasty, Emperor Wu accused the Master of misleading the masses and imprisoned him in the capital’s jail. The next morning, people saw him in the marketplace, yet when the prison was inspected, he was found inside as before. The Prefect of Jiankang reported the matter to the Emperor, who summoned the Master to the rear hall of the palace. While the Master was in Hualin Garden, he suddenly donned three layers of cloth hats, though no one knew where he had obtained them.\n\nSoon after, Prince Yu of Yuzhang and Crown Prince Wenhui passed away in succession, and the Qi dynasty held the Master in even higher regard. From then on, his comings and goings were restricted.\n\nWhen Emperor Gaozu of Liang ascended the throne, he issued an edict: *\"Master Zhi has long been confined by worldly dust, yet his spirit roams the unseen. Neither water nor fire can drown or burn him; neither snakes nor tigers can harm or frighten him. In expounding the Buddha’s teachings, he surpasses even the Śrāvakas; in discussing the hidden and profound, he outshines even the immortals. How foolish it is to bind such a one with the common constraints of ordinary men! From this day forth, let him no longer be restricted.\"*\n\nOne day, the Master dined with the Emperor on stewed fish. The Emperor remarked, *\"I have known this flavor for over twenty years—why do you partake of it now?\"* The Master then spat out a small fish, its scales and tail still intact. To this day, the remnants of that fish remain in Jiankang.\n\nWhen Empress Dou passed away, the Emperor mourned her for months, grieving by day and unable to sleep by night. One evening, he heard a commotion outside his bedchamber and saw a python coiled around a pillar, its eyes glaring and jaws agape as it faced him. Terrified, the Emperor had nowhere to flee. Forced to rise, he addressed the serpent: *\"This palace is heavily guarded—how could a creature like you be born here? You must be a demon seeking to harm me!\"*\n\nThe python spoke in human words: *\"I am the late Empress Dou. In life, I was jealous of the six palaces, my nature cruel and venomous. If I bore even the slightest grudge, I would set fires or loose arrows, harming people and causing deaths. For these sins, I have been reborn as a python. I have no food to fill my mouth, no den to shelter my body, and hunger and exhaustion overwhelm me. Moreover, my scales are infested with worms that gnaw my flesh, the pain as sharp as knives piercing me. Though I am no ordinary serpent, I have transformed and come here, undeterred by the grandeur of the imperial residence. Moved by Your Majesty’s past affection, I have taken this hideous form to reveal myself and beg for a single act of merit to deliver me.\"*\n\nThe Emperor was deeply moved. He searched for the python but found it gone. The next day, he summoned eminent monks to the palace hall, recounted the event, and asked for the most efficacious means to redeem her. The Master replied, *\"Only through repentance rites and sincere confession before the Buddha can this be achieved.\"*\n\nThe Emperor heeded his words, poring over Buddhist scriptures to compile the names of the Buddhas. He also personally composed a repentance text with his sagely brush, resulting in ten volumes. These works gathered and refined the Buddha’s words, omitting extraneous phrases, to form the repentance liturgy.\n\nOne day, an extraordinary fragrance filled the palace, growing ever more exquisite. Unsure of its origin, the Emperor looked up and saw a heavenly being of dignified and radiant appearance. The being addressed him: *\"This is the Empress in her new form. Through Your Majesty’s merit, she has been reborn in the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven. I now reveal her true self as proof.\"* She expressed her gratitude and departed. This account appears in the preface to Emperor Wu of Liang’s repentance text.\n\nIn the winter of the thirteenth year of the Tianjian era of the Liang dynasty, the Master announced his impending passing to the assembly of monks, instructing them to move the temple’s Vajra deity statue outside. He then whispered to a disciple, *\"The Bodhisattva is about to depart.\"* Within ten days, he passed away without illness, his body exuding fragrance as it transformed. He had lived for ninety-seven years.\n\nThe Emperor spent twenty thousand coins to purchase the solitary hill of Dulongfu before Dinglin Temple for the Master’s burial. Princess Yongding donated her bathing funds to construct a seven-story pagoda atop the hill. The Emperor commissioned Lu Chui to compose an inscription and bestowed glass and pearls to adorn the pagoda’s exterior.\n\nIn the seventh year of the Baoda era of the Southern Tang, he was given the posthumous title *\"Wonderfully Awakened.\"* The pagoda was named *\"Responding to the World.\"* In the seventh year of the Taiping Xingguo era of the Song dynasty, a man named Ke E from Shu encountered an old monk on Wansui Mountain, who pointed to an ancient pine and said, *\"Dig here.\"* They unearthed a stone tablet inscribed with *The Record of Master Bao*, a text foretelling the enduring fortune of the imperial lineage.\n\nThus, envoys were dispatched to express gratitude, and he was posthumously titled *\"Master Bao the Wonderfully Awakened.\"* In the early years of the Zhiping era, his title was further elevated to *\"Great Master Daolin the Truly Awakened.\"*\n\nAccording to *The Precious Record of Jiankang*, the Kai Shan Temple once housed the sandals of Master Zhi. During the early Shenlong era of the Tang, Zheng Kejun took them back to Chang’an. The present-day *Washing Alms-Bowl Pool* still exists, and the square pond two *li* west of the pagoda marks the former site of Fayun Temple.\n\n**Sixth Patriarch Lu**\nThe Sixth Patriarch Lu, named Neng, was a native of Xinzhou in Guangdong. During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang, drawn by the fragrant waters of Caoxi, he sought a site for a Daoist sanctuary. Approaching the landowner, he said, *\"I require only enough space to lay my kasaya.\"* The landowner consented. Lu spread his robe, which covered eighty *li* in circumference—the present-day Nanhua Mountain, the sanctuary of the Sixth Patriarch. His corporeal remains endure, his face darkened by incense smoke like lacquer.\n\nIn the *bingzi* year of the Yuan dynasty, Han soldiers pierced his abdomen with a blade, only to find his organs as fresh as those of a living man. Dismayed, they dared not desecrate him further. His robes and alms-bowl were carried away, including a kasaya bestowed by Emperor Xuanzong, woven with faint mountain-water patterns; a Western Heaven alms-bowl, neither bronze nor iron, wood nor stone; Western Heaven sandals, neither leather nor wood; sixteen or seventeen leaves of *The Flower Garland Sutra*; and a Buddha’s tooth, encased in a silver-inlaid casket.\n\nOnce, a malevolent dragon dwelled in a deep pool, afflicting the people. The Sixth Patriarch said, *\"I fear only that you will shrink.\"* The dragon shrank, and he captured it in his alms-bowl. Confined to the temple, the dragon withered and submitted.\n\n**Bodhidharma, the Twenty-Eighth Patriarch**\nBodhidharma, the Twenty-Eighth Patriarch, was born on the fifth day of the tenth month. He crossed the sea from India to the Liang court but found no affinity with the Emperor. Secretly ascending Mount Song, he faced the wall of Shaolin Temple for nine years before passing away in perfect repose. He was interred on Mount Xiong’er.\n\nDuring the Wei dynasty, Song Yun, returning from a mission to the Western Regions, encountered Bodhidharma on the Lion-Elephant Ridge in Congling. The Patriarch carried a single sandal, walking lightly away. When asked where he was bound, he replied, *\"To the Western Heaven.\"* He added, *\"Your king has departed this world.\"* Bewildered, Song Yun took his leave and returned east. Upon reporting to the court, he learned that Emperor Ming had already passed. Under Emperor Xiaozhuang’s reign, Song Yun recounted the encounter. The tomb was opened, revealing only an empty coffin and a single leather sandal.\n\n**Chan Master Pu’an**\nChan Master Pu’an, named Yin, was born to the Yu family of Yichun County in Yuan Prefecture during the fifth year of the Zhenghe era of Emperor Huizong of the Song, at the hour of *chen* on the twenty-seventh day of the eleventh month. At age six, he dreamed of a monk touching his heart and saying, *\"You will one day awaken on your own.\"* Upon waking, he told his mother, who saw a radiant red dot on his chest, as bright as a cherry.\n\nHis parents thus permitted him to leave home under the guidance of Venerable Xian of Shoulong Monastery. At twenty-seven, he took the tonsure, and the following year, he received the precepts. The Master’s appearance was imposing, his wisdom keen. Venerable Xian esteemed him and urged him to recite sutras. The Master replied, *\"I have heard that the essence of the Buddha and Patriarchs lies in awakening the heart. Mere recitation of words brings no benefit.\"* He then took leave of his teacher and traveled to Hunan and Hubei, seeking out Master Mu’an Zhong.\n\nWhen asked, *\"The myriad dharmas return to the One—where does the One return?\"* Master Zhong raised his fist. Pu’an was instantly enlightened. Later, he returned to his monastery.\n\nIn the *guiyou* year, the neighboring Cihua Monastery, lacking a permanent abbot, invited him to take residence. The temple had no endowment. The Master wore paper robes, ate morning gruel and evening rice, and aside from meditation, devoted himself solely to studying *The Flower Garland Sutra*. One day, he experienced a great awakening, his body drenched in sweat. Overjoyed, he exclaimed, *\"Today, I have truly entered the realm of *The Flower Garland!*\"* He then composed a verse:\n\n*\"Neither gathered nor scattered,\nWhy seek Southern Peak or Tiantai?\nAt the gates of the six senses, none arrive—\nYet a foreign monk comes uninvited.\"*\n\nOne day, a monk named Dao Cun arrived through the snow. The Master, upon seeing him, rejoiced, *\"This is my uninvited friend!\"* They sat in silent communion, exchanging questions and answers. Later, the Master retreated to Nanling, adopting the name *\"Pu’an.\"*\n\nHe later raised funds to rebuild Cihua Monastery. Many, drawn by his virtue, sought his teachings. He instructed them as circumstances allowed, sometimes writing verses for them. For the sick, he fashioned medicine from grass; for those afflicted by plague, where none dared approach, he offered verses. All were healed completely. His miracles extended to summoning rain, dispelling demons, and demolishing illicit shrines—his responses were manifold.\n\nAs a result, construction flourished. The wealthy donated wealth, the poor offered labor, and the skilled contributed craftsmanship. The temple was renovated, and for thousands of *li*, roads were cleared and bridges built—all rejoiced in virtuous deeds, transformed by the Master’s influence.\n\nOne day, he took up his brush and wrote a verse on the western wall of his chamber:\n\n*\"Now rain, now shine—the jeweled elephant gleams,\nEast and west, north and south—thick clouds swirl.\nCountless souls lose their pearl and suffer calamity;\nIllusory responses, expedient means—cleansed for you.\"*\n\nHaving written this, he addressed the assembly: *\"The Buddhas neither appear in the world nor enter nirvana. Those who enter my room must attain the original union. Guard this well, lest you regress.\"* He then donned his robe, sat cross-legged, and entered tranquility on the twenty-first day of the seventh month in the fifth year of the Qiandao era.\n\nHe was posthumously honored as *\"Chan Master Pu’an Jigan Miaoji Zhenjue Zhaoji.\"*\n\n**The Great Sage of Sizhou**\nThe Great Master Sengqie of Sizhou arrived in Chang’an and Luoyang during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Tang, traveling through Wu and Chu. Holding a willow branch, he blended with the monastic community. When asked his surname, he replied, *\"What surname?\"* When asked his homeland, he said, *\"What country?\"*\n\nLater, on the banks of the Si River, he sought to build a monastery. Staying at the home of a local named He Ba in Suzhou, he declared, *\"This was once a Buddhist site.\"* They dug and uncovered an ancient tablet, revealing that Xiangji Temple had been founded by the Qi-dynasty monk Jinlong. They also unearthed a golden statue, which the people identified as Dipankara Buddha.\n\nThe Master said, *\"This is Universal Radiance King Buddha.\"* Thus, they took this as the temple’s name. In the second year of Jinglong, Emperor Zhongzong dispatched envoys to welcome the Great Master to the capital, where he was received with profound reverence and commanded to reside at Great Merit-Fostering Monastery. On the third day of the third month, the Great Master demonstrated his passing. An imperial decree ordered his lacquered body to be enshrined in a stupa at Merit-Fostering Monastery, but suddenly a foul odor filled the city. The emperor prayed and sent the Master back to Linhuai, whereupon, as soon as the words were spoken, an extraordinary fragrance arose. The emperor asked Fang Hui, *\"Who is this Great Master Sengqie?\"* Fang Hui replied, *\"He is an emanation of Avalokiteśvara.\"* During the Qianfu era, he was posthumously honored as *\"Great Master Zhengsheng.\"*\n\n**Venerable Fu**\nVenerable Fu, whose given name was Xi, was a native of Yiwu in Wuzhou. From childhood, he was wise and discerning, versed in the books of the Three Teachings, and styled himself *\"Good Wisdom Bodhisattva.\"* In the first year of Liang Dynasty’s Datong era, he encountered the Indian monk Senggutuo, who said to him, *\"You are an emanation of Maitreya.\"* Thereupon, he was instructed to gaze into the water, where he saw a haloed aureole, and thus awakened to his past causes. When he asked where to cultivate the Dao, Senggutuo pointed to a pair of *shuangtao* trees beneath Song Mountain, saying, *\"This will suffice.\"* The Venerable established a hermitage there, and in the third year of Datong, a temple was founded—this is the present-day Shuanglin Monastery. Among its treasures were a *Lotus Sutra* bestowed by Emperor Wu of Liang, an iron plow, a cake-shaped alms bowl, crystal prayer beads, and a bronze crown of the Seven Buddhas, all of which remain extant.\n\nInitially, the Venerable’s path was arduous; though not of the monastic order, he did not shave his head, and the world regarded him as a foreknower and forewakened one, exempt from the tonsure and robes of a śramaṇa. At the time, there was a place called Yuhu Rock twenty-five *li* south of Yiwu, also known as Huangshan Peak, where fierce beasts preyed upon the villagers. After his meals, the Venerable would take his leftover rice to feed them, and from then on, the tigers and beasts hid away. He also transformed stones into a lustrous blue-purple hue, radiant and lovely, suitable for carving into prayer beads. A man of the Tao family, who had long supported the Venerable, was told by him as he pointed to a stone, *\"This stone, blue-purple, can be carved into prayer beads.\"* He further admonished, *\"Let your descendants pass down this craft—only your family can do this. Others who imitate it will find the stones shatter.\"* Later, Loyal and Offering King went to Wuzhou to open the Venerable’s stupa and retrieve his relics, intending to take them to Pilong Mountain. When they proved immovable, a Dragon Flower Monastery was built on that very spot, and the relics were used to mold an image of the Venerable within the stupa.\n\n*The Unified Gazetteer* records that Venerable Fu’s tomb lies among the stones of Yunhuang Mountain. In the early Kaiyun era of the Jin, Qian Yuanzuo of Wuyue sent envoys to retrieve his remains for reburial in Qiantang. When the tomb was opened, two tigers roared atop the walls. That night, a great storm of thunder and lightning shook the valleys. As the procession departed, the tigers followed, but when they reached the Xiaozhu River, the waters blocked their path, and they returned.\n\n**Erlang Shen, Born on the Twenty-Sixth Day of the Sixth Month**\nErlang Shen, surnamed Zhao and named Yu, studied under the Daoist Li Jue on Mount Qingcheng. Emperor Yang of Sui, recognizing his worth, appointed him Prefect of Jiazhou. To the left of the prefecture lay the Lingyuan and Er Rivers, where an ancient flood dragon wrought havoc, drowning and harming the people whenever the waters rose in spring and summer. Enraged, Zhao Yu prepared boats and led stalwart men and villagers to drum and shout along the riverbanks. Brandishing his blade, he plunged into the water. After a while, the river turned crimson, and the cliffs rumbled like thunder. Zhao Yu emerged from the waves, his right hand gripping the blade and his left holding the dragon’s head. Seven who had accompanied him into the water became the Seven Sages. When the world fell into chaos at the end of the Sui, he abandoned his post and vanished, his whereabouts unknown.\n\nLater, when the Jiang River overflowed, the people of Shu saw Zhao Yu amidst the blue mist. Grateful for his virtue, they built a temple at the mouth of the Guan River to worship him. Emperor Taizong of Tang enfeoffed him as *\"Divine Uncle, Great General.\"* Emperor Ming of Tang further honored him as *\"King of Red City,\"* and Emperor Zhenzong of Song bestowed the title *\"Perfected Lord of Pure Source and Wondrous Dao.\"*\n\n**Lord Xiao**\nLord Xiao, whose given name was Boxuan, had bushy brows, dragon-like whiskers, a fine beard, and a face as youthful as a child’s. He was upright and self-disciplined, his words and laughter never frivolous. He loved good and hated evil, and the villagers often sought his judgment to settle disputes. He passed away during the Xianchun era of the Song and became a deity, possessing a child to foretell fortune and misfortune with uncanny precision. The villagers built a temple for him on Taiyang Isle in Xin’gan County, where he bestowed blessings upon the region. During the Yuan, his son Xiangshu, who had also demonstrated divine efficacy after death, was jointly worshipped in the temple.\n\nIn the early Hongwu era of the present dynasty, officials were dispatched to offer sacrifices. In the seventeenth year of Yongle, his grandson Tianren passed away and repeatedly manifested numinous signs, so he too was enshrined there. By imperial decree, he was enfeoffed as *\"Heroic Protector of the Water Palace, Spiritually Penetrating, Vastly Beneficent, Manifestly Responsive, and Mighty in Might, whose awe-inspiring power extends over the Nine Rivers and the confluence of the Yellow River.\"*\n\n**Lord Yan**\nLord Yan, surnamed Yan and named Shouzai, was a native of Qingjiang Town in Linjiang Prefecture. He had thick brows, a black beard, and a face like lacquer. He detested evil as if it were boiling water, and if anyone acted improperly, he would say, *\"Does Lord Yan not know?\"* Thus, people held him in great reverence and fear. At the beginning of the Yuan, he was selected for office based on his talents and served as the director of the Brocade Bureau. Falling ill, he returned home by boat and suddenly passed away. His attendants prepared his funeral rites as usual. Before reaching home, his family saw him leading a procession through the wilderness, dressed in his usual robes and cap, and they marveled at this. A month later, when his body arrived, they were both astonished and bewildered. Upon opening the coffin, they found it empty—it was a case of *shijie* (liberation by means of a simulated corpse). The elders, knowing he had become a deity, built a temple to worship him, and he manifested his efficacy on rivers and lakes. By imperial decree of the present dynasty, he was enfeoffed as *\"Marquis Pacifier of Waves.\"*\n\n**Three Water Palaces of the Yangzi River**\nAccording to *The History of the Five Dynasties*, when the Yang clan controlled the Jiang region, they enfeoffed Madang as the Upper Water Palace, with its temple on the southern slope of the mountain. Caishi was the Middle Water Palace, its temple at the foot of Caishi Mountain, enfeoffed as a king. The Song further honored it as *\"Manifestly Numinous, Sagely, Loyal, and Assisting Pacifier of the Jiang King.\"* Jinshan was the Lower Water Palace, its temple within Jinshan Monastery. In the present dynasty, all three temples are revered as deities of the Water Palace. On the waters of the Yangzi, a single call brings an immediate response, and boatmen passing by always prepare sacrificial animals and silk to pray. Today, officials offer seasonal sacrifices.\n\n**Patrolling Deities of the Yangzi River**\n\nWhen Chen Yaozi moored his boat at Sanshan Shoal, an old man appeared and said: \"At noon tomorrow, a great wind will arise, and any boat that ventures forth will surely capsize—best to avoid it.\" The next day dawned clear, with not a single cloud in the boundless sky. The boatmen urged him to cast off, but Chen replied: \"Wait a while longer.\"\n\nAs soon as the other boats had departed from shore, black clouds suddenly surged from the northwest, and a violent gale struck. Trees snapped, sand flew, and towering waves raged like mountains. Most of the boats that had set out were lost.\n\nAstonished, Chen later encountered the same old man, who said: \"I am a patrolling deity of the Yangzi. Knowing that you are destined to become a grand councilor, I came to warn you.\"\n\nChen asked: \"How may I repay your kindness?\"\n\nThe old man replied: \"I seek no reward. Wherever a person of your stature travels, the dragon deities are duty-bound to protect you. But if you could provide me with a copy of the *Golden Light Sutra*, its power might help me advance in rank.\"\n\nChen agreed. Upon returning to the capital, he sent three copies of the *Golden Light Sutra* to be cast into the waters at Sanshan Shoal. The old man said: \"I asked for one, but you have given three—this will elevate my rank several times over.\" He bowed in gratitude and departed.\n\n**The Lord of Dongting**\n\nThe Lord of Dongting is the deity of Dongting Lake, with a temple at Longdui. According to tradition, there was a scholar named Liu Yi during the reign of Emperor Zhongzong of Tang. On his way home after failing the imperial examination in Jingyang, he encountered a woman herding sheep. She said to him: \"I am the youngest daughter of the Lord of Dongting. I was married to the second son of the Jing River Lord, but slandered by a maidservant and banished to this place. I humbly ask you to deliver a letter home for me.\" Liu declined, saying he did not know the way. The woman replied: \"On the northern shore of Dongting Lake stands a great tangerine tree. Strike it three times, and someone will respond.\"\n\nLiu followed her instructions. A warrior emerged, lifted the waters, and led him inside. Upon reaching the Palace of Spiritual Emptiness, Liu presented the letter. The Lord of Dongting wept and said: \"This is the fault of an old man, causing my young daughter to suffer such harm.\" Soon after, a red dragon flew away, and shortly thereafter, a figure surrounded by crimson mist returned—it was the woman who had entrusted him with the letter. Liu was feasted in the Azure Cloud Palace. The Lord’s elder brother, titled the Lord of Qiantang, said to Liu: \"The woman of Jingyang wishes to entrust herself to your noble virtue as a wife.\" Liu dared not accept and took his leave. Later, he married a woman of the Lu family, who was in fact the dragon maiden, and together they returned to Dongting.\n\nThe Lady of the Xiang\nAccording to the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*, the two daughters of the Emperor resided on Mount Dongting. When Emperor Shun died during his southern inspection and was buried in the wilds of Cangwu, his two consorts, unable to reach him in time, drowned in the waters between the Yuan and Xiang Rivers. The people built a temple for them, and they came to be known as the Ladies of the Xiang. Temples stand at the mouth of the lake and on Junshan Island. When the First Emperor of Qin traveled south and sailed the Yangzi, he encountered a great storm. Asking what deity the Lady of the Xiang was, his scholars replied: \"The daughter of Yao and consort of Shun.\" Enraged, the First Emperor ordered the mountain to be painted red—this is the place. Tang poet Han Yu composed a stele for her. Li Bai wrote:\n*\"The Emperor’s daughters left for Xiaoxiang, never to return,\nOnly autumn grasses remain between Dongting’s shores.\nThe clear lake opens like a jade mirror,\nAnd painted in ink is the isle of Junshan.\"*\nLiu Yuxi also wrote:\n*\"Lake light and autumn waters blend in harmony,\nThe deep pool, windless, gleams like a freshly polished mirror.\nGazing afar at Dongting’s emerald hills,\nA silver mound cradles a single green snail.\"*\n\nThe Grandmother of Chaohu\nAccording to the *Qingsuo Gaodie*, one day in ancient Chaohu, the river waters surged violently before returning to their original course. A giant fish weighing ten thousand *jin* was found in the channel, and it took three days to die. The entire prefecture ate its flesh, save for one elderly woman who, though kind-hearted, refused to partake. Suddenly, an old man appeared and said to her: \"This was my son, who met with this misfortune. Because you did not eat his flesh, I will richly reward you. The stone tortoise at the eastern gate has red eyes—a sign the city will sink. Go check it daily.\" A mischievous child deceived her by smearing the tortoise’s eyes with cinnabar. When the grandmother saw this, she fled in haste and climbed a mountain. The city sank and became a lake—Chaohu. Later, a temple was built on Gushan within the lake to worship the Grandmother. Those who sail the lake never fail to make offerings. Luo Yin’s poem contains the lines: *\"I ask about the city’s sinking long ago—how many thousands of years have passed since Qin and Han?\"*\n\nThe Deity of Guanting Lake\nThis deity has no recorded name but manifests at Guanting Lake in Nankang Prefecture. When the deity arrives, dark clouds obscure the sun, and the sound is tumultuous, like tides surging. The deity can split the wind, sending one current south and another north, so that boats above and below sail without hindrance. It can also cleave the waves as if holding a magical rhinoceros horn to enter the sea. The prefectural governor, respecting the deity’s power and fearing it might disrupt navigation, built a shrine by the lake and offered seasonal sacrifices. The deity responds to all invocations, and travelers near and far rely on its protection. Song poet Qin Guan once lodged at the Bamboo-Loving Pavilion by the lake. In a dream, the lake deity presented him with a poem:\n*\"Who knows the waters where winds part the night’s mooring,\nCompared to autumn slumber in the Bamboo-Loving Pavilion?\nI hear your writings are famed throughout the land—\nBefore Mount Lu’s face, even silence speaks volumes.\"*\n\nThe Nine Carp Lake Immortals\nThe He family’s origins are unknown, but nine brothers cultivated the Dao in the mountains northeast of Xianyou County, hence the name Nine Immortals Mountain. They also refined elixirs by the lake, and upon completion, each rode a red carp away, giving the lake its name, Nine Carp Lake. A temple stands by the lake, renowned for its efficacy. During the imperial examinations, scholars from the prefecture would pray for dreams here, trusting it as they would Cao or Cai. In our dynasty, Huang Mengliang, moved by their story, composed a poem to commemorate it:\n*\"Men ascended as immortals, carp transformed to dragons—\nWho built the immortal palace by the lake?\nStones bear traces of cinnabar in murmuring streams,\nClouds veil jade towers in misty heights.\nThe Azure Bird comes and goes beneath the moonlit night,\nPeach blossoms bloom and fall with the spring breeze.\nThis journey was not for dreaming of Deng,\nBut to meet the Stone Elder at the bridge.\"*\n\nThe Sea Deity\nThis is Hai Ruo. According to legend, the First Emperor of Qin built a stone bridge to cross the sea and observe the sunrise. The sea deity drove the stones into place. The First Emperor sought to meet the deity, who said: \"Do not depict my form.\" The First Emperor agreed, but upon seeing the deity, his clever attendants secretly sketched its likeness. Enraged, the deity said: \"You have broken your promise—depart at once!\" The temple now stands in Wendeng County.\n\nThe Tide Deity\nThis is Wu Zixu, seen riding the tide in a white carriage drawn by white horses.\n\nThe Water Deity\nThis refers to Yuqiang and the River Earl.\n\nThe Wave Deity\nThis refers to Chuanhou.\n\nMaster Kuangfu of Mount Lu\nThe master, surnamed Kuang, named Xu, styled Junping, was a native of southern Chu and called himself Master Kuangfu. Born with divine spirit, he harbored otherworldly aspirations even as a child. During the reign of King Wu of Zhou, he studied under Laozi and attained the Way of longevity. He built a thatched hut above Tiger Brook on the southern slope of Mount Lu and lived in seclusion. His dwelling held nothing but a bed and a few scrolls of texts. King Wu repeatedly summoned him, but he refused. Later, he met a youth who transmitted the secrets of immortality, and he achieved the Dao. Emperor Wu of Han, during his southern tour, ascended the Heavenly Pillar to offer sacrifices and once gazed in reverence toward the master. Later, when the emperor shot a dragon in the Xunyang River, he posthumously enfeoffed the master as the Duke of Southern Culmen and Great Brilliance, ordering a shrine built at his former hermitage by Tiger Brook. The prefect, Heng Yi, later relocated the shrine to the mountain’s entrance. For prayers regarding floods, droughts, or plagues, the responses were always efficacious.\n\nThe Deity of Suoling Mountain\nThe temple stands on Lumen Mountain southeast of Xiangyang Prefecture. According to records, Emperor Guangwu of Han visited Liqu, where he dreamed of a deity in white robes, feathered garments, a plain headscarf, and a black sash coming to pay respects.\n\nThe emperor asked, \"What deity are you?\" The deity replied, \"I am the Deity of Suoling Mountain.\" He then enumerated several matters before departing. At the time, Xi Yu was in attendance as Palace Attendant. The next day, the emperor recounted the dream to Yu, who had dreamed the same—every detail perfectly aligned. Later, Emperor Guangwu enfeoffed Yu as the Marquis of Xiangyang and ordered him to establish a shrine to the Suoling Mountain Deity, carving two stone deer to flank the spirit path before the temple. The people called it the Deer Gate Shrine, its numinous efficacy renowned. A poem by Meng Haoran of the Tang reads:\n\n*Gradually nearing Deer Gate Mountain,*\n*The peaks bright, emerald hues soft.*\n*Of old, I heard of Master Pang,*\n*Who gathered herbs and never returned.*\n*His hidden traces still remain,*\n*His lofty virtue distant, far.*\n\nThe Deity of Xinluo Mountain\nThe shrine stands in Tingzhou of Fu Prefecture. Tingzhou was originally Xinluo County of the Jin, and the name \"Ting\" first appeared in the Tang. According to the *Universal Geography*: In the late Kaiyuan era, Sun Fengxian, magistrate of Xinluo County, was seated in his office when he saw a deity who said, \"I am the Deity of Xinluo Mountain. I have come from the prefect to request an ox for food.\" Fengxian offered to substitute sheep and pigs instead, but the deity grew angry. Soon after, a great plague erupted, and Fengxian fell ill and died. Later, someone wrote a poem:\n\nThe sheer cliffs of Xinluo rise a hundred feet,\nWhere gods and demons lean upon each other, opening the grotto-heaven.\nWith sunken vessels, they first shared sheep and swine—\nUnmindful of floating clouds, they entered dreams.\n\nThe Deity of Shemu Mountain\nIn Yangchun County of Zhaoqing Prefecture stands Shemu Mountain, where clouds gather with numinous presence; when they shroud its peaks, rain must follow, and when they part, skies clear. To its south lies a shrine called the Shemu Mountain Shrine. In the Han, its deity was enfeoffed as Marquis Chuxiu, renowned for his manifest efficacy. The shrine is venerated throughout the region, and prayers for rain, drought relief, or healing from plague are always answered.\n\nAn old tale tells of a man from the south of the river, surnamed Li, who had no sons. One night, he dreamed the deity asked to be born as his heir, and so the child was named Fu. Later, Fu passed the imperial examinations and served as magistrate of Chunzhou. As he prepared to depart, he took leave of his mother, saying, \"When I go, I shall not return.\" Upon arriving at his post, he visited the Shemu Mountain Shrine. Gazing about, he recognized the gates as if he had seen them before. Soon after, he died.\n\nEver since Fu’s birth, the shrine’s offerings had ceased, but upon his death, its numinous power returned. Thus it is known that Fu’s life was the deity’s manifestation in the world.\n\nNote: The Tang-era Chunzhou is the present-day Yangchun County.\n\n*End of Scroll Three*\n*Scroll Three* (added according to textual conventions)\n\n*Scroll Four*\n*Table of Contents*\n\n*Scroll Four*\n\n**Table of Divinities**\n\nEmperor Zhuangwu of Jiang   Emperor Wulie of Changzhou   Five Commanders of Yangzhou   Hegemon-King of Western Chu   Lord Guan, the Righteous and Brave King of Martial Pacification   King Lingling#1   King Huiying   King Weihui the Manifest and Sacred   Great King of Jinshan Mountain   Duke Guohui of Wanhuí   Marshal Zhao   Marshal Peng   Marquis Runze   Marquis Weiji   Marquis Lingzhen   Lord Cui   General Fubo   Commander Mi   Prefectural Governor of Song   Minister Gan   Minister Lu   Minister Jiang of Hangzhou   Minister of Haoli   General Zu   Hua Qiao   Spirit of Mount Hua   Ancestral Deities of the Nie Clan\n\n**Emperor Zhuangwu of Jiang**\nEmperor Zhuangwu of Jiang, whose temple name was Jiankang Prefecture’s General Zhuangwu, was named Ziwen and was a native of Yangzhou. At the end of the Han dynasty, he served as a constable in Moling. While pursuing bandits to the foot of Mount Zhong, he was struck on the forehead and died. In the early years of Emperor Wu of the Wu kingdom, his former subordinate saw Ziwen on the road, riding a white horse and holding a white feather fan, attended as in life. The subordinate, startled, fled. Ziwen pursued and said to him, “I am to become the local earth deity. Bless the people below by building me a shrine, or I shall send insects into men’s ears as a plague.” The Wu ruler dismissed this as heretical talk, but later, insects did enter men’s ears, and many died, while shamans and physicians could not cure them. Ziwen also warned, “If you do not worship me, there shall be great fires.” That year, fires broke out repeatedly. He further said, “If you do not worship me, there shall be a great pestilence.” The Wu ruler, troubled, enfeoffed him as Marquis of the Central Capital, bestowed a seal and sash, and built a shrine at the foot of Mount Zhong, renaming the mountain Jiangshan to mark its numinous wonders.\n\nDuring the rebellion of Su Jun in the Jin dynasty, the emperor dreamed that Marquis Jiang said, “Su Jun is a traitor; I shall aid in his execution.” Later, Su Jun was indeed beheaded, and Marquis Jiang was promoted to Chancellor. During the reign of Emperor Xiaowu of the Jin, when Fu Jian invaded, the emperor saw the imperial troops arrayed in perfect order and beheld the grasses and trees on Mount Bagong transformed into human shapes, filling him with dread. Earlier, when Prince Dao of Kuaiji learned of Fu Jian’s invasion, he sought aid from the spirit of Mount Jiang with ceremonial music and banners. When Fu Jian saw them, he seemed to perceive divine assistance.\n\nIn the second year of Yongchu of Emperor Gao of the Song, an edict banned illicit shrines, but those from Jiang Ziwen downward were exempted. He was elevated to Chancellor, Grand Commander of All Military Affairs, and enfeoffed as King Jiang. During the Yongming era of the Qi, when Cui Huijing rebelled, the court welcomed the deity into the palace to seek blessings and aid. After the crisis passed, he was granted the imperial title. The shrine was renovated, with the outer gate named Lingguang Gate, the central gate named Xingshan Gate, the outer hall named Imperial Mountain, and the inner hall named Divine Abode.\n\nEmperor Wu of Liang often sacrificed to him but received no response. He sent envoys to burn the shrine, but before they reached their destination, a sudden storm arose, shaking the palace. The emperor, frightened, ceased his sacrifices. The Southern Tang renamed him Emperor Zhuangwu and renovated the shrine. Xu Xuan was ordered to compose an inscription, recording the events in full. During the Later Zhou dynasty, on the day of the imperial assembly, a fire destroyed the shrine in the eighth year of Kaibao. It was rebuilt in the fourth year of Yongxi and further expanded in the second year of Jingyou by Chen Zhizhong, who petitioned the court for the shrine’s plaque, bestowed as *Hui Lie*. In the twentieth year of Hongwu of the present dynasty, it was relocated to the southern slope of Yingwushan. Liu Sanwu was ordered to compose a record, and the locals called it one of the Ten Shrines.\n\n**Emperor Wulie of Changzhou**\nThe Loyal and Protective Emperor of Martial Might, surnamed Chen, named Guoren, styled Zhiwei, was a native of Jinling in Changzhou. His august ancestor, Song, served the Chen dynasty as a Feathered Forest Gentleman, and his father, Jiming, was appointed Gentleman of the Palace. The emperor was born on the fifteenth day of the third month of the second year of Taiqing of the Liang, in the year *jisi* at noon. His heroic bearing shone forth, marked by the rare signs of tripod horns and rhinoceros tusks, astonishing all who saw him. At eight, he could compose essays; at thirteen, he had read all the histories.\n\nIn the first year of Tiankang of Emperor Wen of the Chen, he passed the imperial examinations, stood in audience at the jade steps, and at just eighteen was appointed Investigating Censor, later promoted to Grand Inspector of the Jiangxi Circuit. The emperor’s wisdom and courage surpassed others, and he mastered military strategy. Serving the Chen for twenty-five years, he governed with filial piety and loyalty, bestowing virtue and kindness upon the people, his martial renown filling the realm.\n\nHe declined office under the Sui. When Emperor Yang toured Jiangdu, bandits arose on all sides, and the emperor, hearing of his reputation, summoned him to suppress them. Duty-bound to relieve the people’s suffering, he accepted the command. In the fifth year of Daye, he was appointed Upholder of Righteousness, pacified the rebels of Changbai, and was promoted to Gentleman for Summoning. He quelled the hundred thousand rebels of Le Botong in Jiangning and was appointed Grand Master for Splendid Happiness. He pacified the two hundred thousand bandits of Lou Shigan in Dongyang and was summoned to court as Grand Minister of State.\n\nAt the end of Daye, Shen Faxing raised troops in Wuxing, scheming to seize Changzhou with treacherous intent. Feigning allegiance, he secretly plotted. The bandit chieftain Li Zitong amassed tens of thousands of men on the north bank of the river, covertly aiding Faxing, but fearing the emperor’s might, dared not cross. In the second year of Wude of Emperor Gaozu of the Tang, on the eighteenth day of the fifth month, Faxing feigned illness and urgently summoned the emperor. Reluctantly, the emperor went to inquire after him and was poisoned during the feast. Rushing home, he summoned the eminent monk Lin, a renowned physician, for treatment. The method required washing his intestines to remove the poison in a secluded place from the *Xianji* Sutra. The emperor’s wife, Lady Shen, secretly observed by the pond and startled him. Knowing he could not be saved, he entrusted Lin and his concubines Zhang and Han, instructing them to convert his residence and southern treasury into a monastery and his eastern residence into a Buddhist temple. With these words, he passed away at the age of seventy-two.\n\nFaxing, hearing of his death, believed his ambitions fulfilled, but the emperor’s heroic spirit remained, his loyalty ever steadfast. One day, dark clouds blotted the sky, wind and rain darkened the world, and suddenly his majestic form appeared, loosing a divine arrow that struck down Faxing. The rebel forces were utterly vanquished.\n\nThe imperial protection and divine might manifested thus, leading the Tang emperor to bestow upon him the stele title *Feng Zhonglie Gong* and the posthumous name *Fushun Wulie Wang*. Later, the Later Zhou dynasty elevated him to imperial rank, and in the fourth year of the Xuanhe era of the Song, his temple was granted the plaque *Fushun*. His divine titles were further augmented as *Wulie Xianling Zhaode Dadi*, *Wulie Shenhou*, and *Zhao You Zhang Furén*. His divine father was *Qiling Hou*, and his divine mother, *Yide Duan Furén*. His divine stepmother was *Jiade Yi Furén*. His divine sons included *Zan Huiji Mei Hou* and *Xie Ying Jishun Hou*, while his divine grandson was a *recluse*. His divine aide, *Zi Dawei*, named *Kehong*, was enfeoffed as *Lanling Jiangjun*.\n\nThe Five Magistrates of Yangzhou—*Yangzhou Yingxian Situ* Mao, Xu, Zhu, Jiang, and Hao—dwelled in Yangzhou and swore brotherhood, delighting in hunting. The land was once plagued by tigers and wolves, bringing harm to the people. By a mountain stream, they encountered an elderly woman, solitary and without kin, who drank from the brook to sate her hunger. The five deities invited her to their dwelling, bowing and addressing her as mother. Before long, when they returned from hunting, she vanished, and the five were increasingly menaced by tigers. Resolved, they pursued the beasts into the mountains, where a tiger approached, prostrated itself, and submitted. From then on, the tiger scourge ceased. Later generations, remembering their virtue and righteousness, built a temple to worship them, where prayers were answered without fail. The temple stands today in the eastern part of Jin’gui Mountain in Dongxing Township, Jiangdu County. During the reign of Emperor Yang of Sui, they rendered meritorious service in protecting the imperial carriage and were enfeoffed as *Situ*. The Tang dynasty further granted them the title of *Hou*. In the Xinmao year of the Shaoding era of the Song, the rebel Li Quan repeatedly invaded the region. Prayers to the deities proved inauspicious, and in anger, the rebels desecrated the divine images. Within three days, Quan was slain at Xintang, his limbs scattered—just as he had treated the deities. After the rebellion was quelled, Prefect Zhao Fan personally led his officials to offer sacrifices at the temple in gratitude. The temple was expanded, and its hidden merits were memorialized to the court, which bestowed the plaque *Yingxian* and elevated their titles to *Bazi Hou*. Later, when Minister Jia Sidao governed the region, prayers to the deities brought immediate relief: droughts yielded to rain, floods gave way to sunshine, fires were extinguished, and snowfall arrived as auspiciously foretold. Their blessings for the state and people were ever-present. Jia memorialized the court, and they were further enfeoffed as kings: the first as *Lingwei Zhonghui Lanshun Wang*, the second as *Lingying Zhongli Fushun Wang*, the third as *Lingzhu Zhongwei Zuoshun Wang*, the fourth as *Lingyou Zhongji Zhushun Wang*, and the fifth as *Lingyong Zhonglie Chuxiang Wang*.\n\n**Xi Chu Bawang**\nXi Chu Bawang was none other than Xiang Yu. His temple stands forty *li* northeast of Hezhou, by the Wu River where he chose not to cross. Though the mountain is not high, its grasses and trees exude a chilling aura, and even the temple guardians dare not dwell near its slopes. Legend holds that the temple once faced the river, but a sunken boat obstructed the way. A traveler consoled the spirit with the verse, *\"The Han house now belongs to another,\"* and the temple’s orientation shifted. When the Jin ruler Hailing sought to cross the Yangtze, he prayed for omens but was denied. Enraged, he ordered the temple burned. Suddenly, a great serpent emerged from afar, and the beams of the hall and the trees behind the temple rustled as if thousands of soldiers had arrived. Hailing was terrified, and his retinue scattered in panic. A poem by Xu Biao reads:\n*Through a thousand years of rise and fall, fret not in vain,*\n*The Han’s great deeds now lie in ruins and dust.*\n*Only the grasses on the plain where Lady Yu once stood*\n*Dance on in the spring wind, unwilling to cease.*\n\n**Yiyong Wu’an Wang**\nBorn on the thirteenth day of the fifth month, Yiyong Wu’an Wang, surnamed Guan, named Yu, and styled Yunchang, hailed from Xieliang in Pu Prefecture. At the end of the Han, he joined Zhang Fei of Zhuo Commandery to assist Liu Xuande in raising righteous troops. Later, at Wolong Ridge in Nanyang, they thrice visited the thatched cottage to invite Zhuge Liang, carving the land into three kingdoms, with Shu as their state. Xuande appointed Guan Yu as Governor of Jingzhou. Alas, Lü Meng’s schemes led to his death, though he remained unyielding in integrity. Posthumously honored as *Grand General*, he was buried at Yuquan Mountain, where the locals, moved by his virtue, offered seasonal sacrifices. For his protection of the state and the people, his temple was named *Yiyong Wu’an Wang*. Emperor Huizong of the Song bestowed upon him the honorific *Chongning Zhidao Zhenjun*.\n\n**Lingling Wang**\nLingling Wang, surnamed Tang, named Shiyu, and styled Changtu, was originally from Lingling.\n\nThe family resided in Long Cave southwest of Yongzhou Prefecture. During the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of the Tang, bandits arose, and Shiyu rallied local militia to defend the village. Liu Jianfeng appointed him Prefect of Yongzhou. In the early Guanghua era, Ma Fu attacked the city, and Shiyu died without surrender. Later, the sound of war drums was heard for days, and a log once floated from the cave, coming to rest at Stone Carving Peak. When people sent it back to the middle of the river, it returned by dawn the next day—this occurred several times. During a drought, prayers for rain were answered, so the log was carved into an image and enshrined. Today, temples stand both south of the prefectural city and at Stone Thorn Shore, both highly efficacious. The Ma clan of Hunan bestowed upon him the rank of prince, and later the Song dynasty repeatedly granted him posthumous honors.\n\n**Huiying Wang**\nHuiying Wang, surnamed Ouyang and named You, was the Prefect of Wenling. He drowned while moored at Daqian River in Shaowu. Later, a temple was built at Daqian to honor him, and his numinous power was extraordinary. Prayers for rain or drought were answered as swiftly as an echo. According to the *Records of Temple Visits and Dreams*, when the Song minister Li Gang once visited the temple, he dreamed the deity received him and offered the host’s seat, which Li firmly declined. The deity said, \"One day, you will rely on me for leadership.\" When Li later became chancellor, the deity was granted additional honors. Coincidentally, Li and Ye Zuyi took the provincial examination, and Li dreamed the deity placed a slice of dog meat on the table, bidding him to eat it, then pointed to a bundle of bamboo below the hall—its meaning unclear. The following year, Li became *zhuangyuan* (top scorer) and realized the dog meat on the table formed the characters for \"zhuangyuan,\" while the bamboo bundle signified the examination’s policy questions. Such instances are too numerous to record. His temple is now called *Huiying*. **Weihui Xiansheng Wang**\n\nThe deity’s surname is Wu, given name Yun, courtesy name Zixu, son of She, a grandee of Chu. When King Ping of Chu heeded slander and executed Yun’s father She and elder brother Shang, Zixu fled to Wu. He spoke of the advantages of attacking Chu, and when Wu indeed battled Chu, victory was secured. Wu then entered Ying, where Yun exhumed King Ping’s corpse and lashed it three hundred times. Later, when Wu attacked Yue, Goujian of Yue took refuge on Mount Kuaiji and offered to serve as a vassal. The King of Wu consented, but Zixu’s remonstrations went unheeded. The Grand Steward Pi slandered Yun, and the king ordered him to take his own life with the sword *Shulou*. As he was about to die, he said, \"Wu is doomed.\" Enraged upon hearing this, the King of Wu had Yun’s corpse placed in a leather sack and cast into the river. The people of Wu pitied him and built a shrine on the riverbank, naming the temple *Weihui Xiansheng Wang*.\n\n**Jinshan Da Wang**\nThe Great King of Jinshan’s surname is Huo, personal name Guang, the Grand General of Han. The *Records of the Venerable and Old* state: When Sun Hao of Wu fell gravely ill, his distress was unbearable, and he could not restrain himself. He ordered all officials to pay homage at the sacred temples, yet no response came. Suddenly, one day at the fifth watch, as night waned and dawn’s light was about to break, a deity spoke to a young eunuch, saying, \"The illness will be cured, the illness will be cured.\" The diviner asked, \"What deity are you, and what office do you hold, that you report this fortune or misfortune?\" The deity replied, \"I am Huo Guang of Han. The winds and tides of Jinshan and the sea cause harm, and I have been appointed to command my subordinates to suppress them. I have come to bring Your Majesty this auspicious report.\" The next day, Sun Hao’s illness was indeed cured, and a temple was erected in Haixian County of Jiaxing, with the temple plaque inscribed *Xianzhong*. The common people call it the *Great King of Jinshan*.\n\n**Wan Jiong, Duke of the State**\nWan Hui Gong was a native of Quexiang in Haozhou.\n\nThe Zhang family, born on the fifth day of the fifth month in the sixth year of the Zhenguan era of the Tang (632 CE), was foolish and dull from birth, only able to speak at the age of eight or nine. Wild and unrestrained as if mad, none in his village could fathom him. One day, he ordered his household to sweep and clean, saying, \"Distinguished guests will arrive.\" That very day, the Tripitaka Master Xuanzang, returning from the Western Regions, sought him out. The Duke asked about the customs and landscapes of India, and his descriptions matched what Xuanzang had seen. Xuanzang bowed in reverence, acknowledging their truth. The Bodhisattva had an elder brother named Wannian, whose father had been conscripted to campaign in Liaodong. His mother, Madam Cheng, longed for news of him. The Duke said, \"This is easily done.\" He then informed his mother and set off, returning by dusk. When he delivered the letter, the neighbors were astonished, for divine soldiers stood guard on either side, their presence majestic and solemn. In the fourth year of the Xianheng era (673 CE), Emperor Gaozong summoned him, but he did not respond. Empress Wu later bestowed upon him a brocade robe and a jade belt. On the eighth day of the twelfth month in the second year of the Jingyun era (711 CE), the Master passed away in Chang’an at the age of eighty, the air suffused with an extraordinary fragrance. The Song dynasty posthumously enfeoffed him as Minister of Works and granted him the title Duke of the State.\n\n**Marshal Zhao, born on the fifteenth day of the third month**\nMarshal Zhao, whose personal name was Gongming, was a native of Zhongnan Mountain. From the Qin dynasty onward, he secluded himself in the mountains, cultivating the supreme Dao. Upon achieving perfection, he was summoned by the Jade Emperor’s decree to serve as Vice Marshal of the Divine Empyrean. According to records, the Marshal was born of the radiant transformation of the Primordial Chaos of the Heavenly Purity, his position corresponding to *qian* (Heaven), embodying the convergence of Metal and Water in the Black (North). His attire—a helmet of iron and an iron whip in hand—signifies Metal encountering Water in Black. His dark complexion and beard represent the Black of the North. Riding a tiger symbolizes the Metal phase. Thus, as the embodiment of Water within Metal, he becomes the instrument of the Dao, the principle of all principles. Without thunder and lightning, his might would not be manifest. His abode is the Western Terrace of Mount Taihua, and as Marshal, he is styled the Golden Wheel, also reflecting the Metal phase of the West. The Marshal’s duties, under the command of the Heavenly Gate, include patrolling the Three Realms, inspecting the Five Directions, overseeing the Nine Provinces, and serving as Grand General of the Palace Guard and Censor of the Northern Pole. When the Celestial Master of the Han, Zhang Daoling, refined the Great Elixir, the Dragon Spirit petitioned the Emperor to dispatch the fierce divine officers for its protection. Thus, the Marshal received the Jade Emperor’s decree to assume the office of Marshal Zhao of the Orthodox Unity Mysterious Altar. \"Orthodox\" (*zheng*) ensures no heterodoxy intrudes; \"Unity\" (*yi*) ensures singular devotion without duality. This office is of the utmost gravity. After the Celestial Master’s ascension, the Marshal was permanently stationed at the Dragon-Tiger Mountain, where, during the Three Primordials’ altar rites for transmitting the precepts, he oversees those who accumulate merit, atone for transgressions, and those stubborn and unenlightened. Hence, the Dragon-Tiger Mysterious Altar serves as the bureau of rewards and punishments. His subordinates include the Eight Mighty Kings, corresponding to the Eight Trigrams; the Six Toxic Deities, corresponding to the celestial, terrestrial, annual, monthly, daily, and hourly baleful stars; the Five Thunder Gods and Five Fierce Soldiers, corresponding to the Five Phases; and the Twenty-Eight Generals, corresponding to the Twenty-Eight Constellations. The Heaven-Harmonizing and Earth-Uniting Generals symbolize the opening and closing of the Heavenly Gate and Earthly Portal. The Water and Fire Battalions represent the cyclical movements of spring’s generation and autumn’s harvest. Commanding thunder, dispatching thunder, summoning rain, calling winds, dispelling pestilence, exorcising malevolent spirits, healing the sick, and averting disasters—none surpass the Marshal’s merits. In matters of litigation, the Marshal ensures just resolution; in commerce, he guarantees fair profit and harmonious transactions. Whatever is righteous and equitable may be prayed to the Marshal, and all shall be as one wishes. His titles include: Heavenly Sage, Supreme Marshal of the Jade Mansion of the Divine Empyrean, Inspector-General of the Five Directions, Chief Overseer of the Nine Provinces’ Earth Altars, Grand General of the Palace Guard, Vice Marshal and Censor of the Northern Pole, Grand Marshal of the Three Realms, Illustrious and Resolute Marquis, Arbiter of Destiny, Commander of the Twenty-Eight Constellations, Marshal of the Orthodox Unity Mysterious Altar, and Flying Tiger Golden Wheel Dharma Marshal Zhao.\n\n**Marshal Peng**\nMarshal Peng, whose surname was Peng and personal name Tingjian, once served as magistrate of Chong’an County, where he suppressed bandits as easily as crushing dry weeds. For his merits, during the Zhizheng era of the Yuan dynasty, he was repeatedly promoted to Vice Marshal of the Fujian Pacification Office. When bandits arose, Peng subdued them one by one. Later, he was ambushed and killed when his horse stumbled. The bandits struck him, yet his body remained upright, his eyes rolled upward, his beard and hair bristling as if blown by the wind, deterring them from approaching. After some time, the disturbance ceased, and his former subordinates escorted his coffin back to Chong’an. The people mourned him as they would their parents, erecting a temple with his likeness to perpetuate his worship. In times of drought, flood, or pestilence, they hastened to pray, and the Marshal’s divine response was as swift as an echo. The common folk called him Marshal Peng. Neighboring counties also established temples in his honor, and his efficacy was equally manifest.\n\n**Marquis Runji**\nThe Marquis, a general of the Later Wei, bore the personal name Yuan. During a military campaign, he encamped at Baibiao Mountain in Fenzhou, where his troops suffered from thirst. The soldiers grew restless. The Marquis dismounted, knelt, and vowed to Heaven, pledging his life. Suddenly, his horse pawed the ground, and a spring gushed forth. Ever since, the flowing waters of this miraculous source have irrigated the land, benefiting all beings, its efficacy enduring. The locals built a temple before Baibiao Mountain, where his divine responses were particularly extraordinary. The Song dynasty bestowed the temple plaque *Shui Ze* (\"Water Nourishment\") and enfeoffed the deity as Marquis Runji. In the eleventh year of the Hongwu era of the present dynasty (1378 CE), he was styled the Spirit of Baibiao Mountain’s Horse-Pawed Spring, and officials offered sacrifices in spring and autumn.\n\n**Marquis Weiji**\nThe Marquis, surnamed Li and bearing the personal name Lu’an, was a native of Tongzhuang in Changxing County, Jizhou. Born on the eighteenth day of the first month of the third year of the Chongning era of Emperor Huizong of the Song (1104 CE), a *jiashen* day, he possessed an extraordinary constitution from youth. Solemn and dignified, he spoke only when necessary. When villagers faced impending fortune or misfortune, he could foresee and warn them in advance.\n\nAt the age of eighteen, in the third month of the third year of the Xuanhe era (1121 CE), he suddenly foretold his neighbors and fellow villagers, saying, \"I shall journey to Jiaoxi in Shandong to serve the state, and fear I may not return for several years.\" Thereupon, he sat upright and passed away. Thereafter, numerous spiritual traces manifested in his hometown: the abundance or scarcity of the year’s harvest, the success or failure of the early and late crops—all were revealed through the medium of shamans, as precise as a seal matching its impression or a key fitting its lock. Thus, the elders collectively established a place for incense offerings and worshipped him. Emperor Ningzong bestowed the temple plaque *Xianying* (\"Manifest Response\"), and Emperor Lizong enfeoffed him as Marquis Weiji.\n\n**Spirit of the Lingpai River**\nLi Shan, originally from Sanyong in Weizhou, served as a general during the reign of Emperor Shizong of the Later Zhou. Skilled in mounted archery, he rendered meritorious service to the state. Later, gravely ill, he received many visitors inquiring after his health. Without further words, he declared to the assembly, \"I have been appointed General of the Qihe River in eastern Shandong.\" With these words, he expired. Later generations established a shrine at this site. In the first year of the Kaiyuan era of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang (713 CE), he was enfeoffed as General of the Lingpai. By the eighth year of the Dazhong Xiangfu era of Emperor Zhenzong of the Song (1015 CE), he was further enfeoffed as Marquis Lingpai.\n\n**Prefect Cui**\nPrefect Cui was a native of Gucheng in Qizhou. His father, Rang, and his wife prayed devoutly at Mount Tai for an heir. That night, the couple dreamed of a divine youth holding a box. When Cui Rang inquired, the youth replied, \"The Emperor bestows the contents of this box, bidding you and your wife to consume them.\" Upon lifting the lid, they beheld two exquisite jade tablets. Each swallowed one.\n\nUpon waking, she conceived, and after ten months, on the sixth day of the sixth lunar month in the second year of the Daye era of the Sui (606 CE), she gave birth to a son whose spirit and countenance surpassed those of ordinary men. From childhood, he pursued his studies, reciting a thousand words daily without indulging in the games of other boys. Thus, he was named Ziyu.\n\nIn the seventh year of the Zhenguan era of Emperor Taizong of the Tang (633 CE), an imperial edict summoned the worthy and virtuous from across the land to the capital, where they were appointed to office. The Prefect was among them, each granted the rank of county magistrate. He was assigned as magistrate of Changzi County in Luzhou. Upright and impartial, his discernment was as keen as autumn down. The people of the prefecture said of him, \"Our magistrate governs the yang realm by day and judges the yin courts by night.\"\n\nIn the fifth month, the magistrate issued a proclamation to the townsfolk: \"On the fifteenth day of this month and the day following, no living beings may be killed, nor may hunting or archery be practiced. Those who violate this decree will be punished in the official courts and held accountable in the courts of the yin realm.\" At that time, two men secretly ventured beyond the city walls and shot a hare. Upon entering the city gate, they were apprehended by the guards and brought before the magistrate. He questioned them, saying, \"You have willfully violated the decree. Do you wish to receive punishment here in the county court or in the yin courts?\" The men replied, \"We beg to receive punishment in the yin courts,\" believing the yin judgment would be less immediate. With that, they were released to return home.\n\nThat very night, as they lay down to sleep, a yellow-robed clerk suddenly summoned them to a grand hall. There, they saw Magistrate Cui, adorned in the regalia of a king, reviewing the records of their transgressions. Some had their lifespans shortened, others their descendants doomed, and still others their official stipends revoked. \"Your good and evil deeds shall be judged accordingly,\" he declared, then sent them back to their homes. Startled awake, the men were filled with awe.\n\nOne day, a gate clerk reported, \"On Peng Huang Ridge, a fierce tiger blocks the road and harms travelers.\" The magistrate dispatched his chief clerk, Meng Wan, bearing an official summons to the mountain shrine to apprehend the tiger. The tiger emerged, took the summons in its mouth, and followed the clerk to the magistrate’s hall. Magistrate Cui rebuked it, saying, \"You are but a beast, yet you devour human lives. What punishment do you deserve?\" Upon hearing this, the tiger struck its head against the steps and died. The townspeople erected a shrine to honor him in life.\n\nIn the seventeenth year of the Zhenguan era, he was transferred to serve as magistrate of Ganyang County in Cizhou, where he adjudicated the case of Yang Sou’s two sons, who had been wronged by debt—a matter left unresolved since the time of Emperor Taizong’s sojourn in the netherworld.\n\nLater, he was promoted to magistrate of Wei County in Weizhou, and on the journey to his post, he traveled alongside Yang Sou, the chess-playing elder. Five *li* southwest of the county lay a river, which in summer often overflowed, flooding the fields of the local people. Magistrate Cui erected an altar by the riverbank and presented a memorial to the August Emperor. Shortly after, a massive serpent surfaced in the water and perished. The floodwaters gradually receded, and the people of the prefecture later built a shrine to honor him in life.\n\nOne day, as Magistrate Cui and Yang Sou played chess, several figures in yellow robes suddenly appeared, bearing an imperial edict. They announced, \"We are sent by the August Emperor,\" and were followed by attendants bearing jade tablets, jade belts, purple robes, and the banners of the Five Peaks and Wei. Over a hundred more arrived, bowed, and stood in attendance as *xiao* and *shao* music played on strings and bamboo. Then a deity led forth a white horse. The magistrate said, \"Wait a moment,\" and called his two sons, saying, \"I am about to depart this world; do not grieve excessively.\" He took up brush and paper and wrote a hundred-character inscription to instruct his sons. The sons wept as they bowed and received his final words. With that, he passed away at the age of sixty-four.\n\nLater, his son Xuan rendered meritorious service and was appointed governor of Yuzhang. He discerned the people’s desires and aversions, gathering what they favored and removing what they disliked. Governance flowed smoothly, the people lived in harmony, and his administrative achievements were widely acclaimed. Later, while leading troops in Pingxiang, he perished in the turmoil of Wang Dun’s rebellion. A temple was established fifty *li* east of Pingxiang County, at the very site of his death. His numinous efficacy shone brightly, illuminating the region.\n\nDuring the Song dynasty, a prolonged drought once afflicted the land, with no rain for months. The local officials offered prayers everywhere to no avail. The elders then spoke of Lord Gan, and the prefect, Zu Wuze, heeded their words. After bathing and fasting, he visited the shrine, whereupon a torrential downpour fell, ensuring a bountiful harvest. The lord was granted additional honorific titles, and in the present dynasty, his temple was rebuilt. The local officials now offer spring and autumn sacrifices in his honor.\n\nThe temple of Lord Lu stands at the foot of Mianshi Mountain in Deqingzhou, where his numinous efficacy brings blessings to the local people. According to *Yijian Zhi*, when Lu Jia of the Han dynasty was sent as an envoy to Nanyue, he sailed with Zhao Tuo. Passing this spot, Lu Jia silently prayed, \"If I persuade the King of Yue to submit, may the mountain spirit reward me with a stone wrapped in brocade.\" Upon his return, he saw flowers and plants flourishing where he had prayed, as if brocade had been laid upon the stone. Later generations built a temple there to honor him.\n\nIn the Song dynasty, when Liang Tai journeyed to the capital, his boat moored beneath the stone. That night, he dreamed of a guest who introduced himself as Lord Lu, saying, \"I have languished here for over a thousand years. Now that you have graced me with your presence, I beg you to leave a poem.\" Liang awoke, struck by the dream, and paid his respects at the temple. He inscribed a poem on the wall before departing.\n\nElders pass down that Brocade Stone Mountain derives its name from Lu Jia’s mission to Nanyue, when he set up a brocade-draped tent here—this account is appended for reference.\n\n**Minister Jiang of Hangzhou**\nMinister Jiang, surnamed Jiang, was a native of Hangzhou for generations. Born during the Jianyan era of the Song dynasty, whenever autumn harvests yielded abundant grain, he stored it in advance, selling at the original price when prices rose. In lean years, he often reduced costs or distributed grain to the starving. At his death, he exhorted his two younger brothers: *\"You must preserve a benevolent heart and strive to do good deeds.\"* The villagers collectively sculpted his likeness to honor his virtuous legacy, and his numinous efficacy responded like an echo. Those seeking divination thronged shoulder to shoulder. In the early Xianchun era, the temple was granted the plaque *\"Guangfu\"* (Vast Blessing). In the sixth year, Pacification Commissioner Qian Shuiyou petitioned the court, and the deity—along with his two brothers—was enfeoffed as marquises: the First Ranked *Fushun* (Trustworthy and Compliant) Marquis, the Second Ranked *Fuying* (Trustworthy and Responsive) Marquis, and the Third Ranked *Fuyou* (Trustworthy and Protective) Marquis.\n\n**Minister Zhao of Haoli**\nMinister Zhao of Haoli was a native of Haoli Village in Chang’an. His family, originally farmers who plowed and tilled as their livelihood, later pursued the imperial examinations and passed. A man of unyielding integrity and impartiality, he repeatedly submitted remonstrances that went unheeded. In the end, he struck the palace steps and died. The people of his prefecture established a shrine for him, now located twenty *li* west of Chang’an, with his tomb beside the road. In the Yanhe era of Emperor Ruizong’s reign, he was posthumously enfeoffed as *Zhili* (Upright and Exemplary) Marquis, and the common folk refer to him as *\"Minister.\"*\n\n**General Zu**\nThe General’s origins and surname remain unknown. His temple stands alone by Jingxing Lake in Jiujiang, its statue solemn and lifelike. His numinous efficacy has manifested through the ages, and both locals and travelers offer reverent worship. According to the *Collected Works of Ouyang Zhan* from the Tang dynasty: *\"When Yan Qing of the Lu state served as governor of Huzhou, the prefecture produced stone for steles. As he transported the stone back and passed Jiangzhou, dragons and oysters surged forth, dragging the boat to the lake’s center. There, lush forests and towering cliffs encircled a site of potent *qi*, where a shrine stood—the Temple of General Zu. The governor donated funds to build a roadside pavilion, naming it Zu Pavilion, and composed an inscription for a stele to commemorate the event.\"* A poem by an ancient traveler passing the temple reads:\n\nAmid green mountains that rise and vanish without end,\nEmerald waters that drift and return again.\nI ask of the general’s deeds in those moonlit days—\nYet pity the bones now buried at Dongting’s edge.\n\n**Marshal Hua**\nMarshal Hua, surnamed Hua and named Jingding, was originally from Chang’an. His temple stands in Meizhou’s Shuguan Town. According to records, Hua Jingding followed Cui Guangyuan into Shu during the Zhide era of the Tang to suppress Duan Zizhen, for which he was enfeoffed as Duke of Jiaxiang County. Later, he clashed with a formidable bandit chieftain. Shouting fiercely in battle from dawn to dusk, his ranks were nearly annihilated, yet he fought on alone, his head already severed, still astride his horse with spear in hand. Arriving at the town, he dismounted to wash his hands, when a girl spinning silk in the courtyard asked: *\"Why wash when you have no head?\"* He then collapsed. The locals buried him by the stream, and through the ages, his temple has been venerated, his numinous traces resplendent. Du Fu’s song reads:\n*\"Chengdu’s fierce marshal, Marshal Hua—\nEven babes learning to speak know his name.\nSwift as hawk or kite, fire and wind his pace,\nFacing foes, his body light as if weightless.\"*\n\n**The Spirits of Mount Hua**\nThree spirits are revered: the first, Fuqi Xi of the Jin; the second, his disciple Wang Bao; the third, his disciple Guo Ji. Together they are known as the Three Immortals of Huagai. Their sacred precinct lies on Xianhua Mountain in Chongren, Fuzhou—a towering temple that pierces the clouds, renowned for its potent efficacy. When scholars or commoners face calamities, illnesses, or epidemics, all flock to pray at the shrine. Supplicants first purify themselves through fasting, then at the appointed time, carry incense and silk, walking in solemn procession as if treading upon pearls. Those arriving ride swiftly along the main road, while those departing stand with hands clasped to the left, none daring to overstep. The chant of *\"Amitābha\"* resounds across the fields, much like the pilgrims at Mount Tai or Wudang’s Taihe. An ancient poem describes:\n*\"Treading the azure stream’s stones, they churn the waters,\nWhere liquid crimson mists dissolve the cave’s celestial vault.\"*\n\nFurther inquiring what Floating Hill’s affairs might be,\nOne would do well to journey east and gaze upon the verdant fields.\n\nThe Nie Clan’s Incense Flame\nThe incense flame bears the surname Nie, its lineage rooted in Wangjia Ferry of Nanchang. Legend tells of Nie Shanggan, an elderly matriarch of singular virtue. A wandering physiognomist of keen discernment would often lodge at her home, and she received him with unwavering courtesy, never once growing weary. The man once declared to her: *\"Your family shall receive abundant recompense.\"* Later, he indeed pointed out a burial site and instructed her to inter the dead there, offering this prayer: *\"May your descendants serve as hidden officials generation after generation.\"*\n\nFrom then on, each generation of the Nie family produced a spirit of numinous efficacy and manifest responsiveness, and the villagers vied to worship them. There was Nie the Grand Official, clad in the robes he wore in life; Nie the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Officials, all arrayed in martial armor. Then there was Nie the Ninth Gentleman, the youngest to become a deity, whom the people of the time playfully called *\"the Nie Clan’s Incense Flame.\"*\n\n*Soushen Ji*, Scroll Four—concluded\n\n*Soushen Ji*, Scroll Five—beginning\n(Table of Contents)\n\n**Scroll Five of *Soushen Ji***\n\n**Deities and Spirits Recorded Herein:**\nGuangping Lü the Divine Elder • Huangling Spirit • Master Huang the Immortal • Jiangdong Spirit-Lots • Lord Xieji • Marquis Lingyi • Zhang Zhaolie • Duke Zhang the Seventh • Lord Geng the Seventh • General Sun • General Zhang • King Shunji • Dragon Lord of Hengpu • Five Dragon Spirits of Daozhou • Dragon Spirit of Marquis Zhaoling • Dragon Spirit of Mount Yang • Huangshi Gong • Stone Spirit • Spirit-Stone of Chuxiong • Stone Tortoise • Bell Spirit • Horse Spirit • Green Snake Spirit • Golden Horse and Emerald Fowl • Metal Essence • Fire Essence • Chenbao Rooster Spirit • General of Blackwater • Wooden Recluse • Mo Cuo Spirit • Huangmo Spirit • King Xiang • Bamboo King • Panhu\n\n*(Table of Contents—concluded)*\n\n---\n\n**Guangping Lü the Divine Elder**\nDuring the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, a Daoist named Lü the Elder once rested at a farmhouse north of Ezhou County. There he met a young man, Lu Sheng, who lamented his poverty. Just then, the host was cooking millet, and Lü offered his pillow to the youth, saying: *\"Sleep on this, and it shall bring you glory and fulfillment as you desire.\"*\n\nLu Sheng took the pillow and dreamed he entered through its opening. In his dream, he returned home and married a woman of the Cui clan, surpassingly fair. The next year, he passed the imperial examinations, rose to the rank of Grand Councilor, and died at eighty. When he awoke, Lü the Elder sat beside him, and the host’s millet was still not done. Lu Sheng rose and bowed in gratitude: *\"This is how you curb my desires, Master.\"*\n\nLater, the people built a temple to him. In times of flood, drought, or plague, all prayers were answered without fail.\n\n---\n\n**Huangling Spirit**\nThe temple stands west of Huangniu Gorge in Yiling Prefecture, Jingzhou. Legend holds that the spirit once aided Yu in harnessing the floods, and his numinous efficacy has been proven many times. When Zhuge Liang governed Shu during the Three Kingdoms, an old man recounted these deeds, urging him to honor the spirit’s merit and marvel at his divine responses in blessing the people. Thus, a shrine was erected there, also called the Yellow Ox Temple.\n\nA poem by Su Shi of the Song:\n*By the river, cliffs rise pathless high,*\n*Where a yellow ox stands, unyoked to plow.*\n*Travelers before the temple bow and dance,*\n*Beating drums, piping flutes, slaughtering white sheep.*\n*Below the hills, oxen toil at dawn’s first light,*\n*Horns worn on rock, hooves split with strain.*\n*A half-bundle of green fodder—hunger’s bitter sting,*\n*Yet gazing up, the yellow ox remains distant, beyond reach.*\n\n---\n\n**Master Huang the Immortal**\nThe immortal master surnamed Huang, seventh in his line, was a native of Shanghang.\n\nMaster Huang practiced the arts of the *wu*-medium and could lash out at ghosts and demons to drive away malevolent spirits. His shrine stands southwest of the Shanghang county seat. Originally located in the stone gorge of Zhongliao Market, it was later relocated to its present site. Legend tells that long ago, mountain sprites and stone demons wrought havoc, and the medium Huang the Seventh Lord subdued them with talismanic arts. Concealing himself within the rock, he never emerged, yet his likeness remained faintly visible upon the stone wall, so lifelike it seemed the immortal master’s image. An old poem says:\n\n*No god’s sharp blade, no demon’s claw,*\n*Yet mists arise, clouds form anew.*\n*The master once entered the mountain stone—*\n*How many springs have passed in moss and dew?*\n\n**Jiangdong Spirit Lots**\nBorn on the eighth day of the first lunar month, the lot-divining spirit surnamed Shi, named Gu, was a native of Gan County during the Qin dynasty. After his death, he became a spirit. On overcast, misty days or in the faint moonlight of deep night, villagers often saw him appear with an entourage like a high official. Having received office in the netherworld, he oversees its affairs. People built a shrine for him, offering jade and silk, and sought his counsel on fortune and misfortune, receiving answers as if he were present. His divine responses proved ever more efficacious, so they composed a hundred rhymed verses to serve as lots. The spirit’s responses through them were unfailingly precise. The shrine lies five *li* east of the Gong River outside Ganzhou Prefecture’s city walls, hence its name, Jiangdong Spirit Lots. It has since been celebrated as an illustrious name. In the present dynasty, Song Lian wrote an essay to record its history.\n\n**Lord Xieji**\nLord Xieji was a pair of deities. The two brothers, surnamed Zeng, valued integrity and scorned wealth, delighting in generosity. Their fraternal bond was especially deep. During the Three Kingdoms period, when warfare raged, they retreated together to the Nine Sons Mountain in Qingyang—now known as Mount Jiuhua. After their deaths, they manifested divine powers to aid the people in times of disaster, warding off calamities and achieving great merit. The townsfolk, marveling at their virtue, built two shrines to honor the brothers, one on the eastern side of Mount Jiuhua and the other on the western side. During the Daguan era of the Song dynasty, the shrines were granted the name Xieji Temple. To this day, offerings are made with ever greater reverence, and prayers are answered without fail.\n\n**Marquis Lingyi**\nThe marquis surnamed Gou—his given name is unknown—was a native of Longzhou in Fengxiang Prefecture. His shrine stands to the left of the Longzhou county seat. An inscription on its stele records that in the second year of the Dali era of the Tang dynasty, when the old city walls were in disrepair, a man of the Gou clan donated land for a new city, and the walls were relocated there. The military officers found it advantageous, so they built a shrine to honor him. The spirit’s divine efficacy grew ever more manifest, and all who prayed to him received answers as if he were present. The Song dynasty enfeoffed him as Marquis Lingyi and granted his shrine the name Anyou. In the present dynasty, the shrine was renovated and expanded, and those who maintain its rites come in even greater numbers.\n\n**Zhang Zhaolie**\nZhang Zhaolie, surnamed Zhang, was a native of Huatai during the Five Dynasties period. After his death, he became a spirit and displayed divine efficacy. His shrine stands in Qianyang County of Langzhou Prefecture. During the Song dynasty, when the rebel Pan Zongyan led his forces to attack the city, they had not yet reached the moat when they saw an army emerging from the city—some with green faces and fangs bared, others with red beards and crimson armor, still others with ox necks, horse faces, four arms, or double forks. Some stood over a *zhang* tall, while others were no more than two or three *chi*. They leapt and howled, surging forward like a swarm, spewing fire and smoke in a thousand grotesque forms, like ghosts and demons. The rebels, seized with terror, fled in panic, trampling one another, and scattered far away. Later, when Huang Anjun and Cao Cheng both attacked the city, it never fell—all by the spirit’s power.\n\nA decree was issued to enfeoff him as a king, with the temple name Zhaolie. The present dynasty further revered and worshipped him.\n\n**Minister Zhang the Seventh**\nMinister Zhang, whose surname was Zhang and who was the seventh in his generation, was a native of Macheng County during the Song dynasty. He once studied the Daoist arts under an extraordinary master, gaining their essential teachings. He could summon and command ghosts and spirits, and knew the affairs of the netherworld. Thus, he destroyed the temples along the Yangtze and struck down prisons. Once, a fire broke out in the southeast corner of the city, spreading to hundreds of households and throwing the entire city into chaos. The minister emerged from prison riding a white horse, wielding a short staff. Pointing east, the fire in the east was extinguished; pointing west, the fire in the west died out. The same held true for the south and north, and the fire was immediately quelled. He then proceeded to the Wunao Mountain in the northwest of the city, where both man and horse transformed. When the matter was reported to the authorities, the prison officers inspected the cell and found the door still tightly sealed as before. All were astonished. A temple was then built at the site of his transformation. It is said that when scholars and commoners pay their respects, the clothing and belongings they leave along the road remain untouched. If any wicked or obstinate individuals attempt to pass, they become lost and cannot find their way out. His divine responses were the most renowned in the region.\n\n**Minister Geng the Seventh**\nThe temple of Minister Geng stands fifteen *li* northwest of Gaoyou Prefecture in Yangzhou. According to local elders, he was a native of Liangshan Marsh in Dongping, born with a chivalrous spirit. With a single cry and his sword raised high, he embodied the valor of the ancient heroes Meng Ben and Xia Yu. Though Liangshan Marsh was famed as a gathering place for heroes, all its leaders deferred to him, submitting as if he were the wind beneath their wings. When the army marched south, he fell ill and died within the prefecture’s borders. His divine efficacy became widely manifest, and all prayers to him were answered. The Song dynasty bestowed upon him the title \"Kangze Xia\" (Chivalrous Flood Controller). To this day, both local residents and travelers by boat offer him sacrifices.\n\n**General Sun**\nGeneral Sun, whose surname was Sun and given name Shan, was a man of the Five Dynasties period. His temple stands west of the county seat of Ninghua. Whenever there was illness or drought, prayers to him were immediately answered. It is said that once a thief stole a quantity of jewelry from a villager. Fearing capture, he hid the goods beneath the seat of the deity. When he returned to retrieve them, the jewelry had vanished. After searching repeatedly to no avail, he suspected someone else had taken them. Ten days later, the victim’s family, in mutual distress, swore an oath before the deity. No sooner had they kowtowed than they noticed something yellow and white in the crevice of a brick. Upon opening it, they found the stolen goods. His divine traces were many. The Song dynasty minister Li Gang wrote a poem:\n\n*Unfearing of exile in straw sandals to the distant south,*\n*The divine banner of your vow aids the northern campaign.*\n*With a cup of wine poured, I wipe my tearful eyes—*\n*Through the mist and clouds, where lie the two capitals?*\n\n**General Zhang**\nGeneral Zhang, whose surname was Zhang and given name Xiaozhong, was a scholar from Huai.\n\nThe temple stands on Yuzhen Mountain in Anren County, Raozhou Prefecture. When the Yuan forces reached Anren, Judicial Commissioner Xie Fangde mobilized the loyal and filial to resist them. The two sides clashed at Tuan Lake, stalemating for days. In a fierce battle, arrows were exhausted, and the loyal and filial general wielded twin blades, slaying over a hundred men before falling to a stray arrow. The bandits entered Anren, but suddenly, at midnight, the southeastern corner of the city erupted with drums, horns, and roaring cries, as if thousands of troops and horses surged forth. The bandit commander rushed to observe—under the faint moonlight and dim stars, he saw the general astride a white horse, brandishing twin blades amidst the clouds and mist, charging back and forth. The commander bowed in apology. Once order was restored, locals often witnessed him riding swiftly, blade in hand, his grievances unavenged. They erected a shrine at the site of his death to worship him, and many divine wonders manifested. Yuan dynasty’s Ouyang Yan wrote an account of this.\n\n**King Shunji**\nThe temple of King Shunji is located on Haocheng Mountain in Xinjian County, commonly known as \"Little Dragon Cloud.\" Legend holds it is the offspring of the great serpent slain by the Perfected Ones Hao and Xu. During the Song dynasty, he was enfeoffed as King Shunji. Emperor Zhenzong composed an imperial inscription, *The Stone Carving to Ward Off Flood Dragons*, and in the Xining era, the Court of Imperial Sacrifices dispatched Lin Xiyi to offer sacrifices. An unusual serpent fell onto the altar. The next morning, as the rites began, the serpent raised its head in anticipation. Upon completion, it slithered along the tables and chairs, then into the tent. When Lin Xiyi departed, the serpent followed, its tail dragging like an axle, escorting him to Pengli Lake before vanishing. Later, Su Shi, returning north from exile in Huan’er, moored his iron boat at the temple. He discovered an ancient stone arrowhead by the shore, but while passing it among his attendants, it slipped into the river. He prayed to the deity, vowing to leave it in the temple if recovered. Sending men to search the waters, they retrieved it in a single attempt. Su Shi then composed a record of the event.\n\n**Dragon Lord of Hengpu**\nThe Dragon Lord’s surname and given name are unknown. His temple stands in the prefectural seat of Nan’an, Jiangxi, named Hengpu after an ancient commandery. According to the *Record of Words and Deeds*, Hengpu, in the scorching south, rarely sees snow even in deep winter, yet pestilence is rampant. The Dragon Lord’s temple grants every prayer. Zhang Jiucheng remarked, \"Though I hold no office, my annual salary is depleted. Why not seek his favor?\" He prayed, and at dawn, while the sun shone brightly, dark clouds suddenly gathered. By dusk, snow had accumulated an inch deep, astonishing the locals. At the time, Jiucheng served as Vice Minister of Rites, but Qin Hui despised his remonstrations and demoted him to prefect of Junzhou. Later, Qin instigated censors to accuse him of slandering the court, exiling him further to Nan’an. Thus, his devotion to the Dragon Lord was as described. In the present dynasty, his temple was rebuilt, and its sacrifices grew ever more revered.\n\n**Five Dragon Deities of Daozhou**\nThe temple stands beside the Five Dragon Well in Daozhou. According to Yan Shu’s *Essentials*, when Tang dynasty’s Yang Cheng was appointed governor of Daozhou, five elders approached him in Xiangyang, claiming to be from Chongling. Cheng gave them silk and asked their residence. They replied, \"Five *li* northwest of the city.\" Upon arrival, he found only the Five Dragon Well, with the silk still there. He built a temple, which repeatedly displayed divine wonders. The temple plaque reads *Chongying* (\"Manifest Response\"). An old poem on its walls reads:\n\n*The mountain’s chill—coiled dragons stir from sleep,*\n*Yellow-robed elders tread the crags below.*\n*Clutching gnarled vines of a thousand years,*\n*They hide their names lest mortals come to know.*\n\n**Marquis Zhaoling**\nMarquis Zhaoling, surnamed Zhang and named Lusi, was from Nanyang. During the early Sui dynasty, he settled in Baishe Village, Pin County. At sixteen, he passed the *Mingjing* examination. In the Jinglong era of the Tang, he served as magistrate of Xuancheng, renowned for his talent and ability.\n\nLady Shi bore him nine sons. After resigning from his post in Xuancheng, he often fished on the northern bank of Jiaoshi Terrace. One day, he looked back to see palaces and towers where he had been fishing, and so he entered to dwell there, departing at night and returning at dawn. One morning, he felt a chill and fever. His wife asked him about it, and he said, \"I am a dragon. A certain Zheng Xiangyuan, also a dragon, has encroached upon this dwelling. Tomorrow, we shall contend for it, and I will have our nine sons assist me. The one with the crimson aura is I; the one with the blue-green aura is Zheng.\" The next day, the nine sons shot arrows at the blue-green aura, striking it in anger before it departed. The lord pursued it, carving valleys and ravines as they passed, until they reached the Huai River. There, the blue-green aura flung itself into the western mountains of Hefan and perished—this place is called Longxue Mountain. The nine sons all transformed into dragons, while Lady Shi was buried at Guanzhou.\n\nThe lord’s elder brother had been a cavalry and infantry commander, and his descendants scattered to live around Pin Mountain; their tombs remain to this day. The account is recorded in the writings of the Tang commoner Zhao Geng and transmitted through the oral traditions of elders in the Huai and Pin regions. It is also documented in *Collected Antiquities* by Ouyang Wenzhong.\n\nSince the Jinglong era, the people of Pin have offered sacrifices to him at Jiaoshi Terrace. In the second year of Qianning, Prefect Wang Jingyao expanded the temple. During the Qiande reign of the Song, when Caizhou suffered a severe drought, its prefect, Si Chao, having heard of the lord’s divine power, built a shrine to him in Cai. After the rains came, Hanlin Academician Cheng Xi and Tao Gu recorded the event. From then on, from Huainan to Chen, Cai, Xu, and Ru, people flocked to worship him.\n\nIn the Jingde era, Remonstrance Grand Master Zhang Bing, by imperial decree, further renovated the shrine in Pin. During the Xining reign, Minister of the Bureau of Sacrifices Zhang Hui petitioned for an honorific title, and an edict was issued conferring upon the lord the title *Marquis Zhaoling* and upon Lady Shi the title *Lady Rouying*. The temple has five caves, where divine wonders are often seen—clouds and rain emerge, or vessels cast into the caves appear on the ground. In recent years, molted bones have been found in the pond. A golden bell, Wang Zhi, varies in weight unpredictably; it is now kept in the temple.\n\nIn the autumn of the sixth year of Yuanyou, during a severe drought, the prefect, Dragon Diagram Academician and Gentleman for Court Audiences Left Su Shi, had the bones conveyed to the temporary shrine by West Lake. There, he and the officials and people prayed, and the response was as before. Thus, the temple was further restored.\n\n**Dragon Spirit of Yang Mountain**\n\nThe deities are two dragons, and their temple stands on Yang Mountain in Yuanzhou Prefecture. According to legend, a villager named Xu Tan was once sailing past Great Lone Mountain when he encountered two scholars named Xiao, who said they resided on Yang Mountain in Yichun. Xu took them aboard and brought them home. Upon reaching the eastern shore, they bade farewell, promising to meet again at Stone Bridge. Later, when Xu arrived at the spot, he saw two dragons and realized they were the gods of Yang Mountain. During the Huichang era of the Tang, one night of thunder and rain, the temple was relocated to Wenming Quarter south of the prefectural seat. In the Song, the temple was granted the plaque *Fu Hui* (\"Trust and Grace\"). During the Yuan, it was rebuilt, and the people revered the two gods with utmost devotion, their prayers invariably answered. In the present dynasty, the god of Great Yang Mountain was enfeoffed, and sacrifices are offered in spring and autumn. Additionally, in Linggang of Fenyi, there is a branch shrine, said to be where the gods once moored their boat.\n\nThe shrine of the Yellow Stone Elder is located on the southern slope of Gucheng Mountain in Dong’e County. Formerly, during the Han, Zhang Liang encountered an old man at the Yi Bridge in Xiapei, who sat with legs sprawled and ordered Liang to fetch his shoes. Liang reluctantly complied. The old man, pleased, said, \"This youth is teachable,\" and bestowed upon him a book, adding, \"Thirteen years hence, beneath the Yellow Stone on Gucheng Mountain north of Qi, you will find me.\" Later, Liang studied the book and applied its strategies, aiding Emperor Gaozu of Han in overthrowing Qin and vanquishing Xiang Yu, bringing peace to the realm. He was enfeoffed as Marquis of Liu. As foretold, he found the Yellow Stone on Gucheng Mountain, treasured it, and established a shrine to honor it. In the present dynasty, the temple was further expanded, and officials are commanded to offer sacrifices annually on the eighteenth day of the third month.\n\nThe Stone Spirit’s temple lies east of the prefectural city of Lianzhou. Legend tells of a fisherman who, while at sea, saw a large stone floating on the tide. Sensing its divinity, he prayed, \"If I catch fish as I wish, I shall build a shrine in gratitude.\" His wish was granted, so he hoisted the stone and set off home to discuss where to erect the temple. At Yangmei Mountain, the rope suddenly snapped, and the stone could not be moved further. There, at the spot where the rope broke, he cleared the brush, raised pillars, and built a shrine. Since then, prayers for rain or drought relief have always been answered. A traveler once passed the temple and inscribed a poem on its wall:\n\n*A giant turtle’s hand cleft chaos wide,*\n*The sacred stone stands firm where heaven meets tide.*\n*In summer’s sixth moon, yin’s cold snow flies,*\n*While dragons and oysters dance ‘neath weeping waves’ cries.*\n\nThe Divine Stones of Chu Xiong\nThere are two in Chu Xiong. One lies five *li* west of Nan’an Prefecture, a colossal stone over ten *zhang* tall. The Meng clan called it the *God of the Southern Marchmount, the Spirit Who Pacifies the Frontier*, and the locals annually place gold on its summit, their prayers invariably answered. The other stands atop Lumo Mountain, thirty *li* southwest of Chu Xiong County, resembling a human figure, about eight *chi* tall, its crown jutting like a slanted hat. The locals affix gold to its face and revere it with great care. An ancient poem reads:\n\n*Who knows beyond the Golden Horse and Green Rooster’s reign,*\n*Where mist-wreathed peaks coil in the wild frontier’s domain?*\n\nBeneath the shadowed cliffs, the snow of primal ages lingers still,\nWhile the divine stone stands—through ten thousand autumns, steadfast, chill.\n\n**Stone Tortoise**\nIn the Rulin Township of Xingguo County, there lies a stone round as a tortoise, its neck and shell complete, its form faintly resembling the Eight Trigrams. Its appearance shifts with the moon’s phases, its \"dipper\" turning with the stars. The locals suspected it of being an omen and moved it elsewhere, yet the next day it returned to its place. This occurred repeatedly, so they began to offer seasonal sacrifices to it.\n\n**Bell Spirit**\nSeven *li* south of Lianzhou’s city, waters surge and carve a deep expanse, linking rivers to the sea. In times of drought, villagers often pray for rain here. Legend tells that during the Song’s Zhenghe era, a bell from Lingjue Temple vanished one night. The temple monks heard only thunderous roars and knew not where the bell had gone. At dawn, the bell suddenly descended from the sky, still damp. From then on, residents near the bay claimed that every night, the sound of a bell rang from its depths, as if battling dragons. The monks chiseled away the \"dragon horns\" atop the bell, and the clashes ceased. Later, the bay was named Bell Bay. Even now, when fierce winds rage through its waters, an object—vast as a cartwheel, indigo-black—rises from the waves’ heart, hovering as if weightless. Those who recognize it say it is the Bell Spirit.\n\n**Horse Spirit**\nThe spirit’s name is *Bu*, and it brings disaster to horses. The people built a temple to worship it.\n\nPer the *Rites of Zhou*, the *xiaoren* conducted winter sacrifices to the Horse Spirit *Bu*, which is this very entity. Thus, its annotation states: \"The Horse Spirit *Bu* is the deity that brings disaster to horses.\" A temple stands on Liangzi Lake south of Wuchang County. Former customs dictated sacrifices in the second month at the great marsh on a *gang* day, but now the county’s people generally hold their offerings on the fifth day of the fifth month during the dragon-boat races. This, too, is said to be an old Wu custom. An ancient poem reads:\n\nThe palaces of the Wu king crumble into flying dust,\nWhile wild birds and hidden blossoms each claim their spring.\nBy Liangzi Lake, the warhorses of old remain—\nEven now they roar, haunting the people of Wuchang.\n\n**Green Snake Spirit**\nA shrine stands in Huanzhou of Qingyang Prefecture. Early temple records state that during the Tang, when Regional Commander Yang Chaochen encamped at Fangqu to build a fortress, he felled trees along the road to block the Tubo advance. Parched for water, he saw a green snake descend a perilous slope, and where its trail led, water began to flow. Chaochen ordered a dam built to encircle the spot, forming a deep pool where his troops drank their fill. The Tubo, seeing this, withdrew in full retreat. Chaochen marveled greatly and reported the event to the court. An imperial edict ordered a shrine built to honor the spirit, naming the spring *Yingsheng* (\"Responding to the Sacred\"). The deity’s manifest efficacy led people far and near to offer livestock and silk, and many relied on its aid for relief from drought, flood, illness, and plague.\n\n**Golden Horse and Azure Fowl**\nThese are two spirits. The Golden Horse Spirit’s temple lies west of Golden Horse Mountain, while the Azure Fowl Spirit’s temple stands east of Azure Fowl Mountain. According to records from Emperor Xuan of Han, a fangshi claimed that in Yizhou there were a Golden Horse and Azure Fowl that could be summoned through sacrifice. The emperor dispatched Wang Bao to perform the rites, but he died in Shu. Yan Shigu noted that the Golden Horse resembled a horse in form, and the Azure Fowl a fowl—indeed, Golden Horse and Azure Fowl Mountains face each other across Dianchi Lake, where ten-thousand-zhang cliffs plunge into a thousand-fathom expanse of green water. The moon’s reflection shimmers on the still waves, and clouds stretch across the peaks: one of Yunnan’s finest vistas. Thus, the two spirits dwell there, manifesting their numinous transformations.\n\nA poem by Zhang Xiongfei of the Yuan reads:\nFrom the northern palace, I bid farewell to the vermilion phoenix,\nTo gaze southward at the Azure Fowl.\nThe jade throne shifts to the purple terrace,\nWhile golden mud dampens the jasper grass.\nAfter rain, dragons return to their caves;\nWhen wind rises, tigers cross the streams.\nSeeking plum blossoms, I tread bamboo paths,\nGathering herbs, I climb pine ladders.\n\n**Golden Essence**\nGolden Essence is the essence of the planet Venus. Legend holds that during the Han, a man of Ningdu County named Zhang Jinhua had a daughter called Liying. Born with auspicious features, she could foretell the fortunes of the people. Fifteen *li* northwest of the county stood a mountain, solitary and towering, where at fifteen she entered to cultivate the Dao and attained transcendence. When Wu Yin, Prince of Changsha, heard of her and sought her hand, Liying refused. She ascended to the mountain’s heights and declared: \"Within this mountain is a stone chamber leading to a grotto-heaven. If you can tunnel through, we may meet.\" Yin dispatched troops to excavate the passage. When it opened, they saw the maiden riding a purple cloud in midair, who said: \"I am the essence of Venus, sent to govern this mountain.\" With that, she departed. Later generations named the mountain Golden Essence Mountain, and Daoists regard it as the thirty-fifth blessed land.\n\n**Fire Essence**\nBorn on the thirty-second day of the sixth month, the spirit’s surname is Song, given name Wuji, a man of the Han. From birth, he possessed divine marvels and was the essence of fire. During the Tang, Niu Sengru established a temple to him to avert fire disasters. The temple lies seven *li* east of Wuchang Prefecture’s city walls, originally called \"Lord Song’s Shrine.\" To avoid the taboo of Yang Hao’s name, it was later renamed \"Grand Constitution.\"\n\nAccording to the Tang, when Wei Jian was appointed Regional Commander of Wuchang, he dreamed before departing of a crimson-robed attendant leading dozens of followers, who bowed to him and said: \"My lord, you are about to govern Ezhu. My humble abode lies in ruins, and none but you can restore it.\" Upon arrival, he sought out Wuji’s temple and found the statue identical to the figure in his dream. He then demolished and rebuilt it. During the Shaoxing era of the Song, Prefect Wang Xin further expanded its scale.\n\nThe present dynasty has rebuilt it, and it is commonly called the \"Fire Star Hall.\" Today, all Fire Star Temples in the Jiangdong region are dedicated to this deity.\n\nChen Bao has a shrine located twenty *li* east of Baoji County in Fengxiang Prefecture. According to the *Records of the Grand Historian*, Duke Wen of Qin obtained a stone resembling a *ruo* at Beiban City in Chen Cang and enshrined it. The spirit would arrive at night, its radiance like a shooting star, descending from the southeast to gather at the shrine. When it alighted upon the city, it resembled a rooster, its cry resounding deeply. When wild pheasants called at night, a mountain ox was sacrificed in its honor, and it was named \"Chen Bao.\" A Tang poet wrote:\n\n*A river flows leisurely, fair as a maiden’s grace,*\n*Two mountains like painted brows stretch in emerald embrace.*\n*From Fufeng’s wild ford, one returns to Mount Wu’s height,*\n*As Chen Bao’s slanting sun sinks into Wei City’s light.*\n\nBlack Water General lies outside the north gate of Fengyang Prefecture’s city walls, close to the Huai River. The riverbank frequently collapsed, causing suffering to the people. During the Jiading era of the Song, a prefect named General Chai cast an iron statue of a general and inscribed it with the words: *\"By the Huai’s northern edge, at the border of Haozhou’s land, may you stand guard for ten thousand myriad years.\"* Thereafter, the river’s calamities ceased. A temple was built over the statue, and the local people vied to worship it, for prayers were always answered.\n\nWooden Gentleman.\n\nThe spirit had no name nor recorded dynasty. A wooden likeness was carved and enshrined, its temple standing twenty *li* east of Laichang County. Legend tells of a fire that burned through wood in the shape of a human figure, which split the waters and drifted ashore. Monks of the temple then enshrined it in worship.\n\nA poem by Han Yu of the Tang reads:\n*Through fire and wave it drifts, heedless of spring,*\n*Roots like a face, its trunk like a frame.*\n*By chance named \"Wooden Gentleman,\"*\n*Endless come the seekers of its grace.*\n\nIn the Song, when a county magistrate prayed for rain in vain, he ordered the statue chopped for firewood. Yet soon after, a great rain fell in abundance, sustaining the land for years. The magistrate then restored its worship and rebuilt its temple, and the spirit’s responses grew even more profound. The temple was later reconstructed in the present dynasty.\n\n**Mo Cuo Spirit**\nThe temple stands west of Shizhou Guard. According to records, the guard’s southwestern frontier borders the Luopu Man, who were rebellious and frequently raided the border. A general named Meng Shu led troops to suppress them but suffered repeated defeats. Overwhelmed, he rested among his officers, spear for a pillow, and fell asleep. In a dream, a spirit declared, *\"I am the Great King Mo Cuo. I know your battles have not gone well and wish to lend my aid.\"* Meng Shu, half-awake, bowed in gratitude. Upon waking, he still heard the clamor of blades and horses. The next day in battle, the Luopu Man scattered in disarray, as if beset from all sides, and soon surrendered in submission. From then on, the spirit’s miracles became widely known, and the people of Shi worshipped wherever they dwelled, their prayers always answered.\n\n**Yellow Demon Spirit**\nThe spirit’s dynasty, surname, and given name remain unknown. Its temple stands in Guizhou Gorge of Xingzhou Prefecture, its numinous power renowned and its blessings relied upon by the region. According to the *Universal Geography*, during the Xiantong era of the Tang, Xiao Gou, exiled from the post of Right Historian to Qiannan, passed through the Three Gorges to Zigui. In a dream, a spirit said, *\"I am the Yellow Demon Spirit, dwelling in the northwest corner of the Purple Ultimate Palace. I will aid your passage from this place.\"* Temple records also note that when Li Jifu was dismissed from his post in Zhongzhou, the gorges’ waters surged violently. Suddenly, a spirit emerged from the waves to steady his boat. When Li asked its name, it replied, *\"I am the Yellow Demon Spirit.\"* Later, when Song statesman Kou Zhun passed through Chi Rapids, a spirit likewise guided his vessel downstream. Upon inquiry, the spirit identified itself as the Yellow Demon. Such manifestations of its divine power are too numerous to record in full; only the most notable are noted here.\n\n**King Xiang**\nKing Xiang’s surname was Xiang, his given name Fu, a native of Dongyang in Guizhou.\n\nQueen Mother Xiang, née Shi, dreamed one night of a colossal star entering her hand, its radiance dazzling—she opened her mouth and swallowed it. Upon waking, she found herself with child, carrying the babe for twenty-six months before giving birth. At first, the prince could not speak, but at the age of seven or eight, upon seeing a Daoist inscribe a talisman, he suddenly clutched the man’s robe and cried out, *\"I! I! I!\"* From that moment, his speech was as fluent as a grown man’s. As he matured, his Daoist arts flourished: his incantations over water and talismanic methods were unlike any inherited tradition, yet unfailingly efficacious. After his death, he became a spirit in his birthplace, tunneling through mountains and piercing stone—vanishing into the eastern slope only to reappear on the western side, regardless of height or depth. At times, he would split open a boulder and conceal himself within, his divine manifestations too numerous to recount. The villagers erected a shrine in his honor, and whenever they prayed, their pleas were answered.\n\n**Bamboo Prince**\nThe Bamboo Prince was none other than the Marquis of Yelang. His temple stands at the foot of Dongwen Mountain, southeast of Shizhou Guard’s city. According to the *Records of Huayang*, a woman was washing clothes by the water when a three-jointed bamboo floated into her lap. Hearing an infant’s cries from within, she split the bamboo and found a boy, whom she raised. When he came of age, his martial prowess led him to declare himself King of Yelang, taking \"Bamboo\" as his surname. During Emperor Wu of Han’s pacification of the southwestern tribes, the king was slain by the Yi people, who petitioned for his line to continue. The emperor then enfeoffed the king’s three sons as marquises. After his death, the Bamboo Prince was enshrined alongside his father’s temple. In the Chongning era of the Song, the temple was granted the plaque *\"Spirit of Numinous Grace.\"* His descendants multiplied, and veneration of him grew ever more reverent. In the present dynasty’s official sacrifices, he is simply styled *\"Spirit of the King of Yelang.\"*\n\n**Panhu**\nPanhu is the Canine Spirit, progenitor of the present-day Wuling Man tribes of Changsha. His temple stands on Wushan in Luxi County. According to records, when Emperor Gaoxin was plagued by the Dog Rong tribes, he proclaimed that whoever brought him the head of their general, Wu, would be given his youngest daughter in marriage. The emperor’s dog, named Panhu, entered the mountains and returned with a severed head, which proved to be Wu’s. Overjoyed, the emperor hesitated—how could he wed his daughter to a beast? Yet the princess, hearing that a promise could not be broken, insisted on fulfilling it. Reluctantly, the emperor consented. Panhu carried the girl into a cavern in the southern mountains, where, over three years, she bore him six sons and six daughters. After Panhu’s death, the children intermarried. Their mother returned to report the matter to the emperor, who summoned them to court. Clad in motley garments and speaking a halting tongue, they were settled in the region, and their descendants proliferated—hence the Wuling Man. To this day, the local custom forbids the eating of dog meat, and Panhu’s temple remains potent with divine power.\n\n*The Fifth Scroll of* **Records of Divine Marvels** *concludes here.*\n\n*The Sixth Scroll of* **Records of Divine Marvels**\n*Table of Contents*\n\n**Heavenly Consort**\n**Silkworm Maiden**\n**Azure-Robed Deity**\n**Divine Woman**\n**White Waters’ Plain Girl**\n**Horse Immortal**\n**Holy Mother**\n**Wen Xiaotong**\n**Filial and Stalwart General**\n**Divine Grace Lady** (commonly called **Butterfly Islet Lady**)\n**Shunyi Lady**\n**Fortress General’s Lady**\n**Devout Lady**\n**Lady Yao**\n**Cao E**\n**Two Filial Maidens**\n**Five Pestilence Envoys**\n**Five Bandit Generals**\n**Plunder and Seizure Envoys**\n**Fortune-Augmenting Lord**\n**Fortune and Prosperity Gate**\n**Door Gods** (Shentu and Yulü)\n**Zhong Dao**\n**Destiny-Controlling Turtle Deity**\n**Latrine God**\n**Path-Opening Deity**\n**Statutes and Decrees** (with **Two Stone Guardians** appended)\n*Table of Contents concludes*\n\nThe Heavenly Consort was born on the twenty-third day of the third lunar month. A native of Putian, she was the daughter of Lin Yuan, a Song dynasty coastal patrol inspector. Gifted with divine insight from birth, she could foretell fortune and misfortune. After her death, the villagers erected a temple on an islet in Meizhou, which lies in the southeastern sea of Xinghua, facing the Ryukyu Kingdom. During the Xuanhe era of the Song, when Lu Yundi was sailing as an envoy to Goryeo, a violent storm arose mid-voyage, capsizing all ships except the one he rode. The goddess descended upon the mast, ensuring their safe passage. Through successive dynasties, she was enfeoffed with ever-higher titles until she became the Heavenly Consort. In the Hongwu and Yongle reigns of our present dynasty, she was twice granted additional honorifics. A shrine stands within the prefectural city, where officials offer sacrifices in spring and autumn. An ancient poem reads:\n\n*\"The Dipper slants, linked to the northern sky,\nThe Penglai Isles point straight to the eastern sea.\"*\n\nIn autumn, the isles stand tall amidst pale sands,\nAt sunrise, the sea waves blaze crimson.\n\n**The Silkworm Maiden**\nIn the time of Gao Xin, there lived in Shu a maiden known as the Silkworm Girl, whose surname is lost to history. Her father was seized by raiders, leaving only his horse behind. Grieving for her father, the maiden refused to eat, prompting her mother to swear before the villagers: *\"Whoever brings my husband home shall have our daughter in marriage.\"*\n\nThe horse, hearing these words, bolted in a frenzy, leaping over fields and fences. Days later, the father returned, riding the very same steed. From then on, the horse neighed incessantly. The mother recounted her vow to the father, who replied: *\"A promise made to men is not binding to beasts. Though this horse saved me from peril—a deed of great merit—our oath cannot be fulfilled.\"*\n\nEnraged, the father sought to kill the horse, but the more he pursued, the more wildly it bucked. Finally, he shot and slew it. The hide was stretched to dry in the courtyard, but suddenly it sprang up, coiled around the girl, and carried her away. Ten days later, the hide came to rest upon a mulberry tree, where the maiden transformed into a silkworm. She fed on the leaves, spinning silk into cocoons, which clothed the people.\n\nOne day, the Silkworm Maiden descended upon a cloud, riding the horse, and spoke to her parents: *\"The Heavenly Emperor, seeing that my heart never forgot righteousness, has bestowed upon me the rank of Celestial Consort.\"*\n\n**The Azure-Robed Deity**\nThe Azure-Robed Deity is none other than Can Cong. According to tradition, Can Cong was first the Marquis of Shu, later proclaimed King of Shu. He once donned azure robes to traverse the countryside, teaching the people the art of sericulture. Moved by his virtue, the villagers erected shrines in his honor. His temples spread throughout the western lands, all famed for their divine efficacy, and the people commonly invoke him as the Azure-Robed Deity. The county of Qingshen derives its name from this legend.\n\nA poem by Xie Fangde of the Song reads:\n\n*\"To feed the mouth and clothe the body, we rely on the mulberry,\nIn the end, it fulfills the Kingly Way, its blessings flowing far.\"*\n\nThe silkworm’s thread needs no envy of the spider’s skill,\nFeeding on leaves, it urges the Weaving Maid to haste.\nThrice rising, thrice resting—its transformations follow fate,\nOne life, one death—heaven’s decree stands ever true.\nWait but to see the cocoons offered, the reeling basin prepared,\nFirst to clothe the lord and king in robes of state.\n\n**The White-Water Radiant Maiden**\nThe Radiant Maiden is a celestial deity.\n\nLong ago, a man of Min named Xie Duan, of virtuous conduct and humble dwelling, once found by the riverside a great conch lying on its back, its size like a dou measure. Marveling at it, he took it home, cherishing it as a treasure. Each time he left, he would bolt the door securely, yet upon returning, he would find meals and feasts arrayed as if for a guest. Deeply perplexed and uneasy, he sought counsel from village elders, one of whom said, “This must be due to some extraordinary creature you keep.” Then Duan realized it was the conch. He secretly watched and saw a maiden of surpassing beauty. Stepping forward, he bowed and asked her purpose. The spirit did not conceal the truth, replying, “I am the White-Water Radiant Maiden from the Celestial River. The Heavenly Emperor sent me to prepare your meals. Now my term is complete, and I must depart—hence you have seen me. I leave my shell with you as I go.”\n\nDuan used it to store grain, and the rice within was ever abundant. Today, thirty li northwest of Fuzhou lies Luojiang, named thus for this reason.\n\n**Ma the Perennial Immortal**\nThe Perennial Immortal’s surname was Ma, a native of Jingling County in Quzhou Prefecture. Though his family was poor, he served his mother-in-law with filial devotion, laboring to provide firewood and rice, enduring hardship without respite. One day, he encountered an extraordinary person who taught him immortal arts, saying, “Moved by your filial care, take this to ease your toil in providing for your mother—speak softly when using it.” Ma followed his instructions, and from then on, meals appeared without further effort, allowing his mother-in-law to live out her days in comfort. Soon after, Ma himself departed this world in tranquil repose. The villagers, honoring him, built a shrine to perpetuate his worship. Prayers there were often answered, whether for relief from flood, drought, or pestilence, as if by divine rotation. There is a stele inscription by Li Yangbing, as well as a record by the Ming dynasty’s Duke of Sincerity, Liu Ji, on the restoration of Ma the Perennial Immortal’s temple.\n\n**The Sagely Mother**\nThe Sagely Mother was from Hailing. In her youth, she married a man of the Du clan. Naturally inclined toward goodness, she studied immortal arts under Master Liu Gang. Upon achieving the Dao, her husband refused to believe her and reported her to the authorities, who imprisoned her. Shortly after, the Sagely Mother slipped through a crack in the cold cell and ascended into the clouds. The people built a temple to honor her, where offerings were met with frequent miracles. A green crow would appear at the altar, and when someone made an offering, the crow would fly off, crying as if in acknowledgment. If one inquired about a lost item, the crow would alight where the stolen goods lay. Thus, the way of honesty prevailed, and nothing was left unclaimed. In the first year of the Yuan dynasty’s Dade reign, a new temple was erected sixty li east of Jiangdu County in Yangzhou, where her efficacy grew even more renowned. In the present dynasty, she was further honored with imperial titles.\n\n**Wen Xiaotong**\n\nWen Xiaotong, surnamed Wen, was a woman of Qin. Her temple stands eighty *li* south of Xin'gan County in Linjiang Prefecture, at Xiajiang Town. According to legend, during the Qin dynasty, an old woman of the Wen clan passed by Cheng Stream and found a giant infant, whom she took into her home. She bore seven dragons and released them into the river. Whenever the old woman later came to the river’s mouth, the dragons would present her with fine fish, as if in offering or sustenance. After her death, she was buried beside Cheng Stream. When the grave was about to collapse, one night a storm of thunder, lightning, wind, and rain arose, hurling stones and sand. At dawn, people saw that the tomb had moved to a high ridge north of the bank. The villagers marveled at this and built a shrine for her. During the Tang dynasty, the temple was granted the name *Xiaotong*; Jie Si of the Yuan dynasty left an account, which also states that the old woman was a native of Yuecheng. During the Taihe era of the Tang, Lu E once dreamed of the old woman, who told him, *\"You will become the magistrate of a Jiangxi county.\"* Later, he indeed governed Fenyang and had a temple built for her; Lu Zhao recorded this.\n\n**Xiaolie General**\nThe general’s name was Mulan, a daughter of the Zhu clan of Chu. She took her father’s place in the western campaign and achieved great merit. After her death, the people built a temple for her. The Tang dynasty posthumously enfeoffed her as *Xiaolie General*. Today, temples stand on Mulan Mountain in Huangpi County and in Wan County of Baoding, both sites marked by the same divine efficacy as before. Huangpi was her homeland, while Wan was the place of her western campaign, as the saying goes. As the ancient *yuefu* poem states:\n*\"Click-clack, click-clack—\nMulan weaves at the door.\"*\n\nThe shuttle’s clack no longer sounds—\nonly the maiden’s sighs are heard.\nLast night she saw the military writ,\nas the Khan mustered his great host.\nTwenty scrolls of conscription rolls,\neach scroll bore her father’s name.\nHer father had no grown son,\nand Mulan no elder brother.\nShe vowed to buy saddle and horse,\nand from that day take her father’s place in war.\n\n**Lady of Numinous Grace**\nThe lady’s surname was Sun, younger sister of Sun Quan, King of Wu, and descendant of Emperor Zhaolie of Shu-Han. Legend tells that Quan, employing Zhou Yu’s stratagem, feigned to welcome the empress dowager in Jingzhou. As their boat neared Digang, she saw through the ruse and drowned herself in the river. Another account claims she heard of Emperor Zhaolie’s death and, grief-stricken, threw herself into the Yangtze. Later generations built a temple atop Niaoji Mountain, where her remains were interred—now the site west of Wuhu County. Her divine efficacy became widely renowned. When our Taizu, the August High Emperor, crossed the river at Jingjiang with his forces, she aided him unseen. After ascending the throne, he enfeoffed her as *Lady of Numinous Grace*, restored her temple, and inscribed a regulated verse of his own composition upon its lintel. Poets and scholars have since left countless verses in her praise. To this day, she remains a marvel of the great river, her divine responses ever more potent than before.\n\n**Lady of Serene Virtue**\nAccording to the *Miscellaneous Records of Fengjing*, during the Dali era of the Tang, there lived in Gutian County, Min, a girl of the Chen clan. From birth, she was exceptionally gifted, able to foretell events with unfailing accuracy. In play, she would cut paper into kites and butterflies, sprinkle them with water, and watch them dance and flutter. She could carve wood into oxen and horses a foot long, then command them with a shout to move or halt, and they obeyed as if alive.\n\nThe girl’s appetite was extraordinary—when joyful, she could consume a *sheng* or *dou* of food at once, yet at other times, she would abstain from grain for days without discomfort. The villagers marveled at her, and even her parents could not restrain her. She died unwed, and her spirit began to speak through children. The locals consulted her on matters of drought, flood, fortune, and misfortune, and her words never failed to prove true. Thus, they built a temple in her honor. During the Song, she was enfeoffed as the **Lady of Serene Virtue**, and her divine manifestations multiplied. To this day, she is widely worshipped across the Eight Min regions.\n\n**The Fortress General’s Lady**\nThe lady, surnamed Yu, has a temple on Mazhai Ridge in Yingde County. According to old accounts, during the late Tang, when Huang Chao sacked Hengzhou in the west, Lady Yu donned armor and led her brothers and local militia in battle. Huang Chao’s rebels were routed, and Lady Yu perished in the fight. The villagers built a temple at the site of her death, and her spirit proved remarkably responsive. During the Jiatai era of the Song, a rebel general passed through Mazhai Ridge with his troops when suddenly wind, thunder, rain, and hail erupted from the temple. Terrified, the rebels cast aside their armor and fled, sparing the village from harm. The court, upon hearing of the event, bestowed the temple plaque *Numinous Aid*. In the Jiading era, when another minor disturbance arose, the local militia prayed at the temple before engaging the enemy and achieved three victories in a single day, causing the rebels to disperse. She was further enfeoffed as the **Lady of Upright Obedience, Manifest Protection**. Lin Zisheng composed an account of her deeds. By the end of the Song, when the Yuan forces ravaged the land, Yingde and its surroundings alone remained unscathed—many attributed this to the lady’s divine power.\n\n**The Lady of Sincere Reverence**\nThe lady, née Xian, was a native of Gaodong and the wife of Feng Bao, the Tang-era Prefect of Gaozhou. When the Sui pacified the Chen dynasty in the south, the people of Lingnan unanimously acclaimed Lady Xian as their leader. She defended the region before eventually submitting to the Sui. Later, when Li Qianshi, the Prefect of Gaozhou, and Wang Zhongxuan, the Yi chieftain of Panyu, rebelled, Lady Xian suppressed them all. She was posthumously enfeoffed as the **Lady of Qiao State**, with the posthumous title *Sincere Reverence*. Her temple stands east of Dianbai County’s seat, and branch temples exist in neighboring counties, all renowned for their divine efficacy. The Song poet Su Shi wrote:\n\n> *Feng and Xian, ancient heroines,*\n> *Ruled this land as their domain.*\n> *Their merits recorded under Liang Wu,*\n> *Their offices granted by Sui Wen.*\n> *Through three generations of peril and peace,*\n> *Their hearts remained unstained.*\n> *With silken reins, they quelled chaos,*\n> *With rhinoceros shields, they dispelled doubt.*\n\nIn the early Hongwu era of the present dynasty, she was enfeoffed as the **Lady of Gaodong Prefecture**, and sacrifices are offered to her in the second winter month.\n\n**Yao Niang**\nYao Niang, whose given name was Zhenshu, was a commoner’s daughter from Heping County during the Han. Her temple stands in Sumo Village, Boluo County, where she became a deity after her death. During the Song, when Chen Yaozuo served as acting prefect of Huizhou, he traveled with the local scholar Xu Shen. Their boat moored by the shore when suddenly a hundred armored figures appeared, issuing stern commands: “Tonight, the Prime Minister and the Transport Commissioner will lodge here.” Yaozuo found this strange, for even the slightest negligence would be unacceptable. The next day, he inquired about the place and discovered Yao Niang’s temple there. Later, Yaozuo became Prime Minister, and Xu Shen was appointed Transport Commissioner of the region—just as foretold. To the west of Boluo, during the Liang, a girl of the Chen clan lost her father, Yingzhi, at eighty. She was his only child, and her grief was so profound that she too perished. The villagers sculpted her likeness and built a temple in her honor. During the Han, she was enfeoffed as the **Lady of Prosperous Blessings**, and her spirit proved highly efficacious in prayers for rain.\n\n**Cao E**\nCao E, a native of Shangyu, was the daughter of Cao Xu, a musician and shaman. During the Han An era, on the fifth day of the fifth month, her father drowned while welcoming the deity in the tidal waters of the county river, and his body was never recovered. Fourteen-year-old Cao E wept along the riverbank day and night without cease. After seventeen days, she threw herself into the river and drowned. During the Yuanjia era, a temple was built for her east of Shaoxing Prefecture’s city walls. Guo Ziyou of the commandery composed the stele inscription, and Cai Yong inscribed the words: *Yellow silk, young woman, grandson’s mortar*—referring to this very temple. Her divine efficacy became widely renowned, and the people never ceased their worship. Another girl from the same county, Zhu E, was raised by her grandmother. When a villager attempted to kill the grandmother, ten-year-old Zhu E rushed forward to shield her and was stabbed over a dozen times before dying. Her likeness was later enshrined alongside Cao E’s.\n\n**The Two Filial Daughters**\nThe filial daughters were natives of the Tang era, daughters of Ge You of Jinxī. The county had a silver mine managed by a supervisor who pressed Ge You for repayment when the silver ran out. Unable to bear their father’s torment, the two daughters threw themselves into the smelting furnace and died. Their father was released, and the mine was closed. Later, a young scholar studying at Cuiyun Temple in the county was awakened at the third watch by the bright, cloud-dappled moonlight. He heard the sound of flutes and pipes approaching from the northwest. Opening the door, he saw auspicious clouds and mist swirling, with an entourage of banners and canopies like those of an imperial consort. Two immortal maidens sat serenely within. The scholar quickly retreated, but the daughters called out: “Do not fear. We are the Ge sisters. The Heavenly Emperor, praising our filial piety, has appointed us as officials of the Jade Purity Palace’s *Zhengyi* rank. We are now journeying to the Ten Continents to pay homage to the Queen Mother. Convey our regards to our family.” The scholar found this extraordinary, and the villagers built a temple in their honor, which became renowned for its divine efficacy.\n\n**The Five Pestilence Envoys**\nBorn on the third day of the ninth month, during the Sui, Emperor Wen saw five mighty warriors standing in midair, each over ten *zhang* tall, clad in robes of the five directions. One held a ladle and gourd, another a leather bag and sword, a third a fan, a fourth a hammer, and the last a fire pot. The emperor asked the court astronomer Zhang Juren: “What gods are these? What fortunes or misfortunes do they portend?” Zhang Juren replied: “These are the Five Mighty Warriors of the directions, celestial demons known as the **Five Pestilence Envoys**. Their appearance foretells plague among the people.” The emperor asked: “Can it be averted?” Juren answered: “There is no remedy.” Soon, many in the empire fell ill and died. The emperor then established a shrine and issued an edict: the warrior in the blue robe was enfeoffed as the **General of Manifest Sagacity**, the red-robed warrior as the **General of Manifest Response**, the white-robed warrior as the **General of Inspired Response**, the black-robed warrior as the **General of Inspired Completion**, and the yellow-robed warrior as the **General of Inspired Might**. Both the Sui and Tang dynasties offered sacrifices to them on the fifth day of the fifth month.\n\nThe **Five Bandit-Generals**\n\nThe Five Bandit-Generals were the five bandits who rebelled during the Yongguang era of Emperor Fei of the Song. They originally caused chaos and plundered in their native region. In the third year of Jinghe, the emperor dispatched the general Zhang Hong to crush and kill them north of Xinfeng County. Later, the five men returned as specters to haunt the land where they had died. Those who offered sacrifices to them called them the Five Bandit-Generals—what are now known as the **Bandit Deities**. Their names were: first, Du Ping; second, Li Si; third, Ren An; fourth, Sun Li; and fifth, Geng Yanzheng.\n\n---\n\n**The Exactor-Collector Envoy**\n\nThe Exactor-Collector Envoy was surnamed Pei, named Pu, and was the maternal cousin of Wei Yuanfang of Duling. Pu served as the magistrate of Xinping County in Hezhou. In the fifth year of Yuanhe, he died in office. In the early years of Changqing, Yuanfang failed the imperial examination and traveled as a guest in Longyou. After journeying several dozen *li* beyond the Kaiyuan Gate, he arrived at a roadside inn to rest. He saw a military officer on horseback approaching, followed by dozens of riders, whose appearance resembled Pu. Upon seeing Yuanfang, the officer seemed to recognize him and hastily dismounted to avoid him. He entered the tea house and concealed himself behind a curtain in a small room, while his attendants sat scattered outside the curtain. Yuanfang grew suspicious and also entered the inn. When he lifted the curtain to enter, he saw that it was indeed Pei Pu.\n\nYuanfang, surprised and delighted, bowed and said: “Brother, you have departed the human realm—why have you taken up a military post here? Is the underworld’s bureaucracy so strict?” Pu replied: “I serve as an official of the netherworld, overseeing military affairs, hence the martial attire.” Yuanfang asked: “What is your position?” Pu answered: “I am the Exactor-Collector Envoy of Longyou and Xichuan.” Yuanfang asked: “What do you oversee?” Pu said: “My duty is to seize surplus wealth from people.”\n\nYuanfang asked: “What is surplus wealth?” Pu explained: “When people trade goods or beg for alms, their fate decrees what they should receive. If they suddenly encounter rare goods or the owner deeply values what they obtain, the amount may exceed the destined sum. This excess is called surplus wealth, and thus I seize it.” Yuanfang asked: “How do you know it is surplus and seize it?” Pu said: “Every sip and bite of a person’s life is predestined—how could wealth and treasure be otherwise? The netherworld’s records limit what one may acquire. If one gains more than the destined amount, the underworld’s officials sweep in and seize the excess.”\n\nYuanfang asked: “What do you mean by ‘seize’? Do you snatch it from their purses or steal it from their bosoms?” Pu replied: “No. When the destined sum is reached, any additional wealth is manipulated by me. I may cause it to vanish, impose unexpected misfortunes, or disrupt their business so it falls short of the usual profit. It has nothing to do with them personally. In my past life, I once thought that diligent merchants gained wealth, diligent farmers gained grain, and diligent scholars gained official salaries. I lamented only that the indolent failed to obtain these. Yet now I see that shipwrecked merchants, drought-stricken farmers, and impoverished scholars—were they not diligent? Now I understand that diligence is the foundation of virtue, and learning is the root of goodness. Virtue and goodness are the true principles of self-cultivation—they are not means to seek wealth or official rank.\n\nOur meeting today was also predestined. You were meant to receive two *jin* of silver, but if I were to give it to you, it would be seized again. Thus, I dare not enrich you too much on this journey.” He then presented a generous gift but divided it sparingly at Jing, leaving Yuanfang with little. “Human life is governed by fate, and timing does not err. Observe all things with equanimity and remain untroubled. Strive onward.” Pu then had official business to attend to in the city. The netherworld’s affairs were dark and secretive, leaving no time for further conversation. He departed slowly.\n\n---\n\n**The Duke of Augmented Blessings**\n\nThe Duke of Augmented Blessings, surnamed Li and named Gui Zu, managed the affairs of the prime minister’s office during the reign of Emperor Wen of Wei. By day, he adjudicated disputes and grievances in the mortal realm; by night, he judged cases of right and wrong in the underworld. He also oversaw the clothing, food, and salaries of officials of the third rank and above, as well as the annual allotment of provisions for the living. In the first year of Tiancheng during the Later Tang dynasty, Emperor Mingzong posthumously bestowed upon him the title **Duke of Augmented Blessings**. He is born on the seventeenth day of the ninth month.\n\n---\n\n**The Gate of Blessings and Emoluments**\n\nThe Gate of Blessings and Emoluments refers to the prefect of Daozhou, Yang Cheng, whose courtesy name was Xi. Emperor Wu of Han favored the dwarfs of Daozhou, using them as palace slaves for amusement. Every year, hundreds of boys were selected from the region, forcing parents to part with their children. When Prefect Yang governed the commandery, he submitted a memorial to the emperor, stating: “According to the local records, our land has only dwarfs, not dwarf slaves.” Emperor Wu was moved and ceased the selections. The people of the commandery, grateful, built a shrine and enshrined his image, venerating him as the **Fortune Deity** of their region.\n\nThe literati and common folk across the land later painted his likeness and revered him as the **Deity of the Gate of Blessings and Emoluments**.\n\n**Door Gods**\nThe Door Gods are the two Tang generals, Qin Shubao and Hu Jingde. According to tradition, Emperor Taizong of Tang suffered from disturbances outside his bedchamber—bricks and tiles hurled about, ghosts and demons wailing—so that the Six Palaces and Three Courts knew no peace by night. Frightened, the emperor informed his ministers. Shubao memorialized: “I have slain men as easily as breaking dry reeds, piled corpses like ants in heaps—what fear have I of petty ghosts? I beg to stand guard with Jingde in full armor.” The emperor approved his request, and that night, no disturbances occurred. Pleased, Taizong remarked that the two had kept vigil without sleep, and ordered court painters to depict them in full regalia, hair bristling with fury as in life, and hang the portraits on either side of the palace gates. Thus, malevolent spirits were quelled. Later generations followed this custom, and they have since remained the Door Gods. As a *Xiyou Ji* verse has it:\n*“Once heroes and stalwart ministers of old,\nA thousand years they’ve been called ‘Household Guards,’\nTen thousand ages they’ve served as Door Gods.”*\n\n**Shentu and Yulü**\nOn Mount Dushuo in the Eastern Sea stands a great peach tree, its gnarled branches spanning three thousand *li*. Its lower boughs face the northeast, known as the **Ghost Gate**, through which all ghosts pass.\n\nThere are two spirits: one named **Shentu**, the other **Yulü**, who oversee and govern the comings and goings of all ghosts, seizing them to feed to tigers. The Yellow Emperor emulated this and established the custom of placing peachwood boards. As its origins trace back to the Yellow Emperor, later generations carved spirit images upon the branches and inscribed beneath them: \"Shentu on the left, Yulü on the right,\" setting them at doorways on New Year’s Day.\n\n**Zhong Kui**\nDuring the Kaiyuan era of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, while reviewing troops at Mount Li, the emperor fell ill upon returning to the palace. In broad daylight, he dreamed of a small ghost in crimson robes and calf-nose trousers, one foot shod and the other bare, who stole a large embroidered incense pouch and the emperor’s jade flute, darting playfully around the hall. The emperor shouted in rebuke, and the small ghost replied, “Your servant is *Xuhao* (Vain Depletion).” The emperor asked, “What is *Xuhao*?” The ghost answered, “I steal from people in empty air and deplete their households’ joyous affairs.” Enraged, the emperor called for his guards, when suddenly a great ghost—wearing a tattered hat, blue robe, angular belt, and court boots—first gouged out the small ghost’s eyes, then tore and devoured it. The emperor asked who he was, and the ghost replied, “Your servant is Zhong Kui, a scholar from Mount Zhongnan. Having failed the imperial examination, I returned home in shame, struck my head against the palace steps, and died. By imperial decree, I was buried in a green robe, and in gratitude for the sacrifices offered, I rid the world of *Xuhao* and malevolent spirits for Your Majesty.” With these words, the dream ended, and the emperor’s illness vanished. He then ordered Wu Daozi to paint Zhong Kui’s likeness.\n\n**The Controller of Fate**\nBorn on the third day of the eighth month, this deity is surnamed Zhang, named Shan, styled Ziguo, and appears as a beautiful woman. His wife is styled Qingji, and they have six daughters, all named Cha—collectively the Six Gui Women. They record human transgressions: major offenses cost two to three hundred days of one’s lifespan, minor ones one to two hundred days, thus serving as the overseers of Heaven and Earth. When performing rituals for this deity, place the altar at the center of the room, facing west. Arrange four sides of the altar nine inches from the cauldron, constructing it with broad planks and fine soil, ensuring no cracks or breaks. The altar spirit died on the *renzi* day; do not perform rituals on this day. On the *chen* day of the fifth month, sacrifice a pig’s head to the altar to bring ten-thousandfold prosperity. Chicken feathers entering the altar invite misfortune; dog bones entering it produce mad offspring. On the *jisi* day of the first month, sacrifice a white chicken to the altar for timely blessings. On the *jichou* day of the fifth month, sacrifice to the altar for good fortune. On the *dingsi* day of the fourth month, sacrifice to the altar for good fortune. The deity wears yellow robes and unbound hair, emerging from the altar. Knowing his name and invoking it can dispel misfortune.\n\n**The Toilet God**\nThe Toilet God was a girl from Laiyang County surnamed He, named Xu, styled Liqing, who read widely and spoke eloquently from childhood. In the third year of the Chuigong era of Tang, Li Jing, the prefect of Shouyang, took her as a concubine. His wife, consumed by jealousy, secretly killed her and hid her body in the toilet. Her spirit lingered, and those using the toilet often heard weeping. At times, she appeared faintly, brandishing weapons and shouting. From then on, she displayed extraordinary spiritual power. People prayed to her corpse, and she descended upon a suspended winnowing basket, foretelling fortune and misfortune. As she died on the fifteenth day of the first month, her manifestations are most potent during that month.\n\n**The Road-Opening Spirit**\nThis deity is the *Fangxiangshi* of the *Rites of Zhou*. Legend holds that when the Yellow Emperor traversed the Nine Heavens, his primary consort, Leizu, died on the road. He ordered his secondary consort, Haoru, to oversee her, hiring an assistant to guard against nighttime disturbances—thus its origin. Commonly called the Perilous Path Spirit, it is also known as the Field-and-Path General or the Road-Opening Spirit.\n\n**Lüling (Law-Command)**\nThe swift runners of the Thunder Department, as fast as thunder itself, are invoked in talismanic incantations with the phrase: “Swiftly, swiftly, as law commands.”\n\n**The Two Guardian Spirits**\nEmperor Ming of Wei cast two bronze figures called *Xi Zhong* and placed them outside the Gate of the Minister of War. According to ancient records, the appearance of a tall person foretold the nation’s fall. When a giant was seen at Lintao, it heralded Qin’s downfall. The First Emperor, however, deemed it auspicious and cast bronze statues in its likeness.\n\nOn an auspicious day of the Lantern Festival in the *dingwei* year of the Wanli era (1607), Zhang Guoxiang, the Orthodox Successor of the Zhengyi Tradition, Supreme Perfected of Profound Dao, Grand Master of the Propagation of Teachings, and Overseer of Daoist Affairs Under Heaven, by imperial decree oversaw the printing.\n\n*Soushen Ji*, Scroll Six (concluded)",

      "translated_text": "**Soushen Ji**\n\n**Title:** *Soushen Ji* (*Records of Spirits Investigated*). Six juan. Likely compiled during the Ming dynasty. Base text from: *Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon*.\n\n**Preface to the Soushen Ji**\n\nWhat does one guard against in spirits? They are the essences of the myriad things. They enact the Dao for the people, toil to stabilize the state, diligently serve in governance, defend against calamities, and manifest as wondrous phenomena in mountains, forests, rivers, valleys, and hills—where clouds arise, winds and rains form, and strange beings appear. All these are called *shen* (spirits). Their *qi* ascends and flourishes above, becoming radiant light, the rustling of reeds, and mournful cries.\n\nThe rites of sacrifice honor the spirits of all under heaven, for they are held in great reverence. In former times, Yu Changshi of Xincai compiled a *Soushen Ji* in thirty juan. Liu Dan, upon seeing it, remarked: \"Ghosts are to the people of Jin what Dong Hu was to history—a faithful recorder. Yet a thousand years have passed, and even the finest editions have crumbled. Though some survive in fragments, barely a tenth remains, and even these are riddled with omissions, inviting endless criticism.\"\n\nI, unworthy as I am, have long wandered in pursuit of livelihood, traversing Yan and Que, exploring the lands of Zou and Lu, journeying through Qi and Liang, and descending into the regions of Wu, Chu, Ou, and Yue. Everywhere I went, I delved into the boundaries of the numinous and the divine, encountering marvels without end, all of which I have meticulously recorded.\n\nIn the *guisi* year of the Wanli reign’s first era (1593), I arrived in the auxiliary capital and, while perusing books and records, obtained a copy of the *Soushen Ji* from Sanshan Fuchun Hall. Upon reading it, I found that its carvings were organized by category and volume, each accompanied by illustrations—a quality I, in my inadequacy, could not match. What I had previously seen paled in comparison; this edition neither slavishly followed the old nor merely expanded upon it. Instead, it captured what was previously obscure, filled what was lacking, and achieved a brilliance truly worthy of the spirits.\n\nIts essence lies in fostering blessings for the people and upholding the imperial realm for ten thousand generations. Could even one as unworthy as I fail to feel the same admiration in my heart as Liu Jun did for Dong Hu?\n\nAlas, the realms of the unseen and the visible are intertwined! Spirits endure in memory only through their numinosity, and records preserve their numinosity for posterity. Those who wear towering caps and trailing sashes, who command respect and protection, are rightly called *shen*. Yet if their lives and deeds, like grass and wood, rot into oblivion, leaving no trace in the annals of history, how could this be just?\n\n**Soushen Ji, Juan One**\n\n**Table of Contents**",

His great-grandfather, Kong Fangshu, fled the turmoil of Hua Du’s rebellion in Song and resettled in Lu, where he fathered Bosha. Bosha begot Shuliang He, whose eldest son, Meng Pi (styled Boniu), was afflicted with illness and unfit to inherit. His second son was the Ultimate Sage.\n\nIn the twenty-first year of Duke Xiang of Lu, on the winter solstice of the tenth month (gengzi day), the Ultimate Sage was born. That night, two dragons encircled the chamber, and the Five Elders descended into the courtyard—the Five Elders being the essences of the five planets. His mother, Lady Yan, dreamed of the celestial music of *Goutian*, and a voice resounded from the void: *\"Heaven, moved, gives birth to a sagely son,\"* accompanied by the harmonious strains of reed pipes and flutes. His head bore a protuberance at the crown, hence his name *Qiu* (\"Mound\"), styled *Zhongni*.\n\nOrphaned in youth, he buried his father on Mount Fang. The Ultimate Sage stood nine *chi* and two *cun* tall, his waist spanning ten *wei*. His forty-nine garments draped backward, his head inclined forward, his face bearing the marks of the moon and sun. Seated, he resembled a crouching dragon; standing, a perched phoenix. From afar, he appeared unrefined; up close, towering. His ears hung like pearls, his forehead broad as a tortoise’s shell, his form dragon-like, his palms tiger-like, his cheeks full, his chest ample, his eyes like rivers, his mouth vast as the sea, his navel deep as a mountain, his back broad as a forest, his arms winged, his lips like a tadpole’s, his head sloping, his nose tortoise-like, his complexion rich, his brows like embankments, his feet grounded, his voice thunderous, his abdomen expansive, his countenance radiant, his cheeks luminous, his teeth aligned like a steed’s. His brows bore twelve hues, his eyes sixty-four patterns. His head resembled Yao’s, his forehead Shun’s, his beard Gaoyao’s, his shoulders Zichan’s. From the waist down, he fell three *cun* short of Yu. Possessing the virtue of a great sage, his learning encompassed heaven and humanity, his Dao plumbed the profound and arcane. He mastered the scriptures borne by tortoises and dragons, the affairs of the Seven Governors and Five Wefts, the arts of Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor, and the virtues of Yao, Shun, and the Duke of Zhou.\n\nDuke Ding of Lu appointed him Magistrate of Zhongdu. Within a year, the feudal lords of the four directions emulated his governance. In the ninth year, he became Prefect of Yi; in the tenth, Minister of Works; and in the eleventh, Grand Minister of Justice, acting as Chancellor. In the fourteenth year, he executed Shaozheng Mao, a Lu minister who had disrupted governance. After three months of overseeing state affairs, the markets saw no haggling over prices, men and women walked separate paths, and lost items remained unclaimed on the roads. Visitors to the capital required no official summons—they were all received and sent off with propriety.\n\nAfter fourteen years away from Lu, in the eleventh year of Duke Ai, the Ultimate Sage returned and edited the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*, codified the *Rites* and *Music*, and completed the Six Arts. In his later years, he delighted in the *Book of Changes*, plumbing its mysteries of heaven and earth. He composed the *Tuanzhuan*, *Xiangzhuan*, *Wenyan*, and *Xici* to elucidate its secrets. To his disciples at the southern bank of the Wei and northern bank of the Si, he imparted his teachings. His disciples numbered three thousand, with seventy-two who attained mastery and sixty thousand who achieved broad learning.\n\nBefore the Ultimate Sage’s birth, a qilin appeared in Queli, spitting forth a jade tablet inscribed: *\"Son of the Water Essence’s lineage, a plain-clothed king in Zhou’s decline.\"* Lady Yan, astonished, struck the qilin’s horn with an embroidered sash. By dawn, the qilin had vanished. In the fourteenth year of Duke Ai, during a western hunt at Taiye, Shusun’s charioteer, Chu Shang, captured a strange beast, deeming it inauspicious. The Ultimate Sage examined it and said, *\"It is a qilin. Why has it come?\"* He turned his sleeve to wipe his face, his tears staining his lapels. Only then did Shusun retrieve it, finding the sash still tied to its horn. The Ultimate Sage sighed, *\"My Dao is exhausted.\"* He then composed the *Spring and Autumn Annals* based on Lu’s chronicles, infusing praise and censure to convey the mandate of restoration. The qilin’s appearance heralded heaven’s decree—an omen of the Ultimate Sage’s passing.\n\nOn his sickbed, the Ultimate Sage dreamed he stood between the pillars of a hall. Zigong sought an audience, and the Sage said, *\"You, carrying a staff, wander leisurely at the gate. Why have you come so late, Ci?\"* He sighed, *\"Is Mount Tai collapsing? Is the ridgepole crumbling? Is the wise man withering?\"* Tears streamed down his face. Zigong replied, *\"The world has long been without the Dao. None could revere you.\"* Seven days later, he passed away at the age of seventy-three. In the sixteenth year of Duke Ai, on the summer solstice of the fourth month (jichou day), he was buried in the Zhuang district of Lu’s capital. In the eleventh year of Duke Ai, a temple was erected at his former residence, with a hundred households assigned to guard his tomb. His disciples observed three years of mourning, then parted ways, weeping until their grief was spent. Some lingered, but only Zigong remained by the tomb for six years before departing. His disciples enshrined the Ultimate Sage’s robes, cap, zither, carriage, and writings in the temple. The people of Lu and his disciples built over a hundred chambers around his tomb, naming it the Kong Clan’s Eternal Abode. Sacrifices were offered at the tomb in perpetuity, with descendants inheriting the lineage without interruption.\n\nThe sagely dynasty revered him, posthumously bestowing the title *Ultimate Sage, Cultured and Propagating King*. His wife was honored as *Lady of Deng State*, his father as *Duke of Qi*, and his mother as *Grand Lady of Lu*.\n\n---\n\n**Lineage of the Shi Tradition**\n*Birthday: The Eighth Day of the Fourth Month*\n\nŚākyamuni Buddha, of the *kṣatriya* caste, was born to King Śuddhodana and Queen Māyā. Before descending to the human realm, he resided in Tuṣita Heaven as the *bodhisattva* *Vijaya* (Victorious), also known as *Rāhula* (Guardian of Light). He expounded the *bodhisattva* path to the heavenly hosts and manifested in the ten directions to preach the Dharma.",

      "translated_text": "The *Sūtra of Universal Radiance* states: When the Buddha was first born into the *kṣatriya* royal house, he emitted a great light of wisdom that illumined the ten directions. Golden lotuses surged from the earth to naturally support his feet. He strode seven steps in each of the four directions—east, west, south, and north—then raised a finger toward heaven and earth, roaring like a lion: \"Above, below, and in the four quarters, none is my equal.\" This occurred in the twenty-fourth year of King Zhao of Zhou, the *jiayin* year, on the eighth day of the fourth month.\n\nBy the forty-second year of his reign, on the eighth day of the third month, the Buddha was nineteen years old. Contemplating his future, he thought, \"When shall I encounter the right time?\" Observing the four gates, he witnessed four kinds of suffering—birth, aging, sickness, and death—and his heart filled with sorrow and resolve. He reflected, \"This cycle of old age, illness, and death is truly to be renounced.\" That night, at midnight, a deva named *Zhengju* appeared at his window, clasped his hands, and addressed the prince: \"The time for leaving home has come; you may depart.\" Overjoyed, the prince immediately leapt over the city walls and retreated to Mount Dantig to cultivate the Dao.\n\nFirst, he studied the \"state of neither perception nor non-perception\" under *Ārāḍa Kālāma* for three years, but recognizing its inadequacy, he abandoned it. He then went to *Udraka Rāmaputra* and studied the same state for another three years, only to discard it as well. Next, he journeyed to Elephant Head Mountain, where he practiced with other ascetics, subsisting on sesame and wheat for six years. As the scriptures say: \"With no-mind and no-reliance, he subdued all external paths.\" Having tested heterodox methods and demonstrated various expedient means, he dispelled divergent views and attained bodhi.\n\nThus, the *Sūtra of Universal Assembly* records: On the eighth day of the second month, as the morning star appeared, the bodhisattva attained buddhahood and became the *Teacher of Gods and Humans* at the age of thirty. This was the third year of King Mu of Zhou, the *guiwei* year. Thereafter, at Deer Park, he turned the Dharma wheel of the Four Noble Truths for Kauṇḍinya and four others, expounding the fruits of the path. He taught for forty-nine years, then addressed his disciple Mahākāśyapa: \"I now entrust to you the pure Dharma-eye, the wondrous mind of nirvāṇa, the true mark of the non-mark, and the subtle true Dharma. You must guard and uphold it. Assist Ānanda in propagating it, ensuring it is never severed.\" He then spoke this verse:\n\nThe Dharma is originally Dharma-less,\nA Dharma-less Dharma is also Dharma.\nNow, entrusting the Dharma-less,\nHow could Dharma ever be Dharma?\n\nHaving spoken this verse, the World-Honored One further instructed Mahākāśyapa: \"I now transmit to you this golden-thread *saṃghāṭī* robe. Pass it on to the next buddha-to-be until Maitreya appears in the world. Do not let it decay.\" Mahākāśyapa, hearing the verse, prostrated at the Buddha’s feet and said: \"Excellent! Excellent! I shall obey with reverence and devotion.\"\n\nLater, the World-Honored One arrived at the city of Kuśinagara and addressed the great assembly: \"I now suffer back pain and wish to enter nirvāṇa.\" He proceeded to the banks of the Ajitavatī River, beneath a pair of *śāla* trees. Lying on his right side with feet stacked, he entered tranquil extinction. He then arose from the coffin to preach the Dharma for his mother, miraculously displaying his feet to the elders of *Vāśiṣṭha*, and spoke this verse on impermanence:\n\nAll conditioned things are impermanent,\nSubject to arising and ceasing.\nHaving ceased, their stilling is bliss.\n\nHis disciples then cremated him with fragrant firewood. After the flames subsided, the golden coffin remained intact. The assembly chanted this verse before the Buddha:\n\nHow could worldly fires burn fiercely?\nThe fire of the sages’ samādhi\nConsumes the golden-hued body of Yama.\n\nAt that moment, the golden coffin rose from its seat and soared into the sky, circling seven *tāla* trees before the fire of samādhi reduced it to ashes. Eight *hū* and four *dou* of relics were collected. This occurred on the fifteenth day of the second month in the fifty-second year of King Mu of Zhou, the *renchen* year.\n\nOne thousand seventeen years after the World-Honored One’s nirvāṇa, his teachings reached the Middle Kingdom. Emperor Ming of the Later Han dreamed of a golden figure, tall and radiant, with sun and moon light at his neck. Upon consulting his ministers, one said: \"In the West there is a deity called Buddha. Could this be whom Your Majesty dreamed?\" The emperor dispatched envoys to India to inquire about the Dao. They returned with scriptures and monks. The monks explained: \"The Buddha stands sixteen feet tall, with a golden complexion and sun-and-moon light at his neck. His transformations are boundless, and he pervades all things, greatly benefiting sentient beings.\"\n\n**Lineage of the Daoist Tradition – The Fifteenth Day of the Second Month**\n*The Sacred Birth of the Supreme Venerable Sovereign, Lord Lao of the Golden Portal*\n\nAccording to the *Scripture of the Nine True Teachings of the Primordial Lord of the Numinous Treasure*, the Dao Lord addressed the emperor: \"Before heaven and earth divided and yin and yang separated, there was boundless chaos, vast and dark, without light. Within it, the sacred and spontaneous arose, and from a hundred million myriad layers of primordial qi, the Wondrous Non-Being Sage Lord was born. His august titles include *Mysterious Non-Being Supreme Emperor* and *Primordial Celestial Worthy of Original Commencement*, also called *Heavenly Treasure Elder*.\n\nAfter nine hundred ninety-nine trillion, nine hundred ninety-nine billion, nine hundred ninety million kalpas, from a hundred million myriad layers of true qi, the Wondrous Being Sage Lord was born. He styled himself *Mysterious Being Great Emperor*, *Vacuous Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord*, also called *Numinous Treasure Elder*.\n\nAfter eight hundred eighty-eight billion, eight hundred eighty million kalpas, from a hundred million myriad layers of Dao-qi, the Chaos Sage Lord was born. His title is *Perfect Great Emperor of Myriad Transformations*, *Chaos Primordial Lord Lao*, also called *Divine Treasure Elder*.\n\nAs recorded in the *Scripture of the Sacred Records of Lord Lao*, the Supreme Venerable Sovereign dwells in the Grand Purity, the ancestral origin of primordial qi and the root of heaven and earth. Within the utmost quiescence and emptiness, before the Great Beginning and Great Commencement, he alone governed the unfolding of qi, refining essence to initiate transformation. The heavens, earth, and the Three Powers have passed through kalpas beyond reckoning. His emanations pervade worlds as numerous as motes of dust, beyond all calculation or measure.\n\nAfter the opening of heaven and earth, observing the degeneracy of the age, he established teachings in accordance with the times, serving as the imperial preceptor and instituting laws and ordinances. Sometimes he flowed through the Nine Heavens, sometimes he transmitted across the Four Seas. From the Three Sovereigns onward, successive emperors and kings all revered and upheld his teachings.\"",

It further states: The world says Laozi descended in the Yin dynasty, yet Laozi’s title originated in kalpas beyond count—most obscure, dark, distant, and remote. Before the opening of heaven and earth, he repeatedly descended as the imperial preceptor, unbroken through the ages, though none could know this.\n\nAccording to the *Biographies of Laozi*, from before the opening of heaven and earth down to Tang of Yin, he served as the teacher of kings in every generation, manifesting transformed bodies to descend into the world. In the forty-seventh year of Tang of Yin, the gengshen year, he first revealed the traces of his birth. From the Everlasting Dao Realm of the Great Clarity, he rode the essence of the sun, transforming into a pellet of five-colored dark and yellow, large as a pellet, which the Jade Maiden swallowed in her tranquil daytime slumber. She conceived and carried him for eighty-one years, until the ninth year of Wuding of Yin, the gengchen year, when he emerged from the left armpit of the Jade Maiden. Born with a white complexion, he was named Laozi. Born beneath a plum tree, he pointed to it and said, 'This is my surname.' His given name was Er, and his courtesy name Boyang.\n\nFrom the ninth year of Wuding of Yin, the gengchen year, to the ninth year of King Zhao of Qin, when he ascended westward to Kunlun, spans nine hundred and ninety-six years. According to Li Shi’s *Continuation of the Treatise on Broad Learning*: In the third year of Wude of Emperor Gaozu of Tang, a man from Jinzhou named Ji Shanxing saw a white-robed elder on Yangjiao Mountain, who called to him, saying, 'Tell the Son of Heaven of Tang that I am Lord Lao, your ancestor.' Gaozu thereupon established a temple. Emperor Gaozong later honored him as the Mysterious Origin Emperor, and Emperor Xuanzong annotated the *True Scripture of Dao and Virtue*. Today, scholars have summarized that in the two capitals and various prefectures, temples to the Mysterious Origin Emperor were established—the capital’s called the Mysterious Origin Palace, and the prefectures’ called the Purple Ultimate Palaces. Later, the Western Capital’s was renamed the Great Clarity Palace, and the Eastern Capital’s the Great Tenuity Palace, each with students in attendance. His honorific title was: Great Sage Ancestor, Supreme Highest Dao, Golden Watchtower, Mysterious Origin, Heavenly August Emperor.\n\nThe *Institutional Compilation of the Song Dynasty* records: In the sixth year of Taiping Xingguo of Emperor Zhenzong of Song, on the eleventh day of the eighth month, an edict was issued to reverently bestow the honorific title: Supreme Lord Lao, Primordial Origin, Emperor of Supreme Virtue. As for the honorific title of the Sacred Mother: In the third year of Guangze of Empress Wu of Tang, on the jiayin day of the ninth month, the Sacred Mother was posthumously honored as the Primordial Heaven Empress. The ancestral hall is in the Great Clarity Palace of Bozhou.\n\nOn the ninth day of the first month, the Jade August Thearch was born, his sacred name being Radiant and Wondrous Medicine, and his royal name Contending Virtue. At that time, the king had a queen named Treasure Moonlight. The king, having no heir, often pondered: 'Now that I am growing old without a crown prince, if my body should perish, to whom shall I entrust the altars of soil and grain and the nine ancestral temples?' Having thought thus, he immediately issued an edict to all the assemblies, ordering them to adorn the palace halls according to the various scriptural teachings, hang banners and canopies, and meticulously prepare offerings. For six periods of the day, they performed the Daoist rites and prayed to the true sages, persisting for half a year without wavering in their devotion.\n\nOne night, Queen Treasure Moonlight dreamed that the Supreme Lord Dao and the assembly of perfected beings, with golden forms and jade-like qualities, their purity contending with the brightest, rode a five-colored dragon chariot, surrounded by banners of boundless light and canopies of luminous clouds. At that time, the Supreme Lord Dao sat serenely in the dragon chariot, holding an infant. From every pore of his body emanated a hundred million rays of light, illuminating the palace halls with the hues of a hundred treasures. Preceded by banners and standards, they floated through the air and arrived. The queen’s heart filled with joy, and she reverently received them, kneeling before the Dao and addressing the Lord: 'The king has no heir. I beseech you to grant this child as the lord of the altars of soil and grain. I humbly pray for your compassion and mercy to hear and permit this.' Then the Lord Dao replied to the queen, saying, 'I specially bestow him upon you.'\n\nThe queen bowed in gratitude to the Lord Dao and received the child. Upon receiving him, she awoke from her dream and conceived. After carrying the child for a year, on the ninth day of the first month of the bingwu year, at the hour of noon, he was born in the royal palace. At the moment of his birth, his sacred radiance filled the kingdom, his form and appearance wondrous and fine, delighting all who beheld him. As a child, he was keen and wise; as he grew, he was kind and virtuous. Throughout his kingdom, he distributed all the treasures from the royal storehouses, aiding the destitute, the suffering, the widowed, the orphaned, and the solitary, those without support, the starving, the sick, and the disabled. All beings, bereft of love and harmony, sang his praises, and his transformation extended to distant lands. The world looked up to him and turned toward benevolence, and the crown prince’s father, the king, rejoiced.\n\nThereafter, the king suddenly passed away, and the crown prince, governing with humility, announced to his ministers: 'I, inheriting the throne by the Dao, now relinquish my kingdom.' He retired to the Bright and Luminous Rock Mountain to cultivate the Dao. Upon achieving perfection, he transcended this kalpa, having passed through eight hundred kalpas. He often relinquished his kingdom to be reborn as a commoner, thus severing his attachments to study the Dao. Later, for eight hundred kalpas, he practiced medicine to cure illnesses and rescue beings, bringing them peace and joy. When this kalpa ended, he passed through another eight hundred kalpas, broadly performing expedient means, revealing the treasuries of the Dao, expounding sacred scriptures, proclaiming the true transformation, disseminating divine works, aiding the state and saving the people, from the hidden to the manifest. After this, for another eight hundred kalpas, he relinquished his body and life, practicing forbearance and offering his own flesh and blood.\n\nThrough such cultivation for three thousand two hundred kalpas, he finally attained the Golden Immortal, known as the Tathāgata of Pure and Natural Awakening. The *Veritable Records of Emperor Zhenzong of Song* states: In the seventh year of Dazhong Xiangfu, in the ninth month, the emperor addressed his attending ministers, saying: 'Since the descent of the auspicious signs, I have wished for all the officials and common people of the realm to jointly bestow an honorific title upon the August King.'\"",

      "translated_text": "In the first month of the first year of Tianxi, on the day of *xinchou* marking the new moon, the Emperor proceeded to the Great Initial Hall to reverently bestow the honorific title upon the Jade August Great Heavenly Emperor: \"Supreme Venerable of Primordial Opening, Holder of the Talisman, Governor of the Calendar, Embracer of Truth, Embodying the Dao, Jade August Great Heavenly Emperor.\"\n\nRespectfully inscribing the honorific title of the Sacred Ancestor, the *Record of Divine Encounters* composed by imperial decree states: In the early Jingde era, Wang Zhongzheng encountered the True Lord of the Controller of Destinies, who transmitted the Golden Elixir Method. In the fourth year, during the eleventh month, it descended upon the true abode of Liu Chenggui. In the fifth year, the honorific title \"Celestial Worthy of the Controller of Destinies of the Nine Heavens\" was reverently bestowed.\n\nThe *Veritable Records of Emperor Zhenzong of Song* states: On the seventeenth day of the tenth month in the fifth year of Dazhong Xiangfu, the Emperor recalled that in the fourth year of Jingde, a divine person had descended to transmit the Jade Emperor’s decree, saying, \"This month, on the twenty-fourth day, your ancestor Zhao shall descend, as in the Geng Zhenyuan affair.\" On that day, the Celestial Worthy descended upon the Hall of Extended Grace. In the intercalary tenth month, on the day of *jisi*, the honorific title was augmented: \"Supreme Sacred Ancestor, Lofty Dao of the Upper Numinous, Celestial Worthy of the Nine Heavens Who Pardons and Protects Life.\"\n\n**Honorific Title of the Sacred Mother**\nThe *Collected Statutes of the Reigning Dynasty* states: On the sixth day of the third month in the first year of Tianxi, the honorific title \"August Heavenly Great Sage Empress\" was conferred upon the Sacred Mother. Previously, in the fifth year of Dazhong Xiangfu, an edict had been issued to augment the honorific title of the Sacred Ancestress, awaiting the completion of the Supreme Ultimate Abbey in Chanzhou before selecting an auspicious day for the investiture. On this occasion, Wang Dan and others performed the conferral rites.\n\n**The August Earthly Deity, Queen of the Soil**\nOn the eighteenth day of the third month, the sacred birth of the Earthly Deity occurred. Before Heaven and Earth divided, all was a chaotic unity. When the Two Modes separated and the Yin and Yang settled into their positions, the pure *qi* ascended to form the Yang Heaven, while the turbid *qi* descended to form the Yin Earth. The Yang Heaven was transmitted through the Five Supremes, with the Five Lords establishing their positions, above which the sun and moon were set, and the celestial patterns arrayed. The Yin Earth was borne through the Five Phases in mutual generation, with the Five *qi* congealing and coalescing to uphold the rivers and seas, mountains and forests, and all dwellings. Thus, Heaven is Yang and Earth is Yin; Heaven is the Father and Earth the Mother.\n\nThe world calls her the Queen of the Soil, for she is the Yellow Earth from the primordial division of Heaven and Earth, hence termed the Mother of Soil. The principal temple is located in Fenyin. During the Dazhong Xiangfu era of Emperor Zhenzong of Song, on the twenty-third day of the seventh month of that year, an edict was issued to enfeoff the August Earthly Deity, Queen of the Soil. That year, the imperial carriage proceeded to Huayin for the personal sacrifice. Today, the Temple of the Queen of the Soil in the Fanli Abbey of Yangzhou stands, before whose hall grows a single jade flower tree, its fragrance, color, branches, and leaves surpassing all ordinary species.\n\n**The Eastern August Emperor**\nThe Eastern August Emperor was profoundly versed in the *qi* of the Dao, his quiescent and tranquil essence embodying non-action. Aspiring to guide and perfect the mysterious workings that generate and transform the myriad things, he first transformed the Eastern August Perfect *qi* to give birth to Wood Lord. Upon the Azure Sea, in the Wilderness of Verdant Numinosity, Wood Lord presided over the harmonious Yang *qi* and governed the East, also styled as Lord Wang.\n\nBoth he and the Metal Mother emerged from the primordial essence of the Great Origin, their divine and profound natures taking form within the confluence of the Eastern Ford, where the pure and refined *qi* of the Great Dao coalesced. Together with the Queen Mother, they governed the Two *qi* and nurtured Heaven and Earth, shaping and fostering the myriad things. All men under Heaven, across the Three Realms and the Ten Directions, who ascend as immortals and attain the Dao, fall under his jurisdiction. Dwelling above Fangzhu, according to the *Record Beyond the Dust*, Fangzhu Mountain lies within the Eastern Sea. Its thirty-five bureaus of destiny administer the karmic rewards and retributions of the celestial and human realms. The August Emperor, as the Great Controller of Destinies, oversees them all. The mountain bears the Eastern August Terrace, where the Emperor customarily ascends on *dingmao* days to survey the four directions.\n\nAmong those who cultivate the Dao, immortals are ranked in nine grades: first, the True Kings of the Nine Heavens; second, the True Sovereigns of the Three Heavens; third, the Supreme Perfected; fourth, the Flying Celestial Perfected; fifth, the Numinous Immortals; sixth, the Perfected; seventh, the Numinous Beings; eighth, the Flying Immortals; and ninth, the Immortals. When ascending to Heaven in these ranks, they first pay homage to Wood Lord, then present themselves to the Metal Mother. Only after completing these rites may they ascend to the Nine Heavens, enter the Three Clarities, bow before the Supreme Venerable, and behold the Primordial Commencement.\n\nThus, in the early Han dynasty, four or five children were playing by the roadside. One child recited a poem: \"Donning a blue skirt, ascending to Heaven’s gate, bowing to the Metal Mother, saluting Wood Lord.\" None understood its meaning, save Zhang Liang, who bowed in reverence, saying, \"These are the jade lads of the Eastern August Lord.\"\n\nFormerly, the Primordial Commencement addressed the celestial beings of the Ten Directions, saying: \"Since I first spoke of the chaotic generation, the Two Modes have been set in motion, and the Yin and Yang have been sealed in their beginnings. The August Supreme Primordial Lord and the Eastern August Fusang Great Emperor, among others, measured the balance of water and fire and determined the kalpas.\" In the first year of Zhonghuang, the Supreme Venerable, within the Jade Clarity’s resplendent chamber and the Golden Portal’s upper palace, bestowed upon the Emperor the Precious Scripture, the Floral Chart, and the Jade Instructions, commanding him to transmit them to later learners, those whose names harmonize with truth. Thus, the *Mysterious Canon* states: \"The Eastern August does not conceal the true instructions.\"\n\n**The Purple Palace**\nThe Purple Palace is where the August Emperor evaluates the merits and conduct of immortals. Within the seas lie three islands, around which the Ten Continents are arrayed. The upper islands and three continents are Penglai, Fangzhang, and Yingzhou; the middle islands and three continents are Furong, Banyuan, and Yaochi; the lower islands and three continents are Chicheng, Xuanguan, and Taoyuan. Amidst the three islands and nine continents, standing like tripods in unity, lies the continent called the Purple Palace, situated among the three islands. It is the alternate domain of the August Emperor, where he transfers and promotes the offices of the numinous officials, assessing the merits and conduct of the host of immortals. From earthly immortals to divine immortals, from divine immortals to celestial immortals, and from celestial immortals to true sages who enter the Void and Penetrating Heavens—three promotions in all—are all governed by the August Emperor.\n\nAs for his names: \"Eastern August\" derives from the August Emperor being born of the Eastern August Perfect *qi*, ruling the Eastern Extremity and dwelling above the Eastern August. \"Purple Palace\" refers to his office in the Purple Palace, where he oversees the thirty-five bureaus of destiny and promotes the ranks of true immortals. As Yang, he presides over the East, where the nine *qi* of Lesser Yang generate and transform the myriad things. \"August Emperor\" denotes his station in the East, the honored sovereign of all heavens, the lord who shepherds the multitude of sages and the king who engenders all beings.",

      "translated_text": "The *Book of Changes* states: \"The Lord emerges from the *Zhen* trigram\"—this is the meaning. Thus, he is called the Eastern August Purple Palace Lesser Yang Emperor Lord.\n\nThe *True Teachings of the Primordial Talisman Scripture* further states: In the time before the Two Modes had divided, when the primordial chaos was vast and boundless like an egg’s yolk suspended in the dark and yellow, there naturally arose the True Person Pan Gu. Moving from antiquity to the present, he is called Pan Gu, the essence of Heaven and Earth. He styled himself the Primordial Celestial King and roamed the Void. There was also the Supreme Primordial Mother, who transformed and was born within the celestial spine. After one kalpa, the Celestial King performed the rites, and the Mother gave birth to the Heavenly Sovereign, who was titled the Supreme August of the First Era. He ruled for sixteen thousand years and received the talismanic mandate of the Primordial Celestial Venerable to become the Eastern Palace Great Emperor and Fusang Great Lord. The Eastern August Lord is also called the Primordial Yang Father. According to the immortals’ scriptures, he is sometimes called the Eastern King Lord, sometimes the Azure Lad, sometimes the Square Cauldron Lord, and sometimes the Azure Stem Lord. Though his names differ, he is the same Eastern August.\n\nIn the sixth year of the Zhiyuan era of the Sagely Dynasty, on the first day of the first month, he was bestowed the honorific title: Eastern August Purple Palace Lesser Yang Emperor Lord.\n\nThe Queen Mother of the West was born on the eighteenth day of the seventh month. The Queen Mother of the West is the Ninefold Numinous Great Wondrous Tortoise Mountain Metal Mother, also known as the Supreme Void Ninefold Radiance Tortoise Terrace Metal Mother. I am the utmost wondrous of the Western August, the supreme honored of the Profound Yin. In ancient times, when the Dao’s *qi* congealed in stillness and her formless essence dwelled in nonaction, she desired to assist the mysterious work of engendering and transforming the myriad things. First, she generated the Wood Lord from the Eastern August’s perfect *qi*. The Wood Lord was born above the Azure Sea in the Wilderness of Verdant Numinosity, presiding over the harmonious Yang *qi* and governing the East. He is also called the Eastern King Lord. Then, from the Western August’s utmost wondrous *qi*, she generated the Metal Mother. The Metal Mother was divinely born in Yi River, her surname being Zong. At birth, she soared in flight, presiding over the profound mysteries of primordial nurturance within the vast and boundless. She coalesced the pure essence of the Great Dao, forming her shape, and together with the Eastern King Lord, they governed the Two Modes, nurturing Heaven and Earth and shaping the myriad things. As the root of gentleness and compliance, she is the primordial Yin, her position corresponding to the West. She mothers and nourishes all beings. All women in the Three Realms and Ten Directions who ascend as immortals or attain the Dao are under her jurisdiction. Her abode is the Garden of Kunlun, the Park of Gentle Winds, the Ninefold Jade Radiance Profound Terrace, with the Jasper Pool to its left and the Emerald Waters encircling its right. Her five daughters are Hua Lin, Juan Lan, Qing E, Yao Ji, and Yu Zhi.\n\nIn the thirty-fifth year of King Mu of Zhou, he commanded his eight steeds to journey west on a royal progress. Arriving at Kunlun, he paid homage and offered sacrifices, presenting white jade and layered brocade to honor the Queen Mother. At that time, the Queen Mother feasted King Mu at the Jasper Pool with treasures, purple palace nectar, and the elixirs of the Nine Heavens. On the seventh day of the seventh month, she descended to the palace of Emperor Wu of Han. The Queen Mother presented seven flat peaches, having already eaten two herself. The Emperor wished to keep the remaining ones, but the Mother said: \"These peaches do not exist in the mortal world; they bear fruit once every three thousand years.\" Suddenly, Dongfang Shuo peeked through the window. The Mother pointed at him and said: \"This child has already stolen my peaches three times.\" On that day, she commanded her attendant Dong Shuangcheng to play the cloud-harmonizing flute, Wang Zideng to strum the jade zither, Xu Feiqiong to strike the numinous zither, and An Faxing to sing the mysterious hymn, offering blessings to Emperor Wu.\n\nThe Eastern King Lord is said to play pitch-pot with the Jade Maiden. When the arrow misses and fails to be caught, Heaven laughs, opening its mouth—this is the flowing light now seen as lightning.\n\nThe Supreme August of the First Rank of the Upper Prime\nThe Supreme August of the First Rank of the Nine *Qi* Celestial Palace, the Purple Tenuity Great Emperor, is formed from the *qi* of the life-extending talisman and the beginning Yang. Dwelling in the Primordial Yang’s Seven Treasures Purple Tenuity Upper Palace of the Dark Capital, he oversees all the Celestial Emperors, August Lords, Supreme Sages, and High Perfected Ones, as well as the myriad star lords of the constellations. Every year, on the fifteenth day of the first month—the Upper Prime Moon Day—the Celestial Officials review the registers throughout the great thousandfold world, within the ten directions and all lands. They examine the records of all great immortals and transcendent beings who ascend and descend, the stellar influences over the lands and their corresponding regions, the lifespans of human beings, and the cycles of transformation for fish, dragons, flying creatures, crawling beings, and all that moves and lives. On the day the Celestial Officials gather with the sages, they record and memorialize, distinguishing each according to their deeds: some are reshaped by their karma, some receive rewards by their blessings, some are transferred through kalpas, some live and die by their actions, and all follow the consequences of good and evil without exception.\n\nThe August Emperor of the Second Rank of the Middle Prime\nThe August Emperor of the Second Rank of the Seven *Qi* Earth Palace, the Clear Void Great Emperor, dwells in the Boundless World’s Cavernous Void Clear Palace.

Mount Tai is the ancestor of all mountains, the patriarch of the Five Marchmounts, the spirit of Heaven and Earth, and the abode of divine numina. It is located in Fengfu County of Yanzhou, now known as Tai’an Prefecture, with Liangfu Mountain as its deputy.\n\nAccording to *The Classic of Divine Marvels* by Dongfang Shuo: In ancient times, among the descendants of Pangu, the fifth generation was He Tian Shi, followed by Xu Bo Shi, then Xuan Ying Shi. Xuan Ying Shi’s son was King Jin Shu, whose younger brother was Shao Hai Shi. Shao Hai Shi’s wife was the Immortal Lady Mi Lun. One night, the Immortal Lady Mi Lun dreamed of swallowing two suns and awoke pregnant, giving birth to two sons. The elder was named Jin Chan Shi, and the younger was Jin Hong Shi. Jin Hong Shi became the Lord of the Eastern Marchmount, while Jin Chan Shi became the Lord of the Eastern Florescence.\n\nJin Hong Shi rendered meritorious service on Changbai Mountain. During the reign of Fuxi, he was enfeoffed as Gu Sui, the True Person of Mount Taihua, and entrusted with the registers of the six celestial immortals. Thus, he took Sui as his surname, with the personal name Chong. Gu Sui was the capital of the Supreme Heavenly Worthy before the Five Marchmounts, now known as Fenghao. His mother was the daughter of the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Water.\n\nDuring the reign of Shennong, he was granted the celestial tally as the Prefect of the Capital and titled Lord. In the Han dynasty, Emperor Ming enfeoffed him as Marshal of Mount Tai, overseeing the distinctions of nobility and humility among the world’s inhabitants, the duration of their official salaries, the registers of the eighteen hells and six bureaus, and the life-and-death cycles of the seventy-five departments.\n\nSince the eras of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Wei dynasties, the Divine Lord has been known only as the Prefect of Tiandu. According to *The Tang Compendium*: In the second year of Chuigong during Empress Wu’s reign, on the first day of the seventh month, the Eastern Marchmount was enfeoffed as the Divine Marchmount King of the Central Heaven. In the first year of Wansui Tongtian, on the first day of the fourth month, he was honored as the Heavenly Equal Lord. In the thirteenth year of Kaiyuan during Emperor Xuanzong’s reign, he was further enfeoffed as the Heavenly Equal King. In the first year of Dazhong Xiangfu during Emperor Zhenzong’s reign, on the fifteenth day of the tenth month, an edict enfeoffed him as the Heavenly Equal Benevolent and Sagely King. By the fourth year of Xiangfu, on a day in the fifth month, he was elevated to the imperial title: Heavenly Equal Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of the Eastern Marchmount. The Virtuous and Illustrious Empress was later honored with the addition of \"Great Life\" to her title, while the rest of her enfeoffment remained unchanged.\n\nThe Emperor has five sons: the Proclaiming Numen Marquis, the Kindly Numen Marquis, the Harmonious Kindness Lady, the Illustrious Numen King of Utmost Sagacity, and the Eternal Peace Lady. They reside as the Revered Master of Benevolence and Exhaustive Insight, the Assisting Numen Marquis, and the Virtuous Kindness Lady. The Emperor has one daughter, the Great Immortal Jade Maiden, known as the Jade Maiden Lady of the Taiping Peak of Mount Tai.\n\nThe Southern Marchmount: Mount Heng of the Southern Marchmount is located in Hengshan County of Hengzhou, with Mount Huo as its deputy. *The Classic of Divine Marvels* by Dongfang Shuo states that the deity’s surname is Chong, with the personal name Tan. The Southern Marchmount governs the stellar correspondences of the world and oversees the affairs of scaled creatures, aquatic beings, dragons, and fish.\n\nIn the fourth year of Dazhong Xiangfu, on the twenty-fifth day of the fifth month, he was posthumously honored with the imperial title: Illuminating Sagely Emperor of Celestial Governance, with the Radiant and Illustrious Empress. The sagely dynasty later added the characters \"Great Transformation\" to his title, while the rest of his enfeoffment remained unchanged.\n\nThe Western Marchmount: Mount Hua of the Western Marchmount is located in Huayin County of Huazhou, with Mount Taibai as its deputy. *The Classic of Divine Marvels* by Dongfang Shuo states that the deity’s surname is Shan, with the personal name Li. The Western Marchmount governs the world’s gold, silver, copper, iron, and other metals, as well as foundries, smelting, and the affairs of feathered birds.\n\nIn the fourth year of Dazhong Xiangfu, on a day in the fifth month, he was posthumously honored with the imperial title: Compliant and Sagely Emperor of the Golden Heaven, with the Solemn and Illustrious Empress. The sagely dynasty later added the characters \"Great Profit\" to his title, while the rest of his enfeoffment remained unchanged.\n\nThe Northern Marchmount: Mount Heng of the Northern Marchmount is located in Quyang County of Dingzhou, with Mount Luodong as its deputy. *The Classic of Divine Marvels* by Dongfang Shuo states that the deity’s surname is Chen, with the personal name E. The Northern Marchmount governs the world’s rivers—Jiang, Huai, and Ji—and oversees tigers, leopards, and other beasts, as well as snakes, vipers, and insects.\n\nIn the fourth year of Dazhong Xiangfu, on a day in the fifth month, he was posthumously honored with the imperial title: Mysterious and Sagely Emperor of Peaceful Heaven, with the Serene and Illustrious Empress. The sagely dynasty later added the characters \"Great Integrity\" to his title, while the rest of his enfeoffment remained unchanged.\n\nThe Central Marchmount: Mount Song of the Central Marchmount is located in Dengfeng County of the Western Capital’s Henan Prefecture, with Mount Shaoshi as its deputy. *The Classic of Divine Marvels* by Dongfang Shuo states that the deity’s surname is Dan, with the personal name Shan. The Central Marchmount governs the world’s marshes, valleys, ravines, ditches, mountains, forests, and trees.\n\nIn the fourth year of Dazhong Xiangfu, on a day in the fifth month, he was posthumously honored with the imperial title: Revered and Sagely Emperor of the Central Heaven, with the Upright and Illustrious Empress. The sagely dynasty later added the characters \"Great Peace\" to his title, while the rest of his enfeoffment remained unchanged.\n\nThe Gods of the Four Waterways: The God of the Jiang Waterway is Qu Yuan, the Grand Master of Chu. The Tang dynasty initially enfeoffed him as a two-character duke, and the Song dynasty added two more characters to his title. The present dynasty further enfeoffed him as a four-character king, titled the King of Vast Source and Compliant Salvation.\n\nThe God of the He Waterway is Chen Ping of the Han dynasty.

The Tang dynasty initially enfeoffed him as a one-character duke, and the Song dynasty added three more characters to his title. The present dynasty further enfeoffed him as a four-character king, titled the King of Pure Source and Han Salvation.\n\nThe Gods of the Five Directions: When King Wu of Zhou conquered Zhou and established his capital in Luoyi, Heaven sent a great snowstorm. On the first day of the jiazi month, the five divine chariots and cavalry halted outside the king’s gate, seeking an audience. The king asked, “Do the gods each have names?” Marshal Jiang Shang replied, “The God of the Southern Sea is named Zhu Rong, the God of the Northern Sea is named Xuan Ming, the God of the Eastern Sea is named Gou Mang, the God of the Western Sea is named Ru Shou, and the God of the Rivers and Lakes is named Feng Xiu.”",

The king asked, “What instructions do you bring?” The gods replied, “Heaven has overthrown Yin and established Zhou. We come in reverence to receive our mandates, each to fulfill our appointed tasks.” King Wu said, “You shall not neglect the seasonal rites in your honor.”\n\nAccording to tradition, Gonggong’s son, Ri Long, presides over the earth as the God of the Soil (Houtu). Shaohao’s son, Ri Zhong, presides over wood as the God Gou Mang. Zhuanxu’s son, Li Xi, presides over fire as the God Zhu Rong. Shaohao’s second son, Gai, presides over metal as the God Ru Shou. Shaohao’s third son, Xi Wang, presides over water as the God Xuan Ming.\n\nTaiyi is a celestial deity. According to the *Book of Han*, when Liu Xiang was collating texts in the Tianlu Pavilion, an old man in yellow robes, holding a staff tipped with blue blossoms, appeared before him. As Liu Xiang sat in darkness, the staff’s light illuminated his reading. When asked his name, the old man replied, “I am the essence of Taiyi.”\n\nJianwu: According to the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*, Kunlun’s peak is the divine capital where the emperor descends. The god Lu Wu governs it—a being with a human face, tiger’s body, tiger’s claws, and nine tails, overseeing the nine celestial divisions and the emperor’s seasonal gardens. This is the same Jianwu whom Zhuangzi speaks of as dwelling on Mount Tai.\n\nZhuyin: The god of Zhong Mountain beyond the seas is named Zhuyin, also called the Torch Dragon. His eyes open to create daylight and close to bring night. He exhales to summon winter’s breath and inhales to cease in summer. He neither eats nor drinks nor rests, and his breath becomes wind. His body stretches a thousand *li*, with a human face, serpent’s form, one red foot, and he dwells in the land of Wuxi.\n\nThe Thunder God was born on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month. His temple lies eight *li* southwest of Leizhou. In former times, villagers crafted thunder drums and thunder chariots, placing them in the temple. Once, a man ate fish and meat together, and instantly a thunderbolt struck him. Ancient records state: During the Tianjian era of the Chen dynasty, a man of the Chen clan, while hunting, found an egg over a *chi* in circumference and took it home. One day, it split open with a thunderclap, revealing a child with markings on his hand reading *Leizhou*. Raised to adulthood, he was named Wen Yu, and the locals called him the “Seed of Thunder.” Later, he became prefect of the region. After his death, he displayed divine power, and the villagers built a temple in his honor. Before storms, lightning and roars would issue from the temple. The Song and Yuan dynasties repeatedly enfeoffed him as a king, and his temple was named Xianzhen. During the Deyou era, it was renamed Weihua.\n\nThe *Guoshi Bu* notes: In Leizhou, thunder is frequent in spring and summer, but in autumn, it burrows into the earth, taking the form of a curled creature, which people dig up and eat. On Mount Wawu in Yazhou, there is a Thunder Grotto—when tiles or stones are thrown in, they trigger lightning in response.\n\nThe Lightning God: Legend holds that the Eastern King and the Jade Maiden were playing a game of pitch-pot. When a shot missed, Heaven laughed, its open mouth streaming light—what we now call lightning.\n\nThe Wind Earl is Feilian. Ying Shao states: Feilian is a divine bird that commands the winds. Its body resembles a deer, its head a sparrow, with horns and a serpent’s tail, and it is as large as a leopard.\n\nThe Rain Master is Shangyang.",

According to the *Red Writ of the Chaotic Abyss*, the Dark Thearch is an emanation of the Primordial Beginning, a distinct embodiment of the Supreme Ultimate. During the era of the Upper Three Sovereigns, he descended as the Perfected of Great Inception; in the Middle Three Sovereigns, as the Perfected of Great Simplicity; and in the Lower Three Sovereigns, as the Perfected of Great Simplicity. By the time of the Yellow Emperor, he descended as the Sovereign of the Supreme Heaven. At the dawn of the Kaihuang kalpa, he descended into the world. In the first year of Ziyun, the jiawu year, on the jiayin day of the third month, at the gengwu hour, he aligned with the essence of the Great Yang and entered the womb of Lady Shansheng of the King of Shengle, gestating for fourteen months—this was the eighty-second transformation of the Supreme.\n\nShengle was a kingdom beneath the lunar lodges Kui and Lou, beyond the eastern sea, corresponding to the Dragon-Transformation Brahma-Heaven. When the Dark Thearch was born from his mother’s left cheek, at the moment of his birth, auspicious clouds enveloped the kingdom, rare fragrances filled the air, and the earth transformed into gold and jade, manifesting wondrous omens. Born with divine numinosity, his every movement was mysterious and elusive. By the age of ten, he had mastered all classics at a glance, comprehending them in silence. Gazing above and below, there was nothing he did not penetrate. He concealed his heart in the Dao, his aspirations aligned with the Great Void, and he vowed to assist the Thearch in bestowing universal blessings upon the people. His father could not restrain his resolve. At fifteen, he bid farewell to his parents to seek secluded valleys and refine his primordial authenticity. Thereupon, the Purple Void Primordial Sovereign of the Jade Purity Saintly Ancestress was moved and transmitted to him the Supreme Dao of the Limitless.\n\nThe Primordial Sovereign addressed the Dark Thearch, saying: “You should cross the eastern sea and journey beneath the wings of the Han. There is a mountain whose traces rise from Qian and Dui, coiling for fifty thousand li. Its waters flow from the Zhen Palace. This mountain arises naturally with the Supreme Ultimate, corresponding to the Wind Heaven of the Firmly Established Culmen and the Great Peace August Cliff of the Second Heaven. You should enter this mountain and dwell among its peaks, choosing the central and loftiest one, the Purple Empyrean. When the era of Supreme Harmony and ascension arrives, five hundred years later, during the two kalpas of Dragon Han, you shall bind your hair, tread barefoot, and gather the true essences of Li and Kan to return to the root and restore your position. Above, you will become a minister of the Three Realms; below, a great sage of the Ten Directions. Only then will your name be manifest for countless kalpas, equal to heaven and earth, sun and moon—this will be the fulfillment of your fruit.”\n\nHaving spoken, the Primordial Sovereign ascended upon the clouds and departed. The Dark Thearch followed his master’s instructions, crossing the Eastern Sea and journeying until he stood beneath the wings of the Han. There, he indeed saw the mountain his master had described, its waters and terrain all matching his words. He entered to survey it and found seventy-two peaks, among which one soared emerald-green, piercing the Purple Empyrean. Below it lay a ravine facing the sun, serene and empty. Thus, the Dark Thearch, honoring his master’s sincerity, named the mountain Great Harmony, the peak Purple Empyrean Peak, and the ravine Purple Empyrean Ravine. He then divined his dwelling there, concealing himself in the mysterious unity of the Void and silently communing with the myriad Perfected.\n\nAfter forty-nine years, he profoundly attained the Supreme Dao. In the fifty-seventh year, on the ninth day of the ninth month of the jiazi year, at dawn on the bingyin day, suddenly auspicious clouds and celestial blossoms descended from the sky, filling the valleys. For three hundred li in every direction, the forests and peaks resounded with the spontaneous music of the immortals’ *bu xu* hymns. At that moment, the Dark Thearch stood nine feet tall, his face like the full moon, brows like dragons, eyes like phoenixes, his hair bound in a topknot, his beard fine. His countenance was as clear as ice, his head crowned with a nine-qi jade coronet, his body clad in pine-fiber robes. Barefoot and with hands clasped, he stood upon Purple Empyrean Peak.\n\nIn an instant, the clouds dispersed, and five Perfected Ones and a host of immortals descended before the Dark Thearch, their retinue magnificent beyond mortal perception. The Dark Thearch bowed deeply, reverently receiving them. The Five Perfected said: “We bear the decree of the Three Clarities and the Jade Emperor. Your merit is complete, your Dao perfected, and you are to ascend. We have heard that your sagely father and sagely mother now reside in the Nine Empyreans.” The Dark Thearch knelt and prostrated himself, receiving the edict with reverence. The Five Perfected then proclaimed the decree, appointing him as the Supreme Marshal of the Great Mystery and Unity, charged with overseeing the affairs of the Yuanhe Migration Bureau. They bestowed upon him the Nine-Virtue Crescent Moon Golden Dawn Jade Coronet, the Jade Hairpin of Qionghua, the Jasper Jade Scepter, the Cloud-Soaring Silver Robe of Golden Radiance, the Purple Cloud Dragon Robe with Cinnabar Skirt and Feathered Adornments, the Seven-Treasure Silk Garment, the Vermilion Shoes of Primordial Light, the Flying Red Cloud Crow, the Jade Tablet of the Supreme Marshal of the Great Mystery, the Qian-Yuan Treasure Seal, the Northern and Southern Dippers, the Three Terraces Dragon Sword, the Jade Rein of Flying Clouds, the Cinnabar Chariot of Green Ascension, the Nine-Colored Jade Wheel of Feathered Beneficence, the Ten Unfailing Numinous Provisions, nine phoenixes leading the way, eight simurghs following, and a hundred million jade maidens and celestial steeds. He was to ascend to the Nine Clarities and carry out the decree.”\n\nThe Dark Thearch bowed twice, received the decree, changed his attire, and ascended to the Golden Portal. According to the *Jade Calendar of the Primordial Abyss*, during the reign of King Zhou of Yin, his daily transgressions and malevolence grew ever more rampant, provoking the descent of six great demon kings who led hordes of ghosts to harm living beings. The Primordial Beginning then commanded the Jade Emperor to issue a decree to the Purple Tenuity: in the yang realm, King Wu of Zhou would overthrow Zhou; in the yin realm, the Dark Thearch would subdue the demons.",

      "translated_text": "At that time, the Supreme One bestowed upon the Dark Thearch flowing hair, bare feet, golden armor, a black robe, and a dark banner. Leading the hosts of celestial soldiers, he descended to the mortal realm. There, he battled the six demon kings of the Six Heavens in the wilds of the Cavernous Yin. The demon kings transformed the qi of Kan and Li into a colossal black turtle and a monstrous serpent, but the Dark Thearch’s divine power pressed them beneath his feet, binding the ghostly hordes within the Great Cavern of Fengdu. With the cosmos pacified, the Dark Thearch returned in triumph. The Supreme One conferred upon him a sacred title, appointing him Preceptor of the Jade Void and Dark Heaven Thearch, as well as Inspector of the Nine Heavens.\n\nHis sacred father was named Heavenly Lord Mo Le, Radiant Perfected Great Thearch; his sacred mother, Supreme Consort Shan Sheng, Jade Perfected Celestial Immortal.

To this day, I have not aged.” He added: “At seventy, I shall face a calamity, yet it will turn auspicious. One day, await me on Mount Luofu—could this be that very calamity?” Arriving in Daliang, Xilie ordered him strangled, and he was buried south of the city. When Xilie’s house fell, someone opened the coffin and found his countenance lifelike, his body suffused with golden light, his nails extending beyond his hands, his beard and hair grown several feet long. He was reburied in the northern mountains of Yanshi. Later, a merchant traveled to Mount Luofu, where he saw two Daoists playing chess beneath a tree. One asked: “Who has come here?”",

      "translated_text": "The merchant replied, “I am but a humble traveler from Luoyang.”\n\nThe Daoist smiled and said, “Would you deliver a letter to my family?”\n\nHe sent a young disciple to fetch paper and brush, then wrote a letter. When the merchant returned to the northern mountains of Yanshi, the descendants of the Yan family received the letter and exclaimed in shock, “This is our late Grand Preceptor’s own hand!”\n\nThey opened the tomb and found the coffin empty.\n\nLater, Bai Yuchan stated: “Yan Zhenqing serves as the Left Judgment Official of the Northern Dipper, Expeller of Demons.” The Emperor of Zitong was born on the third day of the second month.\n\nAccording to the *Inner Records of Qinghe*: I was originally a being of the Heavenly Assembly, born at the beginning of the Zhou dynasty. After seventy-three transformations, I became a scholar-official, never oppressing the people or abusing my authority. My nature was stern and my conduct scrutinous—unyielding as autumn frost or the noonday sun.\n\nAt the end of the Western Jin, I was reborn in the region between Yue and Jun. It was the dingwei year, the third day of the second month, when I was born. Auspicious light enveloped the household, and yellow clouds shrouded the fields. My dwelling lay near the sea. The villagers addressed me as the Old Man of Qinghe and said, “At sixty, you have at last been blessed with a noble heir.” As a child, I disliked play and yearned for mountains and marshes. My speech often seemed cryptic, yet I recited all the classics. I shunned the company of other children, laughing and rejoicing alone. My body radiated light, and when the villagers came to pray, I would scoff at them. I would cry out in a long whistle: “If mere earth and wood can clothe themselves in human garments, eat human food, and bring blessings when worshipped or misfortune when slandered—how can I, a man, lack spirit?”\n\nThereafter, I dreamed at night of becoming a dragon, or of receiving the celestial tally of a king, or of bearing the water tally. Though I found these dreams strange, I did not fully believe them to be auspicious omens. When the three harvests failed and drought withered the crops, the rain dances and prayers to the gods yielded no response. I thought: “In my dream, I governed the Water Palace. Tonight, it shall be proven.”\n\nThat night, I went to the water’s edge and, as in my dream, presented the river god with an official document. My soul trembled with fear, and I could not compose myself. Suddenly, dark clouds gathered, winds howled, and thunder roared. An official knelt before me and said, “The Regional Judge has arrived.”\n\nI replied, “It is not I. I am the son of Zhang the Elder, named Ya.”\n\nThe Water Palace had received word, so they called me Xuemei.\n\nThe official said, “I am here at your command.”\n\nI asked, “How fares my family?”\n\nHe replied, “They have already arrived at the administrative office.”\n\nStill trembling, I bowed my head. The official gestured toward a white donkey, and we departed. In the midst of the storm, I lost all sense of my homeland. We arrived at a mountain, where the Sword Ridge soared like the stars of Shen and Can, resembling a phoenix at rest. Below, a tongue-like path led me into a vast cavern. At the entrance stood a stone. The official said, “When the people pray for rain and touch this stone, their prayers are answered. It is called the Thunder Pillar.”\n\nAs I lifted my robe to enter the cavern, the official spoke again: “Do you recall that in the Zhou dynasty, you were a man who, after seventy-three transformations, passed down hidden virtue through your family—does this continue to this day?”\n\nThen I fully awakened, as if from a dream.\n\nThe official said, “Your name is recorded in the celestial registers as a divine being. In the human world, there are those who know of you. The Jin dynasty will soon show signs of revival. You may seek a method to manifest your transformation.”\n\nI replied, “I thank the celestial messenger for this revelation.”\n\nUpon entering the cavern, I felt as though I had fallen into an abyss of a thousand fathoms, yet my feet did not touch the ground—I seemed to float in midair. Within the palace of the king, guards stood at attention. I entered and saw my family, all gathered there.\n\nOn another day, I donned the robes of a scholar and traveled to Xianyang, where I lectured on the tales of Yao and Mu. The temple stands north of the Nine Bends in Zitong County, Jianzhou. Within its halls is the Pavilion of Descending Brush, where a five-colored flying simurgh is suspended by a golden chain. The simurgh’s beak holds a brush adorned with hundreds of layers of golden blossoms. The brush remains poised above the pavilion, with ink and paper always at the ready. The temple’s doors are sealed by officials appointed by the prefecture to prevent fraud.\n\nWhen the brush descends, a bronze bell in the pavilion rings of its own accord. The temple officials report this to the prefecture, and the appointed officials unlock the doors to retrieve the message. The writings often exhort people to take loyalty and filial piety as their foundation.\n\nRecently, the usurper Xi arrogated the title of King of Shu. He prepared sacrificial animals and ritual vessels, purified himself, and personally visited the temple of the Emperor to offer sacrifices. As he was about to perform the rites, a black wind suddenly rose, extinguishing the candles and scattering the incense. Xi trembled in fear and prostrated himself before the hall. When the wind subsided, he saw that the prayer tablet had split in two.\n\nThe Emperor was posthumously enfeoffed by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang as Left Chancellor. Emperor Xizong of Tang further enfeoffed him as King of Shunji. Emperor Taizu of Song bestowed upon him the sacred title *Loyal, Martial, Filial, and Virtuous Divine King*. His sacred consort was the *Virtuous and Harmonious Concubine of Cooperative Power*; his sacred father, the *Manifest, Celebrated, Benevolent, and Protective King of Abundant Kindness*; his sacred mother, the *Illustrious and Virtuous Concubine of Accumulated Blessings*; his sacred son, the *Hereditary King of Continuing Virtue*; his sacred daughter-in-law, the *Virtuous and Manifest Lady of Excellent Assistance*; his sacred second son, the *King of Flourishing Virtue*; his sacred second daughter-in-law, the *Virtuous and Harmonious Lady of Compliant Assistance*; his sacred grandson, the *Marquis of Illustrious Response to Inherited Mandate*; his sacred grandson’s wife, the *Lady of Virtuous Response*; his sacred second grandson, the *Marquis of Proclaiming Response to Mandate*; and his sacred second grandson’s wife, the *Lady of Kind Response*.\n\nAmong his assisting deities: the *King of Blessed Peace, Loyal, Martial, and Assisting Wings*, who serves as the Grand Marshal of Auspicious Tidings; the two celestial officials of the left and right registers of cinnamon and emolument.\n\nOn the seventh day of the third month of the third year of the Yanyou era, he was further enfeoffed with the sacred title *Emperor of Vast Assistance, Opener of Transformation, Controller of Emolument, and Vast Benevolence*.\n\nThe Three Perfected Lords of Wu:\nIn the time of King Li of Zhou, there were three remonstrating officials: Tang, Ge, and Zhou. The king was fond of hunting and neglected governance. The three officials admonished him, saying: “The former kings governed the state with benevolence and righteousness, transforming the people through virtue. Thus, the realm submitted in harmony. We have never heard of a ruler who indulged in the reckless pursuit of game.”\n\nTheir repeated remonstrances went unheeded, so the three officials resigned their posts and journeyed south to Wu. The King of Wu was greatly pleased. When the army of Chu invaded Wu, the king was deeply troubled. The three officials stepped forward and said: “We offer our lives in service to Your Majesty. We have a plan to secure the state—do not worry.”\n\nThe three officials met the enemy, each employing divine strategies. Chu surrendered, and the King of Wu wished to reward them. They declined, saying: “We are but guest ministers. We dare not accept your gifts.”",

Subsequently, they rescued Crown Prince Jing by subduing the envoys of the Five Directions and averted unnatural disasters. King Xuan then stationed the three officials in Dongcui, where they governed with compassion, soothing the people and distributing their bounty. Merchants petitioned for their resources, and wherever they went, want was unknown. The state flourished, and the three officials were elevated and enfeoffed as marquises. Tang Hong, styled Wenming, was granted the title *Fuling Hou* and was born on the twenty-first day of the seventh month. Ge Yong, styled Wendu, was granted the title *Weiling Hou* and was born on the thirteenth day of the second month. Zhou Wu, styled Wengang, was granted the title *Jialing Hou* and was born on the second day of the tenth month.\n\nIn the first year of the Xiangfu era of the Song, Emperor Zhenzong performed the Feng sacrifice at Mount Tai. As he reached the Heavenly Gate, he suddenly saw three immortals descend from the sky. The emperor respectfully inquired of them. The three immortals replied: “We are commanded by Heaven to protect Your Majesty’s carriage.” The emperor then enfeoffed the three immortals as *Shangyuan Daohua Zhenjun*, *Zhongyuan Huzheng Zhenjun*, and *Xiayuan Dingzhi Zhenjun*, jointly overseeing the netherworld administration of Mount Tai.\n\nThe eulogy reads:\n*Adaptive sages, lords of virtue and power,*\n*They left Zhou for Wu, saving the world and its people.*\n*In Zhou, their glory reached its peak; in Wu, they were honored as guest ministers.*\n*In Song, they met Zhenzong, revealing themselves at the Heavenly Gate.*\n*The emperor personally inquired, and thus learned their cause.*\n*Tang, Ge, and Zhou—spirits of Heaven, Earth, and Water—*\n*By royal decree, they guarded the sagely carriage.*\n*The emperor composed a wondrous eulogy, inscribing their names.*\n*At the summit’s shrine, the Three Spirits were established.*\n\n---\n\n**Xu Zhenjun** (born on the first day of the eighth month)\nXu Zhenjun, named Xu Xun, styled Jingzhi, was a native of Runan. His ancestors had long revered the supreme Dao. In his youth, Zhenjun studied under the Great Cavern Perfected Lord Wu Meng, receiving the teachings of the Three Clarities. He was recommended as a *xiaolian* and appointed magistrate of Jinyang in Shu. Due to the chaos of the Jin, he resigned his post and traveled east of the Yangtze with Lord Wu. When Wang Dun rebelled, the two lords presented themselves to Wang, bearing talismans and incantations, seeking to halt his rebellion and preserve the Jin.\n\nOne day, they visited Wang Dun alongside Guo Pu. Wang, harboring resentment, received them and said: “Last night, I dreamed of lifting a wooden beam that shattered the heavens. Will my usurpation of the imperial throne be entirely successful?” He asked them to interpret the dream. Xu replied: “This dream is not auspicious. The wood breaking through the heavens forms the character *song* (宋). Your Grace must not act rashly.” He then instructed Guo Pu to divine the matter, who said: “It will not succeed.” When asked about Wang’s lifespan, Guo replied: “If you rise in rebellion, disaster will come swiftly. If you remain in Wuchang, your fate will be unfathomable.” Enraged, Wang asked: “How long is *your* lifespan?” Guo answered: “My life ends today.” Wang ordered his guards to seize Guo Pu and execute him. The two lords, still at the banquet, vanished in an instant.\n\nThey reached the mouth of the Lu River and summoned a boat to cross to Zhongling. The boatman refused, saying no one was available to row. The two lords said: “Just take us aboard; we will propel the boat ourselves.” They warned the boatman: “You must firmly shut the door and hide. If you hear the sound of the boat moving, do not peek.” Once aboard, the boatman soon heard the creaking of the vessel and the rustling of leaves. Unable to resist, he stole a glance and saw two dragons pulling the boat atop Zixiao Peak. The dragons, sensing his gaze, abandoned the boat and departed. The two lords said: “You disobeyed our instructions. What is to be done now?” They then left the boatman atop the peak, teaching him to consume sacred herbs and imparting the arts of immortality. The boat’s traces remain there to this day.\n\nLater, in Yuzhang, Zhenjun encountered a young man of refined bearing who called himself Shen Lang. Zhenjun conversed with him and knew he was not human. After the youth departed, he told his disciples: “That young man was a jiao-shen spirit. I fear that if we do not eliminate him, he will continue to bring floods to Jiangxi.” He surveyed the area with his Daoist vision and saw the spirit transformed into a yellow ox on a sandbar. Zhenjun said to his disciple Shi Taiyu: “That yellow ox is the one. I will transform into a black ox and engage it in battle with a white cloth. You must strike it with your sword.” Soon, the two oxen charged at each other, and Taiyu’s blade struck the yellow ox’s left thigh. It fled into a well west of the city, followed by the black ox, and the spirit escaped.\n\nEarlier, the spirit had transformed into a clever young man in Tanzhou, amassing treasures and marrying the daughter of the prefect, Jia Yu. He often traveled the rivers and lakes, returning with abundant goods. This time, he returned empty-handed, claiming to have been robbed and wounded. Shortly after, the steward announced: “A Daoist named Xu Jingzhi seeks an audience with the prefect.” Jia Yu received him and seated him. Zhenjun said: “I hear you have a fine son-in-law. May I meet him?” Shen feigned illness and refused to appear. Zhenjun thundered: “Jiao spirit, old demon, how dare you conceal your form!” The spirit then reverted to its true shape before the hall, and Zhenjun commanded the celestial spirits to slay it. He also ordered the two children brought before him, sprinkled them with water, and they transformed into small shen. The wife, Jia Shi, nearly changed as well, but her parents pleaded fervently, and Zhenjun relented. He instructed them to dig over a *zhang* beneath the house, where the earth was dry and waterless. He then ordered them to move quickly. Moments later, the official residence sank entirely, leaving only the traces of the shen.",

The three officials stepped forward and said: “We offer our lives in service to Your Majesty.

They declined, saying: “We are but guest ministers. We dare not accept your gifts.”",

After Zhenjun’s ascension, the villagers and his clansmen established a shrine on that site. They inscribed the one hundred twenty poems he had left behind onto bamboo slips, placed them in a bamboo basket, and allowed people to draw lots from them to divine fortune and misfortune—calling them the \"Sacred Lots.\" On the seventeenth day of the fifth month in the second year of the Zhenghe era of Emperor Huizong of the Song, he was bestowed the honorific title: \"Zhenjun of Divine Merit and Wondrous Salvation.\" The temple was elevated to an abbey, and the plaque was granted the name \"Jade Prosperity and Longevity of Ten Thousand Years.\"\n\nThe emperor, while reading in the Chongzheng Hall, suddenly seemed to dream of a Daoist at the north of the Donghua Gate, wearing a Nine-Flowered Crown and a crimson robe, leading a great entourage.

Does the Perfected Lord have a remedy?\" The Perfected Lord immediately took a small gourd, poured out a single pill the size of a mung bean, breathed an incantation over it, and applied it to the sores. The emperor felt as though flowing ghee suffused his body, penetrating to the bone with a cool, soothing sensation. The Perfected Lord then bowed and departed. After several steps, he turned back and said: \"My humble abode has long fallen into desolation. I would be most fortunate if Your Sacred Majesty would deign to glance upon it.\" The emperor awoke with a start, and at once ordered a portrait painted in likeness of the figure from his dream. It was enshrined with reverence in the Upper Clarity Repository of Auspicious Blessings Abbey. An edict was issued to seek out the Perfected Lord’s former dwelling; where no abbey or temple existed, officials of the local jurisdiction were to construct one. If any abbey or temple had fallen into disrepair, it was to be restored according to proper standards.

      "translated_text": "After three years, the Azure Dragon and White Tiger circled above at a distance, and the elixir was completed. He consumed it, and though then sixty years of age, his appearance grew ever more youthful. He also obtained secret texts, mastering divine transformations to expel demons and spirits. Later, on Cloud Terrace Peak in Shu, he ascended to heaven, leaving behind his scriptures, talismans, seals, and sword to be passed down to his descendants. His lineage flourished through four generations, and they continued to dwell upon this mountain, revered through the ages. Today, his descendants, inheriting the title of Perfected One, reside at Dragon-Tiger Mountain in Guixi County, Guangxin Prefecture, Jiangxi.\n\n**The Three Mao Perfected Lords**\nThe Three Mao Perfected Lords were born on the eighteenth day of the third month. Mao Ying, styled Shushen, was a descendant of Mao Xuan. His younger brothers were Mao Gu, styled Jiwei, and Mao Zhong, styled Sihe. Born in the fifth year of Emperor Jing of Han’s *Zhongyuan* era, Mao Ying was exceptional from youth, devoted to purity and emptiness. At eighteen, he left home to cultivate the Dao on Mount Da, consuming pine resin. Later, he studied under Master Wang, journeyed west to Tortoise Mountain, and was received by the Queen Mother of the West, who bestowed upon him the *Scripture of the Supreme Ultimate and Mysterious Perfection*. He returned to the northern valley of Mount Heng at the age of forty-nine.\n\nMao Ying’s parents were still living. His father, displeased with his prolonged absence, sought to cane him. Mao Ying knelt and said: \"I have received sacred talismans from my master, and celestial soldiers always attend me. If you cane me, I fear they will intervene, and my offense will only grow heavier.\" His father, wishing to test his words, struck him, but the cane shattered into dozens of pieces, as if shot from a bow—where it struck the wall, the wall was pierced; where it struck a pillar, the pillar sank. Only then did his parents recognize his attainment of the Dao and desist. Mao Ying said: \"I feared precisely this outcome.\"\n\nLater, his two younger brothers both rose to prominence: Mao Zhong became Governor of Xihe, and Mao Gu became Commandant of the Palace Guard. When they were to depart for their posts, hundreds from their hometown came to see them off. Mao Ying, also present, smiled and said to the guests: \"Though I do not hold a two-thousand-bushel office, next year on the third day of the fourth month, when I ascend as an immortal, the send-off will not be inferior to today’s.\" The crowd did not believe him. This was the fourth year of Emperor Xuan’s *Chuyuan* era.\n\nOn the appointed day, several *qing* of land before his gate suddenly leveled themselves, not a blade of grass remaining. They were covered with azure silk tents, and white felt carpets were laid beneath, accommodating hundreds. The guests assembled, and a grand feast was held. Though no attendants were seen, golden platters and jade cups appeared before the mats of their own accord, filled with fine wine, rare delicacies, and exotic fruits beyond description. Music of strings, bamboo, metal, and stone filled their ears, and the fragrance of orchid and musk wafted for miles. Soon, the welcoming officials arrived—hundreds clad in vermilion robes and jade belts, their banners and armor gleaming like the sun. Mao Ying bid farewell to his family and friends, then mounted his carriage and ascended upon the clouds, drifting away.\n\nHis two brothers, still in office, heard of Mao Ying’s ascension and resigned, returning home to seek their brother on the eastern mountain. Mao Ying appeared to them and said: \"Why have you awakened so late? Now you are both aged, and though you may still attain the true methods, you can only become earthbound immortals.\" He first taught them methods to prolong life and avoid death, instructing them to maintain a strict fast for three years. He then transmitted the supreme Dao, teaching them to cultivate the *qi* of the Mysterious Perfection within the Hall of Light. To each, he gave a dose of nine-times-cycled returning elixir and a divine formula. They ingested and wore these, and thus also attained immortality. Later generations called them the Three Mao Perfected Lords. Their temples stand in majestic array upon the three peaks of Mount Mao in Jurong, where their numinous efficacy is wondrously manifest. Pilgrims from south of the Yangtze flock to pay homage.\n\n**Lord Zhang of Mount Ci**\nThe Great Emperor’s surname was Zhang, his given name Bo, and his courtesy name Boqi. He was a native of Longyang in Wuling. His father was the Dragon Lord of Longyang, and his mother was Lady Zhang. The Dragon Lord and Lady Zhang were traveling by the embankments of Lake Tai when suddenly a storm arose—wind, rain, and darkness, with thunder and lightning. Lady Zhang vanished, but after a moment, the skies cleared, and she said she had seen a celestial deity who bestowed upon her a golden elixir. Soon after, she conceived.\n\nOn the night of the eleventh day of the second month in the third year of the *Shenjue* era of the Western Han, he was born. As he grew, he became extraordinarily tall, with a prominent nose, long whiskers, and an awe-inspiring presence. He declared that the land was too desolate to establish a home. Following an animal that guided his path, he journeyed east with Lady Li to Wu and Kuaiji, crossed the Zhe River, and arrived at Mount Caoyun and White Crane Mountain. There, four streams converged below the mountain, and the lord settled there.\n\nAt White Crane Mountain, he took Lady Liu as his consort, and at Mulberry Site in Wucheng, he took Lady Zhao as his attendant. He had nine younger brothers, five sons, one daughter, and eight grandsons. Initially, in Wu and Changxing County of Guiji Prefecture, he employed yin soldiers to dredge and excavate the Sacred Ditch, extending thirty *li* from Changxing to Jingxi, intending to connect the waterway to Guangde. The lord’s drum platform was misled by a crow, and seeing that Lady Li had transformed, he did not meet with her again. He transformed atop Mount Heng, five *li* west of Guangde County, and the locals, missing him, established a temple in his honor. Lady Li also transformed two *li* east of the county, and the people built a temple for her as well.\n\nThe river of the Sacred Ditch silted up and became farmland, now known as the Bathing Soldiers’ Pond. It formed a lake for irrigation, nourishing nearly ten thousand *qing* of fields along its shores. The Drum Platform remains—birds dare not perch there, nor ants gather. It is said that during the *Dabao* era of the Tang, prayers for rain were answered. He was first posthumously appointed Gentleman of the Waterworks. Mount Heng was renamed Mount Ci. Emperor Zhaozong of the Tang posthumously appointed him Vice Minister of Agriculture and bestowed upon him the title of *Jinzi*. Emperor Jingzong of the Later Tang enfeoffed him as Marquis of Guangde. The Southern Tang enfeoffed him as Minister of Works and Duke of Guangde. The Later Jin enfeoffed him as King of Guangde. Emperor Renzong of the Song enfeoffed him as King of Lingji. By the reign of Emperor Ningzong, his title had expanded to an eight-character honorific. In the fifth year of *Chunyou* during the reign of Emperor Lizong, he was renamed Perfected Lord of Upright Protection, Sacred Efficacy, and Illustrious Might. In the second year of *Duanping*, he was further honored as Perfected Lord of Upright Protection, Sacred Efficacy, Illustrious Virtue, Prosperity, and Blessed Fortune.\n\nHis birthday, the eleventh day of the second month, was celebrated. Lady Li, born on the second day of the second month, was enfeoffed as Consort of Harmonious Response, Beneficent Aid, Compassionate Radiance, and Vast Kindness. Lady Zhao was enfeoffed as Consort of Harmonious Compliance, Bearing Aid, Compassionate Protection, and Vast Assistance.",

During the *Guangqi* era of the Tang, they descended upon this town. No records were kept in official registers, so later generations had no means to verify their history. Only the town’s elders transmitted the account orally: A townsman, Wang Yu, owned a garden on the northern outskirts. One night, a crimson glow illuminated the sky above the garden. The townspeople, led by Mi Wang, observed five deities descending from Heaven, their retinue and bearing like those of kings and marquises. Clad in yellow robes with black silk sashes, they sat upon armrest chairs and summoned Yu, saying: “We are entrusted with Heaven’s mandate to receive offerings in this land and bestow blessings upon its people. Tenfold greater than seeking seclusion, we have come to dwell here. If our temple is established here, your blessings shall be boundless.” Yu bowed and replied, “As you command.” With these words, auspicious clouds gathered on all sides, and the deities ascended to Heaven.\n\nThe next day, the townspeople came to inspect the site. To the east stood Fang Mountain, to the west Pei Mountain. On the left, Yaodun Hill encircled it; on the right, Shecheng coiled around it. To the south, two ponds stood majestic, while a great stream flowed before and behind. From the north, the terrain wound sinuously; from the west, two peaks descended, uniquely precipitous and verdant. The water’s outlet was propitious—a fine location indeed. Together, they cut bamboo and thatched grass to construct a splendid hall, sculpted images in the deities’ likeness, and reverently enshrined their spirits. Word spread, and people from afar gathered in throngs.\n\nSince then, the deities descended, demonstrating merit for the state and bestowing blessings upon the people without cease. Initially, the temple was simply called the *Five Manifestations*. During the *Dazhong* era, it was granted the temple plaque *Lingshun*. In the *Xuanhe* era, the deities were enfeoffed as Two-Character Marquises. In the *Shaoxing* era, they were elevated to Four-Character Marquises; in the *Qiandao* era, to Eight-Character Marquises. In the early *Chunxi* era, they were enfeoffed as Two-Character Dukes; in the *Jiachen* year, as Four-Character Dukes. In the eleventh year, they were elevated to Six-Character Dukes; in the sixth year of *Qingyuan*, to Eight-Character Dukes. In the second year of *Jiatai*, they were enfeoffed as Two-Character Kings; in the first year of *Jiding*, as Four-Character Kings. For their unseen assistance in the Jiangzuo region, they were enfeoffed as Six-Character Kings. In the sixth year, an imperial edict in the eleventh month elevated them to Eight-Character Kings.

During the reign of Emperor Ming of Han, in the third year of *Yongping*, a celestial script suddenly descended, inscribed in jade seal characters with dragon patterns, proclaiming that the Great Thearch, Protective Life Perfected Lord, would jointly oversee matters of life and death in the netherworld with the Eastern Peak, Heavenly Equal, Benevolent and Sacred Thearch. Emperor Taizong of Song enfeoffed him as the Protective Sage Perfected Lord, and Emperor Zhenzong later elevated him to the Nine Heavens’ Controller of Destinies, Supreme Minister, Bestowing Blessings Protective Sage Perfected Lord.\n\n**Wang Shichen:**\nShichen, surnamed Wang and named Wenqing, was a native of Linchuan during the Song dynasty. *Shichen* was his official title. He possessed an extraordinary physiognomy, and those of the Dao esteemed him. In his youth, he traveled the four directions, traversing nearly the entire cosmos. He once encountered an extraordinary person who transmitted to him the Daoist arts, enabling him to summon wind and thunder. Emperor Huizong of Song honored him as the Golden Gate Feathered Guest and *Ningshen* Hall *Shichen*, his favor unmatched at the time, though he declined all rewards. When a great drought struck Yangzhou, an imperial edict sought rain. Shichen drew his sword and struck the water, saying, “I borrow three feet of the Yellow River’s water.” Several days later, Yangzhou reported rain, its waters yellow and turbid.

      "translated_text": "He was said to have mastered the secret arts of longevity. Elders recalled seeing him in their youth, already claiming to be several centuries old. He once rode a white donkey that could travel tens of thousands of *li* in a day. When resting, he would fold it up until it was as thin as paper and store it in his headscarf box. To ride again, he would sprinkle water upon it, and it would transform back into a donkey. Emperor Taizong and Emperor Gaozong of the Tang summoned him, but he refused to emerge. Empress Wu Zetian later called him out of the mountains, yet he feigned death before the Temple of Tuo Nu. Later, someone encountered him again in the mountains of Hengzhou. Emperor Xuanzong sent an imperial edict to welcome him, and he arrived shortly after, being installed in the Academy of Scholarly Worthies. When questioned about the immortals, he remained silent, though his divine arts were tested repeatedly without end.\n\n**Perfected of the Western Marchmount**\nThe Perfected of the Western Marchmount, surnamed Feng and named Chang, was a native of Mount Li. During the reign of King Xuan of Zhou, he served as *zhuxiashi* (archivist). Witnessing celestial omens, he retired to cultivate longevity. He encountered Perfected Deng, who transmitted to him sacred scriptures. As his merit and practice neared completion, he met Perfected Peng, who bestowed upon him the *Hidden Writ of the Supreme*. Thereupon, he attained transcendence and used his arts to save lives. In the twentieth year of King Ping’s reign, he ascended and departed.\n\n**Perfected of Great Simplicity**\nThe Perfected of Great Simplicity, surnamed Zhou and named Liang, styled Taizhen, was a native of Taiyuan. His mother, while resting one night, saw five-colored radiant clouds covering her home and conceived. After fifteen months, she gave birth. In his youth, he studied under Yao Tan, who transmitted to him the *Five Thousand Character Writ* and the *Eightfold Scripture of True Simplicity*. He could subdue malevolent spirits, restoring them to their true forms. Crown Prince Jin of King Ling of Zhou heard of him and summoned him for an audience, bestowing upon him the *Ninefold Radiance and Sevenfold Brilliance Mushroom*. Liang ingested it and gained the power of transformation: at times, he would appear as a seventy-year-old with white hair and fallen teeth, yet after a night’s seclusion, he would reemerge as a youth with a visage like blossoms. If ever insulted by ruffians, the offenders would unknowingly bind themselves, suffering blows and cries until their mouths bled, only to be released upon begging for mercy. At over one hundred ninety years of age, in the fourteenth year of King Weilie’s reign, the Celestial Emperor dispatched heavenly officials to welcome him, appointing him Perfected of Qin and Long and granting him entry into the Great Purity.\n\n**Perfected Sa**\nPerfected Sa, named Shoujian, was a native of Xihe in Shu. He once studied medicine but, having mistakenly killed a patient with his prescriptions, abandoned the profession. Hearing of the lofty arts of Celestial Master Zhang Xujing, Wang Shichen of Jianchang, and Lin Lingsu of Fuzhou, he traveled to study under them. Arriving in Shu, his provisions were exhausted, and he sat upon a rock, deeply troubled. Suddenly, three Daoist adepts appeared. The Perfected asked how far it was to Xinzhou. The adepts inquired about his purpose. He replied, “I wish to seek Celestial Master Xujing to study the Dao.” The adepts said, “The Celestial Master has passed away.” He then asked about Wang Shichen, and they replied, “He too has passed.” He asked about Lin Lingsu, and they said, “He also has died.” The Perfected grew despondent, whereupon one adept said, “Though the Celestial Master is gone, his arts remain profound. I am acquainted with him and shall write a letter on your behalf. You may go to seek him. I will also teach you a method to sustain yourself daily.” He then transmitted the art of sucking jujubes: each jujube sucked would yield seven *wen*, and by sucking ten a day, he could earn seventy *wen*—enough for a day’s livelihood. Another adept said, “I too have a method to teach you,” and gave him a palm-leaf fan, saying, “Wave this over the sick, and they will recover.” The third adept said, “I also have a method to teach you,” and transmitted the arts of thunder.

After you burned my temple, I have followed you for twelve years, awaiting an opportunity to avenge myself. Now that your merit and conduct are lofty and your office is under the Celestial Pivot, I beseech you to memorialize and appoint me as a subordinate general.” The Perfected One said, “You are a malevolent spirit; if I seat you within my arts, you will surely harm them.” The temple deity immediately swore an oath never to betray the covenant, whereupon the Perfected One memorialized the Emperor and conferred upon him an official post.\n\nArriving in Zhangzhou, one day all the generals manifested their forms and surrounded him in attendance.

According to legend, in the sixth month of the first year of the Tai Chu era, a man from Hongzhou named Zhang Gui rested at dusk upon Fox Stone when suddenly a divine figure—elegant, radiant, and untouched by worldly dust—descended from the heavens. Gazing at Gui, the spirit intoned, *\"Lülü, lülü, Heaven commands you: on the twentieth day of this month, a violent storm shall strike.\"* With these words, the figure ascended into the sky.

The nuns there burdened her with hauling tea and water, but ghostly attendants did the labor in her stead.\nEnraged, the king commanded the temple be burned. Though the nuns perished in the flames, the bodhisattva remained unharmed, as if untouched.\nHe then ordered her execution, but the blade shattered thrice.\nWhen he commanded her strangulation with a white silk sash, suddenly a black mist shrouded the sky, and a white tiger bore her away to the Forest of Corpses.\nA youth in blue robes stood in attendance. She traversed the underworld, crossed the Bridge of Helplessness, and rescued the suffering. Reviving, she returned to the Forest of Corpses.\nThe Star Lord of Venus, disguised as an old man, directed her to cultivate on Fragrant Mountain.\nLater, King Miaozhuang fell gravely ill. Miaoshan gouged out her eyes and severed her arms to save him. When the king went to pay homage, she attained enlightenment. In the void appeared the wondrous form of the Thousand-Armed, Thousand-Eyed Guanyin, the Miraculous Bodhisattva, who thereafter manifested eternally on Fragrant Mountain.\n\n**Heavenly Kings**\nAccording to *The Origins of the Śākya Clan*, there are Virūḍhaka, Virūpākṣa, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, and Vaiśravaṇa, the Heavenly Kings.\nDuring the Tang, when Emperor Taizong followed his father Gaozu in raising an army, a deity descended before them, declaring himself Vaiśravaṇa and vowing to aid in quelling the rebellion. His general bore a banner with an elephant’s trunk, and wherever they turned, they triumphed.\nAfter ascending the throne, the emperor decreed that all public offices in the realm worship him. In the early Tiansheng era, he commanded every prefecture to establish shrines and build Buddhist temples, all bearing the name \"Heavenly King.\" Thus did the veneration of the Heavenly Kings spread widely.\n\n**Kṣitigarbha**\nBorn on the thirtieth day of the seventh lunar month.\nHe presides over the netherworld, governs the Ten Stages, and receives the obeisance of the Lords of Hell in ceremonial audience.\nIt is said that in the city of Rājagṛha, he transmitted the Dharma to a disciple named Maudgalyāyana, who once studied under the Tathāgata. To rescue his mother from the realm of hungry ghosts, he held the Ullambana Assembly. After his death, he became Kṣitigarbha.\nThe thirtieth day of the seventh month is celebrated as his birthday, and scholars pay him homage.\nSome say that the Kṣitigarbha of Jiuhua Mountain in Qingyang is he.\nAccording to tradition, a monk from Silla crossed the sea during the Tang and dwelled on Jiuhua Mountain. At ninety-nine, he suddenly summoned his disciples to bid them farewell. The mountains rumbled and rocks fell, and soon he sat cross-legged in his coffin. Three years later, when the coffin was opened for interment, his countenance appeared as in life. When lifted, his joints moved like golden chains.

The dragon kings, seized with terror, fled into the Buddha’s shadow. Another time, they brandished mighty swords at the foreheads of demon kings, who, trembling in fear, clutched their children and knelt before the Buddha. They also once petitioned the Buddha to bestow alms upon the host of hungry ghosts.\n\nWhen the World-Honored One entered nirvāṇa, the Vajra deities, overcome with grief and despair, lamented: “The Tathāgata has abandoned us to enter quiescence. From this day forth, we are without refuge, without shelter, without protection. A single reversal has brought calamity crashing down, and the poisoned arrows of sorrow pierce our hearts. For whom shall we now wield these Vajra clubs? We cast them aside—whom shall we serve hereafter?” Thus they spoke, their longing for the Tathāgata manifesting in myriad forms.

The Zhu family heard a child’s cries from the nest and took him in, raising him as their own. They thus gave him the surname Zhu and donated their residence to be made into a temple.\n\nFrom a young age, the Master left home and took refuge at Daolin Temple on Mount Zhong. He always carried a tin staff hung with a knife, ruler, mirror, whisk, and the like, or a strip of cloth a foot or two long. He would go days without eating yet showed no signs of hunger. At times, he would sing songs, their words often bearing prophetic omens. Both scholars and commoners revered him.\n\nDuring the Jianyuan era of the Qi dynasty, Emperor Wu accused the Master of misleading the masses and imprisoned him in the capital’s jail. The next morning, people saw him in the marketplace, yet when the prison was inspected, he was found inside as before. The Prefect of Jiankang reported the matter to the Emperor, who summoned the Master to the rear hall of the palace. While the Master was in Hualin Garden, he suddenly donned three layers of cloth hats, though no one knew where he had obtained them.\n\nSoon after, Prince Yu of Yuzhang and Crown Prince Wenhui passed away in succession, and the Qi dynasty held the Master in even higher regard. From then on, his comings and goings were restricted.\n\nWhen Emperor Gaozu of Liang ascended the throne, he issued an edict: *\"Master Zhi has long been confined by worldly dust, yet his spirit roams the unseen. Neither water nor fire can drown or burn him; neither snakes nor tigers can harm or frighten him. In expounding the Buddha’s teachings, he surpasses even the Śrāvakas; in discussing the hidden and profound, he outshines even the immortals. How foolish it is to bind such a one with the common constraints of ordinary men! From this day forth, let him no longer be restricted.\"*\n\nOne day, the Master dined with the Emperor on stewed fish. The Emperor remarked, *\"I have known this flavor for over twenty years—why do you partake of it now?\"* The Master then spat out a small fish, its scales and tail still intact. To this day, the remnants of that fish remain in Jiankang.\n\nWhen Empress Dou passed away, the Emperor mourned her for months, grieving by day and unable to sleep by night. One evening, he heard a commotion outside his bedchamber and saw a python coiled around a pillar, its eyes glaring and jaws agape as it faced him. Terrified, the Emperor had nowhere to flee. Forced to rise, he addressed the serpent: *\"This palace is heavily guarded—how could a creature like you be born here? You must be a demon seeking to harm me!\"*\n\nThe python spoke in human words: *\"I am the late Empress Dou. In life, I was jealous of the six palaces, my nature cruel and venomous. If I bore even the slightest grudge, I would set fires or loose arrows, harming people and causing deaths. For these sins, I have been reborn as a python. I have no food to fill my mouth, no den to shelter my body, and hunger and exhaustion overwhelm me. Moreover, my scales are infested with worms that gnaw my flesh, the pain as sharp as knives piercing me. Though I am no ordinary serpent, I have transformed and come here, undeterred by the grandeur of the imperial residence. Moved by Your Majesty’s past affection, I have taken this hideous form to reveal myself and beg for a single act of merit to deliver me.\"*\n\nThe Emperor was deeply moved. He searched for the python but found it gone. The next day, he summoned eminent monks to the palace hall, recounted the event, and asked for the most efficacious means to redeem her. The Master replied, *\"Only through repentance rites and sincere confession before the Buddha can this be achieved.\"*\n\nThe Emperor heeded his words, poring over Buddhist scriptures to compile the names of the Buddhas. He also personally composed a repentance text with his sagely brush, resulting in ten volumes. These works gathered and refined the Buddha’s words, omitting extraneous phrases, to form the repentance liturgy.\n\nOne day, an extraordinary fragrance filled the palace, growing ever more exquisite. Unsure of its origin, the Emperor looked up and saw a heavenly being of dignified and radiant appearance. The being addressed him: *\"This is the Empress in her new form. Through Your Majesty’s merit, she has been reborn in the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven. I now reveal her true self as proof.\"* She expressed her gratitude and departed. This account appears in the preface to Emperor Wu of Liang’s repentance text.\n\nIn the winter of the thirteenth year of the Tianjian era of the Liang dynasty, the Master announced his impending passing to the assembly of monks, instructing them to move the temple’s Vajra deity statue outside. He then whispered to a disciple, *\"The Bodhisattva is about to depart.\"* Within ten days, he passed away without illness, his body exuding fragrance as it transformed. He had lived for ninety-seven years.\n\nThe Emperor spent twenty thousand coins to purchase the solitary hill of Dulongfu before Dinglin Temple for the Master’s burial. Princess Yongding donated her bathing funds to construct a seven-story pagoda atop the hill. The Emperor commissioned Lu Chui to compose an inscription and bestowed glass and pearls to adorn the pagoda’s exterior.\n\nIn the seventh year of the Baoda era of the Southern Tang, he was given the posthumous title *\"Wonderfully Awakened.\"* The pagoda was named *\"Responding to the World.\"* In the seventh year of the Taiping Xingguo era of the Song dynasty, a man named Ke E from Shu encountered an old monk on Wansui Mountain, who pointed to an ancient pine and said, *\"Dig here.\"* They unearthed a stone tablet inscribed with *The Record of Master Bao*, a text foretelling the enduring fortune of the imperial lineage.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, envoys were dispatched to express gratitude, and he was posthumously titled *\"Master Bao the Wonderfully Awakened.\"* In the early years of the Zhiping era, his title was further elevated to *\"Great Master Daolin the Truly Awakened.\"*\n\nAccording to *The Precious Record of Jiankang*, the Kai Shan Temple once housed the sandals of Master Zhi. During the early Shenlong era of the Tang, Zheng Kejun took them back to Chang’an. The present-day *Washing Alms-Bowl Pool* still exists, and the square pond two *li* west of the pagoda marks the former site of Fayun Temple.\n\n**Sixth Patriarch Lu**\nThe Sixth Patriarch Lu, named Neng, was a native of Xinzhou in Guangdong. During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang, drawn by the fragrant waters of Caoxi, he sought a site for a Daoist sanctuary. Approaching the landowner, he said, *\"I require only enough space to lay my kasaya.\"* The landowner consented. Lu spread his robe, which covered eighty *li* in circumference—the present-day Nanhua Mountain, the sanctuary of the Sixth Patriarch. His corporeal remains endure, his face darkened by incense smoke like lacquer.\n\nIn the *bingzi* year of the Yuan dynasty, Han soldiers pierced his abdomen with a blade, only to find his organs as fresh as those of a living man. Dismayed, they dared not desecrate him further. His robes and alms-bowl were carried away, including a kasaya bestowed by Emperor Xuanzong, woven with faint mountain-water patterns; a Western Heaven alms-bowl, neither bronze nor iron, wood nor stone; Western Heaven sandals, neither leather nor wood; sixteen or seventeen leaves of *The Flower Garland Sutra*; and a Buddha’s tooth, encased in a silver-inlaid casket.\n\nOnce, a malevolent dragon dwelled in a deep pool, afflicting the people. The Sixth Patriarch said, *\"I fear only that you will shrink.\"* The dragon shrank, and he captured it in his alms-bowl. Confined to the temple, the dragon withered and submitted.\n\n**Bodhidharma, the Twenty-Eighth Patriarch**\nBodhidharma, the Twenty-Eighth Patriarch, was born on the fifth day of the tenth month. He crossed the sea from India to the Liang court but found no affinity with the Emperor. Secretly ascending Mount Song, he faced the wall of Shaolin Temple for nine years before passing away in perfect repose. He was interred on Mount Xiong’er.\n\nDuring the Wei dynasty, Song Yun, returning from a mission to the Western Regions, encountered Bodhidharma on the Lion-Elephant Ridge in Congling. The Patriarch carried a single sandal, walking lightly away. When asked where he was bound, he replied, *\"To the Western Heaven.\"* He added, *\"Your king has departed this world.\"* Bewildered, Song Yun took his leave and returned east. Upon reporting to the court, he learned that Emperor Ming had already passed. Under Emperor Xiaozhuang’s reign, Song Yun recounted the encounter. The tomb was opened, revealing only an empty coffin and a single leather sandal.\n\n**Chan Master Pu’an**\nChan Master Pu’an, named Yin, was born to the Yu family of Yichun County in Yuan Prefecture during the fifth year of the Zhenghe era of Emperor Huizong of the Song, at the hour of *chen* on the twenty-seventh day of the eleventh month. At age six, he dreamed of a monk touching his heart and saying, *\"You will one day awaken on your own.\"* Upon waking, he told his mother, who saw a radiant red dot on his chest, as bright as a cherry.\n\nHis parents thus permitted him to leave home under the guidance of Venerable Xian of Shoulong Monastery. At twenty-seven, he took the tonsure, and the following year, he received the precepts. The Master’s appearance was imposing, his wisdom keen. Venerable Xian esteemed him and urged him to recite sutras. The Master replied, *\"I have heard that the essence of the Buddha and Patriarchs lies in awakening the heart. Mere recitation of words brings no benefit.\"* He then took leave of his teacher and traveled to Hunan and Hubei, seeking out Master Mu’an Zhong.\n\nWhen asked, *\"The myriad dharmas return to the One—where does the One return?\"* Master Zhong raised his fist. Pu’an was instantly enlightened. Later, he returned to his monastery.\n\nIn the *guiyou* year, the neighboring Cihua Monastery, lacking a permanent abbot, invited him to take residence. The temple had no endowment. The Master wore paper robes, ate morning gruel and evening rice, and aside from meditation, devoted himself solely to studying *The Flower Garland Sutra*. One day, he experienced a great awakening, his body drenched in sweat. Overjoyed, he exclaimed, *\"Today, I have truly entered the realm of *The Flower Garland!*\"* He then composed a verse:\n\n*\"Neither gathered nor scattered,\nWhy seek Southern Peak or Tiantai?\nAt the gates of the six senses, none arrive—\nYet a foreign monk comes uninvited.\"*\n\nOne day, a monk named Dao Cun arrived through the snow. The Master, upon seeing him, rejoiced, *\"This is my uninvited friend!\"* They sat in silent communion, exchanging questions and answers. Later, the Master retreated to Nanling, adopting the name *\"Pu’an.\"*\n\nHe later raised funds to rebuild Cihua Monastery. Many, drawn by his virtue, sought his teachings. He instructed them as circumstances allowed, sometimes writing verses for them. For the sick, he fashioned medicine from grass; for those afflicted by plague, where none dared approach, he offered verses. All were healed completely. His miracles extended to summoning rain, dispelling demons, and demolishing illicit shrines—his responses were manifold.\n\nAs a result, construction flourished. The wealthy donated wealth, the poor offered labor, and the skilled contributed craftsmanship. The temple was renovated, and for thousands of *li*, roads were cleared and bridges built—all rejoiced in virtuous deeds, transformed by the Master’s influence.\n\nOne day, he took up his brush and wrote a verse on the western wall of his chamber:\n\n*\"Now rain, now shine—the jeweled elephant gleams,\nEast and west, north and south—thick clouds swirl.\nCountless souls lose their pearl and suffer calamity;\nIllusory responses, expedient means—cleansed for you.\"*\n\nHaving written this, he addressed the assembly: *\"The Buddhas neither appear in the world nor enter nirvana. Those who enter my room must attain the original union. Guard this well, lest you regress.\"* He then donned his robe, sat cross-legged, and entered tranquility on the twenty-first day of the seventh month in the fifth year of the Qiandao era.\n\nHe was posthumously honored as *\"Chan Master Pu’an Jigan Miaoji Zhenjue Zhaoji.\"*\n\n**The Great Sage of Sizhou**\nThe Great Master Sengqie of Sizhou arrived in Chang’an and Luoyang during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Tang, traveling through Wu and Chu. Holding a willow branch, he blended with the monastic community. When asked his surname, he replied, *\"What surname?\"* When asked his homeland, he said, *\"What country?\"*\n\nLater, on the banks of the Si River, he sought to build a monastery. Staying at the home of a local named He Ba in Suzhou, he declared, *\"This was once a Buddhist site.\"* They dug and uncovered an ancient tablet, revealing that Xiangji Temple had been founded by the Qi-dynasty monk Jinlong.

      "translated_text": "The Master said, *\"This is Universal Radiance King Buddha.\"* Thus, they took this as the temple’s name. In the second year of Jinglong, Emperor Zhongzong dispatched envoys to welcome the Great Master to the capital, where he was received with profound reverence and commanded to reside at Great Merit-Fostering Monastery. On the third day of the third month, the Great Master demonstrated his passing. An imperial decree ordered his lacquered body to be enshrined in a stupa at Merit-Fostering Monastery, but suddenly a foul odor filled the city. The emperor prayed and sent the Master back to Linhuai, whereupon, as soon as the words were spoken, an extraordinary fragrance arose. The emperor asked Fang Hui, *\"Who is this Great Master Sengqie?\"* Fang Hui replied, *\"He is an emanation of Avalokiteśvara.\"* During the Qianfu era, he was posthumously honored as *\"Great Master Zhengsheng.\"*\n\n**Venerable Fu**\nVenerable Fu, whose given name was Xi, was a native of Yiwu in Wuzhou. From childhood, he was wise and discerning, versed in the books of the Three Teachings, and styled himself *\"Good Wisdom Bodhisattva.\"* In the first year of Liang Dynasty’s Datong era, he encountered the Indian monk Senggutuo, who said to him, *\"You are an emanation of Maitreya.\"* Thereupon, he was instructed to gaze into the water, where he saw a haloed aureole, and thus awakened to his past causes. When he asked where to cultivate the Dao, Senggutuo pointed to a pair of *shuangtao* trees beneath Song Mountain, saying, *\"This will suffice.\"* The Venerable established a hermitage there, and in the third year of Datong, a temple was founded—this is the present-day Shuanglin Monastery. Among its treasures were a *Lotus Sutra* bestowed by Emperor Wu of Liang, an iron plow, a cake-shaped alms bowl, crystal prayer beads, and a bronze crown of the Seven Buddhas, all of which remain extant.\n\nInitially, the Venerable’s path was arduous; though not of the monastic order, he did not shave his head, and the world regarded him as a foreknower and forewakened one, exempt from the tonsure and robes of a śramaṇa. At the time, there was a place called Yuhu Rock twenty-five *li* south of Yiwu, also known as Huangshan Peak, where fierce beasts preyed upon the villagers. After his meals, the Venerable would take his leftover rice to feed them, and from then on, the tigers and beasts hid away. He also transformed stones into a lustrous blue-purple hue, radiant and lovely, suitable for carving into prayer beads. A man of the Tao family, who had long supported the Venerable, was told by him as he pointed to a stone, *\"This stone, blue-purple, can be carved into prayer beads.\"* He further admonished, *\"Let your descendants pass down this craft—only your family can do this. Others who imitate it will find the stones shatter.\"* Later, Loyal and Offering King went to Wuzhou to open the Venerable’s stupa and retrieve his relics, intending to take them to Pilong Mountain. When they proved immovable, a Dragon Flower Monastery was built on that very spot, and the relics were used to mold an image of the Venerable within the stupa.\n\n*The Unified Gazetteer* records that Venerable Fu’s tomb lies among the stones of Yunhuang Mountain. In the early Kaiyun era of the Jin, Qian Yuanzuo of Wuyue sent envoys to retrieve his remains for reburial in Qiantang. When the tomb was opened, two tigers roared atop the walls. That night, a great storm of thunder and lightning shook the valleys. As the procession departed, the tigers followed, but when they reached the Xiaozhu River, the waters blocked their path, and they returned.\n\n**Erlang Shen, Born on the Twenty-Sixth Day of the Sixth Month**\nErlang Shen, surnamed Zhao and named Yu, studied under the Daoist Li Jue on Mount Qingcheng. Emperor Yang of Sui, recognizing his worth, appointed him Prefect of Jiazhou. To the left of the prefecture lay the Lingyuan and Er Rivers, where an ancient flood dragon wrought havoc, drowning and harming the people whenever the waters rose in spring and summer. Enraged, Zhao Yu prepared boats and led stalwart men and villagers to drum and shout along the riverbanks. Brandishing his blade, he plunged into the water. After a while, the river turned crimson, and the cliffs rumbled like thunder. Zhao Yu emerged from the waves, his right hand gripping the blade and his left holding the dragon’s head. Seven who had accompanied him into the water became the Seven Sages. When the world fell into chaos at the end of the Sui, he abandoned his post and vanished, his whereabouts unknown.\n\nLater, when the Jiang River overflowed, the people of Shu saw Zhao Yu amidst the blue mist. Grateful for his virtue, they built a temple at the mouth of the Guan River to worship him. Emperor Taizong of Tang enfeoffed him as *\"Divine Uncle, Great General.\"* Emperor Ming of Tang further honored him as *\"King of Red City,\"* and Emperor Zhenzong of Song bestowed the title *\"Perfected Lord of Pure Source and Wondrous Dao.\"*\n\n**Lord Xiao**\nLord Xiao, whose given name was Boxuan, had bushy brows, dragon-like whiskers, a fine beard, and a face as youthful as a child’s. He was upright and self-disciplined, his words and laughter never frivolous. He loved good and hated evil, and the villagers often sought his judgment to settle disputes. He passed away during the Xianchun era of the Song and became a deity, possessing a child to foretell fortune and misfortune with uncanny precision. The villagers built a temple for him on Taiyang Isle in Xin’gan County, where he bestowed blessings upon the region. During the Yuan, his son Xiangshu, who had also demonstrated divine efficacy after death, was jointly worshipped in the temple.\n\nIn the early Hongwu era of the present dynasty, officials were dispatched to offer sacrifices. In the seventeenth year of Yongle, his grandson Tianren passed away and repeatedly manifested numinous signs, so he too was enshrined there. By imperial decree, he was enfeoffed as *\"Heroic Protector of the Water Palace, Spiritually Penetrating, Vastly Beneficent, Manifestly Responsive, and Mighty in Might, whose awe-inspiring power extends over the Nine Rivers and the confluence of the Yellow River.\"*\n\n**Lord Yan**\nLord Yan, surnamed Yan and named Shouzai, was a native of Qingjiang Town in Linjiang Prefecture. He had thick brows, a black beard, and a face like lacquer. He detested evil as if it were boiling water, and if anyone acted improperly, he would say, *\"Does Lord Yan not know?\"* Thus, people held him in great reverence and fear. At the beginning of the Yuan, he was selected for office based on his talents and served as the director of the Brocade Bureau. Falling ill, he returned home by boat and suddenly passed away. His attendants prepared his funeral rites as usual. Before reaching home, his family saw him leading a procession through the wilderness, dressed in his usual robes and cap, and they marveled at this. A month later, when his body arrived, they were both astonished and bewildered. Upon opening the coffin, they found it empty—it was a case of *shijie* (liberation by means of a simulated corpse). The elders, knowing he had become a deity, built a temple to worship him, and he manifested his efficacy on rivers and lakes. By imperial decree of the present dynasty, he was enfeoffed as *\"Marquis Pacifier of Waves.\"*\n\n**Three Water Palaces of the Yangzi River**\nAccording to *The History of the Five Dynasties*, when the Yang clan controlled the Jiang region, they enfeoffed Madang as the Upper Water Palace, with its temple on the southern slope of the mountain. Caishi was the Middle Water Palace, its temple at the foot of Caishi Mountain, enfeoffed as a king. The Song further honored it as *\"Manifestly Numinous, Sagely, Loyal, and Assisting Pacifier of the Jiang King.\"* Jinshan was the Lower Water Palace, its temple within Jinshan Monastery. In the present dynasty, all three temples are revered as deities of the Water Palace. On the waters of the Yangzi, a single call brings an immediate response, and boatmen passing by always prepare sacrificial animals and silk to pray. Today, officials offer seasonal sacrifices.",

      "translated_text": "The Lord of Dongting is the deity of Dongting Lake, with a temple at Longdui. According to tradition, there was a scholar named Liu Yi during the reign of Emperor Zhongzong of Tang. On his way home after failing the imperial examination in Jingyang, he encountered a woman herding sheep. She said to him: \"I am the youngest daughter of the Lord of Dongting. I was married to the second son of the Jing River Lord, but slandered by a maidservant and banished to this place. I humbly ask you to deliver a letter home for me.\" Liu declined, saying he did not know the way. The woman replied: \"On the northern shore of Dongting Lake stands a great tangerine tree. Strike it three times, and someone will respond.\"\n\nLiu followed her instructions. A warrior emerged, lifted the waters, and led him inside. Upon reaching the Palace of Spiritual Emptiness, Liu presented the letter. The Lord of Dongting wept and said: \"This is the fault of an old man, causing my young daughter to suffer such harm.\" Soon after, a red dragon flew away, and shortly thereafter, a figure surrounded by crimson mist returned—it was the woman who had entrusted him with the letter. Liu was feasted in the Azure Cloud Palace. The Lord’s elder brother, titled the Lord of Qiantang, said to Liu: \"The woman of Jingyang wishes to entrust herself to your noble virtue as a wife.\" Liu dared not accept and took his leave. Later, he married a woman of the Lu family, who was in fact the dragon maiden, and together they returned to Dongting.\n\nThe Lady of the Xiang\nAccording to the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*, the two daughters of the Emperor resided on Mount Dongting. When Emperor Shun died during his southern inspection and was buried in the wilds of Cangwu, his two consorts, unable to reach him in time, drowned in the waters between the Yuan and Xiang Rivers. The people built a temple for them, and they came to be known as the Ladies of the Xiang. Temples stand at the mouth of the lake and on Junshan Island. When the First Emperor of Qin traveled south and sailed the Yangzi, he encountered a great storm. Asking what deity the Lady of the Xiang was, his scholars replied: \"The daughter of Yao and consort of Shun.\" Enraged, the First Emperor ordered the mountain to be painted red—this is the place. Tang poet Han Yu composed a stele for her. Li Bai wrote:\n*\"The Emperor’s daughters left for Xiaoxiang, never to return,\nOnly autumn grasses remain between Dongting’s shores.\nThe clear lake opens like a jade mirror,\nAnd painted in ink is the isle of Junshan.\"*\nLiu Yuxi also wrote:\n*\"Lake light and autumn waters blend in harmony,\nThe deep pool, windless, gleams like a freshly polished mirror.\nGazing afar at Dongting’s emerald hills,\nA silver mound cradles a single green snail.\"*\n\nThe Grandmother of Chaohu\nAccording to the *Qingsuo Gaodie*, one day in ancient Chaohu, the river waters surged violently before returning to their original course. A giant fish weighing ten thousand *jin* was found in the channel, and it took three days to die. The entire prefecture ate its flesh, save for one elderly woman who, though kind-hearted, refused to partake. Suddenly, an old man appeared and said to her: \"This was my son, who met with this misfortune. Because you did not eat his flesh, I will richly reward you. The stone tortoise at the eastern gate has red eyes—a sign the city will sink. Go check it daily.\" A mischievous child deceived her by smearing the tortoise’s eyes with cinnabar. When the grandmother saw this, she fled in haste and climbed a mountain. The city sank and became a lake—Chaohu. Later, a temple was built on Gushan within the lake to worship the Grandmother. Those who sail the lake never fail to make offerings. Luo Yin’s poem contains the lines: *\"I ask about the city’s sinking long ago—how many thousands of years have passed since Qin and Han?\"*\n\nThe Deity of Guanting Lake\nThis deity has no recorded name but manifests at Guanting Lake in Nankang Prefecture. When the deity arrives, dark clouds obscure the sun, and the sound is tumultuous, like tides surging. The deity can split the wind, sending one current south and another north, so that boats above and below sail without hindrance. It can also cleave the waves as if holding a magical rhinoceros horn to enter the sea. The prefectural governor, respecting the deity’s power and fearing it might disrupt navigation, built a shrine by the lake and offered seasonal sacrifices. The deity responds to all invocations, and travelers near and far rely on its protection. Song poet Qin Guan once lodged at the Bamboo-Loving Pavilion by the lake. In a dream, the lake deity presented him with a poem:\n*\"Who knows the waters where winds part the night’s mooring,\nCompared to autumn slumber in the Bamboo-Loving Pavilion?\nI hear your writings are famed throughout the land—\nBefore Mount Lu’s face, even silence speaks volumes.\"*\n\nThe Nine Carp Lake Immortals\nThe He family’s origins are unknown, but nine brothers cultivated the Dao in the mountains northeast of Xianyou County, hence the name Nine Immortals Mountain. They also refined elixirs by the lake, and upon completion, each rode a red carp away, giving the lake its name, Nine Carp Lake. A temple stands by the lake, renowned for its efficacy. During the imperial examinations, scholars from the prefecture would pray for dreams here, trusting it as they would Cao or Cai. In our dynasty, Huang Mengliang, moved by their story, composed a poem to commemorate it:\n*\"Men ascended as immortals, carp transformed to dragons—\nWho built the immortal palace by the lake?\nStones bear traces of cinnabar in murmuring streams,\nClouds veil jade towers in misty heights.\nThe Azure Bird comes and goes beneath the moonlit night,\nPeach blossoms bloom and fall with the spring breeze.\nThis journey was not for dreaming of Deng,\nBut to meet the Stone Elder at the bridge.\"*\n\nThe Sea Deity\nThis is Hai Ruo. According to legend, the First Emperor of Qin built a stone bridge to cross the sea and observe the sunrise. The sea deity drove the stones into place. The First Emperor sought to meet the deity, who said: \"Do not depict my form.\" The First Emperor agreed, but upon seeing the deity, his clever attendants secretly sketched its likeness. Enraged, the deity said: \"You have broken your promise—depart at once!\" The temple now stands in Wendeng County.\n\nThe Tide Deity\nThis is Wu Zixu, seen riding the tide in a white carriage drawn by white horses.\n\nThe Water Deity\nThis refers to Yuqiang and the River Earl.\n\nThe Wave Deity\nThis refers to Chuanhou.\n\nMaster Kuangfu of Mount Lu\nThe master, surnamed Kuang, named Xu, styled Junping, was a native of southern Chu and called himself Master Kuangfu. Born with divine spirit, he harbored otherworldly aspirations even as a child. During the reign of King Wu of Zhou, he studied under Laozi and attained the Way of longevity. He built a thatched hut above Tiger Brook on the southern slope of Mount Lu and lived in seclusion. His dwelling held nothing but a bed and a few scrolls of texts. King Wu repeatedly summoned him, but he refused. Later, he met a youth who transmitted the secrets of immortality, and he achieved the Dao. Emperor Wu of Han, during his southern tour, ascended the Heavenly Pillar to offer sacrifices and once gazed in reverence toward the master. Later, when the emperor shot a dragon in the Xunyang River, he posthumously enfeoffed the master as the Duke of Southern Culmen and Great Brilliance, ordering a shrine built at his former hermitage by Tiger Brook. The prefect, Heng Yi, later relocated the shrine to the mountain’s entrance. For prayers regarding floods, droughts, or plagues, the responses were always efficacious.\n\nThe Deity of Suoling Mountain\nThe temple stands on Lumen Mountain southeast of Xiangyang Prefecture. According to records, Emperor Guangwu of Han visited Liqu, where he dreamed of a deity in white robes, feathered garments, a plain headscarf, and a black sash coming to pay respects.",

In the early years of Emperor Wu of the Wu kingdom, his former subordinate saw Ziwen on the road, riding a white horse and holding a white feather fan, attended as in life. The subordinate, startled, fled. Ziwen pursued and said to him, “I am to become the local earth deity. Bless the people below by building me a shrine, or I shall send insects into men’s ears as a plague.” The Wu ruler dismissed this as heretical talk, but later, insects did enter men’s ears, and many died, while shamans and physicians could not cure them.

He further said, “If you do not worship me, there shall be a great pestilence.” The Wu ruler, troubled, enfeoffed him as Marquis of the Central Capital, bestowed a seal and sash, and built a shrine at the foot of Mount Zhong, renaming the mountain Jiangshan to mark its numinous wonders.\n\nDuring the rebellion of Su Jun in the Jin dynasty, the emperor dreamed that Marquis Jiang said, “Su Jun is a traitor; I shall aid in his execution.” Later, Su Jun was indeed beheaded, and Marquis Jiang was promoted to Chancellor. During the reign of Emperor Xiaowu of the Jin, when Fu Jian invaded, the emperor saw the imperial troops arrayed in perfect order and beheld the grasses and trees on Mount Bagong transformed into human shapes, filling him with dread. Earlier, when Prince Dao of Kuaiji learned of Fu Jian’s invasion, he sought aid from the spirit of Mount Jiang with ceremonial music and banners. When Fu Jian saw them, he seemed to perceive divine assistance.\n\nIn the second year of Yongchu of Emperor Gao of the Song, an edict banned illicit shrines, but those from Jiang Ziwen downward were exempted. He was elevated to Chancellor, Grand Commander of All Military Affairs, and enfeoffed as King Jiang. During the Yongming era of the Qi, when Cui Huijing rebelled, the court welcomed the deity into the palace to seek blessings and aid. After the crisis passed, he was granted the imperial title. The shrine was renovated, with the outer gate named Lingguang Gate, the central gate named Xingshan Gate, the outer hall named Imperial Mountain, and the inner hall named Divine Abode.\n\nEmperor Wu of Liang often sacrificed to him but received no response. He sent envoys to burn the shrine, but before they reached their destination, a sudden storm arose, shaking the palace. The emperor, frightened, ceased his sacrifices. The Southern Tang renamed him Emperor Zhuangwu and renovated the shrine. Xu Xuan was ordered to compose an inscription, recording the events in full. During the Later Zhou dynasty, on the day of the imperial assembly, a fire destroyed the shrine in the eighth year of Kaibao. It was rebuilt in the fourth year of Yongxi and further expanded in the second year of Jingyou by Chen Zhizhong, who petitioned the court for the shrine’s plaque, bestowed as *Hui Lie*. In the twentieth year of Hongwu of the present dynasty, it was relocated to the southern slope of Yingwushan. Liu Sanwu was ordered to compose a record, and the locals called it one of the Ten Shrines.\n\n**Emperor Wulie of Changzhou**\nThe Loyal and Protective Emperor of Martial Might, surnamed Chen, named Guoren, styled Zhiwei, was a native of Jinling in Changzhou. His august ancestor, Song, served the Chen dynasty as a Feathered Forest Gentleman, and his father, Jiming, was appointed Gentleman of the Palace. The emperor was born on the fifteenth day of the third month of the second year of Taiqing of the Liang, in the year *jisi* at noon. His heroic bearing shone forth, marked by the rare signs of tripod horns and rhinoceros tusks, astonishing all who saw him. At eight, he could compose essays; at thirteen, he had read all the histories.\n\nIn the first year of Tiankang of Emperor Wen of the Chen, he passed the imperial examinations, stood in audience at the jade steps, and at just eighteen was appointed Investigating Censor, later promoted to Grand Inspector of the Jiangxi Circuit. The emperor’s wisdom and courage surpassed others, and he mastered military strategy. Serving the Chen for twenty-five years, he governed with filial piety and loyalty, bestowing virtue and kindness upon the people, his martial renown filling the realm.\n\nHe declined office under the Sui. When Emperor Yang toured Jiangdu, bandits arose on all sides, and the emperor, hearing of his reputation, summoned him to suppress them. Duty-bound to relieve the people’s suffering, he accepted the command. In the fifth year of Daye, he was appointed Upholder of Righteousness, pacified the rebels of Changbai, and was promoted to Gentleman for Summoning. He quelled the hundred thousand rebels of Le Botong in Jiangning and was appointed Grand Master for Splendid Happiness. He pacified the two hundred thousand bandits of Lou Shigan in Dongyang and was summoned to court as Grand Minister of State.\n\nAt the end of Daye, Shen Faxing raised troops in Wuxing, scheming to seize Changzhou with treacherous intent. Feigning allegiance, he secretly plotted. The bandit chieftain Li Zitong amassed tens of thousands of men on the north bank of the river, covertly aiding Faxing, but fearing the emperor’s might, dared not cross. In the second year of Wude of Emperor Gaozu of the Tang, on the eighteenth day of the fifth month, Faxing feigned illness and urgently summoned the emperor. Reluctantly, the emperor went to inquire after him and was poisoned during the feast. Rushing home, he summoned the eminent monk Lin, a renowned physician, for treatment. The method required washing his intestines to remove the poison in a secluded place from the *Xianji* Sutra. The emperor’s wife, Lady Shen, secretly observed by the pond and startled him. Knowing he could not be saved, he entrusted Lin and his concubines Zhang and Han, instructing them to convert his residence and southern treasury into a monastery and his eastern residence into a Buddhist temple. With these words, he passed away at the age of seventy-two.\n\nFaxing, hearing of his death, believed his ambitions fulfilled, but the emperor’s heroic spirit remained, his loyalty ever steadfast. One day, dark clouds blotted the sky, wind and rain darkened the world, and suddenly his majestic form appeared, loosing a divine arrow that struck down Faxing. The rebel forces were utterly vanquished.",

      "translated_text": "The imperial protection and divine might manifested thus, leading the Tang emperor to bestow upon him the stele title *Feng Zhonglie Gong* and the posthumous name *Fushun Wulie Wang*. Later, the Later Zhou dynasty elevated him to imperial rank, and in the fourth year of the Xuanhe era of the Song, his temple was granted the plaque *Fushun*. His divine titles were further augmented as *Wulie Xianling Zhaode Dadi*, *Wulie Shenhou*, and *Zhao You Zhang Furén*. His divine father was *Qiling Hou*, and his divine mother, *Yide Duan Furén*. His divine stepmother was *Jiade Yi Furén*. His divine sons included *Zan Huiji Mei Hou* and *Xie Ying Jishun Hou*, while his divine grandson was a *recluse*. His divine aide, *Zi Dawei*, named *Kehong*, was enfeoffed as *Lanling Jiangjun*.\n\nThe Five Magistrates of Yangzhou—*Yangzhou Yingxian Situ* Mao, Xu, Zhu, Jiang, and Hao—dwelled in Yangzhou and swore brotherhood, delighting in hunting. The land was once plagued by tigers and wolves, bringing harm to the people. By a mountain stream, they encountered an elderly woman, solitary and without kin, who drank from the brook to sate her hunger. The five deities invited her to their dwelling, bowing and addressing her as mother. Before long, when they returned from hunting, she vanished, and the five were increasingly menaced by tigers. Resolved, they pursued the beasts into the mountains, where a tiger approached, prostrated itself, and submitted. From then on, the tiger scourge ceased. Later generations, remembering their virtue and righteousness, built a temple to worship them, where prayers were answered without fail. The temple stands today in the eastern part of Jin’gui Mountain in Dongxing Township, Jiangdu County. During the reign of Emperor Yang of Sui, they rendered meritorious service in protecting the imperial carriage and were enfeoffed as *Situ*. The Tang dynasty further granted them the title of *Hou*. In the Xinmao year of the Shaoding era of the Song, the rebel Li Quan repeatedly invaded the region. Prayers to the deities proved inauspicious, and in anger, the rebels desecrated the divine images. Within three days, Quan was slain at Xintang, his limbs scattered—just as he had treated the deities. After the rebellion was quelled, Prefect Zhao Fan personally led his officials to offer sacrifices at the temple in gratitude. The temple was expanded, and its hidden merits were memorialized to the court, which bestowed the plaque *Yingxian* and elevated their titles to *Bazi Hou*. Later, when Minister Jia Sidao governed the region, prayers to the deities brought immediate relief: droughts yielded to rain, floods gave way to sunshine, fires were extinguished, and snowfall arrived as auspiciously foretold. Their blessings for the state and people were ever-present. Jia memorialized the court, and they were further enfeoffed as kings: the first as *Lingwei Zhonghui Lanshun Wang*, the second as *Lingying Zhongli Fushun Wang*, the third as *Lingzhu Zhongwei Zuoshun Wang*, the fourth as *Lingyou Zhongji Zhushun Wang*, and the fifth as *Lingyong Zhonglie Chuxiang Wang*.\n\n**Xi Chu Bawang**\nXi Chu Bawang was none other than Xiang Yu. His temple stands forty *li* northeast of Hezhou, by the Wu River where he chose not to cross. Though the mountain is not high, its grasses and trees exude a chilling aura, and even the temple guardians dare not dwell near its slopes. Legend holds that the temple once faced the river, but a sunken boat obstructed the way. A traveler consoled the spirit with the verse, *\"The Han house now belongs to another,\"* and the temple’s orientation shifted. When the Jin ruler Hailing sought to cross the Yangtze, he prayed for omens but was denied. Enraged, he ordered the temple burned. Suddenly, a great serpent emerged from afar, and the beams of the hall and the trees behind the temple rustled as if thousands of soldiers had arrived. Hailing was terrified, and his retinue scattered in panic. A poem by Xu Biao reads:\n*Through a thousand years of rise and fall, fret not in vain,*\n*The Han’s great deeds now lie in ruins and dust.*\n*Only the grasses on the plain where Lady Yu once stood*\n*Dance on in the spring wind, unwilling to cease.*\n\n**Yiyong Wu’an Wang**\nBorn on the thirteenth day of the fifth month, Yiyong Wu’an Wang, surnamed Guan, named Yu, and styled Yunchang, hailed from Xieliang in Pu Prefecture. At the end of the Han, he joined Zhang Fei of Zhuo Commandery to assist Liu Xuande in raising righteous troops. Later, at Wolong Ridge in Nanyang, they thrice visited the thatched cottage to invite Zhuge Liang, carving the land into three kingdoms, with Shu as their state. Xuande appointed Guan Yu as Governor of Jingzhou. Alas, Lü Meng’s schemes led to his death, though he remained unyielding in integrity. Posthumously honored as *Grand General*, he was buried at Yuquan Mountain, where the locals, moved by his virtue, offered seasonal sacrifices. For his protection of the state and the people, his temple was named *Yiyong Wu’an Wang*. Emperor Huizong of the Song bestowed upon him the honorific *Chongning Zhidao Zhenjun*.\n\n**Lingling Wang**\nLingling Wang, surnamed Tang, named Shiyu, and styled Changtu, was originally from Lingling.",

During the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of the Tang, bandits arose, and Shiyu rallied local militia to defend the village. Liu Jianfeng appointed him Prefect of Yongzhou. In the early Guanghua era, Ma Fu attacked the city, and Shiyu died without surrender. Later, the sound of war drums was heard for days, and a log once floated from the cave, coming to rest at Stone Carving Peak. When people sent it back to the middle of the river, it returned by dawn the next day—this occurred several times. During a drought, prayers for rain were answered, so the log was carved into an image and enshrined. Today, temples stand both south of the prefectural city and at Stone Thorn Shore, both highly efficacious.

Coincidentally, Li and Ye Zuyi took the provincial examination, and Li dreamed the deity placed a slice of dog meat on the table, bidding him to eat it, then pointed to a bundle of bamboo below the hall—its meaning unclear. The following year, Li became *zhuangyuan* (top scorer) and realized the dog meat on the table formed the characters for \"zhuangyuan,\" while the bamboo bundle signified the examination’s policy questions.

The Bodhisattva had an elder brother named Wannian, whose father had been conscripted to campaign in Liaodong. His mother, Madam Cheng, longed for news of him. The Duke said, \"This is easily done.\" He then informed his mother and set off, returning by dusk. When he delivered the letter, the neighbors were astonished, for divine soldiers stood guard on either side, their presence majestic and solemn. In the fourth year of the Xianheng era (673 CE), Emperor Gaozong summoned him, but he did not respond. Empress Wu later bestowed upon him a brocade robe and a jade belt. On the eighth day of the twelfth month in the second year of the Jingyun era (711 CE), the Master passed away in Chang’an at the age of eighty, the air suffused with an extraordinary fragrance. The Song dynasty posthumously enfeoffed him as Minister of Works and granted him the title Duke of the State.\n\n**Marshal Zhao, born on the fifteenth day of the third month**\nMarshal Zhao, whose personal name was Gongming, was a native of Zhongnan Mountain. From the Qin dynasty onward, he secluded himself in the mountains, cultivating the supreme Dao. Upon achieving perfection, he was summoned by the Jade Emperor’s decree to serve as Vice Marshal of the Divine Empyrean. According to records, the Marshal was born of the radiant transformation of the Primordial Chaos of the Heavenly Purity, his position corresponding to *qian* (Heaven), embodying the convergence of Metal and Water in the Black (North). His attire—a helmet of iron and an iron whip in hand—signifies Metal encountering Water in Black. His dark complexion and beard represent the Black of the North. Riding a tiger symbolizes the Metal phase. Thus, as the embodiment of Water within Metal, he becomes the instrument of the Dao, the principle of all principles. Without thunder and lightning, his might would not be manifest. His abode is the Western Terrace of Mount Taihua, and as Marshal, he is styled the Golden Wheel, also reflecting the Metal phase of the West. The Marshal’s duties, under the command of the Heavenly Gate, include patrolling the Three Realms, inspecting the Five Directions, overseeing the Nine Provinces, and serving as Grand General of the Palace Guard and Censor of the Northern Pole. When the Celestial Master of the Han, Zhang Daoling, refined the Great Elixir, the Dragon Spirit petitioned the Emperor to dispatch the fierce divine officers for its protection. Thus, the Marshal received the Jade Emperor’s decree to assume the office of Marshal Zhao of the Orthodox Unity Mysterious Altar. \"Orthodox\" (*zheng*) ensures no heterodoxy intrudes; \"Unity\" (*yi*) ensures singular devotion without duality. This office is of the utmost gravity. After the Celestial Master’s ascension, the Marshal was permanently stationed at the Dragon-Tiger Mountain, where, during the Three Primordials’ altar rites for transmitting the precepts, he oversees those who accumulate merit, atone for transgressions, and those stubborn and unenlightened. Hence, the Dragon-Tiger Mysterious Altar serves as the bureau of rewards and punishments. His subordinates include the Eight Mighty Kings, corresponding to the Eight Trigrams; the Six Toxic Deities, corresponding to the celestial, terrestrial, annual, monthly, daily, and hourly baleful stars; the Five Thunder Gods and Five Fierce Soldiers, corresponding to the Five Phases; and the Twenty-Eight Generals, corresponding to the Twenty-Eight Constellations. The Heaven-Harmonizing and Earth-Uniting Generals symbolize the opening and closing of the Heavenly Gate and Earthly Portal. The Water and Fire Battalions represent the cyclical movements of spring’s generation and autumn’s harvest. Commanding thunder, dispatching thunder, summoning rain, calling winds, dispelling pestilence, exorcising malevolent spirits, healing the sick, and averting disasters—none surpass the Marshal’s merits. In matters of litigation, the Marshal ensures just resolution; in commerce, he guarantees fair profit and harmonious transactions. Whatever is righteous and equitable may be prayed to the Marshal, and all shall be as one wishes. His titles include: Heavenly Sage, Supreme Marshal of the Jade Mansion of the Divine Empyrean, Inspector-General of the Five Directions, Chief Overseer of the Nine Provinces’ Earth Altars, Grand General of the Palace Guard, Vice Marshal and Censor of the Northern Pole, Grand Marshal of the Three Realms, Illustrious and Resolute Marquis, Arbiter of Destiny, Commander of the Twenty-Eight Constellations, Marshal of the Orthodox Unity Mysterious Altar, and Flying Tiger Golden Wheel Dharma Marshal Zhao.\n\n**Marshal Peng**\nMarshal Peng, whose surname was Peng and personal name Tingjian, once served as magistrate of Chong’an County, where he suppressed bandits as easily as crushing dry weeds. For his merits, during the Zhizheng era of the Yuan dynasty, he was repeatedly promoted to Vice Marshal of the Fujian Pacification Office. When bandits arose, Peng subdued them one by one. Later, he was ambushed and killed when his horse stumbled. The bandits struck him, yet his body remained upright, his eyes rolled upward, his beard and hair bristling as if blown by the wind, deterring them from approaching. After some time, the disturbance ceased, and his former subordinates escorted his coffin back to Chong’an. The people mourned him as they would their parents, erecting a temple with his likeness to perpetuate his worship. In times of drought, flood, or pestilence, they hastened to pray, and the Marshal’s divine response was as swift as an echo. The common folk called him Marshal Peng. Neighboring counties also established temples in his honor, and his efficacy was equally manifest.\n\n**Marquis Runji**\nThe Marquis, a general of the Later Wei, bore the personal name Yuan. During a military campaign, he encamped at Baibiao Mountain in Fenzhou, where his troops suffered from thirst. The soldiers grew restless. The Marquis dismounted, knelt, and vowed to Heaven, pledging his life. Suddenly, his horse pawed the ground, and a spring gushed forth. Ever since, the flowing waters of this miraculous source have irrigated the land, benefiting all beings, its efficacy enduring. The locals built a temple before Baibiao Mountain, where his divine responses were particularly extraordinary. The Song dynasty bestowed the temple plaque *Shui Ze* (\"Water Nourishment\") and enfeoffed the deity as Marquis Runji. In the eleventh year of the Hongwu era of the present dynasty (1378 CE), he was styled the Spirit of Baibiao Mountain’s Horse-Pawed Spring, and officials offered sacrifices in spring and autumn.\n\n**Marquis Weiji**\nThe Marquis, surnamed Li and bearing the personal name Lu’an, was a native of Tongzhuang in Changxing County, Jizhou. Born on the eighteenth day of the first month of the third year of the Chongning era of Emperor Huizong of the Song (1104 CE), a *jiashen* day, he possessed an extraordinary constitution from youth. Solemn and dignified, he spoke only when necessary. When villagers faced impending fortune or misfortune, he could foresee and warn them in advance.",

The common people call it the *Great King of Jinshan*.\n\n**Wan Jiong, Duke of the State**\nWan Hui Gong was a native of Quexiang in Haozhou.",

Thereafter, numerous spiritual traces manifested in his hometown: the abundance or scarcity of the year’s harvest, the success or failure of the early and late crops—all were revealed through the medium of shamans, as precise as a seal matching its impression or a key fitting its lock.

From childhood, he pursued his studies, reciting a thousand words daily without indulging in the games of other boys. Thus, he was named Ziyu.\n\nIn the seventh year of the Zhenguan era of Emperor Taizong of the Tang (633 CE), an imperial edict summoned the worthy and virtuous from across the land to the capital, where they were appointed to office. The Prefect was among them, each granted the rank of county magistrate. He was assigned as magistrate of Changzi County in Luzhou. Upright and impartial, his discernment was as keen as autumn down. The people of the prefecture said of him, \"Our magistrate governs the yang realm by day and judges the yin courts by night.\"\n\nIn the fifth month, the magistrate issued a proclamation to the townsfolk: \"On the fifteenth day of this month and the day following, no living beings may be killed, nor may hunting or archery be practiced. Those who violate this decree will be punished in the official courts and held accountable in the courts of the yin realm.\" At that time, two men secretly ventured beyond the city walls and shot a hare. Upon entering the city gate, they were apprehended by the guards and brought before the magistrate. He questioned them, saying, \"You have willfully violated the decree. Do you wish to receive punishment here in the county court or in the yin courts?\" The men replied, \"We beg to receive punishment in the yin courts,\" believing the yin judgment would be less immediate. With that, they were released to return home.\n\nThat very night, as they lay down to sleep, a yellow-robed clerk suddenly summoned them to a grand hall. There, they saw Magistrate Cui, adorned in the regalia of a king, reviewing the records of their transgressions. Some had their lifespans shortened, others their descendants doomed, and still others their official stipends revoked. \"Your good and evil deeds shall be judged accordingly,\" he declared, then sent them back to their homes. Startled awake, the men were filled with awe.\n\nOne day, a gate clerk reported, \"On Peng Huang Ridge, a fierce tiger blocks the road and harms travelers.\" The magistrate dispatched his chief clerk, Meng Wan, bearing an official summons to the mountain shrine to apprehend the tiger. The tiger emerged, took the summons in its mouth, and followed the clerk to the magistrate’s hall. Magistrate Cui rebuked it, saying, \"You are but a beast, yet you devour human lives.

Five *li* southwest of the county lay a river, which in summer often overflowed, flooding the fields of the local people. Magistrate Cui erected an altar by the riverbank and presented a memorial to the August Emperor. Shortly after, a massive serpent surfaced in the water and perished.

They announced, \"We are sent by the August Emperor,\" and were followed by attendants bearing jade tablets, jade belts, purple robes, and the banners of the Five Peaks and Wei. Over a hundred more arrived, bowed, and stood in attendance as *xiao* and *shao* music played on strings and bamboo. Then a deity led forth a white horse. The magistrate said, \"Wait a moment,\" and called his two sons, saying, \"I am about to depart this world; do not grieve excessively.\" He took up brush and paper and wrote a hundred-character inscription to instruct his sons. The sons wept as they bowed and received his final words. With that, he passed away at the age of sixty-four.\n\nLater, his son Xuan rendered meritorious service and was appointed governor of Yuzhang. He discerned the people’s desires and aversions, gathering what they favored and removing what they disliked. Governance flowed smoothly, the people lived in harmony, and his administrative achievements were widely acclaimed. Later, while leading troops in Pingxiang, he perished in the turmoil of Wang Dun’s rebellion. A temple was established fifty *li* east of Pingxiang County, at the very site of his death.

His temple stands in Meizhou’s Shuguan Town. According to records, Hua Jingding followed Cui Guangyuan into Shu during the Zhide era of the Tang to suppress Duan Zizhen, for which he was enfeoffed as Duke of Jiaxiang County. Later, he clashed with a formidable bandit chieftain. Shouting fiercely in battle from dawn to dusk, his ranks were nearly annihilated, yet he fought on alone, his head already severed, still astride his horse with spear in hand. Arriving at the town, he dismounted to wash his hands, when a girl spinning silk in the courtyard asked: *\"Why wash when you have no head?\"* He then collapsed. The locals buried him by the stream, and through the ages, his temple has been venerated, his numinous traces resplendent. Du Fu’s song reads:\n*\"Chengdu’s fierce marshal, Marshal Hua—\nEven babes learning to speak know his name.\nSwift as hawk or kite, fire and wind his pace,\nFacing foes, his body light as if weightless.\"*\n\n**The Spirits of Mount Hua**\nThree spirits are revered: the first, Fuqi Xi of the Jin; the second, his disciple Wang Bao; the third, his disciple Guo Ji. Together they are known as the Three Immortals of Huagai. Their sacred precinct lies on Xianhua Mountain in Chongren, Fuzhou—a towering temple that pierces the clouds, renowned for its potent efficacy. When scholars or commoners face calamities, illnesses, or epidemics, all flock to pray at the shrine. Supplicants first purify themselves through fasting, then at the appointed time, carry incense and silk, walking in solemn procession as if treading upon pearls. Those arriving ride swiftly along the main road, while those departing stand with hands clasped to the left, none daring to overstep. The chant of *\"Amitābha\"* resounds across the fields, much like the pilgrims at Mount Tai or Wudang’s Taihe.

      "translated_text": "Master Huang practiced the arts of the *wu*-medium and could lash out at ghosts and demons to drive away malevolent spirits. His shrine stands southwest of the Shanghang county seat. Originally located in the stone gorge of Zhongliao Market, it was later relocated to its present site. Legend tells that long ago, mountain sprites and stone demons wrought havoc, and the medium Huang the Seventh Lord subdued them with talismanic arts. Concealing himself within the rock, he never emerged, yet his likeness remained faintly visible upon the stone wall, so lifelike it seemed the immortal master’s image. An old poem says:\n\n*No god’s sharp blade, no demon’s claw,*\n*Yet mists arise, clouds form anew.*\n*The master once entered the mountain stone—*\n*How many springs have passed in moss and dew?*\n\n**Jiangdong Spirit Lots**\nBorn on the eighth day of the first lunar month, the lot-divining spirit surnamed Shi, named Gu, was a native of Gan County during the Qin dynasty. After his death, he became a spirit. On overcast, misty days or in the faint moonlight of deep night, villagers often saw him appear with an entourage like a high official. Having received office in the netherworld, he oversees its affairs. People built a shrine for him, offering jade and silk, and sought his counsel on fortune and misfortune, receiving answers as if he were present. His divine responses proved ever more efficacious, so they composed a hundred rhymed verses to serve as lots. The spirit’s responses through them were unfailingly precise. The shrine lies five *li* east of the Gong River outside Ganzhou Prefecture’s city walls, hence its name, Jiangdong Spirit Lots. It has since been celebrated as an illustrious name. In the present dynasty, Song Lian wrote an essay to record its history.\n\n**Lord Xieji**\nLord Xieji was a pair of deities. The two brothers, surnamed Zeng, valued integrity and scorned wealth, delighting in generosity. Their fraternal bond was especially deep. During the Three Kingdoms period, when warfare raged, they retreated together to the Nine Sons Mountain in Qingyang—now known as Mount Jiuhua. After their deaths, they manifested divine powers to aid the people in times of disaster, warding off calamities and achieving great merit. The townsfolk, marveling at their virtue, built two shrines to honor the brothers, one on the eastern side of Mount Jiuhua and the other on the western side. During the Daguan era of the Song dynasty, the shrines were granted the name Xieji Temple. To this day, offerings are made with ever greater reverence, and prayers are answered without fail.\n\n**Marquis Lingyi**\nThe marquis surnamed Gou—his given name is unknown—was a native of Longzhou in Fengxiang Prefecture. His shrine stands to the left of the Longzhou county seat. An inscription on its stele records that in the second year of the Dali era of the Tang dynasty, when the old city walls were in disrepair, a man of the Gou clan donated land for a new city, and the walls were relocated there. The military officers found it advantageous, so they built a shrine to honor him. The spirit’s divine efficacy grew ever more manifest, and all who prayed to him received answers as if he were present. The Song dynasty enfeoffed him as Marquis Lingyi and granted his shrine the name Anyou. In the present dynasty, the shrine was renovated and expanded, and those who maintain its rites come in even greater numbers.\n\n**Zhang Zhaolie**\nZhang Zhaolie, surnamed Zhang, was a native of Huatai during the Five Dynasties period. After his death, he became a spirit and displayed divine efficacy. His shrine stands in Qianyang County of Langzhou Prefecture. During the Song dynasty, when the rebel Pan Zongyan led his forces to attack the city, they had not yet reached the moat when they saw an army emerging from the city—some with green faces and fangs bared, others with red beards and crimson armor, still others with ox necks, horse faces, four arms, or double forks. Some stood over a *zhang* tall, while others were no more than two or three *chi*. They leapt and howled, surging forward like a swarm, spewing fire and smoke in a thousand grotesque forms, like ghosts and demons.

The present dynasty further revered and worshipped him.\n\n**Minister Zhang the Seventh**\nMinister Zhang, whose surname was Zhang and who was the seventh in his generation, was a native of Macheng County during the Song dynasty. He once studied the Daoist arts under an extraordinary master, gaining their essential teachings. He could summon and command ghosts and spirits, and knew the affairs of the netherworld. Thus, he destroyed the temples along the Yangtze and struck down prisons. Once, a fire broke out in the southeast corner of the city, spreading to hundreds of households and throwing the entire city into chaos. The minister emerged from prison riding a white horse, wielding a short staff. Pointing east, the fire in the east was extinguished; pointing west, the fire in the west died out. The same held true for the south and north, and the fire was immediately quelled. He then proceeded to the Wunao Mountain in the northwest of the city, where both man and horse transformed. When the matter was reported to the authorities, the prison officers inspected the cell and found the door still tightly sealed as before. All were astonished. A temple was then built at the site of his transformation. It is said that when scholars and commoners pay their respects, the clothing and belongings they leave along the road remain untouched. If any wicked or obstinate individuals attempt to pass, they become lost and cannot find their way out. His divine responses were the most renowned in the region.\n\n**Minister Geng the Seventh**\nThe temple of Minister Geng stands fifteen *li* northwest of Gaoyou Prefecture in Yangzhou. According to local elders, he was a native of Liangshan Marsh in Dongping, born with a chivalrous spirit. With a single cry and his sword raised high, he embodied the valor of the ancient heroes Meng Ben and Xia Yu. Though Liangshan Marsh was famed as a gathering place for heroes, all its leaders deferred to him, submitting as if he were the wind beneath their wings. When the army marched south, he fell ill and died within the prefecture’s borders. His divine efficacy became widely manifest, and all prayers to him were answered. The Song dynasty bestowed upon him the title \"Kangze Xia\" (Chivalrous Flood Controller). To this day, both local residents and travelers by boat offer him sacrifices.\n\n**General Sun**\nGeneral Sun, whose surname was Sun and given name Shan, was a man of the Five Dynasties period. His temple stands west of the county seat of Ninghua. Whenever there was illness or drought, prayers to him were immediately answered. It is said that once a thief stole a quantity of jewelry from a villager. Fearing capture, he hid the goods beneath the seat of the deity. When he returned to retrieve them, the jewelry had vanished. After searching repeatedly to no avail, he suspected someone else had taken them. Ten days later, the victim’s family, in mutual distress, swore an oath before the deity. No sooner had they kowtowed than they noticed something yellow and white in the crevice of a brick. Upon opening it, they found the stolen goods. His divine traces were many. The Song dynasty minister Li Gang wrote a poem:\n\n*Unfearing of exile in straw sandals to the distant south,*\n*The divine banner of your vow aids the northern campaign.*\n*With a cup of wine poured, I wipe my tearful eyes—*\n*Through the mist and clouds, where lie the two capitals?*\n\n**General Zhang**\nGeneral Zhang, whose surname was Zhang and given name Xiaozhong, was a scholar from Huai.",

      "translated_text": "The temple stands on Yuzhen Mountain in Anren County, Raozhou Prefecture. When the Yuan forces reached Anren, Judicial Commissioner Xie Fangde mobilized the loyal and filial to resist them. The two sides clashed at Tuan Lake, stalemating for days. In a fierce battle, arrows were exhausted, and the loyal and filial general wielded twin blades, slaying over a hundred men before falling to a stray arrow. The bandits entered Anren, but suddenly, at midnight, the southeastern corner of the city erupted with drums, horns, and roaring cries, as if thousands of troops and horses surged forth. The bandit commander rushed to observe—under the faint moonlight and dim stars, he saw the general astride a white horse, brandishing twin blades amidst the clouds and mist, charging back and forth. The commander bowed in apology. Once order was restored, locals often witnessed him riding swiftly, blade in hand, his grievances unavenged. They erected a shrine at the site of his death to worship him, and many divine wonders manifested. Yuan dynasty’s Ouyang Yan wrote an account of this.\n\n**King Shunji**\nThe temple of King Shunji is located on Haocheng Mountain in Xinjian County, commonly known as \"Little Dragon Cloud.\" Legend holds it is the offspring of the great serpent slain by the Perfected Ones Hao and Xu. During the Song dynasty, he was enfeoffed as King Shunji. Emperor Zhenzong composed an imperial inscription, *The Stone Carving to Ward Off Flood Dragons*, and in the Xining era, the Court of Imperial Sacrifices dispatched Lin Xiyi to offer sacrifices. An unusual serpent fell onto the altar. The next morning, as the rites began, the serpent raised its head in anticipation. Upon completion, it slithered along the tables and chairs, then into the tent. When Lin Xiyi departed, the serpent followed, its tail dragging like an axle, escorting him to Pengli Lake before vanishing. Later, Su Shi, returning north from exile in Huan’er, moored his iron boat at the temple. He discovered an ancient stone arrowhead by the shore, but while passing it among his attendants, it slipped into the river. He prayed to the deity, vowing to leave it in the temple if recovered. Sending men to search the waters, they retrieved it in a single attempt. Su Shi then composed a record of the event.\n\n**Dragon Lord of Hengpu**\nThe Dragon Lord’s surname and given name are unknown. His temple stands in the prefectural seat of Nan’an, Jiangxi, named Hengpu after an ancient commandery. According to the *Record of Words and Deeds*, Hengpu, in the scorching south, rarely sees snow even in deep winter, yet pestilence is rampant. The Dragon Lord’s temple grants every prayer. Zhang Jiucheng remarked, \"Though I hold no office, my annual salary is depleted. Why not seek his favor?\" He prayed, and at dawn, while the sun shone brightly, dark clouds suddenly gathered. By dusk, snow had accumulated an inch deep, astonishing the locals. At the time, Jiucheng served as Vice Minister of Rites, but Qin Hui despised his remonstrations and demoted him to prefect of Junzhou. Later, Qin instigated censors to accuse him of slandering the court, exiling him further to Nan’an. Thus, his devotion to the Dragon Lord was as described. In the present dynasty, his temple was rebuilt, and its sacrifices grew ever more revered.\n\n**Five Dragon Deities of Daozhou**\nThe temple stands beside the Five Dragon Well in Daozhou. According to Yan Shu’s *Essentials*, when Tang dynasty’s Yang Cheng was appointed governor of Daozhou, five elders approached him in Xiangyang, claiming to be from Chongling. Cheng gave them silk and asked their residence. They replied, \"Five *li* northwest of the city.\" Upon arrival, he found only the Five Dragon Well, with the silk still there. He built a temple, which repeatedly displayed divine wonders. The temple plaque reads *Chongying* (\"Manifest Response\"). An old poem on its walls reads:\n\n*The mountain’s chill—coiled dragons stir from sleep,*\n*Yellow-robed elders tread the crags below.*\n*Clutching gnarled vines of a thousand years,*\n*They hide their names lest mortals come to know.*\n\n**Marquis Zhaoling**\nMarquis Zhaoling, surnamed Zhang and named Lusi, was from Nanyang. During the early Sui dynasty, he settled in Baishe Village, Pin County. At sixteen, he passed the *Mingjing* examination. In the Jinglong era of the Tang, he served as magistrate of Xuancheng, renowned for his talent and ability.",

      "translated_text": "Lady Shi bore him nine sons. After resigning from his post in Xuancheng, he often fished on the northern bank of Jiaoshi Terrace. One day, he looked back to see palaces and towers where he had been fishing, and so he entered to dwell there, departing at night and returning at dawn. One morning, he felt a chill and fever. His wife asked him about it, and he said, \"I am a dragon. A certain Zheng Xiangyuan, also a dragon, has encroached upon this dwelling. Tomorrow, we shall contend for it, and I will have our nine sons assist me. The one with the crimson aura is I; the one with the blue-green aura is Zheng.\" The next day, the nine sons shot arrows at the blue-green aura, striking it in anger before it departed. The lord pursued it, carving valleys and ravines as they passed, until they reached the Huai River. There, the blue-green aura flung itself into the western mountains of Hefan and perished—this place is called Longxue Mountain. The nine sons all transformed into dragons, while Lady Shi was buried at Guanzhou.\n\nThe lord’s elder brother had been a cavalry and infantry commander, and his descendants scattered to live around Pin Mountain; their tombs remain to this day. The account is recorded in the writings of the Tang commoner Zhao Geng and transmitted through the oral traditions of elders in the Huai and Pin regions. It is also documented in *Collected Antiquities* by Ouyang Wenzhong.\n\nSince the Jinglong era, the people of Pin have offered sacrifices to him at Jiaoshi Terrace. In the second year of Qianning, Prefect Wang Jingyao expanded the temple. During the Qiande reign of the Song, when Caizhou suffered a severe drought, its prefect, Si Chao, having heard of the lord’s divine power, built a shrine to him in Cai. After the rains came, Hanlin Academician Cheng Xi and Tao Gu recorded the event. From then on, from Huainan to Chen, Cai, Xu, and Ru, people flocked to worship him.\n\nIn the Jingde era, Remonstrance Grand Master Zhang Bing, by imperial decree, further renovated the shrine in Pin. During the Xining reign, Minister of the Bureau of Sacrifices Zhang Hui petitioned for an honorific title, and an edict was issued conferring upon the lord the title *Marquis Zhaoling* and upon Lady Shi the title *Lady Rouying*. The temple has five caves, where divine wonders are often seen—clouds and rain emerge, or vessels cast into the caves appear on the ground. In recent years, molted bones have been found in the pond. A golden bell, Wang Zhi, varies in weight unpredictably; it is now kept in the temple.\n\nIn the autumn of the sixth year of Yuanyou, during a severe drought, the prefect, Dragon Diagram Academician and Gentleman for Court Audiences Left Su Shi, had the bones conveyed to the temporary shrine by West Lake. There, he and the officials and people prayed, and the response was as before. Thus, the temple was further restored.\n\n**Dragon Spirit of Yang Mountain**",

      "translated_text": "The deities are two dragons, and their temple stands on Yang Mountain in Yuanzhou Prefecture. According to legend, a villager named Xu Tan was once sailing past Great Lone Mountain when he encountered two scholars named Xiao, who said they resided on Yang Mountain in Yichun. Xu took them aboard and brought them home. Upon reaching the eastern shore, they bade farewell, promising to meet again at Stone Bridge. Later, when Xu arrived at the spot, he saw two dragons and realized they were the gods of Yang Mountain. During the Huichang era of the Tang, one night of thunder and rain, the temple was relocated to Wenming Quarter south of the prefectural seat. In the Song, the temple was granted the plaque *Fu Hui* (\"Trust and Grace\"). During the Yuan, it was rebuilt, and the people revered the two gods with utmost devotion, their prayers invariably answered. In the present dynasty, the god of Great Yang Mountain was enfeoffed, and sacrifices are offered in spring and autumn. Additionally, in Linggang of Fenyi, there is a branch shrine, said to be where the gods once moored their boat.\n\nThe shrine of the Yellow Stone Elder is located on the southern slope of Gucheng Mountain in Dong’e County. Formerly, during the Han, Zhang Liang encountered an old man at the Yi Bridge in Xiapei, who sat with legs sprawled and ordered Liang to fetch his shoes. Liang reluctantly complied. The old man, pleased, said, \"This youth is teachable,\" and bestowed upon him a book, adding, \"Thirteen years hence, beneath the Yellow Stone on Gucheng Mountain north of Qi, you will find me.\" Later, Liang studied the book and applied its strategies, aiding Emperor Gaozu of Han in overthrowing Qin and vanquishing Xiang Yu, bringing peace to the realm. He was enfeoffed as Marquis of Liu. As foretold, he found the Yellow Stone on Gucheng Mountain, treasured it, and established a shrine to honor it. In the present dynasty, the temple was further expanded, and officials are commanded to offer sacrifices annually on the eighteenth day of the third month.\n\nThe Stone Spirit’s temple lies east of the prefectural city of Lianzhou. Legend tells of a fisherman who, while at sea, saw a large stone floating on the tide. Sensing its divinity, he prayed, \"If I catch fish as I wish, I shall build a shrine in gratitude.\" His wish was granted, so he hoisted the stone and set off home to discuss where to erect the temple. At Yangmei Mountain, the rope suddenly snapped, and the stone could not be moved further. There, at the spot where the rope broke, he cleared the brush, raised pillars, and built a shrine. Since then, prayers for rain or drought relief have always been answered. A traveler once passed the temple and inscribed a poem on its wall:\n\n*A giant turtle’s hand cleft chaos wide,*\n*The sacred stone stands firm where heaven meets tide.*\n*In summer’s sixth moon, yin’s cold snow flies,*\n*While dragons and oysters dance ‘neath weeping waves’ cries.*\n\nThe Divine Stones of Chu Xiong\nThere are two in Chu Xiong. One lies five *li* west of Nan’an Prefecture, a colossal stone over ten *zhang* tall. The Meng clan called it the *God of the Southern Marchmount, the Spirit Who Pacifies the Frontier*, and the locals annually place gold on its summit, their prayers invariably answered. The other stands atop Lumo Mountain, thirty *li* southwest of Chu Xiong County, resembling a human figure, about eight *chi* tall, its crown jutting like a slanted hat. The locals affix gold to its face and revere it with great care. An ancient poem reads:\n\n*Who knows beyond the Golden Horse and Green Rooster’s reign,*\n*Where mist-wreathed peaks coil in the wild frontier’s domain?*",

From then on, residents near the bay claimed that every night, the sound of a bell rang from its depths, as if battling dragons. The monks chiseled away the \"dragon horns\" atop the bell, and the clashes ceased. Later, the bay was named Bell Bay.

      "translated_text": "Per the *Rites of Zhou*, the *xiaoren* conducted winter sacrifices to the Horse Spirit *Bu*, which is this very entity. Thus, its annotation states: \"The Horse Spirit *Bu* is the deity that brings disaster to horses.\" A temple stands on Liangzi Lake south of Wuchang County. Former customs dictated sacrifices in the second month at the great marsh on a *gang* day, but now the county’s people generally hold their offerings on the fifth day of the fifth month during the dragon-boat races. This, too, is said to be an old Wu custom. An ancient poem reads:\n\nThe palaces of the Wu king crumble into flying dust,\nWhile wild birds and hidden blossoms each claim their spring.\nBy Liangzi Lake, the warhorses of old remain—\nEven now they roar, haunting the people of Wuchang.\n\n**Green Snake Spirit**\nA shrine stands in Huanzhou of Qingyang Prefecture. Early temple records state that during the Tang, when Regional Commander Yang Chaochen encamped at Fangqu to build a fortress, he felled trees along the road to block the Tubo advance. Parched for water, he saw a green snake descend a perilous slope, and where its trail led, water began to flow. Chaochen ordered a dam built to encircle the spot, forming a deep pool where his troops drank their fill. The Tubo, seeing this, withdrew in full retreat. Chaochen marveled greatly and reported the event to the court. An imperial edict ordered a shrine built to honor the spirit, naming the spring *Yingsheng* (\"Responding to the Sacred\"). The deity’s manifest efficacy led people far and near to offer livestock and silk, and many relied on its aid for relief from drought, flood, illness, and plague.\n\n**Golden Horse and Azure Fowl**\nThese are two spirits. The Golden Horse Spirit’s temple lies west of Golden Horse Mountain, while the Azure Fowl Spirit’s temple stands east of Azure Fowl Mountain. According to records from Emperor Xuan of Han, a fangshi claimed that in Yizhou there were a Golden Horse and Azure Fowl that could be summoned through sacrifice. The emperor dispatched Wang Bao to perform the rites, but he died in Shu. Yan Shigu noted that the Golden Horse resembled a horse in form, and the Azure Fowl a fowl—indeed, Golden Horse and Azure Fowl Mountains face each other across Dianchi Lake, where ten-thousand-zhang cliffs plunge into a thousand-fathom expanse of green water. The moon’s reflection shimmers on the still waves, and clouds stretch across the peaks: one of Yunnan’s finest vistas. Thus, the two spirits dwell there, manifesting their numinous transformations.\n\nA poem by Zhang Xiongfei of the Yuan reads:\nFrom the northern palace, I bid farewell to the vermilion phoenix,\nTo gaze southward at the Azure Fowl.\nThe jade throne shifts to the purple terrace,\nWhile golden mud dampens the jasper grass.\nAfter rain, dragons return to their caves;\nWhen wind rises, tigers cross the streams.\nSeeking plum blossoms, I tread bamboo paths,\nGathering herbs, I climb pine ladders.\n\n**Golden Essence**\nGolden Essence is the essence of the planet Venus. Legend holds that during the Han, a man of Ningdu County named Zhang Jinhua had a daughter called Liying. Born with auspicious features, she could foretell the fortunes of the people. Fifteen *li* northwest of the county stood a mountain, solitary and towering, where at fifteen she entered to cultivate the Dao and attained transcendence. When Wu Yin, Prince of Changsha, heard of her and sought her hand, Liying refused. She ascended to the mountain’s heights and declared: \"Within this mountain is a stone chamber leading to a grotto-heaven. If you can tunnel through, we may meet.\" Yin dispatched troops to excavate the passage. When it opened, they saw the maiden riding a purple cloud in midair, who said: \"I am the essence of Venus, sent to govern this mountain.\" With that, she departed. Later generations named the mountain Golden Essence Mountain, and Daoists regard it as the thirty-fifth blessed land.\n\n**Fire Essence**\nBorn on the thirty-second day of the sixth month, the spirit’s surname is Song, given name Wuji, a man of the Han. From birth, he possessed divine marvels and was the essence of fire. During the Tang, Niu Sengru established a temple to him to avert fire disasters. The temple lies seven *li* east of Wuchang Prefecture’s city walls, originally called \"Lord Song’s Shrine.\" To avoid the taboo of Yang Hao’s name, it was later renamed \"Grand Constitution.\"\n\nAccording to the Tang, when Wei Jian was appointed Regional Commander of Wuchang, he dreamed before departing of a crimson-robed attendant leading dozens of followers, who bowed to him and said: \"My lord, you are about to govern Ezhu. My humble abode lies in ruins, and none but you can restore it.\" Upon arrival, he sought out Wuji’s temple and found the statue identical to the figure in his dream. He then demolished and rebuilt it. During the Shaoxing era of the Song, Prefect Wang Xin further expanded its scale.",

According to records, the guard’s southwestern frontier borders the Luopu Man, who were rebellious and frequently raided the border. A general named Meng Shu led troops to suppress them but suffered repeated defeats. Overwhelmed, he rested among his officers, spear for a pillow, and fell asleep. In a dream, a spirit declared, *\"I am the Great King Mo Cuo. I know your battles have not gone well and wish to lend my aid.\"* Meng Shu, half-awake, bowed in gratitude. Upon waking, he still heard the clamor of blades and horses. The next day in battle, the Luopu Man scattered in disarray, as if beset from all sides, and soon surrendered in submission.

      "translated_text": "Queen Mother Xiang, née Shi, dreamed one night of a colossal star entering her hand, its radiance dazzling—she opened her mouth and swallowed it. Upon waking, she found herself with child, carrying the babe for twenty-six months before giving birth. At first, the prince could not speak, but at the age of seven or eight, upon seeing a Daoist inscribe a talisman, he suddenly clutched the man’s robe and cried out, *\"I! I! I!\"* From that moment, his speech was as fluent as a grown man’s. As he matured, his Daoist arts flourished: his incantations over water and talismanic methods were unlike any inherited tradition, yet unfailingly efficacious. After his death, he became a spirit in his birthplace, tunneling through mountains and piercing stone—vanishing into the eastern slope only to reappear on the western side, regardless of height or depth. At times, he would split open a boulder and conceal himself within, his divine manifestations too numerous to recount. The villagers erected a shrine in his honor, and whenever they prayed, their pleas were answered.\n\n**Bamboo Prince**\nThe Bamboo Prince was none other than the Marquis of Yelang. His temple stands at the foot of Dongwen Mountain, southeast of Shizhou Guard’s city. According to the *Records of Huayang*, a woman was washing clothes by the water when a three-jointed bamboo floated into her lap. Hearing an infant’s cries from within, she split the bamboo and found a boy, whom she raised. When he came of age, his martial prowess led him to declare himself King of Yelang, taking \"Bamboo\" as his surname. During Emperor Wu of Han’s pacification of the southwestern tribes, the king was slain by the Yi people, who petitioned for his line to continue. The emperor then enfeoffed the king’s three sons as marquises. After his death, the Bamboo Prince was enshrined alongside his father’s temple. In the Chongning era of the Song, the temple was granted the plaque *\"Spirit of Numinous Grace.\"* His descendants multiplied, and veneration of him grew ever more reverent. In the present dynasty’s official sacrifices, he is simply styled *\"Spirit of the King of Yelang.\"*\n\n**Panhu**\nPanhu is the Canine Spirit, progenitor of the present-day Wuling Man tribes of Changsha. His temple stands on Wushan in Luxi County. According to records, when Emperor Gaoxin was plagued by the Dog Rong tribes, he proclaimed that whoever brought him the head of their general, Wu, would be given his youngest daughter in marriage. The emperor’s dog, named Panhu, entered the mountains and returned with a severed head, which proved to be Wu’s. Overjoyed, the emperor hesitated—how could he wed his daughter to a beast? Yet the princess, hearing that a promise could not be broken, insisted on fulfilling it. Reluctantly, the emperor consented. Panhu carried the girl into a cavern in the southern mountains, where, over three years, she bore him six sons and six daughters. After Panhu’s death, the children intermarried. Their mother returned to report the matter to the emperor, who summoned them to court. Clad in motley garments and speaking a halting tongue, they were settled in the region, and their descendants proliferated—hence the Wuling Man. To this day, the local custom forbids the eating of dog meat, and Panhu’s temple remains potent with divine power.\n\n*The Fifth Scroll of* **Records of Divine Marvels** *concludes here.*\n\n*The Sixth Scroll of* **Records of Divine Marvels**\n*Table of Contents*",

Her father was seized by raiders, leaving only his horse behind. Grieving for her father, the maiden refused to eat, prompting her mother to swear before the villagers: *\"Whoever brings my husband home shall have our daughter in marriage.\"*\n\nThe horse, hearing these words, bolted in a frenzy, leaping over fields and fences. Days later, the father returned, riding the very same steed. From then on, the horse neighed incessantly. The mother recounted her vow to the father, who replied: *\"A promise made to men is not binding to beasts. Though this horse saved me from peril—a deed of great merit—our oath cannot be fulfilled.\"*\n\nEnraged, the father sought to kill the horse, but the more he pursued, the more wildly it bucked. Finally, he shot and slew it. The hide was stretched to dry in the courtyard, but suddenly it sprang up, coiled around the girl, and carried her away. Ten days later, the hide came to rest upon a mulberry tree, where the maiden transformed into a silkworm. She fed on the leaves, spinning silk into cocoons, which clothed the people.\n\nOne day, the Silkworm Maiden descended upon a cloud, riding the horse, and spoke to her parents: *\"The Heavenly Emperor, seeing that my heart never forgot righteousness, has bestowed upon me the rank of Celestial Consort.\"*\n\n**The Azure-Robed Deity**\nThe Azure-Robed Deity is none other than Can Cong. According to tradition, Can Cong was first the Marquis of Shu, later proclaimed King of Shu. He once donned azure robes to traverse the countryside, teaching the people the art of sericulture. Moved by his virtue, the villagers erected shrines in his honor. His temples spread throughout the western lands, all famed for their divine efficacy, and the people commonly invoke him as the Azure-Robed Deity. The county of Qingshen derives its name from this legend.\n\nA poem by Xie Fangde of the Song reads:\n\n*\"To feed the mouth and clothe the body, we rely on the mulberry,\nIn the end, it fulfills the Kingly Way, its blessings flowing far.\"*",

Deeply perplexed and uneasy, he sought counsel from village elders, one of whom said, “This must be due to some extraordinary creature you keep.” Then Duan realized it was the conch. He secretly watched and saw a maiden of surpassing beauty. Stepping forward, he bowed and asked her purpose.

According to legend, during the Qin dynasty, an old woman of the Wen clan passed by Cheng Stream and found a giant infant, whom she took into her home. She bore seven dragons and released them into the river. Whenever the old woman later came to the river’s mouth, the dragons would present her with fine fish, as if in offering or sustenance. After her death, she was buried beside Cheng Stream. When the grave was about to collapse, one night a storm of thunder, lightning, wind, and rain arose, hurling stones and sand. At dawn, people saw that the tomb had moved to a high ridge north of the bank. The villagers marveled at this and built a shrine for her. During the Tang dynasty, the temple was granted the name *Xiaotong*; Jie Si of the Yuan dynasty left an account, which also states that the old woman was a native of Yuecheng. During the Taihe era of the Tang, Lu E once dreamed of the old woman, who told him, *\"You will become the magistrate of a Jiangxi county.\"* Later, he indeed governed Fenyang and had a temple built for her; Lu Zhao recorded this.\n\n**Xiaolie General**\nThe general’s name was Mulan, a daughter of the Zhu clan of Chu.

      "translated_text": "The girl’s appetite was extraordinary—when joyful, she could consume a *sheng* or *dou* of food at once, yet at other times, she would abstain from grain for days without discomfort. The villagers marveled at her, and even her parents could not restrain her. She died unwed, and her spirit began to speak through children. The locals consulted her on matters of drought, flood, fortune, and misfortune, and her words never failed to prove true. Thus, they built a temple in her honor. During the Song, she was enfeoffed as the **Lady of Serene Virtue**, and her divine manifestations multiplied. To this day, she is widely worshipped across the Eight Min regions.\n\n**The Fortress General’s Lady**\nThe lady, surnamed Yu, has a temple on Mazhai Ridge in Yingde County. According to old accounts, during the late Tang, when Huang Chao sacked Hengzhou in the west, Lady Yu donned armor and led her brothers and local militia in battle. Huang Chao’s rebels were routed, and Lady Yu perished in the fight. The villagers built a temple at the site of her death, and her spirit proved remarkably responsive. During the Jiatai era of the Song, a rebel general passed through Mazhai Ridge with his troops when suddenly wind, thunder, rain, and hail erupted from the temple. Terrified, the rebels cast aside their armor and fled, sparing the village from harm. The court, upon hearing of the event, bestowed the temple plaque *Numinous Aid*. In the Jiading era, when another minor disturbance arose, the local militia prayed at the temple before engaging the enemy and achieved three victories in a single day, causing the rebels to disperse. She was further enfeoffed as the **Lady of Upright Obedience, Manifest Protection**. Lin Zisheng composed an account of her deeds. By the end of the Song, when the Yuan forces ravaged the land, Yingde and its surroundings alone remained unscathed—many attributed this to the lady’s divine power.\n\n**The Lady of Sincere Reverence**\nThe lady, née Xian, was a native of Gaodong and the wife of Feng Bao, the Tang-era Prefect of Gaozhou. When the Sui pacified the Chen dynasty in the south, the people of Lingnan unanimously acclaimed Lady Xian as their leader. She defended the region before eventually submitting to the Sui. Later, when Li Qianshi, the Prefect of Gaozhou, and Wang Zhongxuan, the Yi chieftain of Panyu, rebelled, Lady Xian suppressed them all. She was posthumously enfeoffed as the **Lady of Qiao State**, with the posthumous title *Sincere Reverence*. Her temple stands east of Dianbai County’s seat, and branch temples exist in neighboring counties, all renowned for their divine efficacy. The Song poet Su Shi wrote:\n\n> *Feng and Xian, ancient heroines,*\n> *Ruled this land as their domain.*\n> *Their merits recorded under Liang Wu,*\n> *Their offices granted by Sui Wen.*\n> *Through three generations of peril and peace,*\n> *Their hearts remained unstained.*\n> *With silken reins, they quelled chaos,*\n> *With rhinoceros shields, they dispelled doubt.*\n\nIn the early Hongwu era of the present dynasty, she was enfeoffed as the **Lady of Gaodong Prefecture**, and sacrifices are offered to her in the second winter month.\n\n**Yao Niang**\nYao Niang, whose given name was Zhenshu, was a commoner’s daughter from Heping County during the Han. Her temple stands in Sumo Village, Boluo County, where she became a deity after her death. During the Song, when Chen Yaozuo served as acting prefect of Huizhou, he traveled with the local scholar Xu Shen. Their boat moored by the shore when suddenly a hundred armored figures appeared, issuing stern commands: “Tonight, the Prime Minister and the Transport Commissioner will lodge here.” Yaozuo found this strange, for even the slightest negligence would be unacceptable. The next day, he inquired about the place and discovered Yao Niang’s temple there. Later, Yaozuo became Prime Minister, and Xu Shen was appointed Transport Commissioner of the region—just as foretold. To the west of Boluo, during the Liang, a girl of the Chen clan lost her father, Yingzhi, at eighty. She was his only child, and her grief was so profound that she too perished. The villagers sculpted her likeness and built a temple in her honor. During the Han, she was enfeoffed as the **Lady of Prosperous Blessings**, and her spirit proved highly efficacious in prayers for rain.\n\n**Cao E**\nCao E, a native of Shangyu, was the daughter of Cao Xu, a musician and shaman. During the Han An era, on the fifth day of the fifth month, her father drowned while welcoming the deity in the tidal waters of the county river, and his body was never recovered. Fourteen-year-old Cao E wept along the riverbank day and night without cease. After seventeen days, she threw herself into the river and drowned. During the Yuanjia era, a temple was built for her east of Shaoxing Prefecture’s city walls. Guo Ziyou of the commandery composed the stele inscription, and Cai Yong inscribed the words: *Yellow silk, young woman, grandson’s mortar*—referring to this very temple. Her divine efficacy became widely renowned, and the people never ceased their worship. Another girl from the same county, Zhu E, was raised by her grandmother. When a villager attempted to kill the grandmother, ten-year-old Zhu E rushed forward to shield her and was stabbed over a dozen times before dying. Her likeness was later enshrined alongside Cao E’s.\n\n**The Two Filial Daughters**\nThe filial daughters were natives of the Tang era, daughters of Ge You of Jinxī. The county had a silver mine managed by a supervisor who pressed Ge You for repayment when the silver ran out. Unable to bear their father’s torment, the two daughters threw themselves into the smelting furnace and died. Their father was released, and the mine was closed. Later, a young scholar studying at Cuiyun Temple in the county was awakened at the third watch by the bright, cloud-dappled moonlight. He heard the sound of flutes and pipes approaching from the northwest. Opening the door, he saw auspicious clouds and mist swirling, with an entourage of banners and canopies like those of an imperial consort. Two immortal maidens sat serenely within. The scholar quickly retreated, but the daughters called out: “Do not fear. We are the Ge sisters. The Heavenly Emperor, praising our filial piety, has appointed us as officials of the Jade Purity Palace’s *Zhengyi* rank. We are now journeying to the Ten Continents to pay homage to the Queen Mother. Convey our regards to our family.” The scholar found this extraordinary, and the villagers built a temple in their honor, which became renowned for its divine efficacy.\n\n**The Five Pestilence Envoys**\nBorn on the third day of the ninth month, during the Sui, Emperor Wen saw five mighty warriors standing in midair, each over ten *zhang* tall, clad in robes of the five directions. One held a ladle and gourd, another a leather bag and sword, a third a fan, a fourth a hammer, and the last a fire pot. The emperor asked the court astronomer Zhang Juren: “What gods are these? What fortunes or misfortunes do they portend?” Zhang Juren replied: “These are the Five Mighty Warriors of the directions, celestial demons known as the **Five Pestilence Envoys**. Their appearance foretells plague among the people.” The emperor asked: “Can it be averted?” Juren answered: “There is no remedy.” Soon, many in the empire fell ill and died. The emperor then established a shrine and issued an edict: the warrior in the blue robe was enfeoffed as the **General of Manifest Sagacity**, the red-robed warrior as the **General of Manifest Response**, the white-robed warrior as the **General of Inspired Response**, the black-robed warrior as the **General of Inspired Completion**, and the yellow-robed warrior as the **General of Inspired Might**. Both the Sui and Tang dynasties offered sacrifices to them on the fifth day of the fifth month.",

      "translated_text": "The **Five Bandit-Generals**\n\nThe Five Bandit-Generals were the five bandits who rebelled during the Yongguang era of Emperor Fei of the Song. They originally caused chaos and plundered in their native region. In the third year of Jinghe, the emperor dispatched the general Zhang Hong to crush and kill them north of Xinfeng County. Later, the five men returned as specters to haunt the land where they had died. Those who offered sacrifices to them called them the Five Bandit-Generals—what are now known as the **Bandit Deities**. Their names were: first, Du Ping; second, Li Si; third, Ren An; fourth, Sun Li; and fifth, Geng Yanzheng.\n\n---\n\n**The Exactor-Collector Envoy**\n\nThe Exactor-Collector Envoy was surnamed Pei, named Pu, and was the maternal cousin of Wei Yuanfang of Duling. Pu served as the magistrate of Xinping County in Hezhou. In the fifth year of Yuanhe, he died in office. In the early years of Changqing, Yuanfang failed the imperial examination and traveled as a guest in Longyou. After journeying several dozen *li* beyond the Kaiyuan Gate, he arrived at a roadside inn to rest. He saw a military officer on horseback approaching, followed by dozens of riders, whose appearance resembled Pu. Upon seeing Yuanfang, the officer seemed to recognize him and hastily dismounted to avoid him. He entered the tea house and concealed himself behind a curtain in a small room, while his attendants sat scattered outside the curtain. Yuanfang grew suspicious and also entered the inn. When he lifted the curtain to enter, he saw that it was indeed Pei Pu.\n\nYuanfang, surprised and delighted, bowed and said: “Brother, you have departed the human realm—why have you taken up a military post here? Is the underworld’s bureaucracy so strict?” Pu replied: “I serve as an official of the netherworld, overseeing military affairs, hence the martial attire.” Yuanfang asked: “What is your position?” Pu answered: “I am the Exactor-Collector Envoy of Longyou and Xichuan.” Yuanfang asked: “What do you oversee?” Pu said: “My duty is to seize surplus wealth from people.”\n\nYuanfang asked: “What is surplus wealth?” Pu explained: “When people trade goods or beg for alms, their fate decrees what they should receive. If they suddenly encounter rare goods or the owner deeply values what they obtain, the amount may exceed the destined sum. This excess is called surplus wealth, and thus I seize it.” Yuanfang asked: “How do you know it is surplus and seize it?” Pu said: “Every sip and bite of a person’s life is predestined—how could wealth and treasure be otherwise? The netherworld’s records limit what one may acquire. If one gains more than the destined amount, the underworld’s officials sweep in and seize the excess.”\n\nYuanfang asked: “What do you mean by ‘seize’? Do you snatch it from their purses or steal it from their bosoms?” Pu replied: “No. When the destined sum is reached, any additional wealth is manipulated by me. I may cause it to vanish, impose unexpected misfortunes, or disrupt their business so it falls short of the usual profit. It has nothing to do with them personally. In my past life, I once thought that diligent merchants gained wealth, diligent farmers gained grain, and diligent scholars gained official salaries. I lamented only that the indolent failed to obtain these. Yet now I see that shipwrecked merchants, drought-stricken farmers, and impoverished scholars—were they not diligent? Now I understand that diligence is the foundation of virtue, and learning is the root of goodness. Virtue and goodness are the true principles of self-cultivation—they are not means to seek wealth or official rank.\n\nOur meeting today was also predestined. You were meant to receive two *jin* of silver, but if I were to give it to you, it would be seized again. Thus, I dare not enrich you too much on this journey.” He then presented a generous gift but divided it sparingly at Jing, leaving Yuanfang with little. “Human life is governed by fate, and timing does not err. Observe all things with equanimity and remain untroubled. Strive onward.” Pu then had official business to attend to in the city. The netherworld’s affairs were dark and secretive, leaving no time for further conversation. He departed slowly.\n\n---\n\n**The Duke of Augmented Blessings**\n\nThe Duke of Augmented Blessings, surnamed Li and named Gui Zu, managed the affairs of the prime minister’s office during the reign of Emperor Wen of Wei. By day, he adjudicated disputes and grievances in the mortal realm; by night, he judged cases of right and wrong in the underworld. He also oversaw the clothing, food, and salaries of officials of the third rank and above, as well as the annual allotment of provisions for the living. In the first year of Tiancheng during the Later Tang dynasty, Emperor Mingzong posthumously bestowed upon him the title **Duke of Augmented Blessings**. He is born on the seventeenth day of the ninth month.\n\n---\n\n**The Gate of Blessings and Emoluments**\n\nThe Gate of Blessings and Emoluments refers to the prefect of Daozhou, Yang Cheng, whose courtesy name was Xi. Emperor Wu of Han favored the dwarfs of Daozhou, using them as palace slaves for amusement. Every year, hundreds of boys were selected from the region, forcing parents to part with their children. When Prefect Yang governed the commandery, he submitted a memorial to the emperor, stating: “According to the local records, our land has only dwarfs, not dwarf slaves.” Emperor Wu was moved and ceased the selections. The people of the commandery, grateful, built a shrine and enshrined his image, venerating him as the **Fortune Deity** of their region.",

Both the Sui and Tang dynasties offered sacrifices to them on the fifth day of the fifth month.",

According to tradition, Emperor Taizong of Tang suffered from disturbances outside his bedchamber—bricks and tiles hurled about, ghosts and demons wailing—so that the Six Palaces and Three Courts knew no peace by night. Frightened, the emperor informed his ministers. Shubao memorialized: “I have slain men as easily as breaking dry reeds, piled corpses like ants in heaps—what fear have I of petty ghosts? I beg to stand guard with Jingde in full armor.” The emperor approved his request, and that night, no disturbances occurred. Pleased, Taizong remarked that the two had kept vigil without sleep, and ordered court painters to depict them in full regalia, hair bristling with fury as in life, and hang the portraits on either side of the palace gates. Thus, malevolent spirits were quelled. Later generations followed this custom, and they have since remained the Door Gods. As a *Xiyou Ji* verse has it:\n*“Once heroes and stalwart ministers of old,\nA thousand years they’ve been called ‘Household Guards,’\nTen thousand ages they’ve served as Door Gods.”*\n\n**Shentu and Yulü**\nOn Mount Dushuo in the Eastern Sea stands a great peach tree, its gnarled branches spanning three thousand *li*.

      "translated_text": "There are two spirits: one named **Shentu**, the other **Yulü**, who oversee and govern the comings and goings of all ghosts, seizing them to feed to tigers. The Yellow Emperor emulated this and established the custom of placing peachwood boards. As its origins trace back to the Yellow Emperor, later generations carved spirit images upon the branches and inscribed beneath them: \"Shentu on the left, Yulü on the right,\" setting them at doorways on New Year’s Day.\n\n**Zhong Kui**\nDuring the Kaiyuan era of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, while reviewing troops at Mount Li, the emperor fell ill upon returning to the palace. In broad daylight, he dreamed of a small ghost in crimson robes and calf-nose trousers, one foot shod and the other bare, who stole a large embroidered incense pouch and the emperor’s jade flute, darting playfully around the hall. The emperor shouted in rebuke, and the small ghost replied, “Your servant is *Xuhao* (Vain Depletion).” The emperor asked, “What is *Xuhao*?” The ghost answered, “I steal from people in empty air and deplete their households’ joyous affairs.” Enraged, the emperor called for his guards, when suddenly a great ghost—wearing a tattered hat, blue robe, angular belt, and court boots—first gouged out the small ghost’s eyes, then tore and devoured it. The emperor asked who he was, and the ghost replied, “Your servant is Zhong Kui, a scholar from Mount Zhongnan. Having failed the imperial examination, I returned home in shame, struck my head against the palace steps, and died. By imperial decree, I was buried in a green robe, and in gratitude for the sacrifices offered, I rid the world of *Xuhao* and malevolent spirits for Your Majesty.” With these words, the dream ended, and the emperor’s illness vanished. He then ordered Wu Daozi to paint Zhong Kui’s likeness.\n\n**The Controller of Fate**\nBorn on the third day of the eighth month, this deity is surnamed Zhang, named Shan, styled Ziguo, and appears as a beautiful woman. His wife is styled Qingji, and they have six daughters, all named Cha—collectively the Six Gui Women. They record human transgressions: major offenses cost two to three hundred days of one’s lifespan, minor ones one to two hundred days, thus serving as the overseers of Heaven and Earth. When performing rituals for this deity, place the altar at the center of the room, facing west. Arrange four sides of the altar nine inches from the cauldron, constructing it with broad planks and fine soil, ensuring no cracks or breaks. The altar spirit died on the *renzi* day; do not perform rituals on this day. On the *chen* day of the fifth month, sacrifice a pig’s head to the altar to bring ten-thousandfold prosperity. Chicken feathers entering the altar invite misfortune; dog bones entering it produce mad offspring. On the *jisi* day of the first month, sacrifice a white chicken to the altar for timely blessings. On the *jichou* day of the fifth month, sacrifice to the altar for good fortune. On the *dingsi* day of the fourth month, sacrifice to the altar for good fortune. The deity wears yellow robes and unbound hair, emerging from the altar. Knowing his name and invoking it can dispel misfortune.\n\n**The Toilet God**\nThe Toilet God was a girl from Laiyang County surnamed He, named Xu, styled Liqing, who read widely and spoke eloquently from childhood. In the third year of the Chuigong era of Tang, Li Jing, the prefect of Shouyang, took her as a concubine. His wife, consumed by jealousy, secretly killed her and hid her body in the toilet. Her spirit lingered, and those using the toilet often heard weeping. At times, she appeared faintly, brandishing weapons and shouting. From then on, she displayed extraordinary spiritual power. People prayed to her corpse, and she descended upon a suspended winnowing basket, foretelling fortune and misfortune. As she died on the fifteenth day of the first month, her manifestations are most potent during that month.\n\n**The Road-Opening Spirit**\nThis deity is the *Fangxiangshi* of the *Rites of Zhou*. Legend holds that when the Yellow Emperor traversed the Nine Heavens, his primary consort, Leizu, died on the road. He ordered his secondary consort, Haoru, to oversee her, hiring an assistant to guard against nighttime disturbances—thus its origin. Commonly called the Perilous Path Spirit, it is also known as the Field-and-Path General or the Road-Opening Spirit.\n\n**Lüling (Law-Command)**\nThe swift runners of the Thunder Department, as fast as thunder itself, are invoked in talismanic incantations with the phrase: “Swiftly, swiftly, as law commands.”\n\n**The Two Guardian Spirits**\nEmperor Ming of Wei cast two bronze figures called *Xi Zhong* and placed them outside the Gate of the Minister of War. According to ancient records, the appearance of a tall person foretold the nation’s fall. When a giant was seen at Lintao, it heralded Qin’s downfall. The First Emperor, however, deemed it auspicious and cast bronze statues in its likeness.\n\nOn an auspicious day of the Lantern Festival in the *dingwei* year of the Wanli era (1607), Zhang Guoxiang, the Orthodox Successor of the Zhengyi Tradition, Supreme Perfected of Profound Dao, Grand Master of the Propagation of Teachings, and Overseer of Daoist Affairs Under Heaven, by imperial decree oversaw the printing.\n\n*Soushen Ji*, Scroll Six (concluded)",
