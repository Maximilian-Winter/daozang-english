  "full_translation": "**Preface to *Chanting the Dao: True Teachings***\n\nIn the Southern Polar Heavenly Palace, the August Sovereign of Azure Radiance, boundless in compassion and vow, most sagely and benevolent, descends with qi and sheds light, expounding scriptures and unfolding teachings across kalpas immeasurable, delivering countless beings—O Most Honored Heavenly Worthy, Supreme Dao Ancestor, Divine Master.\n\nI have observed that those who study the Dao in this world often err in transmission and practice. They speak of lead and mercury, deluding all sentient beings, clinging to deluded hopes in pursuit of immortality. Yet upon examination, what they transmit amounts to no more than a few pointers on techniques, boasting as though they grasp the black pearl, extorting wealth and demanding reverence, playing the part of a master. Each time I witness this, I cannot help but sigh at the transgression!\n\nTruly, no cultivator can transcend the bounds of yin-yang and the five phases, abiding alone with the Great Void, without first illuminating the ground of the mind. Thus, when true immortals deliver beings, they invariably teach one to refine the work within the mind’s terrain, tempering the square inch of the heart until it becomes like a crystal pearl, like a lapis lazuli treasure vase. From this, boundless wondrous meanings arise from the mind’s own source, thought after thought perfectly penetrating, heart after heart luminously clear. Then, the untransmitted secrets of the immortals since ancient times become utterly apparent.\n\nIf one applies the principles realized from the mind’s source to the earnest work of one’s own nature and life, at that moment, words will naturally arise beyond their surface, wondrously aligning with the mark. Demonic obstructions will not intrude, and one will forever be free from thorny entanglements. Thus, the Dao of elixir refinement is originally a living, fluid path. Yet the so-called masters of this world, with their stale words on paper and petty techniques, seek to make all conform to the same mold—how is this different from using a cotton pellet to shoot a pellet, or tuning a zither with glue? To expect success in such a way is indeed difficult!\n\nIn the *jiyou* year, on the *jiachen* day of the third lunar month in spring, the Dharma-heir Crane-Emaciate Child, having awakened, received and transcribed the Great Method of Wenchang’s brush.\n\nThis old man and Crane-Emaciate Child share a karmic bond from past lives. From the day I descended to the altar, nearly three years have passed. What I have transmitted to Crane-Emaciate Child amounts to nothing more than the two words: *refining the mind*. Ten thousand words, a thousand discourses—all serve only to elucidate these two words as the universal path of the thousand sages, the essential road of the ten thousand perfected. In the Great Luo Heaven above, on Jade Capital Mountain, among the countless lofty immortals, none have ever abandoned these two words to roam freely within the Dharma-realm of true light as disciples of the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning. Upon careful verification, none have ever done so.\n\nI recall when I first descended to the altar and imparted these two words to Crane-Emaciate Child, he did not believe them, assuming that elixir refinement must involve secret transmissions. He thought, *\"Refining the mind—anyone can speak of it, anyone can attempt it.\"* Thus, most of his questions and requests for further instruction revolved around theories of life cultivation. No matter what he asked, I simply expounded on the two words *refining the mind* with utmost sincerity. Only after a year, when Crane-Emaciate Child’s practice had advanced and he had gained true attainment, did he trust that I, his master, was no mere purveyor of empty words.\n\nWhen immortals deliver sentient beings, they first enable one to perceive the indestructible nature of life, and only then do they cultivate the indestructible life itself. This is what is meant by the dual cultivation of nature and life.\n\nAlas! Since I began discoursing with Crane-Emaciate Child, three seasons of cold and heat have passed. The waters of Penglai grow shallow, and the peach blossoms of Pan again bloom! Whether composing verses in Plum Pavilion or discoursing on the mysterious in Plantain Lodge, whenever insights arose, Crane-Emaciate Child would withdraw to record them in his book, totaling over fifty thousand words. He wishes to make them public for the world, to serve as a model for later generations, and has asked me for a preface.\n\nI reflect that the essentials of cultivation are already thoroughly documented. Yet I fear that people may regard the two words *refining the mind* as too simple, unwilling to place their faith in them. Thus, I reiterate and clarify these two words once more. This old man, since time without beginning, has vowed before the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning to deliver countless beings. I dare not deceive the world and future generations with falsehoods.\n\nCrane-Emaciate Child, hesitating, approached with the scripture and said: *\"The preface is excellent, but this scripture, which expounds the mysterious transformation and will be transmitted for ten thousand generations, cannot remain unnamed.\"*\n\nI replied: *\"The two words *refining the mind* are the true and essential teaching of the Most High in delivering beings and chanting the great Dao. What if we title it *Chanting the Dao: True Teachings*?\"*\n\nCrane-Emaciate Child descended the steps, bowed deeply, and said: *\"Excellent!\"*\n\n—Inscribed by the Old Man of Azure Radiance\n\nAn Inscription\n\nAt the Southern Culmen Heavenly Palace, the Azure Radiance Most High—boundless in compassion, vast in vows, utmost in sageliness, perfect in benevolence—embodies harmony, preserves truth, extends transformative grace, oversees the myriad realms, traverses the nine provinces, averts disasters and dissolves kalpas, delivers countless beings: the Heavenly Worthy, the Supreme Dao Ancestor, the Divine Teacher.\n\nThis scripture is composed first to expound the refinement of the mind, then the refinement of life. Those who cultivate accordingly may illumine the ground of the mind, fortify the root of life, dispel the six thieves without effort, and extinguish the three corpses without striving. On the day the Dao is attained, one ascends to the Upper Clarity; myriad generations of ancestors all ascend to heaven, and descendants for all time become immortals. Truly, this is the greatest of Dharma gates, the essential path of the ten thousand Perfected!\n\nShould any unworthy disciple, ignorant of Heaven’s mandate, treat the sacred words with contempt, fail to treasure and guard this scripture, read it without avoiding women, or store it outside a purified chamber, the Dharma-protecting deities shall record their transgressions and report them to the Star Lords of the Northern and Southern Dippers. Misfortune shall be meted out: death followed by infernal torment. Only when one person attains the Dao will the Dipper Palace issue a pardon, allowing escape from the netherworld and rebirth. Alas! Be vigilant, lest you plunge yourself into irreverence!\n\nThough this scripture is attributed to Crane-Emaciate Child alone, it may truly be shared with all. May those among the world’s scholars who encounter it by karmic affinity refine their nature to become sages and temper their life to become immortals. I offer them the ladder to transcendence, fulfilling my vow to deliver beings—how joyous this is!\n\nYet to withhold transmission from one who is worthy, or to recklessly transmit to one who is not, incurs heavenly punishment. In the exchange of teaching, one must reflect thrice. The transmission of scripture and initiation of instruction must await the proper time. Only when the time is right and the recipient is worthy may the secrets of the jade casket be revealed and the profound mysteries disclosed. The Dao has its regulations and prohibitions—one must be prudent.\n\nOne must seek those of upright heart and disciplined conduct, whose ancestors bear no heavenly wrath nor abandoned ruler or kin, nor practiced unbenevolent arts, before entrusting them with this scripture. Even then, charge them earnestly to refrain from indiscriminate dissemination. If the recipient is indeed a person of great virtue, one need not reject them solely on account of their lineage.\n\nThose who readily embrace the Dharma are many, but superior practitioners are rare—such individuals are the true upper-grade disciples. Should someone who once pursued unwholesome ways, upon reaching middle age, suddenly repent and turn toward the Dao with sincere devotion, permit them to purify and renew themselves. Do not summarily reject them, so as to embody the Most High’s compassionate vow to deliver all beings.\n\nAlas! My words are finite, but my vow is boundless. Between heaven’s embrace and earth’s support, who cannot study the Dao? Who cannot cultivate the Dao? Every person possesses an innate nature, each endowed with wondrous function. Ascending as immortals, entering as sages—what difficulty remains? Yet due to karmic habits from past lives obscuring one’s original nature, and illusory phenomena of the present moment clouding true awakening, one mistakes thieves for kin and pursues delusion while forsaking reality. Thus, they cycle through the three evil destinies and eight adversities, departing only to return; traverse the six paths and four modes of birth, revolving without end.\n\nLet the Heavenly Gate be a realm of boundless expanse, and regard hell as a familiar haunt. Alas! How can this not be lamentable? My vow is that all beings under heaven and earth who receive this scripture shall each arouse a heart of courageous vigor and diligent progress, ascending together to the fruit of lotus transformation. The shore of the Dao is not distant—seek virtue and you shall attain it; the phoenix chariot and unicorn carriage may be expected any day. Such is the true man—I await him daily!\n\nThose who cultivate the Dao and receive this scripture must first uphold fasting and observe precepts, establish an altar in a purified chamber, and kindle the twelve kinds of incense of faith. They shall pay homage and recite the sacred titles of Mālīḥapati-Tārā-Dòumǔ Heavenly Venerable, the Seven Perfected of the Northern Dipper, Wénchāng of the Southern Dipper, the Celestial Officers who govern all, the innumerable lofty perfected of the Dipper Palace, and all the mighty numina of grotto-heavens and blessed lands, as well as the successive generations of perfected masters who transmitted the scriptures and inaugurated the teachings. Only after forty-nine days of such practice may one be permitted to open the scripture and peruse it. One must not be naked or near anything filthy or impure!\n\nWherever this scripture resides, perfected immortals descend to observe, and divine radiance with auspicious qi fills the chamber, opening the mind’s ground and stirring the spirit. Should one show the slightest disrespect, the immortals will not come, and one risks external demons and evil spirits seizing the opportunity to harass—this must not be overlooked!\n\nIn daily life, one should be circumspect in conduct and moderate in desire, widely performing good deeds. On the days when the Dipper descends, one should close the gates and practice stillness, concentrating the mind to ascend in audience to the Purple Palace. Thereafter, the Northern Dipper will erase the names of death and inscribe one in the register of life, bringing peace to both body and household while averting calamities. Whatever one contemplates shall be instantly understood. In this way, one will not be far from the Dao.\n\nThe adept who, in reverence for this sutra, remains unwavering and receives it with utmost sincerity—such a one shall I cherish and protect as tenderly as a newborn child. I shall ever bathe their crown in divine radiance, that their wisdom may grow day by day, and no doubt shall cloud their understanding of this scripture. Should they serve at court, they will withdraw from the rapids of power at the height of their influence; should they dwell at home, their descendants will be virtuous and filial, and no external humiliation shall assail them. Should they abide in mountain caves, serpents, insects, tigers, wolves, mountain sprites, and tree demons—all manner of malevolent beasts—will flee far from their presence, refusing to intrude. Should they cross rivers, the dragon deities will bow their heads, and the waves shall remain unruffled. Should they wander through markets to beg for alms, men and women, old and young, upon seeing them, will be filled with awe and joy, bestowing offerings without weariness. No peril of water, fire, blade, or warfare shall harm them. In their cultivation, no external demons or evil spirits shall seize the chance to disturb them. I shall watch over such a one from beginning to end, guarding them at every moment, until the day their Dao is perfected. Then, their spiritual powers shall be vast, and my vow shall be fulfilled!\n\nAs the Buddhist scriptures say: *\"The Tathāgata does not speak falsely.\"* How could I alone be otherwise?\n\nScroll One\n\nAt the Southern Culmen’s Celestial Palace resides the Azure Radiance Supreme Emperor—savior of Fusang, wielder of the Great Unity’s celestial mandate. His qi governs the nine heavens, his authority unites the five peaks. Manifesting in myriad transformations, he reveals the esoteric truths of the sacred immortals. Boundless in compassion, boundless in vows, most sagely, most benevolent, his auspicious responses deliver countless beings. The Most High Heavenly Worthy, the Supreme Dao Ancestor and Immortal Master, bestows the register.\n\nToday, having recited the *Scripture of Purity and Stillness*, you must practice the method of purity and stillness. What is purity and stillness? It is the purification and stilling of the heart. The root of human affliction lies largely in the manifold delusions. Once delusions are eradicated, how many stray thoughts yet stir within the breast? The way to dispel stray thoughts lies solely in inward contemplation. At first, there is something; then, there is nothing. At the extremity of nothingness, there is no self. The water settles without ripples, the bright moon casts no shadow. If you deem this not emptiness, the subtlest hairs are perfectly transparent, and only luminosity is seen. If you deem this fundamental emptiness, in profound obscurity, all phenomena are complete. At this juncture, you cannot cling to steps or thoughts—lucid and resplendent, mysterious and serene. The way of elixir formation is fully contained herein.\n\nMeritorious deeds are the ford to ascension and Dao attainment, yet the accumulation of merit and conduct must begin with filial piety. Almsgiving is not within the means of the impoverished, but in speech, guiding others toward goodness and restraining them from evil—this costs only the labor of the tongue, yet grants others boundless blessings, constituting immense hidden merit. Reciting the *Great Cavern Scripture* and chanting the Dipper Mother’s mantra can deliver ancestors and amplify dark blessings—this is filial devotion. Avoid reading useless books or engaging in frivolous amusements. When matters arise, address them with a sincere and kind heart, benefiting the people and all things. In leisure, purify the heart and sit in stillness, reciting scriptures or silently paying homage, with every thought directed toward the Supreme Perfected. The Supreme Perfected, most compassionate and merciful, regards those who cultivate the Dao as a loving mother cherishes her infant, never for a moment setting her heart at ease. How could an infant longing for its mother be met with indifference?\n\nAlas! Human life in this world passes in the blink of an eye. The sages treasured every inch of time; we ought to treasure every minute. This is a truth most earnest. Those with aspirations must establish true resolve; those who study must engage in true learning. With perseverance over time, a single breakthrough of spiritual light reveals the immortal isles and celestial palaces before your eyes—a grand path, a radiant gateway—all within the square inch of the heart. This path is the way to ascension; this gate is the entrance to the Dao. If one takes the first step onto this great path, enters this gateway, and keeps the mind unwavering, the feet will swiftly advance. Becoming an immortal or a buddha is the easiest of matters.\n\nAs you read the *Scripture of Purity and Stillness*, ponder each phrase, comprehend each word, and unite your heart with that of the Supreme Perfected. When you have grasped the inner workings, the subtlety of wordless understanding, you have attained the true realm. Stray thoughts are not difficult to eliminate—cut them off as they arise, severing them with a single stroke. During meditation, do not cling to this heart. If, for the sake of stray thoughts, you bind yourself in great suffering, how can the nature-ground attain perfect freedom? How can the spiritual light break through? Instead, remain carefree and at ease, vast and unbounded, embodying the primordial vastness of the Great Void, unburdened by things.\n\nThus, the ancients contemplated the state before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure arise, and in guarding the mean, one must not cling to it, for this is the reason. Stray thoughts, though unavoidable, are like floating clouds that cannot burden the sky. With prolonged refinement, their roots are severed, and the mind becomes empty and spiritually luminous. Earlier, I likened stray thoughts to floating clouds—this is a precise analogy.\n\nAs for daily interactions, unless one is a hermit cultivating stillness in the mountains, how can these be avoided? I have a method to impart to you. Whatever brings joy, anger, sorrow, or delight, respond to it in the moment, then let it pass without lingering. Like wind, thunder, lightning, and fog—phenomena the heavens cannot do without, yet they are not the heavens themselves—so too are joy, anger, sorrow, and delight, which the heart cannot do without, yet they are not the heart itself. The heavens have their true celestial body; the heart has its true essence. Through my responses, remain in tranquil emptiness, ever vigilant, vibrantly alive—this is the essential secret.\n\nRefining the elixir first requires refining the heart. The method of refining the heart lies in eliminating idle thoughts and delusions as the gateway to purity and stillness. This is the ancestral transmission of the immortals—there is no other way. When a single thought does not arise in the heart, emptiness and clarity naturally arise together. At this time, essence becomes true essence, qi becomes true qi, and spirit becomes true spirit. Using true essence, true qi, and true spirit, blend them into one, refining them into a millet-grain pearl, into the yang spirit—thus is the immortal Dao accomplished.\n\nUniting spirit with qi, stillness and nurturance are the work—this is what Mencius meant by \"preserving the heart and nurturing the nature.\" Uniting qi with spirit, discipline is essential—this is what Mencius meant by \"holding fast to the will and not harming the qi.\" Uniting essence with spirit, purity and emptiness are the foundation—this is what Mencius meant by \"nurturing the heart, nothing is better than reducing desires.\"\n\nThough essence, qi, and spirit are three when divided, they are one when united. Spirit and qi obey the commands of essence. If one preserves essence, spirit naturally flourishes, and qi naturally flows. Then, with the work of regulation and the way of return, there is no fear that the spiritual embryo will fail to form or the great elixir will not be achieved. This is the method for beginning practice—I write it here to instruct you. To refine the elixir without first refining the heart is like whipping a horse to run while hobbling its feet.\n\nRefining the heart constitutes half the work of attaining immortality. When the heart is clear, the spirit becomes pure; when the spirit is pure, qi congeals; when qi congeals, essence is secured. The alchemical classics speak of foundational cultivation, medicinal ingredients, furnace and cauldron, lead and mercury, dragon and tiger, sun and moon, Kan and Li—all these terms arise from the work of refining the heart. As for the methods of harmonization, the dynamics of interaction, the techniques of ascent and descent, and the arts of firing and refinement, these are but secondary matters. If the source of the heart remains turbid and entangled by passions and desires, then even if the foundation is firmly laid, it will eventually collapse; though the medicinal ingredients may be complete, they will inevitably be deficient. The furnace will crack, the cauldron will break, the dragon will wage war, the tiger will roar, the sun will be eclipsed, the moon will darken, Kan will be empty, and Li will be full. At such a time, if one attempts to discuss harmonization, yin and yang will fail to unite; if one seeks to understand interaction, water and fire will be at odds. What should ascend will instead descend, and what should descend will retreat upward. The Three Corpses will harm you, the Six Thieves will disturb you, and a cup of water will be powerless to extinguish the fire of a cartload of kindling. Thus it is said: refining the heart constitutes half the work of attaining immortality. This is a profound truth, an unassailable argument—a single phrase that pierces the celestial mechanism and shatters demonic obstacles. Refining the heart is the essential Dao of the immortals’ path from beginning to end. If the ground of the heart is overgrown with weeds, even if one obtains the Dao of the elixir, it will be but a side door; though one may become an immortal, one will not be recorded in the celestial registers, will not be able to consort with the Perfected of the Great Canopy, nor enter the gateway of the Great Vehicle. Therefore, if one wishes to form the sacred embryo, one must first ascend to perfect enlightenment—this is the crucial teaching.\n\nThe work of regulation lies entirely in ascent and descent. The method of ascent and descent lies entirely in tranquil observation. Tranquility is not absolute stillness, for within tranquility there is movement. Yet this movement is not true movement—it is the turning of creation’s wheel. Observation is not clinging to observation, for within observation there is awareness. Yet this awareness is not true awareness—it is the flickering of numinous light. When tranquility gives rise to observation, and observation enables tranquility, this is what is called tranquil observation. At this time, the cauldron is empty while the medicine is full, water is firm while fire is gentle. With each firing and each refinement, each exhalation and each inhalation, one moves in harmony with the mysterious transformations of heaven and earth, the revolutions of the sun and moon, the clarity and turbidity of yin and yang, and the cyclical succession of the four seasons. Entering the realm of non-being from being is called the millet pearl; entering the realm of being from non-being is called the yang spirit. When the work reaches this point, it is the moment when both form and spirit are transformed.\n\nIf one has not refined the heart, one remains mired in the filth of the seven emotions and six desires, and to seek the arts of longevity or fathom the wonders of the golden elixir is like a warrior wielding shield and spear while strumming the strings of a zither, or a weak horse burdened with bridle and reins attempting to gallop up a winding mountain path—how can one hope for the five notes to be harmonious or the six reins to be at ease? The preceding chapter stated that refining the heart constitutes half the work of attaining immortality—this is the teaching to which all streams return, the truth affirmed by successive patriarchs from heart to heart. If you were not devoted to the Dao, I would never transmit this.\n\nYet the refinement of the heart takes different forms: there is the refinement of the heart of perception and experience, and the refinement of the heart beyond perception and experience. What is the heart of perception and experience? When affairs arise and things come forth, one responds to stimuli without fail, finding oneself at ease in every situation, drawing from inexhaustible sources—this is what the sages and worthies of the Confucian school have already expounded. It is like a bright mirror or a precious pearl reflecting objects: the radiance of the mirror and the luster of the pearl remain serene and luminous, undisturbed by what they reflect, unclouded by the multitude of reflections. What is the heart beyond perception and experience? In utter stillness, one turns the light inward; in perfect clarity, one gazes within. There is no perception of others, no perception of self, no perception of being, no perception of non-being, no perception of non-being’s non-being, no perception of the absence of non-being’s non-being. There is the light of a mirror, yet in truth no mirror; there is the luster of a pearl, yet in truth no pearl. At this time, even the Greatly Awakened Tathāgata would yield his seat to you, and all the realms of form and sound would be contained within the radiant clarity of your hair’s tip.\n\nYet the heart of perception and experience must be refined in activity. Amidst the scorching flames of a fiery pit, beneath a sky ablaze, one’s heart remains cool and at ease, like a single drop of dew from a willow branch—this is the refinement of activity. The heart beyond perception and experience must be refined in stillness. In a single instant, myriad kalpas pass like bubbles and lightning, arising and vanishing in succession, yet one remains unmoved, the nature of wisdom ever empty—this is the refinement of stillness. Though the heart of perception and experience and the heart beyond perception and experience are ultimately one, the refinement of activity and the refinement of stillness are both the refinement of the heart—what division is there to speak of?\n\nZhang Ziyang’s alchemical writings reveal what earlier masters had not disclosed, serving as a true guide for Daoist adepts. Yet his discussions of the firing times and the gathering of ingredients often employ veiled language, for he regarded the numinous elixir as a secret of heaven and earth, intending that students should quietly contemplate and grasp it for themselves. Zhang’s intentions were truly earnest! But I take a different approach: I strive to wash away all residual dust, revealing a single great path so that students may set forth in the morning and arrive by evening. Those with wisdom will have no difficulty penetrating the profound and attaining the rank of the Perfected of the Great Canopy.\n\nYet this is no easy task! Even the two words \"refining the heart,\" which encompass the entirety of the immortal’s path, require one to sit until the meditation cushion is worn through and kneel until the knees are ground away—how else could one cease all discursive thought, attain complete non-attachment, perceive one’s original face, and realize the supreme root-source? Thus, refining the heart is the iron wall and bronze barrier of the immortal’s path. Only when this barrier is breached and this wall is shattered does one attain the state of perfect roundness and untrammeled freedom, the single grain of millet pearl, the three-inch yang spirit, dwelling at ease in the mysterious palace and pervading the Dharma-realm. Though there may still be the work of firing and refinement, the timing of nurturing the fire—these are like building a seven-story pagoda with only the topmost tier remaining, a matter of but a single moment.\n\nYou possess a profound devotion to the Dao and the courage to forge yourself—you are truly a hero of our age. What fear is there that the Dao will not be illuminated or the elixir will not be achieved? Yet the work of tranquil observation is not possible unless the heart is like dead ashes and the body like withered wood—only then can one cast everything aside and leap from the precipice.\n\nThough your worldly attachments are light, your family ties remain unsevered—how then can you suddenly renew this spirit and accomplish this great work? Alas, youth slips away swiftly, and white hairs hasten upon you. Take heed and rouse yourself to vigilance!\n\nYou ask: Though I sense the world’s bonds are faint, my household affairs press thick upon me—children cluster at my knees, and the cares of clothing and food weigh upon my heart. For years I have toiled with my tongue to feed my family, and though I hold the aspiration to cultivate the Dao, I cannot secure a tranquil abode. Thus I am ensnared in mundane entanglements, sunk in the web of karma, and fear that in a single moment of impermanence, I may forever plunge into the sea of suffering. Out of compassion, Master, how would you instruct me?\n\nThe Master replied: The method of refining the elixir, though expounded in a thousand words and ten thousand phrases, distills entirely into the two characters: *refining the heart*. And the method of refining the heart does not require one to leave the world. Did all the immortals of old retreat into the forests, abandoning human affairs, before they mounted the simurgh or rode the crane to roam the Purple Courts? In sum, the Way is present in daily eating and drinking; the Way is present in serving those above and nurturing those below; the Way is present even on the battlefield amidst warhorses. The ancients spoke of *\"refining spirit in activity, refining life in stillness\"*—how profound their words!\n\nAs for the practice of tranquil cultivation, the first chapter of the *Doctrine of the Mean* already states: *\"Be reverent and cautious when unseen, fearful and apprehensive when unheard.\"* When one neither sees nor hears, yet remains reverent and apprehensive, attaining the center so that heaven and earth take their proper places, and achieving harmony so that the myriad things are nurtured—this is the supreme vehicle of the Tathāgata. Riding the lion or sitting upon the elephant is but this heart and this principle—how does it differ from that of ordinary people?\n\nYou fret over worldly burdens and secular entanglements, seeking to abandon the present in pursuit of some transcendent state. Yet the noble person acts according to their station—surely they would not do this. King Wen, imprisoned in Youli, expounded the *Book of Changes*; Confucius, besieged between Chen and Cai, still plucked his zither and sang. Even the sages, when confronted with trials and unbearable hardships, could fully realize their nature and fulfill their destiny—how much more so for you, whose present circumstances have not reached such extremes!\n\nThe only thing you need fear is a lack of resolve, not an excess of burdens. Where there is true resolve, there is true learning. Whether in the celestial grotto-heavens or the stables of sheep and horses, the cultivator of the Dao must regard all with equanimity. Ultimately, the lotus throne of the great bodhisattva and the iron bed of the sinful ghost in the flames are fundamentally the same realm. Why? Because the bodhisattva’s buddha-nature is the same as the sinful ghost’s buddha-nature. The noble person speaks of nature, not of circumstances.\n\nZhang Ziyang’s saying that *\"intention serves as the matchmaker\"* is but a few words, and far from comprehensive. I shall now complete it for you. Intention originates in the heart and is perfected in nature; thus, only with a true heart can there be a true nature, and only with a true nature can there be a true intention—this intention is called the *primordial unity of intention*. Now, in the primordial state, before forms and images have taken shape, without the slightest trace or sign, how could there be something called \"intention\"? Yet in the moment of silent sitting, when the mind is settled and the spirit luminously clear, free from dross and devoid of discursive thought—this is the primordial substance of nature. From this emptiness emerges a single point of true intention, like the circle of the Great Ultimate giving birth to yin and yang, or Fu Xi’s single stroke generating the Two Modes. Thus it is called the *primordial unity of intention*. Paired with water and fire, it draws forth lead and mercury, and in its use, nothing fails to respond. The completion of the elixir path is entirely governed by this single intention, which orchestrates and revolves all.\n\nThe alchemical use of intention is thus, yet Zhang’s account is overly terse—how could this suffice to instruct later learners and guide future generations?\n\nThe *mysterious pass* is a subtle aperture, elusive and hard to know. To deem it within is not within; to deem it without is not without. Even the first chapter of the *Doctrine of the Mean* has spoken of it: *\"Before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure arise, it is called the center; when they arise and all accord with measure, it is called harmony.\"* The state before arising is not the mysterious pass, nor is the state after arising. Only in the instant of *about to arise yet not yet arisen, or suddenly arising from the unarisen*—that is the mysterious pass. A breath too soon, it is not the pass; a breath too late, it is not the pass.\n\nThus, in a person, when still, the mysterious pass is present in the blink of an eye; when active, it vanishes in the blink of an eye. It is but a fleeting moment, a single instant. Speaking of it in its vastness, the mysterious pass exists before the workings of creation. Why? Because after creation, heaven and earth incline ever toward movement. What moves heaven and earth? The mysterious pass moves them. Yet once it moves, it is no longer the mysterious pass.\n\nSpeaking of it in its smallness, the flight of the kite, the leap of the fish, the transformation of insects, the chirping of the cicada—what enables their flight, their leaps, their transformations, their cries? The mysterious pass does. Yet when considering the human body, there is a difference. Why? The lifting of hands and feet, the seeing of the eyes and hearing of the ears, the smelling of the nose, the tasting of the mouth—these cannot be designated as the mysterious pass.\n\nThe mysterious pass is the moment when the myriad forms are utterly still, when not a single thought has yet formed, when suddenly there is a stirring, and all is pervaded; when suddenly there is awareness, and all is illuminated—*this* is the mysterious pass. To think upon the stirring or reflect upon the awareness is no longer the mysterious pass.\n\nThus, the mysterious pass in a person is like fire in stone or light in lightning—ungraspable, untouchable. Alas! Those who refine the elixir without knowing this single aperture of the mysterious pass are utterly lost. Today, people are ruled by the nature of their material endowment, and the mysterious pass remains closed and obstructed from the moment of birth. Only through stillness upon stillness, quiescence upon quiescence, mystery upon mystery, emptiness upon emptiness—only then can one attain this single aperture of the mysterious pass.\n\nThis aperture is the very source from which the true heart, true nature, true essence, true spirit, and true qi emerge—while the mysterious pass serves as its mechanism.\n\nMaster Shao said:\n*\"At the first stirring of yang,\nWhen the ten thousand things are yet unborn—\"*\nHere lies that single aperture of the mysterious pass, vanishing in an instant; one must seek it urgently.\n\nIn the previous discourse, I entrusted to you the secret of the mysterious pass—a precelestial truth never fully transmitted, which past patriarchs dared not speak of in full. This single aperture of the mysterious pass is what all sages and immortals have distilled into two words to teach their disciples at the moment of *illuminating the heart and seeing the nature*.\n\nHow does the heart become illuminated? In a sudden flash—this is the mysterious pass.\nHow does the nature become visible? In a sudden revelation—this is the mysterious pass.\n\nThe mysterious pass is the spiritual trigger for *illuminating the heart and seeing the nature*, the wondrous mechanism for *conceiving the embryo and refining the elixir*. Thus, the ancients presented these two words ex nihilo to instruct later generations, urging them to somersault upon the needle’s tip and inscribe a footnote in the flash of lightning. The immortal’s arts of *dividing the body and transforming qi*, of *emerging from water and entering fire*, of *ascending to heaven and descending to earth*, of *a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations*—all arise from grasping, stabilizing, somersaulting, and inscribing within this mysterious pass. Then, transformations follow the heart, the hidden and manifest are at one’s command, and nothing remains difficult. These few words are the workings of heaven—without a decade of devoted practice, they cannot be penetrated.\n\nYet clinging to a decade of effort is itself delusion. The Way may be swift as a moment or slow as a lifetime. You possess karmic wisdom; surely it will not be difficult for you.\n\nThe disciple responded: *\"By past-life causes, I have encountered a sagely teacher who points the Great Dao. Though I strive to follow, for years I have been driven like a horse in harness, my will fixed only on fodder, while the learning of life and nature remains utterly beyond my sight. The苦海 is fathomless, and I see no shore. At this thought, my heart’s fire blazes upward, and sweat pours from my body. Master, have compassion—how shall I be taught?\"*\n\nThe master replied: *\"Examine your practice today: whatever you can do, do it earnestly. Each fraction of progress is a fraction gained. Though it may not be the essential Way, it becomes the foundation for future attainment. Building a house requires first laying a firm foundation and erecting four sturdy pillars—only then can towering pavilions, painted beams, and carved rafters be raised in due course. To dream of lofty halls without a single shovelful of earth or a single bundle of firewood is like climbing a tree to seek fish.*\n\n*One must read the alchemical texts, yet not seek the elixir by following their diagrams. Practice stillness and cultivation—once you gain entry, wondrous threads will unfold of themselves, every point leading to the Way. You will find it impossible to stop. With your karmic roots, your name inscribed in the immortal register, how can you neglect deep cultivation of the Dao?*\n\n*I have always taught that one must begin with foundational work—through humble study, one naturally ascends. Yet there is no true distinction between high and low. Consider the two words 'refining the heart': the lowly path lies within, and the exalted path lies within as well. Dispelling delusive thoughts and idle musings is the lowly path. In an instant, directly transcending to perfect awakening—this is the exalted path. Such has been known since antiquity. If they are men, so am I—why should I fear?*\n\n*Yet before beginning practice—or even as you begin—do not entertain such thoughts, lest impatience disrupt you. 'First difficulty, then reward' is the essential principle of stillness cultivation.*\n\n*As for gathering the medicine and refining the elixir, having read the alchemical classics, you already grasp the general outline. When stillness cultivation reaches its subtlety, each step naturally generates the next, every point becomes the Way, and boundless wondrous realms flow from the primordial single intent. This is not mere empty knowing or vacuous awareness—there is true joy and true fulfillment. The One Origin is ever-present, and the ten thousand images return to spring. No words can describe it.*\n\n*To you, I have held nothing back. Our past-life karmic connection has brought us face to face in this life—I cannot be without you, nor can you be without me. If your Dao does not come to fruition, it is my sorrow as well. When you have a moment of leisure at midday, sit upright for a time and inwardly observe the substance of the heart. Your mind is filled with anger and resentment—if you can purify it, you will uproot a great karmic obstacle. Remove all disease roots one by one. Persist gently, and conditions will naturally converge; heaven will follow your wish. Once worldly burdens are cleared, body and mind become unobstructed, the foundation is naturally firm, and the Great Dao presents no difficulty.*\n\n*I teach you to begin with foundational work. Since ancient times, those who attained immortality and realized the Dao have largely followed this path—how could it be otherwise for you?*\n\n*Stillness nurtures the heart,\nClarity reveals the nature,\nWisdom observes the spirit,\nStability sustains the qi,\nRestraint of desire generates essence,\nUtter emptiness establishes intent—\nThese are the essential principles.*\n\n*Stillness leads to non-doing, thus the heart is clear.\nClarity prevents confusion, thus the nature is visible.\nWisdom enables illumination, thus the spirit is whole.\nStability ensures constancy, thus the qi flows freely.\nRestraint of desire consolidates the One Origin, thus essence is generated.\nUtter emptiness empties the ten thousand conditions, thus intent is realized—\nThese are the essentials within the essentials.*\n\n*As for the various symbolic terms in the alchemical texts, many could well be discarded: lead and mercury, sun and moon, crow and hare, metal and wood, infant and maiden, east three and west four, south two and north one—all are names coined by later generations based on meaning. The key terms are nothing more than essence, qi, and spirit, which encompass the Three Origins and Five Phases. What should descend, let it descend; what should ascend, let it ascend. Guard it with stillness, unite it with emptiness. Move it with intent, yet never cling to intent.\"*\n\nTo attain it in the heart yet fundamentally have no heart.\nIn movement, it aligns with the celestial vigor of the heavens—its motion is motion within stillness.\nIn stillness, it harmonizes with the earth’s congealed solidity—its stillness is stillness within motion.\nThe crucial point lies in the Mysterious Pass, that single aperture: one must see through it clearly and hold fast to it.\nThe two preceding discourses have already exhausted this.\n\nThe Great Dao is effortless and utterly simple, devoid of anything strange enough to shock the ear—it is entirely within the reach of all, how much more so for one as keen and resolute as you?\nThose who practice internal alchemy delight in novel and marvelous theories, yet I know not what Dao they follow, nor what elixir they refine.\nWhen you read the alchemical classics, grasp their essentials.\nFor instance, Master Ziyang’s teachings—“the heart as sovereign, spirit as ruler, essence and qi as ministers, intent as matchmaker”—are all weighty words worth heeding.\nBut his methods of withdrawal and addition, of firing and transformation, established as the Ten Cycles—these cannot be wholly trusted.\nRefining the elixir is like cooking rice: too fierce a fire burns it, too gentle a fire leaves it raw; only when the fire is neither too strong nor too weak does the rice achieve perfect flavor.\nIf the fire is too intense in alchemy, lead scatters and mercury flees—thus the value of a fire that lingers like a thread of existence.\nIf the fire is too weak, the crucible grows cold and the furnace chills—thus the value of constant, wakeful presence.\nWhen the fire is neither too strong nor too weak, and the firing time is just right, all yin dissolves of itself, and the yang spirit naturally appears.\nWhy invent so many names and pursue divergent paths to confuse learners?\n\nNow I shall clarify the two-word secret once more: stillness and observation.\nIn observation, stillness presides; in stillness, observation abides—thus the method of elixir-refining is complete.\nIn the latter part of Master Ziyang’s alchemical classic, the twelve hours of the day are matched with left and right numerical divisions—perhaps these were his own experiential states, but this may not hold true for all.\nFor the meridians and collaterals of the human body differ subtly, so the application of fire may not always align; each must explore and verify for themselves.\nYet Master Zhang sought to bind all under heaven to his own method—this is delusion.\nThat is why I teach you to refine the heart and cultivate stillness, leaving the firing times to nature: my firing times are thus, but yours may not be the same.\nI have my own insights; to force uniformity is like tuning a zither with glued pegs.\n\nOnce autumn cools, begin practicing stillness at once.\nA single point of sincere heart, and the ten thousand conditions all cease; inner demons vanish, and outer demons naturally disperse.\nMoreover, as you recite the *Scripture of the Great Cavern*, the dharma-protecting deities will not leave your side—you need not fear this.\nWhen the karmic bonds of the human heart remain unsevered, one is one’s own greatest demon lord.\nEvery thought and perception is a demon general or soldier; the liver, kidneys, lungs, and intestines are all demon lairs and dens.\nBut if the heart-ground is spiritually luminous, the wellspring of nature limpid and clear, resolve firmly established, and aspirations grandly kindled—even if a hundred thousand demon armies encircle you, what is there to fear?\nA true hero, with a heart of bronze and guts of iron, undertakes great deeds for the cosmos; even facing blades, saws, cauldrons, and execution, one does not fear death—how much less should mere illusions, these so-called demons, cause alarm?\nThey are but phantoms—have you ever seen a phantom disturb the true heart?\nPress forward boldly, advance without retreat—you must vow to remain steadfast!\n\n**Disciple:** How long must one sit in stillness before the original spirit and original qi appear?\n**Master:** When sitting reaches the state of no thought and no念, true breath lingers unbroken, the original spirit emerges, and the original qi arises.\n**Disciple:** Do spirit and qi have form?\n**Master:** A realm of pure emptiness—how could there be form?\n**Disciple:** Then why call it spirit? Why call it qi?\n**Master:** That which is numinous within is called spirit; that which moves is called qi.\n**Disciple:** If it has no form, how can the elixir be formed?\n**Master:** From nothing, something arises.\n**Disciple:** How long must one sit to reach no thought and no念?\n**Master:** For beginners in seated meditation, after a few moments, illusory delusions may be dispelled.\nWith long practice in stillness, in the time it takes to eat a meal, one may already drift into the realm of nothingness.\nFor beginners, not only must one maintain mindfulness during sitting, but in all actions and undertakings, one must constantly uphold the insights and attainments gained during meditation—thus the power of concentration readily matures, sublime states readily manifest, and absorption deepens.\nThe whole body melts and merges, like clouds over mountains and moonlight on rivers.\nThe alchemist’s gathering of lead and drawing of mercury occur when, in the state of fasting the heart and forgetting the self, a single point of fetal breath flows forth.\n\n**Disciple:** Your disciple has long been beset by hidden misfortune, constantly encountering hardships, and has resigned himself to an early death in some ditch. Across ten thousand kalpas, as countless as mustard seeds or ox hairs, what fortune to meet a sagely teacher in this life and receive guidance on the Great Dao!\nMoved to tears and stirred to action, my reverence deepens—may you fully transmit the secret essence of the numinous elixir!\nOnce I attain the Dao, I vow to remain under your guidance forever, taking eternal refuge!\n**Master:** What I have discussed thus far has been detailed on nature and brief on life. What your heart still finds unsatisfactory lies here.\nThe formation of the elixir begins with refining the heart; refining the heart lies in still observation.\nWhen still observation reaches its apex, the Great Medicine arises spontaneously, and the Three Origins mutually manifest.\nEstablishing the furnace and crucible, the wind of Xun and the earth of Kun—Master Ziyang’s teachings are worth heeding.\nAs for the operation of the firing times, there is more to say.\nThe blood and qi of the human body circulate and flow, their cyclic ascent and descent naturally corresponding to the celestial degrees.\nIn movement, one does not perceive it, but in stillness, the meridians and joints between bones warmly ascend and gently descend, precise to the inch and exact to the hair’s breadth.\nFrom the tailbone, it reverses to the Mud Pill Palace; from the Mud Pill Palace, it descends to the Crimson Palace, converging in the chamber of spirit, merging with the qi of the Five Phases into one, and returning to the Yellow Court within the navel.\n\nAt this very moment, \"a single point descends into the Yellow Court.\" The method of withdrawing lead and adding mercury is nothing more than this. The various theories are myriad and exceedingly trivial.\n\nWhen the yang spirit emerges from the womb, a light radiates outward from the navel wheel, and a fragrance issues from the nose and mouth—these are the precursors of its emergence. Once emerged, golden light scatters in all directions, the pores of the skin gleam like crystal, akin to the sun rising over the sea or a pearl first appearing in the depths, while the fragrant qi suffuses the chamber. With a thunderous crack, metal and fire intermingle, and the yang spirit departs from the Mud Pill Palace.\n\nAfter its departure, everything depends on the work cultivated in ordinary times. This is precisely why I first spoke of refining the heart-mind. If the heart-ground has been nurtured to emptiness and clarity, the yang spirit will be composed purely of primordial spiritual qi, inherently free from thought and action, unstained by circumstances, unmoved by phenomena, with mastery over its gathering and release, coming and going as it pleases. As soon as it enters the Mud Pill Palace, the body becomes as if scorched by fire, golden light once again emanates from the pores, and fragrant qi once more fills the air. In an instant, it returns to the Yellow Court, existing as if non-existent, unknowing and unaware—this is the true state.\n\nIf the heart-ground has not attained emptiness and clarity, the womb formed will certainly not be the sacred embryo, and the spirit cultivated will inherently carry traces of impurity. Like one whose qi is clouded by turbidity, governed by the nature of conditioned existence, though the spirit may emerge, at the sight of something fearful, terror arises; at the sight of something desirable, attachment arises. It may linger and forget to return, following the path into demonic realms. Though the body may die, and the unknowing may believe one has attained immortality and transformed in meditation, who realizes that the yang spirit, once departed, will never return? Such an outcome is beyond remedy.\n\nEarlier, I spoke of refining the heart-mind as half the work of attaining immortality; now, upon reflection, it is the essential path from beginning to end. What was once called half is now called complete, even doubled—should the sages return, they would not alter my words.\n\nSomeone asks: If the heart-ground has not attained perfect emptiness and clarity, yet the embryonic spirit has already emerged, what is to be done?\n\nThe master replies: If there is no other recourse, there remains the practice of refining emptiness. Though the embryonic spirit has emerged, it must be tightly reined in to complete the work of refining emptiness. Only then may the monkey be released, allowing it to roam freely within the true light of the dharma realm, transformed and vast beyond comprehension.\n\nI venture to ask: What is meant by \"refining emptiness\"?\n\nIt is difficult to put into words.\n\nPreviously, I spoke of the method of *huohou* (fire timing). What you now read in the alchemical classics aligns with my intent—nothing more than abiding in stillness and inward observation, allowing the true *qi* to circulate without cease. This is also called \"drawing lead and adding mercury,\" which is simply the constant ascent of true water and the constant descent of true fire. The ancient sages’ four characters—\"curbing anger, restraining desire\"—are the essential secrets of bathing, drawing, and adding. If anger is not curbed, fire that should descend will instead rise; if desire is not restrained, water that should ascend will instead drain away. Even if ninety-nine percent of the work is complete, the elixir crucible will still fail, true essence will leak downward, and unforeseen dangers may arise—not merely the failure to achieve perfection.\n\nYet curbing anger and restraining desire are still forced efforts. Only when there is no anger to curb, no desire to restrain, and even the thought of curbing and restraining is forgotten, can the elixir be formed. The method of refining the elixir begins with refining the heart, proceeds to gathering and absorption, and concludes with *huohou*—nothing more. The method of refining the heart takes stillness and observation as its foundation. In the stillness of observation, there is observation without object; in the observation of stillness, movement arises from stillness. Primordial essence flows abundantly, primordial spirit leaps vigorously, primordial *qi* surges and swells—thus the three primals are complete.\n\nThe method of gathering and absorption: true intention arises from the true heart, true essence follows true intention. When drawn upward, it is like a pearl luring a dragon, gently and without haste or slack; when drawn downward, it is like bamboo channeling a spring, trickling steadily without rush or delay. It is like playing the sheng or tuning the zither, like the joy of man and woman, the firmness of husband and the softness of wife—when their passions harmonize, they are sent into the Yellow Palace, and the principle of gathering and union is complete.\n\nAs for *huohou*: the steaming of true *qi* is the bath, its unbroken continuity is the drawing and adding. After ten months, a being like a person leaps forth from within, lingering in the Palace of the Sun, emerging in the Mansion of Muddy Pellet—thus the elixir of the entire body is formed.\n\nAs for refining emptiness: it requires a vast and unbounded heart, a subtlety that forgets the body, no self and no other, no heaven and no earth. One awakens to a pure, empty *qi*, within the undifferentiated chaos—a single spark of true yang, neither self nor not-self, neither empty nor not-empty. Creation revolves, yin and yang alternate in brilliance, divided yet indivisible, united yet ununitable—this is called refining emptiness. Refining emptiness is the union of the emptiness of the yang spirit with the emptiness of the great void, merging without gap, what is called \"form and spirit both wondrous, uniting with the Dao in truth.\" This is the work after the emergence of the embryo, the matter before the division of the body.\n\nSomeone asks: After the yang spirit emerges from the embryo, it still resides within the human abdomen—how can it unite with the great void?\n\nThe master replies: Emptying the heart can make one forget the form. When a person reaches the point of forgetting the form, the yang spirit within the abdomen is no different from being in the great void—how could it not unite with it?\n\nIn sum, refining emptiness completes only the final stage of refining the heart. The illusory body has form, so it is called refining the heart; the yang spirit is formless, so it is called refining emptiness.\n\nSomeone asks: How long must one practice refining emptiness?\n\nThe master replies: Nine years of nurturing accomplishes only the work of refining emptiness. The wonder of refining emptiness is boundless transformation—one can tread upon rosy clouds, ride the mist, and fly away with the whole body. How could it be merely the emergence of the spirit? Yet this stage is the most difficult; among thousands or tens of thousands, scarcely one or two attain it.\n\nSomeone asks: If one refines the heart to the point of utter nothingness, after the embryo emerges, can the step of refining emptiness be omitted?\n\nThe master replies: If one has refined to utter nothingness, then body and heart are both transformed into emptiness—what emptiness remains to be refined? With a heart of utter nothingness, one forms an embryo of utter nothingness, nurtures a yang spirit of utter nothingness, and unites with the great void of utter nothingness. Manifesting the great dharma-body, radiating great light, a hundred thousand myriad bodies fill the space of the void—like a luminous pearl emitting light, it is all one light.\n\nIf, during the refining of the heart, the residual roots are not thoroughly cleansed, the yang spirit will be a mixed spirit. Though it may wish to soar into the heavens, it will be like a needle hidden in silk or water mixed with oil—unable to merge. Thus, one must rely on nine years of nurturing to accomplish the work of emerging from the embryo and refining emptiness, refining until one reaches utter nothingness.\n\nIn brief: the yang spirit of refining the heart is *xing* (nature); the yang spirit of refining emptiness is *fan* (return). Between *xing* and *fan*, it is not something humans can force.\n\nSomeone asks: If, as you say, the yang spirit refined through the heart can emerge without the effort of nurturing, and emerging too early is criticized in the alchemical classics, what does this mean?\n\nThe master replies: What I have transmitted to you is the supreme vehicle of refining the heart. From this, the embryo formed is a sacred embryo; from this, the spirit that emerges is a sage. Radiating great light, transcending the three realms, uniting with the great void and enduring eternally, outlasting heaven and earth without decay—this is the wondrous path of cultivation practiced by the ancient buddhas of the West.\n\nAlas, the teachers of this world know only how to refine *ming* (destiny) and not how to refine *xing* (nature). They know only the methods of opening the passes, closing the breath, shifting the furnace, and changing the crucible, but not the principle that true nature is originally empty, utterly without thing. The embryo they form is but a mortal embryo; the spirit they produce is but a mortal. They still cannot ascend to heaven, still cannot join the ranks of the sages. With no other recourse, they must begin the work anew, sending this child to cultivate the Dao and refine truth, to awaken the heart and see nature—making the solid empty, the existent nonexistent. This is what is meant by seeking the root through its branches.\n\nJust as a man who is fundamentally weak and also afflicted with wind-cold—if an ignorant physician merely seeks to supplement his weakness, thereby reinforcing the wind-cold along with it—how can the illness be dispelled? The Daoist art of refining *ming* is the medicine that supplements the original; the art of refining the heart is the medicine that removes illness. If one wishes to refine *ming*, one must first refine *xing*; if one wishes to supplement the primordial, one must first clear away the杂病 and remove them—this is an immutable principle. Thus, those who cultivate with utmost dedication place singular importance on refining the heart. When the last speck of primordial spirit is dredged clean, it shines like the moon reflected in water. When the fire-tending reaches its moment, the embryo of spirit becomes complete. Lifting the lid of the crucible, one leaps free from the wheel of rebirth, and all within heaven and earth transforms into a single mass of purple-golden radiance, ascending to penetrate the Three Pure Realms and descending to pervade the Six Paths. Then the Most High Lord of the Primordial and the Ancient Buddha Vairocana will joyfully come to meet, clasping hands to recount the long separation, lamenting only that the reunion came so late. This is near at hand in but an instant—what need is there to speak of nine years of nurturing?\n\nThe practice of regulating the breath serves to gather the scattered mind. If one can inwardly observe in stillness, moment by moment, what need is there for counting? Only when still observation reaches the point where not a single thought arises may one use intention to seek the Mysterious Pass. Yet if it is said that not a single thought arises, why then use intention to seek? One must understand that the method of using intention has its subtlety: it is to attend within the absence of mind, like one who tends a fire—though no flame is seen, the fire does not go out. When all realms are empty, a sudden awakening arises—what else could this be but the Mysterious Pass? From this point, one must clearly recognize this mechanism. It is like someone riding a thousand-mile steed, galloping without a trace of dust; if I wish to recognize the rider on that horse, I need only glance once, firmly fixing in mind the three hairs on his cheek, vivid before my eyes—only then does the Mysterious Pass truly become mine.\n\nImmortality beyond death, transcending beyond the ten thousand kalpas, all depends on this single awakening to take charge for me. The ten thousand transformations all depend on this single awakening as their pivot. Yet this awakening is no easy matter. Priceless treasures like luminous pearls and fine jade may be sought through wisdom and effort, but this single awakening cannot be obtained through wisdom or effort. Yet it is also not a difficult matter. Though one may wander to the ends of the earth, it is originally near at hand—each person possesses it, and it costs not a single coin to acquire.\n\nSome may ask: \"In refining the elixir, should there not be concrete effort? Why rely on this single awakening?\" I reply: This single awakening is most rare since the beginningless beginning. The Supreme Ultimate obtained this single awakening and gave birth to heaven and earth; our bodies possess this single awakening and become immortals and buddhas. In total, there are two such awakenings. But when and where is this awakening to be sought? It is found in the moment when stillness reaches its extreme and movement begins. It is not present in stillness, nor in movement—it appears for but a single breath, and after that breath, it is no longer seen.\n\n**Scroll Two**\nThe Southern Culmen Heavenly Palace, the Azure Radiance Supreme Emperor;\n\nAs the emissary of Supreme Clarity, born of the primordial division of the Original Beginning;\nManifesting divine traces age after age, revealing transformed bodies time after time;\nDwelling on Mount Kongtong to transmit the esoteric secrets of the Mysterious Darkness, crossing the Hangu Pass to cultivate the scriptures of virtue and the Dao;\nIn the world, the teacher of emperors and kings; in heaven, the elder of gods and immortals;\nVast in compassion, vast in vows, utmost in sageliness, utmost in benevolence;\nAbsolving sins, bestowing blessings, delivering boundless beings—\nThe Heavenly Worthy, the Supreme Dao Ancestor, the Immortal Master who confers the registers.\n\nWhat is the Supreme Ultimate?\nIt is the single golden elixir since the primordial chaos.\nAfter giving birth to heaven and earth, does the Supreme Ultimate scatter and vanish?\nThe Supreme Ultimate can transform: in one transformation, it becomes the myriad; yet each of the myriad contains a Supreme Ultimate.\nIn the myriad’s return to one, the one remains a Supreme Ultimate.\nThis Supreme Ultimate—vast, it encompasses heaven and earth; minute, it enters a mustard seed.\nHeaven and earth take form, yet the Supreme Ultimate is formless; heaven and earth perish, yet the Supreme Ultimate does not perish.\nAh! Those who grasp this teaching may refine the elixir.\n\nWhat is the elixir?\nIt is the Supreme Ultimate within the human being.\nOne body may divide into ten thousand bodies, yet the ten thousand bodies still merge into one—just as the Supreme Ultimate is one becoming myriad, the myriad returning to one.\nAh! Those who grasp this teaching may speak of the yang spirit.\n\nQuestion: What is the meaning of the term \"aperture\" in \"the Mysterious Pass’s single aperture\"?\nThe Master said: \"Aperture\" signifies utmost emptiness.\nWherever things are empty, they respond readily when touched—people call into a well and the echo answers within; wind sounds and the resonance enters the valley’s depths. Such is the natural principle.\nWhen the human heart is empty of things, within this utmost emptiness, should something touch it, the moment and opportunity align, and suddenly there is movement. This moment of sudden movement is where the single spark of numinous light alights.\nAs the *Book of Changes* says: \"Still and unmoving, yet when stimulated, it penetrates all things under heaven.\" This is what it means.\n\nQuestion: When the Supreme Ultimate generates the Two Modes, does it do so through accumulation?\nThe Master said: Qi may accumulate, but spirit does not.\nWhen this mechanism arrives, it is the source of beginning and birth, with no gap between.\nThus, once the Supreme Ultimate establishes its foundation, the myriad forms all emerge from this origin.\nQuestion: How do the Limitless and the Supreme Ultimate differ?\nWithin this lies the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass—this is how the Limitless and the Supreme Ultimate divide.\nThe Limitless is the Supreme Ultimate; this is an unchanging truth.\nI speak only of the Supreme Ultimate, not the Limitless, for this reason.\nFearing you may not understand, I say again: the Limitless is the Supreme Ultimate.\nThe Limitless is ○; the Supreme Ultimate is ⊙.\nYet with the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass, the names \"Limitless\" and \"Supreme Ultimate\" diverge—though in reality, there is no division.\nTo say the Supreme Ultimate generates heaven and earth, and that when heaven and earth divide, the Supreme Ultimate is thereby separated, seems plausible.\nYet when heaven and earth divide, the Supreme Ultimate is never divided—it remains undifferentiated, just as it was before heaven and earth were born.\nThe *Doctrine of the Mean* says: \"Speak of the great, and nothing under heaven can contain it\"—the Supreme Ultimate encompasses heaven and earth; \"speak of the small, and nothing under heaven can break it\"—the Supreme Ultimate enters all things.\nUnited with heaven and earth, it is a single Supreme Ultimate; divided among the myriad things, each possesses a Supreme Ultimate—how then can the Supreme Ultimate be divided?\nYet when yin and yang separate to become heaven and earth, why is this?\nThis is the function of the Supreme Ultimate, not its essence.\nYin and yang are the functions of the Supreme Ultimate.\nBeyond heaven and earth, within heaven and earth—it is still the Supreme Ultimate that pervades and infuses all.\nIf the Supreme Ultimate were destroyed, heaven and earth would be destroyed; yet when heaven and earth are destroyed, the Supreme Ultimate ultimately remains undestroyed.\nWhy? Because it is empty and numinous—empty, thus without form; numinous, thus everlasting. How could it be destroyed?\nTherefore, those who refine the elixir restore the essence of the Supreme Ultimate, and the elixir is complete.\n\nWhat connection does my teaching of the Mysterious Pass’s single awakening have with elixir refinement?\nYou do not realize that when one perceives the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass, this utterly empty and numinous thing is wholly present within one’s own heart.\nThis wholeness is the Supreme Ultimate—the Supreme Ultimate of spirit refinement.\nWith this Supreme Ultimate, yang ascends above, yin descends below, and they congeal into the elixir—just as the Supreme Ultimate generates heaven and earth. This is the Supreme Ultimate of form refinement.\nThe elixir is singular.\nOnly the Dao is without counterpart, hence it is called the elixir.\nHeaven attains the One and becomes clear; earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; valleys attain the One and become full; humans attain the One and attain longevity.\nThe One is singular.\nThus, I explain it as singularity, the meaning of \"one.\"\nThe Supreme Ultimate generates yin and generates yang—yin and yang are counterparts, so why is it called singular?\nThe Supreme Ultimate has never possessed yin or yang; it is simply one.\nDoes it generate yin and yang at the moment when the Two Modes are about to divide?\nAll things arise from duality, but the Supreme Ultimate is one—how could it generate yin and yang?\nI do not speak of the Supreme Ultimate; let us speak of Fuxi’s single stroke. What does this signify?\nDuality generates, but singularity does not.\nWhy did Fuxi not draw two strokes but only one?\nThe *Doctrine of the Mean* says: \"As a thing, it is without duality.\" Without duality, it is one.\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao.\" One yin, one yang are the functions of the Dao.\nAs for the essence of the Dao, it is without yin or yang, yet it is the root of yin and yang.\nThus, the Supreme Ultimate has no yin or yang—does yin and yang arise at the moment when the Two Modes are about to divide?\nIf the Supreme Ultimate has no yin or yang, then what is this single thing ○?\nIt is spirit.\nSpirit is the body of transformation. When the Mysterious Pass stirs, the moving aspect divides into yang, the still aspect divides into yin, and the Supreme Ultimate blossoms and bears fruit.\n\nThen is the Supreme Ultimate one? Is it singular?\nIn the human body, every part comes in pairs—reversing this duality yields the elixir.\nWhere lies the Way to reverse duality and return to singularity?\nIt is said: attain emptiness and guard stillness, and one returns to singularity.\nThe elixir *is* the Supreme Ultimate.\nThe Ultimateless is the Supreme Ultimate—one becomes two, two becomes one.\n\nA question arises: Master, you previously spoke of the Mysterious Pass as a single aperture, through which the Ultimateless and Supreme Ultimate divide. This seems to imply qi precedes spirit. Yet now you say the Supreme Ultimate’s singularity ○ is spirit, which seems to imply spirit precedes qi. I pray the Master, with your all-penetrating wisdom and boundless eloquence, resolve this disciple’s doubt.\n\nThe Master replies: The Supreme Ultimate generates qi through spirit—yet in division, there is no true division. Consider fire in the void: the nature of fire is inherently void. If we say the void contains fire, then all mountains, rivers, gardens, forests, and grasses should burn away. Yet if we say the nature of fire is void, then void clinging to void—where is its foundation? When two voids meet, from where does their nature arise?\nThe Supreme Ultimate’s relation to yin and yang is the same. The Supreme Ultimate is without yin or yang, yet the origin of yin and yang is contained within it. If the Supreme Ultimate first possessed yin and yang, and only then did numinous radiance descend into it, then what is called the Supreme Ultimate would be vanishingly small. Only in its undifferentiated, misty, and boundless state—neither visible as yin and yang nor divisible into yin and yang—does the stirring of the Mysterious Pass cause yin and yang to separate, giving rise to heaven and earth, from which nothing does not proceed. It is like a fire-starting mirror: no fire is seen within it, yet when the sun shines upon it, the mugwort ignites and burns the hand. From this, what can be called prior, and what posterior?\n\nThe questioner asks: Master, you say the Supreme Ultimate’s ○ is spirit—then is this undifferentiated, misty, and boundless state qi or spirit? Does spirit arise from within, or enter from without? This disciple gathers his spirit and sharpens his hearing to receive the Dharma-sound.\n\nThe Master replies: Before the One True is pierced, it is called undifferentiated. When the primordial unity first stirs, it is called misty and boundless.\nSpirit generates qi, qi generates essence—this is how the Supreme Ultimate proceeds in sequence. Essence transforms into qi, qi transforms into spirit—this is how humans reverse the process to become immortals, returning to the origin and restoring the primordial.\nSpirit does not arise from within, nor does it enter from without. If it arose from within, then the Supreme Ultimate would exist before spirit, first forming a singular ○ to await spirit’s generation. But the Supreme Ultimate does not await anything. If it entered from without, then the Supreme Ultimate’s vastness—so great it has no exterior—where could it enter from? The Supreme Ultimate has no exterior.\nIf spirit is neither within nor without, then from where does it begin? It begins naturally. But where does the natural begin? Where there is the Supreme Ultimate, there is spirit.\nYet even the word *begins* should not be applied. The Supreme Ultimate *is* spirit as the Supreme Ultimate.\nYet even the word *is* should not be applied. The Supreme Ultimate *is* spirit, spirit *is* the Supreme Ultimate.\nYet even the word *is* should not be applied. Once thought or explanation arises, it is no longer the Supreme Ultimate.\nIn sum, the ○ fulfills the meaning of the Supreme Ultimate. What is exterior or interior, beginning or non-beginning?\nIt is like fire in stone or fire in a mirror: from where does this fire begin, and from when? Does it arise from within, or enter from without? If we say it begins when the stone is formed or the mirror is cast, then before the stone existed or the mirror was made, where was the fire? If we say it arises from within the stone or mirror, then why does the stone not turn to ash, or the mirror melt? If we say it enters from without, then metal and stone are utterly hard—how could there be cracks for it to seep through? At this point, analogy and discussion fail.\nThen how does it truly begin, and how does it arise?\nAll things begin from emptiness. The Supreme Ultimate *is* emptiness. Emptiness encountering emptiness—there is no subtlety that is not empty. Emptiness returning to emptiness—what nature is not the same?\nEmptiness gives birth to one, one gives birth to the myriad things. The myriad things return to one, one returns to emptiness. Emptiness is the ancestor of the myriad things.\nScholars must see true emptiness, not false emptiness. They must see numinous emptiness, not inert emptiness. They must see complete emptiness, not partial emptiness. They must see emptiness of nature, not emptiness of form. They must see void emptiness, not solid emptiness. They must see constant emptiness, not strange emptiness. They must see original emptiness, not past emptiness. They must see the emptiness of immortals and buddhas, not the emptiness of heterodox paths. They must see the emptiness of the sun, moon, stars, mountains, rivers, gardens, forests, grasses—all that has form and image—not the emptiness of frost, bubbles, shadows, stone sparks, or lightning, which leave no trace and are called empty.\nIs the elixir the body of metal?\nHeaven-one generates water, but water has no metal mother—how can it generate? Thus I say: singular.\nThe elixir embodies the meaning of singularity.\nAnother explanation: singular means one, taking the meaning of Heaven-one.\nEarth-four generates metal, but when water generates, metal does not yet exist. Yet the qi of yin and yang flowing down from the Supreme Ultimate contains the Five Phases within it. The nature of metal is complete within, and the Supreme Ultimate’s utterly empty, numinous, bright, and pure virtue—its nature is the nature of metal, its color is the color of metal, presiding over the Five Phases.\nThus when yin and yang separate, the first thing generated is water—mother gives birth to child. Earth-four generates metal, but this refers to formed substance, not the time of formlessness and insubstantiality.\nHow do we know the Supreme Ultimate is the nature and color of metal?\nWhen those who attain the Dao realize perfect clarity, wondrous awakening, and the primordial, their bodies appear golden, and their heads radiate golden light. Perfect clarity, wondrous awakening, and the primordial are the body of the Supreme Ultimate, and golden light and golden color respond immediately.\n\nDaoist adepts in refining the elixir first seek the Supreme Ultimate within the body, and the elixir they form resembles a grain of purple gold. When the yang spirit manifests, the entire body takes on the hue of refined purple gold. How could the Supreme Ultimate alone not be thus? Moreover, in reasoning through the Five Phases, only metal’s nature is most empty, and only emptiness endures. All things empty resound, and metal resounds—thus we know its emptiness. Metal’s nature is also most dynamic; movement engenders numinosity, and numinosity enables transformation, as known through the child it generates. Metal’s child is water, whose nature flows without cease, mirroring its mother. By the child’s nature we know the mother: the Supreme Ultimate is that which is empty yet numinous, its color golden light, its nature the nature of metal.\n\nRefining the elixir is refining the One. What is meant by refining the One? The One is Heavenly One, and Heavenly One is metal. The Supreme Ultimate is the nature of metal—this is the wondrousness of spontaneity, not of formed substance. Thus, those who refine the elixir refine metal into pure gold, and the elixir is complete.\n\nWithin the human body, all Five Phases are present, yet metal is foremost. Why? Heavenly One generates water, and water is metal’s child. No thing is born without a mother. Know that the precelestial single point of true gold resides within the human body, and the human voice is the metal within. Consider the Five Phases: does wood have sound? Wood’s sound is hollow. Does water have sound? Water’s sound is rushing. Does fire have sound? Fire’s sound is roaring. Does earth have sound? Earth’s sound is rumbling. Only metal’s sound rings clear. Thus, when an infant emerges from the womb, its first cry rings forth—metal is the cause. Metal, being empty, resounds; when the child departs the mother’s womb, it becomes empty and thus can resound. The mother nurtures the child, and metal dwells with water. Water is what Heavenly One generates. Wherever earthly metal is found, white qi rises upward. The essence within the human body is white in color—this is the qi of metal. Thus, those who refine the elixir gather the blossom exhaled by primordial essence, combining it with the mercury of the Li trigram to form the elixir. When the fire timing is complete, golden light radiates outward—this is its original nature.\n\nYet metal fears the scorching of fire and melts upon encountering it. How then does the metal of the Kan trigram approach the fire of the Li trigram? In terms of symbolic resonance, metal’s long life begins at *si*, which is fire. People only know that metal fears fire, but metal truly loves fire—this they do not know. How do we see this? When metal lies within earth, only earth is visible, not metal. Only when true fire presses upon it does earth’s qi disperse and metal’s form appear, like a child in the womb unable to emerge until the stirring of numinous impulse reveals the three luminaries. Fire is metal’s numinous impulse. Thus, where metal lies within earth, frost and snow cannot settle above it. Metal loves to be born from fire, for it originally bears fire’s nature. Therefore, bringing the metal of Kan to the fire of Li is returning to its origin and following its preference. The elixir as metal is thus expansively realized.\n\nVague thoughts are not intent; wandering thoughts are delusive imaginings. Intent arises truly and directly from the heart. Once intent arises, the heart becomes empty again—thus it is also said: \"Have intent as if without intent.\" Great is the function of intent! At first, when yang arises, it is intent. After it arises, gathering the original yang is intent. After gathering, uniting in the spirit chamber is intent. After uniting, sending it into the Yellow Court is intent. Great is the function of intent! Nor is this all: the emergence of the yang spirit is intent. After emerging, riding the void and soaring on the wind is intent. Roaming the celestial realm and returning to the spirit chamber is intent. Great is the function of intent!\n\nSomeone may ask: Can the yang spirit eat, drink, and speak? Does it have viscera? The answer: it can be said to have them, and it can be said not to. What does it mean to have them?\n\nAfter ten months, a radiant child is born—able to laugh, to speak, to eat and drink, to walk and move. If it had no viscera, it would be but a puppet; who would govern its speech and actions? Therefore I say it *has* them.\n\nWhat does it mean to say it *has no* them? The yang spirit is utterly empty and without substance. It casts no shadow by day, leaves no tracks in mud, enters fire without scorching, enters water without wetting. It can conceal its form within metal or stone, or transform into creatures that fly, swim, move, or grow. If it had form or substance, how could it turn and revolve with such perfect freedom, its transformations unobstructed? Therefore I say it *has no* them.\n\nThen is the yang spirit truly existent, or truly nonexistent? I say: if it were existent, then all things between Heaven and Earth would be yang spirit; if it were nonexistent, then originally there would be nothing within my heart. The loftiest adepts merge with the Dao in truth. The Dao transforms the ten thousand images and assumes form according to things—thus the existence of the yang spirit is certain. The Dao is without form or sound, yet embraces Heaven and Earth. From emptiness it generates the One, from the One it generates the myriad things; the myriad things return to the One, the One returns to emptiness. Emptiness moves emptiness—only then is the work of transformation revealed. Thus the nonexistence of the yang spirit is certain.\n\nThe student must grasp this fundamental principle, then they will not be deluded by illusory forms or illusory thoughts. Whether the yang spirit is accomplished or not, whether it emerges or not, may be left to nature.\n\nThe Way of forming the elixir is simply *one*. Attain the One, and all things are complete. The One is unity—can it be named or spoken of? It can. The One is nothing else: it is emptiness alone. Since I began discussing the Dao with you, I have spoken only of this single word: *emptiness*. Refining the heart is emptiness; employing intent is emptiness; gathering the medicine is emptiness; forming the embryo is emptiness; the firing process is emptiness; the yang spirit is emptiness; refining emptiness is returning emptiness to emptiness; the Mysterious Pass is awakening to emptiness through emptiness. A thousand emptinesses, ten thousand emptinesses—all are but one emptiness.\n\nThis emptiness is not the emptiness of mere void, but the emptiness of true fullness; not the emptiness of dispersion, but the emptiness of perfect wholeness. Thus it is called the One.\n\nIf I do not speak of emptiness, so be it. But if I do, observe: within your body, is each part empty, or is each part substantial? Originally, all is empty, yet you make all substantial. The heart is originally empty, yet you make it substantial with sense-objects. The spirit is originally empty, yet you make it substantial with thoughts and worries. Essence is originally empty, yet you make it substantial with lust and desire. Qi is originally empty, yet you make it substantial with toil and disturbance. Intent is originally empty, yet you make it substantial with joy, anger, sorrow, and fear. The nose is originally empty, yet you make it substantial with excessive smelling. The ears are originally empty, yet you make them substantial with excessive hearing. The eyes are originally empty, yet you make them substantial with excessive seeing. The mouth is originally empty, yet you make it substantial with excessive speech. The hands and feet are originally empty, yet you make them substantial with reckless action. The pores are originally empty, yet you make them substantial with foulness and filth.\n\nOriginally, each part is empty, but through you, each becomes substantial. Thus body and heart are shackled by the substantial. Alas! This most empty of things meets with you, the most substantial of beings—like feathers entering water, unable to take flight, destined only to rot.\n\nHow then to return to emptiness? The Confucians say *stop*; the Daoists say *stillness*; the Buddhists say *samādhi*. Ceaselessly dissolve the substantial, like a vat filled with filth—removing it requires effort. But if one can instantly realize the original state, in an instant transcend the leakless, like a swift wind sweeping away dust, like the sun melting snow—this is supreme awakening. The elixir is formed, the primordial transformed in the blink of an eye.\n\nSomeone asks: Human delusions all arise from perception. How can one make perception as if it were not perception?\n\nThe master replies: Excellent question! Of the sense faculties, perception does the greatest harm. You ask how to make perception as if it were not perception—only by preserving the spirit and settling the heart. There are three essentials.\n\nFirst, in the moment before awareness arises, nurture it as the moon in empty space—limpid, pure, and bright, without dregs, unmoving yet ever aware. Beautiful forms and seductive sounds are ultimately one with my nature. Things are not different from me, nor I from things. Things and I are undivided; the spirit does not linger or depart, but abides always in the heart.\n\nSecond, at the moment awareness is about to arise, remain alert and undimmed, every response measured and harmonious, like the strings of a zither producing the sound of perfect harmony, resonating at the touch, subtly comprehended yet unattached to things. Thus it arises yet does not arise, and the spirit abides in the heart.\n\nThird, at the interchange of awareness, discern clearly, perceive the subtle workings, like a chariot’s horses—twenty-four hooves moving in perfect accord, many horses moving as one, many hooves moving as one hoof. Like clouds drifting, like water flowing, all arises naturally, without allowing dust to mingle within. Thus it flows unimpeded, turning through the great void, and the spirit abides in the heart.\n\nThough there is perception, the spirit is separate from it. Though the spirit is in the eyes, perception and spirit are one.\n\nWhat is meant by \"the spirit being separate from perception\"? When an object touches perception, perception does not cling to the object; when perception touches an object, the object does not cling to perception. Like the light of a mirror reflecting an image, the image never has the intention to enter the mirror, nor does the mirror have the intention to touch the object—where then is the spirit’s wandering?\n\nWhat is meant by \"perception and spirit being one\"? Where there is no object, there is no perception, yet the nature of perception is not destroyed; where there is perception and an object, the nature of perception does not arise. Myriad forms pass beyond, while the one true reality is contained within. Like fire within beryl glass, it illuminates all things in the room, yet the fire remains within the beryl, not outside it—where then is the spirit’s wandering?\n\nIn sum, still illumination remains ever bright, and the true spirit abides in freedom. The sun and moon may end, but the eye of wisdom is boundless. Have you not seen the fish? The fish does not see the water, and its nature is at ease; if the fish were to see the water, its nature would be wearied. Perception should be as if non-perception—this is the proper view.\n\nLiuxia Hui embraced a woman without seeing her as a woman. Refining the elixir and refining the heart are ultimately one and the same.\n\nRefining the heart means refining the heart that one possesses; refining the elixir means refining the elixir that is fundamentally non-existent. The heart is called \"having,\" the elixir is called \"non-having\"—what is having, and what is non-having? There is a subtle principle herein.\n\nThe heart takes spirit as its sovereign. When the spirit abides in the heart, the elixir is mine to possess; when the spirit wanders toward external things, then I do not possess the heart. Without possessing the heart, the fire blazes, and when the fire blazes, the mercury is exhausted—the great medicine loses its unity.\n\nThough the Great Way values non-mind, the \"having\" within non-having is true having. Refining the heart means refining the heart that exists within non-having.\n\nThe elixir takes essence as its foundation—this is not the essence of sexual union. The essence of sexual union is mixed with the fire of desire, water carrying fire within, its flavor salty and unusable. Thus, seawater can be boiled to produce salt. The sea is the valley of water; gazing from high ridges at deep night, one often sees flames scorching the sky, floating upon the water’s surface—this is its proof.\n\nThe great elixir is formless, soundless, colorless, and tasteless—how could it admit the essence tainted by impure fire? Therefore, one must gather primordial essence, a single point of pure emptiness, seemingly present yet absent, to congeal the numinous elixir. From this, a child of bare redness leaps forth. Though this child may seem to have form and appearance, in truth it is formless and imageless.\n\nRefining the fundamentally non-existent essence to forge the fundamentally non-existent elixir, nurturing the fundamentally non-existent child—thus, refining the elixir means refining the elixir that is fundamentally non-existent within having.\n\nIf the spirit does not guard its dwelling, it becomes non-mind; with non-mind, the child lacks numinosity, capable only of donning clothes and eating meals, but not of studying scriptures or discoursing on the Dao. If the essence is not primordial essence, it becomes brine; with brine, the child cannot be nurtured. Though a fetus may form, it will fail halfway, like a woman’s miscarriage, never revealing its true form.\n\nThus, the heart must have, yet also perceive the having within non-mind; the elixir must be non-having, yet also be the non-having within having. The interplay of having and non-having is the mechanism of transformation—this is called the Supreme Way.\n\nRefining the elixir is not a matter of busyness; only when there is nothing to do is it truly refining the elixir. If one can attain nothing-to-do, reaching the state of fasting the mind and sitting in forgetfulness, why refine the elixir at all? When the elixir reaches the point of not needing refinement, one is truly adept at refining the elixir.\n\nThose in the world who cling to refining the elixir treat it as a grand affair, earth-shaking and heaven-startling. Alas! This very intention distances them from the elixir. The Dao takes naturalness as its宗. The Supreme Ultimate gives birth to heaven and earth—this too is most ordinary, most plain, unknowing and unaware, transforming emptiness with emptiness, uniting reality with reality.\n\nWithin the human body is the Supreme Ultimate. Since there is the Supreme Ultimate, when yang ascends above, it is the birth of heaven; when yin descends below, it is the birth of earth. Heaven and earth in chaos remain a single empty and numinous Supreme Ultimate containing the primordial—nothing strange about it.\n\nWithout relying on thought or action, sitting calmly in a room, desiring benevolence and benevolence arrives—using what the body possesses as the body’s great elixir, like a wealthy household, dressing and eating, drawing from the palace with abundance.\n\nOne has one’s own nature—go and perceive it; one has one’s own life—go and establish it. The elixir way has no other aim but these two words: nature and life.\n\nPeople today discard nature and life, hastening death and attributing it to fate. Could it be that those who awaken to truth and ascend as immortals are fated for eternal life, transcending the three realms? How laughable!\n\nThe Buddhist sutras say: \"Neither arising nor ceasing.\" People today create illness through excessive arising. With deluded thoughts arise deluded dust, with deluded dust arise deluded realms, with deluded realms arise deluded karma—turning and turning, arising without end. Arising must cease, and with cessation must come arising, entangling for ten thousand kalpas, turning and turning in deeper delusion.\n\nIn an instant, a thought suddenly arises, a thought suddenly ceases—this very thought is the cause of life and death. With thought comes form; a form suddenly arises, a form suddenly ceases—this very form is the ground of life and death. With form comes object; an object suddenly arises, an object suddenly ceases—this very object is the condition of life and death.\n\nIn a single day, people undergo life and death, revolving in the sea of desire, tens, hundreds, thousands of times—yet the transformations of illusory form are but distant echoes.\n\nSome may ask: If the Supreme Ultimate gives birth to heaven and earth, what is meant by \"not arising\"? I say: The Supreme Ultimate gives birth to heaven and earth, yet there is that which does not arise with heaven and earth—thus, the Supreme Ultimate does not cease.\n\nTo refine what cannot be refined—how then can the elixir be an elixir? Refine emptiness until it is truly emptiness, and the elixir is complete. Emptiness holds no thing—what then is there to refine? If you would refine the elixir, you must refine where there is nothing to refine. When you refine and produce nothing, when in the end there is nothing, then the Great Elixir resides within you.\n\nThe supreme Dao is originally without anything to be called Dao; the supreme elixir is originally without anything to be called elixir. To cling to form and seek it is to turn far from the Way. Consider your own body—what in it is truly real? Your hands? Feet? Ears, eyes, mouth, nose? Liver, kidneys, lungs, intestines? Heart, gall, bones, blood? Emotions, perceptions, thoughts, reflections? If you can extract even one thing and truly recognize it as yours, then refine that thing you recognize as yours. Yet on closer reflection, all are illusory forms, unrelated to the true self. Not only are they unrelated, but these very things burden you, preventing you from becoming an immortal or a buddha. Now, cast all these aside and seek the one thing that is truly yours—the root of non-birth and non-death. Then longevity is yours, transcending the three realms is yours, soaring transformations—what is there that is not yours? Why then allow form-bound things to encumber the formless essence?\n\nAlas! The common run of people, busy and blind, believe they seek life, yet in truth they seek death—how pitiable! You, who neither crave glory nor profit, nor indulge in wine and sensuality, are truly fit for the Way. Yet if the moment has not arrived, if you remain mired in the surging red dust, gazing toward the clouds with no path to ascend, you are like a thousand-mile steed trapped beneath a salt cart—helpless. For now, rest your heart and await it. If you can dwell in the red dust while your heart abides in empty waves, ever seeing your nature and ceaselessly cultivating your body, then even if a fire-mountain blazes with ten-thousand-foot radiance, a single drop of nectar from your silver vase will extinguish its flames in an instant. This is true cultivation of the Way, true refinement of the elixir. The longer and deeper you persist, unwavering and tireless, the more surely will immortals descend to bestow upon you sacred texts and precious talismans, making you a teacher of immortals in this world. Strive on—do not dismiss my words as false.\n\nThose who refine the elixir must not hold the thought of \"refining the elixir\" in their hearts at all. Even if a golden elixir were to appear in your palm, and someone snatched it away, you would feel no concern, regard it as nothing special, and harbor no grudge—only then are you truly one who refines the elixir. The elixir is a sacred treasure, unlike pearls or jade—why then treat it as unworthy, even slighting it? Would this not be a grave error? Know this: if one who refines the elixir lacks this magnanimous heart, no matter how many years they refine, the elixir will never be achieved. Why? The elixir is the embodiment of emptiness; to grasp it with a mind of attachment is to lose the elixir.\n\nThus, before refining, act as if you have no desire to refine; after refining, act as if you possess no elixir. Ascending into pure emptiness, roaming the azure heavens, wandering amidst golden radiance and jade light, strolling beneath pearl palaces and jasper towers—you should feel as if you have seen nothing at all. Treat extraordinary realms as ordinary, and immortals as common folk; regard all as naturally belonging, like your daily clothes and meals, routine and familiar. This is the heroic spirit, the seed of a true immortal—what Mencius called \"the unmoving heart.\"\n\nConsider one who obtains a luminous pearl: if they see it as a mere pebble, then the pearl and I forget each other, the pearl rests in me, and I rest in the pearl—what joy! But if they treat it as a pearl, constantly caressing and remembering it, then the pearl becomes a burden. With burden, the heart is not empty; with an unempty heart, one turns from the Way.\n\nA man of Chu obtained a jade cup and treasured it above all. Fearing damage, he placed it in a casket, wrapped in brocade—one might call this careful safekeeping. Yet he would lift it to gaze, then put it back, only to take it out again. His eyes grew weary, his hands trembled, and in a moment of carelessness, he struck the casket and shattered the jade. So it is with the elixir: to regard it lightly is to truly cherish it; to see it as a rare treasure is to harm it.\n\nEven the firing times must be plain and ordinary—whether intentional or unintentional, neither forgetting nor forcing, letting it operate on its own. When the water arrives, the channel forms; when the firewood is ample, the meat softens. The talk of precise measurements and minute adjustments is enough to mislead. Those who boast of their own profundity spread such theories, confusing learners into believing that elixir-refining is the most difficult of tasks, known only to themselves! Alas, I have perused countless alchemical classics and diagrams, all claiming that the firing times must be secretly transmitted, passed from heart to heart—who would have known that the truth lies in the utterly commonplace and easy, the unremarkable and plain? Since you are devoted to the Way, I shall reveal this with a single word, passing it down to the world so that countless seekers may spare themselves needless effort. This is my great hidden merit and boundless salvation.\n\nBones stronger than flesh, the hun more potent than the po—though lean, no harm comes of it. The only concern is that the heart-fire burns too fiercely; when fire blazes, the blood dries. At midday, speak little and think less, close your eyes to nurture spirit, regulate your breath to cultivate qi. Let your body be like floating clouds, expanding and contracting at will. When things come to touch you, do not cling to them. Practice this long enough, and all illnesses will vanish, body and mind at ease. This is no difficult matter—it can be maintained in both movement and stillness.\n\nMaster Shao said:\n*\"In stillness, observing the myriad things, all is self-attained;\nThe joys of the four seasons are shared by all.\"*\nThese are the words of one who has gained insight into the Way. See how clear and luminous his mind is, how joyful! He is a living, vibrant immortal.\n\nFrom ancient times, those who ascended to the mysterious have taken a thousand years to enter the registers of immortality, or several lifetimes to tread the cloud paths. The least time required is a hundred years, or sixty or seventy; even the shortest takes thirty or forty, or ten or twenty, before a true immortal comes to guide them. Yet you hope for extraordinary encounters with a hundred days of effort—such a thing has never existed since ancient times! I make this pact with you: if you cultivate diligently without slackening, unwavering as a single day for three years, I promise that the conditions for your immortal destiny will align, and your ascent will have its steps. Take care and exert yourself—do not disappoint my hopes!\n\nThough essence, qi, and spirit are named as three, in truth they are one. When worldly attachments remain unsevered and distracting thoughts swirl, essence, qi, and spirit each go their separate ways to respond. But when the perfected one dwells in purity and sits in forgetfulness, how can essence, qi, and spirit be divided? The Supreme One speaks not of the elixir but of the Dao—there is good reason for this. When muddied, they appear as three; when clarified, they are one. The three are neither spirit, nor qi, nor essence; the one is spirit, is essence, is qi—whole and undivided, a single Supreme Ultimate, a grain of golden elixir. In movement, it contains all things; in stillness, it illumines the ten directions. It is the mechanism of utmost numinosity, the image of undividedness—its wonders cannot be fully expressed.\n\nIn speaking of the Way with you, I have been both profound and thorough. Knowing it is not difficult; practicing it is not easy. If you can delve deeply, grasp its essential meaning, harmonize it within your heart, and embody it in action, even if you do not immediately ascend in broad daylight, you will still be a realized person of the Way. Heavenly spirits will attend you, your Dao-body will be perfectly rounded, your spiritual root eternally wondrous—truly, you will be numbered among the immortals.\n\nThe essence of the Way is nothing more than emptiness. Emptiness contains the ten thousand images; though the world may be destroyed, emptiness is indestructible. As the *Daoist Canon* says: *\"When form and spirit are both wondrous, they merge with the true Dao.\"* The Dao is nothing else—it is emptiness alone. When form and spirit are both wondrous, they are both empty.\n\nIn all my teachings of the Way, from refining the heart to ascending in broad daylight, there is but this single thread—no other path allows one to depart in the morning and arrive by evening. Have you grasped this clearly?\n\nNature and life are like jade interlocking rings—inseparable. Yet those who cultivate the Way today, daunted by the difficulty of nature-work, begin with life-cultivation, busying themselves with the interplay of Kan and Li, water and fire. Though the embryo may form and the spirit emerge, if the roots of worldly dust are not scoured away and one does not directly transcend the leaky, then in the moments of ascension and transformation, there will still be some obstruction. The realm of pure emptiness and mysterious clarity will not permit a foothold. To roam the great emptiness, becoming one with it, will be difficult indeed.\n\nThe ability to sever birth and death, to escape the wheel of rebirth, comes entirely from the resolution of nature-work. If this is not thoroughly understood, even if the infant is nurtured to maturity, it remains a vulgar man, a stubborn child. Though it may rise halfway to the heavens, it may yet fall; or after thousands or tens of thousands of years, it may still descend. Why? Because it has not comprehended the character of emptiness—or even if it has, it has not truly attained emptiness.\n\nEven if one first practices life-cultivation and later turns to nature-study, the difficulty remains unresolved. When the yang-spirit first coalesces, the embryonic sac inevitably carries some impure qi. Without further wall-gazing practice, it may be hard to grind and wash it clean. Thus, those who begin with life-cultivation and later turn to nature seek quick results, but this burdens the child so that it cannot become a sacred infant.\n\nThose who proceed from nature to life engage in true learning: the heart must see the true heart, nature must see true nature, spirit must see true spirit, essence must see true essence, qi must see true qi. When nature and life are undivided, one gains both with a single effort. On the day the Way is accomplished, one will hold the rank of a celestial official, transcending the three realms, existing before heaven and earth, enduring after them. This is the true and certain teaching—no matter how flowery the words, they cannot escape these few sentences.\n\nI ask you: Are the Buddhist relics and the Daoist golden elixir the same or different?\n\nThe master said: Buddhism takes seeing nature as its foundation; essence and qi are not its primary concerns. All things arise and perish, but nature neither arises nor perishes.\n\nWhen the Buddha enters nirvana, this entity is indeed perfectly luminous, transcending the three realms, forever freed from the six paths of rebirth. The residual essence and qi coalesce into relics, which at times radiate light, now hidden, now manifest—such is the Buddha’s divine power. Yet once the Buddha has entered nirvana, the essence and qi left behind are insentient things. How then do they distinguish between concealment and revelation? Who emits the light?\n\nAlas, how can one say they are insentient! Yet neither can one say they are sentient! It is like a luminous pearl emitting light—who is the agent behind it? The pearl is born of the oyster, formed from the oyster’s vital essence. Once the pearl emerges from the oyster, it parts from the oyster’s spiritual nature, yet remains as luminous as the moon, for its essence and qi reside within it.\n\nThe essence, qi, and spirit of the human body are originally one, not two. Buddhism alone emphasizes illuminating the heart and perceiving nature, cultivating wisdom by extracting the radiance of spirit. The remaining essence and qi congeal into form, yet with all defilements extinguished and all knots dissolved, this essence becomes primordial essence, this qi becomes primordial qi. Though not as penetrating or universally illuminating as spirit, they remain numinous substances, hence their light appears and disappears, ever-changing in form. This is the principle behind it. The colors they manifest differ because the treasures of the world vary in hue, their brilliance shifting with their inherent qualities. Essence and qi are the treasures of the human body, which embodies the five phases, hence the five colors—thus the relics appear in different hues.\n\nExtending this reasoning, what Buddhism calls the unborn and undying is spirit, which is nature. The relics are essence and qi, which are life. They cultivate nature but not life, so after entering nirvana, spirit ascends to the void while essence and qi remain in the world. Our Daoist path, however, refines both nature and life, merging essence, qi, and spirit into a single pearl. Through the celestial fire’s alchemy, it gestates into a child as light as a wisp of cloud, as delicate as a maiden, identical to oneself—spirit resides within, essence resides within, qi resides within, indivisible and inseparable.\n\nSome may ask: Even those who cultivate immortality sometimes sit in transformation and produce relics. If they refine both nature and life, why do relics still appear? I reply: If relics appear, their cultivation must have been Buddhist, not Daoist—detailed in nature but neglectful of life. Those who refine both nature and life gather the essence, qi, and spirit of this body so completely that bones and blood dissolve, pores become empty, blood turns to white cream, the body becomes as fine as gossamer, red as the sun, hot as fire, coursing through the limbs and permeating the four extremities, illuminating the boundless and pristine realm. Thus they can ascend or descend, transform at will, and attain perfect freedom. Such is the difference between Buddhism and Daoism.\n\nYet in their essence, both share this: the nature-body is fundamentally empty, the six senses ever still. Unburdened by existence, they can illuminate existence with non-existence. The torch of wisdom knows no bounds, and true suchness remains eternally serene.\n\nIn elixir refinement, yin is exhausted and yang naturally appears; yang flourishes and yin naturally dissolves. The seven emotions and six desires of the human body are all rooted in yin. Uproot this root, and true yang emerges. All things are heavy in yin and light in yang, pure in yang and turbid in yin. The light and pure ascend, the heavy and turbid descend. Thus, when passions and desires rage, none can soar to the heavens. Yin is cold by nature, yang is hot. When the first yang stirs, the great earth returns to spring.\n\nHave you not observed the seasons? In the three months of winter, yang lies dormant, and heaven and earth are closed and obstructed. Modern people, their scheming hearts inwardly active, their essence dried and qi spent, live in perpetual winter—thus their pores wither, their skin wrinkles, no different from the withered scene of winter. When spring arrives, yang qi arises, and the myriad yin retreats in deference—hence the hundred flowers bloom, and the earth’s vitality moistens all. Likewise, when true yang resides within, white hair turns black again, fallen teeth regrow, the skin’s texture becomes fine and dense, lustrous as jade. The seasons of the human body differ in form but share the same principle.\n\nFor those whose passions and desires remain unsevered, their essence is yin essence, not yang essence; their qi is yin qi, not yang qi; their spirit is yin spirit, not yang spirit. Why is essence yin essence? The fire within the body, kindled by passions and desires, is yin fire. When essence is scorched by yin fire, the life-gate’s essence follows the fire and leaks away—thus yang essence is formless, while yin essence has substance. Why is qi yin qi? The qi dispersed throughout the body’s frame is all corpse qi. Yin is stagnant by nature, so when qi flows between the bones and joints, it suddenly becomes obstructed, giving rise to sores and ulcers. But true yang qi steams like fire and billows like clouds. Like fire, it disperses all poisons; like clouds, it unblocks all obstructions—how could sores or ulcers arise?\n\nWhy is spirit yin spirit? Spirit is inherently yang, but driven by the seven emotions and six desires, yin essence and yang qi are buried below, like a lump of charcoal placed in an ice cellar. Heat cannot overcome cold, yang cannot overcome yin, the noble cannot overcome the base. In short, when essence, qi, and spirit are of the primordial, each is yang; when they are of the acquired, each is yin.\n\nConfucius said: \"The Way divides into two: benevolence and its absence.\" **Scroll Three**\n\nThe Southern Polar Heavenly Palace, home of the Azure Radiance Supreme Emperor—who proclaimed the mysterious wind in the eras of Fuxi, Shennong, the Yellow Emperor, and Tang; who nurtured the Dao’s lineage through the ages of Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou; who now concealed himself in the pristine court of the Qing dynasty, now revealed his true form in renowned mountains and sacred grottoes; whose divine transformations were unfathomable, whose changes knew no end; who was originally the celestial Year Star, frolicking in the Peach Garden of Paradise; who served as an immortal official among mortals, jesting in the Golden Horse Gate; whose great compassion and great vows, utmost sageliness and utmost benevolence, allowed him to roam the world in leisure, delivering countless beings—this Most High Heavenly Worthy, Supreme Dao Ancestor, and Immortal Master bestows the register.\n\nRefining the elixir is refining nothing at all. Why say it refines nothing? It refines what is absent. Absence is emptiness. The heart is originally empty, yet emotions, perceptions, intentions, and knowledge fill it. Refining the heart to restore its original emptiness allows the elixir to form. Why so? The elixir is originally empty. Thus, when the heart is empty, the elixir may be achieved—from nothing, something is refined. How can something be refined from nothing? Consider: before my birth, I had no five senses, no four great elements, no personal form. Suddenly, a single thought sent me to seize a womb. What was this thought that seized the womb? Where there is spirit, qi naturally follows; where there is qi, essence naturally follows. Entering a womb, after ten months, a human form is complete. Emerging from the Mud Pill Palace, I could then move in and out of existence, ageless in the postnatal world. Had my heart not been empty—had emotions, perceptions, intentions, and knowledge remained scattered—I would still be a human form. Being human, how could I seek another human form? There is no such principle. A human body has but two ears, two eyes, one nose, one mouth, five viscera, six bowels, and four limbs—how could these be doubled? It is utterly impossible. Thus, refining the elixir requires returning the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, viscera, bowels, and limbs entirely to emptiness, as if never born—nothing remains but a single point of spirit-light, luminous and undimmed. Only then may the womb be formed anew, restoring my ears, eyes, mouth, nose, viscera, bowels, and limbs. A single yang spirit emerges—only myself, nothing doubled. Though the yang spirit departs, its ears, eyes, mouth, nose, viscera, bowels, and limbs remain fundamentally empty, never having possessed form. Thus, it may be neither born nor die, merging with the Dao in truth. The Way of elixir-refining is complete herein.\n\nThe study of the Dao takes non-action as its essence. Action arises from non-action, so even summoning wind and rain or uprooting mountains and halting rivers remains within the purview of non-action. Otherwise, every movement, every talisman, every register, failing to grasp the Dao’s origin, is but the trickery of lesser schools. Refine the elixir of non-action, practice the methods of non-action, recite the scriptures of non-action, chant the mantras of non-action: non-action is the body of Heaven, the origin of the Dao. To seek branches and leaves beyond non-action is to stray into heterodox byways. If you align with Heaven’s body and illuminate the Dao’s origin, what difficulty will you have in understanding the *Cavern Scriptures* or mastering all methods? I await your realization.\n\nNon-action is the body of the Dao. The elixir is what is done without doing. The sages of antiquity pitied those who could not attain non-action, so they taught elixir-refining, guiding them to seek action within non-action. Thus, yang is gathered from nothingness—within the indistinct and evanescent, primordial yang arises. Once yang is born, the womb is formed in nothingness. In the profound and obscure, the numinous womb takes shape. Once the womb is formed, the fire of non-action is applied, continuous yet unforced, ever wakeful yet unyielding. After ten months, the yang spirit emerges. Once the spirit emerges, it returns to nothingness. Within the radiance of purple qi, there is something yet not a thing, form yet not form, an image of no-image, a sound of no-sound. Why is this so? Such is the origin of the Dao.\n\nThere are three prohibitions in this practice.\n\nFirst, when gathering yang, movement must be avoided. As yang arises, the mind must be fused and concentrated—stillness gives birth to yang, while movement causes it to dissipate. Does yang have form? It takes form through the intent of the practitioner. Spirit transforms into qi; if the spirit is still, how could qi fail to arise? But the slightest movement halts intent, intent ceases, spirit is no longer continuous, and yang expires.\n\nSecond, when forming the elixir, stagnation must be avoided. After the union of yin and yang, swiftly direct the mind to guide that single grain of millet-like pearl back to the Yellow Court, sealing it within the crucible. The slightest delay causes the essence to age, rendering it unable to contain yin. When fire is applied, it becomes restless, and the womb may fail to form.\n\nThird, when applying the fire, violence must be avoided. Once yang is gathered and the womb is formed, the fire of ten months must be as steady as a single day, and the fire of a single day as steady as a single moment—this is pure fire. If the womb is refined in pure fire, it becomes indestructibly firm, enduring across eons, transcending heaven and earth, soaring freely. But if the mind wanders and a thought suddenly intrudes, leading to forced refinement, a restless and impatient qi arises. Even if one sits until breath returns to the origin, it remains violent fire, for it is self-interrupted and artificially imposed.\n\nFrom this, we see that elixir-refining is no easy matter. Only when one knows there is no fire can fire be applied; only when one realizes there is no yang can yang be gathered. Like the clear emptiness of the heavens—utterly devoid—yet through it, the seasons turn and beings arise, enduring for ages without cease.\n\nYou worry that your scholarly pursuits sustain you but prevent stillness. Yet awakening the mind and seeing one’s nature can be done in the present. I originally taught you to begin here. Refining the mind is half the work of becoming an immortal. Why not complete this half first, leaving the other half for the right moment? Why abandon the present for futile worries?\n\nSince you have already reduced desires, the great foundation is secured. From here, stabilize your spirit, quiet your thoughts, and in stillness, investigate and awaken. The mysterious gate stirs, ready to open.\n\nThe womb is formed through non-doing. Non-doing is the origin of the womb. Why? The Supreme Ultimate gives birth to heaven and earth naturally, unconsciously—what is clear ascends to become heaven, what is turbid descends to become earth. All unfolds freely, at ease, and thus heaven and earth are born. If the Supreme Ultimate were to overturn and invert at the moment of creation, yin and yang would reverse, the Five Phases would scatter, and before the world could form, the natural order would collapse—this would not be the body of the Dao.\n\nIf one understands how the Supreme Ultimate gives birth to heaven and earth, then when forming the elixir, one can make non-doing the very act. Yang should ascend, yin should descend—just as when the Supreme Ultimate gives birth to heaven, the clear rises, and when it gives birth to earth, the turbid sinks. Though heaven and earth are divided, the Supreme Ultimate remains undivided. Thus, yin and yang merge, forming the precious pearl, a state of primordial chaos—yet it is still one Supreme Ultimate. This is why the elixir is the elixir, why the womb is the womb.\n\nWhen the fire-timing is complete, the yang spirit emerges. Know that this yang spirit is the uncarved block of chaos, not something formed by the four elements and five phases. If it were formed by them, it would be the human body. And if it were the human body, it would possess cunning and knowledge. With cunning and knowledge, it could not be non-doing, and would be far from the Dao.\n\nThus, this yang spirit is the Supreme Ultimate itself. But if it is the Supreme Ultimate, why does it have form? I explain: This yang spirit is the first person of the primordial era—when heaven opened at *zi*, earth split at *chou*, and humanity arose at *yin*. It comprehends all things, its Dao sustains the world. It is incapable yet omnipotent, ignorant yet omniscient. It is uncarved jade, unhewn simplicity. Though it has form, it is truly the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate is the ancestor of the Dao.\n\nDoes the elixir have an ancestor? Know that the elixir takes the Great Void as its ancestor. The Great Void gives birth to spirit, spirit gives birth to qi, qi gives birth to essence. Spirit, qi, and essence share the same ancestor—the Great Void. Should they not resemble their ancestor? Yet how is it that not one of them is void? They are wayward children, unworthy descendants. How unfortunate for the Great Void to have such offspring!\n\nCan one return to the void? Yes. What is the way to return to the void? To be without thought and without action is to return to the void. Yet the root of non-action lies in non-thought. Why? One may sit in stillness all day, cutting off worldly affairs, appearing carefree—others may see a carefree immortal, a perfected being, a true companion of the Dao. But within their mind, thoughts churn endlessly, hiding countless illusions. A single thought spins the wheel of rebirth, planting seeds of boundless life and death.\n\nThus, while many can practice non-action, only the perfected can be without thought. Examine your own mind—can you truly be without thought? Not only can you not be without thought, you cannot even go a single moment without it. Since you cannot be without thought, when events arise, you are startled; when things stir, you are moved. Though you may wish to be without thought, it is impossible.\n\nYou are entangled in worldly ties, sustaining yourself through scholarship—how could you be without thought? Yet thoughts differ. There are proper thoughts and improper thoughts. The improper—whether for fame, wealth, sensual pleasures, or even the desire to become an immortal or a buddha—are not within one’s station. These are hopes, gambles, all of which must be utterly abandoned.\n\nKeep your focus unbroken and meticulous, engaging only in work that truly benefits yourself—learning that seeks nothing from others. How then could you fail to awaken to truth? How could you fail to enter sagehood? Never allowing a moment to pass in idleness, your mind will naturally find ease day by day, your will and qi like spirits. Cast aside the very terms \"immortal\" and \"buddha,\" for in truth, this is the very lineage of immortality and the root-source of buddhahood. The true immortal, the true buddha—these emerge from this path.\n\nMencius said: *\"Shun dwelled deep in the mountains, living among trees and rocks, roaming with deer and swine—yet how little he differed from the wild men of the mountains!\"* See how radiant his heart was! *\"When he heard a single good word or saw a single good deed, it was like the bursting of the Yangtze, irresistible and boundless.\"* See how swift his spiritual responsiveness was! This is what it truly means to refine oneself.\n\nIf one is willing to live as a wild man of the mountains without shame—unmoved by blows, unshaken by insults, appearing foolish and dull, like a simple child—then one is not far from the Dao! Yet is such a person truly foolish and dull? They possess great resolve and true learning; their capacity is like the rivers, which cannot be stirred to mud nor settled to clarity. Their conduct is like the pine and cypress, which neither flourish in spring nor wither in winter. Such a one is nearly a perfected person!\n\nAlas, where might I find such a person to discourse upon the Dao?\n\nYou dwell in desolate circumstances, with children before you—how bitter! You are constrained by your conditions. Yet if you forge a heart that advances without retreat, enduring trials of every kind, then you may shatter iron walls and pass through flames. Only then can the foundation for becoming an immortal or a buddha be firmly established, standing unshakable and at peace. Otherwise, what are immortality and buddhahood? Can they be trifled with by just anyone?\n\nGrit your teeth and steadfastly hold fast. This body may live or die, endure cold or hunger, yet your heart’s resolve toward the Dao must remain untouched by life and death, unmoved by cold and hunger. If your will is as unyielding as steel tempered a hundred times, can the countless lofty immortals in heaven truly be deaf and blind, failing to take notice? Such a thing is impossible.\n\nThus, your concern should be the firmness of your resolve, not the harshness of your circumstances. With true resolve, what situation cannot be endured? Even amidst blades and swords, iron beds and fiery pits, one may instantly become an immortal or a buddha—how much more so with plain fare and simple porridge, the common lot of the poor scholar?\n\nThe elixir is that primordial spark of true origin, present since the Great Beginning, only now perceived, grasped, and clearly recognized—hence it is called the elixir. It is like taking earth to form a pill: all sand and grit must be sifted away before it can be kneaded into a perfect sphere. The cultivator of the elixir must likewise sift away the seven emotions and six desires, leaving no dregs, so that the true origin shines like the autumn moon. Then, through the work of ascent and descent, the method of harmonization, a single grain of golden elixir—round and complete—takes form within the Central Yellow Palace of the Great One. There it is seen clearly, recognized clearly, and never lost.\n\nThe three superior medicines are spirit, qi, and essence. Spirit is the mother of qi and the ancestor of essence. A child does not abandon its mother, nor a grandchild its ancestor. Thus, in refining the elixir, when one concentrates the spirit, qi and essence naturally follow.\n\nThough the great medicine has three names, in truth it is one. When gathering yang, it is intention. At the moment of union, it is intention. When sealing and securing it within the Yellow Court, it is intention. Even through the ten months of firing, with ceaseless inner observation and constant reflection—what is this if not spirit? Postnatal intention is called *intention*; prenatal intention is called *spirit*. Where spirit abides, qi follows. Qi arises and subsides in dependence upon spirit.\n\nThus, during the formation of the embryo, stillness gives rise to yang; stillness settles the spirit; when the spirit is at peace, primordial essence blossoms and qi is born—this is how qi arises in dependence upon spirit. Through the ten months of firing, inner observation is fixed here, reflection is fixed here, and one’s primordial spirit is wholly concentrated here. Thus the five phases gather here, fetal breathing circulates here—this is how qi subsides in dependence upon spirit. Since the entire process relies upon a single spirit, after the embryo emerges, it is called the yang spirit. Great indeed is the function of spirit!\n\nThe elixir takes qi as its mother, spirit as its father, and essence as its child. Why is qi the mother? The elixir is formed from a single qi. Gathering yang is qi; the firing process is qi—like a mother giving birth to a child, whose form and viscera are all made from the mother’s essence and blood.\n\nWhy is spirit the father? Qi is born of spirit. Spirit cannot act alone but relies on qi for its function. Though qi is insubstantial, it has form; spirit is insubstantial and formless. The cultivator of the elixir first concentrates the spirit within qi, then forms the spiritual embryo—just as a father cannot conceive a child alone but must transmit his essence into the mother’s womb, where yin and yang unite to give birth to an infant.\n\nWhy is essence the child? Essence is the nourishment of the elixir, like water to a dragon. Though a dragon may soar and transform, without water its spirit cannot command its form, and it becomes no different from a lizard. Though the spiritual embryo is formed, without true essence to nurture it, it withers and becomes useless. Taking the meaning of a child who nourishes the old, essence is thus called the child.\n\nTherefore, the true cultivator must first achieve the threefold completeness, and from this threefold completeness attain the threefold perfection, before being permitted to practice the Dao and aspire to immortality.\n\nThe common worldly person often mistakes the essence of sexual union for yin essence, believing that the elixir’s formation requires none of this—even if wantonly expended, it does no harm. Yet they do not know that essence itself is neither yin nor yang; without desire, the essence within the body is all yang essence, while with desire, the essence within the body becomes all yin essence. Yang essence is formless; yin essence has substance—a single distinction between desire and its absence. The Classic states: *\"The three supreme medicines are spirit, qi, and essence.\"* Yet most people do not recognize the existence of essence, qi, and spirit; even if they do, they cannot employ them. Thus the sages instruct: These three—essence, qi, and spirit—are the supreme medicines for cultivating the elixir. They are not found outside but all reside within your own body.\n\nThose of superior root and capacity, once they know the Dao, diligently practice the secret seal. In utter chaos, in boundless obscurity—what is spirit, what is qi, what is essence? If you take it as spirit, qi and essence are present within it. If you take it as qi, spirit and essence are present within it. If you take it as essence, spirit and qi are present within it. Like sugar blended with honey, like flour kneaded into dough, before the five phases emerge, at the moment before Heaven and Earth divide, this is the ancestral elixir—Tai Ji.\n\nHere, with a spark of numinous awareness, one acts in stillness, coalescing it into a millet-grain pearl. Refined by the primordial qi of Tai Yi, after ten months, it emerges as the yang spirit. Yet the term *yang spirit* must not be narrowly confined to the human body. That which gives birth to Heaven is this yang spirit; that which gives birth to Earth is this yang spirit; that which gives birth to the sun, moon, and stars, to womb-born, egg-born, moisture-born, and transformation-born beings, to all that flies, swims, moves, or grows—all are this single yang spirit. How can the yang spirit generate so much? It is because Tai Ji *is* the yang spirit, and the yang spirit *is* Tai Ji. If you regard it as yang spirit, it cannot generate yang spirit; if you regard it as Tai Ji, there is nothing it does not generate. This is the supreme principle. Otherwise, how could the transformations of immortals be so unfathomable? Do they possess boundless skill? Know that it is not the immortals who act—it is Tai Ji that acts.\n\nThe elixir itself is formless yet never nonexistent; its divisions and unions are without origin, its transformations unfathomable. It may be dispersed to pervade the entire body or gathered to repose in a single aperture. With one transformation, it takes form; with another, it returns to emptiness. Neither ghosts nor spirits can fathom its mechanism; neither Heaven nor Earth can exhaust its wonders. *\"The spirit has no direction, and the Changes have no form\"*—does this not describe the divine elixir?\n\nThus there are the precelestial elixir and the postcelestial elixir. The precelestial elixir is none other than Tai Ji. Those born from it must be sages, for the qi of Tai Ji is pure, harmonious, and unadulterated. When the primordial chaos first stirs, numinous brilliance gathers there. Thus in the most ancient era, extraordinary sages abounded, establishing the patterns of things, creating rites and music—just as the elixir does. The postcelestial elixir, however, is turbid and floating. Once the primordial chaos scatters, numinous brilliance also declines. Thus people of the middle era are inferior to those of the most ancient, and those possessing the virtue of firmness, centrality, and uprightness are rare indeed.\n\nWhat, then, is the meaning of the precelestial elixir? It is the coalescence of the formless substance of the primordial beginning into an elixir, refined by the primordial qi of Tai Yi—this is what is called the precelestial elixir. There is no Dao greater than Tai Ji, and the elixir embodies it. Why? The elixir cannot be sought through names, objects, instruments, or numbers. Its nature is pure emptiness, profound mystery, and the primordial chaos as one qi—this is the essence of the Dao.\n\nShould one ask: *What is it about the elixir that embodies Tai Ji?* I would answer: The elixir’s embodiment of Tai Ji *is* Tai Ji. A single millet-grain pearl creates the world. From the most ancient times to the present, the yang spirit transforms daily, hourly, moment by moment. Yet those born within it grow accustomed and remain unaware. Alas, who is it that awakens and knows? Only those of profound wisdom, who exhaustively investigate its principles, come to understand what the elixir truly is. If you take it as nonaction, how then do Heaven and Earth divide? If you take it as action, how do Heaven and Earth return to primordial chaos? There must be something numinous within.\n\nThe human body, from the heart upward, is Qian; from the navel downward, is Kun. If Heaven’s qi does not descend and Earth’s qi does not ascend, the hexagram is *Pi* (*Stagnation*). The *Book of Changes* says: *\"Heaven and Earth do not unite, and the myriad things do not communicate. Male and female do not unite, and their aspirations differ.\"* Thus the person of the Dao uses the fire within Li to replenish the yin within Kan, and the water within Kan to nurture the yang within Li. The hexagram becomes *Tai* (*Peace*). The *Book of Changes* says: *\"Heaven and Earth unite, and the myriad things communicate. Male and female unite, and their aspirations harmonize.\"*\n\nYet where does this Dao reside? There is nothing better than calming the heart and practicing it. If the heart is calm, the spirit is at peace; if the spirit is at peace, essence and qi harmonize. When spirit is at peace and essence and qi harmonize, reaching a state where they cannot be divided, the foundation of the elixir is established. Yet though the foundation is laid, it remains an indeterminate body. Thus one employs the *having within nonbeing*, refining it into *nonbeing within having*. Within the state of seamless unity, one selects the most refined, blending them into nonbeing. The metal essence and wood liquid engage in battle, striking the nine-tiered chime and plucking the eight-wind zither. The sun and moon emerge from below the navel; wind and clouds arise from beneath the armpits. Round and luminous, red and radiant—it is still the same Tai Ji: pure emptiness, profound mystery, and the primordial chaos as one qi.\n\nWithin it are Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon; all that flies, swims, moves, or grows, all womb-born, egg-born, moisture-born, and transformation-born beings—nothing is lacking.\n\nWhen the numinous mechanism arrives, the myriad pipes resound in unison—primal oneness manifests its images, beyond all words. Laozi said: *\"Profound and again profound, the gateway of all wonders.\"* The elixir, wrought through nonaction, becomes numinous; wrought through action, it may not. Why is this? The elixir is the Dao of Heaven and Earth in its natural state. In the Dao of Heaven and Earth, where there is yin there must be yang, where there is water there must be fire, where there is closing there must be opening, where there is ascent there must be descent. That which makes the Dao the Dao—within the body, there is yin and yang, water and fire, closing and opening, ascent and descent. This is not forced; it arises of itself, without contrivance. Things each follow their kind, each finding its proper place, and thus the myriad beings are born. This is the unchanging Dao of kalpas past—how could I alter it? Unable to change it, I can only follow it.\n\nThe common folk of the world regard elixir-refining as seizing the power of creation, leaking the secrets of Heaven and Earth, unaware of where my mind dwells in this! I merely follow the Dao. You fear the lack of basis for gathering yang—yet yang arises according to its signs; follow its signs, and that is all. You fear the fire-timing is imprecise—yet fire’s arising has its time, its ceasing has its time; follow its time, and that is all. You fear true mercury will not arise—yet the heart is the central qi of the five viscera. When the central qi ascends, the qi of all viscera ascends with it; when it descends, the qi of all viscera descends with it. Mencius said: *\"The will is the commander of qi; qi is that which fills the body.\"* You establish its commander and follow its mandate, and that is all.\n\nRefining essence to return to qi, refining qi to return to spirit, refining spirit to return to emptiness—every step moves against the current, yet in elixir practice, every thought must follow the flow, every moment must follow the flow. Refining in reversal yet completing in compliance—this is the supreme essential secret of elixir-refining.\n\nSince the birth of Heaven and Earth from the Great Ultimate, all things with form and image, substance and nature, have grown day by day, month by month. Heaven and Earth suffer from the ceaselessness of generation, yet cannot but generate. The myriad beings bear Heaven and Earth’s grace, bathe in their blessings, yet do not know of Heaven and Earth’s suffering in generation. The primordial transformation of Heaven and Earth leaks without cease, flows without return—Heaven and Earth are exhausted. To seek from these exhausted Heaven and Earth that their generated beings share the Dao’s inexhaustibility is like grasping a chick too weak to match its hatchling peers and hoping for its mastery of archery—can this be reasonable?\n\nThen what is to be done by those of resolve who single-mindedly strive to learn the Dao? It is this: return my yin and yang to the state of primordial chaos, and elixir-refining becomes possible. Begin with nonaction, end with thoughtlessness—then Heaven is clear and tranquil above, Earth rests securely below. Then yin and yang blend into a pearl, gathered within the profound and again profound aperture. Inverting and reverting, in a state of vagueness and obscurity, a single furnace of creation, ten thousand measures of divine radiance. At this time, Heaven and Earth are exhausted, yet I am not wearied; Heaven and Earth scatter, yet I do not disperse. Heaven and Earth suffer from the ceaselessness of generation, yet I rest in the abundance of each breath’s renewal. Heaven and Earth, through countless eons, return to chaos; I, however, open and close in due measure, expand and contract as appropriate, now generating, now ceasing, now myriad, now one. In the end, I merge with the Great Void—how could Heaven and Earth compare?\n\nWhat is the elixir’s fundamental basis? It takes having no basis as its basis. Why say this? The elixir is the root of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad beings. Why is it the root of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad beings? The elixir is the Dao; the Dao is the body of emptiness and nothingness. Emptiness and nothingness cannot be named, so the sages forcefully name it the Dao. The empty gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the myriad; the myriad returns to the One; the One returns to the empty. How can the empty give birth to the One? This is the mechanism of transformation, beyond all words. Yet roughly speaking, it may be described: the empty has no form, no image—how can it give birth to that which has form and image? In essence, the One born of the Great Void is originally without form or image. Without form or image, it is of the same body as the Great Void—why then name it the One? It is said: the empty *is* the One. The body of the Great Void is without interruption, without admixture, utterly pure and perfectly refined—thus it is called the Great Void giving birth to the One.\n\nWhat is the meaning of \"the One gives birth to the myriad\"? The myriad, too, is the empty. Know that the Great Void is not a rigid body—precisely because it is without interruption or admixture, it is called \"forged into a single piece.\" Yet within this Great Void, those that obtain its qi become form, those that obtain its principle become nature. They can separate or unite, expand or contract, be square or round, move or rest—thus it is also called \"the empty space pulverized.\" Yet the Great Void ultimately has no form or image—how then can it produce these beings with form and image? It is not the Great Void that does this, but that which acts within the Great Void. If the Great Void had the intention to generate the myriad beings, the Great Void would have its end. Therefore, the elixir-refiner’s single grain of millet-pearl shares the same body as the Great Void—then within it, transformations arise endlessly. The Great Void acts through nonaction, and the myriad beings naturally flourish; the Great Void is without mind, and the myriad beings naturally grow.\n\nAh! Perfect indeed—nothing can surpass it!\n\nHow shall I praise it? I bestow upon it a single circle.\nYet a circle has boundaries, insufficient to liken the subtlety of this Dao—thus I still bestow upon it emptiness.\nYet emptiness suggests boundless dispersion, which may cause later elixir-refiners to doubt. Therefore, I have something to bestow: I bestow upon it a circle, and the circle in turn bestows upon it emptiness.\n\nIn elixir-refinement, nonbeing is the sovereign, being is the minister, water and fire are the assistants, and intention is the messenger.\nWhat is meant by \"nonbeing as sovereign\"? The three supreme medicines are each and all nonbeing. The seven-foot body becomes empty like a single crystal pearl, clinging to nothing. Only then do essence, qi, and spirit merge into one, vast and clear, undifferentiated and boundless—thus the foundation of the elixir is established.\nWhat is meant by \"being as minister\"? Within absolute nonbeing, the ten thousand beings are complete. To speak of \"no essence\" is yet to have essence; to speak of \"no qi\" is yet to have qi; to speak of \"no spirit\" is yet to have spirit. Like the age of primordial antiquity, when the people’s customs were harmonious, virtue and grace overflowed everywhere—one cannot grasp it by seeking a single name or form, yet rites, music, governance, and punishment are all brilliantly present.\nWhat is meant by \"water and fire as assistants\"? Water and fire are the medicinal substances. Water lies below and is raised upward; fire lies above and is drawn downward. This is like a ruler’s governance, balanced and even, without the ills of inner heaviness or outer lightness, or inner lightness or outer heaviness. The Jade Candle is harmonized, the Golden Bowl is full, the millet-grain pearl is complete, the ten thousand beings are perfected, the four seasons circulate, the eight winds are level, and the Three Powers are fully present. At this stage, the work is sixteen or seventeen parts complete.\nWhat is meant by \"intention as messenger\"? Who causes water to rise and fire to descend? Intention does. Before intention, there is no intention; after intention, there is no intention. Only the single, true intention remains in the center—through it, yang is gathered, the embryo is formed, the body is transcended, and the spirit emerges. Thus the method of elixir-refinement is exhausted.\nThe elixir is a thing of prior Heaven, not of posterior Heaven. If it were of posterior Heaven, it would be something fabricated by worldly eccentrics, a heterodox and external path.\nThe elixir is the Dao. The sages of antiquity, in their thousands of words, taught people only to devote themselves to the Dao. If one understands the natural Dao, one understands the natural elixir.\nWhen the Supreme Polarity generated Heaven and Earth, yang ascended to become Heaven, and yin descended to become Earth. Therefore, the elixir-refiner must know: before Heaven and Earth existed, what was the Supreme Polarity? The Supreme Polarity is the body of pure emptiness and nonaction. Before there were form, sound, qi, or number, there was that which was most numinous and supremely spiritual—the Supreme Polarity.\nWhy does the Supreme Polarity generate Heaven and Earth? It does not. Heaven and Earth receive its numinous qi: that which is vast and azure becomes Heaven, that which is solid and earthen becomes Earth. Yet the Supreme Polarity has never generated Heaven and Earth! If the Supreme Polarity were the cause of Heaven and Earth’s generation, then with Heaven and Earth’s birth, the Supreme Polarity would die.\nThe human heart is a single Supreme Polarity, the ancestor of the elixir. The cultivator of the mysterious, by condensing the heart’s single spark of numinous qi within the elixir chamber, allows spirit and qi to depend upon each other, gradually forming a shape. Over time, its transformations are limitless, and it may share the Supreme Polarity’s beginninglessness and endlessness.\nWhy? Because it is not a thing.\n\nHaving formed a shape yet not being a thing—what then is this thing in truth? Above Heaven and below Earth, such a thing has never existed. Because it is not a thing, it may be called the Dao. Because it is not a thing yet ultimately possesses form, it may be called the elixir. Nevertheless, it must be called the Supreme Polarity. The Supreme Polarity is that from which the Dao emerges.\n\nWhen a person is born, the navel comes first. The umbilical cord connects to the root of the embryo, externally linking to the mother’s womb, where a single spark of true primordial qi contains the principle of life—this is the true, true seed. From the Mud Pill Palace to the Bubbling Spring, the navel lies at the center of the body. From the Swallowtail to the external kidneys, the navel again resides in the middle. It is like Heaven being Mount Song, Earth being the Central Plains—the constellations of all heavens encircle it, the winds of the five directions pay homage to it, it embodies the fullness of the Five Phases, and stands at the convergence of the hundred bones. To place the crucible here is to be neither biased nor partial, neither above nor below—what could be more perfect? Because it occupies the central position, it is called the Yellow Court. *Yellow* is the color of the center, and *court* signifies the image of emptiness with capacity.\n\nThis is what Master Ziyang referred to as \"within the formed,\" and what the *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* calls \"this aperture, no ordinary aperture.\" \"Opening the door is called *Qian*; closing the door is called *Kun*.\" *Opening* occurs after intercourse, when the elixir is sent into the Yellow Court. The elixir’s body is supremely robust, possessing the virtue of yang hardness; when the crucible opens and the elixir descends within, it is called *Qian*. *Closing* occurs when the elixir has returned to the crucible, and one seals it with intention, as if shutting a door. At this time, tranquility is paramount, like the body of *Kun*.\n\n**Question:** What are the five qi?\n**Master:** The five qi are the qi of the five viscera. The qi resides within the qi cavity and flows among the five viscera—within the lungs it becomes metal qi, within the heart it becomes fire qi, within the liver it becomes wood qi, within the spleen it becomes earth qi, and within the kidneys it becomes water qi. These are called the qi of the Five Phases. In daily life, the qi circulates through the five viscera, each with its own waxing and waning. Excessive decline leads to illness, excessive flourishing leads to illness, and if blocked entirely, paralysis, madness, abscesses, and swellings arise.\n\nWhen a person reaches the state of \"breath returning to the origin,\" the qi within the qi cavity surges vigorously, ascending from the Tailbone Gate to penetrate the Mud Pill Palace, where it mirrors the marrow in the brain like a silver lamp. Descending to the Double Towers, it suffuses all the viscera, like a misty moon illuminating the Xiao and Dongting lakes, coalescing into a single millet-like pearl. Sent into the golden crucible of the Yellow Court, the embryo receives the complete qi of the Five Phases, so that later the yang spirit remains identical to the human body. If any qi is deficient, the yang spirit will lack that aspect and fail to become fully human.\n\nHowever, one must still the mind further and further, deepen the mystery layer upon layer, so that these five qi become primordial qi. Only then will the yang spirit born from them be a being of utmost numinosity and sageliness. If one mingles it with postnatal qi, the embryo may not form, or if formed, it will lack numinosity. To seek its penetration of the mysterious and attainment of the wondrous will be impossible.\n\nThe essentials of elixir refinement are nothing more nor less than the two words: *concentrating the spirit*. Where does one concentrate the spirit? At the moment of receiving life at birth. When does one concentrate the spirit? At the time of true breath returning to the origin.\n\nThe qi within the human body completes twelve circuits in a day, like the Dipper’s handle pointing to the twelve celestial markers. As it ascends, the qi of the five viscera all ascend; as it descends, the qi of the five viscera all descend. After descending, the five qi merge into one—this is what the elixir classics mean by \"metal and wood unite, nature and emotions become one.\" This is the moment.\n\nAs for the rising of mercury, it occurs precisely when true breath returns to the origin. The mercury within *Li* ascends together with the qi of the five viscera. Moreover, when lead reaches the spirit chamber, metal can generate water, and lead-metal naturally produces wood-fluid. The Metal Duke seeks the female, the Wood Mother seeks the male—this is the inevitable principle. Why doubt it?\n\nThe true realm of stillness practice is better verified through personal experience than transmitted by brush. Chan Buddhists take enlightenment as seeing nature; Daoists take returning to the origin as obtaining life. Only by seeing nature can one know life, which is why the study of nature precedes it. Obtaining life also enables one to know nature, so that when the embryo breath returns to the root, it naturally fuses and harmonizes with that single spark of numinous light. Nature and life seem to have a sequence, yet in truth, they have none. Only the perceptive and insightful can understand this.\n\n**Question:** How can the yang spirit divide into hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands?\n**Master:** The yang spirit is a mass of true qi coalesced. Where true qi flows, it is like sparks flying from an explosion—each spark retains the nature of fire. The elixir is the Supreme Polarity. The Supreme Polarity generates Heaven and Earth, humans and things, giving rise to countless forms and images. A single grain of the golden elixir is entirely a Supreme Polarity, so it can naturally generate countless beings. A single emaciated immortal can fill the cosmos.\n\nHowever, Heaven, Earth, humans, and things, once possessing form, must eventually decay. The yang spirit born of the great elixir, though it has form, is in truth formless. Thus, when divided, it can become ten thousand; when reunited, it is one. Yet if the yang spirit is formless, how can it eat? It is a mass of pure yang qi, like the summer or autumn sun—what cannot it melt?\n\nThen, if the yang spirit divides into further yang spirits, are their spiritual penetrations identical? Things with form, when divided, may differ. Thus, even the wise often give birth to dull-witted sons.\n\nThe yang spirit is spirit, with no other admixtures—its spiritual penetrations are naturally identical and undivided. Yet if the yang spirit scatters in all directions, east, west, south, and north, what then? It is said: this supremely numinous thing pervades heaven above and earth below, penetrating even the most minute; when the copper mountain collapses, the bell tolls; when the sword transforms into a dragon, it reunites. Even insentient things resonate thus—how could scattering be its true nature?\n\nQuestion: Does the elixir have form?\nThe master said: After their union, the whole body fuses and harmonizes, like the warmth of spring or the moment of waking from deep sleep, when the mind’s landscape is utterly clear. What is this union? It is spirit, it is essence, it is qi—yet neither essence nor qi nor spirit. It is called the Dao, seen as the elixir, conceived as the Supreme Polarity. After ten months, it becomes the yang spirit.\n\nIn sum, every aspect of elixir refinement is empty; a single grain of millet-pearl embodies the vastness of the Great Void. Ponder this, and you will grasp more than half.\n\nYou must understand the single word *dan* (elixir). *Dan* is the body, resembling the human form. *One* is the navel, resembling the human navel. The navel is *dan*, resembling the elixir within the navel. The elixir resembles the body, the body resembles the elixir.\n\nWhy does a single stroke resemble the navel? Why not a circle instead of a stroke? What is the meaning here? This single stroke is the same as Fuxi’s primordial line. Before the Eight Trigrams existed, Fuxi first drew this one stroke—just as, in the mother’s womb, before the five senses and four limbs take shape, the navel-wheel forms first, connected by the umbilical cord to the mother’s belly. The single stroke in the character *dan* carries this meaning. Thus, the embryo is not formed elsewhere but in the navel, for the navel is the root of human life. Elixir refinement is the establishment of life—where else but at the root of life should the elixir be formed?\n\nThe elixir, as a thing, possesses a spirit dwelling in the palace of profound mystery. Attain this spirit, and the elixir may be completed; fail to attain it, and the elixir cannot be measured by years. What is this spirit? It is the ancestral spirit of the elixir.\n\nWhen you first vow to cultivate the Dao, this spirit descends with the true qi of the Dipper’s handle to reside in your heart-mansion, harmonizing the substances of your entire being. It clears the mind’s terrain and purifies the qi-nature—all through the agency of this spirit.\n\nThis spirit abhors movement and loves stillness; it abhors fullness and loves emptiness. When stillness and emptiness reach their utmost, the spirit becomes numinous of itself. Once numinous, it naturally manifests great function, governing the spirit-kings of the five viscera and six bowels, gathering the five phases, uniting the ten thousand images—like a helmsman in a boat, turning with the bends and shifting with the shores, never meeting obstruction or difficulty.\n\nFor every fraction of effort you complete, the spirit guides you to the next; when you finish two parts, it leads you to the third. It entices and supports you at every turn, opening paths in myriad ways, until at nine or ten parts, your effort is complete—all through the power of this spirit.\n\nNow, offer two words as sustenance for this spirit. What are these two offerings? Stillness and emptiness.\n\nScroll Four\n\nAt the Southern Culmen’s Celestial Palace resides the Azure Radiance Supreme Emperor—through dust-ebbing kalpas, the compassionate father who shields all life; through ten thousand generations, the primal master of written teachings. With golden tones and jade resonance, he inaugurated true learning in the Eastern Continent; from lion throne and lotus dais, he expounded the Dharma and transmitted it in the Western Realm. The marvels of his divine transformations defy description; the workings of his transformations and movements show not the slightest trace. Seeming mad yet truly sagely, he dwells amid times of harmony and purity; though obscured, his glory is certain to manifest, beyond all considerations of advance or retreat, honor or disgrace. Vast in compassion, vast in vows, supremely sagely, supremely benevolent—through manifold expedient means, he liberates countless beings. The Most High Heavenly Worthy, the Supreme Dao Ancestor, the Immortal Master, bestows registers.\n\nSomeone asked: After attaining a body beyond the body, what further practice remains?\nThe Master replied: An excellent question. There are two paths in this Dao.\nFor those of the lower realm who cast off the body, the process is swift. For those of the upper realm who merge the entire being, the process is slow. Why is this so?\nOnce the yang spirit pierces the crown, it roams freely in the Great Void, carefree and joyous. In an instant, it soars ten thousand miles—upward, it can toy with the sun and moon, tread loftily upon clouds and mist; downward, it can wander among islands and isles, gazing upon scenic wonders. A thousand transformations, ten thousand changes—all follow the heart’s desire. Looking back at the illusory frame, it seems but a clod of dung, unworthy of retention. Thus, one sheds the bones in a desolate crag, abandons the form and flees afar—this is the way of those who cast off the body.\nBut if one of resolute aspiration seeks no quick results and willingly undertakes the slow, painstaking work, the yang spirit may emerge yet remains unemerged; the illusory frame may be discarded yet remains undiscarded. One single-mindedly preserves the primordial numen, subjecting it to a thousand fires and ten thousand refinements. The spirit is forgotten as the Great Void, yet refined with pure fire, transforming together with it—this is the way of those who merge the entire being.\nBoth paths are presented here; let each choose for themselves. Should those of aspiration not take the higher way as their model?\nThe questioner asked: Is this the same as or different from the practice of refining emptiness?\nThe Master replied: Refining emptiness is the work of supplementing what the heart’s cultivation has yet to attain. This practice is the work of supplementing what the qi’s refinement has yet to complete. If the heart’s refinement has already reached the point of utter nothingness, then after shedding the womb, one may proceed directly to this practice—how simple and direct! But those who prioritize life-cultivation over nature-cultivation may, when they reach the final stage, only be able to attend to nature and no longer to life. Those endowed with past-life wisdom merge the two as one—this too is wondrous.\nThe cultivator of truth embraces the Dao and abides in it, the spirit roaming in the Great Void. The Great Void has no so-called Dao; it is named as such because of people. People, too, have no so-called Dao. When the Dao is no longer the Dao, then there is a so-called Dao—but in reality, there is nothing there at all.\nAlas, whence comes the name of the Dao?\nWithin and beyond heaven and earth, all is the Great Void. With the existence of heaven and earth, the Dao’s flow through the Great Void becomes obstructed and congested. Thus, when heaven and earth perish, the Dao is complete.\nI and the Great Void are vast and uniformly empty. Yet because of form and appearance, we become separated from emptiness. Though the nine orifices allow flow and communication, my own Great Void is constricted and restless. Precisely because of this restlessness, it congeals into sentience and issues forth as desire, now joy and anger, now sorrow and delight—countless postures, endless artifices. With that single point of unimpeded numinous radiance, one sinks into flesh and blood, bound to suffer endless hardship and futility, reduced to mere tricks and contrivances.\nHaving sunk for so long, one gradually forgets the Void. Even after death, one remains deluded and unenlightened, falling into evil destinies, reborn again and again. To seek liberation—is this not difficult?\nYet if the body is such a hindrance, why do immortals strive for ascension in broad daylight?\nThe answer: This is a transformed body, not an ordinary one. The transformed body is no different from the Great Void. Refined by true fire, both form and substance are transformed. Thus, when it gathers, it becomes form; when it disperses, it becomes qi. In the interplay of gathering and dispersing, there is an inexplicable spontaneity.\nThe true cultivator, whether in sacred mountains and numinous grottoes or in bustling streets and narrow alleys, can refine the elixir. The body is hot as fire, the heart cold as ice, the qi flows like a spring, the spirit still as a mountain—this is what it means to attain the Dao and become an immortal. Such people I have long ceased to see.\nThe method of refining the form: empty the body and heart, relinquish all activity, and yield to the natural movement of the heavenly Dao. Over time, one transforms until no substance remains to be found.\nIgnorant monastic followers often mock our Daoist tradition as \"dragging corpses and carrying bones,\" peering at the sky through a tube—how could they be worthy of discussing the vastness of the celestial body? Little do they know that when our Daoist adepts refine and cultivate to the point of complete transformation of form and spirit, the vast Great Void is filled with purple light and mysterious qi, pervading the heights of heaven and the depths of earth. When luminous, it becomes the sun and moon; when sharp, it becomes thunder and lightning; when surging, it becomes wind; when moistening, it becomes rain. It responds to cries for help without fail, universally attuned. It grasps the pivot of great creation, serving as the parent of all beings. Is its achievement not radiant and magnificent? This is indeed the proper duty of the noble person.\nThe Great Luo Heaven is no place for mortal footsteps—it depends entirely on how one conceives of oneself.\nThe Most High liberates beings through the Dao, not through elixirs. Immortals liberate beings through elixirs, yet never apart from the Dao. Other minor practitioners boast of secret transmissions. Since ancient times, there has never been one who, by means of arts, could attain eternal life and liberation from all destinies. Prolonging life and averting illness—this may be possible in principle.\nAmong the ancient elixir classics, only the *Triple Concordance* is reliable; the rest are a mix of truth and falsehood. Yet even in the true, falsehood intrudes, and the true is no longer true.\n\nWhy then do those who cultivate the mysteries cling only to stale words on paper, seeking to wrest creation from the heavens? Blind throngs bustle about—seeing the Great Dao, they know it not; deceived by fraudulent elixir texts, they believe them instead. They cast aside luminous jade to treasure what is not treasure. This is why Master Yang lamented the sorrow of divergent paths!\n\nAlas! Across the vast expanse of past and present, countless heterodox schools of the mysteries are but empty fabrications, like drawing cakes to allay hunger. Those of true aspiration should cultivate the supreme Dao, taking the great worthies and sages as their teachers, and making the illumination of the mind and perception of inherent nature their aim. Affliction and enlightenment are not two realms; celestial palaces and earthly caves all reside within a single mind. By applying unbroken, ceaseless effort and treading the solid ground of self-cultivation, one may become an earth-traversing immortal in this world and ascend as an immortal official in the Jade Palace, with descendants dwelling forever in blessed lands. Is this not the grand completion, the great repose?\n\nAs for the method of refining the elixir: in stillness, there is no elixir yet the elixir exists; in movement, there is an elixir yet the elixir vanishes. Try stilling yourself for a moment—your spirit becomes serene, your qi profound. From this interdependence of spirit and qi, employ your true heart to issue true intention, and pound the wondrous essence into a supreme treasure, storing it in the cinnabar field. Thereafter, inwardly observe at all times, ceaselessly turn your gaze within. The celestial furnace blazes, the earth is gilded with gold; the Dipper pivots in its revolution, yin and yang invert. When merit is complete and the Dao perfected, the pure yang qi of utmost hardness steams the flesh and refines the bones, the dharma-body becomes gentle and warm, all seasons like spring. The sun crowns the head, day without night; creation dwells within the body, life without death. Dividing one into ten thousand, uniting ten thousand into one—this is called the perfected person, whose spirit and form are both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth.\n\nThe workings of immortals are not extraordinary. They practice the ordinary Dao, perform ordinary deeds, and are ordinary people. Confucius said: *\"The practice of common virtue, the caution of common words.\"* The immortals of heaven are but ordinary people of the world. My teaching to you has always been plain speech, nothing to astonish the world or shock the vulgar. Follow this path, and why fear the difficulty of ascending the immortal’s road, climbing the immortal’s ranks, holding immortal office, or receiving immortal emolument? Riding clouds and mounting cranes, emerging from being and entering non-being—this is the necessary path for the noble person. The family tradition of the Confucian—what is there to marvel at? Why do you doubt?\n\nThe discourse on elixir refinement, in the original teaching of the Most High, regards the cultivation of nature as paramount, with the restoration of life as secondary. The body of true constancy, perfect across kalpas without end, leaves even King Yama no foothold to act. Though he may give life or take it, he cannot grasp the boundless, fathomless Dao to give or take. As for the study of refining life, when the firing times are fulfilled, the entire body ascends in flight, soaring through the Great Clarity. Yet I ask you: what truly is the substance within your body? First, you must scour this substance clean, transcending birth and death, and only then may the very body itself transcend them. If the substance within remains unclean, the root of life and death remains firmly bound—like a fine house whose master refuses to sit in stillness, ever chasing outward, wandering through flowery lanes and willow-lined alleys, eyes roving and heart stirred. Should he depart even briefly, he may forget to return; the house, left unoccupied, must fall to ruin.\n\nThus, the study of refining nature begins with keeping the master within, turning the heart away from externals. The study of refining form is the master repairing the house. Ponder this carefully: which is light, which is heavy? Which comes first, which follows? The answer is self-evident without need of the wise.\n\nIn seated meditation, suspend this heart in the vast emptiness. Wait until the breath is harmonized and body and mind are settled, then gently gather it inward to illumine the original substance. If it is truly empty, utterly devoid of all, then at that moment you will spontaneously realize wondrous awakening. The ten directions of the world all enter into awakening, yet in truth there is nothing to awaken to. Awakening-nature neither arises nor ceases—this is true awakening. The original, single point of empty numinosity is perfectly round, perfectly wondrous: small as a hair’s tip, vast as Mount Sumeru. All things with form derive their form from it; all without form derive their formlessness from it. Heaven and earth, sun and moon, womb-born, egg-born, moisture-born, transformation-born—when there is being, they divide into the ten thousand; when there is non-being, they merge into one. What is there that cannot be accomplished?\n\nAll that is substantial must decay; only the insubstantial does not decay. The human body arises from the four great elements; at death, it returns to them. Only this empty yet numinous essence finds no place to return. If one speaks of returning to emptiness, emptiness is its original state. To take this emptiness and return it to that emptiness—when emptiness has no this or that, where is there to return? Precisely because emptiness has no return, it does not die. Emptiness is what does not die. Even the refinement of the elixir is emptiness. The so-called yang spirit is not the body composed of the four great elements—how could it be called non-empty? The yang spirit is precisely that which is empty yet numinous, a thing beyond depiction or molding. No hand that carves wind or engraves moonbeams can apply even a needle’s tip to it. Only the yang spirit distinctly casts a shadow of these three words: empty yet numinous.\n\nThus, Chan and the mysterious are separated by but a single gap—they cannot be called different, nor can they be called the same. Between sameness and difference, only the supremely wise can reach the ultimate. Those who study the Dao take forbearance as their foundation. Joy, anger, sorrow, and fear are not native to this heart; sweep them all away—what boundless joy! Yet the word \"forbearance\" is easily spoken but hard to practice. Who but the greatly courageous can achieve it? Who but one whose vast qi fills the space between heaven and earth can achieve it?\n\nSince you have resolved to enter this mysterious gate, you must hold yourself to great courage, bear the vast qi as your own, make ginger and cinnamon your heart, ice and iron your bones. Like true gold in fire, the more it is tested, the brighter it shines. As for the completion of Chan, the verification of the mind-ground—after awakening, you must await it with the power of stillness. The layperson differs from the renunciate. Why? The renunciate’s vision is of immortal scriptures, their dwelling a mountain chamber; even if they move daily, it is still daily stillness. The layperson, whether toiling to sustain life or rushing to attend to affairs, even if they rest daily, it is still daily movement. Without stealing moments of leisure amid busyness or seeking emptiness amid clamor, nature will not return to life, life will not unite with nature. Though one may speak of effortless soaring, to seek the return of true breath to the origin, the revelation of the original spirit, the earth covered in yellow sprouts, the sky filled with white snow—this will be difficult indeed.\n\nSince you have already vowed to enter my mysterious gate, you must undertake true and solid work, examining from your own fundamental source: have the roots and dust been completely purified? Is the mind’s substance perfectly luminous and round? Within the square inch of your heart and the seven-foot frame of your body, can you achieve utter emptiness—like a crystal pagoda or a beryl vase? If so, then seek stillness within stillness, redouble your resolve, steel your sinews, brace your belly, lie on a rope bed, sit on a rush mat. See as if not seeing, hear as if not hearing. Go and grope for the mysterious pass and wondrous aperture within, position the golden tripod and jade furnace, gather the original yang and true qi. Neither assist nor forget, growing day by day, month by month. Like a pearl in water’s depths or uncut jade in stone, the essence will naturally coalesce, radiance will naturally burst forth. Within a year and ten months, the infant will emerge from the numinous womb, and by this original yang qi, the crown of the head will be struck open.\n\nThis is the work of the heroic and great! I ask: in the methods of gathering, replenishing, withdrawing, and adding—must one follow the sequence strictly?\n\nThe Master said: This is the compassionate resolve of the sages and worthies to save the world, and so they had no choice but to establish many names and forms. If there be a person of superior wisdom who suddenly awakens to the Great Vehicle, able in the four postures of walking, standing, sitting, and lying to empty all things, constantly turning the light inward—then in half a year or ten months, when the fire-timing is ripe, the moon of inherent nature will naturally hang in the sky, and the original spirit will appear. Thus the sages and worthies further teach people to proceed directly to the upper pass, refining the spirit and returning to emptiness—this is the most wondrous of wondrous teachings.\n\nYet when one has long practiced stillness, the qi throughout the body cannot but circulate and ascend and descend, corresponding above to the degrees of the celestial revolution. Like the surging tide on the fifteenth night, it courses through the sinews and washes the marrow, shattering the bones to powder. The sages, fearing that learners might reach this state and become alarmed or maddened, thus ruining their work, out of great compassion established the various methods of gathering, replenishing, withdrawing, and adding, so that learners might first witness these processes and thus remain composed when the moment arrives, undisturbed by the circumstances. Though the winds and waves may churn the river, my boat turns with the rudder.\n\nI tell you in all truth: the essentials of elixir-refining do not lie here. Do you understand? Everyone speaks of refining the elixir and refining lead, yet who knows that the true elixir is not made of lead? Only when you find this elixir-seed within yourself will you realize that the elixir classics are all mistaken, a thousand times mistaken. Ah! Even what I have said is also within those thousandfold errors—you must glean from the wordless place.\n\nYour heart is full of fear, only because your quest for the Dao is not earnest, your seeing of inherent nature not true, and your faith in me not steadfast. If you vow to seek the Dao, you will truly undertake the work of seeing inherent nature. Believe every word your teacher transmits, believe half a word if only half is given. Since you have met a true teacher and received true instructions, what aversion or hesitation prevents you from acting?\n\nYour heart trembles, ever fearing that seeking the Dao may bring harm rather than benefit. When you think of stillness practice, doubt and dread arise together. With such timidity, you cannot be a loyal minister, nor a filial son, much less an immortal. Know this: inherent nature is your own nature, life is your own life—both are bestowed by Heaven. Does Heaven bestow them only for demons to seize them? Is there such a principle?\n\nMoreover, those who study the Dao relinquish both being and non-being, seeing this body as mere illusion. Though blades, saws, cauldrons, and caldrons may harm the body, they cannot destroy this luminous and empty essence. So long as this essence remains unbroken, even if in this life you are slain by demons, this luminous and empty thing—hard as gold, fierce as fire—will take on another human form and naturally fulfill your vow to attain the Dao and become an immortal.\n\nFurthermore, with a mind undisturbed, no demons will come; a single mind can withstand ten thousand demons, one truth can dissolve ten thousand illusions. What have I to fear? The sages and worthies of the upper realms cherish their disciples who inherit the Dharma and the Dao as if they were pearls and jade. Pearls and jade have their price, but a good disciple is priceless. From the very beginning, when you first set your mind to this, your name and native place were recorded in the celestial registers, and daily the sages and worthies descend to observe your merit and transgressions. If your resolve is true and your thought steadfast, the sages will rejoice beyond measure, protecting you from the void as a loving mother guards her infant—how could they abandon you to the ravages of fierce demons and evil ghosts, to their mockery and slaughter? There is no such principle.\n\nIf you have already set your heart on becoming a disciple of my Daoist gate, you must rouse great courage and make a great vow: to be a man who stands between heaven and earth, a hero who turns the cosmos—greatly reviving the mystic wind and broadly opening the Dharma precincts. Even if your body were trapped in a demon’s lair or your life hung in a demon’s den, you could still rely on your own numinous nature, radiating great light to illuminate the hidden depths, causing the demon horde to flee and the ghostly throng to vanish. How much more in times of peace, when high immortals are your companions—would a hero and great man ever harbor such timid and slack thoughts?\n\nThe student of the Dao closes the mouth to still the breath, opens the mouth to laugh—so great is their harmony and joy that their movements are one with Heaven. Day by day they dwell in the spring wind, hour by hour beneath the bright moon, and thus may ascend to join the lofty immortals and consort with the transcendent. But this is not something you can achieve.\n\nA man takes heaven and earth as his hut, lakes and seas as his robe—his cloud-like traces drift boundlessly, where does he not go? Why must he confine himself to one place? You are only encumbered because you have too many children, yet Pang the Layman’s entire household cultivated the Dao, and Zhang Zhihe floated his home upon the waters. When I think of the ancients, I truly find my heart in accord with theirs—their lofty winds are not far, their fragrant footsteps may yet be followed.\n\nFor those who attain the Dao, every place is a broad thoroughfare, every mountain a dwelling. Laozi rode his blue ox westward, Bodhidharma left India to come east. Step out the door, and the great road lies before you—what burden are wife and children? The skills you carry with you are your traveling provisions—what cause for concern?\n\nI have seen those who cultivated the Dao in ancient times: refining the heart’s numinosity, all wondrous principles arose from their own awakening, and their practice was intimate and full of savor, free from demonic obstructions. Later generations forgot this essential point, seeking every key from the teacher’s mouth. Then there are those blind teachers who put on airs, swearing oaths to Heaven and accepting others’ worship—yet what they transmit are but petty techniques. As for the Great Dao, they have not even glimpsed it. Error is passed on as error, delusion pursued as delusion; the blind lead the blind, the deaf gather to converse. How difficult for them to ascend to truth and enter sagehood! How lamentable!\n\nIf true immortals teach others, they transmit but a single oral instruction for refining the heart, enabling the disciple to advance step by step, layer by layer, all flowing subtly from the depths of their own heart. Should one of superior root and capacity encounter this, they will suddenly awaken, transcending into the Great Vehicle—wherever they turn their gaze, the celestial palace appears, and mountains, rivers, and the great earth become a world of golden radiance. Immortal companions and Daoist peers come and go without cease, until that moment when both form and spirit attain perfection, and even one’s own body and mind are no longer needed. Only then will they realize how the teachings of masters—mere clods of earth in comparison—had led them down a long and winding path, leaving them no choice but to follow.\n\nI speak not to deceive the world; only those of superior root and capacity will believe. Since your root and capacity are fine, I write this to show you.\n\nThe scholar of the Dao possesses a divine eye within the heart, seeing all between heaven and earth. Thus, when the ancient sages and worthies sought the Dao, they never pursued it outwardly. In stillness, they sought it within the One Heart, where nothing is lacking.\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao’s Nine-Cauldrons Divine Elixir was originally transmitted heart-to-heart, mind merging with mind, never spoken aloud or written in texts. If the Great Dao were to be passed down through words or writing, even if transmitted, it would lack intimacy, and practice would never proceed as desired.\n\nThus, the heart is the root of the myriad things, the convergence of the One Origin. To abandon the heart and seek elsewhere is like forsaking the root to chase the leaves.\n\nI have seen those in the world who cultivate the mysteries: once they learn a thing or two, they immediately assume the airs of a master, demanding others’ worship and accepting offerings. When I see this, I cannot help but cry, “What a sin!”\n\nThe great masters of antiquity, who have guided countless souls, merely taught people to clarify the heart and perceive their nature, to polish the mysterious pearl until its numinous light shines forth. From this, they naturally generate wondrous awakening, silently aligning with the true mechanism, their hearts resonating brightly with mine. Having awakened from within the heart, they grasp it intimately and practice it with ease. When they attain success, the myriad methods all return to emptiness, the One True embraces the ten thousand methods, and the wonder of forgetting words at the point of realization—how could this be pointed out by others, comprehended by others? Yet they clamor noisily, seeking it amid language and texts—is this not absurd?\n\nAlas! The world has long been without true masters! Yet those who discourse on the mysteries number nine in ten households, each claiming to have obtained the priceless pearl, full of self-importance, striking poses—is this not shameful? When I see them, I cannot help but cry, “What a sin!”\n\nAmong scholars of the Dao, there are those who achieve without knowing how they did so.\n\nHow can this be explained? When the numinous impulse arrives, one does not first conceive of it—suddenly, in an instant, one awakens into the subtle and wondrous gateway. Why is this so? Because one is endowed from past lives with a numinous constitution and a refined *qi*, thus enabling such attainment. My friend, you truly possess the innate quality of an immortal, yet your habitual tendencies run deep, greatly burdening your pursuit of the Dao. You must sweep them away at every moment. The ancient sages’ four words—\"curb anger, restrain desire\"—are indispensable. Harmonize with others in company, be magnanimous in fellowship, speak sparingly to cultivate virtue, and maintain constancy to settle the mind. When all evil habits are thoroughly cleansed, you become an immortal dwelling in the world.\n\nThe celestial immortals delight most in befriending kindred spirits, traveling and lodging together, exchanging verses and toasts, singing in call and response—no different from ordinary people. Yet because the world lacks those who share their aspirations and walk the same path, they remain secluded in the heavens or hidden in mountain forests, unwilling to emerge. If you can truly empty your heart and fill your belly, aligning your will with theirs, your hearts resonating as one, your words always in accord, they will surely hasten to your home, becoming your most intimate friend. Not only will you not part from them, but they will not part from you, ensuring your elixir is perfected and your conduct fulfilled, hand in hand ascending together—what joy could surpass this!\n\nThus, the search for immortality need not be sought externally; it lies entirely in examining one’s own heart. The Dao cannot be attained through words, nor grasped through knowledge. One must verify it through every affair, test it in every circumstance, accumulating merit and conduct. Then the celestial spirits will follow you, and not only will the elixir be perfected, but your methods will also become efficacious.\n\nTherefore, the superior practitioner embodies the Dao in their person. The middling practitioner seeks it in words. The inferior practitioner pursues it in techniques. Many study, but few succeed—truly, because the Dao is near yet sought afar.\n\nYou have renounced glory and wealth, willingly enduring poverty and hunger, seeking only this Way—this shows your resolve. Yet you have not engaged in steadfast practice. What is steadfast practice? As Confucius said: *\"Attack your own faults, not the faults of others\"*—this is steadfast practice. Evils manifest in deeds are easily seen, but those hidden in the heart are difficult to refine. Thus, the earnest student must, at every moment, examine their own heart. What does it mean to examine? It is to scrutinize whether the subtle recesses of one’s mind align with the Dao.\n\nWith every arising thought, whether deviant or upright, you will know it yourself. If it is a deviant thought, extinguish it immediately, like one who weeds a field, uprooting it entirely so it cannot sprout again. If it is an upright thought, expand and nurture it, growing it day by day. Mencius said: *\"All people have things they cannot bear; extend this to what they can bear, and it is benevolence. All people have things they will not do; extend this to what they will do, and it is righteousness.\"* From this, benevolence becomes inexhaustible, and righteousness knows no bounds. When benevolence and righteousness fill the heart and flow through the limbs, manifesting in deeds, influencing the present age, and enduring for posterity—what manner of person is this? Can they not be called an immortal, not be hailed as a bodhisattva? This is a true immortal, a living great bodhisattva.\n\nSince I became your teacher, we have spoken of the elixir and the Dao, expounding deeply and clearly. Yet I perceive that your heart has not yet fully arrived at this. The Great Dao is ordinary, fundamentally no different from what others possess. If one can practice it, reaching the summit, heaven and humanity respond—truly, this occurs in the space between breaths. Golden tablets and jade scrolls descend from the imperial court. Golden youths and jade maidens attend constantly, ready to be claimed. Why then do you abandon steadfast practice to yearn for distant and elusive realms? This is straying onto the wrong path. Though you seek the Dao, you grow more distant from it; though you seek immortality, you become further removed from it. Does this align with my original intent in coming to guide you?\n\nThe cultivator of truth, when encountering difficult circumstances, must ever subdue the heart and restrain the *qi*, accepting all with equanimity. In the mountain’s embrace, by the water’s edge, a thatched hut just large enough to kneel in, with nothing more than a gourd and a bamboo hat—this is all. Amidst the sighing wind and rain, no smoke rises from the hearth. The pines roar in ten thousand valleys, snow piles at the cave’s entrance. The Daoist’s tattered robe is threadbare, the meditation cushion soiled. Seated in lotus, serene in emptiness, they keep company with frostbitten cranes and cold monkeys—what a realm this is! The vulgar and common deem it unbearably austere, but to me, it is the Land of Ultimate Bliss, the Ocean of Tranquility.\n\nYou have coarse food to fill your stomach, rough cloth to cover your body. At night, a rattan bed and a quilted blanket allow you to lie down until dawn, free from worldly cares and mundane distractions—this is the modest fortune of a minor earthly immortal. Do you still find it insufficient?\n\nAs for the refinement of life, though the oral instructions have been transmitted, it still awaits the karmic conditions of immortality, and someone will come to guide you. Heaven hears the humble—it will not leave you to complete only half the journey.\n\nMy words end here. You should inscribe them in your spirit.\n\n[Disciple asks:] *\"May I inquire about the distinction between the yang spirit and the yin spirit?\"*\n\nThe master replied: *\"Yin and yang are originally without division. If one exits the spirit before yin is fully transformed, it is called a yin spirit. When it departs, if one sees a river of white light in the eyes, the spirit exits through the eyes. If one hears the sounds of bells, chimes, or reed pipes, the spirit exits through the ears. Because the yang *qi* is not yet robust, it cannot break through the Heavenly Pass and instead takes an alternate route, following its inclination.\"*\n\nOnce the spirit has departed, it too enjoys carefree delight, wandering through streets and alleys without restriction, crossing rivers and climbing mountains at will. Yet though it may assume form, it cannot divide its form; though it may speak, it cannot eat or drink; though it may roam the human world, it cannot soar or transform. When the summer sun blazes overhead, the yin spirit fears and flees it. Thus, though it bears the breeze of immortality, it has not yet left the realm of ghosts—how could it achieve the wondrous union of form and spirit, merging with the true Dao?\n\n[Disciple asks:] *\"Can a yin spirit be refined into a yang spirit?\"*\n\nThe master replied: *\"It can. Consider the potter or smith who crafts an imperfect vessel—if it leaks, they need not discard it. They may shatter the original vessel to dust, pour it into the mold, and recast it anew. For those who cultivate immortality, once the yin spirit has emerged, if they refuse to settle for minor attainment, they must resume their practice: shatter the yin spirit’s original form, cast it into the golden crucible and jade furnace, and rekindle the fire. After countless refinements, when the fire’s timing is perfect, yin will be exhausted and yang restored, and the true person will manifest.\"*\n\n[Disciple asks:] *\"How can the yin spirit’s original form be shattered?\"*\n\nThe master replied: *\"Forget the body, empty the mind, and in the vast emptiness, let no thing arise. Then one may exchange the mortal womb for a spiritual one, transform the common person into a true person—and the work is complete.\"* The ancients took things as they came and found peace.\n\nThough you dwell among venomous snakes and fierce beasts, treat them as kin, as brothers—how much more so with fellow humans? If you seek a place apart, it is only because your learning is shallow, your resolve weak, your tolerance narrow, your cultivation meager. At the sight of common folk, at the sound of vulgar words, your qi surges and your heart stirs, and you long for a secluded retreat, far from the crowd, to satisfy your wish. With such a disposition, where can you go that will suffice? You are mistaken, my disciple. A person of magnanimity, a person of true learning, would never behave thus. When others meet you with hostility, receive it with equanimity; when they come with anger, meet it with joy. The orchid grows amid the mugwort and reeds, yet does not separate itself from them—its fragrance unfolds of its own accord, and passersby turn to admire it. The crane stands among chickens and ducks, yet does not flaunt its grace—its bearing is effortlessly refined, and its aspirations soar beyond the clouds. The Dao-attainers of old often entered demonic realms, becoming kin to demons; yet through the influence of their virtue, even the demon kings bowed in reverence, and love and respect flowed toward them. If even fierce demons can be transformed and enlightened, what cause is there to fear mere humans?\n\nYou aspire to cultivate the Dao and embody the Perfected, to arouse the supreme bodhi vow—yet you squabble with women and girls over trivial matters, is this not the height of shame? As for whether to establish an altar or not, this is but a minor concern, not worth clinging to. Within the square inch of your own heart, there already exists a sacred altar. If you can sweep away the dust of old habits and kindle a censer of incense with the fire of primordial qi, I will descend into this very space, secretly imprint my transmission upon you, and bestow the esoteric teachings. What more could I ask of you?\n\n[Disciple asks:] *\"In stillness, why do so many visions appear?\"*\n\nThe master replied: *\"All things arise because we possess a body, and because we possess a mind. Thus, what arises from movement is called a *scene*, and what arises from stillness is called an *image*. What is a *scene*? It generally arises from the mind’s endless clinging and delusion, conjuring mirages like castles in the air—yet with a single moment of awakened awareness, it vanishes instantly. What is an *image*? Beginners, accustomed to the turmoil of daily life, sit upon their meditation cushions, and when the six senses grow quiet and the consciousness lies idle, their impatience with stillness gives rise to mischief: ghostly faces and monstrous forms appear before them. But if the heart remains unmoved, these too dissolve at once. This is the distinction between *scenes* and *images*.\n\nYet scenes are insubstantial and formless, while images are illusory yet take on substance. Why is this? Movement is yang, and yang is formless; stillness is yin, and yin takes form. Know this: the forms seen in stillness are but the shapes imagined in movement. Whether scenes or images, both are tricks of the consciousness. If cultivators of the Dao can, in the midst of daily activity, constantly raise the mirror of wisdom and keep the pearl of insight shining bright—awakening the moment a thought arises, extinguishing it the moment it is seen—then once extinguished, it will never arise again. When the consciousness is thus dissolved in movement, what phantom could appear before you in stillness, leaping about like a daytime ghost? When the true person manifests, the ten directions are forever free of demons—how could there be anything more joyous than this!\n\nYet people fear only the images in stillness, not realizing that the scenes in movement are far more terrifying! To be without self and without others, to embrace impartial vastness, to do unto others as you would not have done unto you—this is the Dao. The Most High forgets emotion, forgetting even the source of emotion. People, bound by the distinction between self and other, give rise to emotion; emotion gives rise to circumstances, circumstances to delusion, and delusion conjures countless castles in the air. In this, people are born, and in this, they die. The cause of birth and death lies in nothing else but this single thought of self and other. A spark of spirit lingers in the vast emptiness, watching the roots of human desire—love, pleasure, lust—and unknowingly stirred by them. Like a seed sprouting anew, the thought of birth and death arises. Once karmic conditions are bound, the fire of ignorance cannot be restrained; in an instant, one falls into the womb, ruled by yin and yang, the six senses activated, stumbling through life as if drunk, following the path without choice.\n\nThus, those who cultivate the truth must see through the illusions of the past, seek the real within the false, perceive the nature within emotion. Like one suddenly awakening from a deep dream, clarity shines forth. In that moment, karmic bonds are severed, and the path of birth and death is cut off. Yet this awakening is like turning over in the depths of the sea, rising through layer upon layer of waves to break the surface. With mind composed and thoughts settled, you look around— the other shore is not far, the realm of clarity and emptiness remains unchanged. Like a prodigal returning home, a traveler finding shelter, is this not bliss?\n\nI see the people of the world chasing illusions, lost in delusion—rarely does one, in the midst of a feverish dream, have a basin of cold water dashed upon their head, instantly dissolving the phantom bonds and illusory realms. Even when such moments occur, they often lack a true teacher, practicing blindly and fruitlessly, achieving nothing in the end. Birth and death ensnare people so—how can the heroic not take control, becoming a truly free person in this world?\n\nTo study the classics and expound the Dao, to discourse with a whisk in hand, to explore the profound and seek the hidden, to sit in meditation amid incense— to wander beyond the six directions to sacred mountains, to observe the winds of the eight corners unseen by others, to play the zither in jade forests and jeweled gardens, to cultivate herbs in palaces of immortality and fields of lingzhi. To ascend to the heavens, where the perfected assist the Celestial Emperor in the realm of true emptiness and wondrous existence, wielding the pivot of creation in the palace of the Supreme Non-Ultimate—engaging in affairs without toil, following the path without confusion. The vastness of heaven and earth lies at your fingertips, ever-present before you—what joy could surpass this?\"*\n\nAmong those who cultivate the mysteries, there are thousands of schools—yet of ten who advance by technique, nine will fall away. Only one in ten remains, refining the Three Primes and Five Qi, achieving the Seven Cycles and Nine Returns—this may be called orthodox. Yet among ten thousand, scarcely one or two can be found who truly seek to illuminate the Dao and penetrate the profound.\n\nAlas! All are misled by the notion of \"longevity.\" These two characters, \"longevity,\" have never been understood since ancient times. Before grasping the essence of longevity, they first glimpse its function. Thus, theories of Kan and Li, water and fire, the gathering of lead and refining of mercury proliferate in the world. The ignorant multitude, driven by a single deluded and greedy thought, seek to attain accomplishment—yet most abandon the path halfway. Even those who succeed merely extend their lifespan by a few hundred or thousand years, all bound to an inevitable end. To then proudly claim kinship with the Great Dao—is this not the height of shame?\n\nTrue longevity lies in recognizing that the wondrous essence of one’s original body is eternal, while the Four Elements and Five Aggregates are all subject to birth and death. Only this original, wondrous essence is beyond birth and death. Whoever attains this possesses the supreme elixir. From here, cultivation proceeds with both root and branch, tempering the immortal embryo through five or ten years of firing, nurturing it into a being of utmost divinity and sageliness, dissolving the accumulated habits of past lives—this is called \"refining the elixir,\" but in truth, it is the cultivation of the mind. Such is the essential teaching of the Most High on elixir-refining, yet none have ever made it plain. I now reveal it outright, that those who study elixir-refining may awaken—is this not fitting?\n\nThe study of nature and destiny is one, not two. If one truly perceives the essence of nature, one immediately establishes the root of destiny. When the embryo is fully formed after ten months and the yang spirit emerges through the crown, though this is called the work of destiny, it is in truth the complete fulfillment of one’s inherent nature—how can nature and destiny ever be separate?\n\nThe crux of cultivation, as taught by all sages and perfected beings, is ultimate quiescence. Those who study the Dao yet do not attain quiescence cannot transcend the kalpas. Yet there is a distinction between immortals and buddhas, found in the difference between refining nature and refining qi.\n\nThe Buddhist path emphasizes refining nature, where the luminous spirit shines alone, utterly transcending the roots and dust—this is called \"nature’s longevity.\" The Daoist path emphasizes refining qi, forging a body of pure yang, where the golden light pervades the dharma-realm, self-originating—this is called \"qi’s longevity.\" Yet when one ultimately reaches the supreme source, even qi is nature, and longevity is quiescence. Why? If this qi were the qi of yin-yang and the Five Phases, a thing of form and substance, it would be born as such and die as such—by this, one becomes human, and by this, one becomes ghost.\n\nBut the qi refined by immortals transcends the Five Phases. In brief, it is the primordial, undifferentiated luminous essence pervading the Great Harmony, the most authentic of substances—yet in truth, it is no-thing. If it is no-thing, what kalpa remains to be transcended?\n\nYet those who study immortality vainly speculate, imagining immortals as beings who enjoy blessings and pleasures, a class of carefree individuals. But where there is fortune to enjoy, there is sin to suffer; where there is joy, there is sorrow. These are the complementary principles of increase and decrease, the mutuality of opposites. The world’s foolishness in holding such views is no different from the three deluded minds of greed, hatred, and ignorance. To study the Dao with such notions is to be far from the Dao indeed.\n\nThe Southern Pole Celestial Palace, home of the Azure Radiance Supreme Emperor—\nwhere the primal qi of Wood Lord divides, where the Golden Mother’s neighbor dwells;\nwhere play unfolds along the shores of the vast sea, where spirit rests atop Kunlun’s peak;\nrescuing sentient beings from the kalpas of flood, fire, and blade,\nrestraining demonic hordes amid the disasters of the Nine Suns and Hundred Six;\ndescending suddenly to the human realm, manifesting as a divine saint in one region;\nreturning swiftly to the heavens, dissolving into ten thousand miles of auspicious light.\nIn the golden crucible, the elixir of creation is forged—\nthe lower medicine heals the form, the upper medicine heals the spirit and qi.\nOn the jade stele, the script of immortality is carved—\nthe numinous formula liberates the world, the wondrous formula directly liberates the immortals.\nVast and nameless, beyond conception;\nmajestic and supreme in virtue, beyond description.\nGreat compassion, great vow—\nmost sacred, most benevolent.\nSilently revolving, subtly operating,\nliberating boundless beings—\nthe Most High Heavenly Worthy, the Supreme Dao Ancestor, the Immortal Master, bestows the register.\n\nAwakening Inquiry asked: *How may one see the heart-mind?*\nThe Master replied: *If you wish to see the heart-mind, seek it in the state of stillness and concentration. In stillness, let go of all conditions, like the bright sun in the sky, unobscured by any hindrance. At this moment, no knowing arises, no awareness stirs—yet from this knowing, from this awareness, the true original essence of the heart-mind is revealed. If you take the absence of knowing and awareness as the heart-mind’s essence, you fall into dead emptiness. If you take the presence of knowing and awareness as the heart-mind’s essence, you cling to the illusions of past dust—both are mistaken. Seek the place of knowing and awareness within the state of no-knowing and no-awareness: this is what is meant by the Great Ultimate’s foundation.*\n\n*But when knowing and awareness have not yet arisen, where does this heart-mind abide?*\nMencius said: *\"In all discussions of human nature, it is the ‘old’ that matters. The ‘old’ takes advantage as its root.\"* When knowing and awareness have not yet arisen, you do not know where the heart-mind resides. Try sitting in stillness until you reach the state of suchness and immovability. If someone suddenly calls your name, you will instantly respond, *\"Here.\"* Who is it that responds? You will say: *\"The mouth responds.\"* But who is it that answers? This is the true original essence of your heart-mind. From this, we infer that when knowing and awareness do not arise, the heart-mind is surely present. Without deliberation, it responds at once to the call—this is what Mencius meant by the *\"old\"* and the *\"advantage.\"*\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: *\"Still and unmoving, yet when stimulated, it penetrates all causes under heaven.\"* This is the meaning.\n\nAwakening Inquiry asked: *When knowing and awareness arise in profusion, where does the true essence of the heart-mind reside?*\nThe Master replied: *Previously, you asked where the heart-mind abides when knowing and awareness do not arise. I instructed you to sit in stillness, utterly devoid of knowing and awareness. If someone suddenly calls your name, you will instantly respond, \"Here\"—this is the true original essence of the heart-mind. Now, I will use this same principle to point out the heart-mind’s essence when knowing and awareness arise in profusion. When you sit in stillness and the mind is disturbed by external objects, myriad defilements swirl chaotically in your breast—if someone suddenly calls your name, you will instantly respond, \"Here.\" At the moment of this response, all the previous defilements are cast aside. Endless entanglements, like vines and creeping grasses, severed by the sword of wisdom, illuminated by the light of knowing—suddenly, with a single call and a single response, emotions and perceptions are cut off, roots and attachments dissolve, and the originally luminous essence of your heart-mind is lifted forth from the void in that instant of response.*\n\n*From this, we observe: when knowing and awareness do not arise, all realms vanish—yet at the call, the response is immediate, the one true nature abides in itself. Only then do we know the heart-mind does not perish with the realms. When knowing and awareness arise in profusion, all realms manifest—yet at the call and response, the true original essence is revealed. Only then do we know this heart-mind does not arise with the realms. This is what is meant by neither arising nor ceasing. If you can suddenly awaken to this, you may resolve the matter of life and death. This is where you originally were before your parents were born. After your parents gave birth to you, you were originally present throughout the three thousand great thousand worlds.*\n\nBefore the words were finished, someone clapped and laughed, saying: *If you say you were originally here before your parents were born, try calling you before you were born—could you have responded?*\nThe Master replied: *Why would I not respond? Though I had no form, whom would you call? If you call emptiness, emptiness must answer. If emptiness does not answer, then the answer is not empty. Thus, the non-answer is called the empty answer—who says I do not respond?*\nThe laughter continued: *If you say that after being born you were originally present throughout the three thousand great thousand worlds, then when someone calls you, the three thousand great thousand worlds all respond together—why is it only you who answers?*\nThe Master replied: *Who says the three thousand great thousand worlds do not all respond together? If you insist that only I respond, then there is no sound beyond me. Know this: my single response is the simultaneous response of the three thousand great thousand worlds. Do not seek it through form—if you seek through form, you will be obstructed.*\n\n*It is like obtaining fire from wood. If you cling to the idea that this fire comes from this wood, then only this wood has fire, and all other wood has none. Even if there is fire, it must be a different fire for each piece of wood, not the fire of all wood. Each fire must have its own nature, not the nature of all fire. But know this: the fire of one piece of wood is the fire of all wood; the nature of one fire is the nature of all fire. Spanning heaven and earth, enduring through past and present—one fire, one nature. Thus, the Tathāgata, in the tip of a single hair, can fully contain the lands of the ten directions.*\n\n*How wondrous! How wondrous! Thus it is! Thus it is!*\n\nSomeone else asked: *If the essence of the heart-mind is fundamentally empty, not a single thing existing within it—then from where do joy, anger, sorrow, and delight arise?*\n\nIf these emotions were fundamentally nonexistent, then upon encountering circumstances, they could not arise in response. Yet since they do arise in response, joy, anger, sorrow, and delight clearly do not come from without.\n\nI replied: Joy, anger, sorrow, and delight do not arise without encountering circumstances—thus we know they are the heart-mind stirred by encounter. If one claims the heart-mind inherently possesses joy, anger, sorrow, and delight, then one should feel joy without seeing what is joyful, anger without seeing what is angering, sorrow without seeing what is sorrowful, and delight without seeing what is delightful. Were someone to suddenly feel joy, anger, sorrow, or delight without cause, others would surely mock them as mad or possessed. Why? Because the human heart-mind inherently possesses no joy, anger, sorrow, or delight. From this we infer: one must see what is joyful before feeling joy, see what is angering before feeling anger, see what is sorrowful before feeling sorrow, and see what is delightful before feeling delight—only after perceiving something does the heart-mind respond. Is this not the heart-mind stirred by encounter?\n\nAnother asked: If the heart-mind’s essence inherently lacks joy, anger, sorrow, and delight, how then does the *Doctrine of the Mean* speak of “expression that always hits the mark as harmony”?\n\nI replied: The heart-mind is a numinous thing—when it encounters circumstances, it responds naturally and perfectly, without contrivance, hence called harmony. As the *Book of Changes* says: “Abiding in stillness, unmoving; when stimulated, it penetrates all things under heaven.” Abiding in stillness, unmoving—this is the unmanifest center. When stimulated, it penetrates—this is harmony that hits the mark. The sages who composed the *Changes* chose the word *stimulated* most wisely: only after stimulation does one know the heart-mind inherently possesses no joy, anger, sorrow, or delight.\n\nAnother said: Master, you claim joy, anger, sorrow, and delight arise upon encountering circumstances—does this not prove they are inherently present in the heart-mind?\n\nI replied: The heart-mind’s essence is fundamentally empty of things. If the heart-mind contained things, it would itself be a thing—how could one thing respond to ten thousand things? All joy, anger, sorrow, and delight arise when external circumstances stimulate the heart-mind. Only because the heart-mind is most numinous does it penetrate upon stimulation; after stimulation, it returns to emptiness. If one claims the heart-mind inherently contains the roots of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight, then at this very moment, examine your own heart-mind: where is joy? Where is anger? Where is sorrow? Where is delight? If these roots existed, then when joy, anger, sorrow, and delight are absent, one should still be able to find them. Yet at this moment, you cannot force yourself to feel joy, anger, sorrow, or delight—thus we know the heart-mind is pure emptiness, containing not a single thing. Precisely because it is empty, it is supremely numinous; when circumstances come to stimulate it, the heart-mind responds accordingly. Thus Mencius said: “When one suddenly sees a child about to fall into a well, one feels alarm and compassion.” At that moment of seeing, the heart of alarm and compassion arises simultaneously with the sight. Before seeing, this heart-mind is empty as space. After seeing, it vanishes again. Only at the moment of sudden seeing does this alarm and compassion arise—one knows not from where, like the bursting of a river, overwhelming and unstoppable. If this alarm and compassion were prearranged, then before seeing, why was the heart-mind empty as space? After seeing, why did it vanish? And when one sees again later, this alarm and compassion arises once more with the sight, then vanishes again—vanishing, then arising, arising, then vanishing. Does this heart-mind contain anything? No—it is emptiness at its extreme, numinosity at its peak. Only because it is empty and numinous can it respond to stimulation, then return to emptiness after responding. In our Daoist teaching, the “mysterious pass” is half-understood here.\n\nSomeone suddenly seeing a child fall into a well feels alarm and compassion—this arises with the sight. Likewise, seeing wealth may suddenly stir a thieving heart, seeing beauty may suddenly arouse lustful thoughts. These lustful and thieving impulses also arise with the circumstances—how then to distinguish them? Know this: when a thought arises in perfect fullness, it is the heart-mind’s true essence. The slightest deficiency makes it a deluded heart-mind. When one suddenly sees a child fall into a well, this alarm and compassion is utterly genuine, flowing freely and without restraint—fierce and blazing like the summer sun or autumn light, piercing and mournful like a sorrowful wind or bitter rain. It is no more or less than the great bodhisattva’s compassionate heart of saving suffering beings—is this not the heart-mind’s true essence? But when one sees wealth and stirs a thieving heart, or sees beauty and arouses lust, though these impulses may also arise with the circumstances, they are ultimately one’s own unwholesome thoughts—unfit to be known by Heaven, unfit to be spoken to others, longed for yet not dared to act upon, abandoned yet not immediately let go. Compared to that alarm and compassion, they are not perfectly full. Yet when one later repents and realizes these lustful and thieving thoughts can never be fulfilled, they melt away like snow and ice. At that moment of melting, this true heart is again perfectly full—you could then step onto a lotus pedestal and preach the Dharma to the multitude. A single spark of numinous light flickers and shines, bright and clear, illuminating the three-thousandfold great-thousand world. Thus it is said: when a thought arises in perfect fullness, it is the heart-mind’s true essence; the slightest deficiency makes it a deluded thought. This is why Mencius spoke of the inherent goodness of human nature.\n\nAnother asked: Master, you say joy, anger, sorrow, and delight all arise when external circumstances stimulate the heart-mind. Yet when one suddenly sees a child fall into a well, is this not also an external circumstance? And Mencius calls this alarm and compassion the “sprout of benevolence.” From this we see: benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are all the heart-mind stirred by encounter—inherently not present in the heart-mind. Yet Mencius says, “Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are rooted in the heart-mind,” and Confucians always claim that our nature inherently possesses benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom. How do you explain this?\n\nI replied: When Confucians speak of human nature, they generally use it to investigate principles and trace them to their source, hence saying they are “rooted in the heart-mind.” Yet if we discuss the substance of the heart-mind, it is originally without any thing—when utterly still and unmoving, it is no different from the great emptiness. Could one say the great emptiness contains benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom?\n\nSomeone countered: Heaven and earth giving life to things is called benevolence; the four seasons alternating is called righteousness; their coming and going in order is called propriety; distinguishing the myriad things is called wisdom. How can one say the great emptiness lacks benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom?\n\nI replied: These are the movements of qi-transformation flowing through the great emptiness. Qi-transformation flows within the great emptiness, but one cannot say qi-transformation *is* the great emptiness.\n\nAnother said: If qi-transformation exists within the great emptiness, then the human heart-mind naturally possesses benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom. Since qi-transformation flows within the great emptiness, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom operate within the human heart-mind—these are originally the same.\n\nI replied: This is speaking only of the latter part. Before qi-transformation ever existed, was there not still the great emptiness? The primordial true origin, void and quiescent, remained unchanged.\n\nAnother asked: Then is the theory of being “rooted in the heart-mind” incorrect?\n\nI replied: It is not incorrect. From the Supreme Ultimate onward, the great transformation daily tends toward life. Life is benevolence. Once there is benevolence, there must also be righteousness, propriety, and wisdom. Humans are born of benevolence, so the heart-mind reflects it—stirred by encounter, it arises. Tracing it thus, we arrive at the theory of being rooted in the heart-mind. Yet if we push inquiry to the very tip of the hundred-foot pole, even the word “heart-mind” cannot be spoken—how much less benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom? Thus, when Confucians discuss heart-mind and nature, they speak only of the latter half; Daoists discuss heart-mind and nature beginning from the first half. If joy, anger, sorrow, and delight all arise in accordance with the mean, this is benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom. But if there is the slightest deviation, it is human desire—hence one cannot call it “rooted in the heart-mind.”\n\nAfter the Supreme Ultimate, following the one stillness, the great transformation daily tends toward movement. Movement is rooted in stillness. Confucians speak of the intersection of movement and stillness in undifferentiated terms, hence the theory that benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are rooted in the heart-mind. Daoists trace things to their origin and end: to trace to the origin, one must exhaust the stillness before movement begins; to trace to the end, one must exhaust the movement after stillness concludes. This is the difference between Confucian and Daoist doctrines.\n\nYet the sages—Fuxi, Shennong, the Yellow Emperor, Yao, Shun, Yu, King Wen, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius—never failed to speak of this, though people did not perceive it. Daoists call it “emptiness”; Buddhists call it “void.” The void sees all, hears all. For example, when a thought arises, two people face each other—this one does not know that one, that one does not know this one, because of the barrier of physical form. The void has no barrier. The void is originally boundless and infinite, so when a person has a thought, those in the same room do not know it, yet the boundless and infinite void knows it. The *Book of Documents* says: “Heaven sees through the eyes of the people; Heaven hears through the ears of the people.” How do the people’s seeing and hearing reach Heaven? Because Heaven is void. Confucians’ caution in solitude is fear of the void. When petty people in private commit evil, the noble person sees their very lungs and liver—because the noble person’s heart-mind is void. Great indeed is the function of the void!\n\nSomeone asked: The void of my heart-mind and the void of the great emptiness differ in size. How can they see and hear all things?\n\nI replied: All things have duality; only the void is without duality. If the void of my heart-mind differs from the void of the great emptiness, then the void in a jar differs from the void in the air, the void in a room differs from the void in the courtyard, the void in the courtyard differs from the void above the roof—and within the world, there would be hundreds of millions of voids, unable to be compared or regarded as one. Consider: does the void have form? Does it have appearance? If the void had form and appearance, then the form of this void could not match the form of that void, the appearance of that void could not match the appearance of this void—one could truly say the void differs. But the void has no shores, no limits. All things have boundaries; only the void has no boundaries. All things have differences; only the void has no differences. All things have barriers; only the void has no barriers. All things have divisions; only the void has no divisions. Vast and boundless, round and full, within the one great void, a numinous light connects and permeates all. The void sees the tiniest hair; the void hears the buzzing of a fly or gnat—just as in a person’s body, blood and qi flow unimpeded, spirit harmonizes, and one feels the bite of a louse or the sting of a mosquito. How is the voidness of the void different from this? If you can dispel being and return to non-being, merging into the one void of the nature-sea, then the void of my heart-mind and the void of the great emptiness are like a wildfire and a household lamp—one and not two. If you speak of two voids, they are certainly not void. If it is true void, there is absolutely no duality. Test this by emptying yourself, and you will verify my words.\n\nThe Dao is one—unchanging yet ever-constant. After the Supreme Ultimate divides, at the beginning it is this moment, at the end it is this moment; at the beginning it is this thing, at the end it is this thing. From one world to ten thousand worlds, all is this moment, all is this thing—never the slightest change or loss of constancy. This is why the Dao is called the Dao.\n\nThe substance of the human heart-mind is originally unchanging and constant. That it changes and loses constancy is due to deluded thoughts and defiling dust—not the heart-mind itself.\n\nIf the heart-mind admits separation and union, duration and transience, should the Way of Heaven then be viewed in the same light? To know the Way of Heaven is to know the human heart-mind.\n\nYet in this world of birth and death, from beginning to end, men are ever deluded by wandering thoughts and defiling dust—when have they ever possessed a single moment of their true heart-mind? If one can perceive but a single moment of this heart-mind as one’s true heart-mind, then for an entire lifetime, for all ages across ten thousand kalpas, it remains this very heart-mind, no different in the least.\n\nThus, when a man is born, it is wandering thoughts and defiling dust that give rise to birth—his heart-mind is never born. When a man dies, it is wandering thoughts and defiling dust that bring about death—his heart-mind never dies. When a man passes through one kalpa or ten thousand kalpas, it is wandering thoughts and defiling dust that traverse the kalpas in endless succession—his heart-mind has never known a kalpa.\n\nTherefore, if one can perceive but a single moment of the heart-mind, then in that very moment, this heart-mind severs all ties with past and future lives, with one kalpa or ten thousand kalpas. It is never reborn, never dies, never falls into kalpas, transcends the Three Realms, and is forever freed from the cycle of rebirth. The suffering lies in growing ever more confused, ever more deluded—from death to birth, from birth to death, from one kalpa to ten thousand kalpas—wandering thoughts and defiling dust never cease for even a moment, like melon vines trailing endlessly, like kudzu tendrils spreading without end, branching upon branch, node upon node, infinite and unbroken!\n\nAlas, ten thousand kalpas stretch vast and boundless—how distant they seem! Yet because wandering thoughts and defiling dust never cease for even a moment, the Three Wretched Realms and Eight Difficulties recur again and again, returning and departing, becoming all too familiar. To speak of this is to weep in sorrow!\n\nYou, who are devoted to the Dao, must cultivate your spiritual root, broadly practice virtue, and earnestly seek to recognize that single moment of the heart-mind. With this moment of the heart-mind, you will have severed the path of birth and death. From a single day to an entire lifetime, from one moment to ten thousand kalpas, this very moment of the heart-mind presides. Extend this principle, expand upon it, and when the time comes for transcendence and ascension, the matter will be effortless indeed.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to Heaven, gives birth to Earth, gives birth to man and all things—and man is the most spiritually endowed. Only man can attain immortality and sagehood, only man can assist Heaven and support Earth. Thus, man is that which neither Heaven nor Earth can equal.\n\nNow, seekers of the mysterious: do you rely on the heavens, or do you take matters into your own hands? If man defers to Heaven, Heaven too defers to man. When Heaven and man defer to one another, in this vast universe, there are scarcely one or two who stand as pillars between Heaven and Earth. Alas, how numerous are men, yet how few truly become men!\n\nTherefore, those of noble aspiration must accomplish within the square inch of their own hearts deeds unparalleled since ancient times. Heaven relies on them for clarity, Earth for tranquility, and all beings for their existence. Is this man a transcendent? A sage? He is but an ordinary man—yet also a transcendent, a sage.\n\nAll things under Heaven are achieved by ordinary men. It is only that men refuse to be ordinary. They chant poems and compose verses, calling themselves men of talent, unaware that the world has no lack of such words! They paint mountains and rivers, styling themselves masters, unaware that the world has no lack of such brushstrokes! They squander their limited time in idle amusements of no benefit. How lamentable!\n\nNow I exhort all people: life in this world is a rare opportunity—blink, and the hour of death arrives. If you would act, act in ways the world cannot do without. As for matters that, if absent, are not missed and, if present, add no weight, leave them to the idlers. Such things cannot withstand the trial of life and death, nor secure true liberation. Hold fast to your abilities and prospects, clinging to them as the freezing cling to clothing, as the parched crave drink—never releasing them, even in sleep or dreams.\n\nThe Dharma-body is here and now; the Dharma-realm is not distant. Each breath connects you to the workings of qi; each movement or stillness aligns with the creative transformations of the cosmos. Within a single vessel, you reverse yin and yang; within half a grain, you gather sun and moon. The Great Dao is profound and obscure; the Supreme Polarity flows with essence. The heart encompasses primordial transformation; qi moves the vast pivot of creation. Above, you ascend to the azure heavens; below, you sweep away the shadows of the unseen. With the merging of cyclical winds, a hundred days of practice bear efficacy. Heavenly immortals, earthly immortals, water spirits, and mountain lords—all ascend the great vow to broadly deliver sentient beings. Wind and clouds, dragons and tigers, phoenixes and roc—all attend at your side, aiding the turning of the Dharma-wheel.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states:\n*\"The great person harmonizes their virtue with Heaven and Earth, their brightness with the sun and moon, their order with the four seasons, and their fortune or misfortune with spirits and gods. They precede Heaven, yet Heaven does not oppose them; they follow Heaven, yet accord with its timing. If even Heaven does not oppose them, how much less can people—or spirits and gods?\"*\n\nThe Most High teaches people to cultivate the Dao—it is nothing but cultivating the self, for beyond the body there is no Dao. Filial piety, fraternal duty, loyalty, and trustworthiness—these are the Dao. The Mystery Gate holds no other secret; this alone is it. Ascending as an immortal and attaining fruition all proceed from this. If one fully embodies the Way of child, subject, younger brother, and friend, the heavenly palaces await with vacant seats—strive earnestly to practice this.\n\nThe essence of elixir refinement lies first in illuminating the heart-mind. The countless lofty perfected ones of the heavens all arise from a heart-source that is profoundly limpid; otherwise, even if one soars upward, one will inevitably fall back down. The Most High Lord Lao delivered one hundred and eight thousand beings, yet it was nothing but heart-mind imprinting upon heart-mind, without difference or sameness. The slightest divergence or distinction prevents the attainment of true fruition. Thus, the two words \"refining the heart-mind\" constitute the gateway to purity, the universal path of the ten thousand perfected. Do not dismiss them as easy and overlook them.\n\nYour heart-ground has grown clearer than before, yet it is \"non-being upon non-being, mystery upon mystery.\" Advance further upon the tip of the pole until you reach the great rest and great cessation—only then can you pluck out the root of birth and death. A great person presses forward with unyielding courage; once the resolve is sincere, heavenly demons retreat. Confucius said: *\"When it comes to benevolence, do not defer even to your teacher.\"* I am your teacher, yet the Dao is no other Dao, the Dharma no other Dharma. What I know, you too can know; what I practice, you too can practice.\n\n\"Who was Shun? Who am I?\" These words of the sages and worthies are indeed the eternal mirror of ages. The great Dao is like cloth, silk, beans, and grain—go a single day without it, and cold and hunger press upon the body; stray a single day from the Dao, and one falls into the realm of beasts. Though they appear covered in fur and horned, differing in form from us, when measured within the square inch of the heart, are they different or the same? Perhaps they are the same.\n\nAlas! What they see now, we shall see in the future. The scriptures of the *Great Cavern* are ancient and profound beyond fathoming; when practice is perfected and the heart-ground spiritually awakened, sudden comprehension arises. Yet knowing is not difficult—practicing is not easy. If you wish to fulfill your vow, you must be thorough from beginning to end, steadfast as the years pass. How then could attaining the true essence of the Dao and cultivating the supreme Way be difficult?\n\nThus, the Way of utmost sincerity enables foreknowledge. When reciting scriptures, let sincerity precede penetration. Turn inward and be sincere—no joy is greater. Then the ten thousand things are all complete within me. The human body contains the ten thousand things; without sincerity, there is delusion, and from delusion arise false conditions. The Three Corpses and Six Thieves follow the attachments of human intention, conjuring mirages like sea markets and towers, manifesting a thousand postures and ten thousand forms. The heart is like a skilled performer, and the Corpses and Thieves are its harm. Sincerity is reality; reality is truth; truth is the manifestation of the true spirit. With reverent heart, one sits in effortless dignity, and a jade countenance with golden essence emerges, stars arrayed like a chessboard. The heart is empty as a mirror, not a speck of dust adheres—this is the pure Dharma-body. With the Dharma-body attained, one must ascend to the Dharma-realm.\n\nThus, the learning of making the intention sincere and the heart upright is what people today disdain to hear. They claim the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi disregard the norms of propriety, prizing simplicity and brevity, unaware that rectifying the heart and making the intention sincere are the true and solid work of self-cultivation. To visit the Heavenly Lord or tread the immortal realms, one cannot escape the two words: sincerity and rectitude. Arrogance and indolence are thieves that harm the Dao; scholars must shun them like enemies and overcome them like demons before they may enter the hall of learning and become disciples of our Mystery Gate. Otherwise, of what use are they?\n\nThe aspirant to immortality first engages with the nature of the heart-mind, then proceeds to the crucible and furnace. Affairs have a beginning and an end, which cannot be reversed; principles have weight and priority, which must not be confused. If you can become a sage or worthy, why fear not becoming a buddha or immortal? The Primordial Heavenly King was also once a human. Mencius said: *\"All people can become Yao or Shun.\"* Truly so. People generally say the Primordial Heavenly King is the supreme being of prior Heaven. But I ask: who in the world comes from posterior Heaven? Clarity, emptiness, mystery, and brightness—these are prior Heaven. Stupidity, ignorance, baseness, and turbidity—these are posterior Heaven. People are divided into prior and posterior Heaven, but the heart has no such division. It depends on what one does; Heaven does not limit people by qualifications. Whether one becomes a sage or an ordinary person, it is for oneself to choose—do not waver in your heart.\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, there have only been two great paths. To become a sage is to become an immortal; as an immortal, one dwells in the heavenly palace, conversing at ease with the Primordial Heavenly King. To remain ordinary is to become a ghost; as a ghost, one resides in hell, constantly following King Yama. The division between heaven and hell lies solely in the heart. There is a path to Heaven, leading straight to the celestial abode. There is a path to the underworld, leading directly to the ghostly cavern. Confucius said: *\"The noble person ascends; the petty person descends.\"* Between ascent and descent, the distinction is subtle. The *Book of Documents* states: *\"The human heart is perilous; the Dao-heart is subtle. Between peril and subtlety, there is not even a hair’s breadth.\"* Reflecting on this, how can one not tremble?\n\nThe *Doctrine of the Mean* says: *\"Before joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness arise, it is called the Mean.\"* The Supreme Ultimate encompasses all things; from the utmost center, a single spark of numinous mechanism gives birth to Heaven and Earth, embracing the Two Modes, and the ten thousand things each attain their proper place. Extending this principle, the center of the human heart can be realized. The human heart is empty and most numinous; neither biased nor partial, when seeking its utmost center in stillness, it is naturally at ease; when seeking its utmost center in activity, it is naturally at ease. Heaven is non-active, yet the spirit moves within it; humans are non-active, yet the spirit guards their abode. Vast and boundless, it is one with the Great Void—how could the Creator drive and employ it?\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, yin and yang and the Five Phases congeal to form things—these are ghosts and spirits. When a single thought first stirs in a person, they fall into the yin realm, and ghosts and spirits know it. At this moment, if the mechanism turns, ghosts and spirits seize this opportunity to drive one into the sea of blood. Thus, from the time of birth, human emotions and perceptions arise daily, and cunning grows ever more refined—all due to this single thought. Those who study the Dao and pull out the root of birth and death do nothing more than uproot this single thought. If this thought does not move, how can ghosts and spirits drive one?\n\nThe ancient buddhas and tathāgatas, through countless kalpas, were followed by heavenly demons and external paths like clouds, yet when they sought the stirring of a thought, none could be found. Thus, they could long preserve the Dharma-body and eternally abide in the Dharma-realm. Today, in the time it takes to eat a meal, before the sun has moved, countless emotions, perceptions, and thoughts arise in swarms. To speak of studying the Dao in such a state—I have never heard of it. The ancient buddhas and tathāgatas, like ordinary people, wore clothes and ate meals, rising and resting, yet though no thought was unmoving, in truth no thought moved; though no moment passed without thought, in truth no moment had a moving thought. Confucius said: *\"At seventy, I could follow the desires of my heart without overstepping the bounds.\"*\n\n\"How wondrous these words! How perfect these words! Therefore, in studying the Dao, nothing precedes the refinement of the heart. Make the substance of the heart empty and round like a grain of millet—this is the most wondrous divine elixir, neither born nor dying, forever carefree and at ease. To become an immortal or a buddha is no more than this—what else could one seek? Yet people today seek the elixir rather than the Dao, speak of water and fire rather than the nature of the heart. Is this not abandoning the root to pursue the branches?\n\nThe sages of antiquity, in writing their books and establishing their teachings, never once mentioned the word *elixir*. The discourse on the elixir arose in the Han dynasty. For the lofty perfected ones of the upper realms, pitying the drowning of sentient beings, used the teaching of refining the elixir to guide and lift them toward the Dao. Later generations, however, divided it into two schools: *xing* (nature) and *ming* (life). In truth, without refining the heart, merely engaging in the arts of yin-yang and *li-kan* (water and fire), even until Maitreya’s descent, one will ultimately fail to achieve accomplishment.\n\nThe Great Elixir is formless and soundless, most numinous and wondrous. How can one use a defiled and vile heart as the vessel to contain it? Is this reasonable? The moment lustful thoughts arise, the true *qi* scatters and collapses. How can one use a body governed by the seven emotions and six desires as the crucible for the Great Elixir? Is this reasonable? Thus, the essentials of refining the elixir are entirely encompassed in the two words: *refining the heart*.\n\nThe essentials of the Great Dao are fully contained in *emptiness*. The single word *emptiness* encompasses all dharmas. From emptiness arises being—this is true being. From emptiness arises reality—this is true reality. The precious title of the Primordial Heavenly King is *Emptiness and Spontaneous Naturalness*. Even the ten thousand sages and perfected ones cannot transcend these four words. The reason all things are subject to birth and death is that they have not attained emptiness.\n\nHeaven has yin and yang, the five phases—thus, heaven is not empty. Earth has hardness and softness, dryness and dampness—thus, earth is not empty. Therefore, even heaven and earth cannot escape birth and death—how much less can humans! Consider ghosts and spirits: they seem empty, yet if they did not cultivate the Dao in life, though their physical forms are shed, the seven emotions, six desires, and the original spirit remain entangled. Thus, they drift in the netherworld, sinking into the realm of ghosts. Though they possess the virtue of intelligence and uprightness, they can scarcely approach the state of primordial transformation. Whether as *ling* (spirits) or *shuang* (souls), all are karmic consequences.\n\nOnly the cultivator who attains the Dao, thought after thought merging with emptiness, heart after heart without attachment, nurtures the numinous essence like a dragon embracing a pearl. The true light shines forth, harmonizing with the celestial realm of the Dharma to form a radiant pattern. How could such a one not ascend to the azure heavens?\n\nAlas! I have seen many in the world who cultivate the Dao, yet those who grasp its essentials are few. Why? Because they set their resolve solely on becoming immortals, and with their original minds, they generate countless deluded thoughts. They imagine immortals as unfathomably transformative, with boundless enjoyments, while their own great matter is left unexamined. Cultivating in this way, even after ten thousand kalpas, they will never find rest. Is this not lamentable?\n\nThe Most High became the Most High by maintaining a single heart across ten thousand kalpas, thought after thought undisturbed. Though governing creation, the Dao’s wonders arise naturally. In the true realm, one is carefree, forever without attachment, transforming without words, awe-inspiring without anger. How could one fabricate matters out of thin air? Responding to emptiness with emptiness, the principles of transformation unfold clearly. From the beginning of the world until now, it has been like a single day.\n\nHeaven has its highs and lows, immortals have their sages and commoners—ranks differ, but it depends on one’s virtue. None without cultivated virtue can hope to become an immortal. Can those of resolve afford to neglect this?\n\nThe word *elixir* holds a subtle principle. One must receive the true teachings from a true master. Even with a true master and true teachings, one must still devote oneself wholeheartedly, sever worldly ties, and take *illuminating the heart and seeing the nature* as the foremost task. The work of *kan-li* (water and fire) is the second vehicle, and *refining the body to divide the form* is the ultimate accomplishment of the third vehicle. As for ascension, it is only possible after fulfilling the three thousand merits and eight hundred deeds. This is not something the impatient and superficial can hope to achieve even by chance.\n\nThus, cultivators of the truth must first nurture their numinous essence and uphold their virtuous roots. Their words should not be uttered lightly, their eyes should not gaze wantonly, their ears should not listen indiscriminately, their actions should not be reckless. They must concentrate the Dao within themselves, asking whether they can face the true without shame. Only then should they set up the furnace and crucible, draw forth lead and refine mercury. Then the celestial spirits will assist them, demons will not dare to invade, and nine generations of ancestors will ascend to the immortal realms.\n\nYet people today, with their coarse and vulgar bodies, aspire to the affairs of ascending as immortals and entering sagehood. I ask: are the true officials of the Jade Palace like worldly wealth and status, to be seized by cunning or pursued by force? Thus, the worry is not that one cannot become an immortal, but that one cannot cultivate the Dao.\n\nConfucius said: *'The Dao is not far from man.'* The relationships of ruler and minister, father and child, elder and younger brother, friend and friend—these are the highest gateways to immortality. Countless lofty perfected ones entered through this path; there is no other way. To become a sage or a worthy is to naturally enjoy blessings in the celestial palace. To become a beast or a bird is to naturally suffer calamities in hell. Beneath the green peach blossoms, playing flutes and zithers, passing cups with immortal companions—or in the black mountain caves, swallowing iron and drinking steel, keeping company with *asuras*—which is sorrow, which is joy? Which path will you choose?\"\n\nThe reason for all this lies solely in the divergence of paths within the heart. Alas, how perilous! Who is responsible for this? When a person gives rise to a single good thought, it is like a wisp of faint smoke; when they give rise to a single evil thought, it is like ten thousand towering mountains. Thus, how difficult it is for goodness to take form! How effortless it is for evil to accumulate! Therefore, those who illuminate the Dao must ensure that the sprouts of goodness grow ever fuller, until there is goodness without evil—then what immortality could not be attained?\n\nIn refining the elixir, there is no other method: stabilize the heart, harmonize the spirit, gladden the qi, and replenish the essence. Yin evil is the hidden pest of the elixir, and cunning is its sworn enemy. If one can maintain every thought in goodness, every step in goodness, then yin evil will naturally dissolve, and cunning will naturally perish. The heart will be perfectly stable, the spirit perfectly harmonious, the qi perfectly gladdened, and the essence perfectly replenished—every affair and thing will then be governed by the workings of the primordial. Otherwise, with a heart of filth and defilement, a spirit of clinging attachment, qi of superficiality, and essence of dissipation, one claims to have refined the elixir—will it succeed or not?\n\nThose who study the Dao possess an initial resolve, a central resolve, and a final resolve. What is the initial resolve? It is the making of a vow. What is the central resolve? It is the refusal to abandon the path halfway. What is the final resolve? It is the attainment of success. These three resolves are also three kinds of karmic obstructions. The initial vow, once made, becomes a deluded aspiration—a mass of false imaginings—hoping to become an immortal and enjoy the riches of the celestial palace. Though one does not abandon the path halfway, in the course of cultivation, there are several layers of transformation, self-devised and unable to follow a single great path to the end. One practices a method, then soon changes to another, discarding the old for the new in pursuit of quick results. As for the final step, it is the most crucial work: even if one has completed ninety-nine percent, it is as if nothing has been done. Clouds rise beneath the feet, a halo crowns the head—yet one regards these as utterly ordinary, for this is the mark of a person of great capacity. If, instead, joyful attachment arises, one will inevitably enter the demonic path, and years of toil will be cast aside in an instant—how grievously lamentable!\n\nThese three karmic obstructions are what the student must guard against. Those who study the Dao should cultivate *great stability*. What is *great stability*? It is stability when stable, and stability even when not stable. Floating clouds emerge from the peaks without intent; flowing water departs its source without design. The Daoist, in movement and stillness, sitting and reclining, is like a feather in the sky, following conditions and pursuing circumstances without the slightest trace of obstruction. Receiving another’s veneration, one does not take it as honor; enduring another’s curses and blows, one does not take it as humiliation.\n\nWhen fine delicacies lie before one, let no thought of craving arise; when coarse gruel is served, let no heart of disdain for hardship take root. Encountering high office and nobility, treat them with ordinary courtesy; seeing a beggar, regard them as one’s own kin—only then is one a person of true virtue and greatness, one whom the Supreme Lord hears of and sighs in admiration, one whom all the sages deem beyond reach.\n\nWhen a person’s cultivation reaches this point and still fails to ascend the cloud-laden path to the Jade Capital above, I have yet to witness such a case!\n\nStudents setting their resolve must value *truth*; in self-conduct, they must value *elegant restraint*; and in dealing with others, they must value the *gentle warmth of spring*—only when all three are combined can one be called a person of the Dao, equally at ease in leaving or entering the world.\n\nWhen the true immortals of heaven hear of such a one, they will surely cherish and admire them, looking up to their character—how much more so for those below?\n\nYou are now past forty, precisely the time when a noble person’s conduct is perfected and their name established. Virtue should advance—advance at once; faults should be corrected—correct them immediately. If at such an age you still hesitate and procrastinate in turning toward goodness and reforming errors, I fear there will be things you fail to amend in time. Take heed, my friend!\n\nSages and worthies are not the responsibility of others; heroes are defined by their *refined courage*. The yellow crane is no difficult bird to summon—call, and it arrives.\n\nAre white clouds then soulless things? Summon them, and they will come. But first ask yourself: are you a being of heaven or one of earth? Among the ranks of the great immortals and perfected ones, arrayed like cranes and egrets upon the golden terraces and jade steps—can you hold your ground there? Question again and again; ponder again and again. If at this moment you can trust yourself, if you can stand without shame, then you are unmistakably an immortal! Whether you are an immortal or not—do not ask others, nor seek out some living immortal to inquire of him. Only measure yourself, only weigh yourself. If you are fully convinced, without the slightest deficiency, then the golden terraces and jade steps will naturally have a place for you to stand, the Great Brahma Heavenly Palace will naturally have a dwelling prepared for you, and upon the distant cloud-paths, a living immortal will surely come to receive you and ascend with you to heaven.\n\nThe *Doctrine of the Mean* says: *\"As one loathes a foul stench, as one delights in fair countenance\"*—this is called self-satisfaction. Mencius says: *\"If one’s conduct leaves one unsatisfied in the heart, then one grows weak.\"*\n\n\"If you can be fully satisfied with yourself, I shall accompany you on a journey through the boundless expanse, amidst ten thousand clusters of auspicious clouds, with cranes and celestial pipes filling the sky—how joyous it will be! What do those who study the Dao strive for? Is it for longevity and immortality? Or for literary achievements and worldly success? It is for none of these. Only when one strives for nothing can one truly be called a student of the Dao. Does this mean that studying the Dao is useless? Laozi says: *'The useless is the root of use; the non-doing is the foundation of doing.'* Only when one understands this can one speak of the Dao.\n\nI see people in the world who, with deluded minds, vainly hope to ascend as immortals or attain sagehood, seeking to escape the Five Defiled Worlds. Yet the immortals in heaven daily come and go amidst the toils of the mundane, moved by compassion to relieve suffering. Compared to those in the world who idly eat, idle about, gossip, or engage in frivolous play, they are ten times more laborious and a hundredfold more diligent. After a thousand hardships, they may save one or two souls, yet this does little for the world. Even if these one or two transcend and depart, the suffering of all beings on earth remains unchanged, their ignorance undispelled. Alas! Does the heart of the sage ever reach its limit? Or is it limitless? The world may end, but the heart of the sage knows no end; the sun and moon may fade, but the heart of the sage knows no bounds. Thus, when one is on the verge of ascending as an immortal or attaining sagehood, one must take up the great burden of heaven and earth upon one’s shoulders. Only when all beings on earth are liberated can that burden be set down. The *Book of Documents* says: *'If even one person remains unsaved, it is my fault.'* The heart of the sage spans eons as if they were a single day.\n\nTherefore, those who truly study the Dao take saving the world and delivering others as their bounden duty. They do not seek longevity for themselves alone, nor do they pursue literary or worldly success. Clearly, they must act as parents to the countless beings in the Three Wretched Realms, the Eight Difficulties, the Six Paths, and the Four Births. Seeing their suffering, they taste it as their own; seeing their delusion, they drown in it as if it were theirs. By every means, they strive to make these beings heed their teachings and join them in the pure, non-doing realm of the Great Brahma Heaven. Only then is their long-held vow fulfilled. Thus, those who study the Dao must hold such aspirations, such a foundation, aligning their virtue with the encompassing heaven, the sustaining earth, the radiance of the sun, and the brightness of the moon. In their cultivation, the multitude of sages will naturally appear, and the gods will attend them, wishing for their success and attainment. Why? Because their aspirations, vows, and Dao are one—though there be thousands or tens of thousands, they are as one.\n\nHequzi, I urge you to take heed; this is my hope for you.\n\nThose who cultivate the truth have their origins. Some come from heaven, some from the immortal isles of Penglai or the sacred mountains, and some from the wisdom and blessings of the human world. Though these three paths differ, all can attain immortality. The first two are of great root and capacity; the moment their aspiration for the Dao arises, the heavenly spirits immediately take notice. Why? It is like a man who once held high office or briefly retired to the forests—his former colleagues and superiors are many. If he seeks to return to office, what difficulty is there? But those who come from wisdom and blessings must diligently cultivate in purity for ten or five years before they can move the heart of heaven and attract the attention of the immortals. It is like a poor scholar who, without self-exertion, will find no one to lift him up. Thus, this path is harder than the former, though their ultimate success is the same.\n\nOne must not, with meager virtue and shallow talent, vainly hope for the great Dao, like a frog at the bottom of a well gazing at the clouds—self-attainment is impossible. Even if one receives true transmission but fails to accumulate merit and deeds, stubbornly relying on one’s own efforts, true immortals will not come, and malevolent spirits will surely arrive, harming only oneself. Is this not deeply regrettable?\n\nFor beginners, whose power of concentration is still weak, one must recognize one’s origin. How can this be known? During cultivation, if the mind is spiritually open, as if past understandings suddenly unfold in abundance and wondrous insights arise ceaselessly, it is because sages are guiding from the void and protecting in secret—this marks one of superior root and capacity. If one relies on diligent effort, spending many years, achieving one part for one part, two parts for two parts, as the *Doctrine of the Mean* says: *'If others can do it once, I will do it a hundred times; if others can do it ten times, I will do it a thousand.'* With such perseverance, how could the immortals not take pity and save them? Sooner or later, their day will come. This is the path of those of middling root and capacity.\n\nIf one’s heart yearns for the Dao but lacks constancy, now practicing, now abandoning, clinging to the joys of family at home or the pleasures of socializing abroad, unable to endure stillness, with thoughts contrary to the Dao—this marks the lowest, rootless kind. Even if sages were to dwell with them, they could do nothing. If this is their state in this life, so it will be in the next. Once the human form is lost, how difficult it will be to regain!\n\nThose who cultivate the truth, even in the darkest corners and hidden places, are as if beneath the bright sun and open sky. With such true character, one is already a true immortal; treading the void and ascending the boundless is but one’s natural duty. If one can apply the talents of a hero to the learning of the sage, nurturing one’s *qi* with the practice of *shendu* (vigilance in solitude), then in the days to come, one will surely ascend to heaven, occupy a high position, deliver the suffering in the netherworld, bless one’s descendants, and achieve a great and illustrious legacy. Is this not magnificent?\n\nYet I see those of the common world who possess not a single virtue or talent to surpass the masses, yet vainly aspire to the arts of *kan* and *li* (water and fire), their worldly attachments still unsevered—how could the immortal embryo take form?\"\n\nThose whose aspirations lie in mere warmth and sustenance yet dream of the pure and void—does this not move the countless lofty perfected ones of the Great Brahma Heaven to helpless laughter? Here and now, I plainly reveal to all: those who are neither sages nor heroes must not hope to become immortals; those who are not masters of the Confucian tradition should not presume to be disciples of the Mystery Gate. Heaven’s law is most severe, and its hearing reaches even the lowest. A single reckless thought brings calamity upon seven generations. Wherever this scripture resides, auspicious light and purple qi rise to pierce the clouds; the heavens rejoice, the host of sages gather to behold it, and its boundless merit defies all reckoning.\n\nShould any unworthy wretch, ignorant of true cultivation, dare to slander it, the flying heavenly divine kings shall strike down his person, and his kin shall suffer as well—afflicted in life with strange maladies, cast after death into Fengdu Hell, drifting through ten thousand kalpas in boundless darkness. Though they may repent then, what use will it be? Beware, all!\n\n**Postscript**\nI, Jue, at thirty-nine years of age, knew nothing of the art of cultivating the true. Not until the year *jiyou*, when I turned forty, did I receive the Great Method of the Primordial Sovereign’s brush and scripture, and by the descent of the Venerable Master of Azure Radiance, the Ancestral Teacher of the Dao, was I instructed with earnest and repeated admonitions. Only then did I learn that within heaven and earth there exists a Way of immortality and deathlessness, attainable by all, regardless of saint or commoner, and obtainable by those who seek it.\n\nFrom that time onward, I delved daily into the alchemical classics, probing their principles. Seeing how they established false names and symbols, guarding their secrets closely, I sighed and said: The alchemical classics were composed to deliver people and awaken the world, yet such deep concealment does not deliver but only misleads, does not awaken but only confounds. Even if Yan [Hui] and Min [Sun] were to return, how could they grasp even a fraction of it?\n\nYet our Venerable Master of Azure Radiance directly points to the true essence, opening for all beings of the ten thousand ages a vast and level path, broad and unobstructed, by which one may ascend directly to the Three Pure Ones and unite heart-to-heart with the Primordial Heavenly King. The reason the alchemical classics guard their secrets so closely is truly out of fear that they might be mistransmitted to the unworthy, violating the statutes of the Most High. But since our Venerable Master has taken \"refining the heart\" as the gateway to the great method, transmission naturally finds its proper recipient, and the unworthy cannot intrude.\n\nFor how could there be an unworthy person willing to refine the heart, or one who refines the heart yet remains unworthy? In the act of transmission, what room is there for doubt? As for the subtleties of gathering and firing, they are but minor details. Within these minor details, the supreme principle is already complete. If one truly refines the heart to attain spiritual clarity, this principle will naturally be realized.\n\nAlas! The system established by our Venerable Master may be called simple yet strict, direct yet subtle, broad yet not indulgent, great yet precise—unprecedented since ancient times! I, Jue, have served the Venerable Master for three years, enduring extraordinary hardships: twice, perilous walls collapsed, yet father and son escaped death; bandits passed our door without entering; neighbors suffered plagues, yet we remained untouched; malignant sores, poisonous fevers, and chronic ailments all vanished. We ate coarse vegetables and wore plain cloth, yet our needs were met without seeking.\n\nThis humble disciple, Jue, a lowly corpse of the vulgar world, has been illuminated by the celestial light of the Primordial Sovereign’s Dao, granted a path upward, and blessed with the grace of parents, teachers, and guardians, as well as the virtue of heaven and earth in nurturing and completing all things. To transmit the scriptures and spread the teachings is a once-in-a-millennium opportunity; having encountered this moment, one must not squander it. The Venerable Master’s protection of this humble disciple is in truth meant for this disciple to protect this scripture, passing it on to future generations, through one kalpa, ten thousand kalpas, and endless kalpas to come. How could I, Jue, not exert myself to fulfill the Venerable Master’s intent?\n\n**Preface by Dharma Heir Dongyang Hequzi**\n\n**Postscript**\nConfucius said: \"The Way has two paths—benevolence and its absence.\" Our Mystery Gate’s Dao likewise has two: the true Dharma and heterodox views. Those firmly rooted in the true are not easily swayed by the false, just as those deeply mired in the false are difficult to pull toward the true.\n\nYet there are those on the verge of drowning but not yet submerged, and those who wish to enter the true but cannot hold fast to it, lingering between success and failure. To these, I still have something to say. The essence of the great Dao originally arises from the void to generate being—is this not what the Confucians mean when they say, \"First, there is the One Principle within, which scatters into the ten thousand affairs\"? Then, from being it returns to non-being, restoring our original state of primordial oneness with the Great Void—is this not what the Buddhists mean by \"the ten thousand dharmas return to the One, and the One returns to the void\"?\n\nExtending this principle, the blossoming and fruiting of plants, the cycles of spring and autumn, the flourishing and withering of human affairs, the ebb and flow of the primordial and the eternal—all are but the fixed pattern of beginning and end, contraction and expansion, departure and return. What doubt can there be?\n\nWhat is truly strange is this: the Confucian Way of the *Doctrine of the Mean* shines like the sun and moon, illuminating past and present; the Buddhist school of true awakening spreads like great bridges and vast rafts across the world. Yet the pure and true principles of our Daoist teachings—the true essence of nature and life—are nearly discarded like worn-out sandals by those who discourse on the profound. Why is this? It is solely due to the rampant spread and deep poison of heterodox teachings and side doors.\n\nAlas, how bitter it is for me!\n\nHow grievously afflicted and deeply poisoned they must be! For over a decade, I raced across the land in confusion, only to awaken in sudden remorse and now return to the natural state at last. How could I not pour forth the bitter lament of my past struggles—those years of toil and anguish?\n\nYet now, having regained the joy of returning to nature, shall I not proclaim it to the world and rescue those drowning in the Daoist gate, lifting them all to the shore of the Way? In the year *gengzi*, while sojourning in You County in southern Chu, I chanced upon the *True Teachings on Singing the Dao*, five scrolls penned by Hequzi and revealed by the Azure Emperor of Pure Radiance. Reading it again and again, savoring its words, I felt as one awakening from a dream at the sound of morning bells, or warmed by spring’s gentle breeze while sipping sweet wine—where ten thousand sounds harmonize, every countenance must shine. Alas, why is this scripture not made known to the world, to serve as right understanding for our pure and true lineage?\n\nI had long wished to carve and publish it, yet my desire remained unfulfilled. This autumn, Tuo Luozi Yichun and Guan Sanzi from Haining, having journeyed once more from Nanchang, visited me in the Golden Ox Cave of Jishui. I had not known that Guan San, though of noble birth, had devoted himself to our Way. Upon hearing of his past inquiries, I found that more than half of what he had learned from his teachers were the same misleading doctrines I once endured—speeches of *qian*-dragon and *kun*-tiger, of striking bamboo and plucking zithers. Yet, being my elder by a day and perceiving his open heart and untrammeled speech—truly one of heroic talent drawn to true cultivation—I explained for him the key to the mysterious gate, the mechanism of death and life, the *zhen*-male and *dui*-female, the golden tripod and jade furnace. All these are but dharma-appearances, mere metaphors for the formless.\n\nGuan San, by nature pure and swift of root, leapt at a single word, and all his doubts dissolved. I then showed him this scripture to confirm my teaching. Moved by my long-held aspiration, Chenzi generously pledged to carry it back to eastern Zhe, bearing the cost alone to have it finely carved for me. Once completed, he would bring the printing blocks to fulfill my lifelong wish.\n\nAh! In this act of Guan San, compassion arises from hidden depths—half the merit of three thousand eight hundred deeds is already his. If this is so, then is it not that Heaven does not conceal the Dao, and this scripture emerges to serve as a bridge across the bitter sea? Is it not that Guan San has a karmic bond with immortality, and thus Heaven did not entrust it to another but awaited a worthy one to transmit it? And is it not that Heaven, pitying my fervent devotion to the teaching, refused to let me labor alone in spirit, secretly aiding me to swiftly accomplish this work?\n\nReflecting on this, the obtaining of this scripture is already wondrous, yet its publication is even more so! Where there is thought, there is resonance; where there is feeling, there is communion. If people abandon the Dao, how has the Dao ever abandoned them? Here stands a great path, bright and clear; here sits a dharma-gate, luminous and open. It is near, within oneself; it is not apart from one’s own mind. To seek afar what is close, to pursue the difficult while ignoring the easy—those who fall into such snares and deem themselves wise are dull roots indeed, turning one way without return. Their illness admits no cure.\n\nAt this moment, I pray that my fellow Daoist adepts, whose afflictions are not yet deep—those malleable as uncarved stone, poised between the common and the sagely—may, by good fortune, encounter this scripture. May they early cast aside fish-eyes to grasp the pearl within their robes, thoroughly wash away passions and desires, and guard against deceit while seeking contentment. Thus may they inwardly preserve their nature and life, and outwardly accumulate merit and virtue. Then the unseen responses of the Azure Emperor of Pure Radiance, as described in this scripture, will surely manifest—I have witnessed it myself!\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Guiyi Wan Qinghe, disciple of the Complete Perfection tradition, at the Golden Ox Cave in Jishui.",

      "translated_text": "**Preface to *Chanting the Dao: True Teachings***\n\nIn the Southern Polar Heavenly Palace, the August Sovereign of Azure Radiance, boundless in compassion and vow, most sagely and benevolent, descends with qi and sheds light, expounding scriptures and unfolding teachings across kalpas immeasurable, delivering countless beings—O Most Honored Heavenly Worthy, Supreme Dao Ancestor, Divine Master.\n\nI have observed that those who study the Dao in this world often err in transmission and practice. They speak of lead and mercury, deluding all sentient beings, clinging to deluded hopes in pursuit of immortality. Yet upon examination, what they transmit amounts to no more than a few pointers on techniques, boasting as though they grasp the black pearl, extorting wealth and demanding reverence, playing the part of a master. Each time I witness this, I cannot help but sigh at the transgression!\n\nTruly, no cultivator can transcend the bounds of yin-yang and the five phases, abiding alone with the Great Void, without first illuminating the ground of the mind. Thus, when true immortals deliver beings, they invariably teach one to refine the work within the mind’s terrain, tempering the square inch of the heart until it becomes like a crystal pearl, like a lapis lazuli treasure vase. From this, boundless wondrous meanings arise from the mind’s own source, thought after thought perfectly penetrating, heart after heart luminously clear. Then, the untransmitted secrets of the immortals since ancient times become utterly apparent.\n\nIf one applies the principles realized from the mind’s source to the earnest work of one’s own nature and life, at that moment, words will naturally arise beyond their surface, wondrously aligning with the mark. Demonic obstructions will not intrude, and one will forever be free from thorny entanglements. Thus, the Dao of elixir refinement is originally a living, fluid path. Yet the so-called masters of this world, with their stale words on paper and petty techniques, seek to make all conform to the same mold—how is this different from using a cotton pellet to shoot a pellet, or tuning a zither with glue? To expect success in such a way is indeed difficult!\n\nIn the *jiyou* year, on the *jiachen* day of the third lunar month in spring, the Dharma-heir Crane-Emaciate Child, having awakened, received and transcribed the Great Method of Wenchang’s brush.\n\nThis old man and Crane-Emaciate Child share a karmic bond from past lives. From the day I descended to the altar, nearly three years have passed. What I have transmitted to Crane-Emaciate Child amounts to nothing more than the two words: *refining the mind*. Ten thousand words, a thousand discourses—all serve only to elucidate these two words as the universal path of the thousand sages, the essential road of the ten thousand perfected. In the Great Luo Heaven above, on Jade Capital Mountain, among the countless lofty immortals, none have ever abandoned these two words to roam freely within the Dharma-realm of true light as disciples of the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning. Upon careful verification, none have ever done so.\n\nI recall when I first descended to the altar and imparted these two words to Crane-Emaciate Child, he did not believe them, assuming that elixir refinement must involve secret transmissions. He thought, *\"Refining the mind—anyone can speak of it, anyone can attempt it.\"* Thus, most of his questions and requests for further instruction revolved around theories of life cultivation. No matter what he asked, I simply expounded on the two words *refining the mind* with utmost sincerity. Only after a year, when Crane-Emaciate Child’s practice had advanced and he had gained true attainment, did he trust that I, his master, was no mere purveyor of empty words.\n\nWhen immortals deliver sentient beings, they first enable one to perceive the indestructible nature of life, and only then do they cultivate the indestructible life itself. This is what is meant by the dual cultivation of nature and life.\n\nAlas! Since I began discoursing with Crane-Emaciate Child, three seasons of cold and heat have passed. The waters of Penglai grow shallow, and the peach blossoms of Pan again bloom! Whether composing verses in Plum Pavilion or discoursing on the mysterious in Plantain Lodge, whenever insights arose, Crane-Emaciate Child would withdraw to record them in his book, totaling over fifty thousand words. He wishes to make them public for the world, to serve as a model for later generations, and has asked me for a preface.\n\nI reflect that the essentials of cultivation are already thoroughly documented. Yet I fear that people may regard the two words *refining the mind* as too simple, unwilling to place their faith in them. Thus, I reiterate and clarify these two words once more. This old man, since time without beginning, has vowed before the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning to deliver countless beings. I dare not deceive the world and future generations with falsehoods.\n\nCrane-Emaciate Child, hesitating, approached with the scripture and said: *\"The preface is excellent, but this scripture, which expounds the mysterious transformation and will be transmitted for ten thousand generations, cannot remain unnamed.\"*\n\nI replied: *\"The two words *refining the mind* are the true and essential teaching of the Most High in delivering beings and chanting the great Dao. What if we title it *Chanting the Dao: True Teachings*?\"*\n\nCrane-Emaciate Child descended the steps, bowed deeply, and said: *\"Excellent!\"*\n\n—Inscribed by the Old Man of Azure Radiance",

      "translated_text": "An Inscription\n\nAt the Southern Culmen Heavenly Palace, the Azure Radiance Most High—boundless in compassion, vast in vows, utmost in sageliness, perfect in benevolence—embodies harmony, preserves truth, extends transformative grace, oversees the myriad realms, traverses the nine provinces, averts disasters and dissolves kalpas, delivers countless beings: the Heavenly Worthy, the Supreme Dao Ancestor, the Divine Teacher.\n\nThis scripture is composed first to expound the refinement of the mind, then the refinement of life. Those who cultivate accordingly may illumine the ground of the mind, fortify the root of life, dispel the six thieves without effort, and extinguish the three corpses without striving. On the day the Dao is attained, one ascends to the Upper Clarity; myriad generations of ancestors all ascend to heaven, and descendants for all time become immortals. Truly, this is the greatest of Dharma gates, the essential path of the ten thousand Perfected!\n\nShould any unworthy disciple, ignorant of Heaven’s mandate, treat the sacred words with contempt, fail to treasure and guard this scripture, read it without avoiding women, or store it outside a purified chamber, the Dharma-protecting deities shall record their transgressions and report them to the Star Lords of the Northern and Southern Dippers. Misfortune shall be meted out: death followed by infernal torment. Only when one person attains the Dao will the Dipper Palace issue a pardon, allowing escape from the netherworld and rebirth. Alas! Be vigilant, lest you plunge yourself into irreverence!\n\nThough this scripture is attributed to Crane-Emaciate Child alone, it may truly be shared with all. May those among the world’s scholars who encounter it by karmic affinity refine their nature to become sages and temper their life to become immortals. I offer them the ladder to transcendence, fulfilling my vow to deliver beings—how joyous this is!\n\nYet to withhold transmission from one who is worthy, or to recklessly transmit to one who is not, incurs heavenly punishment. In the exchange of teaching, one must reflect thrice. The transmission of scripture and initiation of instruction must await the proper time. Only when the time is right and the recipient is worthy may the secrets of the jade casket be revealed and the profound mysteries disclosed. The Dao has its regulations and prohibitions—one must be prudent.\n\nOne must seek those of upright heart and disciplined conduct, whose ancestors bear no heavenly wrath nor abandoned ruler or kin, nor practiced unbenevolent arts, before entrusting them with this scripture. Even then, charge them earnestly to refrain from indiscriminate dissemination. If the recipient is indeed a person of great virtue, one need not reject them solely on account of their lineage.\n\nThose who readily embrace the Dharma are many, but superior practitioners are rare—such individuals are the true upper-grade disciples. Should someone who once pursued unwholesome ways, upon reaching middle age, suddenly repent and turn toward the Dao with sincere devotion, permit them to purify and renew themselves. Do not summarily reject them, so as to embody the Most High’s compassionate vow to deliver all beings.\n\nAlas! My words are finite, but my vow is boundless. Between heaven’s embrace and earth’s support, who cannot study the Dao? Who cannot cultivate the Dao? Every person possesses an innate nature, each endowed with wondrous function. Ascending as immortals, entering as sages—what difficulty remains? Yet due to karmic habits from past lives obscuring one’s original nature, and illusory phenomena of the present moment clouding true awakening, one mistakes thieves for kin and pursues delusion while forsaking reality. Thus, they cycle through the three evil destinies and eight adversities, departing only to return; traverse the six paths and four modes of birth, revolving without end.",

      "translated_text": "At the Southern Culmen’s Celestial Palace resides the Azure Radiance Supreme Emperor—savior of Fusang, wielder of the Great Unity’s celestial mandate. His qi governs the nine heavens, his authority unites the five peaks. Manifesting in myriad transformations, he reveals the esoteric truths of the sacred immortals. Boundless in compassion, boundless in vows, most sagely, most benevolent, his auspicious responses deliver countless beings. The Most High Heavenly Worthy, the Supreme Dao Ancestor and Immortal Master, bestows the register.\n\nToday, having recited the *Scripture of Purity and Stillness*, you must practice the method of purity and stillness. What is purity and stillness? It is the purification and stilling of the heart. The root of human affliction lies largely in the manifold delusions. Once delusions are eradicated, how many stray thoughts yet stir within the breast? The way to dispel stray thoughts lies solely in inward contemplation. At first, there is something; then, there is nothing. At the extremity of nothingness, there is no self. The water settles without ripples, the bright moon casts no shadow. If you deem this not emptiness, the subtlest hairs are perfectly transparent, and only luminosity is seen. If you deem this fundamental emptiness, in profound obscurity, all phenomena are complete. At this juncture, you cannot cling to steps or thoughts—lucid and resplendent, mysterious and serene. The way of elixir formation is fully contained herein.\n\nMeritorious deeds are the ford to ascension and Dao attainment, yet the accumulation of merit and conduct must begin with filial piety. Almsgiving is not within the means of the impoverished, but in speech, guiding others toward goodness and restraining them from evil—this costs only the labor of the tongue, yet grants others boundless blessings, constituting immense hidden merit. Reciting the *Great Cavern Scripture* and chanting the Dipper Mother’s mantra can deliver ancestors and amplify dark blessings—this is filial devotion. Avoid reading useless books or engaging in frivolous amusements. When matters arise, address them with a sincere and kind heart, benefiting the people and all things. In leisure, purify the heart and sit in stillness, reciting scriptures or silently paying homage, with every thought directed toward the Supreme Perfected. The Supreme Perfected, most compassionate and merciful, regards those who cultivate the Dao as a loving mother cherishes her infant, never for a moment setting her heart at ease. How could an infant longing for its mother be met with indifference?\n\nAlas! Human life in this world passes in the blink of an eye. The sages treasured every inch of time; we ought to treasure every minute. This is a truth most earnest. Those with aspirations must establish true resolve; those who study must engage in true learning. With perseverance over time, a single breakthrough of spiritual light reveals the immortal isles and celestial palaces before your eyes—a grand path, a radiant gateway—all within the square inch of the heart. This path is the way to ascension; this gate is the entrance to the Dao. If one takes the first step onto this great path, enters this gateway, and keeps the mind unwavering, the feet will swiftly advance. Becoming an immortal or a buddha is the easiest of matters.\n\nAs you read the *Scripture of Purity and Stillness*, ponder each phrase, comprehend each word, and unite your heart with that of the Supreme Perfected. When you have grasped the inner workings, the subtlety of wordless understanding, you have attained the true realm. Stray thoughts are not difficult to eliminate—cut them off as they arise, severing them with a single stroke. During meditation, do not cling to this heart. If, for the sake of stray thoughts, you bind yourself in great suffering, how can the nature-ground attain perfect freedom? How can the spiritual light break through? Instead, remain carefree and at ease, vast and unbounded, embodying the primordial vastness of the Great Void, unburdened by things.\n\nThus, the ancients contemplated the state before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure arise, and in guarding the mean, one must not cling to it, for this is the reason. Stray thoughts, though unavoidable, are like floating clouds that cannot burden the sky. With prolonged refinement, their roots are severed, and the mind becomes empty and spiritually luminous. Earlier, I likened stray thoughts to floating clouds—this is a precise analogy.\n\nAs for daily interactions, unless one is a hermit cultivating stillness in the mountains, how can these be avoided? I have a method to impart to you. Whatever brings joy, anger, sorrow, or delight, respond to it in the moment, then let it pass without lingering. Like wind, thunder, lightning, and fog—phenomena the heavens cannot do without, yet they are not the heavens themselves—so too are joy, anger, sorrow, and delight, which the heart cannot do without, yet they are not the heart itself. The heavens have their true celestial body; the heart has its true essence. Through my responses, remain in tranquil emptiness, ever vigilant, vibrantly alive—this is the essential secret.\n\nRefining the elixir first requires refining the heart. The method of refining the heart lies in eliminating idle thoughts and delusions as the gateway to purity and stillness. This is the ancestral transmission of the immortals—there is no other way. When a single thought does not arise in the heart, emptiness and clarity naturally arise together. At this time, essence becomes true essence, qi becomes true qi, and spirit becomes true spirit. Using true essence, true qi, and true spirit, blend them into one, refining them into a millet-grain pearl, into the yang spirit—thus is the immortal Dao accomplished.\n\nUniting spirit with qi, stillness and nurturance are the work—this is what Mencius meant by \"preserving the heart and nurturing the nature.\" Uniting qi with spirit, discipline is essential—this is what Mencius meant by \"holding fast to the will and not harming the qi.\" Uniting essence with spirit, purity and emptiness are the foundation—this is what Mencius meant by \"nurturing the heart, nothing is better than reducing desires.\"\n\nThough essence, qi, and spirit are three when divided, they are one when united. Spirit and qi obey the commands of essence. If one preserves essence, spirit naturally flourishes, and qi naturally flows. Then, with the work of regulation and the way of return, there is no fear that the spiritual embryo will fail to form or the great elixir will not be achieved. This is the method for beginning practice—I write it here to instruct you. To refine the elixir without first refining the heart is like whipping a horse to run while hobbling its feet.",

      "translated_text": "Refining the heart constitutes half the work of attaining immortality. When the heart is clear, the spirit becomes pure; when the spirit is pure, qi congeals; when qi congeals, essence is secured. The alchemical classics speak of foundational cultivation, medicinal ingredients, furnace and cauldron, lead and mercury, dragon and tiger, sun and moon, Kan and Li—all these terms arise from the work of refining the heart. As for the methods of harmonization, the dynamics of interaction, the techniques of ascent and descent, and the arts of firing and refinement, these are but secondary matters. If the source of the heart remains turbid and entangled by passions and desires, then even if the foundation is firmly laid, it will eventually collapse; though the medicinal ingredients may be complete, they will inevitably be deficient. The furnace will crack, the cauldron will break, the dragon will wage war, the tiger will roar, the sun will be eclipsed, the moon will darken, Kan will be empty, and Li will be full. At such a time, if one attempts to discuss harmonization, yin and yang will fail to unite; if one seeks to understand interaction, water and fire will be at odds. What should ascend will instead descend, and what should descend will retreat upward. The Three Corpses will harm you, the Six Thieves will disturb you, and a cup of water will be powerless to extinguish the fire of a cartload of kindling. Thus it is said: refining the heart constitutes half the work of attaining immortality. This is a profound truth, an unassailable argument—a single phrase that pierces the celestial mechanism and shatters demonic obstacles. Refining the heart is the essential Dao of the immortals’ path from beginning to end. If the ground of the heart is overgrown with weeds, even if one obtains the Dao of the elixir, it will be but a side door; though one may become an immortal, one will not be recorded in the celestial registers, will not be able to consort with the Perfected of the Great Canopy, nor enter the gateway of the Great Vehicle. Therefore, if one wishes to form the sacred embryo, one must first ascend to perfect enlightenment—this is the crucial teaching.\n\nThe work of regulation lies entirely in ascent and descent. The method of ascent and descent lies entirely in tranquil observation. Tranquility is not absolute stillness, for within tranquility there is movement. Yet this movement is not true movement—it is the turning of creation’s wheel. Observation is not clinging to observation, for within observation there is awareness. Yet this awareness is not true awareness—it is the flickering of numinous light. When tranquility gives rise to observation, and observation enables tranquility, this is what is called tranquil observation. At this time, the cauldron is empty while the medicine is full, water is firm while fire is gentle. With each firing and each refinement, each exhalation and each inhalation, one moves in harmony with the mysterious transformations of heaven and earth, the revolutions of the sun and moon, the clarity and turbidity of yin and yang, and the cyclical succession of the four seasons. Entering the realm of non-being from being is called the millet pearl; entering the realm of being from non-being is called the yang spirit. When the work reaches this point, it is the moment when both form and spirit are transformed.\n\nIf one has not refined the heart, one remains mired in the filth of the seven emotions and six desires, and to seek the arts of longevity or fathom the wonders of the golden elixir is like a warrior wielding shield and spear while strumming the strings of a zither, or a weak horse burdened with bridle and reins attempting to gallop up a winding mountain path—how can one hope for the five notes to be harmonious or the six reins to be at ease? The preceding chapter stated that refining the heart constitutes half the work of attaining immortality—this is the teaching to which all streams return, the truth affirmed by successive patriarchs from heart to heart. If you were not devoted to the Dao, I would never transmit this.\n\nYet the refinement of the heart takes different forms: there is the refinement of the heart of perception and experience, and the refinement of the heart beyond perception and experience. What is the heart of perception and experience? When affairs arise and things come forth, one responds to stimuli without fail, finding oneself at ease in every situation, drawing from inexhaustible sources—this is what the sages and worthies of the Confucian school have already expounded. It is like a bright mirror or a precious pearl reflecting objects: the radiance of the mirror and the luster of the pearl remain serene and luminous, undisturbed by what they reflect, unclouded by the multitude of reflections. What is the heart beyond perception and experience? In utter stillness, one turns the light inward; in perfect clarity, one gazes within. There is no perception of others, no perception of self, no perception of being, no perception of non-being, no perception of non-being’s non-being, no perception of the absence of non-being’s non-being. There is the light of a mirror, yet in truth no mirror; there is the luster of a pearl, yet in truth no pearl. At this time, even the Greatly Awakened Tathāgata would yield his seat to you, and all the realms of form and sound would be contained within the radiant clarity of your hair’s tip.\n\nYet the heart of perception and experience must be refined in activity. Amidst the scorching flames of a fiery pit, beneath a sky ablaze, one’s heart remains cool and at ease, like a single drop of dew from a willow branch—this is the refinement of activity. The heart beyond perception and experience must be refined in stillness. In a single instant, myriad kalpas pass like bubbles and lightning, arising and vanishing in succession, yet one remains unmoved, the nature of wisdom ever empty—this is the refinement of stillness. Though the heart of perception and experience and the heart beyond perception and experience are ultimately one, the refinement of activity and the refinement of stillness are both the refinement of the heart—what division is there to speak of?\n\nZhang Ziyang’s alchemical writings reveal what earlier masters had not disclosed, serving as a true guide for Daoist adepts. Yet his discussions of the firing times and the gathering of ingredients often employ veiled language, for he regarded the numinous elixir as a secret of heaven and earth, intending that students should quietly contemplate and grasp it for themselves. Zhang’s intentions were truly earnest! But I take a different approach: I strive to wash away all residual dust, revealing a single great path so that students may set forth in the morning and arrive by evening. Those with wisdom will have no difficulty penetrating the profound and attaining the rank of the Perfected of the Great Canopy.\n\nYet this is no easy task! Even the two words \"refining the heart,\" which encompass the entirety of the immortal’s path, require one to sit until the meditation cushion is worn through and kneel until the knees are ground away—how else could one cease all discursive thought, attain complete non-attachment, perceive one’s original face, and realize the supreme root-source? Thus, refining the heart is the iron wall and bronze barrier of the immortal’s path. Only when this barrier is breached and this wall is shattered does one attain the state of perfect roundness and untrammeled freedom, the single grain of millet pearl, the three-inch yang spirit, dwelling at ease in the mysterious palace and pervading the Dharma-realm. Though there may still be the work of firing and refinement, the timing of nurturing the fire—these are like building a seven-story pagoda with only the topmost tier remaining, a matter of but a single moment.\n\nYou possess a profound devotion to the Dao and the courage to forge yourself—you are truly a hero of our age. What fear is there that the Dao will not be illuminated or the elixir will not be achieved? Yet the work of tranquil observation is not possible unless the heart is like dead ashes and the body like withered wood—only then can one cast everything aside and leap from the precipice.",

      "translated_text": "Though your worldly attachments are light, your family ties remain unsevered—how then can you suddenly renew this spirit and accomplish this great work? Alas, youth slips away swiftly, and white hairs hasten upon you. Take heed and rouse yourself to vigilance!\n\nYou ask: Though I sense the world’s bonds are faint, my household affairs press thick upon me—children cluster at my knees, and the cares of clothing and food weigh upon my heart. For years I have toiled with my tongue to feed my family, and though I hold the aspiration to cultivate the Dao, I cannot secure a tranquil abode. Thus I am ensnared in mundane entanglements, sunk in the web of karma, and fear that in a single moment of impermanence, I may forever plunge into the sea of suffering. Out of compassion, Master, how would you instruct me?\n\nThe Master replied: The method of refining the elixir, though expounded in a thousand words and ten thousand phrases, distills entirely into the two characters: *refining the heart*. And the method of refining the heart does not require one to leave the world. Did all the immortals of old retreat into the forests, abandoning human affairs, before they mounted the simurgh or rode the crane to roam the Purple Courts? In sum, the Way is present in daily eating and drinking; the Way is present in serving those above and nurturing those below; the Way is present even on the battlefield amidst warhorses. The ancients spoke of *\"refining spirit in activity, refining life in stillness\"*—how profound their words!\n\nAs for the practice of tranquil cultivation, the first chapter of the *Doctrine of the Mean* already states: *\"Be reverent and cautious when unseen, fearful and apprehensive when unheard.\"* When one neither sees nor hears, yet remains reverent and apprehensive, attaining the center so that heaven and earth take their proper places, and achieving harmony so that the myriad things are nurtured—this is the supreme vehicle of the Tathāgata. Riding the lion or sitting upon the elephant is but this heart and this principle—how does it differ from that of ordinary people?\n\nYou fret over worldly burdens and secular entanglements, seeking to abandon the present in pursuit of some transcendent state. Yet the noble person acts according to their station—surely they would not do this. King Wen, imprisoned in Youli, expounded the *Book of Changes*; Confucius, besieged between Chen and Cai, still plucked his zither and sang. Even the sages, when confronted with trials and unbearable hardships, could fully realize their nature and fulfill their destiny—how much more so for you, whose present circumstances have not reached such extremes!\n\nThe only thing you need fear is a lack of resolve, not an excess of burdens. Where there is true resolve, there is true learning. Whether in the celestial grotto-heavens or the stables of sheep and horses, the cultivator of the Dao must regard all with equanimity. Ultimately, the lotus throne of the great bodhisattva and the iron bed of the sinful ghost in the flames are fundamentally the same realm. Why? Because the bodhisattva’s buddha-nature is the same as the sinful ghost’s buddha-nature. The noble person speaks of nature, not of circumstances.\n\nZhang Ziyang’s saying that *\"intention serves as the matchmaker\"* is but a few words, and far from comprehensive. I shall now complete it for you. Intention originates in the heart and is perfected in nature; thus, only with a true heart can there be a true nature, and only with a true nature can there be a true intention—this intention is called the *primordial unity of intention*. Now, in the primordial state, before forms and images have taken shape, without the slightest trace or sign, how could there be something called \"intention\"? Yet in the moment of silent sitting, when the mind is settled and the spirit luminously clear, free from dross and devoid of discursive thought—this is the primordial substance of nature. From this emptiness emerges a single point of true intention, like the circle of the Great Ultimate giving birth to yin and yang, or Fu Xi’s single stroke generating the Two Modes. Thus it is called the *primordial unity of intention*. Paired with water and fire, it draws forth lead and mercury, and in its use, nothing fails to respond. The completion of the elixir path is entirely governed by this single intention, which orchestrates and revolves all.\n\nThe alchemical use of intention is thus, yet Zhang’s account is overly terse—how could this suffice to instruct later learners and guide future generations?\n\nThe *mysterious pass* is a subtle aperture, elusive and hard to know. To deem it within is not within; to deem it without is not without. Even the first chapter of the *Doctrine of the Mean* has spoken of it: *\"Before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure arise, it is called the center; when they arise and all accord with measure, it is called harmony.\"* The state before arising is not the mysterious pass, nor is the state after arising. Only in the instant of *about to arise yet not yet arisen, or suddenly arising from the unarisen*—that is the mysterious pass. A breath too soon, it is not the pass; a breath too late, it is not the pass.\n\nThus, in a person, when still, the mysterious pass is present in the blink of an eye; when active, it vanishes in the blink of an eye. It is but a fleeting moment, a single instant. Speaking of it in its vastness, the mysterious pass exists before the workings of creation. Why? Because after creation, heaven and earth incline ever toward movement. What moves heaven and earth? The mysterious pass moves them. Yet once it moves, it is no longer the mysterious pass.\n\nSpeaking of it in its smallness, the flight of the kite, the leap of the fish, the transformation of insects, the chirping of the cicada—what enables their flight, their leaps, their transformations, their cries? The mysterious pass does. Yet when considering the human body, there is a difference. Why? The lifting of hands and feet, the seeing of the eyes and hearing of the ears, the smelling of the nose, the tasting of the mouth—these cannot be designated as the mysterious pass.\n\nThe mysterious pass is the moment when the myriad forms are utterly still, when not a single thought has yet formed, when suddenly there is a stirring, and all is pervaded; when suddenly there is awareness, and all is illuminated—*this* is the mysterious pass. To think upon the stirring or reflect upon the awareness is no longer the mysterious pass.\n\nThus, the mysterious pass in a person is like fire in stone or light in lightning—ungraspable, untouchable. Alas! Those who refine the elixir without knowing this single aperture of the mysterious pass are utterly lost. Today, people are ruled by the nature of their material endowment, and the mysterious pass remains closed and obstructed from the moment of birth. Only through stillness upon stillness, quiescence upon quiescence, mystery upon mystery, emptiness upon emptiness—only then can one attain this single aperture of the mysterious pass.",
      "overlap_context": "e like building a seven-story pagoda with only the topmost tier remaining, a matter of but a single moment.\n\nYou possess a profound devotion to the Dao and the courage to forge yourself—you are truly a hero of our age. What fear is there that the Dao will not be illuminated or the elixir will not be achieved? Yet the work of tranquil observation is not possible unless the heart is like dead ashes and the body like withered wood—only then can one cast everything aside and leap from the precipice.",

      "translated_text": "This aperture is the very source from which the true heart, true nature, true essence, true spirit, and true qi emerge—while the mysterious pass serves as its mechanism.\n\nMaster Shao said:\n*\"At the first stirring of yang,\nWhen the ten thousand things are yet unborn—\"*\nHere lies that single aperture of the mysterious pass, vanishing in an instant; one must seek it urgently.\n\nIn the previous discourse, I entrusted to you the secret of the mysterious pass—a precelestial truth never fully transmitted, which past patriarchs dared not speak of in full. This single aperture of the mysterious pass is what all sages and immortals have distilled into two words to teach their disciples at the moment of *illuminating the heart and seeing the nature*.\n\nHow does the heart become illuminated? In a sudden flash—this is the mysterious pass.\nHow does the nature become visible? In a sudden revelation—this is the mysterious pass.\n\nThe mysterious pass is the spiritual trigger for *illuminating the heart and seeing the nature*, the wondrous mechanism for *conceiving the embryo and refining the elixir*. Thus, the ancients presented these two words ex nihilo to instruct later generations, urging them to somersault upon the needle’s tip and inscribe a footnote in the flash of lightning. The immortal’s arts of *dividing the body and transforming qi*, of *emerging from water and entering fire*, of *ascending to heaven and descending to earth*, of *a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations*—all arise from grasping, stabilizing, somersaulting, and inscribing within this mysterious pass. Then, transformations follow the heart, the hidden and manifest are at one’s command, and nothing remains difficult. These few words are the workings of heaven—without a decade of devoted practice, they cannot be penetrated.\n\nYet clinging to a decade of effort is itself delusion. The Way may be swift as a moment or slow as a lifetime. You possess karmic wisdom; surely it will not be difficult for you.\n\nThe disciple responded: *\"By past-life causes, I have encountered a sagely teacher who points the Great Dao. Though I strive to follow, for years I have been driven like a horse in harness, my will fixed only on fodder, while the learning of life and nature remains utterly beyond my sight. The苦海 is fathomless, and I see no shore. At this thought, my heart’s fire blazes upward, and sweat pours from my body. Master, have compassion—how shall I be taught?\"*\n\nThe master replied: *\"Examine your practice today: whatever you can do, do it earnestly. Each fraction of progress is a fraction gained. Though it may not be the essential Way, it becomes the foundation for future attainment. Building a house requires first laying a firm foundation and erecting four sturdy pillars—only then can towering pavilions, painted beams, and carved rafters be raised in due course. To dream of lofty halls without a single shovelful of earth or a single bundle of firewood is like climbing a tree to seek fish.*\n\n*One must read the alchemical texts, yet not seek the elixir by following their diagrams. Practice stillness and cultivation—once you gain entry, wondrous threads will unfold of themselves, every point leading to the Way. You will find it impossible to stop. With your karmic roots, your name inscribed in the immortal register, how can you neglect deep cultivation of the Dao?*\n\n*I have always taught that one must begin with foundational work—through humble study, one naturally ascends. Yet there is no true distinction between high and low. Consider the two words 'refining the heart': the lowly path lies within, and the exalted path lies within as well. Dispelling delusive thoughts and idle musings is the lowly path. In an instant, directly transcending to perfect awakening—this is the exalted path. Such has been known since antiquity. If they are men, so am I—why should I fear?*\n\n*Yet before beginning practice—or even as you begin—do not entertain such thoughts, lest impatience disrupt you. 'First difficulty, then reward' is the essential principle of stillness cultivation.*\n\n*As for gathering the medicine and refining the elixir, having read the alchemical classics, you already grasp the general outline. When stillness cultivation reaches its subtlety, each step naturally generates the next, every point becomes the Way, and boundless wondrous realms flow from the primordial single intent. This is not mere empty knowing or vacuous awareness—there is true joy and true fulfillment. The One Origin is ever-present, and the ten thousand images return to spring. No words can describe it.*\n\n*To you, I have held nothing back. Our past-life karmic connection has brought us face to face in this life—I cannot be without you, nor can you be without me. If your Dao does not come to fruition, it is my sorrow as well. When you have a moment of leisure at midday, sit upright for a time and inwardly observe the substance of the heart. Your mind is filled with anger and resentment—if you can purify it, you will uproot a great karmic obstacle. Remove all disease roots one by one. Persist gently, and conditions will naturally converge; heaven will follow your wish. Once worldly burdens are cleared, body and mind become unobstructed, the foundation is naturally firm, and the Great Dao presents no difficulty.*\n\n*I teach you to begin with foundational work. Since ancient times, those who attained immortality and realized the Dao have largely followed this path—how could it be otherwise for you?*\n\n*Stillness nurtures the heart,\nClarity reveals the nature,\nWisdom observes the spirit,\nStability sustains the qi,\nRestraint of desire generates essence,\nUtter emptiness establishes intent—\nThese are the essential principles.*\n\n*Stillness leads to non-doing, thus the heart is clear.\nClarity prevents confusion, thus the nature is visible.\nWisdom enables illumination, thus the spirit is whole.\nStability ensures constancy, thus the qi flows freely.\nRestraint of desire consolidates the One Origin, thus essence is generated.\nUtter emptiness empties the ten thousand conditions, thus intent is realized—\nThese are the essentials within the essentials.*\n\n*As for the various symbolic terms in the alchemical texts, many could well be discarded: lead and mercury, sun and moon, crow and hare, metal and wood, infant and maiden, east three and west four, south two and north one—all are names coined by later generations based on meaning. The key terms are nothing more than essence, qi, and spirit, which encompass the Three Origins and Five Phases. What should descend, let it descend; what should ascend, let it ascend. Guard it with stillness, unite it with emptiness. Move it with intent, yet never cling to intent.\"*",

Why call it qi?\n**Master:** That which is numinous within is called spirit; that which moves is called qi.\n**Disciple:** If it has no form, how can the elixir be formed?\n**Master:** From nothing, something arises.\n**Disciple:** How long must one sit to reach no thought and no念?\n**Master:** For beginners in seated meditation, after a few moments, illusory delusions may be dispelled.\nWith long practice in stillness, in the time it takes to eat a meal, one may already drift into the realm of nothingness.\nFor beginners, not only must one maintain mindfulness during sitting, but in all actions and undertakings, one must constantly uphold the insights and attainments gained during meditation—thus the power of concentration readily matures, sublime states readily manifest, and absorption deepens.\nThe whole body melts and merges, like clouds over mountains and moonlight on rivers.\nThe alchemist’s gathering of lead and drawing of mercury occur when, in the state of fasting the heart and forgetting the self, a single point of fetal breath flows forth.\n\n**Disciple:** Your disciple has long been beset by hidden misfortune, constantly encountering hardships, and has resigned himself to an early death in some ditch. Across ten thousand kalpas, as countless as mustard seeds or ox hairs, what fortune to meet a sagely teacher in this life and receive guidance on the Great Dao!\nMoved to tears and stirred to action, my reverence deepens—may you fully transmit the secret essence of the numinous elixir!\nOnce I attain the Dao, I vow to remain under your guidance forever, taking eternal refuge!\n**Master:** What I have discussed thus far has been detailed on nature and brief on life. What your heart still finds unsatisfactory lies here.\nThe formation of the elixir begins with refining the heart; refining the heart lies in still observation.\nWhen still observation reaches its apex, the Great Medicine arises spontaneously, and the Three Origins mutually manifest.\nEstablishing the furnace and crucible, the wind of Xun and the earth of Kun—Master Ziyang’s teachings are worth heeding.\nAs for the operation of the firing times, there is more to say.\nThe blood and qi of the human body circulate and flow, their cyclic ascent and descent naturally corresponding to the celestial degrees.\nIn movement, one does not perceive it, but in stillness, the meridians and joints between bones warmly ascend and gently descend, precise to the inch and exact to the hair’s breadth.\nFrom the tailbone, it reverses to the Mud Pill Palace; from the Mud Pill Palace, it descends to the Crimson Palace, converging in the chamber of spirit, merging with the qi of the Five Phases into one, and returning to the Yellow Court within the navel.",

      "translated_text": "At this very moment, \"a single point descends into the Yellow Court.\" The method of withdrawing lead and adding mercury is nothing more than this. The various theories are myriad and exceedingly trivial.\n\nWhen the yang spirit emerges from the womb, a light radiates outward from the navel wheel, and a fragrance issues from the nose and mouth—these are the precursors of its emergence. Once emerged, golden light scatters in all directions, the pores of the skin gleam like crystal, akin to the sun rising over the sea or a pearl first appearing in the depths, while the fragrant qi suffuses the chamber. With a thunderous crack, metal and fire intermingle, and the yang spirit departs from the Mud Pill Palace.\n\nAfter its departure, everything depends on the work cultivated in ordinary times. This is precisely why I first spoke of refining the heart-mind. If the heart-ground has been nurtured to emptiness and clarity, the yang spirit will be composed purely of primordial spiritual qi, inherently free from thought and action, unstained by circumstances, unmoved by phenomena, with mastery over its gathering and release, coming and going as it pleases. As soon as it enters the Mud Pill Palace, the body becomes as if scorched by fire, golden light once again emanates from the pores, and fragrant qi once more fills the air. In an instant, it returns to the Yellow Court, existing as if non-existent, unknowing and unaware—this is the true state.\n\nIf the heart-ground has not attained emptiness and clarity, the womb formed will certainly not be the sacred embryo, and the spirit cultivated will inherently carry traces of impurity. Like one whose qi is clouded by turbidity, governed by the nature of conditioned existence, though the spirit may emerge, at the sight of something fearful, terror arises; at the sight of something desirable, attachment arises. It may linger and forget to return, following the path into demonic realms. Though the body may die, and the unknowing may believe one has attained immortality and transformed in meditation, who realizes that the yang spirit, once departed, will never return? Such an outcome is beyond remedy.\n\nEarlier, I spoke of refining the heart-mind as half the work of attaining immortality; now, upon reflection, it is the essential path from beginning to end. What was once called half is now called complete, even doubled—should the sages return, they would not alter my words.\n\nSomeone asks: If the heart-ground has not attained perfect emptiness and clarity, yet the embryonic spirit has already emerged, what is to be done?\n\nThe master replies: If there is no other recourse, there remains the practice of refining emptiness. Though the embryonic spirit has emerged, it must be tightly reined in to complete the work of refining emptiness. Only then may the monkey be released, allowing it to roam freely within the true light of the dharma realm, transformed and vast beyond comprehension.\n\nI venture to ask: What is meant by \"refining emptiness\"?\n\nIt is difficult to put into words.",

      "translated_text": "Previously, I spoke of the method of *huohou* (fire timing). What you now read in the alchemical classics aligns with my intent—nothing more than abiding in stillness and inward observation, allowing the true *qi* to circulate without cease. This is also called \"drawing lead and adding mercury,\" which is simply the constant ascent of true water and the constant descent of true fire. The ancient sages’ four characters—\"curbing anger, restraining desire\"—are the essential secrets of bathing, drawing, and adding. If anger is not curbed, fire that should descend will instead rise; if desire is not restrained, water that should ascend will instead drain away. Even if ninety-nine percent of the work is complete, the elixir crucible will still fail, true essence will leak downward, and unforeseen dangers may arise—not merely the failure to achieve perfection.\n\nYet curbing anger and restraining desire are still forced efforts. Only when there is no anger to curb, no desire to restrain, and even the thought of curbing and restraining is forgotten, can the elixir be formed. The method of refining the elixir begins with refining the heart, proceeds to gathering and absorption, and concludes with *huohou*—nothing more. The method of refining the heart takes stillness and observation as its foundation. In the stillness of observation, there is observation without object; in the observation of stillness, movement arises from stillness. Primordial essence flows abundantly, primordial spirit leaps vigorously, primordial *qi* surges and swells—thus the three primals are complete.\n\nThe method of gathering and absorption: true intention arises from the true heart, true essence follows true intention. When drawn upward, it is like a pearl luring a dragon, gently and without haste or slack; when drawn downward, it is like bamboo channeling a spring, trickling steadily without rush or delay. It is like playing the sheng or tuning the zither, like the joy of man and woman, the firmness of husband and the softness of wife—when their passions harmonize, they are sent into the Yellow Palace, and the principle of gathering and union is complete.\n\nAs for *huohou*: the steaming of true *qi* is the bath, its unbroken continuity is the drawing and adding. After ten months, a being like a person leaps forth from within, lingering in the Palace of the Sun, emerging in the Mansion of Muddy Pellet—thus the elixir of the entire body is formed.\n\nAs for refining emptiness: it requires a vast and unbounded heart, a subtlety that forgets the body, no self and no other, no heaven and no earth. One awakens to a pure, empty *qi*, within the undifferentiated chaos—a single spark of true yang, neither self nor not-self, neither empty nor not-empty. Creation revolves, yin and yang alternate in brilliance, divided yet indivisible, united yet ununitable—this is called refining emptiness. Refining emptiness is the union of the emptiness of the yang spirit with the emptiness of the great void, merging without gap, what is called \"form and spirit both wondrous, uniting with the Dao in truth.\" This is the work after the emergence of the embryo, the matter before the division of the body.\n\nSomeone asks: After the yang spirit emerges from the embryo, it still resides within the human abdomen—how can it unite with the great void?\n\nThe master replies: Emptying the heart can make one forget the form. When a person reaches the point of forgetting the form, the yang spirit within the abdomen is no different from being in the great void—how could it not unite with it?\n\nIn sum, refining emptiness completes only the final stage of refining the heart. The illusory body has form, so it is called refining the heart; the yang spirit is formless, so it is called refining emptiness.\n\nSomeone asks: How long must one practice refining emptiness?\n\nThe master replies: Nine years of nurturing accomplishes only the work of refining emptiness. The wonder of refining emptiness is boundless transformation—one can tread upon rosy clouds, ride the mist, and fly away with the whole body. How could it be merely the emergence of the spirit? Yet this stage is the most difficult; among thousands or tens of thousands, scarcely one or two attain it.\n\nSomeone asks: If one refines the heart to the point of utter nothingness, after the embryo emerges, can the step of refining emptiness be omitted?\n\nThe master replies: If one has refined to utter nothingness, then body and heart are both transformed into emptiness—what emptiness remains to be refined? With a heart of utter nothingness, one forms an embryo of utter nothingness, nurtures a yang spirit of utter nothingness, and unites with the great void of utter nothingness. Manifesting the great dharma-body, radiating great light, a hundred thousand myriad bodies fill the space of the void—like a luminous pearl emitting light, it is all one light.\n\nIf, during the refining of the heart, the residual roots are not thoroughly cleansed, the yang spirit will be a mixed spirit. Though it may wish to soar into the heavens, it will be like a needle hidden in silk or water mixed with oil—unable to merge. Thus, one must rely on nine years of nurturing to accomplish the work of emerging from the embryo and refining emptiness, refining until one reaches utter nothingness.\n\nIn brief: the yang spirit of refining the heart is *xing* (nature); the yang spirit of refining emptiness is *fan* (return). Between *xing* and *fan*, it is not something humans can force.\n\nSomeone asks: If, as you say, the yang spirit refined through the heart can emerge without the effort of nurturing, and emerging too early is criticized in the alchemical classics, what does this mean?\n\nThe master replies: What I have transmitted to you is the supreme vehicle of refining the heart. From this, the embryo formed is a sacred embryo; from this, the spirit that emerges is a sage. Radiating great light, transcending the three realms, uniting with the great void and enduring eternally, outlasting heaven and earth without decay—this is the wondrous path of cultivation practiced by the ancient buddhas of the West.\n\nAlas, the teachers of this world know only how to refine *ming* (destiny) and not how to refine *xing* (nature). They know only the methods of opening the passes, closing the breath, shifting the furnace, and changing the crucible, but not the principle that true nature is originally empty, utterly without thing. The embryo they form is but a mortal embryo; the spirit they produce is but a mortal. They still cannot ascend to heaven, still cannot join the ranks of the sages. With no other recourse, they must begin the work anew, sending this child to cultivate the Dao and refine truth, to awaken the heart and see nature—making the solid empty, the existent nonexistent. This is what is meant by seeking the root through its branches.",

      "translated_text": "Just as a man who is fundamentally weak and also afflicted with wind-cold—if an ignorant physician merely seeks to supplement his weakness, thereby reinforcing the wind-cold along with it—how can the illness be dispelled? The Daoist art of refining *ming* is the medicine that supplements the original; the art of refining the heart is the medicine that removes illness. If one wishes to refine *ming*, one must first refine *xing*; if one wishes to supplement the primordial, one must first clear away the杂病 and remove them—this is an immutable principle. Thus, those who cultivate with utmost dedication place singular importance on refining the heart. When the last speck of primordial spirit is dredged clean, it shines like the moon reflected in water. When the fire-tending reaches its moment, the embryo of spirit becomes complete. Lifting the lid of the crucible, one leaps free from the wheel of rebirth, and all within heaven and earth transforms into a single mass of purple-golden radiance, ascending to penetrate the Three Pure Realms and descending to pervade the Six Paths. Then the Most High Lord of the Primordial and the Ancient Buddha Vairocana will joyfully come to meet, clasping hands to recount the long separation, lamenting only that the reunion came so late. This is near at hand in but an instant—what need is there to speak of nine years of nurturing?\n\nThe practice of regulating the breath serves to gather the scattered mind. If one can inwardly observe in stillness, moment by moment, what need is there for counting? Only when still observation reaches the point where not a single thought arises may one use intention to seek the Mysterious Pass. Yet if it is said that not a single thought arises, why then use intention to seek? One must understand that the method of using intention has its subtlety: it is to attend within the absence of mind, like one who tends a fire—though no flame is seen, the fire does not go out. When all realms are empty, a sudden awakening arises—what else could this be but the Mysterious Pass? From this point, one must clearly recognize this mechanism. It is like someone riding a thousand-mile steed, galloping without a trace of dust; if I wish to recognize the rider on that horse, I need only glance once, firmly fixing in mind the three hairs on his cheek, vivid before my eyes—only then does the Mysterious Pass truly become mine.\n\nImmortality beyond death, transcending beyond the ten thousand kalpas, all depends on this single awakening to take charge for me. The ten thousand transformations all depend on this single awakening as their pivot. Yet this awakening is no easy matter. Priceless treasures like luminous pearls and fine jade may be sought through wisdom and effort, but this single awakening cannot be obtained through wisdom or effort. Yet it is also not a difficult matter. Though one may wander to the ends of the earth, it is originally near at hand—each person possesses it, and it costs not a single coin to acquire.\n\nSome may ask: \"In refining the elixir, should there not be concrete effort? Why rely on this single awakening?\" I reply: This single awakening is most rare since the beginningless beginning. The Supreme Ultimate obtained this single awakening and gave birth to heaven and earth; our bodies possess this single awakening and become immortals and buddhas. In total, there are two such awakenings. But when and where is this awakening to be sought? It is found in the moment when stillness reaches its extreme and movement begins. It is not present in stillness, nor in movement—it appears for but a single breath, and after that breath, it is no longer seen.\n\n**Scroll Two**\nThe Southern Culmen Heavenly Palace, the Azure Radiance Supreme Emperor;",

Those who grasp this teaching may speak of the yang spirit.\n\nQuestion: What is the meaning of the term \"aperture\" in \"the Mysterious Pass’s single aperture\"?\nThe Master said: \"Aperture\" signifies utmost emptiness.\nWherever things are empty, they respond readily when touched—people call into a well and the echo answers within; wind sounds and the resonance enters the valley’s depths. Such is the natural principle.\nWhen the human heart is empty of things, within this utmost emptiness, should something touch it, the moment and opportunity align, and suddenly there is movement. This moment of sudden movement is where the single spark of numinous light alights.\nAs the *Book of Changes* says: \"Still and unmoving, yet when stimulated, it penetrates all things under heaven.\" This is what it means.\n\nQuestion: When the Supreme Ultimate generates the Two Modes, does it do so through accumulation?\nThe Master said: Qi may accumulate, but spirit does not.\nWhen this mechanism arrives, it is the source of beginning and birth, with no gap between.\nThus, once the Supreme Ultimate establishes its foundation, the myriad forms all emerge from this origin.\nQuestion: How do the Limitless and the Supreme Ultimate differ?\nWithin this lies the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass—this is how the Limitless and the Supreme Ultimate divide.\nThe Limitless is the Supreme Ultimate; this is an unchanging truth.\nI speak only of the Supreme Ultimate, not the Limitless, for this reason.\nFearing you may not understand, I say again: the Limitless is the Supreme Ultimate.\nThe Limitless is ○; the Supreme Ultimate is ⊙.\nYet with the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass, the names \"Limitless\" and \"Supreme Ultimate\" diverge—though in reality, there is no division.\nTo say the Supreme Ultimate generates heaven and earth, and that when heaven and earth divide, the Supreme Ultimate is thereby separated, seems plausible.\nYet when heaven and earth divide, the Supreme Ultimate is never divided—it remains undifferentiated, just as it was before heaven and earth were born.\nThe *Doctrine of the Mean* says: \"Speak of the great, and nothing under heaven can contain it\"—the Supreme Ultimate encompasses heaven and earth; \"speak of the small, and nothing under heaven can break it\"—the Supreme Ultimate enters all things.\nUnited with heaven and earth, it is a single Supreme Ultimate; divided among the myriad things, each possesses a Supreme Ultimate—how then can the Supreme Ultimate be divided?\nYet when yin and yang separate to become heaven and earth, why is this?\nThis is the function of the Supreme Ultimate, not its essence.\nYin and yang are the functions of the Supreme Ultimate.\nBeyond heaven and earth, within heaven and earth—it is still the Supreme Ultimate that pervades and infuses all.\nIf the Supreme Ultimate were destroyed, heaven and earth would be destroyed; yet when heaven and earth are destroyed, the Supreme Ultimate ultimately remains undestroyed.\nWhy? Because it is empty and numinous—empty, thus without form; numinous, thus everlasting. How could it be destroyed?\nTherefore, those who refine the elixir restore the essence of the Supreme Ultimate, and the elixir is complete.\n\nWhat connection does my teaching of the Mysterious Pass’s single awakening have with elixir refinement?\nYou do not realize that when one perceives the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass, this utterly empty and numinous thing is wholly present within one’s own heart.\nThis wholeness is the Supreme Ultimate—the Supreme Ultimate of spirit refinement.\nWith this Supreme Ultimate, yang ascends above, yin descends below, and they congeal into the elixir—just as the Supreme Ultimate generates heaven and earth. This is the Supreme Ultimate of form refinement.\nThe elixir is singular.\nOnly the Dao is without counterpart, hence it is called the elixir.\nHeaven attains the One and becomes clear; earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; valleys attain the One and become full; humans attain the One and attain longevity.\nThe One is singular.\nThus, I explain it as singularity, the meaning of \"one.\"\nThe Supreme Ultimate generates yin and generates yang—yin and yang are counterparts, so why is it called singular?\nThe Supreme Ultimate has never possessed yin or yang; it is simply one.\nDoes it generate yin and yang at the moment when the Two Modes are about to divide?\nAll things arise from duality, but the Supreme Ultimate is one—how could it generate yin and yang?\nI do not speak of the Supreme Ultimate; let us speak of Fuxi’s single stroke. What does this signify?\nDuality generates, but singularity does not.\nWhy did Fuxi not draw two strokes but only one?\nThe *Doctrine of the Mean* says: \"As a thing, it is without duality.\" Without duality, it is one.\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao.\" One yin, one yang are the functions of the Dao.\nAs for the essence of the Dao, it is without yin or yang, yet it is the root of yin and yang.\nThus, the Supreme Ultimate has no yin or yang—does yin and yang arise at the moment when the Two Modes are about to divide?\nIf the Supreme Ultimate has no yin or yang, then what is this single thing ○?\nIt is spirit.\nSpirit is the body of transformation.

      "translated_text": "Then is the Supreme Ultimate one? Is it singular?\nIn the human body, every part comes in pairs—reversing this duality yields the elixir.\nWhere lies the Way to reverse duality and return to singularity?\nIt is said: attain emptiness and guard stillness, and one returns to singularity.\nThe elixir *is* the Supreme Ultimate.\nThe Ultimateless is the Supreme Ultimate—one becomes two, two becomes one.\n\nA question arises: Master, you previously spoke of the Mysterious Pass as a single aperture, through which the Ultimateless and Supreme Ultimate divide. This seems to imply qi precedes spirit. Yet now you say the Supreme Ultimate’s singularity ○ is spirit, which seems to imply spirit precedes qi. I pray the Master, with your all-penetrating wisdom and boundless eloquence, resolve this disciple’s doubt.\n\nThe Master replies: The Supreme Ultimate generates qi through spirit—yet in division, there is no true division. Consider fire in the void: the nature of fire is inherently void. If we say the void contains fire, then all mountains, rivers, gardens, forests, and grasses should burn away. Yet if we say the nature of fire is void, then void clinging to void—where is its foundation? When two voids meet, from where does their nature arise?\nThe Supreme Ultimate’s relation to yin and yang is the same. The Supreme Ultimate is without yin or yang, yet the origin of yin and yang is contained within it. If the Supreme Ultimate first possessed yin and yang, and only then did numinous radiance descend into it, then what is called the Supreme Ultimate would be vanishingly small. Only in its undifferentiated, misty, and boundless state—neither visible as yin and yang nor divisible into yin and yang—does the stirring of the Mysterious Pass cause yin and yang to separate, giving rise to heaven and earth, from which nothing does not proceed. It is like a fire-starting mirror: no fire is seen within it, yet when the sun shines upon it, the mugwort ignites and burns the hand. From this, what can be called prior, and what posterior?\n\nThe questioner asks: Master, you say the Supreme Ultimate’s ○ is spirit—then is this undifferentiated, misty, and boundless state qi or spirit? Does spirit arise from within, or enter from without? This disciple gathers his spirit and sharpens his hearing to receive the Dharma-sound.\n\nThe Master replies: Before the One True is pierced, it is called undifferentiated. When the primordial unity first stirs, it is called misty and boundless.\nSpirit generates qi, qi generates essence—this is how the Supreme Ultimate proceeds in sequence. Essence transforms into qi, qi transforms into spirit—this is how humans reverse the process to become immortals, returning to the origin and restoring the primordial.\nSpirit does not arise from within, nor does it enter from without. If it arose from within, then the Supreme Ultimate would exist before spirit, first forming a singular ○ to await spirit’s generation. But the Supreme Ultimate does not await anything. If it entered from without, then the Supreme Ultimate’s vastness—so great it has no exterior—where could it enter from? The Supreme Ultimate has no exterior.\nIf spirit is neither within nor without, then from where does it begin? It begins naturally. But where does the natural begin? Where there is the Supreme Ultimate, there is spirit.\nYet even the word *begins* should not be applied. The Supreme Ultimate *is* spirit as the Supreme Ultimate.\nYet even the word *is* should not be applied. The Supreme Ultimate *is* spirit, spirit *is* the Supreme Ultimate.\nYet even the word *is* should not be applied. Once thought or explanation arises, it is no longer the Supreme Ultimate.\nIn sum, the ○ fulfills the meaning of the Supreme Ultimate. What is exterior or interior, beginning or non-beginning?\nIt is like fire in stone or fire in a mirror: from where does this fire begin, and from when? Does it arise from within, or enter from without? If we say it begins when the stone is formed or the mirror is cast, then before the stone existed or the mirror was made, where was the fire? If we say it arises from within the stone or mirror, then why does the stone not turn to ash, or the mirror melt? If we say it enters from without, then metal and stone are utterly hard—how could there be cracks for it to seep through? At this point, analogy and discussion fail.\nThen how does it truly begin, and how does it arise?\nAll things begin from emptiness. The Supreme Ultimate *is* emptiness. Emptiness encountering emptiness—there is no subtlety that is not empty. Emptiness returning to emptiness—what nature is not the same?\nEmptiness gives birth to one, one gives birth to the myriad things. The myriad things return to one, one returns to emptiness. Emptiness is the ancestor of the myriad things.\nScholars must see true emptiness, not false emptiness. They must see numinous emptiness, not inert emptiness. They must see complete emptiness, not partial emptiness. They must see emptiness of nature, not emptiness of form. They must see void emptiness, not solid emptiness. They must see constant emptiness, not strange emptiness. They must see original emptiness, not past emptiness. They must see the emptiness of immortals and buddhas, not the emptiness of heterodox paths. They must see the emptiness of the sun, moon, stars, mountains, rivers, gardens, forests, grasses—all that has form and image—not the emptiness of frost, bubbles, shadows, stone sparks, or lightning, which leave no trace and are called empty.\nIs the elixir the body of metal?\nHeaven-one generates water, but water has no metal mother—how can it generate? Thus I say: singular.\nThe elixir embodies the meaning of singularity.\nAnother explanation: singular means one, taking the meaning of Heaven-one.\nEarth-four generates metal, but when water generates, metal does not yet exist. Yet the qi of yin and yang flowing down from the Supreme Ultimate contains the Five Phases within it. The nature of metal is complete within, and the Supreme Ultimate’s utterly empty, numinous, bright, and pure virtue—its nature is the nature of metal, its color is the color of metal, presiding over the Five Phases.\nThus when yin and yang separate, the first thing generated is water—mother gives birth to child. Earth-four generates metal, but this refers to formed substance, not the time of formlessness and insubstantiality.\nHow do we know the Supreme Ultimate is the nature and color of metal?\nWhen those who attain the Dao realize perfect clarity, wondrous awakening, and the primordial, their bodies appear golden, and their heads radiate golden light. Perfect clarity, wondrous awakening, and the primordial are the body of the Supreme Ultimate, and golden light and golden color respond immediately.",

      "translated_text": "Daoist adepts in refining the elixir first seek the Supreme Ultimate within the body, and the elixir they form resembles a grain of purple gold. When the yang spirit manifests, the entire body takes on the hue of refined purple gold. How could the Supreme Ultimate alone not be thus? Moreover, in reasoning through the Five Phases, only metal’s nature is most empty, and only emptiness endures. All things empty resound, and metal resounds—thus we know its emptiness. Metal’s nature is also most dynamic; movement engenders numinosity, and numinosity enables transformation, as known through the child it generates. Metal’s child is water, whose nature flows without cease, mirroring its mother. By the child’s nature we know the mother: the Supreme Ultimate is that which is empty yet numinous, its color golden light, its nature the nature of metal.\n\nRefining the elixir is refining the One. What is meant by refining the One? The One is Heavenly One, and Heavenly One is metal. The Supreme Ultimate is the nature of metal—this is the wondrousness of spontaneity, not of formed substance. Thus, those who refine the elixir refine metal into pure gold, and the elixir is complete.\n\nWithin the human body, all Five Phases are present, yet metal is foremost. Why? Heavenly One generates water, and water is metal’s child. No thing is born without a mother. Know that the precelestial single point of true gold resides within the human body, and the human voice is the metal within. Consider the Five Phases: does wood have sound? Wood’s sound is hollow. Does water have sound? Water’s sound is rushing. Does fire have sound? Fire’s sound is roaring. Does earth have sound? Earth’s sound is rumbling. Only metal’s sound rings clear. Thus, when an infant emerges from the womb, its first cry rings forth—metal is the cause. Metal, being empty, resounds; when the child departs the mother’s womb, it becomes empty and thus can resound. The mother nurtures the child, and metal dwells with water. Water is what Heavenly One generates. Wherever earthly metal is found, white qi rises upward. The essence within the human body is white in color—this is the qi of metal. Thus, those who refine the elixir gather the blossom exhaled by primordial essence, combining it with the mercury of the Li trigram to form the elixir. When the fire timing is complete, golden light radiates outward—this is its original nature.\n\nYet metal fears the scorching of fire and melts upon encountering it. How then does the metal of the Kan trigram approach the fire of the Li trigram? In terms of symbolic resonance, metal’s long life begins at *si*, which is fire. People only know that metal fears fire, but metal truly loves fire—this they do not know. How do we see this? When metal lies within earth, only earth is visible, not metal. Only when true fire presses upon it does earth’s qi disperse and metal’s form appear, like a child in the womb unable to emerge until the stirring of numinous impulse reveals the three luminaries. Fire is metal’s numinous impulse. Thus, where metal lies within earth, frost and snow cannot settle above it. Metal loves to be born from fire, for it originally bears fire’s nature. Therefore, bringing the metal of Kan to the fire of Li is returning to its origin and following its preference. The elixir as metal is thus expansively realized.\n\nVague thoughts are not intent; wandering thoughts are delusive imaginings. Intent arises truly and directly from the heart. Once intent arises, the heart becomes empty again—thus it is also said: \"Have intent as if without intent.\" Great is the function of intent! At first, when yang arises, it is intent. After it arises, gathering the original yang is intent. After gathering, uniting in the spirit chamber is intent. After uniting, sending it into the Yellow Court is intent. Great is the function of intent! Nor is this all: the emergence of the yang spirit is intent. After emerging, riding the void and soaring on the wind is intent. Roaming the celestial realm and returning to the spirit chamber is intent. Great is the function of intent!\n\nSomeone may ask: Can the yang spirit eat, drink, and speak? Does it have viscera? The answer: it can be said to have them, and it can be said not to. What does it mean to have them?",
      "overlap_context": "ild. Earth-four generates metal, but this refers to formed substance, not the time of formlessness and insubstantiality.\nHow do we know the Supreme Ultimate is the nature and color of metal?\nWhen those who attain the Dao realize perfect clarity, wondrous awakening, and the primordial, their bodies appear golden, and their heads radiate golden light. Perfect clarity, wondrous awakening, and the primordial are the body of the Supreme Ultimate, and golden light and golden color respond immediately.",

      "translated_text": "After ten months, a radiant child is born—able to laugh, to speak, to eat and drink, to walk and move. If it had no viscera, it would be but a puppet; who would govern its speech and actions? Therefore I say it *has* them.\n\nWhat does it mean to say it *has no* them? The yang spirit is utterly empty and without substance. It casts no shadow by day, leaves no tracks in mud, enters fire without scorching, enters water without wetting. It can conceal its form within metal or stone, or transform into creatures that fly, swim, move, or grow. If it had form or substance, how could it turn and revolve with such perfect freedom, its transformations unobstructed? Therefore I say it *has no* them.\n\nThen is the yang spirit truly existent, or truly nonexistent? I say: if it were existent, then all things between Heaven and Earth would be yang spirit; if it were nonexistent, then originally there would be nothing within my heart. The loftiest adepts merge with the Dao in truth. The Dao transforms the ten thousand images and assumes form according to things—thus the existence of the yang spirit is certain. The Dao is without form or sound, yet embraces Heaven and Earth. From emptiness it generates the One, from the One it generates the myriad things; the myriad things return to the One, the One returns to emptiness. Emptiness moves emptiness—only then is the work of transformation revealed. Thus the nonexistence of the yang spirit is certain.\n\nThe student must grasp this fundamental principle, then they will not be deluded by illusory forms or illusory thoughts. Whether the yang spirit is accomplished or not, whether it emerges or not, may be left to nature.\n\nThe Way of forming the elixir is simply *one*. Attain the One, and all things are complete. The One is unity—can it be named or spoken of? It can. The One is nothing else: it is emptiness alone. Since I began discussing the Dao with you, I have spoken only of this single word: *emptiness*. Refining the heart is emptiness; employing intent is emptiness; gathering the medicine is emptiness; forming the embryo is emptiness; the firing process is emptiness; the yang spirit is emptiness; refining emptiness is returning emptiness to emptiness; the Mysterious Pass is awakening to emptiness through emptiness. A thousand emptinesses, ten thousand emptinesses—all are but one emptiness.\n\nThis emptiness is not the emptiness of mere void, but the emptiness of true fullness; not the emptiness of dispersion, but the emptiness of perfect wholeness. Thus it is called the One.\n\nIf I do not speak of emptiness, so be it. But if I do, observe: within your body, is each part empty, or is each part substantial? Originally, all is empty, yet you make all substantial. The heart is originally empty, yet you make it substantial with sense-objects. The spirit is originally empty, yet you make it substantial with thoughts and worries. Essence is originally empty, yet you make it substantial with lust and desire. Qi is originally empty, yet you make it substantial with toil and disturbance. Intent is originally empty, yet you make it substantial with joy, anger, sorrow, and fear. The nose is originally empty, yet you make it substantial with excessive smelling. The ears are originally empty, yet you make them substantial with excessive hearing. The eyes are originally empty, yet you make them substantial with excessive seeing. The mouth is originally empty, yet you make it substantial with excessive speech. The hands and feet are originally empty, yet you make them substantial with reckless action. The pores are originally empty, yet you make them substantial with foulness and filth.\n\nOriginally, each part is empty, but through you, each becomes substantial. Thus body and heart are shackled by the substantial. Alas! This most empty of things meets with you, the most substantial of beings—like feathers entering water, unable to take flight, destined only to rot.\n\nHow then to return to emptiness? The Confucians say *stop*; the Daoists say *stillness*; the Buddhists say *samādhi*. Ceaselessly dissolve the substantial, like a vat filled with filth—removing it requires effort. But if one can instantly realize the original state, in an instant transcend the leakless, like a swift wind sweeping away dust, like the sun melting snow—this is supreme awakening. The elixir is formed, the primordial transformed in the blink of an eye.\n\nSomeone asks: Human delusions all arise from perception. How can one make perception as if it were not perception?\n\nThe master replies: Excellent question! Of the sense faculties, perception does the greatest harm. You ask how to make perception as if it were not perception—only by preserving the spirit and settling the heart. There are three essentials.\n\nFirst, in the moment before awareness arises, nurture it as the moon in empty space—limpid, pure, and bright, without dregs, unmoving yet ever aware. Beautiful forms and seductive sounds are ultimately one with my nature. Things are not different from me, nor I from things. Things and I are undivided; the spirit does not linger or depart, but abides always in the heart.\n\nSecond, at the moment awareness is about to arise, remain alert and undimmed, every response measured and harmonious, like the strings of a zither producing the sound of perfect harmony, resonating at the touch, subtly comprehended yet unattached to things. Thus it arises yet does not arise, and the spirit abides in the heart.\n\nThird, at the interchange of awareness, discern clearly, perceive the subtle workings, like a chariot’s horses—twenty-four hooves moving in perfect accord, many horses moving as one, many hooves moving as one hoof. Like clouds drifting, like water flowing, all arises naturally, without allowing dust to mingle within. Thus it flows unimpeded, turning through the great void, and the spirit abides in the heart.\n\nThough there is perception, the spirit is separate from it. Though the spirit is in the eyes, perception and spirit are one.",

      "translated_text": "What is meant by \"the spirit being separate from perception\"? When an object touches perception, perception does not cling to the object; when perception touches an object, the object does not cling to perception. Like the light of a mirror reflecting an image, the image never has the intention to enter the mirror, nor does the mirror have the intention to touch the object—where then is the spirit’s wandering?\n\nWhat is meant by \"perception and spirit being one\"? Where there is no object, there is no perception, yet the nature of perception is not destroyed; where there is perception and an object, the nature of perception does not arise. Myriad forms pass beyond, while the one true reality is contained within. Like fire within beryl glass, it illuminates all things in the room, yet the fire remains within the beryl, not outside it—where then is the spirit’s wandering?\n\nIn sum, still illumination remains ever bright, and the true spirit abides in freedom. The sun and moon may end, but the eye of wisdom is boundless. Have you not seen the fish? The fish does not see the water, and its nature is at ease; if the fish were to see the water, its nature would be wearied. Perception should be as if non-perception—this is the proper view.\n\nLiuxia Hui embraced a woman without seeing her as a woman. Refining the elixir and refining the heart are ultimately one and the same.\n\nRefining the heart means refining the heart that one possesses; refining the elixir means refining the elixir that is fundamentally non-existent. The heart is called \"having,\" the elixir is called \"non-having\"—what is having, and what is non-having? There is a subtle principle herein.\n\nThe heart takes spirit as its sovereign. When the spirit abides in the heart, the elixir is mine to possess; when the spirit wanders toward external things, then I do not possess the heart. Without possessing the heart, the fire blazes, and when the fire blazes, the mercury is exhausted—the great medicine loses its unity.\n\nThough the Great Way values non-mind, the \"having\" within non-having is true having. Refining the heart means refining the heart that exists within non-having.\n\nThe elixir takes essence as its foundation—this is not the essence of sexual union. The essence of sexual union is mixed with the fire of desire, water carrying fire within, its flavor salty and unusable. Thus, seawater can be boiled to produce salt. The sea is the valley of water; gazing from high ridges at deep night, one often sees flames scorching the sky, floating upon the water’s surface—this is its proof.\n\nThe great elixir is formless, soundless, colorless, and tasteless—how could it admit the essence tainted by impure fire? Therefore, one must gather primordial essence, a single point of pure emptiness, seemingly present yet absent, to congeal the numinous elixir. From this, a child of bare redness leaps forth. Though this child may seem to have form and appearance, in truth it is formless and imageless.\n\nRefining the fundamentally non-existent essence to forge the fundamentally non-existent elixir, nurturing the fundamentally non-existent child—thus, refining the elixir means refining the elixir that is fundamentally non-existent within having.\n\nIf the spirit does not guard its dwelling, it becomes non-mind; with non-mind, the child lacks numinosity, capable only of donning clothes and eating meals, but not of studying scriptures or discoursing on the Dao. If the essence is not primordial essence, it becomes brine; with brine, the child cannot be nurtured. Though a fetus may form, it will fail halfway, like a woman’s miscarriage, never revealing its true form.\n\nThus, the heart must have, yet also perceive the having within non-mind; the elixir must be non-having, yet also be the non-having within having. The interplay of having and non-having is the mechanism of transformation—this is called the Supreme Way.\n\nRefining the elixir is not a matter of busyness; only when there is nothing to do is it truly refining the elixir. If one can attain nothing-to-do, reaching the state of fasting the mind and sitting in forgetfulness, why refine the elixir at all? When the elixir reaches the point of not needing refinement, one is truly adept at refining the elixir.\n\nThose in the world who cling to refining the elixir treat it as a grand affair, earth-shaking and heaven-startling. Alas! This very intention distances them from the elixir. The Dao takes naturalness as its宗. The Supreme Ultimate gives birth to heaven and earth—this too is most ordinary, most plain, unknowing and unaware, transforming emptiness with emptiness, uniting reality with reality.\n\nWithin the human body is the Supreme Ultimate. Since there is the Supreme Ultimate, when yang ascends above, it is the birth of heaven; when yin descends below, it is the birth of earth. Heaven and earth in chaos remain a single empty and numinous Supreme Ultimate containing the primordial—nothing strange about it.\n\nWithout relying on thought or action, sitting calmly in a room, desiring benevolence and benevolence arrives—using what the body possesses as the body’s great elixir, like a wealthy household, dressing and eating, drawing from the palace with abundance.\n\nOne has one’s own nature—go and perceive it; one has one’s own life—go and establish it. The elixir way has no other aim but these two words: nature and life.\n\nPeople today discard nature and life, hastening death and attributing it to fate. Could it be that those who awaken to truth and ascend as immortals are fated for eternal life, transcending the three realms? How laughable!\n\nThe Buddhist sutras say: \"Neither arising nor ceasing.\" People today create illness through excessive arising. With deluded thoughts arise deluded dust, with deluded dust arise deluded realms, with deluded realms arise deluded karma—turning and turning, arising without end. Arising must cease, and with cessation must come arising, entangling for ten thousand kalpas, turning and turning in deeper delusion.\n\nIn an instant, a thought suddenly arises, a thought suddenly ceases—this very thought is the cause of life and death. With thought comes form; a form suddenly arises, a form suddenly ceases—this very form is the ground of life and death. With form comes object; an object suddenly arises, an object suddenly ceases—this very object is the condition of life and death.\n\nIn a single day, people undergo life and death, revolving in the sea of desire, tens, hundreds, thousands of times—yet the transformations of illusory form are but distant echoes.\n\nSome may ask: If the Supreme Ultimate gives birth to heaven and earth, what is meant by \"not arising\"? I say: The Supreme Ultimate gives birth to heaven and earth, yet there is that which does not arise with heaven and earth—thus, the Supreme Ultimate does not cease.",

      "translated_text": "To refine what cannot be refined—how then can the elixir be an elixir? Refine emptiness until it is truly emptiness, and the elixir is complete. Emptiness holds no thing—what then is there to refine? If you would refine the elixir, you must refine where there is nothing to refine. When you refine and produce nothing, when in the end there is nothing, then the Great Elixir resides within you.\n\nThe supreme Dao is originally without anything to be called Dao; the supreme elixir is originally without anything to be called elixir. To cling to form and seek it is to turn far from the Way. Consider your own body—what in it is truly real? Your hands? Feet? Ears, eyes, mouth, nose? Liver, kidneys, lungs, intestines? Heart, gall, bones, blood? Emotions, perceptions, thoughts, reflections? If you can extract even one thing and truly recognize it as yours, then refine that thing you recognize as yours. Yet on closer reflection, all are illusory forms, unrelated to the true self. Not only are they unrelated, but these very things burden you, preventing you from becoming an immortal or a buddha. Now, cast all these aside and seek the one thing that is truly yours—the root of non-birth and non-death. Then longevity is yours, transcending the three realms is yours, soaring transformations—what is there that is not yours? Why then allow form-bound things to encumber the formless essence?\n\nAlas! The common run of people, busy and blind, believe they seek life, yet in truth they seek death—how pitiable! You, who neither crave glory nor profit, nor indulge in wine and sensuality, are truly fit for the Way. Yet if the moment has not arrived, if you remain mired in the surging red dust, gazing toward the clouds with no path to ascend, you are like a thousand-mile steed trapped beneath a salt cart—helpless. For now, rest your heart and await it. If you can dwell in the red dust while your heart abides in empty waves, ever seeing your nature and ceaselessly cultivating your body, then even if a fire-mountain blazes with ten-thousand-foot radiance, a single drop of nectar from your silver vase will extinguish its flames in an instant. This is true cultivation of the Way, true refinement of the elixir. The longer and deeper you persist, unwavering and tireless, the more surely will immortals descend to bestow upon you sacred texts and precious talismans, making you a teacher of immortals in this world. Strive on—do not dismiss my words as false.\n\nThose who refine the elixir must not hold the thought of \"refining the elixir\" in their hearts at all. Even if a golden elixir were to appear in your palm, and someone snatched it away, you would feel no concern, regard it as nothing special, and harbor no grudge—only then are you truly one who refines the elixir. The elixir is a sacred treasure, unlike pearls or jade—why then treat it as unworthy, even slighting it? Would this not be a grave error? Know this: if one who refines the elixir lacks this magnanimous heart, no matter how many years they refine, the elixir will never be achieved. Why? The elixir is the embodiment of emptiness; to grasp it with a mind of attachment is to lose the elixir.\n\nThus, before refining, act as if you have no desire to refine; after refining, act as if you possess no elixir. Ascending into pure emptiness, roaming the azure heavens, wandering amidst golden radiance and jade light, strolling beneath pearl palaces and jasper towers—you should feel as if you have seen nothing at all. Treat extraordinary realms as ordinary, and immortals as common folk; regard all as naturally belonging, like your daily clothes and meals, routine and familiar. This is the heroic spirit, the seed of a true immortal—what Mencius called \"the unmoving heart.\"\n\nConsider one who obtains a luminous pearl: if they see it as a mere pebble, then the pearl and I forget each other, the pearl rests in me, and I rest in the pearl—what joy! But if they treat it as a pearl, constantly caressing and remembering it, then the pearl becomes a burden. With burden, the heart is not empty; with an unempty heart, one turns from the Way.\n\nA man of Chu obtained a jade cup and treasured it above all. Fearing damage, he placed it in a casket, wrapped in brocade—one might call this careful safekeeping. Yet he would lift it to gaze, then put it back, only to take it out again. His eyes grew weary, his hands trembled, and in a moment of carelessness, he struck the casket and shattered the jade. So it is with the elixir: to regard it lightly is to truly cherish it; to see it as a rare treasure is to harm it.",

      "translated_text": "Even the firing times must be plain and ordinary—whether intentional or unintentional, neither forgetting nor forcing, letting it operate on its own. When the water arrives, the channel forms; when the firewood is ample, the meat softens. The talk of precise measurements and minute adjustments is enough to mislead. Those who boast of their own profundity spread such theories, confusing learners into believing that elixir-refining is the most difficult of tasks, known only to themselves! Alas, I have perused countless alchemical classics and diagrams, all claiming that the firing times must be secretly transmitted, passed from heart to heart—who would have known that the truth lies in the utterly commonplace and easy, the unremarkable and plain? Since you are devoted to the Way, I shall reveal this with a single word, passing it down to the world so that countless seekers may spare themselves needless effort. This is my great hidden merit and boundless salvation.\n\nBones stronger than flesh, the hun more potent than the po—though lean, no harm comes of it. The only concern is that the heart-fire burns too fiercely; when fire blazes, the blood dries. At midday, speak little and think less, close your eyes to nurture spirit, regulate your breath to cultivate qi. Let your body be like floating clouds, expanding and contracting at will. When things come to touch you, do not cling to them. Practice this long enough, and all illnesses will vanish, body and mind at ease. This is no difficult matter—it can be maintained in both movement and stillness.\n\nMaster Shao said:\n*\"In stillness, observing the myriad things, all is self-attained;\nThe joys of the four seasons are shared by all.\"*\nThese are the words of one who has gained insight into the Way. See how clear and luminous his mind is, how joyful! He is a living, vibrant immortal.\n\nFrom ancient times, those who ascended to the mysterious have taken a thousand years to enter the registers of immortality, or several lifetimes to tread the cloud paths. The least time required is a hundred years, or sixty or seventy; even the shortest takes thirty or forty, or ten or twenty, before a true immortal comes to guide them. Yet you hope for extraordinary encounters with a hundred days of effort—such a thing has never existed since ancient times! I make this pact with you: if you cultivate diligently without slackening, unwavering as a single day for three years, I promise that the conditions for your immortal destiny will align, and your ascent will have its steps. Take care and exert yourself—do not disappoint my hopes!\n\nThough essence, qi, and spirit are named as three, in truth they are one. When worldly attachments remain unsevered and distracting thoughts swirl, essence, qi, and spirit each go their separate ways to respond. But when the perfected one dwells in purity and sits in forgetfulness, how can essence, qi, and spirit be divided? The Supreme One speaks not of the elixir but of the Dao—there is good reason for this. When muddied, they appear as three; when clarified, they are one. The three are neither spirit, nor qi, nor essence; the one is spirit, is essence, is qi—whole and undivided, a single Supreme Ultimate, a grain of golden elixir. In movement, it contains all things; in stillness, it illumines the ten directions. It is the mechanism of utmost numinosity, the image of undividedness—its wonders cannot be fully expressed.\n\nIn speaking of the Way with you, I have been both profound and thorough. Knowing it is not difficult; practicing it is not easy. If you can delve deeply, grasp its essential meaning, harmonize it within your heart, and embody it in action, even if you do not immediately ascend in broad daylight, you will still be a realized person of the Way. Heavenly spirits will attend you, your Dao-body will be perfectly rounded, your spiritual root eternally wondrous—truly, you will be numbered among the immortals.\n\nThe essence of the Way is nothing more than emptiness. Emptiness contains the ten thousand images; though the world may be destroyed, emptiness is indestructible. As the *Daoist Canon* says: *\"When form and spirit are both wondrous, they merge with the true Dao.\"* The Dao is nothing else—it is emptiness alone. When form and spirit are both wondrous, they are both empty.\n\nIn all my teachings of the Way, from refining the heart to ascending in broad daylight, there is but this single thread—no other path allows one to depart in the morning and arrive by evening. Have you grasped this clearly?\n\nNature and life are like jade interlocking rings—inseparable. Yet those who cultivate the Way today, daunted by the difficulty of nature-work, begin with life-cultivation, busying themselves with the interplay of Kan and Li, water and fire. Though the embryo may form and the spirit emerge, if the roots of worldly dust are not scoured away and one does not directly transcend the leaky, then in the moments of ascension and transformation, there will still be some obstruction. The realm of pure emptiness and mysterious clarity will not permit a foothold. To roam the great emptiness, becoming one with it, will be difficult indeed.\n\nThe ability to sever birth and death, to escape the wheel of rebirth, comes entirely from the resolution of nature-work. If this is not thoroughly understood, even if the infant is nurtured to maturity, it remains a vulgar man, a stubborn child. Though it may rise halfway to the heavens, it may yet fall; or after thousands or tens of thousands of years, it may still descend. Why? Because it has not comprehended the character of emptiness—or even if it has, it has not truly attained emptiness.\n\nEven if one first practices life-cultivation and later turns to nature-study, the difficulty remains unresolved. When the yang-spirit first coalesces, the embryonic sac inevitably carries some impure qi. Without further wall-gazing practice, it may be hard to grind and wash it clean. Thus, those who begin with life-cultivation and later turn to nature seek quick results, but this burdens the child so that it cannot become a sacred infant.\n\nThose who proceed from nature to life engage in true learning: the heart must see the true heart, nature must see true nature, spirit must see true spirit, essence must see true essence, qi must see true qi. When nature and life are undivided, one gains both with a single effort. On the day the Way is accomplished, one will hold the rank of a celestial official, transcending the three realms, existing before heaven and earth, enduring after them. This is the true and certain teaching—no matter how flowery the words, they cannot escape these few sentences.\n\nI ask you: Are the Buddhist relics and the Daoist golden elixir the same or different?\n\nThe master said: Buddhism takes seeing nature as its foundation; essence and qi are not its primary concerns. All things arise and perish, but nature neither arises nor perishes.",

      "translated_text": "When the Buddha enters nirvana, this entity is indeed perfectly luminous, transcending the three realms, forever freed from the six paths of rebirth. The residual essence and qi coalesce into relics, which at times radiate light, now hidden, now manifest—such is the Buddha’s divine power. Yet once the Buddha has entered nirvana, the essence and qi left behind are insentient things. How then do they distinguish between concealment and revelation? Who emits the light?\n\nAlas, how can one say they are insentient! Yet neither can one say they are sentient! It is like a luminous pearl emitting light—who is the agent behind it? The pearl is born of the oyster, formed from the oyster’s vital essence. Once the pearl emerges from the oyster, it parts from the oyster’s spiritual nature, yet remains as luminous as the moon, for its essence and qi reside within it.\n\nThe essence, qi, and spirit of the human body are originally one, not two. Buddhism alone emphasizes illuminating the heart and perceiving nature, cultivating wisdom by extracting the radiance of spirit. The remaining essence and qi congeal into form, yet with all defilements extinguished and all knots dissolved, this essence becomes primordial essence, this qi becomes primordial qi. Though not as penetrating or universally illuminating as spirit, they remain numinous substances, hence their light appears and disappears, ever-changing in form. This is the principle behind it. The colors they manifest differ because the treasures of the world vary in hue, their brilliance shifting with their inherent qualities. Essence and qi are the treasures of the human body, which embodies the five phases, hence the five colors—thus the relics appear in different hues.\n\nExtending this reasoning, what Buddhism calls the unborn and undying is spirit, which is nature. The relics are essence and qi, which are life. They cultivate nature but not life, so after entering nirvana, spirit ascends to the void while essence and qi remain in the world. Our Daoist path, however, refines both nature and life, merging essence, qi, and spirit into a single pearl. Through the celestial fire’s alchemy, it gestates into a child as light as a wisp of cloud, as delicate as a maiden, identical to oneself—spirit resides within, essence resides within, qi resides within, indivisible and inseparable.\n\nSome may ask: Even those who cultivate immortality sometimes sit in transformation and produce relics. If they refine both nature and life, why do relics still appear? I reply: If relics appear, their cultivation must have been Buddhist, not Daoist—detailed in nature but neglectful of life. Those who refine both nature and life gather the essence, qi, and spirit of this body so completely that bones and blood dissolve, pores become empty, blood turns to white cream, the body becomes as fine as gossamer, red as the sun, hot as fire, coursing through the limbs and permeating the four extremities, illuminating the boundless and pristine realm. Thus they can ascend or descend, transform at will, and attain perfect freedom. Such is the difference between Buddhism and Daoism.\n\nYet in their essence, both share this: the nature-body is fundamentally empty, the six senses ever still. Unburdened by existence, they can illuminate existence with non-existence. The torch of wisdom knows no bounds, and true suchness remains eternally serene.\n\nIn elixir refinement, yin is exhausted and yang naturally appears; yang flourishes and yin naturally dissolves. The seven emotions and six desires of the human body are all rooted in yin. Uproot this root, and true yang emerges. All things are heavy in yin and light in yang, pure in yang and turbid in yin. The light and pure ascend, the heavy and turbid descend. Thus, when passions and desires rage, none can soar to the heavens. Yin is cold by nature, yang is hot. When the first yang stirs, the great earth returns to spring.\n\nHave you not observed the seasons? In the three months of winter, yang lies dormant, and heaven and earth are closed and obstructed. Modern people, their scheming hearts inwardly active, their essence dried and qi spent, live in perpetual winter—thus their pores wither, their skin wrinkles, no different from the withered scene of winter. When spring arrives, yang qi arises, and the myriad yin retreats in deference—hence the hundred flowers bloom, and the earth’s vitality moistens all. Likewise, when true yang resides within, white hair turns black again, fallen teeth regrow, the skin’s texture becomes fine and dense, lustrous as jade. The seasons of the human body differ in form but share the same principle.\n\nFor those whose passions and desires remain unsevered, their essence is yin essence, not yang essence; their qi is yin qi, not yang qi; their spirit is yin spirit, not yang spirit. Why is essence yin essence? The fire within the body, kindled by passions and desires, is yin fire. When essence is scorched by yin fire, the life-gate’s essence follows the fire and leaks away—thus yang essence is formless, while yin essence has substance. Why is qi yin qi? The qi dispersed throughout the body’s frame is all corpse qi. Yin is stagnant by nature, so when qi flows between the bones and joints, it suddenly becomes obstructed, giving rise to sores and ulcers. But true yang qi steams like fire and billows like clouds. Like fire, it disperses all poisons; like clouds, it unblocks all obstructions—how could sores or ulcers arise?\n\nWhy is spirit yin spirit? Spirit is inherently yang, but driven by the seven emotions and six desires, yin essence and yang qi are buried below, like a lump of charcoal placed in an ice cellar. Heat cannot overcome cold, yang cannot overcome yin, the noble cannot overcome the base. In short, when essence, qi, and spirit are of the primordial, each is yang; when they are of the acquired, each is yin.\n\nConfucius said: \"The Way divides into two: benevolence and its absence.\" **Scroll Three**",

      "translated_text": "The Southern Polar Heavenly Palace, home of the Azure Radiance Supreme Emperor—who proclaimed the mysterious wind in the eras of Fuxi, Shennong, the Yellow Emperor, and Tang; who nurtured the Dao’s lineage through the ages of Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou; who now concealed himself in the pristine court of the Qing dynasty, now revealed his true form in renowned mountains and sacred grottoes; whose divine transformations were unfathomable, whose changes knew no end; who was originally the celestial Year Star, frolicking in the Peach Garden of Paradise; who served as an immortal official among mortals, jesting in the Golden Horse Gate; whose great compassion and great vows, utmost sageliness and utmost benevolence, allowed him to roam the world in leisure, delivering countless beings—this Most High Heavenly Worthy, Supreme Dao Ancestor, and Immortal Master bestows the register.\n\nRefining the elixir is refining nothing at all. Why say it refines nothing? It refines what is absent. Absence is emptiness. The heart is originally empty, yet emotions, perceptions, intentions, and knowledge fill it. Refining the heart to restore its original emptiness allows the elixir to form. Why so? The elixir is originally empty. Thus, when the heart is empty, the elixir may be achieved—from nothing, something is refined. How can something be refined from nothing? Consider: before my birth, I had no five senses, no four great elements, no personal form. Suddenly, a single thought sent me to seize a womb. What was this thought that seized the womb? Where there is spirit, qi naturally follows; where there is qi, essence naturally follows. Entering a womb, after ten months, a human form is complete. Emerging from the Mud Pill Palace, I could then move in and out of existence, ageless in the postnatal world. Had my heart not been empty—had emotions, perceptions, intentions, and knowledge remained scattered—I would still be a human form. Being human, how could I seek another human form? There is no such principle. A human body has but two ears, two eyes, one nose, one mouth, five viscera, six bowels, and four limbs—how could these be doubled? It is utterly impossible. Thus, refining the elixir requires returning the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, viscera, bowels, and limbs entirely to emptiness, as if never born—nothing remains but a single point of spirit-light, luminous and undimmed. Only then may the womb be formed anew, restoring my ears, eyes, mouth, nose, viscera, bowels, and limbs. A single yang spirit emerges—only myself, nothing doubled. Though the yang spirit departs, its ears, eyes, mouth, nose, viscera, bowels, and limbs remain fundamentally empty, never having possessed form. Thus, it may be neither born nor die, merging with the Dao in truth. The Way of elixir-refining is complete herein.\n\nThe study of the Dao takes non-action as its essence. Action arises from non-action, so even summoning wind and rain or uprooting mountains and halting rivers remains within the purview of non-action. Otherwise, every movement, every talisman, every register, failing to grasp the Dao’s origin, is but the trickery of lesser schools. Refine the elixir of non-action, practice the methods of non-action, recite the scriptures of non-action, chant the mantras of non-action: non-action is the body of Heaven, the origin of the Dao. To seek branches and leaves beyond non-action is to stray into heterodox byways. If you align with Heaven’s body and illuminate the Dao’s origin, what difficulty will you have in understanding the *Cavern Scriptures* or mastering all methods? I await your realization.\n\nNon-action is the body of the Dao. The elixir is what is done without doing. The sages of antiquity pitied those who could not attain non-action, so they taught elixir-refining, guiding them to seek action within non-action. Thus, yang is gathered from nothingness—within the indistinct and evanescent, primordial yang arises. Once yang is born, the womb is formed in nothingness. In the profound and obscure, the numinous womb takes shape. Once the womb is formed, the fire of non-action is applied, continuous yet unforced, ever wakeful yet unyielding. After ten months, the yang spirit emerges. Once the spirit emerges, it returns to nothingness. Within the radiance of purple qi, there is something yet not a thing, form yet not form, an image of no-image, a sound of no-sound. Why is this so? Such is the origin of the Dao.",

Spirit is inherently yang, but driven by the seven emotions and six desires, yin essence and yang qi are buried below, like a lump of charcoal placed in an ice cellar.

In short, when essence, qi, and spirit are of the primordial, each is yang; when they are of the acquired, each is yin.\n\nConfucius said: \"The Way divides into two: benevolence and its absence.\" **Scroll Three**",

      "translated_text": "There are three prohibitions in this practice.\n\nFirst, when gathering yang, movement must be avoided. As yang arises, the mind must be fused and concentrated—stillness gives birth to yang, while movement causes it to dissipate. Does yang have form? It takes form through the intent of the practitioner. Spirit transforms into qi; if the spirit is still, how could qi fail to arise? But the slightest movement halts intent, intent ceases, spirit is no longer continuous, and yang expires.\n\nSecond, when forming the elixir, stagnation must be avoided. After the union of yin and yang, swiftly direct the mind to guide that single grain of millet-like pearl back to the Yellow Court, sealing it within the crucible. The slightest delay causes the essence to age, rendering it unable to contain yin. When fire is applied, it becomes restless, and the womb may fail to form.\n\nThird, when applying the fire, violence must be avoided. Once yang is gathered and the womb is formed, the fire of ten months must be as steady as a single day, and the fire of a single day as steady as a single moment—this is pure fire. If the womb is refined in pure fire, it becomes indestructibly firm, enduring across eons, transcending heaven and earth, soaring freely. But if the mind wanders and a thought suddenly intrudes, leading to forced refinement, a restless and impatient qi arises. Even if one sits until breath returns to the origin, it remains violent fire, for it is self-interrupted and artificially imposed.\n\nFrom this, we see that elixir-refining is no easy matter. Only when one knows there is no fire can fire be applied; only when one realizes there is no yang can yang be gathered. Like the clear emptiness of the heavens—utterly devoid—yet through it, the seasons turn and beings arise, enduring for ages without cease.\n\nYou worry that your scholarly pursuits sustain you but prevent stillness. Yet awakening the mind and seeing one’s nature can be done in the present. I originally taught you to begin here. Refining the mind is half the work of becoming an immortal. Why not complete this half first, leaving the other half for the right moment? Why abandon the present for futile worries?\n\nSince you have already reduced desires, the great foundation is secured. From here, stabilize your spirit, quiet your thoughts, and in stillness, investigate and awaken. The mysterious gate stirs, ready to open.\n\nThe womb is formed through non-doing. Non-doing is the origin of the womb. Why? The Supreme Ultimate gives birth to heaven and earth naturally, unconsciously—what is clear ascends to become heaven, what is turbid descends to become earth. All unfolds freely, at ease, and thus heaven and earth are born. If the Supreme Ultimate were to overturn and invert at the moment of creation, yin and yang would reverse, the Five Phases would scatter, and before the world could form, the natural order would collapse—this would not be the body of the Dao.\n\nIf one understands how the Supreme Ultimate gives birth to heaven and earth, then when forming the elixir, one can make non-doing the very act. Yang should ascend, yin should descend—just as when the Supreme Ultimate gives birth to heaven, the clear rises, and when it gives birth to earth, the turbid sinks. Though heaven and earth are divided, the Supreme Ultimate remains undivided. Thus, yin and yang merge, forming the precious pearl, a state of primordial chaos—yet it is still one Supreme Ultimate. This is why the elixir is the elixir, why the womb is the womb.\n\nWhen the fire-timing is complete, the yang spirit emerges. Know that this yang spirit is the uncarved block of chaos, not something formed by the four elements and five phases. If it were formed by them, it would be the human body. And if it were the human body, it would possess cunning and knowledge. With cunning and knowledge, it could not be non-doing, and would be far from the Dao.\n\nThus, this yang spirit is the Supreme Ultimate itself. But if it is the Supreme Ultimate, why does it have form? I explain: This yang spirit is the first person of the primordial era—when heaven opened at *zi*, earth split at *chou*, and humanity arose at *yin*. It comprehends all things, its Dao sustains the world. It is incapable yet omnipotent, ignorant yet omniscient. It is uncarved jade, unhewn simplicity. Though it has form, it is truly the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate is the ancestor of the Dao.\n\nDoes the elixir have an ancestor? Know that the elixir takes the Great Void as its ancestor. The Great Void gives birth to spirit, spirit gives birth to qi, qi gives birth to essence. Spirit, qi, and essence share the same ancestor—the Great Void. Should they not resemble their ancestor? Yet how is it that not one of them is void? They are wayward children, unworthy descendants. How unfortunate for the Great Void to have such offspring!\n\nCan one return to the void? Yes. What is the way to return to the void? To be without thought and without action is to return to the void. Yet the root of non-action lies in non-thought. Why? One may sit in stillness all day, cutting off worldly affairs, appearing carefree—others may see a carefree immortal, a perfected being, a true companion of the Dao. But within their mind, thoughts churn endlessly, hiding countless illusions. A single thought spins the wheel of rebirth, planting seeds of boundless life and death.\n\nThus, while many can practice non-action, only the perfected can be without thought. Examine your own mind—can you truly be without thought? Not only can you not be without thought, you cannot even go a single moment without it. Since you cannot be without thought, when events arise, you are startled; when things stir, you are moved. Though you may wish to be without thought, it is impossible.\n\nYou are entangled in worldly ties, sustaining yourself through scholarship—how could you be without thought? Yet thoughts differ. There are proper thoughts and improper thoughts. The improper—whether for fame, wealth, sensual pleasures, or even the desire to become an immortal or a buddha—are not within one’s station. These are hopes, gambles, all of which must be utterly abandoned.",

      "translated_text": "Keep your focus unbroken and meticulous, engaging only in work that truly benefits yourself—learning that seeks nothing from others. How then could you fail to awaken to truth? How could you fail to enter sagehood? Never allowing a moment to pass in idleness, your mind will naturally find ease day by day, your will and qi like spirits. Cast aside the very terms \"immortal\" and \"buddha,\" for in truth, this is the very lineage of immortality and the root-source of buddhahood. The true immortal, the true buddha—these emerge from this path.\n\nMencius said: *\"Shun dwelled deep in the mountains, living among trees and rocks, roaming with deer and swine—yet how little he differed from the wild men of the mountains!\"* See how radiant his heart was! *\"When he heard a single good word or saw a single good deed, it was like the bursting of the Yangtze, irresistible and boundless.\"* See how swift his spiritual responsiveness was! This is what it truly means to refine oneself.\n\nIf one is willing to live as a wild man of the mountains without shame—unmoved by blows, unshaken by insults, appearing foolish and dull, like a simple child—then one is not far from the Dao! Yet is such a person truly foolish and dull? They possess great resolve and true learning; their capacity is like the rivers, which cannot be stirred to mud nor settled to clarity. Their conduct is like the pine and cypress, which neither flourish in spring nor wither in winter. Such a one is nearly a perfected person!\n\nAlas, where might I find such a person to discourse upon the Dao?\n\nYou dwell in desolate circumstances, with children before you—how bitter! You are constrained by your conditions. Yet if you forge a heart that advances without retreat, enduring trials of every kind, then you may shatter iron walls and pass through flames. Only then can the foundation for becoming an immortal or a buddha be firmly established, standing unshakable and at peace. Otherwise, what are immortality and buddhahood? Can they be trifled with by just anyone?\n\nGrit your teeth and steadfastly hold fast. This body may live or die, endure cold or hunger, yet your heart’s resolve toward the Dao must remain untouched by life and death, unmoved by cold and hunger. If your will is as unyielding as steel tempered a hundred times, can the countless lofty immortals in heaven truly be deaf and blind, failing to take notice? Such a thing is impossible.\n\nThus, your concern should be the firmness of your resolve, not the harshness of your circumstances. With true resolve, what situation cannot be endured? Even amidst blades and swords, iron beds and fiery pits, one may instantly become an immortal or a buddha—how much more so with plain fare and simple porridge, the common lot of the poor scholar?\n\nThe elixir is that primordial spark of true origin, present since the Great Beginning, only now perceived, grasped, and clearly recognized—hence it is called the elixir. It is like taking earth to form a pill: all sand and grit must be sifted away before it can be kneaded into a perfect sphere. The cultivator of the elixir must likewise sift away the seven emotions and six desires, leaving no dregs, so that the true origin shines like the autumn moon. Then, through the work of ascent and descent, the method of harmonization, a single grain of golden elixir—round and complete—takes form within the Central Yellow Palace of the Great One. There it is seen clearly, recognized clearly, and never lost.\n\nThe three superior medicines are spirit, qi, and essence. Spirit is the mother of qi and the ancestor of essence. A child does not abandon its mother, nor a grandchild its ancestor. Thus, in refining the elixir, when one concentrates the spirit, qi and essence naturally follow.\n\nThough the great medicine has three names, in truth it is one. When gathering yang, it is intention. At the moment of union, it is intention. When sealing and securing it within the Yellow Court, it is intention. Even through the ten months of firing, with ceaseless inner observation and constant reflection—what is this if not spirit? Postnatal intention is called *intention*; prenatal intention is called *spirit*. Where spirit abides, qi follows. Qi arises and subsides in dependence upon spirit.\n\nThus, during the formation of the embryo, stillness gives rise to yang; stillness settles the spirit; when the spirit is at peace, primordial essence blossoms and qi is born—this is how qi arises in dependence upon spirit. Through the ten months of firing, inner observation is fixed here, reflection is fixed here, and one’s primordial spirit is wholly concentrated here. Thus the five phases gather here, fetal breathing circulates here—this is how qi subsides in dependence upon spirit. Since the entire process relies upon a single spirit, after the embryo emerges, it is called the yang spirit. Great indeed is the function of spirit!\n\nThe elixir takes qi as its mother, spirit as its father, and essence as its child. Why is qi the mother? The elixir is formed from a single qi. Gathering yang is qi; the firing process is qi—like a mother giving birth to a child, whose form and viscera are all made from the mother’s essence and blood.\n\nWhy is spirit the father? Qi is born of spirit. Spirit cannot act alone but relies on qi for its function. Though qi is insubstantial, it has form; spirit is insubstantial and formless. The cultivator of the elixir first concentrates the spirit within qi, then forms the spiritual embryo—just as a father cannot conceive a child alone but must transmit his essence into the mother’s womb, where yin and yang unite to give birth to an infant.\n\nWhy is essence the child? Essence is the nourishment of the elixir, like water to a dragon. Though a dragon may soar and transform, without water its spirit cannot command its form, and it becomes no different from a lizard. Though the spiritual embryo is formed, without true essence to nurture it, it withers and becomes useless. Taking the meaning of a child who nourishes the old, essence is thus called the child.\n\nTherefore, the true cultivator must first achieve the threefold completeness, and from this threefold completeness attain the threefold perfection, before being permitted to practice the Dao and aspire to immortality.",

      "translated_text": "The common worldly person often mistakes the essence of sexual union for yin essence, believing that the elixir’s formation requires none of this—even if wantonly expended, it does no harm. Yet they do not know that essence itself is neither yin nor yang; without desire, the essence within the body is all yang essence, while with desire, the essence within the body becomes all yin essence. Yang essence is formless; yin essence has substance—a single distinction between desire and its absence. The Classic states: *\"The three supreme medicines are spirit, qi, and essence.\"* Yet most people do not recognize the existence of essence, qi, and spirit; even if they do, they cannot employ them. Thus the sages instruct: These three—essence, qi, and spirit—are the supreme medicines for cultivating the elixir. They are not found outside but all reside within your own body.\n\nThose of superior root and capacity, once they know the Dao, diligently practice the secret seal. In utter chaos, in boundless obscurity—what is spirit, what is qi, what is essence? If you take it as spirit, qi and essence are present within it. If you take it as qi, spirit and essence are present within it. If you take it as essence, spirit and qi are present within it. Like sugar blended with honey, like flour kneaded into dough, before the five phases emerge, at the moment before Heaven and Earth divide, this is the ancestral elixir—Tai Ji.\n\nHere, with a spark of numinous awareness, one acts in stillness, coalescing it into a millet-grain pearl. Refined by the primordial qi of Tai Yi, after ten months, it emerges as the yang spirit. Yet the term *yang spirit* must not be narrowly confined to the human body. That which gives birth to Heaven is this yang spirit; that which gives birth to Earth is this yang spirit; that which gives birth to the sun, moon, and stars, to womb-born, egg-born, moisture-born, and transformation-born beings, to all that flies, swims, moves, or grows—all are this single yang spirit. How can the yang spirit generate so much? It is because Tai Ji *is* the yang spirit, and the yang spirit *is* Tai Ji. If you regard it as yang spirit, it cannot generate yang spirit; if you regard it as Tai Ji, there is nothing it does not generate. This is the supreme principle. Otherwise, how could the transformations of immortals be so unfathomable? Do they possess boundless skill? Know that it is not the immortals who act—it is Tai Ji that acts.\n\nThe elixir itself is formless yet never nonexistent; its divisions and unions are without origin, its transformations unfathomable. It may be dispersed to pervade the entire body or gathered to repose in a single aperture. With one transformation, it takes form; with another, it returns to emptiness. Neither ghosts nor spirits can fathom its mechanism; neither Heaven nor Earth can exhaust its wonders. *\"The spirit has no direction, and the Changes have no form\"*—does this not describe the divine elixir?\n\nThus there are the precelestial elixir and the postcelestial elixir. The precelestial elixir is none other than Tai Ji. Those born from it must be sages, for the qi of Tai Ji is pure, harmonious, and unadulterated. When the primordial chaos first stirs, numinous brilliance gathers there. Thus in the most ancient era, extraordinary sages abounded, establishing the patterns of things, creating rites and music—just as the elixir does. The postcelestial elixir, however, is turbid and floating. Once the primordial chaos scatters, numinous brilliance also declines. Thus people of the middle era are inferior to those of the most ancient, and those possessing the virtue of firmness, centrality, and uprightness are rare indeed.\n\nWhat, then, is the meaning of the precelestial elixir? It is the coalescence of the formless substance of the primordial beginning into an elixir, refined by the primordial qi of Tai Yi—this is what is called the precelestial elixir. There is no Dao greater than Tai Ji, and the elixir embodies it. Why? The elixir cannot be sought through names, objects, instruments, or numbers. Its nature is pure emptiness, profound mystery, and the primordial chaos as one qi—this is the essence of the Dao.\n\nShould one ask: *What is it about the elixir that embodies Tai Ji?* I would answer: The elixir’s embodiment of Tai Ji *is* Tai Ji. A single millet-grain pearl creates the world. From the most ancient times to the present, the yang spirit transforms daily, hourly, moment by moment. Yet those born within it grow accustomed and remain unaware. Alas, who is it that awakens and knows? Only those of profound wisdom, who exhaustively investigate its principles, come to understand what the elixir truly is. If you take it as nonaction, how then do Heaven and Earth divide? If you take it as action, how do Heaven and Earth return to primordial chaos? There must be something numinous within.\n\nThe human body, from the heart upward, is Qian; from the navel downward, is Kun. If Heaven’s qi does not descend and Earth’s qi does not ascend, the hexagram is *Pi* (*Stagnation*). The *Book of Changes* says: *\"Heaven and Earth do not unite, and the myriad things do not communicate. Male and female do not unite, and their aspirations differ.\"* Thus the person of the Dao uses the fire within Li to replenish the yin within Kan, and the water within Kan to nurture the yang within Li. The hexagram becomes *Tai* (*Peace*). The *Book of Changes* says: *\"Heaven and Earth unite, and the myriad things communicate. Male and female unite, and their aspirations harmonize.\"*\n\nYet where does this Dao reside? There is nothing better than calming the heart and practicing it. If the heart is calm, the spirit is at peace; if the spirit is at peace, essence and qi harmonize. When spirit is at peace and essence and qi harmonize, reaching a state where they cannot be divided, the foundation of the elixir is established. Yet though the foundation is laid, it remains an indeterminate body. Thus one employs the *having within nonbeing*, refining it into *nonbeing within having*. Within the state of seamless unity, one selects the most refined, blending them into nonbeing. The metal essence and wood liquid engage in battle, striking the nine-tiered chime and plucking the eight-wind zither. The sun and moon emerge from below the navel; wind and clouds arise from beneath the armpits. Round and luminous, red and radiant—it is still the same Tai Ji: pure emptiness, profound mystery, and the primordial chaos as one qi.\n\nWithin it are Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon; all that flies, swims, moves, or grows, all womb-born, egg-born, moisture-born, and transformation-born beings—nothing is lacking.",

Though the spiritual embryo is formed, without true essence to nurture it, it withers and becomes useless. Taking the meaning of a child who nourishes the old, essence is thus called the child.\n\nTherefore, the true cultivator must first achieve the threefold completeness, and from this threefold completeness attain the threefold perfection, before being permitted to practice the Dao and aspire to immortality.",

      "translated_text": "When the numinous mechanism arrives, the myriad pipes resound in unison—primal oneness manifests its images, beyond all words. Laozi said: *\"Profound and again profound, the gateway of all wonders.\"* The elixir, wrought through nonaction, becomes numinous; wrought through action, it may not. Why is this? The elixir is the Dao of Heaven and Earth in its natural state. In the Dao of Heaven and Earth, where there is yin there must be yang, where there is water there must be fire, where there is closing there must be opening, where there is ascent there must be descent. That which makes the Dao the Dao—within the body, there is yin and yang, water and fire, closing and opening, ascent and descent. This is not forced; it arises of itself, without contrivance. Things each follow their kind, each finding its proper place, and thus the myriad beings are born. This is the unchanging Dao of kalpas past—how could I alter it? Unable to change it, I can only follow it.\n\nThe common folk of the world regard elixir-refining as seizing the power of creation, leaking the secrets of Heaven and Earth, unaware of where my mind dwells in this! I merely follow the Dao. You fear the lack of basis for gathering yang—yet yang arises according to its signs; follow its signs, and that is all. You fear the fire-timing is imprecise—yet fire’s arising has its time, its ceasing has its time; follow its time, and that is all. You fear true mercury will not arise—yet the heart is the central qi of the five viscera. When the central qi ascends, the qi of all viscera ascends with it; when it descends, the qi of all viscera descends with it. Mencius said: *\"The will is the commander of qi; qi is that which fills the body.\"* You establish its commander and follow its mandate, and that is all.\n\nRefining essence to return to qi, refining qi to return to spirit, refining spirit to return to emptiness—every step moves against the current, yet in elixir practice, every thought must follow the flow, every moment must follow the flow. Refining in reversal yet completing in compliance—this is the supreme essential secret of elixir-refining.\n\nSince the birth of Heaven and Earth from the Great Ultimate, all things with form and image, substance and nature, have grown day by day, month by month. Heaven and Earth suffer from the ceaselessness of generation, yet cannot but generate. The myriad beings bear Heaven and Earth’s grace, bathe in their blessings, yet do not know of Heaven and Earth’s suffering in generation. The primordial transformation of Heaven and Earth leaks without cease, flows without return—Heaven and Earth are exhausted. To seek from these exhausted Heaven and Earth that their generated beings share the Dao’s inexhaustibility is like grasping a chick too weak to match its hatchling peers and hoping for its mastery of archery—can this be reasonable?\n\nThen what is to be done by those of resolve who single-mindedly strive to learn the Dao? It is this: return my yin and yang to the state of primordial chaos, and elixir-refining becomes possible. Begin with nonaction, end with thoughtlessness—then Heaven is clear and tranquil above, Earth rests securely below. Then yin and yang blend into a pearl, gathered within the profound and again profound aperture. Inverting and reverting, in a state of vagueness and obscurity, a single furnace of creation, ten thousand measures of divine radiance. At this time, Heaven and Earth are exhausted, yet I am not wearied; Heaven and Earth scatter, yet I do not disperse. Heaven and Earth suffer from the ceaselessness of generation, yet I rest in the abundance of each breath’s renewal. Heaven and Earth, through countless eons, return to chaos; I, however, open and close in due measure, expand and contract as appropriate, now generating, now ceasing, now myriad, now one. In the end, I merge with the Great Void—how could Heaven and Earth compare?\n\nWhat is the elixir’s fundamental basis? It takes having no basis as its basis. Why say this? The elixir is the root of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad beings. Why is it the root of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad beings? The elixir is the Dao; the Dao is the body of emptiness and nothingness. Emptiness and nothingness cannot be named, so the sages forcefully name it the Dao. The empty gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the myriad; the myriad returns to the One; the One returns to the empty. How can the empty give birth to the One? This is the mechanism of transformation, beyond all words. Yet roughly speaking, it may be described: the empty has no form, no image—how can it give birth to that which has form and image? In essence, the One born of the Great Void is originally without form or image. Without form or image, it is of the same body as the Great Void—why then name it the One? It is said: the empty *is* the One. The body of the Great Void is without interruption, without admixture, utterly pure and perfectly refined—thus it is called the Great Void giving birth to the One.\n\nWhat is the meaning of \"the One gives birth to the myriad\"? The myriad, too, is the empty. Know that the Great Void is not a rigid body—precisely because it is without interruption or admixture, it is called \"forged into a single piece.\" Yet within this Great Void, those that obtain its qi become form, those that obtain its principle become nature. They can separate or unite, expand or contract, be square or round, move or rest—thus it is also called \"the empty space pulverized.\" Yet the Great Void ultimately has no form or image—how then can it produce these beings with form and image? It is not the Great Void that does this, but that which acts within the Great Void. If the Great Void had the intention to generate the myriad beings, the Great Void would have its end. Therefore, the elixir-refiner’s single grain of millet-pearl shares the same body as the Great Void—then within it, transformations arise endlessly. The Great Void acts through nonaction, and the myriad beings naturally flourish; the Great Void is without mind, and the myriad beings naturally grow.\n\nAh! Perfect indeed—nothing can surpass it!",

I bestow upon it a single circle.\nYet a circle has boundaries, insufficient to liken the subtlety of this Dao—thus I still bestow upon it emptiness.\nYet emptiness suggests boundless dispersion, which may cause later elixir-refiners to doubt. Therefore, I have something to bestow: I bestow upon it a circle, and the circle in turn bestows upon it emptiness.\n\nIn elixir-refinement, nonbeing is the sovereign, being is the minister, water and fire are the assistants, and intention is the messenger.\nWhat is meant by \"nonbeing as sovereign\"? The three supreme medicines are each and all nonbeing. The seven-foot body becomes empty like a single crystal pearl, clinging to nothing. Only then do essence, qi, and spirit merge into one, vast and clear, undifferentiated and boundless—thus the foundation of the elixir is established.\nWhat is meant by \"being as minister\"? Within absolute nonbeing, the ten thousand beings are complete. To speak of \"no essence\" is yet to have essence; to speak of \"no qi\" is yet to have qi; to speak of \"no spirit\" is yet to have spirit. Like the age of primordial antiquity, when the people’s customs were harmonious, virtue and grace overflowed everywhere—one cannot grasp it by seeking a single name or form, yet rites, music, governance, and punishment are all brilliantly present.\nWhat is meant by \"water and fire as assistants\"? Water and fire are the medicinal substances. Water lies below and is raised upward; fire lies above and is drawn downward. This is like a ruler’s governance, balanced and even, without the ills of inner heaviness or outer lightness, or inner lightness or outer heaviness. The Jade Candle is harmonized, the Golden Bowl is full, the millet-grain pearl is complete, the ten thousand beings are perfected, the four seasons circulate, the eight winds are level, and the Three Powers are fully present. At this stage, the work is sixteen or seventeen parts complete.\nWhat is meant by \"intention as messenger\"? Who causes water to rise and fire to descend? Intention does. Before intention, there is no intention; after intention, there is no intention. Only the single, true intention remains in the center—through it, yang is gathered, the embryo is formed, the body is transcended, and the spirit emerges. Thus the method of elixir-refinement is exhausted.\nThe elixir is a thing of prior Heaven, not of posterior Heaven. If it were of posterior Heaven, it would be something fabricated by worldly eccentrics, a heterodox and external path.\nThe elixir is the Dao. The sages of antiquity, in their thousands of words, taught people only to devote themselves to the Dao. If one understands the natural Dao, one understands the natural elixir.\nWhen the Supreme Polarity generated Heaven and Earth, yang ascended to become Heaven, and yin descended to become Earth. Therefore, the elixir-refiner must know: before Heaven and Earth existed, what was the Supreme Polarity? The Supreme Polarity is the body of pure emptiness and nonaction. Before there were form, sound, qi, or number, there was that which was most numinous and supremely spiritual—the Supreme Polarity.\nWhy does the Supreme Polarity generate Heaven and Earth? It does not. Heaven and Earth receive its numinous qi: that which is vast and azure becomes Heaven, that which is solid and earthen becomes Earth. Yet the Supreme Polarity has never generated Heaven and Earth! If the Supreme Polarity were the cause of Heaven and Earth’s generation, then with Heaven and Earth’s birth, the Supreme Polarity would die.\nThe human heart is a single Supreme Polarity, the ancestor of the elixir. The cultivator of the mysterious, by condensing the heart’s single spark of numinous qi within the elixir chamber, allows spirit and qi to depend upon each other, gradually forming a shape.

      "translated_text": "Having formed a shape yet not being a thing—what then is this thing in truth? Above Heaven and below Earth, such a thing has never existed. Because it is not a thing, it may be called the Dao. Because it is not a thing yet ultimately possesses form, it may be called the elixir. Nevertheless, it must be called the Supreme Polarity. The Supreme Polarity is that from which the Dao emerges.\n\nWhen a person is born, the navel comes first. The umbilical cord connects to the root of the embryo, externally linking to the mother’s womb, where a single spark of true primordial qi contains the principle of life—this is the true, true seed. From the Mud Pill Palace to the Bubbling Spring, the navel lies at the center of the body. From the Swallowtail to the external kidneys, the navel again resides in the middle. It is like Heaven being Mount Song, Earth being the Central Plains—the constellations of all heavens encircle it, the winds of the five directions pay homage to it, it embodies the fullness of the Five Phases, and stands at the convergence of the hundred bones. To place the crucible here is to be neither biased nor partial, neither above nor below—what could be more perfect? Because it occupies the central position, it is called the Yellow Court. *Yellow* is the color of the center, and *court* signifies the image of emptiness with capacity.\n\nThis is what Master Ziyang referred to as \"within the formed,\" and what the *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* calls \"this aperture, no ordinary aperture.\" \"Opening the door is called *Qian*; closing the door is called *Kun*.\" *Opening* occurs after intercourse, when the elixir is sent into the Yellow Court. The elixir’s body is supremely robust, possessing the virtue of yang hardness; when the crucible opens and the elixir descends within, it is called *Qian*. *Closing* occurs when the elixir has returned to the crucible, and one seals it with intention, as if shutting a door. At this time, tranquility is paramount, like the body of *Kun*.\n\n**Question:** What are the five qi?\n**Master:** The five qi are the qi of the five viscera. The qi resides within the qi cavity and flows among the five viscera—within the lungs it becomes metal qi, within the heart it becomes fire qi, within the liver it becomes wood qi, within the spleen it becomes earth qi, and within the kidneys it becomes water qi. These are called the qi of the Five Phases. In daily life, the qi circulates through the five viscera, each with its own waxing and waning. Excessive decline leads to illness, excessive flourishing leads to illness, and if blocked entirely, paralysis, madness, abscesses, and swellings arise.\n\nWhen a person reaches the state of \"breath returning to the origin,\" the qi within the qi cavity surges vigorously, ascending from the Tailbone Gate to penetrate the Mud Pill Palace, where it mirrors the marrow in the brain like a silver lamp. Descending to the Double Towers, it suffuses all the viscera, like a misty moon illuminating the Xiao and Dongting lakes, coalescing into a single millet-like pearl. Sent into the golden crucible of the Yellow Court, the embryo receives the complete qi of the Five Phases, so that later the yang spirit remains identical to the human body. If any qi is deficient, the yang spirit will lack that aspect and fail to become fully human.\n\nHowever, one must still the mind further and further, deepen the mystery layer upon layer, so that these five qi become primordial qi. Only then will the yang spirit born from them be a being of utmost numinosity and sageliness. If one mingles it with postnatal qi, the embryo may not form, or if formed, it will lack numinosity. To seek its penetration of the mysterious and attainment of the wondrous will be impossible.\n\nThe essentials of elixir refinement are nothing more nor less than the two words: *concentrating the spirit*. Where does one concentrate the spirit? At the moment of receiving life at birth. When does one concentrate the spirit? At the time of true breath returning to the origin.\n\nThe qi within the human body completes twelve circuits in a day, like the Dipper’s handle pointing to the twelve celestial markers. As it ascends, the qi of the five viscera all ascend; as it descends, the qi of the five viscera all descend. After descending, the five qi merge into one—this is what the elixir classics mean by \"metal and wood unite, nature and emotions become one.\" This is the moment.\n\nAs for the rising of mercury, it occurs precisely when true breath returns to the origin. The mercury within *Li* ascends together with the qi of the five viscera. Moreover, when lead reaches the spirit chamber, metal can generate water, and lead-metal naturally produces wood-fluid. The Metal Duke seeks the female, the Wood Mother seeks the male—this is the inevitable principle. Why doubt it?\n\nThe true realm of stillness practice is better verified through personal experience than transmitted by brush. Chan Buddhists take enlightenment as seeing nature; Daoists take returning to the origin as obtaining life. Only by seeing nature can one know life, which is why the study of nature precedes it. Obtaining life also enables one to know nature, so that when the embryo breath returns to the root, it naturally fuses and harmonizes with that single spark of numinous light. Nature and life seem to have a sequence, yet in truth, they have none. Only the perceptive and insightful can understand this.\n\n**Question:** How can the yang spirit divide into hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands?\n**Master:** The yang spirit is a mass of true qi coalesced. Where true qi flows, it is like sparks flying from an explosion—each spark retains the nature of fire. The elixir is the Supreme Polarity. The Supreme Polarity generates Heaven and Earth, humans and things, giving rise to countless forms and images. A single grain of the golden elixir is entirely a Supreme Polarity, so it can naturally generate countless beings. A single emaciated immortal can fill the cosmos.\n\nHowever, Heaven, Earth, humans, and things, once possessing form, must eventually decay. The yang spirit born of the great elixir, though it has form, is in truth formless. Thus, when divided, it can become ten thousand; when reunited, it is one. Yet if the yang spirit is formless, how can it eat? It is a mass of pure yang qi, like the summer or autumn sun—what cannot it melt?\n\nThen, if the yang spirit divides into further yang spirits, are their spiritual penetrations identical? Things with form, when divided, may differ. Thus, even the wise often give birth to dull-witted sons.",
      "overlap_context": "h’s generation, then with Heaven and Earth’s birth, the Supreme Polarity would die.\nThe human heart is a single Supreme Polarity, the ancestor of the elixir. The cultivator of the mysterious, by condensing the heart’s single spark of numinous qi within the elixir chamber, allows spirit and qi to depend upon each other, gradually forming a shape. Over time, its transformations are limitless, and it may share the Supreme Polarity’s beginninglessness and endlessness.\nWhy? Because it is not a thing.",

      "translated_text": "The yang spirit is spirit, with no other admixtures—its spiritual penetrations are naturally identical and undivided. Yet if the yang spirit scatters in all directions, east, west, south, and north, what then? It is said: this supremely numinous thing pervades heaven above and earth below, penetrating even the most minute; when the copper mountain collapses, the bell tolls; when the sword transforms into a dragon, it reunites. Even insentient things resonate thus—how could scattering be its true nature?\n\nQuestion: Does the elixir have form?\nThe master said: After their union, the whole body fuses and harmonizes, like the warmth of spring or the moment of waking from deep sleep, when the mind’s landscape is utterly clear. What is this union? It is spirit, it is essence, it is qi—yet neither essence nor qi nor spirit. It is called the Dao, seen as the elixir, conceived as the Supreme Polarity. After ten months, it becomes the yang spirit.\n\nIn sum, every aspect of elixir refinement is empty; a single grain of millet-pearl embodies the vastness of the Great Void. Ponder this, and you will grasp more than half.\n\nYou must understand the single word *dan* (elixir). *Dan* is the body, resembling the human form. *One* is the navel, resembling the human navel. The navel is *dan*, resembling the elixir within the navel. The elixir resembles the body, the body resembles the elixir.\n\nWhy does a single stroke resemble the navel? Why not a circle instead of a stroke? What is the meaning here? This single stroke is the same as Fuxi’s primordial line. Before the Eight Trigrams existed, Fuxi first drew this one stroke—just as, in the mother’s womb, before the five senses and four limbs take shape, the navel-wheel forms first, connected by the umbilical cord to the mother’s belly. The single stroke in the character *dan* carries this meaning. Thus, the embryo is not formed elsewhere but in the navel, for the navel is the root of human life. Elixir refinement is the establishment of life—where else but at the root of life should the elixir be formed?\n\nThe elixir, as a thing, possesses a spirit dwelling in the palace of profound mystery. Attain this spirit, and the elixir may be completed; fail to attain it, and the elixir cannot be measured by years. What is this spirit? It is the ancestral spirit of the elixir.\n\nWhen you first vow to cultivate the Dao, this spirit descends with the true qi of the Dipper’s handle to reside in your heart-mansion, harmonizing the substances of your entire being. It clears the mind’s terrain and purifies the qi-nature—all through the agency of this spirit.\n\nThis spirit abhors movement and loves stillness; it abhors fullness and loves emptiness. When stillness and emptiness reach their utmost, the spirit becomes numinous of itself. Once numinous, it naturally manifests great function, governing the spirit-kings of the five viscera and six bowels, gathering the five phases, uniting the ten thousand images—like a helmsman in a boat, turning with the bends and shifting with the shores, never meeting obstruction or difficulty.\n\nFor every fraction of effort you complete, the spirit guides you to the next; when you finish two parts, it leads you to the third. It entices and supports you at every turn, opening paths in myriad ways, until at nine or ten parts, your effort is complete—all through the power of this spirit.\n\nNow, offer two words as sustenance for this spirit. What are these two offerings? Stillness and emptiness.\n\nScroll Four",

      "translated_text": "At the Southern Culmen’s Celestial Palace resides the Azure Radiance Supreme Emperor—through dust-ebbing kalpas, the compassionate father who shields all life; through ten thousand generations, the primal master of written teachings. With golden tones and jade resonance, he inaugurated true learning in the Eastern Continent; from lion throne and lotus dais, he expounded the Dharma and transmitted it in the Western Realm. The marvels of his divine transformations defy description; the workings of his transformations and movements show not the slightest trace. Seeming mad yet truly sagely, he dwells amid times of harmony and purity; though obscured, his glory is certain to manifest, beyond all considerations of advance or retreat, honor or disgrace. Vast in compassion, vast in vows, supremely sagely, supremely benevolent—through manifold expedient means, he liberates countless beings. The Most High Heavenly Worthy, the Supreme Dao Ancestor, the Immortal Master, bestows registers.\n\nSomeone asked: After attaining a body beyond the body, what further practice remains?\nThe Master replied: An excellent question. There are two paths in this Dao.\nFor those of the lower realm who cast off the body, the process is swift. For those of the upper realm who merge the entire being, the process is slow. Why is this so?\nOnce the yang spirit pierces the crown, it roams freely in the Great Void, carefree and joyous. In an instant, it soars ten thousand miles—upward, it can toy with the sun and moon, tread loftily upon clouds and mist; downward, it can wander among islands and isles, gazing upon scenic wonders. A thousand transformations, ten thousand changes—all follow the heart’s desire. Looking back at the illusory frame, it seems but a clod of dung, unworthy of retention. Thus, one sheds the bones in a desolate crag, abandons the form and flees afar—this is the way of those who cast off the body.\nBut if one of resolute aspiration seeks no quick results and willingly undertakes the slow, painstaking work, the yang spirit may emerge yet remains unemerged; the illusory frame may be discarded yet remains undiscarded. One single-mindedly preserves the primordial numen, subjecting it to a thousand fires and ten thousand refinements. The spirit is forgotten as the Great Void, yet refined with pure fire, transforming together with it—this is the way of those who merge the entire being.\nBoth paths are presented here; let each choose for themselves. Should those of aspiration not take the higher way as their model?\nThe questioner asked: Is this the same as or different from the practice of refining emptiness?\nThe Master replied: Refining emptiness is the work of supplementing what the heart’s cultivation has yet to attain. This practice is the work of supplementing what the qi’s refinement has yet to complete. If the heart’s refinement has already reached the point of utter nothingness, then after shedding the womb, one may proceed directly to this practice—how simple and direct! But those who prioritize life-cultivation over nature-cultivation may, when they reach the final stage, only be able to attend to nature and no longer to life. Those endowed with past-life wisdom merge the two as one—this too is wondrous.\nThe cultivator of truth embraces the Dao and abides in it, the spirit roaming in the Great Void. The Great Void has no so-called Dao; it is named as such because of people. People, too, have no so-called Dao. When the Dao is no longer the Dao, then there is a so-called Dao—but in reality, there is nothing there at all.\nAlas, whence comes the name of the Dao?\nWithin and beyond heaven and earth, all is the Great Void. With the existence of heaven and earth, the Dao’s flow through the Great Void becomes obstructed and congested. Thus, when heaven and earth perish, the Dao is complete.\nI and the Great Void are vast and uniformly empty. Yet because of form and appearance, we become separated from emptiness. Though the nine orifices allow flow and communication, my own Great Void is constricted and restless. Precisely because of this restlessness, it congeals into sentience and issues forth as desire, now joy and anger, now sorrow and delight—countless postures, endless artifices. With that single point of unimpeded numinous radiance, one sinks into flesh and blood, bound to suffer endless hardship and futility, reduced to mere tricks and contrivances.\nHaving sunk for so long, one gradually forgets the Void. Even after death, one remains deluded and unenlightened, falling into evil destinies, reborn again and again. To seek liberation—is this not difficult?\nYet if the body is such a hindrance, why do immortals strive for ascension in broad daylight?\nThe answer: This is a transformed body, not an ordinary one. The transformed body is no different from the Great Void. Refined by true fire, both form and substance are transformed. Thus, when it gathers, it becomes form; when it disperses, it becomes qi. In the interplay of gathering and dispersing, there is an inexplicable spontaneity.\nThe true cultivator, whether in sacred mountains and numinous grottoes or in bustling streets and narrow alleys, can refine the elixir. The body is hot as fire, the heart cold as ice, the qi flows like a spring, the spirit still as a mountain—this is what it means to attain the Dao and become an immortal. Such people I have long ceased to see.\nThe method of refining the form: empty the body and heart, relinquish all activity, and yield to the natural movement of the heavenly Dao. Over time, one transforms until no substance remains to be found.\nIgnorant monastic followers often mock our Daoist tradition as \"dragging corpses and carrying bones,\" peering at the sky through a tube—how could they be worthy of discussing the vastness of the celestial body? Little do they know that when our Daoist adepts refine and cultivate to the point of complete transformation of form and spirit, the vast Great Void is filled with purple light and mysterious qi, pervading the heights of heaven and the depths of earth. When luminous, it becomes the sun and moon; when sharp, it becomes thunder and lightning; when surging, it becomes wind; when moistening, it becomes rain. It responds to cries for help without fail, universally attuned. It grasps the pivot of great creation, serving as the parent of all beings. Is its achievement not radiant and magnificent? This is indeed the proper duty of the noble person.\nThe Great Luo Heaven is no place for mortal footsteps—it depends entirely on how one conceives of oneself.\nThe Most High liberates beings through the Dao, not through elixirs. Immortals liberate beings through elixirs, yet never apart from the Dao. Other minor practitioners boast of secret transmissions. Since ancient times, there has never been one who, by means of arts, could attain eternal life and liberation from all destinies. Prolonging life and averting illness—this may be possible in principle.\nAmong the ancient elixir classics, only the *Triple Concordance* is reliable; the rest are a mix of truth and falsehood. Yet even in the true, falsehood intrudes, and the true is no longer true.",

      "translated_text": "Why then do those who cultivate the mysteries cling only to stale words on paper, seeking to wrest creation from the heavens? Blind throngs bustle about—seeing the Great Dao, they know it not; deceived by fraudulent elixir texts, they believe them instead. They cast aside luminous jade to treasure what is not treasure. This is why Master Yang lamented the sorrow of divergent paths!\n\nAlas! Across the vast expanse of past and present, countless heterodox schools of the mysteries are but empty fabrications, like drawing cakes to allay hunger. Those of true aspiration should cultivate the supreme Dao, taking the great worthies and sages as their teachers, and making the illumination of the mind and perception of inherent nature their aim. Affliction and enlightenment are not two realms; celestial palaces and earthly caves all reside within a single mind. By applying unbroken, ceaseless effort and treading the solid ground of self-cultivation, one may become an earth-traversing immortal in this world and ascend as an immortal official in the Jade Palace, with descendants dwelling forever in blessed lands. Is this not the grand completion, the great repose?\n\nAs for the method of refining the elixir: in stillness, there is no elixir yet the elixir exists; in movement, there is an elixir yet the elixir vanishes. Try stilling yourself for a moment—your spirit becomes serene, your qi profound. From this interdependence of spirit and qi, employ your true heart to issue true intention, and pound the wondrous essence into a supreme treasure, storing it in the cinnabar field. Thereafter, inwardly observe at all times, ceaselessly turn your gaze within. The celestial furnace blazes, the earth is gilded with gold; the Dipper pivots in its revolution, yin and yang invert. When merit is complete and the Dao perfected, the pure yang qi of utmost hardness steams the flesh and refines the bones, the dharma-body becomes gentle and warm, all seasons like spring. The sun crowns the head, day without night; creation dwells within the body, life without death. Dividing one into ten thousand, uniting ten thousand into one—this is called the perfected person, whose spirit and form are both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth.\n\nThe workings of immortals are not extraordinary. They practice the ordinary Dao, perform ordinary deeds, and are ordinary people. Confucius said: *\"The practice of common virtue, the caution of common words.\"* The immortals of heaven are but ordinary people of the world. My teaching to you has always been plain speech, nothing to astonish the world or shock the vulgar. Follow this path, and why fear the difficulty of ascending the immortal’s road, climbing the immortal’s ranks, holding immortal office, or receiving immortal emolument? Riding clouds and mounting cranes, emerging from being and entering non-being—this is the necessary path for the noble person. The family tradition of the Confucian—what is there to marvel at? Why do you doubt?",

Since ancient times, there has never been one who, by means of arts, could attain eternal life and liberation from all destinies.

Yet even in the true, falsehood intrudes, and the true is no longer true.",

      "translated_text": "The discourse on elixir refinement, in the original teaching of the Most High, regards the cultivation of nature as paramount, with the restoration of life as secondary. The body of true constancy, perfect across kalpas without end, leaves even King Yama no foothold to act. Though he may give life or take it, he cannot grasp the boundless, fathomless Dao to give or take. As for the study of refining life, when the firing times are fulfilled, the entire body ascends in flight, soaring through the Great Clarity. Yet I ask you: what truly is the substance within your body? First, you must scour this substance clean, transcending birth and death, and only then may the very body itself transcend them. If the substance within remains unclean, the root of life and death remains firmly bound—like a fine house whose master refuses to sit in stillness, ever chasing outward, wandering through flowery lanes and willow-lined alleys, eyes roving and heart stirred. Should he depart even briefly, he may forget to return; the house, left unoccupied, must fall to ruin.\n\nThus, the study of refining nature begins with keeping the master within, turning the heart away from externals. The study of refining form is the master repairing the house. Ponder this carefully: which is light, which is heavy? Which comes first, which follows? The answer is self-evident without need of the wise.\n\nIn seated meditation, suspend this heart in the vast emptiness. Wait until the breath is harmonized and body and mind are settled, then gently gather it inward to illumine the original substance. If it is truly empty, utterly devoid of all, then at that moment you will spontaneously realize wondrous awakening. The ten directions of the world all enter into awakening, yet in truth there is nothing to awaken to. Awakening-nature neither arises nor ceases—this is true awakening. The original, single point of empty numinosity is perfectly round, perfectly wondrous: small as a hair’s tip, vast as Mount Sumeru. All things with form derive their form from it; all without form derive their formlessness from it. Heaven and earth, sun and moon, womb-born, egg-born, moisture-born, transformation-born—when there is being, they divide into the ten thousand; when there is non-being, they merge into one. What is there that cannot be accomplished?\n\nAll that is substantial must decay; only the insubstantial does not decay. The human body arises from the four great elements; at death, it returns to them. Only this empty yet numinous essence finds no place to return. If one speaks of returning to emptiness, emptiness is its original state. To take this emptiness and return it to that emptiness—when emptiness has no this or that, where is there to return? Precisely because emptiness has no return, it does not die. Emptiness is what does not die. Even the refinement of the elixir is emptiness. The so-called yang spirit is not the body composed of the four great elements—how could it be called non-empty? The yang spirit is precisely that which is empty yet numinous, a thing beyond depiction or molding. No hand that carves wind or engraves moonbeams can apply even a needle’s tip to it. Only the yang spirit distinctly casts a shadow of these three words: empty yet numinous.\n\nThus, Chan and the mysterious are separated by but a single gap—they cannot be called different, nor can they be called the same. Between sameness and difference, only the supremely wise can reach the ultimate. Those who study the Dao take forbearance as their foundation. Joy, anger, sorrow, and fear are not native to this heart; sweep them all away—what boundless joy! Yet the word \"forbearance\" is easily spoken but hard to practice. Who but the greatly courageous can achieve it? Who but one whose vast qi fills the space between heaven and earth can achieve it?\n\nSince you have resolved to enter this mysterious gate, you must hold yourself to great courage, bear the vast qi as your own, make ginger and cinnamon your heart, ice and iron your bones. Like true gold in fire, the more it is tested, the brighter it shines. As for the completion of Chan, the verification of the mind-ground—after awakening, you must await it with the power of stillness. The layperson differs from the renunciate. Why? The renunciate’s vision is of immortal scriptures, their dwelling a mountain chamber; even if they move daily, it is still daily stillness. The layperson, whether toiling to sustain life or rushing to attend to affairs, even if they rest daily, it is still daily movement. Without stealing moments of leisure amid busyness or seeking emptiness amid clamor, nature will not return to life, life will not unite with nature. Though one may speak of effortless soaring, to seek the return of true breath to the origin, the revelation of the original spirit, the earth covered in yellow sprouts, the sky filled with white snow—this will be difficult indeed.\n\nSince you have already vowed to enter my mysterious gate, you must undertake true and solid work, examining from your own fundamental source: have the roots and dust been completely purified? Is the mind’s substance perfectly luminous and round? Within the square inch of your heart and the seven-foot frame of your body, can you achieve utter emptiness—like a crystal pagoda or a beryl vase? If so, then seek stillness within stillness, redouble your resolve, steel your sinews, brace your belly, lie on a rope bed, sit on a rush mat. See as if not seeing, hear as if not hearing. Go and grope for the mysterious pass and wondrous aperture within, position the golden tripod and jade furnace, gather the original yang and true qi. Neither assist nor forget, growing day by day, month by month. Like a pearl in water’s depths or uncut jade in stone, the essence will naturally coalesce, radiance will naturally burst forth. Within a year and ten months, the infant will emerge from the numinous womb, and by this original yang qi, the crown of the head will be struck open.\n\nThis is the work of the heroic and great! I ask: in the methods of gathering, replenishing, withdrawing, and adding—must one follow the sequence strictly?",

      "translated_text": "The Master said: This is the compassionate resolve of the sages and worthies to save the world, and so they had no choice but to establish many names and forms. If there be a person of superior wisdom who suddenly awakens to the Great Vehicle, able in the four postures of walking, standing, sitting, and lying to empty all things, constantly turning the light inward—then in half a year or ten months, when the fire-timing is ripe, the moon of inherent nature will naturally hang in the sky, and the original spirit will appear. Thus the sages and worthies further teach people to proceed directly to the upper pass, refining the spirit and returning to emptiness—this is the most wondrous of wondrous teachings.\n\nYet when one has long practiced stillness, the qi throughout the body cannot but circulate and ascend and descend, corresponding above to the degrees of the celestial revolution. Like the surging tide on the fifteenth night, it courses through the sinews and washes the marrow, shattering the bones to powder. The sages, fearing that learners might reach this state and become alarmed or maddened, thus ruining their work, out of great compassion established the various methods of gathering, replenishing, withdrawing, and adding, so that learners might first witness these processes and thus remain composed when the moment arrives, undisturbed by the circumstances. Though the winds and waves may churn the river, my boat turns with the rudder.\n\nI tell you in all truth: the essentials of elixir-refining do not lie here. Do you understand? Everyone speaks of refining the elixir and refining lead, yet who knows that the true elixir is not made of lead? Only when you find this elixir-seed within yourself will you realize that the elixir classics are all mistaken, a thousand times mistaken. Ah! Even what I have said is also within those thousandfold errors—you must glean from the wordless place.\n\nYour heart is full of fear, only because your quest for the Dao is not earnest, your seeing of inherent nature not true, and your faith in me not steadfast. If you vow to seek the Dao, you will truly undertake the work of seeing inherent nature. Believe every word your teacher transmits, believe half a word if only half is given. Since you have met a true teacher and received true instructions, what aversion or hesitation prevents you from acting?\n\nYour heart trembles, ever fearing that seeking the Dao may bring harm rather than benefit. When you think of stillness practice, doubt and dread arise together. With such timidity, you cannot be a loyal minister, nor a filial son, much less an immortal. Know this: inherent nature is your own nature, life is your own life—both are bestowed by Heaven. Does Heaven bestow them only for demons to seize them? Is there such a principle?\n\nMoreover, those who study the Dao relinquish both being and non-being, seeing this body as mere illusion. Though blades, saws, cauldrons, and caldrons may harm the body, they cannot destroy this luminous and empty essence. So long as this essence remains unbroken, even if in this life you are slain by demons, this luminous and empty thing—hard as gold, fierce as fire—will take on another human form and naturally fulfill your vow to attain the Dao and become an immortal.\n\nFurthermore, with a mind undisturbed, no demons will come; a single mind can withstand ten thousand demons, one truth can dissolve ten thousand illusions. What have I to fear? The sages and worthies of the upper realms cherish their disciples who inherit the Dharma and the Dao as if they were pearls and jade. Pearls and jade have their price, but a good disciple is priceless. From the very beginning, when you first set your mind to this, your name and native place were recorded in the celestial registers, and daily the sages and worthies descend to observe your merit and transgressions. If your resolve is true and your thought steadfast, the sages will rejoice beyond measure, protecting you from the void as a loving mother guards her infant—how could they abandon you to the ravages of fierce demons and evil ghosts, to their mockery and slaughter? There is no such principle.\n\nIf you have already set your heart on becoming a disciple of my Daoist gate, you must rouse great courage and make a great vow: to be a man who stands between heaven and earth, a hero who turns the cosmos—greatly reviving the mystic wind and broadly opening the Dharma precincts. Even if your body were trapped in a demon’s lair or your life hung in a demon’s den, you could still rely on your own numinous nature, radiating great light to illuminate the hidden depths, causing the demon horde to flee and the ghostly throng to vanish. How much more in times of peace, when high immortals are your companions—would a hero and great man ever harbor such timid and slack thoughts?\n\nThe student of the Dao closes the mouth to still the breath, opens the mouth to laugh—so great is their harmony and joy that their movements are one with Heaven. Day by day they dwell in the spring wind, hour by hour beneath the bright moon, and thus may ascend to join the lofty immortals and consort with the transcendent. But this is not something you can achieve.\n\nA man takes heaven and earth as his hut, lakes and seas as his robe—his cloud-like traces drift boundlessly, where does he not go? Why must he confine himself to one place? You are only encumbered because you have too many children, yet Pang the Layman’s entire household cultivated the Dao, and Zhang Zhihe floated his home upon the waters. When I think of the ancients, I truly find my heart in accord with theirs—their lofty winds are not far, their fragrant footsteps may yet be followed.\n\nFor those who attain the Dao, every place is a broad thoroughfare, every mountain a dwelling. Laozi rode his blue ox westward, Bodhidharma left India to come east. Step out the door, and the great road lies before you—what burden are wife and children? The skills you carry with you are your traveling provisions—what cause for concern?\n\nI have seen those who cultivated the Dao in ancient times: refining the heart’s numinosity, all wondrous principles arose from their own awakening, and their practice was intimate and full of savor, free from demonic obstructions. Later generations forgot this essential point, seeking every key from the teacher’s mouth. Then there are those blind teachers who put on airs, swearing oaths to Heaven and accepting others’ worship—yet what they transmit are but petty techniques. As for the Great Dao, they have not even glimpsed it. Error is passed on as error, delusion pursued as delusion; the blind lead the blind, the deaf gather to converse. How difficult for them to ascend to truth and enter sagehood! How lamentable!",

In stillness, they sought it within the One Heart, where nothing is lacking.\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao’s Nine-Cauldrons Divine Elixir was originally transmitted heart-to-heart, mind merging with mind, never spoken aloud or written in texts. If the Great Dao were to be passed down through words or writing, even if transmitted, it would lack intimacy, and practice would never proceed as desired.\n\nThus, the heart is the root of the myriad things, the convergence of the One Origin. To abandon the heart and seek elsewhere is like forsaking the root to chase the leaves.\n\nI have seen those in the world who cultivate the mysteries: once they learn a thing or two, they immediately assume the airs of a master, demanding others’ worship and accepting offerings. When I see this, I cannot help but cry, “What a sin!”\n\nThe great masters of antiquity, who have guided countless souls, merely taught people to clarify the heart and perceive their nature, to polish the mysterious pearl until its numinous light shines forth. From this, they naturally generate wondrous awakening, silently aligning with the true mechanism, their hearts resonating brightly with mine. Having awakened from within the heart, they grasp it intimately and practice it with ease. When they attain success, the myriad methods all return to emptiness, the One True embraces the ten thousand methods, and the wonder of forgetting words at the point of realization—how could this be pointed out by others, comprehended by others? Yet they clamor noisily, seeking it amid language and texts—is this not absurd?\n\nAlas! The world has long been without true masters! Yet those who discourse on the mysteries number nine in ten households, each claiming to have obtained the priceless pearl, full of self-importance, striking poses—is this not shameful? When I see them, I cannot help but cry, “What a sin!”\n\nAmong scholars of the Dao, there are those who achieve without knowing how they did so.",

      "translated_text": "How can this be explained? When the numinous impulse arrives, one does not first conceive of it—suddenly, in an instant, one awakens into the subtle and wondrous gateway. Why is this so? Because one is endowed from past lives with a numinous constitution and a refined *qi*, thus enabling such attainment. My friend, you truly possess the innate quality of an immortal, yet your habitual tendencies run deep, greatly burdening your pursuit of the Dao. You must sweep them away at every moment. The ancient sages’ four words—\"curb anger, restrain desire\"—are indispensable. Harmonize with others in company, be magnanimous in fellowship, speak sparingly to cultivate virtue, and maintain constancy to settle the mind. When all evil habits are thoroughly cleansed, you become an immortal dwelling in the world.\n\nThe celestial immortals delight most in befriending kindred spirits, traveling and lodging together, exchanging verses and toasts, singing in call and response—no different from ordinary people. Yet because the world lacks those who share their aspirations and walk the same path, they remain secluded in the heavens or hidden in mountain forests, unwilling to emerge. If you can truly empty your heart and fill your belly, aligning your will with theirs, your hearts resonating as one, your words always in accord, they will surely hasten to your home, becoming your most intimate friend. Not only will you not part from them, but they will not part from you, ensuring your elixir is perfected and your conduct fulfilled, hand in hand ascending together—what joy could surpass this!\n\nThus, the search for immortality need not be sought externally; it lies entirely in examining one’s own heart. The Dao cannot be attained through words, nor grasped through knowledge. One must verify it through every affair, test it in every circumstance, accumulating merit and conduct. Then the celestial spirits will follow you, and not only will the elixir be perfected, but your methods will also become efficacious.\n\nTherefore, the superior practitioner embodies the Dao in their person. The middling practitioner seeks it in words. The inferior practitioner pursues it in techniques. Many study, but few succeed—truly, because the Dao is near yet sought afar.\n\nYou have renounced glory and wealth, willingly enduring poverty and hunger, seeking only this Way—this shows your resolve. Yet you have not engaged in steadfast practice. What is steadfast practice? As Confucius said: *\"Attack your own faults, not the faults of others\"*—this is steadfast practice. Evils manifest in deeds are easily seen, but those hidden in the heart are difficult to refine. Thus, the earnest student must, at every moment, examine their own heart. What does it mean to examine? It is to scrutinize whether the subtle recesses of one’s mind align with the Dao.\n\nWith every arising thought, whether deviant or upright, you will know it yourself. If it is a deviant thought, extinguish it immediately, like one who weeds a field, uprooting it entirely so it cannot sprout again. If it is an upright thought, expand and nurture it, growing it day by day. Mencius said: *\"All people have things they cannot bear; extend this to what they can bear, and it is benevolence. All people have things they will not do; extend this to what they will do, and it is righteousness.\"* From this, benevolence becomes inexhaustible, and righteousness knows no bounds. When benevolence and righteousness fill the heart and flow through the limbs, manifesting in deeds, influencing the present age, and enduring for posterity—what manner of person is this? Can they not be called an immortal, not be hailed as a bodhisattva? This is a true immortal, a living great bodhisattva.\n\nSince I became your teacher, we have spoken of the elixir and the Dao, expounding deeply and clearly. Yet I perceive that your heart has not yet fully arrived at this. The Great Dao is ordinary, fundamentally no different from what others possess. If one can practice it, reaching the summit, heaven and humanity respond—truly, this occurs in the space between breaths. Golden tablets and jade scrolls descend from the imperial court. Golden youths and jade maidens attend constantly, ready to be claimed. Why then do you abandon steadfast practice to yearn for distant and elusive realms? This is straying onto the wrong path. Though you seek the Dao, you grow more distant from it; though you seek immortality, you become further removed from it. Does this align with my original intent in coming to guide you?\n\nThe cultivator of truth, when encountering difficult circumstances, must ever subdue the heart and restrain the *qi*, accepting all with equanimity. In the mountain’s embrace, by the water’s edge, a thatched hut just large enough to kneel in, with nothing more than a gourd and a bamboo hat—this is all. Amidst the sighing wind and rain, no smoke rises from the hearth. The pines roar in ten thousand valleys, snow piles at the cave’s entrance. The Daoist’s tattered robe is threadbare, the meditation cushion soiled. Seated in lotus, serene in emptiness, they keep company with frostbitten cranes and cold monkeys—what a realm this is! The vulgar and common deem it unbearably austere, but to me, it is the Land of Ultimate Bliss, the Ocean of Tranquility.\n\nYou have coarse food to fill your stomach, rough cloth to cover your body. At night, a rattan bed and a quilted blanket allow you to lie down until dawn, free from worldly cares and mundane distractions—this is the modest fortune of a minor earthly immortal. Do you still find it insufficient?\n\nAs for the refinement of life, though the oral instructions have been transmitted, it still awaits the karmic conditions of immortality, and someone will come to guide you. Heaven hears the humble—it will not leave you to complete only half the journey.\n\nMy words end here. You should inscribe them in your spirit.\n\n[Disciple asks:] *\"May I inquire about the distinction between the yang spirit and the yin spirit?\"*\n\nThe master replied: *\"Yin and yang are originally without division. If one exits the spirit before yin is fully transformed, it is called a yin spirit. When it departs, if one sees a river of white light in the eyes, the spirit exits through the eyes. If one hears the sounds of bells, chimes, or reed pipes, the spirit exits through the ears. Because the yang *qi* is not yet robust, it cannot break through the Heavenly Pass and instead takes an alternate route, following its inclination.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Though you dwell among venomous snakes and fierce beasts, treat them as kin, as brothers—how much more so with fellow humans? If you seek a place apart, it is only because your learning is shallow, your resolve weak, your tolerance narrow, your cultivation meager. At the sight of common folk, at the sound of vulgar words, your qi surges and your heart stirs, and you long for a secluded retreat, far from the crowd, to satisfy your wish. With such a disposition, where can you go that will suffice? You are mistaken, my disciple. A person of magnanimity, a person of true learning, would never behave thus. When others meet you with hostility, receive it with equanimity; when they come with anger, meet it with joy. The orchid grows amid the mugwort and reeds, yet does not separate itself from them—its fragrance unfolds of its own accord, and passersby turn to admire it. The crane stands among chickens and ducks, yet does not flaunt its grace—its bearing is effortlessly refined, and its aspirations soar beyond the clouds. The Dao-attainers of old often entered demonic realms, becoming kin to demons; yet through the influence of their virtue, even the demon kings bowed in reverence, and love and respect flowed toward them. If even fierce demons can be transformed and enlightened, what cause is there to fear mere humans?\n\nYou aspire to cultivate the Dao and embody the Perfected, to arouse the supreme bodhi vow—yet you squabble with women and girls over trivial matters, is this not the height of shame? As for whether to establish an altar or not, this is but a minor concern, not worth clinging to. Within the square inch of your own heart, there already exists a sacred altar. If you can sweep away the dust of old habits and kindle a censer of incense with the fire of primordial qi, I will descend into this very space, secretly imprint my transmission upon you, and bestow the esoteric teachings. What more could I ask of you?\n\n[Disciple asks:] *\"In stillness, why do so many visions appear?\"*\n\nThe master replied: *\"All things arise because we possess a body, and because we possess a mind. Thus, what arises from movement is called a *scene*, and what arises from stillness is called an *image*. What is a *scene*? It generally arises from the mind’s endless clinging and delusion, conjuring mirages like castles in the air—yet with a single moment of awakened awareness, it vanishes instantly. What is an *image*? Beginners, accustomed to the turmoil of daily life, sit upon their meditation cushions, and when the six senses grow quiet and the consciousness lies idle, their impatience with stillness gives rise to mischief: ghostly faces and monstrous forms appear before them. But if the heart remains unmoved, these too dissolve at once. This is the distinction between *scenes* and *images*.\n\nYet scenes are insubstantial and formless, while images are illusory yet take on substance. Why is this? Movement is yang, and yang is formless; stillness is yin, and yin takes form. Know this: the forms seen in stillness are but the shapes imagined in movement. Whether scenes or images, both are tricks of the consciousness. If cultivators of the Dao can, in the midst of daily activity, constantly raise the mirror of wisdom and keep the pearl of insight shining bright—awakening the moment a thought arises, extinguishing it the moment it is seen—then once extinguished, it will never arise again. When the consciousness is thus dissolved in movement, what phantom could appear before you in stillness, leaping about like a daytime ghost? When the true person manifests, the ten directions are forever free of demons—how could there be anything more joyous than this!\n\nYet people fear only the images in stillness, not realizing that the scenes in movement are far more terrifying! To be without self and without others, to embrace impartial vastness, to do unto others as you would not have done unto you—this is the Dao. The Most High forgets emotion, forgetting even the source of emotion. People, bound by the distinction between self and other, give rise to emotion; emotion gives rise to circumstances, circumstances to delusion, and delusion conjures countless castles in the air. In this, people are born, and in this, they die. The cause of birth and death lies in nothing else but this single thought of self and other. A spark of spirit lingers in the vast emptiness, watching the roots of human desire—love, pleasure, lust—and unknowingly stirred by them. Like a seed sprouting anew, the thought of birth and death arises. Once karmic conditions are bound, the fire of ignorance cannot be restrained; in an instant, one falls into the womb, ruled by yin and yang, the six senses activated, stumbling through life as if drunk, following the path without choice.\n\nThus, those who cultivate the truth must see through the illusions of the past, seek the real within the false, perceive the nature within emotion. Like one suddenly awakening from a deep dream, clarity shines forth. In that moment, karmic bonds are severed, and the path of birth and death is cut off. Yet this awakening is like turning over in the depths of the sea, rising through layer upon layer of waves to break the surface. With mind composed and thoughts settled, you look around— the other shore is not far, the realm of clarity and emptiness remains unchanged. Like a prodigal returning home, a traveler finding shelter, is this not bliss?\n\nI see the people of the world chasing illusions, lost in delusion—rarely does one, in the midst of a feverish dream, have a basin of cold water dashed upon their head, instantly dissolving the phantom bonds and illusory realms. Even when such moments occur, they often lack a true teacher, practicing blindly and fruitlessly, achieving nothing in the end. Birth and death ensnare people so—how can the heroic not take control, becoming a truly free person in this world?\n\nTo study the classics and expound the Dao, to discourse with a whisk in hand, to explore the profound and seek the hidden, to sit in meditation amid incense— to wander beyond the six directions to sacred mountains, to observe the winds of the eight corners unseen by others, to play the zither in jade forests and jeweled gardens, to cultivate herbs in palaces of immortality and fields of lingzhi. To ascend to the heavens, where the perfected assist the Celestial Emperor in the realm of true emptiness and wondrous existence, wielding the pivot of creation in the palace of the Supreme Non-Ultimate—engaging in affairs without toil, following the path without confusion. The vastness of heaven and earth lies at your fingertips, ever-present before you—what joy could surpass this?\"*",

      "translated_text": "Among those who cultivate the mysteries, there are thousands of schools—yet of ten who advance by technique, nine will fall away. Only one in ten remains, refining the Three Primes and Five Qi, achieving the Seven Cycles and Nine Returns—this may be called orthodox. Yet among ten thousand, scarcely one or two can be found who truly seek to illuminate the Dao and penetrate the profound.\n\nAlas! All are misled by the notion of \"longevity.\" These two characters, \"longevity,\" have never been understood since ancient times. Before grasping the essence of longevity, they first glimpse its function. Thus, theories of Kan and Li, water and fire, the gathering of lead and refining of mercury proliferate in the world. The ignorant multitude, driven by a single deluded and greedy thought, seek to attain accomplishment—yet most abandon the path halfway. Even those who succeed merely extend their lifespan by a few hundred or thousand years, all bound to an inevitable end. To then proudly claim kinship with the Great Dao—is this not the height of shame?\n\nTrue longevity lies in recognizing that the wondrous essence of one’s original body is eternal, while the Four Elements and Five Aggregates are all subject to birth and death. Only this original, wondrous essence is beyond birth and death. Whoever attains this possesses the supreme elixir. From here, cultivation proceeds with both root and branch, tempering the immortal embryo through five or ten years of firing, nurturing it into a being of utmost divinity and sageliness, dissolving the accumulated habits of past lives—this is called \"refining the elixir,\" but in truth, it is the cultivation of the mind. Such is the essential teaching of the Most High on elixir-refining, yet none have ever made it plain. I now reveal it outright, that those who study elixir-refining may awaken—is this not fitting?\n\nThe study of nature and destiny is one, not two. If one truly perceives the essence of nature, one immediately establishes the root of destiny. When the embryo is fully formed after ten months and the yang spirit emerges through the crown, though this is called the work of destiny, it is in truth the complete fulfillment of one’s inherent nature—how can nature and destiny ever be separate?\n\nThe crux of cultivation, as taught by all sages and perfected beings, is ultimate quiescence. Those who study the Dao yet do not attain quiescence cannot transcend the kalpas. Yet there is a distinction between immortals and buddhas, found in the difference between refining nature and refining qi.\n\nThe Buddhist path emphasizes refining nature, where the luminous spirit shines alone, utterly transcending the roots and dust—this is called \"nature’s longevity.\" The Daoist path emphasizes refining qi, forging a body of pure yang, where the golden light pervades the dharma-realm, self-originating—this is called \"qi’s longevity.\" Yet when one ultimately reaches the supreme source, even qi is nature, and longevity is quiescence. Why? If this qi were the qi of yin-yang and the Five Phases, a thing of form and substance, it would be born as such and die as such—by this, one becomes human, and by this, one becomes ghost.\n\nBut the qi refined by immortals transcends the Five Phases. In brief, it is the primordial, undifferentiated luminous essence pervading the Great Harmony, the most authentic of substances—yet in truth, it is no-thing. If it is no-thing, what kalpa remains to be transcended?\n\nYet those who study immortality vainly speculate, imagining immortals as beings who enjoy blessings and pleasures, a class of carefree individuals. But where there is fortune to enjoy, there is sin to suffer; where there is joy, there is sorrow. These are the complementary principles of increase and decrease, the mutuality of opposites. The world’s foolishness in holding such views is no different from the three deluded minds of greed, hatred, and ignorance. To study the Dao with such notions is to be far from the Dao indeed.",

In stillness, let go of all conditions, like the bright sun in the sky, unobscured by any hindrance. At this moment, no knowing arises, no awareness stirs—yet from this knowing, from this awareness, the true original essence of the heart-mind is revealed. If you take the absence of knowing and awareness as the heart-mind’s essence, you fall into dead emptiness. If you take the presence of knowing and awareness as the heart-mind’s essence, you cling to the illusions of past dust—both are mistaken. Seek the place of knowing and awareness within the state of no-knowing and no-awareness: this is what is meant by the Great Ultimate’s foundation.*\n\n*But when knowing and awareness have not yet arisen, where does this heart-mind abide?*\nMencius said: *\"In all discussions of human nature, it is the ‘old’ that matters. The ‘old’ takes advantage as its root.\"* When knowing and awareness have not yet arisen, you do not know where the heart-mind resides. Try sitting in stillness until you reach the state of suchness and immovability. If someone suddenly calls your name, you will instantly respond, *\"Here.\"* Who is it that responds? You will say: *\"The mouth responds.\"* But who is it that answers? This is the true original essence of your heart-mind. From this, we infer that when knowing and awareness do not arise, the heart-mind is surely present. Without deliberation, it responds at once to the call—this is what Mencius meant by the *\"old\"* and the *\"advantage.\"*\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: *\"Still and unmoving, yet when stimulated, it penetrates all causes under heaven.\"* This is the meaning.\n\nAwakening Inquiry asked: *When knowing and awareness arise in profusion, where does the true essence of the heart-mind reside?*\nThe Master replied: *Previously, you asked where the heart-mind abides when knowing and awareness do not arise. I instructed you to sit in stillness, utterly devoid of knowing and awareness. If someone suddenly calls your name, you will instantly respond, \"Here\"—this is the true original essence of the heart-mind. Now, I will use this same principle to point out the heart-mind’s essence when knowing and awareness arise in profusion. When you sit in stillness and the mind is disturbed by external objects, myriad defilements swirl chaotically in your breast—if someone suddenly calls your name, you will instantly respond, \"Here.\" At the moment of this response, all the previous defilements are cast aside. Endless entanglements, like vines and creeping grasses, severed by the sword of wisdom, illuminated by the light of knowing—suddenly, with a single call and a single response, emotions and perceptions are cut off, roots and attachments dissolve, and the originally luminous essence of your heart-mind is lifted forth from the void in that instant of response.*\n\n*From this, we observe: when knowing and awareness do not arise, all realms vanish—yet at the call, the response is immediate, the one true nature abides in itself. Only then do we know the heart-mind does not perish with the realms. When knowing and awareness arise in profusion, all realms manifest—yet at the call and response, the true original essence is revealed. Only then do we know this heart-mind does not arise with the realms. This is what is meant by neither arising nor ceasing. If you can suddenly awaken to this, you may resolve the matter of life and death. This is where you originally were before your parents were born. After your parents gave birth to you, you were originally present throughout the three thousand great thousand worlds.*\n\nBefore the words were finished, someone clapped and laughed, saying: *If you say you were originally here before your parents were born, try calling you before you were born—could you have responded?*\nThe Master replied: *Why would I not respond? Though I had no form, whom would you call? If you call emptiness, emptiness must answer. If emptiness does not answer, then the answer is not empty. Thus, the non-answer is called the empty answer—who says I do not respond?*\nThe laughter continued: *If you say that after being born you were originally present throughout the three thousand great thousand worlds, then when someone calls you, the three thousand great thousand worlds all respond together—why is it only you who answers?*\nThe Master replied: *Who says the three thousand great thousand worlds do not all respond together? If you insist that only I respond, then there is no sound beyond me. Know this: my single response is the simultaneous response of the three thousand great thousand worlds. Do not seek it through form—if you seek through form, you will be obstructed.*\n\n*It is like obtaining fire from wood. If you cling to the idea that this fire comes from this wood, then only this wood has fire, and all other wood has none. Even if there is fire, it must be a different fire for each piece of wood, not the fire of all wood. Each fire must have its own nature, not the nature of all fire. But know this: the fire of one piece of wood is the fire of all wood; the nature of one fire is the nature of all fire. Spanning heaven and earth, enduring through past and present—one fire, one nature. Thus, the Tathāgata, in the tip of a single hair, can fully contain the lands of the ten directions.*\n\n*How wondrous! How wondrous! Thus it is! Thus it is!*\n\nSomeone else asked: *If the essence of the heart-mind is fundamentally empty, not a single thing existing within it—then from where do joy, anger, sorrow, and delight arise?*",

      "translated_text": "If these emotions were fundamentally nonexistent, then upon encountering circumstances, they could not arise in response. Yet since they do arise in response, joy, anger, sorrow, and delight clearly do not come from without.\n\nI replied: Joy, anger, sorrow, and delight do not arise without encountering circumstances—thus we know they are the heart-mind stirred by encounter. If one claims the heart-mind inherently possesses joy, anger, sorrow, and delight, then one should feel joy without seeing what is joyful, anger without seeing what is angering, sorrow without seeing what is sorrowful, and delight without seeing what is delightful. Were someone to suddenly feel joy, anger, sorrow, or delight without cause, others would surely mock them as mad or possessed. Why? Because the human heart-mind inherently possesses no joy, anger, sorrow, or delight. From this we infer: one must see what is joyful before feeling joy, see what is angering before feeling anger, see what is sorrowful before feeling sorrow, and see what is delightful before feeling delight—only after perceiving something does the heart-mind respond. Is this not the heart-mind stirred by encounter?\n\nAnother asked: If the heart-mind’s essence inherently lacks joy, anger, sorrow, and delight, how then does the *Doctrine of the Mean* speak of “expression that always hits the mark as harmony”?\n\nI replied: The heart-mind is a numinous thing—when it encounters circumstances, it responds naturally and perfectly, without contrivance, hence called harmony. As the *Book of Changes* says: “Abiding in stillness, unmoving; when stimulated, it penetrates all things under heaven.” Abiding in stillness, unmoving—this is the unmanifest center. When stimulated, it penetrates—this is harmony that hits the mark. The sages who composed the *Changes* chose the word *stimulated* most wisely: only after stimulation does one know the heart-mind inherently possesses no joy, anger, sorrow, or delight.\n\nAnother said: Master, you claim joy, anger, sorrow, and delight arise upon encountering circumstances—does this not prove they are inherently present in the heart-mind?\n\nI replied: The heart-mind’s essence is fundamentally empty of things. If the heart-mind contained things, it would itself be a thing—how could one thing respond to ten thousand things? All joy, anger, sorrow, and delight arise when external circumstances stimulate the heart-mind. Only because the heart-mind is most numinous does it penetrate upon stimulation; after stimulation, it returns to emptiness. If one claims the heart-mind inherently contains the roots of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight, then at this very moment, examine your own heart-mind: where is joy? Where is anger? Where is sorrow? Where is delight? If these roots existed, then when joy, anger, sorrow, and delight are absent, one should still be able to find them. Yet at this moment, you cannot force yourself to feel joy, anger, sorrow, or delight—thus we know the heart-mind is pure emptiness, containing not a single thing. Precisely because it is empty, it is supremely numinous; when circumstances come to stimulate it, the heart-mind responds accordingly. Thus Mencius said: “When one suddenly sees a child about to fall into a well, one feels alarm and compassion.” At that moment of seeing, the heart of alarm and compassion arises simultaneously with the sight. Before seeing, this heart-mind is empty as space. After seeing, it vanishes again. Only at the moment of sudden seeing does this alarm and compassion arise—one knows not from where, like the bursting of a river, overwhelming and unstoppable. If this alarm and compassion were prearranged, then before seeing, why was the heart-mind empty as space? After seeing, why did it vanish? And when one sees again later, this alarm and compassion arises once more with the sight, then vanishes again—vanishing, then arising, arising, then vanishing. Does this heart-mind contain anything? No—it is emptiness at its extreme, numinosity at its peak. Only because it is empty and numinous can it respond to stimulation, then return to emptiness after responding. In our Daoist teaching, the “mysterious pass” is half-understood here.\n\nSomeone suddenly seeing a child fall into a well feels alarm and compassion—this arises with the sight. Likewise, seeing wealth may suddenly stir a thieving heart, seeing beauty may suddenly arouse lustful thoughts. These lustful and thieving impulses also arise with the circumstances—how then to distinguish them? Know this: when a thought arises in perfect fullness, it is the heart-mind’s true essence. The slightest deficiency makes it a deluded heart-mind. When one suddenly sees a child fall into a well, this alarm and compassion is utterly genuine, flowing freely and without restraint—fierce and blazing like the summer sun or autumn light, piercing and mournful like a sorrowful wind or bitter rain. It is no more or less than the great bodhisattva’s compassionate heart of saving suffering beings—is this not the heart-mind’s true essence? But when one sees wealth and stirs a thieving heart, or sees beauty and arouses lust, though these impulses may also arise with the circumstances, they are ultimately one’s own unwholesome thoughts—unfit to be known by Heaven, unfit to be spoken to others, longed for yet not dared to act upon, abandoned yet not immediately let go. Compared to that alarm and compassion, they are not perfectly full. Yet when one later repents and realizes these lustful and thieving thoughts can never be fulfilled, they melt away like snow and ice. At that moment of melting, this true heart is again perfectly full—you could then step onto a lotus pedestal and preach the Dharma to the multitude. A single spark of numinous light flickers and shines, bright and clear, illuminating the three-thousandfold great-thousand world. Thus it is said: when a thought arises in perfect fullness, it is the heart-mind’s true essence; the slightest deficiency makes it a deluded thought. This is why Mencius spoke of the inherent goodness of human nature.\n\nAnother asked: Master, you say joy, anger, sorrow, and delight all arise when external circumstances stimulate the heart-mind. Yet when one suddenly sees a child fall into a well, is this not also an external circumstance? And Mencius calls this alarm and compassion the “sprout of benevolence.” From this we see: benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are all the heart-mind stirred by encounter—inherently not present in the heart-mind. Yet Mencius says, “Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are rooted in the heart-mind,” and Confucians always claim that our nature inherently possesses benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom. How do you explain this?",

      "translated_text": "I replied: When Confucians speak of human nature, they generally use it to investigate principles and trace them to their source, hence saying they are “rooted in the heart-mind.” Yet if we discuss the substance of the heart-mind, it is originally without any thing—when utterly still and unmoving, it is no different from the great emptiness. Could one say the great emptiness contains benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom?\n\nSomeone countered: Heaven and earth giving life to things is called benevolence; the four seasons alternating is called righteousness; their coming and going in order is called propriety; distinguishing the myriad things is called wisdom. How can one say the great emptiness lacks benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom?\n\nI replied: These are the movements of qi-transformation flowing through the great emptiness. Qi-transformation flows within the great emptiness, but one cannot say qi-transformation *is* the great emptiness.\n\nAnother said: If qi-transformation exists within the great emptiness, then the human heart-mind naturally possesses benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom. Since qi-transformation flows within the great emptiness, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom operate within the human heart-mind—these are originally the same.\n\nI replied: This is speaking only of the latter part. Before qi-transformation ever existed, was there not still the great emptiness? The primordial true origin, void and quiescent, remained unchanged.\n\nAnother asked: Then is the theory of being “rooted in the heart-mind” incorrect?\n\nI replied: It is not incorrect. From the Supreme Ultimate onward, the great transformation daily tends toward life. Life is benevolence. Once there is benevolence, there must also be righteousness, propriety, and wisdom. Humans are born of benevolence, so the heart-mind reflects it—stirred by encounter, it arises. Tracing it thus, we arrive at the theory of being rooted in the heart-mind. Yet if we push inquiry to the very tip of the hundred-foot pole, even the word “heart-mind” cannot be spoken—how much less benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom? Thus, when Confucians discuss heart-mind and nature, they speak only of the latter half; Daoists discuss heart-mind and nature beginning from the first half. If joy, anger, sorrow, and delight all arise in accordance with the mean, this is benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom. But if there is the slightest deviation, it is human desire—hence one cannot call it “rooted in the heart-mind.”\n\nAfter the Supreme Ultimate, following the one stillness, the great transformation daily tends toward movement. Movement is rooted in stillness. Confucians speak of the intersection of movement and stillness in undifferentiated terms, hence the theory that benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are rooted in the heart-mind. Daoists trace things to their origin and end: to trace to the origin, one must exhaust the stillness before movement begins; to trace to the end, one must exhaust the movement after stillness concludes. This is the difference between Confucian and Daoist doctrines.\n\nYet the sages—Fuxi, Shennong, the Yellow Emperor, Yao, Shun, Yu, King Wen, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius—never failed to speak of this, though people did not perceive it. Daoists call it “emptiness”; Buddhists call it “void.” The void sees all, hears all. For example, when a thought arises, two people face each other—this one does not know that one, that one does not know this one, because of the barrier of physical form. The void has no barrier. The void is originally boundless and infinite, so when a person has a thought, those in the same room do not know it, yet the boundless and infinite void knows it. The *Book of Documents* says: “Heaven sees through the eyes of the people; Heaven hears through the ears of the people.” How do the people’s seeing and hearing reach Heaven? Because Heaven is void. Confucians’ caution in solitude is fear of the void. When petty people in private commit evil, the noble person sees their very lungs and liver—because the noble person’s heart-mind is void. Great indeed is the function of the void!\n\nSomeone asked: The void of my heart-mind and the void of the great emptiness differ in size. How can they see and hear all things?\n\nI replied: All things have duality; only the void is without duality. If the void of my heart-mind differs from the void of the great emptiness, then the void in a jar differs from the void in the air, the void in a room differs from the void in the courtyard, the void in the courtyard differs from the void above the roof—and within the world, there would be hundreds of millions of voids, unable to be compared or regarded as one. Consider: does the void have form? Does it have appearance? If the void had form and appearance, then the form of this void could not match the form of that void, the appearance of that void could not match the appearance of this void—one could truly say the void differs. But the void has no shores, no limits. All things have boundaries; only the void has no boundaries. All things have differences; only the void has no differences. All things have barriers; only the void has no barriers. All things have divisions; only the void has no divisions. Vast and boundless, round and full, within the one great void, a numinous light connects and permeates all. The void sees the tiniest hair; the void hears the buzzing of a fly or gnat—just as in a person’s body, blood and qi flow unimpeded, spirit harmonizes, and one feels the bite of a louse or the sting of a mosquito. How is the voidness of the void different from this? If you can dispel being and return to non-being, merging into the one void of the nature-sea, then the void of my heart-mind and the void of the great emptiness are like a wildfire and a household lamp—one and not two. If you speak of two voids, they are certainly not void. If it is true void, there is absolutely no duality. Test this by emptying yourself, and you will verify my words.\n\nThe Dao is one—unchanging yet ever-constant. After the Supreme Ultimate divides, at the beginning it is this moment, at the end it is this moment; at the beginning it is this thing, at the end it is this thing. From one world to ten thousand worlds, all is this moment, all is this thing—never the slightest change or loss of constancy. This is why the Dao is called the Dao.\n\nThe substance of the human heart-mind is originally unchanging and constant. That it changes and loses constancy is due to deluded thoughts and defiling dust—not the heart-mind itself.",

And Mencius calls this alarm and compassion the “sprout of benevolence.” From this we see: benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are all the heart-mind stirred by encounter—inherently not present in the heart-mind. Yet Mencius says, “Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are rooted in the heart-mind,” and Confucians always claim that our nature inherently possesses benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom. How do you explain this?",

      "translated_text": "If the heart-mind admits separation and union, duration and transience, should the Way of Heaven then be viewed in the same light? To know the Way of Heaven is to know the human heart-mind.\n\nYet in this world of birth and death, from beginning to end, men are ever deluded by wandering thoughts and defiling dust—when have they ever possessed a single moment of their true heart-mind? If one can perceive but a single moment of this heart-mind as one’s true heart-mind, then for an entire lifetime, for all ages across ten thousand kalpas, it remains this very heart-mind, no different in the least.\n\nThus, when a man is born, it is wandering thoughts and defiling dust that give rise to birth—his heart-mind is never born. When a man dies, it is wandering thoughts and defiling dust that bring about death—his heart-mind never dies. When a man passes through one kalpa or ten thousand kalpas, it is wandering thoughts and defiling dust that traverse the kalpas in endless succession—his heart-mind has never known a kalpa.\n\nTherefore, if one can perceive but a single moment of the heart-mind, then in that very moment, this heart-mind severs all ties with past and future lives, with one kalpa or ten thousand kalpas. It is never reborn, never dies, never falls into kalpas, transcends the Three Realms, and is forever freed from the cycle of rebirth. The suffering lies in growing ever more confused, ever more deluded—from death to birth, from birth to death, from one kalpa to ten thousand kalpas—wandering thoughts and defiling dust never cease for even a moment, like melon vines trailing endlessly, like kudzu tendrils spreading without end, branching upon branch, node upon node, infinite and unbroken!\n\nAlas, ten thousand kalpas stretch vast and boundless—how distant they seem! Yet because wandering thoughts and defiling dust never cease for even a moment, the Three Wretched Realms and Eight Difficulties recur again and again, returning and departing, becoming all too familiar. To speak of this is to weep in sorrow!\n\nYou, who are devoted to the Dao, must cultivate your spiritual root, broadly practice virtue, and earnestly seek to recognize that single moment of the heart-mind. With this moment of the heart-mind, you will have severed the path of birth and death. From a single day to an entire lifetime, from one moment to ten thousand kalpas, this very moment of the heart-mind presides. Extend this principle, expand upon it, and when the time comes for transcendence and ascension, the matter will be effortless indeed.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to Heaven, gives birth to Earth, gives birth to man and all things—and man is the most spiritually endowed. Only man can attain immortality and sagehood, only man can assist Heaven and support Earth. Thus, man is that which neither Heaven nor Earth can equal.\n\nNow, seekers of the mysterious: do you rely on the heavens, or do you take matters into your own hands? If man defers to Heaven, Heaven too defers to man. When Heaven and man defer to one another, in this vast universe, there are scarcely one or two who stand as pillars between Heaven and Earth. Alas, how numerous are men, yet how few truly become men!\n\nTherefore, those of noble aspiration must accomplish within the square inch of their own hearts deeds unparalleled since ancient times. Heaven relies on them for clarity, Earth for tranquility, and all beings for their existence. Is this man a transcendent? A sage? He is but an ordinary man—yet also a transcendent, a sage.\n\nAll things under Heaven are achieved by ordinary men. It is only that men refuse to be ordinary. They chant poems and compose verses, calling themselves men of talent, unaware that the world has no lack of such words! They paint mountains and rivers, styling themselves masters, unaware that the world has no lack of such brushstrokes! They squander their limited time in idle amusements of no benefit.

      "translated_text": "\"Who was Shun? Who am I?\" These words of the sages and worthies are indeed the eternal mirror of ages. The great Dao is like cloth, silk, beans, and grain—go a single day without it, and cold and hunger press upon the body; stray a single day from the Dao, and one falls into the realm of beasts. Though they appear covered in fur and horned, differing in form from us, when measured within the square inch of the heart, are they different or the same? Perhaps they are the same.\n\nAlas! What they see now, we shall see in the future. The scriptures of the *Great Cavern* are ancient and profound beyond fathoming; when practice is perfected and the heart-ground spiritually awakened, sudden comprehension arises. Yet knowing is not difficult—practicing is not easy. If you wish to fulfill your vow, you must be thorough from beginning to end, steadfast as the years pass. How then could attaining the true essence of the Dao and cultivating the supreme Way be difficult?\n\nThus, the Way of utmost sincerity enables foreknowledge. When reciting scriptures, let sincerity precede penetration. Turn inward and be sincere—no joy is greater. Then the ten thousand things are all complete within me. The human body contains the ten thousand things; without sincerity, there is delusion, and from delusion arise false conditions. The Three Corpses and Six Thieves follow the attachments of human intention, conjuring mirages like sea markets and towers, manifesting a thousand postures and ten thousand forms. The heart is like a skilled performer, and the Corpses and Thieves are its harm. Sincerity is reality; reality is truth; truth is the manifestation of the true spirit. With reverent heart, one sits in effortless dignity, and a jade countenance with golden essence emerges, stars arrayed like a chessboard. The heart is empty as a mirror, not a speck of dust adheres—this is the pure Dharma-body. With the Dharma-body attained, one must ascend to the Dharma-realm.\n\nThus, the learning of making the intention sincere and the heart upright is what people today disdain to hear. They claim the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi disregard the norms of propriety, prizing simplicity and brevity, unaware that rectifying the heart and making the intention sincere are the true and solid work of self-cultivation. To visit the Heavenly Lord or tread the immortal realms, one cannot escape the two words: sincerity and rectitude. Arrogance and indolence are thieves that harm the Dao; scholars must shun them like enemies and overcome them like demons before they may enter the hall of learning and become disciples of our Mystery Gate. Otherwise, of what use are they?\n\nThe aspirant to immortality first engages with the nature of the heart-mind, then proceeds to the crucible and furnace. Affairs have a beginning and an end, which cannot be reversed; principles have weight and priority, which must not be confused. If you can become a sage or worthy, why fear not becoming a buddha or immortal? The Primordial Heavenly King was also once a human. Mencius said: *\"All people can become Yao or Shun.\"* Truly so. People generally say the Primordial Heavenly King is the supreme being of prior Heaven. But I ask: who in the world comes from posterior Heaven? Clarity, emptiness, mystery, and brightness—these are prior Heaven. Stupidity, ignorance, baseness, and turbidity—these are posterior Heaven. People are divided into prior and posterior Heaven, but the heart has no such division. It depends on what one does; Heaven does not limit people by qualifications. Whether one becomes a sage or an ordinary person, it is for oneself to choose—do not waver in your heart.\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, there have only been two great paths. To become a sage is to become an immortal; as an immortal, one dwells in the heavenly palace, conversing at ease with the Primordial Heavenly King. To remain ordinary is to become a ghost; as a ghost, one resides in hell, constantly following King Yama. The division between heaven and hell lies solely in the heart. There is a path to Heaven, leading straight to the celestial abode. There is a path to the underworld, leading directly to the ghostly cavern. Confucius said: *\"The noble person ascends; the petty person descends.\"* Between ascent and descent, the distinction is subtle. The *Book of Documents* states: *\"The human heart is perilous; the Dao-heart is subtle. Between peril and subtlety, there is not even a hair’s breadth.\"* Reflecting on this, how can one not tremble?\n\nThe *Doctrine of the Mean* says: *\"Before joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness arise, it is called the Mean.\"* The Supreme Ultimate encompasses all things; from the utmost center, a single spark of numinous mechanism gives birth to Heaven and Earth, embracing the Two Modes, and the ten thousand things each attain their proper place. Extending this principle, the center of the human heart can be realized. The human heart is empty and most numinous; neither biased nor partial, when seeking its utmost center in stillness, it is naturally at ease; when seeking its utmost center in activity, it is naturally at ease. Heaven is non-active, yet the spirit moves within it; humans are non-active, yet the spirit guards their abode. Vast and boundless, it is one with the Great Void—how could the Creator drive and employ it?\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, yin and yang and the Five Phases congeal to form things—these are ghosts and spirits. When a single thought first stirs in a person, they fall into the yin realm, and ghosts and spirits know it. At this moment, if the mechanism turns, ghosts and spirits seize this opportunity to drive one into the sea of blood. Thus, from the time of birth, human emotions and perceptions arise daily, and cunning grows ever more refined—all due to this single thought. Those who study the Dao and pull out the root of birth and death do nothing more than uproot this single thought. If this thought does not move, how can ghosts and spirits drive one?\n\nThe ancient buddhas and tathāgatas, through countless kalpas, were followed by heavenly demons and external paths like clouds, yet when they sought the stirring of a thought, none could be found. Thus, they could long preserve the Dharma-body and eternally abide in the Dharma-realm. Today, in the time it takes to eat a meal, before the sun has moved, countless emotions, perceptions, and thoughts arise in swarms. To speak of studying the Dao in such a state—I have never heard of it. The ancient buddhas and tathāgatas, like ordinary people, wore clothes and ate meals, rising and resting, yet though no thought was unmoving, in truth no thought moved; though no moment passed without thought, in truth no moment had a moving thought. Confucius said: *\"At seventy, I could follow the desires of my heart without overstepping the bounds.\"*",
      "overlap_context": " mystery.\" Advance further upon the tip of the pole until you reach the great rest and great cessation—only then can you pluck out the root of birth and death. A great person presses forward with unyielding courage; once the resolve is sincere, heavenly demons retreat. Confucius said: *\"When it comes to benevolence, do not defer even to your teacher.\"* I am your teacher, yet the Dao is no other Dao, the Dharma no other Dharma. What I know, you too can know; what I practice, you too can practice.",

      "translated_text": "\"How wondrous these words! How perfect these words! Therefore, in studying the Dao, nothing precedes the refinement of the heart. Make the substance of the heart empty and round like a grain of millet—this is the most wondrous divine elixir, neither born nor dying, forever carefree and at ease. To become an immortal or a buddha is no more than this—what else could one seek? Yet people today seek the elixir rather than the Dao, speak of water and fire rather than the nature of the heart. Is this not abandoning the root to pursue the branches?\n\nThe sages of antiquity, in writing their books and establishing their teachings, never once mentioned the word *elixir*. The discourse on the elixir arose in the Han dynasty. For the lofty perfected ones of the upper realms, pitying the drowning of sentient beings, used the teaching of refining the elixir to guide and lift them toward the Dao. Later generations, however, divided it into two schools: *xing* (nature) and *ming* (life). In truth, without refining the heart, merely engaging in the arts of yin-yang and *li-kan* (water and fire), even until Maitreya’s descent, one will ultimately fail to achieve accomplishment.\n\nThe Great Elixir is formless and soundless, most numinous and wondrous. How can one use a defiled and vile heart as the vessel to contain it? Is this reasonable? The moment lustful thoughts arise, the true *qi* scatters and collapses. How can one use a body governed by the seven emotions and six desires as the crucible for the Great Elixir? Is this reasonable? Thus, the essentials of refining the elixir are entirely encompassed in the two words: *refining the heart*.\n\nThe essentials of the Great Dao are fully contained in *emptiness*. The single word *emptiness* encompasses all dharmas. From emptiness arises being—this is true being. From emptiness arises reality—this is true reality. The precious title of the Primordial Heavenly King is *Emptiness and Spontaneous Naturalness*. Even the ten thousand sages and perfected ones cannot transcend these four words. The reason all things are subject to birth and death is that they have not attained emptiness.\n\nHeaven has yin and yang, the five phases—thus, heaven is not empty. Earth has hardness and softness, dryness and dampness—thus, earth is not empty. Therefore, even heaven and earth cannot escape birth and death—how much less can humans! Consider ghosts and spirits: they seem empty, yet if they did not cultivate the Dao in life, though their physical forms are shed, the seven emotions, six desires, and the original spirit remain entangled. Thus, they drift in the netherworld, sinking into the realm of ghosts. Though they possess the virtue of intelligence and uprightness, they can scarcely approach the state of primordial transformation. Whether as *ling* (spirits) or *shuang* (souls), all are karmic consequences.\n\nOnly the cultivator who attains the Dao, thought after thought merging with emptiness, heart after heart without attachment, nurtures the numinous essence like a dragon embracing a pearl. The true light shines forth, harmonizing with the celestial realm of the Dharma to form a radiant pattern. How could such a one not ascend to the azure heavens?\n\nAlas! I have seen many in the world who cultivate the Dao, yet those who grasp its essentials are few. Why? Because they set their resolve solely on becoming immortals, and with their original minds, they generate countless deluded thoughts. They imagine immortals as unfathomably transformative, with boundless enjoyments, while their own great matter is left unexamined. Cultivating in this way, even after ten thousand kalpas, they will never find rest. Is this not lamentable?\n\nThe Most High became the Most High by maintaining a single heart across ten thousand kalpas, thought after thought undisturbed. Though governing creation, the Dao’s wonders arise naturally. In the true realm, one is carefree, forever without attachment, transforming without words, awe-inspiring without anger. How could one fabricate matters out of thin air? Responding to emptiness with emptiness, the principles of transformation unfold clearly. From the beginning of the world until now, it has been like a single day.\n\nHeaven has its highs and lows, immortals have their sages and commoners—ranks differ, but it depends on one’s virtue. None without cultivated virtue can hope to become an immortal. Can those of resolve afford to neglect this?\n\nThe word *elixir* holds a subtle principle. One must receive the true teachings from a true master. Even with a true master and true teachings, one must still devote oneself wholeheartedly, sever worldly ties, and take *illuminating the heart and seeing the nature* as the foremost task. The work of *kan-li* (water and fire) is the second vehicle, and *refining the body to divide the form* is the ultimate accomplishment of the third vehicle. As for ascension, it is only possible after fulfilling the three thousand merits and eight hundred deeds. This is not something the impatient and superficial can hope to achieve even by chance.\n\nThus, cultivators of the truth must first nurture their numinous essence and uphold their virtuous roots. Their words should not be uttered lightly, their eyes should not gaze wantonly, their ears should not listen indiscriminately, their actions should not be reckless. They must concentrate the Dao within themselves, asking whether they can face the true without shame. Only then should they set up the furnace and crucible, draw forth lead and refine mercury. Then the celestial spirits will assist them, demons will not dare to invade, and nine generations of ancestors will ascend to the immortal realms.\n\nYet people today, with their coarse and vulgar bodies, aspire to the affairs of ascending as immortals and entering sagehood. I ask: are the true officials of the Jade Palace like worldly wealth and status, to be seized by cunning or pursued by force? Thus, the worry is not that one cannot become an immortal, but that one cannot cultivate the Dao.\n\nConfucius said: *'The Dao is not far from man.'* The relationships of ruler and minister, father and child, elder and younger brother, friend and friend—these are the highest gateways to immortality. Countless lofty perfected ones entered through this path; there is no other way. To become a sage or a worthy is to naturally enjoy blessings in the celestial palace. To become a beast or a bird is to naturally suffer calamities in hell. Beneath the green peach blossoms, playing flutes and zithers, passing cups with immortal companions—or in the black mountain caves, swallowing iron and drinking steel, keeping company with *asuras*—which is sorrow, which is joy? Which path will you choose?\"",

      "translated_text": "The reason for all this lies solely in the divergence of paths within the heart. Alas, how perilous! Who is responsible for this? When a person gives rise to a single good thought, it is like a wisp of faint smoke; when they give rise to a single evil thought, it is like ten thousand towering mountains. Thus, how difficult it is for goodness to take form! How effortless it is for evil to accumulate! Therefore, those who illuminate the Dao must ensure that the sprouts of goodness grow ever fuller, until there is goodness without evil—then what immortality could not be attained?\n\nIn refining the elixir, there is no other method: stabilize the heart, harmonize the spirit, gladden the qi, and replenish the essence. Yin evil is the hidden pest of the elixir, and cunning is its sworn enemy. If one can maintain every thought in goodness, every step in goodness, then yin evil will naturally dissolve, and cunning will naturally perish. The heart will be perfectly stable, the spirit perfectly harmonious, the qi perfectly gladdened, and the essence perfectly replenished—every affair and thing will then be governed by the workings of the primordial. Otherwise, with a heart of filth and defilement, a spirit of clinging attachment, qi of superficiality, and essence of dissipation, one claims to have refined the elixir—will it succeed or not?\n\nThose who study the Dao possess an initial resolve, a central resolve, and a final resolve. What is the initial resolve? It is the making of a vow. What is the central resolve? It is the refusal to abandon the path halfway. What is the final resolve? It is the attainment of success. These three resolves are also three kinds of karmic obstructions. The initial vow, once made, becomes a deluded aspiration—a mass of false imaginings—hoping to become an immortal and enjoy the riches of the celestial palace. Though one does not abandon the path halfway, in the course of cultivation, there are several layers of transformation, self-devised and unable to follow a single great path to the end. One practices a method, then soon changes to another, discarding the old for the new in pursuit of quick results. As for the final step, it is the most crucial work: even if one has completed ninety-nine percent, it is as if nothing has been done. Clouds rise beneath the feet, a halo crowns the head—yet one regards these as utterly ordinary, for this is the mark of a person of great capacity. If, instead, joyful attachment arises, one will inevitably enter the demonic path, and years of toil will be cast aside in an instant—how grievously lamentable!\n\nThese three karmic obstructions are what the student must guard against. Those who study the Dao should cultivate *great stability*. What is *great stability*? It is stability when stable, and stability even when not stable. Floating clouds emerge from the peaks without intent; flowing water departs its source without design. The Daoist, in movement and stillness, sitting and reclining, is like a feather in the sky, following conditions and pursuing circumstances without the slightest trace of obstruction.

      "translated_text": "\"If you can be fully satisfied with yourself, I shall accompany you on a journey through the boundless expanse, amidst ten thousand clusters of auspicious clouds, with cranes and celestial pipes filling the sky—how joyous it will be! What do those who study the Dao strive for? Is it for longevity and immortality? Or for literary achievements and worldly success? It is for none of these. Only when one strives for nothing can one truly be called a student of the Dao. Does this mean that studying the Dao is useless? Laozi says: *'The useless is the root of use; the non-doing is the foundation of doing.'* Only when one understands this can one speak of the Dao.\n\nI see people in the world who, with deluded minds, vainly hope to ascend as immortals or attain sagehood, seeking to escape the Five Defiled Worlds. Yet the immortals in heaven daily come and go amidst the toils of the mundane, moved by compassion to relieve suffering. Compared to those in the world who idly eat, idle about, gossip, or engage in frivolous play, they are ten times more laborious and a hundredfold more diligent. After a thousand hardships, they may save one or two souls, yet this does little for the world. Even if these one or two transcend and depart, the suffering of all beings on earth remains unchanged, their ignorance undispelled. Alas! Does the heart of the sage ever reach its limit? Or is it limitless? The world may end, but the heart of the sage knows no end; the sun and moon may fade, but the heart of the sage knows no bounds. Thus, when one is on the verge of ascending as an immortal or attaining sagehood, one must take up the great burden of heaven and earth upon one’s shoulders. Only when all beings on earth are liberated can that burden be set down. The *Book of Documents* says: *'If even one person remains unsaved, it is my fault.'* The heart of the sage spans eons as if they were a single day.\n\nTherefore, those who truly study the Dao take saving the world and delivering others as their bounden duty. They do not seek longevity for themselves alone, nor do they pursue literary or worldly success. Clearly, they must act as parents to the countless beings in the Three Wretched Realms, the Eight Difficulties, the Six Paths, and the Four Births. Seeing their suffering, they taste it as their own; seeing their delusion, they drown in it as if it were theirs. By every means, they strive to make these beings heed their teachings and join them in the pure, non-doing realm of the Great Brahma Heaven. Only then is their long-held vow fulfilled. Thus, those who study the Dao must hold such aspirations, such a foundation, aligning their virtue with the encompassing heaven, the sustaining earth, the radiance of the sun, and the brightness of the moon. In their cultivation, the multitude of sages will naturally appear, and the gods will attend them, wishing for their success and attainment. Why? Because their aspirations, vows, and Dao are one—though there be thousands or tens of thousands, they are as one.\n\nHequzi, I urge you to take heed; this is my hope for you.\n\nThose who cultivate the truth have their origins. Some come from heaven, some from the immortal isles of Penglai or the sacred mountains, and some from the wisdom and blessings of the human world. Though these three paths differ, all can attain immortality. The first two are of great root and capacity; the moment their aspiration for the Dao arises, the heavenly spirits immediately take notice. Why? It is like a man who once held high office or briefly retired to the forests—his former colleagues and superiors are many. If he seeks to return to office, what difficulty is there? But those who come from wisdom and blessings must diligently cultivate in purity for ten or five years before they can move the heart of heaven and attract the attention of the immortals. It is like a poor scholar who, without self-exertion, will find no one to lift him up. Thus, this path is harder than the former, though their ultimate success is the same.\n\nOne must not, with meager virtue and shallow talent, vainly hope for the great Dao, like a frog at the bottom of a well gazing at the clouds—self-attainment is impossible. Even if one receives true transmission but fails to accumulate merit and deeds, stubbornly relying on one’s own efforts, true immortals will not come, and malevolent spirits will surely arrive, harming only oneself. Is this not deeply regrettable?\n\nFor beginners, whose power of concentration is still weak, one must recognize one’s origin. How can this be known? During cultivation, if the mind is spiritually open, as if past understandings suddenly unfold in abundance and wondrous insights arise ceaselessly, it is because sages are guiding from the void and protecting in secret—this marks one of superior root and capacity. If one relies on diligent effort, spending many years, achieving one part for one part, two parts for two parts, as the *Doctrine of the Mean* says: *'If others can do it once, I will do it a hundred times; if others can do it ten times, I will do it a thousand.'* With such perseverance, how could the immortals not take pity and save them? Sooner or later, their day will come. This is the path of those of middling root and capacity.\n\nIf one’s heart yearns for the Dao but lacks constancy, now practicing, now abandoning, clinging to the joys of family at home or the pleasures of socializing abroad, unable to endure stillness, with thoughts contrary to the Dao—this marks the lowest, rootless kind. Even if sages were to dwell with them, they could do nothing. If this is their state in this life, so it will be in the next. Once the human form is lost, how difficult it will be to regain!\n\nThose who cultivate the truth, even in the darkest corners and hidden places, are as if beneath the bright sun and open sky. With such true character, one is already a true immortal; treading the void and ascending the boundless is but one’s natural duty. If one can apply the talents of a hero to the learning of the sage, nurturing one’s *qi* with the practice of *shendu* (vigilance in solitude), then in the days to come, one will surely ascend to heaven, occupy a high position, deliver the suffering in the netherworld, bless one’s descendants, and achieve a great and illustrious legacy. Is this not magnificent?\n\nYet I see those of the common world who possess not a single virtue or talent to surpass the masses, yet vainly aspire to the arts of *kan* and *li* (water and fire), their worldly attachments still unsevered—how could the immortal embryo take form?\"",

      "translated_text": "Those whose aspirations lie in mere warmth and sustenance yet dream of the pure and void—does this not move the countless lofty perfected ones of the Great Brahma Heaven to helpless laughter? Here and now, I plainly reveal to all: those who are neither sages nor heroes must not hope to become immortals; those who are not masters of the Confucian tradition should not presume to be disciples of the Mystery Gate. Heaven’s law is most severe, and its hearing reaches even the lowest. A single reckless thought brings calamity upon seven generations. Wherever this scripture resides, auspicious light and purple qi rise to pierce the clouds; the heavens rejoice, the host of sages gather to behold it, and its boundless merit defies all reckoning.\n\nShould any unworthy wretch, ignorant of true cultivation, dare to slander it, the flying heavenly divine kings shall strike down his person, and his kin shall suffer as well—afflicted in life with strange maladies, cast after death into Fengdu Hell, drifting through ten thousand kalpas in boundless darkness. Though they may repent then, what use will it be? Beware, all!\n\n**Postscript**\nI, Jue, at thirty-nine years of age, knew nothing of the art of cultivating the true. Not until the year *jiyou*, when I turned forty, did I receive the Great Method of the Primordial Sovereign’s brush and scripture, and by the descent of the Venerable Master of Azure Radiance, the Ancestral Teacher of the Dao, was I instructed with earnest and repeated admonitions. Only then did I learn that within heaven and earth there exists a Way of immortality and deathlessness, attainable by all, regardless of saint or commoner, and obtainable by those who seek it.\n\nFrom that time onward, I delved daily into the alchemical classics, probing their principles. Seeing how they established false names and symbols, guarding their secrets closely, I sighed and said: The alchemical classics were composed to deliver people and awaken the world, yet such deep concealment does not deliver but only misleads, does not awaken but only confounds. Even if Yan [Hui] and Min [Sun] were to return, how could they grasp even a fraction of it?\n\nYet our Venerable Master of Azure Radiance directly points to the true essence, opening for all beings of the ten thousand ages a vast and level path, broad and unobstructed, by which one may ascend directly to the Three Pure Ones and unite heart-to-heart with the Primordial Heavenly King. The reason the alchemical classics guard their secrets so closely is truly out of fear that they might be mistransmitted to the unworthy, violating the statutes of the Most High. But since our Venerable Master has taken \"refining the heart\" as the gateway to the great method, transmission naturally finds its proper recipient, and the unworthy cannot intrude.\n\nFor how could there be an unworthy person willing to refine the heart, or one who refines the heart yet remains unworthy? In the act of transmission, what room is there for doubt? As for the subtleties of gathering and firing, they are but minor details. Within these minor details, the supreme principle is already complete. If one truly refines the heart to attain spiritual clarity, this principle will naturally be realized.\n\nAlas! The system established by our Venerable Master may be called simple yet strict, direct yet subtle, broad yet not indulgent, great yet precise—unprecedented since ancient times! I, Jue, have served the Venerable Master for three years, enduring extraordinary hardships: twice, perilous walls collapsed, yet father and son escaped death; bandits passed our door without entering; neighbors suffered plagues, yet we remained untouched; malignant sores, poisonous fevers, and chronic ailments all vanished. We ate coarse vegetables and wore plain cloth, yet our needs were met without seeking.\n\nThis humble disciple, Jue, a lowly corpse of the vulgar world, has been illuminated by the celestial light of the Primordial Sovereign’s Dao, granted a path upward, and blessed with the grace of parents, teachers, and guardians, as well as the virtue of heaven and earth in nurturing and completing all things. To transmit the scriptures and spread the teachings is a once-in-a-millennium opportunity; having encountered this moment, one must not squander it. The Venerable Master’s protection of this humble disciple is in truth meant for this disciple to protect this scripture, passing it on to future generations, through one kalpa, ten thousand kalpas, and endless kalpas to come. How could I, Jue, not exert myself to fulfill the Venerable Master’s intent?\n\n**Preface by Dharma Heir Dongyang Hequzi**\n\n**Postscript**\nConfucius said: \"The Way has two paths—benevolence and its absence.\" Our Mystery Gate’s Dao likewise has two: the true Dharma and heterodox views. Those firmly rooted in the true are not easily swayed by the false, just as those deeply mired in the false are difficult to pull toward the true.\n\nYet there are those on the verge of drowning but not yet submerged, and those who wish to enter the true but cannot hold fast to it, lingering between success and failure. To these, I still have something to say. The essence of the great Dao originally arises from the void to generate being—is this not what the Confucians mean when they say, \"First, there is the One Principle within, which scatters into the ten thousand affairs\"? Then, from being it returns to non-being, restoring our original state of primordial oneness with the Great Void—is this not what the Buddhists mean by \"the ten thousand dharmas return to the One, and the One returns to the void\"?\n\nExtending this principle, the blossoming and fruiting of plants, the cycles of spring and autumn, the flourishing and withering of human affairs, the ebb and flow of the primordial and the eternal—all are but the fixed pattern of beginning and end, contraction and expansion, departure and return. What doubt can there be?\n\nWhat is truly strange is this: the Confucian Way of the *Doctrine of the Mean* shines like the sun and moon, illuminating past and present; the Buddhist school of true awakening spreads like great bridges and vast rafts across the world. Yet the pure and true principles of our Daoist teachings—the true essence of nature and life—are nearly discarded like worn-out sandals by those who discourse on the profound. Why is this? It is solely due to the rampant spread and deep poison of heterodox teachings and side doors.\n\nAlas, how bitter it is for me!",

How could I not pour forth the bitter lament of my past struggles—those years of toil and anguish?\n\nYet now, having regained the joy of returning to nature, shall I not proclaim it to the world and rescue those drowning in the Daoist gate, lifting them all to the shore of the Way? In the year *gengzi*, while sojourning in You County in southern Chu, I chanced upon the *True Teachings on Singing the Dao*, five scrolls penned by Hequzi and revealed by the Azure Emperor of Pure Radiance. Reading it again and again, savoring its words, I felt as one awakening from a dream at the sound of morning bells, or warmed by spring’s gentle breeze while sipping sweet wine—where ten thousand sounds harmonize, every countenance must shine. Alas, why is this scripture not made known to the world, to serve as right understanding for our pure and true lineage?\n\nI had long wished to carve and publish it, yet my desire remained unfulfilled. This autumn, Tuo Luozi Yichun and Guan Sanzi from Haining, having journeyed once more from Nanchang, visited me in the Golden Ox Cave of Jishui. I had not known that Guan San, though of noble birth, had devoted himself to our Way. Upon hearing of his past inquiries, I found that more than half of what he had learned from his teachers were the same misleading doctrines I once endured—speeches of *qian*-dragon and *kun*-tiger, of striking bamboo and plucking zithers. Yet, being my elder by a day and perceiving his open heart and untrammeled speech—truly one of heroic talent drawn to true cultivation—I explained for him the key to the mysterious gate, the mechanism of death and life, the *zhen*-male and *dui*-female, the golden tripod and jade furnace. All these are but dharma-appearances, mere metaphors for the formless.\n\nGuan San, by nature pure and swift of root, leapt at a single word, and all his doubts dissolved. I then showed him this scripture to confirm my teaching. Moved by my long-held aspiration, Chenzi generously pledged to carry it back to eastern Zhe, bearing the cost alone to have it finely carved for me. Once completed, he would bring the printing blocks to fulfill my lifelong wish.\n\nAh! In this act of Guan San, compassion arises from hidden depths—half the merit of three thousand eight hundred deeds is already his. If this is so, then is it not that Heaven does not conceal the Dao, and this scripture emerges to serve as a bridge across the bitter sea? Is it not that Guan San has a karmic bond with immortality, and thus Heaven did not entrust it to another but awaited a worthy one to transmit it? And is it not that Heaven, pitying my fervent devotion to the teaching, refused to let me labor alone in spirit, secretly aiding me to swiftly accomplish this work?\n\nReflecting on this, the obtaining of this scripture is already wondrous, yet its publication is even more so! Where there is thought, there is resonance; where there is feeling, there is communion. If people abandon the Dao, how has the Dao ever abandoned them? Here stands a great path, bright and clear; here sits a dharma-gate, luminous and open. It is near, within oneself; it is not apart from one’s own mind. To seek afar what is close, to pursue the difficult while ignoring the easy—those who fall into such snares and deem themselves wise are dull roots indeed, turning one way without return. Their illness admits no cure.\n\nAt this moment, I pray that my fellow Daoist adepts, whose afflictions are not yet deep—those malleable as uncarved stone, poised between the common and the sagely—may, by good fortune, encounter this scripture. May they early cast aside fish-eyes to grasp the pearl within their robes, thoroughly wash away passions and desires, and guard against deceit while seeking contentment. Thus may they inwardly preserve their nature and life, and outwardly accumulate merit and virtue. Then the unseen responses of the Azure Emperor of Pure Radiance, as described in this scripture, will surely manifest—I have witnessed it myself!\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Guiyi Wan Qinghe, disciple of the Complete Perfection tradition, at the Golden Ox Cave in Jishui.",
      "overlap_context": "the *Doctrine of the Mean* shines like the sun and moon, illuminating past and present; the Buddhist school of true awakening spreads like great bridges and vast rafts across the world. Yet the pure and true principles of our Daoist teachings—the true essence of nature and life—are nearly discarded like worn-out sandals by those who discourse on the profound. Why is this? It is solely due to the rampant spread and deep poison of heterodox teachings and side doors.\n\nAlas, how bitter it is for me!",
