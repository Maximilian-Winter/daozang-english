The compiler is unknown, but it likely dates to the Tang dynasty. It purports to record the Most High Lord Lao’s teachings to the perfected immortals and celestial masters on summoning spirits, wearing talismans, dispelling illness, and extending destiny. One fascicle.\n\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Section on Divine Writings of the Cavernous Divine Department*.\n\n---\n\n**The Most High Lord Lao’s Sublime Scripture on Prolonging Life and Augmenting Destiny**\n\nOnce, the Most High Lord Lao dwelt in the Azure Heavens above the land of Chanli, where he beheld men and women afflicted by illness and hardship, their lives cut short against all reason, their allotted years unfulfilled. With his wisdom of other minds, he probed the profound mysteries, his countenance turning in compassion. He summoned the celestial officials of the ten directions, the perfected lords of the Five Peaks, and the Directors of Longevity and Destiny, who gathered at his side upon a seat of seven treasures and lapis lazuli. The lords of the celestial palaces, the talismanic charts of the Six Jia, the gods of heaven and earth—an innumerable host—all came to bow in reverence, kneeling in attendance, holding their tablets with solemnity, to receive his teachings.\n\nThe Dao declared: \"Among the people of the lower realms, those who believe in the Dao are few. They do not seek life, and their evil accumulates day by day, growing ever more entrenched. Unaware of the True Lords, they invite manifold misfortunes and are constantly beset by the six afflictions.\" Moved by pity for the multitudes, the Most High commanded the Perfected Lord of Longevity of the Eastern Ultimate to summon the divine envoys of the Six Jia, each accompanied by boundless retinues. They traverse the lands, bearing this scripture to instruct and transform, awakening the ignorant and bestowing upon them talismanic threads to wear upon their bodies. By reciting the scripture and augmenting their destiny, by maintaining purity and fasting, they may prolong their years and escape calamities.\n\nIf there are devout men and women who receive, uphold, and venerate this scripture—burning incense, sweeping clean, and never growing weary, diligent day and night, honoring the Three Treasures—they shall embody great compassion and universal salvation, rescuing those in peril, relieving suffering, dispelling demons, and dissolving misfortunes, eradicating evil and restoring clarity.\n\n**General Wang Wenqing of Jiazi**, with an entourage of one hundred thirty-nine, grants me an augmentation of twelve thousand destinies. Those he protects attain fulfillment, their true spirits settling in their hearts, their malignant illnesses dispelled.\n\n**General Zhan Zijiang of Jiaxu**, with an entourage of one hundred thirty-five, grants me an augmentation of twelve thousand destinies. Those he protects find their bodies freed from afflictions and misfortunes averted.\n\n**General Hu Wenchang of Jiashen**, with an entourage of one hundred thirty, nurtures me with an augmentation of twelve thousand destinies, reviving the souls and spirits of those he protects.\n\n**General Wei Shangqing of Jiawu**, with an entourage of one hundred thirty-nine, bestows upon me an augmentation of twelve thousand destinies, safeguarding those he protects for a span of one hundred twenty years.\n\n**General Meng Feiqing of Jiachen**, with an entourage of one hundred thirty-five, supports me with an augmentation of twelve thousand destinies, shielding those he protects from encountering evil.\n\n**General Ming Wenzhang of Jiayin**, with an entourage of one hundred thirty-one, rescues me with an augmentation of twelve thousand destinies, defending those he protects from all malevolent demons.\n\n**The Lords of the Three Origins of the Sixty Jiazi** and **The Lords of Augmenting Destiny for Myriad Lives**—if one’s destiny is exhausted, the grace of the Great Sage can extend their years. Ten thousand destinies descend to augment mine. The Dao is capable of sheltering and loving, of rescuing and protecting, of generating and completing, of nurturing and fostering. If one’s destiny is spent, the Dao can augment it by twelve thousand nine hundred ninety-nine destinies, aligning it with the Dao’s steadfastness. Heaven and earth unite in virtue, and the myriad things flourish. The Dao is capable of generation. The True Lords descend to the world to grant me long life, augmenting my destiny. Endowed with primordial qi, it abides eternally. Twelve thousand seven hundred kinds of Dao descend to protect humanity. For those afflicted by illness, **Lord Han the Elder**, the **Jade Maiden of Luminous Medicine**, and the **Straightforward Talisman Clerks**—forty-eight thousand in all—come to heal. If demonic influences or malevolent spirits invade, three thousand five hundred perfected ones, including **Great Compassion and Radiant Brilliance**, swiftly shatter the demons, severing their baleful influences. A hundred misfortunes crumble and vanish. The transformative power of the Dao is boundless. It augments my destiny by three thousand destinies, guarding the body so that life becomes firm and strong, courageous and diligent in progress. Five hundred immortals descend to augment my destiny by ten thousand destinies, protecting the lives of humanity for nine hundred million years. Ever abiding in the true Dao, the flourishing of the Great Sage spreads life. My destiny is augmented, and my years become natural. A hundred thousand myriad destinies constantly guard the body, opening the gates of wisdom and attaining unimpeded understanding. Ten thousand destinies descend to augment my destiny by thirty-five thousand destinies, protecting the body so that its majesty and decorum are complete. All demons are vanquished. Nine thousand myriad perfected ones and divine youths augment my destiny, riding the three thousand sagely Dao to fulfill my aspirations.\n\nAt that time, the Most High Lord Lao, together with the perfected ones, divine youths, and **Master Wen Shi** of virtuous countenance, all turned toward the true origin, universally augmenting destinies and protecting my body. Twelve thousand divine talismans forge and subdue the demonic poisons of mountains and forests, earth altars, and all who rely on forms and sounds, falsely claiming divine authority—all are compelled to be destroyed.\n\nThe talismans of the Most High subdue the demonic **Wind Kings**, the **Stove Lords** of decay, the **Water Dragons**, the **Earth Lords** of harmful qi, causing them all to vanish.\n\nThe talismans of the Six Jia subdue the **Five Harms** and **Six Wastings**, evil dreams, ominous songs, wild curses, **chimei** and **wangliang** spirits, and blood ghosts—all are eradicated.\n\nThis scripture is most venerable and sublime, its power beyond description. It is the king of all scriptures, foremost in subduing demons and eradicating falsehood. Those who diligently cultivate its profound principles shall see their virtue flow into the One Vehicle. Great blessings shall universally pervade. Guard it carefully and do not lightly disclose it. Practice it according to the method, treasuring and revering it.\n\nHold it in your heart and contemplate it, for the Dao does not speak falsely. Those who follow its commands shall be untouched by evil. Their transgressions shall be erased, their grievances dissolved. Their bodies shall be healthy, their dwellings peaceful, and the sources of ten thousand calamities severed.\n\nThe Greedy Wolf Star governs malevolent qi, the Great Gate Star governs corpse infestations, the Wealth Star governs the hundred ghosts, the Literary Star governs slander and strife, the Integrity Star governs nightmares, the Martial Star governs official disputes, the Ruined Army Star governs demonic depletion, the Left Auxiliary Dipper Star governs human lifespan, the Right Assistant Dipper Star governs spirits and gods, and the Three Terraces Stars protect the body and life.\n\nThe first is the Evil Star, the second the Auspicious Star, the third the Warding Star, the fourth the Blazing Star, the fifth the Perilous Star—dispelling calamities and delivering from tribulations, expelling epidemic qi and diseases from all under heaven, along with jealous, obstructive, and disorderly ghosts, swiftly banishing them ten thousand miles away. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances of the Most High Lord Lao!\n\nThe first is the Heart-Opening Talisman, the second the Lifespan-Enhancing Talisman, the third the Life-Protecting Talisman, the fourth the Talisman of the Five Phases in Harmony, the fifth the Talisman Governing the Living and Subduing the Dead and Depleting Ghosts. By the methods of their generation, all malevolent entities shall scatter and perish at the sight of these talismans. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\n\nThe Six Jia Generals reside in the Upper Prime, the first day of the first month of the jiazi year. The Most High Lord Lao and the Celestial Master, in the first year of Han An, in the fifth month on the renwu day at the Red Stone City’s cliffside abode, broke stone as a token. For the people who uphold the Dao, when their lifespan nears its end, their years wane, or their months bring misfortune, they should bathe, burn incense, fast, and meditate. Upon hearing of the Most High’s divine talismans, which protect the myriad families and ensure a century without lack—if the year, month, day, or hour brings decline or taboo—one should wear the divine talisman to avoid misfortune. The true talisman of the Great Dao, bestowed upon the person, will carry them past disasters and tribulations, increasing their years and enhancing their lifespan. After receiving the talisman, their life shall be prolonged. Nine hundred million talismans of the Dao shall guard their body and life, granting the wish to reach one hundred and twenty years, their lifespan fully realized. The Three Palaces and Cinnabar Fields shall be filled with true qi, their body radiant with light. The various immortals shall give them life, the scriptures shall bear them, the sun and moon shall illuminate them, jade light shall reflect upon them, yin and yang shall nurture them, the four seasons shall nourish them, the five mushrooms shall shade them, the five clouds shall cover them, the five perfected shall protect them, the Six Jia shall give them life, the Five Emperors shall assist them, the five harmonies shall delight them, the five weapons shall defend them, the stars and constellations shall shelter them, the true sages shall guard them, the immortals shall support them, the jade maidens shall attend them, the Azure Dragon shall lead them, the White Tiger shall accompany them. Nobles, officials, and commoners shall love them, the hundred surnames shall revere them, the myriad people shall cherish them, elders shall comply with them, their village shall esteem them. Bows, arrows, blades, weapons, bandits, and thieves shall depart from them; tigers, wolves, vipers, snakes, insects, and beasts shall avoid them; the five poisons and gu sorcery shall flee from them.\n\nAfter the disciple wears the talisman, the heavens shall open fourfold paths, the hundred ghosts shall submit, they shall not drown if they fall into water, nor burn if they tread through fire. Their comings and goings shall be auspicious, free from misfortune and calamity. The four seas and five peaks shall be guarded by generals, the heavenly Dao fully arrayed in defense, and the ten thousand methods universally proclaimed.\n\nThe Most High’s divine scripture, the worthies and sages shall guard them, good medicine shall be offered to them, the mysteries of fortune and misfortune thoroughly explored. The divine talisman shall protect them, the hundred ghosts shall avoid them, the immortal Dao shall remember them, the gates of heaven shall open to them, the gates of earth shall close to them. Pure springs shall quench their thirst, divine beings shall guide them, the Wind Earl shall escort them, the Rain Master shall clear their path.\n\nThose who oppose this talisman shall die, those who turn their backs on it shall perish. The talisman suppresses jealous, depleting, and silkworm-harming ghosts; the talisman suppresses ghosts of recent and old deaths, wailing, male and female, broken calamities, and lingering misfortunes; the talisman suppresses ghosts of mountains, forests, altars, and field lords, along with those of decaying corpses; the talisman suppresses wandering lights, spirits, and the hundred monstrosities; the talisman suppresses ghosts of red-tongued curses, oaths, and pledges; the talisman suppresses ghosts of neighboring households, construction, and earth-moving corpse afflictions; the talisman suppresses ghosts of daily wandering earth qi and taboos; the talisman suppresses ghosts of bloody deaths, untimely demises, and violent ends; the talisman suppresses ghosts of those who died in battle or in prison; the talisman suppresses ghosts of male and female calamities; the talisman suppresses ghosts of the wrongfully killed.\n\nNow the disciple receives the divine talisman of the Great Dao. In movement and stillness, the four paths shall open. They shall not suffer from nightmares, auspicious omens shall daily increase, and all their wishes and desires shall be fulfilled. A thousand methods, ten thousand laws, the true and upright power—just as the talisman commands. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances of the Most High Dao Lord!\n\nThe first is the Heart-Opening Talisman,\nThe second the Lifespan-Enhancing Talisman,\nThe third the Life-Protecting Talisman,\nThe fourth the Talisman of the Five Phases in Harmony,\nThe fifth the Talisman Governing the Living and Subduing the Dead and Depleting Ghosts.\n\nThe talisman suppresses mountain and forest ghosts,\nThe talisman suppresses five-earth ghosts,\nThe talisman suppresses wandering earth qi ghosts,\nThe talisman suppresses ghosts of untimely death,\nThe talisman suppresses ghosts of prison death,\nThe talisman suppresses ghosts of the wrongfully killed,\nThe talisman suppresses red-tongued ghosts,\nThe talisman suppresses male and female ghosts,\nThe talisman suppresses ghosts of bloody death.\n\nThus concludes the Most High Lord Lao’s *Sublime Scripture on Prolonging Life and Enhancing Lifespan*.",

Bows, arrows, blades, weapons, bandits, and thieves shall depart from them; tigers, wolves, vipers, snakes, insects, and beasts shall avoid them; the five poisons and gu sorcery shall flee from them.\n\nAfter the disciple wears the talisman, the heavens shall open fourfold paths, the hundred ghosts shall submit, they shall not drown if they fall into water, nor burn if they tread through fire. Their comings and goings shall be auspicious, free from misfortune and calamity. The four seas and five peaks shall be guarded by generals, the heavenly Dao fully arrayed in defense, and the ten thousand methods universally proclaimed.\n\nThe Most High’s divine scripture, the worthies and sages shall guard them, good medicine shall be offered to them, the mysteries of fortune and misfortune thoroughly explored.

Pure springs shall quench their thirst, divine beings shall guide them, the Wind Earl shall escort them, the Rain Master shall clear their path.\n\nThose who oppose this talisman shall die, those who turn their backs on it shall perish. The talisman suppresses jealous, depleting, and silkworm-harming ghosts; the talisman suppresses ghosts of recent and old deaths, wailing, male and female, broken calamities, and lingering misfortunes; the talisman suppresses ghosts of mountains, forests, altars, and field lords, along with those of decaying corpses; the talisman suppresses wandering lights, spirits, and the hundred monstrosities; the talisman suppresses ghosts of red-tongued curses, oaths, and pledges; the talisman suppresses ghosts of neighboring households, construction, and earth-moving corpse afflictions; the talisman suppresses ghosts of daily wandering earth qi and taboos; the talisman suppresses ghosts of bloody deaths, untimely demises, and violent ends; the talisman suppresses ghosts of those who died in battle or in prison; the talisman suppresses ghosts of male and female calamities; the talisman suppresses ghosts of the wrongfully killed.\n\nNow the disciple receives the divine talisman of the Great Dao. In movement and stillness, the four paths shall open. They shall not suffer from nightmares, auspicious omens shall daily increase, and all their wishes and desires shall be fulfilled. A thousand methods, ten thousand laws, the true and upright power—just as the talisman commands. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances of the Most High Dao Lord!\n\nThe first is the Heart-Opening Talisman,\nThe second the Lifespan-Enhancing Talisman,\nThe third the Life-Protecting Talisman,\nThe fourth the Talisman of the Five Phases in Harmony,\nThe fifth the Talisman Governing the Living and Subduing the Dead and Depleting Ghosts.\n\nThe talisman suppresses mountain and forest ghosts,\nThe talisman suppresses five-earth ghosts,\nThe talisman suppresses wandering earth qi ghosts,\nThe talisman suppresses ghosts of untimely death,\nThe talisman suppresses ghosts of prison death,\nThe talisman suppresses ghosts of the wrongfully killed,\nThe talisman suppresses red-tongued ghosts,\nThe talisman suppresses male and female ghosts,\nThe talisman suppresses ghosts of bloody death.\n\nThus concludes the Most High Lord Lao’s *Sublime Scripture on Prolonging Life and Enhancing Lifespan*.",
