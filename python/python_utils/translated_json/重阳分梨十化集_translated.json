  "full_translation": "**Title: *The Ten Transformations of Chongyang’s Divided Pear – A Collection***\n\n**Preface to *The Ten Transformations of Chongyang’s Divided Pear***\n\nThe Master of Dan yang was of the lineage of Fu feng, a kinsman of the great scholar Ma Dabian. His family wealth was vast, and his descendants were distinguished. From his youth, he studied Confucianism, yet never feigned merit for gain, and his nature was inclined toward quietude and contentment, delighting in emptiness and nothingness.\n\nHe once told his associates: *\"I met a strange man in a dream, and through his laughter, I attained enlightenment.\"*\n\nIn the autumn of the year Ding hai, during the reign of Emperor Da Zheng (大定), the Chongyang True Person (重陽真人) departed from Zhongnan Mountain (終南), traveled to the Sea Islands (海島), and sought to gather kindred spirits to journey together to Penglai (蓬萊), fulfilling the vow to pay homage to the Original Master (本師). Arriving in the east at Ninghai (寧海), he first visited the *Hall of the Immortal’s Encounter* (遇仙亭) of Fan Ming shu (范明叔). Master Dan yang followed and paid his respects to the True Person, and upon their first meeting, he was deeply moved.\n\n*\"In the past, I once glimpsed the Dao through a fleeting encounter—now I see that you, Master Dan yang, have long been destined for the Way.\"* Recognizing his innate affinity with the Dao, the True Person earnestly urged him to study the Way and cultivate True Nature (修真).\n\nMaster Dan yang, humbled by his guidance, respectfully invited the True Person to dwell in his county’s southern hermitage (南庵), which he named *Complete Perfection* (全真). Day and night, they expounded the Dao within. The True Person wished for Master Dan yang and his wife to swiftly abandon worldly attachments, forsake their native land, and become wandering *cloud-water* (雲水) practitioners. Initially, they were reluctant to comply.\n\nThe True Person then swore to refine the hermitage over a hundred days, beginning on the first auspicious day of the second month of winter (孟冬初吉), and bestowed upon him a whole pear (浑梨), commanding him to consume it. Every ten days, he would request another pear, which the True Person divided and sent to him and his wife, gradually increasing from two pieces to fifty-five. Every five days, he also received six each of yams and chestnuts (芋栗).\n\nAs the Chongyang True Person appeared in his dreams, warning him of the ten grave offenses leading to hellish retribution or celestial blessings, he composed verses—sometimes in praise, sometimes veiled with deeper meaning—to accompany each gift. Master Dan yang responded in kind, his poems revealing the profound interplay of *yin-yang* (陰陽) and the cosmic balance of odd and even numbers, as well as the mechanics of fate, virtue, and the cycles of life and death.\n\nThus, he abandoned worldly entanglements, altered his attire, burned his oath of secular life, and both he and his wife devoted themselves to the True Person as disciples.\n\nBy the year Ji chou (己丑), he accompanied the Chongyang True Person on his return journey to Liang (梁) and Bian (汴). After spending a year there, the True Person ascended to immortality. Master Dan yang then transmitted his teachings and, with his disciples, traveled westward to Zhongnan Mountain, seeking the True Person’s former retreat. He constructed a modest dwelling there and resided for ten years, expounding his doctrine. His disciples gathered in multitudes, beyond count.\n\nIn the year Ren yin (壬寅), Master Dan yang returned home with his staff (飛錫束來), once again visiting his native lands. One day, he spoke to his assembled disciples: *\"The Chongyang True Person, in his lifetime, already composed *The Complete Perfection Collection: Before and After* (全真前後集). Additionally, during his sojourn in our region, he wrote many works on profound metaphysical discourse and wondrous principles, totaling over three hundred pieces, which I have compiled into three sections: the first titled *The Late Awakening* (下手遲), the middle *The Ten Transformations of Divided Pear* (分梨十化), and the final *The Reluctance to Leave Home* (好離鄉). Though this collection has been printed in the west, few copies have reached our lands. My disciples have urged me to revise and annotate these works, organizing them into three volumes, and commissioning artisans to carve them onto wooden blocks for wider dissemination.\"*\n\nJingzhenzi Zhu Baoyi (靈眞子朱抱一), one of Master Dan yang’s disciples, brought this collection to me and requested a preface. I replied: *\"I am but a humble scholar, still laboring over my studies to advance my career. How could I dare to follow in the footsteps of the great masters, let alone claim detachment from fame and worldly concerns? Yet, even as a child, I knew of Master Dan yang’s reverence for the Dao, and I have witnessed firsthand the Chongyang True Person’s extraordinary efforts in refining the hermitage and guiding others. Though my understanding is shallow, I cannot refuse.\"*\n\nThus, I retained *The Ten Transformations of Divided Pear* (分梨十化) alone. I hope this may inspire practitioners of the Way across the land, spreading the profound benefits of Complete Perfection (全真) teachings far and wide.\n\nAs for the Chongyang True Person’s exhortations, divine signs, and other records, prefaces, songs, and poems—these are already well-documented. Here, I merely recount the origins of Master Dan yang and his wife’s entrance into the Dao.\n\nThis preface was written in the year Gui mao (癸卯) of the Da Zheng reign (大定), at the request of the scholar-official Ma Dabian (馬大辨), a native of Dong Mou xiang (東牟鄉), Ninghai Prefecture (寧海州).\n\n**Volume One of *The Ten Transformations of Chongyang’s Divided Pear*:**\nComposed by Chongyang True Person Wang Zhen (重陽子王矗) of Zhongnan Mountain (終南山).\n\n**Water Cloud Wanderer (水云游):**\nDwell yet, dwell yet—\nIn the tenth month’s small spring,\nOne must lock the door.\nA hundred days—refine Chongyang’s essence,\nNo need for contrivance.\nThe whole body must reveal its true, unadorned nature.\nHang the paper of luminous clarity.\nTrust in it—\nAs jade flies and gold walks,\nOne remains serene, unmindful.\n\n---\n\n**Dan Yang’s Continuation (丹阳继韵):**\nNot dwell, not dwell—\nThe Fire Hall must be abandoned,\nDeeply proper to part the doors.\nThe Harmful Wind Immortal\nTransforms my bolted gate—\nThis practice must be done.\nAbstain from meat’s defilement, ever eat of plainness.\nHang only hempen cloth upon the body.\nAwait the hundred mornings\nWhen the lock’s key opens—\nEmulate my teacher’s inward gaze.\n\n---\n\n**Ode to Dan Yang (赠丹阳绝句):**\nToday’s Chongyang is the very time of Zhengyi.\nHow can one know the taste of the whole pear?\nIf one can drink the West River’s waters,\nOne will surely follow the *King’s Wind* closely.\n\n---\n**Dan Yang’s Reply (丹阳次韵):**\nWhen the Harmful Wind Immortal locked me in Chongyang’s hall,\nYou granted me the pear’s taste—I know it well.\nMy heart has left home, wandering cloud and water,\nThe Dao reveals its secrets—dragons and tigers follow.\n\n---\n\n**Water Cloud Wanderer (水云游):**\nJade nature, jade nature—\nJade lock tightly sealed, golden gate firmly pinned.\nIn the jade chamber’s depth,\nA hundred days of pure clarity,\nJade radiance shines all at once.\nThe jade spoon opens the path to the Immortals.\nA decree from the Jade Gate.\nWhen the Jade Boy arrives,\nOne is granted *Complete Perfection*—\nThe Jade Emperor’s proclamation is already set.\n\n---\n**Dan Yang’s Continuation (丹阳继韵):**\nJade nature, jade nature—\nJade door firmly sealed, golden gate tightly pinned.\nWithin the jade chamber,\nA black dragon appears—\nThe jade tiger devours it all.\nThe jade pass can unlock the swift path.\nThe Jade Boy transmits the decree.\nThe Jade Emperor’s Heaven—\nArrived, without favor,\nThe jade edict is now decreed.\n\n---\n\n**Gift to Dan Yang’s Wife and Husband (赠丹 Yang 夫妇):**\nOnly yam and chestnut for your two meals,\nThe Dao’s flavor should match this sweetness.\nSix times six—just call it twelve,\nThe first three threes with the last three threes.\n\n---\n**Dan Yang’s Reply (丹阳次韵):**\nToday’s yam and chestnut feast is joyful,\nIts taste like nectar, sweet and pure.\nWithin, thirty-six perfections are complete—\nWho in the world knows of the ten and three?\n\n---\n\n**Gift to Aunt Sun (赠孙姑):**\nThe second aunt still clings to her household affairs,\nYet who knows her wealth has crumbled to dust?\nIf she stays at home like the old days,\nMaster Ma will have no share in Immortality.\n\n---\n**Gift to Dan Yang’s Wife and Husband (赠丹阳夫妇):**\nEleven parts divided—Ma the Scholar,\nMust gently acknowledge the return to the head.\nThe three sufferings are arranged to release,\nTwo clods of earth will never guess.\nBeneath the shed, cold words offer no livelihood,\nOn the tower, dark responses hide no fortune.\nMay you awaken and understand—do not call me,\nFor this is the teaching that guides the virtuous out.\n\n---\n**Dan Yang’s Continuation (丹阳继韵):**\nThe Harmful Wind Immortal, endowed with high talent,\nCrafts verses that fish me back.\nOne nature is not allowed to be obscured by dust—\nThe Three Lights must be divined within.\nAfter true-hearted enlightenment, self and others are forgotten,\nWhen wisdom’s eye opens, wealth and color are abandoned.\nToday, I know the taste of the separated child—\nWith fate, I brush aside my sleeves and do not return.\n\n---\n**Gift to Dan Yang (赠丹阳):**\nA gourd on your back, brimming with wine to sell—\nFrom nothingness comes having, from having nothing.\nThe pure light, smooth and spicy, is fully recognized—\nMoon-wrapped jade forests will never wither.\n\n---\n**Dan Yang’s Reply (丹阳继韵):**\nNo need to sell nectar or jade elixir,\nSweetness on the tongue is never absent.\nI’ve received the Harmful Wind’s irrigation method—\nThe spirit-sprouts and wisdom-grass will never wither.\n\n---\n**Gift to Dan Yang’s Wife and Husband: Yam and Chestnut (赠丹阳夫妇芋栗):**\nChestnut comes to see the yam,\nThe two share a meal beyond the heavy eaves.\nThree threes yield three threes’ worth of flavor,\nSix sixes must know six sixes’ path.\nWielding the sword, one can strike the body’s shadow,\nWith needle and thread, one can seize the water’s clod.\nEven if you scheme a thousand ways,\nHow can you escape the barren hill’s dust?\n\n---\n**Dan Yang’s Reply (丹阳又韵):**\nFrom now on, my face is filthy, my hair wild,\nNo memory of joyous songs in the wine hall.\nAvoiding home’s karmic debts,\nChasing the outer world’s blessings.\nAlas, my body is like a candle before the wind,\nMy fate like a clod upon the water.\nEncountering *True Refining*, I awaken properly—\nLest my nature lie buried in the barren mound.\n\n---\n**Water Cloud Wanderer (水云游):**\nReflect, reflect—\nThis mortal frame of four illusions,\nWhat use is its play?\nOriginally, it is a walking corpse with moving bones,\nYet it still boasts of its postures.\nThe luminous, wise nature shines truly brilliant.\nThis skeletal cage must be exchanged.\nThe Harmful Wind Child—\nWithout relying on the human body,\nHe consorts with the Immortals.\n\n---\n**Dan Yang’s Continuation (丹阳继韵):**\nReflect, reflect—\nWives, concubines, sons, and grandsons,\nDo not come to mock with meals.\nThe white-walled kin of debt—\nStrike the rope at their feet,\nSever them in one stroke.\nThe luminous source is now fully illuminated—\nThis exchange is complete.\nMaster Ma’s Wind Child—\nLeaves his homeland behind,\nConsorts with the Harmful Wind Immortal.\n\n---\n**Divided Pear Poem (分梨诗):**\nThree clods of mud extinguish the master’s path,\nEach person takes one or two bites.\nIts flavor can dry the Northern Sea,\nIts fragrance permeates the Western Lake.\nJade waves roll and surge,\nGolden ripples spread densely.\nJust as the text’s meaning is revealed,\nAll depends on the *zhe* and *hū*.\n\n---\n**Dan Yang’s Reply (丹阳继韵):**\nOnce encountered in the muddy path,\nThe harmonized taste is taken.\nDragon’s roar shakes the valleys,\nTiger’s howl pierces lake and river.\nTo forge the Golden Elixir,\nOne must lay down the Jade Seal.\nThis transforms all things—\nHow much more so for humans?\n\n---\n**Burning the Heart-Incense #1 (爇心香#1)**\n\n「Burning the Heart-Incense #1»\n\n---\n**Sitting Slays the Wind of King, Standing Slays the Wind of Exhortation,**\nYet only because of *her*—\n**She clings to the Wind of Home.**\nBetter to cast off fiercely,\nAnd embrace the Pure Wind.\n\n**To walk with the Wind, to sit with the Wind,**\nTogether grasp the Wind.\n**I am the True Wind, you the Feigned Wind.**\nThe *Xiao Chun Tian*—\n**All relies on the Warm Wind.**\nWhen snow arrives,\n**How can one endure the Cold Wind?**\nWithin the window,\nOutside the door—\n**Two kinds of Wind.**\n\n**Dan Yang’s Reply**\nThis *Exhortation Wind*—\n**She was nurtured in the Wind of Scholarship.**\nWhen she met the Wind Immortal,\n**She gained the Pure Wind.**\nThough the Wind rages,\n**She mocks the Residual Wind.**\nThis Wind, this Wind, this Wind—\n**The Wind is utterly extinguished,**\nLike the Heart Wind.\n\n**To transcend the mundane, the Wind must be seized,**\n**To depart the realm, the Wind must be gathered.**\nToward the *Xuan Guan*—\n**To grasp the Cloud Wind.**\nThe Fragrant Wind ceases not,\n**Delighting in my Pine Wind.**\n\n**Await the Good Wind,**\n**The Soul Wind comes,**\n**Then swiftly ride the Wind.**\n\n**With Dan Yang**\nThe *Yu Li* left the sage to wander no more,\n**Why fret the heart in the mechanisms of fate?**\nEver pitying the household’s schemes as entangling bonds,\n**How can one free the body to dwell in ease?**\nOne round of *Chen Qiu* rolls endlessly,\n**Two balls of *Mao Shi* are most foolish and obstinate.**\nIf one understands the discourse of Pure Coolness,\n**Perhaps they will dwell with me in the good mountains.**\n\n**Dan Yang’s Reply**\n**To seek escape from schemes, not to return—**\n**To shatter the *Qi Cai* bonds of wine and desire.**\n**To extinguish flames and disperse smoke, forever encountering joy,**\n**To stand firm in the Dao, the heart at ease.**\n**Must one succeed only after oneself?**\n**How dare one rely on past softness and folly?**\n**At base, a man depends on his resolve and *qi*,**\n**To dwell forever in the Three Mountains.**\n\n**True Leisure #2**\nIf one seeks to cultivate,\n**Must first attend to the details.**\n**Lock tight the Golden Pass, the Jade Gate.**\n**Above and below, harmonize and refine,**\n**Their positions interchanged, like *Xiao Ji* irrigation.**\n**Once attained, the *Hou* and *Xing* are clear—**\n**No longer guessing at

refined.**\n**Distinctly revealed—**\n**Pure, clear, and tranquil in its subtlety.**\n\n**Dan Yang’s Reply**\nThe *Yin Yang* *Qi* flows ceaselessly,\n**Refined to the finest detail.**\n**Toward the *Qiong Hu*, seal the head and close the vessel.**\n**Before the *Zi Wu* palace,**\n**Jade and gold circulate in aid.**\n**This mystery—**\n**Clear and distinct, no need for guessing.**\n**Celestial seed,**\n**Marine root.**\n**The mist’s radiance spreads,**\n**Dazzling without end.**\n**Suddenly the True Form appears,**\n**Like smooth jade.**\n**The origin of transformation—**\n**Cultivation lies in attending to the details.**\n\n**With Dan Yang**\nThe Harmful Wind wanders through water, mist, and cloud,\n**Six leaves revolving, bound by iron plates.**\n**She strikes through the world, yet none perceive it,**\n**Only the heart knows—this one alone hears.**\n\n**Dan Yang’s Reply**\nWithin the *Bao Ping Gong*, observe the auspicious clouds,\n**Clouds come and go, separating the false from the true.**\n**The Heart Lute splits to form melodies,**\n**High tones resound naturally.**\n\n**With Dan Yang**\nA single whole pear divided into four,\n**Grandfather and grandmother share it—let none dispute.**\n**The pear is not divided for separation’s sake,**\n**The fruit’s growth depends on the *Jie Guo* text.**\n**When waters surge, teach the tortoise and hare to drink,**\n**When fire comes, do not burn the crimson heart.**\n**If one harmonizes water and fire in reversal,**\n**Cool detachment brings joy in its own hearing.**\n\n**Dan Yang’s Reply**\nDividing the pear, she awakens to the Four Partings,\n**Gradually sensing her heart’s ash, her nature no longer tumultuous.**\n**Wonder upon wonder—even the tiger and dragon cannot explain,**\n**Profound upon profound—how could gold and jade be of concern?**\n**The celestial seed thrives best when watered in fire,**\n**The enlightened grass endures when burned in water.**\n**Only when the Great Elixir is complete, unbroken,**\n**Will the True Consumption and True Breath arise naturally.**\n\n**Divine Light #3**\nThe Golden Pass knocks at the door,\nThe Jade Lock bars the gate—\n**No idle cultivation, no forced

it.**\n**Past the *Yao Chi*,**\n**Piercing the *Qing Xiao Ding*—**\n**Effortless *Wu Wei*.**\n\n**Dan Yang’s Reply**\nThe Wind Immortal locks the door,\nMaster Ma departs his nest—\n**Quiet and serene, she holds herself aloof.**\n**Having exhausted the roots and sources, why cling?**\n**To the wife, to the children.**\n**Recognizing the *Qi Cai* bonds of wine and desire,**\n**She relies on purity to nurture the *Ling Zhi*.**\n**Right now, in secret,**\n**She completes the practice—**\n**The cultivation’s fruits are not for others to know.**\n**Hidden and concealed, she stores her

poem was composed.\n\nThe *Harmful Wind* knows the water’s measure,\nThrough this, the *Mystic Dao* is revealed.\nWhite hemp coarse robes, green headscarf—\nSuch a fine appearance, truly invigorating *Qi*.\nNo need for a mirror to reflect,\nAll is clear in the mind’s eye.\n\nIn dreams, you discern the dream-body itself,\nAnd thus you are the carefree one who reaches the far shore.\n\n**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**\nThe *Harmful Wind* is dispelled—*Qi* dust grows less,\nThe *Mystic Dao’s* wonders are now understood.\nNaturally ashamed to wear the coarse hemp headscarf,\nThe *True Breath* flows gently—no need for frantic vitality.\nThe *Wisdom Lamp* shines continuously, illuminating the heavens,\nLife and *Nature* must now be fully realized.\nThe golden furnace is the body for refining the *Golden Elixir*,\nSerene and carefree, you become a free and easy man.\n\n**《Peony Pavilion》**\n*(Unfinished)*\n\n**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**\n*Peony Pavilion*—\nThe *Sweet Lotus* (peach) is two or three,\nThe *Dharma* (law) is like the *Taro Root*—six in total.\nOnly two are allotted to quietude.\n\nReflecting on them—\nSweet and fragrant, how so?\nThe five *Zang* organs are clear,\nAnd the six *Fu* viscera—none are lacking.\nThere is also the *Golden Elixir*—one more.\nTwelve in all—\nAsk the revered master,\nAnd he will explain.\n\n**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**\nThe *Taro Root* and *Sweet Lotus* are six in number,\nEncountered and bestowed—\nThe Pure Yang Sage is the *Three Officials*.\nThe *Taro Root* is the *Encounter*,\nThe *Three Officials* are the Pure Yang Sage

hanging it aside.\nIf you wish to see it,\nA hundred thousand *hu* of pearls would be its worth.\nWhen I recall and recount,\nJust a few words.\n\n**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**\nThe *Clockwork and Lute* (Zhu Lü) dispel the *Harmful Wind*’s Sage,\nSpecializing in *Dao* instruction.\nThus, the hermit’s gate is locked,\nAnd this is no falsehood.\nUsing clever means to lure me,\nSecretly eradicating *False Awareness*—\nI awaken from my family’s madness,\nAbandoning scholarly elegance.\nThe true essence—\nHard to describe, hard to depict.\nSix *qian* of cloth radiant with color,\nWorn like armor.\nHolding the *Golden Elixir*’s seed,\nGleaming light—priceless.\n\nIt is because of your transmission,\nNot ordinary words.\n\n**《Repaying the Teacher’s Grace》**\nWhy do I not tire of writing poems?\nThis reason only I know.\nA single stroke of script opens the *True Awakening*,\nThe *Three Fields* (of cultivation) are passed—\nThe *Pure Yang Sage* is the *End*.\nThe *Root of Life* is deeply planted—just in time.\nThe *Mystic Dao’s* secrets are tightly sealed,\nCalling me forth—then I depart to the *Jade Pool*.\n\n**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**\nToday, kneeling to receive my teacher’s verse,\nThe hidden *Dao* secrets—joyfully understood.\nPiercing through all *Dharma* (phenomena), forgetting false appearances,\nCleansing the six desires—arising in *True Virtue*.\nMarriage

      "translated_text": "**Title: *The Ten Transformations of Chongyang’s Divided Pear – A Collection***\n\n**Preface to *The Ten Transformations of Chongyang’s Divided Pear***\n\nThe Master of Dan yang was of the lineage of Fu feng, a kinsman of the great scholar Ma Dabian. His family wealth was vast, and his descendants were distinguished. From his youth, he studied Confucianism, yet never feigned merit for gain, and his nature was inclined toward quietude and contentment, delighting in emptiness and nothingness.\n\nHe once told his associates: *\"I met a strange man in a dream, and through his laughter, I attained enlightenment.\"*\n\nIn the autumn of the year Ding hai, during the reign of Emperor Da Zheng (大定), the Chongyang True Person (重陽真人) departed from Zhongnan Mountain (終南), traveled to the Sea Islands (海島), and sought to gather kindred spirits to journey together to Penglai (蓬萊), fulfilling the vow to pay homage to the Original Master (本師). Arriving in the east at Ninghai (寧海), he first visited the *Hall of the Immortal’s Encounter* (遇仙亭) of Fan Ming shu (范明叔). Master Dan yang followed and paid his respects to the True Person, and upon their first meeting, he was deeply moved.\n\n*\"In the past, I once glimpsed the Dao through a fleeting encounter—now I see that you, Master Dan yang, have long been destined for the Way.\"* Recognizing his innate affinity with the Dao, the True Person earnestly urged him to study the Way and cultivate True Nature (修真).\n\nMaster Dan yang, humbled by his guidance, respectfully invited the True Person to dwell in his county’s southern hermitage (南庵), which he named *Complete Perfection* (全真). Day and night, they expounded the Dao within. The True Person wished for Master Dan yang and his wife to swiftly abandon worldly attachments, forsake their native land, and become wandering *cloud-water* (雲水) practitioners. Initially, they were reluctant to comply.\n\nThe True Person then swore to refine the hermitage over a hundred days, beginning on the first auspicious day of the second month of winter (孟冬初吉), and bestowed upon him a whole pear (浑梨), commanding him to consume it. Every ten days, he would request another pear, which the True Person divided and sent to him and his wife, gradually increasing from two pieces to fifty-five. Every five days, he also received six each of yams and chestnuts (芋栗).\n\nAs the Chongyang True Person appeared in his dreams, warning him of the ten grave offenses leading to hellish retribution or celestial blessings, he composed verses—sometimes in praise, sometimes veiled with deeper meaning—to accompany each gift. Master Dan yang responded in kind, his poems revealing the profound interplay of *yin-yang* (陰陽) and the cosmic balance of odd and even numbers, as well as the mechanics of fate, virtue, and the cycles of life and death.\n\nThus, he abandoned worldly entanglements, altered his attire, burned his oath of secular life, and both he and his wife devoted themselves to the True Person as disciples.\n\nBy the year Ji chou (己丑), he accompanied the Chongyang True Person on his return journey to Liang (梁) and Bian (汴). After spending a year there, the True Person ascended to immortality. Master Dan yang then transmitted his teachings and, with his disciples, traveled westward to Zhongnan Mountain, seeking the True Person’s former retreat. He constructed a modest dwelling there and resided for ten years, expounding his doctrine. His disciples gathered in multitudes, beyond count.\n\nIn the year Ren yin (壬寅), Master Dan yang returned home with his staff (飛錫束來), once again visiting his native lands. One day, he spoke to his assembled disciples: *\"The Chongyang True Person, in his lifetime, already composed *The Complete Perfection Collection: Before and After* (全真前後集). Additionally, during his sojourn in our region, he wrote many works on profound metaphysical discourse and wondrous principles, totaling over three hundred pieces, which I have compiled into three sections: the first titled *The Late Awakening* (下手遲), the middle *The Ten Transformations of Divided Pear* (分梨十化), and the final *The Reluctance to Leave Home* (好離鄉). Though this collection has been printed in the west, few copies have reached our lands. My disciples have urged me to revise and annotate these works, organizing them into three volumes, and commissioning artisans to carve them onto wooden blocks for wider dissemination.\"*\n\nJingzhenzi Zhu Baoyi (靈眞子朱抱一), one of Master Dan yang’s disciples, brought this collection to me and requested a preface. I replied: *\"I am but a humble scholar, still laboring over my studies to advance my career. How could I dare to follow in the footsteps of the great masters, let alone claim detachment from fame and worldly concerns? Yet, even as a child, I knew of Master Dan yang’s reverence for the Dao, and I have witnessed firsthand the Chongyang True Person’s extraordinary efforts in refining the hermitage and guiding others. Though my understanding is shallow, I cannot refuse.\"*\n\nThus, I retained *The Ten Transformations of Divided Pear* (分梨十化) alone. I hope this may inspire practitioners of the Way across the land, spreading the profound benefits of Complete Perfection (全真) teachings far and wide.\n\nAs for the Chongyang True Person’s exhortations, divine signs, and other records, prefaces, songs, and poems—these are already well-documented. Here, I merely recount the origins of Master Dan yang and his wife’s entrance into the Dao.\n\nThis preface was written in the year Gui mao (癸卯) of the Da Zheng reign (大定), at the request of the scholar-official Ma Dabian (馬大辨), a native of Dong Mou xiang (東牟鄉), Ninghai Prefecture (寧海州).\n\n**Volume One of *The Ten Transformations of Chongyang’s Divided Pear*:**\nComposed by Chongyang True Person Wang Zhen (重陽子王矗) of Zhongnan Mountain (終南山).",

to Dan Yang’s Wife and Husband (赠丹阳夫妇):**\nEleven parts divided—Ma the Scholar,\nMust gently acknowledge the return to the head.\nThe three sufferings are arranged to release,\nTwo clods of earth will never guess.\nBeneath the shed, cold words offer no livelihood,\nOn the tower, dark responses hide no fortune.\nMay you awaken and understand—do not call me,\nFor this is the teaching that guides the virtuous out.\n\n---\n**Dan Yang’s Continuation (丹阳继韵):**\nThe Harmful Wind Immortal, endowed with high talent,\nCrafts verses that fish me back.\nOne nature is not allowed to be obscured by dust—\nThe Three Lights must be divined within.\nAfter true-hearted enlightenment, self and others are forgotten,\nWhen wisdom’s eye opens, wealth and color are abandoned.\nToday, I know the taste of the separated child—\nWith fate, I brush aside my sleeves and do not return.\n\n---\n**Gift to Dan Yang (赠丹阳):**\nA gourd on your back, brimming with wine to sell—\nFrom nothingness comes having, from having nothing.\nThe pure light, smooth and spicy, is fully recognized—\nMoon-wrapped jade forests will never wither.\n\n---\n**Dan Yang’s Reply (丹阳继韵):**\nNo need to sell nectar or jade elixir,\nSweetness on the tongue is never absent.\nI’ve received the Harmful Wind’s irrigation method—\nThe spirit-sprouts and wisdom-grass will never wither.\n\n---\n**Gift to Dan Yang’s Wife and Husband: Yam and Chestnut (赠丹阳夫妇芋栗):**\nChestnut comes to see the yam,\nThe two share a meal beyond the heavy eaves.\nThree threes yield three threes’ worth of flavor,\nSix sixes must know six sixes’ path.\nWielding the sword, one can strike the body’s shadow,\nWith needle and thread, one can seize the water’s clod.\nEven if you scheme a thousand ways,\nHow can you escape the barren hill’s dust?\n\n---\n**Dan Yang’s Reply (丹阳又韵):**\nFrom now on, my face is filthy, my hair wild,\nNo memory of joyous songs in the wine hall.\nAvoiding home’s karmic debts,\nChasing the outer world’s blessings.\nAlas, my body is like a candle before the wind,\nMy fate like a clod upon the water.\nEncountering *True Refining*, I awaken properly—\nLest my nature lie buried in the barren mound.\n\n---\n**Water Cloud Wanderer (水云游):**\nReflect, reflect—\nThis mortal frame of four illusions,\nWhat use is its play?\nOriginally, it is a walking corpse with moving bones,\nYet it still boasts of its postures.\nThe luminous, wise nature shines truly brilliant.\nThis skeletal cage must be exchanged.\nThe Harmful Wind Child—\nWithout relying on the human body,\nHe consorts with the Immortals.\n\n---\n**Dan Yang’s Continuation (丹阳继韵):**\nReflect, reflect—\nWives, concubines, sons, and grandsons,\nDo not come to mock with meals.\nThe white-walled kin of debt—\nStrike the rope at their feet,\nSever them in one stroke.\nThe luminous source is now fully illuminated—\nThis exchange is complete.\nMaster Ma’s Wind Child—\nLeaves his homeland behind,\nConsorts with the Harmful Wind Immortal.\n\n---\n**Divided Pear Poem (分梨诗):**\nThree clods of mud extinguish the master’s path,\nEach person takes one or two bites.\nIts flavor can dry the Northern Sea,\nIts fragrance permeates the Western Lake.\nJade waves roll and surge,\nGolden ripples spread densely.\nJust as the text’s meaning is revealed,\nAll depends on the *zhe* and *hū*.\n\n---\n**Dan Yang’s Reply (丹阳继韵):**\nOnce encountered in the muddy path,\nThe harmonized taste is taken.\nDragon’s roar shakes the valleys,\nTiger’s howl pierces lake and river.\nTo forge the Golden Elixir,\nOne must lay down the Jade Seal.\nThis transforms all things—\nHow much more so for humans?\n\n---\n**Burning the Heart-Incense #1 (爇心香#1)**",

thus drank water from it.\nHence, this poem was composed.\n\nThe *Harmful Wind* knows the water’s measure,\nThrough this, the *Mystic Dao* is revealed.\nWhite hemp coarse robes, green headscarf—\nSuch a fine appearance, truly invigorating *Qi*.\nNo need for a mirror to reflect,\nAll is clear in the mind’s eye.\n\nIn dreams, you discern the dream-body itself,\nAnd thus you are the carefree one who reaches the far shore.\n\n**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**\nThe *Harmful Wind* is dispelled—*Qi* dust grows less,\nThe *Mystic Dao’s* wonders are now understood.\nNaturally ashamed to wear the coarse hemp headscarf,\nThe *True Breath* flows gently—no need for frantic vitality.\nThe *Wisdom Lamp* shines continuously, illuminating the heavens,\nLife and *Nature* must now be fully realized.\nThe golden furnace is the body for refining the *Golden Elixir*,\nSerene and carefree, you become a free and easy man.\n\n**《Peony Pavilion》**\n*(Unfinished)*\n\n**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**\n*Peony Pavilion*—\nThe *Sweet Lotus* (peach) is two or three,\nThe *Dharma* (law) is like the *Taro Root*—six in total.\nOnly two are allotted to quietude.\n\nReflecting on them—\nSweet and fragrant, how so?\nThe five *Zang* organs are clear,\nAnd the six *Fu* viscera—none are lacking.\nThere is also the *Golden Elixir*—one more.\nTwelve in all—\nAsk the revered master,\nAnd he will explain.\n\n**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**\nThe *Taro Root* and *Sweet Lotus* are six in number,\nEncountered and bestowed—\nThe Pure Yang Sage is the *Three Officials*.\nThe *Taro Root* is the *Encounter*,\nThe *Three Officials* are the Pure Yang Sage himself.\nThe three disciples stand forgotten.\n\nThe *Sweet Lotus* is the *Standing*—\nMy three disciples all stand long,\nHence this line.\n\nSearching carefully,\nWithin them, recognize—\nAmong them, the *True Nature*.\nThe *Moon of Nature* is full and round,\nTrue joy—no sorrow at all.\n\nSomeone asked: Why does the *Harmful Wind*?\nI tell you—\nAbandon that,\nGain this.\n\n**《Gift to Dan Yang》**\nDo not fear the *Kingly Wind*’s chill,\nFor the *Kingly Wind* is not cold.\nA hundred mornings pass swiftly,\nThe path ahead—you and I will

painting.\nFrequently, you lift and display it,\nTemporarily hanging it aside.\nIf you wish to see it,\nA hundred thousand *hu* of pearls would be its worth.\nWhen I recall and recount,\nJust a few words.\n\n**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**\nThe *Clockwork and Lute* (Zhu Lü) dispel the *Harmful Wind*’s Sage,\nSpecializing in *Dao* instruction.\nThus, the hermit’s gate is locked,\nAnd this is no falsehood.\nUsing clever means to lure me,\nSecretly eradicating *False Awareness*—\nI awaken from my family’s madness,\nAbandoning scholarly elegance.\nThe true essence—\nHard to describe, hard to depict.\nSix *qian* of cloth radiant with color,\nWorn like armor.\nHolding the *Golden Elixir*’s seed,\nGleaming light—priceless.\n\nIt is because of your transmission,\nNot ordinary words.\n\n**《Repaying the Teacher’s Grace》**\nWhy do I not tire of writing poems?\nThis reason only I know.\nA single stroke of script opens the *True Awakening*,\nThe *Three Fields* (of cultivation) are passed—\nThe *Pure Yang Sage* is the *End*.\nThe *Root of Life* is deeply planted—just in time.\nThe *Mystic Dao’s* secrets are tightly sealed,\nCalling me forth—then I depart to the *Jade Pool*.\n\n**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**\nToday, kneeling to receive my teacher’s verse,\nThe hidden *Dao* secrets—joyfully understood.\nPiercing through all *Dharma* (phenomena), forgetting false appearances,\nCleansing the six desires—arising in *True Virtue*.\nMarriage and matchmaking need no further thought,\nExtinguish desire—abandon worldly concerns.\nRespectfully following my teacher’s path to the clouds and waters,\nIn the end, I will surely reach the *Heavenly Pool*.\n\n**《Gift to Dan Yang》**\nThe wine’s initial clarity,\nThe dream’s first shock.\nThe moon’s first brightness,\nThe *Nature*’s first balance.\nAs if awakening,\nThis is the path ahead.\n\n**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**\nAwakening from drunkenness,\nStartled from sleep.\nIlluminated in darkness,\nBalanced within.\nThe mind opens—\nThe path ahead is gained.\n\n**《Vow to Dan Yang’s Descendants》**\nI swear Dan Yang’s descendants will enter the *Dao*,\nThe *Seventh Ancestor* will escape the *Hell of Six Realms*.\nDescendants gain the *Dao*,\nThe *Ninth Ancestor* is born in *Heaven*.\nIf they retreat from the *Dao*,\nThey burden their ancestors.\n\n**《Awakening to the Southwood Illusion》**\nThe *Taro Root* and *Sweet Lotus* are now fully understood,\nThe wise and foolish alike share in this meal.\nOne can gather *Yang Qi* into a perfect sphere.\nOne sinks into *Yin*—\nThe *Yin-Soul* is further destroyed.\nThose who come return to purity,\nThe lost wander in worldly entanglements.\nEntering the *Perfect Dao*, you leap into the *Sage’s Platform*,\nPrecisely residing—\nForever fortunate, forever together.\n\n**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**\nStanding in encounter—*Nature* is fully understood,\nThe fragrant *Dharma*’s taste is savored.\nA red flame forms in the water,\nSnow-wrapped jade flowers—\nVibrant and unfading.\nThe *Nature Lamp* shines at the golden gate,\nThe *Divine Elixir* glows on the jade plate.\nTogether cultivating the *Six Perfections* and *Three Platforms*,\nEmerging from my teacher—\nThe inner landscape naturally reveals itself.\n\n**《Absolute Verse》**\nThe two revered masters know only of the world’s dwellings,\nNot that *Penglai* holds a jade jar.\nIf they would turn back and cultivate *Awakening*,\nTheir names would forever be called by the *Immortal Maidens*.\n\n**《Jade Hall Spring》**\n*Jade Nature* and *Golden True*—\nAll can transform.\n*Jade Nectar* and *Golden Elixir*,\nFrequently welcomed and received.\n*Jade Hare* and *Golden Crow*,\nTheir lights shine in succession.\nIlluminating the jade railing—\nJade sprouts grow.\n*Jade Buds* and *Golden Stems*,\nEverlasting, never withering.\n*Jade Maidens* and *Golden Boys*,\nOften observed and cherished.\n*Jade Locks* and *Golden Keys*,\nEvery gate opens and reveals.\n\n**《Appreciating the Jade Hall Spring on Jade Flowers》**\n**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**\n*Jade Awakening* and *Golden Mystic*—\nHeart to heart, all are taught.\n*Jade Tigers* and *Golden Dragons*,\nFrequently welcomed and received.\n*Jade Ripples* and *Golden Waves*,\nClear and successive.\nIn the jade stream—\nJade sprouts grow.\n*Jade Leaves* and *Golden Branches*,\nFlourishing and immortal.\n*Jade Fair Ones* and *Golden Infants*,\nLeisurely observed and cherished.\n*Jade Gates* and *Golden Passages*,\nBrightly open above and below.\n\n**《Pure Yang Sage’s Division of the Sweet Lotus (Peach) into Ten Transformations—Complete》**",
