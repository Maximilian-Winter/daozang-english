From non-being into being, from past into present, from youth and vigor into old age and death, and from old age and death into infancy—this is the transformation of change.

divine way to instruct, beginning with the mutual dependence of heaven and humanity, the shared governance of humans and spirits. In essence, its purpose is nothing more than to uphold the great principles of teaching and guiding the world.\n\nIn the spring of the third year of the Yanyou era, the Central Secretariat, following the deliberations of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, traced my appearances and disappearances from the Zhou through the Jin dynasties, and my deeds from antiquity to the present. They recorded me as a deity of loyalty to the state, filial piety to the family, benefit to the people, and uprightness in the sacrificial canon. Reviewing my former title—*Divine Civil and Martial Filial Virtue Loyal and Benevolent King*—they elevated and honored me as *Imperial Lord of Assisting the Origin, Initiating Transformation, Literary Prosperity, and Vast Benevolence, Controller of Official Rank*. They also bestowed upon my temple of numinous response the plaque *Shrine of Assisting Literature and Completing Transformation*. As my illustrious titles grow ever more resplendent, my shame deepens. Ever mindful of how to benefit public virtue and assist the governance of the Great Yuan, my deeds are shallow and unworthy of mention. Thus, I humbly compile this record of my true transformations, offering it as the slightest repayment of the imperial grace.\n\nTo teach others through the Dao and its works is called *instruction*; to embody it in high station so that its influence stirs below is called *transformation*. The wellspring of transformation lies in its sovereign. By examining the merit or demerit of affairs, one discerns the source of transformation. Once simplicity and purity have declined and the people’s hearts are no longer as of old, even when penal governance reaches its limit, the spirits still transform them.\n\nFor the people of the world, those who violate the net of laws and poison the statutes of the court must receive hidden punishment. From ancient times to the present, this has been as clear as the sun and moon, an unchanging principle. Thus, the governance of officials over the people and the ordering of the world by the gods are one and the same. The essential task lies in clarifying instruction and transformation, guiding the people to turn toward goodness and distance themselves from transgression.\n\nYet how can this be achieved when the paths of the hidden and the manifest differ, and their powers are not the same? Since their voices and traces cannot connect, even with transformative decrees and canonical statutes, how can they be presented to the people? This is why the governance of the unseen realm is especially arduous.\n\nI have long understood this principle, and so I devised a means for gods and humans to commune. Together with the hundred spirits who bear office, I presented this before the Emperor of Heaven, establishing the *Flying Phoenix Method of Expounding Transformation*. Through the descent of the brush into the human realm, I forged a principle linking the hidden and the manifest. By the Emperor’s gracious will, moved by love for the people below, my petition was granted. Thus, in years past, I have already proclaimed the traces of my transformations. Though these deeds may seem self-aggrandizing, they are the true acts of this being. Moreover, the transmission of transformative traces serves to display instruction and clarify the law, subtly guiding people to turn toward goodness and distance themselves from transgression. In refining the people’s hearts, improving customs, and stemming the tide of decline, what else could suffice?\n\nRecently, by the august command of the Supreme Emperor, I was granted twenty-one subordinate bureaus, their duties clearly defined, to govern the world below. One purpose is to assist the Celestial Court in its work of generation and completion; another is to secretly aid the sagely dynasty in its flourishing governance. Overwhelmed by this favor, I dare not slacken or falter, and for years have striven without respite.\n\nMoreover, my *Book of Transformations*, in ninety-seven fascicles, has long circulated among the people. Yet its origins lie in the hands of corrupt scholars, where errors abound—fish mistaken for *lu*, roots for silver, and countless instances of flawed jade mixed with true. Without correction and clarification, people might dismiss it as the fabrications of meddlers who vainly exalt the spirits. Amid such doubts, certain steadfast and upright scholars, after repeatedly collating the northern and southern editions, verified them before the gods. I declared: “The southern edition contains many omissions and distortions, while the northern edition, personally reviewed by me, presents the facts in full detail. I have made corrections to errors dating before the *dingwei* transformation, and revised the chaotic additions made after the *guiji* transformation. I have further appended the transformations of *Su Min*, *Ke Ju*, and others, bringing the total to ninety-nine. For now, I leave the text unfilled, reserving space for future intent, so that those who undertake the final collation may print and circulate it, guiding later generations and dispelling all doubt.”\n\nSome say: “The sages established the spiritual Dao as instruction, and the Nine Classics shine like the sun and moon. Learned and refined gentlemen have never been lacking through the ages, yet even with canonical teachings on transformation, they cannot make every household understand. How then can this modest *Book of Transformations* stand as a pillar in the current?”\n\nAlas! Such critics simply fail to reflect. Where transformation abides, the Dao abides. Let those in office behold the severity of my transformative traces—will they not tremble with awe at the thought of loyalty, integrity, and administrative competence? Let scholars and literati observe the beginning and end of these transformations, knowing the majesty of their oversight—will they not revere and reform? Let farmers, artisans, merchants, and all other walks of life hear of the astonishing events spanning a thousand years: those who deceive in their hearts face heavenly punishment, those whose words bear evil suffer divine retribution, while goodness is rewarded and wickedness is punished—will they not shudder, turn toward goodness, and amend their faults? Let followers of Buddhism and Daoism recognize the clarity of karmic consequences—will they not preserve their hearts and tread the proper path? This is no mere rousing of the dull or emboldening of the timid.\n\nThe vulgar say: “The Master did not speak of the uncanny, force, disorder, or spirits—why then so many spirits?” Such words are not for those who grasp the mean of the age. They cling to the trust of the White Duke. My guiding of people toward the path of self-cultivation, ordering the family, governing the state, and bringing peace to the world is no heterodox art.\n\nThough this transformation may not establish the heart of heaven and earth, secure the mandate of the people, or inaugurate great peace for posterity, those with discernment will not fail to recognize the weight of my intent.\n\nAs for my divine presence in the world, it moves like the sun and moon across the sky. I bestow or withdraw hereditary offices, oversee the literary balance of the world, and encompass all matters, great and small.\n\nAlas! If the returning wind and retreating fire could be enacted in the past, why can the thunderous, swift, and soaring not be realized now? Hear this, people of the world: embody my utmost intent. Establish benevolence and righteousness in the garden of the *Odes* and *Documents*; cultivate loyalty and filial piety in the land of integrity and deference. Together, ascend to benevolence and longevity, and share in the joy of great peace. Otherwise, the execution of heavenly punishment will leave no room for regret.\n\nI, unworthy as I am, bear this heavy charge and fear betraying the imperial favor. Thus, I set this forth in preface.\n\nFormerly, by the Jade Emperor’s decree, I was granted the *Ruyi* Flying Phoenix and its ink traces to traverse between heaven and earth, to save the final kalpa. The task was entrusted to the Lord of Zitong. Now, with over ninety lifetimes of transformation, I command Wu Jian to undertake the rigorous collation of this text, which is now complete. I request permission to inscribe my own postscript.\n\nOver ninety lifetimes, the mechanism of transformation unfolds,\nUpholding life, rescuing suffering, averting disasters and perils.\nAttaining the fruit of the Tathāgata’s *garbha*,\nThe divine script will reemerge to bless another age.\n\nI, Xiao You, and Wu Jian—two lives bound by filial piety and friendship—have now completed this work. Once more, this treasure shall emerge, the *Ruyi* in hand, traversing ten thousand miles. As the ancient saying goes:\n*A thousand measures of gold and horses bear names,*\n*A single cloud rises beneath one’s feet to ascend.*\n*The high terrace of the Three Heavens descends into the earth,*\n*A single branch conveys the message of spring’s spirit.*\n\nHerein lies the treasury of transformations spanning a thousand leagues—\nwhether human life thrives or fades, all unfolds within this realm.\nDo the two lives know the workings of this mechanism?\nWhen conditions converge, success is assured in due time;\nif one can magnify the Dao, what room remains for doubt?\nHad the hundred-foot tower not been completed,\nhow could the deeds of many lives be bequeathed?\nLet critics mock or boast as they will—\nonly in the end may one’s cloud-like deeds be seen.\nFrom this day forth, the world of mortals shall once more\ntransmit the *Hundred Odes of Qinghe*.\n\n*The Transformational Scripture of Lord Zitong*\n**Scripture Title:** *The Transformational Scripture of Lord Zitong*\n**Author:** Unknown, likely composed during the Yuan dynasty.\n**Content:** Chronicles the life and miraculous manifestations of Lord Zitong.\n**Volume:** Four fascicles.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Pulu* Category.\n\n---\n**Fascicle One**\n\n**1. Yuanming (Primordial Mandate)**\nWhen chaos first divided the turbid and the pure,\nthe southeast quadrant shone with radiant clarity.\nWithin it, the Supreme One’s *qi* billowed in mist,\nand I secretly aligned with the essence of creation.\nAlone I presided over the *Chen* Palace, above the Twin Maidens,\nwhile also governing the Fire Virtue and the Five Phases’ nature.\nSpontaneously wearying of desolate realms,\nI shed my form, awaiting the fruition of the Dao.\n\nI was originally a man of Wu and Kuaiji, born at the Zhou dynasty’s dawn—\nto date, seventy-three transformations have unfolded.\n\n**2. Liuxing (Flowing Form)**\nI concealed my traces at Lingyan, losing count of autumns;\nmy gaze shifted between hardness and softness at will.\nSwallowing mist, my belly knew no hunger or thirst;\nnurturing the hidden true, I came and went as I pleased.\nWhen the measure was full, my form turned to gestation and birth;\nwhen the time came, I served kings and lords as fate allowed.\nAt the scenic land of Kuaiji, my transformation flourished—\nZhang’s lineage gave me form, my world the Zhou.\n\nAs I wandered the mortal realm, I suddenly arrived at the northern slopes of Kuaiji,\nwhere I saw a recluse, aged around fifty, preparing incense and lamps, praying to heaven.\nIt was the middle of spring, the third watch of the night;\nthe celestial patterns blazed brilliantly, the *Zhang* and *Yi* constellations gleaming above.\nBending down to listen, I learned the recluse’s surname was Zhang—\nfitting the stellar alignment, I was thus born.\n\n**3. Shengmin (Birth of the People)**\nOne night in the northern chamber, she dreamed of swallowing a pearl—\nher heart trembled with awe at the first stirrings.\nIn that month, at the break of dawn, I was born;\nmy numinous radiance filled the house with splendor.\nI disdained childish games, set apart in solemn thought,\ndevouring learning while untroubled by a hundred cares.\nElders who met me often praised me,\nforetelling that one day I would become a great scholar.\n\nThe Zhang clan descends from the Yellow Emperor’s son, named Hui, who first crafted bows and arrows, wove hunting nets, and whose descendants inherited the office—hence the surname Zhang, renowned in Wu.\n\n**4. Yisú (Transforming Customs)**\nWu retained the legacy of Taibo’s ways,\nits people’s nature shifting like isle barbarians.\nShorn hair followed the customs of Anze,\ntattooed bodies warded off dragons and serpents.\nYet their temperaments spurned the age’s fashions,\nyearning for caps and shoes to practice rites.\nAt first, kin and friends scorned such affectation,\nbut in time, the village wholeheartedly followed.\nIn my homeland, hair was cut short and bodies tattooed—\nadaptations for diving, ingrained as barbarian custom.\nHaving reached boyhood, I found no joy in this,\nso I sought out caps and sandals, teaching myself ritual forms.\nAll, within and without, deemed me strange.\nYet as years passed, seven or eight in ten were transformed by my example.\n\n**5. Qígǔ (Examining Antiquity)**\nThe Three Wu lie secluded at heaven’s edge,\ntheir culture uncelebrated, lacking refinement.\nImperial canons never reached distant heirs,\nroyal texts scarce found in farmsteads.\nFortune brought an envoy bearing silk scrolls—\nsuddenly, humble minds grasped hempen rites.\nFrom this, the land’s chanting of classics flourished,\nand modest local customs became praiseworthy.\nMy village lay far from the capital’s circuit,\nits culture unrenowned.\nOne day, an elder visited my father,\nreciting several odes of Yao and Shun:\n“An envoy from the Central Kingdom brought these.\nI admired them, studied under him,\nand memorized every word without omission.”\nThereafter, villagers who wished to learn followed me,\nall acknowledging me as their teacher.\n\n**6. Fèngzhēn (Serving the Real)**\nSilent thatched huts, doors barred by day,\nfew travelers reach this riverside hamlet.\n\nA deep-plowed field yielded a golden statue,\nlong seated, still entwined with purple kudzu roots.\nUnwilling to melt it down and mar its form,\nI chose to burn offerings morning and evening for its blessing.\n\nReturned to the coastal peaks to dispel calamity,\nthe entire village’s living souls relied on its sheltering grace.\nIn my humble farming life,\nI suddenly unearthed a golden statue beneath my hoe—\nits crown layered like towering mountains,\nits robes flowing like radiant, billowing silk,\nits indigo brows and moon-like face\nsolemn yet benevolent,\nresting against an armrest on a lofty seat,\na lotus blossom as its pedestal.\nIt stood nearly a foot tall, weighing over thirty catties.\n\nAt first, I did not know which deity it represented.\nI asked the village elders, and some said:\n“This is an image of the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning.”\nIn ancient times, when Yu the Great tamed the floods,\nhe smelted metal into divine figures to guard the sacred peaks—\nperhaps this statue is of that kind.\n\nMy family had long been poor,\nstruggling even for clothing and food,\nyet I dared not entertain the thought of melting it down.\nOne day, a sea wind churned the waves,\nsending panic through near and far—\nno human effort could withstand it.\nI said to the villagers:\n“My home holds this golden statue, found by chance.\nToday, I offer it for the sake of all to pray to the sea.\nIf we find peace, then together we shall carry it to the heights\nand cast it into the raging waves.”\nSuddenly, the wind stilled, the tide receded,\nand the entire village was spared.\n\nThe townspeople, grateful for this virtue,\nbrought modeled grain and cloth in thanks.\nI refused, but they insisted,\nand from then on, my family’s fortunes quietly improved.\nLater, I recalled the spot where the statue was cast,\nand traced its path.\nWhere the sands glowed, I dug and retrieved the old image,\nthen carried it home.\nI built a shrine to enshrine it,\nand the people of the land revered and served it.\n\n**7. Nìngqīn (Honoring Kinship)**\nMy mother’s toil spanned long years,\nenduring wind, cold, heat, and dampness.\n\nThe physicians and shamans all proved ineffective,\ntheir needles and moxibustion frequent yet unbearable.\nI carved flesh from my thigh to stew as repayment for an old vow,\nsucked the ulcer to draw out blood—all in earnest devotion.\nClearly, in the night I heard the words of a celestial spirit,\ngranting twelve more years of life as a mark of utmost sincerity.\n\nBy the time I came of age, my mother had reached sixty.\nIn her youth, she toiled at the loom,\nher meals untimely, often falling ill with rashes.\nNow, in her declining years,\nthe six qi’s excesses compounded her suffering,\nand a great affliction took hold—a carbuncle erupted on her back.\nFirst, we sought shamans for prayers,\nthen turned to physicians, whose stone needles and medicines\nproved futile after more than a month.\nI never left her bedside,\ntending to her day and night without removing my clothes to rest.\nWhen all else failed, I sucked the carbuncle,\ndrawing out thick pus and blood.\nHer condition briefly improved,\nbut the physician said the ulcer’s root clung to the bone—\nit would not easily be expelled.\nThree days later, I sucked it again.\nSuddenly, my mouth filled,\nand I spat out a membrane like stretched silk,\nwith pus and grains like rice.\nMy mother gradually stabilized,\nbut from lack of nourishment during her illness,\nshe grew frail and consumptive.\nThe physician said this was a chronic ailment:\n“To supplement a person, use a person;\nto truly restore the true, only the true will suffice.”\nThat night, I carved flesh from my own thigh,\ncooked it, and offered it to her.\nSuddenly, I heard a voice from the void:\n“The heavens, moved by your filial piety,\ngrant your mother twelve more years of life.”\nThe next day, she recovered without medicine,\njust as the spirit had foretold.\n\n**8. Yōuhūn (Hidden Marriage)**\n\n**8. Hidden Marriage (Yōuhūn)**\n\nMarriage has never been a trifling matter—\nthis life’s encounter was fated long before.\nHer spirit waited, her bones unyielding,\nand in a clear dream, she returned—was it chance?\nA son now stands ready to inherit,\nyet her fragrant soul soon sank into the deep springs.\nIn the prime of life, all ties of yin and yang severed,\nthe world declared my bones those of an immortal.\n\nIn my youth, I was lowly,\nnaturally quiet and disinclined to company.\nThough past twenty, I had no household,\nnot merely because no matchmaker came,\nbut because I lacked the heart for it.\nWhen my mother fell ill,\nher regret was not seeing a grandchild,\nand I too bore the weight of unfiliality.\n\nOne evening, I dreamed of walking through woods to a lonely hill,\nwhere a towering tomb stood.\nBeside it was a gate, and within sat a woman in fine array.\nShe turned to me and said, *\"Are you not Zhang Shànxūn?\"*\nStartled that she knew my name,\nI asked how she came to know me.\nShe replied, *\"My home was within crowing distance of yours—\nI am your second elder brother’s wife.\nOnce, my uncle met with your family\nand praised your learning and virtue,\ncalling you a gentleman of old.\nThey discussed betrothing me to you,\nbut my father hesitated, deeming your appearance unremarkable.\nYet my heart had already inclined toward you.\nLater, I was betrothed to Zhōng Ānrú,\na wealthy man’s son, but one without reputation.\nI was ashamed and fell ill, then died.\nThree years have passed, and I came here because of you.\nWhy do you not arrange this for me?\"*\n\nI awoke with a start.\nA month later, I dreamed the same dream.\nOne day, I strolled with my friend Yí Jiāchéng to explore a secluded spot,\nand suddenly found myself in the very place from my dream.\nI told my friend, and we marveled together.\nThen someone from the tomb called out to me as *\"young master\"*—\nit was the woman from my dream.\nYí was in fact the uncle of my brother’s wife.\nHe rushed to inform her parents,\nwho brought the woman home, and we were wed.\n\n**9. Yuānshí (Abyssal Stone)**\n\nSpring light lingers, the scene unhurried,\nspring waters flow, shallow yet rippling.\nSilken robes on the bank sway mirrored shadows,\nwhile among the divine throng, past knowledge stirs.\nFine white script forms the character *\"yuān\"* (abyss),\na green stone, round as a small tortoise.\nA son’s name fulfills the omen—\nheaven’s favor is never withheld.\n\nThree months after marrying my second wife,\nthe women of the village—those married but not yet with child—\ngathered at the sacred pool to touch the stones.\nWhoever drew a stone would bear a son;\nwhoever drew a tile, a daughter.\nThis was an old custom.\n\nMy wife joined the crowd.\nMy mother said to her, *\"The pool is deep and dark—\nbetter to search where the water is shallow upstream.\"*\nAs she hesitated,\nsuddenly the pool bubbled as if blown upon.\nShe reached in and drew out a stone,\nlarge as a chicken’s egg,\nwith six ridges like a tortoise’s back,\ngreen veined with white,\nits markings faintly resembling the character *\"yuān.\"*\nMoved, she conceived.\n\nWhen the child was born, we named him Yuānshí.\nAs he grew, my wife suddenly said to me,\n*\"Our son is just like you—take good care of him.\nMy bond with you in this life is at its end.\"*\nWith that, she passed.\nI never remarried.\n\n**10. Tamed Pheasants (Xùnzhì)**\n\nHeaven splits, earth cracks—how can grief compare?\nNo escape from the scourge that claimed both parents.\nCarrying earth to mound the grave, repaying their care,\nlying on straw, resting on clods, sorrow redoubles.\nThe Yellow Springs’ path is barred—what use lament?\nEven the white pheasants, grieving, grew tame.\nThree years of ritual, boundless sorrow,\nyet moderation in mourning befits the upright.\n\nAt thirty-six,\na virulent plague swept through,\nsparing no one.\nThe countryside was desolate, roads empty.\nMy father, eighty-five,\nand my mother, seventy-three,\nfell ill in the height of summer\nand died on the same day.\n\nI took up spade and basket to prepare their burial,\nthen built a hut by the roadside,\nlying on straw, resting on clods,\nto observe three years of mourning.\nA pair of white pheasants often perched in the trees.\nAt each offering, they would descend, calling,\nbending and bowing as if trying to speak.\nWhen the mourning period ended, they departed.\n\n**11. Reversed Flow (Huíliú)**\n\nMounding the grave, I spared no labor,\nyet who could foresee the earth churning into waves?\nPines and catalpas seemed to vanish,\nthe coffin and outer casket feared no escape.\nThe *Great Cavern Scripture* dispelled calamity,\nthe golden sacred image subdued the leviathan.\nAutumn rains ceased, the torrent stilled—\njoyfully, I saw the fields stretch broad and high.\n\nMy parents’ grave lay just over a hundred paces south of my home.\nIn haste, I had consulted the diviner, who deemed it auspicious,\nconvenient for visits—\nI had no time for other concerns.\n\nFive years after the burial,\nthirty li west of the grave,\na flood surged forth,\nturning flat land into a river,\nwith the tomb as its bank.\nThe water flowed ceaselessly, swift and fierce.\nI grew fearful and wished to relocate the grave,\nbut it was too late.\n\nI fasted, kept vigil at the tomb,\nreciting the *Great Cavern Scripture* day and night without pause,\nand reverently displayed a golden statue from my family’s collection.\nThus, I secured peace.\n\nThe following autumn, heavy rains fell,\nand the river beside the tomb swelled,\nmerging several streams into one.\nI grew more anxious.\nWhen the waters receded, I saw that the valley before the grave\nhad transformed into a solid ridge,\nover a li wide.\nFrom then on, the pines and catalpas suffered no harm.\n\n**12. Vanquishing Pestilence (Jiàngwēn)**\n\nBoth parents perished in the plague,\ngrief and resentment gnawing to the bone.\nThough the debt of life is great, love unending,\nthe paths of the living and dead are sundered—\nhow to vent this fury?\n\nDivine soldiers seized the demons, manifest in daylight,\nwhile the true talismans of the *Registers* came in dreams.\nWith a brush, I inscribed charms to heal the people’s suffering—\nhow could I allow the Five Ghosts to linger?\n\nMy parents both died of pestilence.\nThe summer heat bore a cruel poison,\nand the agony was unbearable.\nWhenever I thought of the plague demons’ savagery,\nmy hatred burned deep,\nyet the paths of the living and dead diverged,\nand I was powerless to avenge them.\nMy heart was ever heavy.\n\nAfter the grave’s waters reversed course,\nI knew it was the power of the *Great Cavern Scripture* and the golden image.\nThus, I redoubled my recitations and reverence,\nand in time, I gained unseen aid to subdue the plague demons.\n\nThree years later, I suddenly dreamed of the golden image I served, which spoke to me: *\"You have memorized the* Great Cavern Scripture *well, but you have not yet seen the* Great Cavern Registers*. Now I shall bestow them upon you to subdue evil demons—not only to fulfill your original vow, but also to aid Heaven’s transformative work and assist the state in saving the people.\"* From its sleeve, it produced two books. I bowed a hundred times and received them. Upon waking, the books lay before my pillow.\n\nOne was called *The Great Cavern Thread*, the other *The Great Cavern Rites*. As I opened the registers and read, I came upon the line: *\"One myriad of Heaven’s armored soldiers shall be dispatched.\"* Suddenly, wind and thunder darkened the day, and countless figures in golden armor and crimson sashes arrayed themselves before me, bowing to receive their orders. Three held red banners at the forefront, saying to me: *\"We await your commands.\"* I was still in a daze, but I sternly declared: *\"I command you to subdue the plague demons. In this village, a certain household is stricken—go and drive them out!\"*\n\nAt once, one banner-bearer led over a hundred soldiers into the house. In an instant, they dragged out five demonic enforcers: one clad in tiger skin, one crowned with a rooster’s head, one with a human face, one with a crane’s head, and one with a donkey’s head. Their implements were those of water, fire, feathers, hail, axes, and chisels. Enraged, I rebuked them, about to annihilate their forms, when they pleaded: *\"We disciples are born of the year’s cyclical qi, shaped by its seasonal force. We roam in fixed directions and afflict those predestined—those whom dark retribution dooms suffer calamity, and those whose heavenly mandate is severed meet death. We dare not act on our own will. If the True Official grants us clemency, we shall henceforth obey your restraints. Wherever your talismans and registers are present, we will not dare to approach.\"* I then followed the rites to instruct and admonish them before they departed. Thereafter, whenever I heard of plague in the village, I gave the afflicted my talismans and methods, and all were saved.\n\n**XIII. Cherishing Life**\nCold, heat, summer damp—all stem from Heaven’s shifts,\nwhile diet, rest, and labor bring illness to men.\nThe *Yellow Emperor’s Pulse Classic* details mother and child,\nthe *Divine Farmer’s Materia Medica* distinguishes lord and minister.\nMassage, moxibustion, and needles vary by severity,\ntonification and drainage adapt to old and new.\nAs long as the people avoid untimely death,\nmy toil is ungrudging—this heart is true.\n\nI have saved countless lives with the registers’ methods. People from near and far flocked to my door, their numbers beyond count. Those stricken by plague, possessed by malevolent spirits, suffering from malaria or dysentery, haunted by misfortune, struck by ghosts, ensnared by deities, or afflicted by noxious qi—I restored them all to health. Yet their conditions varied: cold or heat in the organs, excess or deficiency, differences in diet, rest, labor, or indolence. Some were harmed by joy, anger, sorrow, or grief within, others by wind, cold, heat, or damp without. These were the teachings of Qibo and Shennong, not the province of Daoist registers.\n\nWhen I could not save a life, I was truly ashamed of my inadequacy. Thus, I studied pulse principles, pondered the nature of medicines, examined the conquests of the Five Phases, and reviewed the techniques of the nine needles. For six years, I toiled tirelessly, mastering their subtleties. From then on, none whose mandate was not yet severed met an untimely end.\n\n**XIV. Heavenly Office**\nA household’s goodness is its own reward,\nyet fame spreads unbidden, resounding far.\nMy name reached the kingdom, my heart unashamed,\nmy place among Heaven’s officials—destined, ordained.\nThe Six Qi harmonized, the realm at peace,\nthe people’s suffering eased, their safety assured.\nIf I fulfilled my duty, what merit was mine?\nIt was the sage rule of lord and minister that wrought this grace.\n\nMy deeds in saving lives reached the sovereign’s ears. While I was still occupied with acupuncture, word spread to the capital, and I was summoned by imperial courier. Having been recommended by the ruler and tested through trials, I was appointed as a physician, charged with the people’s ailments, serving under the Heavenly Office. I accepted this willingly.\n\nI instructed my disciples to diligently practice their craft. This was the reign of King Cheng, when the royal domain flourished, the Six Qi were balanced, and the people rarely suffered from epidemics or infirmities—all due to the sovereign’s virtue, which allowed me to fulfill my duties.\n\n**XV. Recommending the Worthy**\nA man’s goodness is like my own—\nhaving attained, I still think of those who have not.\nGreat wisdom, though hidden, can create wonders,\nwhile wondrous prescriptions cure illness like magic.\nTo recommend the worthy is earnest and unselfish,\nto yield one’s place is a humble, sincere intent.\nMy memorial reached the throne, winning imperial favor,\nand I was swiftly elevated to the ranks of remonstrance, standing beside the ministers.\n\nAmong my disciples was a wound physician named Gongsun Zhishu, whose nature was kind and wise, and whose learning was vast and precise. He possessed deep knowledge of the properties and flavors of all medicines. He created a formula of five toxic ingredients—cinnabar, realgar, alum, magnetite, and chalcanthite—explaining that cinnabar nourishes the blood and benefits the heart, realgar promotes flesh and fortifies the spleen, alum regulates fat and aids the lungs, magnetite unblocks bone marrow and strengthens the kidneys, and chalcanthite treats the sinews and nourishes the liver. Externally, this remedy cured the five types of sores, while internally, it corresponded to the five viscera. Bound with yellow wax and refined through precise firing, the medicine, once prepared, proved divinely effective when applied to sores. He recorded his method for posterity. I acknowledged my own inferiority to him, yet he remained beneath me in rank. Thus, I recommended Zhishu to take my place, allowing him to assume my duties as well.\n\nBefore long, the sovereign fell ill, and a carbuncle formed upon his temple. One night, it suddenly ruptured, placing him in grave danger. The aforementioned medicine was applied, and he recovered at once. Thereupon, Zhishu was appointed Imperial Physician. For my forthrightness and lack of concealment, and for recommending the right person, I was deemed worthy of imperial reward and promoted to Remonstrator.\n\n**XVI. Admonition Without Flattery**\nThe imperial physician’s life-saving work is no light matter—\nonly through dizziness and submission is loyal governance achieved.\nWhen form and trace are forgotten, doubts dissolve of themselves;\nif the pivot’s mechanism is not secure, disaster arises.\nSubtle words must not expose the ruler’s faults,\nnor should erasing drafts obscure the upright’s name.\nAs long as the sagely court commits no errors,\nthe honor of office is no betrayal of true feeling.\n\nThe king proclaimed: *\"Ah, you of meritorious virtue, forthright and without concealment! I recall that a good physician saves lives, but a great physician saves the state. Now I truly open the path of remonstrance to honor your worth. You must apply the same heart that cures illness to correcting my faults.\"*\n\nAlas!\n*\"Good medicine is bitter to the mouth but benefits the ailment;\nloyal words grate upon the ear but benefit conduct.\"*\nGo forth and reverently uphold your duty—do not abandon your principles!\n\nI declined thrice before accepting. Having joined the ranks of the seven ministers, I drew near to the radiance of the throne. Though the sovereign and his ministers were sagely and without grave faults, my love for the ruler and concern for the state never wavered—not in a single step, nor in a single meal or rest.\n\nWhen King Cheng was young, he governed under the regency of the Duke of Zhou. After assuming personal rule for some time, he once uttered words of discontent. Fearing that those around him might exploit the opportunity, I frequently admonished him with cautionary tales of the subtle shifts between fortune and misfortune in the relationship between ruler and minister. My drafts were repeatedly burned, and no one saw them. Thus, during the Duke of Zhou’s eastern campaign, though the Four States spread rumors and the Duke of Shao was displeased, the situation was ultimately resolved without harm—wherein I played a small part.\n\n**XVII. Returning in Honor**\nTen years of official service, leaving mulberry and catalpa behind—\none day, returning in honor to my native village.\nMy eldest son, Mao, startled by my cap and robes;\nthe paths of my fields and gardens, now overgrown, seem like hills and ruins.\nThe dream of wandering immortals proves but empty toil;\nworldly attachments fade, and I freely expand and contract.\nOnce more, I know the bliss of spring slumber by the north window—\nlet the cock crow at the fifth watch; I rise when I please.\n\nI had served in the capital for ten years, long parted from my homeland, and weary wings longed to return. I often thought of my aging parents, still in good health, though I remained in obscurity. After their passing, I received honors and emoluments—yet what joy was there in feasting on fine rice and wearing brocade? One day, I read the Duke of Zhou’s *\"Owl\"* and was moved to sorrow. Thereupon, I resolved to return home, repeatedly submitting petitions to retire and return my bones to the earth. At last, my wish was granted. The dukes, ministers, and gentlemen held a farewell banquet for me outside the eastern gate.\n\nUpon my return, the villagers welcomed me. I left my carriage at the outskirts and walked the rest of the way, and my neighbors took pride in my honor.\n\n**XVIII. Honoring the Clan**\nClan members all spring from one root—\nhow can wealth and poverty truly be weighed?\nIf official stipends come by chance, why hoard them?\nWhen kinfolk reach such straits, what becomes of human feeling?\nIn life and death, I assist with weddings and funerals;\nfor the talented and promising, I provide guidance and support.\nOther families, hearing of this, gladly emulate it—\nthe Three Hao gradually establish charitable estates in their names.\n\nThe Zhang clan had several branches, many of them impoverished. After my return, I sought them out. The young had grown to adulthood, the young adults had aged, and the vicissitudes of life and death, honor and hardship, were startling to behold. The destitute, unable to rise on their own, remained as before. Thereupon, I established a charitable estate, entrusting it to Yuan Shi. The poor received aid, the sick received medicine, grown men and women were married, and promising youths were educated. Other families, inspired by this example, followed suit. The charitable estates expanded, and the customs of the land grew more virtuous.\n\n**XIX. Returning to Stillness**\nI have heard of the Great Sage of the West—\nwho takes suffering, emptiness, and stillness as truth.\nWalking and singing, he trusts the metaphor of floating clouds;\nsitting in contemplation, he labors over the illusion of a dream-body.\nHaving grasped the secret, he crosses to the other shore with ease;\nforgetting words, he finds solace in nurturing his spirit.\nFrom this, I begin to understand the principle of returning to the root—\nnorth or south, east or west, I bend and stretch as I please.\n\nDuring my time at court, I heard the words of those beyond the world: In the western lands, there is a Great Sage, the Ancient Sovereign, who transforms without speaking, governs without action, takes compassion as his foundation, expedience as his function, fasting as his constant practice, and stillness as his joy. He regards life and death as morning and evening, treats kindness and enmity as dreams and waking, and is free from sorrow, anger, or resentment—for he knows that floating life is brief and seeks the unborn.\n\nI once admired him. After resigning my honors and returning home, I encountered a recluse on the road, walking and singing:\n*\"The morning sun’s glow,\nstriking stone, gives birth to clouds.\nAt first, faint and indistinct,\nthen rich and profuse.\nRising with the wind, they drift boundlessly,\nshifting and changing before vanishing—\ngone without a trace, their whereabouts unknown.\nAlas! The official’s pursuit of profit and emolument,\nforgetting his toil, he races onward.\nSuddenly, the twilight presses near,\nfacing the great limit, he hesitates.\nHe will set foot in the dark realm,\nbecoming one among the teeming multitudes.\"*\n\nAt first, I halted my carriage to listen. Soon, I leaned on the crossbar in respect. Finally, I dismounted, wept, and bowed, saying: *\"Just now, I heard your sublime words, which deeply resonate with my heart. I beg you to bestow upon me your enlightening counsel, that I may sustain my remaining breath.\"* Thereupon, in the midst of the thoroughfare, I bowed a hundred times and earnestly entreated him.\n\nThe *Xinggezi* looked up to the heavens and sighed, then pointed to me with the Mind-Seal and bestowed upon me the Orthodox Formula, saying: *\"This is the Returning-to-Quiescence Method of the Great Sage Ancient Sovereign of the Western Realm. If you can recite and practice it, you may transcend life and death, die yet not perish, and realize the Fruit of Immeasurable Life, ultimately reaching the Other Shore. Thus may you attain Perfect Enlightenment. Should you falter midway, you may still choose your dwelling place and become an immortal.\"*\n\nI received his teaching, and with this, my worldly ties were severed, and a hundred cares turned to ash. It was during the autumn assembly of the *hao* year, when I gathered my kin and friends to leave behind verses before passing away. The verse read:\n\n*\"The autumn wind sighs,\nthe autumn moon gleams pale.\nI have grasped the truth—\nknowing this body is but a guest.\"*\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Junshan**\nJunshan’s realm is most serene and secluded,\nwhere crane-drawn chariots linger awhile.\nThe lake’s hues shift with day and night,\nthe forest’s density follows spring and autumn.\nNo body clings to thousand-year elixirs,\nno Daoist covets a hundred-mile marquisate.\nGaze upon the misty waves for sustenance,\nfeast your ears on the oars’ song, watch the unhurried ripples.\n\nAfter my transformation, as I journeyed toward the Western Realm, I chanced upon Junshan of Dongting Lake. Enamored of its sublime scenery, I tarried briefly. At that time, above, no ruler’s authority loomed; below, no ties of blood or kinship bound me. Transcendent beyond the world, I came and went alone. The waters’ radiance and mountains’ hues were lovely in all seasons; chanting to the wind and howling at the moon—what boundless joy! Reflecting on past affairs, they seemed but a dream.\n\nSoon, I roamed as an immortal, with celestial companions visiting day and night. No longer did I hear the toils of the mortal realm—only the true ease of grotto-heavens. After some time, two azure lads descended from the heavens, respectfully conveying the Emperor’s decree, appointing me as the sovereign of Junshan and overseer of Dongting’s waters.\n\n*This concludes the first scroll of the* Transformations of Emperor Zitong.\n*Here begins the second scroll of the* Transformations of Emperor Zitong.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: Stirred by Life**\n\nThe spirit knew the years on Junshan stretched long,\nIn grotto-heavens deep, far from the world’s clamor.\nA sigh, a sob—no outlet for the grief,\nYet sensed the grieving soul could not be called back home.\nThe fate to seize a womb remained unfulfilled,\nDragging through mud and water, resentment hard to dispel.\nThe jade flask refused to keep spring’s stay,\nLeaking yang’s warmth where willow twigs appeared.\n\nI had dwelt on Junshan for so long when, one day, spring waters first rose. At the lake’s mouth, a great ship moored to the shore, where men slit a sheep’s throat and poured wine, wailing in sacrifice with such heartrending sorrow that I was moved. Drawing nearer to listen, I saw a woman of thirty-odd years, her body suffused with golden light. Thrice she drank and prayed:\n\n*\"My husband, wronged and exiled to the southern wilds, perished of miasma. His homeland lies ten thousand leagues away, his coffin returned but lately. Time spares none—soon the final mourning rites must end. Yet I grieve: no one remains to serve our home, while his parents, aged and frail, await in vain. A child stirs in my womb, its form still unseen. If the spirits of these mountains and waters deem my husband’s crime one of loyalty, if they pity my in-laws’ twilight years without support—now that my own end nears, grant me your hidden protection. Let me bear a son to continue the Zhang line. Though my life may not be spared, I shall have no regrets.\"*\n\nFrom the cloud-paths, her sorrow overwhelmed me. Tears streamed forth, and suddenly I fell into her embrace, senseless. After a long while, I heard voices: *\"The child! The child!\"* Opening my eyes, I found myself in a bathing tub—I had been born.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Honoring My Forebears**\n\nKing Li heeded slander, the people’s hearts turned away,\nMy father’s loyal words tread the path of disaster.\nThe exile to Liuzhi foretold the throne’s fall,\nYet heedless of scales turned awry, he failed to guard against subtle wrongs.\nThe orphan’s grace from the sage’s favor never waned,\nThe radiant soul of the wise shone still more bright.\nAscending the remonstrance hall to inherit his office,\nMen said his son could carry on his mantle.\n\nMy late father’s name was Wuji. After his burial north of the Yellow River, my mother, née Huang, raised me with kindness, wisdom, and unyielding discipline. In every moment—whether nursing, resting, waking, or singing—she spoke of poetry and history, gathering neighboring children to play with me. With mud and silk scraps, she crafted figures, reenacting tales of old: now a courtly assembly of lord and vassal, now a father’s admonition to his son, now a master’s exhortation to his disciple, now friends in conversation. She explained each scene, teaching me the ways of the world.\n\nAt ten, I was sent to study outside the home. She named me *Zhongsi*—\"Loyal Heir\"—to honor my father’s legacy. When I came of age and donned the cap, my grandfather, Pingzi, styled me *Zhong*. My mother performed the *Three Cappings* with solemnity. At the western chamber, she returned my bows, then wept as she said:\n\n*\"Your father once served King Li as a* bao *officer, charged with admonishing the king’s faults. But the king was suspicious by nature, ashamed to hear his errors. Those who dared remonstrate were put to death. In time, he even punished those who* monitored slander*, and many perished. The roads fell silent; people spoke only with their eyes. The people could bear it no longer, and resentment spread. Your father memorialized the king, urging him to reform, to repeal the laws against slander, and to heed the voices below. The king refused. Thus was he exiled to Panyu, where he met his end. The realm mourned his unjust fate.*\n\n*Now the king rules with benevolence. By edict, the descendants of those wronged in past reigns are to be reinstated. Go forth!\"*\n\nI journeyed to the capital and stood upon the *Feishi* stone to proclaim my innocence. A decree restored my father’s rank posthumously, bestowing upon him the posthumous title *Xian*—\"Offering,\" for loyalty must be reported to the throne. I was appointed *bao* officer, inheriting my father’s duty. This was in the reign of King Xuan.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: Filial Piety and Brotherly Love**\n\nMy elder brother, alas, left no heir,\nYet we shared the same root, born of one branch.\nMother’s grief stirred a response deep within,\nSo Maoyang was chosen to continue the line.\nThe northern hall’s sorrow eased for our kind mother,\nWhile the dark earth knew the dead had not been forgotten.\nMourning rites were fulfilled for my grandparents,\nAnd my name resounded for filial piety and brotherly love in that age.\n\nMy brother Yunsi died young; I never met him. When I came of age, I had two sons: the elder, Ranming, and the younger, Maoyang. Maoyang was precocious, beloved by his great-grandfather. On the eve of the *Changzhi* festival, as the family offered sacrifices at the ancestral shrine, my mother wept bitterly, lamenting my brother’s untimely death. I asked to adopt Maoyang as his heir to comfort her heart.\n\nMy paternal grandmother, née Zhao, passed at eighty. My grandfather, stricken with grief, refused food and could not rise for the mourning rites. As his grandson, I donned the *zicui* mourning garb and observed the three-year mourning period with utmost sorrow, fulfilling every rite. Word of my filial piety and brotherly love spread near and far; people spoke of me by my style, not my name.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Waters of the Mian**\n\nAh, Minister Yin Jifu—his spirit soared,\nHis merit, renown, and talent crowned the sacred court.\nWeaving civil and martial arts, his heart was steadfast,\nYet the campaigns west and north stretched far.\nIn the capital of Hao, rumors took flight, slander arose,\nBy the Mian’s waters, his poems carried veiled admonitions.\nThe lord and minister rejoiced in their bond, their achievements grand,\nThanks to my loyal counsel, the demon of slander was stilled.\n\nKing Xuan had a worthy minister, Yin Jifu, endowed with both civil and martial gifts, admired by all officials. The realm had endured turmoil, with the Four Barbarians encroaching on all sides. When the king ascended the throne, he launched northern and western campaigns to restore the borders of Kings Wen and Wu. Jifu was entrusted with sole command of the army. While I remained with the king, Jifu’s grand strategies often overlooked minor details, displeasing many in the king’s inner circle. Slander soon flourished, and the king’s suspicions grew. While Jifu was in the capital, rumors reached the throne. I defended him tirelessly, but the king’s doubts lingered. I then composed the *\"Ode to the Mian Waters.\"* When the king heard it, and Jifu returned in triumph, their bond deepened. The achievements of the restoration surpassed those of Shaokang and King Gaozong.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: The White Colt**\n\nThe sage’s diligence had a worthy beginning,\nBut one day, his virtuous countenance dimmed, and good counsel waned.\nWorthy talents fled, lamenting their graying years,\nWhile poems took shape, singing of the white colt.\n\nThe king’s early diligence gave way to complacency. His demeanor, once radiant with virtue, grew dismissive of wise advice. The worthy withdrew, sighing over their fading years. I composed verses, likening them to a white colt.\n\nThe Eastern silks now reached the vassal states,\nAnd heroes swiftly gathered in the Eastern Capital.\nThe royal house summoned recluses to revive the kingly transformation,\nFor truly, loyal words urged the employment of scholars.\n\nThe king, having accomplished his great enterprise, broadly bestowed exceptional grace, elevating me to the rank of Grand Master. At that time, the realm knew no peril, and the jade heart grew somewhat lax. One day, the Master of Ceremonies, Wei Zhong, impeached Zhang Fang before the throne. Heaven’s majesty struck awe, and Wei was duly tried. Thereupon, men of Dao and virtue, elders of seasoned wisdom, turned and departed. My heart grieved, and I composed the *\"Ode to the White Colt\"* as a subtle rebuke, urging the king to cherish worthy talent, to be tolerant in receiving remonstrance, so that those in office would harbor no thought of leaving, those already gone might hope to return, and recluses would aspire to serve. The poem reached the king, who was moved. He issued edicts to those abroad, blaming himself and repenting his errors. Wei’s position was restored, and gifts of silk and bows with banners were sent daily without fail. Before long, public opinion turned to praise, the spirit of the scholar-officials flourished, and the realm once more witnessed the governance of the Cheng and Kang eras.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: Avenging Wrongs**\n\nOur late lord drinks his resentment in the Yellow Springs,\nBy rites, the foe’s house cannot share the sky.\nThe dead cannot undo Feng Cheng’s slander,\nBut later men—Wen Shu—proved worthy.\n\nOne knows only the day of recommending talent,\nNot the years when the innocent were slandered.\nThe throne, too, clearly knew the truth of this matter—\nWhy should rumors, within and without, be suppressed?\n\nOur father’s death arose from the slander of Nan Feng Cheng, a matter well known in the court. The eternal sorrow remains unforgotten. Feng Cheng has long been dead, but he had a son named Wen Shu, talented and virtuous. Once, as a student of the National University, he studied under Master Wei. When I inquired of Wei, he told me: “Feng Cheng’s son is insatiable in learning, his speech a model, his bearing exemplary—unmatched among the noble youths of today.” The ways of Heaven are hard to fathom: who would have thought that Feng Cheng, with his fly-like conduct, would have such a son? This is like the blind Gu and the wicked Gun giving birth to Shun and Yu. He will surely become a great vessel. Though I bore a feud that could not share the sky with him, upon hearing of his good conduct, my heart was gladdened. After my elevation to Grand Master, when the position of Guardian was vacant, the decree permitted me to recommend someone to take my place. I put forward Wen Shu, and the king heeded my words, and he ultimately excelled in his duties.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Aiding the Orphaned**\n\nLife and death’s paths are not easily foreseen—\nZhong Jiang in his prime, suddenly stricken with peril.\n\nAlas, his life has passed beyond recall—\nfive daughters left orphaned, deepening the sorrow.\nBetrothal rites proceed as though their father lived,\nwith lambs presented and geese offered at the wedding hour.\nOn the day we pledged unchanging friendship through life and death,\neven his spirit in the netherworld must smile.\n\nThe Master of Ceremonies, Wei Zhongjiang, and I were bound by marriage ties, and we had known each other for a long time. One day, as his official carriage prepared to depart through Tiger Gate, Zhongjiang wished to make a report. He stepped forward, then hesitated, suddenly collapsing to the ground. The guards lifted him, but he was already at his last breath. He was taken home and told his elder sister.\n\nThe Wei family had no sons, only five daughters. The eldest, widowed, had returned to her natal home; the second, of marriageable age, remained unbetrothed; the youngest was but fifteen. Wei had served the king with devotion, yet died suddenly within the palace. With no funeral rites granted, where could his five daughters turn? I arranged the proper ceremonies and married off three of them. The two younger ones were entrusted to the household of Remonstrator Gao Zhiliang, to be raised until they came of age and wed as the wives of Ranming and Maoyang.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Cherished Teachings**\n\nIn the bloom of youth, she kept her resolve—\neven in old age, her senses remained keen.\n\nRooted deep, she never wavered toward heterodox ways,\nHer heart fixed on the constant recitation of the *Neiguan Sutra*.\nFlowers fall and bloom, yet their roots endure forever;\nMoon waxes and wanes, its essence ever ethereal.\n\nAt life’s end, she earnestly imparted her cherished teachings,\nAscending the immortal ranks to reach the distant void.\nHer mother, widowed in her early years, lived to a hundred,\nHer sight and hearing unclouded—this from daily reciting the *Neiguan Sutra*,\nPondering its meaning until, in her later years, she attained insight.\n\nOne day, as I returned from court, I hurried past the courtyard.\nShe called me to sit beside her; my two grandsons stood in attendance.\nWith a heavy sigh, she said: “Our karmic bond has brought us together as mother and child.\nYou now bear the frost of age, and my own years are plain to see.\nI reflect that life in this world is uncertain—birth and death without fixed form,\nA fleeting sojourn like the moon’s waxing and waning,\nLike flowers that bloom and fade.\nThis life’s birth is but the last life’s death—had there been no death before,\nHow could there be birth now?\nIf the death of this body is not understood,\nHow can the next life’s birth be assured?\nIf you grasp that the body is but illusion,\nYou must guard the true and eternal.\nIf the nature is steadfast and life unwavering,\nThen what is called ‘unbroken through endless kalpas’ is achieved.\nThose with merit and practice ascend to higher realms;\nThose without evil karma do not lose their human form.\nEndure within the dreamlike illusion,\nLest you bind yourself to the fruits of enmity.\nI am about to depart forever—do not grieve deeply.\nThese parting words demand your full attention.”\n\nShe spoke, then composed herself against the armrest and passed away.\nLater, reborn as a maiden, she attained the Dao and ascended to heaven,\nBecoming the Radiant Wisdom Perfected.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Utmost Loyalty**\n\nGrief suppressed, rites altered to serve the king’s affairs,\nMoved by the sovereign’s grace, he remembered his old minister.\n\n“My earnest remonstrances went unheeded,\nMy loyal devotion, laid bare in vain.\nThe heir apparent lacked the primal virtue,\nAnd I, white-haired, blushed to be a flatterer.\nTo serve to the end with the Dragon Spring sword brings no regret—\nYet still I grieve that the Zhou’s Way sinks into obscurity.\n\nI bore the mourning of one in coarse sackcloth,\nBut the imperial decree stripped me of grief to serve the throne.\nThrice I declined, yet in the end complied—\nSuch was the alteration of rites for state affairs.\n\nThe king had reigned long, weary of governance.\nAll the old ministers—Yin Jifu, Duke Mu of Shao, Nan Zhong, Fang Shu—\nSome were laid low by illness, some had passed away.\nI alone remained as the aged servant.\n\nAt first, the king named Gong Nie as heir apparent.\nI forcefully remonstrated, but could not sway his favor.\nIn the end, he was enthroned.\nWhen the king abandoned the altars of soil and grain,\nThe successor took power—\nDissolute, drunken, and tyrannical.\nAgain I admonished him.\nThe king, resenting my reliance on the former court’s favor\nAnd still bitter over my earlier memorial,\nShowed his anger plainly.\n\nI begged to retire and return home.\nOne day, an envoy brought imperial wine.\nI received it with reverence and drank.\nAfterward, another decree came.\nThough I had served the state with utmost loyalty,\nI would not let a single death disturb my true nature.\nYet still I grieved that the Zhou’s Way would not flourish,\nFearing the legacy of Kings Wen and Wu would be lost.”\n\n**Chapter Thirty: Dwelling in the True**\n\nOnce more I emerged, and affairs multiplied—\nHow many times laughter, how many times sorrow?\nLoyalty and concern for the state—alas, too late!\nPlain speech met with wrath—what could I do?\nGazing afar at the pines, my hair turned white with regret,\nAshamed to have coveted rank and emolument.\nThis snowy mountain realm is no world of dust—\nHere, dwelling in the true, have I found my place?\n\nBorn into this age, I held fast to the ancient Way.\nMy words went unheeded, and I incurred blame.\nMy spirit had no refuge, yet my heart would not rest.\nFor three days, I wept outside the palace gates.\nThe king, hearing of it, deemed me a demon.\nHe commanded the Ting clan to lead their retinue,\nBows and arrows aimed toward the sound of my voice—\nBut I had no form; what could their arrows strike?\n\nThus, filled with shame at my former home,\nI bid farewell to the kingdom and journeyed far.\nMy heart set toward the west,\nI crossed Min and E mountains, leaving my homeland behind.\nAt the western edge of Shu, there was a mountain called Feiyue.\nMy ancestors had been born in Haokui, neighboring Yue.\nLooking down, I saw the name was the same, but the customs differed.\n\nFurther west, I beheld a mountain,\nVast and towering, over a hundred *li* in breadth.\nEven in the height of summer, snow clung to its peaks, cold and unmelting—\nNo realm of dust, this.\nThe mountain spirit, Bai Hui, said:\n“This is called Snow Mountain.\nLong ago, the Treasure Abundant Tathāgata cultivated here,\nAttaining the Way after eight years.\nThe Perfected Ones of the Western Extremity have long dwelled here,\nThus achieving fruition.\nYour Excellency, with your immortal bearing,\nWhy not remain here?”\n\nI listened and stayed.\nBefore long, an edict came, naming me the Great King of Snow Mountain.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: The Mountain King**\n\nA thousand *li* north of the capital,\nTen thousand peaks of Min and E stretch west.\nHonor and disgrace cast beyond the snares of the world,\nRight and wrong untouched by the waters and clouds.\nWith force I slew the White Tiger, retrieving the fallen star-stone;\nThe Green Dragon, locked in its scabbard, gleams like the moon’s halo.\nFacing south, I rule as king over a hundred *li*—\nYet the imperial decree weighs heavily upon me.\n\nAs I lingered on Snow Mountain under the Great Immortal’s command,\nAn edict arrived: the gates of Shu flourished with transformation.\nThus, I turned my crane-drawn chariot back toward the northeast.\nThere, I beheld a thousand peaks, verdant and solitary—\nA realm of surpassing beauty.\nAfter some time, the mountain spirits Gong Yuanchang and four others came to pay homage, saying:\n“We serve this land.\nOf late, we have seen Your Excellency’s divine majesty, stern and radiant,\nYour light shining daily, your voice like the drinking of sound, echoing through the valleys.\nAre you a celestial being?\nSince King Wu’s campaign against Zhou,\nThe chieftains of the Wei, Lu, Peng, and Pu tribes,\nAiding the lords of Shu, marched north with the great army—\nPassing through here.\nNow, three hundred years have passed.\nThe roads are remote, the people few.\nNo one of high rank has come—\nYet Your Excellency’s power and splendor are thus.\nWe beg to know your origin.”\n\nI told them the truth.\nThe mountain spirits said:\n“We, too, have grown weary of the human world and wander here.\nThis mountain falls under the governance of the Emperor of Shu and is called Sword Ridge.\nTo the north, it reaches Zhongnan;\nTo the west, it joins Min and E;\nTo the south, it connects with Qiong and Lai;\nTo the east, it embraces Ba and Shu.\nIts expanse spans over a thousand *li*—\nA strategic land indeed.\n\nSince the Mountain King Bai Fenggui was conceived as the heir of the King of Shu,\nNearly a hundred years have passed.\nNo king has yet ruled here.\nYour Excellency, descended from sages,\nWith clarity and virtue embodied,\nAccumulated merit and cultivated conduct,\nLoyalty and filial piety perfected—\nYour presence here is by the decree of fate.\nWhy not rest awhile?\n\nMoreover, beneath Sword Ridge,\nThere is a great beast with a white forehead, over a thousand years old.\nIt lurks in the mountain’s corner, feeding on humans.\nYour Excellency, once a great minister of the Son of Heaven,\nHas governed the spirits of mountains and rivers.\nNow, with the imperial decree here,\nYou may summon all spirits,\nCommand transformations with a breath,\nDispatch the hidden and the dark,\nAnd drive away this tiger—\nThus aiding Heaven’s love for life.”\n\nI trusted their words.\nSummoning the imperial decree, I gathered the mountain and river spirits within a thousand *li*,\nAll coming to receive my command.\nI declared:\n“The Emperor’s jade decree states that the White Tiger harms lives.\nAs the king of this mountain, I oversee you spirits.\nSlay this beast.\nThose who obey shall enjoy eternal offerings;\nThose who defy shall face Heaven’s punishment.”\n\nAll replied: “We humbly obey.”\n\nThen, gazing around, I transformed my appearance,\nMy body growing as vast as the mountain.\nPlucking a lone bamboo, I roared it into a long sword.\nPingyi, the Master of Wind and Rain, cleared the path.\nWielding the blade, I let out a cry—\nThe sound shook the valleys.\nThe tiger, enraged, gathered clouds from its breath,\nIts eyes flashing lightning.\nIt leapt and turned, charging at me.\nWith all forces united, we struck—\nIt fell beneath the blade.\n\nFrom the bloodstained ground, I retrieved a round stone,\nShaped like a fallen star.\nGong Yuanchang recognized it:\n“This is the tiger’s power.”\nI wore it at my waist.\nAll spirits bowed in awe.\n\nUpon the completion of my task, I memorialized the Emperor, first recounting the transgressions of Jiao Shao, then presenting the merits of all who had contributed. The Emperor thereupon appointed me as the Mountain King of Shu’s Northern Gate.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: Rewards and Punishments**\nThough governance differs in the unseen and mortal realms,\nThe principle of impartiality remains the same in the heart’s intent.\nSun Di’s grievance, long buried, now cries for redress;\nWu Yijian’s filial piety, though steadfast, awaits its due reward.\nHarsh punishment spares not even the scales of a fish’s back;\nA loyal memorial seeks to reach the Emperor’s enlightened ear.\nGreat and small spirits alike stand in reverence—\nHeaven and earth grow clear, the imperial wind sweeping all.\n\nHaving assumed my true office as King of the Mountains, I oversaw all ranges and rivers within my domain, their floods and droughts, abundance and scarcity, omens and merits—all were brought to my attention, and I governed them with equity.\n\nThe mountain spirit of Qingli, Gao Yusheng, coveted the maiden Sun Di, a woman of his jurisdiction, on the night of her wedding. He seized her soul and violated her, but the Dragon Spirit of White Pond in the neighboring territory detected his crime. I observed the matter, summoned both the woman and the spirit, and upon confirming his guilt, restored her soul, whereupon she revived. Gao Yusheng was flogged three hundred strokes upon his back and stripped of his rank.\n\nAt the foot of the mountain lived the late filial son Wu Yijian, who, during his father’s illness, had pricked his own flesh to draw blood and copy the *Lengqie Sutra* in four scrolls. Though five years had passed since his death, he had received no recompense. I memorialized the Emperor on his behalf, proposing him as Gao Yusheng’s replacement. The Emperor replied, “Approved.”\n\nFrom that time forth, spirits great and small knew to hold me in awe and reverence.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: Preserving Praise**\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: Preserving Praise (Continued)**\n\nThe Lord of Bao seduced King You with his daughter,\nThe king’s favor for Bao Si unraveled the moral order.\nHe deposed his son and banished his wife—heaven’s disdain,\nSlaughtered the loyal and oppressed the good—ghosts brought calamity.\nThe Spirit of Mount Tai, though swift in wrath, acted in haste,\nYet the suffering of Bao’s people was a grievous wrong.\nMy memorial reached the celestial court, and the decree came down:\nThe people, blessed with benevolence, lived long in peace.\n\nKing You first took the daughter of the Marquis of Shen as his queen,\nVirtuous and with a son, Yijiu, the rightful heir—eldest and upright,\nHis filial piety evident from his youth.\nThen the Lord of Bao presented Si,\nAnd the king, enamored, distanced himself from the queen.\nSoon after Si bore a son, he deposed the queen of Shen\nAnd enthroned Si in her place.\nWhen Si’s son was born, the king named him Bofu,\nMeaning “eldest” to deny the firstborn’s claim,\nAnd “submission” to assert his rule over all.\nThus he exiled Yijiu and named Bofu crown prince.\nNine ministers who remonstrated were all executed.\nThe stench of his deeds reached the Supreme Emperor,\nWho commanded the Western Marchmount to wreak havoc as a warning.\nMountains and rivers, ghosts and spirits grew restless,\nThe Three Rivers quaked, peaks crumbled, waters surged,\nAll flowing backward in defiance.\n\nThe Spirit of Mount Tai, an emanation of the White Emperor Bai Tuoju,\nVented his fury, dispatching edicts to the Han and Mian valleys.\nThe Spirit of Mount Bao-Xie sought to bury the land of Bao,\nWhich bordered Shu. I found this excessive\nAnd memorialized the throne:\n“Though the Lord of Bao is unworthy of pity,\nWhat crime have his people committed? I beg clemency for them.”\nAn edict came: “The Spirit of Metal Heaven has overstepped his authority;\nLet him be lightly reprimanded.”\nThus the people of Bao were spared burial.\nLater, when the Quanrong invaded Zhou,\nThe lands of the Han, Mian, and Bao were ceded to Shu—\nAll by the Emperor’s design.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: Whirlwind**\nEvil men’s wickedness invites their own doom,\nWhile filial sons honor their parents—intentions worlds apart.\nTo turn hospitality into enmity is cruelty indeed;\nThe whirlwind reverses, and the fire’s fury turns back upon its kindler.\nThough brimming with chivalry, he could not contain his wrath,\nAnd the howling gale, lashing his face, struck him down.\nLet this serve as a warning to all:\nKnow that the upright and wise reveal divine power.\n\nSouth of Sword Ridge lived Li Yuan, a filial son devoted to his mother.\nOne evening, a traveler sought shelter with him.\nLi was cooking a parrot to serve as a meal,\nAnd the guest, mistaking it for hospitality, beamed with delight.\nSoon, however, the food arrived—only coarse millet.\nThe guest refused to eat.\nLi said, “My aged mother, recovering from illness, craves meat.\nI was tending to the rooster at dawn and had no time to prepare for you.”\nThe guest flushed with shame, rose abruptly, and declared,\n“Do you take me for one who has never tasted meat?”\nHe stormed out without a bow.\n\nDeep in the night, a wind arose, and he set fire to Li’s home.\nIt was the dead of winter, grass and trees withered,\nThe flames roared, the smoke billowed—none could approach.\nLi carried his mother to safety and cried out to heaven.\nI happened to be passing above and, indignant,\nBlew a gust that turned the raging fire back upon its kindler.\nThe guest still clutched his torch, his brows and temples singed.\nHe tried to flee but stumbled, lost his way,\nAnd fell into the flames, barely escaping with his life.\nWhen questioned, he confessed:\n“I am the swordsman Pu Guangdu.\nLast summer, during the city’s festivities at Brocade River,\nA friend, drunk, offended a respectable family and was nearly beaten to death.\nI intervened to mediate and ended up throwing him into the water,\nBarely saving him. When the matter was reported to the authorities,\nI fled and have been wandering for half a year.\nYesterday, I was famished and resentful toward you.\nAs I lit the grass, it seemed someone shouted at me.\nThe fire reached your home, but the wind turned it against me.\nNow I shall die, but not as a nameless ghost.”\nWith that, he spoke no more.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: Righting Wrongs**\nKnow that a human life is weightier than mountains—\nNever treat doubtful punishments as trivial.\nMao’s wrongful death remained unavenged,\nWhile Liangneng’s unjust execution cried out for redress.\nA soul leapt into a body to expose the truth,\nThe culprit was seized, and the great villain confessed.\nA single word from Yimin brought boundless benefit,\nSpared from shame, he now enjoys offerings of blood and flesh.\n\nThree hundred *li* north of Sword Pass, beneath Tortoise Mountain,\nLived He Zhiqing, who had a son, Wufang.\nWufang married the daughter of the Lord of Fish Mountain, Fu,\nAnd a year later, Fu fell gravely ill.\nHis daughter asked her mother-in-law for leave to visit him,\nAnd permission was granted. She set out with her husband.\nMidway, she remembered a pair of gold earrings in her dowry chest\nAnd wished to bring them to aid her father in his distress.\nHurrying, she forgot them, and by the time she thought to return,\nThe sun was already setting.\nThen Wufang’s younger brother, Liangneng, caught up with them,\nBringing the earrings. He said,\n“Mother is unwell and sent me to fetch my brother.\nShe also asked me to bring what my sister-in-law forgot.\nWhen you reach your in-laws’ home, brother, you may return first—\nMother is eagerly awaiting you.”\nWufang replied, “Go with my wife. I will return to see our mother.”\nAfter parting, Lady Fu soon regretted her words:\n“My home is less than ten *li* away—no need for my brother-in-law to accompany me.”\nLiangneng believed her and took his leave.\nWhen he returned, it was late at night.\nThe next day, the Fus were surprised their daughter had not arrived as promised.\nThey sent someone to meet her on the road,\nOnly to find her dead, headless.\nFu’s illness worsened, and he died.\nHis family reported the matter to the authorities.\nHe Zhiqing, with only his young son to rely on, was interrogated.\nAfter a month, the case was closed: Liangneng had falsely confessed.\nAfter parting from his brother, he had forced himself upon his sister-in-law,\nAnd when she refused, he killed her.\nHer head was missing—likely devoured by tigers or leopards.\nAs Liangneng faced execution, weeping in despair,\nThe Spirit of Tortoise Mountain, Yimin, came to me with the truth.\nI investigated and uncovered the facts:\nA bandit named Niu Zi had quarreled with his wife, Mao.\nOn the road, he encountered Lady Fu, robbed her,\nAnd forced her to exchange clothes with Mao—they were of similar age.\nHe beheaded Mao, took Lady Fu home,\nAnd left her body in the wilderness.\n\nI summoned Mao’s soul and attached it to Zi’s body,\nUsing his mouth to speak her words and reveal the truth.\nZi was brought to justice, the daughter’s body was returned to the Fus,\nAnd Liangneng was exonerated.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six of Jumu Prefecture**\nOf all beings, none is more noble than man—\nYet this body is not easily attained through cultivation.\nOnce born of womb and flesh, it should be cherished,\nBut for the sake of food and raiment, men sink into ruin.\n\nHow different is my boundless compassion?\nHeaven and Earth give life equally to all.\nFrom this, the customs of the land were transformed,\nAnd the cruel practice of culling infants ceased, sparing the gods from offense.\n\nNorthwest of Jianbei, where the roads fork eastward,\nBeyond two hamlets, lies the prefecture of Ju.\nIts fertile soil sustains the poor,\nYet among its households, fate varies by rank:\nThose of the *jia* class rear their sons,\nThose of the *yi* may or may not,\nBut those of the *bing* and *ding* classes—\nTheir children are left to die.\nFor they hoard food and clothing, seeking ease in the moment,\nHeedless of what comes after.\n\nZhang Qianshi was a wealthy landlord.\nEighty households tilled his fields for sustenance.\nOn the day he granted them land, he made this pact:\nThose who already had sons strong enough to plow and harvest might keep them,\nBut any born thereafter would not be tolerated—\nThis was his unchanging rule.\n\nQianshi had twelve sons.\nThe eldest was disabled and unfit for labor.\nThe second, at three years old, suffered from convulsions.\nPhysicians, diviners, shamans—none could cure him.\nHe prayed to the local deity, Lord Gongsun Zhang,\nFor ten days to no avail.\nZhang came to me, pleading for help.\nI followed him and inquired into the cause of this calamity.\nIt was revealed that among his tenants, past and present,\nOver forty infants had been abandoned—\nTheir souls, adrift in the void, had joined forces to haunt him.\n\nI appeared in the dream of his wife, Lady Li,\nAnd she recounted the matter.\nThough she spoke, Qianshi remained unrepentant.\nI then dispatched my attendant, Xun Ming, to deliver my words,\nMaking his youngest son speak them:\n*\"The child you abandon is as your own;\nThe child you love is as another’s.\nYou covet their labor yet resent their idle mouths,\nConsuming their grain.\nNow forty-some lives press upon you—\nYour son is on the brink of death.\"*\n\nQianshi reproached himself bitterly,\nKowtowing until his forehead bled,\nBegging me for mercy.\nI admonished him to change his ways,\nAnd he complied.\nHis son recovered,\nAnd from then on, the people of the prefecture cherished life,\nAnd the population gradually flourished.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: Rescuing the Drowned**\nAutumn rains poured without end,\nThree rivers converged like a single flood.\nMirror Pool swelled, bottomless in its depth,\nThe city walls crumbled—urgent was the peril.\n\nThe remnant folk of Baima were virtuous,\nAnd Magistrate Huang Gao’s governance was benevolent.\nWith a single shout from Bo Jian, the waves stilled—\nWho would dare claim the raging torrent could capsize a boat?\n\nThe prefecture of Baima,\nHome to over eight hundred households,\nLay at the confluence of three rivers.\nAutumn rains fell ceaselessly for three months.\nThe northeastern valleys and the river swelled in unison,\nChoking at the mouth of Lingyan Gorge,\nUnable to drain.\nWaves surged, submerging the land,\nAnd the people faced the dread of drowning.\n\nThe local deity, Bo Jian, came to report:\n*\"Baima is a small prefecture,\nOnce subject to the people, now a dependency of Shu.\nIts magistrate, Huang Gao, is kind and loves his people.\nYet Heaven has sent these endless rains,\nRuining the harvest.\nThe three rivers encircle us—\nThe people’s lives hang in the balance.\"*\n\nAs this was within my jurisdiction,\nI went with Jian.\nUpon arrival, the waters had risen tenfold,\nAnd the people scurried like ants fleeing a collapsing nest.\nOnly fifteen or sixteen parts of the city walls remained.\nThe young carried their kin but could not escape;\nThe old were abandoned, left to await their fate.\nMy heart grieved for them.\n\nI had Bo Jian convey the Emperor’s decree,\nCommanding the waters to return to their proper course.\nThis is what is meant by \"shouting at the river god.\"\nFrom then on, the people of the prefecture—\nThousands of lives—\nWere spared the disaster of drowning.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: The Grain Rain**\nHow does one plant the seeds of hidden virtue?\nBy placing the people’s welfare first in all affairs.\nXu Shi exhausted his fortune to relieve famine,\nWhile the Luo family hoarded grain, refusing even a needle’s worth.\n\nTo accumulate yet know when to disperse—this is the Way of Heaven.\nWealth may turn to poverty, for ghosts will seize what is withheld.\nOne man dies, another prospers—there is reason in this,\nFor the workings of Creation are profound indeed.\n\nIn the great prefecture of Baxi,\nOne or two in a hundred were rich,\nWhile the poor toiled to survive.\nWhen the Emperor of Shu first ascended the throne,\nThe year was one of great famine.\nThough the Emperor lived frugally and labored for his people,\nHis virtue had not yet borne fruit,\nAnd the lingering misfortune was not yet spent.\nThe people of Baxi suffered most grievously from hunger.\n\nThe wealthy farmer Luo Mi hoarded his grain,\nWhile the righteous man Xu Rong spent his entire fortune to aid the poor.\nThe needy came endlessly,\nAnd his resources could not keep pace.\nAll day, he burned incense and prayed to Heaven for aid.\n\nThe local spirit, He Laisun, reported this to me.\nI memorialized the Emperor,\nAnd a decree was issued to seize Luo Mi’s stored grain—\nFive thousand *hu* in all—and rain it down.\nI then commanded the Wind Master to strike Luo’s granary.\nThe grain swirled on the wind,\nFalling from the sky like rain,\nEach kind gathering by color,\nScattering across the fields and streets.\nNot a soul in the prefecture went unfed.\n\nLuo’s hoarded stores were exhausted in a single day.\nThe people, grateful for Xu’s kindness,\nOften repaid him,\nRelieved at Luo’s misfortune and calling it just.\nThe Emperor of Shu appointed Xu as his prefectural aide,\nAnd Luo, upon hearing this, hanged himself.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine: The Crooked Rain**\nNorth of the Ju suburbs, west of the Ba River,\nStands Dragon Mountain, steep and perilous to climb.\n\nThe people here have long been wholly filial and reverent,\nIn years of famine, they have long awaited clouds and rainbows.\nThis crooked bestowal of gracious moisture bore autumn’s harvest,\nSpared the remnant folk from suffering in summer’s fields.\n\nSince then, many have come to resettle here,\nThe old leaning on others, the young carried in arms.\nNorth of the Ju suburbs, west of the Ba River,\nStands Dragon Mountain.\nAt its foot dwell some three hundred households.\n\nIn the early years of the Silkworm Emperor,\nAll of Shu suffered a great drought.\nThe local deity, Lord Su, could not bear to see his people perish in the famine.\nHe blamed himself, saying:\n*“The able-bodied among my people labor without complaint,\nThe elderly rest in peace—this is not unfilial.\nThey endure corvée without resentment—this is not disloyal.\nThey plow in spring, sow in summer, and sacrifice to Heaven and Earth in winter—this is not irreverent.\nThey tend their fine fields, rejoicing in their bounty,\nAnd once the harvest comes, they dare not taste it first—this is not disobedient.\nSuch loyal, filial, reverent, and obedient people,\nYet drought strikes as a calamity, sparing none—this is my failing.”*\n\nTo make his plea heard in Heaven,\nHe commanded the local earth deities to take charge.\nI then summoned the artisans of Zhiliang,\nAnd borrowed the waters of the Ba River to curve and bestow rain.\nAfter three days, the drought broke,\nAnd a bountiful harvest followed.\nThe people named the village *Jiaze* (“Gracious Moisture”),\nAnd those from elsewhere who moved here gradually grew in number.\n\n**Chapter Forty: The Buried Bandit**\nA dutiful wife toils to care for her mother-in-law,\nHer heart as clear as water, ever mindful of her first husband.\nShe forgoes adornment, to others’ surprise,\nFinding joy in needlework to sustain herself.\n\nAfter a proper burial and a mournful sacrifice,\nThe foolish folk, even in broad daylight, break in to steal.\nNot only was her steadfast virtue blessed by the gods,\nBut the greedy and cruel met with ghostly retribution.\n\nAt the source of the Han River lived a filial widow named Yang Liangzhong,\nA woman of noble lineage who married the poor scholar Yong Youzhang.\nWhen Youzhang died young,\nLiangzhong vowed never to remarry.\n\nAs her savings dwindled and her coffers emptied,\nWith no one else to rely on,\nHer mother-in-law grew old and ill.\nMatchmakers came daily, urging her:\n*“What people desire are beauty and wealth.\nYour family is poor, struck by misfortune.\nYet suitors still seek you—perhaps because,\nThough your years are not yet spent and your qi still flourishes,\nYou bear no illness, making you a worthy match.\nHow could you abandon your aged mother-in-law,\nForget your first husband,\nAnd turn your back to serve another?”*\n\nSkilled in needlework, which she had never sullied,\nShe sewed, washed, and mended for others to scrape by.\n*“My mother-in-law and I endure this out of necessity,”* she said.\n*“Once she passes, I can remarry—it is not too late.”*\n\nShe cut her hair in mourning and renounced adornment,\nSupporting herself with women’s work.\nFor six years she persevered.\nWhen her mother-in-law died, she buried her with full rites,\nAnd three days later, held a sacrificial offering.\nOver a hundred villagers came to assist.\n\nA thief, seizing her absence,\nBroke through the wall and opened the lock,\nMaking off with all her savings.\nLiangzhong remained unaware.\n\nHer household earth deity, Bai Zhiyi,\nAlong with the village’s spirit-official, Kang Chaosheng,\nSought to punish the thief.\nCoinciding with my arrival in Baozhong,\nThey reported the matter to me.\nI dispatched thirty spectral soldiers,\nWho seized the thief in the marketplace.\nHe was made to declare before the crowd all he had stolen:\n*“These belong to the chaste widow, Madam Yang.\nThey must be returned.”*\nThen, raising his hands to his mouth,\nHe bit off all ten fingers and died.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: The Northern Suburb**\nThe weight of continuing one’s lineage is no small matter,\nYet it lies in the heart’s field where fruits are sown.\nTo rush is clumsy and still yields little,\nWhile inviting trouble only deepens unrest.\n\nTending plants and trees serves as a parable:\nRelieve the orphaned and poor, and sincerity will follow.\nGongzi, heir to his family, was called *Divine Protector*—\nThus is retribution made clear.\n\nIn the northern suburb of Shu’s capital lived a man named Wang Shangzhong,\nWealthy but childless.\nAt forty, he grew anxious and devised a plan:\nHe hastily took many concubines, yet none bore him a child.\nHe then adopted a son from his clan,\nBut the boy’s nature was treacherous and impatient.\nIf a concubine displeased him even slightly,\nHe would beat or replace her.\nIf the adopted son disobeyed his teachings,\nHe would drive him away.\nThe more frantic his efforts, the more flawed his schemes.\nYears passed, and he neared fifty.\n\nHe then prepared a grand feast,\nInviting many renowned shamans and diviners.\nTheir songs and prayers lasted over a month.\nI transformed into a layman and said to him:\n*“When planting peach and plum trees,\nYou tend and water them,\nYet before long, you prune their branches,\nHoping for quick growth.\nYou then uproot and replant them,\nAdding fertilizer,\nChecking their roots before the season is right,\nInspecting their firmness.\nSeeing their leaves flourish,\nYou dig them up again,\nDiscard the old soil,\nAnd move them once more.\nYour efforts are excessive, yet no fruit comes—\nCan this be called wisdom?”*\n*“No,”* he replied.\nI said: *“How is your quest for an heir different?\nI now advise you:\nCalm your heart and body,\nChange your past ways.\nEase the burdens on others,\nForgive their faults.\nKeep the concubines who are content,\nAnd marry off those who are not.\nThe son you adopted from your clan,\nThough not of your blood, calls you father.\nHold fast to your original intent,\nOverlook minor grievances.\nIf you have a son, do not abandon him.\nSave those on the brink of death,\nAid those in dire need,\nRelieve the poor,\nAnd care for the orphaned.\nDevote yourself to this,\nAnd leave the rest to Heaven.\nIf you persist for three years,\nGood fortune will come.”*\n\nAfter speaking, I vanished.\nShangzhong believed me, taking it as a divine message.\nLater, he married off thirteen maidservants.\nHe arranged marriages for his two adopted sons,\nProviding them separate homes for long-term stability.\nHe buried over fifty poor parents,\nAnd arranged marriages for over eighty impoverished men and women.\nWithin three years,\nHe indeed fathered a noble heir,\nWhom he named *Shenbao* (“Divine Protector”).\nThe boy grew up to uphold his family.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two: The Returning Flame**\nBrothers, born of the same branch,\nHow could they spy on each other like neighbors?\n\n**The Returning Flame**\n\nThe Lord of Ju’s greed was hard to fathom,\nYet the pure and loyal King of Shu never doubted him.\nA raging flame stretching to the heavens was truly fearsome,\nBut a mighty wind turned back upon its bearer brought peril.\nA voice from the void spoke with perfect clarity—\nOnly then did they believe the gods could not be deceived.\n\nKing Yuliang of Shu had a younger brother, Jiameng, whom he enfeoffed at Ju, making him the Lord of Ju. Over time, Ju sent envoys demanding bribes, but the King of Shu refused. Thereupon, Ju dispatched men to burn Shu’s treasuries. The fire blazed fiercely. Upon hearing this, I commanded the Wind Master to reverse the flames, declaring aloud Ju’s treachery. In an instant, all Ju’s messengers perished in the fire. From then on, Ju and Shu waged war for three years, yet Ju could never overcome Shu.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three: Pacifying Ju**\n\nThe Lord of Ju established his state as Jiameng,\nForgetting that Yufu was his own brother.\nWeapons clashed, and the people died unjustly,\nWhile neighboring borders vied in vain.\nThen, through envoys, the situation was discussed—\nDivine soldiers appeared to show the weight of heaven’s will.\nOnce the people of Jia realized righteousness,\nThey spared the common folk from suffering.\n\nAfter Ju and Shu had long been at odds, the King of Shu grew weary of war and sent Zhuang Su to negotiate peace. The Lord of Ju refused. Zhuang Su then spoke of Shu’s military strength, pointing toward the western frontier. I manifested divine soldiers to warn him. Suspecting an ambush, the Lord of Ju sought a truce. His envoys reported this to the king, who then built a temple for me north of the capital.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four: Fei Ding**\n\nThough he upheld the straight path in life, he met with misfortune,\nHis lingering spirit after death scorned empty flattery.\nThe king favored the Five Ding, forgetting military preparedness—\nI, in turn, opposed them with the might of the Three Di.\nObsessed with piling earth to honor his concubine’s tomb,\nHe scorned talk of war and rejected defense of the frontier.\n“What care I for your ominous words?” he sneered,\nThen destroyed my temple—what harm could that do?\n\nA mountain spirit from Wudu transformed into a woman, surpassingly beautiful, the like of which had never been seen in Shu. King Kaiming Shang of Shu saw her and was captivated, taking her as his concubine. Soon after, she died, and the king mourned her endlessly. He ordered her tomb built ever higher to show his undying devotion. The five Fei brothers of Wudu, men of great strength, curried favor with the king. Using their might, they hauled earth from Wudu Mountain to raise the tomb, and in no time, the mound rivaled the mountain’s height. The king named it Wukai Mountain, saying the concubine’s death had moved the earth.\n\nThereafter, the king trusted and favored the Five Ding, keeping them constantly by his side. He himself was strong and proud of his prowess. With the Five Ding at his command, he boasted that his bare hands could break spears and halberds, that his fleet feet could outrun chariots and cavalry. Thus, he neglected border defenses, dismantling outposts and extinguishing beacons.\n\nAs I was now his tutelary deity, receiving his sacrifices, and with mighty Qin on his borders, I feared the unforeseen. I transformed into a scholar, calling myself Zhang Sheng of the Northern Capital, and knocked at the palace gates to submit a memorial. Its gist was this:\n\n*“I have heard that those who rely on virtue prosper, while those who rely on force perish. In the governance of Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang, the ministers at court were known by name, yet none relied solely on strength. Mere personal bravery cannot be depended upon, nor can exceptional skill overawe enemies. Fei Lian and E Lai could not save King Zhou of Shang, nor could Hou Yi and Ao escape violent deaths. In recent times, the Three Di, though tall and mighty, were ultimately exterminated.*\n\n*Now, the five Fei brothers at the frontier possess no virtue, only brute strength. The king, impressed by their size and might, has neglected military preparedness. I say that the strength of the Fei brothers may equal ten men, even a hundred, but if used against an enemy, it will be of no avail. If stationed on watchtowers or employed as charioteers, their bare arms and legs wielding bows and reins, running to serve—this is acceptable. But to rely on them to repel neighboring states is folly. In truth, they are no different from the Red, White, or Long Di of old.*\n\n*I urge you to cherish the foundations laid by your ancestors and strengthen border defenses against Qin. Do not let the bravado of a few men undermine the discipline of the Three Armies.”*\n\nThe king was displeased: *“You urge me to tighten military preparedness yet mock my nurturing of talented warriors. It is like hunting without hawks or guarding against thieves without dogs.”*\n\nI argued vehemently, but the Five Ding, basking in the king’s favor, sought to humiliate me. I vanished from their sight. The Five Ding declared me a demon and said, *“This must be Zhang Zhongzi of the Northern Suburbs.”* They then destroyed my temple, but I paid it no mind.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five: The Stone Oxen**\n\nShu and Ba clashed—Shu was rich and strong,\nQin coveted Shu and schemed cunningly.\nNot that King Hui devised a wise plan,\nBut that Kaiming’s folly led him astray.\nStone oxen stood at the mountain’s foot,\nMolten gold hidden beneath their tails.\nGreed blinded him to loyal ministers’ counsel—\nCarving roads and raising armies brought later calamity.\n\nAs the Zhou house declined, the feudal lords encroached upon one another. Ba and Shu fell into conflict, and Qin, bordering Shu, plotted to annex it. King Hui of Qin followed the strategy of Sima Cuo, but the Shu roads were perilously steep, leaving no path for an army. Thus, at the Qin-Shu border, they carved five stone oxen, each of colossal size, and placed them in the grass. They also cast gold into cakes and hid them beneath the oxen’s tails. Spies were sent to observe. After a month, the gold cakes were taken, only to be replaced. As the thefts grew frequent, the King of Shu learned of it. He sent men to investigate and, over months, amassed over a thousand catties of gold.\n\nHe then ordered the Five Ding to carve a treacherous path, leading five thousand soldiers to haul the stone oxen back. On the day they set out, I once more transformed, this time into a scholar named Zhonggong Zichang, and sought an audience at court. I submitted a memorial, warning that opening the road was unwise and that the gold was a snare. The king laughed and said:\n\n*“Heaven does not begrudge the Dao, nor earth its treasures. By the grace of the altars of soil and grain, stone oxen and yellow gold have entered my realm. Gold is the most precious of treasures—it can enrich the state, strengthen the army, and ease the people’s burdens. You suspect deceit from a neighboring state—this is overcaution. Who would cast away thousands of gold to set a trap?”*\n\nLet the gentleman wait but a moment longer—the stone oxen shall soon arrive.\n\nI raised my face to heaven and cried out, shedding tears in streams. The king deemed me an ill omen, and his attendants dragged me out. I then withdrew into concealment.\n\n**Five Wives (Forty-Sixth)**\nThe Qin, greedy for Shu’s land, schemed to swallow it whole;\nA treacherous path was carved, opening Shu’s gates wide.\nYet still they feared the stone oxen might expose their ruse,\nSo offered royal daughters to seal the bond anew.\nThey never reckoned a great state makes a perilous match,\nAssuming only sincerity lay behind the vow.\nThough I knew my words of warning would be spurned as waste,\nHow could I bear silence and betray my lord’s trust?\n\nOnce the stone oxen were brought back, the King of Qin said: *“This stratagem served well to open the road, but if the oxen return without gold, my plan is undone.”* He then sent envoys to propose a marriage alliance with Shu, declaring: *“Qin and Shu are neighbors—kinship and goodwill between neighbors are the natural order. I have five daughters of royal blood; I ask that the King of Shu accept them as brides.”*\n\nThe King of Shu rejoiced greatly. Upon hearing this, I sighed and said: *“That is a mighty state—how could such a thing be fitting for us?”* The king dispatched the Five Ding to the border to receive the Qin princesses. He himself prepared a thousand chariots and waited at the northern outskirts, eager to glimpse their faces.\n\nI then appeared among the guards in the guise of a scholar, stepped forward, and submitted a memorial in protest. The king grew furious: *“Are you not that meddlesome Zhang Zhongzi of Beiguo? This is the third time your slanderous words have shamed me!”* He ordered his attendants to seize me. I revealed my wrathful aspect, and the guards scattered in terror. Thus I escaped.\n\n**Manifesting the Divine (Forty-Seventh)**\nMy loyal heart could not endure Qin’s encroachment on Shu;\nThough I remonstrated with all my strength, my lord spurned me.\nMy fierce mien was meant to strike fear into the enemy,\nYet in an instant, my great form vanished, concealed by jade decree.\nThe winding path of seven bends was just traversed,\nWhen mountains crushed the host of spirits—all perished in the end.\nFrom that time on, this corner of the land knew reverence,\nAnd the might of Jiannan blazed like fire.\n\nAfter the Five Ding escorted the Qin princesses back, the people of Shu—from the lowliest to the highest—rejoiced, blind to the snare of disaster. They mistook peril for fortune, mourning for celebration—such is the common folly of the multitude.\n\nI then manifested my colossal form upon the southern slope of Jianling, blocking the road, hoping the Qin princesses would turn back in fear. The people of Qin and Shu who witnessed this were struck with awe. Amid the clamor of weapons and the din of chariots, a jade-like voice resounded, saying: *“What Heaven has doomed cannot be revived—such is the King of Shu. What Heaven has destined to rise cannot be thwarted—such is the King of Qin. You are truly loyal, but what can loyalty do against Heaven’s decree?”* I then withdrew.\n\nThe Five Ding recognized me and cried: *“This must be the Beiguo spirit Zhang Zhongzi!”* They sought to seize and devour me. The clamor of the multitude shook the mountains and rivers. The Five Ding pursued me as I fled through the heart of the mountain, carving a path of seven winding turns. As I neared a cave, they overtook me and seized me with force. I had no choice but to expand my form a hundredfold, allowing them to tug and drag me. Soon, my head pierced the mountain’s summit. I turned my radiance back to gaze upon them, shaking the earth with my power—the mountain trembled in response. The Five Ding and the Qin princesses were swept beneath the cliffs as the mountain collapsed with terrifying speed. Thus, the Five Ding and the Five Wives were all buried beneath the land. Thereafter, Shu was annexed by Qin, and I bore no further regret.\n\n**Great Elixir (Forty-Eighth)**\nThe Old Master wearied of war in the Central Plains,\nAnd journeyed west to compose the *Huahu Jing*.\n\nAmid the clouds, chariots and cavalry stretched a thousand li,\nWherever I passed, spirits and deities escorted me ten stages on.\nThe heart of impartiality dissolved the grievance of slain lives,\nSwallowing the elixir, the resolve of the body grew light as one.\n\nThe Qian direction was no place to conceal myself,\nSo I dwelt in the Kun corner to console the multitudes.\nAfter Shu’s fall, its altars and temples were overturned,\nThe hundred spirits abandoned their sacrifices, their blood-offerings left unclaimed.\nI wandered to Kongtong, seeking respite for a time.\n\nSuddenly, within the cloud-laden thoroughfare, banners, pennants, chariots, and cavalry passed for three days.\nThe mountain spirits remarked to one another: “Such a spectacle—surely a sage or worthy is passing through.”\nSoon after, the Old Master, accompanied by the Two Perfected Ones of Left and Right, journeyed from east to west.\nI joined the ranks, bowing among the earth deities of the Western Marchmount’s domain.\nThe Western Marchmount issued a decree: all earth deities bowed and escorted them ten stages.\nI remained among the protective retinue for several days.\n\nOne day, I earnestly entreated the Old Master,\nAnd the Perfected One recounted my past merits and faults in Shu.\nThe Old Master said: “When the Great Dao prevails, the world is held in common.\nSince your heart was impartial, and you remonstrated thrice with Shu—this was your merit.\nThough the Five Ding and Five Wives perished by your hand, your heart held to impartiality, so it was no fault.\nThough you rendered service to Shu, now the state bears the name of Qin, yet its towns and villages remain Shu’s.\nYou should forever receive Shu’s sacrifices to console its people.”\n\nThereupon, he commanded Xu Jia to take a single grain of medicine from his pouch and bestow it upon me, saying:\n“This is the Great Elixir. You should ingest it.\nIn its fullness, it unites with the Dao as truth; as an elixir, it merges with the heart as one.\nThereafter, your five penetrations will be complete—unlike your former self.\nThe Central Plains are in turmoil, and I weary of it.\nNow I shall enter the Western Regions to transform the lands.\nThree hundred years hence, the teachings of the West will flourish and come to the Middle Kingdom.\nYou should have faith in them.”\nI reverently received his words.\n\n**Ba Capital (Forty-Ninth)**\n\nIn all affairs, never deceive the heart—\nwhen the heart’s mirror dims, calamity soon invades.\nCunning schemes to accept pearls, boasting of luck in restraint,\nharsh verdicts in court, flaunting one’s resolve.\nTwo hundred lashes may not lightly be pardoned,\nyet enduring pain for thirty days is for one to weigh.\nTemple rites and offerings were never my desire—\nonly to repay with uprightness those who know my heart.\n\nAfter Qin annexed Shu, it sent Zhang Yi to capture the King of Ba and seize his lands, thereafter establishing Ba Capital as a commandery. Some time later, Yi Tingyi, the governor of Ba Capital, fell ill, and the commandery’s administrator took charge of affairs. A slave of the commoner Zhang Wei, named Wanzhen, threw himself into a well and died. The case dragged on for over a month, and Wei, unable to endure the flogging, falsely confessed: “It was I who killed him and cast him in.” In truth, Wanzhen had earlier committed some offense, and Wei had once beaten him. Within three days, Wanzhen stole Wei’s valuables, intending to flee elsewhere, but was discovered by Wei. Fearing he could not escape punishment, Wanzhen took his own life—it was not Wei who killed him.\n\nWhen the verdict was reached, Wei’s son heard of it and sent someone to present Yi Tingyi with a hundred large pearls. Tingyi said to his attendant: “You, the physician, on another day bring only a small box of medicinal powder. Even in the presence of guests, do not act ashamed.” The family was overjoyed. On the appointed day, they waited at the gate to present it. Tingyi happened to be entertaining over ten guests, wine and dishes already laid out, when the physician arrived. He was invited to sit at the end of the table. After three rounds of drinking, the physician rose and spoke of presenting the medicine. Tingyi accepted it, but as soon as it was taken inside, he regretted it, saying: “The matter is unclear, and I fear slanderous talk.” He ordered it brought out again, still sealed as before. Then he commanded the physician to open the box and take out the medicine, yet still anxious that word might leak, he divided it among all the guests. The next day, Wei’s forced confession was upheld, and he was ultimately sentenced to execution.\n\nWei’s son wailed in the marketplace, looking to the heavens and crying out: “Is there no divine spirit to examine this injustice?” I witnessed this and that night summoned the souls of Tingyi, Wei and his son, and the physician, who revealed the truth. Tingyi said: “The pearls were indeed taken by me. The medicine in the box was something I had long prepared. I had just accepted the pearls when I changed my mind. Though I took them, I feared the governor would learn of it, so I dared not alter the verdict.” I ordered Tingyi’s back to be flogged two hundred times. The next day, the interrogated man awoke and gave the same account as before. All were astonished, but soon after, Tingyi developed an abscess on his back. He howled in agony for over a month before dying.\n\nWei’s family built a temple for me, and the people of the entire commandery came to revere it.\n\n**Posa (Fiftieth)**\n\nA child’s birth demands reverence for parents,\nFrom infancy they toil to raise your frame.\nTo claim another’s name should bring you shame—\nHow could you cast aside the ones who bore you, though poor they remain?\nIn office, punished—suffering hard to bear;\nIn dreams, the lash falls—pain the same, no less.\nYet once injustice binds them as father and son,\nCan the customs of our homeland return to their purest dress?\n\nWithin the borders of the two commanderies of Ba and Shu, there stands a mountain called Posa. The mountain spirit Yuan Anxing came to the waters of Yu in Ba Commandery and addressed me, saying: “In the lands I govern, the people are diligent and trustworthy, filial toward their ancestors to the utmost, and reverent toward spirits and gods. In matters great or small, they divine with tortoise and milfoil—only if the omens are auspicious do they dare to act. The Mountain King once ruled all the spirits of Shu. Now Ba, Shu, Qian, and Han are divided into four commanderies, though the Qin regard them all as one, calling them Shu. In the lands I govern, why does the King not deign to visit?”\n\nI, considering it not an official matter, did not wish to go lightly. One day, Anxing came again and said: “In my domain, there is a man named Zhou Fu, originally the son of the Yuan clan—a kinsman of mine. He abandoned his carriage to follow the Yuans, as custom simplifies the name.”\n\nZhou Fu’s birth date and hour were both inauspicious, so his grandfather forbade raising him. His father, Pingshu, could not bear to abandon him and had him nursed in secret outside the home. On New Year’s Day when he was three, he was brought before the grandchildren to pay respects. The old man flew into a rage and berated his son: “Do you mean to kill me with this ill-omened child?” Pingshu carried him out at once.\n\nThey happened to meet a friend, Zhou Ningzhi, on the road. Pingshu told him the story, and Ningzhi said: “I have no heir. Let me raise him. If one day my wife bears a son, I will return him to your family.” Pingshu agreed. Thereafter, the Zhous grew ever wealthier, while the Yuans suffered one misfortune after another and fell into dire poverty. When the Zhous had a son of their own, they no longer spoke of the earlier promise.\n\nAfter Ningzhi died, Pingshu would visit Fu from time to time. If Fu was in urgent need, Pingshu would help him repeatedly. Pingshu privately believed Fu was truly his own son and had not forgotten him. When an opportunity arose, he told Fu the whole story. Just then, Fu’s younger brother arrived and overheard Pingshu’s words. He drove Pingshu out, and the next day filed a complaint with the authorities, accusing Pingshu of falsehood. Pingshu was flogged. He burned incense on his head and reported the matter to Anxing, saying: “My son dares to flog his father.”\n\nAnxing knew the details and realized this was not Fu’s true intention, but he had not yet decided what to do when the King intervened on Pingshu’s behalf. I then went with Anxing to visit Fu. That night, I dreamed of Fu, seeing the circumstances of his birth, his grandfather’s refusal to raise him, and how his own father had nursed and reared him. Before the dream ended, I awoke in tears, wishing to take my own life. But I was bound by the official records and constrained by his younger brother, so I endured in silence.\n\nThat night, I dreamed again, rebuking Fu for not immediately obeying and flogging him a hundred times. When Fu awoke, he could not sleep until dawn. The next day, he went to the Yuan household and said to Pingshu: “I was slow to understand. As your own flesh and blood, I have now been rebuked by the gods, who nearly flogged me to death. I repent. Moreover, the Zhous have a son to continue their ancestral sacrifices, and I no longer wish to share in their family property. I only desire to follow my father.”\n\nThe villagers, learning of this, praised Fu as virtuous. The Zhous’ son divined and decided to divide the family property, giving a share to Fu and allowing him to return to his original clan. The Yuan couple, now old, had someone to rely on at last.\n\n*The Second Scroll of the Transformations of the Divine Lord of Zitong ends here.*\n[*1 \"Jade Heart\" is likely a scribal error for

Fifty-First**\n\nWhen the Zhou lost the Nine Tripods to Qin and they were moved away,\nAll dragons heeded the Sea God’s command before him.\nYet in their struggle for precedence they vented their lingering wrath,\nHeedless of the calamity they brought upon the people, a grave transgression.\nPointing to stone they swore an oath they could trust,\nLooking to heaven they pledged their words without bias.\nFrom then on, those who tilled and wove along the riverbanks\nNo longer suffered the yearly ravages of flooding.\n\nThe waters of the Qingyi flowed from west to east,\nMeeting the Min River where they converged.\nWhen Qin conquered Zhou and the Nine Tripods were moved west,\nThe spirits of the mountains gathered at the sacred peaks,\nAnd the dragons of the rivers paid homage to the Sea God,\nThus obeying the mandate of revolution and offering their numinous blessings.\nTwo dragons, both heading east, met in the river,\nConverging at its center, each vying to go first.\nNeither would yield in their struggle,\nBattling in the river’s depths.\nThe two waters surged, waves and billows raging,\nFlooding the homes of over a thousand families along the banks.\nIn a single day, the waters rose, leaving no time to flee.\nThe cries of suffering reached the four corners of the land.\n\nI happened to witness this and first dispatched a host of ten thousand spirit soldiers\nTo block the raging waves.\nThen I entered the water to mediate their dispute, saying:\n“The mandate of renewal has replaced my former virtue,\nYet lingering resentment remains—all spirits feel this.\nWhy should you two alone be different?\nNow, in your struggle for precedence, you have brought disaster upon the people.\nHad my soldiers not blocked the flood,\nNot a single soul in this town would have survived.\nMoreover, the August Supreme favors life—what use is regret once harm is done?”\n\nThe two dragons replied: “We respectfully accept your command.\nSince we were both sent forth, let us now make a pact to resolve this.\nWhen we return from paying homage to the sea,\nWe will entrust the matter to you.”\nLooking to heaven, they swore an oath,\nPointing to two great stones, east and west, and commanding them to rise.\nIn an instant, the two stones stood upright.\nI then admonished them: “The dragons of the two rivers have reconciled,\nWith heaven and earth as their witness.\nThis vow must not be broken.\nIf these two stones ever merge into one,\nThen today’s oath will be rendered void.”\nWith that, they parted and withdrew.\n\n**Admonition to the Phoenix Mountain Fifty-Second**\n\nThrough a thousand layers of flesh she bore the womb’s burden,\nTen months of pregnancy—how could it be easy?\nA single word against her master’s will,\nAnd for twelve years she endured the torment of exile in her own body.\nHad her soul not soared in dreams,\nHow could she have found shelter by the mountain to escape the storm?\nMother and child reunited as before—heaven’s principle endures,\nIn her later years, she enjoyed the sweetness of filial care.\n\nAt the edge of Guoshan,\nA wealthy man named Wang Ji, fifty years old and childless,\nOnce, after drinking and feasting to excess, glanced at his wife and said:\n“People desire wealth to ensure sustenance in life and ancestral sacrifices after death.\nNow, though I am rich, I have no son—what use is wealth to me?”\nHis wife, Lady An, also from a prominent family, had never borne children.\nProud and jealous by nature, she felt ashamed upon hearing this.\nShe took her jewelry and dowry, bought a girl from the Liu family,\nAnd presented her to her husband.\nA year later, the girl conceived.\nLady An rejoiced, burning incense day and night,\nPraying to heaven and earth, beseeching for an heir to the Wang lineage.\nWhen she learned of Liu’s pregnancy,\nShe gave the girl her own clothes and ornaments.\nIn matters of diet, rest, and care, she spared no effort.\nIn the month before the birth, she prepared in advance, selecting a midwife.\nWhen the time came, a son was born.\nOverjoyed, she personally tended to the child’s nursing, swaddling,\nAnd even washed his diapers and cleaned him after bowel movements,\nTreating him as if he were her own.\nHer husband praised her virtue.\nWhen the child turned one hundred days old, they named him Yishou,\nA name reflecting Lady An’s wishes.\nSoon after, they hired a wet nurse to care for him exclusively.\n\nSome said to Liu: “You and I are host and guest in this household.\nSince you arrived, you have enjoyed the same food and comforts as I.\nNow, because of my son, your child is nearly a year old.\nI will arrange a matchmaker to marry you to a good man.”\nLiu wept bitterly and said: “That is not my wish.\nI only desire to stay with Yishou until death.”\nLady An, displeased, said: “Do you seek to replace me?”\nShe soon beat Liu, stripped her of fine clothes,\nGave her coarse food, and treated her like a beast,\nCalling her by the names of livestock.\nAll hard labor was forced upon Liu.\n\nWhen Yishou was three years old,\nOne day, he ran into Liu’s arms, and they wept together.\nLiu said: “For your sake, I endure hunger, cold, and toil without complaint.\nBut for over a month, I have not seen you—do you miss your mother?”\nYishou wept as well, his cries heard outside.\nLady An rushed in, snatched the child away,\nAnd beat him severely.\nIt was a cold month, and she stripped him of his clothes,\nBanishing him outside for the night.\nAt dawn, she summoned the village elder and expelled Liu.\nWang Ji, grieved by the harm done to Yishou’s heart, urged her to stay.\nLady An said: “I cannot coexist with this beast.\nIf you wish to make her your wife, I will leave.\nIf you want to keep me, she cannot stay.\nIf you delay in deciding, I will seek death before you.”\nUnable to refuse, Wang Ji gave Liu the skirt and hairpins she had worn,\nAllowing her to take them as provisions.\nBut Lady An seized them back.\n\nAfter enduring prolonged hunger and hardship,\nLiu became emaciated, her hair falling out, her skin dark and withered.\nNo one would take her in.\nShe wandered the city, barely sustaining herself,\nUntil Wang’s relatives, who were moving to Tongchuan, took her along.\nA year later, Lady An learned of this and sent a letter filled with abuse,\nDriving her away again.\nWith nowhere to go, Liu resorted to gathering firewood and drawing water,\nEarning a meager living from others.\n\nTwelve years passed.\nBoth of Yishou’s parents died, and he himself had a ten-year-old son named Zhiwei.\nSomeone told his wife, Lady Kang: “Our household is prosperous,\nLacking nothing—except knowledge of my birth mother’s fate.\nDay and night, I grieve, and at thirty, my hair has turned gray—all because of this.”\nHe entrusted his household affairs to his wife, saying:\n“Take good care of our son. I will seek my mother and return only after I find her.”\nHe set out northward, lingering in every town and village along the way,\nHis journey prolonged by his search.\n\nAfter some time, Yishou would weep bitterly whenever he traveled, his grief so consuming that he ate but one meal a day—nothing more than plain rice and vegetables. His sincerity moved both the seen and unseen realms, and wherever he went, the spirits were stirred to respond.\n\nAt the confluence of the Ba and Liang Rivers stood Phoenix Mountain. Wandering there one day, he saw an old woman carrying firewood beneath the scorching sun, sweat streaming down her face. She rested beneath a pine, facing south, and wailed: *\"Yishou, Yishou—is my son well? I suffer here in exhaustion, yet how could he ever think of me?\"*\n\nMoved by what he could not bear to hear, he called to a local man, Dugu Zheng, and asked about her. Zheng replied: *\"That is the birth mother of Wang Yishou.\"*\n\nBy then, Yishou had been away for so long that his family urged his return. He had already begun the journey home when, in a dream, he saw his birth mother at their old home—every detail of her hardships and sorrows, even the place where they would meet on the road. The next day, overjoyed, he declared: *\"The gods have shown me! There is an omen that mother and son shall meet.\"*\n\nHe turned north again, and every mountain, river, and road he passed was just as he had dreamed. After three days, he reached the foot of Phoenix Mountain. As he prepared a meal, a sudden downpour forced travelers to halt. After some time, a village woman entered, carrying firewood. When Yishou saw her and bowed, his heart stirred. He questioned her, and she was indeed his mother. He welcomed her home, and Liu lived to the age of eighty before passing away.\n\n**Fish-Belly Fifty-Three**\nBorn a girl, already lowly in station—\nHow much worse to be seized and sold by a reckless husband.\n\nWeeping, her father was blinded by grief;\nHer mother, consumed by sorrow, seemed lost in madness.\nIn a foreign land, joys and sorrows are truly hard to fathom—\nA single life’s survival or ruin remains unknown.\nOnly when retribution for past wrongs is made manifest\nDoes one, on the brink of death, regret having taken advantage.\n\nAmong the people of Shu, two sons and four daughters were born,\nYet their customs deemed daughters lowly.\nAt the source of the Fu River, a wealthy man named Ren Ying, old and without heirs,\nHad but one daughter, whom he cherished—named Baozhu.\nAt fifteen, she wandered the silkworm market with neighbors,\nAnd in the lantern-lit crowd, lost her way.\nA rogue named Zan Yuan lured her away.\nHer parents offered a great reward and searched for over a month,\nOnly to find she had already been sold by Yuan to a man in Kuizhou.\nHer father wept until he lost his sight;\nHer mother, Lady Yi, fell into a forgetful stupor from grief.\n\nFor ten years, they sought her by every means,\nYet heard not a whisper of her fate.\nYing, having heard of the numinous power of Sevenfold Curve,\nCrawled on elbows and knees, wailing as he made his plea,\nBegging to see his daughter once before he died.\nMoved by his plight, I commanded the Eight Divine Clerks\nTo dispatch three hundred spirit soldiers,\nSearching a thousand *li* in every direction.\nOne day, they saw Baozhu in Kuizhou’s Fish Belly,\nCarrying water and weeping in sorrow.\nThey inquired of the Rang Dragon and learned the truth.\n\nThat night, I appeared to Ying in a dream:\nFrom Sevenfold Curve southward, following the current,\nHe would reach Kuimen, where he would find his daughter and speak with her.\nBaozhu, too, dreamed of her father.\nAt dawn, Ying gave thanks and departed.\nHe sent men to follow the path from his dream—\nAnd there she was.\n\nBaozhu had first been a servant,\nBut her mistress despised her and beat her cruelly.\nShe was then sold to another household,\nWhere her former master demanded double her wages.\nThree years later, a neighbor’s son deceived her, saying,\n*\"Your father seeks you. He sent me to bring you.\"*\nThus, she was sold again—\nThis was her fourth master.\nNow, Baozhu was in the household of Zhang Bai.\nHer mistress loathed pregnant women,\nAnd Baozhu, truly with child, feared punishment\nAnd sought to throw herself into the river.\nBut someone intervened.\nWhen her father heard Baozhu’s voice, his eyes regained sight.\nTogether, they went to her master, ransomed her, and returned home.\nHer mother’s illness, too, was cured.\n\nZan Yuan had grown old.\nI sent the Divine Clerks to oversee his punishment:\nThree hundred lashes a day for over a month,\nUntil his eyes were gouged out.\nHe begged in the marketplace, confessing,\n*\"Baozhu’s ruin was my sin.\nNow, the master of Sevenfold Curve has tormented me near to death.\"*\nA year later, he perished.\n\n**Mouth-Karma Fifty-Four**\nThe retribution for mouth-karma in life is no light matter—\nNever make wicked words your daily lesson.\n\nFalse speech turns emptiness into solid fact,\nFlowery words swell hundreds into thousands in name.\nBlood flows unceasing with the lancet’s sting,\nWhile sins pile high in the Dark Bureau, their tally full.\n\nNo need to seek the Hell of the Plow-Tongue—\nThe case before your eyes is plainly clear.\n\nThe people of Tortoise City had one Zhu Qisheng,\nA man of ready speech who curried favor with inferiors.\nThose lacking in auspicious features he mocked,\nThe fair and comely he slandered.\nThe foolish he held in contempt,\nThe wise and capable he critiqued.\nThe poor he despised,\nThe rich he reviled.\nOfficials spread his private scandals,\nScholars and friends exposed his hidden faults.\nEven those whose lineage, talent, or skill surpassed his own—\nif no flaw could be found—\nhe would say, *\"His grandfather was a lowly man,\nhis father a vulgar one,\"*\nor, *\"His mother’s family were merchants,\nhis wife’s kin brokers.\"*\nOr, *\"His younger brother is no good,\nhis son unfilial.\"*\nNone he knew escaped his biting censure.\n\nThese were but trifling matters.\nWhen someone committed even a minor wrong,\nhe would first spread the word,\nthen embellish it—\nturning nothing into something,\none into ten,\nsuspicion into certainty,\naccident into intent,\ncompulsion into willfulness,\nerror into truth.\nHe would confront them to their face,\nhumiliate them in public,\nthen drag their names through the mud.\n\nNor did he spare even his own kin:\nhis parents\n\nThe lightening or weighting springs from the heart’s design,\nThe delaying or advancing—mere guesswork of the mind.\nWhen karma ripens, both eyes turn blind and waste away,\nWhen skill is mastered, all five fingers break and fray.\n\nThree years of yang-retribution serve as others’ mirror bright,\nYet how escape the lash of soul and postmortem blight?\nIn Shu’s thin soil and shallow streams,\nthe folk who dwell between\nare sharp of wit and quick of scheme,\nadept at profit’s art.\nEven in markets, down to a single coin,\nall things bear counterfeit’s mark.\n\nDongguo’s Li Yongzheng first crafted wheels and carriages,\nbut wearied of the toil and slow returns,\nso turned to making measuring scoops and bushels.\nSoon after, he took up scales and steelyards.\nWithin a year, those who sought deep scoops and heavy weights\nhe charged double and gave them what they asked.\nThose who wanted to shrink a sheng to a shao,\na dou to a he,\nor shave a zhu to a liang,\na liang to a jin—\nhe did the same.\nYongzheng also devised scales with wires twisted in midair,\nscoops with split bottoms and raised beams.\nThe common folk, heedless of retribution,\nfound these convenient for daily use\nand often sought them out.\n\nOne day, the Surveillance Deities reported this,\nand an edict declared:\n*\"Those who use such things are at fault,\nbut those who make them are worse.\"*\nThus, local deities were ordered to warn them openly\nand deal with them in secret.\nI dispatched the local deity Duan Yanmeng to flog Yongzheng in a dream,\nyet though he awoke, he did not repent.\n\nAs his reputation spread,\ndemand grew ever greater.\nGreedy for the craft’s reward,\nhe worked day and night,\nuntil his eyesight dimmed and darkened,\nleaving him blind at forty.\nHis wife abandoned him for another,\nand his two sons, born after, were also blind.\n\nHaving long plied this trade,\nhe was loath to abandon it at once.\nWith no other means of livelihood,\nhe used his hands as eyes,\ngroping for breadth,\nguessing at length.\nSaws, axes, nails, and drills—\nhe wielded them at risk,\nhis left hand’s five fingers\nwounded by morning, maimed by night.\nScabs barely dried, flesh not yet healed,\nwhen fresh pain struck—\nfingers snapped, joints fell away,\nuntil he could no longer grasp a tool.\nWeeping, he wandered the market,\nbut all who knew him\nshowed no pity.\nHunger and cold gnawed at his bones.\nThus, for three years,\nhe was made to publicly confess his sins\nbefore he died.\nHis two sons soon followed, starved to death.\nFrom then on, those who had used his wares\ngrew somewhat more restrained.\n\n**Ox Mountain, Fifty-Six**\nGood deeds must meet their ripe reward,\nWhile evil men encounter evil

are known by their clarity and turbidity.\nSo it is with men.\"*\n\nBefore he finished,\nZhen’s face and neck flushed red.\nHe flung his sleeves and rose, saying:\n*\"If Master Gou is the Wei, then I am the Jing!\nZhen and Gou Xin work together as neighbors,\nand all I do, Xin knows well.\nNow Xin spreads my faults,\nletting the elder compare me to water before all.\nI will repay Xin to make my heart clear—\nXin has never spoken of this to others!\"*\n\nFrom then on,\nwhenever Zhen saw Xin, he glared with hatred.\nThough they exchanged courtesies in form,\nin truth, they were enemies.\nZhen even instructed his son Mingneng\nto watch for an opportunity to kill Xin’s son Yizhen.\n\nThe following spring, during the Silkworm Festival’s revelry,\nMingneng and Yizhen walked together by the river,\ntalking and laughing.\nMingneng harbored malice,\nbut Yizhen was unaware.\nRelying on his strength,\nhe pushed Yizhen into the water.\nYizhen desperately grabbed his clothes,\nand both plunged in,\nbobbing amid the waves.\n\nI was present at the feast for the river deities,\nand ordered the two river dragons to rescue them.\nThe lords of Qi and Fu knew the boys well,\nso they brought Yizhen near the shore\nwhile turning Mingneng toward the depths.\nZhen saw this, hiked up his robes, and rushed over,\ntrying to push Yizhen back in.\nBut Yizhen pulled him in instead.\nThe onlookers stood like a wall,\ntheir cries and wails rising in tumult.\n\nOutraged, I ordered the Qi River dragon\nto drag Zhen by the feet and drown him.\nYizhen emerged unharmed,\nwhile Zhen and his son both drowned.\nThe crowd murmured in pairs:\n*\"Who says the dragons, devas, and eightfold assembly show favoritism?\"*\n\nYet Xin and Zhen’s fortunes were not decided that day.\nXin’s good fruits had ripened,\nwhile Zhen’s evil karma was only now fulfilled.\n\n**Heaven’s Might, Fifty-Seven**\nA woman’s nature is often partial by birth,\nYet filial devotion and earnest care are not easily complete.\nThough past karma may bring the axe of thunder’s wrath,\nIn this life, she is blessed with the chance to serve her parents.\n\nThe raging flames that stretched across the heavens suddenly subsided,\nThe fierce winds that swept the earth swiftly shifted course.\nThe Ma woman’s corpse was burned while the Zhi woman was spared—\nThus did public judgment align with Heaven’s decree.\n\nIn Qi County lived a man named Zhi Zuyi, whose wife, née Yu, was twenty-five. Her mother-in-law, née Huang, was eighty and blind, sharp-tempered and fastidious, difficult to serve. Yet Yu, though young, was diligent, frugal, reverent, and compliant, able to please her—three years passed without a single harsh word between them. One day, her husband, drunk, accidentally knocked over a servant, knocking out two of his teeth. To avoid punishment, he paid compensation, and Yu, following him, contributed her dowry without regret.\n\nOne night, she dreamed that a spirit from the netherworld came to arrest and reprimand her: *\"In your past life, you were the wife of Mu Rong, a neighbor. At thirty, you fell gravely ill and lingered for over a year. Your mother-in-law, then over seventy, cooked porridge for you, but you, finding it bitter, refused to eat and complained of its frequency, scolding and weeping at her several times. On the day before your death, you cried out to Heaven before your mother-in-law: ‘Those over seventy do not die, yet I, at thirty, am made to perish—is Heaven unjust?’ The Director of Destinies reported this to Heaven, and the Emperor decreed that your corpse be burned. But your breath had already ceased, and the sentence was not carried out. The records remain, and after thirty years—a full cycle—your past karma must now be settled. You are fated to die beneath the axe of thunder. Tomorrow, await your fate. Yet because in this life you have been filial, I forewarn you.\"*\n\nYu awoke in terror, sitting up in the dead of night to wail. Her husband, a minor official, was away on business, and her mother-in-law said: *\"You claim my son has ruined your family’s wealth—do you think you can never repay it?\"* Yu replied, *\"No.\"* At dawn, she bathed, put on fresh clothes, and bowed to her mother-in-law: *\"Your daughter-in-law has served you for three years without merit. Today, I ask leave to return home briefly. I fear the unforeseen—if I die, I may not return. Mother, take care.\"* Her mother-in-law, bewildered by her strange words, let her go. Yu bid farewell to her parents, repeating the same words.\n\nStanding by the kitchen incense burner beneath a great tree south of the house, she looked to Heaven and prayed: *\"Your daughter-in-law’s death is the due of past karma—I do not refuse it. Yet I grieve for my poor husband and aged mother-in-law, who in their later years will lose their wife and daughter-in-law—who will care for them? First, this. Second, my parents, who raised and taught me, will be shamed by my execution. Third, I am seven months with child—if by chance it is a boy, the Zhi line will have an heir. Two of these I cannot escape, but for the sake of the Zhi line’s posterity, I beg a three-month reprieve before I die.\"*\n\nIt was the height of summer. Dark clouds blotted out the day, and wind and thunder clashed. The netherworld spirit later told me of this, and knowing her heart, I memorialized the matter. An edict came: *\"Take a wicked and rebellious one from the village to replace her.\"* The wife of the wealthy Zhang Shi, née Ma, was lewd, violent, and defiant, treating her mother- and father-in-law with disrespect and reducing her husband to servitude. I dispatched the netherworld spirit and the Spirit of Thunder and Fire to deal with her. In an instant, Yu was unharmed, while Zhang’s wife was burned to ashes.\n\n**Upholding Righteousness, Fifty-Eight**\nBrothers share one father’s blood—\nHow can kin be heartless?\nLi Hua’s care for Wei is laudable,\nWhile Yong Di’s bullying of Yuan is unjust.\nA broken arm reveals swift retribution,\nPublic praise earns a virtuous name.\nThus do shallow customs grow sincere,\nAnd the geese in formation fly in harmony, free from strife.\n\nIn the town of Shuiyi, the official Yong Di had a younger brother, Yuan, also in office. Though Yuan was often oppressed by Di, he served him as an elder with equanimity. Both had married sisters from the Liang family, and even the slightest household matters became grounds for contention. Over time, Di and Yuan became enemies, their wives bitter foes. Their parents could not restrain them, so they decided to divide the household. Di refused to let Yuan keep his own quarters, forcing him and his wife to leave with nothing, yet still demanding seasonal offerings. Soon after, Di encountered Yuan on the road and, enraged that he did not bow, beat him. Wounded, Yuan sued before the village magistrate, who found Di in the wrong. Di’s wife then stormed to Yuan’s door, dragged out her sister, and beat her, saying: *\"The law upholds elder and younger—one does not strike an elder for the sake of a younger!\"* The village sided against her.\n\nThe Confucian scholar Li Hua’s father, in his later years, had a son by a kitchen maid. On his deathbed, he entrusted the child to Hua, saying: *\"Raise him as your own.\"* Hua wept and replied: *\"Though his mother is lowly, he is of your blood. I will teach and raise him to be worthy, and the ancestral rites will be in order—Heaven is my witness.\"* He named the boy Wei and doted on him. When Wei grew up, he became a renowned scholar, and Hua arranged his marriage. Hua had another son, Mimming, ten years Wei’s senior. From the time Wei could speak, Hua had Mimming bow to him. As they grew, Hua treated Wei with a respect just below that due a father. Hua, his sons, and Wei were all recommended by the villagers to the prefect, then to the capital, where their merits were assessed. The post was awarded to Mimming. When Mimming misspoke to Wei, Hua beat him. Mimming accepted the rebuke, and soon after, Hua gave all his family’s wealth to Wei, saying: *\"My younger brother shall manage it. Mimming will have his official salary for support.\"* The villagers praised his virtue.\n\nDuring the autumn festival, I attended the gathering. The villagers compared Yong and Li as the foul and the fragrant. Hearing this, Di cursed and, sitting down, dragged Yuan over to beat him. Outraged, I ordered the spirits to twist and break his arm. Soon after, Di’s wife developed an abscess on her hand. For three years, their public and private affairs collapsed, their livelihood dwindled, and their parents died in succession. Di and his wife ended as beggars. The villagers saw this as the retribution for unrighteousness. The prefect, hearing of Li Hua’s conduct, honored him as *\"Upholder of Righteousness.\"*\n\n**Honoring the Reclusive, Fifty-Nine**\nWorldly customs most corrupt,\nDaily toil in dust obscures one’s true nature.\nMu Jun, who kept to the Dao, was blessed by Heaven,\nWhile Su Zi, who slighted his body, incurred even ghosts’ wrath.\n\nThe profound words passed down serve as moral standards,\nTemples are built and sacrifices offered with grand splendor.\nScholars of Shu first revered the teachings of the Central Kingdom,\nAnd in a single day, vulgar Confucians transformed into the truly pure.\n\nSince Shu was annexed by Qin, the flourishing culture and teachings of the former kings and the transformative power of the great Dao gradually took root. Yet the simple and honest customs had not been revived, and the clamorous and frivolous thrived. Fearing harm to public morals, I resolved to transform them.\n\nOne day, in Ba Commandery’s Dangqu, the scholar Mou Lin was insatiable in learning and delighted in teaching others. He guarded the Dao with integrity and modesty, seldom leaving his home unless for grave matters. In his daily life, he received visitors but never paid calls himself. Though impoverished, he never uttered a word of complaint. The prefect, Wen Yu, summoned him to serve as an aide, but he declined. The assistant prefect, Yu, went to invite him in person. Their conversation lasted for hours, all on living in accord with the times, adapting to circumstances, nurturing oneself, and withdrawing from the world. Yu wished to convey the prefect’s intent but could not find the words. Finally, he left and reported to Wen Yu, who praised Mou Lin’s integrity.\n\nSu Shanggong had once studied under Mou Lin but did not complete his studies. He opened his doors to disciples, styling himself a master, yet his nature was restless and ambitious. His footsteps never rested, and he sought favors with obsequious flattery. Mou Lin despised this. When someone relayed Mou Lin’s reproach to him, Su Shanggong rushed to his door to argue. Mou Lin, still regarding himself as his former teacher, upheld the duty of a senior and said to him: *\"Life and death are a matter of fate; wealth and honor depend on Heaven.\"* These are the words of Zixia. *\"Seek it through the proper Way, and what you obtain is a matter of fate. Seeking brings no benefit to attainment.\"* These are the words of Ziyu. Your conduct, I truly find shameful.\n\nRelying on his youthful vigor, Su Shanggong struck Mou Lin. I happened to witness this and transformed into a scholar to mediate. Turning to the crowd, I said: *\"Longevity or early death, poverty or success—these are matters of fate, not of human effort. Those who scramble for gain without shame do not understand fate. If fate does not grant it, what use is seeking? Even if one occasionally obtains something through persistent pursuit, to believe that seeking guarantees success is to not understand the Dao. If one neither understands fate nor the Dao, then one’s principles are lost, and from this arise depravity, deceit, and all manner of unrighteousness—disloyalty, unfiliality, and worse. The conduct of these two men is as incompatible as ice and fire, marking the division between the noble and the petty.\"*\n\nThe onlookers gathered in a throng. Someone asked me: *\"Who are you?\"* I replied: *\"I am the one called Zhang Zhongzi.\"* The crowd stared in astonishment, and when they looked again, I had vanished without a trace. From then on, those near and far who heard of this—even men like Su Shanggong—reformed their ways, and a pure and honest custom flourished. The people of Dangqu built a temple for me.\n\n**Upholding Rectitude, Sixty**\nTo scheme for others’ wealth is already improper,\nHow much worse to harbor deceitful intentions.\n\n\"Let a righteous woman’s single plea invoke retribution,\nAnd good folk, their whole household, escape ruin’s snare.\nSuddenly, their bonds fall away from their limbs,\nWhile the cruel and violent are soon torn limb from limb.\nBlessing the good and punishing the wicked—such is Heaven’s principle;\nNot I who receive their offerings repay their private debts.\n\nIn the Northern Capital lived a wealthy household, Zhi Jinli,\nWho, in mid-spring, performed the rites.\nHis entire household grew drunk,\nWhen a bandit named Wang Cai, with three accomplices,\nPlotted to rob them.\nThat night, before the hour had waned, they forced the door open,\nBinding Jinli’s family—nine in all, men and women, free and servile—\nAlong with seven maidservants and concubines.\nOnly Jinli’s wife and two daughters, Rong and her sisters, were left unbound.\nAfter seizing their wealth, the bandits sought to violate them.\nJinli’s wife, trembling with fear, begged for mercy.\nThe younger daughter, Shunhua, aged fifteen,\nClung to her mother with her sister Shunying, weeping.\nAs Cai moved to force himself upon them, Hua cursed him:\n‘Starving thief, you dare violate my home—\nDoes the Divine Lord Zhang not yet know of you?’\n\nAt these words, the household’s Controller of Destinies, Cui Xuan,\nAlong with Zhi’s ancestor, Mi, urgently appealed to me.\nI dispatched the Merit Officer Fu Xing,\nLeading a hundred soldiers of the unseen realm to intervene.\nThe ropes binding Jinli and the others fell away of their own accord,\nAnd all the bandits were seized.\nThe next day, the matter was reported to the village head,\nThen to the commandery—\nAll were executed.\n\n*The Transformations of the Divine Lord of Zitong, Scroll Three* ends here.\n*The Transformations of the Divine Lord of Zitong, Scroll Four* begins.\"\n\n**On Killing Living Beings (Chapter Sixty-One)**\nAll creatures that move and breathe possess fate,\nFearing death and craving life as men do too.\nYet for the taste of marrow, fat, and flesh,\nThey cast them onto cleavers, cauldrons, and flames.\nHeedless of vengeful souls that trail like shadows,\nThey know only the savor that pleases the throat.\nDu Zhang enjoyed the fortune of past lives,\nBut when karmic retribution came, it was not in vain.\n\nIn Qiong there lived Du Zhang, a descendant of King Wang of Shu. Born into wealth and nobility, his parents indulged in feasting and revelry as their custom. Every act of butchery and carving, Zhang performed himself. As he grew, he took charge of the household’s kitchen, never a day passing without his hand wielding the knife. No sooner had the roasted meat left his lips than the chopping block was already in his grasp.\n\nLater, misfortune struck in succession, and his family’s fortunes declined. Left with no means of survival, he became a butcher and executioner to feed himself. The wealth he took from others was called \"life-money,\" exceeding its due. His gluttony grew insatiable, and his voracious appetite bred illness. No sooner was he full than hunger returned, yet his craving for meat remained unchecked. Daily, he fell short of his desires. He cast nets to catch fish, used slings to shoot birds, and whatever flew or ran before him stirred his murderous intent.\n\nIn middle age, he fathered five sons, all born without fingers. Pressed by debt and the burden of \"life-money,\" he could not make ends meet. Desperate and forlorn, he contracted a loathsome disease—his skin split open, oozing pus and blood, so foul that passersby covered their noses.\n\nTormented by hunger’s fire and afflicted by suffering, he threw himself into a well, only to be dragged out and cursed vehemently. Then, gazing heavenward, he cried out in grievance.\n\nI witnessed this and, astonished, questioned Sun Hong, the local domain master, who recounted the details. He added that though Du Zhang’s allotted years had ended, his life still had five years remaining. Knowing the cause of his karmic deeds and pitying the severity of his suffering—yet with many years still ahead—I feared his daily resentment and anger toward the Celestial Emperor. Thus, I dispatched a Merit Officer to alter his heart and will. He was made to peel the scabs from his own sores and eat them, to dip his fingers into pus and blood, sucking and savoring the taste, then declare to others: *\"Do not commit the sin of killing—take me as your warning!\"*\n\nThus, for over a year, he endured until his allotted time was fulfilled. His breath ceased, and all his sons perished as well.\n\n---\n\n**On Cruelty (Chapter Sixty-Two)**\nGongsun Wuzhong governed with integrity,\nYet his floggings of clerks lacked true severity.\nLai En, by grace, released his subordinates,\nBut his rapacity toward the people knew no end.\nA transformed self served as the sole admonition,\nA change to leniency brought dual benefit.\nCurbing excess to supplement deficiency,\nBoth clerks and commoners reaped the blessing.\n\nThe magistrate of Niu Bing County, Gongsun Wuzhong, ruled himself with incorruptibility but treated others without mercy. The slightest fault in his subordinates earned them one or two hundred lashes. After a year in office, not a single clerk remained unscarred, and they resented him bitterly.\n\nThe magistrate of Zi Shui County, Lai En, was by nature greedy and habitually accepted bribes. His daily food and drink, seasonal clothing, and adornments were all supplied by his clerks. When commoners came to his court, regardless of right or wrong, he consigned them to prison, allowing his clerks to extort them at will. Only when his desires were sated would he act; if the clerks remained unsatisfied, he would delay for months or even abandon the case entirely. The people despised him.\n\nI saw the suffering of the clerks and commoners in these two counties and transformed myself into Changsun Yi, the assistant prefect of Shu Commandery. I toured the counties to observe their customs and impeached Wuzhong for his cruelty to clerks and Lai En for his oppression of the people. Both magistrates kowtowed, begging for mercy. I admonished and exhorted them, then vanished without a trace.\n\nLater, they learned that the assistant prefect had never visited the counties. Both counties came to revere me as a divine being, and Wuzhong reformed, governing with loyalty and forbearance, while Lai En also transformed, becoming incorrupt and upright.\n\n---\n\n**On Pitying the World (Chapter Sixty-Three)**\nThe House of Zhou collapsed into inhumanity,\nAs the Ji clan’s rule gave way to Qin’s tyranny.\nHarsh punishments and brutal clerks stifled harmony,\nDeceitful schemes and endless wars—how many springs?\nUnable to bear the Central Plains’ suffering,\nI wished to open my heart to save its people.\nHeaven’s decree granted assent,\nAnd after the storm, the world was renewed.\n\nI once served the Zhou, offering loyalty unto death, and received sacrifices in Shu. Before long, Shu fell to Qin, and soon after, the Zhou lost the realm—all to the House of Ying.\n\nQin relied on harsh laws, treating the people as grass and weeds. When Qin declined, warfare erupted anew, and the Central Plains suffered in devastation for years.\n\nHaving long dwelled in tranquility, I yearned to relieve the people’s suffering. Thus, I submitted a memorial to the Celestial Emperor, who granted my request, saying: *\"The son of the White Emperor has wandered the mortal realm for too long, steeped in slaughter. Now, I have sent the son of the Red Emperor to replace him. You, as the original minister of Fire Virtue, shall now respond to the world as the successor to the Red Emperor’s son.\"* I accepted the mandate.\n\n---\n\n**On Xianyang (Chapter Sixty-Four)**\nFortune favored my protection of all Shu,\nYet worldly ties compelled me to emerge.\nSlander thwarted my succession,\nAnd my death left only enmity.\nA king’s title, thin as fate, brought no gain,\nWhile my mother’s bitter suffering never ceased.\nHow I longed to take the form of a *shuairan*,\nTo devour the Lü clan and end my sorrow!\n\nMy plea to Heaven had been to transform myself and lift the world from its suffering, guiding its people to harmony and joy. Unexpectedly, the Emperor decreed that I should succeed the son of the Red Emperor. The Jade Edict inspired awe, and I dared not refuse. Reflecting in stillness, I knew this was not my desire.\n\nSuddenly, the Great Deity of the Nine Heavens’ Surveillance pressed me to be reborn. From the clouds, I gazed down upon the newly built palaces of Xianyang, where the Fire-Qin’s successor now ruled. The Han Emperor was conversing with Lady Qi Zhao. The surveillance deity urged me: *\"This is the so-called son of the Red Emperor—now the Han Emperor.\"* As I looked on, the deity forced me forward, and I tumbled into Lady Qi’s embrace. In a daze, I awoke.\n\nThe Emperor, seeing my birthmarks and bearing, found me delightful and named me Ruyi. Though still an infant, my original resolve remained firm. My speech and glances pleased the Emperor greatly, and he doted on me, often calling my elder brother unlike him and treating him with disdain. In his later years, he wished to make me his heir, but it did not come to pass. After the Emperor’s death, I was ultimately killed by the Lü clan. My mother’s end was even more cruel, and I harbored deep resentment.\n\nWhen I later saw her suffering in the netherworld, I longed to take the form of a *shuairan* and devour the Lü clan to the last.\n\n**Lake Qiong, Sixty-Fifth**\n\nTo rely on power and bully others is never to be done—\nAn innocent mother and child were put to death.\nThe grievance I bore sank deep into the earth,\nA hatred so profound it could not share the sky.\nThe Lü clan’s later lives dwelt in the same town,\nTheir parents begging for mercy in that very hour.\nThe sea’s waves leveled forty *li* of land,\nRepaying all the hundred sorrows I once endured.\n\nAfter suffering the Lü clan’s calamity, my spirit wandered the netherworld, unbound by any office. I harbored long-held resentment and yearned for vengeance, yet my past deeds of cultivation had faded from concern. Though the Lü clan had died and been confined to the dark realms, their karmic burden ran deep, spanning many years. Even after their rebirths, much time had passed. I sought them along the western sea’s shores, where a town named Qiong lay. Its magistrate, Lü Mou, was the Lü empress’s later incarnation, and many of its people bore the Lü surname—old karmic ties drawing them together, the Lü clan’s accomplices, now gathered in this desolate land.\n\nMy mother, the Lady, was also reborn there, once more as a Qi. Having enjoyed excessive fortune in her past life, she was now poor and emaciated. She married a man named Zhang, old and childless. The couple lived by cutting grass. One day, they spoke to each other in the wilds: *\"Our lives are so straitened, we toil to sustain ourselves. Now, in our twilight years, our strength wanes—we shall surely perish in some ditch. Sixty years old and still without a child—does Heaven mean to destroy us?\"* They cut their arms and let blood drip into a stone’s hollow, covering it with the rock. Kneeling to Heaven, they prayed: *\"All others have children; only we are barren. Our qi and blood are meager, unable to nurture life. If some creature should stir beneath this stone, let it be born of our flesh.\"* I sensed my mother’s earnest longing, and moved by her plea, I took form there.\n\nThe next day, the old couple returned and lifted the stone. The blood had transformed into a golden snake, a hand’s span in length—my doing. My mother took me in and raised me. A year later, horns sprouted from my head, and legs grew beneath my belly. I could change my form at will. Whenever rain threatened, I aided the skies. As I grew, my body expanded, my appetite vast. I devoured sheep, pigs, dogs, and horses on sight. The magistrate owned a fine, swift horse, grazing by the water. Its hoof injured my tail, so I seized and ate it—the horse was Lü Chan’s later incarnation.\n\nThe townsfolk knew of me. They searched my home in vain, then imprisoned my parents, demanding they produce me within three days or face execution. The next day, I transformed into a scholar and petitioned the magistrate for their release. He said: *\"The old Zhangs keep a demonic snake that has long preyed on livestock. Now it has eaten my horse. I will kill it to rid the people of this scourge.\"* When the Zhangs were not heeded, he declared: *\"They have become demons themselves. They must die.\"*\n\nI replied: *\"Life repays life—this is the work of past karma. Their devouring was no accident. If you, as a magistrate, kill humans for the sake of an animal, is this justice?\"* The magistrate shouted for me to withdraw. I pressed on: *\"Your face bears the mark of death. Take care for yourself, lest you regret it later.\"* With that, I vanished. The magistrate’s attendants called me a demon. I then appealed to Heaven, recounting how my mother and I had been wrongly slain by the Lü clan in a past life, and how I had now encountered them again. I vowed to settle the score. My plea ascended, but no reply came.\n\nI summoned wind and thunder, inhaled clouds and mist, turning day to night. The townsfolk stared at one another, saying: *\"Why does your head look like a fish?\"* They touched their faces and wept. That night, I raised the sea’s waters as rain, flooding the town. Forty *li* of land sank. I bore my parents to safety on my back. This occurred in the reign of Emperor Xiaoxuan—what is now called the Sunken River.\n\n**Liberation, Sixty-Sixth**\n\nThe heart’s wrath arises all too easily,\nAnd where it stirs, ignorance takes root.\nOne knows the truth is plain enough to plead,\nYet without waiting for decree, one acts.\nExiled to a massive form, scorched by heat,\nRepaying karmic debts to soothe the wronged.\nA single word from the World-Honored One\nDissolves my lingering karma—my true face restored.\n\nIn my earlier confrontation with the Lü clan, I had petitioned the Emperor but received no reply, so I took matters into my own hands. Though my long-held rage was vented in that moment, when my heart settled and my mind grew calm, deep regret took hold. The next day, a jade decree descended: the Sea God Chao Hong had accused me of misusing the sea’s waters, drowning over five hundred households—more than two thousand lives. Excluding the eighty-odd souls who had been my past-life enemies (half in the city god’s precinct, half in the outskirts), the rest were innocent, cut down before their time. The Emperor commanded that I be demoted to the dragon of Lake Qiong, stripped of my divine office, and placed under celestial overseers. I was forbidden to partake in rainmaking, imprisoned beneath stagnant waters. Years of drought followed, and the water turned to mud. My vast body had no burrow to shelter in. The scorching sun beat down, tormenting me inside and out. From my eighty-four thousand scales, countless tiny worms emerged, gnawing without end. I writhed in agony, losing track of the seasons.\n\nOne morning, as a cool breeze stirred, the sky suddenly parted, revealing five-colored clouds drifting past. Within them appeared an auspicious sign: coiled hair bound in a topknot, a golden countenance like the moon, wondrous and rare, radiant with light. Mountain spirits and river lords, myriad beings bowed in reverence, their voices of praise and joy shaking heaven and earth. Heavenly incense curled through the air, celestial blossoms scattered, and spring bloomed wherever they fell. My ears and eyes grew sharp, my nose keen, my heart clear, my mouth moist, my voice resonant. I lifted my head and wailed, begging for deliverance.\n\nThe host of sacred beings before and behind me spoke: *\"This is the World-Honored One, the Tathāgata Śākyamuni Buddha, the Perfectly Awakened One of the West. His teachings now spread through the Eastern Lands. He takes form to teach and transform, journeying to the Middle Kingdom. Since you have encountered him, your past karma may be dissolved.\"* Stirred by remorse and compassion, I leapt into the divine light and recounted the principles of karmic retribution from my past.\n\nThe World-Honored One replied: *\"Excellent, Prince! In your past, you were filial to your family and loyal to your kingdom, bringing great benefit. Moreover, you pitied the world and nurtured a heart of protection. Yet the cycle of cause and effect was not yet complete—enemies still contended, and through the delusion of self and others, cruelty ran rampant. You vented your wrath upon all things, and the karmic debt must be repaid. Now, having repented and seeking liberation, do you still harbor thoughts of past-life enemies and loved ones? Do anger, ignorance, and delusion linger?\"*\n\nHearing this profound truth, my mind opened like the sky—inner and outer emptied as if into boundless space. Abiding in no-self and no-other, all thoughts ceased. I beheld my form, and with each念, it dissolved. Reborn as a man, I listened as the Buddha expounded the Dharma, receiving the wisdom of abhiṣeka, the eloquence of great discernment, the power of divine transformation, and the perfection of marks. The Eight Divisions of Dragons and Devas rejoiced greatly, and I took refuge in them.\n\n**Virtuous Governance, Sixty-Seventh**\nThe fire of wrath burns deepest, barring harmony—\nhold fast to the armor of patience, let none breach it.\nWounds on your body are wounds on mine;\nanother’s pain cuts as deeply as my own.\nOfficials who deceive will surely fall to corruption,\nwhile people who love one another willingly submit.\nThe clear river’s modest renown flows from this—\nits songs of praise harmonize with the lute of Shun.\n\nHaving escaped the evil destinies, I was at once reborn in goodness, taking form in Zhao as the son of Zhang Yu, named Xun. When grown, I was commended by the Bureau of Merit and appointed Magistrate of Qinghe. Assuming the role with leniency and clarity, none dared deceive me. I treated officials as colleagues and friends, and regarded the people as family. Those among the clerks who erred, I corrected; those who slackened, I encouraged; those who acted rashly, I instructed; those who were greedy, I scrutinized; those who were deceitful, I challenged; and those who ignored edicts, I dismissed.\n\nOnly those who bent the law to harm the people, turning white to black, and whose deeds touched upon human life—I made them argue their own cases. Only when their words were exhausted and their hearts spent did I deliver them to the law. Even then, if their initial circumstances were pitiable, I still granted them leniency. The fines for their transgressions I bore myself, refusing to shirk the burden.\n\nWhen the people disputed wealth, I settled it with righteousness; when they clashed over rites and laws, I enlightened them with compassion. Thieves were made to repay their stolen goods; those who injured others were made to bow in the courtyard before their victims. Those who committed adultery or murder were handed over to the law, yet if their original intent was forgivable, I still released them. Though I endured slander for harboring evil, I did not shrink from it.\n\nThus, within my jurisdiction, rain and sunshine came in due season, locusts and pests did not arise, thieves and bandits warned one another to leave the region, and the wicked reformed their ways. After five years in office, no grievances were heard. The four classes of people composed a song in praise:\n\n*We have a teacher, stern yet not unkind—*\n*who teaches and forgives, Lord Zhang does this.*\n*We have a friend, trustworthy yet not stern—*\n*who draws near and guides us, Lord Zhang we rely on.*\n*We have a mother, whose kindness veils her justice—*\n*Lord Zhang resembles her, tender yet not indulgent.*\n*We have an elder brother, whose reproofs are just—*\n*Lord Zhang resembles him, harmonious yet not contentious.*\n\nLater, I was promoted to Governor, but urged to seek higher office, I resigned my post—this was at the end of Emperor Zhang’s *Yuanhe* reign.\n\n**Hidden and Manifest, Sixty-Eighth**\nDevote yourself wholly to the Dao, and the Dao abides;\nsteadfastly seek benevolence, and benevolence is achieved.\nOnly when the nature is settled can day and night be traversed;\nonly when the spirit is whole can the hidden and manifest be governed.\nLin Zong loved his son, yet upheld public judgment;\nthe Emperor’s decree conveyed words without concealment.\nAfter thirty years of toil, my merits bore fruit—\nno harm in the unseen workings that hasten the birth of drought.\n\nAs my family’s virtuous governance had borne fruit and our blessed karma flourished, my heavenly years having just run their course, I was at once given form again. During Emperor Shun’s *Yonghe* era, I was reborn into this world as the one called Zhang Xiaozhong, still not forgetting my former name. Once more, I was appraised by Guo Youdao. Though I did not rise to high office, drifting among the common folk, the Celestial Emperor issued a decree, bidding me attend to worldly affairs by day and govern the hidden and manifest by night. All the grievances, oppressions, and hidden virtues of people—I knew and recorded them. Even the spirits of the dead and malevolent specters were not beyond my purview. For thirty years thus, I aided both the seen and unseen, benefiting both humans and ghosts—I had rendered service.\n\n**Strategic Planning, Sixty-Ninth**\nMy heart holds both martial and literary grace,\na single inch of mind discerns ten thousand forms.\nWhen the precious mandate turned to the Sima clan,\nI briefly aided General Deng with military counsel.\n\"Deploy the unexpected, inquire of the Dao—execute my plan!\"\nExhausting myself on the battlefield to protect the imperial merit.\nThe historian’s records may omit my deeds,\nyet what harm if my strategies remain unheard?\n\nAs my family’s virtuous deeds accumulated across generations, I gradually regained my divine office. Yet those whose karmic debts to me remained unpaid still did not leave me be. Reborn in Heshuo, I was young and proud in spirit, witnessing the world’s upheavals. Aspiring to merit and fame, I was recognized by Grand General Deng Ai, who summoned me as an aide. In all his strategic undertakings, I was always involved.\n\nIn the year of the campaign against Shu, I served as Deng Ai’s Field Marshal. I urged him to take a secret route and strike unexpectedly, sparing the carnage of arrows and blades. Penetrating deep into Shu’s territory, we encountered Zhuge Zhan. I offered him the kingship of Langye, but he refused to listen. When battle was joined, it was I who faced Zhuge Zhan’s vanguard. A stray arrow, swift as a shooting star, struck my body. As Zhan was about to be captured, I wished to rescue him, but my wounds were too severe. This was the retribution for the unpaid debt from the former life at Kouchi—how could I not take heed?\n\n**Ruyi, Seventieth**\nIn what year did the Emperor’s hand first wield it?\nOne day, the Jade Capital bestowed it upon the terrace.\nDirecting the ranks, the hidden troops emerge;\nbeckoning the foe, their malevolent intent shifts.\nA companion of sharp instruments in ordinary times,\nits old name is sometimes still called.\nFrom now on, wherever it points, all is as wished—\nwhat spirit in the Three Realms dares deceive?\n\nHaving fulfilled my past karma, I was summoned to the Jade Capital, where my name was cleansed from the register of evil and my divine rank renewed. Entrusted with eternal blessings for the earthly realm, the Emperor then bestowed upon me the staff he wielded. His decree proclaimed: *\"Rely on you, Xiaozhong, hero of the myriad spirits, whose loyalty and filial piety are complete, whose merits serve the world. Examine this staff—nothing is beyond its reach.\"*\n\nHe added: *\"This is the* ruyi*. By this staff, your past name is fulfilled.\"* I joyfully received it.\n\n**Dingwei, Seventy-First**\n\nBeyond the five borders of Yue-Shang lies Jinshan Town,\nnear the southern edge of Yue-Xi, close to the sea’s verge.\nSober eyes wake to behold new sun and moon,\na leisureed heart loves the old mists and clouds.\n\nThe primal hour governs life, fixed to *dingwei*,\nthe Zhao house’s revival shines on its old lineage.\nA thousand myriad years the Fire Virtue aids the king—\nonly from this day is its glory duly honored.\n\nWith the precious staff ever at my side, no path is barred.\nRecalling my past life at the western sea’s corner,\nI passed through again—\nwest of Yue-Shang, south of Yue-Xi,\nbetween the two Yue lands stands Golden Horse Mountain,\na realm of surpassing purity.\nZhang the Elder and his wife,\nmy parents through many lives,\nwere there when I was born.\n\nIt was the eighth year of Emperor Wu of Jin’s *Taikang* reign,\nthe year *dingwei*, the third day of the second month,\nthe midnight hour.\nBy *jiazi* reckoning, the time had already turned to *xinhai*.\nThe Emperor decreed me *Dingwei* Yang Official,\nprimal hour of my destined life.\n\n**Shui Cao, Seventy-Second**\nIn dreams, a dragon or an emperor-king—\nthe habits of many lives not yet forgotten.\n\nI mock their wine and feasts for wanton rites,\nyet inscribe my office’s rank in the watery realm.\nAmid the roar of wind and rain, I rush to guard the child;\nbeneath the mulberry’s shade, the *Shangyang* dances.\n\nMy charge spans all Shu’s affairs of dark and light—\nseven turns of the road to my new post.\nI grew to manhood with wife and sons, yet filial piety never waned.\nSeeing villagers pray for rain before wooden idols, I laughed—\nfor I had once dreamed of such a report.\n\nOne day, by the water’s edge, I wrote my official title in a missive to the Sea God.\nThen a messenger came to me, saying:\n“Since taking form in the Zhou, you have been reborn seventy-three times,\nand now your transformations are manifest.”\nHe called me *Yunpan*, urging me to mount a white donkey.\nAmid the roar of wind and rain, my homeland vanished in an instant.\nI entered a vast cavern, its halls bright and spacious,\nwhere my parents and kin all gathered.\nThat very night, a great rain fell across all Shu—\nfor I had been decreed to oversee its affairs of dark and light.\n\n**Osmanthus Register, Seventy-Third**\nThe Confucian *Osmanthus Register* belongs to Heaven’s Bureau—\nfortune and ruin, glory and decay: none escape its reckoning.\nDreams align with sincerity, and meaning shines forth;\nnames rise high on the board through hidden virtue.\n\nA wife ennobled, sons sheltered—from humble roots they rise;\npurple robes and golden belts follow the white-robed scholar.\nTo those who toil through sleepless nights at difficult windows,\nI say: strive in learning and conduct, spare no labor.\n\nThe Emperor, knowing my many lives as a scholar,\ndevoted to the classics, commanded me to oversee\nthe *Osmanthus Register* of Heaven’s Bureau.\nAll matters of local recommendation, village selection,\ngrand examinations, official robes, salaries, posthumous honors,\nand even the rise and fall of the two ministries—\nall fell under my purview.\n\n**Filial and Incorrupt, Seventy-Fourth**\nDiscoursing on classics, debating kings—distinctions drawn,\nthe *Filial and Incorrupt* revive an ancient legacy.\nThe jade seal of Jiangning was Heaven’s mandate;\nthe double sun’s radiance proclaimed imperial merit.\n\nThe horse’s transformation foretold Jin’s rise,\nyet who would call the frog’s vessel Liu Cong’s?\nRiding a donkey, I entered the land of Western Liang,\nplayfully manifesting the six supernatural powers.\n\nI admired the Buddha’s hidden light and meditative stillness.\nDuring the *Jianxing* era, grieving that the barbarians coveted the court’s authority—\nonly a hero of the age could restore order—\nI saw Emperor Yuan’s strategy to cross south and pacify Jiangdong.\nThe white unicorn and jade seal appeared in Jiangning,\nand in Lin’an, the sun bore a double halo—\nall omens of revival.\nI changed my guise to a scholar, mounted a white donkey,\nand journeyed to Hexi to answer the *Filial and Incorrupt* summons,\npaying homage to Zhang Gui.\n\n**Moved by the Times, Seventy-Fifth**\nI prepared to join the local scholars in presenting my talents,\ndelighted to meet Yao Chang—unmatched even in ancient times.\nTo stir the stagnant tide, I wielded sole command;\nhow dare I shirk loyalty’s duty, entrusting it to others?\n\nUnfit to scheme with the three cunning ministers,\nI laughed at grand designs, answering a single call.\nWhen my purpose was fulfilled, I returned early to Shu,\nmy light carriage turning aside to visit my humble abode.\n\nIn the final years of *Jianxing*, I became the scholar Xie Ai,\nriding a donkey into Western Liang.\nZhang Gui appointed me as his secretary;\nwhen Zhang Chonghua succeeded him,\nShi Jilong sent his general Ma Qiu to invade relentlessly,\nshaking Liangzhou.\nThe prefectural marshal Zhang Dan said to Chonghua:\n“Those who recommend generals all favor the long-serving,\nyet Han Xin and Rang Ju were not old hands.\nIn your lordship’s judgment, only talent matters.\nSecretary Xie Ai is both civil and martial—\nentrust him with sole command of the campaign.”\n\nChonghua summoned Ai to ask his strategy.\nAi replied: “Geng Yan did not leave the enemy to his lord and father;\nHuang Quan wished to face the foe with ten thousand men.\nGrant me a few thousand soldiers, and I will devour them for Your Highness.”\nChonghua was overjoyed and gave Ai thirty thousand infantry and cavalry to attack.\nMa Qiu led his forces to resist.\nAi rode in a light carriage, wearing a white headscarf, beating drums as he advanced.\nQiu, enraged, said: “Ai is a young scholar in such attire—he belittles me!”\nHe ordered three thousand *Black-Spear Dragon-Soarers* to charge.\nHis officers panicked and urged Ai to retreat, but he refused.\nDismounting, he sat on a camp stool, directing the battle.\nThe enemy, fearing an ambush, dared not advance.\nQiu’s army withdrew, and Ai pursued, capturing and slaying many.\nQiu fled alone in the night.\n\nWhen Jilong heard of this, he sighed:\n“I subdued the Nine Provinces with a single army,\nyet now the Nine Provinces’ strength is thwarted by Chonghua—\ntruly, the tide has turned.”\n\nLater, I traveled to Guanzhong to befriend Yao Chang,\nhoping to stir the stagnant tide and rectify customs.\nBut tyrannical rulers rose in succession, usurping and murdering.\nThough Chang was young, he was full of schemes—\nand we had a bond from past lives, so I became his close friend.\n\nAfter some time, weary of the mortal world, I longed for Shu’s peaks.\nI made a pact with Chang: “If either attains wealth and rank, do not forget the other.”\nLater, Chang was sent to Shu as a general.\nAt Fengshan, he visited me, and I received him with courtesy,\nlending him an iron *ruyi*.\nI instructed him: “Wave it to summon troops.”\nChang doubted me, so I waved it once—\nbanners blotted out the sky, and ten thousand armored soldiers\nwith spears and shields lined the plain.\nThis is the present-day *Trial Troops Slope*.\nLater, when Fu Jian died, Chang proclaimed himself emperor of Qin.\n\n**Punishing the Wicked, Seventy-Sixth**\nThe pivot of fortune lies in man—\nonly the timing of retribution differs: present or past.\nGreed, corruption, bribes—defying the sovereign’s decree;\nsqueezing the people’s marrow, oppressing the lowly.\n\nWang Zai, who amassed wealth, grew an ox’s tail;\nMa E, who skimmed coins, turned into a pig.\nLet this serve as warning—\na single flawed thought invites divine judgment.\n\nAfter serving Jin, I oversaw both the seen and unseen.\nIn Shu, there was a certain Wang Zai of Daojiang.\nDuring the *Yonghe* era, as a staff officer, he was ordered\nto supervise salt production in Tongchuan.\nHe personally visited the wells, coercing the people into agreements,\ndoubling their quotas: those who owed five thousand catties\nwere forced to deliver ten thousand.\nHe also decreed that if next year’s output fell short,\ntheir families would be seized.\nKnowing they could not meet the terms, he schemed to enslave them,\nmaking the officials do the boiling.\nAfter reporting back, his superior rejoiced at the doubled salt yield.\n\nHearing of their suffering, I secretly soothed the people. That very night, Commander Feng Qian dreamed of Wang Zai coming to pay his respects—yet beneath his official robes trailed an ox’s tail. Startled awake, he found a maidservant also in the grip of a nightmare. When she came to, she recounted how Wang’s messenger had appeared to her, an ox’s tail protruding from beneath his robes. Again and again, she spoke of his oppressive extortion and corrupt greed, declaring that he was now reborn in the fields of a Shu district, in the household of a farmer named Tian.\n\nThe next day, Feng sent men to investigate, and all was just as the dream had foretold.\n\nThere was also Ma E of Yichang, another of the commander’s subordinates. Whenever he was dispatched to the prefectures to oversee tax collection, he prized only the quantity extracted, never questioning whether the quotas were excessive or the circumstances lean or prosperous. He demanded strict adherence to deadlines and took pride in his ruthlessness. The people of Shu suffered under his cruelty and called him “Ma the Scraper.”\n\nWhen someone warned him with Wang’s ox-tail omen, Ma replied, “Even if I were to grow a tail in this life, why should I care?”\n\nHearing of such tyranny, I reported it to the Celestial Court. Soon after, Ma fell ill and died. Within seven days, as his family prepared the post-burial offerings, they heard sounds from within the coffin. Thinking he might have revived, they hastily opened it—only to find he had transformed into a pig. They quickly sealed the coffin and buried him.\n\nThat day, the sky was clear and bright as the funeral procession set out, but suddenly a torrential rain poured down, forcing the mourners to halt. By the time they reached the gravesite, the water had risen to their necks. Let this serve as a warning to all corrupt officials.\n\n**Passing the Examinations, No. 77**\nIn Tongchuan, I long immersed myself in milfoil divination,\nwhile the Daoist teachings and Confucian orthodoxy sank into obscurity.\n\nHeaven lent Fan Zhongyan to revive the golden chime,\nhis prose rivaled Confucius’, restoring the resounding metal.\nThe Confucian ethos sought to bind the transformative virtue of Yao and Shun,\nwhile the grand elegance wholly rejected the lewd tunes of Zheng and Wei.\nDong was nearly a disciple of Yan Hui,\nascending the hall to glimpse the depths of the inner chamber.\n\nLong dwelling beneath the vault of heaven, I saw the Dao in the Central Kingdom decline. The Emperor, desiring to restore royal transformation, renewed the ancient mandate. Born into a Tongchuan family, I knew the Sui dynasty’s fate neared its end, and our Way remained unfulfilled. Retreating to the lands between the Fen and Yellow Rivers, I cultivated the legacy of the former kings—composing rites to temper the passions, crafting music to harmonize customs, expanding penal governance to curb transgressions, and exalting sacrifices to invoke blessings. Following the footsteps of Zhou and Confucius, modeling myself after Mengzi and Yang Xiong, I completed the *Canon* in nine years. Of the Five Constants’ teachings, what could I impart to the young? I entrusted the study of rites and music to Dong Chang, lamenting that his talents were never employed in the court of Emperor Taizong. Alas!\n\n**Protecting the Sage, No. 78**\nThe war drums of Youzhou struck Chang’an,\non that day, Minghuang fled to Sword Pass.\nHad he heeded Jiuling’s earnest remonstrance,\nhow need he toil up the Seven Bends again?\nWere it not for a scholar’s audience,\nhow could the imperial carriage return from afar?\nAt the Bridge of Ten Thousand Li, he welcomed the imperial procession—\nwho knew the Purple Empyrean’s throne stood vacant?\n\nSince transmitting the Dao in Fenyang, weary of life and death, I received the Emperor’s command to assist the Tang house. Thus, I bade my eldest son, Yuanshi, be born into the Qinghe Li family—he was Jiuling. In Minghuang’s reign, Li Linfu slandered the Su clan, yet the Emperor relied on them unshaken. When debates flourished, Jiuling first ascended the Seven Treasures Mountain, seated among literary champions and masters of extemporaneous eloquence. Later, during the Youzhou rebellion, Minghuang fled to Shu, carving through Sword Ridge to gaze upon the Central Plains, sighing: *“Had I listened to Jiuling, I would not have come to this.”* I then arrived at the Bridge of Ten Thousand Li and sought an audience as a scholar. The Emperor asked: *“Are you not Zhang of Beiguo?”* I replied: *“Yes. I hear Yuan Zai and Kong have ascended to heaven, leaving the throne vacant for Your Majesty.”* The Emperor fell silent. After Suzong reclaimed the capital, Wei Jiansu welcomed the Emperor’s return to the palace. He enfeoffed me as Right Chancellor, but I secretly escorted the imperial carriage to Xianyang. The Emperor moved to the Great Inner Palace to convalesce, then ceased eating. Zhang the Empress offered cherry and sugarcane juice, but he consumed none. Often, he played a purple jade flute, blowing a few notes—whereupon a pair of cranes descended and circled the courtyard. The Emperor told his beloved attendants: *“I follow the Heavenly Emperor’s command to dwell in the realm where Yuan Zai and Kong ascended. Prepare my bath.”* He then retired to bed and ascended in transformation.\n\n**Manifesting Might, No. 79**\nLuminous echoes, their principles traceable—\nhow could past heavens ever trespass upon the realm of things?\n\nThe eye’s root clings to nothing but form,\nthe body’s deeds dwell mostly in lust.\nFour times raised yet untouched by the Son of Heaven’s bounty,\na lifetime vainly betraying the heart of a top-ranked scholar.\n\nLi Deng’s arrogance ended in expulsion from the rolls—\nhis karmic retribution drew only sighs for sins deeply engraved.\nLi Deng of the Tang, at eighteen, led his prefectural examination,\nyet thereafter, for ten years at a stretch, he was repeatedly recommended,\nhis reputation ever declining. Nearing fifty, he still had not passed.\nOne day, he fasted and purified himself before Master Ye Jing,\nand said: “Since my eighteenth year, I have presumptuously led the prefectural recommendations,\nyet after four attempts, I have not once passed the imperial examination.\nWhat sin have I committed to deserve this?\nI beg you, Master, to descend into the underworld on my behalf\nand investigate my fate in this life.”\n\nThe Master replied: “In Shu’s Zitong,\nthere is a deity named Beiguo Sheng,\nwho oversees the Bureau of Literary Flourishing and controls the offices of recommendation and official rank.\nHe will surely know. I shall inquire for you.”\nOne day, the Master submitted a memorial to the Dao,\npassing through the administrative seat to call upon me.\nHe said: “The scholar Li Deng, on such-and-such a year, month, day, and hour,\nhas failed four times to pass the examination.\nWhat is this man’s true condition?”\nI ordered an official to present the register, who replied:\n“At Li Deng’s birth, a jade seal was bestowed upon him.\nAt eighteen, he was to lead the prefectural recommendations;\nat nineteen, to become top-ranked scholar;\nat fifty-three, to rise to Left Chancellor.\nYet after his first success,\nhe spied upon his neighbor’s daughter, Zhang Yannian.\nThough the affair came to naught,\nhe struck her father, Zhang Cheng, and cast him into prison.\nFor this crime, his advancement was delayed ten years,\nand he was demoted to the second rank.\nAfter his twenty-eighth year,\nhe encroached upon his elder brother Li Feng’s estate and seized it,\nleading to legal punishment.\nFor this, his advancement was again delayed ten years,\nand he was demoted to the third rank.\nAfter his thirty-eighth year,\nfollowing another success,\nhe debauched a virtuous woman, Madam Zheng, in a Chang’an lodging,\nand framed her husband, Bai Yuan, for a crime.\nHis advancement was delayed another ten years,\nand he was demoted to the fourth rank.\nAfter his forty-eighth year,\nfollowing yet another success,\nhe abducted his neighbor Wang Ji’s daughter, Qingniang,\nand persisted in evil without repentance.\nHis name has now been stricken from the rolls,\nand he shall never pass in this life.”\nThe Master took his leave and relayed this to Li Deng.\nDeng had no reply. One night, he died of shame and remorse.\nLet later scholars and gentlemen take heed!\n\n**Deliverance and Favor, No. 80**\nThe Tang’s long destiny teetered on the brink of collapse,\nrebellion and treachery eroded the northern terrace.\nCoerced, the imperial carriage fled to the wilds,\narmored hosts churned the dust in frantic pursuit.\nHeaven’s grace shone forth, spirits converged,\nthe Emperor’s Dao reasserted, rain and dew descended anew.\nAt Jubai Ford, a fresh edict was to be answered—\nwho would have believed the dragon’s blade could serve as a worthy matchmaker?\n\nDuring the *Qianfu* era of the Tang, famine struck,\nand bandits swarmed the Central Plains.\nShang Junzhang was executed,\nand his followers, led by Shang Rang, rallied behind Huang Chao to rebel.\nThey surged through Jiangling, crossed the Yangtze, and wrought havoc,\nthen swept into Hebei, attacking dozens of commanderies in Henan.\nThey seized Luoyang, breached Tong Pass,\nand Emperor Xizong fled into Shu.\nChao stormed the capital,\nwhile his generals, including Zhu Wen, attacked Fengxiang.\nAt Tong Pass, they pursued Xizong,\nwho fled Fengxiang by night.\nI, clad in scholar’s robes, met the Emperor.\nAs he rode swiftly through the night,\nI offered him my own mount, which he took,\nwhile I grasped the stirrup and steadied the horse.\nSecretly, I wove a canopy of colored clouds,\nshielding the Emperor as he soared into the sky.\nWhen the dawn clouds began to part,\nI bade him look down.\nHe saw the armies of Fengxiang and Chao’s forces\nbattling at Longhu Slope—like ants in formation.\nThe Emperor asked: “Where is this?”\nI replied: “This is the realm between heaven and earth.”\nStartled, he exclaimed: “Are you not Beiguo Sheng, Zhang Xiaoyou?\nHad it not been for you, how could I have survived?”\nI escorted the Emperor back to the Shu road.\nExhausted, he wished to rest briefly,\nand bade me let him use my thigh as a pillow.\nAs he slept soundly, the rustling of leaves in the wind\nsuddenly made him bolt upright, crying:\n“The rebel troops are upon us! The war drums are near!”\nI said: “No, it is only the sound of leaves in the wind.”\nAfter some time, the imperial guard caught up,\nastonished at the Emperor’s swift passage.\n\nThe Emperor arrived at Jubai Ford and said: “I have a daughter, the Princess of Rising Tang, most divinely wise. Might I offer her to you in marriage?” I replied: “Your servant is but a recluse—how dare I accept such an honor?” The Emperor said: “Do not refuse so firmly.” Thereupon he enfeoffed me as King Shunji, came in person to the temple to offer sacrifice, and unbuckled his sword as a gift. He entrusted me with the task of suppressing the rebels. Later, Song Wentong and others slew Huang Chao and sent his head to Chengdu. When the Emperor returned to the capital, the Princess of Rising Tang had already passed away. I ordered troops to escort her remains back to Qiqu.\n\n**Eightieth: The Way of Salvation Obscured**\nThe world’s principles decline, salvation’s path grows strange,\nSpirits and mortals mingle, transforming into dust.\nThe foolish call me delusion, the blind debate my right and wrong.\nChaotic clouds blanket the earth, heavy rains flood the land,\nWhile flames stretch across the sky, blazing with radiant light.\nOnly then did Sun Qiao begin to believe in divine might—\nFrom this moment, my blessings and power manifest throughout the realm.\n\nDuring the Five Dynasties, a scholar named Sun Qiao, upright and unyielding, shunned company and reviled Buddhism and Daoism. He wrote *On the Nonexistence of Ghosts*. Traveling from Long to Shu, he passed beneath my shrine, insulting it with utmost disrespect before departing. Upon reaching the mountain’s shade, the sky suddenly darkened, and wind and rain lashed like scattered arrows. No traveler could advance, nor could they find shelter. He cried out: “If this is indeed Zhang Jun, the Recluse of Beiguo, and if you possess any power, show me the way!” I commanded my divine attendants to display a few torches. Sun Qiao laughed: “A temple slave deceives me!” He called again: “If you are truly a spirit, why not halt the wind and rain so I may reach level ground?” I smiled and said: “You have mocked every shrine you passed, calling them false and laughing at their claims. Now, what use is regret?” I revealed hundreds of torches, illuminating the mountains and rivers so his retinue could proceed. In an instant, the wind and rain ceased. The next day, he left a record at the temple.\n\n**Eighty-Second: Loyalty Manifest**\nThe flourishing celestial mandate blessed the imperial court,\nYet rebellious Qiang tribes and Shu demons stirred chaos.\nTheir clamorous followers overran prefectures and counties,\nWhile bandits and rogues wove webs of sedition.\nSuddenly, brave warriors cried out, summoning the power of hidden troops—\nArrows pierced flesh and bone, yet their spirits soared.\nLike wooden horses drenched in sweat, swift reports arrived,\nAnd heavenly grace descended, covering the outskirts of the capital.\n\nDuring the rebellion of Wang Jun and Li Shun, the commander Lei Shouzhong prayed for my aid with divine soldiers. I entered Shu and reached Lizhou, where the rebels had fortified their ramparts. Vice-General Wang Ji shouted to the enemy: “I am commanded by heaven to suppress you—surrender!” The rebels shot him with a powerful crossbow, piercing his abdomen. Yet he cheered as if unharmed, and when medicine was applied, he suffered no ill effects. The commander fared likewise. The court enfeoffed me as King Yingxian, and upon reporting my deeds to heaven, I was confirmed as King Dinghui of Perfect Wisdom.\n\n**Eighty-Third: Sagely Governance**\nThe peace of Tang and Yu’s virtuous rule perfumed the age,\nIts governance fragrant as the Great Beginning’s dawn.\nThe Four Barbarians submitted to the radiance of virtue’s teaching,\nWhile the people rested secure under laws and models.\nMinisters of talent, their collars aligned, knew the wise,\nAnd great scholars, untangling knotted roots, displayed their learning.\nMy son aided in perfecting the governance of Yuan You,\nAnd his writings served as mirrors for the realm.\n\nDuring the reigns of the First Ancestor and Four Emperors of the imperial dynasty, the realm enjoyed profound peace. I received a divine decree: my second son, born to the Sima family and named Guang, served with utmost sincerity in the academy. He compiled histories of all ages to serve as lessons for the world. He assisted the Empress Dowager Xuanren Shenglie, who, though she never left the palace curtains, governed the realm. All affairs were well-ordered, and all praised her virtue as vast as heaven and earth, her Dao as penetrating as the divine. Through accumulated kindness and piled-up virtue, she approached the glory of the Zhou and Shao ministers.\n\n**Eighty-Fourth: Displaying Loyalty**\nThe Founding Ancestor’s establishment was wondrous as a god,\nWhile I, lacking his virtue, spared the realm from war.\nThe sacred halls of Lantian once preserved the jade,\nAnd the western shrines of Fen and Jin bound their cords in reverence.\nThe Khitan at Chanyuan were pacified by the might of the caitiff-slayer,\nAnd the True Emperor’s eastern works laid the foundation of blessings.\nNow, long estranged from the world, I laugh and point to Zhuya—\nAnother expedition awaits.\n\nDue to the world’s shifting tides, I dwelled in seclusion for a long time. Yet at the founding of the imperial dynasty, a figure arose—none other than Kou Zhun. Later, during the Chanyuan campaign, he established the merit of the Benevolent Ancestor, and I played my part. But then, they accused me of falsehood and banished me across the sea to Zhuya. Alas!\n\n**Eighty-Fifth: Flourishing the State**\nThe court’s decline and prosperity grieve the heart,\nYet its deeds, clear as carved jade, may still be traced.\n\n**Eighty-Sixth: Knowing Restraint**\nThe governance at Pingjiang upheld the great treasure,\nYet troops faltered in Shaanxi’s west—such was Heaven’s will.\nBy timely decree, the Two Shu were stilled,\nAnd grace flowed deep through the Three Gorges’ currents.\nTo recognize this divine marvel:\nWithin the coffin, his body remained whole, untouched by earth.\n\nIn the *dingsi* year of Shaosheng, I entrusted my transformation to Zhang Jun,\nWho stood as a paragon for the age.\nAt Pingjiang, the restoration was achieved,\nAnd the Sagely Son of Heaven reigned for over forty years.\nYet at Fuping’s defeat, the fault was not Jun’s—\nIt was Heaven’s design.\n\nIn the *jiashen* year of Longxing, Jun died and was buried in Hengyang.\nHis son Shao wished to rebury him in Shu.\nWhen the coffin was opened, his majestic countenance remained as in life.\nThe gentry of the prefecture gathered like a wall,\nMany pressing their hands to their brows in awe.\nThus, they sealed the coffin again.\nHad this not been my divine transformation, how could such a thing occur?\n\nI once wielded the Son of Heaven’s authority in Shu,\nHolding the mandate of Wenchang’s office in Heaven.\nMy merits were not unworthy.\n\n**Eighty-Sixth: Knowing Restraint (continued)**\nThe Jade Register bestowed praise, its radiant favor gleaming,\nExalting the master’s transmission as the primal guiding principle.\nAccumulated merit delights in cultivating Heaven’s longevity,\nWhile bearing the mandate, how could one refuse to uphold the imperial decree?\nIn governance, diligence alone abides in the Supreme Ultimate,\nAnd recommending the worthy is the duty of Wenchang’s lord.\nBestowing upon the people the Five Blessings, hoping for peace and prosperity—\nThis is no mere trifling matter of rain or shine.\n\nIn the Longxing year, I received the Jade Edict, raising my rank:\n*\"Wenchang is the root and origin of teaching and transformation,\nTruly the legacy of the successive sages.\nThe literati are the wellspring of virtue and power,\nAnd should unfold their single-minded loyalty.\nProclaim this to all heavens,\nThat trust may be firmly established among the multitudes.\nNow, the Perfected Lord of Wenchang’s Office of Longevity and Examinations,\nThe Guardian of the People and Junior Tutor,\nThe Spiritually Responsive Emperor Zhang—\nYour virtue blankets the myriad things,\nYour might shapes the four quarters.\nSince your birth, you have manifested through vast kalpas,\nFollowing the ancient Dao in scrutiny of human culture.\nYour illumination rivals the sun and moon,\nYour generation aids Heaven and Earth’s transformation.\nThus, you taught the people to till and nurture,\nAnd in every regulation, you excelled.\nYou cultivated ritual and music, bringing governance to harmony.\nYour plans were never amiss,\nAnd weapons were laid to rest.\nYin and yang remained balanced,\nWater and earth were pacified,\nAuspicious omens arrived in due season.\nEntrusted with myriad affairs,\nTested by countless trials,\nYou have always succeeded with distinction,\nEver more capable with each task.\nOnce, as Water Transport Commissioner, you ascended to the Terrace of Balance,\nStill holding the heart to relieve suffering,\nVowing to rescue those in dire straits.\nYour achievements were towering,\nBeyond description.\nSurveying over ninety transformations in your conduct,\nYour deeds were recorded in the registers,\nInscribed in twelve thousand acts of integrity.\nThis is no empty text—\nWhen the realm totters, you uphold it;\nWhen it falters, you steady it.\nEvil is punished, good is encouraged,\nAnd the people truly rely on your blessings.\nMoreover, you have expanded the charts of Longhan,\nElucidated the canons of Luantai,\nAspiring to manifest your transformations by dividing your body,\nLeading the sages in harmonious fusion.\nThe ten thousand Brahma realms unfold,\nAnd the Three Realms share in the benefit.\nIt is fitting to elevate your rank,\nTo accord with the people’s will.\nLet your name ascend to the veneration of the Southern Culmen,\nYour rites surpassing the stellar constellations.\"*\n\nAlas!\nAscending the three ranks below the Great One,\nYour responsiveness to the world has long been manifest.\nGathering the Five Blessings to bestow upon the people,\nWe rely on your words as our guide.\nWho else is capable?\nGo forth and reverently obey:\nYou are hereby specially appointed as the Golden Watchtower’s Supreme Master of the Vast Heaven,\nOverseeing the Three Realms’ weal and woe.\n\nMy memorial in response briefly stated:\n*\"Fearful of overreaching, I have trespassed upon Your luminous wisdom.\nMy humble words, though measured, still seek instruction.\nHow dare I claim incompetence,\nYet still hope for Your assent?\"*\n\nIn my gratitude, I reflected:\n*\"My virtue is meager, my rank exalted,\nMy words light, my conduct scant.\nYet in offering my sincerity,\nI harbor no private thought of retreat.\nIn this flourishing age,\nI have been doubly favored with extraordinary grace.\nShould I not rejoice in such lofty bestowal?\nYet I also fear the calamity of ultimate ruin.\nReverently considering the Heavenly Honored One—\nThe Dao is good at lending and completing,\nIts luminous radiance surely illumines all.\nIt guards against minor flaws and oversights,\nFor the words from within shall be bent toward benevolence.\nWhat objection could there be to this decree?\"*\n\nAfter thrice declining, I accepted,\nAnd was further entrusted with overseeing the weal and woe of the four quarters,\nThus dividing my body to respond to transformations.\n\n**Eighty-Seventh: Admonishing Rebellion**\nSecretly bearing the imperial decree from the azure heavens,\nRevealing to the mortal realm the equal balance of fortune and misfortune.\nHarmonizing the scales with clear discernment,\nRevolving the guiding principles to weave the grand design.\nThe Outer Terrace wields the authority of life and death,\nWhile in Shu, observing customs, it holds the pivot of transformation.\nThe thunder shook the Central River’s Wang son,\nWho split his father’s coffin—all for rebelling against his kin.\n\nI was commanded to assume the office of Master and Chancellor,\nWielding the power over life and death,\nInvestigating good and evil with full discretion.\n\nDuring the Qiandao era, in Shu’s Zhongjiang, there was a man named Wang Qian.\nHis parents had originally purchased a fragrant-wood coffin for their later years,\nBut Wang replaced it with cedar,\nThen sold the cedar to buy a plain wooden coffin.\nWhen his mother died, he kept the plain coffin for himself,\nPurchasing only a pine coffin for her burial.\nWithin ten days, I struck Wang dead with lightning,\nPlanting his body upside down.\nWhen word reached his son, he rushed to weep and right the corpse,\nBut at high noon, thunder suddenly seized the son,\nHurling him five *li* away.\nUpon his return, he found his father’s body once more inverted.\nAfter two burials, both were struck out of the earth.\nThus, he split a hole in the coffin and covered it with bamboo,\nOnly then escaping the thunder’s wrath.\n\n**Eighty-Eighth: Warning Against Deceit**\nFor men, nothing is more ruinous than greed and violence—\nThe reckoning of fate’s calculations is clear.\nYang Zhen’s \"Four Knowings\" could not be concealed,\nZiwen’s thrice-resigned office showed even firmer resolve.\nIf you harbor ill intent, do not think there is no retribution in the unseen,\nFor dereliction of duty will surely shorten your years.\nConsider Xu Qian’s dream-induced revelation—\nGold appeared to block his destined path.\n\nDuring the Qiandao era, Xu Qian, a magistrate of Xindu,\nWas dispatched as an investigating officer.\nPassing through a Xu family’s home to rest for the night,\nThe master of the house dreamed the evening before that a divine messenger said:\n*\"Tomorrow, the Vice Minister Xu will lodge here.\nTreat him well—this envoy is my assistant.\"*\nThat evening, Xu the Vice Director indeed arrived at their door,\nAnd they prepared a lavish reception.\n\nWhen Xu Qian returned, he dreamed again that the divine messenger said: *\"This time, Xu, you accepted five hundred taels of gold and wrongfully took seven lives. The celestial court has already deducted thirty years from your lifespan, and your office will end here.\"* Thereafter, the Xu family no longer received him, and the Vice Director was deeply perplexed. That evening, he sent a servant to recount the dream’s events. Xu Qian’s face flushed with shame. Upon returning to his post and awaiting reassignment, he died in his official residence before the new appointment arrived—at the age of thirty-four. When news of his death first spread, his fellow villagers refused to believe it. But once they learned the full story, none failed to lament his deceitful heart.\n\n**89. Punishment for Impiety**\nA son’s duty demands reverence for both parents—\nNurturing life and honoring death, rites must be observed.\nYet unburied remains lie exposed like transient guests,\nWhile wandering souls drift, their truth still unhidden.\nOther sons may labor in vain at filial deeds,\nFor spring and autumn’s reckonings fall upon the worthy.\nLuo’s dream brought him home to his village,\nOnly then did he grasp how swiftly hidden transgressions hasten one’s end.\n\nIn Dizhou, Luo Gong, a student of the Imperial Academy, passed by my shrine and silently prayed. One night, I appeared to him in a dream and said: *\"You have already incurred the celestial court’s judgment. Hasten home—do not inquire further about your future.\"* Luo pleaded: *\"I have lived with integrity and few faults. I beg to know the reason for my offense.\"* I replied: *\"It is nothing else—only that your parents have long remained unburied.\"* Luo said: *\"I have brothers. Why is the blame placed solely on me?\"* I answered: *\"Because you, as a scholar versed in ritual and propriety, bear the greater responsibility. Your brothers are too ordinary to be held accountable.\"* Luo awoke in remorse, packed his belongings, and returned home. When his classmates asked in astonishment, he recounted the dream—yet he died before reaching his family.\n\n**90. The Hidden Workings of the True and Mysterious**\nThings subtly connect—truths may be known.\nHow often has aiding others invited baseless slander?\nObserving the winds of Long and Shu, the true and tranquil endure,\nWhile in Nanchang, the ledgers of transformation respond to karmic mechanisms.\nBending one’s will to resolve tomb disputes for the people,\nForgetting the self to save the weak and withered—\nFrom this vow, after transforming like Han Yu,\nA deeper mystery of fortune and might is revealed.\n\nIn the *gengxu* year of the Shaoxing era, I traveled in spirit to investigate, descending by planchette to Letong in Fuzhou. There, Han Shen of Longmen sought my talismanic instructions to save his grandson Kunchen from a grave illness. I commanded the Merit-Recording Deity to respond, and the boy revived—all due to Han’s past karmic connections. Thus, I bestowed upon him the registers of the Dao. Thereafter, he was freed from suffering.\n\n**91. Deliverance from Suffering**\nThe bitter sea surges, waves merging with the sky,\nAs life and death unfold according to past causes.\nYet men cling to vain illusions amid empty blossoms,\nUnheeding of withered bones rotting in the grass.\nConfucius mourned the young to establish his teachings,\nWhile King Wen buried unknown remains—how could he know their years?\nThe August Heaven, entrusted with the people’s woes,\nStill harbors compassion, though it seems in vain.\n\nBy the Supreme Emperor’s profound virtue of cherishing life, I was charged with gathering the exposed remains of the dead across the land. The ancient histories record: *\"Even bones of unknown age moved King Wen to bury them. Children banded together to defend Lu, preserving Confucius’ mourning for the young.\"* Yet today, men neglect to bury their own parents—how much less would they feel pity for strangers! Through my labors of deliverance, I ascended to the unshakable realm of Peace and Bliss, playing freely in the samadhi of the Tathagata’s fruition.\n\n**92. Fortune and Retribution in Luzhou**\nMist drifts over the Lu River’s jade-green ripples—\nWho knows when the karma of killing will meet its hour?\nThe mountain monk’s slaughtered body lies in futile rage,\nWhile the mountain spirit’s vengeance lingers, slow to arrive.\nHad he cultivated loyalty and kindness, the Buddha’s samadhi,\nHe would not have met Li Waner’s enmity.\nZhang Xin returned to the hands of Wang Ji—\nThis retribution for that grievance came without delay.\n\nDuring the Shaoxing era, Zhang Xiaofang, the military governor of Luzhou, was plotted against by his soldiers Zhang Xin and others, leading to rebellion. Zhang Xin was later killed by his comrade Zhang Chang, and Luzhou was pacified. This traced back to a monk from Zigui during the Shaosheng era, named Liao Huijue, who lived in a mountain temple with great wealth. He gathered followers to perform a plague-averting Water and Land Ritual. Later, the bandit Li Waner led men to rob him, unaware the monk had set traps around the walls. All were ensnared, save Li Waner and a few others, whom the monk and his disciples slaughtered and ate. Later, Li Waner sought revenge. The mountain spirit said: *\"Your vengeance cannot come yet. This man still has karmic ties to bring blessings to many. Wait one more lifetime.\"* But Li Waner had also killed, and Wang Ji was destined to repay him.\n\nThereafter, the monk Huijue was reborn into the Qinghe Zhang family as Xiaofang. Li Waner became Zhang Xin, and Wang Ji became Zhang Chang. The retribution was manifest. Thus, I was appointed to command the divine guards of Luzhou, and the region was pacified.\n\n**93. Clarity of Vision**\nSince the Great Ultimate first dawned under Fuxi,\nThe spirit’s nature follows the moment like clouds over water.\n\n**94. Manifesting Transformations**\nNine times ten and four revolutions reveal subtle radiance,\nThree thousand lines and more display their faintest gleam.\nTwin Peaks became the site of the first abode,\nSevenfold bends revisited the lodging of Shenxiu’s stars.\nI briefly rode the flying simurgh to make this intent clear,\nIssuing scriptures to instruct and relying on praise to spread the word.\n\nWith true primordial *qi* I pluck suffering from the world;\nBy later Heaven’s mandate I was recommended to the throne of spirits.\nAscending the Golden Gates, I roam at ease in the Purple Void,\nJourneying in spirit to inspect and visit,\nDwelling in the simurgh to manifest transformations,\nTeaching the lessons of Dao, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness,\nTransforming the customs of thievery, pettiness, meanness, and deceit.\n\nSuddenly, the celestial registrar reported that in Yunteng Village of Lechang District in Fuling Prefecture, a man named Yang Si had established a seat for the Star of Literary Glory. I summoned Chongying to descend and bring blessings to the people. Zhu Zhang, moved by the assembly of the perfected, beheld the beauty of the mountains and rivers. There stood Twin Peaks, where the *qi* of the immortal’s cave-dwelling and the grandeur of the cosmos converged. I then became Lord Jun Xuanchu, transforming and establishing a dwelling there, while Han Zhenxun also gladly donated fields.\n\nI then petitioned the Emperor to erect the Luminous Simurgh Platform of Manifest Response, to display the auspicious omens for the Four Peoples. Now the shrine has long been completed, becoming a splendid sight in Lechang. All who offer incense to me share a bond from former lives. Moreover, the world knows my father’s honorific as Lord Jun Xuanchu, and thus should show even greater reverence. Therefore, upon its completion, I inscribe this to show to the scholar-officials of later times.\n\n**94. Honoring the Deceased**\nSince ancient times, mourning has not exceeded three years;\nDying at dusk and born at dawn, one should choose an auspicious day.\nFuneral rites and burials must be completed, the grave-mound raised;\nIn grief and filial piety, one seeks the ox’s peaceful rest.\nWind and thunder stir, sending sweet rains;\nCrops revive, rising again in the great fields.\nBurying the king in his fine tomb, the hardships of repose are done,\nAnd the divine dragon aids in begetting heroic worthies.\n\nLong ago in Shu, I dwelled in truth at Mowei Cave.\nFor three years, drought and locusts plagued the land,\nAnd the city gods of the four borders submitted reports on the same day.\nThe people of Shu, ignorant, left coffins unburied for years,\nExposing their parents’ remains, their blood and corpses polluting the heavens.\nThe Celestial Court grew angry, sealing the dragons in their pools,\nDrought withering the seedlings, the people losing their autumn hopes.\nThey longed for the True Lord’s compassion to revive and save them.\nI transformed into a layman, going door to door to exhort them,\nUrging them to hasten the burial rites.\nThen, with True Lord Qingyuan and True Lord Shehong,\nI issued a summons to the Dragon King of the Nine Rivers to send three days of sweet rain.\nAfterward, the crops revived, and the people rejoiced.\n\nAt that time, the Jade Emperor was enraged,\nFor the Dragon King of the Nine Rivers had acted without authorization in sending rain.\nHe ordered the dragon clan to be pursued and executed.\nI then transformed into a scholar, widely exhorting the Dragon King, his daughters, and all living beings,\nNever ceasing their recitation of the *Yuluo Imperial Edict*,\nCountless times over. Before three days had passed,\nAuspicious winds and propitious *qi* filled the Golden Gates.\nBy imperial decree, the Dragon King’s crime was specially pardoned.\n\nSince then, filial sons and obedient grandsons,\nUpon the death of their parents, dare not leave coffins unburied,\nBut complete the great rites. Thus, serving one’s parents is fulfilled.\nYin and yang harmonize, wind and rain come in their seasons,\nBlessings are bequeathed to descendants,\nOrchids and irises flourish,\nAnd longevity, wealth, and peace prevail.\n\n**95. Releasing Life**\nWet-born, egg-born—all are human,\nOnly through greed and cruelty do they cling to true feelings.\nThe young of the *mingming* cling to their mother’s embrace in spring nurturance,\nThe foolish *chunchun* ride the waves, chasing the currents to life.\nIn the yang seasons, releasing fish extends the span of years;\nFreeing eels in the primordial *qi* blesses the path ahead.\nExhorting one another to release lives,\nThe blessings of fortune cycle through generations in glory.\n\nI reflect that all beings possess Buddha-nature.\nThose who eat beef—above, the Celestial Court has the Star of the Grand Sacrifice;\nBelow, the earth has Mount Tailao,\nBoth dedicated to punishing those who eat beef,\nSubjecting them to ten thousand kalpas of suffering.\nThose who kill cattle face ten thousand kalpas without pardon,\nOften dying from plagues and pestilence.\n\nAs for pigs, sheep, dogs, fowl, fish, and shellfish,\nWet-born, egg-born—all are born of their parents.\nA single thought’s difference gives rise to ten thousand forms.\nIn mid-spring, one must not overturn nests—this is the *Monthly Ordinances’* warning.\n“Do not shoot roosting birds”—this is Confucius’ warning.\n\nFor those who cultivate the Dao and refine truth,\nRich flavors are not enough for the mouth—only the three-inch tongue-root matters.\nHow much better to avoid killing oneself,\nNot instruct others to kill,\nNot witness killing,\nNot rejoice in killing,\nAnd enjoy these five kinds of pure meat?\nThus, one may avoid great transgressions.\nWhy must one be greedy for the pleasures of the mouth and belly?\n\nLong ago, Li Chongyuan loved to eat eels.\nI knew his inclination and, moved by a dream, transformed into an old woman,\nWho told Chongyuan: “In my belly are five thousand children.\nIf I die, they die too.\nIf you spare me, your blessings will be boundless.”\nChongyuan believed and released the eel,\nAnd afterward, he never killed again.\n\nThere was also Yang Xu, a great merchant.\nI knew his fate in detail and transformed into a dream to appear to him:\n“Next year, you will die.\nIf you save one hundred thousand lives, you may extend your lifespan by twelve years.”\nXu said: “If my allotted time has come, how can I save one hundred thousand lives?”\nI said: “You may release fish fry, and there will be proof.”\nXu awoke and wrote notices in the marketplace,\nExhorting one another, sparing no expense,\nRansoming fish eggs and releasing them into the water.\nAfter a month, I appeared to him again in a dream:\n“You have saved one hundred thousand living beings—it is enough.\nYou may extend your lifespan by twelve years.”\nLater, his descendants flourished for generations,\nTruly no deception.\n\n**96. Revival**\n\nAmidst startled strains of immortal music, palace and court tones resound,\nThe Great Dao’s revival follows fragrant footsteps of those before.\nThe Five Thousand Characters of Dao and Virtue dissolve the kalpa’s fate,\nFor a hundred million years, heaven and earth stand firm as metal and boiling water.\n\nThe Millet Palace’s radiant destiny renews its transformative sway,\nSacred petal-scriptures and numinous texts once more flourish.\nThe Orthodox Unity’s mysterious rites shake the seas and lands,\nEternally extending the imperial throne’s boundless longevity.\n\nI roamed and feasted in the Jade Capital, serene and silent in true joy,\nEver mindful that the thirty-sixth Celestial Master of Dragon-Tiger Mountain, heir to the Han,\nHad strayed from the sacred succession.\nThus, I entrusted my form to the lineage of Zongyan,\nAnd indeed received the mysterious grace.\nFor the kalpa’s fate had not yet dissolved,\nThe teaching’s wind faltered and weakened.\nFortunately, the Five Thousand Characters of Dao and Virtue endured in an unbroken line.\nOnce more, a dream revealed the immortal seed,\nAnd I was established as the thirty-seventh generation,\nAlongside my younger brother, receiving the mandate from the former dynasty’s emperor.\nWe were personally anointed with brush and ink,\nCrowned with the master’s title,\nReviving the mysterious transformation,\nGuarding the nation and its people,\nHonoring and blessing Emperor Yao’s ten thousand years of life.\nFrom Yu’s sons to Tang’s descendants,\nWith loyal ministers as pillars,\nWe preserved the kalpa and extended lifespans,\nEnsuring the people’s peace like soaring swans and geese.\nThus, the teachings of Orthodox Unity flourished anew.\n\n**97. Suppressing Locusts**\n\nFollowing the land’s divisions, transforming at the Chu city’s edge,\nPromoting benefit and eliminating harm is the Way’s natural course.\nWhen caterpillars and borers harm the seedlings, farmers cry distress,\nThe phoenix’s mechanism responds, memorials ascend to heaven.\n\nWith solemn thunder and lightning, sincerity is made manifest,\nNo more locusts fill the vast fields.\nDivine transformations shine brightly, never to fade,\nAs people’s responses and events continue this chronicle.\n\nSince assuming governance of Jun Mountain,\nOverseeing Dongting’s waters,\nAnd flourishing transformations at Shu’s gates,\nMy spirit has long journeyed with the phoenix in the world.\nSince the Kaiqing era,\nI have often employed sacrificial and exorcistic methods in Jing and Chu,\nTo redress wrongful harms,\nAnd seek blessings beyond measure.\nYet demonic toxins spread unchecked,\nWhile the true Dao remained unfulfilled.\nI resolved to transform them.\n\nThus, I memorialized the Heavenly Court in person,\nAnd dispatched the monthly phoenix to open transformations in the Moon Gorge.\nI followed the moment’s needs, responding to transformations,\nGranting blessings to heirs in answer to people’s prayers,\nHealing the world with talismans and medicines,\nRevealing the principles of avoiding misfortune and seeking fortune,\nGuiding people in the mechanisms of advance and retreat, survival and demise,\nBroadening the heart of impartial justice,\nSilently dissolving habits of pettiness, deceit, leakage, and negligence.\nRewarding good and punishing excess,\nWishing for fortune and averting misfortune,\nIn the unseen workings and subtle influences,\nResponding aptly to every circumstance,\nSome were transformed merely by hearing the wind.\n\nYet the phoenix’s overseer, Du Nanqiang,\nOften embodied my transformations,\nNaturally manifesting the true and constant in response to the world,\nWithout flaunting or startling the doubtful customs of the age.\nMoreover, due to the demands of temporary lodging and social obligations,\nMuch was lost to record-keeping.\nSix or seven years passed.\n\nIn the Xianchun year of *yichou* (1265),\nLocusts plagued the gorge’s borders,\nFarmers cried distress.\nInvestigations were reported,\nAnd the prefectural governor, Chen Shunwu Yi,\nHastened to the Ju Ying Altar of Collected Perfected,\nPetitioning heaven with memorials,\nPraying for the locust plague’s end.\n\nI then summoned the village communities to inquire,\nAnd learned:\nThe prefecture’s people often gathered at streams and marshes,\nDredging for mussels and snails,\nHunting fish and turtles,\nEven slaughtering frogs and soft-shelled turtles to serve their superiors,\nKilling countless crabs to sate their appetites.\nHundreds of thousands of lives barely sufficed for a single meal,\nTens of millions of spirits were needed for one feast.\nThus, the accumulated lives, lost in the unseen,\nTransformed into qi and gave rise to locusts,\nWhich harmed the rice fields,\nCutting off the people’s sustenance.\nThis was the karmic retribution of lives repaying lives,\nYet people remained unaware.\n\nI therefore admonished and instructed the village communities,\nCommanding them to protect lives within their regions.\nI recorded the prefectural governor’s sincerity for the people,\nDeeply conveying their plea for sustenance,\nAnd memorialized heaven,\nRequesting that the Field Ancestor be ordered to wield the scorching fire,\nTo eliminate the pests of caterpillars and borers.\nI also petitioned to solemnly invoke heaven’s might,\nTo manifest the prefect’s devotion to the phoenix’s transformation.\n\nThe Emperor, moved by my earnest plea,\nGraciously assented.\nThus, dark clouds gathered by day,\nThunder and lightning with wind,\nAnd the locusts were utterly suppressed.\nThe entire prefecture reaped a harvest,\nFarmers rejoiced together,\nAnd officials established a dedicated shrine for me,\nTo display the divine favor.\n\nIn the Xianchun year of *dingmao* (1267),\nSpring drought withheld rain,\nFarming lost its season,\nThe people sighed in distress,\nHouseholds scattered.\nCheng Shuguang, the prefectural vice-magistrate of the gorge,\nAdministered the prefecture in the governor’s absence during his journey to the capital.\nDeeply troubled,\nHe re-established the mysterious merit,\nSacrificing his own salary,\nRepeatedly praying.\nThe gorge’s deities were moved,\nAnd reported to me.\nAs the overseer of the transformation’s domain,\nI could not refuse.\nMoreover, Cheng’s sincerity resonated deeply,\nPenetrating both seen and unseen realms.\nThus, I proclaimed the Nine Heavens’ mandate,\nRescuing the Five Dragons’ waters,\nBestowing rain in due measure.\nWithin days, it was sufficient.\nFrom then on, farming did not fail,\nAnd the people’s livelihoods stabilized.\n\nBy summer and autumn,\nLocusts arose again,\nOccasionally harming the seedlings.\nThis was because,\nThough I had earlier admonished the village communities to protect lives,\nThe gorge’s people remained unaware of the divine transformation.\nThe custom of killing and harming persisted as before,\nResidual calamities lingered,\nAnd perverse qi summoned them anew.\n\nYet Cheng,\nThough he saw and heard nothing,\nGrasped the principle of response to sincerity.\nSecretly memorializing and pledging devotion,\nHe feigned a return to petition me.\nI conveyed his words’ intent,\nRevealing what he had yet to understand,\nRecording his true earnestness,\nAnd submitting a flying memorial to heaven.\nThe night rain brought the Heavenly One’s waters,\nWashing away the unseen spirits’ grievances.\nThe autumn sun blazed by day,\nBanishing the pests’ harm.\n\nThus, moved by people’s responses and events,\nI summoned the phoenix and took up my brush,\nRecording the suppression of locusts,\nWarning those who kill living beings.\nAppended to the transformation’s records,\nDisseminated to propagate the origin,\nTo display the vice-magistrate’s utmost sincerity in aiding transformation,\nTo reverse the qi’s course and ensure a bountiful harvest.\nMay those who hear this take heed.\n\nIn the seventh month of autumn, after the full moon of that year,\nI wrote again at the phoenix altar of my attendant, the rustic Du Nanqiang.\n\n*The Fourth Scroll of the Transformations of the Divine Lord of Zitong Concludes*\n*(Querying the Dao—according to the following text, should be ‘Querying the Dao.’)*",

      "translated_text": "**The Transformative Book of Lord Zitong**\n\n**Title:** *The Transformative Book of Lord Zitong*\n**Author:** Unknown, approximately dated to the Yuan dynasty.\n**Content:** Chronicles the life and miraculous manifestations of Lord Zitong.\n**Volume:** Four.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Pulu* Category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *The Transformative Book of Lord Zitong***\n\nTransformation operates through two principles: the transformation of change and the transformation of instruction. From non-being into being, from past into present, from youth and vigor into old age and death, and from old age and death into infancy—this is the transformation of change. The Three Bonds and Five Constants, right and wrong, good and evil, where the superior influences the inferior and the inferior advises and corrects the superior—this is the transformation of instruction.\n\nNow, the ninety-seven transformations I have descended to enact are as follows:\n\n1. **Primordial Mandate** – to expound the Great Beginning.\n2. **Flowing Form** – to return to the Great Substance.\n3. **Birth of the People** – to illuminate nature and habit.\n4. **Reforming Customs** – to alter barbarian rites.\n5. **Examining Antiquity** – to awaken later generations.\n6. **Upholding the True** – to follow the Dao and its laws.\n7. **Pacifying Kin** – to repay parental toil.\n8. **Hidden Marriage** – to caution against illicit unions.\n9. **Abyssal Stone** – to honor those with descendants.\n10. **Taming the Pheasant** – to manifest sincerity and resonance.\n11. **Reversing the Flow** – to protect ancestral graves.\n12. **Descending Pestilence** – to display the efficacy of registers.\n13. **Love of Life** – to practice the medical arts.\n14. **Celestial Official** – to perfect the medical vocation.\n15. **Recommending the Worthy** – to open the path of public virtue.\n16. **Correcting Wrongs** – to harmonize with sages and worthies.\n17. **Returning in Glory** – to know contentment and restraint.\n18. **Honoring Ancestry** – to cherish one’s roots and branches.\n19. **Returning to Stillness** – to encounter the Buddhist Dharma.\n20. **Mount Jun** – to delight in seclusion and purity.\n21. **Stirred by Life** – to remain unable to forget emotion.\n22. **Honoring Ancestors** – to continue their aspirations.\n23. **Filial Piety and Fraternity** – to restore severed lineages.\n24. **Mian River** – to suppress slander and malice.\n25. **White Colt** – to hope for the retention of the worthy.\n26. **Avenging Enmity** – to forget personal grievances.\n27. **Aiding Orphans** – to uphold fraternal righteousness.\n28. **Compassionate

They also bestowed upon my temple of numinous response the plaque *Shrine of Assisting Literature and Completing Transformation*. As my illustrious titles grow ever more resplendent, my shame deepens. Ever mindful of how to benefit public virtue and assist the governance of the Great Yuan, my deeds are shallow and unworthy of mention. Thus, I humbly compile this record of my true transformations, offering it as the slightest repayment of the imperial grace.",

      "translated_text": "To teach others through the Dao and its works is called *instruction*; to embody it in high station so that its influence stirs below is called *transformation*. The wellspring of transformation lies in its sovereign. By examining the merit or demerit of affairs, one discerns the source of transformation. Once simplicity and purity have declined and the people’s hearts are no longer as of old, even when penal governance reaches its limit, the spirits still transform them.\n\nFor the people of the world, those who violate the net of laws and poison the statutes of the court must receive hidden punishment. From ancient times to the present, this has been as clear as the sun and moon, an unchanging principle. Thus, the governance of officials over the people and the ordering of the world by the gods are one and the same. The essential task lies in clarifying instruction and transformation, guiding the people to turn toward goodness and distance themselves from transgression.\n\nYet how can this be achieved when the paths of the hidden and the manifest differ, and their powers are not the same? Since their voices and traces cannot connect, even with transformative decrees and canonical statutes, how can they be presented to the people? This is why the governance of the unseen realm is especially arduous.\n\nI have long understood this principle, and so I devised a means for gods and humans to commune. Together with the hundred spirits who bear office, I presented this before the Emperor of Heaven, establishing the *Flying Phoenix Method of Expounding Transformation*. Through the descent of the brush into the human realm, I forged a principle linking the hidden and the manifest. By the Emperor’s gracious will, moved by love for the people below, my petition was granted. Thus, in years past, I have already proclaimed the traces of my transformations. Though these deeds may seem self-aggrandizing, they are the true acts of this being. Moreover, the transmission of transformative traces serves to display instruction and clarify the law, subtly guiding people to turn toward goodness and distance themselves from transgression. In refining the people’s hearts, improving customs, and stemming the tide of decline, what else could suffice?\n\nRecently, by the august command of the Supreme Emperor, I was granted twenty-one subordinate bureaus, their duties clearly defined, to govern the world below. One purpose is to assist the Celestial Court in its work of generation and completion; another is to secretly aid the sagely dynasty in its flourishing governance. Overwhelmed by this favor, I dare not slacken or falter, and for years have striven without respite.\n\nMoreover, my *Book of Transformations*, in ninety-seven fascicles, has long circulated among the people. Yet its origins lie in the hands of corrupt scholars, where errors abound—fish mistaken for *lu*, roots for silver, and countless instances of flawed jade mixed with true. Without correction and clarification, people might dismiss it as the fabrications of meddlers who vainly exalt the spirits. Amid such doubts, certain steadfast and upright scholars, after repeatedly collating the northern and southern editions, verified them before the gods. I declared: “The southern edition contains many omissions and distortions, while the northern edition, personally reviewed by me, presents the facts in full detail. I have made corrections to errors dating before the *dingwei* transformation, and revised the chaotic additions made after the *guiji* transformation. I have further appended the transformations of *Su Min*, *Ke Ju*, and others, bringing the total to ninety-nine. For now, I leave the text unfilled, reserving space for future intent, so that those who undertake the final collation may print and circulate it, guiding later generations and dispelling all doubt.”\n\nSome say: “The sages established the spiritual Dao as instruction, and the Nine Classics shine like the sun and moon. Learned and refined gentlemen have never been lacking through the ages, yet even with canonical teachings on transformation, they cannot make every household understand. How then can this modest *Book of Transformations* stand as a pillar in the current?”\n\nAlas! Such critics simply fail to reflect. Where transformation abides, the Dao abides. Let those in office behold the severity of my transformative traces—will they not tremble with awe at the thought of loyalty, integrity, and administrative competence? Let scholars and literati observe the beginning and end of these transformations, knowing the majesty of their oversight—will they not revere and reform? Let farmers, artisans, merchants, and all other walks of life hear of the astonishing events spanning a thousand years: those who deceive in their hearts face heavenly punishment, those whose words bear evil suffer divine retribution, while goodness is rewarded and wickedness is punished—will they not shudder, turn toward goodness, and amend their faults? Let followers of Buddhism and Daoism recognize the clarity of karmic consequences—will they not preserve their hearts and tread the proper path? This is no mere rousing of the dull or emboldening of the timid.\n\nThe vulgar say: “The Master did not speak of the uncanny, force, disorder, or spirits—why then so many spirits?” Such words are not for those who grasp the mean of the age. They cling to the trust of the White Duke. My guiding of people toward the path of self-cultivation, ordering the family, governing the state, and bringing peace to the world is no heterodox art.\n\nThough this transformation may not establish the heart of heaven and earth, secure the mandate of the people, or inaugurate great peace for posterity, those with discernment will not fail to recognize the weight of my intent.\n\nAs for my divine presence in the world, it moves like the sun and moon across the sky. I bestow or withdraw hereditary offices, oversee the literary balance of the world, and encompass all matters, great and small.\n\nAlas! If the returning wind and retreating fire could be enacted in the past, why can the thunderous, swift, and soaring not be realized now? Hear this, people of the world: embody my utmost intent. Establish benevolence and righteousness in the garden of the *Odes* and *Documents*; cultivate loyalty and filial piety in the land of integrity and deference. Together, ascend to benevolence and longevity, and share in the joy of great peace. Otherwise, the execution of heavenly punishment will leave no room for regret.\n\nI, unworthy as I am, bear this heavy charge and fear betraying the imperial favor. Thus, I set this forth in preface.\n\nFormerly, by the Jade Emperor’s decree, I was granted the *Ruyi* Flying Phoenix and its ink traces to traverse between heaven and earth, to save the final kalpa. The task was entrusted to the Lord of Zitong. Now, with over ninety lifetimes of transformation, I command Wu Jian to undertake the rigorous collation of this text, which is now complete. I request permission to inscribe my own postscript.\n\nOver ninety lifetimes, the mechanism of transformation unfolds,\nUpholding life, rescuing suffering, averting disasters and perils.\nAttaining the fruit of the Tathāgata’s *garbha*,\nThe divine script will reemerge to bless another age.\n\nI, Xiao You, and Wu Jian—two lives bound by filial piety and friendship—have now completed this work. Once more, this treasure shall emerge, the *Ruyi* in hand, traversing ten thousand miles. As the ancient saying goes:\n*A thousand measures of gold and horses bear names,*\n*A single cloud rises beneath one’s feet to ascend.*\n*The high terrace of the Three Heavens descends into the earth,*\n*A single branch conveys the message of spring’s spirit.*",

Hidden Marriage (Yōuhūn)**\n\nMarriage has never been a trifling matter—\nthis life’s encounter was fated long before.\nHer spirit waited, her bones unyielding,\nand in a clear dream, she returned—was it chance?\nA son now stands ready to inherit,\nyet her fragrant soul soon sank into the deep springs.\nIn the prime of life, all ties of yin and yang severed,\nthe world declared my bones those of an immortal.\n\nIn my youth, I was lowly,\nnaturally quiet and disinclined to company.\nThough past twenty, I had no household,\nnot merely because no matchmaker came,\nbut because I lacked the heart for it.\nWhen my mother fell ill,\nher regret was not seeing a grandchild,\nand I too bore the weight of unfiliality.\n\nOne evening, I dreamed of walking through woods to a lonely hill,\nwhere a towering tomb stood.\nBeside it was a gate, and within sat a woman in fine array.\nShe turned to me and said, *\"Are you not Zhang Shànxūn?\"*\nStartled that she knew my name,\nI asked how she came to know me.\nShe replied, *\"My home was within crowing distance of yours—\nI am your second elder brother’s wife.\nOnce, my uncle met with your family\nand praised your learning and virtue,\ncalling you a gentleman of old.\nThey discussed betrothing me to you,\nbut my father hesitated, deeming your appearance unremarkable.\nYet my heart had already inclined toward you.\nLater, I was betrothed to Zhōng Ānrú,\na wealthy man’s son, but one without reputation.\nI was ashamed and fell ill, then died.\nThree years have passed, and I came here because of you.\nWhy do you not arrange this for me?\"*\n\nI awoke with a start.\nA month later, I dreamed the same dream.\nOne day, I strolled with my friend Yí Jiāchéng to explore a secluded spot,\nand suddenly found myself in the very place from my dream.\nI told my friend, and we marveled together.\nThen someone from the tomb called out to me as *\"young master\"*—\nit was the woman from my dream.\nYí was in fact the uncle of my brother’s wife.\nHe rushed to inform her parents,\nwho brought the woman home, and we were wed.\n\n**9.

      "translated_text": "Three years later, I suddenly dreamed of the golden image I served, which spoke to me: *\"You have memorized the* Great Cavern Scripture *well, but you have not yet seen the* Great Cavern Registers*. Now I shall bestow them upon you to subdue evil demons—not only to fulfill your original vow, but also to aid Heaven’s transformative work and assist the state in saving the people.\"* From its sleeve, it produced two books. I bowed a hundred times and received them. Upon waking, the books lay before my pillow.\n\nOne was called *The Great Cavern Thread*, the other *The Great Cavern Rites*. As I opened the registers and read, I came upon the line: *\"One myriad of Heaven’s armored soldiers shall be dispatched.\"* Suddenly, wind and thunder darkened the day, and countless figures in golden armor and crimson sashes arrayed themselves before me, bowing to receive their orders. Three held red banners at the forefront, saying to me: *\"We await your commands.\"* I was still in a daze, but I sternly declared: *\"I command you to subdue the plague demons. In this village, a certain household is stricken—go and drive them out!\"*\n\nAt once, one banner-bearer led over a hundred soldiers into the house. In an instant, they dragged out five demonic enforcers: one clad in tiger skin, one crowned with a rooster’s head, one with a human face, one with a crane’s head, and one with a donkey’s head. Their implements were those of water, fire, feathers, hail, axes, and chisels. Enraged, I rebuked them, about to annihilate their forms, when they pleaded: *\"We disciples are born of the year’s cyclical qi, shaped by its seasonal force. We roam in fixed directions and afflict those predestined—those whom dark retribution dooms suffer calamity, and those whose heavenly mandate is severed meet death. We dare not act on our own will. If the True Official grants us clemency, we shall henceforth obey your restraints. Wherever your talismans and registers are present, we will not dare to approach.\"* I then followed the rites to instruct and admonish them before they departed. Thereafter, whenever I heard of plague in the village, I gave the afflicted my talismans and methods, and all were saved.\n\n**XIII. Cherishing Life**\nCold, heat, summer damp—all stem from Heaven’s shifts,\nwhile diet, rest, and labor bring illness to men.\nThe *Yellow Emperor’s Pulse Classic* details mother and child,\nthe *Divine Farmer’s Materia Medica* distinguishes lord and minister.\nMassage, moxibustion, and needles vary by severity,\ntonification and drainage adapt to old and new.\nAs long as the people avoid untimely death,\nmy toil is ungrudging—this heart is true.\n\nI have saved countless lives with the registers’ methods. People from near and far flocked to my door, their numbers beyond count. Those stricken by plague, possessed by malevolent spirits, suffering from malaria or dysentery, haunted by misfortune, struck by ghosts, ensnared by deities, or afflicted by noxious qi—I restored them all to health. Yet their conditions varied: cold or heat in the organs, excess or deficiency, differences in diet, rest, labor, or indolence. Some were harmed by joy, anger, sorrow, or grief within, others by wind, cold, heat, or damp without. These were the teachings of Qibo and Shennong, not the province of Daoist registers.\n\nWhen I could not save a life, I was truly ashamed of my inadequacy. Thus, I studied pulse principles, pondered the nature of medicines, examined the conquests of the Five Phases, and reviewed the techniques of the nine needles. For six years, I toiled tirelessly, mastering their subtleties. From then on, none whose mandate was not yet severed met an untimely end.\n\n**XIV. Heavenly Office**\nA household’s goodness is its own reward,\nyet fame spreads unbidden, resounding far.\nMy name reached the kingdom, my heart unashamed,\nmy place among Heaven’s officials—destined, ordained.\nThe Six Qi harmonized, the realm at peace,\nthe people’s suffering eased, their safety assured.\nIf I fulfilled my duty, what merit was mine?\nIt was the sage rule of lord and minister that wrought this grace.\n\nMy deeds in saving lives reached the sovereign’s ears. While I was still occupied with acupuncture, word spread to the capital, and I was summoned by imperial courier. Having been recommended by the ruler and tested through trials, I was appointed as a physician, charged with the people’s ailments, serving under the Heavenly Office. I accepted this willingly.\n\nI instructed my disciples to diligently practice their craft. This was the reign of King Cheng, when the royal domain flourished, the Six Qi were balanced, and the people rarely suffered from epidemics or infirmities—all due to the sovereign’s virtue, which allowed me to fulfill my duties.\n\n**XV. Recommending the Worthy**\nA man’s goodness is like my own—\nhaving attained, I still think of those who have not.\nGreat wisdom, though hidden, can create wonders,\nwhile wondrous prescriptions cure illness like magic.\nTo recommend the worthy is earnest and unselfish,\nto yield one’s place is a humble, sincere intent.\nMy memorial reached the throne, winning imperial favor,\nand I was swiftly elevated to the ranks of remonstrance, standing beside the ministers.",

      "translated_text": "Among my disciples was a wound physician named Gongsun Zhishu, whose nature was kind and wise, and whose learning was vast and precise. He possessed deep knowledge of the properties and flavors of all medicines. He created a formula of five toxic ingredients—cinnabar, realgar, alum, magnetite, and chalcanthite—explaining that cinnabar nourishes the blood and benefits the heart, realgar promotes flesh and fortifies the spleen, alum regulates fat and aids the lungs, magnetite unblocks bone marrow and strengthens the kidneys, and chalcanthite treats the sinews and nourishes the liver. Externally, this remedy cured the five types of sores, while internally, it corresponded to the five viscera. Bound with yellow wax and refined through precise firing, the medicine, once prepared, proved divinely effective when applied to sores. He recorded his method for posterity. I acknowledged my own inferiority to him, yet he remained beneath me in rank. Thus, I recommended Zhishu to take my place, allowing him to assume my duties as well.\n\nBefore long, the sovereign fell ill, and a carbuncle formed upon his temple. One night, it suddenly ruptured, placing him in grave danger. The aforementioned medicine was applied, and he recovered at once. Thereupon, Zhishu was appointed Imperial Physician. For my forthrightness and lack of concealment, and for recommending the right person, I was deemed worthy of imperial reward and promoted to Remonstrator.\n\n**XVI. Admonition Without Flattery**\nThe imperial physician’s life-saving work is no light matter—\nonly through dizziness and submission is loyal governance achieved.\nWhen form and trace are forgotten, doubts dissolve of themselves;\nif the pivot’s mechanism is not secure, disaster arises.\nSubtle words must not expose the ruler’s faults,\nnor should erasing drafts obscure the upright’s name.\nAs long as the sagely court commits no errors,\nthe honor of office is no betrayal of true feeling.\n\nThe king proclaimed: *\"Ah, you of meritorious virtue, forthright and without concealment! I recall that a good physician saves lives, but a great physician saves the state. Now I truly open the path of remonstrance to honor your worth. You must apply the same heart that cures illness to correcting my faults.\"*\n\nAlas!\n*\"Good medicine is bitter to the mouth but benefits the ailment;\nloyal words grate upon the ear but benefit conduct.\"*\nGo forth and reverently uphold your duty—do not abandon your principles!\n\nI declined thrice before accepting. Having joined the ranks of the seven ministers, I drew near to the radiance of the throne. Though the sovereign and his ministers were sagely and without grave faults, my love for the ruler and concern for the state never wavered—not in a single step, nor in a single meal or rest.\n\nWhen King Cheng was young, he governed under the regency of the Duke of Zhou. After assuming personal rule for some time, he once uttered words of discontent. Fearing that those around him might exploit the opportunity, I frequently admonished him with cautionary tales of the subtle shifts between fortune and misfortune in the relationship between ruler and minister. My drafts were repeatedly burned, and no one saw them. Thus, during the Duke of Zhou’s eastern campaign, though the Four States spread rumors and the Duke of Shao was displeased, the situation was ultimately resolved without harm—wherein I played a small part.\n\n**XVII. Returning in Honor**\nTen years of official service, leaving mulberry and catalpa behind—\none day, returning in honor to my native village.\nMy eldest son, Mao, startled by my cap and robes;\nthe paths of my fields and gardens, now overgrown, seem like hills and ruins.\nThe dream of wandering immortals proves but empty toil;\nworldly attachments fade, and I freely expand and contract.\nOnce more, I know the bliss of spring slumber by the north window—\nlet the cock crow at the fifth watch; I rise when I please.\n\nI had served in the capital for ten years, long parted from my homeland, and weary wings longed to return. I often thought of my aging parents, still in good health, though I remained in obscurity. After their passing, I received honors and emoluments—yet what joy was there in feasting on fine rice and wearing brocade? One day, I read the Duke of Zhou’s *\"Owl\"* and was moved to sorrow. Thereupon, I resolved to return home, repeatedly submitting petitions to retire and return my bones to the earth. At last, my wish was granted. The dukes, ministers, and gentlemen held a farewell banquet for me outside the eastern gate.\n\nUpon my return, the villagers welcomed me. I left my carriage at the outskirts and walked the rest of the way, and my neighbors took pride in my honor.\n\n**XVIII. Honoring the Clan**\nClan members all spring from one root—\nhow can wealth and poverty truly be weighed?\nIf official stipends come by chance, why hoard them?\nWhen kinfolk reach such straits, what becomes of human feeling?\nIn life and death, I assist with weddings and funerals;\nfor the talented and promising, I provide guidance and support.\nOther families, hearing of this, gladly emulate it—\nthe Three Hao gradually establish charitable estates in their names.\n\nThe Zhang clan had several branches, many of them impoverished. After my return, I sought them out. The young had grown to adulthood, the young adults had aged, and the vicissitudes of life and death, honor and hardship, were startling to behold. The destitute, unable to rise on their own, remained as before. Thereupon, I established a charitable estate, entrusting it to Yuan Shi. The poor received aid, the sick received medicine, grown men and women were married, and promising youths were educated. Other families, inspired by this example, followed suit. The charitable estates expanded, and the customs of the land grew more virtuous.\n\n**XIX. Returning to Stillness**\nI have heard of the Great Sage of the West—\nwho takes suffering, emptiness, and stillness as truth.\nWalking and singing, he trusts the metaphor of floating clouds;\nsitting in contemplation, he labors over the illusion of a dream-body.\nHaving grasped the secret, he crosses to the other shore with ease;\nforgetting words, he finds solace in nurturing his spirit.\nFrom this, I begin to understand the principle of returning to the root—\nnorth or south, east or west, I bend and stretch as I please.\n\nDuring my time at court, I heard the words of those beyond the world: In the western lands, there is a Great Sage, the Ancient Sovereign, who transforms without speaking, governs without action, takes compassion as his foundation, expedience as his function, fasting as his constant practice, and stillness as his joy. He regards life and death as morning and evening, treats kindness and enmity as dreams and waking, and is free from sorrow, anger, or resentment—for he knows that floating life is brief and seeks the unborn.\n\nI once admired him. After resigning my honors and returning home, I encountered a recluse on the road, walking and singing:\n*\"The morning sun’s glow,\nstriking stone, gives birth to clouds.\nAt first, faint and indistinct,\nthen rich and profuse.\nRising with the wind, they drift boundlessly,\nshifting and changing before vanishing—\ngone without a trace, their whereabouts unknown.\nAlas! The official’s pursuit of profit and emolument,\nforgetting his toil, he races onward.\nSuddenly, the twilight presses near,\nfacing the great limit, he hesitates.\nHe will set foot in the dark realm,\nbecoming one among the teeming multitudes.\"*\n\nAt first, I halted my carriage to listen. Soon, I leaned on the crossbar in respect. Finally, I dismounted, wept, and bowed, saying: *\"Just now, I heard your sublime words, which deeply resonate with my heart. I beg you to bestow upon me your enlightening counsel, that I may sustain my remaining breath.\"* Thereupon, in the midst of the thoroughfare, I bowed a hundred times and earnestly entreated him.",
      "overlap_context": " allowed me to fulfill my duties.\n\n**XV. Recommending the Worthy**\nA man’s goodness is like my own—\nhaving attained, I still think of those who have not.\nGreat wisdom, though hidden, can create wonders,\nwhile wondrous prescriptions cure illness like magic.\nTo recommend the worthy is earnest and unselfish,\nto yield one’s place is a humble, sincere intent.\nMy memorial reached the throne, winning imperial favor,\nand I was swiftly elevated to the ranks of remonstrance, standing beside the ministers.",

Thus may you attain Perfect Enlightenment.

It was during the autumn assembly of the *hao* year, when I gathered my kin and friends to leave behind verses before passing away.

Enamored of its sublime scenery, I tarried briefly. At that time, above, no ruler’s authority loomed; below, no ties of blood or kinship bound me. Transcendent beyond the world, I came and went alone. The waters’ radiance and mountains’ hues were lovely in all seasons; chanting to the wind and howling at the moon—what boundless joy! Reflecting on past affairs, they seemed but a dream.\n\nSoon, I roamed as an immortal, with celestial companions visiting day and night.

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Twenty-One: Stirred by Life**\n\nThe spirit knew the years on Junshan stretched long,\nIn grotto-heavens deep, far from the world’s clamor.\nA sigh, a sob—no outlet for the grief,\nYet sensed the grieving soul could not be called back home.\nThe fate to seize a womb remained unfulfilled,\nDragging through mud and water, resentment hard to dispel.\nThe jade flask refused to keep spring’s stay,\nLeaking yang’s warmth where willow twigs appeared.\n\nI had dwelt on Junshan for so long when, one day, spring waters first rose. At the lake’s mouth, a great ship moored to the shore, where men slit a sheep’s throat and poured wine, wailing in sacrifice with such heartrending sorrow that I was moved. Drawing nearer to listen, I saw a woman of thirty-odd years, her body suffused with golden light. Thrice she drank and prayed:\n\n*\"My husband, wronged and exiled to the southern wilds, perished of miasma. His homeland lies ten thousand leagues away, his coffin returned but lately. Time spares none—soon the final mourning rites must end. Yet I grieve: no one remains to serve our home, while his parents, aged and frail, await in vain. A child stirs in my womb, its form still unseen. If the spirits of these mountains and waters deem my husband’s crime one of loyalty, if they pity my in-laws’ twilight years without support—now that my own end nears, grant me your hidden protection. Let me bear a son to continue the Zhang line. Though my life may not be spared, I shall have no regrets.\"*\n\nFrom the cloud-paths, her sorrow overwhelmed me. Tears streamed forth, and suddenly I fell into her embrace, senseless. After a long while, I heard voices: *\"The child! The child!\"* Opening my eyes, I found myself in a bathing tub—I had been born.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Honoring My Forebears**\n\nKing Li heeded slander, the people’s hearts turned away,\nMy father’s loyal words tread the path of disaster.\nThe exile to Liuzhi foretold the throne’s fall,\nYet heedless of scales turned awry, he failed to guard against subtle wrongs.\nThe orphan’s grace from the sage’s favor never waned,\nThe radiant soul of the wise shone still more bright.\nAscending the remonstrance hall to inherit his office,\nMen said his son could carry on his mantle.\n\nMy late father’s name was Wuji. After his burial north of the Yellow River, my mother, née Huang, raised me with kindness, wisdom, and unyielding discipline. In every moment—whether nursing, resting, waking, or singing—she spoke of poetry and history, gathering neighboring children to play with me. With mud and silk scraps, she crafted figures, reenacting tales of old: now a courtly assembly of lord and vassal, now a father’s admonition to his son, now a master’s exhortation to his disciple, now friends in conversation. She explained each scene, teaching me the ways of the world.\n\nAt ten, I was sent to study outside the home. She named me *Zhongsi*—\"Loyal Heir\"—to honor my father’s legacy. When I came of age and donned the cap, my grandfather, Pingzi, styled me *Zhong*. My mother performed the *Three Cappings* with solemnity. At the western chamber, she returned my bows, then wept as she said:\n\n*\"Your father once served King Li as a* bao *officer, charged with admonishing the king’s faults. But the king was suspicious by nature, ashamed to hear his errors. Those who dared remonstrate were put to death. In time, he even punished those who* monitored slander*, and many perished. The roads fell silent; people spoke only with their eyes. The people could bear it no longer, and resentment spread. Your father memorialized the king, urging him to reform, to repeal the laws against slander, and to heed the voices below. The king refused. Thus was he exiled to Panyu, where he met his end. The realm mourned his unjust fate.*\n\n*Now the king rules with benevolence. By edict, the descendants of those wronged in past reigns are to be reinstated. Go forth!\"*\n\nI journeyed to the capital and stood upon the *Feishi* stone to proclaim my innocence. A decree restored my father’s rank posthumously, bestowing upon him the posthumous title *Xian*—\"Offering,\" for loyalty must be reported to the throne. I was appointed *bao* officer, inheriting my father’s duty. This was in the reign of King Xuan.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: Filial Piety and Brotherly Love**\n\nMy elder brother, alas, left no heir,\nYet we shared the same root, born of one branch.\nMother’s grief stirred a response deep within,\nSo Maoyang was chosen to continue the line.\nThe northern hall’s sorrow eased for our kind mother,\nWhile the dark earth knew the dead had not been forgotten.\nMourning rites were fulfilled for my grandparents,\nAnd my name resounded for filial piety and brotherly love in that age.\n\nMy brother Yunsi died young; I never met him. When I came of age, I had two sons: the elder, Ranming, and the younger, Maoyang. Maoyang was precocious, beloved by his great-grandfather. On the eve of the *Changzhi* festival, as the family offered sacrifices at the ancestral shrine, my mother wept bitterly, lamenting my brother’s untimely death. I asked to adopt Maoyang as his heir to comfort her heart.\n\nMy paternal grandmother, née Zhao, passed at eighty. My grandfather, stricken with grief, refused food and could not rise for the mourning rites. As his grandson, I donned the *zicui* mourning garb and observed the three-year mourning period with utmost sorrow, fulfilling every rite. Word of my filial piety and brotherly love spread near and far; people spoke of me by my style, not my name.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Waters of the Mian**\n\nAh, Minister Yin Jifu—his spirit soared,\nHis merit, renown, and talent crowned the sacred court.\nWeaving civil and martial arts, his heart was steadfast,\nYet the campaigns west and north stretched far.\nIn the capital of Hao, rumors took flight, slander arose,\nBy the Mian’s waters, his poems carried veiled admonitions.\nThe lord and minister rejoiced in their bond, their achievements grand,\nThanks to my loyal counsel, the demon of slander was stilled.\n\nKing Xuan had a worthy minister, Yin Jifu, endowed with both civil and martial gifts, admired by all officials. The realm had endured turmoil, with the Four Barbarians encroaching on all sides. When the king ascended the throne, he launched northern and western campaigns to restore the borders of Kings Wen and Wu. Jifu was entrusted with sole command of the army. While I remained with the king, Jifu’s grand strategies often overlooked minor details, displeasing many in the king’s inner circle. Slander soon flourished, and the king’s suspicions grew. While Jifu was in the capital, rumors reached the throne. I defended him tirelessly, but the king’s doubts lingered. I then composed the *\"Ode to the Mian Waters.\"* When the king heard it, and Jifu returned in triumph, their bond deepened. The achievements of the restoration surpassed those of Shaokang and King Gaozong.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: The White Colt**\n\nThe sage’s diligence had a worthy beginning,\nBut one day, his virtuous countenance dimmed, and good counsel waned.\nWorthy talents fled, lamenting their graying years,\nWhile poems took shape, singing of the white colt.\n\nThe king’s early diligence gave way to complacency. His demeanor, once radiant with virtue, grew dismissive of wise advice. The worthy withdrew, sighing over their fading years. I composed verses, likening them to a white colt.",

At that time, the realm knew no peril, and the jade heart grew somewhat lax. One day, the Master of Ceremonies, Wei Zhong, impeached Zhang Fang before the throne. Heaven’s majesty struck awe, and Wei was duly tried. Thereupon, men of Dao and virtue, elders of seasoned wisdom, turned and departed. My heart grieved, and I composed the *\"Ode to the White Colt\"* as a subtle rebuke, urging the king to cherish worthy talent, to be tolerant in receiving remonstrance, so that those in office would harbor no thought of leaving, those already gone might hope to return, and recluses would aspire to serve. The poem reached the king, who was moved. He issued edicts to those abroad, blaming himself and repenting his errors. Wei’s position was restored, and gifts of silk and bows with banners were sent daily without fail. Before long, public opinion turned to praise, the spirit of the scholar-officials flourished, and the realm once more witnessed the governance of the Cheng and Kang eras.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: Avenging Wrongs**\n\nOur late lord drinks his resentment in the Yellow Springs,\nBy rites, the foe’s house cannot share the sky.\nThe dead cannot undo Feng Cheng’s slander,\nBut later men—Wen Shu—proved worthy.\n\nOne knows only the day of recommending talent,\nNot the years when the innocent were slandered.\nThe throne, too, clearly knew the truth of this matter—\nWhy should rumors, within and without, be suppressed?\n\nOur father’s death arose from the slander of Nan Feng Cheng, a matter well known in the court. The eternal sorrow remains unforgotten. Feng Cheng has long been dead, but he had a son named Wen Shu, talented and virtuous. Once, as a student of the National University, he studied under Master Wei. When I inquired of Wei, he told me: “Feng Cheng’s son is insatiable in learning, his speech a model, his bearing exemplary—unmatched among the noble youths of today.” The ways of Heaven are hard to fathom: who would have thought that Feng Cheng, with his fly-like conduct, would have such a son? This is like the blind Gu and the wicked Gun giving birth to Shun and Yu. He will surely become a great vessel. Though I bore a feud that could not share the sky with him, upon hearing of his good conduct, my heart was gladdened. After my elevation to Grand Master, when the position of Guardian was vacant, the decree permitted me to recommend someone to take my place. I put forward Wen Shu, and the king heeded my words, and he ultimately excelled in his duties.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Aiding the Orphaned**\n\nLife and death’s paths are not easily foreseen—\nZhong Jiang in his prime, suddenly stricken with peril.",

flesh, it should be cherished,\nBut for the sake of food and raiment, men sink into ruin.\n\nHow different is my boundless compassion?\nHeaven and Earth give life equally to all.\nFrom this, the customs of the land were transformed,\nAnd the cruel practice of culling infants ceased, sparing the gods from offense.\n\nNorthwest of Jianbei, where the roads fork eastward,\nBeyond two hamlets, lies the prefecture of Ju.\nIts fertile soil sustains the poor,\nYet among its households, fate varies by rank:\nThose of the *jia* class rear their sons,\nThose of the *yi* may or may not,\nBut those of the *bing* and *ding* classes—\nTheir children are left to die.\nFor they hoard food and clothing, seeking ease in the moment,\nHeedless of what comes after.\n\nZhang Qianshi was a wealthy landlord.\nEighty households tilled his fields for sustenance.\nOn the day he granted them land, he made this pact:\nThose who already had sons strong enough to plow and harvest might keep them,\nBut any born thereafter would not be tolerated—\nThis was his unchanging rule.\n\nQianshi had twelve sons.\nThe eldest was disabled and unfit for labor.\nThe second, at three years old, suffered from convulsions.\nPhysicians, diviners, shamans—none could cure him.\nHe prayed to the local deity, Lord Gongsun Zhang,\nFor ten days to no avail.\nZhang came to me, pleading for help.\nI followed him and inquired into the cause of this calamity.\nIt was revealed that among his tenants, past and present,\nOver forty infants had been abandoned—\nTheir souls, adrift in the void, had joined forces to haunt him.\n\nI appeared in the dream of his wife, Lady Li,\nAnd she recounted the matter.\nThough she spoke, Qianshi remained unrepentant.\nI then dispatched my attendant, Xun Ming, to deliver my words,\nMaking his youngest son speak them:\n*\"The child you abandon is as your own;\nThe child you love is as another’s.\nYou covet their labor yet resent their idle mouths,\nConsuming their grain.\nNow forty-some lives press upon you—\nYour son is on the brink of death.\"*\n\nQianshi reproached himself bitterly,\nKowtowing until his forehead bled,\nBegging me for mercy.\nI admonished him to change his ways,\nAnd he complied.\nHis son recovered,\nAnd from then on, the people of the prefecture cherished life,\nAnd the population gradually flourished.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: Rescuing the Drowned**\nAutumn rains poured without end,\nThree rivers converged like a single flood.\nMirror Pool swelled, bottomless in its depth,\nThe city walls crumbled—urgent was the peril.\n\nThe remnant folk of Baima were virtuous,\nAnd Magistrate Huang Gao’s governance was benevolent.\nWith a single shout from Bo Jian, the waves stilled—\nWho would dare claim the raging torrent could capsize a boat?\n\nThe prefecture of Baima,\nHome to over eight hundred households,\nLay at the confluence of three rivers.\nAutumn rains fell ceaselessly for three months.\nThe northeastern valleys and the river swelled in unison,\nChoking at the mouth of Lingyan Gorge,\nUnable to drain.\nWaves surged, submerging the land,\nAnd the people faced the dread of drowning.\n\nThe local deity, Bo Jian, came to report:\n*\"Baima is a small prefecture,\nOnce subject to the people, now a dependency of Shu.\nIts magistrate, Huang Gao, is kind and loves his people.\nYet Heaven has sent these endless rains,\nRuining the harvest.\nThe three rivers encircle us—\nThe people’s lives hang in the balance.\"*\n\nAs this was within my jurisdiction,\nI went with Jian.\nUpon arrival, the waters had risen tenfold,\nAnd the people scurried like ants fleeing a collapsing nest.\nOnly fifteen or sixteen parts of the city walls remained.\nThe young carried their kin but could not escape;\nThe old were abandoned, left to await their fate.\nMy heart grieved for them.\n\nI had Bo Jian convey the Emperor’s decree,\nCommanding the waters to return to their proper course.\nThis is what is meant by \"shouting at the river god.\"\nFrom then on, the people of the prefecture—\nThousands of lives—\nWere spared the disaster of drowning.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: The Grain Rain**\nHow does one plant the seeds of hidden virtue?\nBy placing the people’s welfare first in all affairs.\nXu Shi exhausted his fortune to relieve famine,\nWhile the Luo family hoarded grain, refusing even a needle’s worth.\n\nTo accumulate yet know when to disperse—this is the Way of Heaven.\nWealth may turn to poverty, for ghosts will seize what is withheld.\nOne man dies, another prospers—there is reason in this,\nFor the workings of Creation are profound indeed.\n\nIn the great prefecture of Baxi,\nOne or two in a hundred were rich,\nWhile the poor toiled to survive.\nWhen the Emperor of Shu first ascended the throne,\nThe year was one of great famine.\nThough the Emperor lived frugally and labored for his people,\nHis virtue had not yet borne fruit,\nAnd the lingering misfortune was not yet spent.\nThe people of Baxi suffered most grievously from hunger.\n\nThe wealthy farmer Luo Mi hoarded his grain,\nWhile the righteous man Xu Rong spent his entire fortune to aid the poor.\nThe needy came endlessly,\nAnd his resources could not keep pace.\nAll day, he burned incense and prayed to Heaven for aid.\n\nThe local spirit, He Laisun, reported this to me.\nI memorialized the Emperor,\nAnd a decree was issued to seize Luo Mi’s stored grain—\nFive thousand *hu* in all—and rain it down.\nI then commanded the Wind Master to strike Luo’s granary.\nThe grain swirled on the wind,\nFalling from the sky like rain,\nEach kind gathering by color,\nScattering across the fields and streets.\nNot a soul in the prefecture went unfed.\n\nLuo’s hoarded stores were exhausted in a single day.\nThe people, grateful for Xu’s kindness,\nOften repaid him,\nRelieved at Luo’s misfortune and calling it just.\nThe Emperor of Shu appointed Xu as his prefectural aide,\nAnd Luo, upon hearing this, hanged

autumn’s harvest,\nSpared the remnant folk from suffering in summer’s fields.\n\nSince then, many have come to resettle here,\nThe old leaning on others, the young carried in arms.\nNorth of the Ju suburbs, west of the Ba River,\nStands Dragon Mountain.\nAt its foot dwell some three hundred households.\n\nIn the early years of the Silkworm Emperor,\nAll of Shu suffered a great drought.\nThe local deity, Lord Su, could not bear to see his people perish in the famine.\nHe blamed himself, saying:\n*“The able-bodied among my people labor without complaint,\nThe elderly rest in peace—this is not unfilial.\nThey endure corvée without resentment—this is not disloyal.\nThey plow in spring, sow in summer, and sacrifice to Heaven and Earth in winter—this is not irreverent.\nThey tend their fine fields, rejoicing in their bounty,\nAnd once the harvest comes, they dare not taste it first—this is not disobedient.\nSuch loyal, filial, reverent, and obedient people,\nYet drought strikes as a calamity, sparing none—this is my failing.”*\n\nTo make his plea heard in Heaven,\nHe commanded the local earth deities to take charge.\nI then summoned the artisans of Zhiliang,\nAnd borrowed the waters of the Ba River to curve and bestow rain.\nAfter three days, the drought broke,\nAnd a bountiful harvest followed.\nThe people named the village *Jiaze* (“Gracious Moisture”),\nAnd those from elsewhere who moved here gradually grew in number.\n\n**Chapter Forty: The Buried Bandit**\nA dutiful wife toils to care for her mother-in-law,\nHer heart as clear as water, ever mindful of her first husband.\nShe forgoes adornment, to others’ surprise,\nFinding joy in needlework to sustain herself.\n\nAfter a proper burial and a mournful sacrifice,\nThe foolish folk, even in broad daylight, break in to steal.\nNot only was her steadfast virtue blessed by the gods,\nBut the greedy and cruel met with ghostly retribution.\n\nAt the source of the Han River lived a filial widow named Yang Liangzhong,\nA woman of noble lineage who married the poor scholar Yong Youzhang.\nWhen Youzhang died young,\nLiangzhong vowed never to remarry.\n\nAs her savings dwindled and her coffers emptied,\nWith no one else to rely on,\nHer mother-in-law grew old and ill.\nMatchmakers came daily, urging her:\n*“What people desire are beauty and wealth.\nYour family is poor, struck by misfortune.\nYet suitors still seek you—perhaps because,\nThough your years are not yet spent and your qi still flourishes,\nYou bear no illness, making you a worthy match.\nHow could you abandon your aged mother-in-law,\nForget your first husband,\nAnd turn your back to serve another?”*\n\nSkilled in needlework, which she had never sullied,\nShe sewed, washed, and mended for others to scrape by.\n*“My mother-in-law and I endure this out of necessity,”* she said.\n*“Once she passes, I can remarry—it is not too late.”*\n\nShe cut her hair in mourning and renounced adornment,\nSupporting herself with women’s work.\nFor six years she persevered.\nWhen her mother-in-law died, she buried her with full rites,\nAnd three days later, held a sacrificial offering.\nOver a hundred villagers came to assist.\n\nA thief, seizing her absence,\nBroke through the wall and opened the lock,\nMaking off with all her savings.\nLiangzhong remained unaware.\n\nHer household earth deity, Bai Zhiyi,\nAlong with the village’s spirit-official, Kang Chaosheng,\nSought to punish the thief.\nCoinciding with my arrival in Baozhong,\nThey reported the matter to me.\nI dispatched thirty spectral soldiers,\nWho seized the thief in the marketplace.\nHe was made to declare before the crowd all he had stolen:\n*“These belong to the chaste widow, Madam Yang.\nThey must be returned.”*\nThen, raising his hands to his mouth,\nHe bit off all ten fingers and died.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: The Northern Suburb**\nThe weight of continuing one’s lineage is no small matter,\nYet it lies in the heart’s field where fruits are sown.\nTo rush is clumsy and still yields little,\nWhile inviting trouble only deepens unrest.\n\nTending plants and trees serves as a parable:\nRelieve the orphaned and poor, and sincerity will follow.\nGongzi, heir to his family, was called *Divine Protector*—\nThus is retribution made clear.\n\nIn the northern suburb of Shu’s capital lived a man named Wang Shangzhong,\nWealthy but childless.\nAt forty, he grew anxious and devised a plan:\nHe hastily took many concubines, yet none bore him a child.\nHe then adopted a son from his clan,\nBut the boy’s nature was treacherous and impatient.\nIf a concubine displeased him even slightly,\nHe would beat or replace her.\nIf the adopted son disobeyed his teachings,\nHe would drive him away.\nThe more frantic his efforts, the more flawed his schemes.\nYears passed, and he neared fifty.\n\nHe then prepared a grand feast,\nInviting many renowned shamans and diviners.\nTheir songs and prayers lasted over a month.\nI transformed into a layman and said to him:\n*“When planting peach and plum trees,\nYou tend and water them,\nYet before long, you prune their branches,\nHoping for quick growth.\nYou then uproot and replant them,\nAdding fertilizer,\nChecking their roots before the season is right,\nInspecting their firmness.\nSeeing their leaves flourish,\nYou dig them up again,\nDiscard the old soil,\nAnd move them once more.\nYour efforts are excessive, yet no fruit comes—\nCan this be called wisdom?”*\n*“No,”* he replied.\nI said: *“How is your quest for an heir different?\nI now advise you:\nCalm your heart and body,\nChange your past ways.\nEase the burdens on others,\nForgive their faults.\nKeep the concubines who are content,\nAnd marry off those who are not.\nThe son you adopted from your clan,\nThough not of your blood, calls you father.\nHold fast to your original intent,\nOverlook minor grievances.\nIf you have a son, do not abandon him.\nSave those on the brink of death,\nAid those in dire need,\nRelieve the poor,\nAnd care for the orphaned.\nDevote yourself to this,\nAnd leave the rest to Heaven.\nIf you persist for three years,\nGood fortune will come.”*\n\nAfter speaking, I vanished.\nShangzhong believed me, taking it as a divine message.\nLater, he married off thirteen maidservants.\nHe arranged marriages for his two adopted sons,\nProviding them separate homes for long-term stability.\nHe buried over fifty poor parents,\nAnd arranged marriages for over eighty impoverished men and women.\nWithin three years,\nHe indeed fathered a noble heir,\nWhom he named *Shenbao* (“Divine Protector”).\nThe boy grew up to uphold his family.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two: The Returning Flame**\nBrothers, born of the same branch,\nHow could they spy on

      "translated_text": "**The Returning Flame**\n\nThe Lord of Ju’s greed was hard to fathom,\nYet the pure and loyal King of Shu never doubted him.\nA raging flame stretching to the heavens was truly fearsome,\nBut a mighty wind turned back upon its bearer brought peril.\nA voice from the void spoke with perfect clarity—\nOnly then did they believe the gods could not be deceived.\n\nKing Yuliang of Shu had a younger brother, Jiameng, whom he enfeoffed at Ju, making him the Lord of Ju. Over time, Ju sent envoys demanding bribes, but the King of Shu refused. Thereupon, Ju dispatched men to burn Shu’s treasuries. The fire blazed fiercely. Upon hearing this, I commanded the Wind Master to reverse the flames, declaring aloud Ju’s treachery. In an instant, all Ju’s messengers perished in the fire. From then on, Ju and Shu waged war for three years, yet Ju could never overcome Shu.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three: Pacifying Ju**\n\nThe Lord of Ju established his state as Jiameng,\nForgetting that Yufu was his own brother.\nWeapons clashed, and the people died unjustly,\nWhile neighboring borders vied in vain.\nThen, through envoys, the situation was discussed—\nDivine soldiers appeared to show the weight of heaven’s will.\nOnce the people of Jia realized righteousness,\nThey spared the common folk from suffering.\n\nAfter Ju and Shu had long been at odds, the King of Shu grew weary of war and sent Zhuang Su to negotiate peace. The Lord of Ju refused. Zhuang Su then spoke of Shu’s military strength, pointing toward the western frontier. I manifested divine soldiers to warn him. Suspecting an ambush, the Lord of Ju sought a truce. His envoys reported this to the king, who then built a temple for me north of the capital.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four: Fei Ding**\n\nThough he upheld the straight path in life, he met with misfortune,\nHis lingering spirit after death scorned empty flattery.\nThe king favored the Five Ding, forgetting military preparedness—\nI, in turn, opposed them with the might of the Three Di.\nObsessed with piling earth to honor his concubine’s tomb,\nHe scorned talk of war and rejected defense of the frontier.\n“What care I for your ominous words?” he sneered,\nThen destroyed my temple—what harm could that do?\n\nA mountain spirit from Wudu transformed into a woman, surpassingly beautiful, the like of which had never been seen in Shu. King Kaiming Shang of Shu saw her and was captivated, taking her as his concubine. Soon after, she died, and the king mourned her endlessly. He ordered her tomb built ever higher to show his undying devotion. The five Fei brothers of Wudu, men of great strength, curried favor with the king. Using their might, they hauled earth from Wudu Mountain to raise the tomb, and in no time, the mound rivaled the mountain’s height. The king named it Wukai Mountain, saying the concubine’s death had moved the earth.\n\nThereafter, the king trusted and favored the Five Ding, keeping them constantly by his side. He himself was strong and proud of his prowess. With the Five Ding at his command, he boasted that his bare hands could break spears and halberds, that his fleet feet could outrun chariots and cavalry. Thus, he neglected border defenses, dismantling outposts and extinguishing beacons.\n\nAs I was now his tutelary deity, receiving his sacrifices, and with mighty Qin on his borders, I feared the unforeseen. I transformed into a scholar, calling myself Zhang Sheng of the Northern Capital, and knocked at the palace gates to submit a memorial. Its gist was this:\n\n*“I have heard that those who rely on virtue prosper, while those who rely on force perish. In the governance of Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang, the ministers at court were known by name, yet none relied solely on strength. Mere personal bravery cannot be depended upon, nor can exceptional skill overawe enemies. Fei Lian and E Lai could not save King Zhou of Shang, nor could Hou Yi and Ao escape violent deaths. In recent times, the Three Di, though tall and mighty, were ultimately exterminated.*\n\n*Now, the five Fei brothers at the frontier possess no virtue, only brute strength. The king, impressed by their size and might, has neglected military preparedness. I say that the strength of the Fei brothers may equal ten men, even a hundred, but if used against an enemy, it will be of no avail. If stationed on watchtowers or employed as charioteers, their bare arms and legs wielding bows and reins, running to serve—this is acceptable. But to rely on them to repel neighboring states is folly. In truth, they are no different from the Red, White, or Long Di of old.*\n\n*I urge you to cherish the foundations laid by your ancestors and strengthen border defenses against Qin. Do not let the bravado of a few men undermine the discipline of the Three Armies.”*\n\nThe king was displeased: *“You urge me to tighten military preparedness yet mock my nurturing of talented warriors. It is like hunting without hawks or guarding against thieves without dogs.”*\n\nI argued vehemently, but the Five Ding, basking in the king’s favor, sought to humiliate me. I vanished from their sight. The Five Ding declared me a demon and said, *“This must be Zhang Zhongzi of the Northern Suburbs.”* They then destroyed my temple, but I paid it no mind.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five: The Stone Oxen**\n\nShu and Ba clashed—Shu was rich and strong,\nQin coveted Shu and schemed cunningly.\nNot that King Hui devised a wise plan,\nBut that Kaiming’s folly led him astray.\nStone oxen stood at the mountain’s foot,\nMolten gold hidden beneath their tails.\nGreed blinded him to loyal ministers’ counsel—\nCarving roads and raising armies brought later calamity.\n\nAs the Zhou house declined, the feudal lords encroached upon one another. Ba and Shu fell into conflict, and Qin, bordering Shu, plotted to annex it. King Hui of Qin followed the strategy of Sima Cuo, but the Shu roads were perilously steep, leaving no path for an army. Thus, at the Qin-Shu border, they carved five stone oxen, each of colossal size, and placed them in the grass. They also cast gold into cakes and hid them beneath the oxen’s tails. Spies were sent to observe. After a month, the gold cakes were taken, only to be replaced. As the thefts grew frequent, the King of Shu learned of it. He sent men to investigate and, over months, amassed over a thousand catties of gold.\n\nHe then ordered the Five Ding to carve a treacherous path, leading five thousand soldiers to haul the stone oxen back. On the day they set out, I once more transformed, this time into a scholar named Zhonggong Zichang, and sought an audience at court. I submitted a memorial, warning that opening the road was unwise and that the gold was a snare. The king laughed and said:\n\n*“Heaven does not begrudge the Dao, nor earth its treasures. By the grace of the altars of soil and grain, stone oxen and yellow gold have entered my realm. Gold is the most precious of treasures—it can enrich the state, strengthen the army, and ease the people’s burdens. You suspect deceit from a neighboring state—this is overcaution. Who would cast away thousands of gold to set a trap?”*",

The king deemed me an ill omen, and his attendants dragged me out. I then withdrew into concealment.\n\n**Five Wives (Forty-Sixth)**\nThe Qin, greedy for Shu’s land, schemed to swallow it whole;\nA treacherous path was carved, opening Shu’s gates wide.\nYet still they feared the stone oxen might expose their ruse,\nSo offered royal daughters to seal the bond anew.\nThey never reckoned a great state makes a perilous match,\nAssuming only sincerity lay behind the vow.\nThough I knew my words of warning would be spurned as waste,\nHow could I bear silence and betray my lord’s trust?\n\nOnce the stone oxen were brought back, the King of Qin said: *“This stratagem served well to open the road, but if the oxen return without gold, my plan is undone.”* He then sent envoys to propose a marriage alliance with Shu, declaring: *“Qin and Shu are neighbors—kinship and goodwill between neighbors are the natural order. I have five daughters of royal blood; I ask that the King of Shu accept them as brides.”*\n\nThe King of Shu rejoiced greatly. Upon hearing this, I sighed and said: *“That is a mighty state—how could such a thing be fitting for us?”* The king dispatched the Five Ding to the border to receive the Qin princesses. He himself prepared a thousand chariots and waited at the northern outskirts, eager to glimpse their faces.\n\nI then appeared among the guards in the guise of a scholar, stepped forward, and submitted a memorial in protest. The king grew furious: *“Are you not that meddlesome Zhang Zhongzi of Beiguo? This is the third time your slanderous words have shamed me!”* He ordered his attendants to seize me. I revealed my wrathful aspect, and the guards scattered in terror. Thus I escaped.\n\n**Manifesting the Divine (Forty-Seventh)**\nMy loyal heart could not endure Qin’s encroachment on Shu;\nThough I remonstrated with all my strength, my lord spurned me.\nMy fierce mien was meant to strike fear into the enemy,\nYet in an instant, my great form vanished, concealed by jade decree.\nThe winding path of seven bends was just traversed,\nWhen mountains crushed the host of spirits—all perished in the end.\nFrom that time on, this corner of the land knew reverence,\nAnd the might of Jiannan blazed like fire.\n\nAfter the Five Ding escorted the Qin princesses back, the people of Shu—from the lowliest to the highest—rejoiced, blind to the snare of disaster. They mistook peril for fortune, mourning for celebration—such is the common folly of the multitude.\n\nI then manifested my colossal form upon the southern slope of Jianling, blocking the road, hoping the Qin princesses would turn back in fear. The people of Qin and Shu who witnessed this were struck with awe. Amid the clamor of weapons and the din of chariots, a jade-like voice resounded, saying: *“What Heaven has doomed cannot be revived—such is the King of Shu. What Heaven has destined to rise cannot be thwarted—such is the King of Qin.

Some time later, Yi Tingyi, the governor of Ba Capital, fell ill, and the commandery’s administrator took charge of affairs. A slave of the commoner Zhang Wei, named Wanzhen, threw himself into a well and died. The case dragged on for over a month, and Wei, unable to endure the flogging, falsely confessed: “It was I who killed him and cast him in.” In truth, Wanzhen had earlier committed some offense, and Wei had once beaten him. Within three days, Wanzhen stole Wei’s valuables, intending to flee elsewhere, but was discovered by Wei. Fearing he could not escape punishment, Wanzhen took his own life—it was not Wei who killed him.\n\nWhen the verdict was reached, Wei’s son heard of it and sent someone to present Yi Tingyi with a hundred large pearls. Tingyi said to his attendant: “You, the physician, on another day bring only a small box of medicinal powder. Even in the presence of guests, do not act ashamed.” The family was overjoyed. On the appointed day, they waited at the gate to present it. Tingyi happened to be entertaining over ten guests, wine and dishes already laid out, when the physician arrived. He was invited to sit at the end of the table. After three rounds of drinking, the physician rose and spoke of presenting the medicine. Tingyi accepted it, but as soon as it was taken inside, he regretted it, saying: “The matter is unclear, and I fear slanderous talk.” He ordered it brought out again, still sealed as before. Then he commanded the physician to open the box and take out the medicine, yet still anxious that word might leak, he divided it among all the guests. The next day, Wei’s forced confession was upheld, and he was ultimately sentenced to execution.\n\nWei’s son wailed in the marketplace, looking to the heavens and crying out: “Is there no divine spirit to examine this injustice?” I witnessed this and that night summoned the souls of Tingyi, Wei and his son, and the physician, who revealed the truth. Tingyi said: “The pearls were indeed taken by me. The medicine in the box was something I had long prepared. I had just accepted the pearls when I changed my mind. Though I took them, I feared the governor would learn of it, so I dared not alter the verdict.” I ordered Tingyi’s back to be flogged two hundred times.

His father, Pingshu, could not bear to abandon him and had him nursed in secret outside the home. On New Year’s Day when he was three, he was brought before the grandchildren to pay respects. The old man flew into a rage and berated his son: “Do you mean to kill me with this ill-omened child?” Pingshu carried him out at once.\n\nThey happened to meet a friend, Zhou Ningzhi, on the road. Pingshu told him the story, and Ningzhi said: “I have no heir. Let me raise him. If one day my wife bears a son, I will return him to your family.” Pingshu agreed. Thereafter, the Zhous grew ever wealthier, while the Yuans suffered one misfortune after another and fell into dire poverty. When the Zhous had a son of their own, they no longer spoke of the earlier promise.\n\nAfter Ningzhi died, Pingshu would visit Fu from time to time. If Fu was in urgent need, Pingshu would help him repeatedly. Pingshu privately believed Fu was truly his own son and had not forgotten him. When an opportunity arose, he told Fu the whole story. Just then, Fu’s younger brother arrived and overheard Pingshu’s words. He drove Pingshu out, and the next day filed a complaint with the authorities, accusing Pingshu of falsehood. Pingshu was flogged. He burned incense on his head and reported the matter to Anxing, saying: “My son dares to flog his father.”\n\nAnxing knew the details and realized this was not Fu’s true intention, but he had not yet decided what to do when the King intervened on Pingshu’s behalf. I then went with Anxing to visit Fu. That night, I dreamed of Fu, seeing the circumstances of his birth, his grandfather’s refusal to raise him, and how his own father had nursed and reared him. Before the dream ended, I awoke in tears, wishing to take my own life. But I was bound by the official records and constrained by his younger brother, so I endured in silence.\n\nThat night, I dreamed again, rebuking Fu for not immediately obeying and flogging him a hundred times. When Fu awoke, he could not sleep until dawn. The next day, he went to the Yuan household and said to Pingshu: “I was slow to understand. As your own flesh and blood, I have now been rebuked by the gods, who nearly flogged me to death. I repent. Moreover, the Zhous have a son to continue their ancestral sacrifices, and I no longer wish to share in their family property. I only desire to follow my father.”\n\nThe villagers, learning of this, praised Fu as virtuous. The Zhous’ son divined and decided to divide the family property, giving a share to Fu and allowing him to return to his original clan.

forth, let us now make a pact to resolve this.\nWhen we return from paying homage to the sea,\nWe will entrust the matter to you.”\nLooking to heaven, they swore an oath,\nPointing to two great stones, east and west, and commanding them to rise.\nIn an instant, the two stones stood upright.\nI then admonished them: “The dragons of the two rivers have reconciled,\nWith heaven and earth as

before—heaven’s principle endures,\nIn her later years, she enjoyed the sweetness of filial care.\n\nAt the edge of Guoshan,\nA wealthy man named Wang Ji, fifty years old and childless,\nOnce, after drinking and feasting to excess, glanced at his wife and said:\n“People desire wealth to ensure sustenance in life and ancestral sacrifices after death.\nNow, though I am rich, I have no son—what use is wealth to me?”\nHis wife, Lady An, also from a prominent family, had never borne children.\nProud and jealous by nature, she felt ashamed upon hearing this.\nShe took her jewelry and dowry, bought a girl from the Liu family,\nAnd presented her to her husband.\nA year later, the girl conceived.\nLady An rejoiced, burning incense day and night,\nPraying to heaven and earth, beseeching for an heir to the Wang lineage.\nWhen she learned of Liu’s pregnancy,\nShe gave the girl her own clothes and ornaments.\nIn matters of diet, rest, and care, she spared no effort.\nIn the month before the birth, she prepared in advance, selecting a midwife.\nWhen the time came, a son was born.\nOverjoyed, she personally tended to the child’s nursing, swaddling,\nAnd even washed his diapers and cleaned him after bowel movements,\nTreating him as if he were her own.\nHer husband praised her virtue.\nWhen the child turned one hundred days old, they named him Yishou,\nA name reflecting Lady An’s wishes.\nSoon after, they hired a wet nurse to care for him exclusively.\n\nSome said to Liu: “You and I are host and guest in this household.\nSince you arrived, you have enjoyed the same food and comforts as I.\nNow, because of my son, your child is nearly a year old.\nI will arrange a matchmaker to marry you to a good man.”\nLiu wept bitterly and said: “That is not my wish.\nI only desire to stay with Yishou until death.”\nLady An, displeased, said: “Do you seek to replace me?”\nShe soon beat Liu, stripped her of fine clothes,\nGave her coarse food, and treated her like a beast,\nCalling her by the names of livestock.\nAll hard labor was forced upon Liu.\n\nWhen Yishou was three years old,\nOne day, he ran into Liu’s arms, and they wept together.\nLiu said: “For your sake, I endure hunger, cold, and toil without complaint.\nBut for over a month, I have not seen you—do you miss your mother?”\nYishou wept as well, his cries heard outside.\nLady An rushed in, snatched the child away,\nAnd beat him severely.\nIt was a cold month, and she stripped him of his clothes,\nBanishing him outside for the night.\nAt dawn, she summoned the village elder and expelled Liu.\nWang Ji, grieved by the harm done to Yishou’s heart, urged her to stay.\nLady An said: “I cannot coexist with this beast.\nIf you wish to make her your wife, I will leave.\nIf you want to keep me, she cannot stay.\nIf you delay in deciding, I will seek death before you.”\nUnable to refuse, Wang Ji gave Liu the skirt and hairpins she had worn,\nAllowing her to take them as provisions.\nBut Lady An seized them back.\n\nAfter enduring prolonged hunger and hardship,\nLiu became emaciated, her hair falling out, her skin dark and withered.\nNo one would take her in.\nShe wandered the city, barely sustaining herself,\nUntil Wang’s relatives, who were moving to Tongchuan, took her along.\nA year later, Lady An learned of this and sent a letter filled with abuse,\nDriving her away again.\nWith nowhere to go, Liu resorted to gathering firewood and drawing water,\nEarning a meager living from others.\n\nTwelve years passed.\nBoth of Yishou’s parents died, and he himself had a ten-year-old son named Zhiwei.\nSomeone told his wife, Lady Kang: “Our household is prosperous,\nLacking nothing—except knowledge of my birth mother’s fate.\nDay and night, I grieve, and at thirty, my hair has turned gray—all because of this.”\nHe entrusted his household affairs to his wife, saying:\n“Take good care of our son. I will seek my mother and return only after I find her.”\nHe set out northward, lingering in every town and village along the way,\nHis journey prolonged by his search.",

His sincerity moved both the seen and unseen realms, and wherever he went, the spirits were stirred to respond.\n\nAt the confluence of the Ba and Liang Rivers stood Phoenix Mountain. Wandering there one day, he saw an old woman carrying firewood beneath the scorching sun, sweat streaming down her face. She rested beneath a pine, facing south, and wailed: *\"Yishou, Yishou—is my son well? I suffer here in exhaustion, yet how could he ever think of me?\"*\n\nMoved by what he could not bear to hear, he called to a local man, Dugu Zheng, and asked about her. Zheng replied: *\"That is the birth mother of Wang Yishou.\"*\n\nBy then, Yishou had been away for so long that his family urged his return. He had already begun the journey home when, in a dream, he saw his birth mother at their old home—every detail of her hardships and sorrows, even the place where they would meet on the road. The next day, overjoyed, he declared: *\"The gods have shown me! There is an omen that mother and son shall meet.\"*\n\nHe turned north again, and every mountain, river, and road he passed was just as he had dreamed. After three days, he reached the foot of Phoenix Mountain. As he prepared a meal, a sudden downpour forced travelers to halt. After some time, a village woman entered, carrying firewood. When Yishou saw her and bowed, his heart stirred. He questioned her, and she was indeed his mother.

      "translated_text": "The raging flames that stretched across the heavens suddenly subsided,\nThe fierce winds that swept the earth swiftly shifted course.\nThe Ma woman’s corpse was burned while the Zhi woman was spared—\nThus did public judgment align with Heaven’s decree.\n\nIn Qi County lived a man named Zhi Zuyi, whose wife, née Yu, was twenty-five. Her mother-in-law, née Huang, was eighty and blind, sharp-tempered and fastidious, difficult to serve. Yet Yu, though young, was diligent, frugal, reverent, and compliant, able to please her—three years passed without a single harsh word between them. One day, her husband, drunk, accidentally knocked over a servant, knocking out two of his teeth. To avoid punishment, he paid compensation, and Yu, following him, contributed her dowry without regret.\n\nOne night, she dreamed that a spirit from the netherworld came to arrest and reprimand her: *\"In your past life, you were the wife of Mu Rong, a neighbor. At thirty, you fell gravely ill and lingered for over a year. Your mother-in-law, then over seventy, cooked porridge for you, but you, finding it bitter, refused to eat and complained of its frequency, scolding and weeping at her several times. On the day before your death, you cried out to Heaven before your mother-in-law: ‘Those over seventy do not die, yet I, at thirty, am made to perish—is Heaven unjust?’ The Director of Destinies reported this to Heaven, and the Emperor decreed that your corpse be burned. But your breath had already ceased, and the sentence was not carried out. The records remain, and after thirty years—a full cycle—your past karma must now be settled. You are fated to die beneath the axe of thunder. Tomorrow, await your fate. Yet because in this life you have been filial, I forewarn you.\"*\n\nYu awoke in terror, sitting up in the dead of night to wail. Her husband, a minor official, was away on business, and her mother-in-law said: *\"You claim my son has ruined your family’s wealth—do you think you can never repay it?\"* Yu replied, *\"No.\"* At dawn, she bathed, put on fresh clothes, and bowed to her mother-in-law: *\"Your daughter-in-law has served you for three years without merit. Today, I ask leave to return home briefly. I fear the unforeseen—if I die, I may not return. Mother, take care.\"* Her mother-in-law, bewildered by her strange words, let her go. Yu bid farewell to her parents, repeating the same words.\n\nStanding by the kitchen incense burner beneath a great tree south of the house, she looked to Heaven and prayed: *\"Your daughter-in-law’s death is the due of past karma—I do not refuse it. Yet I grieve for my poor husband and aged mother-in-law, who in their later years will lose their wife and daughter-in-law—who will care for them? First, this. Second, my parents, who raised and taught me, will be shamed by my execution. Third, I am seven months with child—if by chance it is a boy, the Zhi line will have an heir. Two of these I cannot escape, but for the sake of the Zhi line’s posterity, I beg a three-month reprieve before I die.\"*\n\nIt was the height of summer. Dark clouds blotted out the day, and wind and thunder clashed. The netherworld spirit later told me of this, and knowing her heart, I memorialized the matter. An edict came: *\"Take a wicked and rebellious one from the village to replace her.\"* The wife of the wealthy Zhang Shi, née Ma, was lewd, violent, and defiant, treating her mother- and father-in-law with disrespect and reducing her husband to servitude. I dispatched the netherworld spirit and the Spirit of Thunder and Fire to deal with her. In an instant, Yu was unharmed, while Zhang’s wife was burned to ashes.\n\n**Upholding Righteousness, Fifty-Eight**\nBrothers share one father’s blood—\nHow can kin be heartless?\nLi Hua’s care for Wei is laudable,\nWhile Yong Di’s bullying of Yuan is unjust.\nA broken arm reveals swift retribution,\nPublic praise earns a virtuous name.\nThus do shallow customs grow sincere,\nAnd the geese in formation fly in harmony, free from strife.\n\nIn the town of Shuiyi, the official Yong Di had a younger brother, Yuan, also in office. Though Yuan was often oppressed by Di, he served him as an elder with equanimity. Both had married sisters from the Liang family, and even the slightest household matters became grounds for contention. Over time, Di and Yuan became enemies, their wives bitter foes. Their parents could not restrain them, so they decided to divide the household. Di refused to let Yuan keep his own quarters, forcing him and his wife to leave with nothing, yet still demanding seasonal offerings. Soon after, Di encountered Yuan on the road and, enraged that he did not bow, beat him. Wounded, Yuan sued before the village magistrate, who found Di in the wrong. Di’s wife then stormed to Yuan’s door, dragged out her sister, and beat her, saying: *\"The law upholds elder and younger—one does not strike an elder for the sake of a younger!\"* The village sided against her.\n\nThe Confucian scholar Li Hua’s father, in his later years, had a son by a kitchen maid. On his deathbed, he entrusted the child to Hua, saying: *\"Raise him as your own.\"* Hua wept and replied: *\"Though his mother is lowly, he is of your blood. I will teach and raise him to be worthy, and the ancestral rites will be in order—Heaven is my witness.\"* He named the boy Wei and doted on him. When Wei grew up, he became a renowned scholar, and Hua arranged his marriage. Hua had another son, Mimming, ten years Wei’s senior. From the time Wei could speak, Hua had Mimming bow to him. As they grew, Hua treated Wei with a respect just below that due a father. Hua, his sons, and Wei were all recommended by the villagers to the prefect, then to the capital, where their merits were assessed. The post was awarded to Mimming. When Mimming misspoke to Wei, Hua beat him. Mimming accepted the rebuke, and soon after, Hua gave all his family’s wealth to Wei, saying: *\"My younger brother shall manage it. Mimming will have his official salary for support.\"* The villagers praised his virtue.\n\nDuring the autumn festival, I attended the gathering. The villagers compared Yong and Li as the foul and the fragrant. Hearing this, Di cursed and, sitting down, dragged Yuan over to beat him. Outraged, I ordered the spirits to twist and break his arm. Soon after, Di’s wife developed an abscess on her hand. For three years, their public and private affairs collapsed, their livelihood dwindled, and their parents died in succession. Di and his wife ended as beggars. The villagers saw this as the retribution for unrighteousness. The prefect, hearing of Li Hua’s conduct, honored him as *\"Upholder of Righteousness.\"*\n\n**Honoring the Reclusive, Fifty-Nine**\nWorldly customs most corrupt,\nDaily toil in dust obscures one’s true nature.\nMu Jun, who kept to the Dao, was blessed by Heaven,\nWhile Su Zi, who slighted his body, incurred even ghosts’ wrath.",

      "translated_text": "The profound words passed down serve as moral standards,\nTemples are built and sacrifices offered with grand splendor.\nScholars of Shu first revered the teachings of the Central Kingdom,\nAnd in a single day, vulgar Confucians transformed into the truly pure.\n\nSince Shu was annexed by Qin, the flourishing culture and teachings of the former kings and the transformative power of the great Dao gradually took root. Yet the simple and honest customs had not been revived, and the clamorous and frivolous thrived. Fearing harm to public morals, I resolved to transform them.\n\nOne day, in Ba Commandery’s Dangqu, the scholar Mou Lin was insatiable in learning and delighted in teaching others. He guarded the Dao with integrity and modesty, seldom leaving his home unless for grave matters. In his daily life, he received visitors but never paid calls himself. Though impoverished, he never uttered a word of complaint. The prefect, Wen Yu, summoned him to serve as an aide, but he declined. The assistant prefect, Yu, went to invite him in person. Their conversation lasted for hours, all on living in accord with the times, adapting to circumstances, nurturing oneself, and withdrawing from the world. Yu wished to convey the prefect’s intent but could not find the words. Finally, he left and reported to Wen Yu, who praised Mou Lin’s integrity.\n\nSu Shanggong had once studied under Mou Lin but did not complete his studies. He opened his doors to disciples, styling himself a master, yet his nature was restless and ambitious. His footsteps never rested, and he sought favors with obsequious flattery. Mou Lin despised this. When someone relayed Mou Lin’s reproach to him, Su Shanggong rushed to his door to argue. Mou Lin, still regarding himself as his former teacher, upheld the duty of a senior and said to him: *\"Life and death are a matter of fate; wealth and honor depend on Heaven.\"* These are the words of Zixia. *\"Seek it through the proper Way, and what you obtain is a matter of fate. Seeking brings no benefit to attainment.\"* These are the words of Ziyu. Your conduct, I truly find shameful.\n\nRelying on his youthful vigor, Su Shanggong struck Mou Lin. I happened to witness this and transformed into a scholar to mediate. Turning to the crowd, I said: *\"Longevity or early death, poverty or success—these are matters of fate, not of human effort. Those who scramble for gain without shame do not understand fate. If fate does not grant it, what use is seeking? Even if one occasionally obtains something through persistent pursuit, to believe that seeking guarantees success is to not understand the Dao. If one neither understands fate nor the Dao, then one’s principles are lost, and from this arise depravity, deceit, and all manner of unrighteousness—disloyalty, unfiliality, and worse. The conduct of these two men is as incompatible as ice and fire, marking the division between the noble and the petty.\"*\n\nThe onlookers gathered in a throng. Someone asked me: *\"Who are you?\"* I replied: *\"I am the one called Zhang Zhongzi.\"* The crowd stared in astonishment, and when they looked again, I had vanished without a trace. From then on, those near and far who heard of this—even men like Su Shanggong—reformed their ways, and a pure and honest custom flourished. The people of Dangqu built a temple for me.\n\n**Upholding Rectitude, Sixty**\nTo scheme for others’ wealth is already improper,\nHow much worse to harbor deceitful intentions.",

      "translated_text": "**On Killing Living Beings (Chapter Sixty-One)**\nAll creatures that move and breathe possess fate,\nFearing death and craving life as men do too.\nYet for the taste of marrow, fat, and flesh,\nThey cast them onto cleavers, cauldrons, and flames.\nHeedless of vengeful souls that trail like shadows,\nThey know only the savor that pleases the throat.\nDu Zhang enjoyed the fortune of past lives,\nBut when karmic retribution came, it was not in vain.\n\nIn Qiong there lived Du Zhang, a descendant of King Wang of Shu. Born into wealth and nobility, his parents indulged in feasting and revelry as their custom. Every act of butchery and carving, Zhang performed himself. As he grew, he took charge of the household’s kitchen, never a day passing without his hand wielding the knife. No sooner had the roasted meat left his lips than the chopping block was already in his grasp.\n\nLater, misfortune struck in succession, and his family’s fortunes declined. Left with no means of survival, he became a butcher and executioner to feed himself. The wealth he took from others was called \"life-money,\" exceeding its due. His gluttony grew insatiable, and his voracious appetite bred illness. No sooner was he full than hunger returned, yet his craving for meat remained unchecked. Daily, he fell short of his desires. He cast nets to catch fish, used slings to shoot birds, and whatever flew or ran before him stirred his murderous intent.\n\nIn middle age, he fathered five sons, all born without fingers. Pressed by debt and the burden of \"life-money,\" he could not make ends meet. Desperate and forlorn, he contracted a loathsome disease—his skin split open, oozing pus and blood, so foul that passersby covered their noses.\n\nTormented by hunger’s fire and afflicted by suffering, he threw himself into a well, only to be dragged out and cursed vehemently. Then, gazing heavenward, he cried out in grievance.\n\nI witnessed this and, astonished, questioned Sun Hong, the local domain master, who recounted the details. He added that though Du Zhang’s allotted years had ended, his life still had five years remaining. Knowing the cause of his karmic deeds and pitying the severity of his suffering—yet with many years still ahead—I feared his daily resentment and anger toward the Celestial Emperor. Thus, I dispatched a Merit Officer to alter his heart and will. He was made to peel the scabs from his own sores and eat them, to dip his fingers into pus and blood, sucking and savoring the taste, then declare to others: *\"Do not commit the sin of killing—take me as your warning!\"*\n\nThus, for over a year, he endured until his allotted time was fulfilled. His breath ceased, and all his sons perished as well.\n\n---\n\n**On Cruelty (Chapter Sixty-Two)**\nGongsun Wuzhong governed with integrity,\nYet his floggings of clerks lacked true severity.\nLai En, by grace, released his subordinates,\nBut his rapacity toward the people knew no end.\nA transformed self served as the sole admonition,\nA change to leniency brought dual benefit.\nCurbing excess to supplement deficiency,\nBoth clerks and commoners reaped the blessing.\n\nThe magistrate of Niu Bing County, Gongsun Wuzhong, ruled himself with incorruptibility but treated others without mercy. The slightest fault in his subordinates earned them one or two hundred lashes. After a year in office, not a single clerk remained unscarred, and they resented him bitterly.\n\nThe magistrate of Zi Shui County, Lai En, was by nature greedy and habitually accepted bribes. His daily food and drink, seasonal clothing, and adornments were all supplied by his clerks. When commoners came to his court, regardless of right or wrong, he consigned them to prison, allowing his clerks to extort them at will. Only when his desires were sated would he act; if the clerks remained unsatisfied, he would delay for months or even abandon the case entirely. The people despised him.\n\nI saw the suffering of the clerks and commoners in these two counties and transformed myself into Changsun Yi, the assistant prefect of Shu Commandery. I toured the counties to observe their customs and impeached Wuzhong for his cruelty to clerks and Lai En for his oppression of the people. Both magistrates kowtowed, begging for mercy. I admonished and exhorted them, then vanished without a trace.\n\nLater, they learned that the assistant prefect had never visited the counties. Both counties came to revere me as a divine being, and Wuzhong reformed, governing with loyalty and forbearance, while Lai En also transformed, becoming incorrupt and upright.\n\n---\n\n**On Pitying the World (Chapter Sixty-Three)**\nThe House of Zhou collapsed into inhumanity,\nAs the Ji clan’s rule gave way to Qin’s tyranny.\nHarsh punishments and brutal clerks stifled harmony,\nDeceitful schemes and endless wars—how many springs?\nUnable to bear the Central Plains’ suffering,\nI wished to open my heart to save its people.\nHeaven’s decree granted assent,\nAnd after the storm, the world was renewed.\n\nI once served the Zhou, offering loyalty unto death, and received sacrifices in Shu. Before long, Shu fell to Qin, and soon after, the Zhou lost the realm—all to the House of Ying.\n\nQin relied on harsh laws, treating the people as grass and weeds. When Qin declined, warfare erupted anew, and the Central Plains suffered in devastation for years.\n\nHaving long dwelled in tranquility, I yearned to relieve the people’s suffering. Thus, I submitted a memorial to the Celestial Emperor, who granted my request, saying: *\"The son of the White Emperor has wandered the mortal realm for too long, steeped in slaughter. Now, I have sent the son of the Red Emperor to replace him. You, as the original minister of Fire Virtue, shall now respond to the world as the successor to the Red Emperor’s son.\"* I accepted the mandate.\n\n---\n\n**On Xianyang (Chapter Sixty-Four)**\nFortune favored my protection of all Shu,\nYet worldly ties compelled me to emerge.\nSlander thwarted my succession,\nAnd my death left only enmity.\nA king’s title, thin as fate, brought no gain,\nWhile my mother’s bitter suffering never ceased.\nHow I longed to take the form of a *shuairan*,\nTo devour the Lü clan and end my sorrow!\n\nMy plea to Heaven had been to transform myself and lift the world from its suffering, guiding its people to harmony and joy. Unexpectedly, the Emperor decreed that I should succeed the son of the Red Emperor. The Jade Edict inspired awe, and I dared not refuse. Reflecting in stillness, I knew this was not my desire.\n\nSuddenly, the Great Deity of the Nine Heavens’ Surveillance pressed me to be reborn. From the clouds, I gazed down upon the newly built palaces of Xianyang, where the Fire-Qin’s successor now ruled. The Han Emperor was conversing with Lady Qi Zhao. The surveillance deity urged me: *\"This is the so-called son of the Red Emperor—now the Han Emperor.\"* As I looked on, the deity forced me forward, and I tumbled into Lady Qi’s embrace. In a daze, I awoke.\n\nThe Emperor, seeing my birthmarks and bearing, found me delightful and named me Ruyi. Though still an infant, my original resolve remained firm. My speech and glances pleased the Emperor greatly, and he doted on me, often calling my elder brother unlike him and treating him with disdain. In his later years, he wished to make me his heir, but it did not come to pass. After the Emperor’s death, I was ultimately killed by the Lü clan. My mother’s end was even more cruel, and I harbored deep resentment.\n\nWhen I later saw her suffering in the netherworld, I longed to take the form of a *shuairan* and devour the Lü clan to the last.",

      "translated_text": "**Lake Qiong, Sixty-Fifth**\n\nTo rely on power and bully others is never to be done—\nAn innocent mother and child were put to death.\nThe grievance I bore sank deep into the earth,\nA hatred so profound it could not share the sky.\nThe Lü clan’s later lives dwelt in the same town,\nTheir parents begging for mercy in that very hour.\nThe sea’s waves leveled forty *li* of land,\nRepaying all the hundred sorrows I once endured.\n\nAfter suffering the Lü clan’s calamity, my spirit wandered the netherworld, unbound by any office. I harbored long-held resentment and yearned for vengeance, yet my past deeds of cultivation had faded from concern. Though the Lü clan had died and been confined to the dark realms, their karmic burden ran deep, spanning many years. Even after their rebirths, much time had passed. I sought them along the western sea’s shores, where a town named Qiong lay. Its magistrate, Lü Mou, was the Lü empress’s later incarnation, and many of its people bore the Lü surname—old karmic ties drawing them together, the Lü clan’s accomplices, now gathered in this desolate land.\n\nMy mother, the Lady, was also reborn there, once more as a Qi. Having enjoyed excessive fortune in her past life, she was now poor and emaciated. She married a man named Zhang, old and childless. The couple lived by cutting grass. One day, they spoke to each other in the wilds: *\"Our lives are so straitened, we toil to sustain ourselves. Now, in our twilight years, our strength wanes—we shall surely perish in some ditch. Sixty years old and still without a child—does Heaven mean to destroy us?\"* They cut their arms and let blood drip into a stone’s hollow, covering it with the rock. Kneeling to Heaven, they prayed: *\"All others have children; only we are barren. Our qi and blood are meager, unable to nurture life. If some creature should stir beneath this stone, let it be born of our flesh.\"* I sensed my mother’s earnest longing, and moved by her plea, I took form there.\n\nThe next day, the old couple returned and lifted the stone. The blood had transformed into a golden snake, a hand’s span in length—my doing. My mother took me in and raised me. A year later, horns sprouted from my head, and legs grew beneath my belly. I could change my form at will. Whenever rain threatened, I aided the skies. As I grew, my body expanded, my appetite vast. I devoured sheep, pigs, dogs, and horses on sight. The magistrate owned a fine, swift horse, grazing by the water. Its hoof injured my tail, so I seized and ate it—the horse was Lü Chan’s later incarnation.\n\nThe townsfolk knew of me. They searched my home in vain, then imprisoned my parents, demanding they produce me within three days or face execution. The next day, I transformed into a scholar and petitioned the magistrate for their release. He said: *\"The old Zhangs keep a demonic snake that has long preyed on livestock. Now it has eaten my horse. I will kill it to rid the people of this scourge.\"* When the Zhangs were not heeded, he declared: *\"They have become demons themselves. They must die.\"*\n\nI replied: *\"Life repays life—this is the work of past karma. Their devouring was no accident. If you, as a magistrate, kill humans for the sake of an animal, is this justice?\"* The magistrate shouted for me to withdraw. I pressed on: *\"Your face bears the mark of death. Take care for yourself, lest you regret it later.\"* With that, I vanished. The magistrate’s attendants called me a demon. I then appealed to Heaven, recounting how my mother and I had been wrongly slain by the Lü clan in a past life, and how I had now encountered them again. I vowed to settle the score. My plea ascended, but no reply came.\n\nI summoned wind and thunder, inhaled clouds and mist, turning day to night. The townsfolk stared at one another, saying: *\"Why does your head look like a fish?\"* They touched their faces and wept. That night, I raised the sea’s waters as rain, flooding the town. Forty *li* of land sank. I bore my parents to safety on my back. This occurred in the reign of Emperor Xiaoxuan—what is now called the Sunken River.\n\n**Liberation, Sixty-Sixth**\n\nThe heart’s wrath arises all too easily,\nAnd where it stirs, ignorance takes root.\nOne knows the truth is plain enough to plead,\nYet without waiting for decree, one acts.\nExiled to a massive form, scorched by heat,\nRepaying karmic debts to soothe the wronged.\nA single word from the World-Honored One\nDissolves my lingering karma—my true face restored.\n\nIn my earlier confrontation with the Lü clan, I had petitioned the Emperor but received no reply, so I took matters into my own hands. Though my long-held rage was vented in that moment, when my heart settled and my mind grew calm, deep regret took hold. The next day, a jade decree descended: the Sea God Chao Hong had accused me of misusing the sea’s waters, drowning over five hundred households—more than two thousand lives. Excluding the eighty-odd souls who had been my past-life enemies (half in the city god’s precinct, half in the outskirts), the rest were innocent, cut down before their time. The Emperor commanded that I be demoted to the dragon of Lake Qiong, stripped of my divine office, and placed under celestial overseers. I was forbidden to partake in rainmaking, imprisoned beneath stagnant waters. Years of drought followed, and the water turned to mud. My vast body had no burrow to shelter in. The scorching sun beat down, tormenting me inside and out. From my eighty-four thousand scales, countless tiny worms emerged, gnawing without end. I writhed in agony, losing track of the seasons.\n\nOne morning, as a cool breeze stirred, the sky suddenly parted, revealing five-colored clouds drifting past. Within them appeared an auspicious sign: coiled hair bound in a topknot, a golden countenance like the moon, wondrous and rare, radiant with light. Mountain spirits and river lords, myriad beings bowed in reverence, their voices of praise and joy shaking heaven and earth. Heavenly incense curled through the air, celestial blossoms scattered, and spring bloomed wherever they fell. My ears and eyes grew sharp, my nose keen, my heart clear, my mouth moist, my voice resonant. I lifted my head and wailed, begging for deliverance.\n\nThe host of sacred beings before and behind me spoke: *\"This is the World-Honored One, the Tathāgata Śākyamuni Buddha, the Perfectly Awakened One of the West. His teachings now spread through the Eastern Lands. He takes form to teach and transform, journeying to the Middle Kingdom. Since you have encountered him, your past karma may be dissolved.\"* Stirred by remorse and compassion, I leapt into the divine light and recounted the principles of karmic retribution from my past.",

      "translated_text": "Having escaped the evil destinies, I was at once reborn in goodness, taking form in Zhao as the son of Zhang Yu, named Xun. When grown, I was commended by the Bureau of Merit and appointed Magistrate of Qinghe. Assuming the role with leniency and clarity, none dared deceive me. I treated officials as colleagues and friends, and regarded the people as family. Those among the clerks who erred, I corrected; those who slackened, I encouraged; those who acted rashly, I instructed; those who were greedy, I scrutinized; those who were deceitful, I challenged; and those who ignored edicts, I dismissed.\n\nOnly those who bent the law to harm the people, turning white to black, and whose deeds touched upon human life—I made them argue their own cases. Only when their words were exhausted and their hearts spent did I deliver them to the law. Even then, if their initial circumstances were pitiable, I still granted them leniency. The fines for their transgressions I bore myself, refusing to shirk the burden.\n\nWhen the people disputed wealth, I settled it with righteousness; when they clashed over rites and laws, I enlightened them with compassion. Thieves were made to repay their stolen goods; those who injured others were made to bow in the courtyard before their victims. Those who committed adultery or murder were handed over to the law, yet if their original intent was forgivable, I still released them. Though I endured slander for harboring evil, I did not shrink from it.\n\nThus, within my jurisdiction, rain and sunshine came in due season, locusts and pests did not arise, thieves and bandits warned one another to leave the region, and the wicked reformed their ways. After five years in office, no grievances were heard. The four classes of people composed a song in praise:\n\n*We have a teacher, stern yet not unkind—*\n*who teaches and forgives, Lord Zhang does this.*\n*We have a friend, trustworthy yet not stern—*\n*who draws near and guides us, Lord Zhang we rely on.*\n*We have a mother, whose kindness veils her justice—*\n*Lord Zhang resembles her, tender yet not indulgent.*\n*We have an elder brother, whose reproofs are just—*\n*Lord Zhang resembles him, harmonious yet not contentious.*\n\nLater, I was promoted to Governor, but urged to seek higher office, I resigned my post—this was at the end of Emperor Zhang’s *Yuanhe* reign.\n\n**Hidden and Manifest, Sixty-Eighth**\nDevote yourself wholly to the Dao, and the Dao abides;\nsteadfastly seek benevolence, and benevolence is achieved.\nOnly when the nature is settled can day and night be traversed;\nonly when the spirit is whole can the hidden and manifest be governed.\nLin Zong loved his son, yet upheld public judgment;\nthe Emperor’s decree conveyed words without concealment.\nAfter thirty years of toil, my merits bore fruit—\nno harm in the unseen workings that hasten the birth of drought.\n\nAs my family’s virtuous governance had borne fruit and our blessed karma flourished, my heavenly years having just run their course, I was at once given form again. During Emperor Shun’s *Yonghe* era, I was reborn into this world as the one called Zhang Xiaozhong, still not forgetting my former name. Once more, I was appraised by Guo Youdao. Though I did not rise to high office, drifting among the common folk, the Celestial Emperor issued a decree, bidding me attend to worldly affairs by day and govern the hidden and manifest by night. All the grievances, oppressions, and hidden virtues of people—I knew and recorded them. Even the spirits of the dead and malevolent specters were not beyond my purview. For thirty years thus, I aided both the seen and unseen, benefiting both humans and ghosts—I had rendered service.\n\n**Strategic Planning, Sixty-Ninth**\nMy heart holds both martial and literary grace,\na single inch of mind discerns ten thousand forms.\nWhen the precious mandate turned to the Sima clan,\nI briefly aided General Deng with military counsel.\n\"Deploy the unexpected, inquire of the Dao—execute my plan!\"\nExhausting myself on the battlefield to protect the imperial merit.\nThe historian’s records may omit my deeds,\nyet what harm if my strategies remain unheard?\n\nAs my family’s virtuous deeds accumulated across generations, I gradually regained my divine office. Yet those whose karmic debts to me remained unpaid still did not leave me be. Reborn in Heshuo, I was young and proud in spirit, witnessing the world’s upheavals. Aspiring to merit and fame, I was recognized by Grand General Deng Ai, who summoned me as an aide. In all his strategic undertakings, I was always involved.\n\nIn the year of the campaign against Shu, I served as Deng Ai’s Field Marshal. I urged him to take a secret route and strike unexpectedly, sparing the carnage of arrows and blades. Penetrating deep into Shu’s territory, we encountered Zhuge Zhan. I offered him the kingship of Langye, but he refused to listen. When battle was joined, it was I who faced Zhuge Zhan’s vanguard. A stray arrow, swift as a shooting star, struck my body. As Zhan was about to be captured, I wished to rescue him, but my wounds were too severe. This was the retribution for the unpaid debt from the former life at Kouchi—how could I not take heed?\n\n**Ruyi, Seventieth**\nIn what year did the Emperor’s hand first wield it?\nOne day, the Jade Capital bestowed it upon the terrace.\nDirecting the ranks, the hidden troops emerge;\nbeckoning the foe, their malevolent intent shifts.\nA companion of sharp instruments in ordinary times,\nits old name is sometimes still called.\nFrom now on, wherever it points, all is as wished—\nwhat spirit in the Three Realms dares deceive?\n\nHaving fulfilled my past karma, I was summoned to the Jade Capital, where my name was cleansed from the register of evil and my divine rank renewed. Entrusted with eternal blessings for the earthly realm, the Emperor then bestowed upon me the staff he wielded. His decree proclaimed: *\"Rely on you, Xiaozhong, hero of the myriad spirits, whose loyalty and filial piety are complete, whose merits serve the world. Examine this staff—nothing is beyond its reach.\"*\n\nHe added: *\"This is the* ruyi*. By this staff, your past name is fulfilled.\"* I joyfully received it.\n\n**Dingwei, Seventy-First**",

waned.\nSeeing villagers pray for rain before wooden idols, I laughed—\nfor I had once dreamed of such a report.\n\nOne day, by the water’s edge, I wrote my official title in a missive to the Sea God.\nThen a messenger came to me, saying:\n“Since taking form in the Zhou, you have been reborn seventy-three times,\nand now your transformations are manifest.”\nHe called me *Yunpan*, urging me to mount a white donkey.\nAmid the roar of wind and rain, my homeland vanished in an instant.\nI entered a vast cavern, its halls bright and spacious,\nwhere my parents and kin all gathered.\nThat very night, a great rain fell across all Shu—\nfor I had been decreed to oversee its affairs of dark and light.\n\n**Osmanthus Register, Seventy-Third**\nThe Confucian *Osmanthus Register* belongs to

Lin’an, the sun bore a double halo—\nall omens of revival.\nI changed my guise to a scholar, mounted a white donkey,\nand journeyed to Hexi to answer the *Filial and Incorrupt* summons,\npaying homage to Zhang Gui.\n\n**Moved by the Times, Seventy-Fifth**\nI prepared to join the local scholars in presenting my talents,\ndelighted to meet Yao Chang—unmatched even in ancient times.\nTo stir the stagnant tide, I wielded sole command;\nhow dare I shirk loyalty’s duty, entrusting it to others?\n\nUnfit to scheme with the three cunning ministers,\nI laughed at grand designs, answering a single call.\nWhen my purpose was fulfilled, I returned early to Shu,\nmy light carriage turning aside to visit my humble abode.\n\nIn the final years of *Jianxing*, I became the scholar Xie Ai,\nriding a donkey into Western Liang.\nZhang Gui appointed me as his secretary;\nwhen Zhang Chonghua succeeded him,\nShi Jilong sent his general Ma Qiu to invade relentlessly,\nshaking Liangzhou.\nThe prefectural marshal Zhang Dan said to Chonghua:\n“Those who recommend generals all favor the long-serving,\nyet Han Xin and Rang Ju were not old hands.\nIn your lordship’s judgment, only talent matters.\nSecretary Xie Ai is both civil and martial—\nentrust him with sole command of the campaign.”\n\nChonghua summoned Ai to ask his strategy.\nAi replied: “Geng Yan did not leave the enemy to his lord and father;\nHuang Quan wished to face the foe with ten thousand men.\nGrant me a few thousand soldiers, and I will devour them for Your Highness.”\nChonghua was overjoyed and gave Ai thirty thousand infantry and cavalry to attack.\nMa Qiu led his forces to resist.\nAi rode in a light carriage, wearing a white headscarf, beating drums as he advanced.\nQiu, enraged, said: “Ai is a young scholar in such attire—he belittles me!”\nHe ordered three thousand *Black-Spear Dragon-Soarers* to charge.\nHis officers panicked and urged Ai to retreat, but he refused.\nDismounting, he sat on a camp stool, directing the battle.\nThe enemy, fearing an ambush, dared not advance.\nQiu’s army withdrew, and Ai pursued, capturing and slaying many.\nQiu fled alone in the night.\n\nWhen Jilong heard of this, he sighed:\n“I subdued the Nine Provinces with a single army,\nyet now the Nine Provinces’ strength is thwarted by Chonghua—\ntruly, the tide has turned.”\n\nLater, I traveled to Guanzhong to befriend Yao Chang,\nhoping to stir the stagnant tide and rectify customs.\nBut tyrannical rulers rose in succession, usurping and murdering.\nThough Chang was young, he was full of schemes—\nand we had a bond from past lives, so I became his close friend.\n\nAfter some time, weary of the mortal world, I longed for Shu’s peaks.\nI made a pact with Chang: “If either attains wealth and rank, do not forget the other.”\nLater, Chang was sent to Shu as a general.\nAt Fengshan, he visited me, and I received him with courtesy,\nlending him an iron *ruyi*.\nI instructed him: “Wave it to summon troops.”\nChang doubted me, so I waved it once—\nbanners blotted out the sky, and ten thousand armored soldiers\nwith spears and shields lined the plain.\nThis is the present-day *Trial Troops

That very night, Commander Feng Qian dreamed of Wang Zai coming to pay his respects—yet beneath his official robes trailed an ox’s tail. Startled awake, he found a maidservant also in the grip of a nightmare. When she came to, she recounted how Wang’s messenger had appeared to her, an ox’s tail protruding from beneath his robes. Again and again, she spoke of his oppressive extortion and corrupt greed, declaring that he was now reborn in the fields of a Shu district, in the household of a farmer named Tian.\n\nThe next day, Feng sent men to investigate, and all was just as the dream had foretold.\n\nThere was also Ma E of Yichang, another of the commander’s subordinates. Whenever he was dispatched to the prefectures to oversee tax collection, he prized only the quantity extracted, never questioning whether the quotas were excessive or the circumstances lean or prosperous. He demanded strict adherence to deadlines and took pride in his ruthlessness. The people of Shu suffered under his cruelty and called him “Ma the Scraper.”\n\nWhen someone warned him with Wang’s ox-tail omen, Ma replied, “Even if I were to grow a tail in this life, why should I care?”\n\nHearing of such tyranny, I reported it to the Celestial Court. Soon after, Ma fell ill and died. Within seven days, as his family prepared the post-burial offerings, they heard sounds from within the coffin. Thinking he might have revived, they hastily opened it—only to find he had transformed into a pig. They quickly sealed the coffin and buried him.\n\nThat day, the sky was clear and bright as the funeral procession set out, but suddenly a torrential rain poured down, forcing the mourners to halt. By the time they reached the gravesite, the water had risen to their necks. Let this serve as a warning to all corrupt officials.\n\n**Passing the Examinations, No. 77**\nIn Tongchuan, I long immersed myself in milfoil divination,\nwhile the Daoist teachings and Confucian orthodoxy sank into obscurity.",

The Emperor, desiring to restore royal transformation, renewed the ancient mandate. Born into a Tongchuan family, I knew the Sui dynasty’s fate neared its end, and our Way remained unfulfilled. Retreating to the lands between the Fen and Yellow Rivers, I cultivated the legacy of the former kings—composing rites to temper the passions, crafting music to harmonize customs, expanding penal governance to curb transgressions, and exalting sacrifices to invoke blessings. Following the footsteps of Zhou and Confucius, modeling myself after Mengzi and Yang Xiong, I completed the *Canon* in nine years. Of the Five Constants’ teachings, what could I impart to the young? I entrusted the study of rites and music to Dong Chang, lamenting that his talents were never employed in the court of Emperor Taizong.

Thus, I bade my eldest son, Yuanshi, be born into the Qinghe Li family—he was Jiuling. In Minghuang’s reign, Li Linfu slandered the Su clan, yet the Emperor relied on them unshaken. When debates flourished, Jiuling first ascended the Seven Treasures Mountain, seated among literary champions and masters of extemporaneous eloquence. Later, during the Youzhou rebellion, Minghuang fled to Shu, carving through Sword Ridge to gaze upon the Central Plains, sighing: *“Had I listened to Jiuling, I would not have come to this.”* I then arrived at the Bridge of Ten Thousand Li and sought an audience as a scholar. The Emperor asked: *“Are you not Zhang of Beiguo?”* I replied: *“Yes. I hear Yuan Zai and Kong have ascended to heaven, leaving the throne vacant for Your Majesty.”* The Emperor fell silent. After Suzong reclaimed the capital, Wei Jiansu welcomed the Emperor’s return to the palace. He enfeoffed me as Right Chancellor, but I secretly escorted the imperial carriage to Xianyang. The Emperor moved to the Great Inner Palace to convalesce, then ceased eating. Zhang the Empress offered cherry and sugarcane juice, but he consumed none. Often, he played a purple jade flute, blowing a few notes—whereupon a pair of cranes descended and circled the courtyard. The Emperor told his beloved attendants: *“I follow the Heavenly Emperor’s command to dwell in the realm where Yuan Zai and Kong ascended. Prepare my bath.”* He then retired to bed and ascended in transformation.\n\n**Manifesting Might, No. 79**\nLuminous echoes, their principles traceable—\nhow could past heavens ever trespass upon the realm of things?",

Might I offer her to you in marriage?” I replied: “Your servant is but a recluse—how dare I accept such an honor?” The Emperor said: “Do not refuse so firmly.” Thereupon he enfeoffed me as King Shunji, came in person to the temple to offer sacrifice, and unbuckled his sword as a gift. He entrusted me with the task of suppressing the rebels. Later, Song Wentong and others slew Huang Chao and sent his head to Chengdu. When the Emperor returned to the capital, the Princess of Rising Tang had already passed away. I ordered troops to escort her remains back to Qiqu.\n\n**Eightieth: The Way of Salvation Obscured**\nThe world’s principles decline, salvation’s path grows strange,\nSpirits and mortals mingle, transforming into dust.\nThe foolish call me delusion, the blind debate my right and wrong.\nChaotic clouds blanket the earth, heavy rains flood the land,\nWhile flames stretch across the sky, blazing with radiant light.\nOnly then did Sun Qiao begin to believe in divine might—\nFrom this moment, my blessings and power manifest throughout the realm.\n\nDuring the Five Dynasties, a scholar named Sun Qiao, upright and unyielding, shunned company and reviled Buddhism and Daoism. He wrote *On the Nonexistence of Ghosts*. Traveling from Long to Shu, he passed beneath my shrine, insulting it with utmost disrespect before departing. Upon reaching the mountain’s shade, the sky suddenly darkened, and wind and rain lashed like scattered arrows. No traveler could advance, nor could they find shelter. He cried out: “If this is indeed Zhang Jun, the Recluse of Beiguo, and if you possess any power, show me the way!” I commanded my divine attendants to display a few torches. Sun Qiao laughed: “A temple slave deceives me!” He called again: “If you are truly a spirit, why not halt the wind and rain so I may reach level ground?” I smiled and said: “You have mocked every shrine you passed, calling them false and laughing at their claims. Now, what use is regret?” I revealed hundreds of torches, illuminating the mountains and rivers so his retinue could proceed. In an instant, the wind and rain ceased. The next day, he left a record at the temple.\n\n**Eighty-Second: Loyalty Manifest**\nThe flourishing celestial mandate blessed the imperial court,\nYet rebellious Qiang tribes and Shu demons stirred chaos.\nTheir clamorous followers overran prefectures and counties,\nWhile bandits and rogues wove webs of sedition.\nSuddenly, brave warriors cried out, summoning the power of hidden troops—\nArrows pierced flesh and bone, yet their spirits soared.\nLike wooden horses drenched in sweat, swift reports arrived,\nAnd heavenly grace descended, covering the outskirts of the capital.\n\nDuring the rebellion of Wang Jun and Li Shun, the commander Lei Shouzhong prayed for my aid with divine soldiers. I entered Shu and reached Lizhou, where the rebels had fortified their ramparts. Vice-General Wang Ji shouted to the enemy: “I am commanded by heaven to suppress you—surrender!” The rebels shot him with a powerful crossbow, piercing his abdomen. Yet he cheered as if unharmed, and when medicine was applied, he suffered no ill effects. The commander fared likewise. The court enfeoffed me as King Yingxian, and upon reporting my deeds to heaven, I was confirmed as King Dinghui of Perfect Wisdom.\n\n**Eighty-Third: Sagely Governance**\nThe peace of Tang and Yu’s virtuous rule perfumed the age,\nIts governance fragrant as the Great Beginning’s dawn.\nThe Four Barbarians submitted to the radiance of virtue’s teaching,\nWhile the people rested secure under laws and models.\nMinisters of talent, their collars aligned, knew the wise,\nAnd great scholars, untangling knotted roots, displayed their learning.\nMy son aided in perfecting the governance of Yuan You,\nAnd his writings served as mirrors for the realm.\n\nDuring the reigns of the First Ancestor and Four Emperors of the imperial dynasty, the realm enjoyed profound peace. I received a divine decree: my second son, born to the Sima family and named Guang, served with utmost sincerity in the academy. He compiled histories of all ages to serve as lessons for the world. He assisted the Empress Dowager Xuanren Shenglie, who, though she never left the palace curtains, governed the realm. All affairs were well-ordered, and all praised her virtue as vast as heaven and earth, her Dao as penetrating as the divine. Through accumulated kindness and piled-up virtue, she approached the glory of the Zhou and Shao ministers.\n\n**Eighty-Fourth: Displaying Loyalty**\nThe Founding Ancestor’s establishment was wondrous as a god,\nWhile I, lacking his virtue, spared the realm from war.\nThe sacred halls of Lantian once preserved the jade,\nAnd the western shrines of Fen and Jin bound their cords in reverence.\nThe Khitan at Chanyuan were pacified by the might of the caitiff-slayer,\nAnd the True Emperor’s eastern works laid the foundation of blessings.\nNow, long estranged from the world, I laugh and point to Zhuya—\nAnother expedition awaits.\n\nDue to the world’s shifting tides, I dwelled in seclusion for a long time. Yet at the founding of the imperial dynasty, a figure arose—none other than Kou Zhun. Later, during the Chanyuan campaign, he established the merit of the Benevolent Ancestor, and I played my part. But then, they accused me of falsehood and banished me across the sea to Zhuya.

the Two Shu were stilled,\nAnd grace flowed deep through the Three Gorges’ currents.\nTo recognize this divine marvel:\nWithin the coffin, his body remained whole, untouched by earth.\n\nIn the *dingsi* year of Shaosheng, I entrusted my transformation to Zhang Jun,\nWho stood as a paragon for the age.\nAt Pingjiang, the restoration was achieved,\nAnd the Sagely Son of Heaven reigned for over forty years.\nYet at Fuping’s defeat, the fault was not Jun’s—\nIt was Heaven’s design.\n\nIn the *jiashen* year of Longxing, Jun died and was buried in Hengyang.\nHis son Shao wished to rebury him in Shu.\nWhen the coffin was opened, his majestic countenance remained as in life.\nThe gentry of the prefecture gathered like a wall,\nMany pressing their hands to their brows in awe.\nThus, they sealed the coffin again.\nHad this not been my divine transformation, how could such a thing occur?\n\nI once wielded the Son of Heaven’s authority in Shu,\nHolding the mandate of Wenchang’s office in Heaven.\nMy merits were not unworthy.\n\n**Eighty-Sixth: Knowing Restraint (continued)**\nThe Jade Register bestowed praise, its radiant favor gleaming,\nExalting the master’s transmission as the primal guiding principle.\nAccumulated merit delights in cultivating Heaven’s longevity,\nWhile bearing the mandate, how could one refuse to uphold the imperial decree?\nIn governance, diligence alone abides in the Supreme Ultimate,\nAnd recommending the worthy is the duty of Wenchang’s lord.\nBestowing upon the people the Five Blessings, hoping for peace and prosperity—\nThis is no mere trifling matter of rain or shine.\n\nIn the Longxing year, I received the Jade Edict, raising my rank:\n*\"Wenchang is the root and origin of teaching and transformation,\nTruly the legacy of the successive sages.\nThe literati are the wellspring of virtue and power,\nAnd should unfold their single-minded loyalty.\nProclaim this to all heavens,\nThat trust may be firmly established among the multitudes.\nNow, the Perfected Lord of Wenchang’s Office of Longevity and Examinations,\nThe Guardian of the People and Junior Tutor,\nThe Spiritually Responsive Emperor Zhang—\nYour virtue blankets the myriad things,\nYour might shapes the four quarters.\nSince your birth, you have manifested through vast kalpas,\nFollowing the ancient Dao in scrutiny of human culture.\nYour illumination rivals the sun and moon,\nYour generation aids Heaven and Earth’s transformation.\nThus, you taught the people to till and nurture,\nAnd in every regulation, you excelled.\nYou cultivated ritual and music, bringing governance to harmony.\nYour plans were never amiss,\nAnd weapons were laid to rest.\nYin and yang remained balanced,\nWater and earth were pacified,\nAuspicious omens arrived in due season.\nEntrusted with myriad affairs,\nTested by countless trials,\nYou have always succeeded with distinction,\nEver more capable with each task.\nOnce, as Water Transport Commissioner, you ascended to the Terrace of Balance,\nStill holding the heart to relieve suffering,\nVowing to rescue those in dire straits.\nYour achievements were towering,\nBeyond description.\nSurveying over ninety transformations in your conduct,\nYour deeds were recorded in the registers,\nInscribed in twelve thousand acts of integrity.\nThis is no empty text—\nWhen the realm totters, you uphold it;\nWhen it falters, you steady it.\nEvil is punished, good is encouraged,\nAnd the people truly rely on your blessings.\nMoreover, you have expanded the charts of Longhan,\nElucidated the canons of Luantai,\nAspiring to manifest your transformations by dividing your body,\nLeading the sages in harmonious fusion.\nThe ten thousand Brahma realms unfold,\nAnd the Three Realms share in the benefit.\nIt is fitting to elevate your rank,\nTo accord with the people’s will.\nLet your name ascend to the veneration of the Southern Culmen,\nYour rites surpassing the stellar constellations.\"*\n\nAlas!\nAscending the three ranks below the Great One,\nYour responsiveness to the world has long been manifest.\nGathering the Five Blessings to bestow upon the people,\nWe rely on your words as our guide.\nWho else is capable?\nGo forth and reverently obey:\nYou are hereby specially appointed as the Golden Watchtower’s Supreme Master of the Vast Heaven,\nOverseeing the Three Realms’ weal and woe.\n\nMy memorial in response briefly stated:\n*\"Fearful of overreaching, I have trespassed upon Your luminous wisdom.\nMy humble words, though measured, still seek instruction.\nHow dare I claim incompetence,\nYet still hope for Your assent?\"*\n\nIn my gratitude, I reflected:\n*\"My virtue is meager, my rank exalted,\nMy words light, my conduct scant.\nYet in offering my sincerity,\nI harbor no private thought of retreat.\nIn this flourishing age,\nI have been doubly favored with extraordinary grace.\nShould I not rejoice in such lofty bestowal?\nYet I also fear the calamity of ultimate ruin.\nReverently considering the Heavenly Honored One—\nThe Dao is good at lending and completing,\nIts luminous radiance surely illumines all.\nIt guards against minor flaws and oversights,\nFor the words from within shall be bent toward benevolence.\nWhat objection could there be to this decree?\"*\n\nAfter thrice declining, I accepted,\nAnd was further entrusted with overseeing the weal and woe of the four quarters,\nThus dividing my body to respond to transformations.\n\n**Eighty-Seventh: Admonishing Rebellion**\nSecretly bearing the imperial decree from the azure heavens,\nRevealing to the mortal realm the equal balance of fortune and misfortune.\nHarmonizing the scales with clear discernment,\nRevolving the guiding principles to weave the grand design.\nThe Outer Terrace wields the authority of life and death,\nWhile in Shu, observing customs, it holds the pivot of transformation.\nThe thunder shook the Central River’s Wang son,\nWho split his father’s coffin—all for rebelling against his kin.\n\nI was commanded to assume the office of Master and Chancellor,\nWielding the power over life and death,\nInvestigating good and evil with full discretion.\n\nDuring the Qiandao era, in Shu’s Zhongjiang, there was a man named Wang Qian.\nHis parents had originally purchased a fragrant-wood coffin for their later years,\nBut Wang replaced it with cedar,\nThen sold the cedar to buy a plain wooden coffin.\nWhen his mother died, he kept the plain coffin for himself,\nPurchasing only a pine coffin for her burial.\nWithin ten days, I struck Wang dead with lightning,\nPlanting his body upside down.\nWhen word reached his son, he rushed to weep and right the corpse,\nBut at high noon, thunder suddenly seized the son,\nHurling him five *li* away.\nUpon his return, he found his father’s body once more inverted.\nAfter two burials, both were struck out of the earth.\nThus, he split a hole in the coffin and covered it with bamboo,\nOnly then escaping the thunder’s wrath.\n\n**Eighty-Eighth: Warning Against Deceit**\nFor men, nothing is more ruinous than greed and violence—\nThe reckoning of fate’s calculations is clear.\nYang Zhen’s \"Four Knowings\" could not be concealed,\nZiwen’s thrice-resigned office showed even firmer resolve.\nIf you harbor ill intent, do not think there is no retribution in the unseen,\nFor dereliction of duty will surely shorten your years.\nConsider Xu Qian’s dream-induced revelation—\nGold appeared to block his destined path.\n\nDuring the Qiandao era, Xu Qian, a magistrate of Xindu,\nWas dispatched as an investigating officer.\nPassing through a Xu family’s home to rest for the night,\nThe master of the house dreamed the evening before that a divine messenger said:\n*\"Tomorrow, the Vice Minister Xu will lodge here.\nTreat him well—this envoy is my assistant.\"*\nThat evening, Xu the Vice Director indeed arrived at their door,\nAnd they prepared a lavish reception.",

      "translated_text": "When Xu Qian returned, he dreamed again that the divine messenger said: *\"This time, Xu, you accepted five hundred taels of gold and wrongfully took seven lives. The celestial court has already deducted thirty years from your lifespan, and your office will end here.\"* Thereafter, the Xu family no longer received him, and the Vice Director was deeply perplexed. That evening, he sent a servant to recount the dream’s events. Xu Qian’s face flushed with shame. Upon returning to his post and awaiting reassignment, he died in his official residence before the new appointment arrived—at the age of thirty-four. When news of his death first spread, his fellow villagers refused to believe it. But once they learned the full story, none failed to lament his deceitful heart.\n\n**89. Punishment for Impiety**\nA son’s duty demands reverence for both parents—\nNurturing life and honoring death, rites must be observed.\nYet unburied remains lie exposed like transient guests,\nWhile wandering souls drift, their truth still unhidden.\nOther sons may labor in vain at filial deeds,\nFor spring and autumn’s reckonings fall upon the worthy.\nLuo’s dream brought him home to his village,\nOnly then did he grasp how swiftly hidden transgressions hasten one’s end.\n\nIn Dizhou, Luo Gong, a student of the Imperial Academy, passed by my shrine and silently prayed. One night, I appeared to him in a dream and said: *\"You have already incurred the celestial court’s judgment. Hasten home—do not inquire further about your future.\"* Luo pleaded: *\"I have lived with integrity and few faults. I beg to know the reason for my offense.\"* I replied: *\"It is nothing else—only that your parents have long remained unburied.\"* Luo said: *\"I have brothers. Why is the blame placed solely on me?\"* I answered: *\"Because you, as a scholar versed in ritual and propriety, bear the greater responsibility. Your brothers are too ordinary to be held accountable.\"* Luo awoke in remorse, packed his belongings, and returned home. When his classmates asked in astonishment, he recounted the dream—yet he died before reaching his family.\n\n**90. The Hidden Workings of the True and Mysterious**\nThings subtly connect—truths may be known.\nHow often has aiding others invited baseless slander?\nObserving the winds of Long and Shu, the true and tranquil endure,\nWhile in Nanchang, the ledgers of transformation respond to karmic mechanisms.\nBending one’s will to resolve tomb disputes for the people,\nForgetting the self to save the weak and withered—\nFrom this vow, after transforming like Han Yu,\nA deeper mystery of fortune and might is revealed.\n\nIn the *gengxu* year of the Shaoxing era, I traveled in spirit to investigate, descending by planchette to Letong in Fuzhou. There, Han Shen of Longmen sought my talismanic instructions to save his grandson Kunchen from a grave illness. I commanded the Merit-Recording Deity to respond, and the boy revived—all due to Han’s past karmic connections. Thus, I bestowed upon him the registers of the Dao. Thereafter, he was freed from suffering.\n\n**91. Deliverance from Suffering**\nThe bitter sea surges, waves merging with the sky,\nAs life and death unfold according to past causes.\nYet men cling to vain illusions amid empty blossoms,\nUnheeding of withered bones rotting in the grass.\nConfucius mourned the young to establish his teachings,\nWhile King Wen buried unknown remains—how could he know their years?\nThe August Heaven, entrusted with the people’s woes,\nStill harbors compassion, though it seems in vain.\n\nBy the Supreme Emperor’s profound virtue of cherishing life, I was charged with gathering the exposed remains of the dead across the land. The ancient histories record: *\"Even bones of unknown age moved King Wen to bury them. Children banded together to defend Lu, preserving Confucius’ mourning for the young.\"* Yet today, men neglect to bury their own parents—how much less would they feel pity for strangers! Through my labors of deliverance, I ascended to the unshakable realm of Peace and Bliss, playing freely in the samadhi of the Tathagata’s fruition.\n\n**92. Fortune and Retribution in Luzhou**\nMist drifts over the Lu River’s jade-green ripples—\nWho knows when the karma of killing will meet its hour?\nThe mountain monk’s slaughtered body lies in futile rage,\nWhile the mountain spirit’s vengeance lingers, slow to arrive.\nHad he cultivated loyalty and kindness, the Buddha’s samadhi,\nHe would not have met Li Waner’s enmity.\nZhang Xin returned to the hands of Wang Ji—\nThis retribution for that grievance came without delay.\n\nDuring the Shaoxing era, Zhang Xiaofang, the military governor of Luzhou, was plotted against by his soldiers Zhang Xin and others, leading to rebellion. Zhang Xin was later killed by his comrade Zhang Chang, and Luzhou was pacified. This traced back to a monk from Zigui during the Shaosheng era, named Liao Huijue, who lived in a mountain temple with great wealth. He gathered followers to perform a plague-averting Water and Land Ritual. Later, the bandit Li Waner led men to rob him, unaware the monk had set traps around the walls. All were ensnared, save Li Waner and a few others, whom the monk and his disciples slaughtered and ate. Later, Li Waner sought revenge. The mountain spirit said: *\"Your vengeance cannot come yet. This man still has karmic ties to bring blessings to many. Wait one more lifetime.\"* But Li Waner had also killed, and Wang Ji was destined to repay him.\n\nThereafter, the monk Huijue was reborn into the Qinghe Zhang family as Xiaofang. Li Waner became Zhang Xin, and Wang Ji became Zhang Chang. The retribution was manifest. Thus, I was appointed to command the divine guards of Luzhou, and the region was pacified.\n\n**93. Clarity of Vision**\nSince the Great Ultimate first dawned under Fuxi,\nThe spirit’s nature follows the moment like clouds over water.",

Honoring the Deceased**\nSince ancient times, mourning has not exceeded three years;\nDying at dusk and born at dawn, one should choose an auspicious day.\nFuneral rites and burials must be completed, the grave-mound raised;\nIn grief and filial piety, one seeks the ox’s peaceful rest.\nWind and thunder stir, sending sweet rains;\nCrops revive, rising again in the great fields.\nBurying the king in his fine tomb, the hardships of repose are done,\nAnd the divine dragon aids in begetting heroic worthies.\n\nLong ago in Shu, I dwelled in truth at Mowei Cave.\nFor three years, drought and locusts plagued the land,\nAnd the city gods of the four borders submitted reports on the same day.\nThe people of Shu, ignorant, left coffins unburied for years,\nExposing their parents’ remains, their blood and corpses polluting the heavens.\nThe Celestial Court grew angry, sealing the dragons in their pools,\nDrought withering the seedlings, the people losing their autumn hopes.\nThey longed for the True Lord’s compassion to revive and save them.\nI transformed into a layman, going door to door to exhort them,\nUrging them to hasten the burial rites.\nThen, with True Lord Qingyuan and True Lord Shehong,\nI issued a summons to the Dragon King of the Nine Rivers to send three days of sweet rain.\nAfterward, the crops revived, and the people rejoiced.\n\nAt that time, the Jade Emperor was enraged,\nFor the Dragon King of the Nine Rivers had acted without authorization in sending rain.\nHe ordered the dragon clan to be pursued and executed.\nI then transformed into a scholar, widely exhorting the Dragon King, his daughters, and all living beings,\nNever ceasing their recitation of the *Yuluo Imperial Edict*,\nCountless times over. Before three days had passed,\nAuspicious winds and propitious *qi* filled the Golden Gates.\nBy imperial decree, the Dragon King’s crime was specially pardoned.\n\nSince then, filial sons and obedient grandsons,\nUpon the death of their parents, dare not leave coffins unburied,\nBut complete the great rites. Thus, serving one’s parents is fulfilled.\nYin and yang harmonize, wind and rain come in their seasons,\nBlessings are bequeathed to descendants,\nOrchids and irises flourish,\nAnd longevity, wealth, and peace prevail.\n\n**95. Releasing Life**\nWet-born, egg-born—all are human,\nOnly through greed and cruelty do they cling to true feelings.\nThe young of the *mingming* cling to their mother’s embrace in spring nurturance,\nThe foolish *chunchun* ride the waves, chasing the currents to life.\nIn the yang seasons, releasing fish extends the span of years;\nFreeing eels in the primordial *qi* blesses the path ahead.\nExhorting one another to release lives,\nThe blessings of fortune cycle through generations in glory.\n\nI reflect that all beings possess Buddha-nature.\nThose who eat beef—above, the Celestial Court has the Star of the Grand Sacrifice;\nBelow, the earth has Mount Tailao,\nBoth dedicated to punishing those who eat beef,\nSubjecting them to ten thousand kalpas of suffering.\nThose who kill cattle face ten thousand kalpas without pardon,\nOften dying from plagues and pestilence.\n\nAs for pigs, sheep, dogs, fowl, fish, and shellfish,\nWet-born, egg-born—all are born of their parents.\nA single thought’s difference gives rise to ten thousand forms.\nIn mid-spring, one must not overturn nests—this is the *Monthly Ordinances’* warning.\n“Do not shoot roosting birds”—this is Confucius’ warning.\n\nFor those who cultivate the Dao and refine truth,\nRich flavors are not enough for the mouth—only the three-inch tongue-root matters.\nHow much better to avoid killing oneself,\nNot instruct others to kill,\nNot witness killing,\nNot rejoice in killing,\nAnd enjoy these five kinds of pure meat?\nThus, one may avoid great transgressions.\nWhy must one be greedy for the pleasures of the mouth and belly?\n\nLong ago, Li Chongyuan loved to eat eels.\nI knew his inclination and, moved by a dream, transformed into an old woman,\nWho told Chongyuan: “In my belly are five thousand children.\nIf I die, they die too.\nIf you spare me, your blessings will be boundless.”\nChongyuan believed and released the eel,\nAnd afterward, he never killed again.\n\nThere was also Yang Xu, a great merchant.\nI knew his fate in detail and transformed into a dream to appear to him:\n“Next year, you will die.\nIf you save one hundred thousand lives, you may extend your lifespan by twelve years.”\nXu said: “If my allotted time has come, how can I save one hundred thousand lives?”\nI said: “You may release fish fry, and there will be proof.”\nXu awoke and wrote notices in the marketplace,\nExhorting one another, sparing no expense,\nRansoming fish eggs and releasing them into the water.\nAfter a month, I appeared to him again in a dream:\n“You have saved one hundred thousand living beings—it is enough.\nYou may extend your lifespan by twelve years.”\nLater, his descendants flourished for generations,\nTruly no deception.\n\n**96.

Clarity of Vision**\nSince the Great Ultimate first dawned under Fuxi,\nThe spirit’s nature follows the moment like clouds over water.",

      "translated_text": "Amidst startled strains of immortal music, palace and court tones resound,\nThe Great Dao’s revival follows fragrant footsteps of those before.\nThe Five Thousand Characters of Dao and Virtue dissolve the kalpa’s fate,\nFor a hundred million years, heaven and earth stand firm as metal and boiling water.\n\nThe Millet Palace’s radiant destiny renews its transformative sway,\nSacred petal-scriptures and numinous texts once more flourish.\nThe Orthodox Unity’s mysterious rites shake the seas and lands,\nEternally extending the imperial throne’s boundless longevity.\n\nI roamed and feasted in the Jade Capital, serene and silent in true joy,\nEver mindful that the thirty-sixth Celestial Master of Dragon-Tiger Mountain, heir to the Han,\nHad strayed from the sacred succession.\nThus, I entrusted my form to the lineage of Zongyan,\nAnd indeed received the mysterious grace.\nFor the kalpa’s fate had not yet dissolved,\nThe teaching’s wind faltered and weakened.\nFortunately, the Five Thousand Characters of Dao and Virtue endured in an unbroken line.\nOnce more, a dream revealed the immortal seed,\nAnd I was established as the thirty-seventh generation,\nAlongside my younger brother, receiving the mandate from the former dynasty’s emperor.\nWe were personally anointed with brush and ink,\nCrowned with the master’s title,\nReviving the mysterious transformation,\nGuarding the nation and its people,\nHonoring and blessing Emperor Yao’s ten thousand years of life.\nFrom Yu’s sons to Tang’s descendants,\nWith loyal ministers as pillars,\nWe preserved the kalpa and extended lifespans,\nEnsuring the people’s peace like soaring swans and geese.\nThus, the teachings of Orthodox Unity flourished anew.\n\n**97. Suppressing Locusts**\n\nFollowing the land’s divisions, transforming at the Chu city’s edge,\nPromoting benefit and eliminating harm is the Way’s natural course.\nWhen caterpillars and borers harm the seedlings, farmers cry distress,\nThe phoenix’s mechanism responds, memorials ascend to heaven.\n\nWith solemn thunder and lightning, sincerity is made manifest,\nNo more locusts fill the vast fields.\nDivine transformations shine brightly, never to fade,\nAs people’s responses and events continue this chronicle.\n\nSince assuming governance of Jun Mountain,\nOverseeing Dongting’s waters,\nAnd flourishing transformations at Shu’s gates,\nMy spirit has long journeyed with the phoenix in the world.\nSince the Kaiqing era,\nI have often employed sacrificial and exorcistic methods in Jing and Chu,\nTo redress wrongful harms,\nAnd seek blessings beyond measure.\nYet demonic toxins spread unchecked,\nWhile the true Dao remained unfulfilled.\nI resolved to transform them.\n\nThus, I memorialized the Heavenly Court in person,\nAnd dispatched the monthly phoenix to open transformations in the Moon Gorge.\nI followed the moment’s needs, responding to transformations,\nGranting blessings to heirs in answer to people’s prayers,\nHealing the world with talismans and medicines,\nRevealing the principles of avoiding misfortune and seeking fortune,\nGuiding people in the mechanisms of advance and retreat, survival and demise,\nBroadening the heart of impartial justice,\nSilently dissolving habits of pettiness, deceit, leakage, and negligence.\nRewarding good and punishing excess,\nWishing for fortune and averting misfortune,\nIn the unseen workings and subtle influences,\nResponding aptly to every circumstance,\nSome were transformed merely by hearing the wind.\n\nYet the phoenix’s overseer, Du Nanqiang,\nOften embodied my transformations,\nNaturally manifesting the true and constant in response to the world,\nWithout flaunting or startling the doubtful customs of the age.\nMoreover, due to the demands of temporary lodging and social obligations,\nMuch was lost to record-keeping.\nSix or seven years passed.\n\nIn the Xianchun year of *yichou* (1265),\nLocusts plagued the gorge’s borders,\nFarmers cried distress.\nInvestigations were reported,\nAnd the prefectural governor, Chen Shunwu Yi,\nHastened to the Ju Ying Altar of Collected Perfected,\nPetitioning heaven with memorials,\nPraying for the locust plague’s end.\n\nI then summoned the village communities to inquire,\nAnd learned:\nThe prefecture’s people often gathered at streams and marshes,\nDredging for mussels and snails,\nHunting fish and turtles,\nEven slaughtering frogs and soft-shelled turtles to serve their superiors,\nKilling countless crabs to sate their appetites.\nHundreds of thousands of lives barely sufficed for a single meal,\nTens of millions of spirits were needed for one feast.\nThus, the accumulated lives, lost in the unseen,\nTransformed into qi and gave rise to locusts,\nWhich harmed the rice fields,\nCutting off the people’s sustenance.\nThis was the karmic retribution of lives repaying lives,\nYet people remained unaware.\n\nI therefore admonished and instructed the village communities,\nCommanding them to protect lives within their regions.\nI recorded the prefectural governor’s sincerity for the people,\nDeeply conveying their plea for sustenance,\nAnd memorialized heaven,\nRequesting that the Field Ancestor be ordered to wield the scorching fire,\nTo eliminate the pests of caterpillars and borers.\nI also petitioned to solemnly invoke heaven’s might,\nTo manifest the prefect’s devotion to the phoenix’s transformation.\n\nThe Emperor, moved by my earnest plea,\nGraciously assented.\nThus, dark clouds gathered by day,\nThunder and lightning with wind,\nAnd the locusts were utterly suppressed.\nThe entire prefecture reaped a harvest,\nFarmers rejoiced together,\nAnd officials established a dedicated shrine for me,\nTo display the divine favor.\n\nIn the Xianchun year of *dingmao* (1267),\nSpring drought withheld rain,\nFarming lost its season,\nThe people sighed in distress,\nHouseholds scattered.\nCheng Shuguang, the prefectural vice-magistrate of the gorge,\nAdministered the prefecture in the governor’s absence during his journey to the capital.\nDeeply troubled,\nHe re-established the mysterious merit,\nSacrificing his own salary,\nRepeatedly praying.\nThe gorge’s deities were moved,\nAnd reported to me.\nAs the overseer of the transformation’s domain,\nI could not refuse.\nMoreover, Cheng’s sincerity resonated deeply,\nPenetrating both seen and unseen realms.\nThus, I proclaimed the Nine Heavens’ mandate,\nRescuing the Five Dragons’ waters,\nBestowing rain in due measure.\nWithin days, it was sufficient.\nFrom then on, farming did not fail,\nAnd the people’s livelihoods stabilized.\n\nBy summer and autumn,\nLocusts arose again,\nOccasionally harming the seedlings.\nThis was because,\nThough I had earlier admonished the village communities to protect lives,\nThe gorge’s people remained unaware of the divine transformation.\nThe custom of killing and harming persisted as before,\nResidual calamities lingered,\nAnd perverse qi summoned them anew.\n\nYet Cheng,\nThough he saw and heard nothing,\nGrasped the principle of response to sincerity.\nSecretly memorializing and pledging devotion,\nHe feigned a return to petition me.\nI conveyed his words’ intent,\nRevealing what he had yet to understand,\nRecording his true earnestness,\nAnd submitting a flying memorial to heaven.\nThe night rain brought the Heavenly One’s waters,\nWashing away the unseen spirits’ grievances.\nThe autumn sun blazed by day,\nBanishing the pests’ harm.\n\nThus, moved by people’s responses and events,\nI summoned the phoenix and took up my brush,\nRecording the suppression of locusts,\nWarning those who kill living beings.\nAppended to the transformation’s records,\nDisseminated to propagate the origin,\nTo display the vice-magistrate’s utmost sincerity in aiding transformation,\nTo reverse the qi’s course and ensure a bountiful harvest.\nMay those who hear this take heed.\n\nIn the seventh month of autumn, after the full moon of that year,\nI wrote again at the phoenix altar of my attendant, the rustic Du Nanqiang.\n\n*The Fourth Scroll of the Transformations of the Divine Lord of Zitong Concludes*\n*(Querying the Dao—according to the following text, should be ‘Querying the Dao.’)*",
