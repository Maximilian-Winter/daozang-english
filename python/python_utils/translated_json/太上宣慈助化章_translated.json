Thereby, disasters shall be dispelled, and fortune and prosperity shall descend at once.\n\nBy day, face east; by night, face north.\nPrepare a pair of silver ingots, one hundred twenty tally sticks, twelve feet of azure silk thread, one thousand two hundred cash as sincerity money, one *shi* and two *dou* of life rice, and two *zhang* and four *chi* of life silk.\n\nProceed to ignite the incense burner,\nthen kneel and declare your office:\n\nTo the Supreme Mystery Capital of the Orthodox Unity, the Balanced Qi, and the Celestial Master’s twenty-four dioceses of Yangping and the like, your subject [Name] bows his head and prostrates himself, offering this reverent address:\n\nAccording to the records, your subject, a disciple of [such-and-such] Abbey in [such-and-such] Prefecture, [such-and-such] County, [such-and-such] Township, and [such-and-such] Village, aged [so many] years, with [so many] household members residing herein, today kowtows to beseech blessings and implore grace. This mortal, born of flesh and blood, descendant of the hundred officials, has through a thousand ages of fortune been privileged to serve the Supreme Great Dao and the Lords and Venerable Ones. Entrusted with the imperial mandate, he governs his own life and household. Yet this mortal, [Name], along with his entire household, great and small, has been foolish and obstinate, acting in frequent contravention of the Dao. Thus, misfortune has accrued, and in recent years, adversity has prevailed, leaving his household in decline and distress. Wealth and property have dissipated, malevolent spirits have arisen in competition, and he fears that the three disasters and nine calamities have converged upon his person. Ensnared by the celestial net and enmeshed in the earthly web, his lifespan is foreshortened, his years nearly spent. He petitions the Three Officials to absolve his name from death’s register. Moreover, the earth of his ancestral tombs has been severed, causing the restless dead to stir and bring misfortune. The consequences recur in what he witnesses: litigation ensnares the living. In this turbid and wicked age, a hundred evils rage violently, demonic bandits roam freely, and a hundred maladies bring slaughter. The deaths of ordinary folk lie strewn like refuse, their wails filling the roads, unbearable to hear. This mortal, dwelling amidst such peril, finds no merit by which to extricate himself. He deeply fears that he will suddenly be reduced to dust, unable to preserve his own existence, and without recourse. Thus, with a single heart, he surrenders his fate to the Great Dao, entreating your subject to present this petition and memorial, to dissolve the three disasters and nine calamities that afflict his life, to unbind the snares that entangle him, and to redeem his life from its destined end.\n\nAs enumerated in his plea, your subject, in his foolishness, remains ignorant of the workings of demonic *qi*. He fears that his person may be assailed by the six harms, that mutual afflictions may arise, or that malevolent apparitions may invade and wrong him. He also fears that he may be pursued by the *qi* of ancestral tombs—by the dead of his lineage, both inner and outer, and by demonic bandits—summoned arbitrarily by the Lord of Mount Tai. Though this mortal is indeed sinful and defiled, like the lowly sparrow or mouse, he turns to the Dao to seek mercy.\n\nIt is heard that the Supreme Great Dao, in its compassion, nurtures all beings, leaving none unsaved. To extend life and avert calamity, one need only beseech its boundless grace. Thus, he presents this oral petition in the central courtyard, beneath the Great Yin and before the Northern Dipper, prostrating himself to submit this memorial, that it may ascend to the Celestial Bureau.\n\nHe humbly prays that the Boundless Supreme Lord Lao, the Supreme Venerable Ones, the Three Master Lords, the Compassionate Father, and the Holy Mother may bestow their boundless grace, absolving the myriad mortal sins and transgressions this mortal has committed since birth, along with the nine calamities’ appointed hour. May all be swept away. May this mortal be granted one life, one survival, one passage, one deliverance. If his three destinies are exhausted and his tally’s reckoning spent, may he be specially granted length in the midst of shortness, success in the midst of failure, safety in the midst of peril, and deliverance in the midst of calamity. May the fleeting moments be reversed, and a single term of life be lent.\n\nHe petitions the deities of his life’s natal month to each lead a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, to rescue and resolve the calamities that threaten his life. Thereupon, he presents this written plea to beg for the tally of the *zi* and *wu* hours, extending his years to one hundred twenty. He beseeches that his name be substituted, his form transformed, his evil ledgers erased, and his shortness exchanged for length. May his fate be transmuted and extended, his years prolonged to their utmost, and may he be advanced beneath the guidance of the stellar net, where mutual redemption may be achieved.\n\nIf this mortal’s life is frail and weak, may it be extended; if his granaries are depleted, may their measures be increased; if his trees wither, may they be revived by nourishing rains. If his three lifespans are foreshortened, may they be prolonged; if his years and fate are brief, may his tally and blessings be augmented.\n\nHe respectfully summons the divine soldiers, the lictors, and the messengers to bear the ledgers of his life’s tally and records, presenting them before the Jade Emperor. There, in accordance with the matter at hand, they shall be reviewed by the Gatekeeper of Life’s Mandate. May the charges be assessed, the records examined, and the petitions granted to halt execution and stay the sentence.\n\nIf this mortal’s life is truly limited, its span too brief, the nine calamities converging, his conduct often wayward, his viscera filled with sin, and his sentence justly decreed; if his three destinies are nearly spent, the three absolutions already reported; if his name is absent from the Jade Calendar, his left tally unrecorded, his entry missing from the Three Primordials’ register, his name stricken from the Life Mandate’s ledgers, unclaimed by the Southern Palace, and unforgiven by the Heavenly Emperor—then he begs that these be expunged. Once every three months, once every three years, may the grand assembly recur in endless cycle. Should his plea be heeded, he shall receive the grace of his masters and elders, reborn through their favor.\n\nHe petitions the Lord of Lifespan in the Hall of Literary Glory, along with the Lords of Augmented Tally and Life’s Deliverance, five each, accompanied by twelve hundred officials and generals, to descend as one and preside over the extension of his life, the augmentation of his lifespan, and the eternal preservation of his existence.\n\nHe further petitions the Lords of Stellar Tally Adjustment, Name Transformation, and Death’s Transcendence from the Supreme Primordial Mysterious Black Palace, five each, accompanied by twelve hundred officials and generals, to descend as one. Together with the lictors and messengers within his person, and the reviewing officers beneath the Great Yin, they shall act on behalf of this mortal, ascending to the Palace of the Northern Dipper’s Handmaidens to redeem his name from death’s register and transform his form.\n\nHe petitions the Nine Dragon Talismanic Mandate from the Eastern Florescence Palace to be issued to the Immortal Lords of the Five Marchmounts, commanding the Water Official, the River Earl, Lord Lü, and the twenty-four wardens of Mount Tai’s prisons.\n\nThe Three Terraces and the Eight Seats of the Controller of Destiny shall absolve the transgressions within this petitioner’s person, reviewing and releasing all karmic bonds. They shall retrieve his three hun and seven po souls and restore them to his body, ensuring they do not wander astray. He petitions five Lords of the Restrained Hun and Controlled Po, accompanied by twelve hundred officials and generals, and further petitions the Seven Lads of the East, along with twelve thousand clerks of the retrieved hun and po, to proceed directly to the Palace of the Mysterious Yin Handmaidens. There, they shall redeem and reclaim his three hun and seven po, extracting his three destinies, to forever safeguard his life.\n\nHe petitions five Lords of the True Ruler of Southern Prosperity, with twelve hundred officials and generals, to descend as one and accompany his memorial to the Jade Desk of the Celestial Bureau of Destiny beneath the Lord Han of the Great Vast Heavenly Court. There, they shall revoke his death decrees from the Three Offices, redefine his life’s name, and inscribe him in the Jade Register of Divine Immortals on the Left Covenant, granting him boundless years.\n\nHe further petitions five Lords of the Stellar Net, with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to dissolve the lunar womb and placenta of his birth, absolving the transgressions of his natal Five Stars and Twenty-Eight Constellations. They shall dispel the calamities of solitary void and annihilation, the qi of the Five Disasters and Nine Perils, and bestow upon him the pure yang qi of generation, suffusing his body.\n\nFor the thousand afflictions and myriad pains that plague him, may they be eradicated upon the submission of this memorial. Yet he fears that since the establishment of his destiny, he has unwittingly violated the laws of Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, the Five Phases, the twelve double-hours, the Twenty-Four Spirits, the Celestial Net, the River Earl, the Great Unity, the Follower of the Chief Star, the Merit Clerk, the Messenger, the Great Fortune, the Lesser Fortune, the Victorious Advance, the Divine Rear, the Grand Impact, the Punitive Brightness, the Azure Dragon, the White Tiger, the Vermilion Bird, the Dark Warrior, the Coiling Serpent, the Queen of Heaven, the Great Yin, the Celestial Unity, the Noble Spirit, the Daily Patrol, the Monthly Procession, and the thousand prohibitions and myriad taboos—accumulating grave misfortunes that consign him to the company of ghosts. He beseeches the Seven Stars: may Tainlang and Jumen sever the roots of spectral affliction; may Lucun and Lianzhen alter his name and transform his form; may Wenqu and Wuqu expunge his death records; may Tian’gang and Pojun cleave asunder demonic hordes, preventing their harm. May the Three Terraces absolve the sins of his tomb and the thousand transgressions of his past, annihilating the ghosts of the Twelve Punitive Executions. May all his sufferings be cured.\n\nHe prays that the overseeing officials will facilitate and govern, allowing his memorial to ascend to the Three Heavenly Courts. There, they shall distinguish the transgressions of his family from past lives—his Nine Ancestral Kin and Seven Generations, his parents, and himself—accumulated through obstinate rebellion, shameful deeds, inhuman conduct, lust, theft, defiance of Heaven and betrayal of Earth, curses and imprecations, and the qi of karmic entanglement. Alongside the calamities of his current year and destiny, they shall dissolve the Five Punishments, the Six Harms, and the perils of short life, extending his years and augmenting his fate. May the Six Jia and the sixty-day cycles, the Yin and Yang of the sixty spirits, each command their legions, inspecting the Four Seas and Eight Extremities, the Fourteen Provinces and Ninety Prefectures, the One Thousand Two Hundred Counties, the Twelve Thousand Townships, and the Twelve Thousand Li of domains. They shall trace the transgressions of his person, identifying the nature of his sins, the offices and bureaus they offend, the deities and spirits they provoke, the ghosts that accuse him, and the inquisitors that seize him. He implores the summoned lords, generals, officials, and soldiers to ascend to the Three Heavenly Courts and the paths of the Dao, there to reconcile and annihilate these transgressions, ensuring that Heaven holds no records, Earth no registers, and Water no oaths—all shall be absolved.\n\nHe earnestly petitions one thousand two hundred Jade Maidens of the Granary Fire, each clad in garments of pearls and jade in variegated hues, their hair bound in triple knots. They shall extend his years and augment his life, filling his granaries and treasuries, further enhancing his longevity. They shall summon the qi of one hundred twenty spirits, suffusing his body, ascending to the Muddy Pellet and descending to the Crimson Palace, nurturing his root and origin, fortifying his years and destiny. He beseeches healing for his ailments, that his maladies vanish in an instant, and that his journeys be unimpeded.\n\nHe petitions the Great General of the Mysterious Elder, one hundred thousand strong, and the Envoys of the Mysterious Elder, one million in number. He further petitions one thousand two hundred Jade Maidens of the Three Heavens, their hair bound in triple knots, their bodies clad in five-colored garments of mysterious yellow, their feet shod in lion-skin slippers. Descending from the Three Heavens, they shall hold cinnabar in their mouths and bear jade nectar in their hands, exhaling true qi to heal and restore this mortal. From head to foot, they shall harmonize his green muscles and entwined vessels, regulate his six bowels, strengthen his sinews and bones, cure his hundred ailments, and rectify his dreams and waking hours. He shall pass through the Nine Perils, as they absolve the calamities of Heaven above and Earth below, the perils of the Three Heavenly Stars, the womb and lunar months, the afflictions of his birth hour, the exhaustion of his years and fate, the transgressions of marriage, relocation, burial, and the twelve hourly spirits, the calamities of the Grand General, the Grand Yin, the twelve monthly constructions, the exhaustion of his current year’s qi, the defiance of Heaven and betrayal of Earth, and the adversities of his destiny’s decline. Fearing that the confluence of his natal perils may summon the barbarians of the Five Directions—Yi, Man, Rong, and Di—along with internal and external adversaries, the curses from all sides, and the harm that brings illness, distress, and myriad pains to his body, he dreads that his life may not escape the Three Disasters and Nine Perils, that his fate may be as fleeting as a sparrow’s or a mouse’s, and that his fear of death and longing for life compel him to earnestly petition five Lords of the Three Heavens’ Calamity Absolution, with twelve hundred officials and generals, and five Lords of the Myriad Blessings of the Grand August, with twelve hundred officials and generals. They shall inspect his fate’s register beneath the Nine Heavens and above the Nine Earths, discerning the roots of his misfortunes and the depth of his calamities, reconciling and annihilating all.\n\nHe implores that his hundred ailments depart his body, that the Ten Virtues draw near, that a thousand disasters vanish, and that myriad fortunes renew. He earnestly petitions five Lords of Southern Prosperity, with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to seize and record the Three Corpses and Nine Worms within his body, preventing their escape, their surveillance of his transgressions, their incomplete assistance, their attraction of external malevolence, and their covert sabotage of his health—may all be annihilated at once.\n\nHe prays that the overseeing officials will manage each matter accordingly, dispatching the celestial officials and their legions of lords, generals, officials, and soldiers to eradicate all harm, capture malevolent qi, absolve and reconcile, and expel the myriad spirits, specters, and demons—whether they cling in strange forms, as miscellaneous gods and ghosts, or stubbornly linger. He petitions one thousand two hundred valiant soldiers of the Heavenly Center to descend as one to his dwelling, capturing and subduing the ten thousand malevolent spirits that plague him, purifying his inner and outer domains, and fortifying them with divine protection. He beseeches that his body be robust, that true qi descend to nourish and replenish his four limbs, pacify his five viscera, regulate his hundred passages, and deliver him from peril, granting him life amidst death. May his short register be obliterated and his name inscribed in the Jade Record of Longevity. May his thousand sins and myriad transgressions be pardoned in its entirety.\n\nOn the day he receives this grace, he shall reverently proclaim the wondrous Dharma, exhorting this mortal to cultivate virtue, amend his faults, and humbly adhere to the precepts and prohibitions, never again offending the celestial officials. In gratitude for their vigilant protection, he shall submit this comprehensive memorial, recounting their merits and advocating for their promotion, as a token of his sincerity. Thus, he petitions with deepest reverence.\n\nHaving reviewed the petition and distinguished its plea for mercy, the Most High shall attend to its deliberation. This humble servant, through the agency of the Two Official Envoys, the Orthodox Unity Merit Recorders, the Attendant Envoys of the Left and Right, the Yin-Yang Divine Decree Clerks, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Clerks, the Gale-Wind Courier Clerks, and the Memorial-Submitting Posthorse Clerks—each pair dispatched in their official capacity—now reverently submits this urgent oral memorial, one document in all, to ascend to the Three Celestial Bureaus of the Most High. Awaiting the decree’s response, this servant, with utmost trepidation and reverence, bows his head to the ground, prostrating himself twice in submission to make this known.\n\nThis servant, [Name], of [State] [County], [Abbey], humbly addresses the Most High Lord Lao, the Supreme Elder of the Three Heavens, the Peerless Dao of the Boundless Great Way; the Celestial Emperor Lord of the Nine Elders of the Immortal Metropolis; the Nine Qi Elder; the myriad layers of Dao-qi and the One Thousand Two Hundred Official Lords; and the Jade Throne of the Grand Clarity. This memorial is respectfully submitted on the [Day] of the [Month] in the [Year] of the reign of the Great Year-Star, at the hour of [Time], from [Location].\n\nOne sheet of complete paper shall suffice for this memorial.\n\nTo the Jade Throne of the Golden Portal of the Grand Clarity, the Peerless Dao of the Boundless Great Way of the Three Heavens:\n\n**[Memorial Title]**\nMinister [Name], in proper ceremonial rank, respectfully submits this sealed memorial.\n\n**[Inner Envelope]**\n*Reverently sealed*\n*Respectfully submitted*\n*To ascend to*\n\n**[Memorial Address]**\nMinister [Name] respectfully seals this memorial anew.\n\n**[Outer Envelope]**\n*To the Office of the Vacuous Nothing Elder of the Most High, [Bureau Name], [Palace Name]*\n*Reverently submitted*\n\n**[Memorial Content]**\n\nMinister [Name], in proper ceremonial rank, respectfully seals this memorial anew.\n\nTo the Gate of the Three Heavens, with request for transmission:\n**Memorial for Extending Lifespan and Dispelling Calamity by the Lady Wei of the Southern Peak**\n\nBy the Orthodox Unity of the Great Mystery, the Balanced Qi of the Supreme Mystery Metropolis, and the lineage of the Celestial Master’s twenty-four dioceses of Yangping and others, your Daoist servant [Name], bows his head and knocks his forehead to the ground, prostrating twice, and respectfully submits:\n\nAccording to the documents at hand, there is now a certain official disciple [Name] of [Rank], from [Village], [Precinct], [County], [Prefecture], who today kowtows and beseeches grace, seeking to avert disaster, resolve calamity, cure illness, sever external [obstructions], and restore the continuity of the memorial for pacifying spirits and stabilizing the hun and po souls.\n\nThis disciple [Name] has been fortunate across a thousand lives to serve the Dao of the Most High and the Lords and Elders of the Great Way. Through the incense fire of the Mystery Metropolis, he has protected himself and dwelt in purity and transformation. Truly, he is filled with boundless gratitude and joy for this grace. Yet, owing to his innate foolishness from birth, he is unversed in the statutes and canons, and in his practice of the Dao has often transgressed, thereby incurring trials and punishments. Of late, his fortunes have been adverse: his dwelling is unsettled, demonic toxins besiege it, spirits and humans are depleted, wealth is squandered, fields and silkworms yield no harvest, livestock perish, and his household suffers illness. Calamities follow one upon another, and in his dreams, he is constantly mingled with the long-deceased. Divination reveals that these are the putrid, foul ghosts of his great-grandparents, uncles, brothers, aunts, maternal uncles, sisters, and other kin, who, having died in illness or on inauspicious days, now return as malevolent spirits, afflicting the living with sickness.\n\nThis disciple [Name], along with his entire household, young and old, has encountered ominous and grotesque visions in divination and dreams, seeing what is not real. Moreover, in this present time, demonic brigands run rampant, unjustly harming the good and upright. Many have fallen ill and perished, and this disciple’s household, caught amidst this, fears it cannot escape. Terrified and desperate, with no recourse, he turns with all his heart to the Great Dao, seeking life and sustenance. He petitions your servant to submit this memorial on his behalf for exorcism and deliverance.\n\nThis humble servant, dull and ignorant of the statutes and methods, has followed the precedent of the Celestial Master’s \"Memorial of the Twelve Hundred Mouths.\" Upon investigating the origins of the malevolent spirits, the disciple [Name] stated in his own words, as revealed by divination, that these are the ghosts of his deceased ancestors—great-grandparents, uncles, brothers, sisters, aunts, maternal uncles, and other kin—who died of illness in past years or on inauspicious days and now return as malevolent spirits, inflicting sickness upon the living. This disciple [Name] and his entire household, young and old, suffer such afflictions and hardships that some have not had their names fixed in the registers of life, or their names have entered the records of death. Now, he seeks to retroactively resolve this, to tally his lifespan anew, extend his years and avert calamity, cure his illnesses, and beseech the removal of his name from the ledgers of death and its inscription in the registers of life.\n\n[Here follows the disciple’s birth year, name, and natal month.]\n\nThis disciple [Name] and his entire household, young and old, have exhausted their allotted stars and lifespans. He beseeches that their declining years and calamities be extended. Whether their tally is reckoned in the year of the Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, or Pig, he begs for their resolution, that their names be inscribed in the registers of life, their souls and spirits be restored, calamities be dispelled, illnesses be cured, and his entire household, young and old, be granted peace and safety, free from further harm.\n\nMoreover, he fears that this disciple [Name] and his household may have their tally reckoned in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, or twelfth month. He beseeches that these be resolved in order, that all afflictions, calamities, and illnesses be immediately dispelled, his household be at peace, and disasters be averted.\n\nIf this disciple and his household have their tally reckoned on the day of the Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, or Pig, he begs that the soldiers of the True Qi be dispatched to resolve these in sequence, inscribe their names in the registers of life, protect his household, cure their illnesses, dispel their calamities, eradicate demonic qi, and ensure the safety of his entire household, young and old, free from further harm.\n\nFurthermore, he fears that this disciple [Name] and his household may have their tally reckoned on the Establishing, Removing, Filling, Leveling, Fixing, Holding, Breaking, Perilous, Completing, Gathering, Opening, or Closing days. He beseeches that the generals, officials, and soldiers of the True Qi resolve these in order, expunge their names from the registers of death, inscribe them in the registers of life, dispel calamities, sever obstructions, cure illnesses, and ensure the peace of his household.\n\nHe also fears that this disciple [Name] and his household may have their tally reckoned in the first month, with the death taboo in the Tiger; the second month, with the death taboo in the Rabbit; the third month, with the death taboo in the Dragon; the fourth month, with the death taboo in the Snake; the fifth month, with the death taboo in the Horse; the sixth month, with the death taboo in the Goat; the seventh month, with the death taboo in the Monkey; the eighth month, with the death taboo in the Rooster; the ninth month, with the death taboo in the Dog; the tenth month, with the death taboo in the Pig; the eleventh month, with the death taboo in the Rat; or the twelfth month, with the death taboo in the Ox. For these deeply grave taboos and calamities, he beseeches the generals, officials, and soldiers of the True Qi of the Great Dao to compassionately resolve the registers of death and inscribe their names in the registers of life.\n\nMoreover, he fears that this disciple [Name] and his household may be afflicted by the monthly calamities of the Grand Year-Star, with their three hun and seven po souls confined in the northern prison of Mount Tai. Or that the Great Yin Envoys, the Lords of Wind and Rain, may claim to be the Grand Year-Star, the Great Yin, the Great Yang, the Great Generals, the Northern Director of Destinies, the Twelve Monthly Establishments, or assume other official titles, roaming the heavens and earth, followed by demonic soldiers, music, and banners, blowing horns and beating drums, bearing flags and staffs. They may claim to be the spirits of the local altars, the Stove Lord and Lady of the household, the Earth Lord and House Dragon, or the ghosts of soldiers, hunters, or those who died by misadventure, such as Li Ao. These spirits consort with thousands of ghosts and myriad deities, the hundred and twenty kinds of earthly and celestial punishments and calamities, and may come to harm this disciple’s household, causing illness, the departure of essence and qi, the disattachment of hun and po souls, and the persistence of calamities. Whatever they encounter turns to adversity, and official misfortunes arise wantonly. In such dire straits, he is filled with urgent dread, fearing he cannot escape. He pleads for mercy, his plight deserving of compassion.\n\nThis servant, overwhelmed by what he has witnessed, humbly risks transgression and prostrates himself to the ground, beseeching the submission of this **Memorial for Urgent Relief, Exorcism, Tallying Lifespans, and Curing Illnesses**, one document in all, to ascend [to the Jade Throne].\n\nTo the Celestial Bureaus,\n\nWith grace, I implore the Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Elder, the Heavenly Masters, the Female Masters, the Three Masters, and the Lady of the Gates, along with the Lords of the Five Qi, to take heed of this humble servant’s memorial and convey it in due time to the Heavenly Palace. May the true qi descend and flow, sheltering this disciple, his household—both high and low, free and bound—so that all may dwell in peace without harm, forever preserving primordial auspiciousness.\n\nFor this disciple and his entire household, may all profound calamities, heavy obstacles, and grievous illnesses be swiftly dispelled, leaving no trace. May wandering and malevolent spirits be eradicated, the household abide in tranquility, and evil gods and wicked ghosts flee to distant realms, ceasing all scheming. May all movements and passages be guarded by benevolent spirits, water and fire be extinguished, metal and stone be sundered. With boundless gratitude, I humbly invoke and beseech:\n\nFrom the East, the Lord of Life-Calculation of the Nine Yi, with one hundred and twenty officers and generals;\nFrom the South, the Lord of Life-Calculation of the Eight Man, with one hundred and twenty officers and generals;\nFrom the West, the Lord of Life-Calculation of the Six Rong, with one hundred and twenty officers and generals;\nFrom the North, the Lord of Life-Calculation of the Five Di, with one hundred and twenty officers and generals;\nFrom the Center, the Lord of Life-Calculation of the Three Qin and Earthly Stem Wu-Ji, with three hundred and ninety thousand officers and generals.\n\nMay all the celestial officers, generals, officials, and soldiers now invoked descend as one to extract the hun and po souls of this disciple, lest they remain trapped within the stellar palaces—whether in Horn, Neck, Root, Room, Heart, Tail, Winnowing Basket, Dipper, Ox, Woman, Emptiness, Danger, House, Wall, Straddler, Bond, Stomach, Pleiades, Net, Turtle Beak, Well, Ghost, Willow, Star, Spread, Wings, Chariot, or any of the Twenty-Eight Constellations and Thirty-Five Stellar Offices. May they descend as one to liberate this disciple and his household—both high and low—from the celestial nets above and the earthly snares below, dispelling calamities, transcending misfortunes, and severing all ties with malevolent spirits. May the afflicted recover, their sustenance flow freely, their complexion restore, their countenance return, the Four Great Elements harmonize, and their bodies be restored to their original state. May every member of the household—both high and low, free and bound—receive protection, dwell in safety without harm, and encounter only primordial auspiciousness. With profound gratitude for this boundless grace, I humbly invoke:\n\nThe Great General of the First Month, Yin, for Unbinding and Liberation, with one hundred thousand soldiers;\nThe Great General of the Second Month, Mao, for Unbinding and Liberation, with one hundred thousand soldiers;\nThe Great General of the Third Month, Chen, for Striking and Liberation, with one hundred thousand soldiers;\nThe Great General of the Fourth Month, Si, for Unbinding and Liberation, with one hundred thousand soldiers;\nThe Great General of the Fifth Month, Wu, for Striking and Liberation, with one hundred thousand soldiers;\nThe Great General of the Sixth Month, Wei, for Unbinding and Liberation, with one hundred thousand soldiers;\nThe Great General of the Seventh Month, Shen, for Striking and Liberation, with one hundred thousand soldiers;\nThe Great General of the Eighth Month, You, for Unbinding and Liberation, with one hundred thousand soldiers;\nThe Great General of the Ninth Month, Xu, for Unbinding and Liberation, with one hundred thousand soldiers;\nThe Great General of the Tenth Month, Hai, for Striking and Liberation, with one hundred thousand soldiers;\nThe Great General of the Eleventh Month, Zi, for Unbinding and Liberation, with one hundred thousand soldiers;\nThe Great General of the Twelfth Month, Chou, for Unbinding and Liberation, with one hundred thousand soldiers.\n\nMay all the generals, officers, and soldiers of the Twelve Months for Unbinding and Liberation now invoked descend as one to dissolve the profound calamities and grave illnesses of this disciple and his household. May all misfortunes of the year, the month, the day, and the hour be dispelled by the true qi, transcended, and left behind, forever preserving primordial auspiciousness.\n\nI further beseech the One Thousand Two Hundred Celestial Immortals of the Northern Realm for Dispelling Calamities and Curing Illnesses; twelve pure youths and maidens; the Lord of the Southern Prosperity Palace for Extracting Hun and Po Souls from the Rivers and Lochs, with one thousand two hundred soldiers; one hundred thousand Celestial Physicians for Curing Illnesses; and one hundred thousand Earthly Physicians for Curing Illnesses. May they descend as one to liberate this disciple and his household—both high and low—from the nets and snares, transcending calamities and misfortunes. May the three hun and seven po souls be extracted and restored to the body, fully replenished. May calamities be transcended, illnesses dispelled, leaving no trace. May the spirits of the long-departed, the recently deceased, and the externally ascended be banished to distant realms, their malevolent schemes utterly eradicated. May dreams be true and pure, the household tranquil, and every member of the family—both high and low—bathed in clarity and auspiciousness, dwelling in safety without harm.\n\nI prostrate myself and beseech the true officers, generals, officials, and soldiers of the Great Dao to act on behalf of this disciple and his household before the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water; the Five Peaks and Four Waterways; the Three Rivers and Four Seas; and the hundred ghostly prisons. Seek out this disciple and his household—both high and low—for any misfortunes of exhausted lifespan, the encroachment of baleful stars, the entanglements of the Primordial Hour, the clashes of the Five Phases, or any calamities from the first to the ninth, up to the one hundred and twenty celestial punishments. Dispel and liberate their hun and po souls, restoring them to the body, that they may swiftly recover. If they cannot be found, summon and inquire of the ancestral dead in the Three Mounds and Five Tombs. Seek the three hun and seven po souls of this disciple, or the three hun and fourteen po souls of this female disciple, and restore them to the body. If they still cannot be found, summon and inquire within the Twenty-Four Prisons of Mount Tai to retrieve these hun and po souls and restore them to the body.\n\nMay all profound calamities and grave misfortunes, the thousand illnesses and myriad pains, be swiftly dispelled, leaving no trace. May life be preserved whole, restored to its original state. May the four limbs and five organs, the three palaces and six viscera, the seven orifices and protective qi, the three hundred and sixty bones, the one thousand two hundred forms and shadows, the twelve thousand essences of light, and the five-colored lapis lazuli—red and white within the body—be replenished if depleted, their measures increased. May short lifespans be lengthened, their allotments augmented. Where inconvenience persists, transform it: turn short into long, blue into yellow. May lifespan be prolonged, calamities forever transcended, and all illnesses severed. May the spirits of the long-departed, the recently deceased, and the externally ascended turn toward benevolence, joining in protection, ceasing all entanglement. May the household dwell in peace, the residence remain pure, all movements and passages flow unimpeded, and every desire be fulfilled. May this humble servant and his household receive boundless grace, their prayers answered.\n\nMay the Lords, Generals, Officers, and Soldiers of the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, who have exerted their strength and achieved merit, be duly recorded in the triennial registers of this humble servant’s petitions, their merits acknowledged and promotions granted. They shall not betray their trust. Humbly beseeching the Most High to review and govern, to discern and respond to this plea for mercy.\n\nThis foolish servant respectfully invokes the Direct Envoys of the Two Officials, the Functionaries of the Orthodox Unity, the Left and Right Official Messengers, the Officers of Yin-Yang Divine Decrees, the Officers of the Scarlet Talismanic Chariots, the Officers of the Riding Placements of the Rigorous Winds, and the Courier-Officers for Memorials—two each—who now take charge.\n\nThis humble servant reverently petitions on behalf of his disciple [Name] and all household members, young and old, to present a memorial for the augmentation of lifespan, the dissolution of karmic reckonings, the averting of calamities, the healing of illnesses, the rescue of the urgent, the retrieval of wandering souls, and the restoration of scattered spirits. A protective memorial is hereby submitted, ascending to the Three Heavenly Courts of the Most High, awaiting proclamation and response.\n\nThis servant [Name], with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to make this known.\n\nThis servant, of the [Surname] clan, affiliated with [State] [County] [Abbey], the Supreme Clarity, Primordial Origin, Most High Three Heavens, Boundless Great Dao, Most High Lord Lao, Most High Elder, Celestial Emperor Lord, Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital, Nine Qi Elder, and the myriad layers of Dao-qi, the One Thousand Two Hundred Lords of the Supreme Clarity Jade Court.\n\nPresented on the [Day] day of the [Month] month of the [Year] year of the Great Year [Name], at [Location].\n\n*Concluded: First Scroll of the Most High’s Proclamation for Urgent Aid and Transformation*\n*Second Scroll of the Most High’s Proclamation for Compassionate Aid and Transformation*\n\n**Petition of Repentance by Daoist Du Guangting**\n\n**Petition for Atonement and Redress**\nThis servant [Name], of [such-and-such] dharma rank, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to submit this petition.\n\nThis servant, by the grace of a thousand rebirths, has been deemed worthy to hold office, to uphold and proclaim the pure dharma, and to heal the sick. Yet, being dull and unworthy, I remain ignorant of the ways of spirits and gods. I have failed to devote myself to assisting the Dao of my masters, and my remedies have been ineffectual. For this, I have incurred offenses, brought upon myself disasters and afflictions, and suffered recurring illnesses. My endeavors have come to naught, and my path has been fraught with misfortune. As a mortal, I am beset by hardship, and in my private heart, I am filled with dread. I now submit this petition, seeking deliverance and absolution.\n\nAs a servant entrusted with the transformation of the people, I have long overseen households. Yet, in my duties, I may have erred in practice, causing the three qi to fall into disorder. My merits may have been falsified or delayed, and rewards may not have been duly conferred. The blessings stored in heaven’s treasury may not have been delivered in time, or my petitions may have been unjust, giving rise to grievances. Such transgressions as these—and others besides—have accumulated, inviting calamities and afflictions, even illness and malevolent influences. I am willing to be examined and seized by the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water. Let the officials and clerks record my merits and recommend my promotion to the Central Palace, where I may receive due rewards and be assigned to a bureau, so that resentment may be dispelled.\n\nMay the clerks of the celestial bureaus review my merits and transgressions, extend their grace, and grant me clemency. May all my myriad faults and offenses be pardoned. I implore the Most High to take pity on my foolishness and unworthiness. Through the envoys of the Two Offices, the left and right officials of the Orthodox Unity Merit Clerk, the yin-yang spirit-decision clerks, the chariot-red-tally clerks, the fierce-wind courier post riders, and the memorial-submitting officials—two of each—I humbly submit this petition for [Name], seeking to confess transgressions, atone for faults, and beseech blessings to avert disaster. One petition is hereby presented to [such-and-such] bureau, awaiting response.\n\nThis servant, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to make this known.\n\n---\n\n**Petition for Expiation of Transgressions by a Daoist**\nThis servant [Name], of [such-and-such] dharma rank, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to submit this petition.\n\nUpon reviewing the documents, I find that, though I have been entrusted with the dharma office, my conduct has often violated the Dao. Despite my unworthy position, my proclamations have been ineffectual, the people and creatures have scattered, and my remedies have been delayed. Some transgressions were committed knowingly, while others arose from my limited understanding. I may have feigned authenticity in my practices, vacillated in upholding the dharma, or mismanaged the households under my care, causing distress to the people. I may have embezzled or misused sacred objects, shown outward reverence while harboring disdain in my heart, or slighted the teachings of my masters. I may have made false claims in the name of the teachings, engaged in deceitful schemes, or extorted money from others by exaggerating matters. I may have caused discord among kin, or fostered strife between parents and children. I may have been envious of fellow Daoists, or indulged in impurity and debauchery. I may have cursed or reviled others, disturbing the purity of the Dao, or given in to anger, disrupting the harmony of the three, five, seven, or nine qi. I may have failed to observe the proper measures, neglected the Six Ren, and instead employed the Six Bing, forsaking the Six Gui while invoking the Six Ding, thereby erring in my practice of qi and offending the celestial taboos. I may have grown arrogant due to favor, neglecting those in dire need, or allowed desire to cloud my judgment, exploiting my position to make demands. I may have indulged in wine, meat, lust, or theft. I may have failed to promote deserving officials in a timely manner, or delighted in conflict, spreading rumors about others. I may have exposed others’ secrets, mocked the aged, or alarmed the ignorant. I may have revealed the esoteric teachings, or maligned the true essence of the Dao. I may have harbored grudges, or sought to harm others through malevolent qi. I may have sought to exalt myself while disparaging others.\n\nSuch transgressions—twenty-nine in all—have been fully committed, and I stand condemned by the dark bureaus. Were my faults weighed, they would suffice to reduce me to ashes. Yet the Great Dao is vast and merciful, and the Most High values life. I implore your compassion, beseeching life and pardon for my thousand sins and myriad offenses, that the weight of heaven and earth’s grace may be made manifest. Henceforth, I shall strictly adhere to the dharma, never again repeating past errors.\n\nI implore the Most High to take pity on my foolishness and unworthiness. Through the envoys of the Two Offices, the left and right officials of the Orthodox Unity Merit Clerk, the yin-yang spirit-decision clerks, the chariot-red-tally clerks, the fierce-wind courier post riders, and the memorial-submitting officials—two of each—I humbly submit this petition for [Name], seeking to repent of transgressions, atone for faults, and beseech the granting of grace. One precious petition is hereby presented to [such-and-such] bureau, awaiting response.\n\nThis servant, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to make this known.\n\n---\n\n**Petition for Reprieve from Examination**\nThis servant [Name], of [such-and-such] dharma rank, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to submit this petition.\n\nUpon reviewing the documents submitted by [Name], as stated above: born of flesh, I received little learning in my youth and failed to grasp the great principles. Previously, I rejoiced in transformation and was placed under the governance of the Great Dao. By special grace, I was deemed worthy to hold office, overseeing the transformation of the people and managing households for many years. Though I rejoiced in my position, my mortal ignorance prevented me from fulfilling my duties, and I feared my inadequacy would bring shame upon me.\n\nI have reflected upon myself: my abilities are slight, yet my responsibilities are heavy. My senses are dull, and my tenure in office has been brief. Unfamiliar with the regulations, I have often erred in my duties. Thus, on the [Day] day of the [Month] month of the [Year] year, I fell gravely ill, yet have not recovered. I have examined my faults and cannot absolve myself. Fearing my transgressions, I have accumulated much that is shameful. The clerks of the celestial bureaus have been informed and have dispatched officials to examine me. Soldiers have been sent to my home to subject my body to interrogation, inflicting torment day and night without respite. My breath hangs by a thread, and my family trembles in terror, fearing for our lives.\n\nSince taking office, I have failed to revere heaven and earth above, or honor my parents below. I have disobeyed the teachings of my masters, committed many evils and few good deeds, acted with more defiance than compliance, and given in to anger more than joy. I have offended the heavens, earth, sun, moon, and stars, and violated the prohibitions of the five phases, the waxing and waning of the four seasons. I have dug into level ground, filled wells, and blocked waterways. I have obstructed the flow of water, severed roads, felled trees, and killed living beings. I have taken eggs from nests, secretly harmed others, and stolen their possessions. I have wrongfully killed, leaving grievances to fill the roads. I have shown disrespect to heaven and earth, declaring there are no gods. I have taken others’ property and failed to repay my debts. I have concealed others’ virtues and exposed their faults. I have spoken falsely, engaged in duplicity, cursed, reviled, and acted without principle. I have exploited the poor for personal gain, indulged in lust, and violated women. I have been envious, resentful, and jealous of those more accomplished than myself. My actions have been improper, and my conduct has lacked reason. Thus, I have brought upon myself severe examination, the binding of my hun and po souls, and the infliction of the five poisons. I deserve ten thousand deaths, and my crimes are known far and wide. I now confess all my transgressions without concealment, hoping for a moment’s respite to reform myself. I shall purge my innards, dissect my sinews and bones, and never again compare myself to my past self.\n\nAs a mortal, I submit my life in earnest. This servant, bearing [Name]’s petition, ventures through boiling waters and scorching fires to present this memorial. I beseech the clerks to extend their grace and review my case. The mortal humbly accepts and complies. May the officials who have examined me be rewarded, and may I be restored.\n\nThis servant, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to make this known.\n\nTo the Celestial Bureaus,\n\nUpon receiving rewards, may they enter the Central Palace and report to the respective offices to stabilize their positions, following the usual regulations, so as not to incur resentment. Though my sins are already determined and I deserve annihilation, like the sparrow and mouse clinging to life, I aspire to reform. I humbly beg for pardon and the gift of life, absolving my transgressions and faults, permitting future goodness. May the suffering I endure be alleviated, my essence restored, my complexion revived, and my qi and pulses regulated and harmonized as proof of my sincerity. I implore the Most High to discern this.\n\nFor a moment, this foolish and inferior servant, through the direct envoys of the Two Offices, the Functionaries of the Orthodox Unity, the Left and Right Official Messengers, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Deciding Clerks, the Chariot and Scarlet Talisman Clerks, the Gale-Riding Courier Station Masters, and the Memorial-Presenting Officials—each dispatching two attendants—earnestly petitions on behalf of [Name] to confess and absolve sins, safeguard this ailing body.\n\nOne memorial is respectfully submitted to the Celestial Bureaus, awaiting notification.\n\nThis servant, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to make this known.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial of a Daoist Priest for the Annulment of Register Violations**\n\nThis humble servant, [Name], of such-and-such ordination rank, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to submit this memorial:\n\nI, of lowly and foolish nature, have long been occupied with worldly duties, delighting in transformation and governance, submitting my life to the Lords and Masters of the Dao. Having received great favor, I was entrusted with administrative duties, bestowed with the immortal registers, and charged with overseeing households and guiding the people. I was to propagate the true teachings and assist the nation in sustaining its mandate. Yet, born and raised in this impure world, I lacked learning from youth, failed to grasp profound principles, and in upholding the Dao, lost the mean in practice. My conduct was disloyal, unfilial, unkind, and unbenevolent. I disrespected and disobeyed my parents and siblings, coveted wealth and lust, indulged in wine and meat, and in all my actions, violated the prohibitions of the registers. Recently, my dreams and waking hours have been disturbed, my visions abnormal, my household plagued with misfortune, and my words met with strife. I have transgressed the statutes and breached the covenants, bringing upon myself this adversity.\n\nFearing sudden calamity and unable to endure further, I venture through boiling waters and scorching fires to present this memorial. I humbly request that the Lord Bi Yu dispatch one official and one hundred twenty attendants to absolve my violations of the register’s prohibitions—my consumption of wine and meat, and all my transgressions—reconciling them all. For my thousand sins and ten thousand faults, I beg for pardon. I shall purify my heart and renew my resolve, reforming the past and cultivating the future. Should I complete this year without further incident, let it serve as proof of my sincerity. I implore the Most High to discern this.\n\nThrough the direct envoys of the Two Offices, the Functionaries of the Orthodox Unity, the Left and Right Official Messengers, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Deciding Clerks, the Chariot and Scarlet Talisman Clerks, the Gale-Riding Courier Station Masters, and the Memorial-Presenting Officials—each dispatching two attendants—I earnestly petition on behalf of [Name] to confess and absolve faults, safeguarding this ephemeral body.\n\nOne memorial is respectfully submitted to the Celestial Bureaus, awaiting notification.\n\nThis servant, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to make this known.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial of a Daoist Priest for Safe Travel**\n\nThis humble servant, [Name], of such-and-such ordination rank, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to submit this memorial:\n\nI, a descendant of the myriad officials, have been fortunate across a thousand generations to be entrusted with administrative duties and bestowed with the celestial officials and soldiers for my protection—a favor far beyond what my stubborn and base nature deserves. Having received this transformation for but a short time, I remain ignorant and unenlightened, trembling day and night as if standing at the edge of an abyss. Now, as I journey to [such-and-such place], traversing perilous and distant paths, where the world is corrupt, people deceitful, and ghostly qi yet uncleansed, I fear bandits and robbers may attack and plunder. Thus, I submit this memorial to make my plea known.\n\nI humbly request the Celestial Officials and August Lords—one Heavenly Official Soldier Lord, one hundred twenty attendants; the Nine Qi Lords with their fifteen myriad hosts; the Left Horse Lord with one hundred twenty attendants; each to descend in unison to accompany me, repelling and expelling all wickedness and rebellion. May the thousand evils and ten thousand ills, the slanders of officials, and all disasters be averted. Under the protection of the soldiers, may all evils be dispelled, bandits warded off, and roads made passable.\n\nI further request the Lords of the Eastern Nine Yi, Southern Eight Man, Western Six Rong, Northern Five Di, and Central Three Qin—each leading one hundred thousand soldiers, clad in iron, wielding blades, and commanding the armies of water, fire, reversed armor, and inverted scales—along with one million two hundred thousand troops. May the Thirty-Five Lords of the Nine Heavens’ Talismans, the Great Banners and Drums of the Red Yang Ten Punitive Generals with their ten myriad soldiers, and the True Officials of the Four Directions, the Qi-Infusing Yellow Emperor Lords, and the Camp Star Lords with their one hundred twenty attendants descend simultaneously to guard my person, repelling all malevolent and rebellious forces, and dispelling the unruly qi of specters and demons along the way. May all be subdued, my journey safe, and my return secure.\n\nUpon my return, I shall duly report the merits of the officials, generals, and soldiers who accompanied me, ensuring equitable recognition. For all the commanderies, counties, waterways, and land routes I traverse, the lodges and inns I stay in, and the encampments and registries of ghosts, I beseech the supervising and examining Lords—the Two Mysteries, Three Origins, Four Beginnings, and Jiazi Officials of the roads; the Warden Lords of the post stations and guesthouses; the Camp and Registry Lords of wandering spirits; the Lords of the Four Wilds and Nine Regions; the Elders of the Mountains and Forests; the Twelve Stream Maidens; the Water Emperors of the Nine Rivers; and the River Earls and Lords of Lü—all to safeguard the roads, ensuring smooth passage on land and safe crossing on water.\n\nMay all who labor be rewarded in due time, without omission or error. Should I receive this favor and fulfill my wish, let it serve as proof of my sincerity. I implore the Most High to discern this.\n\nThrough the direct envoys of the Two Offices, the Functionaries of the Orthodox Unity, the Left and Right Official Messengers, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Deciding Clerks, the Chariot and Scarlet Talisman Clerks, the Gale-Riding Couriers, and the Memorial-Presenting Officials—each dispatching two attendants—I earnestly petition on behalf of [Name] for safe passage on land and water.\n\nOne memorial is respectfully submitted to the Celestial Bureaus, awaiting notification.\n\nThis servant, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to make this known.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial for the Restoration of Broken Daoist Covenants on the Road**\n\nThe Dharma-Ranked Servant of [Surname], with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates, bows twice, and respectfully submits:\n\nThis foolish descendant of mine, though born of humble lineage, has long cultivated the virtuous Dao. In former times, when the Han dynasty’s fortune shifted, the rites and teachings flowed freely. Though I remained in the secular world, I did not forsake the pure Dharma. Yet, dwelling near lowly officials, my affairs became entangled with the perverse. My own dullness and ignorance left my merits unworthy of record, and so I was assailed by malevolent spirits. Of late, my household has suffered manifold afflictions—illnesses, the death of servants, and the depletion of wealth. Searching my conduct for fault, I cannot discern the cause. Though I sought mercy through the Dao, I have not received its sheltering grace. Thus, I now submit this memorial, humbly beseeching Your compassionate review.\n\nMy family has served the Dao for generations and ought to be held in esteem by all. Yet, though we dwell beneath the vast covering of Heaven and Earth, we have encountered misfortune and adversity. I suspect my actions have strayed from the harmonious Dao, inverting the natural order and mingling with the common herd. Though the Three Origins and Four Beginnings grow ever more exalted, the myriad spirits of the lower realms have become the arbiters of my fate. Even in this single delusion, I cannot free myself. I implore Your mercy to absolve all my transgressions, that from this day forth, my path may be prosperous, my illnesses dispelled, and my household secure in peace and abundance.\n\nI implore the Most High to discern this humble servant’s plight. Through the direct envoys of the Two Offices, the Functionaries of the Orthodox Unity, the Left and Right Official Messengers, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Deciding Clerks, the Chariot and Scarlet Talisman Clerks, the Gale-Riding Couriers, and the Memorial-Presenting Officials—each dispatching two attendants—I earnestly petition on behalf of [Name] to dispel calamity, safeguard my family, and restore well-being.\n\nOne memorial is respectfully submitted to the Celestial Bureaus, awaiting notification.\n\nThis servant, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to make this known.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial to Sever Slander on All Sides**\n\nThe Dharma-Ranked Servant of [Surname], with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates, bows twice, and respectfully submits:\n\nI humbly observe that this unworthy descendant, born and raised in rustic ignorance, was never versed in the rites of the Dao. By mere happenstance, I was appointed to this office, where I must now account before the Celestial, Terrestrial, and Aquatic Bureaus. As a mortal of dull wit, my tenure has been brief, and my transgressions many. Overwhelmed with dread, I know not where to turn.\n\nI prostrate and bow twice again. Since the day and month I received the Essential Words of the True Unity, my dim understanding has failed to fully grasp the methods of nurturing the spirit and receiving qi. Yet, I have dutifully served the secular world, where many turn their backs on the Dao, slandering their masters and reviling the Way. Their tongues wag ceaselessly, each claiming righteousness, while I, guilty of untold offenses, deserve to be shattered and ground to dust. I dare not hope for life, yet by the grace of the Venerable Lords, I prostrate myself and submit this memorial.\n\nI humbly beseech the Invincible Azure Mysterious Lord to dispatch a host of one million soldiers to suppress slanderous tongues, the ghosts of curses and oaths. I further entreat the Southern Guardian and the Six Stellar Lords, along with their one hundred twenty generals, and the Thirty Billion Celestial Maidens of the Zhou Tian, to descend at once and apprehend all who persist in malice, rebellion, scheming, and slander. Let them visit every household, bringing reconciliation and sealing away the venom of perverse and wicked tongues. May all such enmity dissolve at once, as proof of this covenant.\n\nLet the generals, officers, and soldiers, along with the stellar guardians of every quarter, infuse their qi to oversee and examine the merits of these divine envoys. Should they fail in their duty, may they be held accountable. I beg that the thousand sins and ten thousand transgressions I have committed, past and present, be wholly absolved. I shall exert my utmost effort, sparing no devotion, to ensure peace and security, as proof of my sincerity.\n\nI implore the Compassionate Father and Mother to take pity on this foolish servant. Through the direct envoys of the Two Offices, the Functionaries of the Orthodox Unity, the Left and Right Official Messengers, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Deciding Clerks, the Chariot and Scarlet Talisman Clerks, the Gale-Riding Couriers, and the Memorial-Presenting Officials—each dispatching two attendants—I earnestly petition to silence all slanderous lips and safeguard my person.\n\nOne memorial is respectfully submitted to the Celestial Bureaus, awaiting notification.\n\nThis servant, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to make this known.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial to Stabilize Qi and Resolve Illness**\n\nThe Dharma-Ranked Servant of [Surname], with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates, bows twice, and respectfully submits:\n\nThis lowly descendant, born of a lineage that has long served the lower officials, inherited from my ancestors the practice of offering libations to the myriad spirits. Yet, we have not received their blessings; instead, we have suffered misfortune and calamity. Thus, we entrusted our fate to the Great Dao to preserve our lives. Since pledging ourselves to its service, we have been graced with profound favor—our household has known peace and stability, a cause for both joy and trepidation.\n\nYet, as a mortal, my conduct has often strayed. Since the year and month of [Date], I have known no respite. My limbs grow heavy, my rest is fitful, and my waking hours are troubled. In dreams, I wander through quiet chambers or ruined halls, as though receiving guests, or lie abed as if scaling mountains, crossing peaks, riding chariots, or sailing ships. At times, I am consumed by resentment or joy, my emotions unchecked. At others, I speak in the voices of spirits, proclaiming their authority, or rail against my household, recounting the affairs of the common folk. Sometimes, I am seized by sorrow, my actions without reason. This affliction lingers, waxing and waning, leaving my flesh wasted and my bones emaciated. My heart trembles at the thought of sudden demise, fearing I may be ensnared by malevolent spirits, led astray, and bound in delusion.\n\nTurning inward, I examine my conduct. Though I bear the sacred registers and wear the emblems of purity, my sincerity is faint, and my devotion divided. I have failed to repel evil and dispel harm. Thus, I humbly submit this memorial, beseeching the Twelve Great Generals of the Mysterious Elder and their one hundred twenty generals to descend upon my person, seizing the rebellious ghosts of the Three Bureaus and the spirits of the myriad elders who claim divine authority and emerge from the Dao. May they be dispersed at once.\n\nIf my bones and destiny align with Heaven’s decree, and I am granted recovery, I shall receive the central qi. I implore Your discernment to distinguish truth from falsehood, that the malevolent spirits and perverse influences may be dispelled, and my qi restored to purity, as proof of this covenant.\n\nI implore...\n\nMost High, in Your discernment, take pity upon this foolish and inferior servant. Through the mediation of the Two Bureaus’ Direct Envoys, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Left and Right Envoys, the Yin-Yang Spirit Judgment Clerks, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Clerks, the Gale-Wind Courier Post Horses, and the Memorial-Offering Clerks—each dispatched in pairs—I, your servant, humbly beseech on behalf of [Name] a memorial for the blessing of limb-strength and well-being, that every movement may proceed in pure peace. This petition is respectfully submitted to the Celestial Bureau, awaiting Your decree.\n\nI prostrate myself in reverence and awe, kowtowing to make this known.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial of the Handwritten Register to the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water**\n\nYour subordinate, [Name], holding the dharma-rank, prostrates in reverence and awe, kowtowing twice, and respectfully declares:\n\nI, [Name], a man/woman of [Prefecture, County, Village], aged [Number] years, now set forth in handwritten form the sins of my past, itemized as follows. Each matter is recorded separately, without embellishment or concealment, omitting nothing, whether grave or slight. Should any transgression remain unconfessed, or should the examining officials find ambiguity, let each offense be listed thus:\n\nIn the year [Year], at [Month, Day, Hour], I, [Name], a man/woman of [Prefecture, County, Village], aged [Number] years, with [Number] household members, having violated the precepts of the Dao, fell ill on [Month, Day] and have suffered affliction to this day, with no sign of recovery. Fearing for my life, I now submit this handwritten register and memorial, respectfully presented to the Most High, the Primordial and Boundless Lord of the Three Heavens, the Supreme Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Lord of the Capital Bureau, the Examiners of Conduct, the Six Essences and Six Shells, the Twenty-Four Bureau Lords, the Celestial Masters, their Heirs, and Lineage Masters, as well as the generals and clerks under their command in the prefectures and counties. May the Four Lords of the Four Directions, who oversee the infusion of qi and the scrutiny of deeds, examine this servant’s illness. I have handwritten this confession, listing each transgression—its gravity, nature, and number—as recorded in the attached register. I beg for life, for the alleviation of my illness, and vow henceforth to uphold this handwritten pledge, practicing filial devotion in accordance with the Master’s teachings. I shall cultivate kindness, loyalty, and filial piety, honor the aged, cherish the young, care for orphans, support widows, and succor the poor and weak. In all matters, I shall submit to the Master’s household, treating their affairs as my own, sharing their joys and sorrows. I shall not sow discord, engage in slander, speak falsely, or devise private doctrines. I shall not conceal faults while praising virtues, nor downplay grave sins while confessing minor ones. Should I fail to fully disclose the truth, or should I violate this pledge, I shall offer my body and speech in repentance to the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, accepting all consequences without complaint.\n\nI now invoke the Lords of the Eastern Nine Yi, the Southern Eight Man, the Western Six Rong, the Northern Five Di, and the Central Three Qin—each with twelve attendants and a host of one million soldiers, the Reverse-Hair and Cross-Scale Warriors—as well as the Azure Emperor of the East, the Vermilion Emperor of the South, the White Emperor of the West, the Black Emperor of the North, the Yellow Emperor of the Center, the Azure Dragon, the White Tiger, the Vermilion Bird, the Dark Warrior, and Gouchen, to collectively examine my case. As a mortal seeking life, I beg for survival, vowing to uphold the Master’s Way and transmit it for ten thousand generations. May all under Heaven—those already in the Dao and those yet to enter—hear of this handwritten confession and take it as proof of my commitment to the Way. Though the matter is long-standing and I cannot recall every detail, I shall reflect deeply and submit further confessions as they come to mind, every three days. Should You, Merciful Father and Holy Mother, take pity on the common people and grant Your scrutiny, I shall reform henceforth, purging my past errors. Even if my stomach is scoured, my sinews stretched, and my bones broken, I shall never again compare myself to my former self. I beg for life.\n\nI now solemnly handwrite this pledge as proof.\n\n---\n\nI, your servant, a mortal of flesh and bone, descendant of withered remains, untrained in learning and ignorant of discernment, have been unworthily appointed to the office of Libationer. My duty is to assist the Celestial Master in propagating the qi of the Dao, aiding the nation, sustaining life, and healing illness. Yet, burdened by the Six Defilements, I am dull-witted and have failed to propagate the Dao’s qi, exhort virtue, or transform evil. Day and night, I tremble in fear, unable to find peace.\n\nYour servant, [Name], a fellow Libationer of the same qi, having violated the Dao and brought disorder upon himself, now suffers from prolonged illness, worsening by the day. My breath hangs by a thread, and in self-reproach, I find no relief. Exhausted and without refuge, I now come before the court to confess in writing all my past sins—good and evil, grave and slight—from the age of seven to the present, itemized as in the attached register. I beg the Great Dao to grant me life anew.\n\nAs a mortal, I turn to You in sincerity, hoping for Your compassion. I now submit this plea, braving fire and boiling water, prostrating to present this memorial. Should my words reach You, I shall accept my fate among the myriad beings. Overwhelmed with shame and fear, my sweat flows like melting ice.\n\nI beseech the examining officials to review my register and submit it to the One Hundred Twenty Bureaus of the Heavenly, Earthly, and Water Officials. May they pardon my past transgressions, restore my fate and destiny, and grant clemency for what has passed while holding me accountable for the future. As a mortal, I have pledged to fully confess the truth. Should the examining clerks’ scrutiny yield immediate and verifiable results, let them be duly rewarded for their labor.\n\nI now respectfully submit this memorial to all the Examiners, Generals, and Clerks of the Heavenly, Earthly, and Water Bureaus, as well as the soldiers under their command, to report their merits and recommend promotions in rank, in accordance with the statutes of the Celestial Bureau. Let each return to their respective bureau, where their accomplishments shall be recorded. The Central Palace shall review and approve their ranks, ensuring no grievances remain.\n\nShould any resentment linger, let my hun and po be detained in the Celestial Bureau for prolonged interrogation. I humbly beg for pardon, that my three hun and seven po may return to my body, my suffering be alleviated, and this be taken as proof of Your efficacy.\n\nMay the Merciful Father and Holy Mother, in Your great compassion, examine and discern my plea. Take pity upon this foolish and inferior servant. Through the mediation of the Two Bureaus’ Direct Envoys, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Left and Right Envoys, the Yin-Yang Spirit Judgment Clerks, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Clerks, the Gale-Wind Courier Post Horses, and the Memorial-Offering Clerks—each dispatched in pairs—I, your servant, humbly beseech on behalf of [Name] a memorial for deliverance from distress and the protection of his/her body. This petition is respectfully submitted.\n\nTo the Celestial Bureau, I humbly await your report. With utmost reverence and awe, I bow my head to the ground, prostrate myself, and kowtow twice to make this known.\n\nI vow to follow the Dao and beseech for a petition of life. The ordained servant of the dharma-rank, [Name], with utmost reverence and awe, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and kowtows twice to address this: I, your servant, once by fortune, was graced with pure transformation and received profound kindness, bestowed with the rank of immortal official and celestial soldiers for my protection. For years, in all matters great and small, I have maintained a sincere heart, truly rejoicing in this. Yet, my nature is stubborn and dull, ignorant of the prohibitions of Heaven and Earth. My conduct has been riddled with transgressions, and I have been investigated by the true officials for my qi. On such-and-such a day and month, I was interrogated, and my illness has persisted for countless days. My body is emaciated, my qi depleted, and my life hangs by a thread. In great fear and dread, I fear I may not survive. I surrender my life to the Great Dao, confess my sins, and beg for life. I have privately knelt in my home and vowed to reform my wrongs, turn from rebellion to obedience, and pledge to follow the Dao without retreat. I only beg for pardon, to extend my days, and allow me to breathe. I shall diligently reflect on the transgressions I have committed and enumerate them one by one. Yet, my mortal understanding is shallow, and I have not received mercy. My suffering lingers, worsening day by day. My entire household, young and old, faces annihilation. I crawl to seek remedy, imploring your servant to beg for mercy and beseech for my life. I vow to cultivate myself anew. Once recovered, I shall assist in the Dao of the Master, uphold the laws and statutes, cast off the old and embrace the new, and follow only goodness without fail.\n\nI, in my foolishness and ignorance, have failed to propagate transformation and do not know the severity of my sins, nor the nature of the punishment that has left me debilitated for so long without relief. As a mortal, I am desperate to repent, yet like a sparrow or mouse, I cling to life—truly pitiable. With trepidation, I dare to offend the pure and upright, braving boiling water and fire, to present this petition on behalf of [Name]. I humbly submit it to the Three Heavens’ Bureau of Life and Destiny. May the esteemed officials examine the celestial records, calculate merits to offset transgressions, and reconcile the punitive qi. I respectfully request one Lord of the Nine Heavens and one hundred twenty officials and generals to absolve my sins and lift the summons. May this reach the various bureaus of the Central Palace, ensuring stable office and the return of my hun and po to my body.\n\nIn all my past conduct, there is no goodness to record. My deeds are tallied in the Right Palace, with only sins inscribed. My transgressions abound, and my merits are nonexistent—nothing to offset them. I beg for special pardon of all my sins and the gift of my life. I shall prove myself in the future, held accountable for my future goodness. If I do not betray my words, may my punishment be transformed into merit. If I violate this and remain unabsolved, I, in my mortal peril, dare to bring this to your attention. Overwhelmed with fear, I rely on the Most High to discern and take pity on this foolish and inferior servant. Through the mediation of the Two Bureaus’ Direct Envoys, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Left and Right Envoys, the Yin-Yang Spirit Judgment Clerks, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Clerks, the Gale-Wind Courier Post Horses, and the Memorial-Offering Clerks—each dispatched in pairs—I, your servant, humbly beseech on behalf of [Name] for the absolution of sins and the fortification of my Dao-heart. This petition is respectfully submitted to the Celestial Bureau, and I humbly await your report. With utmost reverence and awe, I bow my head to the ground, prostrate myself, and kowtow twice to make this known.\n\n**Petition for Prolonging Life in Dire Illness**\nThe ordained servant of the dharma-rank, [Name], with utmost reverence and awe, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and kowtows twice to address this: I am a crude and vulgar descendant, a mortal born of flesh, who delights in transformation and governance to sustain my life. Yet, my many transgressions have prolonged my calamities. Recently, I fell ill, afflicted by a hundred poisons. The condition has worsened over time, with no relief. Now, I am gravely debilitated, barely clinging to life. I have repeatedly implored the various officials, confessed my sins, and made solemn vows, yet I have not received mercy. As a mortal, I am filled with dread, my heart and courage lost. I am resigned to becoming dust, forever consigned to the Yellow Springs. I, who am tasked with serving and propagating the compassionate transformation, should assist the August Elders in rescuing the perilous, healing the sick, and aiding those in distress—this is my constant duty and my compassionate concern. Yet, my mortal life hangs by a thread. With trepidation, I dare to submit this petition, beseeching five Lords of Longevity from the Southern Prosperity Bureau, along with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to descend together to the Palace of the Dark Yin’s Imperial Concubine. May they extract my fading life, absolve all my sins from first to ninth, and fulfill the Dao’s reckoning. I further request the Lord of Lifespan, the Lord of Life Protection, and the Lord of Life Extraction—three officials, each accompanied by one hundred twenty attendants—to descend and plead for my life, once every three months for three years. I vow that if I am granted life, it shall serve as proof of your efficacy. I rely on the Most High to discern and take pity on this foolish and inferior servant. Through the mediation of the Two Bureaus’ Direct Envoys, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Left and Right Envoys, the Yin-Yang Spirit Judgment Clerks, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Clerks, the Gale-Wind Courier Post Horses, and the Memorial-Offering Clerks—each dispatched in pairs—I, your servant, humbly beseech on behalf of [Name] for the elimination of illness and the augmentation of years. This petition is respectfully submitted to the Celestial Bureau, and I humbly await your report. With utmost reverence and awe, I bow my head to the ground, prostrate myself, and kowtow twice to make this known.\n\n**Petition for Life**\nThe ordained servant of the dharma-rank, [Name], with utmost reverence and awe, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and kowtows twice to address this: My illness is grave, and I am in critical danger. Reflecting on my transgressions, I cannot discern their nature. I have repeatedly sought remedies, confessed, and begged for mercy. Yet, my illness remains severe, with no alleviation. As a mortal, I am filled with dread, fearing I shall become dust. I implore your servant to bring this to your attention. In my foolishness and ignorance, burdened by human frailty, I rely on this plea. With trepidation, I dare to offend the pure and stern, submitting this petition to make this known. My suffering has only worsened over time, with no relief. There must be deeply concealed and grave sins, or perhaps my life’s fate is at its end, and I am bound for the Yellow Springs. Truly, this is not something my stubborn and shallow self can presume to address. I can only look up and rely...\n\nTo the Most High,\n\nWhose compassion cherishes life and abhors killing, whose mercy pardons all sins, great or small, so long as one submits to the Dao—relying on the boundless grace of nurturing and sustaining, I dare to brave boiling water and scorching fire, aspiring to offer even the smallest service. I humbly beseech your compassionate review: since the dawn of my awareness, my sins have been myriad and profound. I earnestly petition the Southern Supreme Lord, accompanied by one hundred and twenty officials and generals, to open the Gate of Life and augment my years; and the Lord of Southern Prosperity, with one hundred and twenty officials and generals, to traverse the eight directions, measure the stars, and cross the celestial cycles, that my name may be stricken from the register of death and my lifespan extended. May this body, fated for the Yellow Springs, be granted rebirth.\n\nShould malevolent spirits—unappeased and unpropitiated—exploit my weakness to cling to my form and inflict grievous harm, I beseech the dispatch of one hundred and twenty stalwart, valiant, and resolute officers and soldiers to seize, sever, and discern truth from falsehood, dispersing all such entities. Let the living and the dead be clearly distinguished, each restored to their rightful place. May this petition reach the light of day, and may my plea be answered.\n\nShould I recover, I vow to proclaim your merit and seek advancement in service. I implore the Most High to discern and pity my foolishness and inadequacy. Through the intercession of the two official envoys, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendants, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Deciding Clerks, the Chariot-Inspecting Red Talisman Clerks, the Gale-Riding Post Station Couriers, and the Memorial-Submitting Officers—each pair dispatched—I, your servant, humbly petition for the preservation of life and the alleviation of suffering. This memorial, one copy, is respectfully submitted to the Celestial Bureau. I await your decree with reverence.\n\nA Petition for Pardon and Life\nYour subordinate of such-and-such rank and name, with utmost trepidation, prostrates and kowtows, bowing twice to submit this plea.\n\nI humbly state: Having once submitted to the Dao and aligned with its qi, I received boundless grace, which I strove to emulate. Yet my sins have accumulated, inviting severe retribution. My illness, as previously described, has driven me to reflect on my transgressions and confess my faults, daring to submit this plea despite my guilt.\n\nOn such-and-such a day, I invoked the Merit Officers for healing, the Celestial Physicians, the Earthly Physicians, and the assisting medical clerks to attend to my bodily afflictions. Yet my sincerity has failed to move them, and my suffering has only worsened. My life hangs by a thread, and I am utterly undone, devoid of even the courage of liver and gall. Overwhelmed by what I witness, I dare to submit this second petition, beseeching the Merit Officers and the couriers of the four directions—Hu, Yue, Di, and Qiang—to proceed directly to the Palace of Peaceful Prosperity. There, I implore the Lord of Life Protection, the Lord of Longevity, and the Southern Supreme Lord—each accompanied by one hundred and twenty officials and generals—to expunge my name from the register of death and inscribe it anew in the book of life. May I, once every three months, be granted deliverance.\n\nI have braved death and defied reproach, deserving ten thousandfold punishment. Yet I beg for pardon, offering my recovery as proof of your mercy. I implore the Most High to discern and pity my foolishness and inadequacy. Through the intercession of the two official envoys, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendants, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Deciding Clerks, the Chariot-Inspecting Red Talisman Clerks, the Gale-Riding Post Station Couriers, and the Memorial-Submitting Officers—each pair dispatched—I, your servant, humbly petition for the preservation of health and the augmentation of my years. This memorial, one copy, is respectfully submitted to the Celestial Bureau. I await your decree with reverence.\n\nA Midday Petition for Life in Dire Distress\nYour subordinate of such-and-such rank and name, with utmost trepidation, prostrates and kowtows, bowing twice to submit this plea.\n\nI humbly state: I, a lowly descendant of an official lineage, have been fortunate to witness the flourishing of the Great Dao, delighting in its purity and rectitude. Embracing faith and entering its law, I bound my fate to the Three Heavens, a source of profound honor and comfort. Yet my foolishness and impurity have caused me to fail in harmonizing with the qi, and my body is afflicted with suffering. My pain is such that my life flickers like a candle in the wind. Though I have sought mercy from the Dao, my illness remains unalleviated, growing worse by the day. Fearful of becoming dust, I am filled with dread and unable to compose myself. I turn to you, my lord, to plead for salvation.\n\nUpon reviewing my condition, I find it perilous indeed. Perhaps my sins are too deeply entwined for pardon, or my allotted years have reached their final moments. Yet I recall that the true qi of the Great Dao nurtures all beings, capable of restoring vitality to withered bones and reviving the bloom of spring upon winter-stricken trees. To raise the dead from their coffins requires only your grace. Relying on your boundless compassion, I beg for the extension of my life.\n\nI earnestly beseech the five Lords of Longevity in the Palace of Southern Prosperity, each accompanied by one hundred and twenty officials and generals, to journey north to the Palace of the Dark Yin and the Jade Maidens. There, I implore them to redeem my form, that my nearly severed life may be granted the mercy of rebirth. May your virtue ascend to honor the lofty spirits of the august elders and descend to fulfill the yearning for life even in the lowliest of creatures. I implore the Three Masters to review and discern my plea.\n\nIn my foolishness and inadequacy, I rely on the intercession of the two official envoys, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendants, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Deciding Clerks, the Chariot-Inspecting Red Talisman Clerks, the Gale-Riding Post Station Couriers, and the Memorial-Submitting Officers—each pair dispatched. I, your servant, humbly petition for the protection of my ailing body and the extension of my allotted years. This memorial, one copy, is respectfully submitted to the Celestial Bureau. I await your decree with reverence.\n\nA Petition to Restrain the Hun and Po Souls\nYour subordinate of such-and-such rank and name, with utmost trepidation, prostrates and kowtows, bowing twice to submit this plea.\n\nI humbly state: I, having submitted to...\n\nThe Most High Lords and Venerable Dao Qi, by whose grace I am sheltered, have ever brought me joy. Yet this mortal, unworthy and ill-formed, has suddenly fallen gravely ill. My entire household, young and old, reflects upon its transgressions and humbly submits to the Great Dao. Though we have not yet been granted relief, my suffering persists, growing more severe with each passing day. I fear that in an instant, my life may hang by a thread—my qi scattered, my spirit departed, never to return. Terrified, I implore your servant to plead on my behalf. With this memorial, I dare to submit my petition, beseeching that one Pearl-and-Jade Lord from the Earthly Principles Palace, accompanied by one hundred and twenty officials and generals—clad in crimson robes and red headbands, bearing staffs and iron axes—be dispatched at once. May they bestow upon me the one hundred and twenty breaths of life, restrain my three *hun* and seven *po* souls from leaving my body, and prolong my years. Let my name be inscribed in the Jade Register, sparing me from the roster of those to be eradicated, that I may forever remain among the seed-people. I implore the Most High to discern my plea and take pity on my foolishness and inadequacy.\n\nRelying on the intercession of the two official envoys, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendants, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Deciding Clerks, the Chariot-Inspecting Red Talisman Clerks, the Gale-Riding Post Station Couriers, and the Memorial-Submitting Officers—each pair dispatched—I, your servant, humbly petition for deliverance from peril, rescue from calamity, and the extension of my life. This memorial, one copy, is respectfully submitted to the Celestial Bureau. I await your decree with reverence.\n\nA Petition to Dissolve the Three Offices’ Death Sentence\nYour subordinate of such-and-such rank and name, with utmost trepidation, prostrates and kowtows, bowing twice to submit this plea.\n\nI humbly state: I, having strayed from the Dao and lost harmony, have violated the will of the Primordial Beginning. My body is now subjected to the severe judgment of the Three Offices. On such-and-such a day of such-and-such a month, I fell gravely ill, suffering pain in such-and-such a place, unable to eat or drink. I have set forth my grievances and implored your servant to intercede, beseeching relief. In accordance with the teachings of my masters, I have inquired into the transgressions for which I am punished. I have confessed my faults in writing and begged for my life. My illness, persisting for days, grows ever more dire. My household, young and old, is in disarray, my liver and gall laid bare upon the earth. Unable to bear the peril to this mortal’s life, I dare once more to submit this memorial, touching my head to the ground in supplication.\n\nI implore the Most High to pardon this mortal’s myriad deaths and dire straits. If my organs are full of sin and my fate sealed, my name entered among the dead, and my three lives exhausted, grant me but a moment’s reprieve. Hold me accountable for future good deeds, that I may repent my past transgressions and cultivate virtue henceforth. I humbly petition for the presence of the Heavenly One Lord, the True One Lord, the Life-Nurturing Lord, the Life-Extending Lord, and the Life-Rescuing Lord—five in all—each accompanied by one hundred and twenty officials and generals. May this memorial be presented to the Celestial Bureau of the Vast Heavenly Expanse, to the Northern Star Office of Life, and to the Jade Desk of Lord Han’s Gate, that my death sentence from the Three Offices be dissolved and my name firmly inscribed in the register of the living.\n\nI further petition for the dispatch of one hundred thousand soldiers under the command of the Supreme Heavenly Lord of Life, tasked with capturing the one hundred and twenty death-dealing ghosts, turning death into life. I also beseech two hundred Jade Maidens of Yuegan to replenish my granaries and further extend my years. May this memorial, upon submission, swiftly secure your pardon, allowing me to emerge from eternal night and once more behold the sun and moon. May the generals, officials, and soldiers report my merits and recommend my advancement as a token of my sincerity.\n\nI implore the Most High to discern my plea. In my foolishness and inadequacy, I rely on the intercession of the two official envoys, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendants, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Deciding Clerks, the Chariot-Inspecting Red Talisman Clerks, the Gale-Riding Post Station Couriers, and the Memorial-Submitting Officers—each pair dispatched. I, your servant, humbly petition for the extension of my years, the augmentation of my allotted span, the protection of my ailing body, and the support of my declining strength. This memorial, one copy, is respectfully submitted to the Celestial Bureau. I await your decree with reverence.\n\n*Scroll Two of the Most High’s Proclamation of Universal Assistance and Transformation, concluded.*\n*Category: Petitions and Memorials of the Cavernous Mystery Division*\n\n*The Most High’s Proclamation of Compassionate Assistance and Transformation*\n*Sutra Title:* *The Most High’s Proclamation of Universal Assistance and Transformation*\n*Compiled by:* Tang-dynasty Daoist Du Guangting\n*Five scrolls*\n*Source edition:* *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity Tradition*, *Cavernous Mystery Division, Petitions and Memorials*\n\n---\n\n*Scroll Three of the Most High’s Proclamation of Compassionate Assistance and Transformation*\n*Collected by:* Master of Broad Accomplishment, Du Guangting\n\n**Memorial for the Seizure of the Stone-Dwelling Dog-Child Ghost**\n\nYour servant, [Rank and Name], with reverence and awe, prostrates and bows twice, respectfully submitting this memorial:\n\nI, [Name], of [State], [County], [Township], [Village], [Office and Name], now afflicted by illness and misfortune, am besieged by malevolent ghosts. I humbly petition the Celestial Officials, Generals, Officers, and Soldiers to seize and capture the Stone-Dwelling Dog-Child Ghost. The names and titles of the Celestial Officials are listed as follows:\n\nI petition the Great General of the Mysterious Elder, with one hundred thousand soldiers.\nI petition the Great General of Majestic Radiance, with one hundred thousand soldiers.\nI petition the Great General of Earthly Terrain, with one hundred thousand soldiers.\nI petition the Great General of Stone Immortals, with one hundred thousand soldiers.\nI petition the Great General of the Five Colors, with one hundred thousand soldiers.\nI petition the Great General of the Nodal Canopy, with one hundred thousand soldiers.\nI petition the Great General of the Azure Canopy, with one hundred thousand soldiers.\nI petition the Great General of the Vermilion Canopy, with one hundred thousand soldiers.\nI petition the Great General of the White Canopy, with one hundred thousand soldiers.\nI petition the Great General of the Black Canopy, with one hundred thousand soldiers.\nI petition the Great General of the Yellow Canopy, with one hundred thousand soldiers.\nI petition the Great General of Celestial Supervision, with one hundred thousand soldiers.\n\nThe aforementioned twelve divisions of Celestial Officials, Generals, Officers, and Soldiers shall descend in unison, filling the heavens and shaking the earth, arriving directly at my household and entering my body to seize and capture the Stone-Dwelling Dog-Child Ghost harbored within. The Water Officials, Wet-Nurses, and miscellaneous spirits shall execute them forthwith, manifesting the majesty of the Great Dao. *Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*\n\nBy decree of the [Year], the [Month], the [Day], and the [Hour], I, the Libationer and your servant, respectfully dispatch this memorial to the Prefect of Qiushi Commandery in Baobi Prefecture, the Magistrate of Kongli County, and the officials of Fengting Township and Shiye Village. The Stone-Dwelling Dog-Child Ghost within the jurisdiction of the aforementioned officials has transgressed without restraint. This petty ghost has trespassed into foreign territory, afflicting my household and my person with illness—wailing day and night, festering sores, dysentery, malaria, and unceasing emaciation. Upon examination, the symptoms confirm the harm wrought by the Dog-Child Ghost, the Water Officials, and the Wet-Nurses. Each resides within its respective commandery, yet the prefects responsible have failed in their diligence, allowing these spirits to roam freely and injure the people of heaven. Henceforth, they must exercise meticulous oversight and permit no further violations. Should these spirits dare to return and harm my person again, they shall be seized and executed without mercy. The prefects in charge shall be subject to separate disciplinary action, *all in accordance with the statutes and ordinances of the Most High Lord Lao.*\n\n*From the Supreme Mystery Capital, [further invocations follow].*\n\nRespectfully submitted, this memorial is filed for [State], [County], [Township], [Village].\n\nThe disciple of the Great Dao, [Name], having long been entrusted to the Most High Lords of the Great Dao and the Venerable Masters, has relied upon the incense and offerings of the Three Masters for self-preservation and governance. Yet my cultivation and service have often faltered, and my movements and stillness have brought no benefit. Since the [day] of the [month], my son/daughter [Name] has fallen ill: limbs heavy, sores swollen, wailing day and night in pain, unable to nurse, unresponsive to medicine. Tracing the cause of this affliction, I fear it is the Dog-Child beneath the stones, the Water Officials, the Wet-Nurses who wash before the grove, the New Brides, and other ghosts lurking in our chambers, seizing our children, harming and killing them. I humbly submit this memorial, beseeching their eradication to save my child’s life, that they may thrive, grow to maturity, and continue our lineage. The depth of my distress moves me to pity. Unable to bear this suffering, I risk transgression and submit this memorial to the Heavenly Courts.\n\nI implore the Most High Lord Lao, the Venerable Masters, the Celestial Masters, the Female Masters, and the Lords of the Five Qi under the Three Masters to extend your divine protection over me. Today, I invoke:\n- The Azure Tiger of Mount Tai to devour the dog’s head and liver,\n- The Vermilion Tiger of Mount Heng to devour the dog’s heart,\n- The White Tiger of Mount Hua to devour the dog’s lungs,\n- The Black Tiger of Mount Zhen to devour the dog’s kidneys,\n- The Yellow Tiger of Mount Song to devour the dog’s spleen.\n\nMay the Tiger Armies of the Five Directions descend as one to consume the Dog-Child beneath the stones, the minor ghosts, the Water Officials, the Wet-Nurses, and the Five Pestilential Qi. May they hunt down and slay all those bound by curses, newly dead or long departed, malevolent spirits and specters—those who falsely style themselves:\n- Governors of Wall Commandery,\n- Prefects of Stone Mound Prefecture,\n- Magistrates of Kongli County,\n- Lords of Fengting Township and Shiye Village,\n- Cliff Kings, Generals of Forced Slaughter, Generals of Benevolent Connection to Heaven,\n- The Azure Dog General of the East, the Vermilion Dog General of the South, the White Dog General of the West, the Black Dog General of the North, the Yellow Dog General of the Center,\n- The Heavenly Gatekeeping Dog-Children, the Earthly Door-Guarding Dog-Children,\n- The wolves with yellow heads, black mouths, azure ears, white paws, and white feet—some fifteen feet tall, others twelve—\n- The Heavenly Prison Wet-Nurses, the Courtyard-Washing New Brides, who roam above and below, harming the young.\n\nNone shall escape the true qi of the Most High. I now dispatch talismans to the Governor of Wall Commandery and the Prefect of Stone Mound Prefecture, commanding them to exercise meticulous oversight and prevent further violations. I beseech the twelve divisions of celestial officials, generals, and soldiers to enter my body, encircle me front and back, and vigilantly guard against these spirits. Capture the Dog-Children, minor ghosts, the Five Pestilential Qi, the cold-malaria demons, the spirits of violent death, the newly dead and long departed, the archers and hunters, the ghosts of those shot or trapped. Cast nets and snares, eradicate them in sequence, and banish all my afflictions. May the might of the True and Orthodox Dao be manifest. May my child’s life be preserved, their suffering ended, their nursing restored, and their parents blessed. May we forever serve as incense-offering devotees of the Great Dao, our descendants unbroken, our home purified, and our household at peace. This I pledge as proof of my devotion.\n\nI humbly beseech the Boundless Great Dao, the Most High Masters, and the celestial officials to review this memorial and swiftly transmit it upward. Bestow upon me the qi of the Dao, that it may shield my body. I have investigated these malevolent spirits: they share no bond with my family, nor do they have descendants of their own. Though we have offered timely sacrifices, they have no right to afflict us. According to the statutes of the Orthodox Unity and the *Green Ghosts of the Civil Code*, they are subject to execution to pacify the people. I now petition:\n- The Lord of Calamity’s Punishment, with 120 officials and generals, to govern the Granary of Brightness,\n- The Star Lord of the Capital, with 120 officials and generals, to govern the Palace of Pure Canopy,\n- The Luminous Harm-Averting Qi Officers,\n- The Heavenly August Valiant Soldiers, 300,000 strong, to descend as one.\n\nMay they purge the malevolent spirits of violent death, the heterodox ghosts of unvenerated lineages, and all who falsely claim kinship. Seize, execute, annihilate, and sever them, leaving no trace. I further petition:\n- Fifty soldiers each for the spirits of male and female misfortune, those who died of illness, drowning, imprisonment, burning, or by blade, beast, or wolf, to eradicate all foreign spirits and unvenerated gods who dare to afflict the innocent.\n\nThese spirits have no connection to our sacrifices, no shared altars, no kinship. They must be severed utterly. Should they dare to return, may rivers flow backward, white stones float, a thousand dogs tangle in silk, horses grow six-foot horns, fifty three-legged crows and three hundred nine-tailed foxes appear—only then may they seek me. Otherwise, let them be sundered from me by heaven and earth for ten thousand years, never to harass me again.\n\nI also petition the Judgment Gods of the Five Directions—East, South, West, North, and Center—each with twelve officials and generals, to sever all recurring afflictions: year after year, month after month, day after day, hour after hour. May my illness vanish, my suffering cease, my life be secure, my soul purified, and all malevolent spirits subdued. May the true qi flow freely, and all pain and torment be dispelled. May I receive this grace.\n\nTo sever all unvenerated spirits and prevent further memorials, I, the humble official [Name], prostrate myself in awe and reverence, kowtowing twice to submit this memorial. I have reviewed the documents for [State], [County], [Township], [Village]. Your disciple [Name], fortunate to have long served the Great Dao under its protection, has known joy in its shelter. Yet my cultivation has faltered, inviting censure. Recently, I have suffered the depredations of malevolent ghosts, my life imperiled. I have received their pleas for memorials to distinguish their cases. Unable to bear this, I risk transgression and submit this memorial to the Heavenly Courts.\n\nI pray the Most High Lord Lao, the Venerable Masters, the Celestial and Female Masters, and the Lords of the Five Qi under the Three Masters will review this humble servant’s memorial and transmit it swiftly. Bestow upon me the qi of the Dao to shield my body. I have investigated these malevolent spirits: they share no bond with my family, nor do they have descendants. Though they receive timely sacrifices, they have no right to afflict us. According to the statutes of the Orthodox Unity and the *Green Ghosts of the Civil Code*, they are subject to execution to pacify the people. I now petition:\n- The Lord of Calamity’s Punishment, with 120 officials and generals, to govern the Granary of Brightness,\n- The Star Lord of the Capital, with 120 officials and generals, to govern the Palace of Pure Canopy,\n- The Luminous Harm-Averting Qi Officers,\n- The Heavenly August Valiant Soldiers, 300,000 strong, to descend as one.\n\nMay they purge the malevolent spirits of violent death, the heterodox ghosts of unvenerated lineages, and all who falsely claim kinship. Seize, execute, annihilate, and sever them, leaving no trace. I further petition fifty soldiers each for the spirits of male and female misfortune, those who died of illness, drowning, imprisonment, burning, or by blade, beast, or wolf, to eradicate all foreign spirits and unvenerated gods who dare to afflict the innocent. These spirits have no connection to our sacrifices, no shared altars, no kinship. They must be severed utterly. Should they dare to return, may rivers flow backward, white stones float, a thousand dogs tangle in silk, horses grow six-foot horns, fifty three-legged crows and three hundred nine-tailed foxes appear—only then may they seek me. Otherwise, let them be sundered from me by heaven and earth for ten thousand years, never to harass me again.\n\nI prostrate myself in awe and reverence, kowtowing twice to submit this memorial.\n\nThe boundless grace of the Great Dao, by the merciful consideration of the Most High, is thus invoked. Your servant humbly petitions, on behalf of [Name], for the celestial officials and soldiers to eradicate and sever all foreign spirits—those of alien surnames, malevolent guests, and the wrongfully dead—who dare to forge false connections. A writ of extermination, the *Great Chapter*, shall be presented to the [Name] Bureau, awaiting its proclamation.\n\nWith reverence and awe, I kowtow twice to submit this memorial.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial for Dissolving Oaths and Curses of the Living and Dead**\n\n[Rank and Name], in utmost reverence and awe, kowtows and bows twice to address this petition. As recorded in the documents: In [State], [County], [Township], [Village], the disciple [Name], aged [X] years, born on the [X] day of the [X] month, today presents this prayer. By fortunate fate, I was born into the Daoist gate and have revered the Great Dao, my name inscribed in the Mystic Register. Yet, despite years of devotion, my practice has been flawed, and misfortune has repeatedly befallen me. In the [X] year and [X] month, I suddenly fell ill, and the affliction has yet to abate. Day and night, I am consumed by dread, my life hanging by a thread. Upon examination, I fear I may have violated sacred oaths, suffered from hidden curses, or been harmed by malevolent forces. The suffering lingers, and my distress is boundless. I beseech this memorial to dissolve these bonds.\n\nYour servant, unworthy as I am, dares to submit this petition to the Celestial Bureau, imploring the Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Elder, the Celestial Master, the Female Master, and the Three Masters, along with the Lords of the Five Qi, to deign to review this humble memorial and transmit it in due course. May the true qi of the Great Dao envelop me. I petition the celestial officials and soldiers to dissolve all curses and oaths from my ancestors—nine generations and seven lineages, thirty-six forebears—that may now afflict me. Whether they invoked spirits, called upon heaven and earth, pointed to the sun, moon, and stars, or swore by local shrines, talismanic temples, or any form—animate or inanimate, sentient or insentient—trees, stones, grasses, mountains, rivers, fire, or creatures; whether they slaughtered animals, drank blood, or ate flesh; whether they carved stones or broke metal as testimony—all such oaths, made by my forebears, now bring calamity upon their descendants. My illness persists, and my life is imperiled. Should I perish and descend to the Nine Springs, even the lowly sparrow and rat would cling to life. I beg for mercy and deliverance.\n\nI humbly petition the Great Bing Lord of the Red Xun Palace, with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to dissolve the curses and oaths of the living and dead from past and present. I further petition the Breaker of Malevolence Lord, with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to seize and sever the spirits of curses and oaths. I petition the Great Protector General, with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to safeguard the afflicted. May my illness be cured, my calamities dispelled, my years extended, and my countenance restored. May all curses cease.\n\nFor oaths sworn on the days of Zi, Chou, Yin, or Mao, may the divine lords of Zi, Chou, Yin, and Mao dissolve them. For oaths sworn on the days of Chen, Si, Wu, or Wei, may the divine lords of Chen, Si, Wu, and Wei dissolve them. For oaths sworn on the days of Shen, You, Xu, or Hai, may the divine lords of Shen, You, Xu, and Hai dissolve them. For oaths sworn by living creatures, may they be dissolved according to their kind. For oaths sworn by broken metal, stone, earth, or wood, may they dissolve of their own accord. May ten thousand oaths be eradicated, and a thousand calamities cease. On the day my wish is fulfilled, I shall receive profound grace.\n\nBy the merciful consideration of the Most High, this is thus invoked. Your servant humbly petitions, on behalf of [Name], for the celestial officials and soldiers to dissolve all oaths and curses from past and present, and to protect and heal the afflicted. A memorial, the *Chapter for Dissolving Oaths*, is presented to the [Name] Bureau, awaiting its proclamation.\n\nWith reverence and awe, I kowtow twice to submit this memorial.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial for Extending Life and Dispelling Calamities**\n\n[Rank and Name], in utmost reverence and awe, kowtows and bows twice to address this petition. As recorded in the documents: In [State], [County], [Township], [Village], the disciple of the Great Dao, [Official Title and Name], aged [X] years, born on the [X] day of the [X] month, with a household of [X] persons, today prostrates and presents this prayer. I beseech the Great Dao of the Most High to accept this memorial, to support the weak, dispel calamities, extend my life, secure my fate, bring peace to my home, pacify the dragon spirits, protect my family, safeguard my wealth and fortune, resolve disasters, and preserve my life. My plea is earnest, and the reason is just.\n\nYour servant, unworthy as I am, dares to submit this petition to the Celestial Bureau, imploring the Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Elder, the Celestial Master, the Female Master, and the Three Masters, along with the celestial officials and lords, to deign to review this humble memorial and transmit it in due course. May the true qi of the Great Dao envelop my household, ensuring the safety of all its members, dispelling calamities, dissolving misfortune, and ending all suffering.\n\nI humbly petition the Life-Extending Lord of the Eastern Palace, with one hundred twenty officials, generals, and soldiers, to dispel the Three Disasters and Nine Calamities. I petition the Life-Extending Lord of the Southern Palace, with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to dispel plagues, fires, and disasters.

I petition the Cloud-Dwelling Qiongqi, Devourer of Ghosts, with four hundred thousand soldiers of the Three-Legged Crows, and four hundred thousand soldiers of the Nine-Tailed Foxes. Together, may they descend as one, unite in purpose, ascend through the Gate of Heaven to the Nine Heavens, descend through the Gate of Earth to the Nine Hells, and traverse the Five Peaks, Four Rivers, Three Rivers, Four Seas, Nine Jiang, Eight Extremes, the Water Palace of the River Earl, Mount Tai, Fengdu, all great earthly prisons, the Three Terraces, Four Offices, and all celestial and terrestrial bureaus. May they dissolve all sins, calamities, punishments, and disasters—past and present, a thousand and ten thousand—of my family, kin, and dependents, young and old, male and female. May all disputes be resolved, and all punishments erased.\n\nFirst, dissolve the calamities of the Celestial Net and Earthly Web.

May my name be entered into the Jade Calendar and Green Register, granting me a lifespan of one hundred twenty years, forevermore.\n\nMay the myriad-year Dao and the seed-people of the world enjoy prosperity in all their comings and goings, with auspicious divinations and dreams, harmony in public and private affairs, and ever-extending years of fortune. For all meritorious and diligent heavenly officials, lords, generals, officers, and soldiers, may their merits be reported and promotions granted in accordance with the Three Assemblies’ comprehensive statutes, that their vows and pledges may not be betrayed. With profound grace, may the Most High review and govern these matters.\n\nYour servant, with reverence and trepidation, bows his head and prostrates himself, kneeling twice to make this known: On behalf of the official so-and-so, whose household has suffered misfortune, I distinguish and enumerate the calamities and adversities, and humbly present a petition—a *Great Petition for Dissolving Disasters and Crossing Adversity*—to the heavenly officials, officers, and soldiers, to be submitted to the Bureau of [such-and-such]. Awaiting your decree, I am filled with awe and fear, bowing my head and prostrating myself twice to make this entreaty.\n\n---\n\n*Scroll Three of the Most High’s Proclamations of Earnest Assistance in Transformation concludes.*\n*Scroll Four of the Most High’s Proclamations of Compassionate Assistance in Transformation begins.*\n\n**Petition of the Six Harmonies’ Life-Calculation, Upper Grade of the Primordial Sovereign**\nComposed by Master Guangcheng, Du Guangting\n\nFrom the humble position of [such-and-such], with reverence and trepidation, bowing my head and prostrating myself twice, I humbly submit this petition: Your disciple [so-and-so], having recited the full litany of grievances, states that of late, his household has been afflicted with misfortune—his dwelling plagued by inauspicious vacuity, his dreams tangled and disordered, and all affairs devoid of good fortune. Today, I knock my head to the ground and lay forth these supplications, beseeching that your disciple’s life-calculation be extended, his years increased, his lifespan lengthened, and all obstructions and harms dissolved. May the year, month, and day of his birth be examined and stabilized, disasters dissolved, and adversities crossed, that his body and life may be safeguarded.\n\nYet your disciple, though but a humble straw-dog of lowly substance, has presumptuously been granted the honor of a most noble existence. Though his years be as fleeting as the morning mushroom, he has fortuitously encountered the true and orthodox Dao. His ancestors revered and honored the Mysterious Gate; his descendants, in unbroken succession, have pledged their lives to the Most High Great Dao, submitting to the jurisdiction of the Lords and Elders. He has been blessed with their compassionate protection, a debt as weighty as the high heavens, and has relied upon their nurturing cultivation, a grace as profound as the vast earth.\n\nYet your disciple was born amid the Five Turbidities, his fate entwined with the Three Calamities. His perceptions are stained by the Six Passions, his karma entangled with the Nine Adversities. His heart and spirit are confused and troubled, his wisdom dim and clouded. In his devotion to the Dao, he has often strayed from its true teachings, causing the numinous spirits to withhold their protection and ghostly *qi* to encroach upon him. For years now, he has known only hardship and setbacks. All he has witnessed and encountered has been inauspicious, with no recourse for redress. When afflictions arise, disasters multiply, and lawsuits befall him, his dwelling is never at peace, and his household suffers from emaciation and illness.\n\nSince the beginning of this year, as spring and summer have arrived, flocks of birds have cried out in disarray, their voices inharmonious and unceasing. His dreams have been devoid of goodness, and decline, hardship, and disaster have arisen. His aspirations have all strayed from their original intent. Perhaps it is your disciple and his wife who are afflicted, or perhaps his fate and lifespan are in conflict. The birth month and the *zi* and *wu* hours clash; the birth day clashes with his body. There is discord with the birth year, and his calculations are unstable. The birth month, too, is irregular, and the stars and celestial reckonings of his destined hour are unsteady. Once this is determined, it will bind him for all his life, and the cycles of his fate will be fixed forever.\n\nIf it is not a convergence of calamities and taboos, then it is his dwelling that has suffered disaster. Perhaps he has encountered a year of the Seven Harms, or a year of the Five Ghosts. Perhaps it is a month of the Four Killers, or a time of the Six Harms. Perhaps he faces the anxieties of the Eight Difficulties, or the taboos of the Seven Injuries. Perhaps he is beset by the misfortunes of the Nine Pitfalls, or the disasters of the Ten Severances. Or perhaps your disciple has moved his residence at an inauspicious time, failing to choose an auspicious day, so that his comings and goings miss the proper hours. His endeavors have offended malevolent spirits; his mornings and evenings are disordered. He has transgressed against the heavenly Dao, and there is no means to avert the resulting misfortune.\n\nPerhaps his wife and children are afflicted, or his parents are harmed by punishment. His fate is in conflict, his year clashes with Jupiter. Perhaps he has entered the Gate of Heaven, or encountered the dire region of the Nine Adversities of Absolute Yang. Perhaps he has approached the Gate of Earth, or the inauspicious place where Absolute Yin enters the tomb. Above, he is entangled in the Heavenly Net; below, he is ensnared in the Earthly Web. His *hun*-soul is imprisoned, his *po*-soul is struck; he is confined in the Three Bureaus. Yin and yang are blocked and separated, and this is no mere taboo of annihilation. In this year of exhaustion and severance, the very present moment is fraught with peril. The declines of the past have not yet been resolved, and new adversities have arisen. Calamities converge, and misfortune repeatedly befalls him. He is constantly beset by harm, and his household is in turmoil. Your disciple, at this very moment, is deeply unsettled, and his family, great and small, is filled with dread.\n\nIf not for the support of the Mysterious Ultimate and the advancement of life-saving aid, there would be no means to escape these profound disasters. If he does not petition the hidden bureaus and the perfected ones above to dispel these misfortunes, how can he avert these calamities? His entire household is filled with terror, and they turn their hearts toward the gate of benevolent protection. Bowing their heads to the Most Perfected, they pledge themselves beneath the incense and flame. With this petition, they beseech grace and entrust their lives to your servant.\n\nThe depth of their earnestness is truly pitiable; their sincerity is profound and weighty, and cannot be denied. Though your humble servant is foolish and ignorant, slow to comprehend the Mysterious Regulations, and though his shallow understanding cannot fathom their profound meaning, he has earnestly recounted these brief observations and sought to address the essential matters.\n\nMoreover, he fears that your disciple’s *hun*-soul and *po*-soul have been seized and bewildered by the hundred ghosts, and that his name has been falsely recorded in the Black Register of the Right Palace, making it difficult to dissolve. Therefore, he humbly petitions the various departments of heavenly officials, lords, generals, officers, and soldiers, as enumerated below:\n\nPetitioning the **Lord of Red Heaven Who Generates Life-Calculation and Dissolves Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord Who Preserves Life and Dissolves Opposition**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord Who Protects and Crosses Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord Who Guards Life-Calculation and Crosses Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord Who Augments Life-Calculation and Crosses Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord Who Extends Life-Calculation and Crosses Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord Who Continues Life-Calculation and Crosses Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord Who Upholds Life-Calculation and Crosses Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord of Upper Clarity Who Doubles Life-Calculation and Crosses Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord Who Stabilizes Life-Calculation and Crosses Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord Who Generates Life-Calculation and Crosses Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord Who Preserves Life-Calculation and Crosses Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord Who Summons Life-Calculation and Crosses Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord Who Extracts Life-Calculation and Crosses Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals.\n\nThe above petition invokes the celestial officials, generals, and hosts of the preceding sections, each in their full assembly, to act on behalf of your disciple [Name], to retrieve and redeem their hun and po souls, and to reconcile them with the Black Register of the Right Palace within the body and the Left Contract of the Register of Eternal Life, thereby severing and absolving all deep transgressions and grave faults committed by your disciple [Name] from past lives to the present.

the hundred ghosts—be entreated to seek and retrieve the three hun and seven po of your disciple [Name]. Should they have been wrongfully seized and bound by the hundred ghosts in any of the aforementioned bureaus or gates, may the Most High and Great Dao deign to peruse this memorial, that it be swiftly conveyed on high. May the luminous essence, form, shadow, and spirit-qi of your disciple [Name] be pursued, released, and restored to his body, fully reconstituted, that his life’s allotment be extended, his misfortunes dissolved, and his vital qi spread and flow. May the hundred spirits come to his aid and defense. On the day his prayers are answered, he shall bear in reverence the boundless grace of the Great Dao.\n\nThis day, the petition is duly presented at the Gate of the Three Honored Ones, submitted to the Gate of the Celestial Officials, passed through the Gate of the Three Masters, and laid before the jade table of the Most High Lord Lao.\n\nAt the Great Mystery Capital of the Orthodox Unity and Balanced Qi, it is said: Through this disciple’s unfamiliarity with the rites and precepts, he has invited misfortune. Of late, his dwelling has known no peace; his household has suffered illness and adversity. For years, he has sought aid in vain, his dreams filled with ominous emptiness, his home thick with ghostly qi, his spirits unsettled. Disasters and decline have followed one upon another. Today, he comes before me, beseeching memorials and petitions to harmonize the destinies of husband and wife, to determine the stellar influences, to dispel calamities, and to safeguard his life.\n\nFrom the day I received the Daoist precepts, I pledged before the Three Officials to uphold and assist my masters and elders, making salvation my foremost duty. In all matters of supplication, I may not refuse or reject. Thus, I respectfully act on behalf of your disciple [Name] to augment his lifespan, to retrieve and absolve his name from the registers of the dead, to redeem his hun and po, to dissolve his misfortunes and taboos, and to protect his life, as herein petitioned.\n\nThe Daoist methods of the Most High Lords and Perfected Ones are recorded in the Mysterious Capital, revered under the Three Heavens. The true qi of the Dao and the law are sustained by incense and memorials. Within the gates of the Dao, we earnestly exhort and transform. Dwelling in this abode, beset by all manner of setbacks and misfortune, I have learned of the rites of the Numinous Treasure masters for repentance through purification, and of the Orthodox Unity Alliance’s威 for establishing merit to atone for transgressions. Thus, with utmost sincerity, I turn my heart toward the Mysterious Gate, offering my earnest devotion and presenting this memorial to dispel disaster and resolve hardship.\n\nYet I fear that your disciple [Name] treads the snares of the earthly net, his head caught in the heavenly toils, his stars exhausted, and baleful influences descending upon him. Deeply apprehensive that he may at any moment fall prey to calamity, he entreats the Most High Lord Lao to bestow the primordial qi, flowing downward to nurture and shield his life.\n\nI respectfully invoke the sixty-two divisions of celestial officials, generals, clerks, and soldiers listed above to proceed in order to redeem your disciple’s hun and po. Let them journey to the celestial prisons and earthly hells of the hundred ghosts, seek out your disciple [Name]’s hun and po, and restore them to his body, harmonizing his limbs and settling his spirit. Let his name be removed from the registers of the dead and his lifespan secured, inscribed in the jade calendar of the left contract, that he may forever enjoy primordial auspiciousness.\n\nShould the misfortunes of your disciple converge, and this memorial fail to reach the heavens, I now offer one bolt of plain silk, one *dou* and two *sheng* of rice, one hundred twenty *chi* of silk thread, and a pair of silver rings as tokens of faith in the Daoist gate, to manifest the sincerity of my devotion. Just as withered trees may flourish with nurtured branches and leaves, or depleted granaries be replenished with measures of grain, may a shortened lifespan be extended in length, that he may join the ranks of the ancient seed-people.\n\nI further invoke the Primordial Essence Father and Mother and one hundred thousand attendants to descend together, bearing this memorial directly to the jade table of the Supreme Jade Emperor. I also invoke the Eastern King Father and Western Queen Mother, each with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to descend together and redeem your disciple’s hun and po, augment his years and extend his life, avert disasters and repel misfortune. May the lingering qi of departed kin—those who have passed before and after, and any malevolent influences—be severed and dissolved.\n\nAfter this memorial is presented, may his dwelling be purified and harmonious, his household joyous and secure, free from illness and misfortune. When his prayers are answered, he shall receive the profound grace of the Most High.\n\n*This concludes the fourth scroll of the* Most High’s Proclamation of Universal Assistance in Transformation.\n*This is the fifth scroll of the* Most High’s Proclamation of Compassionate Assistance in Transformation.\n\nMaster Guangcheng’s Compilation by Du Guangting\n*Memorial for Invoking the Mandate of the Three Heavens*\n\nFrom the humble petitioner, [Rank and Name], prostrate and trembling with reverence, kowtowing and bowing twice, I humbly submit this memorial:\n\nI, [Name], along with my household, hereby declare: of late, our home has been beset by misfortune. Our dwelling is inauspicious and desolate; our dreams are filled with ugliness and dread. Ghostly qi swirls in confusion, and wherever we turn, we meet with adversity. Nothing prospers as it should. Our wealth dissipates, our livelihoods falter, our fields and silkworms yield little, and our endeavors bring no profit.\n\nSince the [day] of [month], I have suddenly fallen ill. My limbs grow weak, my appetite wanes, and my complexion turns sallow. My hun and po scatter, malevolent spirits bring calamity, and evil ghosts stir disaster. My name has been recorded in the Register of Deaths of the Three Offices, bound within the Five Punishments and Six Harms. Above, I am ensnared by the Heavenly Net; below, I am entangled by the Earthly Snare. I fear that I may not escape these trials of misfortune and disaster. Divination and examination of my form and omens yield no auspicious signs. Moreover, I dread that within this year, my life may be struck by calamity, my allotted years cut short, and the multitude of perils may hasten my end. Disasters and baleful influences now press upon me.\n\nThus, I hasten to summon your servant to my home, beseeching you to present this memorial and invoke the extension of my life and destiny, to bolster my declining years and deliver me from peril, to augment my years and prolong my life, to retrieve my hun and po. I implore the Mandate of the Three Heavens and the memorial for dispelling disasters and averting taboos, to safeguard my life, dissolve calamities, and deliver me from peril. I seek to expel the lingering qi of departed officials, the malevolent influences within and without, the spectral and demonic, and the ghostly marauders lurking in the rear courtyard.\n\nI respectfully invoke the celestial officials, generals, clerks, and soldiers of the Heavenly Bureaus, as itemized below:\n\nI invoke the Heavenly Bureau to command:\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Prefect of Mount Tai, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Three Offices of Mount Tai, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Five Offices of Mount Tai, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Stewards of Mount Tai, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Merit Clerks of Mount Tai, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Five Paths Great Spirits of Mount Tai, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Five Prisons Ministers of Mount Tai, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Keepers of Destiny of Mount Tai, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of Summoning of Mount Tai, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of Deliverance of Mount Tai, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of Life Extension of Mount Tai, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Three Mounds and Five Graves of Mount Tai, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Keepers of Destiny, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of Deliverance from Peril, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of Severing Repeated Afflictions, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of Longevity, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Northern Controller of Destiny, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Minister of Works, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Registrars, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Filial and Spring Clerks, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Recorders, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Seven Prisons Clerks, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Examiners of Life, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Five Earth Altars, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Seven Hearths, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Five Covenants and Seven Oaths, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Twelve Monthly Constellations, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the General of the Grand Year, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Earth Altars and Spirit Shrines, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Three Offices for Redeeming Destiny, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Three Offices for Protecting Destiny, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate for Retrieving the Three Hun and Seven Po, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate for Extending Life and Delivering from Death, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate for Dissolving Disasters and Atoning for Transgressions, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate for Reversing Fate and Transforming Form, with one hundred twenty officials and generals.\n\nIn total, thirty-six divisions of celestial officials, generals, clerks, and soldiers, each with one hundred twenty attendants, and one hundred thousand troops, are hereby assembled.\n\nMay they examine and inquire into the thirty-six divisions of Mount Tai, the twelve Controllers of Destiny of Kunlun, and the prisons and shrines of the spirit altars, to redeem and retrieve my three hun and seven po, my nine destinies and seven registers, my form, shadow, essence, radiance, spirit, and qi. May these be restored to my body in full, my name erased from the Register of Deaths of the Three Offices and inscribed in the Register of the Living. May my lifespan be extended: one hundred twenty years for the highest longevity, one hundred years for the middle, and eighty years for the lowest. May my life and destiny be prolonged, my declining years bolstered, and my perils delivered. May my hun and po be retrieved, my granaries doubled, and my blessings augmented. May disasters be dissolved, perils averted, and the qi of life flow abundantly.\n\nWhen my prayers are answered, I shall reverently receive the profound grace.\n\nThe Dao’s boundless, immeasurable grace—this petition is humbly submitted.\n\nOn the first day of the [day] month in the year [year], in [village], [precinct], [county], [prefecture], your disciple [name], aged [age], of a household of [number] persons, now residing at [location], prostrates himself this day to beseech your favor. He petitions your servant, presenting this memorial to the Three Heavens, imploring their mandate to bolster his declining years, deliver him from peril, extend his life’s tally, and augment his longevity.\n\nAlas, your disciple’s entire household, benighted and foolish, has been granted the privilege of entering the gates of the Dao and born into this mortal generation, yet remains mired in the realm of ordinary beings. Since the onset of this year’s early spring, he has encountered successive misfortunes—calamity, peril, and danger—with no auspicious dreams to console him. He fears that adversity, disaster, and decline will converge upon him, that his years will be exhausted and his tally spent, that myriad afflictions will descend, and that his three hun and seven po will be imprisoned in the celestial dungeons and earthly hells, his name recorded in the Register of Deaths of the Three Offices—Heaven, Earth, and Water—within the grasp of the Five Punishments and Six Harms. His household is gripped by dread, and peace and stability elude them.\n\nWith a single heart, he places his trust in the great Dao and entrusts his fate to the Perfected Ones, beseeching your servant to submit this memorial, that his life may be prolonged, his perils delivered, his years extended, and his longevity increased. He begs for the bestowal of true qi to nurture and shield his mortal form, that the generals, officers, soldiers, and swift courier-horses of his life and destiny may soar forth to the gates of the Three Offices—Heaven, Earth, and Water—to intercede on behalf of your disciple. May his name be expunged from the Register of Deaths, his three hun and seven po retrieved and restored to his body, that he may pass through the gates of disaster and peril and forever join the ranks of the ancient seed-people.\n\nWhen his prayers are answered, he shall reverently receive the profound grace.\n\nThe profound grace of the great Dao’s nurturing care is reverently acknowledged in this memorial.\n\nEnclosed herein are talismans inscribed in cinnabar.\nRespectfully invoked are:\n— The Year-Ruling Spirit of this year, [Name], with his retinue of [Number] officers;\n— The Month-Ruling Spirit of this month, [Name], with his retinue of [Number] officers;\n— The Day-Ruling Spirit of this day, [Name], with his retinue of [Number] officers;\n— The Hour-Ruling Spirit of this hour, [Name], with his retinue of [Number] officers.\n\nThe above memorial invokes the spirits of the year, month, day, and hour, along with their attendant generals, officers, and soldiers, each to descend in unison. With united hearts and combined strength, bearing the divine talismans, they shall ascend to the Celestial Bureau, the Earth Prison, and the Forty-Eight Dungeons of Mount Tai. There, they shall act on behalf of your disciple [Name] to support his decline, deliver him from peril, extend his life’s allotment, increase his years, and augment his longevity. They shall retrieve his hun and po souls, expunge his name from the Register of Deaths, and inscribe it in the Record of the Living.\n\nFor this purpose, your disciple respectfully offers:\n— One bolt of white silk,\n— One *shi* and two *dou* of rice,\n— One hundred twenty *chi* of silk thread,\n— One knot,\n— One knife,\n— One hundred sheets of paper,\n— Three *sheng* of ink and oil,\n\nto establish faith in the Daoist gate, redeem his hun and po souls, replenish granaries and treasuries.

May all ailments be cured, and the qi of life flow abundantly.

They shall act on behalf of your disciple [Name] to extend his life’s allotment, support his decline, and deliver him from peril. Should he have inadvertently offended the Earth Lord, the Grand Year-Star, the Generals, the Northern Hourly Controller of Destiny, the Eight Spirits of the Twelve Monthly Constellations, the Six *Jia* Ghost Thieves, the Five Pestilences, the Five Epidemics, or the qi of ghostly toxins, may all such offenses be eradicated.

On the day his wishes are fulfilled, may he receive the profound grace of the Dao. Respectfully submitted.\n\nRespectfully listed are the names of the gods and spirits of the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, as well as the offices and bureaus to which they are assigned, as follows:\n\nWe humbly beseech the benevolent Dao to dispatch flying courier-horses to all divine shrines and temples. Should the three *hun* and seven *po* of your disciple [Name] be trapped in tombs, among the hundred malevolent ghosts, or within the prisons of the underworld, may they be sought out in order, extracted, and restored to his body in full. Should any be missing, proceed to the Eastern River Earl’s Water Office to seek them. Should any still be missing, proceed to the Central River Earl’s Water Office. Should any remain missing, proceed to the Three Heavens’ Water Bureau. Should any still be missing, proceed to the Grand Year-Star General’s office.

Should any remain missing, proceed to the Yearly, Monthly, and *liujia* Taboos. Should any remain missing, proceed to the Thirty-Six Prisons. Should any remain missing, proceed to the Three Officials’ bureaus of Heaven, Earth, and Water.\n\nWe beseech the Most High Lord of the Dao and his generals and officers to search all bureaus and offices for the three *hun* and seven *po* of your disciple [Name], and restore them to his body. May his decline be delivered, his lifespan extended, and may he find life amidst death and deliverance amidst peril. On the day his wishes are fulfilled, may he receive the profound grace of the Dao’s nurturing mercy. Respectfully submitted.\n\nThis day, we proceed to the Supreme Mystery Capital in all haste. Yet due to this disciple’s ignorance of the statutes and rituals, his devotion to the Dao has been fraught with transgressions, inviting misfortune. Recently, his household has suffered adversity: the dwelling is plagued by inauspicious emptiness, dreams are chaotic and tangled, ghostly *qi* congeals and lingers, family members suffer from swellings and pains, and divination reveals manifold taboos. This disciple [Name] humbly declares: since the onset of this year, his life and fate have been beset by calamities, a multitude of hardships, and the exhaustion of his allotted lifespan. The stars of doom press upon him in unbroken succession; his misfortune is recorded in the ledgers of the Three Officials’ *Death and Release* accounts, bound within the Five Punishments and Six Harms. Above, he is ensnared by the Heavenly Net; below, he is entangled by the Earthly Web. Fearing that he may not escape these disasters, misfortunes, and perils in an instant, his entire household is gripped by private anguish, nightly dread, and knows not what recourse to take. Thus, with wholehearted devotion, he places his trust in the Great Dao, entrusting his fate to the Most Perfect and True, and beseeches this minister to submit a memorial, that this disciple [Name] may be upheld in his decline, delivered from calamity, his lifespan extended, his years increased, his *hun* and *po* retrieved and restored to his body, all made complete.\n\nMay all malevolent *qi*—whether from internal or external sources, whether stubborn specters, perverse spirits, or lingering demonic infestations—be eradicated in due order, preserving his life and fate. Should he be marked for death, let it be proclaimed that the Calamity Lord alone, along with one hundred and twenty officials and generals, be dispatched to guard and protect this disciple [Name], securing his life, stabilizing his *hun* and *po*, expunging his name from the registers of death, and inscribing it in the rolls of the living. May his granaries overflow with grain, his lifespan be prolonged, his decline upheld, his calamities delivered, and the *qi* of life flow abundantly.\n\nAfter this memorial is presented, may his dwelling become harmonious and pure, his household thrive in health, his misfortunes be dispelled, and celestial disasters forever averted. May his transgressions be absolved, his debts dissolved, and a hundred spirits come to his defense. The celestial officials, generals, officers, and soldiers who accompany this minister’s triennial memorial shall report his merits and promote his rank as a token of efficacy.\n\nWe implore the Most High, Boundless, and Great Dao; the Most Venerable Masters; and the celestial administrators to bestow their compassion and attend to this plea. Respectfully, on behalf of disciple [Name], we bow before the celestial officials, generals, officers, and soldiers, beseeching them to uphold his decline, deliver him from calamity, increase his years, prolong his lifespan, and petition the Three Heavens to retrieve his *hun* and *po*, restoring them to his body in full. May the Celestial Physicians heal his ailments, safeguard his life, and grant him peace free from harm.\n\nYour servant humbly presents this petition for grace, submitting it to the celestial bureaus, and awaits their decree. With utmost reverence and trepidation, I kowtow, prostrate myself, and bow twice to make this known.\n\n*Thus concludes the fifth scroll of the* Taishang Xuanzhu Huazhang.",

This mortal, born of flesh and blood, descendant of the hundred officials, has through a thousand ages of fortune been privileged to serve the Supreme Great Dao and the Lords and Venerable Ones. Entrusted with the imperial mandate, he governs his own life and household. Yet this mortal, [Name], along with his entire household, great and small, has been foolish and obstinate, acting in frequent contravention of the Dao. Thus, misfortune has accrued, and in recent years, adversity has prevailed, leaving his household in decline and distress. Wealth and property have dissipated, malevolent spirits have arisen in competition, and he fears that the three disasters and nine calamities have converged upon his person. Ensnared by the celestial net and enmeshed in the earthly web, his lifespan is foreshortened, his years nearly spent. He petitions the Three Officials to absolve his name from death’s register. Moreover, the earth of his ancestral tombs has been severed, causing the restless dead to stir and bring misfortune. The consequences recur in what he witnesses: litigation ensnares the living. In this turbid and wicked age, a hundred evils rage violently, demonic bandits roam freely, and a hundred maladies bring slaughter. The deaths of ordinary folk lie strewn like refuse, their wails filling the roads, unbearable to hear. This mortal, dwelling amidst such peril, finds no merit by which to extricate himself. He deeply fears that he will suddenly be reduced to dust, unable to preserve his own existence, and without recourse. Thus, with a single heart, he surrenders his fate to the Great Dao, entreating your subject to present this petition and memorial, to dissolve the three disasters and nine calamities that afflict his life, to unbind the snares that entangle him, and to redeem his life from its destined end.\n\nAs enumerated in his plea, your subject, in his foolishness, remains ignorant of the workings of demonic *qi*. He fears that his person may be assailed by the six harms, that mutual afflictions may arise, or that malevolent apparitions may invade and wrong him. He also fears that he may be pursued by the *qi* of ancestral tombs—by the dead of his lineage, both inner and outer, and by demonic bandits—summoned arbitrarily by the Lord of Mount Tai. Though this mortal is indeed sinful and defiled, like the lowly sparrow or mouse, he turns to the Dao to seek mercy.\n\nIt is heard that the Supreme Great Dao, in its compassion, nurtures all beings, leaving none unsaved. To extend life and avert calamity, one need only beseech its boundless grace. Thus, he presents this oral petition in the central courtyard, beneath the Great Yin and before the Northern Dipper, prostrating himself to submit this memorial, that it may ascend to the Celestial Bureau.\n\nHe humbly prays that the Boundless Supreme Lord Lao, the Supreme Venerable Ones, the Three Master Lords, the Compassionate Father, and the Holy Mother may bestow their boundless grace, absolving the myriad mortal sins and transgressions this mortal has committed since birth, along with the nine calamities’ appointed hour. May all be swept away. May this mortal be granted one life, one survival, one passage, one deliverance. If his three destinies are exhausted and his tally’s reckoning spent, may he be specially granted length in the midst of shortness, success in the midst of failure, safety in the midst of peril, and deliverance in the midst of calamity. May the fleeting moments be reversed, and a single term of life be lent.\n\nHe petitions the deities of his life’s natal month to each lead a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, to rescue and resolve the calamities that threaten his life. Thereupon, he presents this written plea to beg for the tally of the *zi* and *wu* hours, extending his years to one hundred twenty. He beseeches that his name be substituted, his form transformed, his evil ledgers erased, and his shortness exchanged for length. May his fate be transmuted and extended, his years prolonged to their utmost, and may he be advanced beneath the guidance of the stellar net, where mutual redemption may be achieved.\n\nIf this mortal’s life is frail and weak, may it be extended; if his granaries are depleted, may their measures be increased; if his trees wither, may they be revived by nourishing rains. If his three lifespans are foreshortened, may they be prolonged; if his years and fate are brief, may his tally and blessings be augmented.\n\nHe respectfully summons the divine soldiers, the lictors, and the messengers to bear the ledgers of his life’s tally and records, presenting them before the Jade Emperor. There, in accordance with the matter at hand, they shall be reviewed by the Gatekeeper of Life’s Mandate. May the charges be assessed, the records examined, and the petitions granted to halt execution and stay the sentence.\n\nIf this mortal’s life is truly limited, its span too brief, the nine calamities converging, his conduct often wayward, his viscera filled with sin, and his sentence justly decreed; if his three destinies are nearly spent, the three absolutions already reported; if his name is absent from the Jade Calendar, his left tally unrecorded, his entry missing from the Three Primordials’ register, his name stricken from the Life Mandate’s ledgers, unclaimed by the Southern Palace, and unforgiven by the Heavenly Emperor—then he begs that these be expunged. Once every three months, once every three years, may the grand assembly recur in endless cycle. Should his plea be heeded, he shall receive the grace of his masters and elders, reborn through their favor.\n\nHe petitions the Lord of Lifespan in the Hall of Literary Glory, along with the Lords of Augmented Tally and Life’s Deliverance, five each, accompanied by twelve hundred officials and generals, to descend as one and preside over the extension of his life, the augmentation of his lifespan, and the eternal preservation of his existence.\n\nHe further petitions the Lords of Stellar Tally Adjustment, Name Transformation, and Death’s Transcendence from the Supreme Primordial Mysterious Black Palace, five each, accompanied by twelve hundred officials and generals, to descend as one. Together with the lictors and messengers within his person, and the reviewing officers beneath the Great Yin, they shall act on behalf of this mortal, ascending to the Palace of the Northern Dipper’s Handmaidens to redeem his name from death’s register and transform his form.\n\nHe petitions the Nine Dragon Talismanic Mandate from the Eastern Florescence Palace to be issued to the Immortal Lords of the Five Marchmounts, commanding the Water Official, the River Earl, Lord Lü, and the twenty-four wardens of Mount Tai’s prisons.",

      "translated_text": "The Three Terraces and the Eight Seats of the Controller of Destiny shall absolve the transgressions within this petitioner’s person, reviewing and releasing all karmic bonds. They shall retrieve his three hun and seven po souls and restore them to his body, ensuring they do not wander astray. He petitions five Lords of the Restrained Hun and Controlled Po, accompanied by twelve hundred officials and generals, and further petitions the Seven Lads of the East, along with twelve thousand clerks of the retrieved hun and po, to proceed directly to the Palace of the Mysterious Yin Handmaidens. There, they shall redeem and reclaim his three hun and seven po, extracting his three destinies, to forever safeguard his life.\n\nHe petitions five Lords of the True Ruler of Southern Prosperity, with twelve hundred officials and generals, to descend as one and accompany his memorial to the Jade Desk of the Celestial Bureau of Destiny beneath the Lord Han of the Great Vast Heavenly Court. There, they shall revoke his death decrees from the Three Offices, redefine his life’s name, and inscribe him in the Jade Register of Divine Immortals on the Left Covenant, granting him boundless years.\n\nHe further petitions five Lords of the Stellar Net, with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to dissolve the lunar womb and placenta of his birth, absolving the transgressions of his natal Five Stars and Twenty-Eight Constellations. They shall dispel the calamities of solitary void and annihilation, the qi of the Five Disasters and Nine Perils, and bestow upon him the pure yang qi of generation, suffusing his body.\n\nFor the thousand afflictions and myriad pains that plague him, may they be eradicated upon the submission of this memorial. Yet he fears that since the establishment of his destiny, he has unwittingly violated the laws of Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, the Five Phases, the twelve double-hours, the Twenty-Four Spirits, the Celestial Net, the River Earl, the Great Unity, the Follower of the Chief Star, the Merit Clerk, the Messenger, the Great Fortune, the Lesser Fortune, the Victorious Advance, the Divine Rear, the Grand Impact, the Punitive Brightness, the Azure Dragon, the White Tiger, the Vermilion Bird, the Dark Warrior, the Coiling Serpent, the Queen of Heaven, the Great Yin, the Celestial Unity, the Noble Spirit, the Daily Patrol, the Monthly Procession, and the thousand prohibitions and myriad taboos—accumulating grave misfortunes that consign him to the company of ghosts. He beseeches the Seven Stars: may Tainlang and Jumen sever the roots of spectral affliction; may Lucun and Lianzhen alter his name and transform his form; may Wenqu and Wuqu expunge his death records; may Tian’gang and Pojun cleave asunder demonic hordes, preventing their harm. May the Three Terraces absolve the sins of his tomb and the thousand transgressions of his past, annihilating the ghosts of the Twelve Punitive Executions. May all his sufferings be cured.\n\nHe prays that the overseeing officials will facilitate and govern, allowing his memorial to ascend to the Three Heavenly Courts. There, they shall distinguish the transgressions of his family from past lives—his Nine Ancestral Kin and Seven Generations, his parents, and himself—accumulated through obstinate rebellion, shameful deeds, inhuman conduct, lust, theft, defiance of Heaven and betrayal of Earth, curses and imprecations, and the qi of karmic entanglement. Alongside the calamities of his current year and destiny, they shall dissolve the Five Punishments, the Six Harms, and the perils of short life, extending his years and augmenting his fate. May the Six Jia and the sixty-day cycles, the Yin and Yang of the sixty spirits, each command their legions, inspecting the Four Seas and Eight Extremities, the Fourteen Provinces and Ninety Prefectures, the One Thousand Two Hundred Counties, the Twelve Thousand Townships, and the Twelve Thousand Li of domains. They shall trace the transgressions of his person, identifying the nature of his sins, the offices and bureaus they offend, the deities and spirits they provoke, the ghosts that accuse him, and the inquisitors that seize him. He implores the summoned lords, generals, officials, and soldiers to ascend to the Three Heavenly Courts and the paths of the Dao, there to reconcile and annihilate these transgressions, ensuring that Heaven holds no records, Earth no registers, and Water no oaths—all shall be absolved.\n\nHe earnestly petitions one thousand two hundred Jade Maidens of the Granary Fire, each clad in garments of pearls and jade in variegated hues, their hair bound in triple knots. They shall extend his years and augment his life, filling his granaries and treasuries, further enhancing his longevity. They shall summon the qi of one hundred twenty spirits, suffusing his body, ascending to the Muddy Pellet and descending to the Crimson Palace, nurturing his root and origin, fortifying his years and destiny. He beseeches healing for his ailments, that his maladies vanish in an instant, and that his journeys be unimpeded.\n\nHe petitions the Great General of the Mysterious Elder, one hundred thousand strong, and the Envoys of the Mysterious Elder, one million in number. He further petitions one thousand two hundred Jade Maidens of the Three Heavens, their hair bound in triple knots, their bodies clad in five-colored garments of mysterious yellow, their feet shod in lion-skin slippers. Descending from the Three Heavens, they shall hold cinnabar in their mouths and bear jade nectar in their hands, exhaling true qi to heal and restore this mortal. From head to foot, they shall harmonize his green muscles and entwined vessels, regulate his six bowels, strengthen his sinews and bones, cure his hundred ailments, and rectify his dreams and waking hours. He shall pass through the Nine Perils, as they absolve the calamities of Heaven above and Earth below, the perils of the Three Heavenly Stars, the womb and lunar months, the afflictions of his birth hour, the exhaustion of his years and fate, the transgressions of marriage, relocation, burial, and the twelve hourly spirits, the calamities of the Grand General, the Grand Yin, the twelve monthly constructions, the exhaustion of his current year’s qi, the defiance of Heaven and betrayal of Earth, and the adversities of his destiny’s decline. Fearing that the confluence of his natal perils may summon the barbarians of the Five Directions—Yi, Man, Rong, and Di—along with internal and external adversaries, the curses from all sides, and the harm that brings illness, distress, and myriad pains to his body, he dreads that his life may not escape the Three Disasters and Nine Perils, that his fate may be as fleeting as a sparrow’s or a mouse’s, and that his fear of death and longing for life compel him to earnestly petition five Lords of the Three Heavens’ Calamity Absolution, with twelve hundred officials and generals, and five Lords of the Myriad Blessings of the Grand August, with twelve hundred officials and generals. They shall inspect his fate’s register beneath the Nine Heavens and above the Nine Earths, discerning the roots of his misfortunes and the depth of his calamities, reconciling and annihilating all.\n\nHe implores that his hundred ailments depart his body, that the Ten Virtues draw near, that a thousand disasters vanish, and that myriad fortunes renew. He earnestly petitions five Lords of Southern Prosperity, with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to seize and record the Three Corpses and Nine Worms within his body, preventing their escape, their surveillance of his transgressions, their incomplete assistance, their attraction of external malevolence, and their covert sabotage of his health—may all be annihilated at once.\n\nHe prays that the overseeing officials will manage each matter accordingly, dispatching the celestial officials and their legions of lords, generals, officials, and soldiers to eradicate all harm, capture malevolent qi, absolve and reconcile, and expel the myriad spirits, specters, and demons—whether they cling in strange forms, as miscellaneous gods and ghosts, or stubbornly linger. He petitions one thousand two hundred valiant soldiers of the Heavenly Center to descend as one to his dwelling, capturing and subduing the ten thousand malevolent spirits that plague him, purifying his inner and outer domains, and fortifying them with divine protection. He beseeches that his body be robust, that true qi descend to nourish and replenish his four limbs, pacify his five viscera, regulate his hundred passages, and deliver him from peril, granting him life amidst death. May his short register be obliterated and his name inscribed in the Jade Record of Longevity. May his thousand sins and myriad transgressions be pardoned in its entirety.\n\nOn the day he receives this grace, he shall reverently proclaim the wondrous Dharma, exhorting this mortal to cultivate virtue, amend his faults, and humbly adhere to the precepts and prohibitions, never again offending the celestial officials. In gratitude for their vigilant protection, he shall submit this comprehensive memorial, recounting their merits and advocating for their promotion, as a token of his sincerity. Thus, he petitions with deepest reverence.",

      "translated_text": "**[Memorial Content]**\n\nMinister [Name], in proper ceremonial rank, respectfully seals this memorial anew.\n\nTo the Gate of the Three Heavens, with request for transmission:\n**Memorial for Extending Lifespan and Dispelling Calamity by the Lady Wei of the Southern Peak**\n\nBy the Orthodox Unity of the Great Mystery, the Balanced Qi of the Supreme Mystery Metropolis, and the lineage of the Celestial Master’s twenty-four dioceses of Yangping and others, your Daoist servant [Name], bows his head and knocks his forehead to the ground, prostrating twice, and respectfully submits:\n\nAccording to the documents at hand, there is now a certain official disciple [Name] of [Rank], from [Village], [Precinct], [County], [Prefecture], who today kowtows and beseeches grace, seeking to avert disaster, resolve calamity, cure illness, sever external [obstructions], and restore the continuity of the memorial for pacifying spirits and stabilizing the hun and po souls.\n\nThis disciple [Name] has been fortunate across a thousand lives to serve the Dao of the Most High and the Lords and Elders of the Great Way. Through the incense fire of the Mystery Metropolis, he has protected himself and dwelt in purity and transformation. Truly, he is filled with boundless gratitude and joy for this grace. Yet, owing to his innate foolishness from birth, he is unversed in the statutes and canons, and in his practice of the Dao has often transgressed, thereby incurring trials and punishments. Of late, his fortunes have been adverse: his dwelling is unsettled, demonic toxins besiege it, spirits and humans are depleted, wealth is squandered, fields and silkworms yield no harvest, livestock perish, and his household suffers illness. Calamities follow one upon another, and in his dreams, he is constantly mingled with the long-deceased. Divination reveals that these are the putrid, foul ghosts of his great-grandparents, uncles, brothers, aunts, maternal uncles, sisters, and other kin, who, having died in illness or on inauspicious days, now return as malevolent spirits, afflicting the living with sickness.\n\nThis disciple [Name], along with his entire household, young and old, has encountered ominous and grotesque visions in divination and dreams, seeing what is not real. Moreover, in this present time, demonic brigands run rampant, unjustly harming the good and upright. Many have fallen ill and perished, and this disciple’s household, caught amidst this, fears it cannot escape. Terrified and desperate, with no recourse, he turns with all his heart to the Great Dao, seeking life and sustenance. He petitions your servant to submit this memorial on his behalf for exorcism and deliverance.\n\nThis humble servant, dull and ignorant of the statutes and methods, has followed the precedent of the Celestial Master’s \"Memorial of the Twelve Hundred Mouths.\" Upon investigating the origins of the malevolent spirits, the disciple [Name] stated in his own words, as revealed by divination, that these are the ghosts of his deceased ancestors—great-grandparents, uncles, brothers, sisters, aunts, maternal uncles, and other kin—who died of illness in past years or on inauspicious days and now return as malevolent spirits, inflicting sickness upon the living. This disciple [Name] and his entire household, young and old, suffer such afflictions and hardships that some have not had their names fixed in the registers of life, or their names have entered the records of death. Now, he seeks to retroactively resolve this, to tally his lifespan anew, extend his years and avert calamity, cure his illnesses, and beseech the removal of his name from the ledgers of death and its inscription in the registers of life.\n\n[Here follows the disciple’s birth year, name, and natal month.]\n\nThis disciple [Name] and his entire household, young and old, have exhausted their allotted stars and lifespans. He beseeches that their declining years and calamities be extended. Whether their tally is reckoned in the year of the Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, or Pig, he begs for their resolution, that their names be inscribed in the registers of life, their souls and spirits be restored, calamities be dispelled, illnesses be cured, and his entire household, young and old, be granted peace and safety, free from further harm.\n\nMoreover, he fears that this disciple [Name] and his household may have their tally reckoned in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, or twelfth month. He beseeches that these be resolved in order, that all afflictions, calamities, and illnesses be immediately dispelled, his household be at peace, and disasters be averted.\n\nIf this disciple and his household have their tally reckoned on the day of the Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, or Pig, he begs that the soldiers of the True Qi be dispatched to resolve these in sequence, inscribe their names in the registers of life, protect his household, cure their illnesses, dispel their calamities, eradicate demonic qi, and ensure the safety of his entire household, young and old, free from further harm.\n\nFurthermore, he fears that this disciple [Name] and his household may have their tally reckoned on the Establishing, Removing, Filling, Leveling, Fixing, Holding, Breaking, Perilous, Completing, Gathering, Opening, or Closing days. He beseeches that the generals, officials, and soldiers of the True Qi resolve these in order, expunge their names from the registers of death, inscribe them in the registers of life, dispel calamities, sever obstructions, cure illnesses, and ensure the peace of his household.\n\nHe also fears that this disciple [Name] and his household may have their tally reckoned in the first month, with the death taboo in the Tiger; the second month, with the death taboo in the Rabbit; the third month, with the death taboo in the Dragon; the fourth month, with the death taboo in the Snake; the fifth month, with the death taboo in the Horse; the sixth month, with the death taboo in the Goat; the seventh month, with the death taboo in the Monkey; the eighth month, with the death taboo in the Rooster; the ninth month, with the death taboo in the Dog; the tenth month, with the death taboo in the Pig; the eleventh month, with the death taboo in the Rat; or the twelfth month, with the death taboo in the Ox. For these deeply grave taboos and calamities, he beseeches the generals, officials, and soldiers of the True Qi of the Great Dao to compassionately resolve the registers of death and inscribe their names in the registers of life.\n\nMoreover, he fears that this disciple [Name] and his household may be afflicted by the monthly calamities of the Grand Year-Star, with their three hun and seven po souls confined in the northern prison of Mount Tai. Or that the Great Yin Envoys, the Lords of Wind and Rain, may claim to be the Grand Year-Star, the Great Yin, the Great Yang, the Great Generals, the Northern Director of Destinies, the Twelve Monthly Establishments, or assume other official titles, roaming the heavens and earth, followed by demonic soldiers, music, and banners, blowing horns and beating drums, bearing flags and staffs. They may claim to be the spirits of the local altars, the Stove Lord and Lady of the household, the Earth Lord and House Dragon, or the ghosts of soldiers, hunters, or those who died by misadventure, such as Li Ao. These spirits consort with thousands of ghosts and myriad deities, the hundred and twenty kinds of earthly and celestial punishments and calamities, and may come to harm this disciple’s household, causing illness, the departure of essence and qi, the disattachment of hun and po souls, and the persistence of calamities. Whatever they encounter turns to adversity, and official misfortunes arise wantonly. In such dire straits, he is filled with urgent dread, fearing he cannot escape. He pleads for mercy, his plight deserving of compassion.\n\nThis servant, overwhelmed by what he has witnessed, humbly risks transgression and prostrates himself to the ground, beseeching the submission of this **Memorial for Urgent Relief, Exorcism, Tallying Lifespans, and Curing Illnesses**, one document in all, to ascend [to the Jade Throne].",

May the true qi descend and flow, sheltering this disciple, his household—both high and low, free and bound—so that all may dwell in peace without harm, forever preserving primordial auspiciousness.\n\nFor this disciple and his entire household, may all profound calamities, heavy obstacles, and grievous illnesses be swiftly dispelled, leaving no trace. May wandering and malevolent spirits be eradicated, the household abide in tranquility, and evil gods and wicked ghosts flee to distant realms, ceasing all scheming. May all movements and passages be guarded by benevolent spirits, water and fire be extinguished, metal and stone be sundered. With boundless gratitude, I humbly invoke and beseech:\n\nFrom the East, the Lord of Life-Calculation of the Nine Yi, with one hundred and twenty officers and generals;\nFrom the South, the Lord of Life-Calculation of the Eight Man, with one hundred and twenty officers and generals;\nFrom the West, the Lord of Life-Calculation of the Six Rong, with one hundred and twenty officers and generals;\nFrom the North, the Lord of Life-Calculation of the Five Di, with one hundred and twenty officers and generals;\nFrom the Center, the Lord of Life-Calculation of the Three Qin and Earthly Stem Wu-Ji, with three hundred and ninety thousand officers and generals.\n\nMay all the celestial officers, generals, officials, and soldiers now invoked descend as one to extract the hun and po souls of this disciple, lest they remain trapped within the stellar palaces—whether in Horn, Neck, Root, Room, Heart, Tail, Winnowing Basket, Dipper, Ox, Woman, Emptiness, Danger, House, Wall, Straddler, Bond, Stomach, Pleiades, Net, Turtle Beak, Well, Ghost, Willow, Star, Spread, Wings, Chariot, or any of the Twenty-Eight Constellations and Thirty-Five Stellar Offices. May they descend as one to liberate this disciple and his household—both high and low—from the celestial nets above and the earthly snares below, dispelling calamities, transcending misfortunes, and severing all ties with malevolent spirits. May the afflicted recover, their sustenance flow freely, their complexion restore, their countenance return, the Four Great Elements harmonize, and their bodies be restored to their original state. May every member of the household—both high and low, free and bound—receive protection, dwell in safety without harm, and encounter only primordial auspiciousness. With profound gratitude for this boundless grace, I humbly invoke:\n\nThe Great General of the First Month, Yin, for Unbinding and Liberation, with one hundred thousand soldiers;\nThe Great General of the Second Month, Mao, for Unbinding and Liberation, with one hundred thousand soldiers;\nThe Great General of the Third Month, Chen, for Striking and Liberation, with one hundred thousand soldiers;\nThe Great General of the Fourth Month, Si, for Unbinding and Liberation, with one hundred thousand soldiers;\nThe Great General of the Fifth Month, Wu, for Striking and Liberation, with one hundred thousand soldiers;\nThe Great General of the Sixth Month, Wei, for Unbinding and Liberation, with one hundred thousand soldiers;\nThe Great General of the Seventh Month, Shen, for Striking and Liberation, with one hundred thousand soldiers;\nThe Great General of the Eighth Month, You, for Unbinding and Liberation, with one hundred thousand soldiers;\nThe Great General of the Ninth Month, Xu, for Unbinding and Liberation, with one hundred thousand soldiers;\nThe Great General of the Tenth Month, Hai, for Striking and Liberation, with one hundred thousand soldiers;\nThe Great General of the Eleventh Month, Zi, for Unbinding and Liberation, with one hundred thousand soldiers;\nThe Great General of the Twelfth Month, Chou, for Unbinding and Liberation, with one hundred thousand soldiers.\n\nMay all the generals, officers, and soldiers of the Twelve Months for Unbinding and Liberation now invoked descend as one to dissolve the profound calamities and grave illnesses of this disciple and his household.

May they descend as one to liberate this disciple and his household—both high and low—from the nets and snares, transcending calamities and misfortunes. May the three hun and seven po souls be extracted and restored to the body, fully replenished. May calamities be transcended, illnesses dispelled, leaving no trace. May the spirits of the long-departed, the recently deceased, and the externally ascended be banished to distant realms, their malevolent schemes utterly eradicated. May dreams be true and pure, the household tranquil, and every member of the family—both high and low—bathed in clarity and auspiciousness, dwelling in safety without harm.\n\nI prostrate myself and beseech the true officers, generals, officials, and soldiers of the Great Dao to act on behalf of this disciple and his household before the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water; the Five Peaks and Four Waterways; the Three Rivers and Four Seas; and the hundred ghostly prisons. Seek out this disciple and his household—both high and low—for any misfortunes of exhausted lifespan, the encroachment of baleful stars, the entanglements of the Primordial Hour, the clashes of the Five Phases, or any calamities from the first to the ninth, up to the one hundred and twenty celestial punishments. Dispel and liberate their hun and po souls, restoring them to the body, that they may swiftly recover. If they cannot be found, summon and inquire of the ancestral dead in the Three Mounds and Five Tombs. Seek the three hun and seven po souls of this disciple, or the three hun and fourteen po souls of this female disciple, and restore them to the body. If they still cannot be found, summon and inquire within the Twenty-Four Prisons of Mount Tai to retrieve these hun and po souls and restore them to the body.\n\nMay all profound calamities and grave misfortunes, the thousand illnesses and myriad pains, be swiftly dispelled, leaving no trace. May life be preserved whole, restored to its original state. May the four limbs and five organs, the three palaces and six viscera, the seven orifices and protective qi, the three hundred and sixty bones, the one thousand two hundred forms and shadows, the twelve thousand essences of light, and the five-colored lapis lazuli—red and white within the body—be replenished if depleted, their measures increased. May short lifespans be lengthened, their allotments augmented. Where inconvenience persists, transform it: turn short into long, blue into yellow. May lifespan be prolonged, calamities forever transcended, and all illnesses severed. May the spirits of the long-departed, the recently deceased, and the externally ascended turn toward benevolence, joining in protection, ceasing all entanglement. May the household dwell in peace, the residence remain pure, all movements and passages flow unimpeded, and every desire be fulfilled.

      "translated_text": "**Petition of Repentance by Daoist Du Guangting**\n\n**Petition for Atonement and Redress**\nThis servant [Name], of [such-and-such] dharma rank, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to submit this petition.\n\nThis servant, by the grace of a thousand rebirths, has been deemed worthy to hold office, to uphold and proclaim the pure dharma, and to heal the sick. Yet, being dull and unworthy, I remain ignorant of the ways of spirits and gods. I have failed to devote myself to assisting the Dao of my masters, and my remedies have been ineffectual. For this, I have incurred offenses, brought upon myself disasters and afflictions, and suffered recurring illnesses. My endeavors have come to naught, and my path has been fraught with misfortune. As a mortal, I am beset by hardship, and in my private heart, I am filled with dread. I now submit this petition, seeking deliverance and absolution.\n\nAs a servant entrusted with the transformation of the people, I have long overseen households. Yet, in my duties, I may have erred in practice, causing the three qi to fall into disorder. My merits may have been falsified or delayed, and rewards may not have been duly conferred. The blessings stored in heaven’s treasury may not have been delivered in time, or my petitions may have been unjust, giving rise to grievances. Such transgressions as these—and others besides—have accumulated, inviting calamities and afflictions, even illness and malevolent influences. I am willing to be examined and seized by the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water. Let the officials and clerks record my merits and recommend my promotion to the Central Palace, where I may receive due rewards and be assigned to a bureau, so that resentment may be dispelled.\n\nMay the clerks of the celestial bureaus review my merits and transgressions, extend their grace, and grant me clemency. May all my myriad faults and offenses be pardoned. I implore the Most High to take pity on my foolishness and unworthiness. Through the envoys of the Two Offices, the left and right officials of the Orthodox Unity Merit Clerk, the yin-yang spirit-decision clerks, the chariot-red-tally clerks, the fierce-wind courier post riders, and the memorial-submitting officials—two of each—I humbly submit this petition for [Name], seeking to confess transgressions, atone for faults, and beseech blessings to avert disaster. One petition is hereby presented to [such-and-such] bureau, awaiting response.\n\nThis servant, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to make this known.\n\n---\n\n**Petition for Expiation of Transgressions by a Daoist**\nThis servant [Name], of [such-and-such] dharma rank, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to submit this petition.\n\nUpon reviewing the documents, I find that, though I have been entrusted with the dharma office, my conduct has often violated the Dao. Despite my unworthy position, my proclamations have been ineffectual, the people and creatures have scattered, and my remedies have been delayed. Some transgressions were committed knowingly, while others arose from my limited understanding. I may have feigned authenticity in my practices, vacillated in upholding the dharma, or mismanaged the households under my care, causing distress to the people. I may have embezzled or misused sacred objects, shown outward reverence while harboring disdain in my heart, or slighted the teachings of my masters. I may have made false claims in the name of the teachings, engaged in deceitful schemes, or extorted money from others by exaggerating matters. I may have caused discord among kin, or fostered strife between parents and children. I may have been envious of fellow Daoists, or indulged in impurity and debauchery. I may have cursed or reviled others, disturbing the purity of the Dao, or given in to anger, disrupting the harmony of the three, five, seven, or nine qi. I may have failed to observe the proper measures, neglected the Six Ren, and instead employed the Six Bing, forsaking the Six Gui while invoking the Six Ding, thereby erring in my practice of qi and offending the celestial taboos. I may have grown arrogant due to favor, neglecting those in dire need, or allowed desire to cloud my judgment, exploiting my position to make demands. I may have indulged in wine, meat, lust, or theft. I may have failed to promote deserving officials in a timely manner, or delighted in conflict, spreading rumors about others. I may have exposed others’ secrets, mocked the aged, or alarmed the ignorant. I may have revealed the esoteric teachings, or maligned the true essence of the Dao. I may have harbored grudges, or sought to harm others through malevolent qi. I may have sought to exalt myself while disparaging others.\n\nSuch transgressions—twenty-nine in all—have been fully committed, and I stand condemned by the dark bureaus. Were my faults weighed, they would suffice to reduce me to ashes. Yet the Great Dao is vast and merciful, and the Most High values life. I implore your compassion, beseeching life and pardon for my thousand sins and myriad offenses, that the weight of heaven and earth’s grace may be made manifest. Henceforth, I shall strictly adhere to the dharma, never again repeating past errors.\n\nI implore the Most High to take pity on my foolishness and unworthiness. Through the envoys of the Two Offices, the left and right officials of the Orthodox Unity Merit Clerk, the yin-yang spirit-decision clerks, the chariot-red-tally clerks, the fierce-wind courier post riders, and the memorial-submitting officials—two of each—I humbly submit this petition for [Name], seeking to repent of transgressions, atone for faults, and beseech the granting of grace. One precious petition is hereby presented to [such-and-such] bureau, awaiting response.\n\nThis servant, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to make this known.\n\n---\n\n**Petition for Reprieve from Examination**\nThis servant [Name], of [such-and-such] dharma rank, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to submit this petition.\n\nUpon reviewing the documents submitted by [Name], as stated above: born of flesh, I received little learning in my youth and failed to grasp the great principles. Previously, I rejoiced in transformation and was placed under the governance of the Great Dao. By special grace, I was deemed worthy to hold office, overseeing the transformation of the people and managing households for many years. Though I rejoiced in my position, my mortal ignorance prevented me from fulfilling my duties, and I feared my inadequacy would bring shame upon me.\n\nI have reflected upon myself: my abilities are slight, yet my responsibilities are heavy. My senses are dull, and my tenure in office has been brief. Unfamiliar with the regulations, I have often erred in my duties. Thus, on the [Day] day of the [Month] month of the [Year] year, I fell gravely ill, yet have not recovered. I have examined my faults and cannot absolve myself. Fearing my transgressions, I have accumulated much that is shameful. The clerks of the celestial bureaus have been informed and have dispatched officials to examine me. Soldiers have been sent to my home to subject my body to interrogation, inflicting torment day and night without respite. My breath hangs by a thread, and my family trembles in terror, fearing for our lives.\n\nSince taking office, I have failed to revere heaven and earth above, or honor my parents below. I have disobeyed the teachings of my masters, committed many evils and few good deeds, acted with more defiance than compliance, and given in to anger more than joy. I have offended the heavens, earth, sun, moon, and stars, and violated the prohibitions of the five phases, the waxing and waning of the four seasons. I have dug into level ground, filled wells, and blocked waterways. I have obstructed the flow of water, severed roads, felled trees, and killed living beings. I have taken eggs from nests, secretly harmed others, and stolen their possessions. I have wrongfully killed, leaving grievances to fill the roads. I have shown disrespect to heaven and earth, declaring there are no gods. I have taken others’ property and failed to repay my debts. I have concealed others’ virtues and exposed their faults. I have spoken falsely, engaged in duplicity, cursed, reviled, and acted without principle. I have exploited the poor for personal gain, indulged in lust, and violated women. I have been envious, resentful, and jealous of those more accomplished than myself. My actions have been improper, and my conduct has lacked reason. Thus, I have brought upon myself severe examination, the binding of my hun and po souls, and the infliction of the five poisons. I deserve ten thousand deaths, and my crimes are known far and wide. I now confess all my transgressions without concealment, hoping for a moment’s respite to reform myself. I shall purge my innards, dissect my sinews and bones, and never again compare myself to my past self.\n\nAs a mortal, I submit my life in earnest. This servant, bearing [Name]’s petition, ventures through boiling waters and scorching fires to present this memorial. I beseech the clerks to extend their grace and review my case. The mortal humbly accepts and complies. May the officials who have examined me be rewarded, and may I be restored.\n\nThis servant, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to make this known.",

      "translated_text": "To the Celestial Bureaus,\n\nUpon receiving rewards, may they enter the Central Palace and report to the respective offices to stabilize their positions, following the usual regulations, so as not to incur resentment. Though my sins are already determined and I deserve annihilation, like the sparrow and mouse clinging to life, I aspire to reform. I humbly beg for pardon and the gift of life, absolving my transgressions and faults, permitting future goodness. May the suffering I endure be alleviated, my essence restored, my complexion revived, and my qi and pulses regulated and harmonized as proof of my sincerity. I implore the Most High to discern this.\n\nFor a moment, this foolish and inferior servant, through the direct envoys of the Two Offices, the Functionaries of the Orthodox Unity, the Left and Right Official Messengers, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Deciding Clerks, the Chariot and Scarlet Talisman Clerks, the Gale-Riding Courier Station Masters, and the Memorial-Presenting Officials—each dispatching two attendants—earnestly petitions on behalf of [Name] to confess and absolve sins, safeguard this ailing body.\n\nOne memorial is respectfully submitted to the Celestial Bureaus, awaiting notification.\n\nThis servant, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to make this known.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial of a Daoist Priest for the Annulment of Register Violations**\n\nThis humble servant, [Name], of such-and-such ordination rank, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to submit this memorial:\n\nI, of lowly and foolish nature, have long been occupied with worldly duties, delighting in transformation and governance, submitting my life to the Lords and Masters of the Dao. Having received great favor, I was entrusted with administrative duties, bestowed with the immortal registers, and charged with overseeing households and guiding the people. I was to propagate the true teachings and assist the nation in sustaining its mandate. Yet, born and raised in this impure world, I lacked learning from youth, failed to grasp profound principles, and in upholding the Dao, lost the mean in practice. My conduct was disloyal, unfilial, unkind, and unbenevolent. I disrespected and disobeyed my parents and siblings, coveted wealth and lust, indulged in wine and meat, and in all my actions, violated the prohibitions of the registers. Recently, my dreams and waking hours have been disturbed, my visions abnormal, my household plagued with misfortune, and my words met with strife. I have transgressed the statutes and breached the covenants, bringing upon myself this adversity.\n\nFearing sudden calamity and unable to endure further, I venture through boiling waters and scorching fires to present this memorial. I humbly request that the Lord Bi Yu dispatch one official and one hundred twenty attendants to absolve my violations of the register’s prohibitions—my consumption of wine and meat, and all my transgressions—reconciling them all. For my thousand sins and ten thousand faults, I beg for pardon. I shall purify my heart and renew my resolve, reforming the past and cultivating the future. Should I complete this year without further incident, let it serve as proof of my sincerity. I implore the Most High to discern this.\n\nThrough the direct envoys of the Two Offices, the Functionaries of the Orthodox Unity, the Left and Right Official Messengers, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Deciding Clerks, the Chariot and Scarlet Talisman Clerks, the Gale-Riding Courier Station Masters, and the Memorial-Presenting Officials—each dispatching two attendants—I earnestly petition on behalf of [Name] to confess and absolve faults, safeguarding this ephemeral body.\n\nOne memorial is respectfully submitted to the Celestial Bureaus, awaiting notification.\n\nThis servant, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to make this known.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial of a Daoist Priest for Safe Travel**\n\nThis humble servant, [Name], of such-and-such ordination rank, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to submit this memorial:\n\nI, a descendant of the myriad officials, have been fortunate across a thousand generations to be entrusted with administrative duties and bestowed with the celestial officials and soldiers for my protection—a favor far beyond what my stubborn and base nature deserves. Having received this transformation for but a short time, I remain ignorant and unenlightened, trembling day and night as if standing at the edge of an abyss. Now, as I journey to [such-and-such place], traversing perilous and distant paths, where the world is corrupt, people deceitful, and ghostly qi yet uncleansed, I fear bandits and robbers may attack and plunder. Thus, I submit this memorial to make my plea known.\n\nI humbly request the Celestial Officials and August Lords—one Heavenly Official Soldier Lord, one hundred twenty attendants; the Nine Qi Lords with their fifteen myriad hosts; the Left Horse Lord with one hundred twenty attendants; each to descend in unison to accompany me, repelling and expelling all wickedness and rebellion. May the thousand evils and ten thousand ills, the slanders of officials, and all disasters be averted. Under the protection of the soldiers, may all evils be dispelled, bandits warded off, and roads made passable.\n\nI further request the Lords of the Eastern Nine Yi, Southern Eight Man, Western Six Rong, Northern Five Di, and Central Three Qin—each leading one hundred thousand soldiers, clad in iron, wielding blades, and commanding the armies of water, fire, reversed armor, and inverted scales—along with one million two hundred thousand troops. May the Thirty-Five Lords of the Nine Heavens’ Talismans, the Great Banners and Drums of the Red Yang Ten Punitive Generals with their ten myriad soldiers, and the True Officials of the Four Directions, the Qi-Infusing Yellow Emperor Lords, and the Camp Star Lords with their one hundred twenty attendants descend simultaneously to guard my person, repelling all malevolent and rebellious forces, and dispelling the unruly qi of specters and demons along the way. May all be subdued, my journey safe, and my return secure.\n\nUpon my return, I shall duly report the merits of the officials, generals, and soldiers who accompanied me, ensuring equitable recognition. For all the commanderies, counties, waterways, and land routes I traverse, the lodges and inns I stay in, and the encampments and registries of ghosts, I beseech the supervising and examining Lords—the Two Mysteries, Three Origins, Four Beginnings, and Jiazi Officials of the roads; the Warden Lords of the post stations and guesthouses; the Camp and Registry Lords of wandering spirits; the Lords of the Four Wilds and Nine Regions; the Elders of the Mountains and Forests; the Twelve Stream Maidens; the Water Emperors of the Nine Rivers; and the River Earls and Lords of Lü—all to safeguard the roads, ensuring smooth passage on land and safe crossing on water.\n\nMay all who labor be rewarded in due time, without omission or error. Should I receive this favor and fulfill my wish, let it serve as proof of my sincerity. I implore the Most High to discern this.\n\nThrough the direct envoys of the Two Offices, the Functionaries of the Orthodox Unity, the Left and Right Official Messengers, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Deciding Clerks, the Chariot and Scarlet Talisman Clerks, the Gale-Riding Couriers, and the Memorial-Presenting Officials—each dispatching two attendants—I earnestly petition on behalf of [Name] for safe passage on land and water.\n\nOne memorial is respectfully submitted to the Celestial Bureaus, awaiting notification.\n\nThis servant, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to make this known.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial for the Restoration of Broken Daoist Covenants on the Road**",

      "translated_text": "The Dharma-Ranked Servant of [Surname], with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates, bows twice, and respectfully submits:\n\nThis foolish descendant of mine, though born of humble lineage, has long cultivated the virtuous Dao. In former times, when the Han dynasty’s fortune shifted, the rites and teachings flowed freely. Though I remained in the secular world, I did not forsake the pure Dharma. Yet, dwelling near lowly officials, my affairs became entangled with the perverse. My own dullness and ignorance left my merits unworthy of record, and so I was assailed by malevolent spirits. Of late, my household has suffered manifold afflictions—illnesses, the death of servants, and the depletion of wealth. Searching my conduct for fault, I cannot discern the cause. Though I sought mercy through the Dao, I have not received its sheltering grace. Thus, I now submit this memorial, humbly beseeching Your compassionate review.\n\nMy family has served the Dao for generations and ought to be held in esteem by all. Yet, though we dwell beneath the vast covering of Heaven and Earth, we have encountered misfortune and adversity. I suspect my actions have strayed from the harmonious Dao, inverting the natural order and mingling with the common herd. Though the Three Origins and Four Beginnings grow ever more exalted, the myriad spirits of the lower realms have become the arbiters of my fate. Even in this single delusion, I cannot free myself. I implore Your mercy to absolve all my transgressions, that from this day forth, my path may be prosperous, my illnesses dispelled, and my household secure in peace and abundance.\n\nI implore the Most High to discern this humble servant’s plight. Through the direct envoys of the Two Offices, the Functionaries of the Orthodox Unity, the Left and Right Official Messengers, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Deciding Clerks, the Chariot and Scarlet Talisman Clerks, the Gale-Riding Couriers, and the Memorial-Presenting Officials—each dispatching two attendants—I earnestly petition on behalf of [Name] to dispel calamity, safeguard my family, and restore well-being.\n\nOne memorial is respectfully submitted to the Celestial Bureaus, awaiting notification.\n\nThis servant, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to make this known.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial to Sever Slander on All Sides**\n\nThe Dharma-Ranked Servant of [Surname], with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates, bows twice, and respectfully submits:\n\nI humbly observe that this unworthy descendant, born and raised in rustic ignorance, was never versed in the rites of the Dao. By mere happenstance, I was appointed to this office, where I must now account before the Celestial, Terrestrial, and Aquatic Bureaus. As a mortal of dull wit, my tenure has been brief, and my transgressions many. Overwhelmed with dread, I know not where to turn.\n\nI prostrate and bow twice again. Since the day and month I received the Essential Words of the True Unity, my dim understanding has failed to fully grasp the methods of nurturing the spirit and receiving qi. Yet, I have dutifully served the secular world, where many turn their backs on the Dao, slandering their masters and reviling the Way. Their tongues wag ceaselessly, each claiming righteousness, while I, guilty of untold offenses, deserve to be shattered and ground to dust. I dare not hope for life, yet by the grace of the Venerable Lords, I prostrate myself and submit this memorial.\n\nI humbly beseech the Invincible Azure Mysterious Lord to dispatch a host of one million soldiers to suppress slanderous tongues, the ghosts of curses and oaths. I further entreat the Southern Guardian and the Six Stellar Lords, along with their one hundred twenty generals, and the Thirty Billion Celestial Maidens of the Zhou Tian, to descend at once and apprehend all who persist in malice, rebellion, scheming, and slander. Let them visit every household, bringing reconciliation and sealing away the venom of perverse and wicked tongues. May all such enmity dissolve at once, as proof of this covenant.\n\nLet the generals, officers, and soldiers, along with the stellar guardians of every quarter, infuse their qi to oversee and examine the merits of these divine envoys. Should they fail in their duty, may they be held accountable. I beg that the thousand sins and ten thousand transgressions I have committed, past and present, be wholly absolved. I shall exert my utmost effort, sparing no devotion, to ensure peace and security, as proof of my sincerity.\n\nI implore the Compassionate Father and Mother to take pity on this foolish servant. Through the direct envoys of the Two Offices, the Functionaries of the Orthodox Unity, the Left and Right Official Messengers, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Deciding Clerks, the Chariot and Scarlet Talisman Clerks, the Gale-Riding Couriers, and the Memorial-Presenting Officials—each dispatching two attendants—I earnestly petition to silence all slanderous lips and safeguard my person.\n\nOne memorial is respectfully submitted to the Celestial Bureaus, awaiting notification.\n\nThis servant, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to make this known.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial to Stabilize Qi and Resolve Illness**\n\nThe Dharma-Ranked Servant of [Surname], with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates, bows twice, and respectfully submits:\n\nThis lowly descendant, born of a lineage that has long served the lower officials, inherited from my ancestors the practice of offering libations to the myriad spirits. Yet, we have not received their blessings; instead, we have suffered misfortune and calamity. Thus, we entrusted our fate to the Great Dao to preserve our lives. Since pledging ourselves to its service, we have been graced with profound favor—our household has known peace and stability, a cause for both joy and trepidation.\n\nYet, as a mortal, my conduct has often strayed. Since the year and month of [Date], I have known no respite. My limbs grow heavy, my rest is fitful, and my waking hours are troubled. In dreams, I wander through quiet chambers or ruined halls, as though receiving guests, or lie abed as if scaling mountains, crossing peaks, riding chariots, or sailing ships. At times, I am consumed by resentment or joy, my emotions unchecked. At others, I speak in the voices of spirits, proclaiming their authority, or rail against my household, recounting the affairs of the common folk. Sometimes, I am seized by sorrow, my actions without reason. This affliction lingers, waxing and waning, leaving my flesh wasted and my bones emaciated. My heart trembles at the thought of sudden demise, fearing I may be ensnared by malevolent spirits, led astray, and bound in delusion.\n\nTurning inward, I examine my conduct. Though I bear the sacred registers and wear the emblems of purity, my sincerity is faint, and my devotion divided. I have failed to repel evil and dispel harm. Thus, I humbly submit this memorial, beseeching the Twelve Great Generals of the Mysterious Elder and their one hundred twenty generals to descend upon my person, seizing the rebellious ghosts of the Three Bureaus and the spirits of the myriad elders who claim divine authority and emerge from the Dao. May they be dispersed at once.\n\nIf my bones and destiny align with Heaven’s decree, and I am granted recovery, I shall receive the central qi. I implore Your discernment to distinguish truth from falsehood, that the malevolent spirits and perverse influences may be dispelled, and my qi restored to purity, as proof of this covenant.\n\nI implore...",

Through the mediation of the Two Bureaus’ Direct Envoys, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Left and Right Envoys, the Yin-Yang Spirit Judgment Clerks, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Clerks, the Gale-Wind Courier Post Horses, and the Memorial-Offering Clerks—each dispatched in pairs—I, your servant, humbly beseech on behalf of [Name] a memorial for the blessing of limb-strength and well-being, that every movement may proceed in pure peace. This petition is respectfully submitted to the Celestial Bureau, awaiting Your decree.\n\nI prostrate myself in reverence and awe, kowtowing to make this known.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial of the Handwritten Register to the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water**\n\nYour subordinate, [Name], holding the dharma-rank, prostrates in reverence and awe, kowtowing twice, and respectfully declares:\n\nI, [Name], a man/woman of [Prefecture, County, Village], aged [Number] years, now set forth in handwritten form the sins of my past, itemized as follows. Each matter is recorded separately, without embellishment or concealment, omitting nothing, whether grave or slight. Should any transgression remain unconfessed, or should the examining officials find ambiguity, let each offense be listed thus:\n\nIn the year [Year], at [Month, Day, Hour], I, [Name], a man/woman of [Prefecture, County, Village], aged [Number] years, with [Number] household members, having violated the precepts of the Dao, fell ill on [Month, Day] and have suffered affliction to this day, with no sign of recovery. Fearing for my life, I now submit this handwritten register and memorial, respectfully presented to the Most High, the Primordial and Boundless Lord of the Three Heavens, the Supreme Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Lord of the Capital Bureau, the Examiners of Conduct, the Six Essences and Six Shells, the Twenty-Four Bureau Lords, the Celestial Masters, their Heirs, and Lineage Masters, as well as the generals and clerks under their command in the prefectures and counties. May the Four Lords of the Four Directions, who oversee the infusion of qi and the scrutiny of deeds, examine this servant’s illness. I have handwritten this confession, listing each transgression—its gravity, nature, and number—as recorded in the attached register. I beg for life, for the alleviation of my illness, and vow henceforth to uphold this handwritten pledge, practicing filial devotion in accordance with the Master’s teachings. I shall cultivate kindness, loyalty, and filial piety, honor the aged, cherish the young, care for orphans, support widows, and succor the poor and weak. In all matters, I shall submit to the Master’s household, treating their affairs as my own, sharing their joys and sorrows. I shall not sow discord, engage in slander, speak falsely, or devise private doctrines. I shall not conceal faults while praising virtues, nor downplay grave sins while confessing minor ones. Should I fail to fully disclose the truth, or should I violate this pledge, I shall offer my body and speech in repentance to the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, accepting all consequences without complaint.\n\nI now invoke the Lords of the Eastern Nine Yi, the Southern Eight Man, the Western Six Rong, the Northern Five Di, and the Central Three Qin—each with twelve attendants and a host of one million soldiers, the Reverse-Hair and Cross-Scale Warriors—as well as the Azure Emperor of the East, the Vermilion Emperor of the South, the White Emperor of the West, the Black Emperor of the North, the Yellow Emperor of the Center, the Azure Dragon, the White Tiger, the Vermilion Bird, the Dark Warrior, and Gouchen, to collectively examine my case. As a mortal seeking life, I beg for survival, vowing to uphold the Master’s Way and transmit it for ten thousand generations. May all under Heaven—those already in the Dao and those yet to enter—hear of this handwritten confession and take it as proof of my commitment to the Way. Though the matter is long-standing and I cannot recall every detail, I shall reflect deeply and submit further confessions as they come to mind, every three days. Should You, Merciful Father and Holy Mother, take pity on the common people and grant Your scrutiny, I shall reform henceforth, purging my past errors. Even if my stomach is scoured, my sinews stretched, and my bones broken, I shall never again compare myself to my former self. I beg for life.\n\nI now solemnly handwrite this pledge as proof.\n\n---\n\nI, your servant, a mortal of flesh and bone, descendant of withered remains, untrained in learning and ignorant of discernment, have been unworthily appointed to the office of Libationer. My duty is to assist the Celestial Master in propagating the qi of the Dao, aiding the nation, sustaining life, and healing illness. Yet, burdened by the Six Defilements, I am dull-witted and have failed to propagate the Dao’s qi, exhort virtue, or transform evil. Day and night, I tremble in fear, unable to find peace.\n\nYour servant, [Name], a fellow Libationer of the same qi, having violated the Dao and brought disorder upon himself, now suffers from prolonged illness, worsening by the day. My breath hangs by a thread, and in self-reproach, I find no relief. Exhausted and without refuge, I now come before the court to confess in writing all my past sins—good and evil, grave and slight—from the age of seven to the present, itemized as in the attached register. I beg the Great Dao to grant me life anew.\n\nAs a mortal, I turn to You in sincerity, hoping for Your compassion. I now submit this plea, braving fire and boiling water, prostrating to present this memorial. Should my words reach You, I shall accept my fate among the myriad beings. Overwhelmed with shame and fear, my sweat flows like melting ice.\n\nI beseech the examining officials to review my register and submit it to the One Hundred Twenty Bureaus of the Heavenly, Earthly, and Water Officials. May they pardon my past transgressions, restore my fate and destiny, and grant clemency for what has passed while holding me accountable for the future. As a mortal, I have pledged to fully confess the truth. Should the examining clerks’ scrutiny yield immediate and verifiable results, let them be duly rewarded for their labor.\n\nI now respectfully submit this memorial to all the Examiners, Generals, and Clerks of the Heavenly, Earthly, and Water Bureaus, as well as the soldiers under their command, to report their merits and recommend promotions in rank, in accordance with the statutes of the Celestial Bureau. Let each return to their respective bureau, where their accomplishments shall be recorded. The Central Palace shall review and approve their ranks, ensuring no grievances remain.\n\nShould any resentment linger, let my hun and po be detained in the Celestial Bureau for prolonged interrogation. I humbly beg for pardon, that my three hun and seven po may return to my body, my suffering be alleviated, and this be taken as proof of Your efficacy.\n\nMay the Merciful Father and Holy Mother, in Your great compassion, examine and discern my plea. Take pity upon this foolish and inferior servant. Through the mediation of the Two Bureaus’ Direct Envoys, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Left and Right Envoys, the Yin-Yang Spirit Judgment Clerks, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Clerks, the Gale-Wind Courier Post Horses, and the Memorial-Offering Clerks—each dispatched in pairs—I, your servant, humbly beseech on behalf of [Name] a memorial for deliverance from distress and the protection of his/her body.

With utmost reverence and awe, I bow my head to the ground, prostrate myself, and kowtow twice to make this known.\n\nI vow to follow the Dao and beseech for a petition of life. The ordained servant of the dharma-rank, [Name], with utmost reverence and awe, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and kowtows twice to address this: I, your servant, once by fortune, was graced with pure transformation and received profound kindness, bestowed with the rank of immortal official and celestial soldiers for my protection. For years, in all matters great and small, I have maintained a sincere heart, truly rejoicing in this. Yet, my nature is stubborn and dull, ignorant of the prohibitions of Heaven and Earth.

In great fear and dread, I fear I may not survive. I surrender my life to the Great Dao, confess my sins, and beg for life. I have privately knelt in my home and vowed to reform my wrongs, turn from rebellion to obedience, and pledge to follow the Dao without retreat. I only beg for pardon, to extend my days, and allow me to breathe. I shall diligently reflect on the transgressions I have committed and enumerate them one by one. Yet, my mortal understanding is shallow, and I have not received mercy. My suffering lingers, worsening day by day. My entire household, young and old, faces annihilation. I crawl to seek remedy, imploring your servant to beg for mercy and beseech for my life. I vow to cultivate myself anew. Once recovered, I shall assist in the Dao of the Master, uphold the laws and statutes, cast off the old and embrace the new, and follow only goodness without fail.\n\nI, in my foolishness and ignorance, have failed to propagate transformation and do not know the severity of my sins, nor the nature of the punishment that has left me debilitated for so long without relief. As a mortal, I am desperate to repent, yet like a sparrow or mouse, I cling to life—truly pitiable. With trepidation, I dare to offend the pure and upright, braving boiling water and fire, to present this petition on behalf of [Name]. I humbly submit it to the Three Heavens’ Bureau of Life and Destiny. May the esteemed officials examine the celestial records, calculate merits to offset transgressions, and reconcile the punitive qi. I respectfully request one Lord of the Nine Heavens and one hundred twenty officials and generals to absolve my sins and lift the summons. May this reach the various bureaus of the Central Palace, ensuring stable office and the return of my hun and po to my body.\n\nIn all my past conduct, there is no goodness to record. My deeds are tallied in the Right Palace, with only sins inscribed. My transgressions abound, and my merits are nonexistent—nothing to offset them. I beg for special pardon of all my sins and the gift of my life. I shall prove myself in the future, held accountable for my future goodness. If I do not betray my words, may my punishment be transformed into merit. If I violate this and remain unabsolved, I, in my mortal peril, dare to bring this to your attention. Overwhelmed with fear, I rely on the Most High to discern and take pity on this foolish and inferior servant. Through the mediation of the Two Bureaus’ Direct Envoys, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Left and Right Envoys, the Yin-Yang Spirit Judgment Clerks, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Clerks, the Gale-Wind Courier Post Horses, and the Memorial-Offering Clerks—each dispatched in pairs—I, your servant, humbly beseech on behalf of [Name] for the absolution of sins and the fortification of my Dao-heart. This petition is respectfully submitted to the Celestial Bureau, and I humbly await your report. With utmost reverence and awe, I bow my head to the ground, prostrate myself, and kowtow twice to make this known.\n\n**Petition for Prolonging Life in Dire Illness**\nThe ordained servant of the dharma-rank, [Name], with utmost reverence and awe, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and kowtows twice to address this: I am a crude and vulgar descendant, a mortal born of flesh, who delights in transformation and governance to sustain my life. Yet, my many transgressions have prolonged my calamities. Recently, I fell ill, afflicted by a hundred poisons. The condition has worsened over time, with no relief. Now, I am gravely debilitated, barely clinging to life. I have repeatedly implored the various officials, confessed my sins, and made solemn vows, yet I have not received mercy. As a mortal, I am filled with dread, my heart and courage lost. I am resigned to becoming dust, forever consigned to the Yellow Springs. I, who am tasked with serving and propagating the compassionate transformation, should assist the August Elders in rescuing the perilous, healing the sick, and aiding those in distress—this is my constant duty and my compassionate concern. Yet, my mortal life hangs by a thread. With trepidation, I dare to submit this petition, beseeching five Lords of Longevity from the Southern Prosperity Bureau, along with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to descend together to the Palace of the Dark Yin’s Imperial Concubine. May they extract my fading life, absolve all my sins from first to ninth, and fulfill the Dao’s reckoning. I further request the Lord of Lifespan, the Lord of Life Protection, and the Lord of Life Extraction—three officials, each accompanied by one hundred twenty attendants—to descend and plead for my life, once every three months for three years. I vow that if I am granted life, it shall serve as proof of your efficacy. I rely on the Most High to discern and take pity on this foolish and inferior servant. Through the mediation of the Two Bureaus’ Direct Envoys, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Left and Right Envoys, the Yin-Yang Spirit Judgment Clerks, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Clerks, the Gale-Wind Courier Post Horses, and the Memorial-Offering Clerks—each dispatched in pairs—I, your servant, humbly beseech on behalf of [Name] for the elimination of illness and the augmentation of years. This petition is respectfully submitted to the Celestial Bureau, and I humbly await your report. With utmost reverence and awe, I bow my head to the ground, prostrate myself, and kowtow twice to make this known.\n\n**Petition for Life**\nThe ordained servant of the dharma-rank, [Name], with utmost reverence and awe, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and kowtows twice to address this: My illness is grave, and I am in critical danger. Reflecting on my transgressions, I cannot discern their nature. I have repeatedly sought remedies, confessed, and begged for mercy. Yet, my illness remains severe, with no alleviation. As a mortal, I am filled with dread, fearing I shall become dust. I implore your servant to bring this to your attention. In my foolishness and ignorance, burdened by human frailty, I rely on this plea. With trepidation, I dare to offend the pure and stern, submitting this petition to make this known. My suffering has only worsened over time, with no relief. There must be deeply concealed and grave sins, or perhaps my life’s fate is at its end, and I am bound for the Yellow Springs. Truly, this is not something my stubborn and shallow self can presume to address. I can only look up and rely...",

I humbly beseech your compassionate review: since the dawn of my awareness, my sins have been myriad and profound. I earnestly petition the Southern Supreme Lord, accompanied by one hundred and twenty officials and generals, to open the Gate of Life and augment my years; and the Lord of Southern Prosperity, with one hundred and twenty officials and generals, to traverse the eight directions, measure the stars, and cross the celestial cycles, that my name may be stricken from the register of death and my lifespan extended. May this body, fated for the Yellow Springs, be granted rebirth.\n\nShould malevolent spirits—unappeased and unpropitiated—exploit my weakness to cling to my form and inflict grievous harm, I beseech the dispatch of one hundred and twenty stalwart, valiant, and resolute officers and soldiers to seize, sever, and discern truth from falsehood, dispersing all such entities. Let the living and the dead be clearly distinguished, each restored to their rightful place. May this petition reach the light of day, and may my plea be answered.\n\nShould I recover, I vow to proclaim your merit and seek advancement in service. I implore the Most High to discern and pity my foolishness and inadequacy. Through the intercession of the two official envoys, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendants, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Deciding Clerks, the Chariot-Inspecting Red Talisman Clerks, the Gale-Riding Post Station Couriers, and the Memorial-Submitting Officers—each pair dispatched—I, your servant, humbly petition for the preservation of life and the alleviation of suffering. This memorial, one copy, is respectfully submitted to the Celestial Bureau. I await your decree with reverence.\n\nA Petition for Pardon and Life\nYour subordinate of such-and-such rank and name, with utmost trepidation, prostrates and kowtows, bowing twice to submit this plea.\n\nI humbly state: Having once submitted to the Dao and aligned with its qi, I received boundless grace, which I strove to emulate. Yet my sins have accumulated, inviting severe retribution. My illness, as previously described, has driven me to reflect on my transgressions and confess my faults, daring to submit this plea despite my guilt.\n\nOn such-and-such a day, I invoked the Merit Officers for healing, the Celestial Physicians, the Earthly Physicians, and the assisting medical clerks to attend to my bodily afflictions. Yet my sincerity has failed to move them, and my suffering has only worsened. My life hangs by a thread, and I am utterly undone, devoid of even the courage of liver and gall. Overwhelmed by what I witness, I dare to submit this second petition, beseeching the Merit Officers and the couriers of the four directions—Hu, Yue, Di, and Qiang—to proceed directly to the Palace of Peaceful Prosperity. There, I implore the Lord of Life Protection, the Lord of Longevity, and the Southern Supreme Lord—each accompanied by one hundred and twenty officials and generals—to expunge my name from the register of death and inscribe it anew in the book of life. May I, once every three months, be granted deliverance.\n\nI have braved death and defied reproach, deserving ten thousandfold punishment. Yet I beg for pardon, offering my recovery as proof of your mercy. I implore the Most High to discern and pity my foolishness and inadequacy. Through the intercession of the two official envoys, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendants, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Deciding Clerks, the Chariot-Inspecting Red Talisman Clerks, the Gale-Riding Post Station Couriers, and the Memorial-Submitting Officers—each pair dispatched—I, your servant, humbly petition for the preservation of health and the augmentation of my years. This memorial, one copy, is respectfully submitted to the Celestial Bureau. I await your decree with reverence.\n\nA Midday Petition for Life in Dire Distress\nYour subordinate of such-and-such rank and name, with utmost trepidation, prostrates and kowtows, bowing twice to submit this plea.\n\nI humbly state: I, a lowly descendant of an official lineage, have been fortunate to witness the flourishing of the Great Dao, delighting in its purity and rectitude. Embracing faith and entering its law, I bound my fate to the Three Heavens, a source of profound honor and comfort. Yet my foolishness and impurity have caused me to fail in harmonizing with the qi, and my body is afflicted with suffering. My pain is such that my life flickers like a candle in the wind. Though I have sought mercy from the Dao, my illness remains unalleviated, growing worse by the day. Fearful of becoming dust, I am filled with dread and unable to compose myself. I turn to you, my lord, to plead for salvation.\n\nUpon reviewing my condition, I find it perilous indeed. Perhaps my sins are too deeply entwined for pardon, or my allotted years have reached their final moments. Yet I recall that the true qi of the Great Dao nurtures all beings, capable of restoring vitality to withered bones and reviving the bloom of spring upon winter-stricken trees. To raise the dead from their coffins requires only your grace. Relying on your boundless compassion, I beg for the extension of my life.\n\nI earnestly beseech the five Lords of Longevity in the Palace of Southern Prosperity, each accompanied by one hundred and twenty officials and generals, to journey north to the Palace of the Dark Yin and the Jade Maidens. There, I implore them to redeem my form, that my nearly severed life may be granted the mercy of rebirth. May your virtue ascend to honor the lofty spirits of the august elders and descend to fulfill the yearning for life even in the lowliest of creatures. I implore the Three Masters to review and discern my plea.\n\nIn my foolishness and inadequacy, I rely on the intercession of the two official envoys, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendants, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Deciding Clerks, the Chariot-Inspecting Red Talisman Clerks, the Gale-Riding Post Station Couriers, and the Memorial-Submitting Officers—each pair dispatched.

I have set forth my grievances and implored your servant to intercede, beseeching relief. In accordance with the teachings of my masters, I have inquired into the transgressions for which I am punished. I have confessed my faults in writing and begged for my life.

The Water Officials, Wet-Nurses, and miscellaneous spirits shall execute them forthwith, manifesting the majesty of the Great Dao. *Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*\n\nBy decree of the [Year], the [Month], the [Day], and the [Hour], I, the Libationer and your servant, respectfully dispatch this memorial to the Prefect of Qiushi Commandery in Baobi Prefecture, the Magistrate of Kongli County, and the officials of Fengting Township and Shiye Village. The Stone-Dwelling Dog-Child Ghost within the jurisdiction of the aforementioned officials has transgressed without restraint. This petty ghost has trespassed into foreign territory, afflicting my household and my person with illness—wailing day and night, festering sores, dysentery, malaria, and unceasing emaciation. Upon examination, the symptoms confirm the harm wrought by the Dog-Child Ghost, the Water Officials, and the Wet-Nurses. Each resides within its respective commandery, yet the prefects responsible have failed in their diligence, allowing these spirits to roam freely and injure the people of heaven. Henceforth, they must exercise meticulous oversight and permit no further violations. Should these spirits dare to return and harm my person again, they shall be seized and executed without mercy. The prefects in charge shall be subject to separate disciplinary action, *all in accordance with the statutes and ordinances of the Most High Lord Lao.*\n\n*From the Supreme Mystery Capital, [further invocations follow].*\n\nRespectfully submitted, this memorial is filed for [State], [County], [Township], [Village].",

      "translated_text": "The disciple of the Great Dao, [Name], having long been entrusted to the Most High Lords of the Great Dao and the Venerable Masters, has relied upon the incense and offerings of the Three Masters for self-preservation and governance. Yet my cultivation and service have often faltered, and my movements and stillness have brought no benefit. Since the [day] of the [month], my son/daughter [Name] has fallen ill: limbs heavy, sores swollen, wailing day and night in pain, unable to nurse, unresponsive to medicine. Tracing the cause of this affliction, I fear it is the Dog-Child beneath the stones, the Water Officials, the Wet-Nurses who wash before the grove, the New Brides, and other ghosts lurking in our chambers, seizing our children, harming and killing them. I humbly submit this memorial, beseeching their eradication to save my child’s life, that they may thrive, grow to maturity, and continue our lineage. The depth of my distress moves me to pity. Unable to bear this suffering, I risk transgression and submit this memorial to the Heavenly Courts.\n\nI implore the Most High Lord Lao, the Venerable Masters, the Celestial Masters, the Female Masters, and the Lords of the Five Qi under the Three Masters to extend your divine protection over me. Today, I invoke:\n- The Azure Tiger of Mount Tai to devour the dog’s head and liver,\n- The Vermilion Tiger of Mount Heng to devour the dog’s heart,\n- The White Tiger of Mount Hua to devour the dog’s lungs,\n- The Black Tiger of Mount Zhen to devour the dog’s kidneys,\n- The Yellow Tiger of Mount Song to devour the dog’s spleen.\n\nMay the Tiger Armies of the Five Directions descend as one to consume the Dog-Child beneath the stones, the minor ghosts, the Water Officials, the Wet-Nurses, and the Five Pestilential Qi. May they hunt down and slay all those bound by curses, newly dead or long departed, malevolent spirits and specters—those who falsely style themselves:\n- Governors of Wall Commandery,\n- Prefects of Stone Mound Prefecture,\n- Magistrates of Kongli County,\n- Lords of Fengting Township and Shiye Village,\n- Cliff Kings, Generals of Forced Slaughter, Generals of Benevolent Connection to Heaven,\n- The Azure Dog General of the East, the Vermilion Dog General of the South, the White Dog General of the West, the Black Dog General of the North, the Yellow Dog General of the Center,\n- The Heavenly Gatekeeping Dog-Children, the Earthly Door-Guarding Dog-Children,\n- The wolves with yellow heads, black mouths, azure ears, white paws, and white feet—some fifteen feet tall, others twelve—\n- The Heavenly Prison Wet-Nurses, the Courtyard-Washing New Brides, who roam above and below, harming the young.\n\nNone shall escape the true qi of the Most High. I now dispatch talismans to the Governor of Wall Commandery and the Prefect of Stone Mound Prefecture, commanding them to exercise meticulous oversight and prevent further violations. I beseech the twelve divisions of celestial officials, generals, and soldiers to enter my body, encircle me front and back, and vigilantly guard against these spirits. Capture the Dog-Children, minor ghosts, the Five Pestilential Qi, the cold-malaria demons, the spirits of violent death, the newly dead and long departed, the archers and hunters, the ghosts of those shot or trapped. Cast nets and snares, eradicate them in sequence, and banish all my afflictions. May the might of the True and Orthodox Dao be manifest. May my child’s life be preserved, their suffering ended, their nursing restored, and their parents blessed. May we forever serve as incense-offering devotees of the Great Dao, our descendants unbroken, our home purified, and our household at peace. This I pledge as proof of my devotion.\n\nI humbly beseech the Boundless Great Dao, the Most High Masters, and the celestial officials to review this memorial and swiftly transmit it upward. Bestow upon me the qi of the Dao, that it may shield my body. I have investigated these malevolent spirits: they share no bond with my family, nor do they have descendants of their own. Though we have offered timely sacrifices, they have no right to afflict us. According to the statutes of the Orthodox Unity and the *Green Ghosts of the Civil Code*, they are subject to execution to pacify the people. I now petition:\n- The Lord of Calamity’s Punishment, with 120 officials and generals, to govern the Granary of Brightness,\n- The Star Lord of the Capital, with 120 officials and generals, to govern the Palace of Pure Canopy,\n- The Luminous Harm-Averting Qi Officers,\n- The Heavenly August Valiant Soldiers, 300,000 strong, to descend as one.\n\nMay they purge the malevolent spirits of violent death, the heterodox ghosts of unvenerated lineages, and all who falsely claim kinship. Seize, execute, annihilate, and sever them, leaving no trace. I further petition:\n- Fifty soldiers each for the spirits of male and female misfortune, those who died of illness, drowning, imprisonment, burning, or by blade, beast, or wolf, to eradicate all foreign spirits and unvenerated gods who dare to afflict the innocent.\n\nThese spirits have no connection to our sacrifices, no shared altars, no kinship. They must be severed utterly. Should they dare to return, may rivers flow backward, white stones float, a thousand dogs tangle in silk, horses grow six-foot horns, fifty three-legged crows and three hundred nine-tailed foxes appear—only then may they seek me. Otherwise, let them be sundered from me by heaven and earth for ten thousand years, never to harass me again.\n\nI also petition the Judgment Gods of the Five Directions—East, South, West, North, and Center—each with twelve officials and generals, to sever all recurring afflictions: year after year, month after month, day after day, hour after hour. May my illness vanish, my suffering cease, my life be secure, my soul purified, and all malevolent spirits subdued. May the true qi flow freely, and all pain and torment be dispelled. May I receive this grace.\n\nTo sever all unvenerated spirits and prevent further memorials, I, the humble official [Name], prostrate myself in awe and reverence, kowtowing twice to submit this memorial. I have reviewed the documents for [State], [County], [Township], [Village]. Your disciple [Name], fortunate to have long served the Great Dao under its protection, has known joy in its shelter. Yet my cultivation has faltered, inviting censure. Recently, I have suffered the depredations of malevolent ghosts, my life imperiled. I have received their pleas for memorials to distinguish their cases. Unable to bear this, I risk transgression and submit this memorial to the Heavenly Courts.\n\nI pray the Most High Lord Lao, the Venerable Masters, the Celestial and Female Masters, and the Lords of the Five Qi under the Three Masters will review this humble servant’s memorial and transmit it swiftly. Bestow upon me the qi of the Dao to shield my body. I have investigated these malevolent spirits: they share no bond with my family, nor do they have descendants.

A writ of extermination, the *Great Chapter*, shall be presented to the [Name] Bureau, awaiting its proclamation.\n\nWith reverence and awe, I kowtow twice to submit this memorial.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial for Dissolving Oaths and Curses of the Living and Dead**\n\n[Rank and Name], in utmost reverence and awe, kowtows and bows twice to address this petition. As recorded in the documents: In [State], [County], [Township], [Village], the disciple [Name], aged [X] years, born on the [X] day of the [X] month, today presents this prayer. By fortunate fate, I was born into the Daoist gate and have revered the Great Dao, my name inscribed in the Mystic Register. Yet, despite years of devotion, my practice has been flawed, and misfortune has repeatedly befallen me. In the [X] year and [X] month, I suddenly fell ill, and the affliction has yet to abate. Day and night, I am consumed by dread, my life hanging by a thread. Upon examination, I fear I may have violated sacred oaths, suffered from hidden curses, or been harmed by malevolent forces. The suffering lingers, and my distress is boundless. I beseech this memorial to dissolve these bonds.\n\nYour servant, unworthy as I am, dares to submit this petition to the Celestial Bureau, imploring the Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Elder, the Celestial Master, the Female Master, and the Three Masters, along with the Lords of the Five Qi, to deign to review this humble memorial and transmit it in due course. May the true qi of the Great Dao envelop me. I petition the celestial officials and soldiers to dissolve all curses and oaths from my ancestors—nine generations and seven lineages, thirty-six forebears—that may now afflict me. Whether they invoked spirits, called upon heaven and earth, pointed to the sun, moon, and stars, or swore by local shrines, talismanic temples, or any form—animate or inanimate, sentient or insentient—trees, stones, grasses, mountains, rivers, fire, or creatures; whether they slaughtered animals, drank blood, or ate flesh; whether they carved stones or broke metal as testimony—all such oaths, made by my forebears, now bring calamity upon their descendants. My illness persists, and my life is imperiled. Should I perish and descend to the Nine Springs, even the lowly sparrow and rat would cling to life. I beg for mercy and deliverance.\n\nI humbly petition the Great Bing Lord of the Red Xun Palace, with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to dissolve the curses and oaths of the living and dead from past and present. I further petition the Breaker of Malevolence Lord, with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to seize and sever the spirits of curses and oaths. I petition the Great Protector General, with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to safeguard the afflicted. May my illness be cured, my calamities dispelled, my years extended, and my countenance restored. May all curses cease.\n\nFor oaths sworn on the days of Zi, Chou, Yin, or Mao, may the divine lords of Zi, Chou, Yin, and Mao dissolve them. For oaths sworn on the days of Chen, Si, Wu, or Wei, may the divine lords of Chen, Si, Wu, and Wei dissolve them. For oaths sworn on the days of Shen, You, Xu, or Hai, may the divine lords of Shen, You, Xu, and Hai dissolve them. For oaths sworn by living creatures, may they be dissolved according to their kind. For oaths sworn by broken metal, stone, earth, or wood, may they dissolve of their own accord. May ten thousand oaths be eradicated, and a thousand calamities cease. On the day my wish is fulfilled, I shall receive profound grace.\n\nBy the merciful consideration of the Most High, this is thus invoked. Your servant humbly petitions, on behalf of [Name], for the celestial officials and soldiers to dissolve all oaths and curses from past and present, and to protect and heal the afflicted.

I beseech the Great Dao of the Most High to accept this memorial, to support the weak, dispel calamities, extend my life, secure my fate, bring peace to my home, pacify the dragon spirits, protect my family, safeguard my wealth and fortune, resolve disasters, and preserve my life. My plea is earnest, and the reason is just.\n\nYour servant, unworthy as I am, dares to submit this petition to the Celestial Bureau, imploring the Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Elder, the Celestial Master, the Female Master, and the Three Masters, along with the celestial officials and lords, to deign to review this humble memorial and transmit it in due course. May the true qi of the Great Dao envelop my household, ensuring the safety of all its members, dispelling calamities, dissolving misfortune, and ending all suffering.\n\nI humbly petition the Life-Extending Lord of the Eastern Palace, with one hundred twenty officials, generals, and soldiers, to dispel the Three Disasters and Nine Calamities.

      "translated_text": "May the myriad-year Dao and the seed-people of the world enjoy prosperity in all their comings and goings, with auspicious divinations and dreams, harmony in public and private affairs, and ever-extending years of fortune. For all meritorious and diligent heavenly officials, lords, generals, officers, and soldiers, may their merits be reported and promotions granted in accordance with the Three Assemblies’ comprehensive statutes, that their vows and pledges may not be betrayed. With profound grace, may the Most High review and govern these matters.\n\nYour servant, with reverence and trepidation, bows his head and prostrates himself, kneeling twice to make this known: On behalf of the official so-and-so, whose household has suffered misfortune, I distinguish and enumerate the calamities and adversities, and humbly present a petition—a *Great Petition for Dissolving Disasters and Crossing Adversity*—to the heavenly officials, officers, and soldiers, to be submitted to the Bureau of [such-and-such]. Awaiting your decree, I am filled with awe and fear, bowing my head and prostrating myself twice to make this entreaty.\n\n---\n\n*Scroll Three of the Most High’s Proclamations of Earnest Assistance in Transformation concludes.*\n*Scroll Four of the Most High’s Proclamations of Compassionate Assistance in Transformation begins.*\n\n**Petition of the Six Harmonies’ Life-Calculation, Upper Grade of the Primordial Sovereign**\nComposed by Master Guangcheng, Du Guangting\n\nFrom the humble position of [such-and-such], with reverence and trepidation, bowing my head and prostrating myself twice, I humbly submit this petition: Your disciple [so-and-so], having recited the full litany of grievances, states that of late, his household has been afflicted with misfortune—his dwelling plagued by inauspicious vacuity, his dreams tangled and disordered, and all affairs devoid of good fortune. Today, I knock my head to the ground and lay forth these supplications, beseeching that your disciple’s life-calculation be extended, his years increased, his lifespan lengthened, and all obstructions and harms dissolved. May the year, month, and day of his birth be examined and stabilized, disasters dissolved, and adversities crossed, that his body and life may be safeguarded.\n\nYet your disciple, though but a humble straw-dog of lowly substance, has presumptuously been granted the honor of a most noble existence. Though his years be as fleeting as the morning mushroom, he has fortuitously encountered the true and orthodox Dao. His ancestors revered and honored the Mysterious Gate; his descendants, in unbroken succession, have pledged their lives to the Most High Great Dao, submitting to the jurisdiction of the Lords and Elders. He has been blessed with their compassionate protection, a debt as weighty as the high heavens, and has relied upon their nurturing cultivation, a grace as profound as the vast earth.\n\nYet your disciple was born amid the Five Turbidities, his fate entwined with the Three Calamities. His perceptions are stained by the Six Passions, his karma entangled with the Nine Adversities. His heart and spirit are confused and troubled, his wisdom dim and clouded. In his devotion to the Dao, he has often strayed from its true teachings, causing the numinous spirits to withhold their protection and ghostly *qi* to encroach upon him. For years now, he has known only hardship and setbacks. All he has witnessed and encountered has been inauspicious, with no recourse for redress. When afflictions arise, disasters multiply, and lawsuits befall him, his dwelling is never at peace, and his household suffers from emaciation and illness.\n\nSince the beginning of this year, as spring and summer have arrived, flocks of birds have cried out in disarray, their voices inharmonious and unceasing. His dreams have been devoid of goodness, and decline, hardship, and disaster have arisen. His aspirations have all strayed from their original intent. Perhaps it is your disciple and his wife who are afflicted, or perhaps his fate and lifespan are in conflict. The birth month and the *zi* and *wu* hours clash; the birth day clashes with his body. There is discord with the birth year, and his calculations are unstable. The birth month, too, is irregular, and the stars and celestial reckonings of his destined hour are unsteady. Once this is determined, it will bind him for all his life, and the cycles of his fate will be fixed forever.\n\nIf it is not a convergence of calamities and taboos, then it is his dwelling that has suffered disaster. Perhaps he has encountered a year of the Seven Harms, or a year of the Five Ghosts. Perhaps it is a month of the Four Killers, or a time of the Six Harms. Perhaps he faces the anxieties of the Eight Difficulties, or the taboos of the Seven Injuries. Perhaps he is beset by the misfortunes of the Nine Pitfalls, or the disasters of the Ten Severances. Or perhaps your disciple has moved his residence at an inauspicious time, failing to choose an auspicious day, so that his comings and goings miss the proper hours. His endeavors have offended malevolent spirits; his mornings and evenings are disordered. He has transgressed against the heavenly Dao, and there is no means to avert the resulting misfortune.\n\nPerhaps his wife and children are afflicted, or his parents are harmed by punishment. His fate is in conflict, his year clashes with Jupiter. Perhaps he has entered the Gate of Heaven, or encountered the dire region of the Nine Adversities of Absolute Yang. Perhaps he has approached the Gate of Earth, or the inauspicious place where Absolute Yin enters the tomb. Above, he is entangled in the Heavenly Net; below, he is ensnared in the Earthly Web. His *hun*-soul is imprisoned, his *po*-soul is struck; he is confined in the Three Bureaus. Yin and yang are blocked and separated, and this is no mere taboo of annihilation. In this year of exhaustion and severance, the very present moment is fraught with peril. The declines of the past have not yet been resolved, and new adversities have arisen. Calamities converge, and misfortune repeatedly befalls him. He is constantly beset by harm, and his household is in turmoil. Your disciple, at this very moment, is deeply unsettled, and his family, great and small, is filled with dread.\n\nIf not for the support of the Mysterious Ultimate and the advancement of life-saving aid, there would be no means to escape these profound disasters. If he does not petition the hidden bureaus and the perfected ones above to dispel these misfortunes, how can he avert these calamities? His entire household is filled with terror, and they turn their hearts toward the gate of benevolent protection. Bowing their heads to the Most Perfected, they pledge themselves beneath the incense and flame. With this petition, they beseech grace and entrust their lives to your servant.\n\nThe depth of their earnestness is truly pitiable; their sincerity is profound and weighty, and cannot be denied. Though your humble servant is foolish and ignorant, slow to comprehend the Mysterious Regulations, and though his shallow understanding cannot fathom their profound meaning, he has earnestly recounted these brief observations and sought to address the essential matters.\n\nMoreover, he fears that your disciple’s *hun*-soul and *po*-soul have been seized and bewildered by the hundred ghosts, and that his name has been falsely recorded in the Black Register of the Right Palace, making it difficult to dissolve. Therefore, he humbly petitions the various departments of heavenly officials, lords, generals, officers, and soldiers, as enumerated below:\n\nPetitioning the **Lord of Red Heaven Who Generates Life-Calculation and Dissolves Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord Who Preserves Life and Dissolves Opposition**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord Who Protects and Crosses Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord Who Guards Life-Calculation and Crosses Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord Who Augments Life-Calculation and Crosses Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord Who Extends Life-Calculation and Crosses Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord Who Continues Life-Calculation and Crosses Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord Who Upholds Life-Calculation and Crosses Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord of Upper Clarity Who Doubles Life-Calculation and Crosses Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord Who Stabilizes Life-Calculation and Crosses Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord Who Generates Life-Calculation and Crosses Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord Who Preserves Life-Calculation and Crosses Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord Who Summons Life-Calculation and Crosses Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals;\nPetitioning the **Lord Who Extracts Life-Calculation and Crosses Adversity**, one figure, with 120 officials and generals.",

      "translated_text": "Here follows the petition, beseeching that the preceding departments—all the bureaus, prisons, and gates of the hundred ghosts—be entreated to seek and retrieve the three hun and seven po of your disciple [Name]. Should they have been wrongfully seized and bound by the hundred ghosts in any of the aforementioned bureaus or gates, may the Most High and Great Dao deign to peruse this memorial, that it be swiftly conveyed on high. May the luminous essence, form, shadow, and spirit-qi of your disciple [Name] be pursued, released, and restored to his body, fully reconstituted, that his life’s allotment be extended, his misfortunes dissolved, and his vital qi spread and flow. May the hundred spirits come to his aid and defense. On the day his prayers are answered, he shall bear in reverence the boundless grace of the Great Dao.\n\nThis day, the petition is duly presented at the Gate of the Three Honored Ones, submitted to the Gate of the Celestial Officials, passed through the Gate of the Three Masters, and laid before the jade table of the Most High Lord Lao.\n\nAt the Great Mystery Capital of the Orthodox Unity and Balanced Qi, it is said: Through this disciple’s unfamiliarity with the rites and precepts, he has invited misfortune. Of late, his dwelling has known no peace; his household has suffered illness and adversity. For years, he has sought aid in vain, his dreams filled with ominous emptiness, his home thick with ghostly qi, his spirits unsettled. Disasters and decline have followed one upon another. Today, he comes before me, beseeching memorials and petitions to harmonize the destinies of husband and wife, to determine the stellar influences, to dispel calamities, and to safeguard his life.\n\nFrom the day I received the Daoist precepts, I pledged before the Three Officials to uphold and assist my masters and elders, making salvation my foremost duty. In all matters of supplication, I may not refuse or reject. Thus, I respectfully act on behalf of your disciple [Name] to augment his lifespan, to retrieve and absolve his name from the registers of the dead, to redeem his hun and po, to dissolve his misfortunes and taboos, and to protect his life, as herein petitioned.\n\nThe Daoist methods of the Most High Lords and Perfected Ones are recorded in the Mysterious Capital, revered under the Three Heavens. The true qi of the Dao and the law are sustained by incense and memorials. Within the gates of the Dao, we earnestly exhort and transform. Dwelling in this abode, beset by all manner of setbacks and misfortune, I have learned of the rites of the Numinous Treasure masters for repentance through purification, and of the Orthodox Unity Alliance’s威 for establishing merit to atone for transgressions. Thus, with utmost sincerity, I turn my heart toward the Mysterious Gate, offering my earnest devotion and presenting this memorial to dispel disaster and resolve hardship.\n\nYet I fear that your disciple [Name] treads the snares of the earthly net, his head caught in the heavenly toils, his stars exhausted, and baleful influences descending upon him. Deeply apprehensive that he may at any moment fall prey to calamity, he entreats the Most High Lord Lao to bestow the primordial qi, flowing downward to nurture and shield his life.\n\nI respectfully invoke the sixty-two divisions of celestial officials, generals, clerks, and soldiers listed above to proceed in order to redeem your disciple’s hun and po. Let them journey to the celestial prisons and earthly hells of the hundred ghosts, seek out your disciple [Name]’s hun and po, and restore them to his body, harmonizing his limbs and settling his spirit. Let his name be removed from the registers of the dead and his lifespan secured, inscribed in the jade calendar of the left contract, that he may forever enjoy primordial auspiciousness.\n\nShould the misfortunes of your disciple converge, and this memorial fail to reach the heavens, I now offer one bolt of plain silk, one *dou* and two *sheng* of rice, one hundred twenty *chi* of silk thread, and a pair of silver rings as tokens of faith in the Daoist gate, to manifest the sincerity of my devotion. Just as withered trees may flourish with nurtured branches and leaves, or depleted granaries be replenished with measures of grain, may a shortened lifespan be extended in length, that he may join the ranks of the ancient seed-people.\n\nI further invoke the Primordial Essence Father and Mother and one hundred thousand attendants to descend together, bearing this memorial directly to the jade table of the Supreme Jade Emperor. I also invoke the Eastern King Father and Western Queen Mother, each with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to descend together and redeem your disciple’s hun and po, augment his years and extend his life, avert disasters and repel misfortune. May the lingering qi of departed kin—those who have passed before and after, and any malevolent influences—be severed and dissolved.\n\nAfter this memorial is presented, may his dwelling be purified and harmonious, his household joyous and secure, free from illness and misfortune. When his prayers are answered, he shall receive the profound grace of the Most High.\n\n*This concludes the fourth scroll of the* Most High’s Proclamation of Universal Assistance in Transformation.\n*This is the fifth scroll of the* Most High’s Proclamation of Compassionate Assistance in Transformation.",

Our dwelling is inauspicious and desolate; our dreams are filled with ugliness and dread. Ghostly qi swirls in confusion, and wherever we turn, we meet with adversity. Nothing prospers as it should. Our wealth dissipates, our livelihoods falter, our fields and silkworms yield little, and our endeavors bring no profit.\n\nSince the [day] of [month], I have suddenly fallen ill. My limbs grow weak, my appetite wanes, and my complexion turns sallow. My hun and po scatter, malevolent spirits bring calamity, and evil ghosts stir disaster. My name has been recorded in the Register of Deaths of the Three Offices, bound within the Five Punishments and Six Harms. Above, I am ensnared by the Heavenly Net; below, I am entangled by the Earthly Snare. I fear that I may not escape these trials of misfortune and disaster. Divination and examination of my form and omens yield no auspicious signs. Moreover, I dread that within this year, my life may be struck by calamity, my allotted years cut short, and the multitude of perils may hasten my end. Disasters and baleful influences now press upon me.\n\nThus, I hasten to summon your servant to my home, beseeching you to present this memorial and invoke the extension of my life and destiny, to bolster my declining years and deliver me from peril, to augment my years and prolong my life, to retrieve my hun and po. I implore the Mandate of the Three Heavens and the memorial for dispelling disasters and averting taboos, to safeguard my life, dissolve calamities, and deliver me from peril. I seek to expel the lingering qi of departed officials, the malevolent influences within and without, the spectral and demonic, and the ghostly marauders lurking in the rear courtyard.\n\nI respectfully invoke the celestial officials, generals, clerks, and soldiers of the Heavenly Bureaus, as itemized below:\n\nI invoke the Heavenly Bureau to command:\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Prefect of Mount Tai, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Three Offices of Mount Tai, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Five Offices of Mount Tai, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Stewards of Mount Tai, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Merit Clerks of Mount Tai, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Five Paths Great Spirits of Mount Tai, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Five Prisons Ministers of Mount Tai, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Keepers of Destiny of Mount Tai, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of Summoning of Mount Tai, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of Deliverance of Mount Tai, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of Life Extension of Mount Tai, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Three Mounds and Five Graves of Mount Tai, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Keepers of Destiny, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of Deliverance from Peril, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of Severing Repeated Afflictions, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of Longevity, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Northern Controller of Destiny, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Minister of Works, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Registrars, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Filial and Spring Clerks, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Recorders, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Seven Prisons Clerks, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Examiners of Life, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Five Earth Altars, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Seven Hearths, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Five Covenants and Seven Oaths, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Twelve Monthly Constellations, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the General of the Grand Year, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Earth Altars and Spirit Shrines, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Three Offices for Redeeming Destiny, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate of the Three Offices for Protecting Destiny, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate for Retrieving the Three Hun and Seven Po, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate for Extending Life and Delivering from Death, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate for Dissolving Disasters and Atoning for Transgressions, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;\nOne Lord of the Gate for Reversing Fate and Transforming Form, with one hundred twenty officials and generals.\n\nIn total, thirty-six divisions of celestial officials, generals, clerks, and soldiers, each with one hundred twenty attendants, and one hundred thousand troops, are hereby assembled.\n\nMay they examine and inquire into the thirty-six divisions of Mount Tai, the twelve Controllers of Destiny of Kunlun, and the prisons and shrines of the spirit altars, to redeem and retrieve my three hun and seven po, my nine destinies and seven registers, my form, shadow, essence, radiance, spirit, and qi.

He petitions your servant, presenting this memorial to the Three Heavens, imploring their mandate to bolster his declining years, deliver him from peril, extend his life’s tally, and augment his longevity.\n\nAlas, your disciple’s entire household, benighted and foolish, has been granted the privilege of entering the gates of the Dao and born into this mortal generation, yet remains mired in the realm of ordinary beings. Since the onset of this year’s early spring, he has encountered successive misfortunes—calamity, peril, and danger—with no auspicious dreams to console him. He fears that adversity, disaster, and decline will converge upon him, that his years will be exhausted and his tally spent, that myriad afflictions will descend, and that his three hun and seven po will be imprisoned in the celestial dungeons and earthly hells, his name recorded in the Register of Deaths of the Three Offices—Heaven, Earth, and Water—within the grasp of the Five Punishments and Six Harms. His household is gripped by dread, and peace and stability elude them.\n\nWith a single heart, he places his trust in the great Dao and entrusts his fate to the Perfected Ones, beseeching your servant to submit this memorial, that his life may be prolonged, his perils delivered, his years extended, and his longevity increased. He begs for the bestowal of true qi to nurture and shield his mortal form, that the generals, officers, soldiers, and swift courier-horses of his life and destiny may soar forth to the gates of the Three Offices—Heaven, Earth, and Water—to intercede on behalf of your disciple. May his name be expunged from the Register of Deaths, his three hun and seven po retrieved and restored to his body, that he may pass through the gates of disaster and peril and forever join the ranks of the ancient seed-people.\n\nWhen his prayers are answered, he shall reverently receive the profound grace.",

The stars of doom press upon him in unbroken succession; his misfortune is recorded in the ledgers of the Three Officials’ *Death and Release* accounts, bound within the Five Punishments and Six Harms. Above, he is ensnared by the Heavenly Net; below, he is entangled by the Earthly Web. Fearing that he may not escape these disasters, misfortunes, and perils in an instant, his entire household is gripped by private anguish, nightly dread, and knows not what recourse to take. Thus, with wholehearted devotion, he places his trust in the Great Dao, entrusting his fate to the Most Perfect and True, and beseeches this minister to submit a memorial, that this disciple [Name] may be upheld in his decline, delivered from calamity, his lifespan extended, his years increased, his *hun* and *po* retrieved and restored to his body, all made complete.\n\nMay all malevolent *qi*—whether from internal or external sources, whether stubborn specters, perverse spirits, or lingering demonic infestations—be eradicated in due order, preserving his life and fate. Should he be marked for death, let it be proclaimed that the Calamity Lord alone, along with one hundred and twenty officials and generals, be dispatched to guard and protect this disciple [Name], securing his life, stabilizing his *hun* and *po*, expunging his name from the registers of death, and inscribing it in the rolls of the living. May his granaries overflow with grain, his lifespan be prolonged, his decline upheld, his calamities delivered, and the *qi* of life flow abundantly.\n\nAfter this memorial is presented, may his dwelling become harmonious and pure, his household thrive in health, his misfortunes be dispelled, and celestial disasters forever averted. May his transgressions be absolved, his debts dissolved, and a hundred spirits come to his defense. The celestial officials, generals, officers, and soldiers who accompany this minister’s triennial memorial shall report his merits and promote his rank as a token of efficacy.\n\nWe implore the Most High, Boundless, and Great Dao; the Most Venerable Masters; and the celestial administrators to bestow their compassion and attend to this plea. Respectfully, on behalf of disciple [Name], we bow before the celestial officials, generals, officers, and soldiers, beseeching them to uphold his decline, deliver him from calamity, increase his years, prolong his lifespan, and petition the Three Heavens to retrieve his *hun* and *po*, restoring them to his body in full. May the Celestial Physicians heal his ailments, safeguard his life, and grant him peace free from harm.\n\nYour servant humbly presents this petition for grace, submitting it to the celestial bureaus, and awaits their decree. With utmost reverence and trepidation, I kowtow, prostrate myself, and bow twice to make this known.\n\n*Thus concludes the fifth scroll of the* Taishang Xuanzhu Huazhang.",

May his decline be delivered, his lifespan extended, and may he find life amidst death and deliverance amidst peril. On the day his wishes are fulfilled, may he receive the profound grace of the Dao’s nurturing mercy. Respectfully submitted.",
