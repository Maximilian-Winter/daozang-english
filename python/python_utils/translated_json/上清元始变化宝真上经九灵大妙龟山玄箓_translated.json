  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Primordial Transformations and Treasured Perfections: The Nine Numinous and Most Wondrous Mysterious Register of Mount Tortoise**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Primordial Transformations and Treasured Perfections: The Nine Numinous and Most Wondrous Mysterious Register of Mount Tortoise* (abbreviated as *The Mysterious Register of Mount Tortoise*).\n**Author:** Unknown, approximately dated to the Northern and Southern Dynasties period. A foundational scripture of the early Supreme Clarity (Shangqing) tradition. Three scrolls in length.\n\n**Source of Base Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity Tradition*, First Section.\n**Collated with:** Dunhuang manuscript P.3435 (fragmentary).\n\n---\n\n### *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Primordial Transformations and Treasured Perfections: The Nine Numinous and Most Wondrous Mysterious Register of Mount Tortoise, Scroll One*\n\nThe treasured scriptures of Supreme Clarity arose at the very inception of the Nine Heavens, born of spontaneity and coexisting with *qi*. The Three Radiant Ones shone in unison, manifesting above the Nine Heavens and within the Great Void. At times, they coalesced into soaring, mysterious purple *qi*, forming numinous texts—celestial writings of subtle wonder, their strokes sinuous and intricate, each character a full *zhang* in breadth, their depths beyond easy comprehension. None but the True Kings of the Nine Heavens could fathom their profound resonance.\n\nIn the first year of the *Above-Void* era, the True Kings of the Nine Heavens commanded the Supreme Perfected Ones of the Mysterious Capital to cast gold into tablets. The assembled sages, enlightened to the luminous meanings and the supreme oral transmissions, compiled the numinous chapters. The Jade Emperor inscribed the brushstrokes, engraving the tablets into scripture. Their postures and rhythms—whether rising or descending—followed a hierarchy of ranks and prohibitions, each category derived from the esoteric intentions of the exalted sages. These were sealed above the Nine Heavens, within the Jade Chambers of the Grand Existence Palace, guarded by the Jade Maidens of the Western Florescence and the Purple Lads of the Golden Dawn of the Primordial Numinous Palace.\n\nThe Mountain of the Western Tortoise, also called Dragon Mountain, serves as the root and pivot of the Nine Heavens, the abyssal repository of the myriad *qi*. Located at the northwest corner of the heavens, it spans four hundred thousand *li* in circumference, its height bordering the Jade Clarity Heaven. To the southeast, it connects with the rosy clouds of the *Through-Yang* realm, ascending to the Gate of the Divine Tiger of the Azure Palace. To the northwest, it intersects the wilds of the *Cold Cavern*, rising to the Court of the Immortals of the Golden Portal. To the south, it extends to the Crimson Floating-Ripple Land, its *qi* harmonizing with the radiance of the *Cavern-Yang*. To the north, it points toward the *Curved Array*, linking with the *Flourishing Canopy*, its *qi* treading the vast numinous expanse. At its center, it soars directly toward the Eightfold Crossroads of the Jade Capital atop the summit of the Intersecting Winds Mountain. Thirty thousand *li* of level heavens are encircled by walls of surging gold and gates of wrought jade, adorned with golden terraces, jade towers, and twelve divine palaces.\n\nAbove stand halls of naturally flowing essence, the Purple Portal and Golden Florescence Chambers, and chambers of jasper and jade, flanked by nine cavernous grottoes. Spontaneously arising purple clouds interweave with phoenix-script patterns, their nine hues cascading in array. Cliffs bear purple cassia, ridges flourish with jade groves, coral branches intertwine, and jade roots take hold. The *Kan* trees bear fruit, the *Red Children* and *White Rings* gleam, the *Three Florals* radiate blossoms upon the crimson radiance, and *reverse fragrance* flows through the *Great Mystery*. The eight *qi* fan the winds in ceaseless motion, jade flutes resound in the void to form celestial music. Dragons roar from cloud towers, phoenixes cry atop distant peaks. Venomous beasts gather in the thousands, serpents coil a thousand *xun* in length. Divine palaces stand majestic, cloud-borne immortals swarm in multitudes. The towering primordial halls brim with emanations of every kind—such are the wondrous transformations of the Primordial Beginning, the true numinous root of the Celestial Origin.\n\nWithin the Hall of the Golden Florescence, above the northern window, a spontaneously arising purple *qi* coalesces into mysterious script, each character a full *zhang* in breadth, its rays cascading in luminous splendor. The celestial writing is of subtle wonder, its depths beyond easy comprehension. In the first year of the *Shangjia* era, the Venerable of the Nine Heavens ascended to the Cloud Palace to perform the purification fast. Gazing upon the radiant scene of Mount Tortoise, he engraved golden tablets and transcribed the mysterious script, dispelling its long-standing obscurities and expounding its numinous resonance. It was recorded as *The Crimson Sovereign’s Flying Mystery and Purple Writ of Mount Tortoise*.\n\nOn the first *yin* day of the first month of the first year of the *Kaihuang* era, the Queen Mother of the West rode the void upon a numinous vessel, soaring through the Nine Empyreans. She purified herself upon Mount Tortoise and ascended the naturally flowing essence of the Purple Portal and Golden Florescence Jasper Hall. Wandering to the northern window, she paid homage to the mysterious script, gazing upon the cliffs in contemplation of the numinous and directing her thoughts toward the Supreme Perfected Ones. Thereupon, her wondrous perception awakened to the mystery, and her cinnabar heart revealed itself.\n\nSuddenly, a great celestial perfected one appeared, bearing the sun and moon, a halo encircling his neck, accompanied by a retinue of feather-canopied immortals. He arrived upon a flying chariot of purple clouds and ninefold luminous auroras, prostrating before the Queen Mother. He announced: \"I am the Perfected King Governing the Phoenix Palace of the Nine Heavens, surnamed *Supreme Mystery* and styled *Kaiming*. By the command of the Primordial Heavenly King, I have descended to bestow upon you the golden script of the Nine Heavens, the purple characters of the *Azure-Golden Crimson Sovereign’s Writ*.\" He conferred upon her the title *Supreme Perfected Mother of the Nine Numinous Ones of the Western Origin* and enfeoffed her as the sovereign of the Western Tortoise Peak. He further bestowed a plain scripture scroll, the *Primordial Record of the Supreme Perfected One’s Transformations at Birth*, which oversees the registers of immortals and upholds the lineage of the Jade Clarity.\n\nAdditionally, he presented a tablet of azure jasper and granted her the *Flying Azure Feather Robe of the Phoenix Garments of the Nine Heavens*, the *Morning Infant Jade Crown*, the *Phoenix-Cloud Sandals*, the *Divine Phoenix Purple Wheel Flying Feather Canopy* of twenty-four carriages, and the *Five-Colored Command Banners of the Numinous Standards*. He also assigned seven hundred Jade Maidens of the Upper Palace’s Golden Florescence to attend and protect the Perfected Mother. She was charged with governing the Jasper Hall of the Flowing Essence Purple Portal and Golden Florescence, ascending thrice monthly to the Jade Clarity, twice feasting upon Kunlun, and reviewing the multitudes of immortals every five assemblies.\n\nThereupon, the great celestial perfected one completed his mission and returned to his jade palace. The Perfected Mother, having received her mandate, ascended her throne and addressed the assembly in the Jasper Hall. She commanded her attendants, the Jade Maiden Wang Zideng and Dong Shuangcheng, to receive with reverence the golden script of the purple characters upon the azure jasper tablet, the *Azure-Golden Crimson Sovereign’s Conferral Writ*, the *Primordial Record of the Supreme Perfected One’s Transformations at Birth*, and the *Flying Mystery and Purple Writ*—four items in total—sealing them with the *Crimson Sovereign’s Seal* and entombing them within the Jasper Chamber. She appointed thirty Jade Maidens of the Golden Florescence and thirty Purple Lads of the Golden Dawn to guard the numinous script.\n\nFollowing the ancient statutes of the Three Heavens regarding postures and rhythms, she proclaimed to the Five Emperors, the Five Peaks, the numinous mountains, rivers, and seas, commanding their divine officials to submit the names of practitioners every five days, distinguishing merits and transgressions, and reporting them according to rank. The Perfected Mother customarily observes the eight solar terms, and every five days, she feasts in the Cloud Palace, traverses the Five Peaks, surveys the sources of the rivers, and roams the eight directions.\n\nAt this moment, the Five Stars emerge in their stations, the sun and moon halt their radiance, the hundred yang forces surge like lightning, molten metal gleams with refined essence, the Heavenly Warriors march as vanguard, and the Five Elders bear the banners. The Perfected Mother customarily rides her nine-hued chariot of purple clouds and flying wheels, attended by five thousand Heavenly Immortals and Jade Maidens. The women ride phoenixes, the men spur dragons; the Flying Immortals in feathered robes all hold floral banners, their reed pipes and flutes resounding in harmonious chorus. The cries of simurghs and the calls of phoenixes echo through the cloud formations, while radiant lights intertwine, the Three Luminaries merge in brilliance. The Purple Lads waft incense to dispel impurities, the Divine Consorts scatter blossoms to bathe the Perfected; the celestial scales unfurl their canopies, purple mists veil the empty courtyard, jade light streams across the firmament, and numinous transformation commands the myriad spirits. At this time, the Six Heavens obey her command, all malevolent forces bind their forms, demonic perversities lose their sight, the heavens grow bright and the qi pure—such is the wondrous vision of the loftiest immortals, the luminous efficacy of the Crimson Sovereign’s cavern-spirit.\n\n*The Crimson Sovereign’s Flying Mystery Purple Text*\nFlying Mystery Purple Qi congeals the numinous root,\nThe net of Jade Void governs the myriad spirits.\nIn the emptiness, it billows and coalesces naturally,\nAbove stand twelve towering peaks,\nJade towers soaring high amid luminous clouds,\nFlowing essence and purple pavilions girded with golden portals,\nResplendent jasper halls encircling the Eight Transcendents,\nFrom their midst emerge the Nine Numinous Immortals of Azure Gold.\n\nThe Crimson Sovereign Perfected Mother is styled *Essence-Extension*,\nClad in flying azure feathered robes and a morning-infant crown,\nIn her left hand she holds the Jade Staff, in her right the Numinous Banner,\nCommanding the Five-Colored Demons to attend the August Honored One.\nShe grasps the talismanic registers at the Gate of Life,\nChewing the moon and sipping the sun, inhaling jade springs,\nThe Net of Separation emits its radiance to refine the five souls,\nInternally replete and externally overflowing, the Crimson Palace rejoices.\nGolden light shines resplendently, her form perfectly round,\nFrom the new moon she enters the Metal phase, her color murky and profound.\n\nOnly the Enlightened One understands these words:\nOn the fifth day of the fifth month, the essence of the Northern Prime appears,\nEngraved in sight is the Floral Canopy leading the Immortal Lords.\nPurple Qi revolves leftward with the Dipper’s motion,\nTraversing the twenty-eight lunar lodges to enter the Golden Gate.\n\nThis is when the Crimson Sovereign reviews the myriad immortals.\nThose who illuminate this secret with diligent devotion,\nClothing their forms and concentrating their thoughts to discern its divisions,\nShall perceive the wondrous vision and attain the essential text.\nAfter three years, they shall surely preserve their longevity,\nAfter nine years, they shall ascend the void and don feathered skirts,\nLightly soaring in phoenix robes to ascend Dragon Mountain,\nBowing and rising to pay homage to the Nine Numinous Ones and the Jade Dawn.\n\nThe Southern Culmen Supreme Prime Lord states: This is the text of *Congealed Purple Qi and Flying Mystery*, engraved upon the Western Tortoise Mountain, its flowing essence inscribed upon the northern window of the Purple Pavilion, Golden Florescence, and Jasper Hall. The Nine Heavens’ Venerable Elder titled this work *The Crimson Sovereign’s Flying Mystery Purple Text of Tortoise Mountain*. The Queen Mother of the West treasures and conceals it; its purport is profoundly recondite, all being the subtle rhythms of the Nine Heavens. Without an immortal name, one cannot approach its chapters. Those who obtain it are recorded in the Nine Heavens’ registers, their names inscribed upon Tortoise Mountain.\n\nThe Nine Heavens’ Venerable Elder says: Cultivate this Dao during the ten months of the year—namely, the first, second, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, eleventh, and twelfth months. On the third, fifth, ninth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of each month—five times monthly—purify yourself and recite the text once. After midnight, step into the central courtyard, gaze upward, and observe the Floral Canopy within the Northern Dipper, where Purple Cloud Qi revolves leftward from the Dipper’s net, traversing the twenty-eight lunar lodges before returning above the Golden Gate. If the sky is overcast and devoid of light, perform this inwardly within your chamber, visualizing the method as described. Upon completing the visualization, bow four times toward the Purple Cloud, click your teeth thrice, and raise your gaze to pray:\n\n“The night sky gleams clear, the hidden void reveals the Perfected,\nFlowing clouds linger, golden florescence guards the four quarters.\nThe Crimson Sovereign spreads its radiance, the numinous flies in purple chariots.\nThis evening, the azure gold bestows immortality,\nFulfilling my supreme aspiration, my body aligns with spontaneity.\nI bind my life to the moon’s essence, preserving the root of years and days.\nThe Three Numinous Ones merge in splendor, eternally abiding on Dragon Mountain.\nIn the secrecy of night, my devotion is unveiled—may it be as I have spoken.”\n\nConclude by drawing in Purple Qi twenty-eight times and swallowing it. Practicing this for three years, divine immortals shall manifest signs upon your sleeping mat. Your body shall be enveloped in Purple Qi, your form interwoven with its glow, and your name inscribed in the Nine Heavens’ registers—you shall surely ascend as an immortal.\n\nThe Nine Heavens’ Venerable Elder says: Though the celestial scriptures number in the thousands, each expounding its wonders, even this single practice suffices to summon numinous immortals to descend, to spread their wings across the Nine Empyreans, to soar through the Jade Clarity, and to roam and feast in the Cloud Palace. Were this not a wondrous method, the Queen Mother of the West would not have concealed it within her inner robe, nor would the Great Existence have left its prohibitions unspoken.\n\nThe Supreme Prime Lord of the Southern Culmen states: The heavens possess clouds of forbidden qi that encroach upon the divisions of the sun, moon, and Five Stars. In those regions and kingdoms, there are those who align with the Dao and attain immortality as lords. When such omens appear, their signs manifest of their own accord.\n\nThe Nine Heavens’ Venerable Elder says: Upon witnessing these clouds, perform the rites and prayers as prescribed, not merely on the appointed days. Apply diligent mindfulness, and when the clouds descend, you shall ascend to meet them. Seal this within your heart; do not lightly reveal it to others. If the Dao is divulged, its numinosity disperses, and immortals shall have no means to respond.\n\n*The Highest Primordial Bestows the Azure Gold Crimson Sovereign Jade Text upon the Queen Mother of the West*\nThe Supreme Primordial addresses the Numinous Nine Heavens and the Ancestral Void: The Queen Mother of the West, named *Graceful Robe*, is the essence of the Nine Numinous Qi of Heaven, the coalescence of the Western Metal’s spirit, the knotting of Purple Cloud’s embryonic bones, the refinement of the sun’s radiance, the inhalation and exhalation of the Seven Luminaries’ splendor. She harmonizes with the morning mist to feast upon the marrow of the Great Yang Phoenix, sips the moon’s essence and orchid brain, congeals within the jade root and golden treasury, binds her cinnabar form, and enfolds her purple heart. Her manifestation is revealed in the Crimson Sovereign’s wondrous chart, her rank exalted among the imperial chariots. She reposes upon the numinous peaks, her heart stilled in the upper clarity, her merits aiding the ten thousand kinds, her beneficence overflowing all life. Holding fast to her singular integrity, she endures through kalpas unending—thus the Highest Primordial bestows upon her the *Curved Florescence*.\n\nLady Wanjin, by virtue of her golden perfection, is granted the title of \"Meditation Mistress of the Western Primordial Nine Numinous Supreme Realized Immortal Mother, Azure-Golden Cinnabar Sovereign.\" She is enfeoffed to govern Tortoise Mountain, overseeing the primordial registers. In accordance with celestial protocol, she receives the azure-jade tablets inscribed with golden script and jade characters, is bestowed the nine-heaven phoenix robes of flying azure plumes, the morning-infant jade crown and phoenix-cloud sandals, twenty-four divine phoenix purple-wheel flying feathered canopies, five-colored ritual banners and spirit-summoning staffs, flowing-gold fire-bells and night-glowing candles, demon-quelling jade talismans and nine-heaven celestial missives. To her defense are assigned seven hundred Jade Maidens of the Upper Palace and Western Florescence, who attend her at the Flowing Essence Purple Pavilion of Golden Florescence within Tortoise Mountain. Thrice monthly she ascends to the Jade Clarity, twice feasts upon Kunlun, and oversees the five assemblies of immortals, the five marchmounts, rivers and seas, and the ten directions’ numinous officials—none are beyond her governance, as fully set forth in the records.\n\nAll ritual protocols follow the ancient statutes of the Jade Terrace’s *Great Possession* and the Three Heavens’ orthodox scriptures. The azure-jade tablets inscribed with golden script and jade characters, along with the Azure-Golden Cinnabar Sovereign’s investiture texts, all derive from the celestial norms of the Great Possession Palace’s *Reciprocal Protocol*, composed in the spontaneously arisen chapters of the Highest Mystery’s Empty Cavern. These are conferred upon the palaces of the loftiest realized immortals and exalted sages, not upon neophytes.\n\nAs in the Golden Watchtower of the Eastern Florescence and other celestial palaces, there exist protocols for summoning neophytes and fledgling immortals—these too issue from the *Great Possession*’s norms, differing only in rank and dignity. Unless one’s name is recorded in the Nine Heavens or registered in the *Square Cauldron*, one shall never glimpse their contents. Those who do behold their texts are destined for rebirth upon inscribed tablets, their names inscribed in the imperial registers, and shall attain immortality—thus their destiny is foretold in the numinous statutes. On the day of Dao attainment, celestial perfected beings shall descend to receive their texts and investiture.\n\nThe Southern Culmen’s Upper Primordial Lord states: The golden script and jade characters are engraved upon azure-jade tablets, or inscribed upon green-jade tablets. Each tablet measures nine inches and nine fen in length, two inches and four fen in width, with characters threaded in gold. Two jade lads and two jade maidens attend each tablet, tending incense and overseeing transmission. According to the *Bright Statutes of the Four Poles*, if a qualified recipient exists within a century, a single transmission is permitted.\n\nThe Southern Culmen’s Upper Primordial Lord states: Azure-jade is not within the capacity of mundane persons to employ. If one’s name is recorded in the *Square Cauldron* and one beholds the texts, they may be engraved upon green-wood tablets, with characters threaded in gold, stored in azure-silk pouches. After nine years of burning incense and reverent worship, celestial perfected beings shall descend to bestow the azure-jade tablets.\n\nThe Southern Culmen’s Upper Primordial Lord states: The primordial registers of initial transformation and the nine *qi* of the primordial cavern coexist with birth. The Highest Jade Sovereign, supreme sage and imperial perfected, all coalesce the *qi* of the primordial cavern to form their names and titles. Their robes, crowns, and adornments all derive from the *Reciprocal Protocol* of the Nine Heavens’ *Great Possession*, while their dwelling places and village names arise spontaneously. Heaven possesses the *qi* of eight assemblies and the revolutions of four transformations, which, through the brazen canopy and jade emptiness, govern yin and yang, initiate the mysterious workings, and bring forth the ten thousand kinds. The transformations and luminous manifestations of the loftiest sages follow the four seasons’ governance, aligning with the revolutions and responding to destiny, advancing with transformation, without decline or aging, enduring eternally. Thus it is said: the Dao has no constant name—this is what is meant.\n\nAs the Queen Mother’s virtue repays the Highest Mystery, she is made the mother of the ten thousand *qi*. Thus the Primordial Beginning bestows upon her the title of Cinnabar Sovereign and confers a scroll of the *Primordial Register of Plain Script*, to be transmitted to later sages and immortals. Through it, they may know that the Dao of the Primordial Beginning coalesces spontaneously arisen names and possesses the *qi* of transformation. Those who behold its chapters shall have their names inscribed in reverse upon the immortal registers of the Nine Heavens, their names engraved upon the Cinnabar Terrace of the *Square Cauldron*. With focused contemplation, within nine years they shall attain union with the perfected, repose in chambers of countenance, and transform with the four seasons, soaring through the Nine Heavens.\n\nThe Southern Culmen’s Upper Primordial Lord states: The Dao of the Upper Clarity’s *Highest Mystery’s Precious Scriptures* relies upon visualization for resonance and swallowing *qi* for communion. Once one has accessed its chapters, one should clarify the visualizations of the Primordial Beginning’s transformations, discerning their forms, colors, luminous *qi*, and adornments as they change with the four seasons. Then, with eyes closed and without speech, one shall spontaneously arrive; swallowing *qi* without effort, one shall spontaneously commune. Thus, within ten days one shall behold the divine, and within ten months one’s *qi* shall be replete.\n\nLater learners and worthies may diligently refine their contemplation, thereby illuminating the mysterious emptiness and finding the path to immortality.\n\nThe Southern Culmen’s Upper Primordial Lord states: Those who cultivate the Dao of the loftiest immortals—visualizing deities, invoking the perfected, ingesting *qi*, and swallowing saliva—yet remain ignorant of the Primordial Beginning’s names, the four seasons’ transformations, and the root sources of luminous manifestations and *qi*, merely close their eyes in vast obscurity and swallow emptily without intent. How then shall the divine perfected descend? How shall *qi* and saliva be replenished? Gazing upon countenances, one perceives only dimness—how much more so in the boundless expanse, where forms and *qi* remain undiscerned. Such efforts are but vain labor in repose, profitless in empty chanting.\n\nThe *Primordial Register of Initial Transformation of the Upper Clarity*:\nThe Primordial Beginning’s August Supreme Elder, born of the primordial jade emptiness’s *qi*, bears the taboo name *Yanshiyin* and the style *Guanwujue*. His form measures ninety million *zhang* in height. During the three months of spring, he wears the nine-*qi* flowing-essence purple-radiance crown, robes of nine-light brocade, and a sash of nine-colored seamless spontaneous silk. Girded with the six-mountain fire-jade, he rides clouds of azure and deep green. When seated, he rests upon nine-colored lions, their brilliance resplendent in the Upper Clarity’s jade emptiness. When visualized, he returns to a height of nine inches and nine *fen*.\n\nDuring the three months of summer, the Primordial Beginning’s August Supreme Elder transforms into a single body with nine heads, measuring seven thousand *zhang* in height. He wears a nine-colored cloud crown, a robe of cinnabar brocade woven with boundless radiance, and a girdle of the nine great immortals’ refined swords. He rides clouds of cinnabar and purple, seated upon nine-colored dragons, their luminosity flowing and resplendent in the jade emptiness’s purple clouds. When visualized, he returns to a height of nine inches.\n\nIn the three months of autumn, the August Supreme Elder transforms into a single body with nine phoenix heads, measuring five thousand *zhang* in height. He wears a nine-colored, striped tiger robe, rides clouds of seven hues, their radiant lights intermingling and resplendent in the Upper Clarity. When visualized, he returns to a height of seven inches and seven *fen*.\n\nDuring the three months of winter, the August Supreme Elder transforms into a luminous glow of azure and black, its brilliance surging like the moon’s essence. This is the reversal of the jade emptiness’s *qi*, where he refines and receives the essence of the Primordial Beginning. When visualized, he reverts to his original true form.\n\nTo cultivate the Dao of the Primordial Beginning, one should, on the day of the Beginning of Spring, bathe and enter the chamber, face east, and bow nine times to the August Supreme Elder of the Primordial Beginning. Then, turn north, click the teeth nine times, and visualize the August Supreme Elder assuming his four seasonal forms in the Golden Radiance Palace of the Upper Clarity’s Jasper Heavenly Court, within the Eightfold Brilliance Precinct of the True Settlement. Let the true light descend and reflect into the adept’s Hall of Light, and softly intone the incantation:\n\n*\"August Supreme, opener of truth,\nNine Ways unite in clarity,\nTransforming and refining the void,\nIlluminating the Upper Clarity.\nShapes divide, radiance shifts,\nFour seasons flow in harmony.\nI partake of the true,\nMerge with truth’s numinous power.\nWithin, jade immortals coalesce,\nWithout, the Eight Darknesses entwine.\nEight luminaries lend their wings,\nConveying the cinnabar chariot.\nRiding clouds, driving mist,\nWhip in hand, I ascend the Upper Clarity,\nSoaring through cloud chambers,\nTo pay homage in the imperial capital.\"*\n\nConclude by gazing upward and swallowing nine breaths.\n\nOne who knows the Primordial Beginning’s transformations of form and radiance, along with his inner secret names, shall live nine hundred years. After nine years of cultivation, one’s countenance shall commune with the divine, enabling the adept to transform and soar through the great void.\n\nThe Lofty Numinous Lord of the Nine Heavens, born of the *qi* of the Primordial Void, bears the inner name *Supreme Vision of the Grotto* and the style *Moving Brahma*. His form measures ninety million *zhang* in height. In the three months of autumn, he wears a golden-flowered crown, a cloud-patterned brocade robe, and a girdle of nine luminous, chiming bells interwoven with a purple sash of intersecting numina. He rides clouds of cinnabar and azure, seated upon nine-colored lions, their radiance blazing in the Upper Clarity. When visualized, he returns to a height of seven inches.\n\nIn the three months of winter, the Lofty Numinous Lord of the Nine Heavens transforms into nine heads, each crowned with a sun. His single body is clad in a nine-colored, striped phoenix robe. He constantly rides clouds of azure and yellow, seated upon nine-colored lions, their luminous splendor resplendent in the Upper Clarity. When visualized, he reverts to his true form.\n\nDuring the three months of spring, the Lord of the Nine Heavens divides his form into nine persons, each mouth holding a moon. They wear feathered robes adorned with phoenix patterns, constantly riding nine-colored clouds, seated upon nine-colored mists, their radiance dazzling in the Upper Clarity’s Great Void. When visualized, they revert to their true forms.\n\nIn the three months of summer, the Lord of the Nine Heavens unites into a single form, a light of four hues—purple, azure, cinnabar, and red—its *qi* blending and illuminating the nine heavens. This is the reversal of the Great Void’s form, where he refines and receives the essence of the nine heavens. When visualized, he reverts to his true form.\n\nTo cultivate the Dao of the True Lord of the Nine Heavens, one should, on the winter solstice, bathe and enter the chamber, face west, and bow nine times to the Lord of the Nine Heavens. Then, turn north, click the teeth nine times, and visualize the Lord of the Nine Heavens assuming his four seasonal forms in the Golden Orchid Palace of the Upper Clarity’s Grand Clarity Court, within the Open Brilliance Precinct of the Permeating Truth Settlement. Let the true light descend and reflect into the adept’s Upper Cinnabar Field, and softly intone the incantation:\n\n*\"Ninefold numinous primordial essence,\nRefining and transforming the supreme brilliance,\nThree harmonies align in radiance,\n*Qi* scatters, forms divide.\nEmerging from emptiness, entering mystery,\nAbove yellow, below azure,\nCycles turn with the dawn,\nInterweaving the cinnabar chariot.\nWandering the high void,\nReflecting into my courtyard,\nMerging with true light.\nDivine transformations arise,\nEnabling cloud-borne flight,\nTo sport in the Upper Clarity.\"*\n\nConclude by gazing upward and swallowing nine breaths.\n\nAfter nine years of cultivation, one shall ascend to move the nine heavens, and the divine immortals shall descend to bestow upon the adept the true scriptures. Naturally, one shall ride the nine-colored cloud chariot and soar through the Upper Clarity.\n\nThe Jade True Elder of the Nine Heavens, born of the *qi* of the Purple Void, bears the inner name *Prolonging the World’s Brilliance* and the style *Linked Above*. His form measures ninety million *zhang* in height. In the three months of winter, he wears a crown of a hundred shifting essences, a nine-colored, naturally luminous brocade robe, and carries the Nine Primordials’ Permeating Truth talisman. He constantly rides five-colored clouds, seated upon nine-colored mists, their radiance resplendent in the Upper Clarity. When visualized, he returns to a height of nine inches.\n\nDuring the three months of spring, the Jade True Elder of the Nine Heavens transforms into a phoenix with a single body and nine heads, each crowned with the nine *qi* of dark essence. He wears a nine-colored, striped feathered robe and constantly rides twelve flying *lin* beasts, seated upon five-colored lotus blossoms. Their radiance flows with a hundred shifting hues in the Upper Clarity’s Purple Void. When visualized, he reverts to his true form.\n\nIn the three months of summer, the Jade True Elder of the Nine Heavens transforms into a dragon-bodied, human-headed form, crowned with twelve lights. He wears a feathered robe of azure, yellow, and purple, and holds a plain sash in his mouth. He constantly rides nine-colored clouds, seated upon five-colored lions, their light illuminating the Upper Clarity. When visualized, he reverts to his true form.\n\nIn the three months of autumn, the Jade True Elder of the Nine Heavens transforms into a light of purple and green, their *qi* intertwining like the sun and moon overlapping. This is the reversal of the Purple Void’s form, where he refines and receives the essence of the nine heavens. When visualized, he reverts to his true form.\n\nTo practice the Dao of the Jade True Elder of the Nine Heavens, one should, on the day of the Beginning of Winter, bathe and enter the chamber, face northwest, and bow nine times to the Elder of the Nine Heavens. Then, turn north, click the teeth nine times, and visualize the Elder of the Nine Heavens assuming his four seasonal forms in the Cinnabar Numinous Palace of the Upper Clarity’s Open Clarity Court, within the Threefold Union Precinct of the Primordial Brilliance Settlement. Let the true light descend and reflect into the adept’s Grotto Chamber, and softly intone the incantation:\n\n*\"Numinous one of the nine heavens above,\nPrimordial and self-so,\nContaining and refining the eight Ways,\nNinefold true embryonic immortals.\nWithin, the purple primordial treasure,\nWithout, the three simplicities entwined.\nTransforming radiance, refining *qi*,\nFlowing with the seasons’ cycles.\nPenetrating transformations, entering subtlety,\nMy Dao is early apportioned.\nEyes summon divine splendor,\nHeart unfolds the five clouds.\nWhip in hand, riding the eight luminaries,\nI fly into the imperial dawn.\"*\n\nConclude by gazing upward and swallowing nine breaths.\n\nUpon completion, gaze upward and swallow nine breaths to conclude.\n\nKnowing the Nine Heavens’ Venerable One’s transformations and manifestations, inscribe his inner secret name upon the Nine Heavens. After nine years of cultivation, one may behold the true spirit, ride the void in flight, and ascend to Jade Clarity.\n\nThe Dao-root of the Nine Heavens’ Primordial Father is the *qi* of the Primordial Grotto’s root. His secret name is Ninefold Numinous Guide, and his style is Primal Great Perfected. His form spans ninety million *zhang*.\n\nIn the three months of spring, he wears a crimson jade headband of seven measures, the Crown of the Treasure Heaven of the Boundless, and dons the Nine Heavens’ Phoenix Robe and Divine Cloud Phoenix Sandals. Girded with the embroidered Sash of Plain Numinosity, he ever rides the Azure Mist Flying Chariot, attended by twelve flying dragons. When seated, nine-colored radiant light emanates from him, high above Jade Clarity, his brilliance shifting a hundredfold to illuminate the vast firmament. In meditation, his form extends to nine *cun*.\n\nIn the three months of summer, the Primordial Father transforms into a single body with nine heads, each crowned with a sun. Clad in a tiger-fur robe adorned with red phoenix patterns and girded with twelve-colored ribbons, he rides a nine-hued phoenix. When seated, he rests upon the yellow and white *qi*, his luminosity blazing through the void, illuminating Jade Clarity’s depths. In meditation, one reverts to his true form.\n\nIn the three months of autumn, the Primordial Father divides into nine figures, all identically robed in nine-colored feathered gowns. Each bears the Dragon Abyss Sword at his waist, a tiger-headed pouch, and the intertwined Sash of Plain Numinosity. Seated upon the nine *qi* of the Dark Void, their radiance shifts and gleams, illuminating the subtle intricacies of Jade Clarity’s Grotto Root. In meditation, one reverts to his true form.\n\nIn the three months of winter, the Primordial Father transforms into the radiance of solar essence, intermingling with the purple brilliance.

In the months of the four seasons, he wears a Yellow Morn Jade Crown that reaches to heaven, a robe of yellow brocade, a skirt of dark-yellow flying-cloud brocade, carries the Yellow Spirit Yueyuan Staff, and girds the Spirit-Flying Purple Sash. He constantly stands atop a five-colored lion amid yellow clouds. Visualize him as returning to a height of three cun and three fen.\n\nIn the three autumn months, the White Qi Jade Yellow Thearch transforms his form, dividing into four youths clad in brocade robes of blue, white, red, and black, with flying-cloud brocade capes. Each wears a solar essence blossom upon his head and holds a five-colored banner, standing upon white clouds. Visualize him as reverting to his true form.\n\nIn the three winter months, the Black Qi Jade Yellow Thearch transforms into a single body with four heads of vermilion birds, their feathers resplendent and dappled, illuminating the northern quarter. Visualize him as reverting to his true form.\n\nIn the three spring months, the Blue Qi Jade Yellow Thearch transforms into a Venerable Elder of the August Above, his entire body yellow, wearing a halo like a wheel of light, holding a golden bell, and standing upon blue clouds. Visualize him as reverting to his true form.\n\nIn the three summer months, the Red Qi Jade Yellow Thearch transforms into a crimson radiance, its luminous hue flickering and bright, illuminating the southern quarter. This is the reversion of the High August’s qi, whereupon he receives the refined primordial yellow essence of generation. Visualize him as reverting to his true form.\n\nTo practice the Way of the Yellow Thearch, on the day of the Great Year and the first day of the jiazi cycle, enter the chamber and bow twelve times toward the Great Year. When the audience with the Yellow Thearch is complete, turn north, knock the teeth twelve times, and visualize the Yellow Thearch in his seasonal forms, residing in the Fourfold Round Hamlet of the Wu Village within the High August Prefecture of the Yellow Prime Palace of Highest Clarity. His reverted true essence descends and illumines, entering one’s Spleen Mansion. Then recite the incantation:\n\nThe Four Rigidities unite in truth, numinous transformations know no bounds. The Dao merges into one, the Five Phases unfold. Following the revolutions, names change; encircling the four quarters. Today is most auspicious, riding Yin and steering Yang. The Six Jia talismans align, the Grand Unity descends to welcome. Bind my register, inscribe my name in the Upper Capital. Attaining audience with the Three Origins, preserving the divine and august immortal.\n\nWhen finished, look upward and swallow the twelve qi to conclude.\n\n---\n\nThe Highest Clarity Primordial Beginning’s Transmutations and Primordial Registers\n\nThe High August Jade Emperor, the Supreme Sage Lord, the Nine Heavens Jade Perfected—all receive qi naturally, entrust their forms to jade wombs, conceal their brilliance in the Purple Prime, and through numinous harmony and resonance, attain personhood. Descendants of the imperial lineage, born as perfected beings, they knit the hollow cavern to form their script and unite the Three Qi to compose their names. Receiving the title of Thearch, they respond and transform in Highest Clarity, governing the immortals of the High Void, presiding over the Mysterious Mysteries. With the four seasons’ changes, they adjust the nodes and adapt, bathing, donning crowns and sashes, refining and adorning to endure forever. Their transformations of form and shadow respond to resonance and arise, obscure and indistinct.\n\nThus the Dao has no constant name; its depths cannot be fathomed, its subtleties cannot be exhausted. Heaven and earth rely upon it to stand, the Grand Mystery harmonizes with it to attain clarity. Sun and moon hold to it to shine brightly; the Five Phases receive it to attain numinosity. Vast is its virtue’s origin, boundless its lofty honor. Its Dao is exalted and wondrous, beyond all comparison.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning’s recorded registers are concealed within the Purple Chamber of the Supreme Lord’s Sixfold Union Palace. Transmitted once in ten thousand kalpas, they are the Nine Heavens’ forbidden scriptures, not to be heard by ghosts or spirits.\n\nThose who obtain and behold their chapter titles shall rejoice in the flourishing of their ancestral leaves, their blessings flowing to the mysterious root. Their souls ascend to the Southern Palace, their seven ancestors share in the joy. Their names inscribed on jade tablets, they attain immortality in life and death.\n\nLater sages studying the Way of the Supreme Perfected should refine and master the forms of the Primordial Beginning’s transmutations, adapting with the seasonal nodes to communicate with the true, revert the qi, and refine the spirit.\n\nFor instance, the Primordial Beginning’s August Elder of the Above, on the day of the Beginning of Spring, receives the qi of the Primordial Jade Void and assumes the title of August Elder of the Above. These are all true forms, their garments of proper colors. Throughout the ninety days of the three spring months, he resides in truth and presides in rectitude. By the day of the Beginning of Summer, the August Elder of the Above transforms his proper form, receiving the seasonal transmutation. Bathing in the divine and perfected, this is called “transmuting the immortal and exchanging the radiance,” communicating with the true and receiving the numinous, causing the qi to endure forever.\n\nIn the ninety days of the three summer months, the immortal soul bathes, the divine and perfected resonate and communicate. By the day of the Beginning of Autumn, the August Elder of the Above transforms his form with the season, donning the Five Constants’ crown and sash, called “immortal transmutation.” The qi communicates with the Mysterious Mysteries, filling within and overflowing without. Radiance and brilliance manifest, transforming the true and nourishing the qi, causing the qi to be inexhaustible.\n\nIn the ninety days of the three autumn months, donning the Nine Heavens’ crown and sash, the immortal transmutation is perfected. By the day of the Beginning of Winter, the August Elder of the Above contains the true, embraces fetal breathing, reverts the qi to its natural state, liberates the bodily form, transforms the radiance to enter the light, and returns to his primordial beginning. Receiving refinement and reverting the essence, he nurtures and polishes the divine and true. His radiance and color blend into chaos, like misty clouds.\n\nIn the ninety days of the three winter months, he congeals the qi and concentrates the spirit, returning to his proper form. Four revolutions complete the cycle, and the cycle renews. These are the Primordial Beginning’s four seasonal transmutations, adapting appearances with the nodes.\n\nThe revolutions of heaven and earth all have flourishing and decline, closure and opening, rest and activity, responding to the Celestial Pass. When flourishing, they preside in rectitude; when resting, they nurture and cultivate. Donning crowns and sashes, refining the essence, they do not lose their constancy. Thus heaven and earth endure forever, and this is the wondrous Way of transmutation, beyond all recording.\n\nThose who study the true should each follow their season, cultivating and visualizing the host of perfected beings, all according to the method of the Primordial Beginning’s August Elder of the Above. Within eight years, without losing the seasonal nodes, they shall surely cause the perfected to descend, behold the divine forms with their own eyes, and by following the qi’s transformations, ascend and fly into the Great Void.\n\nIn practicing the Way of the Four Transmutations, one should follow the season and ingest the Four Transmutations’ talismans.\n\nFor instance, in the three spring months, when practicing the Way and visualizing, one should first ingest the Talisman of Eastern Brightness Communicating with the True and Transmuting the Yang Radiance...\n\nIn the three summer months of practice, one should ingest the Talisman of Southern Radiance Eightfold Refinement and Fourfold Clarity of Cinnabar Radiance. In the three autumn months of practice, one should ingest the Talisman of Western Essence Vast Numinosity Transforming Radiance and Supporting the Rare. In the three winter months of practice, one should ingest the Talisman of Northern Mystery Profound True Refinement of Radiance and Whispering Wind.\n\nIf practicing the Way of the Yellow Emperor, one should ingest the Talisman of the Yellow Above Eight Directions Generating Radiance and Jade Gate during the seasonal transition months.\n\nThis is the Primordial Beginning’s transmutation and conjoining of the true to ascend the Dao. Those who practice it shall communicate with the celestial qi, summon spirits to attain immortality, cause divine countenances to descend in winding paths, and reflect them within their chambers. It regulates the practitioner’s form, harmonizes the qi of the Four Brahmā Realms, illuminates the Five Palaces, opens the gates to receive the true, and settles the spirits within the Jade Treasury. Following the seasonal nodes, it binds the immortals, harmonizes yin and yang below, orders the portals of observation, and revolves heaven and earth, encompassing the eight directions.\n\nIts scriptures are lofty and wondrous, the foundation of divine immortals. Those who know its method shall sit and behold the true numina, capable of transmutation and transformation, refining their forms in accord with the seasons. With the myriad spirits at peace and complete, they shall ascend and fly into the Upper Clarity. If kept secret, the spirits descend; if divulged, calamity befalls.\n\n**Talisman of Eastern Brightness Communicating with the True and Transmuting the Yang Radiance**\nIn the three spring months of practice, when visualizing the spirits and summoning the numinous, one should inscribe it in black upon blue paper, face east to ingest it, and after a hundred days, attain communion with the numinous. After a thousand days, one shall see the spirits; after thorough vision of ten thousand li, one shall sit and behold the natural. It commands nine Jade Maidens of the Azure True, who bring the treasure scriptures of the Azure Palace and the true writings of divine immortals.\n\nAlternatively, inscribe it in blue upon yellow silk and place it to the east of one’s seat or bed. Clad in azure brocade for a hundred days, the Azure Elder shall descend to one’s side, and the divine officials of the Azure Emperor shall attend with sacred writings, shielding the practitioner’s body. After nine years, one shall naturally attain the azure clouds of radiance, which shall bear one aloft in flight.\n\nThis is what is meant by \"through essence, one senses the descent of spirits, and sits to attain flying immortality.\" Its script is the essence of the Eastern Azure Radiance of Yang Brilliance, Opening Clarity and Communicating Light. Its qi is the primordial radiance of the Nine Origins, whose brilliance illumines the eastern heavens, flourishing in ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine myriad layers. Its essence whirls in verdant clarity, while azure clouds billow in the Great Void. Resplendent splendor shines upon the Nine Mysteries, flowing nectar beyond the groves of fine herbs, and jade springs pour into abysses of ten thousand fathoms. Within the groves dwell flocks of azure fowl, and in the abysses reside the divine kings of the Yang Valley. Above lies the Abode of Primordial Azure, and within stands the Palace of Azure Splendor. The abode contains the palaces of the Nine Qi Primordial Elders, where the Azure True Sage Sovereign is attended on the left by Jade Maidens of the Azure Waist and on the right by Azure-Feathered Numinous Lads. They ever ride the numinous beasts of Mount Tai, driving and guiding the Nine-Light Divine Dragons. In the third month of spring, they ascend to guide the qi of the Nine Heavens and descend to draw forth the source and flow of the Liver Palace. When the two qi intersect in resonance, transmutation occurs in an instant.\n\nThus, qi is congealed to form the talisman’s name, and essence is concentrated to form its script. By swallowing its qi, one may instantly behold the divine forms; by consuming its essence, one may transform and enter the Nine Heavens. This is the wondrous numinous transmutation—majestic and boundless in the Great Void, gathering myriad marvels too vast to record in full.\n\n**Talisman of Southern Radiance Eightfold Refinement and Fourfold Clarity of Cinnabar Radiance**\nIn the three summer months of practice, when visualizing the spirits and summoning the numinous, one should inscribe it in blue upon red paper, face south to ingest it, and after a hundred days, attain communion with the numinous. After a thousand days, one shall see the spirits; after ten thousand days, attain flying immortality. It commands eight Jade Maidens of the Great Cinnabar, who bring the cinnabar chapters of ascending immortality with flowing gold and fire bells.\n\nAlternatively, inscribe it in red upon white silk and place it to the south of one’s seat or bed. Clad in red brocade for a hundred days, the Vermilion Elder shall descend to one’s chamber, and the divine officials of the Red Emperor shall attend with sacred writings, shielding the practitioner’s body. After eight years, one shall attain the vermilion clouds of radiance, which shall bear one aloft in flight to ascend the Palace of Cavernous Yang.\n\nIts script is the essence of the Southern Cavernous Radiance of Eightfold Refinement and Fourfold Clarity. Its qi is the primordial radiance of the Eight Heavens’ emanation, whose brilliance shines resplendently, illuminating the eight directions beyond. Its radiance flows and scatters like swift lightning across eighty-eight thousand eight hundred eighty-eight myriad layers. Its essence flames in cinnabar splendor, its light blazing and towering like auspicious clouds billowing in the court of the Great Yang. Jade nectar surges abundantly beyond the flowing fires, where dwell the deathless ones. Above stands the Terrace of the Southern Culmen, and within lies the Palace of Cavernous Yang. The terrace contains the abodes of the Lords of Immortality and the Directors of Destiny, where the Upper Perfected of Great Harmony is attended on the right by Jade Maidens of the Great Cinnabar and on the left by Azure-Round Numinous Lads. They ever gather the beasts of Mount Huo and guide the nine-colored phoenixes. In the third month of summer, they ascend to guide the qi of the Nine Heavens and descend to draw forth the bright beams of the Crimson Palace. When the two qi intersect in resonant transmutation, numinous transformation arises from the faintest glimmer.\n\nThus, essence is concentrated to form the script, and qi is congealed to form the stars. By swallowing its qi, one causes the numinous lords to descend to one’s chamber; by consuming its essence, one may fly through the Eight Voids, command the Six Jia, and summon the Six Ding. This is the wondrous Way of transmutation, elevating one’s rank to the Highest Clarity.\n\n**Talisman of Western Essence Vast Numinosity Transforming Radiance and Supporting the Rare**\nIn the three autumn months of practice, when visualizing the spirits and summoning the numinous, one should inscribe it in yellow upon white paper, face west to ingest it, and after a hundred days, attain communion with the numinous. After a thousand days, one shall see the spirits, and the perfected shall descend to meet one’s countenance. It commands six Jade Maidens of the Great Simplicity, who bring the golden essence, solar radiance, and refined mushroom herbs.\n\nAlternatively, inscribe it in white upon blue silk and place it to the west of one’s seat or bed. Clad in white brocade for a hundred days, the White Elder shall descend to one’s side, and the divine officials of the White Emperor shall attend with sacred writings, shielding the practitioner’s body. After six years, one shall attain the Three Simplicities’ cloud chariot, which shall descend to bear one aloft, ascending in form to the Great Void and flying into the Jade Clarity.\n\nIts script is the essence of the Western Vast Numinosity Cavernous Refinement Supporting the Emperor’s Golden Soul and White Gate. Its qi is the primordial radiance of the Six Evolutions’ golden illumination, whose brilliance shines resplendently, illuminating the western lands. It flows and spreads in sixty-six thousand six hundred sixty-six myriad layers. Its essence gleams purely like jade, its light blazing and towering, vast and boundless—above without color, below without abyss. Vast and indistinct, it resembles the layered mists of white clouds, resplendent in...\n\nAbove the Cavernous Void’s Golden Gate, the flowing nectar pours into the Smelting Refinement Courtyard. Within this courtyard lies the Pool of Returning Countenance, where immortal lingzhi blossoms are refined. At the Golden Gate stands the Azure-Gold Elixir Terrace, upon which rises the Dragon Mountain’s divine tower. At its center lies the Palace of Primordial Numinosity, and within the tower are twelve Jade Immortal chambers. The Western Florescence Perfected One attends on the left, accompanied by the Primordial Numinosity Jade Maiden, while the Golden Florescence Youth guards on the right. They ever ride the numinous beasts of Mount Hua, driving the White Tiger King. In the third month of autumn, they ascend to guide the qi of the Nine Heavens and descend to draw forth the true essence within the Lung Palace. The two qi respond and transform in mutual convergence, giving rise to life at the Western Pass. Thus, congealing essence forms talismans, and binding qi forms spirits. One who swallows this qi shall instantly summon the divine countenance; one who consumes its essence shall ascend through the Golden Gate, command the Five Peaks, summon the Ten Directions, summon clouds and dragons, and follow their will. Its script is lofty and wondrous, beyond all praise.\n\nThe Northern Mystery’s Dark Refinement Radiant Whirlwind Talisman\nIn the third month of winter, perform the Dao and meditate upon the spirits to summon the numinous. Inscribe in black upon white paper, face north while ingesting it. After a hundred days, one shall attain spiritual communion; after a thousand days, one shall behold the true. Perceiving the subtle and unseen, one shall converse face-to-face with the divine, command the Five Supreme Mystery Jade Maidens, and summon the Five Stars’ High Consorts, the Lady Immortals, and the Numinous Perfected Ones to ascend the Central Mystery’s Chart of Divine Immortals and Treasured Script. Inscribe in black upon crimson silk and place it at the northern side of one’s seat or bed. After a hundred days clad in dark brocade, the Black Emperor shall descend to one’s mat, and the Black Emperor’s divine officials shall attend with protective talismanic script, shielding the practitioner’s body. After five years, the Dark Clouds shall descend to cover one’s form, ascending into the Great Void and flying to the center of the Northern Asterism.\n\nIts script is the essence of the Northern Mystery’s Dark Profundity Whirlwind Florescence Dawn. Its qi is the primordial radiance of the inception of yin and yang, its brilliance chaotic, now merging, now parting. Five-colored and mysteriously luminous, it illumines the Dark Solitary Heavens, flowing and spreading in fifty-five thousand five hundred myriad layers. Its essence is profoundly obscure yet mutually conjoined, resembling layered brocade clouds, merging with golden blossoms yet without glare, engendering the Five Phases and establishing the Mystery. Its divine transformations are manifest in the Northern Darkness’s wilds, its true nectar flowing into the Frigid Waters’ realm. In the Northern Darkness grows the refined immortal jade cream; in the Frigid Waters resides the Demon-Quelling King. Above is the Seven Dawns’ Florid Canopy; at its center lies the Hall of Vast Numinosity. The Florid Canopy shades the Dark Dipper’s True Chamber, where the August Jade Dawn attends on the right with the Supreme Mystery Jade Maiden and on the left with the Jade Dawn Youth. They ever ride the numinous beasts of Mount Chang, driving the Flying Tortoise’s purple wheels. In the third month of winter, they ascend to guide the qi of the Nine Heavens and descend to draw forth the flowing springs of the Kidney Palace. The two qi converge in divine communion, giving rise to transformations within a ten-day cycle. Thus, congealing essence forms scripture, and binding qi refines immortality. One who swallows this qi shall summon the Seven Dawns to descend to their chamber, gazing upon the divine countenance. One who consumes its essence shall reverse the transformations of yin and yang, summon clouds and dragons, ascend the Florid Hall, and witness the wondrous transformations of the divine script—the primordial origin of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Yellow Center’s Eight Directions Life-Radiance Jade Gate Talisman\nDuring the four seasons, perform the Dao and summon the numinous. Inscribe in red upon yellow paper, face the Seasonal King while ingesting it. After a hundred and twenty days, one shall attain spiritual communion and penetrating vision, foreknowing fortune and misfortune. After a thousand days, the Heavenly Perfected shall descend, and one shall converse face-to-face with the divine, command the Twelve Yellow Simplicity Jade Maidens, and summon the Yellow Center’s Eight Dao Intersecting True Mystery Record, the Flying Immortal’s Phoenix Robe, and the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Chapters. Inscribe in yellow upon black silk and place it at the center of one’s seat or bed. After a hundred days clad in yellow brocade, the Yellow Elder shall visit one’s chamber, and the Yellow Emperor’s divine officials shall attend with protective talismanic script, shielding the practitioner’s body. After twelve years, the Yellow Clouds shall descend to cover one’s form, and a jade chariot with feathered wheels shall ascend one to fly into the Supreme Mystery’s Palace.\n\nIts script is the essence of the Central Yellow Center’s Earth Mother Jade Gate Life-Radiance Illuminating Clarity. Its qi is the primordial radiance of the Heaven and Earth’s warp and weft, the twelve celestial stems’ transformations. Its brilliance illumines the Eight Directions; its mists swirl and scatter in all four directions. Its light shines resplendently, penetrating the Void, flourishing and guarding the Supreme Mystery’s capital. Its layers number twelve hundred myriad myriad. Its splendorous radiance bursts forth in the Nine Mysteries; its flowing essence overflows into the Four Seasons’ realm. Above is the Jade Capital’s mansion; at its center lies the Florid Canopy’s palace. Within the mansion are the Supreme Dao Lord’s chambers, where the Jade Dawn Sovereign attends on the left with the Flying Immortal’s Feathered Staff Azure Florescence Jade Maiden and on the right with the Golden Numinosity Divine Youth, Leading Immortal. They ever ride the Nine-Titled Numinous Beasts, driving the Supreme Mystery’s Yellow Dragon. They govern the Five Qi to assist the celestial stems, commanding the Twelve Celestial Hooks. They ascend to guide the source and flow of the Nine Heavens and descend to draw forth the Yellow Spirit of the Spleen Palace. The two qi converge above the Muddy Pellet, refining and blending within the Three Elixir Chambers. Thus, congealing essence transforms the spirit, and binding qi refines immortality. One who swallows this qi shall summon the Yellow Elder to descend in form; one who consumes its essence shall emit a diamond hue, their body generating water and fire, their neck crowned with a halo of light. Myriad wonders shall transform, and one shall ascend into the Great Void—such is the wondrous efficacy of this numinous script, its lofty transformations beyond measure.\n\nThese Five Elders’ secret scriptures are concealed within the Nine Heavens’ Five Numinous Jade Capitals’ Golden Florescence Purple Chambers, attended by the Five Emperors’ Numinous Youths and the Five Emperors’ Jade Florescence Jade Maidens, fifty each, who burn incense, scatter flowers, and guard the divine script. According to the Nine Heavens’ ancient statutes, they are transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas, all bestowed upon the Perfected Immortals to become True Ones. Should any of the Mysterious Simplicity’s Imperial Charts, inscribed with the Three Clarities’ characters, be destined for later sages, they shall behold the numinous scrolls, cultivate and transform, meditate upon and invoke the spirits, and ingest the jade script. Within nine years, they shall summon the Five Elders to descend to their chamber, converse face-to-face with the Heavenly Perfected, penetrate the unseen and void, sit and stand without substance, transform water and fire, and ascend at dawn in broad daylight. To lightly divulge or profane these teachings shall bring calamity upon the Seven Mysteries, forfeit one’s own life, and consign one to eternal oblivion in the River Source.\n\nWhen ingesting the talisman, one must face the sovereign of the season and strike the teeth twelve times, then softly intone the prayer:\n\n*\"The heavenly wheel turns, the earth revolves,\nFour seasons merge with the True,\nFive phases guide and refine,\nCongealing into Jade Immortals.\nThe Upper Origin congeals essence,\nThe Middle Origin transforms spirit,\nThe Lower Origin nurtures and nourishes,\nDistant form returns to the True.\nThe Three Origins blend as one,\nI receive the natural endowment.\nThe numinous talisman fills and guards,\nThe sovereign qi billows like mist.\nWithin bright, without resplendent,\nThe infant rests in peace,\nDescending flying auroras,\nAscending into the imperial terrace.\"*\n\nUpon completion, swallow the qi five times and cease.\n\nThe method for transmitting the Great Register follows the *Bright Statutes of the Four Poles*: within seven hundred years, three transmissions are permitted; within a hundred years, if a worthy recipient appears, a second transmission is allowed. Master and disciple must face each other in purification for a hundred days, or seventy days. The disciple presents nine taels of refined gold, forty-seven feet of crimson brocade from the cinnabar earth, twenty-two feet of blue cloth, one golden dragon, and one jade fish. Facing north at the altar, they invoke the Nine Heavens to transmit the scripture, while the disciple bares his heart to heaven to receive it. Should the master transmit without regard to the time limit, he shall suffer the trial of the wind-blade. Should the disciple seek the True without sincerity, thus belittling the celestial treasure, his wealth and body shall sink into the River Source, and he shall never attain immortality. The celestial statutes warn to be prudent—clearly and carefully observe these precepts.\n\n---\n\nThe Nine Perfected of the Eightfold Mystery of the Mystic Capital of the Nine Heavens roamed the void, their numinous feet transcending the Jade Hall. Their radiance floated upon the Purple Clarity of the Great Mystery, as the Jade Emperor sported amidst the Nine Phoenixes’ dragon chariot and jade carriage, riding five-colored flying clouds, followed by twelve dragon-drawn chariots. Twenty-four celestial officials and jade maidens accompanied them, along with eight simurghs and white cranes, nine phoenixes soaring and singing in cloud formations, nine-colored standards, ten tasseled banners, three celestial treasure canopies, and nine heavenly mounts flying through the vast sky, arriving directly at the Five Marchmounts and renowned mountains. There, they met with the True Lords of the Five Marchmounts and together declared their intent to visit the Eightfold Radiance Grotto within the cavern-chamber of Tortoise Mountain, where they would meet with the Perfected of the Jade Emperor of the Most High in the golden hall of the grotto. With jade rings, they swore oaths to heaven, obtaining the right to transcribe the grotto scriptures and inscribe their names in the celestial records. The jade characters were engraved upon golden tablets, pledging the mysterious words.\n\nThe *Luminous Writ of the Great Empyrean*, the flying splendor of sun and moon, the radiant ornaments of the sun’s chariot, and the dark mushrooms of the mysterious—all were consumed by the Nine Mothers and the True Lord Consorts of the Five Emperors, who descended together. In a single day and night upon the terrace of Tortoise Mountain, the great sages and true officials of the ten directions, heaven and earth, sun and moon gathered, spreading golden couches and azure mats to convene the assembly of celestial sages. Again, they performed the hundred arts of cloud music, praising the natural emptiness of the void, harmonizing a hundred tones. Their long chants and oath-songs soared into the Nine Empyreans, ascending in response to the Heavenly King and the Lord Emperor of Jade Capital.\n\nUpon the completion of one cycle of the numinous hymn, the immortal officials, soldiers, and cavalry of Tortoise Mountain—numbering a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders—along with the Perfected, the Merit Officers, the Flying Generals, the Direct Talisman Clerks, the Jade Lads, the Divine Maidens, and the envoys and officials of the Nine Heavens, totaling nine hundred million myriad beings, obtained the True Talismans of the Nine Heavens, the celestial writings in jade script, and the melodies of the Twelve Phoenixes’ mysterious songs. These were divided into two scrolls, the upper and the lower, stored upon a golden terrace within the Purple Chamber of the Nine Heavens, wrapped in brocade and sealed in a golden casket, locked with silver bolts in a jade chamber. The transmission was commanded to the Lady of Purple Tenuity, who was to bring them forth.\n\nOn the day of their unveiling, a pure wind swept through the forests, and the Threefold Simplicity’s clouds illuminated the ten directions. Divine radiance and mysterious brilliance suffused the chamber of the golden terrace. Thereupon, the Lady of Purple Tenuity knelt to receive them, while the True Demons and Kings of the Nine Heavens rejoiced and prostrated in homage.\n\nThe *Orthodox Writ of the Nine Heavens* of the Great Clarity’s Mysterious Elder, the *True Jade Emperor of the Cavern-Real and Spontaneous Emptiness*, was expounded within the grotto-chamber of the Jade Capital’s Flowery Mountain, amidst the rosy clouds and kingfisher plumes. At that time, forty million myriad golden lads and ninety million myriad jade maidens attended to his left and right. The grotto-chamber was spread with yellow gold, its couches of white silver, and when the Heavenly Worthy descended, the mats were of yellow and dark cloud brocade. The divine kings and immortals entreated, kneeling long to inquire of the Mysterious Emperor of the Nine Heavens:\n\n*\"We humbly hear that the Most High and the myriad sages, the Great Emperors, the jade hymns of the mysterious songs, the radiant splendor of cinnabar flowers, the soaring kingfisher phoenixes, and the dragon-drawn chariots journeyed afar to the capital of the Flowery Emperor. Together, they chanted the Nine Shao and the numinous hymns of Great Harmony, inscribing the cavern-real true writ upon stone to proclaim the Upper Origin’s Great Mystery of Tortoise Mountain, harmonizing with the immortals of the Nine Heavens’ cavern-chambers. The True King of Jade Emptiness commanded the demonic and numinous banners to review the registers of the thirty-two heavens, the canons of sun and moon, where clouds travel and rain descends, moistening the world below. A hundred flowers burgeon together, jade trees with branches of green, blossoms of cinnabar, fragrant gardens and fruit groves, the seven treasures and threefold radiance.*\n\n*The Most High Heavenly Worthy, the Jade Lads of the Upper Clarity, the True Flower Jade Maidens, the Jeweled Chambers of Na Forest, transform and enlighten the multitudes. The lords of kingdoms and emperors, the Jade Lords of the Four Heavens, the Han Controllers and Han Lords, the myriad officials and immortal lords of the ten directions, the hundred demon kings of Human Radiance, soar through the empty void to transform and cover the multitudes. Flying jade cloud chariots, a thousand two hundred mysterious dragon-drawn carriages, thunder and lightning, their brilliance illuminating the ten directions, descend into our chamber, bowing and kneeling in praise and song. The incense and flowers of the myriad heavens, the hundred pipes harmonizing as one, the chiming of jade and the natural bells and chimes, the celestial processional music, the three luminaries of the seven treasures, the hundred harmonies—all delight and rejoice together.*\n\n*The demonic kings and deviant spirits of the Nine Heavens, the celestial emperors, all attend at the side. Flying cloud feathered canopies, twelve silk banners, standards and drums, arrayed before the Emperor, the myriad heavens chanting in unison, praising and reciting together.\"*\n\nThe Twelve Celestial Worthies and the host of perfected immortals and orthodox officials each recite the *Odes of the Cavernous Numinous and the Three Primes of the Jade Treasure*:\n\nThe swift canopy wheels with the returning wind,\nTen sages follow the Worthy in roaming.\nThe numinous odes harmonize with the divine banners,\nThe purple chariot floats upon the radiant qi.\nThe Celestial Worthies of the Great Clarity,\nTilt their carriages at the Jade Capital’s corner.\nThe host of immortals sport with celestial music,\nA hundred harmonies naturally encircle.\nTogether they rejoice, dancing amidst cloud blossoms,\nThe joy of the assembled perfected—who can fathom?\nThe jade tortoise within the Seven Treasures Grove,\nChants and praises, wishing to share the same vessel.\nThe cinnabar radiance illumines the essence of the sun,\nMaking my heart hesitate in wonder.\nThe immortals recite the Emperor’s odes—\nThis joy cannot be matched by mortal schemes.\nThe heavens chant in Brahmanic tones,\nFaintly soaring at the clouds’ edge.\nThe host of sages sing the *Cloud Melody*,\nJade maidens chant the *Mystic Joy*.\nTogether they wander the chambers of the Queen Mother,\nLingering by the Jasper Terrace’s balustrades.\nThe host of immortals, with jade-blossom forms,\nGleam resplendent as orchids and magnolias.\nThe Jade Pool rinses with pure springs,\nThe treasure groves of Kunlun Mountain shine.\nGracefully soar the fluttering dragon hosts,\nLuminously stands the Purple Phoenix Altar.\nAt dusk they wander Penglai Isle,\nAt dawn they face the banquet of radiant splendor.\nThe divine immortals sport in the eastern hall,\nTheir flowing brilliance entrusted to literary elegance.\n\nThe Nine Elders of the Upper Clarity, the *Cavernous Numinous* and *Innate Void* Perfected Merit Officers, emit the radiance of flying cinnabar blossoms. The Nine Elder Supreme Sage Lords, omens of numinous response, by the imperial resplendent *Prime Void* Jade Mountain’s canonical texts, in the first year of the Human Sovereign’s reign, the *shangjia* year, on the seventh day of the first month, at the Hall of the Seven Treasures Grove within the Chaos Terrace, the Three Prime Jade Emperor commanded the texts of the Nine Heavens to be conferred upon the Cinnabar Elder Nine Emperor Perfected Lords. None may summon the disorderly to mix and observe as one, nor claim them as perfected—all must adhere to the statutes and obey the command.\n\nThe Upper Clarity *Innate Void* *Numinous Flight* Upper Division Merit Officers and Sacred Treasure Perfected, one hundred thousand each.\nThe Upper Clarity *Innate Void* *Numinous Flight* Middle Division Merit Officers and Sacred Treasure Perfected, one hundred thousand each.\nThe Upper Clarity *Innate Void* *Numinous Flight* Lower Division Merit Officers and Sacred Treasure Perfected, one hundred thousand each.\nThe Upper Clarity *Innate Void*

Clarity *Innate Void* *Numinous Flight* Right Division Merit Officers and Sacred Treasure Perfected, one hundred thousand each.\nThe Upper Clarity *Innate Void* *Numinous Flight* Central Division

officials, soldiers, and sagely registers.\nThe Upper Palace’s Proper Position, Middle Prime Envoys, Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, Heavenly Perfected King Spirits Great Sages, *Eight Radiance* Three Divisions Generals, Merit Officers and Direct Talisman Clerks, Envoys and Flying Dragon Mounts, Three Primes Perfected Officials, Primordial Sovereign Jade Immortals—all in accordance with the mysterious statutes, let the disciple be diligent and cautious.\n\nAt that time, the Supreme Perfection Sovereign Lord, the Lord of the Realm and King of Kings, the Upper Sages leading the Perfected, and the Nine Heavens’ Celestial Emperors—naturally divine immortals with cinnabar radiance, sun-and-moon dragon scripts, the Eight Arts of Immortals, the *Mysterious Flight* of the Seven Luminaries, and jade registers—concealed within the earth the *Mysterious Cinnabar* and *Vermilion Writ* jade formulas. Could the Earthly Perfected’s phoenix scripts be attained?\n\nSince the separation of Heaven and Earth, the hundred poisons have spread, and all creatures—winged, crawling, and moving—along with immortals riding their mounts and the host of Perfected driving cloud chariots, have come to assemble at the imperial court. Hundreds and thousands of sagely Perfected stand guard over the numinous writs, while jade lads and maidens stand in attendance beside the true texts. Within the golden halls and jasper chambers, amidst the seven-jeweled floral groves by the emerald waters, they gather with the jade Perfected, the dragon kings, the celestial treasures and earthly spirits, the Eight Might and Nine Domains’ million-strong immortal officials. In their hands, they hold incense, flowers, banners, and canopies of nine hues and eight nodes, standing resplendent in the vast sky, their brilliance equal to the sun and moon. The hundred sounds flow in harmony, celestial maidens and immortal music fill the air, rare birds and strange beasts abound, a hundred million lions, giant serpents stretching a thousand fathoms—no darkness remains unilluminated, no distance left unlit. The ten directions are wholly radiant, as the flying Perfected tread the void, feasting in jade chambers, golden terraces aglow with precious light, and the eight delicacies laid before them.\n\nAscending the Cavern Tortoise Mountain to attain immortality, they sup on jasper mushrooms at dawn and rinse with jade springs at dusk, all coming to assemble here. The Twelve Mystic Dragons, purple phoenixes and cloud-serpents, divine birds and sagely *luan*-spirits, cinnabar carriages and feathered canopies of true mounts, the many gods’ resplendent nine-hued radiance, the Five Perfected of Jade Capital, the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, Kunlun’s famed mountains, the dragon spirits of rivers and seas—all the sagely hosts of Perfected and immortals, ten million times nine thousand eight hundred ranks, the cloud spirits of the *Purple Void* and Upper Cinnabar Lords, descend with the spirit officials to meet me.\n\nFirst, the invocation to the Supreme Perfection of the Nine Heavens, the Nine Elders of the *Purple Void* Immortal Capital, the hundred thousand myriad venerable Perfected and sagely immortals, the *Eight Radiance* August Spirits, the natural and the void, illumining the sun, moon, and subtle mysteries.\n\nAt that time, the celestial officials spoke this eulogy:\n\nClouds and purple grace the Upper Numinous Palace,\nNaturally a hundred immortal lads.\nLiterary radiance mirrors sun and moon,\nThe Nine Elders’ splendor everlasting.\nLunar blossoms gleam in the Three Yang,\nManifesting this union of the Four Vastnesses.\nResplendent, the host of immortals roam,\nInfinitesimal, they ascend the Upper Palace.\nHalting their chariots at Penglai’s ridge,\nThey lead companions to climb the lofty peaks.\nSun and moon illuminate the immortal capital,\nWhere they sport with the Queen Mother’s wall.\nA lifetime transcends the mundane dust—\nWho can fathom this realm?\nAt dawn they soar to the Sun Observation,\nAt dusk they rest in secluded Langfeng.\nThe immortals lead their companions,\nBright and dim, naturally harmonious.\nJade maidens ride sagely phoenixes,\nDivine immortals mount true dragons,\nDrifting together in graceful flight,\nFeathered canopies solemn and reverent.\nThey summon me, Wang Qiao’s friend,\nTo join them soaring in the clouds.\nPurple clouds are my domain—\nWho in the mortal world shares this path?\nThe immortals sport amidst cloudscapes,\nCinnabar blossoms unfold in spring’s radiance.\nNone fail to sing this refrain,\nThe blessed Dao-ground of the Perfected.\nThe imperial chariot halts with cloud companions,\nDrifting, drifting, they soar freely.\nGazing beyond the Eight Extremities—\nWhose power sustains eternal existence?\nSun and moon share benevolence and wisdom,\nThe empty valley bids farewell to dawn’s light.\nTurning to the host of immortal lads—\nWho knows the measure of a century’s span?\nThe Ten Sages welcome the omen-body—\nExcellent! Do not forget.\nAddressing the worldly scholars,\nThese immortal lads are not for you.\nA thousand years flourish like morning blossoms,\nA hundred years bloom like evening’s splendor.\nThe host of Perfected roam Mount Taihua,\nThe immortals soar freely.\nTurning their radiance to sport at the Nine Doubts,\nAbove, they wander with the Supreme Perfection.\nInfinitesimal, the host of immortal scholars,\nPurple canopies tilt with gentle light.\nHalting their radiance to rest in harmonious dawn,\nThe divine phoenixes plot no schemes.\nSupreme harmony soars in Langfeng,\nAssembling at the ridge, their floral barges gleam.\nNine circuits share one vision—\nGazing back, none share this realm.\nInfinitesimal, the Supreme Unity’s palace,\nDrifting, drifting, the companions of the Nine Ridges.\nSun and moon gleam with floral radiance,\nTheir light illumines the true floating.\nSoaring *luan*-birds arrange the morning dawn—\nStrive on, seekers of the Upper Perfection!\nCountless kalpas differ in measure,\nA thousand years pass without blame.\nIlluminating meetings with divine lads,\nNine circuits follow nature’s course.\n\nTo the right: *One Mystic Dragon Riding Purple Clouds to Soar the Void and Chant Eulogies*, recorded.\n\nAnd these Eight Levels and Eight Gates, thus the incantation:\n\nClouds fly, Upper Sagely Ones,\nWho lead the Supreme Perfection Lord.\nRiding dragons, driving purple phoenixes,\nThey come to the Queen Mother’s palace.\nAt dawn they feast on jasper mushrooms and treasures,\nAt dusk they rinse with jade pool’s sweet wine.\nRoaming together at the Sun Observation,\nResting amidst secluded Langfeng.\nBowing below the Nine Doubts’ ridge,\nLooking up to the imperial center’s zenith.\nStepping calmly to ascend the Five Ridges,\nGuiding reins to follow nature’s end.\nIngesting and nourishing to cultivate longevity,\nA thousand years without end.\nYou possess the art of nurturing nature—\nCherish the void and preserve harmony.\n\nAt that time, another arrived at the Upper Palace, descending to the Numinous Mystery to bow before the Nine Elders and the Nine Heavens’ Upper Perfection officials. They inquired: The Lords of the Three Upper Heavens, the Perfected and Envoys, the Immortal Capital’s Chief Ministers, the silk brocades of mysterious yellow—then commanded the Immortal Capital’s Attendants to lead the jade lads and transformed immortal maidens to the upper seat, and again to proceed to the Mystery.\n\nIf the Nine Palaces command the Supreme Mystery Capital, then summon the *Bright Immortal* and *Supreme Perfection* venerable sagely officials, and command the Tortoise Immortal’s Cavern Chamber to inscribe the stone true writs, the Three Primes’ Perfected registers, the jade lads, Perfected immortals, and envoys. Command the true celestial sagely immortal officials, the Nine Elders and Upper Sages, to ascend in broad daylight, together roaming the *Purple Void*.\n\nWe prostrate to see the Upper Perfection immortal officials inscribing the stone numinous writs and jade characters, the natural cavern chapters of the Five Florals’ two eulogies. Their words:\n\nAbove, roaming the Five Ridges’ peaks,\nTogether soaring at Taihua’s observation.\nThe Three Elders chant jade chapters,\nThe Three Radiance cavern texts resplendent.\nAt dusk they recite the jade immortals’ verses,\nAt dawn they wander until morning’s end.\nA thousand years bid farewell to the host of immortals—\nWho through ten thousand generations can fathom the reckoning?\nInfinitesimal, the Five Florals’ earth,\nSerene, the Nine Yang’s Han.\nThe ridge’s heights host the immortals’ play,\nRadiant scenes, spring blossoms in full bloom.\nLeading me to roam the cloud peaks,\nMy heart awaits the divine dawn.\nLofty as a hundred blossoms’ clouds—\nWho knows the cloudscape’s clarity?\nWarm qi unfolds the cinnabar trees,\nGreen leaves reflect purple glory.\nAbove, I ascend the Five Peaks’ heights,\nBelow, I wander the Four Streams’ numina.\nWithin the Jade Sovereign’s cavern hearth,\nI behold the *Great Clarity* scriptures.\n\nThe Nine Elders’ Register of the Immortal Capital,\nHow sublime the jade-true texts!\nMay you preserve this longevity,\nA thousand years without decay.\n\nResplendent, the Nine Florals’ Dao,\nGazing up and down toward Yang City.\n\nInvocation:\nSpirits soaring, supreme sages,\nDivine hosts and perfected officials,\nThe Nine Elders in their natural state,\nThe cinnabar of Great Florescence’s truth,\nFeasting on the Five Fungi,\nBones sacred, spirit at peace,\nAscending the Five Peaks in strides,\nJoining the Shao dance in joy,\nBowing to the numinous immortals,\nGazing up in gratitude to cloud phoenixes,\nFifty years and more,\nSoaring and playing amid the clouds,\nRiding feathered chariots, dragon-drawn,\nRoaming among the Queen Mother’s courts,\nTen thousand kalpas in a single cycle,\nDeparting the valleys’ lingering,\nTreading upon purple clouds,\nSwept along by cloud officials.\n\nThe *Genuine Talisman of the Tortoise Mountain Cavern Texts of the Supreme*\nThose who ingest this talisman for nine years,\nClosing their eyes to meditate for a single day and night,\nShall behold the celestial immortals of the Nine Heavens,\nRiding dragons, driving dragons,\nSoaring through the Purple

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Primordial Transformations and Treasured Perfections: The Nine Numinous and Most Wondrous Mysterious Register of Mount Tortoise**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Primordial Transformations and Treasured Perfections: The Nine Numinous and Most Wondrous Mysterious Register of Mount Tortoise* (abbreviated as *The Mysterious Register of Mount Tortoise*).\n**Author:** Unknown, approximately dated to the Northern and Southern Dynasties period. A foundational scripture of the early Supreme Clarity (Shangqing) tradition. Three scrolls in length.\n\n**Source of Base Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity Tradition*, First Section.\n**Collated with:** Dunhuang manuscript P.3435 (fragmentary).\n\n---\n\n### *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Primordial Transformations and Treasured Perfections: The Nine Numinous and Most Wondrous Mysterious Register of Mount Tortoise, Scroll One*\n\nThe treasured scriptures of Supreme Clarity arose at the very inception of the Nine Heavens, born of spontaneity and coexisting with *qi*. The Three Radiant Ones shone in unison, manifesting above the Nine Heavens and within the Great Void. At times, they coalesced into soaring, mysterious purple *qi*, forming numinous texts—celestial writings of subtle wonder, their strokes sinuous and intricate, each character a full *zhang* in breadth, their depths beyond easy comprehension. None but the True Kings of the Nine Heavens could fathom their profound resonance.\n\nIn the first year of the *Above-Void* era, the True Kings of the Nine Heavens commanded the Supreme Perfected Ones of the Mysterious Capital to cast gold into tablets. The assembled sages, enlightened to the luminous meanings and the supreme oral transmissions, compiled the numinous chapters. The Jade Emperor inscribed the brushstrokes, engraving the tablets into scripture. Their postures and rhythms—whether rising or descending—followed a hierarchy of ranks and prohibitions, each category derived from the esoteric intentions of the exalted sages. These were sealed above the Nine Heavens, within the Jade Chambers of the Grand Existence Palace, guarded by the Jade Maidens of the Western Florescence and the Purple Lads of the Golden Dawn of the Primordial Numinous Palace.\n\nThe Mountain of the Western Tortoise, also called Dragon Mountain, serves as the root and pivot of the Nine Heavens, the abyssal repository of the myriad *qi*. Located at the northwest corner of the heavens, it spans four hundred thousand *li* in circumference, its height bordering the Jade Clarity Heaven. To the southeast, it connects with the rosy clouds of the *Through-Yang* realm, ascending to the Gate of the Divine Tiger of the Azure Palace. To the northwest, it intersects the wilds of the *Cold Cavern*, rising to the Court of the Immortals of the Golden Portal. To the south, it extends to the Crimson Floating-Ripple Land, its *qi* harmonizing with the radiance of the *Cavern-Yang*. To the north, it points toward the *Curved Array*, linking with the *Flourishing Canopy*, its *qi* treading the vast numinous expanse. At its center, it soars directly toward the Eightfold Crossroads of the Jade Capital atop the summit of the Intersecting Winds Mountain. Thirty thousand *li* of level heavens are encircled by walls of surging gold and gates of wrought jade, adorned with golden terraces, jade towers, and twelve divine palaces.\n\nAbove stand halls of naturally flowing essence, the Purple Portal and Golden Florescence Chambers, and chambers of jasper and jade, flanked by nine cavernous grottoes. Spontaneously arising purple clouds interweave with phoenix-script patterns, their nine hues cascading in array. Cliffs bear purple cassia, ridges flourish with jade groves, coral branches intertwine, and jade roots take hold. The *Kan* trees bear fruit, the *Red Children* and *White Rings* gleam, the *Three Florals* radiate blossoms upon the crimson radiance, and *reverse fragrance* flows through the *Great Mystery*. The eight *qi* fan the winds in ceaseless motion, jade flutes resound in the void to form celestial music. Dragons roar from cloud towers, phoenixes cry atop distant peaks. Venomous beasts gather in the thousands, serpents coil a thousand *xun* in length. Divine palaces stand majestic, cloud-borne immortals swarm in multitudes. The towering primordial halls brim with emanations of every kind—such are the wondrous transformations of the Primordial Beginning, the true numinous root of the Celestial Origin.\n\nWithin the Hall of the Golden Florescence, above the northern window, a spontaneously arising purple *qi* coalesces into mysterious script, each character a full *zhang* in breadth, its rays cascading in luminous splendor. The celestial writing is of subtle wonder, its depths beyond easy comprehension. In the first year of the *Shangjia* era, the Venerable of the Nine Heavens ascended to the Cloud Palace to perform the purification fast. Gazing upon the radiant scene of Mount Tortoise, he engraved golden tablets and transcribed the mysterious script, dispelling its long-standing obscurities and expounding its numinous resonance. It was recorded as *The Crimson Sovereign’s Flying Mystery and Purple Writ of Mount Tortoise*.\n\nOn the first *yin* day of the first month of the first year of the *Kaihuang* era, the Queen Mother of the West rode the void upon a numinous vessel, soaring through the Nine Empyreans. She purified herself upon Mount Tortoise and ascended the naturally flowing essence of the Purple Portal and Golden Florescence Jasper Hall. Wandering to the northern window, she paid homage to the mysterious script, gazing upon the cliffs in contemplation of the numinous and directing her thoughts toward the Supreme Perfected Ones. Thereupon, her wondrous perception awakened to the mystery, and her cinnabar heart revealed itself.\n\nSuddenly, a great celestial perfected one appeared, bearing the sun and moon, a halo encircling his neck, accompanied by a retinue of feather-canopied immortals. He arrived upon a flying chariot of purple clouds and ninefold luminous auroras, prostrating before the Queen Mother. He announced: \"I am the Perfected King Governing the Phoenix Palace of the Nine Heavens, surnamed *Supreme Mystery* and styled *Kaiming*. By the command of the Primordial Heavenly King, I have descended to bestow upon you the golden script of the Nine Heavens, the purple characters of the *Azure-Golden Crimson Sovereign’s Writ*.\" He conferred upon her the title *Supreme Perfected Mother of the Nine Numinous Ones of the Western Origin* and enfeoffed her as the sovereign of the Western Tortoise Peak. He further bestowed a plain scripture scroll, the *Primordial Record of the Supreme Perfected One’s Transformations at Birth*, which oversees the registers of immortals and upholds the lineage of the Jade Clarity.\n\nAdditionally, he presented a tablet of azure jasper and granted her the *Flying Azure Feather Robe of the Phoenix Garments of the Nine Heavens*, the *Morning Infant Jade Crown*, the *Phoenix-Cloud Sandals*, the *Divine Phoenix Purple Wheel Flying Feather Canopy* of twenty-four carriages, and the *Five-Colored Command Banners of the Numinous Standards*. He also assigned seven hundred Jade Maidens of the Upper Palace’s Golden Florescence to attend and protect the Perfected Mother. She was charged with governing the Jasper Hall of the Flowing Essence Purple Portal and Golden Florescence, ascending thrice monthly to the Jade Clarity, twice feasting upon Kunlun, and reviewing the multitudes of immortals every five assemblies.\n\nThereupon, the great celestial perfected one completed his mission and returned to his jade palace. The Perfected Mother, having received her mandate, ascended her throne and addressed the assembly in the Jasper Hall. She commanded her attendants, the Jade Maiden Wang Zideng and Dong Shuangcheng, to receive with reverence the golden script of the purple characters upon the azure jasper tablet, the *Azure-Golden Crimson Sovereign’s Conferral Writ*, the *Primordial Record of the Supreme Perfected One’s Transformations at Birth*, and the *Flying Mystery and Purple Writ*—four items in total—sealing them with the *Crimson Sovereign’s Seal* and entombing them within the Jasper Chamber. She appointed thirty Jade Maidens of the Golden Florescence and thirty Purple Lads of the Golden Dawn to guard the numinous script.\n\nFollowing the ancient statutes of the Three Heavens regarding postures and rhythms, she proclaimed to the Five Emperors, the Five Peaks, the numinous mountains, rivers, and seas, commanding their divine officials to submit the names of practitioners every five days, distinguishing merits and transgressions, and reporting them according to rank. The Perfected Mother customarily observes the eight solar terms, and every five days, she feasts in the Cloud Palace, traverses the Five Peaks, surveys the sources of the rivers, and roams the eight directions.",

      "translated_text": "At this moment, the Five Stars emerge in their stations, the sun and moon halt their radiance, the hundred yang forces surge like lightning, molten metal gleams with refined essence, the Heavenly Warriors march as vanguard, and the Five Elders bear the banners. The Perfected Mother customarily rides her nine-hued chariot of purple clouds and flying wheels, attended by five thousand Heavenly Immortals and Jade Maidens. The women ride phoenixes, the men spur dragons; the Flying Immortals in feathered robes all hold floral banners, their reed pipes and flutes resounding in harmonious chorus. The cries of simurghs and the calls of phoenixes echo through the cloud formations, while radiant lights intertwine, the Three Luminaries merge in brilliance. The Purple Lads waft incense to dispel impurities, the Divine Consorts scatter blossoms to bathe the Perfected; the celestial scales unfurl their canopies, purple mists veil the empty courtyard, jade light streams across the firmament, and numinous transformation commands the myriad spirits. At this time, the Six Heavens obey her command, all malevolent forces bind their forms, demonic perversities lose their sight, the heavens grow bright and the qi pure—such is the wondrous vision of the loftiest immortals, the luminous efficacy of the Crimson Sovereign’s cavern-spirit.\n\n*The Crimson Sovereign’s Flying Mystery Purple Text*\nFlying Mystery Purple Qi congeals the numinous root,\nThe net of Jade Void governs the myriad spirits.\nIn the emptiness, it billows and coalesces naturally,\nAbove stand twelve towering peaks,\nJade towers soaring high amid luminous clouds,\nFlowing essence and purple pavilions girded with golden portals,\nResplendent jasper halls encircling the Eight Transcendents,\nFrom their midst emerge the Nine Numinous Immortals of Azure Gold.\n\nThe Crimson Sovereign Perfected Mother is styled *Essence-Extension*,\nClad in flying azure feathered robes and a morning-infant crown,\nIn her left hand she holds the Jade Staff, in her right the Numinous Banner,\nCommanding the Five-Colored Demons to attend the August Honored One.\nShe grasps the talismanic registers at the Gate of Life,\nChewing the moon and sipping the sun, inhaling jade springs,\nThe Net of Separation emits its radiance to refine the five souls,\nInternally replete and externally overflowing, the Crimson Palace rejoices.\nGolden light shines resplendently, her form perfectly round,\nFrom the new moon she enters the Metal phase, her color murky and profound.\n\nOnly the Enlightened One understands these words:\nOn the fifth day of the fifth month, the essence of the Northern Prime appears,\nEngraved in sight is the Floral Canopy leading the Immortal Lords.\nPurple Qi revolves leftward with the Dipper’s motion,\nTraversing the twenty-eight lunar lodges to enter the Golden Gate.\n\nThis is when the Crimson Sovereign reviews the myriad immortals.\nThose who illuminate this secret with diligent devotion,\nClothing their forms and concentrating their thoughts to discern its divisions,\nShall perceive the wondrous vision and attain the essential text.\nAfter three years, they shall surely preserve their longevity,\nAfter nine years, they shall ascend the void and don feathered skirts,\nLightly soaring in phoenix robes to ascend Dragon Mountain,\nBowing and rising to pay homage to the Nine Numinous Ones and the Jade Dawn.\n\nThe Southern Culmen Supreme Prime Lord states: This is the text of *Congealed Purple Qi and Flying Mystery*, engraved upon the Western Tortoise Mountain, its flowing essence inscribed upon the northern window of the Purple Pavilion, Golden Florescence, and Jasper Hall. The Nine Heavens’ Venerable Elder titled this work *The Crimson Sovereign’s Flying Mystery Purple Text of Tortoise Mountain*. The Queen Mother of the West treasures and conceals it; its purport is profoundly recondite, all being the subtle rhythms of the Nine Heavens. Without an immortal name, one cannot approach its chapters. Those who obtain it are recorded in the Nine Heavens’ registers, their names inscribed upon Tortoise Mountain.\n\nThe Nine Heavens’ Venerable Elder says: Cultivate this Dao during the ten months of the year—namely, the first, second, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, eleventh, and twelfth months. On the third, fifth, ninth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of each month—five times monthly—purify yourself and recite the text once. After midnight, step into the central courtyard, gaze upward, and observe the Floral Canopy within the Northern Dipper, where Purple Cloud Qi revolves leftward from the Dipper’s net, traversing the twenty-eight lunar lodges before returning above the Golden Gate. If the sky is overcast and devoid of light, perform this inwardly within your chamber, visualizing the method as described. Upon completing the visualization, bow four times toward the Purple Cloud, click your teeth thrice, and raise your gaze to pray:\n\n“The night sky gleams clear, the hidden void reveals the Perfected,\nFlowing clouds linger, golden florescence guards the four quarters.\nThe Crimson Sovereign spreads its radiance, the numinous flies in purple chariots.\nThis evening, the azure gold bestows immortality,\nFulfilling my supreme aspiration, my body aligns with spontaneity.\nI bind my life to the moon’s essence, preserving the root of years and days.\nThe Three Numinous Ones merge in splendor, eternally abiding on Dragon Mountain.\nIn the secrecy of night, my devotion is unveiled—may it be as I have spoken.”\n\nConclude by drawing in Purple Qi twenty-eight times and swallowing it. Practicing this for three years, divine immortals shall manifest signs upon your sleeping mat. Your body shall be enveloped in Purple Qi, your form interwoven with its glow, and your name inscribed in the Nine Heavens’ registers—you shall surely ascend as an immortal.\n\nThe Nine Heavens’ Venerable Elder says: Though the celestial scriptures number in the thousands, each expounding its wonders, even this single practice suffices to summon numinous immortals to descend, to spread their wings across the Nine Empyreans, to soar through the Jade Clarity, and to roam and feast in the Cloud Palace. Were this not a wondrous method, the Queen Mother of the West would not have concealed it within her inner robe, nor would the Great Existence have left its prohibitions unspoken.\n\nThe Supreme Prime Lord of the Southern Culmen states: The heavens possess clouds of forbidden qi that encroach upon the divisions of the sun, moon, and Five Stars. In those regions and kingdoms, there are those who align with the Dao and attain immortality as lords. When such omens appear, their signs manifest of their own accord.\n\nThe Nine Heavens’ Venerable Elder says: Upon witnessing these clouds, perform the rites and prayers as prescribed, not merely on the appointed days. Apply diligent mindfulness, and when the clouds descend, you shall ascend to meet them. Seal this within your heart; do not lightly reveal it to others. If the Dao is divulged, its numinosity disperses, and immortals shall have no means to respond.\n\n*The Highest Primordial Bestows the Azure Gold Crimson Sovereign Jade Text upon the Queen Mother of the West*\nThe Supreme Primordial addresses the Numinous Nine Heavens and the Ancestral Void: The Queen Mother of the West, named *Graceful Robe*, is the essence of the Nine Numinous Qi of Heaven, the coalescence of the Western Metal’s spirit, the knotting of Purple Cloud’s embryonic bones, the refinement of the sun’s radiance, the inhalation and exhalation of the Seven Luminaries’ splendor. She harmonizes with the morning mist to feast upon the marrow of the Great Yang Phoenix, sips the moon’s essence and orchid brain, congeals within the jade root and golden treasury, binds her cinnabar form, and enfolds her purple heart. Her manifestation is revealed in the Crimson Sovereign’s wondrous chart, her rank exalted among the imperial chariots. She reposes upon the numinous peaks, her heart stilled in the upper clarity, her merits aiding the ten thousand kinds, her beneficence overflowing all life. Holding fast to her singular integrity, she endures through kalpas unending—thus the Highest Primordial bestows upon her the *Curved Florescence*.",

      "translated_text": "Lady Wanjin, by virtue of her golden perfection, is granted the title of \"Meditation Mistress of the Western Primordial Nine Numinous Supreme Realized Immortal Mother, Azure-Golden Cinnabar Sovereign.\" She is enfeoffed to govern Tortoise Mountain, overseeing the primordial registers. In accordance with celestial protocol, she receives the azure-jade tablets inscribed with golden script and jade characters, is bestowed the nine-heaven phoenix robes of flying azure plumes, the morning-infant jade crown and phoenix-cloud sandals, twenty-four divine phoenix purple-wheel flying feathered canopies, five-colored ritual banners and spirit-summoning staffs, flowing-gold fire-bells and night-glowing candles, demon-quelling jade talismans and nine-heaven celestial missives. To her defense are assigned seven hundred Jade Maidens of the Upper Palace and Western Florescence, who attend her at the Flowing Essence Purple Pavilion of Golden Florescence within Tortoise Mountain. Thrice monthly she ascends to the Jade Clarity, twice feasts upon Kunlun, and oversees the five assemblies of immortals, the five marchmounts, rivers and seas, and the ten directions’ numinous officials—none are beyond her governance, as fully set forth in the records.\n\nAll ritual protocols follow the ancient statutes of the Jade Terrace’s *Great Possession* and the Three Heavens’ orthodox scriptures. The azure-jade tablets inscribed with golden script and jade characters, along with the Azure-Golden Cinnabar Sovereign’s investiture texts, all derive from the celestial norms of the Great Possession Palace’s *Reciprocal Protocol*, composed in the spontaneously arisen chapters of the Highest Mystery’s Empty Cavern. These are conferred upon the palaces of the loftiest realized immortals and exalted sages, not upon neophytes.\n\nAs in the Golden Watchtower of the Eastern Florescence and other celestial palaces, there exist protocols for summoning neophytes and fledgling immortals—these too issue from the *Great Possession*’s norms, differing only in rank and dignity. Unless one’s name is recorded in the Nine Heavens or registered in the *Square Cauldron*, one shall never glimpse their contents. Those who do behold their texts are destined for rebirth upon inscribed tablets, their names inscribed in the imperial registers, and shall attain immortality—thus their destiny is foretold in the numinous statutes. On the day of Dao attainment, celestial perfected beings shall descend to receive their texts and investiture.\n\nThe Southern Culmen’s Upper Primordial Lord states: The golden script and jade characters are engraved upon azure-jade tablets, or inscribed upon green-jade tablets. Each tablet measures nine inches and nine fen in length, two inches and four fen in width, with characters threaded in gold. Two jade lads and two jade maidens attend each tablet, tending incense and overseeing transmission. According to the *Bright Statutes of the Four Poles*, if a qualified recipient exists within a century, a single transmission is permitted.\n\nThe Southern Culmen’s Upper Primordial Lord states: Azure-jade is not within the capacity of mundane persons to employ. If one’s name is recorded in the *Square Cauldron* and one beholds the texts, they may be engraved upon green-wood tablets, with characters threaded in gold, stored in azure-silk pouches. After nine years of burning incense and reverent worship, celestial perfected beings shall descend to bestow the azure-jade tablets.\n\nThe Southern Culmen’s Upper Primordial Lord states: The primordial registers of initial transformation and the nine *qi* of the primordial cavern coexist with birth. The Highest Jade Sovereign, supreme sage and imperial perfected, all coalesce the *qi* of the primordial cavern to form their names and titles. Their robes, crowns, and adornments all derive from the *Reciprocal Protocol* of the Nine Heavens’ *Great Possession*, while their dwelling places and village names arise spontaneously. Heaven possesses the *qi* of eight assemblies and the revolutions of four transformations, which, through the brazen canopy and jade emptiness, govern yin and yang, initiate the mysterious workings, and bring forth the ten thousand kinds. The transformations and luminous manifestations of the loftiest sages follow the four seasons’ governance, aligning with the revolutions and responding to destiny, advancing with transformation, without decline or aging, enduring eternally. Thus it is said: the Dao has no constant name—this is what is meant.\n\nAs the Queen Mother’s virtue repays the Highest Mystery, she is made the mother of the ten thousand *qi*. Thus the Primordial Beginning bestows upon her the title of Cinnabar Sovereign and confers a scroll of the *Primordial Register of Plain Script*, to be transmitted to later sages and immortals. Through it, they may know that the Dao of the Primordial Beginning coalesces spontaneously arisen names and possesses the *qi* of transformation. Those who behold its chapters shall have their names inscribed in reverse upon the immortal registers of the Nine Heavens, their names engraved upon the Cinnabar Terrace of the *Square Cauldron*. With focused contemplation, within nine years they shall attain union with the perfected, repose in chambers of countenance, and transform with the four seasons, soaring through the Nine Heavens.\n\nThe Southern Culmen’s Upper Primordial Lord states: The Dao of the Upper Clarity’s *Highest Mystery’s Precious Scriptures* relies upon visualization for resonance and swallowing *qi* for communion. Once one has accessed its chapters, one should clarify the visualizations of the Primordial Beginning’s transformations, discerning their forms, colors, luminous *qi*, and adornments as they change with the four seasons. Then, with eyes closed and without speech, one shall spontaneously arrive; swallowing *qi* without effort, one shall spontaneously commune. Thus, within ten days one shall behold the divine, and within ten months one’s *qi* shall be replete.\n\nLater learners and worthies may diligently refine their contemplation, thereby illuminating the mysterious emptiness and finding the path to immortality.\n\nThe Southern Culmen’s Upper Primordial Lord states: Those who cultivate the Dao of the loftiest immortals—visualizing deities, invoking the perfected, ingesting *qi*, and swallowing saliva—yet remain ignorant of the Primordial Beginning’s names, the four seasons’ transformations, and the root sources of luminous manifestations and *qi*, merely close their eyes in vast obscurity and swallow emptily without intent. How then shall the divine perfected descend? How shall *qi* and saliva be replenished? Gazing upon countenances, one perceives only dimness—how much more so in the boundless expanse, where forms and *qi* remain undiscerned. Such efforts are but vain labor in repose, profitless in empty chanting.\n\nThe *Primordial Register of Initial Transformation of the Upper Clarity*:\nThe Primordial Beginning’s August Supreme Elder, born of the primordial jade emptiness’s *qi*, bears the taboo name *Yanshiyin* and the style *Guanwujue*. His form measures ninety million *zhang* in height. During the three months of spring, he wears the nine-*qi* flowing-essence purple-radiance crown, robes of nine-light brocade, and a sash of nine-colored seamless spontaneous silk. Girded with the six-mountain fire-jade, he rides clouds of azure and deep green. When seated, he rests upon nine-colored lions, their brilliance resplendent in the Upper Clarity’s jade emptiness. When visualized, he returns to a height of nine inches and nine *fen*.\n\nDuring the three months of summer, the Primordial Beginning’s August Supreme Elder transforms into a single body with nine heads, measuring seven thousand *zhang* in height. He wears a nine-colored cloud crown, a robe of cinnabar brocade woven with boundless radiance, and a girdle of the nine great immortals’ refined swords. He rides clouds of cinnabar and purple, seated upon nine-colored dragons, their luminosity flowing and resplendent in the jade emptiness’s purple clouds.

After nine years of cultivation, one may behold the true spirit, ride the void in flight, and ascend to Jade Clarity.\n\nThe Dao-root of the Nine Heavens’ Primordial Father is the *qi* of the Primordial Grotto’s root. His secret name is Ninefold Numinous Guide, and his style is Primal Great Perfected. His form spans ninety million *zhang*.\n\nIn the three months of spring, he wears a crimson jade headband of seven measures, the Crown of the Treasure Heaven of the Boundless, and dons the Nine Heavens’ Phoenix Robe and Divine Cloud Phoenix Sandals. Girded with the embroidered Sash of Plain Numinosity, he ever rides the Azure Mist Flying Chariot, attended by twelve flying dragons. When seated, nine-colored radiant light emanates from him, high above Jade Clarity, his brilliance shifting a hundredfold to illuminate the vast firmament. In meditation, his form extends to nine *cun*.\n\nIn the three months of summer, the Primordial Father transforms into a single body with nine heads, each crowned with a sun. Clad in a tiger-fur robe adorned with red phoenix patterns and girded with twelve-colored ribbons, he rides a nine-hued phoenix. When seated, he rests upon the yellow and white *qi*, his luminosity blazing through the void, illuminating Jade Clarity’s depths. In meditation, one reverts to his true form.\n\nIn the three months of autumn, the Primordial Father divides into nine figures, all identically robed in nine-colored feathered gowns. Each bears the Dragon Abyss Sword at his waist, a tiger-headed pouch, and the intertwined Sash of Plain Numinosity. Seated upon the nine *qi* of the Dark Void, their radiance shifts and gleams, illuminating the subtle intricacies of Jade Clarity’s Grotto Root. In meditation, one reverts to his true form.\n\nIn the three months of winter, the Primordial Father transforms into the radiance of solar essence, intermingling with the purple brilliance. This is the Primordial Father’s reverted form of the Dao-root’s *qi*, further refined into the essence of the Grotto Root. United with the Mysterious Mother, they merge into the dual lights of primordial chaos. In meditation, one reverts to his true form.\n\nTo practice the Way of the Primordial Father, on the day of the Grand Year Star, bathe, purify, and enter the chamber. Facing northwest, prostrate nine times to the Nine Heavens’ Primordial Father. Then, turn north, sit upright, close your eyes, and visualize the Nine Heavens’ Father in his seasonal forms above the Nine Heavens, within the Jade Treasure Precinct of the Supreme Ultimate’s Jeweled Palace, the Cinnabar Numinosity Precinct of the Grotto Primordial Settlement. Let the true light descend and reflect into the adept’s Upper Primordial Kunlun. Softly intone the incantation:\n\n*\"Exalted Lord of the Highest,\nPrimordial Great Spirit,\nUniting true *qi* to rectify the form,\nYour splendor graces the Purple Heavens.\nRiding clouds, driving the floating,\nInterlacing radiance with the eight mists,\nTurning the wheel in sinuous descent,\nYour Dao shades my body.\nGrant me the cloud carriage,\nTo attend the numinous axle.\nToday at the Eight Assemblies,\nI humbly present my supreme wishes.\nAll I seek, all I beg,\nShall be as your grace decrees.\nEver abiding in primal fortune,\nAbiding with the Emperor,\nWhip in hand, riding the eight luminaries,\nI fly into the Jade Dawn.\"*\n\nUpon completion, gaze upward and swallow nine breaths to conclude.\n\nAfter nine years of practice, one may witness his true form. The Primordial Father descends to your side, converses with you, and bestows the precious scripture, the Nine Heavens’ Upper Register, inscribed on jade tablets. Your body ascends to Upper Clarity.\n\nTo recklessly divulge this Way is to consign oneself to the offices of the ghostly bureaucracy, bringing calamity upon seven generations, who shall forever toil in the River’s source.\n\nThe Dao-apex of the Nine Heavens’ Mysterious Mother is the *qi* of the Grotto Abyss. Her secret name is Bearing Chaos, and her style is Yellow Great Cover. Her form spans seventy million *zhang*.\n\nIn the three months of autumn, she wears the Purple Primordial Dark-Yellow Treasure Crown and dons the Frosty Gauze Robe of Nine Colors, woven with luminous green spirit-light brocade. Adorned with twelve-colored intertwined ribbons of numinous purple, she ever rides the Purple Cloud Flying Wheel, attended by twelve phoenixes and thirty-six immortals. When seated, she rests upon nine-colored lions, her radiance flowing and gleaming high above Upper Clarity. In meditation, her form extends to six *cun* and six *fen*.\n\nIn the three months of winter, the Mysterious Mother transforms into a human-headed crow-mouthed figure, her beak holding the essence of the moon. Clad in a flying gauze robe of green essence, girded with flowing tassels and the purple sash, she ever rides twelve-colored clouds. When seated, her hundredfold radiance illuminates the subtle intricacies of Upper Clarity. In meditation, one reverts to her true form.\n\nIn the three months of spring, the Mysterious Mother transforms into a phoenix-bodied, unicorn-headed figure, her seven-colored splendor adorned with twelve radiant lights, their luminous essence interlacing to illuminate the subtle intricacies of Upper Clarity’s eightfold obscurity. In meditation, one reverts to her true form.\n\nIn the three months of summer, the Mysterious Mother transforms into the dual radiance of purple and yellow, like the moon’s brilliance, its five colors flowing and gleaming to illuminate Upper Clarity. This is the Mysterious Mother’s reverted form of the Grotto Primordial’s *qi*, further refined into the essence of the Nine Yin’s Dao-apex. United as the Feminine One, she rejoices in harmony, giving birth to the myriad spirits. In meditation, one reverts to her true form. After nine years, the Primordial Father presents the register in Nanyang, while the Mysterious Mother descends in the Cinnabar Chamber.\n\nTo practice the Way of the Mysterious Mother, on the day of one’s life-destiny, bathe, purify, and enter the chamber. Facing southeast, prostrate nine times to the Mysterious Mother. Then, turn north, sit upright, and knock the teeth nine times. Close your eyes and visualize the Nine Heavens’ Mysterious Mother in her seasonal forms above the Nine Heavens, within the Jeweled Forest’s Sevenfold Radiance Palace, the Jade Treasure Precinct of the Grotto Primordial’s Ninefold Brilliance Settlement. Let the true light descend and reflect into the adept’s Gate of Life below the navel, within the Cinnabar Field Palace. Softly intone the incantation:\n\n*\"Triple union, quintuple separation,\nPrimal chaos merging the dual origins.\n*Qi* congeals to form spirit,\nSpirit transforms to unite the hun-soul.\nThe Feminine One embraces the true,\nEmbryonic breathing births the gate.\nYin essence darkly descends,\nWashing and irrigating the wellspring of form.\nRefining and transforming luminous radiance,\nNuminous splendor arises naturally.\nToday I humbly present my plea,\nMysterious Mother, reveal your grace.\nTwelve supreme wishes,\nPreserve and perfect the Jade Perfected.\nFive forms receive the effulgence,\nBones refined into jade immortals.\nLightened body, soaring flight,\nRiding the void, interlacing mists,\nAscending to the Purple Ultimate,\nTo attend and behold the divine countenance.\"*\n\nUpon completion, gaze upward and swallow twenty-seven breaths to conclude.\n\nAfter nine years of practice, the Mysterious Mother is moved to joy, as the dual radiance harmonizes. The Northern Emperor is stirred to erase one’s name from the register of death, and the Nine Heavens’ Record of the Purple Scroll is bestowed. One may behold her true form and ascend to Upper Clarity in flight.\n\nTo recklessly divulge this Way is to die and be consigned to the River’s source, with seven generations bearing servitude, enduring ten sufferings and eight hardships—blade mountains, sword trees—through ten thousand kalpas without reprieve. Those who obtain it must treasure its secrecy, for they shall naturally attain immortality.",

Only those of wondrous and transcendent quality, whose names are inscribed in the Nine Heavens, may partake in its knowledge. Whoever beholds this text shall have a lifespan equal to a kalpa. After nine years of cultivation, one ascends and flies to the Highest Clarity.

Forever I enjoy boundless grace, soaring into the Great Void, light as a feather in flight, ascending into the Upper Palace.\n\nThis done, look upward and swallow ten breaths to conclude.\n\nThis is the Supreme Way of Mysterious Quiescence, concealed within the Purple Chamber of the Six Harmonies of the Most High. According to the statutes, it emerges but once in ten thousand kalpas, secretly transmitted to those destined to become Upper Immortals. Those who attain it become divine immortals, soaring into the Upper Clarity.\n\nThe Supreme Lord of the Radiant Brilliance of the Great Luminosity, the True and Peerless Sovereign, is the *qi* of the Primordial Mystery and Void.

This reverses the *qi* of the Great Luminosity, allowing you to refine further the essence of the Primordial Mystery and Void. Meditate, and he reverts to his true form.\n\nTo practice the Way of the Peerless Sovereign, on the day of the beginning of spring, enter your chamber and bow nine times facing east. Upon completing your audience with the Peerless Sovereign, turn to face north, strike your teeth nine times, and visualize the Peerless Sovereign shifting with the four seasons’ forms and shadows within the Jade Clarity’s Dark Forest Palace, Eight Obscurities Prefecture, Golden Net Hamlet, Cloud Net Hamlet. His true essence descends and reflects into the central gate of your liver’s palace. Then recite the incantation:\n\nGreat Luminosity shines doubly bright,\nDispersing numinous essence like scattered gold.\nThe Mysterious Radiance bursts forth in eight directions,\nStreaming essence and penetrating the yin.\nThe Peerless showers nectar,\nMoistening and overflowing the Nine Perfections.\nWithin filled, without replete,\nFortune extends to the Seven Ancestors.\nThe sunken and decayed enjoy moisture,\nAscending to the Supreme Perfection.\nMy body receives immortality,\nSoaring into the Moon Forest.\nMy form grows feathers,\nTransforming at will.\n\nThis done, look upward and swallow nine breaths to conclude. Practice this for nine years, and your seven ancestors will all become immortals. Divine perfected beings descend, allowing you to behold their numinous countenances.

Upon completing your audience with the Numinous Mystery Lord, turn to face north, strike your teeth twelve times, and visualize the Numinous Mystery Lord shifting with the four seasons’ forms and shadows within the Jade Clarity’s Cloud Forest Palace, Cloudy Upper Prefecture, Pure Han Hamlet, Luminous Simplicity Hamlet.

Seated upon seven-hued clouds, his radiance shines resplendent, illuminating the Upper Clarity. He dwells within the infinitesimal and beyond the eight obscurities—envision him reverting to a height of nine *cun* and nine *fen*. In the three months of summer, the Celestial Emperor of the Upper Radiance transforms into an elder, his head adorned with a flying dragon, his body clad in yellow-patterned furs and yellow-feathered skirts, holding a golden tablet. Standing upon purple clouds, his luminosity blazes brilliantly, penetrating the Upper Clarity—envision him reverting to his true form. In the three months of autumn, the Celestial Emperor of the Upper Radiance transfigures into a young child, dressed in five-colored garments, sometimes riding a lion, sometimes seated upon azure clouds—envision him reverting to his true form. In the three months of winter, the Celestial Emperor of the Upper Radiance transforms into a radiance of dark, black, and azure hues, its luminous chaos intertwining—this is the reversion of the Golden Portal’s *qi*, wherein he refines the essence of the Primordial Dawn’s communion. Envision him reverting to his true form.\n\nTo cultivate the Way of the Celestial Emperor of the Upper Radiance, on the first day of the first lunar month, as well as on *jiazi* days and the day of the Beginning of Spring, enter the chamber, face southeast, and bow nine times.

In the three months of winter, the Lord of the Immortals transforms into nine figures, each nine *cun* tall, their heads crowned with moonlight, clad in azure and yellow five-colored immortal robes. They dwell perpetually upon purple clouds, sometimes riding phoenixes to sport in the Dark Capital—envision him reverting to his true form.

This is the reversion of the qi of the Azure Vastness of Fusang, where they further refine the essence of the Primordial Source Valley. Envision them reverting to their true form.\n\nTo cultivate the Way of the Nine Qi Immortal Sovereigns, one should, on the day of the Spring Equinox, as well as on one’s own life-destiny day and the eighth day of the fourth month, enter the chamber, face the northeast, and bow three times. After paying homage to the Immortal Sovereigns, turn north, click the teeth twenty-four times, and envision the Immortal Sovereigns assuming their seasonal forms within the Upper Clarity’s Pure Primordial Palace, the Court of the Sunlit Valley in the Mingjing Village of Fusang.

      "translated_text": "When finished, look upward and swallow the five qi to conclude.\n\nThe Central Supreme Numinous High August Yellow Thearch, whose primordial yellow qi gives birth to all, stands thirty million zhang in height. In the months of the four seasons, he wears a Yellow Morn Jade Crown that reaches to heaven, a robe of yellow brocade, a skirt of dark-yellow flying-cloud brocade, carries the Yellow Spirit Yueyuan Staff, and girds the Spirit-Flying Purple Sash. He constantly stands atop a five-colored lion amid yellow clouds. Visualize him as returning to a height of three cun and three fen.\n\nIn the three autumn months, the White Qi Jade Yellow Thearch transforms his form, dividing into four youths clad in brocade robes of blue, white, red, and black, with flying-cloud brocade capes. Each wears a solar essence blossom upon his head and holds a five-colored banner, standing upon white clouds. Visualize him as reverting to his true form.\n\nIn the three winter months, the Black Qi Jade Yellow Thearch transforms into a single body with four heads of vermilion birds, their feathers resplendent and dappled, illuminating the northern quarter. Visualize him as reverting to his true form.\n\nIn the three spring months, the Blue Qi Jade Yellow Thearch transforms into a Venerable Elder of the August Above, his entire body yellow, wearing a halo like a wheel of light, holding a golden bell, and standing upon blue clouds. Visualize him as reverting to his true form.\n\nIn the three summer months, the Red Qi Jade Yellow Thearch transforms into a crimson radiance, its luminous hue flickering and bright, illuminating the southern quarter. This is the reversion of the High August’s qi, whereupon he receives the refined primordial yellow essence of generation. Visualize him as reverting to his true form.\n\nTo practice the Way of the Yellow Thearch, on the day of the Great Year and the first day of the jiazi cycle, enter the chamber and bow twelve times toward the Great Year. When the audience with the Yellow Thearch is complete, turn north, knock the teeth twelve times, and visualize the Yellow Thearch in his seasonal forms, residing in the Fourfold Round Hamlet of the Wu Village within the High August Prefecture of the Yellow Prime Palace of Highest Clarity. His reverted true essence descends and illumines, entering one’s Spleen Mansion. Then recite the incantation:\n\nThe Four Rigidities unite in truth, numinous transformations know no bounds. The Dao merges into one, the Five Phases unfold. Following the revolutions, names change; encircling the four quarters. Today is most auspicious, riding Yin and steering Yang. The Six Jia talismans align, the Grand Unity descends to welcome. Bind my register, inscribe my name in the Upper Capital. Attaining audience with the Three Origins, preserving the divine and august immortal.\n\nWhen finished, look upward and swallow the twelve qi to conclude.\n\n---\n\nThe Highest Clarity Primordial Beginning’s Transmutations and Primordial Registers\n\nThe High August Jade Emperor, the Supreme Sage Lord, the Nine Heavens Jade Perfected—all receive qi naturally, entrust their forms to jade wombs, conceal their brilliance in the Purple Prime, and through numinous harmony and resonance, attain personhood. Descendants of the imperial lineage, born as perfected beings, they knit the hollow cavern to form their script and unite the Three Qi to compose their names. Receiving the title of Thearch, they respond and transform in Highest Clarity, governing the immortals of the High Void, presiding over the Mysterious Mysteries. With the four seasons’ changes, they adjust the nodes and adapt, bathing, donning crowns and sashes, refining and adorning to endure forever. Their transformations of form and shadow respond to resonance and arise, obscure and indistinct.\n\nThus the Dao has no constant name; its depths cannot be fathomed, its subtleties cannot be exhausted. Heaven and earth rely upon it to stand, the Grand Mystery harmonizes with it to attain clarity. Sun and moon hold to it to shine brightly; the Five Phases receive it to attain numinosity. Vast is its virtue’s origin, boundless its lofty honor. Its Dao is exalted and wondrous, beyond all comparison.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning’s recorded registers are concealed within the Purple Chamber of the Supreme Lord’s Sixfold Union Palace. Transmitted once in ten thousand kalpas, they are the Nine Heavens’ forbidden scriptures, not to be heard by ghosts or spirits.\n\nThose who obtain and behold their chapter titles shall rejoice in the flourishing of their ancestral leaves, their blessings flowing to the mysterious root. Their souls ascend to the Southern Palace, their seven ancestors share in the joy. Their names inscribed on jade tablets, they attain immortality in life and death.\n\nLater sages studying the Way of the Supreme Perfected should refine and master the forms of the Primordial Beginning’s transmutations, adapting with the seasonal nodes to communicate with the true, revert the qi, and refine the spirit.\n\nFor instance, the Primordial Beginning’s August Elder of the Above, on the day of the Beginning of Spring, receives the qi of the Primordial Jade Void and assumes the title of August Elder of the Above. These are all true forms, their garments of proper colors. Throughout the ninety days of the three spring months, he resides in truth and presides in rectitude. By the day of the Beginning of Summer, the August Elder of the Above transforms his proper form, receiving the seasonal transmutation. Bathing in the divine and perfected, this is called “transmuting the immortal and exchanging the radiance,” communicating with the true and receiving the numinous, causing the qi to endure forever.\n\nIn the ninety days of the three summer months, the immortal soul bathes, the divine and perfected resonate and communicate. By the day of the Beginning of Autumn, the August Elder of the Above transforms his form with the season, donning the Five Constants’ crown and sash, called “immortal transmutation.” The qi communicates with the Mysterious Mysteries, filling within and overflowing without. Radiance and brilliance manifest, transforming the true and nourishing the qi, causing the qi to be inexhaustible.\n\nIn the ninety days of the three autumn months, donning the Nine Heavens’ crown and sash, the immortal transmutation is perfected. By the day of the Beginning of Winter, the August Elder of the Above contains the true, embraces fetal breathing, reverts the qi to its natural state, liberates the bodily form, transforms the radiance to enter the light, and returns to his primordial beginning. Receiving refinement and reverting the essence, he nurtures and polishes the divine and true. His radiance and color blend into chaos, like misty clouds.\n\nIn the ninety days of the three winter months, he congeals the qi and concentrates the spirit, returning to his proper form. Four revolutions complete the cycle, and the cycle renews. These are the Primordial Beginning’s four seasonal transmutations, adapting appearances with the nodes.\n\nThe revolutions of heaven and earth all have flourishing and decline, closure and opening, rest and activity, responding to the Celestial Pass. When flourishing, they preside in rectitude; when resting, they nurture and cultivate. Donning crowns and sashes, refining the essence, they do not lose their constancy. Thus heaven and earth endure forever, and this is the wondrous Way of transmutation, beyond all recording.\n\nThose who study the true should each follow their season, cultivating and visualizing the host of perfected beings, all according to the method of the Primordial Beginning’s August Elder of the Above. Within eight years, without losing the seasonal nodes, they shall surely cause the perfected to descend, behold the divine forms with their own eyes, and by following the qi’s transformations, ascend and fly into the Great Void.\n\nIn practicing the Way of the Four Transmutations, one should follow the season and ingest the Four Transmutations’ talismans.\n\nFor instance, in the three spring months, when practicing the Way and visualizing, one should first ingest the Talisman of Eastern Brightness Communicating with the True and Transmuting the Yang Radiance...",

In the three autumn months of practice, one should ingest the Talisman of Western Essence Vast Numinosity Transforming Radiance and Supporting the Rare. In the three winter months of practice, one should ingest the Talisman of Northern Mystery Profound True Refinement of Radiance and Whispering Wind.\n\nIf practicing the Way of the Yellow Emperor, one should ingest the Talisman of the Yellow Above Eight Directions Generating Radiance and Jade Gate during the seasonal transition months.\n\nThis is the Primordial Beginning’s transmutation and conjoining of the true to ascend the Dao. Those who practice it shall communicate with the celestial qi, summon spirits to attain immortality, cause divine countenances to descend in winding paths, and reflect them within their chambers. It regulates the practitioner’s form, harmonizes the qi of the Four Brahmā Realms, illuminates the Five Palaces, opens the gates to receive the true, and settles the spirits within the Jade Treasury. Following the seasonal nodes, it binds the immortals, harmonizes yin and yang below, orders the portals of observation, and revolves heaven and earth, encompassing the eight directions.\n\nIts scriptures are lofty and wondrous, the foundation of divine immortals. Those who know its method shall sit and behold the true numina, capable of transmutation and transformation, refining their forms in accord with the seasons. With the myriad spirits at peace and complete, they shall ascend and fly into the Upper Clarity. If kept secret, the spirits descend; if divulged, calamity befalls.\n\n**Talisman of Eastern Brightness Communicating with the True and Transmuting the Yang Radiance**\nIn the three spring months of practice, when visualizing the spirits and summoning the numinous, one should inscribe it in black upon blue paper, face east to ingest it, and after a hundred days, attain communion with the numinous. After a thousand days, one shall see the spirits; after thorough vision of ten thousand li, one shall sit and behold the natural. It commands nine Jade Maidens of the Azure True, who bring the treasure scriptures of the Azure Palace and the true writings of divine immortals.\n\nAlternatively, inscribe it in blue upon yellow silk and place it to the east of one’s seat or bed. Clad in azure brocade for a hundred days, the Azure Elder shall descend to one’s side, and the divine officials of the Azure Emperor shall attend with sacred writings, shielding the practitioner’s body. After nine years, one shall naturally attain the azure clouds of radiance, which shall bear one aloft in flight.\n\nThis is what is meant by \"through essence, one senses the descent of spirits, and sits to attain flying immortality.\" Its script is the essence of the Eastern Azure Radiance of Yang Brilliance, Opening Clarity and Communicating Light. Its qi is the primordial radiance of the Nine Origins, whose brilliance illumines the eastern heavens, flourishing in ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine myriad layers. Its essence whirls in verdant clarity, while azure clouds billow in the Great Void. Resplendent splendor shines upon the Nine Mysteries, flowing nectar beyond the groves of fine herbs, and jade springs pour into abysses of ten thousand fathoms. Within the groves dwell flocks of azure fowl, and in the abysses reside the divine kings of the Yang Valley. Above lies the Abode of Primordial Azure, and within stands the Palace of Azure Splendor. The abode contains the palaces of the Nine Qi Primordial Elders, where the Azure True Sage Sovereign is attended on the left by Jade Maidens of the Azure Waist and on the right by Azure-Feathered Numinous Lads. They ever ride the numinous beasts of Mount Tai, driving and guiding the Nine-Light Divine Dragons. In the third month of spring, they ascend to guide the qi of the Nine Heavens and descend to draw forth the source and flow of the Liver Palace. When the two qi intersect in resonance, transmutation occurs in an instant.\n\nThus, qi is congealed to form the talisman’s name, and essence is concentrated to form its script. By swallowing its qi, one may instantly behold the divine forms; by consuming its essence, one may transform and enter the Nine Heavens.

After eight years, one shall attain the vermilion clouds of radiance, which shall bear one aloft in flight to ascend the Palace of Cavernous Yang.\n\nIts script is the essence of the Southern Cavernous Radiance of Eightfold Refinement and Fourfold Clarity. Its qi is the primordial radiance of the Eight Heavens’ emanation, whose brilliance shines resplendently, illuminating the eight directions beyond. Its radiance flows and scatters like swift lightning across eighty-eight thousand eight hundred eighty-eight myriad layers. Its essence flames in cinnabar splendor, its light blazing and towering like auspicious clouds billowing in the court of the Great Yang. Jade nectar surges abundantly beyond the flowing fires, where dwell the deathless ones. Above stands the Terrace of the Southern Culmen, and within lies the Palace of Cavernous Yang. The terrace contains the abodes of the Lords of Immortality and the Directors of Destiny, where the Upper Perfected of Great Harmony is attended on the right by Jade Maidens of the Great Cinnabar and on the left by Azure-Round Numinous Lads. They ever gather the beasts of Mount Huo and guide the nine-colored phoenixes. In the third month of summer, they ascend to guide the qi of the Nine Heavens and descend to draw forth the bright beams of the Crimson Palace. When the two qi intersect in resonant transmutation, numinous transformation arises from the faintest glimmer.\n\nThus, essence is concentrated to form the script, and qi is congealed to form the stars. By swallowing its qi, one causes the numinous lords to descend to one’s chamber; by consuming its essence, one may fly through the Eight Voids, command the Six Jia, and summon the Six Ding. This is the wondrous Way of transmutation, elevating one’s rank to the Highest Clarity.\n\n**Talisman of Western Essence Vast Numinosity Transforming Radiance and Supporting the Rare**\nIn the three autumn months of practice, when visualizing the spirits and summoning the numinous, one should inscribe it in yellow upon white paper, face west to ingest it, and after a hundred days, attain communion with the numinous. After a thousand days, one shall see the spirits, and the perfected shall descend to meet one’s countenance. It commands six Jade Maidens of the Great Simplicity, who bring the golden essence, solar radiance, and refined mushroom herbs.\n\nAlternatively, inscribe it in white upon blue silk and place it to the west of one’s seat or bed. Clad in white brocade for a hundred days, the White Elder shall descend to one’s side, and the divine officials of the White Emperor shall attend with sacred writings, shielding the practitioner’s body. After six years, one shall attain the Three Simplicities’ cloud chariot, which shall descend to bear one aloft, ascending in form to the Great Void and flying into the Jade Clarity.\n\nIts script is the essence of the Western Vast Numinosity Cavernous Refinement Supporting the Emperor’s Golden Soul and White Gate. Its qi is the primordial radiance of the Six Evolutions’ golden illumination, whose brilliance shines resplendently, illuminating the western lands. It flows and spreads in sixty-six thousand six hundred sixty-six myriad layers.

      "translated_text": "Above the Cavernous Void’s Golden Gate, the flowing nectar pours into the Smelting Refinement Courtyard. Within this courtyard lies the Pool of Returning Countenance, where immortal lingzhi blossoms are refined. At the Golden Gate stands the Azure-Gold Elixir Terrace, upon which rises the Dragon Mountain’s divine tower. At its center lies the Palace of Primordial Numinosity, and within the tower are twelve Jade Immortal chambers. The Western Florescence Perfected One attends on the left, accompanied by the Primordial Numinosity Jade Maiden, while the Golden Florescence Youth guards on the right. They ever ride the numinous beasts of Mount Hua, driving the White Tiger King. In the third month of autumn, they ascend to guide the qi of the Nine Heavens and descend to draw forth the true essence within the Lung Palace. The two qi respond and transform in mutual convergence, giving rise to life at the Western Pass. Thus, congealing essence forms talismans, and binding qi forms spirits. One who swallows this qi shall instantly summon the divine countenance; one who consumes its essence shall ascend through the Golden Gate, command the Five Peaks, summon the Ten Directions, summon clouds and dragons, and follow their will. Its script is lofty and wondrous, beyond all praise.\n\nThe Northern Mystery’s Dark Refinement Radiant Whirlwind Talisman\nIn the third month of winter, perform the Dao and meditate upon the spirits to summon the numinous. Inscribe in black upon white paper, face north while ingesting it. After a hundred days, one shall attain spiritual communion; after a thousand days, one shall behold the true. Perceiving the subtle and unseen, one shall converse face-to-face with the divine, command the Five Supreme Mystery Jade Maidens, and summon the Five Stars’ High Consorts, the Lady Immortals, and the Numinous Perfected Ones to ascend the Central Mystery’s Chart of Divine Immortals and Treasured Script. Inscribe in black upon crimson silk and place it at the northern side of one’s seat or bed. After a hundred days clad in dark brocade, the Black Emperor shall descend to one’s mat, and the Black Emperor’s divine officials shall attend with protective talismanic script, shielding the practitioner’s body. After five years, the Dark Clouds shall descend to cover one’s form, ascending into the Great Void and flying to the center of the Northern Asterism.\n\nIts script is the essence of the Northern Mystery’s Dark Profundity Whirlwind Florescence Dawn. Its qi is the primordial radiance of the inception of yin and yang, its brilliance chaotic, now merging, now parting. Five-colored and mysteriously luminous, it illumines the Dark Solitary Heavens, flowing and spreading in fifty-five thousand five hundred myriad layers. Its essence is profoundly obscure yet mutually conjoined, resembling layered brocade clouds, merging with golden blossoms yet without glare, engendering the Five Phases and establishing the Mystery. Its divine transformations are manifest in the Northern Darkness’s wilds, its true nectar flowing into the Frigid Waters’ realm. In the Northern Darkness grows the refined immortal jade cream; in the Frigid Waters resides the Demon-Quelling King. Above is the Seven Dawns’ Florid Canopy; at its center lies the Hall of Vast Numinosity. The Florid Canopy shades the Dark Dipper’s True Chamber, where the August Jade Dawn attends on the right with the Supreme Mystery Jade Maiden and on the left with the Jade Dawn Youth. They ever ride the numinous beasts of Mount Chang, driving the Flying Tortoise’s purple wheels. In the third month of winter, they ascend to guide the qi of the Nine Heavens and descend to draw forth the flowing springs of the Kidney Palace. The two qi converge in divine communion, giving rise to transformations within a ten-day cycle. Thus, congealing essence forms scripture, and binding qi refines immortality. One who swallows this qi shall summon the Seven Dawns to descend to their chamber, gazing upon the divine countenance. One who consumes its essence shall reverse the transformations of yin and yang, summon clouds and dragons, ascend the Florid Hall, and witness the wondrous transformations of the divine script—the primordial origin of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Yellow Center’s Eight Directions Life-Radiance Jade Gate Talisman\nDuring the four seasons, perform the Dao and summon the numinous. Inscribe in red upon yellow paper, face the Seasonal King while ingesting it. After a hundred and twenty days, one shall attain spiritual communion and penetrating vision, foreknowing fortune and misfortune. After a thousand days, the Heavenly Perfected shall descend, and one shall converse face-to-face with the divine, command the Twelve Yellow Simplicity Jade Maidens, and summon the Yellow Center’s Eight Dao Intersecting True Mystery Record, the Flying Immortal’s Phoenix Robe, and the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Chapters. Inscribe in yellow upon black silk and place it at the center of one’s seat or bed. After a hundred days clad in yellow brocade, the Yellow Elder shall visit one’s chamber, and the Yellow Emperor’s divine officials shall attend with protective talismanic script, shielding the practitioner’s body. After twelve years, the Yellow Clouds shall descend to cover one’s form, and a jade chariot with feathered wheels shall ascend one to fly into the Supreme Mystery’s Palace.\n\nIts script is the essence of the Central Yellow Center’s Earth Mother Jade Gate Life-Radiance Illuminating Clarity. Its qi is the primordial radiance of the Heaven and Earth’s warp and weft, the twelve celestial stems’ transformations. Its brilliance illumines the Eight Directions; its mists swirl and scatter in all four directions. Its light shines resplendently, penetrating the Void, flourishing and guarding the Supreme Mystery’s capital. Its layers number twelve hundred myriad myriad. Its splendorous radiance bursts forth in the Nine Mysteries; its flowing essence overflows into the Four Seasons’ realm. Above is the Jade Capital’s mansion; at its center lies the Florid Canopy’s palace. Within the mansion are the Supreme Dao Lord’s chambers, where the Jade Dawn Sovereign attends on the left with the Flying Immortal’s Feathered Staff Azure Florescence Jade Maiden and on the right with the Golden Numinosity Divine Youth, Leading Immortal. They ever ride the Nine-Titled Numinous Beasts, driving the Supreme Mystery’s Yellow Dragon. They govern the Five Qi to assist the celestial stems, commanding the Twelve Celestial Hooks. They ascend to guide the source and flow of the Nine Heavens and descend to draw forth the Yellow Spirit of the Spleen Palace. The two qi converge above the Muddy Pellet, refining and blending within the Three Elixir Chambers. Thus, congealing essence transforms the spirit, and binding qi refines immortality. One who swallows this qi shall summon the Yellow Elder to descend in form; one who consumes its essence shall emit a diamond hue, their body generating water and fire, their neck crowned with a halo of light. Myriad wonders shall transform, and one shall ascend into the Great Void—such is the wondrous efficacy of this numinous script, its lofty transformations beyond measure.\n\nThese Five Elders’ secret scriptures are concealed within the Nine Heavens’ Five Numinous Jade Capitals’ Golden Florescence Purple Chambers, attended by the Five Emperors’ Numinous Youths and the Five Emperors’ Jade Florescence Jade Maidens, fifty each, who burn incense, scatter flowers, and guard the divine script. According to the Nine Heavens’ ancient statutes, they are transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas, all bestowed upon the Perfected Immortals to become True Ones. Should any of the Mysterious Simplicity’s Imperial Charts, inscribed with the Three Clarities’ characters, be destined for later sages, they shall behold the numinous scrolls, cultivate and transform, meditate upon and invoke the spirits, and ingest the jade script. Within nine years, they shall summon the Five Elders to descend to their chamber, converse face-to-face with the Heavenly Perfected, penetrate the unseen and void, sit and stand without substance, transform water and fire, and ascend at dawn in broad daylight. To lightly divulge or profane these teachings shall bring calamity upon the Seven Mysteries, forfeit one’s own life, and consign one to eternal oblivion in the River Source.",

Master and disciple must face each other in purification for a hundred days, or seventy days. The disciple presents nine taels of refined gold, forty-seven feet of crimson brocade from the cinnabar earth, twenty-two feet of blue cloth, one golden dragon, and one jade fish. Facing north at the altar, they invoke the Nine Heavens to transmit the scripture, while the disciple bares his heart to heaven to receive it. Should the master transmit without regard to the time limit, he shall suffer the trial of the wind-blade. Should the disciple seek the True without sincerity, thus belittling the celestial treasure, his wealth and body shall sink into the River Source, and he shall never attain immortality. The celestial statutes warn to be prudent—clearly and carefully observe these precepts.\n\n---\n\nThe Nine Perfected of the Eightfold Mystery of the Mystic Capital of the Nine Heavens roamed the void, their numinous feet transcending the Jade Hall. Their radiance floated upon the Purple Clarity of the Great Mystery, as the Jade Emperor sported amidst the Nine Phoenixes’ dragon chariot and jade carriage, riding five-colored flying clouds, followed by twelve dragon-drawn chariots. Twenty-four celestial officials and jade maidens accompanied them, along with eight simurghs and white cranes, nine phoenixes soaring and singing in cloud formations, nine-colored standards, ten tasseled banners, three celestial treasure canopies, and nine heavenly mounts flying through the vast sky, arriving directly at the Five Marchmounts and renowned mountains. There, they met with the True Lords of the Five Marchmounts and together declared their intent to visit the Eightfold Radiance Grotto within the cavern-chamber of Tortoise Mountain, where they would meet with the Perfected of the Jade Emperor of the Most High in the golden hall of the grotto. With jade rings, they swore oaths to heaven, obtaining the right to transcribe the grotto scriptures and inscribe their names in the celestial records. The jade characters were engraved upon golden tablets, pledging the mysterious words.\n\nThe *Luminous Writ of the Great Empyrean*, the flying splendor of sun and moon, the radiant ornaments of the sun’s chariot, and the dark mushrooms of the mysterious—all were consumed by the Nine Mothers and the True Lord Consorts of the Five Emperors, who descended together. In a single day and night upon the terrace of Tortoise Mountain, the great sages and true officials of the ten directions, heaven and earth, sun and moon gathered, spreading golden couches and azure mats to convene the assembly of celestial sages. Again, they performed the hundred arts of cloud music, praising the natural emptiness of the void, harmonizing a hundred tones. Their long chants and oath-songs soared into the Nine Empyreans, ascending in response to the Heavenly King and the Lord Emperor of Jade Capital.\n\nUpon the completion of one cycle of the numinous hymn, the immortal officials, soldiers, and cavalry of Tortoise Mountain—numbering a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders—along with the Perfected, the Merit Officers, the Flying Generals, the Direct Talisman Clerks, the Jade Lads, the Divine Maidens, and the envoys and officials of the Nine Heavens, totaling nine hundred million myriad beings, obtained the True Talismans of the Nine Heavens, the celestial writings in jade script, and the melodies of the Twelve Phoenixes’ mysterious songs. These were divided into two scrolls, the upper and the lower, stored upon a golden terrace within the Purple Chamber of the Nine Heavens, wrapped in brocade and sealed in a golden casket, locked with silver bolts in a jade chamber. The transmission was commanded to the Lady of Purple Tenuity, who was to bring them forth.\n\nOn the day of their unveiling, a pure wind swept through the forests, and the Threefold Simplicity’s clouds illuminated the ten directions. Divine radiance and mysterious brilliance suffused the chamber of the golden terrace. Thereupon, the Lady of Purple Tenuity knelt to receive them, while the True Demons and Kings of the Nine Heavens rejoiced and prostrated in homage.\n\nThe *Orthodox Writ of the Nine Heavens* of the Great Clarity’s Mysterious Elder, the *True Jade Emperor of the Cavern-Real and Spontaneous Emptiness*, was expounded within the grotto-chamber of the Jade Capital’s Flowery Mountain, amidst the rosy clouds and kingfisher plumes. At that time, forty million myriad golden lads and ninety million myriad jade maidens attended to his left and right. The grotto-chamber was spread with yellow gold, its couches of white silver, and when the Heavenly Worthy descended, the mats were of yellow and dark cloud brocade. The divine kings and immortals entreated, kneeling long to inquire of the Mysterious Emperor of the Nine Heavens:\n\n*\"We humbly hear that the Most High and the myriad sages, the Great Emperors, the jade hymns of the mysterious songs, the radiant splendor of cinnabar flowers, the soaring kingfisher phoenixes, and the dragon-drawn chariots journeyed afar to the capital of the Flowery Emperor. Together, they chanted the Nine Shao and the numinous hymns of Great Harmony, inscribing the cavern-real true writ upon stone to proclaim the Upper Origin’s Great Mystery of Tortoise Mountain, harmonizing with the immortals of the Nine Heavens’ cavern-chambers. The True King of Jade Emptiness commanded the demonic and numinous banners to review the registers of the thirty-two heavens, the canons of sun and moon, where clouds travel and rain descends, moistening the world below. A hundred flowers burgeon together, jade trees with branches of green, blossoms of cinnabar, fragrant gardens and fruit groves, the seven treasures and threefold radiance.*\n\n*The Most High Heavenly Worthy, the Jade Lads of the Upper Clarity, the True Flower Jade Maidens, the Jeweled Chambers of Na Forest, transform and enlighten the multitudes. The lords of kingdoms and emperors, the Jade Lords of the Four Heavens, the Han Controllers and Han Lords, the myriad officials and immortal lords of the ten directions, the hundred demon kings of Human Radiance, soar through the empty void to transform and cover the multitudes. Flying jade cloud chariots, a thousand two hundred mysterious dragon-drawn carriages, thunder and lightning, their brilliance illuminating the ten directions, descend into our chamber, bowing and kneeling in praise and song. The incense and flowers of the myriad heavens, the hundred pipes harmonizing as one, the chiming of jade and the natural bells and chimes, the celestial processional music, the three luminaries of the seven treasures, the hundred harmonies—all delight and rejoice together.*\n\n*The demonic kings and deviant spirits of the Nine Heavens, the celestial emperors, all attend at the side. Flying cloud feathered canopies, twelve silk banners, standards and drums, arrayed before the Emperor, the myriad heavens chanting in unison, praising and reciting together.\"*",

      "translated_text": "At that time, the Supreme Perfection Sovereign Lord, the Lord of the Realm and King of Kings, the Upper Sages leading the Perfected, and the Nine Heavens’ Celestial Emperors—naturally divine immortals with cinnabar radiance, sun-and-moon dragon scripts, the Eight Arts of Immortals, the *Mysterious Flight* of the Seven Luminaries, and jade registers—concealed within the earth the *Mysterious Cinnabar* and *Vermilion Writ* jade formulas. Could the Earthly Perfected’s phoenix scripts be attained?\n\nSince the separation of Heaven and Earth, the hundred poisons have spread, and all creatures—winged, crawling, and moving—along with immortals riding their mounts and the host of Perfected driving cloud chariots, have come to assemble at the imperial court. Hundreds and thousands of sagely Perfected stand guard over the numinous writs, while jade lads and maidens stand in attendance beside the true texts. Within the golden halls and jasper chambers, amidst the seven-jeweled floral groves by the emerald waters, they gather with the jade Perfected, the dragon kings, the celestial treasures and earthly spirits, the Eight Might and Nine Domains’ million-strong immortal officials. In their hands, they hold incense, flowers, banners, and canopies of nine hues and eight nodes, standing resplendent in the vast sky, their brilliance equal to the sun and moon. The hundred sounds flow in harmony, celestial maidens and immortal music fill the air, rare birds and strange beasts abound, a hundred million lions, giant serpents stretching a thousand fathoms—no darkness remains unilluminated, no distance left unlit. The ten directions are wholly radiant, as the flying Perfected tread the void, feasting in jade chambers, golden terraces aglow with precious light, and the eight delicacies laid before them.\n\nAscending the Cavern Tortoise Mountain to attain immortality, they sup on jasper mushrooms at dawn and rinse with jade springs at dusk, all coming to assemble here. The Twelve Mystic Dragons, purple phoenixes and cloud-serpents, divine birds and sagely *luan*-spirits, cinnabar carriages and feathered canopies of true mounts, the many gods’ resplendent nine-hued radiance, the Five Perfected of Jade Capital, the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, Kunlun’s famed mountains, the dragon spirits of rivers and seas—all the sagely hosts of Perfected and immortals, ten million times nine thousand eight hundred ranks, the cloud spirits of the *Purple Void* and Upper Cinnabar Lords, descend with the spirit officials to meet me.\n\nFirst, the invocation to the Supreme Perfection of the Nine Heavens, the Nine Elders of the *Purple Void* Immortal Capital, the hundred thousand myriad venerable Perfected and sagely immortals, the *Eight Radiance* August Spirits, the natural and the void, illumining the sun, moon, and subtle mysteries.\n\nAt that time, the celestial officials spoke this eulogy:\n\nClouds and purple grace the Upper Numinous Palace,\nNaturally a hundred immortal lads.\nLiterary radiance mirrors sun and moon,\nThe Nine Elders’ splendor everlasting.\nLunar blossoms gleam in the Three Yang,\nManifesting this union of the Four Vastnesses.\nResplendent, the host of immortals roam,\nInfinitesimal, they ascend the Upper Palace.\nHalting their chariots at Penglai’s ridge,\nThey lead companions to climb the lofty peaks.\nSun and moon illuminate the immortal capital,\nWhere they sport with the Queen Mother’s wall.\nA lifetime transcends the mundane dust—\nWho can fathom this realm?\nAt dawn they soar to the Sun Observation,\nAt dusk they rest in secluded Langfeng.\nThe immortals lead their companions,\nBright and dim, naturally harmonious.\nJade maidens ride sagely phoenixes,\nDivine immortals mount true dragons,\nDrifting together in graceful flight,\nFeathered canopies solemn and reverent.\nThey summon me, Wang Qiao’s friend,\nTo join them soaring in the clouds.\nPurple clouds are my domain—\nWho in the mortal world shares this path?\nThe immortals sport amidst cloudscapes,\nCinnabar blossoms unfold in spring’s radiance.\nNone fail to sing this refrain,\nThe blessed Dao-ground of the Perfected.\nThe imperial chariot halts with cloud companions,\nDrifting, drifting, they soar freely.\nGazing beyond the Eight Extremities—\nWhose power sustains eternal existence?\nSun and moon share benevolence and wisdom,\nThe empty valley bids farewell to dawn’s light.\nTurning to the host of immortal lads—\nWho knows the measure of a century’s span?\nThe Ten Sages welcome the omen-body—\nExcellent! Do not forget.\nAddressing the worldly scholars,\nThese immortal lads are not for you.\nA thousand years flourish like morning blossoms,\nA hundred years bloom like evening’s splendor.\nThe host of Perfected roam Mount Taihua,\nThe immortals soar freely.\nTurning their radiance to sport at the Nine Doubts,\nAbove, they wander with the Supreme Perfection.\nInfinitesimal, the host of immortal scholars,\nPurple canopies tilt with gentle light.\nHalting their radiance to rest in harmonious dawn,\nThe divine phoenixes plot no schemes.\nSupreme harmony soars in Langfeng,\nAssembling at the ridge, their floral barges gleam.\nNine circuits share one vision—\nGazing back, none share this realm.\nInfinitesimal, the Supreme Unity’s palace,\nDrifting, drifting, the companions of the Nine Ridges.\nSun and moon gleam with floral radiance,\nTheir light illumines the true floating.\nSoaring *luan*-birds arrange the morning dawn—\nStrive on, seekers of the Upper Perfection!\nCountless kalpas differ in measure,\nA thousand years pass without blame.\nIlluminating meetings with divine lads,\nNine circuits follow nature’s course.\n\nTo the right: *One Mystic Dragon Riding Purple Clouds to Soar the Void and Chant Eulogies*, recorded.\n\nAnd these Eight Levels and Eight Gates, thus the incantation:\n\nClouds fly, Upper Sagely Ones,\nWho lead the Supreme Perfection Lord.\nRiding dragons, driving purple phoenixes,\nThey come to the Queen Mother’s palace.\nAt dawn they feast on jasper mushrooms and treasures,\nAt dusk they rinse with jade pool’s sweet wine.\nRoaming together at the Sun Observation,\nResting amidst secluded Langfeng.\nBowing below the Nine Doubts’ ridge,\nLooking up to the imperial center’s zenith.\nStepping calmly to ascend the Five Ridges,\nGuiding reins to follow nature’s end.\nIngesting and nourishing to cultivate longevity,\nA thousand years without end.\nYou possess the art of nurturing nature—\nCherish the void and preserve harmony.\n\nAt that time, another arrived at the Upper Palace, descending to the Numinous Mystery to bow before the Nine Elders and the Nine Heavens’ Upper Perfection officials. They inquired: The Lords of the Three Upper Heavens, the Perfected and Envoys, the Immortal Capital’s Chief Ministers, the silk brocades of mysterious yellow—then commanded the Immortal Capital’s Attendants to lead the jade lads and transformed immortal maidens to the upper seat, and again to proceed to the Mystery.\n\nIf the Nine Palaces command the Supreme Mystery Capital, then summon the *Bright Immortal* and *Supreme Perfection* venerable sagely officials, and command the Tortoise Immortal’s Cavern Chamber to inscribe the stone true writs, the Three Primes’ Perfected registers, the jade lads, Perfected immortals, and envoys. Command the true celestial sagely immortal officials, the Nine Elders and Upper Sages, to ascend in broad daylight, together roaming the *Purple Void*.\n\nWe prostrate to see the Upper Perfection immortal officials inscribing the stone numinous writs and jade characters, the natural cavern chapters of the Five Florals’ two eulogies. Their words:\n\nAbove, roaming the Five Ridges’ peaks,\nTogether soaring at Taihua’s observation.\nThe Three Elders chant jade chapters,\nThe Three Radiance cavern texts resplendent.\nAt dusk they recite the jade immortals’ verses,\nAt dawn they wander until morning’s end.\nA thousand years bid farewell to the host of immortals—\nWho through ten thousand generations can fathom the reckoning?\nInfinitesimal, the Five Florals’ earth,\nSerene, the Nine Yang’s Han.\nThe ridge’s heights host the immortals’ play,\nRadiant scenes, spring blossoms in full bloom.\nLeading me to roam the cloud peaks,\nMy heart awaits the divine dawn.\nLofty as a hundred blossoms’ clouds—\nWho knows the cloudscape’s clarity?\nWarm qi unfolds the cinnabar trees,\nGreen leaves reflect purple glory.\nAbove, I ascend the Five Peaks’ heights,\nBelow, I wander the Four Streams’ numina.\nWithin the Jade Sovereign’s cavern hearth,\nI behold the *Great Clarity* scriptures.",
