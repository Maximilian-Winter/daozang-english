  "full_translation": "*The Jade Pivot Precious Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Responsive Origin, Thunder’s Voice, and Universal Transformation Heavenly Worthy*\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy of the Nine Heavens’ Responsive Origin, Thunder’s Voice, and Universal Transformation was in the Jade Purity Heaven, where he convened with the Heavenly Lords of the Ten Directions in the Hall of Jade Void and Ninefold Radiance, the Pavilion of Fragrant Mist and Vast Net, the Chamber of Purple Ultimate and Winding Secrecy. There, they perused the azure jade tablets of the Great Obscure and examined the books of the Profound Luminous Dawn, whispering intimately of the profound mysteries. The many attending ministers stood in reverent attendance to either side.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy, seated in tranquil recitation of the cavernous scriptures, was joined by the Heavenly Lords chanting as they paced the void. Celestial maidens and immortal maidens scattered blossoms in circling dance, then led one another in playful wandering through the verdant palaces. The assembled immortals processed ahead, bearing ceremonial staves and battle-axes, their dragon banners and simurgh chariots swaying through the vast sky, gathering upon the seven-jeweled tiered terrace of Jade Brahma.\n\nThen the Thunder Master, Elder Hao, stepped forth from the ranks of immortals, approaching before the Heavenly Worthy and bowing deeply. With a voice both resonant and true, he performed the rites, rising in solemn reverence to kneel and address the Heavenly Worthy:\n\n“Great is the Heavenly Worthy’s compassion, great is the Heavenly Worthy’s sagacity! Father of all beings, teacher of the myriad spirits! Today, all the heavens enjoy this auspicious audience. Just now, I witnessed the Heavenly Worthy perusing the precious tablets and examining the jade books within the profound mysteries of the central archives—an incalculable treasure.”\n\nThe Jade Firmament’s single prefecture governs the inner courts of the thirty-six heavens, including the Eastern and Western Flower Terraces, the Mystic Halls and Wondrous Pavilions, the Four Palaces and Six Institutes, and all their subordinate bureaus—these together oversee the Five Thunders’ descent into the Three Realms. The Heavenly Worthy, august and sovereign, attends to all affairs with intimate care. Yet such minor omens—by what cause or condition do they come to submit? We wish to hear the reason.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Thunder Master Hao, you and your immortal ministers have stored merit across past lives and accumulated deeds through former births, thus gaining appointment to the Jade Prefecture and enrollment in the Jeweled Palace. Now, your merit and conduct surpass even those of former times. Apply yourselves fully, entrusting your hearts to the Fire Department of the Thunder Bureau. Day after day, year after year, as merit mounts and conduct shines, as nature clears and spirit harmonizes, you will attain the rank of lofty perfected ones and ascend the wondrous Dao.\n\nYet the ghosts and spirits of the Thunder Department toil by day and labor by night, ever subject to flogging and cudgeling, now tormented with the lash, now carved like clouds or snow—unceasingly. Summons to dragons and commands to crows: this ceases only for that to begin, that for this. Such is the cause and condition of their lot.”\n\nThunder Master Hao and all the gods and immortals of the heavens pricked up their ears in silence. The Heavenly Worthy sat upon the nine-phoenix cinnabar-dawn screen, raising a golden luminous ruyi scepter. A pure, subtle breeze arose, and embroidered clouds gathered in splendor. The Heavenly Worthy remained still for a long while.\n\nThen he spoke: “In a former kalpa, fifteen hundred aeons past, I first stitched this Dao with the needle of my mind, thereby attaining the rank of Supreme Perfected. My intent fermented this merit, and thus I wielded the authority of great transformation. Once, before the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Great Ultimate in the Great Brahma Heaven, I vowed with a pure and vast heart: ‘In future ages, may all beings—celestial dragons, ghosts, and spirits—who but once invoke my name all transcend defilement. Should this not be so, I shall take their suffering upon myself.’ Now, purify your hearts, for I shall proclaim this to you.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy continued: “You gods and humans who wish to hear the supreme Dao—the supreme Dao is profound and subtle, yet it lies nowhere else. If you truly wish to hear, know that the unhearing is the unhearing, and the seeing is the true Dao. To open sight is also to dissolve it—it is yours alone. You are not even ‘you,’ how much less the Dao? To hear without hearing—what Dao is there to discuss?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: “The Dao is entered through sincerity, guarded through silence, and employed through softness. To use sincerity is to seem foolish; to use silence is to seem inarticulate; to use softness is to seem clumsy. Only thus can you forget form, forget self, forget even forgetting. Those who enter the Dao know when to stop; those who guard the Dao know caution; those who employ the Dao know subtlety. Knowing subtlety, wisdom’s light arises; knowing caution, sagely wisdom is complete; knowing when to stop, perfect stability and peace are attained. With perfect stability and peace, sagely wisdom is complete; with sagely wisdom complete, wisdom’s light arises; with wisdom’s light arisen, one becomes one with the Dao—this is called true forgetting. Only in forgetting yet not forgetting, in forgetting what cannot be forgotten, does the un-forgettable become the supreme Dao.\n\nThe Dao pervades heaven and earth, yet heaven and earth do not know it. Sentient and insentient alike—there is but one, without duality.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy asked: “How shall I now benefit beings in this world? For all gods and humans, I expound this wondrous treasure. Those who awaken to it shall ascend the immortal’s throne. Students of the Dao, believe in the workings of qi and destiny. For lands and climates differ, and thus endowments vary—this is called qi. For wisdom and folly differ, and thus purity and turbidity vary—this is called destiny. Destiny is bound to fate; qi is struck by heaven. Constrained by qi and destiny, fettered by heavenly mandate, one cannot attain the true Dao. Yet the foolish may become wise, the turbid may become clear—this is decreed by fate. Foolishness is dull, turbidity is dark—these too shift with the endowments of land and climate.\n\nHeaven and earth move by their mechanism, causing people to remain unaware—this is called spontaneity. To know that one does not know is also called spontaneity. The wonder of spontaneity, though wondrous in knowledge, is wondrous precisely because it arises from not-knowing. Yet in relation to the Dao, it has never begun to exist—through the foolish and the turbid. All the gods heard this, and the four assemblies rejoiced.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: “What I have now spoken is the *Precious Scripture of the Jade Pivot.*”\n\nShould beings of future ages hear my name and, in profound stillness, silently invoke it—whether once, five or seven times, or hundreds or thousands—thinking thus: *\"Nine Heavens Responsive Primordial Thunder-Sounding Universal Transformation Heavenly Worthy,\"* I shall manifest in the ten directions, extending my intent through the Three Realms, ensuring all who call my name attain their heart’s desire. Throughout the ten directions and Three Realms, among all heavens and earths, sun and moon, stars and constellations, mountains and rivers, grasses and trees, creatures winged and crawling, whether sentient or insentient, gods and dragons, ghosts and spirits—should any fail to comply upon hearing a single invocation of my name, may their heads be severed and hearts carved out, reduced to motes of dust.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: *\"I am the Nine Heavens’ True Radiance Great Sage. On the sixth day of each month and the *xin* days of the mid-decade, I oversee the myriad heavens and wander the Three Realms. Should one aspire to cultivate the Dao, seek immortality, evade the Nine Darks, or dispel the Three Calamities, let them engage a Zhengyi Daoist priest—or gather with kin and friends in a towered temple, at home, or in a village shrine—to pour libations of water, offer flowers, and recite this scripture—once, three or five times, or even tens or hundreds of times. Thereby shall they attain clarity of spirit, vigor of qi, expansiveness of heart, and ease of body. Sound the chime. All aspirations, without exception, shall meet with response.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: *\"The nine numinous spirits within the body—why not summon them? The first is Celestial Birth, the second Immaculate Radiance, the third Mystic Pearl, the fourth Central Upright, the fifth Child Cinnabar, the sixth Revolving Wheel, the seventh Cinnabar Prime, the eighth Great Abyss, the ninth Numinous Youth. Summon them, and all shall be auspicious. The three essences within the body—why not invoke them? The first is Terrace Light, the second Luminous Clarity, the third Secluded Essence. Invoke them, and blessings shall follow. When the five centers grow vexed and stifled, when the six pulses surge in tumult, when the four limbs lose their peace, when the hundred joints cry out in distress—recite this scripture.*\n\n*The Heavenly Worthy said: Should one encounter adversity in the Five Phases, peril in the Nine Luminaries, a year of punishment and clash, a fate of mutual conquest, solitary stars and bereft constellations, the Blade of Yang and the Edge of the Sword, the Calamity of Robbery and the Spirit of Death, the Ghost Gate’s twisting coils, the ruin of one’s allotted fortune, the Steed’s fall into emptiness—every movement fraught with danger, every step mired in misfortune—recite this scripture. Then shall the Heavenly Officials dispel celestial misfortune, the Earthly Officials quell terrestrial woes, the Water Officials resolve aquatic perils, the Five Emperors dissolve the afflictions of the five directions, the Four Sages dissolve the afflictions of the four seasons, the Southern Star dissolve the afflictions of one’s natal fate, and the Northern Dipper dissolve all misfortunes.*\n\n*The Heavenly Worthy said: When chronic illness confines one to bed, when stubborn ailments weigh upon the body, when time accumulates without relief, when physicians’ efforts prove futile, when the five spirits lose their governance and the four great elements scatter—whether before the Five Emperors and the Three Officials, before the Five Paths of Mount Tai, before the sun, moon, and stars, before the mountains, forests, grasses, and trees, before sacred altars and ancient sites, before city gods and village shrines, before the wells and hearths of lanes and alleys, before the temples, pagodas, and towers—or whether in the Thirty-Six Prisons of the Underworld or the Seventy-Two Bureaus of the Nether Officials, where grievances abound—recite this scripture. Or if the cause lies in oaths, curses, or vows, or in debts unpaid and obligations unmet; if enmity spans three lifetimes or grudges stretch across kalpas, if faults and transgressions accumulate, if karmic adversaries stand in opposition—confess and repent, then recite this scripture.*\n\n*The Heavenly Worthy said: The Heavenly Officials’ talismans, the Earthly Officials’ talismans. Each year, month, day, and hour bears its own official talisman. Every direction and orientation bears its own official talisman. Great matters bring official talismans; small matters bring gossip—governed by the gods of the Red Mouth and the White Tongue. In all actions and undertakings, in going out and returning, in rising and resting, if one fails to observe taboos and avoid offenses, encountering official talismans or slanderous tongues, one shall suffer harassment, day and night tormented as if scorched, lips and words entangled. Faces may affirm while backs deny, and every movement invites dispute. Swearing by gods and cursing the Buddha begin with slander and defamation, end in abuse and vilification—thus lawsuits arise, and punishments await. To escape such fate, recite this scripture, and slander shall vanish like mist, official talismans forever stilled.*\n\n*The Heavenly Worthy said: The Nine Mounds of the Earth Sovereign are governed by one thousand two hundred spirits—Earth Lords and Earth Earls, Earth Lords and Earth Ladies, Earth Children and Earth Grandchildren, the Earthly household and its kin. Whether the Grand Year-Star, the General, the Crane Spirit, Venus, the Nine Excellencies, the Sword’s Edge, the Male and Female, the Metal Spirit, the Fire and Blood, the Yellow Body, the Colliding Fate, the Three Calamities, the Seven Calamities, the Yellow Banner and Leopard’s Tail, the Flying Blade and Anvil—all such earthly spirits and baleful stars. Should one undertake construction or choose a dwelling site and offend them, illness and even death shall follow. But recite this scripture, and the myriad spirits shall rise; heaven shall hold no taboos, earth shall hold no taboos, yin and yang shall hold no taboos, and all prohibitions shall be lifted.*\n\n*The Heavenly Worthy said: Among the world’s husbands and wives, in their unions, some offend the Salty Pond, some the Heavenly Dog, some the Three Punishments and Six Harms, some the clashing angles of isolation and bereavement, some the snares of the Heavenly Net and Earthly Web—struggling to bear descendants, often left solitary and childless. Should one seek a son, recite this scripture, and the Great Spirit of Celestial Birth shall summon the spirits and gather the winds, bringing forth a worthy child. At the hour of birth, the Great Unity stands at the door, the Controller of Fate in the courtyard. Should grievances, ghosts, or malevolent spirits intrude, should taboos or misfortunes arise, causing difficult labor—recite this scripture, and the Nine Heavens’ Guardians of the Chamber shall attend, the Holy Mother silently aiding in the delivery, ensuring a joyous birth and a safe labor. For all infants in swaddling, tormented by the fifteen kinds of ghosts beneath the Sandalwood Spirit King’s throne, suffering convulsions and seizures—recite this scripture.*\n\n*The Heavenly Worthy said: When one’s dwelling is plagued by crows and rats bearing omens, by snakes and insects bearing afflictions, by bricks and tiles hurled in malice, by startled chickens and mischievous dogs, by demands for sacrifices—even to the point of spectral coercion and dream oppression, or theft and adultery—dare these spirits claim the dwelling as their lair, bewitching the living. The courtyard and home grow unclean; wailing echoes through the beams by night, spying eyes peer into the chamber by day. Cattle, horses, dogs, and swine suffer pestilence; calamity clings to kin, disaster befalls livestock. Wicked shrines and demonic cults gather, evil spirits and sorcerers conspire, funeral guests arrive in droves, funeral carriages depart in succession. Recite this scripture, and ghostly spirits shall perish, people and creatures alike shall know peace.*\n\n*The Heavenly Worthy said: The Generals of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder, the Generals of the Five Directions’ Thunder, the Generals of the Eight Directions’ Cloud and Thunder, the Envoys of the Five Directions’ Barbarian Thunder, the Thunder Department’s Soldiers and Envoys, the Adjudicating Officials—issuing commands swift as wind and fire. Where there are temples to be struck, altars to be smitten, demons to be expelled, and malevolent spirits to be banished—in this degenerate age of the Dharma’s end, with sorcerers and shamans proliferating, dark arts spreading, and secret curses rampant—thus does the Upper Clarity possess the Celestial Court for Binding Ghosts and Recording Transgressions, the Imperial Prison for Restraining Demons and Interrogating Evil. Recite this scripture, and the response shall be as swift as an echo.*\n\n*The Heavenly Worthy said: The Heavenly Pestilence, the Earthly Pestilence, the Twenty-Five Pestilences.\"*\n\nThe Celestial Gu and Earthly Gu, the Twenty-Four Gu.\nThe Celestial Consumptive Ailments and Earthly Consumptive Ailments, the Thirty-Six Consumptive Ailments.\nRecite this scripture, and pestilence shall be purified, gu toxins dispelled, and consumptive afflictions healed.\n\nThere are reasons for these afflictions:\nSome arise from the recently deceased entangling the living,\nOthers from lingering corpse qi or ancestral miasmas,\nOr from tomb disputes and burial curses,\nOr from the contamination of dead souls,\nOr from the summoning of corpse qi.\nAll such spirits—whether grieving, resentful, or hateful—\nDrag the living into their entanglements, clinging as witnesses,\nStriking when opportunity arises.\n\nThus this scripture ascends to the Three Heavens and descends to the Nine Springs,\nEnabling the deliverance of wandering souls and the salvation of ancestors and forebears.\nThe Most High dispatches the Great General of the White Chariot and White Horses to oversee this.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said:\nShould one prepare for a distant journey,\nWith bandits and thieves scheming, and weapons poised to strike—\nOn land, tigers and wolves, mountain spirits and ants sharpen their fangs;\nOn water, dragons and turtles, alligators and soft-shelled turtles gape their jaws.\nSome rapids harbor vengeful souls,\nSome winds and waves mark predestined calamities.\nThe dead of the past and the transformed of the present seize the living to replace the dead.\nYet those who take refuge in this scripture and pledge their devotion\nShall find peace on land and water, their travels and repose harmonious and auspicious.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said:\nWhen scorching drought rages and rains fail their season,\nProstrate yourself before this scripture, and timely sweet showers shall fall.\nWhen unrelenting yin prevails and floods overflow,\nProstrate yourself before this scripture, and skies shall clear at once.\nWhen the Fire God fans disaster and flames engulf homes,\nWhen red rats roam the city, startling the people with searing heat—\nThis scripture can avert such misfortune.\nWhen the Sea God loses control and fish and turtles run amok,\nWhen floods rise to the heavens and people drown—\nThis scripture can halt them.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said:\nShould mortals wish to escape the calamities of the Three Disasters and Nine Perils,\nThey must, in the stillness of night, bow their heads toward the Northern Asterism.\nAbove the Northern Asterism lie the Three Terraces,\nTheir stars aligned like twin eyes,\nStacked in three tiers to cover the Dipper’s bowl—\nThis is called the Celestial Stairway.\nThose who behold it shall know no imprisonment in life\nNor the suffering of drowning in death.\nWithin the Dipper resides the August Emperor,\nTwo stars vast as chariot wheels.\nThose who see them shall preserve their form in the world,\nAttaining long life as divine immortals.\nTake refuge in this scripture, surrender your heart to the Northern Culmen,\nAnd unseen responses shall follow.\n\nThe Dipper is the Pivot of Heaven,\nWithin it lies the Celestial Stem,\nInternally known as *Lian Zhen*, externally as *Po Jun*.\nThe Twelve Gates of the Thunder Citadel all follow the Stem’s direction.\nWhen the Stem points to *chou*, its body resides in *wei*—\nWhat it points to is auspicious; where it dwells is inauspicious.\nThe same holds for all other positions.\nThose who see it may live a thousand years.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said:\nAs the world declines and the Dao withers, people lack virtue.\nThey are disloyal to their lords,\nUndutiful to their parents,\nDisrespectful to their teachers and elders,\nUnkind to their siblings,\nUnfaithful to their spouses,\nUnjust to their friends,\nUnawed by Heaven and Earth,\nUnafraid of the gods,\nDisrespectful to the Three Luminaries,\nNeglectful of the Five Grains.\nWith three bodily transgressions and four oral sins,\nThey use large scales and small measures,\nKill a hundred to harm a thousand,\nIndulge in licentiousness and perversion,\nAnd rebel against the arts of shamans.\nFrom minor to grave offenses,\nThe Three Officials wield their brushes,\nThe Great Unity dispatches documents,\nAnd the matter is handed to the Bureau of Five Thunders for execution and interrogation.\nFirst, the spirit is struck down;\nThen, the form is examined.\nThe spirit is beheaded, the soul condemned,\nCausing them to fall into chaos.\nWhat people despise, they are made to endure;\nWhat people detest, they are forced to suffer.\nTheir resentment and hatred are met with interrogation of the form and thunderous punishment of the corpse,\nShattering them to pieces.\nThey are driven to roll in waves,\nCompelled to pull carts,\nTheir names recorded in the monthly and decadal registers,\nAnd further subjected to torture.\nYet upon hearing this scripture, their sins are instantly erased.\n\nShould one incur the wrath of thunder,\nTheir corpse left unburied,\nUnaccepted by water or fire—\nInvoke the name of the Nine Heavens’ Responsive Thunderous Voice,\nThe Universally Transformative Heavenly Worthy,\nAnd declare:\n“All spirits bow their heads and heed my command.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said:\nThe merits of this scripture are beyond conception.\n\nIn the kalpas of old, the Divine Sovereign of Jade Clarity of the Divine Empyrean, the Great Emperor of Long Life, once proclaimed this teaching. When transmitting this scripture to the worthy, one must cut gold and place silk offerings, swearing an oath to Heaven before passing it on.\n\nThe Thunder Master, the Venerable Lord Hao, rose in reverence, knelt, and respectfully addressed the Heavenly Worthy once more. The Heavenly Worthy said: Wherever this scripture resides, the local earth gods and life-mandating spirits shall guard and protect it, while the Thunder Department shall oversee and inspect it in due time. If a household possesses this scripture and reverently enshrines it, auspicious mist will fill their courtyard, felicitous clouds will shade their halls, misfortune and chaos will not arise, and blessings will gather. Upon their passing, they shall not enter hell. Why is this so? At death, they shall be reborn; in life, they shall return to the good Dao, inheriting the Heavenly Worthy’s power and attaining this numinous penetration. Carrying this scripture in their comings and goings, all people will revere them, and ghosts and spirits will stand in awe. When encountering peril or hardship, if they single-mindedly invoke the name of the Universally Transformative Heavenly Worthy of the Responsive Thunderous Voice of the Nine Heavens, they shall all be liberated.\n\nThereupon, the Thunder Master, the Venerable Lord Hao, before the Heavenly Worthy, spoke this gatha:\n\nSupreme Sovereign of Jade Clarity,\nWho governs the thirty-six heavens.\nUniversally Transformative Lord of the Nine Heavens,\nWhose forms pervade the ten directions.\nWith unbound hair, riding a qilin,\nBarefoot treading upon layered ice.\nGrasping the qi of the Nine Heavens,\nWhistling winds and lashing thunder.\nWith the power of wisdom,\nSubduing all demonic spirits.\nDelivering souls from eternal night,\nBestowing benefit upon all beings.\nLike the silver river’s waters,\nA thousand eyes, a thousand moon wheels.\nVowing in the ages to come,\nTo forever propagate the Heavenly Worthy’s teachings.\n\nWhen the Thunder Master, the Venerable Lord Hao, finished reciting this gatha, the Heavenly Worthy said: This scripture has been transmitted through the world, yet people remain unaware. In the Nine Heavens’ Responsive Palace that I govern, there are the Envoys of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder Gate, assisted by those who compile records and those who conduct investigations. There are also four bureaus: the first is the Bureau of Excessive Punishment, the second the Bureau of Accumulated Arrests, the third the Bureau of Hidden Wrongs, and the fourth the Bureau of Timely Retribution, each overseen by a grand minister. All whom I govern—my ministers, masters, and envoys—assist in the primordial transformation.\n\nWhen the Heavenly Worthy finished speaking this scripture, the seven-jeweled layered terrace of Jade Brahma was adorned with cascading celestial flowers and fragrant vapors of sacred incense. The Heavenly Lords of the ten directions all exclaimed, “Excellent!” The devas, dragons, ghosts, and spirits, the officials of the Thunder Department, and the myriad spirits of the three realms rejoiced greatly, faithfully receiving and upholding the teaching.\n\nOṃ hūṃ traṭ hriḥ vaḷa.\nHere ends *The Jade Pivot Precious Scripture of the Universally Transformative Heavenly Worthy of the Responsive Thunderous Voice of the Nine Heavens*.",

If you truly wish to hear, know that the unhearing is the unhearing, and the seeing is the true Dao. To open sight is also to dissolve it—it is yours alone. You are not even ‘you,’ how much less the Dao? To hear without hearing—what Dao is there to discuss?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: “The Dao is entered through sincerity, guarded through silence, and employed through softness. To use sincerity is to seem foolish; to use silence is to seem inarticulate; to use softness is to seem clumsy. Only thus can you forget form, forget self, forget even forgetting. Those who enter the Dao know when to stop; those who guard the Dao know caution; those who employ the Dao know subtlety. Knowing subtlety, wisdom’s light arises; knowing caution, sagely wisdom is complete; knowing when to stop, perfect stability and peace are attained. With perfect stability and peace, sagely wisdom is complete; with sagely wisdom complete, wisdom’s light arises; with wisdom’s light arisen, one becomes one with the Dao—this is called true forgetting. Only in forgetting yet not forgetting, in forgetting what cannot be forgotten, does the un-forgettable become the supreme Dao.\n\nThe Dao pervades heaven and earth, yet heaven and earth do not know it. Sentient and insentient alike—there is but one, without duality.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy asked: “How shall I now benefit beings in this world? For all gods and humans, I expound this wondrous treasure. Those who awaken to it shall ascend the immortal’s throne. Students of the Dao, believe in the workings of qi and destiny. For lands and climates differ, and thus endowments vary—this is called qi. For wisdom and folly differ, and thus purity and turbidity vary—this is called destiny. Destiny is bound to fate; qi is struck by heaven. Constrained by qi and destiny, fettered by heavenly mandate, one cannot attain the true Dao. Yet the foolish may become wise, the turbid may become clear—this is decreed by fate. Foolishness is dull, turbidity is dark—these too shift with the endowments of land and climate.\n\nHeaven and earth move by their mechanism, causing people to remain unaware—this is called spontaneity. To know that one does not know is also called spontaneity. The wonder of spontaneity, though wondrous in knowledge, is wondrous precisely because it arises from not-knowing. Yet in relation to the Dao, it has never begun to exist—through the foolish and the turbid. All the gods heard this, and the four assemblies rejoiced.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: “What I have now spoken is the *Precious Scripture of the Jade Pivot.*”",

      "translated_text": "The Heavenly Worthy said: *\"The nine numinous spirits within the body—why not summon them? The first is Celestial Birth, the second Immaculate Radiance, the third Mystic Pearl, the fourth Central Upright, the fifth Child Cinnabar, the sixth Revolving Wheel, the seventh Cinnabar Prime, the eighth Great Abyss, the ninth Numinous Youth. Summon them, and all shall be auspicious. The three essences within the body—why not invoke them? The first is Terrace Light, the second Luminous Clarity, the third Secluded Essence. Invoke them, and blessings shall follow. When the five centers grow vexed and stifled, when the six pulses surge in tumult, when the four limbs lose their peace, when the hundred joints cry out in distress—recite this scripture.*\n\n*The Heavenly Worthy said: Should one encounter adversity in the Five Phases, peril in the Nine Luminaries, a year of punishment and clash, a fate of mutual conquest, solitary stars and bereft constellations, the Blade of Yang and the Edge of the Sword, the Calamity of Robbery and the Spirit of Death, the Ghost Gate’s twisting coils, the ruin of one’s allotted fortune, the Steed’s fall into emptiness—every movement fraught with danger, every step mired in misfortune—recite this scripture. Then shall the Heavenly Officials dispel celestial misfortune, the Earthly Officials quell terrestrial woes, the Water Officials resolve aquatic perils, the Five Emperors dissolve the afflictions of the five directions, the Four Sages dissolve the afflictions of the four seasons, the Southern Star dissolve the afflictions of one’s natal fate, and the Northern Dipper dissolve all misfortunes.*\n\n*The Heavenly Worthy said: When chronic illness confines one to bed, when stubborn ailments weigh upon the body, when time accumulates without relief, when physicians’ efforts prove futile, when the five spirits lose their governance and the four great elements scatter—whether before the Five Emperors and the Three Officials, before the Five Paths of Mount Tai, before the sun, moon, and stars, before the mountains, forests, grasses, and trees, before sacred altars and ancient sites, before city gods and village shrines, before the wells and hearths of lanes and alleys, before the temples, pagodas, and towers—or whether in the Thirty-Six Prisons of the Underworld or the Seventy-Two Bureaus of the Nether Officials, where grievances abound—recite this scripture. Or if the cause lies in oaths, curses, or vows, or in debts unpaid and obligations unmet; if enmity spans three lifetimes or grudges stretch across kalpas, if faults and transgressions accumulate, if karmic adversaries stand in opposition—confess and repent, then recite this scripture.*\n\n*The Heavenly Worthy said: The Heavenly Officials’ talismans, the Earthly Officials’ talismans. Each year, month, day, and hour bears its own official talisman. Every direction and orientation bears its own official talisman. Great matters bring official talismans; small matters bring gossip—governed by the gods of the Red Mouth and the White Tongue. In all actions and undertakings, in going out and returning, in rising and resting, if one fails to observe taboos and avoid offenses, encountering official talismans or slanderous tongues, one shall suffer harassment, day and night tormented as if scorched, lips and words entangled. Faces may affirm while backs deny, and every movement invites dispute. Swearing by gods and cursing the Buddha begin with slander and defamation, end in abuse and vilification—thus lawsuits arise, and punishments await. To escape such fate, recite this scripture, and slander shall vanish like mist, official talismans forever stilled.*\n\n*The Heavenly Worthy said: The Nine Mounds of the Earth Sovereign are governed by one thousand two hundred spirits—Earth Lords and Earth Earls, Earth Lords and Earth Ladies, Earth Children and Earth Grandchildren, the Earthly household and its kin. Whether the Grand Year-Star, the General, the Crane Spirit, Venus, the Nine Excellencies, the Sword’s Edge, the Male and Female, the Metal Spirit, the Fire and Blood, the Yellow Body, the Colliding Fate, the Three Calamities, the Seven Calamities, the Yellow Banner and Leopard’s Tail, the Flying Blade and Anvil—all such earthly spirits and baleful stars. Should one undertake construction or choose a dwelling site and offend them, illness and even death shall follow. But recite this scripture, and the myriad spirits shall rise; heaven shall hold no taboos, earth shall hold no taboos, yin and yang shall hold no taboos, and all prohibitions shall be lifted.*\n\n*The Heavenly Worthy said: Among the world’s husbands and wives, in their unions, some offend the Salty Pond, some the Heavenly Dog, some the Three Punishments and Six Harms, some the clashing angles of isolation and bereavement, some the snares of the Heavenly Net and Earthly Web—struggling to bear descendants, often left solitary and childless. Should one seek a son, recite this scripture, and the Great Spirit of Celestial Birth shall summon the spirits and gather the winds, bringing forth a worthy child. At the hour of birth, the Great Unity stands at the door, the Controller of Fate in the courtyard. Should grievances, ghosts, or malevolent spirits intrude, should taboos or misfortunes arise, causing difficult labor—recite this scripture, and the Nine Heavens’ Guardians of the Chamber shall attend, the Holy Mother silently aiding in the delivery, ensuring a joyous birth and a safe labor. For all infants in swaddling, tormented by the fifteen kinds of ghosts beneath the Sandalwood Spirit King’s throne, suffering convulsions and seizures—recite this scripture.*\n\n*The Heavenly Worthy said: When one’s dwelling is plagued by crows and rats bearing omens, by snakes and insects bearing afflictions, by bricks and tiles hurled in malice, by startled chickens and mischievous dogs, by demands for sacrifices—even to the point of spectral coercion and dream oppression, or theft and adultery—dare these spirits claim the dwelling as their lair, bewitching the living. The courtyard and home grow unclean; wailing echoes through the beams by night, spying eyes peer into the chamber by day. Cattle, horses, dogs, and swine suffer pestilence; calamity clings to kin, disaster befalls livestock. Wicked shrines and demonic cults gather, evil spirits and sorcerers conspire, funeral guests arrive in droves, funeral carriages depart in succession. Recite this scripture, and ghostly spirits shall perish, people and creatures alike shall know peace.*\n\n*The Heavenly Worthy said: The Generals of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder, the Generals of the Five Directions’ Thunder, the Generals of the Eight Directions’ Cloud and Thunder, the Envoys of the Five Directions’ Barbarian Thunder, the Thunder Department’s Soldiers and Envoys, the Adjudicating Officials—issuing commands swift as wind and fire. Where there are temples to be struck, altars to be smitten, demons to be expelled, and malevolent spirits to be banished—in this degenerate age of the Dharma’s end, with sorcerers and shamans proliferating, dark arts spreading, and secret curses rampant—thus does the Upper Clarity possess the Celestial Court for Binding Ghosts and Recording Transgressions, the Imperial Prison for Restraining Demons and Interrogating Evil.

When transmitting this scripture to the worthy, one must cut gold and place silk offerings, swearing an oath to Heaven before passing it on.\n\nThe Thunder Master, the Venerable Lord Hao, rose in reverence, knelt, and respectfully addressed the Heavenly Worthy once more. The Heavenly Worthy said: Wherever this scripture resides, the local earth gods and life-mandating spirits shall guard and protect it, while the Thunder Department shall oversee and inspect it in due time. If a household possesses this scripture and reverently enshrines it, auspicious mist will fill their courtyard, felicitous clouds will shade their halls, misfortune and chaos will not arise, and blessings will gather. Upon their passing, they shall not enter hell. Why is this so? At death, they shall be reborn; in life, they shall return to the good Dao, inheriting the Heavenly Worthy’s power and attaining this numinous penetration. Carrying this scripture in their comings and goings, all people will revere them, and ghosts and spirits will stand in awe. When encountering peril or hardship, if they single-mindedly invoke the name of the Universally Transformative Heavenly Worthy of the Responsive Thunderous Voice of the Nine Heavens, they shall all be liberated.\n\nThereupon, the Thunder Master, the Venerable Lord Hao, before the Heavenly Worthy, spoke this gatha:\n\nSupreme Sovereign of Jade Clarity,\nWho governs the thirty-six heavens.\nUniversally Transformative Lord of the Nine Heavens,\nWhose forms pervade the ten directions.\nWith unbound hair, riding a qilin,\nBarefoot treading upon layered ice.\nGrasping the qi of the Nine Heavens,\nWhistling winds and lashing thunder.\nWith the power of wisdom,\nSubduing all demonic spirits.\nDelivering souls from eternal night,\nBestowing benefit upon all beings.\nLike the silver river’s waters,\nA thousand eyes, a thousand moon wheels.\nVowing in the ages to come,\nTo forever propagate the Heavenly Worthy’s teachings.\n\nWhen the Thunder Master, the Venerable Lord Hao, finished reciting this gatha, the Heavenly Worthy said: This scripture has been transmitted through the world, yet people remain unaware. In the Nine Heavens’ Responsive Palace that I govern, there are the Envoys of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder Gate, assisted by those who compile records and those who conduct investigations. There are also four bureaus: the first is the Bureau of Excessive Punishment, the second the Bureau of Accumulated Arrests, the third the Bureau of Hidden Wrongs, and the fourth the Bureau of Timely Retribution, each overseen by a grand minister. All whom I govern—my ministers, masters, and envoys—assist in the primordial transformation.\n\nWhen the Heavenly Worthy finished speaking this scripture, the seven-jeweled layered terrace of Jade Brahma was adorned with cascading celestial flowers and fragrant vapors of sacred incense. The Heavenly Lords of the ten directions all exclaimed, “Excellent!” The devas, dragons, ghosts, and spirits, the officials of the Thunder Department, and the myriad spirits of the three realms rejoiced greatly, faithfully receiving and upholding the teaching.\n\nOṃ hūṃ traṭ hriḥ vaḷa.\nHere ends *The Jade Pivot Precious Scripture of the Universally Transformative Heavenly Worthy of the Responsive Thunderous Voice of the Nine Heavens*.",
      "overlap_context": "recorded in the monthly and decadal registers,\nAnd further subjected to torture.\nYet upon hearing this scripture, their sins are instantly erased.\n\nShould one incur the wrath of thunder,\nTheir corpse left unburied,\nUnaccepted by water or fire—\nInvoke the name of the Nine Heavens’ Responsive Thunderous Voice,\nThe Universally Transformative Heavenly Worthy,\nAnd declare:\n“All spirits bow their heads and heed my command.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said:\nThe merits of this scripture are beyond conception.",
