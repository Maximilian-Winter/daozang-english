  "full_translation": "**The Complete Exegesis of the *Dao De Jing* (Moral and Virtue Classic)**\n*Original Title: The Golden Era’s Exegesis by Shí Yōng*\n*Two Volumes: Upper and Lower*\n*Source Edition: The *Zhèngtǒng Dàozàng* (Orthodox Daoist Canon), *Dòngshén* (Cavernous Spirit) Section, *Yùjué* (Jade Precepts) Class*\n\n*The Lower Volume’s Commentary is Identical to the Anonymous *Exegesis of the Dao De Jing* (Lower Volume)*\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *The Complete Exegesis of the Dao De Jing***\n\nThe Five-Thousand-Character *Mixed Primordial* [text], with commentaries circulating in the world, are numerous. Yet they all dissect chapter by chapter, sentence by sentence, failing to weave a coherent whole—mere clever conjectures and fabricated interpretations, not the fruit of true enlightenment. Thus, the profound words and hidden meanings remain obscured, stifled and unexpressed. Readers, bewildered by their multiplicity, know not where to turn.\n\nThen, a person from Huà returned to Zhēnzhēn after wandering in Huá, presenting *The Complete Exegesis of the Dao De* to me—its author unknown. Upon careful contemplation, my understanding opened like a floodgate; long-standing doubts dissolved like ice in spring. Inner and outer harmonized, the meaning flowed like strung pearls, transcending ordinary thought by tenfold measures—*#1*—far beyond the grasp of worldly scholarship.\n\nIndeed, the lofty Immortals and Perfected Ones, moved by pity for the ignorant masses, unveiled the deepest mysteries. As the *Dao* is hidden and nameless, yet its benevolent transmission flourishes—such is their work.\n\nHaving received this text, I could not bear to hoard it alone. Thus, I urged my friends Shí Jīn and others, gathered the devoted, commissioned artisans to engrave the plates, and spread its teachings far and wide.\n\nIn the *Zhènglòng* era, the fourth year, when the year *Dānruò* began in the first month, Shí Yōng of the Huà Community, in leisurely repose, wrote this preface.\n\n*#1* **陪 (péi):** Likely a corruption; should read **\"倍\" (bèi, \"tenfold\").**\n\n---\n\n**Volume One of *The Complete Exegesis of the Dao De Jing***\n*Exegesis by Shí Yōng of the Huà Community, in Leisurely Repose*\n\n**Chapter One: \"The Dao That Can Be Spoken Of\"**\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao;\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal Name.\n\nThe nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;\nThe named is the mother of all things.\n\nEver without desire, one observes its subtlety;\nEver with desire, one observes its peril.\n\nThese two, though issuing from the same source, bear different names—\nYet both are called the Mysterious.\nThe Mysterious beyond the Mysterious—\nThe gateway through which all subtleties emerge.\n\nThe Dao is the void, the natural and spontaneous.\nBecause it is natural, it endures;\nIf forced, it perishes.\n\nTo call it the Dao is but to impose a name—\nHow can this be its true nature?\n\nYet if it can be named, then there exists what cannot be named—\nThis is the *you* (酉).\n\nHeaven can be Heaven but cannot be Earth;\nEarth can be Earth but cannot be Heaven.\nAbove and below differ in position;\nSquare and round differ in form.\nThus, departing from the origin, Heaven and Earth arise—\nThis is the Dao that can be spoken of, yet not the eternal Dao.\n\nDispersed, it becomes rivers and seas;\nCondensed, it becomes mountains and peaks.\nBirds and beasts fly and walk;\nGrasses and trees blossom and bear fruit.\nThus, descending from the origin and flowing to the end,\nAll things are born—\nThis is the name that can be named, yet not the eternal Name.\n\nThe eternal Dao is the undifferentiated unity of yin and yang,\nBefore their separation, when they were one.\nFrom this oneness arises the One yet unformed—\nNo name can be given to it,\nThus it is nameless, the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe eternal Name is when yin and yang divide,\nAnd Heaven and Earth emerge.\nOnly then do all things arise,\nThus it is named, the mother of all things.\n\nOnly the Dao of Heaven is called the eternal \"without\":\nTo embody Heaven’s Dao is to be without desire and without action;\nTo embody Earth’s Dao is to be without movement and ever still.\n\nTo harmonize Heaven and Earth’s Dao with humanity,\nOne attains the pure and harmonious *qi* to become perfect.\nThe greatest perfection is ineffable and inexpressible—\nYet it governs the world and brings peace to the people,\nAs does the Dao of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThus, for those above, without desire,\nThe people become pure and tranquil, transformed.\nTo cultivate what is beautiful as beautiful—\nIts fullness cannot be exhausted.\n\nThis Dao is pure and uncarved,\nThus the Dao that can be spoken of cannot truly be spoken—\nYet it aligns with the eternal Dao.\n\nEver without desire, one observes its subtlety:\nBecause one remains ever still and unmoving,\nThe form returns to the center, the spirit undispersed—\nThus the eternal Dao reveals its subtlety.\n\nThe subtlety is motionless and ever tranquil;\nGreat transformation unfolds in the world,\nAs the body, unspoiled, finds joy—\nPreserving the True One, its subtlety is nameless.\n\nAs for a land with a ruler,\nIf the ruler desires nothing,\nThe people desire nothing—\nThus arises the pure and thick virtue, untainted.\nHence, ever without desire, one observes its subtlety.\n\nIf one embodies Earth’s Dao and returns to the origin,\nThen the ever-present becomes visible—\nDesire is observed to perceive its peril.\n\nThese two—Heaven and Earth’s Dao—\nBoth arise from the One,\nThus they are said to issue from the same source yet bear different names.\nThough issuing from the same source, they are both called the Mysterious.\n\nThe Mysterious contains red and black:\n*Qián* is red, *Kūn* is black,\nBoth hidden within the *Huáng* (皇).\nThis is the *Huáng Tiān*, the *Huáng Dì*.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth\nGathers *qi* at the Upper Primordial—\nThus the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious.\nThe Mysterious beyond the Mysterious is called the Great *Fán* (梵).\n\nThe Heaven within Heaven,\nDescending to govern the human body’s *ní wán* (泥丸) and *jiàng gōng* (绛宫),\nRegulating the Five *Qi* and blending the Hundred Spirits,\nThrough which all subtleties enter and exit—\nThus it is called the gateway of all subtleties.\n\nIf one can cultivate purity, stillness, and embrace the One,\nPreserving and guarding the *Xuándū* (玄都),\nThen one attains the eternal Dao.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Two: \"When All Under Heaven Know\"**\n\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,\nThen ugliness arises;\nWhen all know goodness as goodness,\nThen wickedness arises.\n\nThus, being and non-being give rise to each other,\nDifficulty and ease define each other,\nLong and short give form to each other,\nHigh and low complement each other,\nSounds harmonize with each other,\nBefore and after follow each other.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts without action,\nTeaches without speech.\nAll things arise without resistance,\nAre born without possession,\nAct without reliance,\nAnd when the deed is done, takes no credit.\nBecause he does not take credit,\nHis virtue does not depart.\n\nBeauty and goodness are the natural Dao of Heaven and Earth—\nAll under Heaven knows them.\nYet when beauty is recognized as beauty,\nThen ugliness arises.\nWhen goodness is recognized as goodness,\nThen wickedness arises—\nWhy is this?\n\nHeaven and Earth give birth to the forms of things,\nYet these forms are never without beauty.\nBecause things have birth, death, and decay—\nLike the divine and the putrid, the return and transformation—\nThen what was once beautiful becomes loathsome.\n\nHeaven and Earth give birth to the spirit of humanity,\nYet this spirit is never without goodness.\nBecause humanity possesses external wisdom—\nLike reconciling great grudges, yet leaving lingering resentment—\nThen goodness splits into wickedness.\n\nOnce beauty and goodness are distinguished,\nThey no longer align with the Dao of non-action.\nThus, one and the other transform each other,\nMeeting only to invert—\nHence the following text illustrates this.\n\nBeing and non-being give rise to each other\nBecause the eternal Dao is formless—\nThere is the logic of being and non-being generating each other,\nThus there are difficult and easy matters to define.\n\nLong and short give form to each other\nBecause Earth’s Dao has no corners—\nThere are measures of long and short to define,\nThus there are inclinations of high and low.\n\nSounds harmonize with each other\nBecause Heaven’s Dao is subtle in sound—\nThere are musical tones to harmonize,\nThus there are responses of before and after.\n\nOnly the Sage understands the transformations of beauty and ugliness,\nThe burdens of goodness and wickedness—\nThus he embodies the natural Dao of Heaven and Earth,\nActing without action,\nTeaching without speech.\n\nOnly by teaching without speech\nDo all things arise without resistance.\nThus, holding the left tablet but not demanding compliance from others—\nWho then would be wicked?\n\nThis is called knowing the good throughout the heavens.\nOnly by dwelling in non-action\nDoes one give birth yet not possess,\nAct yet not rely upon,\nComplete deeds yet not claim them.\nThus, one entrusts things to their natural unfolding,\nWithout harboring private intentions—\nWho then would be blameworthy?\n\nThis is called knowing beauty throughout the heavens.\nBecause one acts without resistance,\nOne allows things to arise spontaneously—\nThough born yet not possessed,\nThough acting yet not relied upon,\nThough having merit yet not dwelling upon it.\n\nBorn yet not possessed—this is the Earth’s Dao.\nActing yet not relying—this is Heaven’s Dao.\nCompleting deeds yet not claiming them—this is the Constant Dao.\nEmbodying these three,\nThus within oneself there is no dwelling,\nThings cannot displace it—\nWhat then could depart?\n\nHence it is said:\nOnly by not dwelling does one not depart.\n\n**Chapter Three: Not Honoring the Worthy**\nNot honoring the worthy, so the people do not contend;\nNot valuing rare treasures, so the people do not steal;\nNot displaying what is desirable, so the heart does not stray.\nThus the Sage’s governance:\nEmpties the mind, fills the belly,\nWeakens the will, strengthens the bones.\nEver keeps the people without knowledge, without desire,\nSo even the wise dare not act.\n\nActing in non-action,\nThen nothing remains untended.\n\nThe worthy have intelligence—\nHonor them, and the people contend.\nMerchants have desires—\nValue their goods, and thieves multiply.\nThe worthy are names,\nMerchants are profits—\nNothing more desirable to people than names and profits.\nSince neither is honored nor valued,\nThis is called not displaying what is desirable.\n\nNot displaying what is desirable,\nThen the spirit guards the form—\nHow could the heart then be disordered?\n\nThus the Sage does not honor the worthy,\nEmbodying Heaven’s lack of knowledge;\nDoes not value goods,\nFollowing Earth’s lack of desire.\nEmbodying Heaven, the mind is emptied,\nFollowing Earth, the belly is filled—\nThe mind’s emptiness weakens the will,\nThe belly’s fullness strengthens the bones.\nThus ever keeping the people without knowledge, without desire,\nEven great worthies, though wise,\nAre subdued by the Sage and dare not act in contrivance.\n\nThis is called: Acting in non-action, then nothing remains untended.\n\n**Chapter Four: The Dao’s Pervasiveness**\nThe Dao is pervading yet used without excess,\nSometimes not full—\nDeep, like the origin of all things.\nBlunting its sharpness,\nUntangling its complications,\nDulling its brilliance,\nAligning with the dust—\nSerene, as if it exists.\n\nI do not know whose child it is,\nBefore the Imperial Sovereign.\n\nThe Dao in Heaven,\nUsing non-action,\nHence it is called the pervading Dao.\nPervading—\nEmpty yet containing all things.\nYet great fullness is like emptiness,\nBecause it can contain all things,\nThus it is not full yet overflows.\n\nThe Dao in Earth,\nWith stillness as its essence,\nHence it is called deep.\nDeep—\nProfound yet unfathomable.\nYet all things depend upon it,\nYet do not know their source,\nThus it seems like the origin.\n\nIf one embodies Heaven’s Dao,\nPervading, empty, tranquil—\nBlunting sharpness;\nEmbodying Earth’s Dao,\nDeep, still, quiescent—\nUntangling complications.\nBlunting sharpness—\nIts upper reaches harmonize light without dazzling—\nIs this not the Dao in Heaven?\nUntangling complications—\nIts lower reaches aligns with dust without filth—\nIs this not the Dao in Earth?\n\nThe Dao in Heaven and Earth,\nPervading, empty, deep—\nSerene, indeed it exists.\nThough called existing,\nIn Heaven it sometimes exists,\nIn Earth it seems to exist—\nHence it is called \"seemingly existing.\"\n\nFrom the primordial beginning of ages past,\nThus unknown whose child transformed into all heavens—\nThis is called before the Imperial Sovereign.\n\n**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth’s Lack of Ren**\nHeaven and Earth lack *ren*—\nThey treat all things as sacrificial straw dogs;\nThe Sage lacks *ren*—\nHe treats the people as sacrificial straw dogs.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nIs it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet not exhausted,\nMoving yet ever producing.\n\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion,\nBetter to hold to the center.\n\nSeven—\nThis is the human heart.\nLacking *ren*, it is ever without attachment.\nOnly ever without attachment,\nThus though there is the reality of love and benefit,\nThere is no burden of love and benefit—\nThis is why Heaven, Earth, and the Sage treat all things and the people as sacrificial straw dogs.\n\nBinding straw to make a dog,\nFor use in sacrifices—\nWhen appropriate, it is used,\nThus there is the reality of love and benefit;\nWhen over, it is discarded,\nThus there is no burden of love and benefit.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, like a valley—\nAlso because of its lack of attachment and central emptiness,\nThus it is like a bellows.\nThe bellows is empty yet can receive,\nReceiving yet can respond,\nEmerging from lack of attachment,\nThus it does not exhaust,\nMoving yet ever producing.\n\nIf those who act without response,\nEmerging from attachment,\nThen much speech yet cannot avoid burden—\nThus they exhaust.\nIf one embodies Heaven and Earth’s lack of attachment,\nGuarding the pervading, empty, tranquil Dao,\nNaturally attaining the spirit,\nThen responding only after stimulation—\nWhat exhaustion could there be?\n\n**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit’s Immortality**\nThe Valley Spirit does not die—\nThis is called the Mysterious Female.\nThe Mysterious Female’s gate—\nThis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nEndless, as if it exists,\nUsing it is effortless.\n\nThe world’s people know only mountain and marsh valleys,\nYet do not know what is called the Valley of the World—\nHeaven and Earth are this.\n\nHeaven and Earth lack attachment yet are centrally empty,\nBearing the form of a valley.\nHeaven and Earth can generate and transform,\nCalled the Ultimate Spirit.\nOnly the Spirit,\nResponding and thus communicating,\nAlso like the valley’s emptiness in responding—\nThus it is called the Valley Spirit.\n\nYet the generator does not generate itself,\nThe transformer does not transform itself—\nThus it endures, hence the Valley Spirit does not die.\n\nHeaven, though generating,\nIts power to generate things is the Mysterious.\nEarth, though transforming,\nIts power to transform things is the Female.\nThus it is called the Mysterious Female.\n\nThe Mysterious Female—\nIs it not yin and yang?\nBefore yin and yang harmonize and do not yet divide,\nWho then is Heaven and Earth?\nOnly when yin and yang separate do Heaven and Earth emerge,\nThus Heaven and Earth enter and exit through this—\nHence it is called the gate of the Mysterious Female,\nThis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe root of Heaven and Earth—\nBefore Heaven and Earth exist,\nIt has ever been preserved since antiquity,\nHence it is called *Mianmian* [enduring like fine silk] as if it exists.\n\nIf such is the case—\nResponding only after being moved,\nNever acting before things,\nHow could there be any laboriousness?\n\nHence it is called *Use it not with effort*.\n\nThe Dao in Heaven and Earth is thus:\nHumans, in appearance resembling Heaven and Earth,\nAlso have the *Nine Cauldrons* [泥九] to respond to it.\n\nThe *Nine Cauldrons*—\nThese are the Valley Spirit within me,\nCalled the *Kunlun Mountains* [昆仑之山].\nWithin lies the *square-inch elixir field* [丹田], connected to the *seven orifices* [七窍],\nKnown as the *Heavenly Valley* [天谷],\nWhere the *Divine Man* [神人] resides.\n\nThe elixir field within is round, responding to Heaven,\nThe field without is square, responding to Earth—\nThus the meaning of the Mysterious Female.\n\nYet, the *Thirty-five Divisions* [三十五分],\nCollecting the *Upper Original Qi* [上元],\nThis is called the *Heavenly Root* [天根].\nIf one can embody the Dao within oneself,\nThen one attains eternal life, unending,\nAnd aligns with Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Chapter Seven: Heaven and Earth Enduring and Long-lasting**\nHeaven and Earth endure and last,\nThe reason Heaven and Earth can endure and last—\nIs that they do not generate themselves,\nHence they can attain eternal life.\nThus, the Sage allows his body to be last, yet it is first,\nRejects his body outwardly, yet it is preserved.\nIs it not because they have no selfishness?\nHence they can fulfill their selfishness.\n\nThe Dao generates all things yet does not generate itself,\nHeaven and Earth resemble the Dao,\nHence they can endure and last—\nEnduring and lasting, then they endure and last forever.\n\nHeaven and Earth have no selfishness,\nHence they have no selfishness—\nThe Sage embodies Heaven and Earth,\nHence he can fulfill his selfishness—\nFulfilling his selfishness, his body is first yet preserved.\n\n*Allowing his body to be last*—\nThis means not contending with things.\n*Rejecting his body outwardly*—\nThis means preserving his spirit.\nThis is called embodying Heaven and Earth’s lack of selfishness.\n\nHeaven’s utmost selfishness,\nYet its use is most public—\nIs this not its effect?\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Good Resembles Water**\nThe supreme good resembles water,\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend,\nDwelling where people revile—\nHence it is close to the Dao.\n\nIts dwelling is good,\nIts heart is deep,\nIts giving is generous,\nIts speech is trustworthy,\nIts governance is clear,\nIts deeds are skilled,\nIts actions are timely.\n\nOnly because it does not contend,\nHence it has no blame.\nWater’s nature—\nIf not held, then clear,\nIf not stirred, then calm,\nIf stagnant and blocked, unable to flow,\nIt also cannot be clear—\nThis reflects Heaven’s virtue,\nHence the supreme good resembles water.\n\nWater benefits all things,\nClose to Heaven and Earth’s Dao,\nYet all these are actions fitting their measure,\nHence it is called *actions are timely*.\nActions fitting their measure—\nHow could there be any contention?\nThis is why it has no blame.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Holding Yet Filling It**\nHolding yet filling it,\nNot as good as letting it be;\nPushing yet sharpening it,\nCannot long endure.\n\nGold and jade fill the hall,\nYet none can guard them;\nRich and noble yet arrogant,\nThey bring ruin upon themselves.\n\nWhen achievement is complete,\nAnd name is established,\nRetire in body—\nThis is Heaven’s Way.\n\nFilling cannot last,\nBetter not to desire filling—\nWhy must one hold it?\n\nAdvancing swiftly, retreating quickly,\nBetter to blunt its sharpness—\nWhy must one push it?\n\nGold and jade fill the hall,\nYet none can guard them—\nThis is because they are already full.\nRich and noble yet arrogant,\nThey bring ruin upon themselves—\nThis is because they are already sharp.\n\nThis is the loss of the *Way of Kindness and Modesty* [慈俭之道],\nHence there are the faults of excess and sharpness.\n\nExcess is achievement complete,\nSharpness is name established.\nOnce achievement is complete and name is established,\nThen there is the principle of retiring in body—\nThis is the movement of yin and yang’s advancing, retreating, excess, and deficiency.\n\nIf one can guard the *Way of Kindness and Modesty*,\nThen abandon achievement and name,\nReturn to the common people—\nHow could there be excess or sharpness?\n\n**Chapter Ten: Nurturing the Vital Essence and Spirit**\nNurturing the vital essence and spirit, embracing unity,\nCan one avoid separation?\nFocusing the qi to attain softness,\nCan one be like an infant?\nCleansing and purifying the Mysterious Vision,\nCan one avoid blemish?\nLoving the people and governing the state,\nCan one act without doing?\n\nHeaven’s gate opens and closes,\nCan one be female?\nBright and clear, reaching everywhere,\nCan one be without knowing?\n\nNurturing and storing life,\nGenerating yet not possessing,\nDoing yet not relying,\nLong-lasting yet not slaughtering—\nThis is called the *Mysterious Virtue* [玄德].\n\nThe body—\nThe spirit’s chariot,\nThe vital essence’s vehicle.\n\nThe soul ascends and moves,\nThe vital essence follows, entering and exiting—\nThus the spirit’s threads extend outward,\nAnd governance is directed toward action,\nHence the three souls are restless,\nAnd the vital essence is ever declining.\n\nOnly the Sage hides the spirit within,\nThus nurturing and storing it—\nThe vital essence does not follow the soul in reckless movement outward.\n\nThus, it can be the *Essentials of Vitality and Longevity* [卫生之经],\nHence it is called *Nurturing the Vital Essence and Spirit*.\n\nThe *Essentials of Vitality and Longevity*—\nHave no other secrets,\nYet do not depart from the three: *Essence* [精], *Qi* [气], *Spirit* [神].\n\nThose who can embrace unity,\nTheir essence does not tremble;\nThose who are like infants,\nTheir qi does not rage;\nThose who cleanse and purify thought,\nTheir spirit is preserved—\nThis is called embodying Heaven and Earth’s Dao.\n\nNot only this—\nThose who embody Heaven’s Dao,\nCan act without doing,\nLoving the people and governing the state,\nDesiring that they act without doing.\n\nThose who can act without doing in loving the people and governing the state,\nThen cleansing and purifying the Mysterious Vision—\nI act without doing,\nYet the people transform themselves.\n\nThose who embody Earth’s Dao,\nCan be female,\nHeaven’s gate opening and closing—\nDesiring that they be female.\n\nThose who can be female in the opening and closing of Heaven’s gate,\nThen focus the qi to attain softness—\nDay and night without sleep,\nThus attaining the truth.\n\nThose who embody the *Constant Dao* [常道],\nCan be without knowing,\nBright and clear, reaching everywhere—\nDesiring that they be without knowing.\n\nThose who can be without knowing in being bright and clear,\nThen gather vision and return hearing—\nEmbrace unity as a model for all under Heaven.\n\nIf such is the case,\nThen the essence is complete and unspent,\nThe qi harmonious and unrestrained,\nThe spirit clear and unblemished—\nThen virtue and Dao unite as one,\nMingling indistinctly, in great harmony with the boundless void.\n\nThat which gives life is the Dao.\nThat which nurtures is virtue.\nThe great virtue of Heaven and Earth is called *generation*—\nThis virtue, when spoken of in terms of the whole of Heaven and Earth,\nIs none other than the Dao itself.\n\nHeaven is the Mysterious,\nEarth is the Field—\nThus, nurturing follows them.\nEarth’s Dao generates yet does not generate itself,\nSo it generates yet does not possess.\nHeaven’s Dao acts without doing,\nSo it acts yet does not rely.\nThe Constant Dao fulfills and sustains,\nSo it sustains yet does not govern.\n\nThese three correspond to the *Dantian* at the crown of the head—\nThis is the virtue of Heaven.\n\nIn Heaven, it is the Mysterious—\nThus, the Mysterious Virtue is none other than Heaven’s Virtue.\nHeaven’s Virtue acts through non-action,\nAnd those who cultivate the spirit likewise rely on the absence of contrivance—\nHow could this virtue not be Heaven’s Virtue?\n\n**Thirty Spokes, Chapter Ten**\nThirty spokes converge at one hub;\nIt is the emptiness that gives the wheel its use.\nMold clay to make a vessel;\nIt is the emptiness that gives it utility.\nCarve doors and windows to make a room;\nIt is the emptiness that gives it space.\n\nThus, what is present brings advantage,\nBut what is absent brings use.\nThat which is ridden is the wheel’s motion alone;\nThat which is fitting is the vessel’s proper function;\nThat which is dwelt in is the room’s stillness.\n\nMovement is action,\nStillness is repose,\nAnd proper use lies between the two—\nThus the Sage elucidates the Dao through this.\n\nObserving these three,\nAll bear the symbol of external presence and internal absence—\nPresence is substance,\nAbsence is void,\nAbsence uses presence for advantage,\nPresence relies on absence for function.\nReflecting inward, one must resolve this within oneself.\n\nPresence is form,\nAbsence is spirit—\nSpirit generates form,\nSo form relies on spirit for function.\nForm shapes spirit,\nSo spirit relies on form for substance.\nWithout form, spirit cannot manifest,\nWithout spirit, form cannot complete itself.\nWhen form and spirit unite in harmony,\nThey mutually generate and fulfill—\nThen the Dao is preserved.\n\nYet how is it that spirit often loves humanity,\nWhile humanity does not love spirit,\nThus leading to early decline?\n\nTherefore, the virtuous cultivate a tranquil heart and preserve the spirit,\nMaintaining emptiness within.\n\n**Five Colors, Chapter Twelve**\nFive colors blind the eyes,\nFive tones deafen the ears,\nFive flavors dull the palate,\nGalloping hunts drive the mind to madness.\nRare treasures entangle one’s conduct.\n\nThus the Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes,\nAnd discards the former to take the latter.\n\nThat which is unseen is called *tranquil*—the Constant Dao.\nThe world’s people cannot gather vision inward,\nBut let the five colors dazzle the eyes externally,\nThus losing the Dao of the Primordial Beginning—\nHence, they are blind.\n\nThat which is unheard is called *subtle*—Heaven’s Dao.\nThe world’s people cannot return hearing to stillness,\nBut let the five tones assail the ears externally,\nThus losing the Dao of the First Origin—\nHence, they are deaf.\n\nThat which cannot be grasped is called *refined*—Earth’s Dao.\nThe world’s people cannot nourish qi from the Great Harmony,\nBut let the five flavors dominate the mouth,\nThus losing the Dao of the Great Simplicity—\nHence, they are dulled.\n\nThese three—\nLosing the inner guard of the inch-field,\nAnd wandering the mind—\nThus it is said that galloping hunts drive the mind to madness.\n\nOnce externally attached to things,\nAnd fixated on desires,\nOne becomes burdened in conduct—\nThus rare treasures entangle one’s steps.\n\nTherefore, the Sage, without knowing, nurtures virtue within,\nAnd though desires may appear,\nHe does not lose his nature externally—\nThus he fills the belly alone,\nAnd does not indulge the eyes.\n\nWhy speak of the eyes alone among these three?\nThe nine orifices and three vital gates—\nTheir mechanism lies in the eyes.\nThus, discard the external allure of sight,\nAnd take the inner substance of virtue.\n\n**Honor and Humiliation, Chapter Thirteen**\nHonor and humiliation are like a shock,\nTreasure great calamity as one’s own body.\n\nWhat is meant by *honor and humiliation*?\nHonor is lowly—\nTo gain it is like a shock,\nTo lose it is like a shock—\nThis is called *honor and humiliation as a shock*.\n\nWhat is meant by *treasuring great calamity as one’s own body*?\nMy great calamity arises because I have a body.\nIf I had no body, what calamity would I have?\n\nThus, to treasure the body for all under Heaven,\nIs to say that one may entrust all under Heaven.\nTo love the body for all under Heaven,\nIs to say that one may commit all under Heaven to it.\n\nHonor and humiliation arise from engagement with affairs.\nOnce engaged with affairs,\nThe spirit cannot guard internally—\nThus, it is like a shock.\n\nTreasure is virtue.\nEveryone has virtue within themselves,\nYet some burden their own virtue—\nThis is because they have a body,\nThus great calamity is like the body itself.\n\nHonor is being subject to others,\nThe way of being beneath others—\nTo have honor is to invite humiliation—\nThus, to gain it is to lose it.\n\nIf one clings to it with the mind, one fears losing it;\nIf one abandons it with the mind, one grieves its loss.\nUnable to guard internally within things,\nThis is why it is like a shock.\n\n*I* refers to the sovereign above all things,\nThe title of virtue’s summit.\n\nMy great calamity arises because I have a body,\nAnd thus burden my virtue.\n\nTo have a body is to serve all under Heaven.\nIf one serves all under Heaven,\nThen form burdens the mind,\nAnd the mind burdens virtue,\nLosing what commands all things—\nThus, no calamity is greater.\n\nIf one does not use all under Heaven as a burden,\nThen one takes emptiness as the body,\nAnd does not let the body become a burden—\nThis is the *body without a body*—\nAnd what calamity could there be?\n\nThe common folk are confused by presence and absence,\nAnd do not know the principle of the bodiless.\nThus, the following analogy is given.\n\nMoreover, to treasure the body for all under Heaven,\nIs to treasure what is entrusted to the body—\nThus, those who awaken to the Dao\nMay entrust all under Heaven—\nWhat calamity could there be?\n\nAgain, to love the body for all under Heaven,\nIs to entrust honor to the body—\nThus, those who attain the Dao\nMay commit all under Heaven to it—\nWhat humiliation could there be?\n\nKnowing that coming and going are not mine,\nNot burdening the body with oneself,\nForgetting all things in heart and mind,\nNot prideful of honor—\nThus the gentleman, when forced to govern all under Heaven,\nDoes so as if entrusting it—\nThis is called *not using all under Heaven as a burden*.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Formless Form**\n\nWhat cannot be seen is called *Yī* (均),\nWhat cannot be heard is called *Xī* (希),\nWhat cannot be grasped is called *Wēi* (微).\nThese three cannot be summoned or invited,\nThus they merge into one.\n\nAbove, it does not blaze,\nBelow, it does not obscure—\n*Shéngshéng* (绳绳) it cannot be named,\nReturning once more to the formless.\n\nThis is called the *state without state*,\nThe *symbol without substance*—\nThis is called *huǎnghū* (恍惚).\nApproach it, and you see no head,\nFollow it, and you see no tail.\n\nHolding to the ancient Dao,\nTo govern the present with the formless.\nAble to know the ancient beginning,\nThis is called *Dao jì* (道纪).\n\nThe Dao of the constant is the beginning of *Tài Chū* (太初),\nThus it is *Yī* (均) and cannot be seen.\nThe Dao of Heaven is the beginning of *Tài Shǐ* (太始),\nThus it is *Xī* (希) and cannot be heard.\nThe Dao of Earth is the beginning of *Tài Sù* (太素),\nThus it is *Wēi* (微) and cannot be grasped.\n\nThese three are the beginnings of *qì*, form, and substance—\nCannot be summoned or questioned,\nThus they merge into one.\n\nOne is the harmonized unity of *yīn* and *yáng* before division.\nAbove, there is no accumulated *yáng*,\nThus it does not blaze.\nBelow, there is no concentrated *yīn*,\nThus it does not obscure.\n*Yīn* and *yáng* intermingle,\nNo grasp can name it—\nThus *shéngshéng* (绳绳) it cannot be named.\nThough called *yīn* and *yáng*,\nYet *yīn* and *yáng* cannot be separated—\nThus it returns once more to the formless.\n\nThis is called the *state without state*—\nThe Dao of Earth before division.\nThe *symbol without substance*—\nThe Dao of Heaven before division.\nWhen the Dao of Heaven and Earth is yet undivided,\nThen *yīn* and *yáng* are inseparable—\nThus it is called *huǎnghū* (恍惚).\n\nIf so, approaching it you see no head—\nWho knows its origin?\nFollowing it you see no tail—\nWho knows its end?\n\nHere is the translation:\n\n---\n\nNow, if one wishes to practice and uphold this,\nThen only by grasping the ancient Dao can one govern the present forms.\n\nThe ancient is Heaven and Earth.\nThe present forms are *xíng* (形).\nIf one can grasp the Dao of Heaven and Earth to govern *xíng*,\nThen *xíng* will naturally align itself.\n\nThe ancient origin is One—\nThe source of Heaven and Earth—\nThus it is called *Dàojì* (道纪).\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Sage Who Mastered the Dao**\n\nThe ancient sage who mastered the Dao was subtle, mysterious, and profound—\nSo deep that none could fathom him.\n\nSince he could not be fathomed,\nHe feigned outward appearances:\nCautious as one crossing a river in winter,\nTimid as if fearing neighbors on all sides,\nSolemn as a guest,\nDissolving like ice about to melt,\nSincere as uncarved wood,\nVast as a valley,\nTurbulent as muddy water.\n\nWho can settle the muddy and let it gradually clear?\nWho can remain still and let movement arise naturally?\n\nThose who preserve this Dao do not seek fullness.\nOnly by not seeking fullness\nCan one endure decay without losing one’s original nature.\n\nThe ancient sage who mastered the Dao\nMastered the subtle mysteries of the Way,\nPenetrated the profound mysteries of Heaven’s Dao,\nAnd grasped the subtle essence of Earth’s Dao—\nThus he was called *subtle, mysterious, and profound*.\n\nThough inwardly he penetrated the subtle mysteries,\nOutwardly he remained unfathomable—\nThus, when viewed externally, he only feigned these appearances.\n\nCautious yet following movement naturally—\nLike one crossing a river in winter.\nSilent yet still—\nLike one fearing neighbors on all sides.\nNeither active nor passive,\nYet dignified as a guest—\nThese three are outward appearances.\n\nYet outwardly cautious while inwardly like a valley—\nVast and without thought.\nOutwardly fearful while inwardly like uncarved wood—\nSincere and without desire.\nOutwardly like a guest while inwardly dissolving—\nLike ice melting without attachment.\n\nBecause inwardly he was dissolving, like uncarved wood, like a valley,\nHe aligned with the true Dao—\nThus he was called *subtle, mysterious, and profound*.\n\nBecause outwardly he appeared cautious, fearful, like a guest,\nYet did not reveal himself—\nThus he was called *unfathomable*.\n\nThough appearing thus,\nHe blended with the common flow—\nThus he was turbulent like muddy water.\n\nWho can settle the muddy and let it gradually clear?\nWho can remain still and let movement arise naturally?\nOnly those who penetrate the profound and grasp the subtle can do so.\n\nMuddy is the body of Earth.\nStillness is the Dao of Earth.\nIf one follows Earth’s Dao,\nThen gradually it will clear—\nFor Earth naturally follows Heaven.\n\nStillness is the body of Heaven.\nMovement is the Dao of Heaven.\nIf one follows Heaven’s Dao,\nThen gradually life will arise—\nFor Heaven naturally follows the Dao.\n\nTo preserve this Dao,\nOnly the sage who masters it does so—\nThus he does not seek fullness.\nOnly by not seeking fullness\nCan one endure decay and hold fast to the original,\nWithout abandoning the root for the new.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: The Chapter on Attaining the Extremes of Emptiness**\n\nAttain the extremes of emptiness,\nGuard stillness with sincerity.\nWhen all things flourish together,\nI observe their return.\n\nAll things teeming, each returns to its root.\nReturning to the root is called stillness,\nStillness is called restoring the vital breath.\nRestoring the vital breath is called constancy,\nKnowing constancy is called enlightenment.\nNot knowing constancy brings misfortune.\nKnowing constancy and embracing it—\nEmbracing it makes it universal,\nUniversal makes it sovereign,\nSovereign makes it Heavenly,\nHeavenly makes it Dao,\nDao makes it enduring,\nAnd death cannot harm the body.\n\nEmptiness and stillness are the root of all things.\nManifesting Heaven’s function,\nAttaining the extremes of emptiness,\nFollowing Earth’s substance,\nGuarding stillness with sincerity—\nWhen all things flourish together,\nThe sage observes their return,\nIlluminating the principles of things to transform humanity.\n\nEven grasses and trees are of Earth’s kind—\nTheir roots below, their branches above,\nFollowing Earth’s Dao and remaining still.\nHumans are of Heaven’s kind—\nTheir roots above, their branches below,\nFollowing Heaven’s Dao and moving.\n\nAll things teeming, each returns to its root—\nWhen all things are nurtured without comparison, this is the original root,\nAnd it can be observed in Heaven.\n\nThus the sage said:\n*\"Flowers and leaves return to their fruit,\nStems and leaves to their roots—\nThe Dao returns to its origin,\nAt the yellow cavity between the brows.\"*\n\nThis is what is meant.\n\nReturning to the root is called stillness—\nOnly stillness follows Earth’s substance,\nAnd thus one can restore one’s nature.\n\nStillness is called restoring the vital breath—\nStillness allows gradual clarity,\nAnd only clarity manifests Heaven’s function,\nThus one can restore the vital breath.\n\nThe *Tàiyī* (太一) governs life,\nIts root is in the *níwán* (泥丸).\nThus *Tàiyī* is the totality of Heaven and Earth’s Dao—\nThis is called constancy.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth’s Dao are unified as One,\nOne gradually enters the true constancy—\nThus restoring the vital breath is called constancy.\n\nKnowing and guarding constancy,\nSpirit arises from it,\nEnlightenment emerges from it—\nAll originating from One—\nThus knowing constancy is called enlightenment.\n\nEnlightenment is the union of *yīn* and *yáng* as One.\nNot knowing constancy is to abandon Heaven and Earth’s Dao\nAnd harbor delusions,\nFollowing things as they shift,\nStraying into misfortune,\nForever losing the true Dao—\nThus misfortune arises.\n\nKnowing constancy and embracing it—\nThis is knowing Heaven and Earth’s Dao.\nBetween Heaven and Earth, there is nothing it does not contain—\nWhat private interest could there be?\nThus it is said: *Embracing makes it universal.*\n\nThe sovereign embodies Heaven and Earth’s impartiality,\nYet achieves his own ends through it—\nThus it is said: *Universal makes it sovereign.*\n\nThe sovereign embodies Heaven and Earth’s Dao,\nAnd his essence aligns upward—\nThus it is said: *Sovereign makes it Heavenly.*\n\nHeaven is One and vast—\nThus it is said: *Heavenly makes it Dao.*\n\nThe Dao precedes Heaven and Earth,\nEndures through countless ages,\nWithout beginning or end—\nThus it is said: *Dao makes it enduring.*\n\nEnduring is the constancy of the Dao—\nThose who know constancy\nThus their bodies are not harmed by death.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: The Supreme Sage**\n\nThe Supreme Sage—\nBelow, he knows existence;\n\nThe next level, they are honored and praised;\nThe next, they are feared and insulted.\nTrust is insufficient, yet still distrustful.\nThus, it is said: *How much the Sage values speech.*\n\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,\nThe people all say virtue arises naturally.\n\nThe Great Dao is formless—\nYin and Yang blend into One.\nOne gives birth to Heaven and Earth,\nHeaven and Earth give birth to all things,\nFrom formless to form.\n\nIn the age of the Supreme Sage,\nThe ruler of all under Heaven acts without action,\nAnd fulfills Heaven’s virtue alone.\nThe common folk know of their ruler,\nYet what imperial power could there be over me?\nThus it is said: *The Supreme Sage, below knows his existence*—\nThis is the return to the Great Dao’s formlessness.\n\nIn the middle ages, the Sage’s benevolence extends to the people,\nAnd the people naturally grow close and praise him—\nThus it is said: *The next, they are honored and praised*—\nThis is the return to Heaven’s Dao lacking affection.\n\nIn later ages, emperors and kings enforce laws to bring order,\nAnd the people naturally grow fearful—\nThus it is said: *The next, they are feared*—\nThis is the return to Earth’s Dao lacking desire.\n\nExtending through several generations,\nLaws breed deceit, edicts spawn trickery—\nThus it is said: *The next, they are insulted*—\nThis is the return to the King’s Dao of rectitude.\n\nTo take trust from people through laws and edicts,\nTrust is insufficient, and distrust remains.\nThus, at the beginning of the Supreme Sage,\nHe practices the teaching of no-speech—\nThus it is said: *How much the Sage values speech.*\n\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,\nThe people all say it is natural—\nThen there is no honoring, praising, fearing, or insulting,\nNo distrust.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao Declines**\n\nWhen the Great Dao declines,\nThere arises benevolence and righteousness;\nWhen wisdom emerges,\nThere arises great deceit;\nWhen familial bonds fracture,\nThere arises filial piety and kindness;\nWhen the state falls into chaos,\nThere arise loyal ministers.\n\nWhen the Great Dao declines, why does benevolence and righteousness arise?\nBenevolence can be feigned, righteousness can be lacking—\nBecause it is contrary to the constant Dao of non-action,\nThus the Great Dao declines.\n\nWhen wisdom emerges, why does great deceit arise?\nWisdom has knowledge, kindness has perception—\nBecause it is contrary to Heaven’s Dao of non-knowledge,\nThus great deceit arises.\n\nWhen familial bonds fracture, why does filial piety and kindness arise?\nThe filial revere their own kin, the kind cherish their own children—\nBecause it is contrary to Earth’s Dao of non-desire,\nThus familial bonds fracture.\n\nWhen the state falls into chaos, why do loyal ministers arise?\nThey see peril and risk their lives in admonition—\nBecause it is contrary to the King’s Dao of rectitude,\nThus loyal ministers’ virtue is displayed.\n\nThe Great Dao is vast and unfathomable,\nNeither declining nor flourishing—\nAncient and modern are unchanged,\nYet people ruin it themselves—\nThis is the natural course of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang.\nYet when exhausted, it transforms;\nWhen transformed, it flows;\nWhen flowing, it endures.\n\nThe Sage, ruling all under Heaven with the Dao,\nGathers at seven without relying on it,\nIs light on righteousness without accumulation,\nThe people return to simplicity and purity,\nAnd wisdom fades away.\nPeople lack craftiness, deceit ceases,\nWind and customs become pure, filial piety and kindness vanish,\nOne becomes upright, and loyal ministers naturally comply—\nThis is called the utmost governance.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Discarding the Sage and Wisdom**\n\nDiscard the Sage, abandon wisdom,\nThe people benefit a hundredfold;\nDiscard benevolence, abandon righteousness,\nThe people return to filial piety and kindness;\nDiscard cleverness, abandon profit,\nThieves and robbers vanish.\n\nThese three things, though called culture,\nAre insufficient—\nThus they must be assigned.\n\nSeeing simplicity, embracing purity,\nFew desires, little private interest.\n\nDoes the Dao descend and virtue decline\nTo delight the Sage?\nIs this flattering through art to delight wisdom?\nIs this flattering through flaws to delight benevolence?\nIs this confusing virtue to delight righteousness?\nIs this contrary to the governance of all under Heaven,\nAnd thus disturbing the natural state of life?\n\nThus, the Sage does not consider many talents as sageliness,\nDoes not consider ruling people as wisdom—\nInstead, he embodies Heaven’s Dao of non-knowledge,\nAnd the people benefit a hundredfold.\n\nHe does not consider loving things as benevolence,\nDoes not consider establishing self as righteousness—\nThus he discards benevolence and righteousness,\nAnd embodies the Great Dao of non-action,\nAnd filial piety and kindness return to obscurity.\n\nHe does not consider strange things as cleverness,\nDoes not consider wealth as profit—\nThus he discards cleverness and profit,\nAnd embodies Earth’s Dao of non-desire,\nAnd thieves and robbers vanish.\n\nThus, the people naturally return to their true nature\nAnd recover their original state.\n\nSageliness and wisdom,\nBenevolence and righteousness,\nCleverness and profit—\nThese three things,\nThrough culture, extinguish the natural,\nLose their original simplicity,\nAnd cause the people to lack sufficiency,\nTeach the people to rebel,\nAgitate the people to thievery—\nBecause culture is insufficient,\nThus they must be assigned.\n\nSeeing simplicity is to embody Heaven and Earth’s Dao.\nThe enlightened enter simplicity,\nAnd simplicity naturally reduces private interest.\n\nEmbracing purity is to embody the constant Dao.\nThus, the non-acting return to purity,\nAnd purity naturally reduces desire.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Discarding Learning, No Worries**\n\n---\n\nHow far apart are *yes* and *no*?\nHow different are *good* and *evil*?\n\nWhat people fear,\nI cannot but fear.\n\nHow vast and boundless it is!\n\nThe crowd bustles and rejoices,\nAs if feasting on the grandest sacrificial meat,\nAs if ascending the spring platform.\n\nI alone am timid, as yet unmarked,\nLike an infant before it can speak,\nDrifting, drifting, as if without direction.\n\nThe crowd all has abundance,\nI alone seem abandoned—\nMy heart, a fool’s heart, is pure and simple.\n\nThe common folk are bright and discerning,\nI alone seem dim and obscured;\nThe common folk are keen and observant,\nI alone am muddled and dull.\n\nSerene as the sea, it knows no end,\nRising like a boundless wind—\nThe crowd all has means,\nI alone am stubborn, as if coarse.\n\nI alone differ from others,\nIn that I prize nourishment from the Mother.\n\nCulture extinguishes the natural,\nAnd erudition drowns the heart—\nOnly then do the people begin to stray and confuse,\nUnable to return to their true nature\nAnd recover their original state.\n\nThus, the flaws of sageliness and wisdom,\nThe chaos of virtue and righteousness,\nThe theft of cleverness and profit—\nThese three things, because culture is insufficient,\nTherefore the Sage discards the learning of contrived action,\nDwells in the affairs of non-action—\nWhat worries could there be?\n\nHow far apart are *yes* and *no*?\nHow different are *good* and *evil*?\n\nFor those who learn, distinctions arise of their own accord,\nAnd they lose their true nature, harming life alike.\n\nWhat people fear,\nIs the loss of life—\nLearning multiplies ways to lose life,\nAnd cannot but be feared.\n\nThis is why the Sage discards learning\nBecause of its many ways—\nThus, vast and boundless, he cannot be contained.\n\nAt the start of learning,\nOne practices in due season,\nBustling and joyful,\nSo it feasts on the finest sacrificial flavors\nAnd loses its natural tranquility,\nAscends the spring platform for viewing\nAnd loses its quiet solitude.\n\nI alone am timid, treasuring the beginning of Heaven and Earth,\nLike an infant before it can speak—\nDrifting, drifting, its movements seem without purpose.\n\nIn the midst of learning,\nKnowledge and perception multiply daily,\nEach day bringing gain,\nSo all have abundance—\nBut I, for the Dao, am daily diminished,\nSeem abandoned—\nBetween movement and stillness,\nHeaven’s spontaneity does not unfold,\nYet silently aligns with the Dao.\nPure and simple, I do not conform to the scheming of the virtuous.\n\nAt the end of learning,\nCulture surpasses substance,\nAnd brightness shines like the unveiled sun and moon.\nErudition triumphs, drowning the heart,\nDiscernment reveals depths like fish in the sea—\nI alone guard the original root,\nDim as if without outward vision,\nMuddled as if without outward communication,\nVast as if forgotten, still as if at rest—\nSeeming without end.\n\nFrom the start to the extreme,\nAll are shaped by accumulated habits,\nSo all have means—\nI alone am coarse and simple,\nWithout means at all.\n\nThen, what makes me different from others?\nOnly that I prize nourishment from the Mother.\n\nHeaven and Earth are the Mother of all things,\nAnd people all consume grains and the five flavors—\nBut I alone consume the *qi* of the Great Harmony of yin and yang,\nThus I do not perish—\nThis is how I differ.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: The Sage’s Virtue and Appearance**\n---\n\nThe Sage’s virtue and appearance,\nFollow the Dao alone.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: The Nature of the Dao**\n\nThe Dao as a thing,\nIs but vague and indistinct.\nIndistinct and vague,\nYet within it lies an image;\nVague and indistinct,\nYet within it lies a substance.\n\nDeep and dark,\nWithin it is essence—\nIts essence most true,\nWithin it is trust.\n\nFrom ancient times to now,\nIts name has never vanished,\nFor it encompasses all beings.\n\nHow do I know all beings are thus?\nBy this.\n\nThe *Kong* (孔) is from *zi* (子) to *yi* (乙),\nWhere the three yang reside.\nBetween the boundless and the dark,\nThe *Bu* (乾) Dao possesses true essence,\nThe moment when it responds to things.\n\n*Virtue* (德) is the Dao within me.\n*Appearance* (容) is my form resembling Heaven and Earth.\n\nIf one attains this moment of true essence\nAnd returns to my Heaven and Earth,\nThen the Dao will naturally come to me—\nThus it is said: *The Sage’s Virtue and Appearance, follow the Dao alone.*\n\nThe Dao as a thing,\nIs but vague and indistinct—\nThis is spoken of in terms of yin and yang.\n\n*Virtue* (德) as a thing,\nIs form and substance—\nThus the Dao as a thing,\nIs yin and is yang.\n\nThe vague (恍兮) is when the Dao in Heaven becomes yang,\nYang within contains yin—\nThus it is said: *vague and indistinct.*\n\nResponding to things is *spirit* (神),\nSpirit is the presence of the formless—\nSaying it is in Heaven—\nThus it is said: *within it lies a substance.*\n\nThe indistinct (惚兮) is when the Dao on Earth becomes yin,\nYin within contains yang—\nThus it is said: *indistinct and vague.*\n\nResponding to things is *qi* (氣),\nQi is the presence of the void within substance—\nSaying it is on Earth—\nThus it is said: *within it lies an image.*\n\nDeep and dark,\nWithin it is essence—\nBetween Heaven and Earth, yin and yang coexist,\nTransforming endlessly,\nThus forming the essence of things.\nI ponder this Dao,\nOriginating from the deep and dark.\n\nIts essence most true,\nResponds to the *Upper Primordial* (上元).\nWithin it is trust,\nMeaning it never fails in response.\n\nThe Dao endures from ancient times to now,\nThus from ancient times to now,\nIts name has never vanished.\nHeaven and Earth are the *origin* (甫) of all things,\nWithin me, my form resembles Heaven and Earth—\nThis is called *encompassing all beings.*\n\nIt must be called *origin* (甫),\nFor Heaven and Earth have the function of a father.\n\nHow do I know all beings are thus?\nEssence gathers into spirit,\nSpirit transforms into qi,\nQi transforms into things—\nBetween transformations, the cycle is endless,\nThe changes of all beings pass without ceasing—\nThus all things cannot help but be born,\nCannot help but die.\nThe Sage values essence,\nFor spirit can avoid death,\nCan avoid birth.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: The Doctrine of Flexibility and Completeness**\n\nFlexible yields completeness,\nCrooked yields straightness,\nHollow yields fullness,\nExhausted yields renewal,\nLittle yields acquisition,\nMuch yields confusion.\n\nThus the Sage embraces *Oneness* (一) as the model for all under Heaven.\nNot self-assertive, hence clear;\nNot self-righteous, hence illustrious;\nNot self-praising, hence fruitful;\nNot self-conceited, hence enduring.\n\nOnly because he does not contend,\nNone under Heaven can contend with him.\n\nThe ancients said, *\"Flexible yields completeness\"*—\nIs this not true?\nIndeed, it is complete and returns to its source.\n\nThe constant Dao responds to things without contention,\nThus it is said: *Flexible yields completeness.*\n\nThe Earth Dao is great and straight,\nYet appears bent—\nThus it is said: *Crooked yields straightness.*\n\nThe Heaven Dao is boundless and void,\nYet appears like a valley—\nThus it is said: *Hollow yields fullness.*\n\nThe *Kingly Dao* (王道) upholds simplicity and does nothing—\nThus it is said: *Exhausted yields renewal.*\n\nThese four principles,\nAre the four great domains of the world—\nThough divided into four great domains,\nThey are in fact rooted in one Dao,\nOne Dao alone.\n\nHeaven attains it to be clear,\nEarth attains it to be tranquil,\nThe sovereign attains it to be the *orthodox* (貞) of all under Heaven—\nThus it is said: *Little yields acquisition.*\n\nIf one descends from the root to the branches,\nAnd engages in artificial action,\nThen one is bound by desires—\nCountless ages cannot exhaust them—\nThus it is said: *Much yields confusion.*\n\nThus the Sage knows the *Supreme Dao* (至道) is not troublesome,\nDifferent paths converge in the same meeting—\nHence he embraces *Oneness* as the model for all under Heaven.\n\nIn this way, he embodies the fourfold Dao,\nTo respond to the world without bearing its burdens.\n\nNot self-assertive,\nEmbodying the *Flexible yields completeness* Dao—\nHence he is clear.\n\nNot self-righteous,\nEmbodying the *Crooked yields straightness* Dao—\nHence he is illustrious.\n\nNot self-praising,\nEmbodying the *Hollow yields fullness* Dao—\nHence he is fruitful.\n\nNot self-conceited,\nEmbodying the *Exhausted yields renewal* Dao—\nHence he endures.\n\nYet in responding to things,\nHe always takes the constant Dao as his root—\nThe constant Dao does not contend with all things—\nThus Heaven and Earth cannot contend with him.\n\nThe ancients said, *\"Flexible yields completeness\"*—\nIs this not true?\nIndeed, it is complete and returns to its source.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: The Rarity of Natural Speech**\n\nRarely speaking naturally,\nThus gusts of wind do not last the morning,\nSudden rains do not last the day.\n\nWho does this?\nHeaven and Earth.\n\nHeaven and Earth cannot endure long,\nHow much less so people?\n\nThus those who follow the Dao,\nThose who follow the Dao align with the Dao,\nThose who follow virtue align with virtue,\nThose who lose align with loss.\n\nAligning with the Dao,\nThe Dao also attains them;\nAligning with virtue,\nVirtue also attains them;\nAligning with loss,\nLoss also attains them.\n\nLacking trust is untrustworthy.\nHeaven says nothing—\nOnly listens without hearing.\n\nRare speech is the Heaven Dao,\nThus it is always natural.\n\nGusts of wind and sudden rains,\nAre the transient *qi* of Heaven and Earth.\n\nHeaven and Earth are not constant,\nAnd yet cannot endure long—\nIf people are not constant,\nHow can their virtue follow the Dao?\n\nThus those who follow the Dao,\nEmbody the vast Dao as boundless and void,\nPreserve and give birth to it—\nThey align with the Dao.\n\nEmbody the Upper Virtue as clear and tranquil,\nGuard and nurture it—\nThey align with virtue.\n\nLike gusts of wind and sudden rains,\nWhich are not constant,\nThen they revert to madness and blindness,\nBearing self-blame—\nThey align with loss.\n\nAligning with the Dao,\nThey ascend to the *Southern Palace* (南宮),\nThis is the Dao attained.\n\nAligning with virtue,\nThey prolong life and years—\nThis is virtue attained.\n\nAligning with loss,\nThey connect with the *Ghostly Dao* (鬼道),\nThis is loss attained.\n\n「The three ways of gaining trust in others\nAre all necessary tokens of their ultimate fate—\nIf trust is insufficient,\nThen doubt will arise.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Stilted Do Not Stand**\nThe stilted cannot stand,\nThe striding cannot walk,\nThe self-observing cannot see clearly,\nThe self-righteous cannot be manifest,\nThe self-praising achieve no merit,\nThe self-conceited cannot endure.\n\nIn the Dao,\nThey are called *excessive consumption* and *superfluous actions*.\nSome may detest them,\nThus those who follow the Dao do not dwell here.\nThe stilted set themselves up,\nSo they do not stand firm.\n\nIf one embodies the Dao of Earth,\nSilent and without desire,\nThey stand alone and never waver.\nThe striding act for themselves,\nSo they do not walk steadily.\n\nIf one embodies the Dao of Heaven,\nLofty and without scheming,\nThey traverse the world without faltering.\n\nAs for self-observation, self-righteousness, self-praise, and self-conceit,\nAll are self-made faults,\nComparable to the stilted and striding.\nThus they contradict the teachings of the earlier chapters.\n\nThose who do so,\nIn the Dao, indulge in *excessive consumption* beyond what is allotted,\nAnd in *superfluous actions* beyond virtue’s path—\nThese are all those who love fullness.\nSome detest fullness,\nThus those who follow the Dao do not dwell here.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Primordial Unity**\nThere is a Primordial Unity,\nBorn before Heaven and Earth.\n\nSilent and lofty,\nIt stands alone and never changes,\nTraverses the world without faltering—\nThus it may be called the Mother of all things.\n\nI do not know its name,\nSo I call it *Dao* and forcefully name it *Great*.\nGreat is *passing*,\nPassing is *distant*,\nDistant is *returning*.\n\nThus the Dao is great,\nHeaven is great,\nEarth is great,\nAnd the Sage-King is great.\nWithin the realm there are four great things,\nAnd the Sage-King occupies one.\n\nPeople follow Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the Dao,\nThe Dao follows *Naturalness*.\n\nWhen *qi* takes form and substance yet remains undivided, it is called *Primordial Unity*.\nIf there is a Primordial Unity,\nThen the undivided yet unseparated is it.\n\nWhen form begins to change and becomes one,\nThis One gives birth to Heaven and Earth—\nThus it is said to be born before Heaven and Earth.\n\nSpeaking of the Dao,\nSilent and unchanging,\nIts root lies in *True Constancy*—\nHow could it ever waver?\n\nSpeaking of Earth,\nLofty and ever-transforming,\nIts transformations are in *Mysterious Application*—\nHow could it ever falter?\n\nSpeaking of Heaven,\nOnly after Heaven and Earth arise do all things come into being—\nThus it is said to be the Mother of all things.\n\nWhen discussing all things under Heaven,\nThey begin with the transformation of form,\nThus its name is unknown—\nIt is called *Dao*.\n\nAbove, no further origin exists,\nSo forcefully it is named *Great*.\n\nThe Dao separates from the Primordial Unity,\nAnd Heaven and Earth begin to divide.\nHeaven attains the Dao,\nMoving without accumulation—\nThus *Great* is called *passing*.\nLight and clear become Heaven,\nHeavy and turbid become Earth—\nHeaven moves without accumulation,\nEarth is vast without bounds—\nThus *passing* is called *distant*.\nHeaven and Earth contain the *Essential Qi*,\nAnd all things transform and are born.\nDescending from origin to extremity,\nThe farther they stray from the Dao,\nThe more they accumulate—\nThus *distant* is called *returning*.\n\nOnly the Sage-King stands independent above all things,\nTransforming all things without being burdened by them,\nIn unity with the Dao,\nAnd in function with Heaven and Earth.\n\nHeaven and Earth are what the ancients called *Great*.\nWhat then does the Sage-King who rules all under Heaven do?\nHe merely embodies *Heavenly Virtue*.\n\nThus the Dao is great,\nHeaven is great,\nEarth is great,\nAnd the Sage-King is great.\nWithin the realm there are four great things,\nAnd the Sage-King occupies one—\nThe Dao, Heaven, and Earth\nAll attain *Oneness* to be great,\nBut only the Sage-King is one who follows the Dao,\nAnd his *Oneness* surpasses even the union of Heaven and Earth—\nThus he is great as well.\n\nFrom the beginning of Primordial Unity,\n*Voidness* and *Nothingness* give birth to *Naturalness*,\n*Naturalness* gives birth to the Dao,\nThe Dao gives birth to *Oneness*,\n*Oneness* gives birth to Heaven and Earth,\nAnd Heaven and Earth give birth to all things—\nIf one can reverse this law,\nAnd return to the origin,\nThey will once again align with *Naturalness*.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Heavy as Root of the Light**\nThe heavy is the root of the light,\nThe tranquil is the sovereign of the restless.\n\nThus the Sage-King never leaves his *burden* (车辎) all day,\nThough there are palaces and pleasures,\nHe rests in the lofty and detached.\n\nHow can the ruler of ten thousand chariots\nLighten his body over all under Heaven?\nLightness leads to losing his ministers,\nRestlessness leads to losing his sovereignty.\nThe heavy can govern the light,\nThus the heavy is the root of the light.\nThe tranquil can control the restless,\nThus the tranquil is the sovereign of the restless.\n\nThese two principles\nAre the fundamental roots of the Dao.\n\nThe Sage-King knows that the Dao’s fundamental roots lie here,\nThus he never leaves his *burden* all day.\n\nThe carriage, with its *voidness* as essence,\nAnd *nothingness* as function,\nGuards tranquility within,\nAnd bears its own weight—\nThus externally it governs the light and restless wheels and spokes.\n\nThe Sage-King practices this,\nSo though there are palaces and pleasures of lightness and restlessness,\nHe rests in the heavy and tranquil,\nLofty and detached,\nNever letting them cling to his heart.\n\nIf the heavy and tranquil are such,\nHow can the ruler of ten thousand chariots\nLighten his body over all under Heaven?\n\nLightness leads to losing the heavy—\nHis body does not rest.\nRestlessness leads to losing tranquility—\nHis spirit does not ascend.\n\nThe Dao of ministers is especially to be rooted in self-weight,\nThe Dao of the sovereign is especially to be valued in guarding tranquility—\nThe Dao of sovereign and minister alike\nFollows the principle of lightness and restlessness.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Art of the Good**\nThe good in action leaves no tracks,\nThe good in speech leaves no flaws,\nThe good in calculation does not rely on measures,\nThe good in closing requires no bolts yet cannot be opened,\nThe good in binding requires no cords yet cannot be undone.\n\nThus the Sage-King is always good at saving people,\nAnd so there are none abandoned—\nAlways good at saving things,\nAnd so there are none cast aside.\nThis is called *following clarity*.\n\nThus the good person,\nIs the teacher of the not-good,\nAnd the not-good,\nIs the resource of the good.\n\nIf one does not honor their teacher,\nOr cherish their resource,\nEven with great wisdom they are greatly confused—\nThis is called *the essential subtlety*.\n\nTo traverse the six *voids* without tracks,\nNone are better than the *Great Dao*.\nTo speak of goodness without flaws,\nTo act without scheming measures,\nNone are better than the *Heavenly Dao*.\n\nTo store the *True Essence* of *Great Harmony* without bolts,\nTo bind the *Mysterious Function* of *Primordial Unity* without cords—\nNone are better than the *Earthly Dao*.\n\n「Thus the Sage, throughout their day, moves without abandoning their baggage—\nYet leaves no tracks behind;\nThey teach without speaking—\nYet leave no flaws unaddressed;\nThey embrace *Oneness* as a model for all under Heaven—\nYet employ no scheming measures;\nThey harbor the Spirit within—\nYet no bolts can keep it sealed, nor can it be opened;\nThey return to the Mother of all under Heaven—\nYet no cords can bind it, nor can it be undone.\n\nTo embody this Dao,\nThey are ever skilled at saving people—\nAnd each finds rest in their own customs,\nNo one left untouched by its transformation.\nThey are ever skilled at saving things—\nAnd each fulfills its own nature,\nNo thing left unnurtured by its care—\nThis is called *the Sage who embodies the Dao*,\nHence it is said: *following clarity*.\n\nOnly the Sage excels in this,\nAnd so becomes the teacher of the unvirtuous.\nThe common folk do not excel in this,\nYet still are touched by its transformation—\nAnd so become the resource of the virtuous.\nThose touched by its transformation,\nAll say, \"This is my natural state,\"\nAnd thus do not honor their teacher.\nThose who excel in this,\nYet dwell not in themselves—\nAnd thus do not cherish their resource.\nThe Sage acts thus,\nNot to enlighten the people,\nBut to befuddle them.\n\nIf the *flowering* of wisdom is its splendor,\nThen it will turn against this Dao—\nThis is called *great confusion*.\nOnly those who forget both extremes,\nWho hold nothing dear—\nThis is called *the essential subtlety*.\n\n**Chapter XXVIII: Knowing the Heroic Virtue**\nKnow the Heroic and cherish the Feminine—\nThis is the *valley* of all under Heaven.\nAs the *valley* of all under Heaven,\nTheir *virtue/power* never departs—\nAnd returns to the *Infant of the Feminine*.\n\nKnow the White and cherish the Black—\nThis is the *model* of all under Heaven.\nAs the *model* of all under Heaven,\nTheir *virtue/power* is never flawed—\nAnd returns to the *Boundless*.\n\nKnow the Prosperous and cherish the Humble—\nThis is the *valley* of all under Heaven.\nAs the *valley* of all under Heaven,\nTheir *virtue/power* is ever sufficient—\nAnd returns to the *Uncarved*.\n\nThe *Uncarved* scatters and becomes *vessels*—\nThe Sage uses it and becomes the *officials and leaders*,\nThus the grandest measures cannot sever the *Way of Non-action*.\n\nThe *Heroic* is the Yang,\nThe *Feminine* is the Yin.\nIf one knows the *Heroic* at the peak of the utmost Yang,\nAnd cherishes the *Feminine* at the source of the utmost Yin,\nThen their *nurturing* is constant—\nAnd returns to the *Earthly Dao*,\nThus it is the *valley* of all under Heaven.\nA mountain ravine is a small *valley*,\nBut the Earth is the *valley* of all under Heaven.\n\nThough they act upon things,\nYet nothing is left to them—\nThis is called *their virtue/power never departs*.\nIf one can embody the *Earthly Dao*,\nHonoring nourishment and depth,\nThen they return to the *Infant of the Feminine*.\n\nDay is the White,\nNight is the Black.\nIf one knows the White at the height of the day,\nAnd cherishes the Black in the time of the night,\nThen day and night are preserved—\nAnd align with the *Heavenly Dao*,\nThus it is the *model* of all under Heaven.\nThe *model* of a kingdom is but one nation’s pattern,\nBut the *Heavenly Dao* is the *model* of all under Heaven.\n\nThe *True Essence* reaches its peak—\nYet still remains within—\nThis is called *their virtue/power is never flawed*.\nIf one can embody the *Way of Oneness*,\nAdjusting and yielding above to below,\nThen they return to the *Boundless*.\n\nThe *spreading* of life is Prosperous,\nThe *carving* of form is Humble.\nIf one knows the Prosperous at the beginning of life’s spreading,\nAnd cherishes the Humble after the carving of form,\nThen they return to the Root and reclaim their Command—\nAnd reverse to the *Heavenly Dao*,\nThus it is the *valley* of all under Heaven.\nA mountain and marsh are small *valleys*,\nBut Heaven is the *valley* of all under Heaven.\n\nDwelling not in themselves,\nYet responding to all without exhaustion—\nThis is called *their virtue/power is ever sufficient*.\nIf one can embody the *Heavenly Dao*,\nWith serene simplicity and non-action,\nThen they return to the *Uncarved*.\n\nThe *Uncarved* is the complete essence of the Dao,\nGiving birth to Heaven and Earth.\nWhen it scatters, it becomes *vessels*—\nThe light and pure become *Spirit-vessels*,\nThe heavy and coarse become *Utility-vessels*.\nThe *Spirit-vessels* are the *highest virtue/power*—\nThe *highest virtue/power* acts without doing,\nAnd nothing is left to it—\nThus the *Spirit-vessels* of all under Heaven,\nCannot be wielded.\nThe *Utility-vessels* are the *lowest virtue/power*—\nThe *lowest virtue/power* acts and leaves traces—\nThus the *Utility-vessels* of a nation,\nCannot be shown to the people.\n\nThe Sage uses the *Uncarved* and becomes the *officials and leaders*—\nThough Heaven and Earth carve and measure all things,\nThey cannot sever the *Way of Non-action*.\n\n**Chapter XXIX: The Chapter of Taking Action**\nThose who would take all under Heaven and act upon it,\nI see them as not having reached the end of their means.\n\nThe *Spirit-vessels* of all under Heaven,\nCannot be wielded.\nThe *wielder* fails them,\nThe *grasper* loses them.\nThus things sometimes advance, sometimes retreat,\nSometimes rush forth, sometimes withdraw,\nSometimes grow strong, sometimes weak,\nSometimes ascend, sometimes descend.\nHence the Sage avoids excess, avoids extravagance, avoids grandeur.\n\nHeaven and Earth endure long and last,\nBecause they constantly have no desires and act without doing—\nThus those who would take all under Heaven and act upon it,\nI see them as not having reached the end of their means.\n\nThe reason they have not reached the end of their means,\nIs that the *Spirit-vessels* of all under Heaven,\nCannot be wielded.\nYet the *Spirit-vessels* are profound and obscure,\nUnfathomable and dark—\nWisdom cannot penetrate them—\nThus the *wielder* fails them,\nAnd the *grasper* loses them.\n\nTherefore, the things of all under Heaven,\nWhen the Yang advances, the Yin follows;\nWhen the Yang reaches its peak and rushes forth,\nThe Yin responds with withdrawal;\nWhen the Yin grows strong,\nThings will grow weak;\nWhen the Yin reaches its peak and withdraws,\nThings will follow suit.\n\nThus success and failure, gain and loss,\nAre not known beforehand—\nThis is how those who would take all under Heaven and act upon it,\nAre constrained by the numbers of Yin and Yang,\nYet still cannot escape their burdens.\n\nHence the Sage embodies the *Heavenly Dao*,\nAnd wanders in the realm of *free and easy* non-action—\nThus it is said: *avoid excess*.\nThey embody the *Earthly Dao*,\nAnd eat from the fields of *simple sustenance*—\nThus it is said: *avoid extravagance*.\nThey embody the *Great Dao*,\nAnd dwell in the garden of *uncompromising* non-action—\nThus it is said: *avoid grandeur*.\nThis is not relying on all under Heaven,\nNor on ghosts and spirits,\nNor on all things—\nThus they suffer neither failure nor loss.\n\n**Chapter XXX: Aiding the Ruler with the Dao**\nTo aid the ruler with the Dao,\nIs not to use force to conquer all under Heaven—\nTheir affairs are fond of returning.\n\nWhere the army encamps,\nThorns and brambles spring up.\nAfter a great campaign,\nThere must be years of hardship.\nThus the virtuous act only when necessary,\nAnd dare not to conquer with force.\n\nActing when necessary,\nYet not boasting,\nActing when necessary,\nYet not claiming victory,\nActing when necessary,\nYet not growing arrogant,\nActing when necessary,\nYet not forcing—\nActing when necessary,\nYet not dominating.»\n\n「When things grow robust, they age—\nThis is called *not* the Dao/Way,\nAnd *not* the Dao/Way will come early.\n\nWarfare is a *harsh* instrument,\nCombat is a *perilous* affair,\nContention is *contrary to virtue/power*.\nThus, those who aid the ruler with the Dao/Way\nDo not use force to conquer all under Heaven,\nTheir affairs fond of returning,\nThis is called *reverting to your own* Dao/Way.\n\nWhere the army encamps,\nIt seizes the labor of the people below,\nThus thorns and brambles spring up.\nAfter a great campaign,\nThe ruler above disrupts the *harmony of Heaven*,\nThus there must be years of calamity.\nThus the virtuous act only when necessary,\nAnd dare not rely on the strength of arms to claim victory over all under Heaven.\nUnderstanding the text below,\nThose who embody the Dao/Way of the *Great Way*:\nAct when necessary, yet do not grow proud,\nThus their *virtue/power* endures;\nThose who embody the Dao/Way of *Heaven*:\nAct when necessary, yet do not boast,\nThus they achieve merit;\nThose who embody the Dao/Way of *Earth*:\nAct when necessary, yet do not grow arrogant,\nThus they incur no blame.\n\nThese three principles,\nThough acting when necessary, yet not compelled,\nDo not dare to rely on pride or arrogance to claim victory—\nThis is the meaning of *act when necessary, yet not force*.\n\nTo use force and strength,\nIs to go against the Dao/Way,\nThus it is said: *not* the Dao/Way will come early.\n\n**Chapter XXXI: On the *Illustrious* Army**\nThe *illustrious* army is an *auspicious* instrument,\nYet some may detest it,\nThus those who possess the Dao/Way do not dwell upon it.\nTherefore, the virtuous ruler values the left in governance,\nAnd values the right in warfare.\nWarfare is an *auspicious* instrument,\nNot the instrument of the virtuous,\nUsed only when unavoidable,\nAnd *tranquility* is the highest ideal.\nThus it is not glorified,\nFor to glorify it would bring joy,\nAnd those who take joy in it\nAre those who take joy in killing others.\nThose who take joy in killing others\nCannot fulfill their aspirations in all under Heaven.\n\nAuspicious affairs are honored on the left,\nHarsh affairs on the right.\nThus the *Junior General* is placed on the left,\nAnd the *Senior General* on the right.\nWhen occupying the highest position,\nIt is treated with funeral rites.\nWhen many are killed,\nIt is mourned with sorrowful tears,\nAnd when victorious in battle,\nIt is treated with funeral rites.\nWarfare is the greatest *plunderer* of the people,\nThe harshest instrument under Heaven—\nHow much more so when it is *illustrious*?\nThis is called an *auspicious* instrument,\nYet some may detest it.\nThose who detest it,\nAre those who possess the Dao/Way and do not dwell upon it.\n\nThe virtuous ruler values the left in governance,\nFor the left is *yang* and governs life—\nAn auspicious affair.\nIn warfare, the right is valued,\nFor the right is *yin* and governs death—\nA harsh affair.\nRepeatedly speaking of an *auspicious* instrument,\nIs a profound warning against warfare,\nThus it is not the instrument of the virtuous,\nUsed only when unavoidable,\nWith no desire to conquer others,\nAnd *tranquility* is the highest ideal.\nThough victorious, it is not glorified,\nAnd even if glorified, those who take joy in killing others—\nThis is called the *illustrious* army.\n\nThe *illustrious* army is what Heaven detests,\nHow can it fulfill its aspirations under Heaven?\nThus auspicious affairs are honored on the left,\nAnd harsh affairs on the right.\nTherefore, the *Junior General* is placed on the left,\nAnd the *Senior General* on the right—\nThis is called valuing the right in warfare.\nWhen occupying the highest position,\nIt is treated with funeral rites—\nThis is called honoring harsh affairs on the right.\nWhen many are killed,\nIt is mourned with sorrowful tears,\nThus victory in war is treated with funeral rites.\n\n**Chapter XXXII: The Dao/Way is Ever Nameless**\nThe Dao/Way is ever nameless,\nYet the *Uncarved Block* (朴), though small,\nAll under Heaven dare not subject it.\nIf lords and kings could preserve it,\nAll things would come as guests.\nWhen Heaven and Earth unite,\nSweet dew descends,\nNo one commands it, yet it is evenly distributed.\n\nAt first, the Dao/Way had no name,\nYet once named, the name already exists.\nThe Dao/Way, once in all under Heaven,\nIs like streams and valleys to the rivers and seas.\nThe natural Dao/Way,\nIs the origin of Heaven and Earth—\nHow could it be named?\nThus it is said: *nameless*.\n\nThe nameless is the Dao/Way blending into unity.\nHeaven and Earth in their entirety,\nBefore differentiation, is called the *Uncarved Block*.\nHeaven and Earth hold a single tiny thing in the void,\nThus the *Uncarved Block*, though small.\n\nYet the sage uses it to become *officials and leaders*,\nAnd all under Heaven dare not subject it or humble themselves before it.\n\nThe heart is the ruler’s *official*,\nThe sovereign of the five *viscera*—\nIf one could preserve the Dao/Way of unity,\nThe body would be *emptied* and all things would come,\nWhat would not come as guests?\nWhen the heart is *non-acting* and *harmonious qi* returns,\nSweet dew descends,\nNo one commands it, yet it is evenly distributed.\n\nAt first, the Dao/Way was one.\nThe nameless is the mother of all things—\nHeaven and Earth are such.\nOnly the one can govern Heaven and Earth,\nThus it is said: *At first, the Dao/Way had no name*.\n\nYet within us,\nWe should observe the Dao/Way of Heaven,\nAnd once the name exists,\nWe should also know when to stop.\nThose who know when to stop\nDo not fall into peril.\nThe Dao/Way in all under Heaven,\nIs like streams and valleys to the rivers and seas.\nThe natural Dao/Way,\nUnites with the *essence/nature* (性).\nThe rivers and seas are good at descending,\nYet they do not desire the water of streams and valleys—\nThe water of streams and valleys naturally flows to them.\nIf people can know when to stop and be *emptied* and *non-acting*,\nThe Dao/Way is not desired—\nThe Dao/Way naturally returns to them.\n\n**Chapter XXXIII: Knowing Others is Wisdom**\nKnowing others is wisdom,\nKnowing oneself is enlightenment.\nOvercoming others is strength,\nOvercoming oneself is power.\n\nKnowing contentment is wealth,\nStriving with vigor is aspiration.\nNot losing one’s place is longevity,\nDying yet not perishing is life.\n\nTo act outwardly and observe others is wisdom,\nTo act inwardly and observe oneself is enlightenment,\nThus it is said: *Knowing others is wisdom, knowing oneself is enlightenment*.\n\nTo dare to act with boldness and govern others with firmness is strength,\nTo dare not to act and conquer oneself with gentleness is power,\nThus it is said: *Overcoming others is strength, overcoming oneself is power*.\n\nOnly the *perfected sage* (至人) strives to know oneself and not to know others,\nStrives to overcome oneself and not to overcome others.\n\nTheir self-knowledge,\nEmbodies the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd external desires cannot move the heart,\nThus they settle contentedly in their portion—\nThis is called *knowing contentment is wealth*.\n\nTheir self-overcoming,\nEmbodies the Dao/Way of the *Great Way*,\nAnd external things cannot conquer their aspiration,\nThus they strive endlessly—\nThis is called *striving with vigor is aspiration*.\n\nExternal desires cannot move the heart,\nThis is to *conceal oneself within the body* and not emerge,\nThus it follows with *not losing one’s place is longevity*.」\n\n「外物不能胜乎志者，心死於物而神存也，故继以死而不忘者寿。\nThe heart, though dead to external things, retains its spirit—\nThus, to die yet never forget is called *longevity*.\n\n非体天地道者，孰能与於此哉？\nWho, not embodying the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,\nCould ever share in this?\n\n**大道泛兮，章第三十四**\n**The Great Way is boundless—Chapter Thirty-Four**\n\n大道泛兮，其可左右。\nThe Great Way is boundless, yet it can be turned left or right.\n\n万物恃之以生而不辞，功成不居。\nAll things rely upon it to live, yet it does not refuse,\nIts deeds accomplished, it claims no credit.\n\n衣被万物而不为主，故常无欲，可名於小矣；\nIt clothes and covers all things yet does not rule them,\nThus it ever lacks desire—\nThis may be called *the small*.\n\n万物归之而不知主，可名於大矣。\nAll things return to it yet it knows no ruler—\nThis may be called *the great*.\n\n是以圣人终不为大，故能成其大。\nTherefore, the sage never claims to be great,\nAnd thus is able to accomplish greatness.\n\n阳可左而不可右，故能生而不能成。\nThe Yang can be turned left but not right,\nThus it can give birth yet cannot complete.\n\n阴可右而不可左，故能成而不能生。\nThe Yin can be turned right but not left,\nThus it can complete yet cannot give birth.\n\n唯大道泛兮，能阴能阳，能生能成，是以或左或右，无乎不可也。\nOnly the Great Way is boundless,\nCapable of both Yin and Yang,\nOf both giving birth and completing—\nThus it can be turned left or right without limit.\n\n得此道以在天，故万物恃之以生而不辞；\nTo attain this Way in Heaven,\nAll things rely upon it to live, yet it does not refuse;\n\n得此道以在地，故功成不名有。\nTo attain this Way on Earth,\nIts deeds accomplished, it claims no credit.\n\n生之者，天也。\nThe giver of birth is Heaven.\n\n成之者，地也。\nThe completer is Earth.\n\n天地之道，覆养万物而不为主，故常无欲。\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth\nNurtures and covers all things yet does not rule them,\nThus it ever lacks desire.\n\n然天地肖道，其细也夫，故可名於小矣。\nYet Heaven and Earth resemble the Dao,\nThough in their subtlety—\nThus they may be called *the small*.\n\n惟大道泛兮，万物归之而不为主，故可名於大矣。\nOnly the Great Way is boundless,\nAll things return to it yet it knows no ruler—\nThus it may be called *the great*.\n\n大者，道之强名也。\nGreatness is the Dao’s forceful name.\n\n是以圣人虚静无欲，体於天地，故终不为大，而常然之道不期而自归之，故能成其大也。\nTherefore, the sage remains empty, tranquil, and without desire,\nEmbodying the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,\nNever claiming greatness—\nYet the Way itself spontaneously returns,\nThus the sage accomplishes true greatness.\n\n**执大象，章第三十五**\n**Holding the Great Form—Chapter Thirty-Five**\n\n执大象，天下往。\nHolding the Great Form, the world comes.\n\n往而不害，安平泰。\nComing yet causing no harm, it brings ease, tranquility, and boundless peace.\n\n乐与饵，过客止。\nDelight and bait—\nTravelers pause when they arrive.\n\n道之出言，淡乎其无味。\nThe Dao’s spoken expression is bland, without flavor.\n\n视之不足见，听之不足闻，用之不可既。\nTo look upon it is insufficient to see,\nTo listen is insufficient to hear,\nTo use it is never to exhaust.\n\n大象无形者，道也。\nThe Great Form without form is the Dao.\n\n执大象，天下往者，以道莅天下也。\nHolding the Great Form, the world comes—\nThis is to govern the world with the Dao.\n\n有道则民之攸坚，故往而不害，安平泰。\nWhen the Dao is present, the people have a firm foundation,\nThus coming yet causing no harm,\nIt brings ease, tranquility, and boundless peace.\n\n盖法天道虚而容，故安而不扰；\nIt follows the Dao/Way of Heaven—\nEmpty yet all-encompassing,\nThus it brings ease without disturbance.\n\n法地道载而宁，故平而不陂；\nIt follows the Dao/Way of Earth—\nBearing yet tranquil,\nThus it brings tranquility without unevenness.\n\n法大道和而通，故泰而不塞。\nIt follows the Great Way—\nHarmonious yet open,\nThus it brings boundless peace without obstruction.\n\n若是者，物物不干，何害之有？\nIf such is the case,\nThings do not interfere with one another—\nWhat harm could there be?\n\n世之人悦於声，而不知天道。\nPeople of the world delight in sound,\nYet they do not know the Dao/Way of Heaven.\n\n所谓声声者，美於味，而不知地道。\nWhat is called *sound-sound* (聲聲),\nIs pleasing to the palate,\nYet they do not know the Dao/Way of Earth.\n\n所谓味味者，故着於嗜欲而久处之，不知有道者以此为蘧庐尔。\nWhat is called *flavor-flavor* (味味),\nThey cling to their cravings and dwell long therein,\nThose who do not know the Dao\nTake this as their *hut of decay*.\n\n乐以声言也，声之所声者彰矣，而声声者未尝发。\nDelight is expressed through sound,\nThe source of sound is clear,\nYet *sound-sound* never truly emits.\n\n饵以味言也，味之所味者尝矣，而味味者未尝呈。\nBait is expressed through flavor,\nThe source of flavor is tasted,\nYet *flavor-flavor* never truly presents.\n\n道之出江，淡乎其无味，则所谓声声味味者也。\nThe Dao’s emergence is like water—\nBland, without flavor,\nThus it is what is called *sound-sound* and *flavor-flavor*.\n\n以道莅天下者，得大道泰而妙，故视之不足见；\nTo govern the world with the Dao,\nOne attains the Great Way’s boundless peace and subtlety,\nThus to look upon it is insufficient to see;\n\n得天道安而玄，故听之不足闻；\nOne attains the Dao/Way of Heaven’s ease and profundity,\nThus to listen is insufficient to hear;\n\n得地道平而广，故用之不可既。\nOne attains the Dao/Way of Earth’s tranquility and vastness,\nThus to use it is never to exhaust.\n\n直将还一世於澹泊，岂使民以嗜欲累其心哉？\nRather, it would return the world to simplicity and stillness,\nHow could it burden the people with cravings?\n\n**将欲歙之，章第三十六**\n**When One is About to Withdraw It—Chapter Thirty-Six**\n\n将欲歙之，必固张之；\nWhen one is about to withdraw it, one must first firmly expand it.\n\n将欲弱之，必固强之；\nWhen one is about to weaken it, one must first firmly strengthen it.\n\n将欲废之，必固兴之；\nWhen one is about to abandon it, one must first firmly establish it.\n\n将欲夺之，必固与之。\nWhen one is about to take it away, one must first firmly give it.\n\n是谓微明。\nThis is called *subtle clarity*.\n\n柔之胜刚，弱之胜强。\nSoftness overcomes hardness,\nWeakness overcomes strength.\n\n鱼不可脱於渊，国之利器，不可以一不人。\nFish cannot be removed from the depths,\nNation’s *sharp tools*—\nThey cannot be used without harm.\n\n利器示人，欲心乱矣。\nTo display *sharp tools* to others,\nThe desire-heart is thrown into disorder.\n\n唯有道者体天道之虚，於吾心本无所张也，何必歙之？\nOnly those who possess the Dao embody the Dao/Way of Heaven’s emptiness,\nIn my heart, there is originally nothing to expand—\nWhy must I withdraw it?\n\n将欲歙之者，必固张之而已。\nWhen one is about to withdraw it,\nOne must first firmly expand it—\nThat is all.\n\n体大道之夷，於吾欲心本无所强也，何必弱之？\nEmbodying the Great Way’s simplicity,\nIn my desire-heart, there is originally nothing to strengthen—\nWhy must I weaken it?\n\n将欲弱之者，必固强之而已。\nWhen one is about to weaken it,\nOne must first firmly strengthen it—\nThat is all.\n\n体王道之正，於吾欲心本无所兴也，何又废之？\nEmbodying the *Kingly Way’s* rectitude,\nIn my desire-heart, there is originally nothing to establish—\nWhy must I abandon it?\n\n将欲废之者，必固兴之而已。\nWhen one is about to abandon it,\nOne must first firmly establish it—\nThat is all.\n\n体地道之静，於吾欲心本无所与也，何必夺之？\nEmbodying the Dao/Way of Earth’s stillness,\nIn my desire-heart, there is originally nothing to give—\nWhy must I take it away?\n\n将欲夺之者，必固与之而已。\nWhen one is about to take it away,\nOne must first firmly give it—\nThat is all.\n\n此四者，皆欲於利器。\nThese four actions all concern the use of *sharp tools*.\n\n利器者地道，故是谓微明。\n*Sharp tools* are the Dao/Way of Earth,\nThus this is called *subtle clarity*.\n\n何则？\nWhy?\n\n柔弱处上，神器也。\nSoftness and weakness dwell above—\nThese are *divine tools*.\n\n刚强居下，利器也。\nHardness and strength dwell below—\nThese are *sharp tools*.\n\n圣人处於柔弱，不以利器动乎心，故以柔胜刚，以弱胜强。\nThe sage dwells in softness and weakness,\nDoes not use *sharp tools* to move the heart,\nThus he overcomes hardness with softness,\nAnd strength with weakness.\n\n胡不知鱼在水中，水在鱼中，人在道中，道在人中，\nHow could one not know?\nFish dwell in water, yet water dwells in fish,\nMan dwells in the Dao, yet the Dao dwells in man,\n\n鱼脱於渊丧乎躯矣，利器示人丧乎道矣。\nFish removed from the depths lose their bodies,\n*Sharp tools* displayed to others lose the Dao.\n\n**道常无为，章第三十七**\n**The Dao is Ever Non-Action—Chapter Thirty-Seven**\n\n道常无为而无不为，侯王若能守，万物将自化。\nThe Dao is ever non-action yet nothing is left undone,\nIf lords and kings could guard it,\nAll things would spontaneously transform.\n\n化而欲作，吾将镇以无名之朴。\nIf transformation is sought yet action is desired,\nI would govern it with the *nameless simplicity*.\n\n无名之朴，亦将不欲。\nThe *nameless simplicity* would also not desire.\n\n不欲以静，天下将自正。\nWithout desire, it would remain still,\nThe world would spontaneously align itself.\n\n常然之道，无为也。\nThe constant Dao is non-action.\n\n天地之道，无为而无不为也。\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth is non-action yet nothing is left undone.\n\n然天地法道，为出於无为，故曰道常无为而无不为。\nYet Heaven and Earth follow the Dao,\nTheir action arises from non-action,\nThus it is said: *The Dao is ever non-action yet nothing is left undone*.\n\n侯王法天地，若能守道以御世，则万物化之，\nLords and kings follow Heaven and Earth,\nIf they could guard the Dao to govern the world,\nThen all things would transform of themselves,\n\n若性之自为而不知为之者，故曰侯王若能守，万物将自化。\nAs if by their own nature they would act without knowing why—\nThus it is said: *If lords and kings could guard the Dao, all things would spontaneously transform*.\n\n夫化而欲作者，将有为而起之也，\nNow, if transformation is sought yet action is desired,\nIt would be to create action through action,\n\n圣人於是镇之以无名之朴，\nThe sage would govern this with the *nameless simplicity*,\n使复於无为。\nTo return it to non-action.\n\n「The *nameless simplicity* is the Dao of Heaven and Earth.\nAll things follow their transformation—who dares to desire anything?\nThus it is also said: *It does not desire*.\nIts *not desiring* is merely *stillness*.\nStillness and non-action bring about the self-regulation of the world.\n\n*Virtue/Power* is both high and low, yet spoken of in two ways.\nFrom *ren* downward, it speaks only of the high—\nthe low is already beneath consideration.\n\nAs for *wisdom* as *foreknowledge*,\nit is not even mentioned in its higher form—\nthus it is even more inferior to *li*.\n\nExhausting thought and straining the mind,\ngrinding and sharpening it—\nhence it is called *the adornment of the Dao*.\nWearying the heart and laboring the spirit,\nto lose one’s natural purity—\nhence it is called *the beginning of folly*.\n\nNot speaking of *li* while speaking of *wisdom* is already disorderly in *virtue/Power*,\nand *wisdom* contradicts the Dao.\nThus the true man dwells in the substance of *virtue/Power*,\nnot in its shallow adornment;\nhe abides in the reality of the Dao,\nnot in the embellishment of *wisdom*.\nHence he discards that which is the adornment of the human Dao,\nand takes this which is the substance of the Dao of Immortality.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine: *The Ancient Attainment of the One***\n\nThe ancient attainment of the One—\nHeaven attains the One and becomes clear,\nEarth attains the One and becomes tranquil,\nThe spirit attains the One and becomes responsive,\nThe grain attains the One and becomes full,\nAll things attain the One and become alive,\nLords and kings attain the One to establish order for the world.\n\nIf the One were lost—\nHeaven would fear collapse without its clarity,\nEarth would fear upheaval without its tranquility,\nThe spirit would fear stagnation without its responsiveness,\nThe grain would fear depletion without its fullness,\nAll things would fear extinction without their aliveness,\nAnd lords and kings would fear ruin without their order—\nthus the noble would be high, yet the humble would be its root,\nthe elevated would be low, yet the base would be its foundation.\n\nHence lords and kings call themselves *lonely* and *widowed*—\nthis is their way of making the humble the root, is it not?\nIs it not so?\n\nThus, the attainment of the One is achieved without *wuyu* (vehicle),\nnot desiring to be smooth and lustrous like jade,\nnor to be rough and solid like stone.\n\nThe One is the Dao.\nBefore form, it is the origin of all—\nindistinct and uncarved from ancient times—\nthen things attain it.\n\nHeaven is firm and opened above,\nusing non-action as its function,\nthus it attains the Dao and becomes clear.\n\nEarth is settled and rests below,\nusing stillness as its nature,\nthus it attains the Dao and becomes tranquil.\n\nThe spirit is hidden in the profound,\nunfathomable by yin and yang,\nthus it attains the Dao and becomes responsive.\n\nThe grain is empty yet conforms to Heaven’s Dao—\nsince Heaven attains the Dao and becomes clear,\nthe grain attains the Dao and becomes full.\n\nThings cease yet nurture Earth’s Dao—\nsince Earth attains the Dao and becomes tranquil,\nthings attain the Dao and become alive.\n\nThe spirit unites with the body,\nthe sovereign of all limbs,\nthe spirit is the sovereign of all saints,\nthe sovereign of all under Heaven—\nsince the spirit attains the Dao and becomes responsive,\nlords and kings attain the Dao to establish order for the world.\n\nThis attainment is achieved through the Dao alone.\nIf Heaven loses its clarity,\nit will have no way to cover,\nand will fear collapse.\n」\n\nEarth loses its tranquility,\nand thus has no way to bear,\nfearing it will erupt.\n\nThe spirit loses its responsiveness,\nand thus has no way to guard,\nfearing it will falter.\n\nIf Heaven loses its clarity,\nthen the grain loses its fullness and fears exhaustion.\nIf Earth loses its tranquility,\nthen things lose their vitality and fear annihilation.\nIf the spirit loses its responsiveness,\nthen lords and kings lose their order and fear collapse.\n\nYet when the lowly is embraced, its nobility is revealed;\nwhen the humble is attached, its height is displayed—\njust as hills and mountains accumulate the low to become high,\nand rivers and seas gather waters to become vast.\nGreat ones unite the scattered to become sovereigns,\nso those of noble height must not abandon their foundation.\n\nThus, lords and kings reside in unity within their domains,\nhence they call themselves \"lonely and meager,\"\ndrawing qi from the Great Harmony,\nhence they call themselves \"not-grain.\"\n\nWith a hundred limbs, the body’s sovereign attains nobility,\nwith a hundred subjects, the sovereign of all under Heaven attains reverence.\nLords and kings attain these titles of noble height—\nis it not because they take the lowly as their foundation?\n\nTo forge a carriage, one gathers examples from nearby.\nNow, if you assemble the axle, wheels, and spokes to form a carriage,\nand then count its many parts before assembling them,\nit would be insufficient to attain the carriage.\nOnly when the axle, wheels, and spokes are combined\ndoes the carriage earn its name as a means of conveyance;\nonly when the humble subjects are united\ndoes the lord and king attain the title of noble height.\n\nJade is noble,\nstone is lowly.\nJade emerges from stone,\nso even nobility has its roots in the lowly.\n\nYet jade has inherent substance and thus attains nobility,\nwhile a lord and king, though possessing one domain,\ndoes not inherently attain nobility—\ncould they truly be like jade and stone?\n\n**Chapter Forty: The Movement of the Dao Through Reversal**\nReversal is the movement of the Dao,\nweakness is the function of the Dao.\n\nAll things under Heaven are born from existence,\nexistence is born from non-existence.\n\nTranquility is the Dao of Earth.\nTo reverse Earth’s tranquility into motion\nis the yin responding to the yang,\nthus it is said: *Reversal is the movement of the Dao.*\n\nWeakness is the Dao of Heaven.\nTo employ Heaven’s weakness as function\nis the yang responding to the yin,\nthus it is said: *Weakness is the function of the Dao.*\n\nThe yang employs non-action for its function,\nthe yin employs existence for its substance.\nWhen yin and yang interact in the boundless void,\nthings are born.\n\nAll things arise from Earth’s Dao,\nthus it is said: *All things under Heaven are born from existence*—\nthis is the movement of the Dao through reversal.\n\nYet what has form cannot thrive without Heaven’s Dao,\nthus it is said: *Existence is born from non-existence*—\nthis is the function of the Dao through weakness.\n\nThus the sages say:\nExistence takes non-existence as its mother,\nnon-existence takes emptiness as its mother,\nemptiness takes the Dao as its mother.\n\nNature is the root of the Dao.\nIf one can preserve and guard the Mysterious Pivot,\nconforming to nature,\nthen from motion arises stillness,\nand function returns to substance—\nthus one will return to the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: The Superior Person Hears the Dao**\nThe superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it;\nthe mediocre person hears the Dao and holds it uncertainly;\nthe inferior person hears the Dao and laughs at it—\nif they do not laugh, it is not the Dao.\n\nThus the ancient teachings say:\nThe Dao appears obscure when illuminated,\nadvances when retreating,\nis level when uneven,\nvirtue is great when humble,\nbrightness is supreme when stained,\nbroad virtue is vast when insufficient,\nestablished virtue is firm when seemingly lazy,\nauthentic simplicity is true when appearing flawed,\nthe greatest square has no corners,\nthe greatest vessel is fashioned last,\nthe greatest sound is inaudible,\nthe greatest form is shapeless,\nthe Dao is hidden and nameless.\n\nOnly the Dao is good at lending and completing.\nThe superior person, having already understood the Dao,\nbelieves in it deeply and guards it firmly,\nand upon hearing, they must act upon it with vigor.\n\nThe mediocre person seeks to advance through the Dao,\nstriving to succeed, yet without effort, they fail;\npondering to attain, yet without thought, they do not.\nThey waver between presence and absence,\nand even after hearing, they retain doubts,\nthus they remain uncertain between action and inaction.\n\nThe inferior person takes the Dao as level,\nlike a rustic ear unable to hear great sounds,\nlike common minds rejecting profound speech.\nWhen they hear the Dao, they must scorn it,\nthus they oppose it entirely and laugh derisively.\n\nIf the Dao is not scorned by the inferior,\nhow different would it be from what rustic ears hear\nor what common tongues speak?\nHow could it truly be the Dao?\n\nThus the ancient teachings say:\nThe Dao appears obscure when illuminated—\nonly through constant night and day reflection,\nproper meditation, and diligent practice\ncan it be attained.\n\nThe Dao advances when retreating—\nif measured by the day, it seems insufficient,\nbut if measured by the year, it has surplus.\nIf one remains unburdened by existence and non-existence,\nit may be achieved.\n\nThe Dao is level when uneven—\nif one clings to the attainable forms, colors, names, and sounds,\nor to the desires of the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth,\nthen laughter at the Dao is an error.\n\nYet do they not know that the Four Great Elements exist within their domains,\nyet do not transcend the Dao?\n\nGreat virtue is the Dao of Heaven.\nHeaven’s Dao is empty yet full,\nand because it is empty,\nit is like a valley.\n\nGreat brightness is the Kingly Dao.\nThe Kingly Dao, when worn, renews itself,\nand because it is worn,\nit is like a stain.\n\nBroad virtue, spoken of in terms of Earth’s Dao,\nis used without depletion yet appears incomplete,\nthus it seems insufficient.\n\nEstablished virtue, spoken of in terms of the Great Dao,\nis built unshakably yet refined unnoticeably,\nthus it seems lazy.\n\nBecause it is like a valley, like a stain,\nlike insufficiency, like laziness,\none doubts its true nature has changed.\nYet its essence as great virtue, as supreme brightness,\nas broad virtue, as established virtue remains constant—\nthis is called *authentic simplicity appearing flawed.*\n\nWhy does authentic simplicity appear flawed?\nBecause the greatest square has no corners,\nthe greatest vessel is fashioned last,\nthe greatest sound is inaudible,\nthe greatest form is shapeless.\n\nThe greatest square encompasses all,\nits virtue boundless—\nthus it has no corners.\nThe greatest vessel is used for long in its Dao—\nthus it is fashioned last.\nThe greatest sound speaks not,\nyet the four seasons follow—\nthus it is inaudible.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 42: The Dao Gives Rise to One**\n\nThe greatest form has no substance,\nYet the world turns toward it—\nThus it is shapeless.\n\nThis is why the four great things are great.\nVirtue is encompassed by the Dao,\nThe Dao is encompassed by Heaven.\nThe virtue of sages and kings aligns with the Dao of Heaven and Earth,\nYet it remains nameless—\nThe origin of Heaven and Earth,\nWhere the Dao dwells in concealment.\n\nIf one divides the four great things among the lands,\nEach is but its manifest Dao,\nAnd the names imposed upon them are forced.\n\nThe Dao is not inherently a thing to be bestowed,\nYet through Heaven, Earth, and the sages and kings,\nIt embodies the Dao to perfect the world—\nThus the name of bestowal arises,\nAnd the effects of partiality take root.\n\nYet its completion is but natural—\nWho could have a mind to coerce its fulfillment?\n\nThe Dao gives rise to One,\nOne gives rise to Two,\nTwo gives rise to Three,\nThree gives rise to myriad things.\n\nMyriad things draw upon the yin and embrace the yang,\nAnd their harmonizing *qi* is the result of mingling.\nWhat people abhor,\nAre the solitary, the widowed, and the unfilled—\nYet the sages and kings hold them as their ideal.\n\nThus, some things are diminished to be increased,\nAnd increased to be diminished.\n\nWhat people are taught,\nIs also my righteous teaching.\nThe overbearing perish without their proper end—\nI shall take this as my guiding principle.\n\nChangeable yet unified, the origin of One—\nThus it is said, *the Dao gives rise to One*.\nOne is the beginning of form’s transformation,\nThe greatest form within Heaven and Earth—\nThus it is said, *One gives rise to Two*.\nHeaven and Earth establish their positions,\nAnd humanity dwells within—\nThus the Three Powers are complete—\nThus it is said, *Two gives rise to Three*.\nThe light and clear ascend to become Heaven,\nThe heavy and turbid descend to become Earth,\nThe mingling and harmonizing *qi* becomes humanity—\nThen Heaven and Earth contain their essence,\nAnd myriad things are born and transformed—\nThus it is said, *Three gives rise to myriad things*.\nHeaven, as yang, sternly emerges—\nThen the yin ascends to meet the yang,\nAnd things draw upon it.\nEarth, as yin, vibrantly unfolds—\nThen the yang descends to meet the yin,\nAnd things embrace it.\nAs yin and yang rise and fall,\nTheir mutual interaction brings forth\nThe mingling and harmonizing *qi*—\nThus it is said, *myriad things draw upon the yin and embrace the yang,\nAnd their harmonizing qi is the result of mingling*.\n\nWithin a single human body,\nThe likeness of Heaven and Earth is displayed—\nYin, yang, and mingling *qi* are all contained therein,\nYet there is also the most divine\nWho governs it.\n\nJust as the sages and kings align with Heaven and Earth,\nWithin this realm, the greatest is the solitary,\nAnd one who draws upon the *qi* of Great Harmony is unfilled.\nThe people of the world oppose the divine,\nYet they reverse it and call it evil—\nWhile the sages and kings alone take this upon themselves—\nThus it is said, *what people abhor,\nAre the solitary, the widowed, and the unfilled—\nYet the sages and kings hold them as their ideal*.\n\nThe mingling and harmonizing *qi* of yin and yang permeates all things,\nNaturally neither diminishing nor increasing—\nYet through Heaven and Earth’s fullness and emptiness,\nAnd their correspondence with the seasons,\nSometimes it is diminished to be increased,\nAnd increased to be diminished.\n\nWhat people are taught,\nIs also the rectitude of Heaven and Earth—\nI prefer tranquility, yet the people naturally align.\nThis is my righteous teaching—\nThis is called *diminished to be increased*.\nThe overbearing oppose this—\nThus they do not meet their proper end—\nThis is called *increased to be diminished*.\n\nThe sage observes this,\nAnd takes it as a warning—\nThus I shall use it as my guiding principle.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 43: The Most Supreme Softness**\n\nThe most supreme softness in the world,\nRides across the world’s most supreme firmness.\n\nWithout any entry into the boundless,\nIt is known that non-action benefits greatly.\nThe teaching of silent speech,\nThe benefit of non-action—\nFew in the world can attain it.\n\nThe most supreme softness is the spirit.\nThe most supreme firmness is form.\nThe true spirit aligns with the Dao,\nCapable of vanishing and enduring—\nOnly when the spirit governs form,\nCan the spirit make form soar,\nAnd form follow in its boundless course—\nThus it is said, *the most supreme softness in the world,\nRides across the world’s most supreme firmness*.\n\nThe most supreme softness is without substance,\nThe most supreme firmness is without gaps.\nWhen form governs form,\nThere are gaps that form can enter—\nThus the boundless without gaps cannot be entered.\nWhen the spirit governs form,\nThe spirit can permeate without gaps—\nYet it also cannot be entered without attaining its own accord—\nThus it is said, *without any entry into the boundless*.\n\nWhat form transforms,\nIs the teaching of silent speech.\nWhat the spirit attains,\nIs the benefit of non-action.\nIf one can embody the Dao of Heaven and Earth,\nDwell in non-action,\nAnd practice the teaching of silent speech,\nThen one shapes form and aligns with spirit—\nForm and spirit both attain perfection,\nAnd one’s essence merges with the Dao’s truth.\n\nThe world values spoken teaching and favors action,\nThus few can attain this.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 44: Names and Bodies**\n\nBetween names and bodies, which is more intimate?\nBetween bodies and wealth, which is more abundant?\nBetween gain and loss, which causes greater harm?\n\nThus, the more one loves excessively,\nThe greater the cost.\nThe more one hoards,\nThe heavier the loss.\n\nKnowing contentment brings no shame,\nKnowing restraint brings no peril—\nThus one can endure long.\n\nThe noble ponder day and night,\nWorrying over good and evil,\nYet their bodies are also worn thin—\nThus the error of sacrificing body for name—\nHow can one see what is truly intimate,\nWhen it lies in the body, not in the name?\n\nThe wealthy exhaust their bodies with labor,\nAmassing wealth yet unable to use it all—\nTheir bodies are also strained externally—\nThus the error of sacrificing body for profit—\nHow can one see what is truly abundant,\nWhen it lies in the body, not in wealth?\n\nYet honor and disgrace are established,\nAnd one sees what causes harm—\nWealth and goods are gathered,\nAnd one sees what is contested—\nThose who value the manifest as true,\nKnow that names are the source of honor—\nThose who value riches as true,\nKnow that wealth is the source of profit—\nThus they see gain and forget their bodies,\nSee profit and forget their true nature.\n\nThen, between gain and loss,\nWhich truly causes greater harm?\n\nWhat is lost,\nIs the nameless simplicity,\nThe unadorned frame—\nNo greater harm exists than this.\n\nThus, to love names excessively while unaware of restraint,\nThe greater loss will surely be incurred.\nThe greater refers to the Dao’s ideal—\nThe nameless simplicity itself.\n\nTo hoard wealth while unaware of contentment,\nThe heavier loss will surely be incurred.\nThe heavier refers to virtue’s substance—\nThe unadorned frame itself.\n\nOnly the sage embodies the broad virtue,\nKnows contentment without valuing wealth as noble—\nThus they suffer no shame.\n\nThe sage embodies the broad virtue’s knowing restraint,\nYet does not exalt their name—\nThus they face no peril.\n\nIf such is their way, they endure eternally,\nAnd stand equal with Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Chapter 45: The Great Fullness as if Deficient**\nThe great fullness seems deficient—\nIts use is inexhaustible.\nThe great excess seems empty—\nIts use is boundless.\nThe most straight seems bent,\nThe most skillful seems clumsy,\nThe most eloquent seems tongue-tied.\n\nAgitation overcomes cold,\nStillness overcomes heat,\nAnd serene stillness is the norm for all under Heaven.\n\nThe great fullness is Earth’s virtue—\nBroad virtue seems insufficient,\nThus though complete, it seems deficient.\nThe great excess is Heaven’s virtue—\nHigh virtue does not revel in itself,\nThus though full, it seems hollow.\n\nIf completion is like a mountain,\nIts accumulation will crumble—\nNot true great fullness.\nThe great fullness seems deficient,\nNever crumbling—\nThus its use is inexhaustible.\n\nIf excess is like piled water,\nIts flow will dry up—\nNot true great excess.\nThe great excess seems hollow,\nNever drying up—\nThus its use is boundless.\n\nThese two are Heaven and Earth’s functions—\nYin and Yang.\n\nHeaven can generate without ceasing,\nYet its generative use is boundless.\nEarth can transform without ceasing,\nYet its transformative use is inexhaustible—\nThus the Dao acts truly within them.\n\nOnly the unified is threefold,\nHence by observing Heaven and Earth, the Dao may be known.\nIf divided, then:\nThe most straight seems bent—\nThis is Earth’s Way.\nEarth’s Way is straight yet restrained,\nThus it seems clumsy.\n\nThe most skillful seems clumsy—\nThis is the Constant Way,\nThe Constant Way carves myriad forms yet does not vie for skill,\nThus it seems clumsy.\n\nThe most eloquent seems tongue-tied—\nThis is Heaven’s Way.\nHeaven’s Way speaks not yet responds well,\nThus it seems tongue-tied.\n\nYet considering their essence,\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast,\nThey do not depart from Yin and Yang,\nAnd one Yin, one Yang—\nThis is the Dao.\nThus accumulated Yang is Heaven,\nAccumulated Yin is Earth.\nYin is still, Yang is restless,\nYang is hot, Yin is cold.\nWhat governs Yin is Yang,\nThus agitation overcomes cold.\nWhat governs Yang is Yin,\nThus stillness overcomes heat.\n\nYet cold departs and heat arrives,\nHeat departs and cold returns—\nHow could their use ever be exhausted or worn out?\n\nThe Dao has clarity and turbidity,\nMovement and stillness.\nClarity is the source of turbidity,\nStillness is the foundation of movement.\nIf one can always remain serene and still,\nHeaven and Earth will all submit—\nWhat of things?\nWhat of affairs?\nThus it is said: Serene stillness is the norm for all under Heaven.\n\n**Chapter 46: When the World Has the Dao**\nWhen the world has the Dao,\nWarhorses are turned to manure.\nWhen the world lacks the Dao,\nWarhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\nNo guilt is greater than desiring what is desirable,\nNo calamity is greater than not knowing contentment,\nNo blame is greater than coveting gain.\nThus, true contentment is ever content.\n\nThose who govern the world with the Dao\nAlways keep the people ignorant and desireless,\nThus each finds peace in their place and does not contend—\nThey merely till their fields.\n\nIn the declining ages, when the Dao cannot be revived,\nThey see what is desirable yet do not know contentment,\nThen arises the heart of coveting gain,\nAnd they begin to seize, plunder, and encroach,\nWhile warhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\nReflecting upon oneself,\nWithin is one’s own world.\nIf the Dao is within oneself,\nOne rests in their measure,\nAnd guards their inch of land with vigor.\nIf the Dao is lost within oneself,\nOne gallops and hunts recklessly,\nAnd the heart runs wild—\nAlready, the inch of land is lost.\n\nThus no guilt is greater than desiring what is desirable,\nNo calamity is greater than not knowing contentment,\nNo blame is greater than coveting gain—\nAll stem from failing to rest in one’s measure.\n\nWhen this is carried to excess,\nContention and plunder follow.\nIf one can return to the measure of life and nature,\nAnd restrain one’s intentions and desires,\nCold and calm in self-cultivation,\nThen sufficiency is found within oneself—\nWhat lack could there be?\nThis is how true contentment is ever content.\n\n**Chapter 47: Not Leaving the Door**\nNot leaving the door,\nYet knowing the world;\nNot peering through the window,\nYet seeing the Dao.\nThe farther one goes,\nThe less one knows.\n\nThus the sage acts not yet knows,\nSees not yet names,\nDoes not act yet achieves.\n\nThe world is the nine regions, mountains, rivers, seas—\nTeeming with ceaseless life.\nThe Dao is the four seasons, Yin and Yang, winds and rains—\nEndless transformation.\n\nReflecting upon oneself,\nNothing is not perfectly formed.\nThus the sage says:\n“I share with Heaven and Earth one breath and govern together.”\nIf one understands this,\nOne need not leave the door or peer through the window\nTo see and know Heaven and Earth’s Dao.\n\nIf one seeks the Dao beyond oneself,\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows—\nHow could one know that within one’s own body,\nTen thousand principles are fully present?\nNearly taking from this,\nNothing is lacking.\n\nThus the sage embodies Earth’s Way,\nWith emptiness as body,\nHence acts not yet knows—\nNo need to leave the door.\nEmbodies Heaven’s Way,\nWith non-action as heart,\nHence sees not yet names—\nNo need to peer through the window.\nEmbodies the Great Dao,\nWith naturalness as constant,\nHence does not act yet achieves—\nNo need to exert wisdom or strength in what is seen or done.\n\n**Chapter 48: Learning and the Dao**\nLearning increases daily,\nThe Dao decreases daily.\nDecrease again, decrease—\nUntil non-action,\nYet nothing remains undone.\n\nThus to take the world,\nOne must act with non-interference.\nWhen action arises,\nIt is insufficient to take the world.\n\nThe scholar seeks to exhaust principles,\nThus daily increase.\nThe Daoist seeks to fulfill nature,\nThus daily decrease.\nDecrease again, decrease—\nUntil fulfilling nature to its end—\nThis is returning to one’s original command.\n\nPrinciples have an end,\nNature has its fulfillment,\nYet still not free from action—\nHence the terms learning and Dao.\nOnly when command is fulfilled\nDoes one return to stillness—\nStillness is called returning to command,\nUntil non-action.\n\nNon-action is the time of perfect stillness,\nYet when moved, it responds and harmonizes with all under Heaven—\nThus non-action yet nothing remains undone.\n\nThe Sage and the Way of Non-Action\n\nWhen there is something to do,\nOne cannot avoid burdening the world.\nWhen there is nothing to do,\nOne cannot avoid severing oneself from the world.\n\nHow does the Sage act in the world?\nHe simply abides in non-action.\nAbiding in non-action,\nOnly then can one take the world—\nThus, those who take the world always act with non-interference.\n\nYet the world is a divine vessel,\nUnfathomable and beyond doing.\nThose who act ruin it,\nThose who grasp lose it.\nWhen matters arise,\nIt is still insufficient to take the world.\n\nKnowing the world cannot be taken by action,\nOne must instead learn what is not to be learned,\nTo reach the Dao of non-action.\n\n**Chapter 49: The Sage Has No Constant Heart**\nThe Sage has no constant heart,\nTaking the hearts of the people as his own.\nThe virtuous, I treat as virtuous;\nThe unvirtuous, I also treat as virtuous—virtue of virtue.\nThe trustworthy, I trust;\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust—virtue of trust.\n\nThe Sage in the world,\nWith a blurred and indistinct heart for the people,\nThe people all fix their ears and eyes upon him,\nAnd the Sage treats them all as children.\n\nThe Sage seeks to return to the origin,\nTo revert to the unborn—\nThus, he has no constant heart.\n\nVirtue and vice, truth and deceit—\nThese are what people do.\nI have no fixed heart within them,\nOnly following the hearts of the people as my own.\n\nWhen the people do good, I do not know it;\nWhen the people do evil, I do not know it.\nAccumulated virtue brings virtuous *qi* near—\nI do not know it as virtue, so the virtuous, I treat as virtuous.\nAccumulated vice brings malevolent *qi* near—\nI do not know it as unvirtue, so the unvirtuous, I also treat as virtuous.\nTrust and distrust are the same.\n\nI entrust it to nature,\nWith no falsehood between us—\nThis is called virtue of virtue, virtue of trust.\n\nThus, aligning virtue and vice,\nUnifying truth and deceit,\nMy heart has no partial attachments,\nHence blurred and indistinct for the world.\n\nThe people always have hearts,\nChasing the pleasures of sound and color,\nThus all fix their ears and eyes,\nUnknowing of returning their gaze inward,\nGuarding the Mother’s Dao.\n\nOnly the Sage always has no heart,\nEmbracing the world’s origin,\nReturning to guard the world’s Mother—\nThus, he treats them all as children.\n\n**Chapter 50: Birth and Death**\nBirth and death—\nThose who live, thirteen in number,\nThose who die, thirteen in number,\nAnd those who move from life to death’s domain,\nAlso thirteen in number.\n\nWhy is this?\nBecause of the excess of life’s vitality.\n\n**Chapter 50: Birth and Death (continued)**\n\n「Indeed, those who skillfully nurture life—\nOn land, they meet no rhinoceros or tiger,\nWithin armies, they are not struck by weapons.\nThe rhinoceros finds no place to thrust its horn,\nThe tiger finds no place to strike its claws,\nWeapons find no place to lodge their blades.\nWhy is this?\nBecause they dwell in a realm where death has no hold.\n\nAll things arise from the interplay of Heaven and Earth—this is called *birth*,\nAnd return to the transformations of yin and yang—this is called *death*.\nThose who follow birth and death as companions,\nHave not escaped the interplay of Heaven and Earth,\nNor have they avoided the transformations of yin and yang.\nYet, when all things move through birth and death,\nIt is said that only *human* life is driven to death’s domain—why?\nThis is all by the people’s own doing,\nNot Heaven and Earth’s destruction,\nNor the harm of spirits and gods—\nBecause they possess *knowing* and their forms are restless.\n\nThe eyes see life’s approach and cannot repel it,\nDeath’s departure and cannot halt it—why?\nBecause life’s vitality is excessive,\nAnd they are driven to death’s domain.\n\nOnly the Sage cherishes the subtle and profound,\nEmbraces the pure and unadorned,\nAnd dares not contend with the world in action.\nThough fierce beasts exist, they cannot seize him,\nThough weapons strike, they cannot harm him.\nHis accumulated virtue is deeply resonant,\nNo thing can wound him—\nThus, he dwells in a realm where death has no hold.\n\n**Chapter 51: The Dao Nurtures Life**\nThe Dao *nurtures* life,\nVirtue *nurtures* it,\nThings take their form,\nCircumstances bring them to fruition.\nThus, all things revere the Dao and honor virtue.\nThe Dao’s reverence,\nVirtue’s honor—\nNo titles bestow them, yet they endure naturally.\n\nHence, the Dao *nurtures*, *nurtures* it,\n*Lengthens*, *cultivates* it,\n*Completes*, *ripening* it,\n*Nourishes*, *protecting* it.\nIt gives birth without possession,\nActs without reliance,\nLengthens without domination—\nThis is called the *profound virtue*.\n\nFrom whence does the Dao nurture life?\nIt *nurtures* the harmonious *true qi* of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd all things arise from it—\nThis is how the Dao nurtures life,\nHence it is said: *The Dao nurtures life, virtue nurtures it*.\n\nFrom whence do things take form?\nFollowing the ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd the grasp of yin and yang—\nAll things are formed from it—\nThis is how things take form,\nHence it is said: *Things take their form, circumstances bring them to fruition*.\n\nBecause the Dao can nurture,\nAll things bow to it—\nThis is called *revering the Dao*.\nBecause virtue can *nurture*,\nAll things cannot *demean* it—\nThis is called *honoring virtue*.\n\nOnly the Dao and virtue reside in the accumulation of yang,\nNot seeking reverence or honor from things—\nThings themselves revere and honor them,\nFor from ancient times to the present,\nNo titles bestow them, yet they endure naturally.\n\nHence, the Dao *nurtures*, *nurtures* it,\n*Lengthens*, *cultivates* it,\n*Completes*, *ripening* it,\n*Nourishes*, *protecting* it—\nThis is the Dao operating between Heaven and Earth,\nAnd enduring naturally.\n\nIf one *nurtures* life without possession,\nActs without reliance,\nLengthens without domination,\nThen it aligns with the harmony of Heaven and Earth—\nThis is called the *profound virtue*.\n\n**Chapter 52: The Origin of the World**\nThe world has an origin,\nWhich we call the *Mother of the world*.\nHaving obtained its Mother,\nWe come to know her children,\nHaving known her children,\nWe return to guard its Mother—\nAnd thus, our life remains unharmed.\n\nSeal its *mouth* (兑),\nClose its *gate* (门),\nAnd we toil not our whole lives.\nOpen its *mouth*,\nAdvance its *affairs*,\nAnd we are never saved our whole lives.\n\nSeeing the small as *illumination*,\nGuarding the soft as *strength*—\nUsing its *radiance*,\nAnd returning to its *illumination*,\nWe suffer no calamity—\nThis is called *following the constant*.\n\nFirst, there is the unity of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd then the world has an origin—\nThus, it is called the *Mother of the world*.\nHaving obtained Heaven and Earth,\nAs the *Mother of the world*,\nWe know that all things are her children.\n\nHaving known her children,\nAnd returning to guard the Mother’s Dao,\nThen her children are whole.\nIndeed, people only know Heaven and Earth and all things,\nYet do not know their own source of birth.\nIf one knows this,\nAnd returns to guard the Dao of Heaven and Earth,\nThen one’s life remains unharmed.\n\nThus, those who embody the Dao of Heaven and Earth,\nEngage in *non-action*,\nFollow the *teaching of silence*—\nHence it is said: *Seal its mouth, close its gate,*\n*And we toil not our whole lives*.\n\nThose who do not know the Dao,\nSpeak much and act—\nFollowing affairs and losing the Mother’s Dao,\nHence it is said: *Open its mouth, advance its affairs,*\n*And we are never saved our whole lives*.\n\nThe small is the *unadorned* of Heaven and Earth,\nThe soft is the *profound application* of the Dao—\nOnly by self-knowing do we see the Dao of Heaven and Earth,\nHence it is said: *illumination*.\nOnly by self-mastering do we guard the Dao’s subtlety,\nHence it is said: *strength*.\n\n*Illumination* is the union of yin and yang in speech,\n*Radiance* emerges from *illumination*—\nUsing *non-action*,\nWithin oneself, it becomes wisdom and intent.\nThe Sage discards wisdom and intent,\nNot forcing but illuminating the Dao of Heaven—\nThus, he uses its *radiance*,\nAnd returns to its *illumination*.\n\n*Radiance* wasted outward is called *suffering calamity*,\nNot wasting *radiance* and returning to *illumination*—\nThis is called *following the constant*.\n\nOnly thus can one guard the Mother’s Dao.\n\n**Chapter 53: Let Me Explain Clearly**\nIf I were to explain clearly,\nAnd walk the *Great Dao*,\nI would only fear *excessive action*.\n\nThe *Great Dao* is most smooth,\nYet people love shortcuts.\nMorning is neglected,\nFields grow overgrown,\nGranaries are emptied,\nGarments adorned with fine colors,\nBelts bearing sharp blades,\nSated with delicacies,\nWealth overflowing—\nThis is called *robber’s pride*,\nNot the Dao, is it?\n\nThe streams of mountain paths,\nIf used excessively, become thoroughfares,\nIf not used, are choked with weeds.\nThe people of the world do not know the *Great Dao’s* subtlety,\nYet engage in excessive action—\nThis is how they block their own hearts.\n\nThe stirring of *nature* is called *action*,\nThe artificiality of *action* is called *loss*—\nThus, those who know fear and do not dare act.\n\nThe *Great Dao* is most smooth,\nYet when viewed, it is unseen—\nThe heart desires swiftness,\nThus, people love shortcuts and forever stray from the *Great Dao*.\n\nMoreover, the heart is the sovereign’s *minister*—\nIf the heart is restless,\nThen even a single *inch of field* is lost,\nAnd if a single *inch of field* is lost,\nThen the harmonious *qi* does not descend,\nAnd if the harmonious *qi* does not descend,\nThen the *Great Granary* is emptied—\nHence it is said: *Morning is neglected, fields grow overgrown,*\n*The granaries are emptied*.\n\nBecause of this,\nThere are distinctions in rank,\nThere are contests of seizing,\nThere is the enjoyment of the five flavors—\nThus, fine garments and adornments,\nBelts bearing sharp blades,\nSated with delicacies—\nAnd if wealth overflows,\nThen all its harms are gathered at their root.»\n\nThis is called the labor of plundering the *Dao* and the body,\nYet those who do not know still boast of their own talents and abilities without ceasing—\nHow can this be called *stealing* and *boasting*? It is not the *Way*!\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Four: The Unshaken Foundation**\n\nOne who builds well does not topple,\nOne who embraces well does not slip—\nThus, descendants continue sacrifices without ceasing.\n\nWhen cultivated in the self, its *virtue* becomes true,\nWhen cultivated in the family, its *virtue* overflows,\nWhen cultivated in the village, its *virtue* endures,\nWhen cultivated in the state, its *virtue* flourishes,\nWhen cultivated in the world, its *virtue* becomes universal.\n\nThus, one observes the self through the self,\nThe family through the family,\nThe village through the village,\nThe state through the state,\nThe world through the world.\n\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\n*Building* refers to the origin of creation and action.\nOnly the *Dao* builds *virtue* and distinguishes,\nEstablishing Heaven and Earth—\nTheir grandeur unshaken—\nThis is when *One Qi* divides into the Two Principles.\n\n*Embracing* refers to holding fast without separation.\nOnly *virtue* embraces the *Dao* to give birth,\nNurturing all things—\nTheir continuity unbroken—\nThis is when *One Qi* disperses into myriad forms.\n\nAll things share in *One Qi*,\nYet humanity is the most refined—\nThus, it becomes the progenitor of all things,\nThe root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nIf one establishes the central *One* and embraces unity for the world,\nThen blessings descend upon future descendants,\nAnd all within the Four Seas come with their duties to offer sacrifices without ceasing.\n\nThis *Way*—\nI trace its origin,\nFor it stems from cultivating the self.\n\nOnce the *Way*’s truth is realized through self-cultivation,\nThen its remnants extend to the state,\nAnd its essence spreads to the world.\n\nFrom one body to the world,\nIts cultivation grows ever broader,\nIts *virtue* ever more profound.\n\nTo cultivate the self—\nThough the spirit dwells in the body,\nIt first conceals itself from Heaven and Earth,\nQuietly residing at the origin of all things,\nMaking the mind dwell nowhere in the body—\nThis is called cultivating the self,\nAnd thus its *virtue* becomes true.\n\nFrom this, though one is in the family,\nThe mind dwells nowhere in the family—\nThis is called cultivating the family,\nAnd thus its *virtue* overflows.\n\nThough one is in the village,\nThe mind dwells nowhere in the village—\nThis is called cultivating the village,\nAnd thus its *virtue* endures.\n\nThough one is in the state,\nThe mind dwells nowhere in the state—\nThis is called cultivating the state,\nAnd thus its *virtue* flourishes.\n\nThough one is in the world,\nThe mind dwells nowhere in the world—\nThis is called cultivating the world,\nAnd thus its *virtue* becomes universal.\n\nThus, to observe the self through the self—\nIt is an inward gaze, scrutinizing one’s own *virtue*.\n\nFor the observation of a single family, village, state,\nEven unto the world—\nThe Sage harbors no contrivance in mind,\nEach observes itself naturally,\nAnd thus it is known.\n\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Fifth: The Profound Virtue of the Embracing**\n\nThe profound virtue of the Embracing\nIs likened to the infant.\nPoisonous serpents do not sting,\nFierce beasts do not seize,\nSnatching birds do not clutch.\n\nBones are frail, sinews supple, yet the grasp is firm;\nUnknowing of male and female union, yet it rises erect—\nThis is the utmost of *qi*.\nAll day it cries, yet its throat is unstrained—\nThis is the utmost of harmony.\n\nTo know harmony is to know constancy—\nTo know constancy is to know clarity.\nTo take life as gain is an omen—\nTo move *qi* with the mind is strength.\n\nWhen things grow robust, they grow old—\nThis is called *not* the Dao.\nNot the Dao perishes early.\n\nThe infant’s nature\nIs one with the Dao,\nIts heavenly safeguard intact,\nIts spirit unbreached—\nThus the Sage does not lose the infant’s heart,\nAnd the profound virtue of the Embracing\nMay be likened to the infant.\n\nIf such is the case,\nAccumulating *virtue* in mysterious passage,\nHidden in Heaven, none can harm it—\nThus poisonous serpents do not sting,\nFierce beasts do not seize,\nSnatching birds do not clutch.\n\nBones frail, sinews supple, yet the grasp is firm—\nThis is *virtue* complete in the Earthly Way.\nThe Earth’s *qi* begins at *zi* (the hour of birth),\nThe infant’s frail bones and supple sinews yet firm grasp—\nThis is the pure *qi*’s safeguard responding to the Earthly Way.\n\nUnknowing of male and female union yet rising erect—\nThis is the utmost of *qi*—\nThis is *virtue* complete in the Constant Way.\nThe Constant Way’s *qi* is most true,\nThe infant, unknowing of male and female union, yet sometimes rising—\nThis is the Dao’s true *qi* responding in humanity.\n\nAll day it cries, yet its throat is unstrained—\nThis is the utmost of harmony—\nThis is *virtue* complete in the Heavenly Way.\nHeaven governs sound,\nIts yin-yang *qi* harmonized yet undivided—\nThus it cries all day, yet its throat is unstrained.\n\nTo know harmony—\nYin and yang blend as one—\nThus it is called constancy.\nTo know constancy—\nYin and yang merge yet remain undivided—\nThus it is called clarity.\n\nThe infant’s nature aligns with Heaven and Earth,\nIts *virtue* does not take life as gain.\nTo reverse and take life as gain—\nThis is the sign of entering the death-ground—\nThis is called an omen.\nOnce life is taken as gain,\nThen *qi* must be moved by the mind—\nThis is the way of the strong.\n\nBeginning with taking life as gain,\nEnding with things growing robust then old—\nThis is called *not* the Dao.\nNot the Dao perishes early.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Six: The Wise Do Not Speak**\n\nThe wise do not speak,\nThose who speak are not wise.\n\n「塞其兑，闭其门，\n*Plug its mouth*, seal its gate—\n挫其锐，解其纷，\n*Dull its sharpness*, disperse its tumult—\n和其光，同其尘，\n*Blend its radiance*, align with common dust—\n是谓玄同。\nThis is called *Mysterious Unity*.\n\n故不可得而亲，不可得而疏，\nThus it cannot be grasped as near nor distant—\n不可得而利，不可得而害，\nCannot be seized for gain nor avoided for harm—\n不可得而贵，不可得而贱，\nCannot be prized as noble nor debased as low—\n故为天下贵。\nThus it is most honored by all under Heaven.\n\n道要自然，\nThe *Dao/Way* requires *spontaneity* (zìrán)—\n行者能得，\nThose who practice can attain it—\n闻者能言，\nThose who hear can speak of it—\n所以言者，以言相然。\nYet why do they speak? *Because speech can clarify* (yán) one another.\n\n相然者，意之默识而已，\n*Clarification through speech*—\nThis is but the silent understanding of the mind—\n未尝见於譊譊之言辨也，\nIt does not manifest in *prolix* (yōuyōu) verbal disputation—\n故曰知者不言。\nThus it is said: *The wise do not speak*.\n\n不知道者，以言相烦，\nThose who do not know the *Dao*—\nThey vex one another with speech—\n不闻不言，不知所由然，\nThey neither hear nor speak,\nUnknowing how it comes to be—\n故曰言者不知。\nThus it is said: *Those who speak are not wise*.\n\n唯圣人知天地之道，\nOnly the *Sage* knows the *Dao/Way* of Heaven and Earth—\n有大美而不言，\nPossessing great *virtue/power* (dàměi) yet not speaking—\n故塞其兑，闭其门，\nThus *plugging its mouth*, sealing its gate—\n涂邻守神而退藏於密。\n*Dwelling in obscurity* (túlín) and *preserving the spirit* (shǒushén), *retiring into concealment* (tuìcáng yú mì).\n\n及其出而为天下，\nWhen it emerges to benefit all under Heaven—\n於此体天之道，则挫其锐而和其光也，\nHere it embodies the *Dao/Way* of Heaven:\n*Dull its sharpness* and *blend its radiance*—\n於此体地之道，则解其纷而同其尘也。\nHere it embodies the *Dao/Way* of Earth:\n*Disperse its tumult* and *align with common dust*.\n\n天地之道是谓玄同，\nThe *Dao/Way* of Heaven and Earth is called *Mysterious Unity*—\n玄有赤有黑，\n*Mysterious* (xuán) holds both *red* (chì) and *black* (hēi)—\n故玄同则合乎至一，\nThus *Mysterious Unity* converges with *Ultimate Oneness* (zhìyī)—\n而与天地相参。\nAnd harmonizes with the principles of Heaven and Earth.\n\n天道无亲，\nThe *Dao/Way* of Heaven has no favorites—\n故不可得而亲，\nThus it cannot be grasped as near—\n既不可得而亲，亦不可得而疏也。\nSince it cannot be grasped as near,\nIt also cannot be grasped as distant.\n\n地道无欲，\nThe *Dao/Way* of Earth has no cravings—\n故不可得而利，\nThus it cannot be seized for gain—\n既不可得而利，亦不可得而害也。\nSince it cannot be seized for gain,\nIt also cannot be avoided for harm.\n\n大道无形，\nThe *Great Dao/Way* is formless—\n故不可得而贵，\nThus it cannot be prized as noble—\n既不可得而贵，亦不可得而贱也。\nSince it cannot be prized as noble,\nIt also cannot be debased as low—\n若是者，宜为天下贵。\nIf such is the case,\nIt should be most honored by all under Heaven.\n\n以正治国章第五十七\n**Chapter Fifty-Seven: Governing with Rectitude**\n\n以正治国，以奇用兵，\n*Governing with rectitude* (zhèng),\n*Employing the strange* (qí) in warfare—\n以无事取天下。\n*Conquering through non-action* (wúshì) to attain all under Heaven.\n\n吾何以知其然哉？\n*How do I know this is so?*\n\n夫天下多忌讳，\n*For when all under Heaven abounds in taboos*—\n而民弥贫；\nThe people grow ever poorer—\n人多利器，\nMen abound in *sharp implements* (lìqì)—\n国家滋昏；\nThe state grows increasingly corrupt—\n人多技巧，\nMen abound in *crafty skills* (jìqiǎo)—\n奇物滋起；\nAnd strange artifacts proliferate—\n法令滋彰，\nLaws and decrees become ever more explicit—\n盗贼多有。\nThieves and robbers abound.\n\n故圣人云：\nThus the *Sage* says:\n我无为而民自化，\n*I act with non-doing* (wúwéi), yet the people transform themselves—\n我无事而民自富，\n*I take no action* (wúshì), yet the people grow wealthy—\n我好静而民自正，\n*I love tranquility* (hàojìng), yet the people become upright—\n我无欲而民自朴。\n*I have no cravings* (wúyù), yet the people return to simplicity.\n\n闻在宥天下，不闻治天下，\n*It is heard in pardoning all under Heaven*—\nNot heard in governing all under Heaven—\n天下不可治也，\n*For all under Heaven cannot be governed*—\n故以正治国者，必以奇用兵。\nThus those who govern with rectitude must employ the strange in warfare.\n\n盖正复为奇，\n*For rectitude becomes the strange*—\n则有用兵之患，\nThen the calamity of warfare arises—\n以福兮祸所伏也，\n*For blessing is the seed of calamity*—\n孰知其极？\nWho knows its limits?\n\n是以圣人以无事取天下。\nThus the *Sage* conquers all under Heaven through non-action.\n\n无事则法地而好静，\n*Non-action* follows the *Dao/Way* of Earth and loves tranquility—\n好静则法天而无为，\nLoving tranquility follows the *Dao/Way* of Heaven and acts with non-doing—\n无为则法道而无欲，\nActing with non-doing follows the *Great Dao/Way* and has no cravings—\n无欲则天下自然归之。\nHaving no cravings, all under Heaven naturally returns to it.\n\n吾何以知其然哉？\n*How do I know this is so?*\n\n夫治出於有为，\n*For governance arises from doing*—\n而失太上不言之教，\nYet losing the *Supreme* (tàishàng) *non-speech* (bùyán) teaching—\n故多忌讳之禁，\nThus there are many taboo prohibitions—\n则四民迁业而弥贫。\nThen the four classes shift their occupations and grow ever poorer.\n\n民贫则征求利器，\nThe people become poor and seek *sharp implements*—\n贪污之风生，\nThe winds of greed and corruption arise—\n故国家滋昏。\nThus the state grows increasingly corrupt.\n\n玩好伎巧，难得之货贵，\n*Delighting in luxuries and crafty skills*—\nRare treasures grow costly—\n故奇物滋起。\nThus strange artifacts proliferate.\n\n由此利害相攻，\nFrom this, gain and harm contend—\n法令滋彰，\nLaws and decrees become ever more explicit—\n克核太至，\nExcessive severity reaches its extreme—\n民不聊生，\nThe people barely survive—\n故盗贼多有。\nThus thieves and robbers abound.\n\n奇兵之用缘此而起，\nThe use of *strange forces* (qíbīng) stems from this—\n此乃以正治国，正之极也。\nThis is indeed governing with rectitude, the extreme of rectitude.\n\n是以圣人无事，\nThus the *Sage* acts with non-action—\n则国实民富，\nThen the state is strong and the people wealthy—\n故忌讳不生，\nThus taboos do not arise—\n好静则天下自正，\nLoving tranquility, all under Heaven becomes upright—\n故利器不作。\nThus *sharp implements* are not sought.\n\n无为则万民自化，\n*Non-doing* (wúwéi) lets all the people transform themselves—\n伎巧何施？\n*What use are crafty skills?*\n无欲则民自归朴，\nHaving no cravings, the people return to simplicity—\n盗贼何有？\n*What thieves and robbers are there?*\n此乃以无事取天下也。\nThis is indeed conquering all under Heaven through non-action.\n\n其政闷闷章第五十八\n**Chapter Fifty-Eight: The Sage’s Governance is Obscure**\n\n其政闷闷，\nIts governance is *obscure yet profound* (mènmèn)—\n其民淳淳；\nIts people are *simple and sincere* (chúnchún)—\n其政察察，\nIts governance is *explicit and scrutinizing* (cháchá)—\n其民缺缺。\nIts people are *cunning and deceitful* (quēquē).\n\n祸兮福所倚，\n*Calamity*—\n*For calamity is the leaning of blessing*—\n福兮祸所伏。\n*Blessing*—\n*For blessing is the seed of calamity*—\n孰知其极？\nWho knows its limits?\n其无正邪？\n*Is there no rectitude or deviation?*\n正复为奇，\nRectitude becomes the strange—\n善复为祆。\nBlessing becomes *ill-omened* (jiāo).\n\n民之迷，其日固久。\nThe people’s confusion has lasted long indeed.\n\n是以圣人方而不割，\nThus the *Sage* is *square* (fāng) yet does not *sever* (gē)—\n廉而不刿，\n*Modest* (lián) yet does not *pierce* (jià)—\n直而不肆，\n*Upright* (zhí) yet does not *exaggerate* (shì)—\n光而不耀。\n*Radiant* (guāng) yet does not *blaze* (yào).\n\n太上之世，\nIn the *Supreme Age* (tàishàng)—\n处无为之事，\n*Dwelling in non-doing*—\n行不言之教，\n*Practicing non-speech* teaching—\n天下知有上而不知有政，\nAll under Heaven knows there is a *Supreme* (shàng) yet does not know there is governance—\n故为政无处正，\nThus in governance, there is no need to establish rectitude—\n自居之闷闷者，\n*For the naturally profound* (zìjū zhī mènmèn)—\n有政而不作也。\nThere is governance yet no action taken.\n\n有政不作则非以明民，\nGovernance without action is not to enlighten the people—\n将以愚之，\nBut to delude them—\n故其民亦淳淳而若朴焉。\nThus its people are also *simple and sincere* yet appear as if in simplicity.\n\n然既立政为正，\nYet if governance is established as rectitude—\n必有以察为奇，\nThere must be *scrutiny as the strange*—\n故始於闷闷而终於察察。\nThus it begins with *obscure yet profound* governance and ends with *explicit and scrutinizing* governance.\n\n终於察察，政之极也。\nEnding with *explicit and scrutinizing* governance is the extreme of governance.\n\n其政太察，\nIf governance is too scrutinizing—\n使民无所措手足，\nThe people have no place to set their hands and feet—\n故其民缺缺焉。\nThus its people become *cunning and deceitful*.\n\n圣人言但知求福，\nThe *Sage* says: *Only knowing to seek blessing*—\n不知罪婴，\n*Unknowing of the guilt of calamity*—\n但知养身，\n*Only knowing to nourish life*—\n不知戮形，\n*Unknowing of the punishment of form*—\n祸福倚伏，\nCalamity and blessing lean and hide—\n理之然也，\nThis is the natural order—\n故曰孰知其极，其无正邪？\nThus it is said: *Who knows its limits? Is there no rectitude or deviation?*\n\n世之人以政为正，\nThe people of the world take governance as rectitude—\n不知正之极而奇生，\n*Unknowing that rectitude’s extreme gives rise to the strange*—\n以福为善，\nTaking blessing as good—\n不知善之复而妖起，\n*Unknowing that good’s reversal spawns the strange*—\n迷迷相传，\nConfusion is passed on in confusion—\n于今久矣。\nFor ages now.\n\n是以圣人方如广德之厚，\nThus the *Sage* is *square* (fāng) like the *great virtue/power* (guǎngdé) of *thickness*—\n故不割也；\nThus does not *sever*—\n廉如上德之清，\n*Modest* (lián) like the *Supreme virtue/power* (shàngdé) of *clarity*—\n故不刿也。\nThus does not *pierce*.\n\n直而不申於外，\n*Upright* (zhí) yet not *exaggerated* (shēn) outward—\n光而返照於内，\n*Radiant* (guāng) yet reflecting inward—\n无正可处，\nNo rectitude can be fixed—\n无奇可察，\nNo *strange* (qí) can be scrutinized—\n是谓无极之道。\nThis is called the *Dao/Way of No Extremes*.\n\n治人事天章第五十九\n**Chapter Fifty-Nine: Governing People and Serving Heaven**\n\n治人事天莫若啬，\n*Nothing surpasses frugality* (sè) in governing people and serving Heaven—\n夫唯啬，\n*For only frugality*—\n是谓早复。\nIs called *early return*.\n\n早复谓之重积德，\n*Early return* is called *repeatedly accumulating virtue/power* (chóngjīdé)—\n重积德则无不克，\nRepeatedly accumulating virtue/power means nothing is unconquered—\n无不克则莫知其极。\nNothing unconquered means no one knows its limits.\n\n莫知其极，\nNo one knows its limits—\n可以有国。\nThus one can have a state.\n\n有国之母，\n*The foundation of having a state*—\n可以长久，\nCan endure long—\n是谓深根固蒂，\nThis is called the *Dao/Way of deep roots and firm stems* (shēngén gùdì)—\n长生久视之道。\nThe *Dao/Way* of longevity and lasting vision.\n\n---\n\n**Frugality (Sè) as Gathering and Nurturing—Returning to Virtue/Power (Dé)**\n\nFrugality (sè) is *gathering* (liǎn) and *nurturing* (xù).\nTo speak externally, it is *gathering*;\nTo speak internally, it is *nurturing*.\nWhen gathering externally, one reaches *no desire* (wùyù),\nThus one retreats from the body, abandons the body—\nThis is how one governs people.\n\nWhen nurturing internally, one reaches *no knowing* (wùzhī),\nThus one preserves the heart, nourishes the nature—\nThis is how one serves Heaven.\n\nExternally, with no desire, one follows the Earth’s stillness\nAnd thus fulfills one’s nature.\nInternally, with no knowing, one embodies Heaven’s function\nAnd attains *return to the primal command* (fùmìng).\n\nTo fulfill one’s nature and attain *return to the primal command*\nIs to *retain one’s primal source* (fǔmǔ),\nThus it is called *early return* (zǎofù).\n\n*Early* refers to the sun’s ascent at the beginning of Jia-Yang.\nTo retain one’s primal source\nIs to harmonize with Heaven and Earth in virtue/power (dé),\nThis is called *repeatedly accumulating virtue/power* (chóngjīdé).\n\nAccumulating virtue/power in profound unity,\nMerging with the Dao in its truth,\nThus nothing is unconquered.\n\nMerging with the Dao in its truth—\nDifficult to exhaust, difficult to fathom,\nThus no one knows its limits.\n\nDifficult to exhaust, yet when weak, all principles are complete—\nThus one can have a state.\n\n*The foundation of having a state* (yǒuguó zhī mǔ)\nIs this: neither square nor round,\nParallel with Heaven and Earth—\nThus it can endure long.\n\nThus to retain the source (mǔ)\nIs to *deeply root* (shēn gēn),\nTo *firmly stem* (gùdì) in *return to the primal command* (fùmìng).\nTo obtain Heaven and Earth as constants\nAnd the Five Phases not clashing,\nTo merge with the Great Dao as one\nAnd the Three Lights without obscurity—\nThis is called the *Dao/Way of longevity and lasting vision* (chángshēng jiǔshì zhī dào).\n\n---\n**Chapter Sixty: Governing Great States**\n\nTo govern a great state, treat it like cooking a small fish.\nTo rule the world with the Dao,\nIts spirits are not numinous.\n\nNot that its spirits are not numinous—\nBut its numinous does not harm the people;\nNot that its numinous does not harm the people—\nThe Sage also does not harm the people.\n\nWhen both do not harm each other,\nVirtue/power (dé) returns and exchanges.\n\nThe Dao of governance values stillness and quietude—\nThe people then regulate themselves.\nDo not act artificially—\nThus, to govern a great state is like cooking a small fish.\n\nSpeaking of people,\nA great state is the central realm of Yellow Emperor’s land—\nAnd this is how it is governed.\n\nThus the Sage dwells in *non-action* (wúwéi),\nWith a single mind steadfast—\nAnd rules the world.\nHence, spirits have no place to manifest their numinous resonance,\nDepending on humans to act—\nWhat numinous power could there be?\n\nNot that its spirits are not numinous—\nFor it does not receive evil,\nAnd evil qi departs on its own—\nThus the numinous does not harm people.\n\nNot that its numinous does not harm people—\nFor the Sage dwells in *non-action*,\nAnd the world transforms naturally.\nThus, externally, there are no calamities of contention, robbery, or war;\nInternally, there are no schemes of murder or grudges.\nNot transgressing the spirits’ retribution—\nThus the Sage also does not harm people.\n\nWhen humans and spirits both do not harm each other,\nThe spirits bestow blessings—\nGranting you abundant fortune and returning virtue/power to the spirits.\nThe people are sincere—\nDaily nourished with food and drink,\nAnd virtue/power returns to humans.\n\nVirtue/power returns to the spirits,\nThus descendants continue sacrifices without ceasing.\nVirtue/power returns to humans,\nThus the world joyfully promotes it without tiring.\n\nThis is the effect of the Sage ruling the world with the Dao.\n\n---\n**Chapter Sixty-One: Great States as the Lowly Flow**\n\nA great state is the lowly flow,\nThe convergence of the world,\nThe world’s *yin*—\nFor *yin* always overcomes *yang* through stillness,\nAnd stillness is *lowly*.\n\nThus, when a great state is lowly to a small state, it takes the small state;\nWhen a small state is lowly to a great state, it takes the great state.\nThus, sometimes lowly to take,\nSometimes lowly and taken.\n\nA great state seeks only to *nurture all* (jiānrú rén);\nA small state seeks only to *enter and serve* (rùshì rén).\nBoth obtain what they desire—\nThus the great should properly be lowly.\n\nWater excels in being lowly—\nThus rivers and seas become kings of all valleys.\nA great state desires to *nurture all*—\nAlso through its lowly flow alone.\nThus it is said: *A great state is the lowly flow.*\n\nThe world converges, all things are born;\nHuman paths converge, achievements are completed—\nThis is called the world’s convergence.\nYet it must first dwell in gentleness and stillness—\nFor *yin* always overcomes *yang* through stillness,\nAnd *yang* submits to it—\nThus stillness is lowly.\n\nStillness means no affairs—\nOnly through no affairs can one take the world,\nMuch less a state.\nThus, when a great state is lowly to a small state, it takes the small state;\nWhen a small state is lowly to a great state, it takes the great state.\n\nSometimes lowly to take—this is the *Way of the Sovereign*.\nSometimes lowly and taken—this is the *Way of the Minister*.\n\nThe Sovereign is like Heaven—\nHeaven’s *Way* is lowly yet nourishing, bright and clear,\nThus a great state seeks only to *nurture all*.\nThe Minister is like Earth—\nEarth’s *Way* is lowly yet ascending,\nThus a small state seeks only to *enter and serve*.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth converge, all things are born;\nWhen human paths converge, achievements are completed—\nBoth obtain what they desire.\nYet only the great should properly be lowly—\nThus it is again said: *The great should be lowly.*\n\n---\n**Chapter Sixty-Two: The Dao as the Mystery of All Things**\n\nThe Dao is the mystery of all things,\nThe treasure of the virtuous,\nThe refuge of the unvirtuous.\nFine words can be sold,\nNoble conduct can elevate one.\n\nIf people are unvirtuous, what can be discarded?\nThus, when establishing a Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Ministers,\nEven with a jade tablet and four horses offered first,\nIt is not as good as sitting and presenting this Dao.\n\nWhy did the ancients value this Dao so?\nWas it not to *seek and obtain*?\nOr to *have guilt and fear*?\nThus it is valued for the world.\n\nThe Dao is the abyss of emptiness—\nPeople see things but do not see the Dao,\nThus the Dao is the mystery of all things.\n\nTo grasp the Dao’s subtlety is to be virtuous—\nThis is called the treasure of *nature and life* (xìngmìng).\nTo speak of the Dao falsely is unvirtuous—\nYet one still finds refuge in it.\n\n*Market* refers to where the multitude gathers.\n*Add* refers to placing oneself above the multitude.\nFine words and noble conduct—\nEven the unvirtuous can gather the multitude and rise above them—\nWhat could be discarded?\n\nThus, when establishing a Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Ministers,\nIt is to sit and discuss the Dao.\n\n「Though one may possess a jade-like treasure to precede a team of four horses, the result is still the same: fine words and noble conduct gather the multitude and elevate one above them.\n\nYet even so, it is still not as good as sitting and advancing the Dao of *Non-Action* (wúwéi), attaining its subtlety, and thus achieving greater healing.\n\nWhy did the ancients hold this Dao in such esteem?\nWas it not because the treasure of *nature and life* (xìngmìng) can be sought and obtained,\nwhile the refuge of what is born is merely to escape guilt and fear?\n\nThus, this Dao is valued for the world.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Three: On *Non-Action* (wúwéi) and *Non-Affairs* (wúshì)**\n\nTo practice *Non-Action* (wúwéi),\nto engage in *Non-Affairs* (wúshì),\nto find contentment in *Non-Taste* (wúwèi).\n\nGreat and small, much and little—\nrewarding resentment with *virtue* (dé).\nAttempting the difficult through the easy,\nachieving the great through the minute.\n\nThe world’s difficult tasks must begin in ease,\nthe world’s great affairs must arise from small beginnings.\nThus, the Sage never strives to be great,\nand so can accomplish the truly great.\n\nLight promises bring few trustworthy words,\nmany changes bring many difficulties.\nTherefore, the Sage treats difficulty as difficulty,\nand so never faces true difficulty.\n\nThe Sage embodies the *Dao of Heaven* (tiāndào) in practicing *Non-Spoken Teaching* (bùyánzhījiào),\nthus attaining *Non-Action* (wúwéi);\nembodies the *Constant Dao* (chángdào) in handling *Non-Affairs* (wúwéishì),\nthus achieving *Non-Affairs* (wúshì);\nembodies the *Dao of Earth* (dìdào) in delighting in the *power of tranquility* (tiándànzhīnéng),\nthus finding contentment in *Non-Taste* (wúwèi).\n\nFrom the perspective of what is appropriate,\nit seems there is *Action* (yǒuwéi), *Affairs* (yǒushì), and *Taste* (yǒuwèi).\nFrom the perspective of what is upheld,\nthen *Non-Action* (wúwéi) is *Action* (yǒuwéi),\n*Non-Affairs* (wúshì) is *Affairs* (yǒushì),\nand *Non-Taste* (wúwèi) is merely *Taste* (yǒuwèi).\n\nThe people of the world do not understand this,\nso they act boldly and incur resentment,\npursue the small and reach the great,\naccumulate the few and attain the many—\nall driven by their fixation on deeds and desires.\n\nYet greatness and smallness, abundance and scarcity,\nfollow their kind and are repaid,\nall arising from their own gains—\nHeaven and Earth respond like echoes.\nThus it is said: *Reward resentment with virtue* (dé).\n\nFrom this perspective,\nthe world’s difficult tasks arise from ease and become difficult,\nthe world’s great affairs arise from small beginnings and become great—\nthus, calamities emerge from the unheeded,\ndisasters from the minutely overlooked.\nIs this not what is meant?\n\nTherefore, the Sage aligns with Heaven as Heaven,\nso he never strives to be great;\nunites with the Dao as one,\nso he can accomplish the truly great.\n\nAs for those who make light promises and pursue many changes,\nthey harm themselves by acting lightly in *Action* (yǒuwéi),\nthus they lack trustworthiness and face many difficulties.\n\nThe Sage practices *Non-Spoken Teaching* (bùyánzhījiào),\nso he has no need for trustworthy words;\nhandles *Non-Affairs* (wúwéishì) and delights in the *power of tranquility* (tiándànzhīnéng),\nso he avoids the blame of many difficulties;\nleaves things to their natural course without daring to act,\nso he never faces true difficulty.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Four: On the Ease of Holding What Is Tranquil**\n\nIts tranquility is easy to hold,\nits unmanifested state is easy to plan,\nits fragility is easy to float away,\nits subtlety is easy to disperse.\n\nPrevent failure before it arises,\nprevent disorder before it begins.\n\nA tree thick enough to embrace grows from a tiny sprout;\na nine-tiered tower rises from a pile of earth;\na journey of a thousand *li* begins beneath one’s feet.\n\nThe doer brings failure,\nthe grasper brings loss.\nThus, the Sage practices *Non-Action* (wúwéi) and so knows no failure,\nholds nothing and so knows no loss.\n\nThe people’s undertakings often fail just as completion nears,\nbut if they guard the end as they did the beginning,\nthen there will be no failed affairs.\n\nThus, the Sage desires what others do not desire,\nvalues not the treasures that are hard to obtain;\nlearns what others do not learn,\nrestores the errors of the multitude,\nassists the natural course of all things,\nand dares not act.\n\nTranquility remains unspoiled before its emergence,\neasy to plan and hold—\nthis is called *preventing failure before it arises*.\n\nFragility and subtlety have already taken form,\neasy to disperse and dissolve—\nthis is called *preventing disorder before it begins*.\n\nYet, to prevent failure before it arises,\ncan one truly avoid all thought and deliberation?\nTo prevent disorder before it begins,\ncan one truly avoid all wisdom and strategy?\n\nThus, the Sage says:\nDeliberation and thought are the origins of peril,\nand peril will not last long.\nBetter to be cautious at the outset of affairs,\nforgetting the need to act,\nand cautious at the beginning of undertakings,\nforgetting the need to govern—\nthis is the greater remedy.\n\nFor greatness arises from smallness,\nheight from lowliness,\ndistance from proximity—\nthis is the natural order.\n\nThe doer brings failure,\nthe grasper brings loss.\nOnly the Sage sees the beginning and contemplates the end,\ndiscerns the intention and knows the conclusion—\nthus he practices *Non-Action* (wúwéi),\nand so knows no failure;\nholds nothing,\nand so knows no loss.\n\nAs for the people’s undertakings,\nthey cannot escape *Action* (yǒuwéi) and governance,\nyet they do not know to be cautious.\nTheir desires grow ever longer,\nand when the true harmony is exhausted,\nthey fail just as completion nears—\nhow could this not be so?\n\nIf one guards the end as the beginning,\nand returns to the *Dao of the Infant Guarded by Its Mother* (yīng’érshǒumǔ),\nthen there will be no failed affairs.\n\nThus, the Sage desires what others do not desire,\nexternally does nothing—\neven treasures that are hard to obtain are not valued;\nlearns what others do not learn,\ninternally does nothing—\neven fine words and noble conduct are not esteemed,\nrestoring the errors of the multitude’s governance,\nassisting the natural course of all things,\nand daring not to act.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Five: On the Ancients’ Skill in Advancing the Dao**\n\nThe ancients who skillfully advanced the Dao\ndid not seek to enlighten the people,\nbut rather to rely upon them.\n\nThe people are difficult to govern\nbecause their wisdom is excessive.\nThus, governing with wisdom is the ruin of the state;\nnot governing with wisdom is the state’s blessing.\n\nKnowing these two principles is the *model of conduct* (kǎishì).\nAlways knowing the *model of conduct* (kǎishì)\nis called *Mysterious Virtue* (xuándé).\n\n*Mysterious Virtue* (xuándé) is profound and distant,\ncontrary to things and yet only then does it reach great harmony.\n\nThe Dao of *Non-Action* (wúwéi) brings self-possession within,\nthe Dao of *Non-Non-Action* (wúbùwéi) brings transformation without—\nthus, the ancients who skillfully advanced the Dao\ndid not seek to enlighten the people,\nbut rather to *quell* (yù) them.\n\nEnlightenment makes the pure and the turbid mix, bringing chaos,\n*quelling* (yù) preserves simplicity and stillness.\nMoreover, the people can be led but cannot be made to know.\n\nThe people are difficult to govern\nbecause their wisdom is excessive and they have knowledge.\n\nWisdom is a tool for contention,\nso governing with wisdom is the ruin of the state—\nis this not because it makes them enlightened?\nNot governing with wisdom is the state’s blessing—\nis this not because it *quells* (yù) them?\n\nThe ruin of the state comes from opening the way to human designs—\nthus, resentment is born.\nThe blessing of the state comes from opening the way to Heaven—\nthus, *virtue* (dé) is born.\n\n「This pair of principles is also the standard and model that can be emulated and followed. To know the standard and model, one can then observe the Way of Heaven, hence it is called *Mysterious Virtue* (Xuán Dé). *Mysterious Virtue* is the highest virtue, hence it is profound and vast. Nothing can find its equal in things, but only align with the great order. Thus, it opposes all things, and only then does it reach the great order.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Six: The King of All Valleys (Jiānghǎi)**\nThe reason the rivers and seas can become the king of all valleys is that they excel in yielding. Therefore, they can be the king of all valleys. Hence, the sage who desires to be above others does so by speaking from below, and who desires to lead others does so by placing himself behind them. Thus, the sage, though in the highest position, is not burdensome to the people; though in the lead, he does not harm them. Therefore, the world rejoices in pushing them forward without tiring.\n\nBecause he does not contend, none under Heaven can contend with him.\nThe rivers and seas, by their excellence in yielding, gather the flow of all valleys and become their king. The term *king* (wáng) carries the meaning of returning and going, hence one who holds high rank but yields to the lowly, and greatness but serves the vast, gains the people’s loyalty. Therefore, the sage embodies the Way of Heaven by speaking from below, and though in the highest position, the people do not burden him—thus, those who follow him find it effortless. He embodies the Way of Earth by placing himself behind, and though in the lead, he does not harm the people—thus, those who benefit from him are many. If this is so, then from the west and east, from the south and north, none will fail to submit without thought. Therefore, the world rejoices in pushing them forward without tiring.\n\nIn essence, it is nothing more than excellence in yielding.\nOnly those who excel in yielding do not contend with things, hence none under Heaven can contend with them.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Seven: The World’s Saying**\nThe world says of my Dao: *\"It seems like the unworthy, yet how great it is!\"*\nOnly because it is great does it seem like the unworthy.\nIf it seemed like the worthy for long, it would be trifling.\nI have three treasures, treasures that I hold fast.\nThe first is *compassion* (cí), the second is *frugality* (jiǎn), the third is *not daring to be first under Heaven* (bù gǎn wéi tiānxià xiān).\n\n*Compassion* makes one courageous;\n*frugality* makes one broad;\n*Not daring to be first under Heaven* makes one a vessel of enduring greatness.\nNow, if one abandons *compassion* yet seeks courage,\nabandons *frugality* yet seeks breadth,\nabandons *placing oneself behind* yet seeks to be first—\nthen one dies.\n\n*Compassion*, when waging war, ensures victory;\nwhen defending, ensures steadfastness.\nHeaven, intending to save, uses *compassion* to shield them.\nThe worthy seem small, while the unworthy seem great.\nThe Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth, filling the six extremes, vast beyond measure—\nthus, it seems like the unworthy.\nHeaven is great, Earth is great, and they merely emulate the Dao—\nthus, they can endure.\n\nYet Heaven and Earth are but a minute thing within the void—\ntheir relation to the Dao is also minute.\n\nTherefore, I hold fast to my three treasures.\nThe first is *compassion*—the Way of the Father, the origin of creation, speaking of Heaven.\nThe second is *frugality*—the Way of the Mother, the guardian of accumulation, speaking of Earth.\nThe third is *not daring to be first under Heaven*—the origin of Heaven and Earth, responding only after being moved, never acting before things, speaking of the Dao.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth combine and employ the Dao,\nit is serene and boundless, and all beauties arise from it.\nNo treasures surpass these three.\n\nAll people possess these;\none should treasure them and not lose them,\nholding them as the highest.\n\nThe Way of Heaven gives life and covers it—\nthis is called *compassion*.\nThough compassionate, it does not contend yet triumphs—\nthis is why *compassion* makes one courageous.\n\nThe Way of Earth nurtures and accumulates—\nthis is called *frugality*.\nThough frugal, its virtue aligns with the boundless—\nthis is why *frugality* makes one broad.\n\nOnly the great Dao encompasses the origins of Heaven and Earth;\nthough one does not dare to be first under Heaven,\nlife and transformation depend on it to stand—\nthis is why one can become a vessel of enduring greatness.\nIf one opposes Heaven and Earth and abandons the great Dao,\nthen one dies.\n\n*Compassion* ensures victory in war\nbecause it battles the yielding with the assertive.\nIt ensures steadfastness in defense\nby embracing the *Mysterious Way*.\nMoreover, when one battles disorder with order,\nwaiting for the time to move—\nthen he is supported and wins.\nIf one cannot move, he defends with order,\nand Heaven’s timing also shields and steadies him—\nthus, Heaven intends to save, using *compassion* to guard them.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Eight: The Art of the Gentle Scholar**\nThe gentle scholar excels not in force,\nthe skilled warrior does not rage,\nthe victor over foes does not contend,\nthe master of men places himself beneath them.\n\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nthis is called the power of employing men,\nthis is called harmonizing with Heaven—\nthe ancient ultimate.\n\nThe gentle scholar cherishes the Way of the three treasures,\nnot using arms to coerce the world but employing force.\nTo wage war against others is to be skilled in war,\nto overcome foes is to be skilled in victory,\nto employ men is to be skilled in governance.\n\nThe skilled warrior waits for the time before moving;\nthough he wages war, he does not rage—\nembodying the treasure of *compassion*.\n\nThe skilled victor considers victory before meeting;\nthough he prevails, he does not contend—\nembodying the treasure of *frugality*.\n\nThe master of men does not scheme for himself,\nbut delights in employing others—\nthus, men gladly serve him,\nembodying the treasure of *not daring to be first under Heaven*.\n\nIf one excels in these,\nthen it is called the virtue of non-contention,\nthe power of employing men,\nand harmonizing with Heaven.\n\nYet the ancient *orthodox* (zhèng) became *unconventional* (qí),\nthus arose the warning of using arms—\nhence it is said: the ancient ultimate.\n\nWho knows its ultimate?\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Nine: The Sayings of Using Arms**\nThe sayings of using arms are:\n*\"I do not dare to be the host but become the guest,\nnor dare to advance an inch while retreating a foot.\"*\n\nThis is called *having no path but to follow* (xíng wú xíng),\n*repelling without arms* (rǎng wú bì),\n*returning without foes* (réng wú dí),\n*grasping without weapons* (zhí wú bīng).\n\nNo calamity is greater than underestimating the enemy,\nfor underestimating the enemy nearly forfeits my treasures.\nThus, when armies clash in confrontation,\nthe compassionate prevail.\n\nThe sayings of using arms are not my own;\nthey are the common words of those who wage war.\n*\"I do not dare to be the host but become the guest,\"*\nthen I am pressed before moving,\narising only when unavoidable—\nnever provoking others,\nmerely responding to them.*\n\n**\"The Sayings of Using Arms (Continued) — Chapter 69**\n\nWhen one cannot avoid it, then it is not the case of *leaping forward to wage war* (yǒng yuè yòng bīng) but of taking delight in killing as one’s purpose—\nthus, one does not dare to advance an inch while retreating a foot,\nand so it is called *having no path but to follow* (xíng wú xíng).\n*Repelling without arms* (rǎng wú bì) means to wage war skillfully yet without anger.\n*Returning without foes* (réng wú dí) means to vanquish the enemy well yet without contention.\n*Grasping without weapons* (zhí wú bīng) means to employ others skillfully yet place oneself beneath them.\nThis is the profound understanding of the **Three Treasures’ Dao** (sān bǎo zhī dào).\n\nYet the **Three Treasures** (sān bǎo) are not solely for discussing war—\nhow is it that the ancient extreme (jí) has come to this point of using arms?\nArms are cruel instruments; one must not underestimate the enemy,\nfor underestimating the enemy is to delight in killing.\nAbandoning one’s **virtue of compassion** (cí) and **courage** (yǒng),\nand taking up **frugality** (jiǎn) yet **broad ambition** (guǎng),\nor **following others** (hòu) yet **placing oneself first** (xiān),\nthus nearly forfeiting my treasures.\nTherefore, when armies clash in confrontation,\nthose who are **compassionate and merciful** (āi lián) are virtuous (cí).\nIf one takes **virtue** (cí) as one’s treasure,\nthen there will be no calamity of underestimating the enemy,\nand so one will prevail.\n\n**The Sayings of Using Arms Are Very Easy to Know — Chapter 70**\nMy sayings are very easy to know,\nvery easy to practice—\nyet none under heaven can know them,\nnone can practice them.\nWords have a **root** (zōng),\naffairs have a **master** (jūn).\nOnly because of **lack of knowing** (wú zhī),\nthey do not know me.\nFew know me,\nso those who follow me are noble.\nThus the sage wears coarse robes yet holds precious jade (bèi huái).\nWith **no thought and no concern** (wú sī wú lǜ), one begins to know the Dao—\nthis is why it is easy to know.\nWith **no following and no teaching** (wú cóng wú dào), one begins to attain the Dao—\nthis is why it is easy to practice.\nYet the wealthy and noble of the world squander their desires and lose their true nature (zāng yù yǐ sàng zhēn),\nwhile the poor and lowly labor excessively and harm their lives (láo yì yǐ shāng shēng),\nall losing themselves to things,\nand their nature to customs—\nthus none can know, none can practice.\n\nWords have a root—\nto clarify the meaning of a chapter,\nand establish its **principle** (tǒng) as its root—\nis this not what is called easy to know?\nAffairs have a master—\nto clarify the practice of a chapter,\nand establish its **authority** (zhǔ) as its master—\nis this not what is called easy to practice?\nIf one does not lose its root and master,\nhow could one not know or not practice?\nThus the sage says:\nIf you follow my Dao,\nyou should know the **Supreme Enlightenment’s Source** (shàng huì yuán),\nfor wisdom (zhì) is not born alone—\nall must respond to their causes (yīn).\nIf you lack the **practice of the Host’s Original Nature** (wú xíng sù běn),\nthis is called lack of knowing—\nhow could you clarify the **Mysterious and Profound Dao of the Supreme One** (tài shàng xuán miào zhī lǐ)?\nThis is why they do not know me.\nThere are those who know without words,\nwho see what others do not—\nand those who attain without learning,\nwho perceive what others do not—\nthus those who know the Dao are few,\nproving that those who truly see are noble.\nHence the sage appears **thin in externals yet rich in internals** (bó yú wài ér hòu yú nèi),\ndoes not flaunt himself before others,\nand holds the **jewel of Kunshan Mountain** (kuī shān zhī yù) yet remains unknown.\n\n**The Sayings of Knowing and Not Knowing — Chapter 70**\nTo know what one does not know—\nthis is **exalted** (shàng).\nTo not know what one knows—\nthis is **illness** (bìng).\nOnly because one **diseases the illness** (bìng bìng),\none does not fall ill.\nThe sage’s non-illness comes from his disease of the illness—\nthus he does not fall ill.\nThe Dao is originally **without knowing** (wú zhī),\nyet through **no thought and no concern** (wú sī wú lǜ), one knows it—\nthus it is called *knowing what one does not know*—\nthis is called **true knowing** (zhēn zhī).\nTo not know the Dao of *not knowing what one does not know*,\nyet to **clearly** (zhāo) **discuss profound and subtle theories** (gāo tán miào lùn)\nto **exhaust the principles and penetrate the roots** (jīu běn qióng yuán),\nthis is called **illness of knowing** (bìng zhī).\nOnly those who know that **knowing is an illness** (zhī zhī bìng wéi bìng)\nand **forget their knowing** (ér wàng qí zhī),\nthus do not fall ill.\nHow is it that the sage does not fall ill?\nBecause he knows that **knowing is an illness**,\nyet always acts as if he does not know—\nthus he does not fall ill.\n\n**The Sayings of the People Not Fearing the Way — Chapter 72**\nIf the people do not fear the **Way’s威** (wēi),\nthen the **great威** (dà wēi) will arrive.\nDo not **narrow their dwelling** (xiá qí suǒ jū),\ndo not **exhaust their life** (yàn qí suǒ shēng).\nOnly because of **non-exhaustion** (bù yàn),\none does not exhaust.\nThus the sage **knows himself yet does not reveal himself** (zì zhī bù zì xiàn),\n**loves himself yet does not honor himself** (zì ài bù zì guì)—\nthus he abandons that and takes this.\n\nAnger and **威** (wēi) are small,\nnon-anger and **威** are great.\nThe sage does not bend the world with his **威**,\nbut makes the people **not fear the容 of威** (wēi zhī róng),\nwhile having **the heart to fear virtue** (dé zhī xīn)—\nthen the **威 of non-anger** (bù nù zhī wēi) silently prevails over them—\nthis is called the **great威 arriving**.\n\nTo **transform the people** (huà mín) so they attain their nature (xìng) fully,\nthen to **expand and fulfill them** (kuò ér chōng zhī),\ntheir dwelling will not be narrow—\nto **nurture and complete them** (yù ér chéng zhī),\ntheir life will not be exhausted—\nthis is how the sage embodies the **Dao of Heaven and Earth** (tiān dì dào).\n\nEmbodying **Heaven’s great威** (tiān dà wēi) yet not angering,\nembodying **Earth’s broad dwelling** (dì guǎng jū) yet not narrowing,\nembodying **the Dao’s perpetual generation** (dào shēng shēng) yet not exhausting.\nOnly the **Supreme One** (shàng) does not exhaust the people’s life—\nthus the people attain their nature fully and are not exhausted,\nand so the sage does not reveal himself yet is clear.\nOnly through **clarity** (míng) does one know oneself and embody Heaven and Earth,\nand so not honor oneself yet is virtuous (dé).\nOnly through **virtue** (dé) does one love oneself and follow the **great Dao** (dà dào),\nthus abandoning self-revelation and self-honoring,\nand taking this embodiment of the **Dao of Heaven and Earth**.\n\n**The Sayings of Courage in Daring and Not Daring — Chapter 73**\nCourage in daring leads to **death** (shā),\ncourage in not daring leads to **life** (huó).\nThese two paths—\none beneficial, one harmful—\nare what Heaven detests—\nwho knows their reason?\nThus the sage finds them difficult.\nThe Dao of Heaven is:\nto **prevail without contention** (bù zhēng ér shàn shèng),\nto **respond without words** (bù yán ér shàn yìng),\nto **call without summoning** (bù zhào ér zì lái),\nto **be plain yet skillful in plotting** (tǎn rán ér shàn móu).\n**Heaven’s net is vast and open** (tiān wǎng huī huī),\n**sparse yet never losing** (shū ér bù shī).\n\nTo be **courageous in daring** (yǒng yú gǎn) and place oneself before the world—\nthis is called **contrary to Heaven’s Dao** (nì tiān dào),\nand so one dies.\nTo be **courageous in not daring** (yǒng yú bù gǎn) and not place oneself before the world—\nthis is called **embodying Heaven’s Dao** (tǐ tiān dào),\nand so one lives.\nYet courage in not daring is beneficial to life yet harmful to customs,\nwhile courage in daring is beneficial to customs yet harmful to life—\nin the eyes of the world, this cannot be doubted,\nand so they are confused.\nIf Heaven detests it,\nwho can truly know its reason?\n\nMoreover, Heaven’s Dao **diminishes excess and benefits humility** (kuī yíng ér yì qiān),\nso those who follow Heaven endure,\nwhile those who go against Heaven perish—\nthus the sage finds them difficult and does not dare to act.\n\nHeaven’s Dao originally has no purpose—\nwhen all things emerge,\nit emerges with them yet does not claim credit,\nwhen all things return,\nit returns with them yet does not reject them—\nall things receive their life from this,\nand so it is called *prevailing without contention*.\n\nThe four seasons proceed therein,\nand all things are born therein—\nyet it speaks not and responds with perfect ease.\n\nThe virtuous are blessed by it,\nthe licentious are doomed by it—\nyet it summons none, and all come of their own accord.\n\nIt shows humanity simplicity to know,\nand responds to all things with boundless variation—\nyet it is straightforward and ever well-planned.\n\nThe Heavenly Net is vast and wide,\nspread yet never failing—\nis this not how it works?\n\n**Chapter 74: The People Do Not Fear Death**\nThe people do not ordinarily fear death—\nhow can one terrify them with death?\n\nIf one makes the people constantly fear death,\nand those who act strangely are seized and killed,\nwho would dare?\n\nThere are always officials charged with killing.\nIf one substitutes for the officials who kill,\nit is like substituting for the master carpenter to wield the axe.\nIf one substitutes for the master carpenter to wield the axe,\nfew will escape uninjured hands.\n\nWhen the people retain their natural inclinations,\nthey always find joy in life.\nIf they lose their natural inclinations,\nwhat is there to fear in death?\n\nEven if harsh laws are imposed to terrify them with death,\nthe people will still defy them and never be truly reformed.\nIf one makes the people constantly fear death,\nit is to ensure they retain their natural inclinations\nand recognize the joy of life—\nthus, they will avoid transgressions.\nIf there are those who act strangely,\nI may seize and kill them—\nwho would dare to do so again?\n\nThere are always officials charged with killing—\nthis is called *virtuous governance by decree*.\nIf one substitutes for the officials who kill,\nit is called *unvirtuous governance by edict*.\nIf the people do not ordinarily fear death,\nyet one terrifies them with death—\nis this not like substituting for the master carpenter?\n\nThe master carpenter of all things is the sovereign of creation.\nThe sovereign of creation is the Dao of Heaven’s non-action.\nTo act against Heaven and manipulate things is *action*—\nfew escape self-harm.\n\n**Chapter 75: The People’s Hunger**\nThe people’s hunger arises from their rulers’ excessive taxation—\nthus they hunger.\nThe people’s difficulty in being governed arises from their rulers’ interference—\nthus they are difficult to govern.\nThe people’s indifference to death arises from their rulers’ excessive indulgence in life—\nthus they regard death lightly.\n\nOnly those who do not cling to life are superior to those who prize it.\nThe king regards the people as Heaven,\nand the people regard food as Heaven.\nThe sage’s governance reduces punishments,\nlightens taxes and levies,\nand understands the *Heaven of Heaven*—\nonly then can the people be preserved.\n\nExcessive taxation arises from heavy burdens,\nyet they do not know to lighten taxes and levies to nourish the people—\nthus the people’s hunger.\nThe rulers’ interference arises from burdensome governance,\nyet they do not know to reduce punishments to settle them—\nthus the people’s difficulty in being governed.\n\nIn general, human nature thrives in prosperity,\nthen harbors anxiety,\nand returns to simplicity and purity,\nthen desires nothing else.\nWhen hunger and disorder prevail,\nthey do not accept their proper measure,\nand their pursuit of gain grows ever more frantic—\nthus, some are driven to death’s brink by excessive indulgence in life,\nand so they regard death lightly.\n\nOnly those who embody the Dao\nguard their inner realm with harmony,\nand their vital essence remains unspent while their Heavenly nature is preserved.\nSuch beings understand the essence of life\nand do not strive for what cannot be sustained—\nthis is superior to prizing life while regarding death lightly.\n\n**Chapter 76: The Nature of Life**\nWhen life begins, humanity is soft and weak;\nwhen death comes, it becomes rigid and strong.\nWhen plants and trees begin, they are tender and brittle;\nwhen they die, they wither and decay.\nThus, rigidity and strength are the companions of death,\nwhile softness and weakness are the companions of life.\nTherefore, strong armies do not conquer,\nand rigid wood snaps—\nhence, rigidity and strength belong below,\nwhile softness and weakness belong above.\n\nIn life, bones are weak and sinews supple;\nin death, sinews and bones become rigid and strong.\nIn life, bark is tender and branches supple;\nin death, branches and leaves wither and decay.\nThus, rigidity and strength are the companions of death,\nwhile softness and weakness are the companions of life—\nthis is the natural order.\nStrong armies do not conquer,\njust as rigid wood snaps—\nrigidity and strength are companions of death,\nthus they belong below,\nwhile softness and weakness are companions of life,\nthus they belong above.\nThis is also the proper way of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Chapter 77: The Dao of Heaven**\n\n「天之道，其犹张弓与？高者抑之，下者举之，有余者损之，不足者补之。天之道，损有余而补不足也。人之道则反：损不足以益有余。孰能损有余而奉不足於天下？唯有道耳。\n\n是以圣人行而不恃，功成不居，不欲以己之贤显於人。天之道，畎中为至，无过与不及。其犹张弓乎：高者抑之，不使有余，故有余者损；下者举之，不使不足，故不足者补。天道减盈满，补虚空，毁强盛，益衰弱。人之道则一切相反，损不足以益有余。能以无为之道奉天下者，唯天道然。圣人体道者也，故行而不恃，功成不居，不以己之所长自见於人，常无损，此乃圣人之所以能天。\n\n**Chapter 78: The Dao of the World’s Softness and Weakness**\n天下莫柔弱於水，而攻坚强者莫之能先，以其无以易之也。柔胜刚，弱胜强，天下莫不知而莫能行。是以圣人言：受国之垢是为社稷主，受国之不祥是为天下王。正言若反。\n\n天下莫柔弱於水，而能攻坚强之物者，物莫能胜，以其有常而无以易之也，故几於道矣。柔胜刚、弱胜强，天下莫不知而莫能行，何哉？以其益生，以其心使气，故失柔弱之道。夫柔弱有常而无以易之者，其唯天地之道乎？唯地之道，受国之垢而不自化，乃化化者也，是谓社稷主，此之谓柔之胜刚者欤？唯天之道，受国之不祥而不自生，乃生生者也，是谓天下王，此之谓弱之胜强者欤？夫正言若反者，受国之垢与不祥也。以正言之，若反者矣。\n\n**Chapter 79: Harmonizing Great Grievances**\n和大怨者，必有余怨，安可为善？是以圣人执左契，不责於人。故有德司契，无德司彻。天道无亲，常与善人：阳为德，无为也；阴为怨，有为也。\n\n世之人勇於敢为，故怨生。加以知慧仁义以和大怨，怨愈多矣。若是者，安可为善？且知慧外通，七义多责，故敢为多怨。是以圣人执天之行，处无为之事，行不言之教，予於人而不取，故不责於人，何怨之有？\n\n上德无为而报怨以德，故曰有德司契。下德有为而以和大怨，故曰无德司彻。天之道，是谓上德者：无亲无疏，唯善人无为者常与之。\n\n**Chapter 81: Faithful Speech is Not Ornate**\n信言不美，美言不信。善者不辩，辩者不善。知者不博，博者不知。圣人无积，既以为人己愈有，既以与人己愈多。天之道，利而不害；圣人之道，为而不争。\n\n信言者，希言也，其出口也，淡乎其无味，故不美。」\n\n**Chapter 81 (continued): Faithful Speech is Not Ornate**\n\n*\"Beautiful speech\"* is mere pretense—\nwhen one speaks lightly and promises much,\ntrust is scarce, and thus it is untrustworthy.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven speaks not, yet responds with perfect goodness—\nthus the virtuous do not argue.\n\nTo reconcile great grievances—\nhow can it be called good?\n\nHence, those who argue are not virtuous.\n\nThe wise understand principles deeply,\nand in grasping truth, they return to simplicity—\nthus the wise are not learned in excess.\n\nTo drown in vast knowledge only multiplies what one sees and hears,\nyet it falls short of true clarity—\nthus the learned are not truly wise.\n\nTo be unadorned, unpersuasive, and unburdened by excess—\nthis is to dwell in non-possession within oneself.\n\nThe Dao of the Sage is non-possession within oneself,\nso it flows without accumulation.\nThus the Sage has no hoard—\nwith hoarding comes insufficiency,\nbut without storing, there is abundance.\n\nThe Sage, having no hoard,\nnourishes the world with the Way of abundance—\nall turn to draw from it without depletion,\nand so the more one gives to others, the more one possesses,\nthe more one bestows, the more one has.\n\nFor the Sage’s Dao is the Dao of Heaven itself—\nHeaven’s Dao benefits without harm,\nand thus the Sage’s Dao acts without contention.\n\nMoreover, Heaven bestows beauty and benefit upon the world—\nwhat harm could there be?\n\nThe Sage acts through non-action,\nneither disrupting Heaven’s order\nnor defying the nature of things—\nwhat contention could there be?\n\nThis is the conclusion of the *De Jing*,\nfor virtue encompasses the Dao,\nand the Dao encompasses Heaven.\n\nTo fail to comprehend Heaven is to fail to grasp the Sage—\nthus the *Mystic Classic of the Dao and Virtue* ends here.\n\n---\n**End of Volume Two of *The Complete Explanation of the True Classic of the Dao and Virtue***\n#1 *\"If clumsy\"*—likely *\"If bent\"* (or *\"If yielding\"*).\n#2 *\"This\"*—likely

      "translated_text": "**Chapter One: \"The Dao That Can Be Spoken Of\"**\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao;\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal Name.\n\nThe nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;\nThe named is the mother of all things.\n\nEver without desire, one observes its subtlety;\nEver with desire, one observes its peril.\n\nThese two, though issuing from the same source, bear different names—\nYet both are called the Mysterious.\nThe Mysterious beyond the Mysterious—\nThe gateway through which all subtleties emerge.\n\nThe Dao is the void, the natural and spontaneous.\nBecause it is natural, it endures;\nIf forced, it perishes.\n\nTo call it the Dao is but to impose a name—\nHow can this be its true nature?\n\nYet if it can be named, then there exists what cannot be named—\nThis is the *you* (酉).\n\nHeaven can be Heaven but cannot be Earth;\nEarth can be Earth but cannot be Heaven.\nAbove and below differ in position;\nSquare and round differ in form.\nThus, departing from the origin, Heaven and Earth arise—\nThis is the Dao that can be spoken of, yet not the eternal Dao.\n\nDispersed, it becomes rivers and seas;\nCondensed, it becomes mountains and peaks.\nBirds and beasts fly and walk;\nGrasses and trees blossom and bear fruit.\nThus, descending from the origin and flowing to the end,\nAll things are born—\nThis is the name that can be named, yet not the eternal Name.\n\nThe eternal Dao is the undifferentiated unity of yin and yang,\nBefore their separation, when they were one.\nFrom this oneness arises the One yet unformed—\nNo name can be given to it,\nThus it is nameless, the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe eternal Name is when yin and yang divide,\nAnd Heaven and Earth emerge.\nOnly then do all things arise,\nThus it is named, the mother of all things.\n\nOnly the Dao of Heaven is called the eternal \"without\":\nTo embody Heaven’s Dao is to be without desire and without action;\nTo embody Earth’s Dao is to be without movement and ever still.\n\nTo harmonize Heaven and Earth’s Dao with humanity,\nOne attains the pure and harmonious *qi* to become perfect.\nThe greatest perfection is ineffable and inexpressible—\nYet it governs the world and brings peace to the people,\nAs does the Dao of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThus, for those above, without desire,\nThe people become pure and tranquil, transformed.\nTo cultivate what is beautiful as beautiful—\nIts fullness cannot be exhausted.\n\nThis Dao is pure and uncarved,\nThus the Dao that can be spoken of cannot truly be spoken—\nYet it aligns with the eternal Dao.\n\nEver without desire, one observes its subtlety:\nBecause one remains ever still and unmoving,\nThe form returns to the center, the spirit undispersed—\nThus the eternal Dao reveals its subtlety.\n\nThe subtlety is motionless and ever tranquil;\nGreat transformation unfolds in the world,\nAs the body, unspoiled, finds joy—\nPreserving the True One, its subtlety is nameless.\n\nAs for a land with a ruler,\nIf the ruler desires nothing,\nThe people desire nothing—\nThus arises the pure and thick virtue, untainted.\nHence, ever without desire, one observes its subtlety.\n\nIf one embodies Earth’s Dao and returns to the origin,\nThen the ever-present becomes visible—\nDesire is observed to perceive its peril.\n\nThese two—Heaven and Earth’s Dao—\nBoth arise from the One,\nThus they are said to issue from the same source yet bear different names.\nThough issuing from the same source, they are both called the Mysterious.\n\nThe Mysterious contains red and black:\n*Qián* is red, *Kūn* is black,\nBoth hidden within the *Huáng* (皇).\nThis is the *Huáng Tiān*, the *Huáng Dì*.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth\nGathers *qi* at the Upper Primordial—\nThus the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious.\nThe Mysterious beyond the Mysterious is called the Great *Fán* (梵).\n\nThe Heaven within Heaven,\nDescending to govern the human body’s *ní wán* (泥丸) and *jiàng gōng* (绛宫),\nRegulating the Five *Qi* and blending the Hundred Spirits,\nThrough which all subtleties enter and exit—\nThus it is called the gateway of all subtleties.\n\nIf one can cultivate purity, stillness, and embrace the One,\nPreserving and guarding the *Xuándū* (玄都),\nThen one attains the eternal Dao.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Two: \"When All Under Heaven Know\"**\n\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,\nThen ugliness arises;\nWhen all know goodness as goodness,\nThen wickedness arises.\n\nThus, being and non-being give rise to each other,\nDifficulty and ease define each other,\nLong and short give form to each other,\nHigh and low complement each other,\nSounds harmonize with each other,\nBefore and after follow each other.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts without action,\nTeaches without speech.\nAll things arise without resistance,\nAre born without possession,\nAct without reliance,\nAnd when the deed is done, takes no credit.\nBecause he does not take credit,\nHis virtue does not depart.\n\nBeauty and goodness are the natural Dao of Heaven and Earth—\nAll under Heaven knows them.\nYet when beauty is recognized as beauty,\nThen ugliness arises.\nWhen goodness is recognized as goodness,\nThen wickedness arises—\nWhy is this?\n\nHeaven and Earth give birth to the forms of things,\nYet these forms are never without beauty.\nBecause things have birth, death, and decay—\nLike the divine and the putrid, the return and transformation—\nThen what was once beautiful becomes loathsome.\n\nHeaven and Earth give birth to the spirit of humanity,\nYet this spirit is never without goodness.\nBecause humanity possesses external wisdom—\nLike reconciling great grudges, yet leaving lingering resentment—\nThen goodness splits into wickedness.\n\nOnce beauty and goodness are distinguished,\nThey no longer align with the Dao of non-action.\nThus, one and the other transform each other,\nMeeting only to invert—\nHence the following text illustrates this.\n\nBeing and non-being give rise to each other\nBecause the eternal Dao is formless—\nThere is the logic of being and non-being generating each other,\nThus there are difficult and easy matters to define.\n\nLong and short give form to each other\nBecause Earth’s Dao has no corners—\nThere are measures of long and short to define,\nThus there are inclinations of high and low.\n\nSounds harmonize with each other\nBecause Heaven’s Dao is subtle in sound—\nThere are musical tones to harmonize,\nThus there are responses of before and after.\n\nOnly the Sage understands the transformations of beauty and ugliness,\nThe burdens of goodness and wickedness—\nThus he embodies the natural Dao of Heaven and Earth,\nActing without action,\nTeaching without speech.\n\nOnly by teaching without speech\nDo all things arise without resistance.\nThus, holding the left tablet but not demanding compliance from others—\nWho then would be wicked?",

within oneself there is no dwelling,\nThings cannot displace it—\nWhat then could depart?\n\nHence it is said:\nOnly by not dwelling does one not depart.\n\n**Chapter Three: Not Honoring the Worthy**\nNot honoring the worthy, so the people do not contend;\nNot valuing rare treasures, so the people do not steal;\nNot displaying what is desirable, so the heart does not stray.\nThus the Sage’s governance:\nEmpties the mind, fills the belly,\nWeakens the will, strengthens the bones.\nEver keeps the people without knowledge, without desire,\nSo even the wise dare not act.\n\nActing in non-action,\nThen nothing remains untended.\n\nThe worthy have intelligence—\nHonor them, and the people contend.\nMerchants have desires—\nValue their goods, and thieves multiply.\nThe worthy are names,\nMerchants are profits—\nNothing more desirable to people than names and profits.\nSince neither is honored nor valued,\nThis is called not displaying what is desirable.\n\nNot displaying what is desirable,\nThen the spirit guards the form—\nHow could the heart then be disordered?\n\nThus the Sage does not honor the worthy,\nEmbodying Heaven’s lack of knowledge;\nDoes not value goods,\nFollowing Earth’s lack of desire.\nEmbodying Heaven, the mind is emptied,\nFollowing Earth, the belly is filled—\nThe mind’s emptiness weakens the will,\nThe belly’s fullness strengthens the bones.\nThus ever keeping the people without knowledge, without desire,\nEven great worthies, though wise,\nAre subdued by the Sage and dare not act in contrivance.\n\nThis is called: Acting in non-action, then nothing remains untended.\n\n**Chapter Four: The Dao’s Pervasiveness**\nThe Dao is pervading yet used without excess,\nSometimes not full—\nDeep, like the origin of all things.\nBlunting its sharpness,\nUntangling its complications,\nDulling its brilliance,\nAligning with the dust—\nSerene, as if it exists.\n\nI do not know whose child it is,\nBefore the Imperial Sovereign.\n\nThe Dao in Heaven,\nUsing non-action,\nHence it is called the pervading Dao.\nPervading—\nEmpty yet containing all things.\nYet great fullness is like emptiness,\nBecause it can contain all things,\nThus it is not full yet overflows.\n\nThe Dao in Earth,\nWith stillness as its essence,\nHence it is called deep.\nDeep—\nProfound yet unfathomable.\nYet all things depend upon it,\nYet do not know their source,\nThus it seems like the origin.\n\nIf one embodies Heaven’s Dao,\nPervading, empty, tranquil—\nBlunting sharpness;\nEmbodying Earth’s Dao,\nDeep, still, quiescent—\nUntangling complications.\nBlunting sharpness—\nIts upper reaches harmonize light without dazzling—\nIs this not the Dao in Heaven?\nUntangling complications—\nIts lower reaches aligns with dust without filth—\nIs this not the Dao in Earth?\n\nThe Dao in Heaven and Earth,\nPervading, empty, deep—\nSerene, indeed it exists.\nThough called existing,\nIn Heaven it sometimes exists,\nIn Earth it seems to exist—\nHence it is called \"seemingly existing.\"\n\nFrom the primordial beginning of ages past,\nThus unknown whose child transformed into all heavens—\nThis is called before the Imperial Sovereign.\n\n**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth’s Lack of Ren**\nHeaven and Earth lack *ren*—\nThey treat all things as sacrificial straw dogs;\nThe Sage lacks *ren*—\nHe treats the people as sacrificial straw dogs.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nIs it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet not exhausted,\nMoving yet ever producing.\n\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion,\nBetter to hold to the center.\n\nSeven—\nThis is the human heart.\nLacking *ren*, it is ever without attachment.\nOnly ever without attachment,\nThus though there is the reality of love and benefit,\nThere is no burden of love and benefit—\nThis is why Heaven, Earth, and the Sage treat all things and the people as sacrificial straw dogs.\n\nBinding straw to make a dog,\nFor use in sacrifices—\nWhen appropriate, it is used,\nThus there is the reality of love and benefit;\nWhen over, it is discarded,\nThus there is no burden of love and benefit.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, like a valley—\nAlso because of its lack of attachment and central emptiness,\nThus it is like a bellows.\nThe bellows is empty yet can receive,\nReceiving yet can respond,\nEmerging from lack of attachment,\nThus it does not exhaust,\nMoving yet ever producing.\n\nIf those who act without response,\nEmerging from attachment,\nThen much speech yet cannot avoid burden—\nThus they exhaust.\nIf one embodies Heaven and Earth’s lack of attachment,\nGuarding the pervading, empty, tranquil Dao,\nNaturally attaining the spirit,\nThen responding only after stimulation—\nWhat exhaustion could there be?\n\n**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit’s Immortality**\nThe Valley Spirit does not die—\nThis is called the Mysterious Female.\nThe Mysterious Female’s gate—\nThis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nEndless, as if it exists,\nUsing it is effortless.\n\nThe world’s people know only mountain and marsh valleys,\nYet do not know what is called the Valley of the World—\nHeaven and Earth are this.\n\nHeaven and Earth lack attachment yet are centrally empty,\nBearing the form of a valley.\nHeaven and Earth can generate and transform,\nCalled the Ultimate Spirit.\nOnly the Spirit,\nResponding and thus communicating,\nAlso like the valley’s emptiness in responding—\nThus it is called the Valley Spirit.\n\nYet the generator does not generate itself,\nThe transformer does not transform itself—\nThus it endures, hence the Valley Spirit does not die.\n\nHeaven, though generating,\nIts power to generate things is the Mysterious.\nEarth, though transforming,\nIts power to transform things is the Female.\nThus it is called the Mysterious Female.\n\nThe Mysterious Female—\nIs it not yin and yang?\nBefore yin and yang harmonize and do not yet divide,\nWho then is Heaven and Earth?\nOnly when yin and yang separate do Heaven and Earth emerge,\nThus Heaven and Earth enter and exit through this—\nHence it is called the gate of the Mysterious Female,\nThis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.",
      "overlap_context": "Heaven’s Dao is subtle in sound—\nThere are musical tones to harmonize,\nThus there are responses of before and after.\n\nOnly the Sage understands the transformations of beauty and ugliness,\nThe burdens of goodness and wickedness—\nThus he embodies the natural Dao of Heaven and Earth,\nActing without action,\nTeaching without speech.\n\nOnly by teaching without speech\nDo all things arise without resistance.\nThus, holding the left tablet but not demanding compliance from others—\nWho then would be wicked?",

[三十五分],\nCollecting the *Upper Original Qi* [上元],\nThis is called the *Heavenly Root* [天根].\nIf one can embody the Dao within oneself,\nThen one attains eternal life, unending,\nAnd aligns with Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Chapter Seven: Heaven and Earth Enduring and Long-lasting**\nHeaven and Earth endure and last,\nThe reason Heaven and Earth can endure and last—\nIs that they do not generate themselves,\nHence they can attain eternal life.\nThus, the Sage allows his body to be last, yet it is first,\nRejects his body outwardly, yet it is preserved.\nIs it not because they have no selfishness?\nHence they can fulfill their selfishness.\n\nThe Dao generates all things yet does not generate itself,\nHeaven and Earth resemble the Dao,\nHence they can endure and last—\nEnduring and lasting, then they endure and last forever.\n\nHeaven and Earth have no selfishness,\nHence they have no selfishness—\nThe Sage embodies Heaven and Earth,\nHence he can fulfill his selfishness—\nFulfilling his selfishness, his body is first yet preserved.\n\n*Allowing his body to be last*—\nThis means not contending with things.\n*Rejecting his body outwardly*—\nThis means preserving his spirit.\nThis is called embodying Heaven and Earth’s lack of selfishness.\n\nHeaven’s utmost selfishness,\nYet its use is most public—\nIs this not its effect?\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Good Resembles Water**\nThe supreme good resembles water,\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend,\nDwelling where people revile—\nHence it is close to the Dao.\n\nIts dwelling is good,\nIts heart is deep,\nIts giving is generous,\nIts speech is trustworthy,\nIts governance is clear,\nIts deeds are skilled,\nIts actions are timely.\n\nOnly because it does not contend,\nHence it has no blame.\nWater’s nature—\nIf not held, then clear,\nIf not stirred, then calm,\nIf stagnant and blocked, unable to flow,\nIt also cannot be clear—\nThis reflects Heaven’s virtue,\nHence the supreme good resembles water.\n\nWater benefits all things,\nClose to Heaven and Earth’s Dao,\nYet all these are actions fitting their measure,\nHence it is called *actions are timely*.\nActions fitting their measure—\nHow could there be any contention?\nThis is why it has no blame.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Holding Yet Filling It**\nHolding yet filling it,\nNot as good as letting it be;\nPushing yet sharpening it,\nCannot long endure.\n\nGold and jade fill the hall,\nYet none can guard them;\nRich and noble yet arrogant,\nThey bring ruin upon themselves.\n\nWhen achievement is complete,\nAnd name is established,\nRetire in body—\nThis is Heaven’s Way.\n\nFilling cannot last,\nBetter not to desire filling—\nWhy must one hold it?\n\nAdvancing swiftly, retreating quickly,\nBetter to blunt its sharpness—\nWhy must one push it?\n\nGold and jade fill the hall,\nYet none can guard them—\nThis is because they are already full.\nRich and noble yet arrogant,\nThey bring ruin upon themselves—\nThis is because they are already sharp.\n\nThis is the loss of the *Way of Kindness and Modesty* [慈俭之道],\nHence there are the faults of excess and sharpness.\n\nExcess is achievement complete,\nSharpness is name established.\nOnce achievement is complete and name is established,\nThen there is the principle of retiring in body—\nThis is the movement of yin and yang’s advancing, retreating, excess, and deficiency.\n\nIf one can guard the *Way of Kindness and Modesty*,\nThen abandon achievement and name,\nReturn to the common people—\nHow could there be excess or

closes,\nCan one be female?\nBright and clear, reaching everywhere,\nCan one be without knowing?\n\nNurturing and storing life,\nGenerating yet not possessing,\nDoing yet not relying,\nLong-lasting yet not slaughtering—\nThis is called the *Mysterious Virtue* [玄德].\n\nThe body—\nThe spirit’s chariot,\nThe vital essence’s vehicle.\n\nThe soul ascends and moves,\nThe vital essence follows, entering and exiting—\nThus the spirit’s threads extend outward,\nAnd governance is directed toward action,\nHence the three souls are restless,\nAnd the vital essence is ever declining.\n\nOnly the

[卫生之经],\nHence it is called *Nurturing the Vital Essence and Spirit*.\n\nThe *Essentials of Vitality and Longevity*—\nHave no other secrets,\nYet do not depart from the three: *Essence* [精], *Qi* [气], *Spirit* [神].\n\nThose who can embrace unity,\nTheir essence does not tremble;\nThose who are like infants,\nTheir qi does not rage;\nThose who cleanse and purify thought,\nTheir spirit is

      "translated_text": "If such is the case,\nThen the essence is complete and unspent,\nThe qi harmonious and unrestrained,\nThe spirit clear and unblemished—\nThen virtue and Dao unite as one,\nMingling indistinctly, in great harmony with the boundless void.\n\nThat which gives life is the Dao.\nThat which nurtures is virtue.\nThe great virtue of Heaven and Earth is called *generation*—\nThis virtue, when spoken of in terms of the whole of Heaven and Earth,\nIs none other than the Dao itself.\n\nHeaven is the Mysterious,\nEarth is the Field—\nThus, nurturing follows them.\nEarth’s Dao generates yet does not generate itself,\nSo it generates yet does not possess.\nHeaven’s Dao acts without doing,\nSo it acts yet does not rely.\nThe Constant Dao fulfills and sustains,\nSo it sustains yet does not govern.\n\nThese three correspond to the *Dantian* at the crown of the head—\nThis is the virtue of Heaven.\n\nIn Heaven, it is the Mysterious—\nThus, the Mysterious Virtue is none other than Heaven’s Virtue.\nHeaven’s Virtue acts through non-action,\nAnd those who cultivate the spirit likewise rely on the absence of contrivance—\nHow could this virtue not be Heaven’s Virtue?\n\n**Thirty Spokes, Chapter Ten**\nThirty spokes converge at one hub;\nIt is the emptiness that gives the wheel its use.\nMold clay to make a vessel;\nIt is the emptiness that gives it utility.\nCarve doors and windows to make a room;\nIt is the emptiness that gives it space.\n\nThus, what is present brings advantage,\nBut what is absent brings use.\nThat which is ridden is the wheel’s motion alone;\nThat which is fitting is the vessel’s proper function;\nThat which is dwelt in is the room’s stillness.\n\nMovement is action,\nStillness is repose,\nAnd proper use lies between the two—\nThus the Sage elucidates the Dao through this.\n\nObserving these three,\nAll bear the symbol of external presence and internal absence—\nPresence is substance,\nAbsence is void,\nAbsence uses presence for advantage,\nPresence relies on absence for function.\nReflecting inward, one must resolve this within oneself.\n\nPresence is form,\nAbsence is spirit—\nSpirit generates form,\nSo form relies on spirit for function.\nForm shapes spirit,\nSo spirit relies on form for substance.\nWithout form, spirit cannot manifest,\nWithout spirit, form cannot complete itself.\nWhen form and spirit unite in harmony,\nThey mutually generate and fulfill—\nThen the Dao is preserved.\n\nYet how is it that spirit often loves humanity,\nWhile humanity does not love spirit,\nThus leading to early decline?\n\nTherefore, the virtuous cultivate a tranquil heart and preserve the spirit,\nMaintaining emptiness within.\n\n**Five Colors, Chapter Twelve**\nFive colors blind the eyes,\nFive tones deafen the ears,\nFive flavors dull the palate,\nGalloping hunts drive the mind to madness.\nRare treasures entangle one’s conduct.\n\nThus the Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes,\nAnd discards the former to take the latter.\n\nThat which is unseen is called *tranquil*—the Constant Dao.\nThe world’s people cannot gather vision inward,\nBut let the five colors dazzle the eyes externally,\nThus losing the Dao of the Primordial Beginning—\nHence, they are blind.\n\nThat which is unheard is called *subtle*—Heaven’s Dao.\nThe world’s people cannot return hearing to stillness,\nBut let the five tones assail the ears externally,\nThus losing the Dao of the First Origin—\nHence, they are deaf.\n\nThat which cannot be grasped is called *refined*—Earth’s Dao.\nThe world’s people cannot nourish qi from the Great Harmony,\nBut let the five flavors dominate the mouth,\nThus losing the Dao of the Great Simplicity—\nHence, they are dulled.\n\nThese three—\nLosing the inner guard of the inch-field,\nAnd wandering the mind—\nThus it is said that galloping hunts drive the mind to madness.\n\nOnce externally attached to things,\nAnd fixated on desires,\nOne becomes burdened in conduct—\nThus rare treasures entangle one’s steps.\n\nTherefore, the Sage, without knowing, nurtures virtue within,\nAnd though desires may appear,\nHe does not lose his nature externally—\nThus he fills the belly alone,\nAnd does not indulge the eyes.\n\nWhy speak of the eyes alone among these three?\nThe nine orifices and three vital gates—\nTheir mechanism lies in the eyes.\nThus, discard the external allure of sight,\nAnd take the inner substance of virtue.\n\n**Honor and Humiliation, Chapter Thirteen**\nHonor and humiliation are like a shock,\nTreasure great calamity as one’s own body.\n\nWhat is meant by *honor and humiliation*?\nHonor is lowly—\nTo gain it is like a shock,\nTo lose it is like a shock—\nThis is called *honor and humiliation as a shock*.\n\nWhat is meant by *treasuring great calamity as one’s own body*?\nMy great calamity arises because I have a body.\nIf I had no body, what calamity would I have?\n\nThus, to treasure the body for all under Heaven,\nIs to say that one may entrust all under Heaven.\nTo love the body for all under Heaven,\nIs to say that one may commit all under Heaven to it.\n\nHonor and humiliation arise from engagement with affairs.\nOnce engaged with affairs,\nThe spirit cannot guard internally—\nThus, it is like a shock.\n\nTreasure is virtue.\nEveryone has virtue within themselves,\nYet some burden their own virtue—\nThis is because they have a body,\nThus great calamity is like the body itself.\n\nHonor is being subject to others,\nThe way of being beneath others—\nTo have honor is to

mastered the Dao\nMastered the subtle mysteries of the Way,\nPenetrated the profound mysteries of Heaven’s Dao,\nAnd grasped the subtle essence of Earth’s Dao—\nThus he was called *subtle, mysterious, and profound*.\n\nThough inwardly he penetrated the subtle mysteries,\nOutwardly he remained unfathomable—\nThus, when viewed externally, he only feigned these appearances.\n\nCautious yet following movement naturally—\nLike one crossing a river in winter.\nSilent yet still—\nLike one fearing neighbors on all sides.\nNeither active nor passive,\nYet dignified as a guest—\nThese three are outward appearances.\n\nYet outwardly cautious while inwardly like a valley—\nVast and without thought.\nOutwardly fearful while inwardly like uncarved wood—\nSincere and without desire.\nOutwardly like a guest while inwardly dissolving—\nLike ice melting without attachment.\n\nBecause inwardly he was dissolving, like uncarved wood, like a valley,\nHe aligned with the true Dao—\nThus he was called *subtle, mysterious, and profound*.\n\nBecause outwardly he appeared cautious, fearful, like a guest,\nYet did not reveal himself—\nThus he was called *unfathomable*.\n\nThough appearing thus,\nHe blended with the common flow—\nThus he was turbulent like muddy water.\n\nWho can settle the muddy and let it gradually clear?\nWho can remain still and let movement arise naturally?\nOnly those who

follows Heaven.\n\nStillness is the body of Heaven.\nMovement is the Dao of Heaven.\nIf one follows Heaven’s Dao,\nThen gradually life will arise—\nFor Heaven naturally follows the Dao.\n\nTo preserve this Dao,\nOnly the sage who masters it does so—\nThus he does not seek fullness.\nOnly by not seeking fullness\nCan one endure decay and hold fast to the original,\nWithout abandoning the root for the new.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: The Chapter on Attaining the Extremes of Emptiness**\n\nAttain the extremes of emptiness,\nGuard stillness with sincerity.\nWhen all things flourish together,\nI observe their return.\n\nAll things teeming, each returns to its root.\nReturning to the root is called stillness,\nStillness is called restoring the vital breath.\nRestoring the vital breath is called

kind—\nTheir roots above, their branches below,\nFollowing Heaven’s Dao and moving.\n\nAll things teeming, each returns to its root—\nWhen all things are nurtured without comparison, this is the original root,\nAnd it can be observed in Heaven.\n\nThus the sage said:\n*\"Flowers and leaves return to their fruit,\nStems and leaves to their roots—\nThe Dao returns to its origin,\nAt the yellow cavity between the brows.\"*\n\nThis is what is meant.\n\nReturning to the root is called stillness—\nOnly stillness follows Earth’s substance,\nAnd thus one can restore one’s nature.\n\nStillness is called restoring the vital breath—\nStillness allows gradual clarity,\nAnd only clarity manifests Heaven’s function,\nThus one can restore the vital breath.\n\nThe *Tàiyī* (太一) governs life,\nIts root is in the *níwán* (泥丸).\nThus *Tàiyī* is the totality of Heaven and Earth’s Dao—\nThis is called constancy.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth’s Dao are unified as One,\nOne gradually enters the true constancy—\nThus restoring the vital breath is called constancy.\n\nKnowing and guarding constancy,\nSpirit arises from it,\nEnlightenment emerges from it—\nAll originating from One—\nThus knowing constancy is called enlightenment.\n\nEnlightenment is the union of *yīn* and *yáng* as One.\nNot knowing constancy is to abandon Heaven and Earth’s Dao\nAnd harbor delusions,\nFollowing things as they shift,\nStraying into misfortune,\nForever losing the true Dao—\nThus misfortune arises.\n\nKnowing constancy and embracing it—\nThis is knowing Heaven and Earth’s Dao.\nBetween Heaven and Earth, there is nothing it does not contain—\nWhat private interest could there be?\nThus it is said: *Embracing makes it universal.*\n\nThe sovereign embodies Heaven and Earth’s impartiality,\nYet achieves

non-action,\nThus the Great Dao declines.\n\nWhen wisdom emerges, why does great deceit arise?\nWisdom has knowledge, kindness has perception—\nBecause it is contrary to Heaven’s Dao of non-knowledge,\nThus great deceit arises.\n\nWhen familial bonds fracture, why does filial piety and kindness arise?\nThe filial revere their own kin, the kind cherish their own children—\nBecause it is contrary to Earth’s Dao of non-desire,\nThus familial bonds fracture.\n\nWhen the state falls into chaos, why do loyal ministers arise?\nThey see peril and risk their lives in admonition—\nBecause it is contrary to the King’s Dao of rectitude,\nThus loyal ministers’ virtue is displayed.\n\nThe Great Dao is vast and unfathomable,\nNeither declining nor flourishing—\nAncient and modern are unchanged,\nYet people ruin it themselves—\nThis is the natural course of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang.\nYet when exhausted, it transforms;\nWhen transformed, it flows;\nWhen flowing, it endures.\n\nThe Sage, ruling all under Heaven with the Dao,\nGathers at seven without relying on it,\nIs light on righteousness without accumulation,\nThe people return to simplicity and purity,\nAnd wisdom fades away.\nPeople lack craftiness, deceit ceases,\nWind and customs become pure, filial piety and kindness vanish,\nOne becomes upright, and loyal ministers naturally comply—\nThis is called

wisdom?\nIs this flattering through flaws to delight benevolence?\nIs this confusing virtue to delight righteousness?\nIs this contrary to the governance of all under Heaven,\nAnd thus disturbing the natural state of life?\n\nThus, the Sage does not consider many talents as sageliness,\nDoes not consider ruling people as wisdom—\nInstead, he embodies Heaven’s Dao of non-knowledge,\nAnd the people benefit a hundredfold.\n\nHe does not consider loving things as benevolence,\nDoes not consider establishing self as righteousness—\nThus he discards benevolence and righteousness,\nAnd embodies the Great Dao of non-action,\nAnd filial piety and kindness return to obscurity.\n\nHe does not consider strange things as cleverness,\nDoes not consider wealth as profit—\nThus he discards cleverness and profit,\nAnd embodies Earth’s Dao of non-desire,\nAnd thieves and robbers vanish.\n\nThus, the people naturally return to their true nature\nAnd recover their original state.\n\nSageliness and wisdom,\nBenevolence and righteousness,\nCleverness and profit—\nThese three things,\nThrough culture, extinguish the natural,\nLose their original simplicity,\nAnd cause the people to lack

indistinct,\nYet within it lies a substance.\n\nDeep and dark,\nWithin it is essence—\nIts essence most true,\nWithin it is trust.\n\nFrom ancient times to now,\nIts name has never vanished,\nFor it encompasses all beings.\n\nHow do I know all beings are thus?\nBy this.\n\nThe *Kong* (孔) is from *zi* (子) to *yi* (乙),\nWhere the three yang reside.\nBetween the boundless and the dark,\nThe *Bu* (乾) Dao possesses true essence,\nThe moment when it responds to things.\n\n*Virtue* (德) is the Dao within me.\n*Appearance* (容) is my form resembling Heaven and Earth.\n\nIf one attains this moment of true essence\nAnd returns to my Heaven and Earth,\nThen the Dao will naturally come to me—\nThus it is said: *The Sage’s Virtue and Appearance, follow the Dao alone.*\n\nThe Dao as a thing,\nIs but vague and indistinct—\nThis is spoken of in terms of yin and yang.\n\n*Virtue* (德) as a thing,\nIs form and substance—\nThus the Dao as a thing,\nIs yin and is yang.\n\nThe vague (恍兮) is when the Dao in Heaven becomes yang,\nYang within contains yin—\nThus it is said: *vague and indistinct.*\n\nResponding to things is *spirit* (神),\nSpirit is the presence of the formless—\nSaying it is in Heaven—\nThus it is said: *within it lies a substance.*\n\nThe indistinct (惚兮) is when the Dao on Earth becomes yin,\nYin within contains yang—\nThus it is said: *indistinct and vague.*\n\nResponding to things is *qi* (氣),\nQi is the presence of the void within substance—\nSaying it is on Earth—\nThus it is said: *within it lies an image.*\n\nDeep and dark,\nWithin it is essence—\nBetween Heaven and Earth, yin and yang coexist,\nTransforming endlessly,\nThus forming the essence of things.\nI ponder this Dao,\nOriginating from the deep and dark.\n\nIts essence most true,\nResponds to the *Upper Primordial* (上元).\nWithin it is trust,\nMeaning it never fails in response.\n\nThe Dao endures from ancient times to now,\nThus from ancient times to now,\nIts name has never vanished.\nHeaven and Earth are the *origin* (甫) of all things,\nWithin me, my form resembles Heaven and Earth—\nThis is called *encompassing all beings.*\n\nIt must be called *origin* (甫),\nFor Heaven and Earth have the function of a father.\n\nHow do I know all beings are thus?\nEssence gathers into spirit,\nSpirit transforms into qi,\nQi transforms into things—\nBetween transformations, the cycle is endless,\nThe changes of all beings pass without ceasing—\nThus all things cannot help but be born,\nCannot help but die.\nThe Sage values essence,\nFor spirit can avoid death,\nCan avoid birth.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: The Doctrine of Flexibility and Completeness**\n\nFlexible yields completeness,\nCrooked yields straightness,\nHollow yields fullness,\nExhausted yields renewal,\nLittle yields acquisition,\nMuch yields confusion.\n\nThus the Sage embraces *Oneness* (一) as the model for all under Heaven.\nNot self-assertive, hence clear;\nNot self-righteous, hence illustrious;\nNot self-praising, hence fruitful;\nNot self-conceited, hence enduring.\n\nOnly because he does not contend,\nNone under Heaven can contend with him.\n\nThe ancients said, *\"Flexible yields completeness\"*—\nIs this not true?\nIndeed, it is complete and returns to its source.\n\nThe constant Dao responds to things without contention,\nThus it is said: *Flexible yields completeness.*\n\nThe Earth Dao is great and straight,\nYet appears bent—\nThus it is said: *Crooked yields straightness.*\n\nThe Heaven Dao is boundless and void,\nYet appears like a valley—\nThus it is said: *Hollow yields fullness.*\n\nThe *Kingly Dao* (王道) upholds simplicity and does nothing—\nThus it is said: *Exhausted yields renewal.*\n\nThese four principles,\nAre the four great domains of the world—\nThough divided into four great domains,\nThey are in fact rooted in one Dao,\nOne Dao alone.\n\nHeaven attains it to be clear,\nEarth attains it to be tranquil,\nThe sovereign attains it to be the *orthodox* (貞) of all under Heaven—\nThus it is said: *Little yields acquisition.*\n\nIf one descends from the root to the branches,\nAnd engages in artificial action,\nThen one is bound by desires—\nCountless ages cannot exhaust them—\nThus it is said: *Much yields confusion.*\n\nThus the Sage knows the *Supreme Dao* (至道) is not troublesome,\nDifferent paths converge in the same meeting—\nHence he embraces *Oneness* as the model for all under Heaven.\n\nIn this way, he embodies the fourfold Dao,\nTo respond to the world without bearing its burdens.\n\nNot self-assertive,\nEmbodying the *Flexible yields completeness* Dao—\nHence he is clear.\n\nNot self-righteous,\nEmbodying the *Crooked yields straightness* Dao—\nHence he is illustrious.\n\nNot self-praising,\nEmbodying the *Hollow yields fullness* Dao—\nHence he is fruitful.\n\nNot self-conceited,\nEmbodying the *Exhausted yields renewal* Dao—\nHence he endures.\n\nYet in responding to things,\nHe always takes the constant Dao as his root—\nThe constant Dao does not contend with all things—\nThus Heaven and Earth cannot contend with him.\n\nThe ancients said, *\"Flexible yields completeness\"*—\nIs this not true?\nIndeed, it is complete and returns to its source.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: The Rarity of Natural Speech**\n\nRarely speaking naturally,\nThus gusts of wind do

also attains them;\nAligning with loss,\nLoss also attains them.\n\nLacking trust is untrustworthy.\nHeaven says nothing—\nOnly listens without hearing.\n\nRare speech is the Heaven Dao,\nThus it is always natural.\n\nGusts of wind and sudden rains,\nAre the transient *qi* of Heaven and Earth.\n\nHeaven and Earth are not constant,\nAnd yet cannot endure long—\nIf people are not constant,\nHow can their virtue follow the Dao?\n\nThus those who follow the Dao,\nEmbody the vast Dao as boundless and void,\nPreserve and give birth to it—\nThey align with the Dao.\n\nEmbody the Upper Virtue as clear and tranquil,\nGuard and nurture it—\nThey align with virtue.\n\nLike gusts of wind and sudden rains,\nWhich are not constant,\nThen they revert to madness and blindness,\nBearing self-blame—\nThey align with loss.\n\nAligning with the Dao,\nThey ascend to the *Southern Palace* (南宮),\nThis is the Dao attained.\n\nAligning with virtue,\nThey prolong life and years—\nThis is virtue attained.\n\nAligning with loss,\nThey connect with the *Ghostly Dao* (鬼道),\nThis is loss attained.",

      "translated_text": "「The three ways of gaining trust in others\nAre all necessary tokens of their ultimate fate—\nIf trust is insufficient,\nThen doubt will arise.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Stilted Do Not Stand**\nThe stilted cannot stand,\nThe striding cannot walk,\nThe self-observing cannot see clearly,\nThe self-righteous cannot be manifest,\nThe self-praising achieve no merit,\nThe self-conceited cannot endure.\n\nIn the Dao,\nThey are called *excessive consumption* and *superfluous actions*.\nSome may detest them,\nThus those who follow the Dao do not dwell here.\nThe stilted set themselves up,\nSo they do not stand firm.\n\nIf one embodies the Dao of Earth,\nSilent and without desire,\nThey stand alone and never waver.\nThe striding act for themselves,\nSo they do not walk steadily.\n\nIf one embodies the Dao of Heaven,\nLofty and without scheming,\nThey traverse the world without faltering.\n\nAs for self-observation, self-righteousness, self-praise, and self-conceit,\nAll are self-made faults,\nComparable to the stilted and striding.\nThus they contradict the teachings of the earlier chapters.\n\nThose who do so,\nIn the Dao, indulge in *excessive consumption* beyond what is allotted,\nAnd in *superfluous actions* beyond virtue’s path—\nThese are all those who love fullness.\nSome detest fullness,\nThus those who follow the Dao do not dwell here.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Primordial Unity**\nThere is a Primordial Unity,\nBorn before Heaven and Earth.\n\nSilent and lofty,\nIt stands alone and never changes,\nTraverses the world without faltering—\nThus it may be called the Mother of all things.\n\nI do not know its name,\nSo I call it *Dao* and forcefully name it *Great*.\nGreat is *passing*,\nPassing is *distant*,\nDistant is *returning*.\n\nThus the Dao is great,\nHeaven is great,\nEarth is great,\nAnd the Sage-King is great.\nWithin the realm there are four great things,\nAnd the Sage-King occupies one.\n\nPeople follow Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the Dao,\nThe Dao follows *Naturalness*.\n\nWhen *qi* takes form and substance yet remains undivided, it is called *Primordial Unity*.\nIf there is a Primordial Unity,\nThen the undivided yet unseparated is it.\n\nWhen form begins to change and becomes one,\nThis One gives birth to Heaven and Earth—\nThus it is said to be born before Heaven and Earth.\n\nSpeaking of the Dao,\nSilent and unchanging,\nIts root lies in *True Constancy*—\nHow could it ever waver?\n\nSpeaking of Earth,\nLofty and ever-transforming,\nIts transformations are in *Mysterious Application*—\nHow could it ever falter?\n\nSpeaking of Heaven,\nOnly after Heaven and Earth arise do all things come into being—\nThus it is said to be the Mother of all things.\n\nWhen discussing all things under Heaven,\nThey begin with the transformation of form,\nThus its name is unknown—\nIt is called *Dao*.\n\nAbove, no further origin exists,\nSo forcefully it is named *Great*.\n\nThe Dao separates from the Primordial Unity,\nAnd Heaven and Earth begin to divide.\nHeaven attains the Dao,\nMoving without accumulation—\nThus *Great* is called *passing*.\nLight and clear become Heaven,\nHeavy and turbid become Earth—\nHeaven moves without accumulation,\nEarth is vast without bounds—\nThus *passing* is called *distant*.\nHeaven and Earth contain the *Essential Qi*,\nAnd all things transform and are born.\nDescending from origin to extremity,\nThe farther they stray from the Dao,\nThe more they accumulate—\nThus *distant* is called *returning*.\n\nOnly the Sage-King stands independent above all things,\nTransforming all things without being burdened by them,\nIn unity with the Dao,\nAnd in function with Heaven and Earth.\n\nHeaven and Earth are what the ancients called *Great*.\nWhat then does the Sage-King who rules all under Heaven do?\nHe merely embodies *Heavenly Virtue*.\n\nThus the Dao is great,\nHeaven is great,\nEarth is great,\nAnd the Sage-King is great.\nWithin the realm there are four great things,\nAnd the Sage-King occupies one—\nThe Dao, Heaven, and Earth\nAll attain *Oneness* to be great,\nBut only the Sage-King is one who follows the Dao,\nAnd his *Oneness* surpasses even the union of Heaven and Earth—\nThus he is great as well.\n\nFrom the beginning of Primordial Unity,\n*Voidness* and *Nothingness* give birth to *Naturalness*,\n*Naturalness* gives birth to the Dao,\nThe Dao gives birth to *Oneness*,\n*Oneness* gives birth to Heaven and Earth,\nAnd Heaven and Earth give birth to all things—\nIf one can reverse this law,\nAnd return to the origin,\nThey will once again align with *Naturalness*.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Heavy as Root of the Light**\nThe heavy is the root of the light,\nThe tranquil is the sovereign of the restless.\n\nThus the Sage-King never leaves his *burden* (车辎) all day,\nThough there are palaces and pleasures,\nHe rests in the lofty and detached.\n\nHow can the ruler of ten thousand chariots\nLighten his body over all under Heaven?\nLightness leads to losing his ministers,\nRestlessness leads to losing his sovereignty.\nThe heavy can govern the light,\nThus the heavy is the root of the light.\nThe tranquil can control the restless,\nThus the tranquil is the sovereign of the restless.\n\nThese two principles\nAre the fundamental roots of the Dao.\n\nThe Sage-King knows that the Dao’s fundamental roots lie here,\nThus he never leaves his *burden* all day.\n\nThe carriage, with its *voidness* as essence,\nAnd *nothingness* as function,\nGuards tranquility

are none abandoned—\nAlways good at saving things,\nAnd so there are none cast aside.\nThis is called *following clarity*.\n\nThus the good person,\nIs the teacher of the not-good,\nAnd the not-good,\nIs the resource of the good.\n\nIf one does not honor their teacher,\nOr cherish their resource,\nEven with great wisdom they are greatly confused—\nThis is called *the essential

in this,\nYet dwell not in themselves—\nAnd thus do not cherish their resource.\nThe Sage acts thus,\nNot to enlighten the people,\nBut to befuddle them.\n\nIf the *flowering* of wisdom is its

the *Way of Non-action*.\n\nThe *Heroic* is the Yang,\nThe *Feminine* is the Yin.\nIf one knows the *Heroic* at the peak of the utmost Yang,\nAnd cherishes the *Feminine* at the source of the utmost Yin,\nThen their *nurturing* is constant—\nAnd returns to the *Earthly Dao*,\nThus it is the *valley* of all under Heaven.\nA mountain ravine is a small *valley*,\nBut the Earth is the *valley* of all

depth,\nThen they return to the *Infant of the Feminine*.\n\nDay is the White,\nNight is the Black.\nIf one knows the White at the height of the day,\nAnd cherishes the Black in the time of the night,\nThen day and night are preserved—\nAnd align with the *Heavenly Dao*,\nThus it is the *model* of all under Heaven.\nThe *model* of a kingdom is but one nation’s pattern,\nBut the *Heavenly

Oneness*,\nAdjusting and yielding above to below,\nThen they return to the *Boundless*.\n\nThe *spreading* of life is Prosperous,\nThe *carving* of form is Humble.\nIf one knows the Prosperous at the beginning of life’s spreading,\nAnd cherishes the Humble after the carving of form,\nThen they return to the Root and reclaim their Command—\nAnd reverse to the *Heavenly Dao*,\nThus it is the

exhaustion—\nThis is called *their virtue/power is ever sufficient*.\nIf one can embody the *Heavenly Dao*,\nWith serene simplicity and non-action,\nThen they return to the *Uncarved*.\n\nThe *Uncarved* is the complete essence of the Dao,\nGiving birth to Heaven and Earth.\nWhen it scatters, it becomes *vessels*—\nThe light and pure become *Spirit-vessels*,\nThe heavy and coarse become *Utility-vessels*.\nThe *Spirit-vessels* are the *highest virtue/power*—\nThe *highest virtue/power* acts without doing,\nAnd nothing is left to it—\nThus the *Spirit-vessels* of all under Heaven,\nCannot be wielded.\nThe *Utility-vessels* are the *lowest virtue/power*—\nThe *lowest virtue/power* acts and leaves traces—\nThus the *Utility-vessels* of a nation,\nCannot be shown to the people.\n\nThe Sage uses the *Uncarved* and becomes the *officials and leaders*—\nThough Heaven and Earth carve and measure all things,\nThey cannot sever the *Way of Non-action*.\n\n**Chapter XXIX: The Chapter of Taking Action**\nThose who would take all under Heaven and act upon it,\nI see them as not having reached the end of their means.\n\nThe *Spirit-vessels* of all under Heaven,\nCannot be wielded.\nThe *wielder* fails them,\nThe *grasper* loses them.\nThus things sometimes advance, sometimes retreat,\nSometimes rush forth, sometimes withdraw,\nSometimes grow strong, sometimes weak,\nSometimes ascend, sometimes descend.\nHence the Sage avoids excess, avoids extravagance, avoids grandeur.\n\nHeaven and Earth endure long and last,\nBecause they constantly have no desires and act without doing—\nThus those who would take all under Heaven and act upon it,\nI see them as not having reached the end of their means.\n\nThe reason they have not reached the end of their means,\nIs that the *Spirit-vessels* of all under Heaven,\nCannot be wielded.\nYet the *Spirit-vessels* are profound and obscure,\nUnfathomable and dark—\nWisdom cannot penetrate them—\nThus the *wielder* fails them,\nAnd the *grasper* loses them.\n\nTherefore, the things of all under Heaven,\nWhen the Yang advances, the Yin follows;\nWhen the Yang reaches its peak and rushes forth,\nThe Yin responds with withdrawal;\nWhen the Yin grows strong,\nThings will grow weak;\nWhen the Yin reaches its peak and withdraws,\nThings will follow suit.\n\nThus success and failure, gain and loss,\nAre not known beforehand—\nThis is how those who would take all under Heaven and act upon it,\nAre constrained by the numbers of Yin and Yang,\nYet still cannot escape their burdens.\n\nHence the Sage embodies the *Heavenly Dao*,\nAnd wanders in the realm of *free and easy* non-action—\nThus it is said: *avoid excess*.\nThey embody the *Earthly Dao*,\nAnd eat from the fields of *simple sustenance*—\nThus it is said: *avoid extravagance*.\nThey embody the *Great Dao*,\nAnd dwell in the garden of *uncompromising* non-action—\nThus it is said: *avoid grandeur*.\nThis is not relying on all under Heaven,\nNor on ghosts and spirits,\nNor on all things—\nThus they suffer neither failure nor loss.\n\n**Chapter XXX: Aiding the Ruler with the Dao**\nTo aid the ruler with the Dao,\nIs not to use force to conquer all under Heaven—\nTheir affairs are fond of returning.\n\nWhere the army encamps,\nThorns and brambles spring up.\nAfter a great campaign,\nThere must be years of

great*.\n\n是以圣人终不为大，故能成其大。\nTherefore, the sage never claims to be great,\nAnd thus is able to accomplish greatness.\n\n阳可左而不可右，故能生而不能成。\nThe Yang can be turned left but not right,\nThus it can give birth yet cannot complete.\n\n阴可右而不可左，故能成而不能生。\nThe Yin can be turned right but not left,\nThus it can complete yet cannot give birth.\n\n唯大道泛兮，能阴能阳，能生能成，是以或左或右，无乎不可也。\nOnly the Great Way is boundless,\nCapable of both Yin and Yang,\nOf both giving birth and completing—\nThus it can be turned left or right without limit.\n\n得此道以在天，故万物恃之以生而不辞；\nTo attain this Way in Heaven,\nAll things

ruler—\nThus it may be called *the great*.\n\n大者，道之强名也。\nGreatness is the Dao’s forceful name.\n\n是以圣人虚静无欲，体於天地，故终不为大，而常然之道不期而自归之，故能成其大也。\nTherefore, the sage remains empty, tranquil, and without desire,\nEmbodying the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,\nNever claiming greatness—\nYet the Way itself spontaneously returns,\nThus the sage accomplishes true greatness.\n\n**执大象，章第三十五**\n**Holding the Great Form—Chapter Thirty-Five**\n\n执大象，天下往。\nHolding the Great Form, the world comes.\n\n往而不害，安平泰。\nComing yet causing no harm, it brings ease, tranquility, and boundless peace.\n\n乐与饵，过客止。\nDelight

insufficient to hear,\nTo use it is never to exhaust.\n\n大象无形者，道也。\nThe Great Form without form is the Dao.\n\n执大象，天下往者，以道莅天下也。\nHolding the Great Form, the world comes—\nThis is to govern the world with the Dao.\n\n有道则民之攸坚，故往而不害，安平泰。\nWhen the Dao is present, the people have a firm foundation,\nThus coming yet causing no harm,\nIt brings ease, tranquility, and boundless peace.\n\n盖法天道虚而容，故安而不扰；\nIt follows the Dao/Way of Heaven—\nEmpty yet all-encompassing,\nThus it brings ease without disturbance.\n\n法地道载而宁，故平而不陂；\nIt follows the Dao/Way of Earth—\nBearing yet tranquil,\nThus it brings tranquility without unevenness.\n\n法大道和而通，故泰而不塞。\nIt follows the Great Way—\nHarmonious yet open,\nThus it brings boundless peace without obstruction.\n\n若是者，物物不干，何害之有？\nIf such is the case,\nThings do not interfere with one another—\nWhat harm could there be?\n\n世之人悦於声，而不知天道。\nPeople of the world delight in sound,\nYet they do not know the Dao/Way of Heaven.\n\n所谓声声者，美於味，而不知地道。\nWhat is called *sound-sound* (聲聲),\nIs pleasing to the palate,\nYet they do not know the Dao/Way of Earth.\n\n所谓味味者，故着於嗜欲而久处之，不知有道者以此为蘧庐尔。\nWhat is called *flavor-flavor* (味味),\nThey cling to their cravings and dwell long therein,\nThose who do not know the Dao\nTake this as their *hut of decay*.\n\n乐以声言也，声之所声者彰矣，而声声者未尝发。\nDelight is expressed through sound,\nThe source of sound is clear,\nYet *sound-sound* never truly emits.\n\n饵以味言也，味之所味者尝矣，而味味者未尝呈。\nBait is expressed through flavor,\nThe source of flavor is tasted,\nYet *flavor-flavor* never truly presents.\n\n道之出江，淡乎其无味，则所谓声声味味者也。\nThe Dao’s emergence is like water—\nBland, without flavor,\nThus it is what is called *sound-sound* and *flavor-flavor*.\n\n以道莅天下者，得大道泰而妙，故视之不足见；\nTo govern the world with the Dao,\nOne attains the Great Way’s boundless peace and subtlety,\nThus to look upon it is insufficient to see;\n\n得天道安而玄，故听之不足闻；\nOne attains the Dao/Way of Heaven’s ease and profundity,\nThus to listen is insufficient to hear;\n\n得地道平而广，故用之不可既。\nOne attains the Dao/Way of Earth’s tranquility and vastness,\nThus to use it is never to exhaust.\n\n直将还一世於澹泊，岂使民以嗜欲累其心哉？\nRather, it would return the world to simplicity and stillness,\nHow could it burden the people with cravings?\n\n**将欲歙之，章第三十六**\n**When One is About to Withdraw It—Chapter Thirty-Six**\n\n将欲歙之，必固张之；\nWhen one is about to withdraw it, one must first firmly expand it.\n\n将欲弱之，必固强之；\nWhen one is about to weaken it, one must first firmly strengthen it.\n\n将欲废之，必固兴之；\nWhen one is about to abandon it, one must first firmly establish it.\n\n将欲夺之，必固与之。\nWhen one is about to take it away, one must first firmly give it.\n\n是谓微明。\nThis is called *subtle clarity*.\n\n柔之胜刚，弱之胜强。\nSoftness overcomes hardness,\nWeakness overcomes strength.\n\n鱼不可脱於渊，国之利器，不可以一不人。\nFish cannot be removed from the depths,\nNation’s *sharp tools*—\nThey cannot be used without harm.\n\n利器示人，欲心乱矣。\nTo display *sharp tools* to others,\nThe desire-heart is thrown into disorder.\n\n唯有道者体天道之虚，於吾心本无所张也，何必歙之？\nOnly those who possess the Dao embody the Dao/Way of Heaven’s emptiness,\nIn my heart, there is originally nothing to expand—\nWhy must I withdraw it?\n\n将欲歙之者，必固张之而已。\nWhen one is about to withdraw it,\nOne must first firmly expand it—\nThat is all.\n\n体大道之夷，於吾欲心本无所强也，何必弱之？\nEmbodying the Great Way’s simplicity,\nIn my desire-heart, there is originally nothing to strengthen—\nWhy must I weaken it?\n\n将欲弱之者，必固强之而已。\nWhen one is about to weaken it,\nOne must first firmly strengthen it—\nThat is all.\n\n体王道之正，於吾欲心本无所兴也，何又废之？\nEmbodying the *Kingly Way’s* rectitude,\nIn my desire-heart, there is originally nothing to establish—\nWhy must I abandon it?\n\n将欲废之者，必固兴之而已。\nWhen one is about to abandon it,\nOne must first firmly establish it—\nThat is all.\n\n体地道之静，於吾欲心本无所与也，何必夺之？\nEmbodying the Dao/Way of Earth’s stillness,\nIn my desire-heart, there is originally nothing to give—\nWhy must I take it away?\n\n将欲夺之者，必固与之而已。\nWhen one is about to take it away,\nOne must first firmly give it—\nThat is all.\n\n此四者，皆欲於利器。\nThese four actions all concern the use of *sharp tools*.\n\n利器者地道，故是谓微明。\n*Sharp tools* are the Dao/Way of Earth,\nThus this is called *subtle clarity*.\n\n何则？\nWhy?\n\n柔弱处上，神器也。\nSoftness and weakness dwell above—\nThese are *divine tools*.\n\n刚强居下，利器也。\nHardness and strength dwell below—\nThese are *sharp tools*.\n\n圣人处於柔弱，不以利器动乎心，故以柔胜刚，以弱胜强。\nThe sage dwells in softness and weakness,\nDoes not use *sharp tools* to move the heart,\nThus he overcomes hardness with softness,\nAnd strength with weakness.\n\n胡不知鱼在水中，水在鱼中，人在道中，道在人中，\nHow could one not know?\nFish dwell in water, yet water dwells in fish,\nMan dwells in the Dao, yet the Dao dwells in man,\n\n鱼脱於渊丧乎躯矣，利器示人丧乎道矣。\nFish removed from the depths lose their bodies,\n*Sharp tools* displayed to others lose the Dao.\n\n**道常无为，章第三十七**\n**The Dao is Ever Non-Action—Chapter Thirty-Seven**\n\n道常无为而无不为，侯王若能守，万物将自化。\nThe Dao is ever non-action yet nothing is left undone,\nIf lords and kings could guard it,\nAll things would spontaneously transform.\n\n化而欲作，吾将镇以无名之朴。\nIf transformation is sought yet action is desired,\nI would govern it with the *nameless simplicity*.\n\n无名之朴，亦将不欲。\nThe *nameless simplicity* would also not desire.\n\n不欲以静，天下将自正。\nWithout desire, it would remain still,\nThe world would spontaneously align itself.\n\n常然之道，无为也。\nThe constant Dao is non-action.\n\n天地之道，无为而无不为也。\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth is non-action yet nothing is left undone.\n\n然天地法道，为出於无为，故曰道常无为而无不为。\nYet Heaven and Earth follow the Dao,\nTheir action arises from non-action,\nThus it is said: *The Dao is ever non-action yet nothing is left undone*.\n\n侯王法天地，若能守道以御世，则万物化之，\nLords and kings follow Heaven and Earth,\nIf they could guard the Dao to govern the world,\nThen all things would transform of themselves,\n\n若性之自为而不知为之者，故曰侯王若能守，万物将自化。\nAs if by their own nature they would act without knowing why—\nThus it is said: *If lords and kings could guard the Dao, all things would spontaneously transform*.\n\n夫化而欲作者，将有为而起之也，\nNow, if transformation is sought yet action is desired,\nIt would be to create action through action,\n\n圣人於是镇之以无名之朴，\nThe sage would govern this with the *nameless

things are great.\nVirtue is encompassed by the Dao,\nThe Dao is encompassed by Heaven.\nThe virtue of sages and kings aligns with the Dao of Heaven and Earth,\nYet it remains nameless—\nThe origin of Heaven and Earth,\nWhere the Dao dwells in concealment.\n\nIf one divides the four great things among the lands,\nEach is but its manifest Dao,\nAnd the names imposed upon them are forced.\n\nThe Dao is not inherently a thing to be bestowed,\nYet through Heaven, Earth, and the sages and kings,\nIt embodies the Dao to perfect the world—\nThus the name of bestowal arises,\nAnd the effects of partiality take root.\n\nYet its completion is but natural—\nWho could have a mind to coerce its fulfillment?\n\nThe Dao gives rise to One,\nOne gives rise to Two,\nTwo gives rise to Three,\nThree gives rise to myriad things.\n\nMyriad things draw upon the yin and embrace the yang,\nAnd their harmonizing *qi* is the result of mingling.\nWhat people abhor,\nAre the solitary, the widowed, and the unfilled—\nYet the sages and kings hold them as their ideal.\n\nThus, some things are diminished to be increased,\nAnd increased to be diminished.\n\nWhat people are taught,\nIs also my righteous teaching.\nThe overbearing perish without their proper end—\nI shall take this as my guiding principle.\n\nChangeable yet unified, the origin of One—\nThus it is said, *the Dao gives rise to One*.\nOne is the beginning of form’s transformation,\nThe greatest form within Heaven and Earth—\nThus it is said, *One gives rise to Two*.\nHeaven and Earth establish their positions,\nAnd humanity dwells within—\nThus the Three Powers are complete—\nThus it is said, *Two gives rise to Three*.\nThe light and clear ascend to become Heaven,\nThe heavy and turbid descend to become Earth,\nThe mingling and harmonizing *qi* becomes humanity—\nThen Heaven and Earth contain their essence,\nAnd myriad things are born and transformed—\nThus it is said, *Three gives rise to myriad things*.\nHeaven, as yang, sternly emerges—\nThen the yin ascends to meet the yang,\nAnd things draw upon it.\nEarth, as yin, vibrantly unfolds—\nThen the yang descends to meet the yin,\nAnd things embrace it.\nAs yin and yang rise and fall,\nTheir mutual interaction brings forth\nThe mingling and harmonizing *qi*—\nThus it is said, *myriad things draw upon the yin and embrace the yang,\nAnd their harmonizing qi is the result of mingling*.\n\nWithin a single human body,\nThe likeness of Heaven and Earth is displayed—\nYin, yang, and mingling *qi* are all contained therein,\nYet there is also the most divine\nWho governs it.\n\nJust as the sages and kings align with Heaven and Earth,\nWithin this realm, the greatest is the solitary,\nAnd one who draws upon the *qi* of Great Harmony is unfilled.\nThe people of the world oppose the divine,\nYet they reverse it and call it evil—\nWhile the sages and kings alone take this upon themselves—\nThus it is said, *what people abhor,\nAre the solitary, the widowed, and the unfilled—\nYet the sages and kings hold them as their ideal*.\n\nThe mingling and harmonizing *qi* of yin and yang permeates all things,\nNaturally neither diminishing nor increasing—\nYet through Heaven and Earth’s fullness and emptiness,\nAnd their correspondence with the seasons,\nSometimes it is diminished to be increased,\nAnd increased to be diminished.\n\nWhat people are taught,\nIs also the rectitude of Heaven and Earth—\nI prefer tranquility, yet the people naturally align.\nThis is my righteous teaching—\nThis is called *diminished to be increased*.\nThe overbearing oppose this—\nThus they do not meet their proper end—\nThis is called *increased to be diminished*.\n\nThe sage observes this,\nAnd takes it as a warning—\nThus I shall use it as my guiding principle.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 43: The Most Supreme Softness**\n\nThe most supreme softness in the world,\nRides across the world’s most supreme firmness.\n\nWithout any entry into the boundless,\nIt is known that non-action benefits greatly.\nThe teaching of silent speech,\nThe benefit of non-action—\nFew in the world can attain it.\n\nThe most supreme softness is the spirit.\nThe most supreme firmness is form.\nThe true spirit aligns with the Dao,\nCapable of vanishing and enduring—\nOnly when the spirit governs form,\nCan the spirit make form soar,\nAnd form follow in its boundless course—\nThus it is said, *the most supreme softness in the world,\nRides across the world’s most supreme firmness*.\n\nThe most supreme softness is without substance,\nThe most supreme firmness is without gaps.\nWhen form governs form,\nThere are gaps that form can enter—\nThus the boundless without gaps cannot be entered.\nWhen the spirit governs form,\nThe spirit can permeate without gaps—\nYet it also cannot be entered without attaining its own accord—\nThus it is said, *without any entry into the boundless*.\n\nWhat form transforms,\nIs the teaching of silent speech.\nWhat the spirit attains,\nIs the benefit of non-action.\nIf one can embody the Dao of Heaven and Earth,\nDwell in non-action,\nAnd practice the teaching of silent speech,\nThen one shapes form and aligns with spirit—\nForm and spirit both attain perfection,\nAnd one’s essence merges with the Dao’s truth.\n\nThe world values spoken teaching and favors action,\nThus few can attain this.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 44: Names and Bodies**\n\nBetween names and bodies, which is more intimate?\nBetween bodies and wealth, which is more abundant?\nBetween gain and loss, which causes greater harm?\n\nThus, the more one loves excessively,\nThe greater the cost.\nThe more one hoards,\nThe heavier the loss.\n\nKnowing contentment brings no shame,\nKnowing restraint brings no peril—\nThus one can endure long.\n\nThe noble ponder day and night,\nWorrying over good and evil,\nYet their bodies are also worn thin—\nThus the error of sacrificing body for name—\nHow can one see what is truly intimate,\nWhen it lies in the body, not in the name?\n\nThe wealthy exhaust their bodies with labor,\nAmassing wealth yet unable to use it all—\nTheir bodies are also strained externally—\nThus the error of sacrificing body for profit—\nHow can one see what is truly abundant,\nWhen it lies in the body, not in wealth?\n\nYet honor and disgrace are established,\nAnd one sees what causes harm—\nWealth and goods are gathered,\nAnd one sees what is contested—\nThose who value the manifest as true,\nKnow that names are the source of honor—\nThose who value riches as true,\nKnow that wealth is the source of profit—\nThus they see gain and forget their bodies,\nSee profit and forget their true nature.\n\nThen, between gain and loss,\nWhich truly causes greater harm?\n\nWhat is lost,\nIs the nameless simplicity,\nThe unadorned frame—\nNo greater harm exists than this.\n\nThus, to love names excessively while unaware of restraint,\nThe greater loss will surely be incurred.\nThe greater refers to the Dao’s ideal—\nThe nameless simplicity itself.\n\nTo hoard wealth while unaware of contentment,\nThe heavier loss will surely be incurred.\nThe heavier refers to virtue’s substance—\nThe unadorned frame itself.\n\nOnly the sage embodies the broad virtue,\nKnows contentment without valuing wealth as noble—\nThus they suffer no shame.",

crumbling—\nThus its use is inexhaustible.\n\nIf excess is like piled water,\nIts flow will dry up—\nNot true great excess.\nThe great excess seems hollow,\nNever drying up—\nThus its use is boundless.\n\nThese two are Heaven and Earth’s functions—\nYin and Yang.\n\nHeaven can generate without ceasing,\nYet its generative use is boundless.\nEarth can transform without ceasing,\nYet its transformative use is inexhaustible—\nThus the Dao acts truly within them.\n\nOnly the unified is threefold,\nHence by observing Heaven and Earth, the Dao may be known.\nIf divided, then:\nThe most straight seems bent—\nThis is Earth’s Way.\nEarth’s Way is straight yet restrained,\nThus it seems clumsy.\n\nThe most skillful seems clumsy—\nThis is the Constant Way,\nThe Constant Way carves myriad forms yet does not vie for skill,\nThus it seems clumsy.\n\nThe most eloquent seems tongue-tied—\nThis is Heaven’s Way.\nHeaven’s Way speaks not yet responds well,\nThus it seems tongue-tied.\n\nYet considering their essence,\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast,\nThey do not depart from Yin and Yang,\nAnd one Yin, one Yang—\nThis is the Dao.\nThus accumulated Yang is Heaven,\nAccumulated Yin is Earth.\nYin is still, Yang is restless,\nYang is hot, Yin is cold.\nWhat governs Yin is Yang,\nThus agitation overcomes cold.\nWhat governs Yang is Yin,\nThus stillness overcomes heat.\n\nYet cold departs and heat arrives,\nHeat departs and cold returns—\nHow could their use ever be exhausted or worn out?\n\nThe Dao has clarity and turbidity,\nMovement and stillness.\nClarity is the source of turbidity,\nStillness is the foundation of movement.\nIf one can always remain serene and still,\nHeaven and Earth will all submit—\nWhat of things?\nWhat of affairs?\nThus it is said: Serene stillness is the norm for all under Heaven.\n\n**Chapter 46: When the World Has the Dao**\nWhen the world has the Dao,\nWarhorses are turned to manure.\nWhen the world lacks the Dao,\nWarhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\nNo guilt is greater than desiring what is desirable,\nNo calamity is greater than not knowing contentment,\nNo blame is greater than coveting gain.\nThus, true contentment is ever content.\n\nThose who govern the world with the Dao\nAlways keep the people ignorant and desireless,\nThus each finds peace in their place and does not contend—\nThey merely till their fields.\n\nIn the declining ages, when the Dao cannot be revived,\nThey see what is desirable yet do not know contentment,\nThen arises the heart of coveting gain,\nAnd they begin to seize, plunder, and encroach,\nWhile warhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\nReflecting upon oneself,\nWithin is one’s own world.\nIf the Dao is within oneself,\nOne rests in their measure,\nAnd guards their inch of land with vigor.\nIf the Dao is lost within oneself,\nOne gallops and hunts recklessly,\nAnd the heart runs wild—\nAlready, the inch of land is lost.\n\nThus no guilt is greater than desiring what is desirable,\nNo calamity is greater than not knowing contentment,\nNo blame is greater than coveting gain—\nAll stem from failing to rest in one’s measure.\n\nWhen this is carried to excess,\nContention and plunder follow.\nIf one can return to the measure of life and nature,\nAnd restrain one’s intentions and desires,\nCold and calm in self-cultivation,\nThen sufficiency is found within oneself—\nWhat lack could there be?\nThis is how true contentment is ever content.\n\n**Chapter 47: Not Leaving the Door**\nNot leaving the door,\nYet knowing the world;\nNot peering through the window,\nYet seeing the Dao.\nThe farther one goes,\nThe less one knows.\n\nThus the sage acts not yet knows,\nSees not yet names,\nDoes not act yet achieves.\n\nThe world is the nine regions, mountains, rivers, seas—\nTeeming with ceaseless life.\nThe Dao is the four seasons, Yin and Yang, winds and rains—\nEndless transformation.\n\nReflecting upon oneself,\nNothing is not perfectly formed.\nThus the sage says:\n“I share with Heaven and Earth one breath and govern together.”\nIf one understands this,\nOne need not leave the door or peer through the window\nTo see and know Heaven and Earth’s Dao.\n\nIf one seeks the Dao beyond oneself,\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows—\nHow could one know that within one’s own body,\nTen thousand principles are fully present?\nNearly taking from this,\nNothing is lacking.\n\nThus the sage embodies Earth’s Way,\nWith emptiness as body,\nHence acts not yet knows—\nNo need to leave the door.\nEmbodies Heaven’s Way,\nWith non-action as heart,\nHence sees not yet names—\nNo need to peer through the window.\nEmbodies the Great Dao,\nWith naturalness as constant,\nHence does not act yet achieves—\nNo need to exert wisdom or strength in what is seen or done.\n\n**Chapter 48: Learning and the Dao**\nLearning increases daily,\nThe Dao decreases daily.\nDecrease again, decrease—\nUntil non-action,\nYet nothing remains undone.\n\nThus to take the world,\nOne must act with non-interference.\nWhen action arises,\nIt is insufficient to take the world.\n\nThe scholar seeks to exhaust principles,\nThus daily increase.\nThe Daoist seeks to fulfill nature,\nThus daily decrease.\nDecrease again, decrease—\nUntil fulfilling nature to its end—\nThis is returning to one’s original command.\n\nPrinciples have an end,\nNature has its fulfillment,\nYet still not free from action—\nHence the terms learning and Dao.\nOnly when command is fulfilled\nDoes one return to stillness—\nStillness is called returning to command,\nUntil non-action.\n\nNon-action is the time of perfect stillness,\nYet when moved, it responds and harmonizes with all under Heaven—\nThus non-action yet nothing remains undone.",

weapons.\nThe rhinoceros finds no place to thrust its horn,\nThe tiger finds no place to strike its claws,\nWeapons find no place to lodge their blades.\nWhy is this?\nBecause they dwell in a realm where death has no hold.\n\nAll things arise from the interplay of Heaven and Earth—this is called *birth*,\nAnd return to the transformations of yin and yang—this is called *death*.\nThose who follow birth and death as companions,\nHave not escaped the interplay of Heaven and Earth,\nNor have they avoided the transformations of yin and yang.\nYet, when all things move through birth and death,\nIt is said that only *human* life is driven to death’s domain—why?\nThis is all by the people’s own doing,\nNot Heaven and Earth’s destruction,\nNor the harm of spirits and gods—\nBecause they possess *knowing* and their forms are restless.\n\nThe eyes see life’s approach and cannot repel it,\nDeath’s departure and cannot halt it—why?\nBecause life’s vitality is excessive,\nAnd they are driven to death’s domain.\n\nOnly the Sage cherishes the subtle and profound,\nEmbraces the pure and unadorned,\nAnd dares not contend with the world in action.\nThough fierce beasts exist, they cannot seize him,\nThough weapons strike, they cannot harm him.\nHis accumulated virtue is deeply resonant,\nNo thing can wound him—\nThus, he dwells in a realm where death has no hold.\n\n**Chapter 51: The Dao Nurtures Life**\nThe Dao *nurtures* life,\nVirtue *nurtures* it,\nThings take their form,\nCircumstances bring them to fruition.\nThus, all things revere the Dao and honor virtue.\nThe Dao’s reverence,\nVirtue’s honor—\nNo titles bestow them, yet they endure naturally.\n\nHence, the Dao *nurtures*, *nurtures* it,\n*Lengthens*, *cultivates* it,\n*Completes*, *ripening* it,\n*Nourishes*, *protecting* it.\nIt gives birth without possession,\nActs without reliance,\nLengthens without domination—\nThis is called the *profound virtue*.\n\nFrom whence does the Dao nurture life?\nIt *nurtures* the harmonious *true qi* of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd all things arise from it—\nThis is how the Dao nurtures life,\nHence it is said: *The Dao nurtures life, virtue nurtures it*.\n\nFrom whence do things take form?\nFollowing the ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd the grasp of yin and yang—\nAll things are formed from it—\nThis is how things take form,\nHence it is said: *Things take their form, circumstances bring them to fruition*.\n\nBecause the Dao can nurture,\nAll things bow to it—\nThis is called *revering the Dao*.\nBecause virtue can *nurture*,\nAll things cannot *demean* it—\nThis is called *honoring virtue*.\n\nOnly the Dao and virtue reside in the accumulation of yang,\nNot seeking reverence or honor from things—\nThings themselves revere and honor them,\nFor from ancient times to the present,\nNo titles bestow them, yet they endure naturally.\n\nHence, the Dao *nurtures*, *nurtures* it,\n*Lengthens*, *cultivates* it,\n*Completes*, *ripening* it,\n*Nourishes*, *protecting* it—\nThis is the Dao operating between Heaven and Earth,\nAnd enduring naturally.\n\nIf one *nurtures* life without possession,\nActs without reliance,\nLengthens without domination,\nThen it aligns with the harmony of Heaven and Earth—\nThis is called the *profound virtue*.\n\n**Chapter 52: The Origin of the World**\nThe world has an origin,\nWhich we call the *Mother of the world*.\nHaving obtained its Mother,\nWe come to know her children,\nHaving known her children,\nWe return to guard its Mother—\nAnd thus, our life remains unharmed.\n\nSeal its *mouth* (兑),\nClose its *gate* (门),\nAnd we toil not our whole lives.\nOpen its *mouth*,\nAdvance its *affairs*,\nAnd we are never saved our whole lives.\n\nSeeing the small as *illumination*,\nGuarding the soft as *strength*—\nUsing its *radiance*,\nAnd returning to its *illumination*,\nWe suffer no calamity—\nThis is called *following the constant*.\n\nFirst, there is the unity of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd then the world has an origin—\nThus, it is called the *Mother of the world*.\nHaving obtained Heaven and Earth,\nAs the *Mother of the world*,\nWe know that all things are her children.\n\nHaving known her children,\nAnd returning to guard the Mother’s Dao,\nThen her children are whole.\nIndeed, people only know Heaven and Earth and all things,\nYet do not know their own source of birth.\nIf one knows this,\nAnd returns to guard the Dao of Heaven and Earth,\nThen one’s life remains unharmed.\n\nThus, those who embody the Dao of Heaven and Earth,\nEngage in *non-action*,\nFollow the *teaching of silence*—\nHence it is said: *Seal its mouth, close its gate,*\n*And we toil not our whole lives*.\n\nThose who do not know the Dao,\nSpeak much and act—\nFollowing affairs and losing the Mother’s Dao,\nHence it is said: *Open its mouth, advance its affairs,*\n*And we are never saved our whole lives*.\n\nThe small is the *unadorned* of Heaven and Earth,\nThe soft is the *profound application* of the Dao—\nOnly by self-knowing do we see the Dao of Heaven and Earth,\nHence it is said: *illumination*.\nOnly by self-mastering do we guard the Dao’s subtlety,\nHence it is said: *strength*.\n\n*Illumination* is the union of yin and yang in speech,\n*Radiance* emerges from *illumination*—\nUsing *non-action*,\nWithin oneself, it becomes wisdom and intent.\nThe Sage discards wisdom and intent,\nNot forcing but illuminating the Dao of Heaven—\nThus, he uses its *radiance*,\nAnd returns to its *illumination*.\n\n*Radiance* wasted outward is called *suffering calamity*,\nNot wasting *radiance* and returning to *illumination*—\nThis is called *following the constant*.\n\nOnly thus can one guard the Mother’s Dao.\n\n**Chapter 53: Let Me Explain Clearly**\nIf I were to explain clearly,\nAnd walk the *Great Dao*,\nI would only fear *excessive action*.\n\nThe *Great Dao* is most smooth,\nYet people love shortcuts.\nMorning is neglected,\nFields grow overgrown,\nGranaries are emptied,\nGarments adorned with fine colors,\nBelts bearing sharp blades,\nSated with delicacies,\nWealth overflowing—\nThis is called *robber’s pride*,\nNot the Dao, is it?\n\nThe streams of mountain paths,\nIf used excessively, become thoroughfares,\nIf not used, are choked with weeds.\nThe people of the world do not know the *Great Dao’s* subtlety,\nYet engage in excessive action—\nThis is how they block their own hearts.\n\nThe stirring of *nature* is called *action*,\nThe artificiality of *action* is called *loss*—\nThus, those who know fear and do not dare act.\n\nThe *Great Dao* is most smooth,\nYet when viewed, it is unseen—\nThe heart desires swiftness,\nThus, people love shortcuts and forever stray from the *Great Dao*.\n\nMoreover, the heart is the sovereign’s *minister*—\nIf the heart is restless,\nThen even a single *inch of field* is lost,\nAnd if a single *inch of field* is lost,\nThen the harmonious *qi* does not descend,\nAnd if the harmonious *qi* does not descend,\nThen the *Great Granary* is emptied—\nHence it is said: *Morning is neglected, fields grow overgrown,*\n*The granaries are emptied*.\n\nBecause of this,\nThere are distinctions in rank,\nThere are contests of seizing,\nThere is the enjoyment of the five flavors—\nThus, fine garments and adornments,\nBelts bearing sharp blades,\nSated with delicacies—\nAnd if wealth overflows,\nThen all its harms are gathered at their root.»",

simplicity.\n\n然既立政为正，\nYet if governance is established as rectitude—\n必有以察为奇，\nThere must be *scrutiny as the strange*—\n故始於闷闷而终於察察。\nThus it begins with *obscure yet profound* governance and ends with *explicit and scrutinizing* governance.\n\n终於察察，政之极也。\nEnding with *explicit and scrutinizing* governance is the extreme of governance.\n\n其政太察，\nIf governance is too scrutinizing—\n使民无所措手足，\nThe people have no place to set their hands and feet—\n故其民缺缺焉。\nThus its people become *cunning and deceitful*.\n\n圣人言但知求福，\nThe *Sage* says: *Only knowing to seek blessing*—\n不知罪婴，\n*Unknowing of the

*gathering*;\nTo speak internally, it is *nurturing*.\nWhen gathering externally, one reaches *no desire* (wùyù),\nThus one retreats from the body, abandons the body—\nThis is how one governs people.\n\nWhen nurturing internally, one reaches *no knowing* (wùzhī),\nThus one preserves the heart, nourishes the nature—\nThis is how one serves Heaven.\n\nExternally, with no desire, one follows the Earth’s stillness\nAnd thus fulfills one’s nature.\nInternally, with no knowing, one embodies Heaven’s function\nAnd attains *return to the primal command* (fùmìng).\n\nTo fulfill one’s nature and attain *return to the primal command*\nIs to *retain one’s primal source* (fǔmǔ),\nThus it is called *early return* (zǎofù).\n\n*Early* refers to the sun’s ascent at the beginning of Jia-Yang.\nTo retain one’s primal source\nIs to harmonize with Heaven and Earth in virtue/power (dé),\nThis is called *repeatedly accumulating virtue/power* (chóngjīdé).\n\nAccumulating virtue/power in profound unity,\nMerging with the Dao in its truth,\nThus nothing is unconquered.\n\nMerging with the Dao in its truth—\nDifficult to exhaust, difficult to fathom,\nThus no one knows its limits.\n\nDifficult to exhaust, yet when weak, all principles are complete—\nThus one can have a state.\n\n*The foundation of having a state* (yǒuguó zhī mǔ)\nIs this: neither square nor round,\nParallel with Heaven and Earth—\nThus it can endure long.\n\nThus to retain the source (mǔ)\nIs to *deeply root* (shēn gēn),\nTo *firmly stem* (gùdì) in *return to the primal command* (fùmìng).\nTo obtain Heaven and Earth as constants\nAnd the Five Phases not clashing,\nTo merge with the Great Dao as one\nAnd the Three Lights without obscurity—\nThis is called the *Dao/Way of longevity and lasting vision* (chángshēng jiǔshì zhī dào).\n\n---\n**Chapter Sixty: Governing Great States**\n\nTo govern a great state, treat it like cooking a small fish.\nTo rule the world with the Dao,\nIts spirits are not numinous.\n\nNot that its spirits are not numinous—\nBut its numinous does not harm the people;\nNot that its numinous does not harm the people—\nThe Sage also does not harm the people.\n\nWhen both do not harm each other,\nVirtue/power (dé) returns and exchanges.\n\nThe Dao of governance values stillness and quietude—\nThe people then regulate themselves.\nDo not act artificially—\nThus, to govern a great state is like cooking a small fish.\n\nSpeaking of people,\nA great state is the central realm of Yellow Emperor’s land—\nAnd this is how it is governed.\n\nThus the Sage dwells in *non-action* (wúwéi),\nWith a single mind steadfast—\nAnd rules the world.\nHence, spirits have no place to manifest their numinous resonance,\nDepending on humans to act—\nWhat numinous power could there be?\n\nNot that its spirits are not numinous—\nFor it does not receive evil,\nAnd evil qi departs on its own—\nThus the numinous does not harm people.\n\nNot that its numinous does not harm people—\nFor the Sage dwells in *non-action*,\nAnd the world transforms naturally.\nThus, externally, there are no calamities of contention, robbery, or war;\nInternally, there are no schemes of murder or grudges.\nNot transgressing the spirits’ retribution—\nThus the Sage also does not harm people.\n\nWhen humans and spirits both do not harm each other,\nThe spirits bestow blessings—\nGranting you abundant fortune and returning virtue/power to the spirits.\nThe people are sincere—\nDaily nourished with food and drink,\nAnd virtue/power returns to humans.\n\nVirtue/power returns to the spirits,\nThus descendants continue sacrifices without ceasing.\nVirtue/power returns to humans,\nThus the world joyfully promotes it without tiring.\n\nThis is the effect of the Sage ruling the world with the Dao.\n\n---\n**Chapter Sixty-One: Great States as the Lowly Flow**\n\nA great state is the lowly flow,\nThe convergence of the world,\nThe world’s *yin*—\nFor *yin* always overcomes *yang* through stillness,\nAnd stillness is *lowly*.\n\nThus, when a great state is lowly to a small state, it takes the small state;\nWhen a small state is lowly to a great state, it takes the great state.\nThus, sometimes lowly to take,\nSometimes lowly and taken.\n\nA great state seeks only to *nurture all* (jiānrú rén);\nA small state seeks only to *enter and serve* (rùshì rén).\nBoth obtain what they desire—\nThus the great should properly be lowly.\n\nWater excels in being lowly—\nThus rivers and seas become kings of all valleys.\nA great state desires to *nurture all*—\nAlso through its lowly flow alone.\nThus it is said: *A great state is the lowly flow.*\n\nThe world converges, all things are born;\nHuman paths converge, achievements are completed—\nThis is called the world’s convergence.\nYet it must first dwell in gentleness and stillness—\nFor *yin* always overcomes *yang* through stillness,\nAnd *yang* submits to it—\nThus stillness is lowly.\n\nStillness means no affairs—\nOnly through no affairs can one take the world,\nMuch less a state.\nThus, when a great state is lowly to a small state, it takes the small state;\nWhen a small state is lowly to a great state, it takes the great state.\n\nSometimes lowly to take—this is the *Way of the Sovereign*.\nSometimes lowly and taken—this is the *Way of the Minister*.\n\nThe Sovereign is like Heaven—\nHeaven’s *Way* is lowly yet nourishing, bright and clear,\nThus a great state seeks only to *nurture all*.\nThe Minister is like Earth—\nEarth’s *Way* is lowly yet ascending,\nThus a small state seeks only to *enter and serve*.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth converge, all things are born;\nWhen human paths converge, achievements are completed—\nBoth obtain what they desire.\nYet only the great should properly be lowly—\nThus it is again said: *The great should be lowly.*\n\n---\n**Chapter Sixty-Two: The Dao as the Mystery of All Things**\n\nThe Dao is the mystery of all

establishing a Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Ministers,\nEven with a jade tablet and four horses offered first,\nIt is not as good as sitting and presenting this Dao.\n\nWhy did the ancients value this Dao so?\nWas it not to *seek and obtain*?\nOr to *have guilt and fear*?\nThus it is valued for the world.\n\nThe Dao is the abyss of emptiness—\nPeople see things but do not see the Dao,\nThus the Dao is the mystery of all things.\n\nTo grasp the Dao’s subtlety is to be virtuous—\nThis is called the treasure of *nature and life* (xìngmìng).\nTo speak of the Dao falsely is unvirtuous—\nYet one still finds refuge in it.\n\n*Market* refers to where the multitude gathers.\n*Add* refers to placing oneself above the multitude.\nFine words and noble conduct—\nEven the

this Dao in such esteem?\nWas it not because the treasure of *nature and life* (xìngmìng) can be sought and obtained,\nwhile the refuge of what is born is merely to escape guilt and fear?\n\nThus, this Dao is valued for the world.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Three: On *Non-Action* (wúwéi) and *Non-Affairs* (wúshì)**\n\nTo practice *Non-Action* (wúwéi),\nto engage in *Non-Affairs* (wúshì),\nto find

(wúwèi).\n\nFrom the perspective of what is appropriate,\nit seems there is *Action* (yǒuwéi), *Affairs* (yǒushì), and *Taste* (yǒuwèi).\nFrom the perspective of what is upheld,\nthen *Non-Action* (wúwéi) is *Action* (yǒuwéi),\n*Non-Affairs* (wúshì) is *Affairs* (yǒushì),\nand *Non-Taste* (wúwèi) is merely *Taste* (yǒuwèi).\n\nThe people of the world do not understand this,\nso they act boldly

perspective,\nthe world’s difficult tasks arise from ease and become difficult,\nthe world’s great affairs arise from small beginnings and become great—\nthus, calamities emerge from the

      "translated_text": "「This pair of principles is also the standard and model that can be emulated and followed. To know the standard and model, one can then observe the Way of Heaven, hence it is called *Mysterious Virtue* (Xuán Dé). *Mysterious Virtue* is the highest virtue, hence it is profound and vast. Nothing can find its equal in things, but only align with the great order. Thus, it opposes all things, and only then does it reach the great order.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Six: The King of All Valleys (Jiānghǎi)**\nThe reason the rivers and seas can become the king of all valleys is that they excel in yielding. Therefore, they can be the king of all valleys. Hence, the sage who desires to be above others does so by speaking from below, and who desires to lead others does so by placing himself behind them. Thus, the sage, though in the highest position, is not burdensome to the people; though in the lead, he does not harm them. Therefore, the world rejoices in pushing them forward without tiring.\n\nBecause he does not contend, none under Heaven can contend with him.\nThe rivers and seas, by their excellence in yielding, gather the flow of all valleys and become their king. The term *king* (wáng) carries the meaning of returning and going, hence one who holds high rank but yields to the lowly, and greatness but serves the vast, gains the people’s loyalty. Therefore, the sage embodies the Way of Heaven by speaking from below, and though in the highest position, the people do not burden him—thus, those who follow him find it effortless. He embodies the Way of Earth by placing himself behind, and though in the lead, he does not harm the people—thus, those who benefit from him are many. If this is so, then from the west and east, from the south and north, none will fail to submit without thought. Therefore, the world rejoices in pushing them forward without tiring.\n\nIn essence, it is nothing more than excellence in yielding.\nOnly those who excel in yielding do not contend with things, hence none under Heaven can contend with them.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Seven: The World’s Saying**\nThe world says of my Dao: *\"It seems like the unworthy, yet how great it is!\"*\nOnly because it is great does it seem like the unworthy.\nIf it seemed like the worthy for long, it would be trifling.\nI have three treasures, treasures that I hold fast.\nThe first is *compassion* (cí), the second is *frugality* (jiǎn), the third is *not daring to be first under Heaven* (bù gǎn wéi tiānxià xiān).\n\n*Compassion* makes one courageous;\n*frugality* makes one broad;\n*Not daring to be first under Heaven* makes one a vessel of enduring greatness.\nNow, if one abandons *compassion* yet seeks courage,\nabandons *frugality* yet seeks breadth,\nabandons *placing oneself behind* yet seeks to be first—\nthen one dies.\n\n*Compassion*, when waging war, ensures victory;\nwhen defending, ensures steadfastness.\nHeaven, intending to save, uses *compassion* to shield them.\nThe worthy seem small, while the unworthy seem great.\nThe Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth, filling the six extremes, vast beyond measure—\nthus, it seems like the unworthy.\nHeaven is great, Earth is great, and they merely emulate the Dao—\nthus, they can endure.\n\nYet Heaven and Earth are but a minute thing within the void—\ntheir relation to the Dao is also minute.\n\nTherefore, I hold fast to my three treasures.\nThe first is *compassion*—the Way of the Father, the origin of creation, speaking of Heaven.\nThe second is *frugality*—the Way of the Mother, the guardian of accumulation, speaking of Earth.\nThe third is *not daring to be first under Heaven*—the origin of Heaven and Earth, responding only after being moved, never acting before things, speaking of the Dao.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth combine and employ the Dao,\nit is serene and boundless, and all beauties arise from it.\nNo treasures surpass these three.\n\nAll people possess these;\none should treasure them and not lose them,\nholding them as the highest.\n\nThe Way of Heaven gives life and covers it—\nthis is called *compassion*.\nThough compassionate, it does not contend yet triumphs—\nthis is why *compassion* makes one courageous.\n\nThe Way of Earth nurtures and accumulates—\nthis is called *frugality*.\nThough frugal, its virtue aligns with the boundless—\nthis is why *frugality* makes one broad.\n\nOnly the great Dao encompasses the origins of Heaven and Earth;\nthough one does not dare to be first under Heaven,\nlife and transformation depend on it to stand—\nthis is why one can become a vessel of enduring greatness.\nIf one opposes Heaven and Earth and abandons the great Dao,\nthen one dies.\n\n*Compassion* ensures victory in war\nbecause it battles the yielding with the assertive.\nIt ensures steadfastness in defense\nby embracing the *Mysterious Way*.\nMoreover, when one battles disorder with order,\nwaiting for the time to move—\nthen he is supported and wins.\nIf one cannot move, he defends with order,\nand Heaven’s timing also shields and steadies him—\nthus, Heaven intends to save, using *compassion* to guard them.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Eight: The Art of the Gentle Scholar**\nThe gentle scholar excels not in force,\nthe skilled warrior does not rage,\nthe victor over foes does not contend,\nthe master of men places himself beneath them.\n\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nthis is called the power of employing men,\nthis is called harmonizing with Heaven—\nthe ancient ultimate.\n\nThe gentle scholar cherishes the Way of the three treasures,\nnot using arms to coerce the world but employing force.\nTo wage war against others is to be skilled in war,\nto overcome foes is to be skilled in victory,\nto employ men is to be skilled in governance.\n\nThe skilled warrior waits for the time before moving;\nthough he wages war, he does not rage—\nembodying the treasure of *compassion*.\n\nThe skilled victor considers victory before meeting;\nthough he prevails, he does not contend—\nembodying the treasure of *frugality*.\n\nThe master of men does not scheme for himself,\nbut delights in employing others—\nthus, men gladly serve him,\nembodying the treasure of *not daring to be first under Heaven*.\n\nIf one excels in these,\nthen it is called the virtue of non-contention,\nthe power of employing men,\nand harmonizing with Heaven.\n\nYet the ancient *orthodox* (zhèng) became *unconventional* (qí),\nthus arose the warning of using arms—\nhence it is said: the ancient ultimate.\n\nWho knows its ultimate?\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Nine: The Sayings of Using Arms**\nThe sayings of using arms are:\n*\"I do not dare to be the host but become the guest,\nnor dare to advance an inch while retreating a foot.\"*\n\nThis is called *having no path but to

taking delight in killing as one’s purpose—\nthus, one does not dare to advance an inch while retreating a foot,\nand so it is called *having no path but to follow* (xíng wú xíng).\n*Repelling without arms* (rǎng wú bì) means to wage war skillfully yet without anger.\n*Returning without foes* (réng wú dí) means to vanquish the enemy well yet without contention.\n*Grasping without weapons* (zhí wú bīng) means to employ others skillfully yet place oneself beneath them.\nThis is the profound understanding of the **Three Treasures’ Dao** (sān bǎo zhī dào).\n\nYet the **Three Treasures** (sān bǎo) are not solely for discussing war—\nhow is it that the ancient extreme (jí) has come to this point of using arms?\nArms are cruel instruments; one must not underestimate the enemy,\nfor underestimating the enemy is to delight in killing.\nAbandoning one’s **virtue of compassion** (cí) and **courage** (yǒng),\nand taking up **frugality** (jiǎn) yet **broad ambition** (guǎng),\nor **following others** (hòu) yet **placing oneself first** (xiān),\nthus nearly forfeiting my treasures.\nTherefore, when armies clash in confrontation,\nthose who are **compassionate and merciful** (āi lián) are virtuous (cí).\nIf one takes **virtue** (cí) as one’s treasure,\nthen there will be no calamity of underestimating the enemy,\nand so one will prevail.\n\n**The Sayings of Using Arms Are Very Easy to Know — Chapter 70**\nMy sayings are very easy to know,\nvery easy to practice—\nyet none under heaven can know them,\nnone can practice them.\nWords have a **root** (zōng),\naffairs have a **master** (jūn).\nOnly because of **lack of knowing** (wú zhī),\nthey do not know me.\nFew know me,\nso those who follow me are noble.\nThus the sage wears coarse robes yet holds precious jade (bèi huái).\nWith **no thought and no concern** (wú sī wú lǜ), one begins to know the Dao—\nthis is why it is easy to know.\nWith **no following and no teaching** (wú cóng wú dào), one begins to attain the Dao—\nthis is why it is easy to practice.\nYet the wealthy and noble of the world squander their desires and lose their true nature (zāng yù yǐ sàng zhēn),\nwhile the poor and lowly labor excessively and harm their lives (láo yì yǐ shāng shēng),\nall losing themselves to things,\nand their nature to customs—\nthus none can know, none can practice.\n\nWords have a root—\nto clarify the meaning of a chapter,\nand establish its **principle** (tǒng) as its root—\nis this not what is called easy to know?\nAffairs have a master—\nto clarify the practice of a chapter,\nand establish its **authority** (zhǔ) as its master—\nis this not what is called easy to practice?\nIf one does not lose its root and master,\nhow could one not know or not practice?\nThus the sage says:\nIf you follow my Dao,\nyou should know the **Supreme Enlightenment’s Source** (shàng huì yuán),\nfor wisdom (zhì) is not born alone—\nall must respond to their causes (yīn).\nIf you lack the **practice of the Host’s Original Nature** (wú xíng sù běn),\nthis is called lack of knowing—\nhow could you clarify the **Mysterious and Profound Dao of the Supreme One** (tài shàng xuán miào zhī lǐ)?\nThis is why they do not know me.\nThere are those who know without words,\nwho see what others do not—\nand those who attain without learning,\nwho perceive what others do not—\nthus those who know the Dao are few,\nproving that those who truly see are noble.\nHence the sage appears **thin in externals yet rich in internals** (bó yú wài ér hòu yú nèi),\ndoes not flaunt himself before others,\nand holds the **jewel of Kunshan Mountain** (kuī shān zhī yù) yet remains unknown.\n\n**The Sayings of Knowing and Not Knowing — Chapter 70**\nTo know what one does not know—\nthis is **exalted** (shàng).\nTo not know what one knows—\nthis is **illness** (bìng).\nOnly because one **diseases the illness** (bìng bìng),\none does not fall ill.\nThe sage’s non-illness comes from his disease of the illness—\nthus he does not fall ill.\nThe Dao is originally **without knowing** (wú zhī),\nyet through **no thought and no concern** (wú sī wú lǜ), one knows it—\nthus it is called *knowing what one does not know*—\nthis is called **true knowing** (zhēn zhī).\nTo not know the Dao of *not knowing what one does not know*,\nyet to **clearly** (zhāo) **discuss profound and subtle theories** (gāo tán miào lùn)\nto **exhaust the principles and penetrate the roots** (jīu běn qióng yuán),\nthis is called **illness of knowing** (bìng zhī).\nOnly those who know that **knowing is an illness** (zhī zhī bìng wéi bìng)\nand **forget their knowing** (ér wàng qí zhī),\nthus do not fall ill.\nHow is it that the sage does not fall ill?\nBecause he knows that **knowing is an illness**,\nyet always acts as if he does not know—\nthus he does not fall ill.\n\n**The Sayings of the People Not Fearing the Way — Chapter 72**\nIf the people do not fear the **Way’s威** (wēi),\nthen the **great威** (dà wēi) will arrive.\nDo not **narrow their dwelling** (xiá qí suǒ jū),\ndo not **exhaust their life** (yàn qí suǒ shēng).\nOnly because of **non-exhaustion** (bù yàn),\none does not exhaust.\nThus the sage **knows himself yet does not reveal himself** (zì zhī bù zì xiàn),\n**loves himself yet does not honor himself** (zì ài bù zì guì)—\nthus he abandons that and takes this.\n\nAnger and **威** (wēi) are small,\nnon-anger and **威** are great.\nThe sage does not bend the world with his **威**,\nbut makes the people **not fear the容 of威** (wēi zhī róng),\nwhile having **the heart to fear virtue** (dé zhī xīn)—\nthen the **威 of non-anger** (bù nù zhī wēi) silently prevails over them—\nthis is called the **great威 arriving**.\n\nTo **transform the people** (huà mín) so they attain their nature (xìng) fully,\nthen to **expand and fulfill them** (kuò ér chōng zhī),\ntheir dwelling will not be narrow—\nto **nurture and complete them** (yù ér chéng zhī),\ntheir life will not be exhausted—\nthis is how the sage embodies the **Dao of Heaven and Earth** (tiān dì dào).\n\nEmbodying **Heaven’s great威** (tiān dà wēi) yet not angering,\nembodying **Earth’s broad dwelling** (dì guǎng jū) yet not narrowing,\nembodying **the Dao’s perpetual generation** (dào shēng shēng) yet not exhausting.\nOnly the **Supreme One** (shàng) does not exhaust the people’s life—\nthus the people attain their nature fully and are not exhausted,\nand so the sage does not reveal himself yet is clear.\nOnly through **clarity** (míng) does one know oneself and embody Heaven and Earth,\nand so not honor oneself yet is virtuous (dé).\nOnly through **virtue** (dé) does one love oneself and follow the **great Dao** (dà dào),\nthus abandoning self-revelation and self-honoring,\nand taking this embodiment of the **Dao of Heaven and Earth**.\n\n**The Sayings of Courage in Daring and Not Daring — Chapter 73**\nCourage in daring leads to **death** (shā),\ncourage in not daring leads to **life** (huó).\nThese two paths—\none beneficial, one harmful—\nare what Heaven detests—\nwho knows their reason?\nThus the sage finds them difficult.\nThe Dao of Heaven is:\nto **prevail without contention** (bù zhēng ér shàn shèng),\nto **respond without words** (bù yán ér shàn yìng),\nto **call without summoning** (bù zhào ér zì lái),\nto **be plain yet skillful in plotting** (tǎn rán ér shàn móu).\n**Heaven’s net is vast and open** (tiān wǎng huī huī),\n**sparse yet never losing** (shū ér bù shī).\n\nTo be **courageous in daring** (yǒng yú gǎn) and place oneself before the world—\nthis is called **contrary to Heaven’s Dao** (nì tiān dào),\nand so one dies.\nTo be **courageous in not daring** (yǒng yú bù gǎn) and not place oneself before the world—\nthis is called **embodying Heaven’s Dao** (tǐ tiān dào),\nand so one lives.\nYet courage in not daring is beneficial to life yet harmful to customs,\nwhile courage in daring is beneficial to customs yet harmful to life—\nin the eyes of the world, this cannot be doubted,\nand so they are confused.\nIf Heaven detests it,\nwho can truly know its reason?\n\nMoreover, Heaven’s Dao **diminishes excess and benefits humility** (kuī yíng ér yì qiān),\nso those who follow Heaven endure,\nwhile those who go against Heaven perish—\nthus the sage finds them difficult and does not dare to act.\n\nHeaven’s Dao originally has no purpose—\nwhen all things
