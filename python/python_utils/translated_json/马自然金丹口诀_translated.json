Dynasty*\n**Source:** *Canon of the Orthodox Daoist Treasury (正统道藏)*, *Taiping Section (太平部)*\n\n---\n\n**Verses of the Golden Elixir of the Natural Way (马自然金丹口诀):**\n\nThe Golden Elixir of the Natural Way lies within all,\nYet few know how to nurture life for years to come.\nDo not boast to others of your myriad powers,\nWithout a true teacher, your efforts will be vain.\n\nI’ve bowed to countless Daoists in my time,\nYet they only speak of *xinggong* (行功) and swallowing saliva,\nOf massage and *daoyin* (導引), of fasting and empty seated meditation.\nThey know nothing of the true *huǒhòu* (火候) and its secrets,\nAnd spend their nights in labor, all for naught.\n\nShaking and swaying bones till the third watch,\nTill sweat pours like water from every pore.\nFor thirty years I wandered the seas,\nNow homeless, with no place to rest my head.\nI sought teachers and the Dao’s profound methods,\nYet all they taught was the cultivation of *zhēnqì* (真氣).\n\nBoth life and death bring equal worry,\nAs they do for all beneath the heavens.\nSixty-four years passed in idle rest,\nUntil I met *Hǎimán* (海蟾) as my disciple.\nHe whispered one sentence in my ear,\nLike drinking from the *Bodhi* (菩提) tree and *Gānlù* (甘露) nectar.\n\nThe *Xuánwēi* (玄微) elixir’s secret is few words,\nYet those who pass by fail to see its truth.\nWithin the body, sixteen *liǎng* (兩) of Golden Elixir reside,\nNurtured in the *Kūn* (坤) region of the southwest.\n\nWho knows this very substance is the *Huándān* (還丹)?\nIt thrives in the *Níhuán Gōng* (泥丸宮) of the self.\n\nNow I recognize the Elixir of the Natural Way,\nNot sought outside the body, but within its depths.\nNightly indulgence in food and drink is no virtue,\nFeasting on abundance brings no benefit.\n\nThey say to begin as if struck by the Five *Zhu* (疒),\nI laughed and told them, “This is no path!”\nAll these teachings are but childish tricks,\nOften leading seekers astray in the world.\n\nIs it not the Way beyond the body?\nTo still the mind and gather the spirit.\nIf the *yuánshén* (元神) does not disperse,\nThe treasure of life will naturally endure.\n\nThe two parents must be paired like the *yùlú* (玉炉) incense,\nFor *Zàohuà* (造化) knows no distinction—it follows its own law.\n\nThe cultivator must unite the Three *Tóng* (同) in one chamber,\nRelying on the Three *Yǔn* (田) of the clouds and rains.\nBlood is the *shā* (沙) water of the southern field,\nWhile *jīng* (精) and *sǎn* (散) mingle like *yǐndǐ* (銀底) lead.\n\nThis is the supreme law of the *Dàluó Tiān* (大羅天),\nGranting those who understand it the form of immortals.\n\nThe Great Dao is profound, and those who meet it are rare,\nThe enlightened do not casually reveal its mysteries.\nYet if you still doubt this wondrous method,\nLook to the garden’s *dù* (杜) wood grafted onto the pear.\n\nThe *dù* (杜) wood becomes the vessel for the pear’s fruit,\nBoth share the same root nature, transforming their essence.\nBefore you lie three paths,\nAnd every person holds the ladder to the heavens.\n\nPressing sand to seek oil is commonplace,\nDrilling water to extract fire is no hardship.\nYet the fire that births the lotus is but a minor feat,\nWhile the true *zhèngfǎ* (正法) of *Cízūn* (慈尊) is rare to encounter.\n\nThe first merit of the Nine *Zhuǎn* (轉) Golden Elixir:\nWhen the method is grasped, the shell is cast off, and one escapes the mundane world.\nAll will say, “You’ve attained it!”\nYour body glows, youth restored, as if reborn.\n\nThe Nine *Zhuǎn* (轉) Elixir is known only to the self,\nBright within, dark without—aligned with the Dao’s will.\nAbove and below like a Golden Realm,\nYin and Yang blend, and the path becomes clear.\n\nNo need to wear the *zān guān* (簪冠) or shave the head,\nHide the Way in the world like a white ox.\nEven in the *ān* (庵) of ordinary life, the path to longevity exists,\nWhy chase the *xiāoyáo* (逍遥) of the White Jade Tower?\n\nDaoism and Buddhism both arise from the mundane root,\nYet forcefully wear the *zān guān* (簪冠) and shave the head.\nAll emerge with rough, outward forms,\nNone seek the true essence within.\n\nLead (*qiān* 鉛) and Mercury (*gōng* 汞) dwell in the crucible,\nRefined into priceless pearls.\nTwo characters suffice,\nTo exhaust all the myriad scriptures.\n\nThere are red, white, and green elixirs,\nYet few discern their distinctions.\nAll fail to recognize their original source,\nLost in confusion, straying from the path.\n\nOne comes unknowing, the other departs in ignorance,\nWasting time by asking others for guidance.\nWhile the world’s treasure lies within reach,\nThey abandon both essence and benefit.\n\nTo grasp the One is to complete all things,\nTo send the Two to their proper places.\nTo know the Three without further inquiry,\nTo leap free from the dust of the world.\n\nThe method of refining *chìjīn* (赤金) is clear,\nThe *pútí zǐ* (菩提子) is gathered.\nThe *kūnlún fēng* (昆仑风) is harnessed,\nAnd longevity knows no end.\n\nThe Nine *Zhuǎn* (轉) Golden Elixir transcends years,\nThe immortal teacher reveals it to the world.\nTo the heavens, I once took a grand vow,\nThat stepping beyond the mundane is to become an immortal.\n\n**The Golden Elixir Verses of Master Ma conclude.**",
