  "full_translation": "**The Authentic Complete Edition of *Neigong Zhenjing* (True Classic of Internal Cultivation)**\n*Annotated by Wang Nanxi, Collated by Zong Jingfang*\n\n*The Four Classics of Internal Cultivation* (*Neigong Sijing*), as a specialized treatise on the practice of internal martial arts, has garnered significant attention among martial circles due to the fervent advocacy of Song Shirong, a master of Xingyi Quan. However, the various editions of *The Four Classics* currently in circulation have been subject to additions and omissions, lacking systematic coherence, thereby hindering later scholars from grasping its full essence. The \"Original Transmission Martial Arts Dissemination Center\" in Handan, Hebei, has generously made public its held authentic handwritten copy of *The Four Classics of Internal Cultivation*, hoping to aid readers in gaining a comprehensive and objective understanding of this martial arts text.\n\nThe original manuscript comprises over forty thousand characters. The table of contents at the beginning outlines the following structure:\n- **Volume One**: *Neigong Jing* (Classic of Internal Cultivation)\n- **Volume Two**: *Nagua Jing* (Classic of Absorbing the Trigrams)\n- **Volume Three**: *Shenyun Jing* (Classic of Spirit Circulation), *Dali Zhujie* (Annotations on Great Strength), *Hezhan Bamen* (Eight Gates of Combined Combat)\n- **Volume Four**: *Dilong Jing* (Classic of Earthly Dragon), *Sanmen Zhengju* (Standard Forms of Scattered Gates), *Sanmen Bianju* (Variations of Scattered Gates), *Sanmen Zongju* (General Principles of Scattered Gates), *Sanmen Zaping* (Miscellaneous Critiques of Scattered Gates), *Zhisheng Bajue* (Eight Secrets of Victory)\n\nRegarding the provenance of this text, Ren Erqi (1877–1945), a disciple of the Song family’s Xingyi Quan, briefly recounted in his *Original Postscript to The Four Classics of Internal Cultivation*: \"This book was obtained during the early Qing dynasty, retrieved by Minister Wang from a stone casket at the riverbed.\"\n\nIn the *Preface* by Wang Nanxi and the *Postscript* by Zong Jingfang included in this *Authentic Complete Edition of the True Classic of Internal Cultivation*, the detailed history of the text and Wang Nanxi’s painstaking research are elaborated. Wang Nanxi states:\n\n> \"*The Four Classics of Internal Cultivation* was acquired by my ancestor, Minister Wang, while serving in Jiangxi. After his passing, over a hundred years elapsed without anyone understanding the purpose of this book. In the year *jiazi*, I chanced upon it in a hidden storeroom. Upon opening it, I was at first bewildered and nearly abandoned my efforts. Later, after years of exhaustive study, I came to realize that this book embodies the foundational lineage of martial arts and the true transmission of internal cultivation.\"\n\nZong Jingfang recounts:\n\n> \"My friend Nanxi’s ancestor was a minister in the early Qing dynasty. While overseeing affairs in Jiangxi, his boat anchored at Qingjiang, where he witnessed a merchant’s vessel capsize. As goods were salvaged from the riverbed, a stone casket was recovered, containing two books. The minister wished to examine them. The merchant presented them for his inspection: one titled *Jiandan* (Sword Elixir), the other *Neigong* (Internal Cultivation). The *Neigong* text comprised four sections: *Neigong Jing* (Classic of Internal Cultivation), *Nagua Jing* (Classic of Absorbing the Trigrams), *Shenyun Jing* (Classic of Spirit Circulation), and *Dilong Jing* (Classic of Earthly Dragon). A postscript read: ‘Copied on the fifteenth day of the third month in the second year of Zhenguan.’ The minister purchased it at a high price.\"\n\nZong Jingfang, a friend of Wang Nanxi, studied *The Four Classics of Internal Cultivation* alongside him and assisted in \"providing detailed annotations to elucidate its meaning, ensuring that later generations may study and apply it.\" For this publication, the editor has followed the original manuscript’s markings, distinguishing the *Four Classics* text (in bold) from the annotations (in regular script). As the original is a handwritten copy with somewhat cursive script, any errors in transcription or misinterpretation in this edition await correction by discerning readers.\n\n**Preface and Postscript to *The Authentic Complete Edition of the True Classic of Internal Cultivation***\n\n**Volume One**: *Neigong Jing* (Classic of Internal Cultivation)\n**Volume Two**: *Nagua Jing* (Classic of Absorbing the Trigrams)\n\n**Volume Three**: *Shenyun Jing* (Classic of Spirit-Motion, with *Comprehensive Annotations on Great Power* and *Eight Gates of Combined Combat*)\n**Volume Four**: *Dilong Jing* (Classic of Earthly Dragon, comprising *Scattered Gates: Orthodox Formations*, *Scattered Gates: Variable Formations*, *General Critique*, *Miscellaneous Critiques*, *Twelve Patterns*, and *Eight Keys to Victory*)\n\n**Preface**\n*The Four Classics of Internal Cultivation* were acquired by my late ancestor, Grand Censor Wang, during his tenure in Jiangxi. After his passing, a century and more elapsed without anyone discerning the purpose of this work. By chance, in the *jiazi* year, I discovered it in the *Treasured Pavilion*. Upon opening the scroll, I was at first bewildered, nearly abandoning it in discouragement. Yet after years of painstaking study, I came to recognize this text as the foundational lineage of martial arts and the true transmission of internal skill. Once internal cultivation is mastered, every technique becomes a sublime application—what is called \"drawing from an inexhaustible source, finding it wherever one turns.\"\n\nHowever, the true transmission of internal cultivation does not seek haste; it demands years of dedicated effort before attainment is possible. The *Classic of Internal Cultivation* thus stands as the highest priority. Some may be dull of talent, impatient with its subtleties, or constrained by poverty, unable to train daily. If they rush to penetrate its principles upon first encounter, will they not gaze in vain like one who faces the ocean yet gathers nothing? Therefore, I have compiled several chapters on external manifestations of internal skill: *Great Power: Complete Formations*, *Internal Skill in Combined Combat*, *Scattered Gates of Internal Skill*, *Reversal and Compliance*, *Inversion and Sequence*, and *Essential Points of the Internal Classics*. Through these, even beginners may grasp the underlying principles of the text.\n\nAs for postures and techniques, a few are recorded here, yet without understanding the *Internal Classics*, one will often err fundamentally in the principles of skeletal alignment, joint coordination, and the interplay of compliance and resistance. Alas! *The Four Classics of Internal Cultivation* have languished in obscurity for centuries. The traces of the ancients have faded, leaving no transmission. How can later students of this Way avoid misdirecting their efforts?\n\nWritten in the autumn of the *renwu* year, after discussing these matters with my friend Jingfang of Zhushan, and transmitted to the *Orchid Fragrance Study*. Here I set it down as a preface.\n\n—Preface by Wang Nanxi of Langya\n\n**Postscript**\n\nThe Dao, which embodies the essence of Heaven and Earth and the hidden mysteries of yin and yang, cannot perish in obscurity—this is no mere coincidence. Heaven must raise extraordinary individuals to comprehend it, and those who comprehend it must commit it to writing. If such works do not circulate in the centuries before, they will surely circulate in the centuries after. There must arise one who obtains the book, not by chance, and another who preserves it. If the preserver cannot put it into practice, there must arise one who strives to do so, undaunted by hardship, determined to elucidate the true legacy of the ancients for posterity. Yet fearing that one person’s efforts may not suffice, others will inevitably emerge to assist—how could this be mere coincidence?\n\nAlas! Such individuals may await one another across centuries or meet within them, their paths converging and diverging in wondrous ways. My friend, Nanxi Zi, had an ancestor who served as a high-ranking censor and governor of Jiangxi in the early Qing. While moored at Qingjiang, he witnessed a merchant’s boat capsize, and upon rescuing goods from the water, recovered a stone casket containing two books. The official wished to examine them, and the merchant presented them for his inspection. One was titled *Sword and Elixir*, the other *Internal Cultivation*. The latter comprised four scrolls: the *Classic of Internal Cultivation*, the *Classic of Absorbing the Trigrams*, the *Classic of Spirit Movement*, and the *Classic of Earthly Dragon*. A postscript read: “Copied on the fifteenth day of the third month, second year of Zhen’guan.” The official acquired them at a high price.\n\nAlas! This book, composed in high antiquity and concealed beneath the waters in a stone casket, had endured untold years of obscurity. After centuries of burial, it suddenly resurfaced—was this not proof of the Dao’s indestructibility, that Heaven specially raised a merchant to retrieve it and an official to preserve it? The official studied the texts at length, recognizing their profound principles as truly exceptional. Yet burdened by his solemn duties to the court, he had no leisure to delve deeply. After his passing, the books entered wider circulation. His descendants, however, valued literary pursuits and official rank, while those indifferent to scholarship focused on family and livelihood. None paid heed to these works. Even those who chanced upon them found the contents baffling and dismissed them as useless. Some of the Wang family’s descendants were unaware such books existed in their household.\n\nOnly my friend Nanxi Zi, born with keen intelligence, though he did not pursue official success, delighted in poetry and literature, free from worldly calculations. One day, he chanced upon these books and noticed their seals. Sighing, he remarked: “This official was a man of discernment—clearly, he would not have paid a high price for worthless things. These books must hold profound meaning, though none now understand them.” He pored over them meticulously, noting passages on trigrams resembling *Yijing* commentaries, others on the body’s meridians akin to medical texts, and still others on refining spirit and qi like Daoist alchemical manuals. For two or three years, he pondered them deeply but could not fathom their full significance.\n\nLater, while conversing idly with a man named Guan, he learned that Guan’s master had achieved unparalleled skill in martial arts, attributing it to the *Classic of Internal Cultivation*. Nanxi Zi inquired: “Does the *Classic of Internal Cultivation* still exist?” Guan replied: “It has long been lost. My master, Shao, learned it orally, retaining only two or three parts out of ten.” Suddenly, Nanxi Zi realized—this was the very book the official had acquired! He retrieved it and studied it anew, gaining fleeting insights. Redoubling his efforts, he gradually grasped its potential to awaken wisdom, and secondarily, to heal illness and strengthen the body. Even its martial applications were but minor benefits. After two years, he tested his skills against opponents and never failed to prevail.\n\nAlas! For a century, this book had been deemed useless—had Nanxi Zi not devoted himself to deciphering it, would it not have remained so? As the ancients said: “The Dao is transmitted to those who truly understand it.” How true! A principle buried for over a hundred years was suddenly brought to light—was this not proof of the Dao’s indestructibility, that Heaven specially raised Nanxi Zi to illuminate it?\n\nYet the Dao’s depths are boundless. Nanxi Zi admitted his mastery extended to only half of its ten parts. Regretting the lack of a kindred spirit to discuss and refine it with him, he feared that if he withheld it entirely, the ancients’ treasure would vanish forever—a grievous loss. For over a decade, he bore this burden silently, his heart heavy with unease.\n\nIn the *bingzi* year, I visited his hometown, and we became close, our ages and aspirations aligned. He regarded me as an elder brother, and I, him as a younger brother. Having long heard of his martial prowess, I was drawn to it, and pressed him repeatedly for details. Moved by our deep friendship, he held nothing back, outlining the essentials. At first, I dismissed it as mere brute martial skill. Later, when we lodged in a nearby village and met daily, I learned of its benefits for healing and strengthening the body, and begged to learn it. Nanxi Zi cautioned: “This practice cannot be mastered in a day or a night. Without perseverance, it will be futile.” I insisted, and he taught me a few techniques. After months of practice with no results, I privately deemed it impractical and nearly abandoned it. Nanxi Zi said: “I warned you this was no quick endeavor—do you now believe me?” Ashamed, I persisted for several more months, and faint progress emerged. Overjoyed, I told Nanxi Zi: “Please, teach me more.”\n\nNanxi Zi said: \"Do not assume that because you practiced for months and suddenly achieved extraordinary results—your long-standing lumps and swellings healed, your strength multiplied severalfold—only then did you understand that I did not lightly transmit this to others not out of stinginess, but out of reverence for this Dao.\"\n\nThereupon, I bowed again and sought further instruction. Though I gained some slight insights, they remained scant. Only then did I realize that Nanxi Zi was not one to speak idly, and so I ceased my requests. Nanxi Zi said: \"In this practice, the method of employing qi follows but a single channel. Should one stray into side paths, the harm will be no small matter.\"\n\nI heard these words but did not take them to heart. After receiving the instruction and practicing, I gradually began to comprehend. Suddenly, I thought: *Are not all arts under heaven but imitations devised by the ancients? Why should I alone not invent my own?* I made slight modifications, and within months, I was stricken with severe cramping and stiffness. I told Nanxi Zi: \"The efficacy of this Dao lies in this: one must not be greedy for progress, nor rush too hastily, nor recklessly alter its methods. Most of the changes I made ran counter to its true principles—otherwise, how could I have suffered such affliction?\"\n\nI was overwhelmed with shame and immediately vowed to repent. Nanxi Zi explained the proper methods in detail, and after several months, my cramping and stiffness were cured. From then on, whatever he deemed correct, I pursued day and night; whatever he deemed incorrect, I abandoned day and night. Thus, for two years, I felt profound awakening in my heart, while my qi and body became as boundless as the rising sun. Though I did not speak of it, my heart knew the truth. The deeper our mutual understanding grew, the more we forgot our physical forms.\n\nNanxi Zi did not regard this as any great achievement, nor did I ever utter a word of flattery. Whenever we discussed these matters, we would forget sleep and food. Nanxi Zi’s discourses were incisive and eloquent, leaving little room for further questions. After another two years, Nanxi Zi suddenly presented me with two scrolls, saying: \"These are supreme treasures. I have long wished to transmit them, but never found the right person. Now I see you are no mere drifter in the world of dust. I wish to bestow them upon you. The first is *The Sword Scroll*, a cinnabar classic of the immortals, which must not be passed on to those without innate wisdom. The second is *The Internal Cultivation Classic*, which strengthens the body, cures illness, and greatly enhances one’s qi and strength. I intend to spread it throughout the land—would you make it known to all who seek it?\"\n\nOverwhelmed with astonishment and joy, I prostrated myself and bowed again, saying: \"This is a teaching beyond price—who would not yearn for it? Yet you alone have chosen to teach me. How can I ever repay your boundless kindness? Now you entrust me with these treasured scrolls, even permitting their transmission to future generations. Your generosity is selfless—how could I refuse?\" I then asked about the origins of the texts in detail.\n\nNanxi Zi explained fully: \"There are many passages in these scrolls that remain obscure. I wish to work with you to annotate and clarify them so that later generations may understand and apply them.\" I replied: \"These texts, buried for centuries, are now to be spread across the land—is this not proof that this Dao cannot be extinguished? Heaven must have raised one who fears no hardship to elucidate the true methods of the ancients and transmit them to posterity. Though I am unworthy, I dare to pledge my humble sincerity to assist you, my brother, in completing this endeavor.\" Thus, this preface was written.\n\nBy Zong Jingfang of Zhushan\nGeneral Discussion\n\nThe arts of martial valor have numbered no fewer than dozens of schools since ancient times—Exploring Horse, Mirror Son, Arhat, Grand Ancestor, Buddha, Warrior Son—names so astonishing and fearsome they defy full recounting. Yet vulgar custom prevails: to study one is to reject another, to embrace one is to spurn the rest, and disputes multiply day by day. The crux lies in failing to inherit the true transmission of internal skill. Bound by sectarian dogma, practitioners exhaust themselves in vain toil, ever remaining in the lower ranks. It is like reading without returning to essentials, skimming without depth, or pursuing breadth without focus—how can one grasp the Dao?\n\nAll things possess a root; when the root is secured, the branches follow. This is what is meant by \"one governing ten thousand\" and \"simplicity governing complexity.\" Yet those who practice this Way in recent times have forgotten that its root is singular, chasing instead the myriad differences of its branches. They divide into factions, fabricate names, and often boast, \"My art is the shortcut.\" Ignorant of the principle of \"one governing ten thousand\" or \"simplicity governing complexity,\" they wander in confusion—no wonder they crumble in combat.\n\nThe true Way of the cosmos has never offered shortcuts; there are only root and branch, before and after. Later transformations, boundless in variation, arise solely from gradual, orderly progress—where is there room for shortcuts?\n\nThen what is this root? It is *jin*. When advancing, it can subdue the enemy; when retreating, it can defend the self. In all directions—up, down, forth, back—it responds as one wishes. *Jin* that is slack, weak, or hollow cannot withstand an opponent, nor can it guard the self in retreat. Every preparation, whether substantial or insubstantial, becomes a perilous moment. Thus, *jin* is indeed essential.\n\nYet without understanding the guiding principles of *jin*, its pivotal mechanisms, or its ultimate destination, one may possess *jin* in name but never in truth.\n\nWhat are the guiding principles of *jin*? They lie in the head. The head is the meeting point of all yang, the guiding principle of the entire body—like the handle of an object or the beginning of an affair. If the handle is crooked, the matter cannot be resolved; how can one expect the rest to follow? Thus, the head’s function is to lift upward, not to sink downward; to be vibrant and spirited, not sluggish and lifeless. Though *jin* does not reside in the head, the head’s bearing is never irrelevant to the mastery or loss of *jin*.\n\nWhat are the pivotal mechanisms of *jin*? They lie in the shoulders and ribs. The shoulders are the root of the arms, the ribs the cavern of *qi*. They unite the spirit of the head above with the power of the feet, waist, and hips below, forming the great nexus of the entire body. Like the door of a house or the pass of a nation, if the door does not open, there is no passage for coming or going. Thus, the shoulders’ function has eight essentials: *tong* (through), *tou* (penetrate), *chuan* (pierce), *tie* (adhere), *song* (relax), *han* (sweat), *he* (unite), and *jian* (firm). The ribs’ function has two: opening and expanding, tightening and gathering. Mastering these secrets, one grasps more than half the wonders of the middle region.\n\nWhat is the ultimate destination of *jin*? It lies in the feet. The feet are the root of all limbs, bearing the entire body—like all things growing from soil and standing upon the earth, where decline and vigor, form and posture, all depend on the ground. If the earth is not vast and thick, how can it bear all things? Thus, the feet are the source of *jin*’s issuance. Every release and relaxation arises from the *yongquan* (Bubbling Spring) point beneath the feet; every contraction and tension returns to the *yongquan* to subside. This is the essential secret of the lower path and the foundation of all skill.\n\nUnderstanding these three—head, shoulders and ribs, feet—one may grasp the general outline. Yet what remains to be emphasized above all?\n\nIt is *qi*. For *jin* arises from *qi* as wood arises from water—wood must await water’s moisture to live, and *jin* must be nurtured by *qi* before it emerges by principle. If one wishes to cultivate *qi*, one must first open the gates and cavities to guide its flow. Otherwise, the gates and cavities of the body will be blocked by the turbid *qi* of later heaven. Even if one desires to cultivate *qi*, how could it be possible? One must stretch the sinews and extend the strength to unblock them, and only then will true *qi* flow naturally. By circulating this *qi*, one may nourish *jin* and replenish *qi*. Thus, in the beginning, *qi* and *jin* serve to mutually support and replenish one another. With prolonged practice, they merge into a single, undifferentiated power. Later scholars who delve deeply into these principles will surely recognize that my words are not idle.\n\nAs for the floating and sinking of *qi*, the relaxation and tension of *jin*, the opening and closing of the head, the horizontal and vertical alignment of the hands, and the upright and oblique postures of the body—these must be sought within the *Internal Skill Classic* and its Ten Postures. They cannot be mastered in a single day.\n\n**Annotations by Wang Nanxi of Langya in Shanzuo**\n**Collated by Zong Jingfang of Zhushan in Haiyou**\n\n**The Internal Skill Classic**\nThe transmission of internal skill is rooted in the authenticity of its meridians. The first essential of internal skill is to understand the meridians. If the meridians are not authentic, forced practice will bring no benefit and may cause harm.\n\n**Front Ren and Rear Du, Rolling Qi Unceasing**\nThe *Ren* meridian begins at *Chengjiang* (Sauce Receptacle), descends straight through the center of the chest and abdomen, and terminates at the high bone of the anterior yin. The *Du* meridian begins at the very end of the coccyx, ascends straight along the spine, passes through *Niuwan* (Mud Pill Palace), and terminates at *Renzhong* (Human Center) beneath the nose. When *qi* rolls unceasingly through these two meridians, front and back, prolonged practice will lead to its abundant arrival.\n\n**Well and Pool, Issuing Power in Sequence**\nThe *Well* refers to *Jianjing* (Shoulder Well), located at the center of the shoulder’s division. The *Pool* refers to *Quchi* (Crooked Pool), located at the center of the elbow’s division, with one point on each side. These are the cavities through which *jin* is issued outward throughout the body. When practicing, one must not be overly forceful but should proceed with composure. *In sequence* means to enter gradually.\n\n**Myriad Transformations, Yet Never Departing from the Root**\n**Attaining Its Profundity, One Marvels at Its Boundlessness**\nThe *root* is the true *qi* of nature. This summarizes the profundity of internal skill: though its manifestations are countless and its threads myriad, its essential principle never departs from the true *qi* of nature. The learner must first taste its profundity. With prolonged practice, insight will arise, and only then will one marvel at its infinite wonders.\n\n**Raising Qi from the Tortoise Tail, Refining Spirit in the Cinnabar Field**\nThe *Tortoise Tail* is the very end of the coccyx. When force is applied to lift it upward, true *qi* naturally ascends. The *Cinnabar Field* lies 1.2 *cun* below the navel. When practicing, one visualizes true *qi* and primordial spirit gathering here, refining the spirit. These are the mechanisms of spiritual transformation, to be grasped through intuition and insight, not sought through external form.\n\n**Qi Descends to the Sea, Light Gathers at Heaven’s Heart**\nThe center of the lower abdomen is the *Sea of Qi*, and the center of the forehead is *Tianxin* (Heaven’s Heart). When true *qi* descends, one’s countenance naturally radiates majesty—this is the external manifestation of inner sincerity.\n\n**Having Clarified the Meridians, One Must Observe the Forms**\n*Forms* are the fixed rules of entry. As the preceding text states, once the meridians are understood, one must then grasp the body’s fixed forms. Without knowledge of the forms, discussions of meridians remain empty talk.\n\n**Head Upright and Rising, Shoulders Level and Aligned, Chest Projecting and Closed**\nAn upright head strengthens the spirit of the face. Aligned shoulders activate the potential of both flanks. A projecting chest enhances the body’s majesty—these are the forms of the upper body. However, the head must be raised by lifting the neck, the shoulders must be level on all sides without the slightest tilt, and though the chest projects, it must retain a sense of restraint. These are the true secrets of the forms, which one must not fail to understand.\n\n**Feet Firm and Steady, Knees Bent yet Extended**\n**Crotch Deep and Concealed, Ribs Open and Expanded**\nThough the step may rise and fall, the feet must be firmly planted and unwavering. The knees’ function lies in their outward bend and inward straightness—though their posture may be bent, one must intend to extend them. The anterior yin must be drawn back with utmost force to achieve deep concealment. The seams of both ribs must be fully opened to complement the projecting rib posture.\n\n**Qi Harmonized and Even, Power Relaxed yet Tense**\nWhen practicing, *qi* should flow like drawn silk, inhaling and exhaling through the nose to avoid damaging the visceral *qi*. This is why *qi* must be even. *Harmonizing* refers to the breath’s ebb and flow. *Power* must first relax before tension is applied. Only through extreme relaxation can tension reach its peak. Thus, tension arises from relaxation, not the other way around.\n\n**First Inhale, Then Exhale—One Out, One In**\n**First Lift, Then Lower—One Ascend, One Descend**\n**Within Lies the Cinnabar Field, the Destination of Qi**\nBuilding on the preceding, this clarifies the method of using *qi*: inhale and exhale without sound—this is the way to harmonize *qi*. *Lifting* means visualizing true *qi* ascending to the crown. *Lowering* means true *qi* descending after ascent. *Descending* means true *qi* deeply concealed within, gradually gathering and shrinking until it settles in the Cinnabar Field, like a hibernating dragon or a crouching tiger, still and unmoving.\n\n**Lower: Draw In the Valley Passage; Upper: Lift the Jade Tower**\n**Whether Standing or Sitting, Draw Qi to the Throat**\n**Guide It with Intention, Gradually Sinking to the Bottom**\nContinuing from above, this describes the method of descending *qi*. The *Valley Passage* is the posterior yin. Drawing it in prevents *qi* from leaking. The *Jade Tower* refers to the high bone behind the ear.\n\nLifting ensures that descending *qi* flows without obstruction. Whether sitting or standing, when using *qi*, it must enter through the throat to follow the true path into the lungs, heart, liver, and kidneys. Though *qi* enters the Cinnabar Field, when applying intention, one must visualize true *qi* sinking to the very bottom for the method to be effective.\n\nThere is a path for ascent and a place for descent: the *qi*-route of the transport points. This describes the meridians of true *qi*’s ascent and descent. When ascending, it rises through the gaps between the ribs, so one must exert effort to open and lift upward to naturally find the aperture. When descending, it must enter through the *Shu*-mouth points along the spine, penetrating the front of the heart to follow the true path of *qi*. The *Shu*-mouth point is the seventh vertebra counted from the top of the spine.\n\nHaving clarified the *qi*-apertures, we now explain the secrets of *jin*. *Through, penetrate, pierce, adhere, relax, coalesce, unite, firm*—*through* is the smoothness of *jin*; *penetrate* is its transmission. Continuing from above, this speaks of *jin*’s relaxation and tension, the method of refining *qi*. *Through* and *penetrate* describe unimpeded movement from here to there, embodying the meaning of \"supple softness.\" *Pierce* is the continuity of *jin*; *adhere* is its network. *Pierce* and *adhere* refer to horizontal and vertical connections: horizontal connection is *adhere*, vertical continuity is *pierce*, belonging to the yang extension of sinews and tensile force, signifying rigidity and congealed strength. *Relax* is the dispersion of *jin*; *coalesce* is its gathering. *Relax* is extreme softness, utmost pliability, the intention of nurturing essence and storing vigor. *Coalesce* is extreme hardness, utmost robustness, the congealing and contraction of *qi* and blood. *Relax* is like a rope’s binding; *coalesce* is like ice’s formation. These two interact and complement each other, for softness can aid hardness, and hardness can aid softness. *Unite* is the oneness of *jin*; *firm* is its capability. *Unite* means the body’s bones and joints merge into one; *firm* refers to horizontal and vertical strength, advancing a layer beyond the *pierce* and *adhere* of *jin*.\n\nPress the shoulders to train the steps; squeeze the hips to firm the knees. Round the crotch to firm the hips; lift the chest to lower the waist. These are the true secrets of stepping. Everyone trains their steps, yet few know the secret lies in pressing the shoulders—pressing the *Jianjing* point’s *jin* to sink to the *Yongquan* point at the soles. Everyone knows to firm the knees, yet few know the secret lies in squeezing the hips—pressing the buttocks tightly together. Everyone knows to firm the hips, yet few know the secret lies in rounding the crotch—exerting force to push the crotch outward horizontally. Everyone knows to lower the waist, yet few know the secret lies in lifting the chest—using force to raise it.\n\nLift the chin to align the head; press the back to turn the *dou*. Relax the shoulders to emit *jin*. Exert force to lift the chin bone upward to naturally straighten the neck. Press the two shoulder blades tightly together, intending the *jin* to emerge from beneath the arms to the *Liufu* point, turn outward to the *dou* bone, and return. When emitting *jin*, use the softest intention to relax the *Jianjing* point to ensure no obstruction.\n\nFold the *Tianzhu* to descend *qi*; gaze at *Hegu* to establish the gate. The *Tianzhu* point is on the high bone at the back; when ascending and descending *qi*, press it tightly to naturally find its aperture. The *Hegu* point, commonly called the \"tiger’s mouth,\" when facing an opponent, raise the hand to ear level, focus the gaze upon it—this is the method of the mysterious gate.\n\nDistinguish clearly between horizontal and vertical *jin*: the horizontal aids the vertical, the vertical employs the horizontal. Regarding the whole body, from the crown of the head to the soles of the feet is vertical *jin*; from the spine to the fingertips is horizontal *jin*. Regarding the back alone, from the armpits to the *Yunmen* points at the shoulders is vertical *jin*; from the *Liufu* point turning to the *dou* bone is horizontal *jin*. Regarding the legs alone, from the inner hips to the soles is vertical *jin*; from the knees to the buttocks is horizontal *jin*. In sum, within the horizontal there is vertical, and within the vertical there is horizontal. When facing an opponent, the horizontal overcomes the vertical, and the vertical overcomes the horizontal.\n\nThe Five *Qi* Gather at the Origin, circulating endlessly. The four limbs’ primacy lies in their wondrous gathering and containment. This summarizes the unified Dao of internal practice: inhale the essence-*qi* of heaven and earth into the Cinnabar Field, then circulate the true *qi* of the Cinnabar Field from the armpits to ascend to the crown. When ascending *qi*, true *qi* naturally descends from the *Shu*-mouth to the Cinnabar Field—this is the first *qi* gathering at the origin. Circulate the true *qi* of the Cinnabar Field from within the crotch downward to the soles; when descending *qi*, true *qi* naturally rises from the soles, ascending from the outer crotch to the Cinnabar Field—left and right together count as the second *qi* gathering at the origin. Circulate the true *qi* of the Cinnabar Field from beneath the back to the Cinnabar Field—left and right together count as the third *qi* gathering at the origin. In total, the Five *Qi* gather at the origin. One ascent and one descent, one lowering and one rising, one exit and one entry proceed without conflict, circulating endlessly without pause. With prolonged practice, wondrous effects abound—this is the ultimate method of refining spirit to return to the origin.\n\nHeaven and earth unite in harmony; water ascends and fire descends. Head and feet, above and below, connect as if by spirit. Continuing from above, with prolonged and refined practice of gathering at the origin, true water naturally ascends and true fire naturally descends. The upper and lower spirit-*qi* are refined into a seamless whole, like heaven and earth uniting in harmony, a scene of divine transformation beyond measure.\n\nIn stillness, radiance ascends; in motion, it soars. Continuing from above, this speaks of the internal apertures of practice and the external signs of its verification.\n\nWhen true *qi* is abundant within, its radiance manifests externally, though concealed and unmoving. The face glows with divine light, essence shining afar, making it impossible for others to gaze directly—this is the wondrous effect of stillness. *Qi* surges through the form, the form following *qi*; intent commands spirit, spirit commands *qi*, and *qi* commands the form. Thus, wherever spirit and *qi* lead, the body is never encumbered, like a dragon soaring through clouds or a bird gliding through the sky, appearing suddenly and vanishing in an instant—this is the marvel of the practice.\n\n*(Internal Practice Classic concludes; awaiting the Hexagram Classic to follow.)*\n\n**Hexagram Classic**\n\nThe head’s method follows *Qian* (☰), drawing from its strength, purity, and vigor. The feet and knees follow *Kun* (☻), drawing from its stability, tranquility, and capacity to bear. The head governs the body of *Qian*, serving as the leader of the entire form, embodying the principle of the origin. It lifts the body’s *qi* and blood, embodying the principle of flourishing. It should adapt fluidly to an opponent, avoiding rigidity, embodying the principle of benefit. It should stand firm, upright, and elevated, avoiding slant or collapse, embodying the principle of constancy. If too low, it resembles the \"hidden dragon\" of inaction; if too raised, it risks the calamity of the \"exalted dragon’s regret.\" Neither raised nor lowered, centered and properly aligned, spirit radiates forth—this is how one meets a formidable foe.\n\nThe *nine in the second* speaks of \"the dragon seen in the field\" and \"the flying dragon in the heavens,\" an image of meeting the celestial. Yet this is an external manifestation, not the inner meaning. The *nine in the fourth* says, \"Perhaps leaping in the abyss, without blame.\" Understanding this profound principle reveals the subtle essence of the head’s method. The *nine in the fourth* resides at the base of the upper trigram and the top of the lower, symbolizing the crown. The body’s *qi*, from the heart, surges upward through the crown, embodying the head’s strength and purity—is this not akin to leaping? Yet *qi*, as an entity, can be spoken of but not seen, profound and unfathomable—is it not like the emptiness of the abyss? The first *nine*, *nine in the second*, *nine in the fifth*, and *top nine* all speak of the dragon, but this line alone says \"perhaps.\" Observing this line’s *qi*, ascending from the *first nine*’s concealment to the *nine in the fifth*’s rise and fall, the mechanism of floating and sinking, the natural flow of heavenly principle—one must not cling even slightly to form. Just as the body’s *qi* descends from the crown, true *qi* ascends to the ears, then descends to the mouth, transforming into sweet dew, leaving no trace to point to. The head’s practice outwardly reflects the images of the *nine in the second* and *nine in the fifth*, while inwardly embodying the meaning of the *nine in the fourth*—thus it is without blame.\n\nYet there is further meaning: such practice is profoundly subtle and boundless. The practitioner must delve deeply and experience it naturally. If one acts with impatience or recklessness, the body will only suffer harm—what benefit can come of it? Therefore, \"all day long, *Qian* remains vigilant; even at dusk, it is cautious.\" Whether learning the Dao or martial arts, this must be taken as the rule.\n\nThe feet and knees should be settled and tranquil, not restless or agitated, taking their image from *Kun*. The body’s entire practice relies on the two feet and knees to gather it, just as all things under heaven depend on *Kun*’s earth to bear them. The lower trigram represents the feet, the upper trigram the knees. *Initial six: Treading on frost, solid ice arrives*—this draws from the primal stability of stillness. Yin *qi* condenses and refines, gradually becoming firm. *Six in the second: Straight, square, and great; without practice, nothing is unfavorable*—this speaks of the primal stability of stillness, naturally upright, square, and expansive, requiring no forced effort, and all it encounters proceeds smoothly. *Six in the third: Containing brilliance, it can be steadfast; or following the king’s affairs, without achievement yet with completion*—this speaks of embodying a correct and expansive form, inwardly able to be steadfast and guard itself, outwardly able to follow a superior’s affairs. Though it cannot achieve its own way, it can preserve its end. *Six in the fourth: Tying up the sack, without blame or praise*—this speaks of the knees’ function: one must not act recklessly to seek praise. *Six in the fifth: Yellow skirts, primal auspiciousness*—this speaks of the tiger’s eyes facing outward and *Weizhong* (委中) inward, embracing the middle way before achieving primal auspiciousness. *Top six: Dragons battle in the wild; their blood is dark yellow*—this warns against excessive yin stillness, which harms transformation. Thus, when yin reaches its extreme, yang is born; when stillness reaches its extreme, movement arises. Though outwardly settled, the inner true *qi* surges upward from *Yongquan* (涌泉), yang born beneath the multitude of yin—this embodies the meaning of *Earth-Thunder Revival* (地雷復).\n\nThe head’s practice is upright without slant, extended without contraction, neither reversed nor tilted, neither lowered nor raised—these are its external manifestations. As for its fullness, robust bearing, and martial majesty, all are the work of *qi*. One must observe the *Hukou* (虎口) point to determine the body’s lateral alignment. If the chin is raised, it risks tilting upward; if the spine is slightly raised, it avoids sinking—one must be cautious. Behind each ear lies a prominent bone, the *tiqi* (提气) point. When lifting *qi*, it must rise straight upward to avoid the peril of tilting or reversing. Yet one must use *qi* evenly on both sides; otherwise, if it leans to one side, it will inevitably reverse. If the practitioner does not know this aperture, even with great skill, the true *qi* of the *dantian* cannot ascend to the crown—how then can one achieve the image of strength, purity, and vigor?\n\nWhenever extending a hand, one must observe the *Hukou* point, lifting the front of the chin with balanced force, neither raised nor lowered, while the *Jiaji* (夹脊) point presses downward with effort. When the true *qi* of the *dantian* arrives, it reaches straight to the *tiqi* point, where force is applied to lift it. Passing through *Baihui* (百会), it turns to *Kunlun* (昆仑), descends to *Mingtang* (明堂), and flows into both eyes. When the *qi* seeks to escape through the nose, it is immediately drawn back into the *dantian*. Three *cun* and six *fen* below each ear lies the *dingyan* (顶眼) point, where force is applied downward to stabilize it, unifying the entire body’s structure. With prolonged practice, its wonders will naturally be understood.\n\nThe human body stands solely upon two feet, with all bones and flesh relying on them for support. If one’s training is not refined, there remains the risk of stumbling—how much more so for those utterly devoid of strength? With every step, the feet must be rooted to the earth: the big toes press inward with force, the heels likewise turn inward, and the high bones behind the big toes’ soles mark the true acupoints. The entire body’s power is directed downward to anchor them, so that while the knees may move, the feet remain unmoved—like wind shaking a tree, swaying its trunk but leaving its roots undisturbed.\n\nThose who train the knees in the world know only to keep them straight when standing and bent when sitting. Even among the few who grasp the broader principle, their skill remains superficial. How could they fathom that the knees possess fourfold power in all directions? With every step, the outer *huyan* points exert force inward, while the inner *huyan* points press outward with equal vigor. The two great sinews of *Weizhong* must be kept tautly straight, while the *gaigu* bones strive to bend. As these four forces converge, uniting the body’s strength, a single outward twist will allow the *qi* of *Yongquan* to pierce through its center.\n\nTraining is like glue adhering to an object—once set, it becomes unbreakable; like fire tempering metal—once fused, it cannot be pried apart. Its subtleties defy verbal transmission. The practitioner must ponder the principles of the *Kun* hexagram to grasp its essence inwardly.\n\nMoreover, all ten toes must grip the earth with force, yet this must be coordinated with the body’s entire structure to achieve true mastery. If timing is uneven—whether early or late—the method is flawed.\n\nWhen engaging an opponent, if the right step is used, the left knee may slightly straighten, and if the left step is used, the right knee may do the same. Though one must not be rigidly bound by this rule, neither should one overdo it. The essential principle is to avoid losing one’s *yuanqi*. Viewed from the front, the knees appear aligned; from behind, the coccyx seems to rest upon something. With chest sunken and waist lowered, one does not lose forward concealment; with knees firm and steps closed, one avoids leaning backward. Stillness and tranquility govern all.\n\nThe shoulders and back should remain supple and lively, embodying the meaning of *Xun*’s compliance. The crotch and hips, however, must be drawn taut, reflecting the nature of *Dui*’s joy. The shoulders and back take their image from *Xun*: a single yin line crouched beneath two yang lines, outwardly strong yet inwardly yielding. The *Xun* hexagram’s *First Six* states, *\"Advancing and retreating benefit the steadfastness of the warrior,\"* for only when tempered by compliance can strength move with flexibility. *Nine in the Third* says, *\"Compliance beneath the bed, employing shamans and mediums—auspicious, without blame,\"* meaning that one who embodies compliance acts from below yet, like a shaman’s accumulated sincerity, can commune with spirits. *Nine in the Third* further warns, *\"Frequent compliance brings regret,\"* for strength’s advance and retreat must arise naturally—excessive rigidity and imbalance lead only to misfortune. *Six in the Fourth* states, *\"Regret vanishes; in the field, three kinds of game are captured,\"* for after regret fades, one’s gains follow. *Nine in the Fifth*, *\"Firm and central, residing in the middle path of compliance—steadfast and auspicious,\"* embodies the hexagram’s essence. Even without profound insight at first, prolonged compliance yields this marvel, benefiting all actions regardless of sequence. *Top Nine* cautions, *\"Compliance beneath the bed, losing one’s resources and axe,\"* for excessive compliance without restraint depletes one’s *yuanqi*.\n\nThe crotch and hips take their image from *Dui*: inner firmness and outer softness, the softness likened to the abdomen, the firmness to the thighs. The abdomen rests upon the thighs, yin riding over yang. Fearing yang’s excess rigidity, it is tempered by curvature to complete its posture—this is the thigh’s role. Fearing yin’s excess softness, it is bolstered by solidity to invigorate its spirit—this is the abdomen’s function. When *Dui* meets *Kan*, it becomes *Jie* (節, restraint), for restraint imposes limits to prevent excess. *Dui* is the marsh, *Kan* is water—the external kidneys and the anus. Water in a marsh easily leaks; *qi* reaching the abdomen likewise risks dissipation, hence the value of restraint. When *Dui* meets *Li*, it becomes *Guai* (乖, discord), for *Li* is fire, dryness, and upward flaring. The crotch should be refined and concealed, the hips firm and stable—if fiery and restless, discord arises. Yet within firmness, there must be suppleness; within stillness, movement—without becoming rigid or stagnant. Thus, when *Dui* meets *Gen*, it becomes *Sun* (損, reduction), for a mountain that does not move is diminished. It must move without losing stillness, be still without losing movement, firm without losing suppleness, and supple without losing firmness. When *Dui* meets *Zhen*, it becomes *Sui* (隨, following), for *Zhen* is thunder—when thunder moves, rain falls, and the marsh fills, its *qi* descending. When marsh water rises as clouds, true *qi* ascends.\n\nThose who train the shoulders and back often find that straightness precludes bending, bending precludes straightness, relaxation precludes tension, and tension precludes relaxation—all because they fail to grasp the body of inner firmness and outer softness, the function of inner compliance and outer strength. The *Jianjing* points must be pressed downward with force, the shoulders drawn inward to cling together, and the entire back extended outward. From within the spine, intent directs power outward. The hands must grip firmly, the whole body locked securely, enabling straightness within curvature, curvature within straightness, tension within relaxation, and relaxation within tension. With prolonged practice, the profound principle of inner softness and outer firmness, inner compliance and outer strength, will be revealed—pondering the *Xun* hexagram’s line texts will unveil its wonders.\n\nTo press the *Jianjing* points downward, the shoulder peaks must descend straight to meet the spine’s apex, the *Quchi* points slightly lower than the shoulder peaks by half an inch. The wrists align with the brows, and though the spine presses with maximal force, it remains a vertical power, not a horizontal one—for verticality is solid, horizontality is hollow.\n\nThe *Jianjing* points descend from the base of the bone straight to the soles of the feet—this is called \"vertical.\" When the right side of the back moves, the power of the left back must be directed from the base of the left spine through intention to the right back, extending straight to the *Ershanmen* points—this is called \"horizontal.\" Employing both powers without confusion, the primordial *qi* ascends and descends at will, and the meaning of *Xun* is thus attained.\n\nThe crotch and hips must be separated yet firm, their *qi* rising straight upward—neither protruding forward nor tilting backward. The hips must be divided into front and rear: the front hip exerts force forward, not downward; the rear hip exerts force downward, neither forward nor backward. When the *qi* of the *Yongquan* points surges upward with great intensity, press the hips down with maximal force—the more you press, the more it rises; the more it rises, the more you press. Contract the yin and yang orifices with force, preventing the circulating *qi* from leaking through the feet. Align the bone openings to face one another, as in the *Dui* hexagram: outer yin, inner yang, mutually engulfing.\n\nIn high stances, the hip power takes precedence, the crotch power assists; in middle stances, hip and crotch powers mutually engulf; in low stances, the crotch power takes precedence, the hip power assists. The crotch power is vertical—yin within yang; the hip power is horizontal—yang within yin. Thus, they must be applied differently according to high, middle, and low stances.\n\nThe crotch is the pivot of the hips, the hips are the direct agents of the crotch. Therefore, when the crotch is still, the hips move; when the hips advance, the crotch holds firm. Not a hair’s breadth of disorder is permissible. With prolonged practice, the bone openings will naturally engulf one another, and true *qi* and true power will flow unimpeded.\n\nThe chest should rise like *Gen* Mountain; the ribs respond to breath, their movement like *Zhen*—do not doubt it.\n\nThe chest takes its meaning from *Gen*, and *Gen* is mountain. One yang above two yins—its image is mountain, to which the human chest is likened. That which is rooted in Heaven and Earth clings to the upper *qi*; that which is rooted in Earth clings to the lower form. *Qi* tends toward floating and must be anchored; this is the inner meaning of the chest. Form tends toward sinking and must be uplifted; this is the outer meaning of the chest.\n\nThe chest’s *qi* ascends to the crown of the head—the crown is the *Qian* trigram, Heaven. Thus, when *Gen* meets Heaven, it becomes *Great Accumulation*: *qi* accumulates within and rises above. It descends to the feet and knees—the feet and knees are the *Kun* trigram, Earth. Thus, when Earth lies beneath mountain, it becomes *Modesty*: the *qi* of the feet embraces the chest, just as Earth, though lowly, embraces the mountain, and the mountain cannot but yield to it.\n\nThe ribs gather their image from *Zhen*, and *Zhen* is movement, thunder. One yang stirs beneath two yins—thunder bursts forth and surges upward; the ribs are likened to this, embodying the image of Heaven above and the meaning of Earth below. When Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang intersect, thunder and rain arise, and the myriad things are born. When the human body’s upper and lower unite, blood and *qi* flow, and true power emerges—this principle is one and the same.\n\nThe ribs’ *qi* ascends to meet the head, so when thunder encounters Heaven, it becomes *Great Strength*: true *qi* rises to the crown, vigorous from the outset, and power naturally becomes great. The ribs’ *qi* descends to meet the feet, so when thunder encounters Earth, it becomes *Delight*: true *qi* descends to the feet and knees, yielding in movement, and spirit and *qi* become joyful.\n\nWith each breath, each ascent and descent, the mouth and nose are outwardly visible, but inwardly, the heart and chest are essential—yet the crux lies in the ribs. The chest is emptiness; emptiness cannot exert force and must be governed by *qi*. Yet *qi* arises from the ribs—if the ribs are not employed, how can the chest be used? For that which is unequal in motion must also be unequal in stillness. The *Gen* trigram’s words say: “When it is time to move, move; when it is time to stop, stop.” Its meaning runs deep.\n\nThe ribs are harmony (*xie*): like a fish’s gills, opening and closing, *qi* ascends and descends. When closed, they harmonize below with the *dantian*, behind with the two kidneys. A single stream of great *qi* descends from beneath the skull, passing through the inner thighs to settle at the *Yongquan* point, then reverses upward along the great tendons of the feet, rising through the *Weizhong* points to penetrate the *Jiaji* via the *Weilü*, where it meets the ribs. When opened, it is like thunder surging from Earth to Heaven—its *qi* naturally ascends, one stream entering the chest and center, another entering the two backs, reaching the *Niwan* palace. Vertically, it rises straight to the crown; horizontally, it extends to the fingertips.\n\nThe ribs’ opening and closing are the *qi*’s breathing, circulating endlessly without reversal or disorder. Carefully ponder the meanings of *Gen* and *Zhen*’s top and bottom lines, and you will grasp the marvel of their upper and lower connection. The chest may protrude but not rise too high; the ribs may close but not constrict, may expand but not splay. Within this lies profound subtlety, difficult to convey by word alone.\n\nThe ribs must be guided by intent, overcome by *qi*, and led by spirit—this is the proper form, not by bone, flesh, or sinew. Employing the ribs is the opening and closing of *qi*’s breath; the hands’ entry and exit are opening and closing; the body’s vertical and horizontal movements are opening and closing. To seek this in bone, flesh, skin, or blood is mistaken.\n\nIn high stances, power lies in the feet; in middle stances, in the ribs; in low stances, in the back—this is the natural principle. *Kan* and *Li* are the images of water and fire: water aids fire, fire aids water. The heart and kidneys are the viscera of water and fire: water should ascend, fire should descend. The trigrams *Kan* and *Li* embody this inner meaning of the body—it can be grasped by intent but is hard to express in words. If I were to speak recklessly, I fear this Way would be lost. Now, from what cannot be spoken, I reluctantly put it into words—students must ponder it carefully.\n\n*Li* is fire; *Kan* is water. In the human body, they are the heart and kidneys. The kidneys belong to water, the heart to fire. Fire’s nature is to rise easily but descend with difficulty; water’s nature is to descend easily but ascend with difficulty. Thus, when the heart stirs, fire surges upward; when emotions stir, water sinks downward—this is the proof.\n\nFire must be aided by water to prevent yang excess and illness; water must be aided by fire to prevent yin excess and calamity. From ancient times, Confucians’ self-cultivation and Daoists’ inner alchemy have all been based on this principle—truly, its profundity is boundless. How could this concern only martial arts? Even in discussing martial valor, its benefits are immense.\n\nTo cultivate valor, one must study power; to study power, one must rely on *qi*; to rely on *qi*, one must clarify water and fire. For when water and fire fail to interact, true *qi* dissipates. When *qi* dissipates, illness arises, and the body cannot be preserved—how much less power? Thus, for martial valor, one must study power; to study power, one must nurture *qi*; to nurture *qi*, one must regulate water and fire—this is an unchanging principle.\n\nThe *Li* trigram has yin within and yang without—fire contains true water. The *Kan* trigram has yang within and yin without—water contains true fire. True fire can aid true water; true water can aid true fire. Only through mutual assistance and supplementation is true *qi* properly nurtured.\n\nWhen practicing, sinking the shoulders, hollowing the chest and ribs, and retracting the *guiwei* all aim to guide kidney *qi* upward to the heart. This must be directed by intent. Training the steps and gathering the sinews of the feet all aim to guide heart *qi* downward to the kidneys—this, too, must be directed by intent, achieving harmony in the circulation of *qi*’s patterns.\n\nFor those newly entering the practice of *qi* cultivation, each day at dawn, sit cross-legged in stillness, close the eyes, and seal the mouth. Gently regulate the breath, with every exhalation and inhalation conducted through the nostrils. After a short while, when the *qi* settles, draw in a breath and direct it into the *dantian*, aided by saliva thirty-six times over—thus true fire naturally descends.\n\nWhen inhaling, silently visualize true *qi* rising from the *yongquan* points, ascending through the flanks, from the flanks to the chest, from the chest to behind the ears, and gradually up to the *niwan*. When descending the *qi*, silently visualize true *qi* descending from the *niwan* to the *yintang*, from the *yintang* to the nostrils, from the nostrils to the throat, from the throat to the *jiaji*, from the *jiaji* penetrating the heart-center, and from the heart-center sinking straight into the *dantian*. When the *dantian*’s *qi* is full, it will naturally ascend from the *weilu* to the *jiaji*, and from the *jiaji* to the *niwan*. Once proficient, proceed to the methods of gathering and retaining *qi*.\n\n(*Nagua Jing* concludes; *Shen Yun Jing* to follow)\n\n**Shen Yun Jing**\n\nBy training the form, one achieves firmness;\nBy refining essence, one achieves solidity;\nBy cultivating *qi*, one achieves strength;\nBy refining spirit, one achieves flight.\n\nConsolidate form and *qi* as the foundation for horizontal and vertical movement;\nGather essence and spirit as the basis for soaring and leaping.\nThus, when form and *qi* flourish, one moves with power;\nWhen essence and spirit are concentrated, one soars and leaps.\n\n**Chapter One: The Substance of Spirit-Movement**\nFirst clarify the dynamics of advance and retreat,\nThen investigate the root of movement and stillness.\nAdvance arises from crouching before rising;\nRetreat departs only after merging.\nMovement takes stillness as its root—though the body may be swift, the mind remains at ease;\nStillness employs movement as its function—though *qi* gathers, the spirit soars.\nHaving grasped the subtlety of shifting and flickering,\nOne must understand the convergence of internal and external breath.\n\"Horizontal and vertical\" refers to the strength of linear force;\n\"Flying and leaping\" refers to the profundity of *qi*.\n\n**Chapter Two: The Form of Spirit-Movement**\nStriking an opponent involves the timing of form, *qi*, and spirit—fast or slow;\nBeing attacked involves collapse, timidity, or dissolution—shallow or deep.\nStriking with form against form: the body arrives later, yet prevails;\nStriking with *qi* against *qi*: the hand moves first, yet inspires awe;\nStriking with spirit against spirit: the body has not yet moved, yet overcomes the opponent.\nWhen form is struck by form, the body is injured and collapses to the ground;\nWhen *qi* is struck by *qi*, the *qi* is injured and the heart falters;\nWhen spirit is struck by spirit, the spirit is injured and the gall dissolves.\n\n**Chapter Three: The Application of Spirit-Movement**\n\"Horizontal and vertical\" refers to the opening and closing of the flanks;\n\"Flying and leaping\" refers to the breath between *dantian* and exhalation.\nAdvance and retreat follow the hands’ extension and withdrawal;\nComing and going accord with the natural flow of *qi*.\n*Qi* should be full, while spirit should be restrained;\nThe body must be stable, and the steps firm.\nNeither lose balance through lightness,\nNor through overreaching.\nSwift as the flight of an eagle or falcon,\nFierce as the strength of a tiger or leopard.\n\n**Chapter Four: The Principle of Substance and Application**\nA mountain that does not sweat will crumble;\nA tree without roots will topple;\nWater without a source will dry up—\nThe same holds for cultivation.\nThose who wish to practice the *Shen Yun Jing*\nMust first master the *Neigong Jing*, *Nagua Jing*, and the subtleties of the Twelve Great Strengths in their entirety,\nOnly then may they study this.\nOtherwise, it will not only be of no benefit but may cause harm.\n\nWhen practicing this method, remember:\nNever use high stances,\nNor single-leg stances.\nAssume the horse-riding posture,\nStabilizing the entire body.\nPay particular attention to the soles of the feet,\nAnchoring the original *qi* of the *dantian*.\nWith each exhalation, advance;\nWith each inhalation, retreat.\nWhen advancing, both feet rise together;\nWhen retreating, both feet land together—\nThis principle must never be altered.\nYet in application, depending on the opponent’s formation,\nOne must adapt to changes in height, distance, emptiness, and solidity—\nRigidity must be avoided.\n\nBetween hardness and softness, movement and stillness,\nLies the pivot of success or failure—\nHow can one not be cautious?\n\nOne must move the body without disturbing the mind,\nMove the mind without disturbing the *qi*.\nOnly then will the mind be still and the steps firm,\nThe *qi* calm and the body stable,\nAllowing the spirit to soar and transform.\nTruly, to know stillness as stillness is to know that movement, too, is stillness;\nTo know movement as movement is to know that stillness, too, is movement.\nFor it is stillness that employs movement,\nNot movement that employs stillness.\n\nIn the dynamics of spirit,\nThe spirit is slow while the eyes are swift;\nThe mind is slow while the hands are swift;\nThe *qi* is slow while the steps are swift.\nFor the outer is swift while the inner is slow,\nThe inner is soft while the outer is hard—\nThus one grasps the subtlety of substance and application.\n\nAh! Only by using softness to employ hardness is true hardness achieved;\nOnly by using slowness to employ speed is true speed attained.\nThe subtlety of this lies beyond appearances,\nAnd cannot be sought in mere form.\nThrough prolonged study of the *Shen Yun* method,\nThe practitioner will naturally awaken to its profound principles.\n\n**Annotations on the Twelve Great Internal Strengths**\n\n1. **Root-Tempering**: Steady steps like a mountain\n2. **Knee-Strengthening**: Knees firm and straight as pillars\n3. **Crotch and Hips**: Inner and outer alignment\n4. **Chest and Back**: Hardness and softness in harmony\n5. **Head**: Upright and angled for striking\n6. **Three Gates**: Shoulders firm, adhering to the back\n7. **Two Gates**: Horizontal and vertical use of the elbows\n8. **Bone-Piercing**: Breaking the opponent’s strength\n9. **Bone-Sealing**: Blocking the opponent’s lower body\n10. **Inner-Sweeping**: Striking the opponent’s interior\n11. **Outer-Blocking**: Deflecting the opponent’s exterior\n12. **Upward-Lifting**: Attacking above and below, inside and out as one\n\n**First Great Strength: Root-Tempering**\n\"Root\" refers to the feet;\n\"Tempering\" means grounding them.\nWhen facing an opponent,\nNo matter how force is applied,\nRemaining immovably stable is the work of root-tempering.\nIts methods are all found in the internal classics;\nExternally, there are two applications:\nTo hook the opponent’s hands or feet, curl the toes inward and overcome with external strength;\nTo block the opponent’s feet, sink the crotch’s strength fully into the ground and prevail with internal strength.\n\n**Second Great Strength: Knee-Strengthening**\n\"Firmness\" arises naturally after applying internal work.\n\n**External Applications (Two Methods):**\nWhen the opponent attacks the upper body at close range, use *lifting-knee*; when attacking below, use *kneeling-knee*. Both adapt to the opponent’s angle—whether level or slanted—changing spontaneously without fixed form.\n\n**Third Great Strength: Crotch and Hips**\n\"Crotch\" refers to the inner crotch; \"hips\" to the outer hips. When two opponents close in, sink the body’s full strength downward—both inner crotch and outer hips can overcome the foe. However, this requires perfect alignment of posture; forced execution will fail entirely. Details are found in the classics.\n\n**Fourth Great Strength: Chest and Back**\nOnce internal work is mastered, the chest and back both possess great strength to subdue an opponent. There is no particular subtlety: when blocking the opponent’s hands, use the back to yield space, preventing their attack.\n\n**Fifth Great Strength: Head**\nWith internal work accomplished, not only can the chest and back subdue, but even the head may secure victory. Its applications are two: *side-butting* and *frontal-butting*.\n- *Side-butting*: When the opponent is before you, turn sideways and strike.\n- *Frontal-butting*: When the opponent is above you, strike directly upward.\nYet one must also guard against the opponent’s hands.\n\n**Sixth Great Strength: Three Gates**\n\"Three Gates\" refers to the shoulders. Three methods employ the shoulders: keep the hands drawn in, pressed close to the thighs, and apply with small body movements. Whether used sideways, level, above, or below, all belong to the *scattered and closed gates* of combat—difficult to exhaust in writing. Generally, they require internal work to be effective.\n\n**Seventh Great Strength: Two Gates**\n\"Two Gates\" refers to the elbows. This strength is the swiftest of the Twelve Great Strengths to achieve. Its applications are two: *horizontal-elbow* and *vertical-elbow*.\n- *Vertical-elbow*: Raise the hand beside the face and strike with the elbow.\n- *Horizontal-elbow*: Hold the hand before the chest and strike with the elbow.\nThough methods vary, all derive from these.\n\n**Eighth Great Strength: Piercing Bone**\nWhen the opponent attacks from above, extend the entire body with full force forward to pierce through. Their strength will break, and you will secure complete victory. However, the fighting stance must rise from the side, the rear foot pressing forward to drive the front foot’s piercing force—otherwise, it blends with the *through-punch*.\n\n**Ninth Great Strength: Hardening Bone**\nWhen the opponent attacks from below, seal one of their hands with yours, then drop the entire body’s force fiercely to achieve total victory. The stance must rise from the side to execute this properly. The hardness’s degree depends entirely on the depth of internal work.\n\n**Tenth Great Strength: Inner-Sweeping**\nWhen the opponent attacks from within, overcome them with *sweeping strength*. Its applications are three:\n- *Upper-sweep* breaks the opponent’s upper-route strength,\n- *Middle-sweep* breaks their middle-route strength,\n- *Lower-sweep* breaks their lower-route strength.\nAll seal the opponent’s hands before use.\n\n**Eleventh Great Strength: Outer-Blocking Strength**\nWhen the opponent attacks from the outer gate, overcome them with *blocking strength*. This also divides into *upper-block*, *middle-block*, and *lower-block*. Yet with internal work mastered, one need not rigidly adhere: if distant, block the opponent’s hands; if near, block their body. There is no place that cannot be blocked—let the practitioner grasp this intuitively.\n\n**Twelfth Great Strength: Lifting-Attack**\nHarden the hand’s tip through internal work, like the motion of lifting an object, to strike the opponent. Once this strength is achieved, a mere touch can hurl them several paces away. The hand must not extend too far—let the opponent be just an inch away before lifting for optimal effect. If they are too distant, advance with steps.

Regardless of the opponent’s height, reach, or power, all can be overcome with *ground-attacking strength*. For humans, the upper body is often solid, while the lower body is often weak. Even in ordinary sparring, attacking below is more effective than attacking above—how much more so against those with great internal power! However, to practice this method, one must first master the *Internal Power Classic*, *Trigram Absorption Classic*, and *Spiritual Movement Classic*, training them to proficiency before applying the *Earth Dragon Classic*. Otherwise, the forms will be empty, and the secrets contained within the classics will remain unknown.\n\nThough the *Earth Dragon Classic* forms a complete system, its principles interweave with the *qi* channels and connections of the *Internal Power*, *Trigram Absorption*, and *Spiritual Movement Classics*, mutually reinforcing each other. Scholars must not overlook this. The *Earth Dragon* system is entirely encompassed by the two words: *ground attack*. Though it contains boundless discussions, principles, methods, and transformations, all emerge from these two words.\n\n**Second Section**\n*Train the entire body on the ground to strengthen essence and clarity*. When facing an opponent, do not merely train the soles of the feet—lying fully on the ground further trains *qi*, blood, sinews, and spirit, enabling the use of whole-body power in all directions. Only then can one control and release. Training *qi* solidifies, training sinews strengthens, and training spirit sharpens. This work lies in daily practice, as described in the classics—do not resort to heterodox methods.\n\n**Third Section**\n*Extension can become contraction; stillness can become movement. Contraction resembles a crouching tiger; extension compares to a soaring dragon. Movement and stillness leave no trace; contraction and extension conceal their tracks.*\n\nThis means that when the opponent approaches, I immediately lower my body to the ground. Press both hands forward on the ground while the soles of the feet remain planted, then lift the entire body to hover above the earth. From there, respond to the opponent’s position and apply techniques freely—this is the standard method. If using contraction, gather whole-body power and drag backward with both hands to rise from a crouch. If extending, thrust forward with both feet to strike the opponent. There is no fixed pattern for movement or stillness; adapt to the opponent’s actions. When they are still, I move—all to prevent the opponent from discerning my traces.\n\nOccasionally, contract the body so that neither hands nor feet are visible, concealing oneself with full power. Rest the head upon the hands to observe the opponent’s strength and weakness, assuming the posture of a crouching tiger. Hands and feet remain capable of striking the enemy as if rising to stand normally. When leaping, extend the entire body straight—whether turning or rolling, one can still subdue the opponent. Rising and twisting freely, one crouches like a soaring dragon.\n\nThus, to crouch one must first leap, and to leap one must first crouch. Crouching is the momentum of leaping, and leaping is the mechanism of crouching. One leap and one crouch, one extension and one contraction—transformation appears.\n\n**Fourth Technique**\nThe body is firm as iron, the method dense as a dragon, overturning like fierce tigers and leopards, turning swift as falcons and eagles. This technique emphasizes the four characters: firmness, density, swiftness, and ferocity. Yet without comprehending the entire system of the Four Classics, one cannot grasp its subtlety. Only after thoroughly understanding the Four Classics and then applying them can one act freely.\n\nFor if not dense, one loses; if not firm, one falters. Once the body touches the ground, the enemy is drawn into one’s trap and cannot escape. Moreover, one must overturn with the ferocity of tigers and leopards, and coil with the swiftness of falcons and eagles—only then will there be no gaps. Otherwise, even if the enemy is caught in the technique, one cannot achieve the desired effect.\n\nTurning and rolling, crouching and rising, constitute the *overturning force*; left and right rotations constitute the *shifting force*. When rotating, both feet extend straight; when overturning, slightly bend one foot—only then can vertical and horizontal forces remain distinct and unconfused.\n\n**Fifth Technique**\nDistinguish clearly between front and back, left and right. When the enemy approaches head-on, throw the entire body backward to land behind them, leaving them no time to react. This is called *forward collapse*; otherwise, falling backward onto the ground would place one at a disadvantage, with the enemy controlling from afar while one controls from close range. The subsequent method is called *backward collapse*. As for front, back, left, and right, these rely on the skill of leaping and dodging.\n\nIf the enemy attacks directly, shift the entire body outward—left or right—to make their strike miss, then immediately drop to the ground. Seize the moment to apply techniques; by the time the enemy adjusts their stance, they will have already fallen into one’s method. A single collapse secures victory—one need not meticulously distinguish front, back, left, or right to reach this realm of transformation.\n\n**Sixth Technique**\nThe stance has variations, the method has no fixed form. The *stance* refers to the posture one adopts: crouching can shift to rising, rising to crouching; side can become reverse, reverse can become side—these are the rules for establishing stances according to the moment, not to be rigidly adhered to.\n\nAs for the method, there is no set pattern: sometimes the method follows the stance, sometimes the stance follows the method, and at times the method departs from the stance or the stance from the method—all depends on daily mastery of the Four Classics. Only with profound understanding can one respond naturally in the moment. Without it, even with verbal instruction, one cannot grasp the essence, let alone through mere observation.\n\nTurning, rolling, crouching, and rising are the *stances*; hand and foot attacks are the *methods*. When the stance is near, the method changes; when the method is near, the stance changes. Endless coiling gives rise to layers of subtle techniques.\n\n**Seventh Technique**\nFrontal attacks employ the palm; the second and third stances share this principle. A *frontal attack* means when the enemy is before you, respond by attacking with your front. Use the palm—regardless of left or right—first seal their heel with one hand, then with the upper hand forcefully bend their knee outward from the inside. Alternatively, use both hands to seal their feet. The upper three stances fiercely attack the *Zusanli* point.\n\nIf the enemy’s foot is near your chest, swiftly bend your three stances from top to bottom to strike their instep—this too can secure victory. The second stance method is most effective when executed swiftly. If the enemy presses too close, guard against their foot attack, which is why the *dispersing stance* should not be used lightly.\n\n**Eighth Technique**\nRear attacks employ the foot; both heel and knee are applicable. When the enemy is below you, respond by attacking with your lower body. Use the foot—regardless of left or right—first entangle one of their feet, then advance the other foot to forcefully strike their knee. Whether turning, rolling, crouching, or rising, left or right, up or down, one can bend, extend, rotate, and maneuver freely. Success requires exhausting all subtleties without the slightest obstruction to be considered proper.\n\nWhen using the heel: if the enemy’s step is slightly distant and your foot can reach but not entangle, there is no need for entanglement. Simply lift one foot into the air and strike their instep from above. If they retract, immediately launch the other foot to strike again. If the enemy’s step is near your crotch, there is no need to switch to the previous method—simply use a kneeling strike to their instep to secure victory.\n\nThe above six methods are also mentioned in the *Neigong Dispersing Stance*, but all derive from this entanglement—there is no separate doctrine. The *heel* refers to the high bone at the back of the foot. Though described as striking from above, it is actually a diagonal strike, not a direct one. *Kneeling* refers to both knees. When using them, do not lift too high—excessive height renders the strike weak and powerless.\n\n**Ninth Technique**\nWhen distant, pursue and strike; when near, intercept. If the enemy suddenly retreats, do not allow them to withdraw freely—pursue them. However, pursuit does not require changing to a high stance; press both hands to the ground, lift the crotch, and extend both feet forward from beneath it—greater distance is preferable.\n\nIf the feet have already closed in the previous stance, bend the entire body and propel forward with both hands—this too can close the distance, with greater distance being ideal. When pursuing and applying techniques, freely alternate among the six methods above. If, just as you set the technique, the enemy suddenly advances, do not dodge left, right, front, or back.\n\n**Following the Momentum to Apply Technique**\nSeize the opportunity to engage with method—do not wait for the enemy to steady their stance and settle into position before advancing swiftly, for this is the way to ensure no technique misses its mark. The method of pursuit shares the same principle as *Divine Qi Circulation*, relying entirely on the two characters \"suspended crotch.\" If the whole body lacks great strength, and the hands do not press firmly into the earth, the crotch cannot be suspended—how then could the feet leap and pursue at a distance? Only after internal skill and *Divine Qi Circulation* are thoroughly refined can this technique reveal its wonders.\n\n**Tenth Technique**\n*The Greater Hip Rests on the Ground, the Body Forms a Sideways Stance*\nThe \"greater hip\" refers to the outer hip bone. \"The greater hip rests on the ground\" means establishing a sideways stance on one’s side. Whenever employing this sideways falling stance, the tip of the single hip bone must touch the ground, both hands lightly pressing into the earth, while feet and knees lift entirely—thus enabling sinuous bending, stretching, and rolling movements, all derived from the sideways stance. In this technique, the hands must press lightly into the ground; if they bear weight, they become cumbersome. Press and lift in alternation, and the whole body will remain agile. One may also use only the two \"gates\" (hands) to touch the ground, allowing the feet to execute techniques freely as the situation demands.\n\n**Eleventh Technique**\n*Reclining as if Seated, the Tailbone Alone Bears the Weight*\nWhen a person reclines on the ground, none do not sit with their entire buttocks. Yet to sit with the buttocks is to collapse the stance. To execute techniques, only the tip of the tailbone should touch the ground, while hands, feet, and body all lift—uniting the entire posture. Turn left to move left, turn right to move right, and apply techniques at will, all striking the vital points. One may also use only the hands to press into the ground, suspending the lower body to execute techniques and control the opponent. However, this is not as fluid or wondrous as the fully lifted posture, where above, both hands may be employed, and below, both feet—far more versatile and marvelous. Mastering this technique allows left and right spiraling, always centered on the vital pivot. Its subtlety defies description. Yet one must understand its principle: the tailbone serves as the pivot. If the buttocks press fully into the ground, the technique is lost entirely.\n\n**Twelfth Technique**\n*Height and Depth at Will, Distance and Range Unrestrained*\nSome believe this method is limited to ground-level maneuvers, unable to rise for high attacks. Yet who knows that falling and rising at will, leaping and crouching freely, are the very essence of this classic? Any forced movement deviates from the proper form. To execute rising techniques, subtly bend one foot beneath you, gathering the body’s full power from the ground, assisted by both hands or a single hand. Regardless of left or right, reversal or forward lean, the body will naturally rise and fall at will. As for \"unrestrained range,\" employ the high stance to leap outward, use the *Earth Dragon Classic* stance to retract, and deploy the *Earth Dragon* stance to extend—high to strike the enemy above, low to strike below. The key is to conceal all traces, ensuring movements are firm, swift, and fierce. This technique entirely follows the principles of *Divine Qi Circulation*. One who has thoroughly studied *Divine Qi Circulation* will grasp its unrestrained, soaring momentum, comprehend the principles of refining qi and spirit, and naturally achieve seamless mastery.\n\n*(The Orthodox Stances of the Scattered Gates to be continued)*\n*The Orthodox Stances of the Scattered Gates*\n\n**First Stance: Opponent Advances with Right Step and Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent advances with a right step and lifting force (*liao jin*), I use my right hand to intercept their arm, guiding it from above downward and flinging it outward in one motion. Their flank will naturally expose itself. I then swiftly advance with my left *di lian* to seal their right step, employing the full techniques of the Second and Third Gates to attack from the side.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nThis method requires adhering closely to the opponent’s back, using a compact body technique to lift upward—only then is it effective. As the opponent attacks, seize the moment they lower their stance, swiftly execute the right *ju bu* and the full *di lian* force to drive outward, raising the right hand to strike their back with a sweeping force (*lüe jin*). The three forces must be applied simultaneously to prevail.\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nThis is a method for countering upward. When employing it, the legs must be fully extended, channeling the body’s *qi* in a backward diagonal pull—only then will it succeed. Otherwise, if the opponent possesses *di lian* skill, they will not be easily broken.\n\nIf struck on the back, the opponent will inevitably fall forward. Then, seal their right foot with your left, using the *Earth Dragon* ground-rising technique to strike their right leg with a left parry for victory.\n\n**Right, Chapter Three:**\nThis is a \"one counters two\" maneuver. When lowering the body, precision is essential—if you collapse entirely to the ground, rising again will be difficult. Some say employing the Third Gate is even more effective: as the opponent uses the *Earth Dragon* rising technique, before they fully recover, stabilize your right step with *di lian* force, lift your left knee, and strike their left flank for victory.\n\n**Right, Chapter Four:**\nThis is a \"two counters one\" maneuver. Strike precisely as they begin to rise but have not yet fully recovered. If the opponent lifts their left knee, I do not advance; instead, I follow their knee’s forward motion, collapsing outward and rolling the body to adopt the *Crouching Dragon* technique for victory.\n\n**Right, Chapter Five:**\nThis method requires mastery of the *Earth Dragon* technique to be effective. Without it, the timing of rising and falling will be unclear, inviting only ridicule—how can one hope to prevail? After collapsing, one must gather spirit and *qi*, observing the opponent’s movements to launch an attack.\n\nIf the opponent, seeing my position, advances with a low stance and lifting force, I immediately use a left parry to deflect their left hand, then follow with my right hand to strike their chest for victory.\n\n**Right, Chapter Six:**\nThis is a variation building on the previous stance, without profound meaning—only firmness and speed are required.\n\n---\n\n**Second Stance: Opponent Advances with Right Step and Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent advances with a right step and lifting force, I use a left parry (*ge jin*), deflecting their right wrist outward from within. I then advance with my right *di lian*, sealing their right step from without, and apply a right seizing force (*qin jin*) to trap their Third Gate. The three forces must be applied simultaneously to prevail.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nWhen executing this method, the left deflecting hand must be lifted with full force—this will naturally uproot their footing. Both hands and feet must advance together for optimal effect; otherwise, the opponent may retract their leg.\n\nIf the opponent throws me down, I immediately use my right foot’s hooking force (*gou jin*) to entangle their right foot, lowering my body into the full *Earth Dragon* stance. Pressing both hands to the ground and driving with my left foot’s *di* force, I strike their right shin, ensuring their defeat.\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nWhen employing this method, the right leg must be sharply bent while the left leg remains fully extended—only then can the body’s *qi* be properly circulated for effectiveness.\n\nIf the opponent advances with lifting force and I retreat with a right step and parry, but their right hand has already withdrawn, my strike will miss. I then advance to entangle their left hand, lowering my body to attack their flank with the left Third Gate for victory.\n\n**Right, Chapter Three:**\nThis is a variation for attacking downward. Strike swiftly as the opponent retreats, preventing their footwork from settling—this is the method of exploiting emptiness.\n\n---\n\n**Third Stance: Opponent Advances with Right Step and Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent advances with a right step and lifting force, I stealthily advance a small left step, using a left sweeping force (*lüe jin*) to lift their right hand while keeping my body still. If they strike with their left hand, I seize the moment of their extension, swiftly twisting my body to crouch within the Inner Gate, gathering force to attack their flank with the left Third Gate for victory.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nWhen advancing the left step, the posture must already be primed for attack—only by concealing intent will its subtlety be revealed.\n\n---\n\n**Fourth Stance: Opponent Advances with High Right Step and Sweeping Force**\n\nWhen the opponent advances with a high right step and sweeping force, I use a right parry to deflect upward, then advance my left step to intercept and seize them.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nThis method requires the left *di lian* to be firmly grounded to secure victory; otherwise, against a strong opponent, both may collapse together. If the opponent seals my body with their left step and attacks with a pulling force (*ba jin*), I twist my body and strike their inner knee with a firm knee force (*jian xi jin*).\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nThis is a method for countering upward. Strike precisely as the opponent advances with their left step—if they seize you first, escape will be impossible.\n\nIf the opponent attacks my left knee with a firm knee force, I swiftly shift my left step outward, lowering my body to anchor my neck and strike their right flank with my nape.\n\n**Right, Chapter Three:**\nThis is a \"one counters two\" maneuver. The entire body’s stance must be stabilized, using a compact body technique to attack—only then will it be effective.\n\n---\n\n**Fifth Stance: Opponent Advances with High Stance and Dual-Handed Upper Attack**\n\nWhen the opponent advances with a high stance and attacks my upper body with both hands, I use my left hand to coil downward and trap their left hand, and my right hand to coil downward and trap their right hand. Stealthily advancing my left step, I surge forward with my body to strike their chest with chest force (*xiong jin*).\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nThis is a method for attacking the opponent with the entire body—do not confine it to chest force alone. If the opponent attacks from below, this method may still be used, but the hands must coil downward. When sealing the opponent’s hands, ensure they are firmly trapped to prevent withdrawal and counterattacks.\n\n**When the opponent seals both my hands with theirs and attacks with chest force (*xiong jin*), leaving me unable to move my hands and with no time to delay—for even the slightest hesitation will allow the opponent to prevail—I must stealthily raise my right knee to strike upward into their groin and secure victory.**\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nThis is the *firm-knee groin lift* (*jianxi liaoyin*). It must be applied with careful judgment, for excessive force may endanger life. Exercise utmost caution.\n\n---\n\n**Sixth Stance: Opponent Advances with High Stance and Right-Step Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent advances with a high stance and delivers a right-step lifting force (*liao jin*), I use my right *blocking force* (*ge jin*) to cast upward and deflect their right hand, then employ my left *bottom-refining force* (*dilian jin*) below to seal their right step. Twisting my body, I strike with *Three Gates force* (*sanmen jin*) to prevail.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nThis method requires mobilizing the *qi* of the entire body, keeping the shoulders and back aligned, and attacking with short force. Without waiting for the opponent to employ *Three Gates force*, I press my right hand against their right hand, intercept their left step, then cast their right hand with my left. Executing all three forces simultaneously, I throw them to the right.\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nThe timing of this method must be neither too early nor too late. If applied too soon, the opponent will retreat in alarm; if too late, I will miss the moment to act. It must be deployed precisely as their momentum arises.\n\nIf the opponent attempts to shift their foot, I swiftly cast their right wrist with my right hand and their right elbow with my left, while using my left foot to seal their right step, throwing them to the left.\n\n**Right, Chapter Three:**\nThis variation attacks downward, adapting the opponent’s method by shifting it to the left. When throwing, their arm must be bent against their chest.\n\n---\n\n**Seventh Stance: Opponent Assumes Horse-Riding Stance and Delivers Right Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent adopts a horse-riding stance and delivers a right lifting force, I immediately shift my step to the right, using my hands to drive my entire body forcefully toward the ground. Rising with the momentum, I employ a compact body method to strike their abdomen with both hands.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nThis method requires angling the body to attack their flank diagonally upward, seizing my solidity to exploit their emptiness.\n\n---\n\n**Eighth Stance: Opponent Delivers Right-Step Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent delivers a right-step lifting force, I use my left *firm-bone* (*jiangu*) to intercept their hand from inside to outside, then rotate my entire body. With my left foot, I coil their right step from outside to inside, and strike their chest with left *blocking force*, employing all three forces in unison.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nThis method demands short force above and below. If long force is used, the opponent may be defeated, but I will not emerge unscathed.\n\nIf the opponent advances with their left step intending to block, I withdraw my right hand and step back with my left, coiling their left step from outside to inside. Then, I seize their right ribs with my left hand and drag outward with both forces.\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nThis is the method of returning upward. It requires clear evasion, first establishing an unassailable position. When executing the right *seizing force*, the entire body’s *qi* must be mobilized.\n\n---\n\n**Ninth Stance: Opponent Delivers Low Right-Hand Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent delivers a low right-hand lifting force, I advance with my right *firm-bone force* to seal their hand. Then, I grasp their hair with my left hand and seize their chin with my right, employing both forces simultaneously.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nThis method contains true subtlety. Do not use excessive force. When sealing their hand, coil their step from the outer gate with your right foot to prevent their retreat.\n\nIf the opponent advances with a high right step and lifting force, I move from the outer gate inward, using my right *blocking force* to deflect their hand. Seizing the moment, I advance my left step and hook their nose bridge from behind their chest with my left hand, applying my entire body’s skill to snap their neck backward.\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nThis is a variation of the previous method. When applying it, ensure the neck is bent toward the opponent’s chest—never to the left, or they will slip free.\n\n---\n\n**Tenth Stance: Opponent Delivers Right-Step Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent delivers a right-step lifting force, I advance my left step with *bottom-refining force* to seal their right foot from outside to inside. Then, I advance my left hand from above to cast their right hand downward, using force to drag it down. Following this, I advance my right hand from above to strike diagonally at their neck.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nWhen casting their hand, if they resist with upward force, making it difficult to drag downward, I instead lift their right hand from below and flip it upward, then advance my right hand to strike their face.\n\nIf the opponent advances their right hand to strike while my hand is already cast and difficult to withdraw, I crouch inward, advance my left step into a kneeling position, and drive my right hand into their chest with the entire body’s force.\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nWhen dropping the left step, evade the opponent’s right hand to establish an unassailable position, ensuring the knee bears force.\n\nIf the opponent attempts to strike my chest, I withdraw both hands, then collapse to the ground. Assuming the *Earth Dragon* (*dilong*) posture, I propel my body forward with full force, using my right foot to sweep their right foot.\n\n**Right, Chapter Three:**\nWhen lunging, the spine must be forcefully lowered, the right foot acting as a step while the left leg extends straight, then sharply bent inward to maximize force.\n\nIf the opponent sweeps my right foot, causing me to fall backward, I do not wait for them to rise. Instead, I roll to the side, pressing both hands to the ground, and employ the *Earth Dragon* posture to rise, striking their left shin with my left foot.\n\n**Right, Chapter Four:**\nThis method requires full extension, striking downward with the left foot from above.\n\n---\n\n**Eleventh Stance: Opponent Delivers Right-Step Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent delivers a right-step lifting force, I immediately crouch backward, pressing both hands to the ground. Assuming the *Earth Dragon* posture, I swing my right leg upward from above to strike their shin.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nWhen applying this method, mobilize the *qi* of the entire body and attack with *firm-bone force*. If the right hand misses, roll the body and strike with the left heel from inside to outside, also employing an upward-to-downward motion.\n\n**Twelfth Stance: Opponent Advances with Right-Step Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent advances with a right-step lifting force, I step forward with my right foot, sweeping their hand from inside to outside. Then, I reverse and step forward with my left foot, pressing my back against their chest from below. Crouching, I use both hands to seize their right foot, employing the *Central Full Stance* to crush their knee.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nWhen applying this method, ensure close adherence to prevent their retreat. The left step must be precisely measured so their right foot is exposed before you. When crushing the knee, direct their kneecap upward to shatter the bone—do not allow their *Weizhong* point to face upward, lest I lose leverage.\n\nIf the opponent seeks to crush my knee, I immediately seize their hair, using my left hand to forcefully grip their chin. Employing the *Full-Back Stance*, I break their neck with full-body force.\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nThis must be executed the moment their grasp is unstable. Since their hands target the lower body, I exploit their upper vulnerability—victory is assured. However, if their movement is too swift, I may be unable to react.\n\n---\n\n**Thirteenth Stance: Opponent Wields Blade for a Frontal Thrust**\n\nWhen the opponent thrusts a blade toward my face, I must not retreat. Swiftly sidestepping, I advance my left foot and use my left hand to parry their right wrist from outside to inside. Then, I strike upward with my right hand to their face.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nThis method may also employ the middle and index fingers to pierce their nostrils or strike their eyes—adapt based on the urgency of the situation.\n\n---\n\n**Fourteenth Stance: Opponent Advances with Right-Step Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent advances with a right-step lifting force, I seize their hand with my left, crouch, and use my right hand to hook their right shin. As I lift, I twist their shin with both hands, then drive forward with my full-body force to strike them.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nWhether hooking with the left hand or targeting either leg, the principle remains the same.\n\n---\n\n**Fifteenth Stance: Opponent Advances with Right-Step Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent advances with a right-step lifting force, I step forward with my right foot, crouch, and use both hands to seal their right foot. I attack their *Tiger-Shin Bone* with *Three-Gate Force*.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nWhen sealing both feet, ensure thorough defense to prevent the opponent from seizing the opportunity to kick my face.\n\nIf the opponent seals my right foot and prepares to attack with *Three-Gate Force*, I strike their right ribs with my right knee as their foot descends.\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nIf overpowered and thrown, I must not use my knee—instead, I kick upward with my right foot.\n\n---\n\n**Sixteenth Stance: Opponent Delivers Right-Step Sweeping Force**\n\nWhen the opponent delivers a right-step sweeping force, I twist their right hand upward with both hands, step forward with my right foot to seal their right foot from outside to inside, and hurl them leftward with my full-body *qi*.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nThis method requires wrenching their right wrist with all force to break their momentum. It may be applied to both inner and outer gates—if used on the inner gate, seal with the left foot from inside to outside.\n\n---\n\n**Seventeenth Stance: Opponent Advances with Right-Step Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent advances with a right-step lifting force, I also step forward with my right foot, using *Blocking Force* to deflect their hand. Following through, I seize their shoulder, then grasp their heel with my left hand and hurl them outward with my full-body force.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nWhen applying this method, step into the opponent’s inner gate. The *Blocking Force* must rise from below and overturn from within the abdomen.\n\nIf thrown by the opponent, my chest must not touch the ground. Instead, I press both hands to the earth, assume the *Earth Dragon’s* side posture, and strike their groin with a flying right hand.\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nThe flying kick employs the *Earth Dragon’s* turning motion—though it lacks profound intent, mastery of the *Earth Dragon* technique is essential.\n\n---\n\n**Eighteenth Stance: Opponent Advances with Right-Step Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent advances with a right-step lifting force, I neither advance nor retreat. Instead, I root my left foot firmly, then kick upward with my right leg, driving my full-body force straight into their chest.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nThis method is effective only for those with skill. The left foot must be rooted to defend, and the right foot must be rooted to strike—otherwise, victory is uncertain.\n\nIf the opponent strikes my ribs with their right foot, I do not retreat. Instead, I root both feet firmly, using my chest and ribs to drive outward and strike their foot.\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nThis method demands even greater skill—students must not imitate it carelessly.\n\n---\n\n**Nineteenth Stance: Opponent Delivers Right-Step Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent delivers a right-step lifting force, I shift my entire body to evade their hand. Following the momentum, I step forward with my right foot and use my right hand’s *Blocking Force* to intercept their waist. Then, I seize their hair with my left hand and forcefully break their neck downward.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nWhen blocking, the motion must descend from above. Step into the opponent’s inner gate to prevent their retreat. For those with skill, a horizontal block to their right hand, pinning it at the waist, is even more effective.\n\n---\n\n**Twentieth Stance: Opponent Advances with Right-Step Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent advances with a right-step lifting force, I crouch and first bind their heel with my left hand, then use my right hand to sweep their knee outward with force.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nWhen sweeping the knee, target the inner side—sweeping the kneecap will fail.\n\nIf the opponent crouches to strike my knee, I also crouch, step forward with my left foot, and kneel to strike their back from above with my full-body force.\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nThis exploits their upper vulnerability—most effective.\n\nIf the opponent attempts to crouch and strike my back, I do not wait for them to complete their stance. Instead, I drive upward with my full-body force, attacking their chest and abdomen with *Second- and Third-Gate Force*.\n\n**Right, Chapter Three:**\nWhenever crouching to enter the lower path, if the opponent targets my upper body, this method may be applied.\n\n**Twenty-First Technique:**\nWhen the opponent advances in *Horse-Riding Stance* with a right sweeping force, I step forward with my right foot, sealing their right hand from outside to inside. Using my left hand, I cast off their right hand and tuck it beneath my flank, then twist my body to strike their neck with my right hand.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nStep forward with the right foot, entering the inner gate. If the upper path is blocked by the opponent’s left hand, immediately use *Firm Knee Force* to seize their inner knee in the lower path.\n\n**Twenty-Second Technique:**\nWhen the opponent strikes from *Horse-Riding Stance* with a right upward force, I seal their right hand from above with my left hand, then sidestep and advance to execute a *Low Refinement Slash* against their instep.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nWhen using *Low Refinement*, ensure the *Yongquan* point has an inward momentum—only then does the \"slash\" achieve its meaning.\n\n**Scattered Variations:**\n**First Variation:**\nIf the opponent uses the first technique’s first chapter, I counter with the twelfth technique’s first chapter.\n\n**Second Variation:**\nIf the opponent uses the first technique’s second chapter, I counter with the tenth technique’s third chapter.\n\n**Third Variation:**\nIf the opponent uses the first technique’s fifth chapter and pursues to strike, I shift into *Small Body Method* and attack with both hands.\n\n**Fourth Variation:**\nIf the opponent uses the second technique’s first chapter, I counter with *Left Firm Bone Force*, casting off their shoulder and striking with my right hand in a unified body-and-hand thrust to the left.\n\n**Fifth Variation:**\nIf the opponent uses the third technique’s first chapter, I counter with the sixth technique’s second chapter.\n\n**Sixth Variation:**\nIf the opponent uses the fourth technique’s second chapter, I swiftly open my left step outward, crouch, and use my left hand to cast off their right knee while my right hand seizes their heel—both forces applied simultaneously.\n\n**Seventh Variation:**\nIf the opponent uses the fifth technique’s second chapter, I tilt my body and lift, meeting them with my right knee, which naturally drives theirs outward. I then follow the momentum to strike their groin with my right knee.\n\n**Eighth Variation:**\nIf I use the sixth technique’s third chapter but the opponent’s strength is overwhelming and I cannot move, I yield to their force, extend their elbow, and hurl them to the right.\n\n**Ninth Variation:**\nIf the opponent uses the seventh technique’s first chapter, I swiftly advance my right foot, using *Firm Knee Force* from inside to outside to break their left knee, then shift into a right-hand *Sealing Force* to strike their chest and hand in one unified attack.\n\n**Tenth Variation:**\nIf the opponent uses the eighth technique’s first chapter and I lose the opportunity, allowing them to throw me, I immediately counter with the eighth technique’s second chapter.\n\n**Eleventh Variation:**\nIf the opponent uses the ninth technique’s second chapter, I do not remain passive—I swiftly turn my entire body backward to break their technique.\n\n**Twelfth Variation:**\nIf I use the tenth technique’s first chapter but the opponent is prepared for my upper path, I crouch and shift into a double-handed grip to wrench their right foot, attacking their ribs with *Third-Gate Force*.\n\n**Thirteenth Variation:**\nIf the opponent uses the eleventh technique’s first chapter, I swiftly open my right step outward and kick their inner groin with my left foot.\n\n**Fourteenth Variation:**\nIf the opponent uses the twelfth technique’s first chapter, I counter by blocking their left shoulder with my right hand and hurling them backward, while my right foot hooks their left foot forward—both forces applied together.\n\n**Fifteenth Variation:**\nIf I use the thirteenth technique’s first chapter and the opponent exerts upward force, I swiftly retract my right hand to strike their ribs from beneath their elbow.\n\n**Sixteenth Variation:**\nIf I use the fourteenth technique’s first chapter but the opponent’s strength is overwhelming and I cannot lift them, I swiftly seal their body with my left step. If they shift to seize my left foot from the front, I attack with my full-body force.\n\n**Seventeenth Variation:**\nIf I use the fifteenth technique’s first chapter and the opponent retreats, I swiftly shift into *Earth Dragon’s Leaping Method*, pursuing them to attack again with the fifteenth technique’s first chapter.\n\n**Eighteenth Variation:**\nIf the opponent uses the sixteenth technique’s first chapter to cast off my right hand, I swiftly apply *Left Firm Bone Force* to press my right *Dougu* and break their technique.\n\n**Nineteenth Variation:**\nIf the opponent uses the seventeenth technique’s first chapter, I swiftly drop into *Horse-Riding Stance* with my full-body force.\n\n**Twentieth Variation:**\nIf the opponent uses the eighteenth technique’s second chapter to throw me, I swiftly shift into *Earth Dragon’s Side-Body Technique*, advancing my right foot to strike their shin.\n\n**Twenty-First Variation:**\nIf the opponent attacks me with the nineteenth technique’s first chapter, I counter with great force, using their own method against them.\n\n**Twenty-Second Variation:**\nIf the opponent uses the twentieth technique’s first chapter, I shift into *Small Body Method* and attack with both hands.\n\n**Twenty-Third Variation:**\nIf the opponent attacks me with the twenty-first technique’s first chapter, I swiftly arch my back, fall, and lift my right foot to strike their abdomen from below.\n\n**Twenty-Fourth Variation:**\nIf the opponent uses the twenty-second technique, I counter with my full-body *Sealing Force*.\n\n**Scattered Techniques, General Method:**\nWhen I advance with my right foot and execute an upward force, if the opponent seals my hand outward with their left-hand *Sealing Force* and prepares to strike inward with their right hand, I must not act recklessly. Instead, I raise my left hand, unifying my full-body force, and sweep with my right hand.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nIf my upward force fails and I am struck by their left hand, I need not use a sweeping force. Instead, I raise my left hand to meet their right hand and strike with *Double Firm Bone Force*.\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nWhen I strike upward with my right hand, if the opponent seals my right hand with their right hand and prepares to advance their left step to strike my temple, I must not recklessly use my left hand. Instead, I seal outward with my right hand’s *Sealing Force*.\n\n**Right, Chapter Three:**\nWhen I strike upward with my right hand and the opponent seizes it, preparing to advance their left step and strike my face with their right hand, I use my right back’s upper and lower full-body skill to curve *Second-Gate Force* and attack their ribs.\n\n**Right, Chapter Four:**\nWhen I advance my right foot in *Horse-Riding Stance*, regardless of the opponent’s method, as soon as their right hand nears mine, I seize it with my right hand and advance my left hand to strike their right ribs.\n\n**Right, Chapter Five:**\nWhen I advance my right step with *Upward-Striking Force*, if the opponent seals my right hand with their right hand and prepares to lift their right foot to strike my ribs, I must stabilize my entire body’s structure, then turn over my right hand to seize their foot and swiftly lift it.\n\n**Right, Chapter Six:**\nWhen I advance my right step with *Upward-Striking Force* and the opponent seals my right hand with their left hand while raising their right hand to strike me, I likewise seal their right hand with my left hand, withdraw my right hand, and strike again with *Upward-Striking Force*—but this requires mastery of full-body skill to be effective.\n\n**Right, Chapter Seven:**\nThe preceding methods are all used when the two opponents are close. If the distance remains great, I need not wait for the opponent to near me; instead, I mobilize my entire body’s spirit to fly forward, seal their right hand with my left, and strike with my right hand’s *Upward-Striking Force*. If the strike misses, I immediately fly back out, never waiting for the opponent to counter. After retreating, I stabilize my full-body skill; if the opponent pursues, I strike suddenly before their step lands. Should I strike the opponent and they retreat, I again mobilize my entire body’s spirit to press the attack, observing their emptiness or solidity, their movement or stillness—whether from the inner or outer gate, the upper or lower path. I adapt my methods to their structure, never missing the moment nor advancing recklessly. This is the essential tactic in facing an opponent, and only through mastering *Spirit-Mobilizing Skill* can one grasp its subtlety.\n\n---\n\n**Miscellaneous Commentaries on *Neigong Scattered Gates***\n\n**First Saying:**\nMaster Nanxi devoted over twelve years to his practice, compiling countless hand techniques. Yet these *Neigong Scattered Gates* distill his synthesis of various schools’ methods, refined through the *Internal Skill Classic*, discarding the superfluous to retain only those with natural overcoming intent, then established as formal patterns to share with fellow practitioners.\n\n**Second Saying:**\nThe high and low postures, inner and outer reversals, and rules of *Neigong Scattered Gates* are all ancient fixed methods; modern practitioners may not alter them. As for the seamless, naturally fitting combat joints within—these arose from Nanxi’s insights while studying the *Internal Skill Classic*, later refined by his own ingenuity. Those who have not read the *Internal Skill Classic* cannot comprehend them.\n\n**Third Saying:**\nThe orthodox and variant forms of *Neigong Scattered Gates* were all personally written by Master Nanxi. Only the annotations in the orthodox forms were composed by Jingfang, yet even these were based on the *Internal Skill Classic* and Nanxi’s daily discourses before he dared put brush to paper.\n\n**Fourth Saying:**\nThe appended *Divided Verses* in *Neigong Scattered Gates* were transmitted orally by Nanxi’s teacher, while the annotations to the *Eight Verses* were personally written by Nanxi himself.\n\n**Fifth Saying:**\n*Neigong Scattered Gates* comprises the orthodox forms, forty-five variant hands, twenty-four general hands, and eight hands—seventy-seven methods in total, covering upper and lower, left and right, front and back, inner and outer. If one trains these thoroughly, no matter from which direction an opponent attacks, there will always be a method to overcome them. Thus, there is no need to exhaust all possibilities.\n\n**Sixth Saying:**\nAnyone with even slight familiarity with the patterns and syntax of *Neigong Scattered Gates* can gain insight through careful reflection. Yet to grasp its divine subtleties, one must first study the *Internal Skill Classic*.\n\n**Seventh Saying:**\nOnly after awakening through the *Internal Skill Classic* should one study *Scattered Gates*. If one cannot awaken to the *Internal Skill Classic* but receives clear transmission of *Neigong Scattered Gates* from an enlightened teacher, and then dedicates time and effort to refining it, victory can still be achieved—one need not be rigidly bound to awakening through the *Internal Skill Classic*.\n\n**Eighth Saying:**\n*Neigong Scattered Gates* contains peerlessly exquisite hand methods, and its unfathomable wonders lie within the variant forms. Yet without first mastering the orthodox forms, the practitioner cannot glimpse the divine transformations of the variants.\n\n**Ninth Saying:**\nIn learning *Neigong Scattered Gates*, the first priority is to recognize where *force* resides. Where the opponent’s *force* lies is what they rely upon. If I know their reliance and break it, how can they not be defeated?\n\n**Tenth Saying:**\nThe second priority is to recognize where the opponent has no *force*. Where they lack *force* is where they fear attack. If I know their fear and strike there, how can they not be defeated?\n\n**Eleventh Saying:**\nThe third priority is to recognize where the opponent establishes their *gate*. Where they set their *gate* is their trap for me. If I know their trap and avoid it, how can they prevail?\n\n**Twelfth Saying:**\nThe fourth priority is to recognize where the opponent has no *gate*. Where there is no *gate* is where they are helpless. If I know their helplessness and attack there, how can they prevail?\n\n**Thirteenth Saying:**\nOne must first understand the principles of the body’s joints—backward and forward, yielding and resisting, opening and closing, horizontal and vertical—before one can know *force* and *gate*.\n\n**Fourteenth Saying:**\nOnly by thoroughly mastering the principles of the body’s joints—backward and forward, yielding and resisting, opening and closing, horizontal and vertical—can one accurately discern *force* and *gate* without error.\n\n**Fifteenth Saying:**\nWithout understanding the principles of the body’s joints—backward and forward, yielding and resisting—no matter how much苦功 one expends, one is merely learning *Scattered Gates*, not *Neigong Scattered Gates*.\n\n**Sixteenth Saying:**\nWhy does training *Neigong Scattered Gates* with *rooted strength* yield no effect? It must be that one uses *rooted* but not *strength*. If one truly employs *rooted strength*, how could there be no effect?\n\n**Seventeenth Saying:**\nWhy does training *Neigong Scattered Gates* with *firm knees* yield no effect? It must be that one uses *knees* but not *firmness*. If one truly employs *firm knees*, how could there be no effect?\n\n**Eighteenth Saying:**\nWhy, in learning *Neigong Scattered Gates*, does one not understand the use of *inner crotch* and *outer hip* *force*?\n\n**Response:**\nIt must be that one has not read the *Neigong Classic*. If one has read the *Neigong Classic*, there would be none who do not understand the use of *force* in the *outer hip* and *inner crotch*.\n\n**Nineteenth Saying:**\nWhy, in learning *Neigong Scattered Gates*, can one not use the *shoulder*, *back*, *chest*, and *ribs* to control others?\nIt must be that one does not understand *adhering force* and *sweating force*. If one employs *adhering force* and *sweating force*, there would be none who cannot use the *shoulder*, *back*, *chest*, and *ribs* to control others.\n\n**Twentieth Saying:**\nWhy, in learning *Neigong Scattered Gates*, does one not understand the *source of force*, the *reason for adhering knees*, or the *purpose of firming the root and refining*?\nThis must be because one has not deeply embodied the *Neigong Classic*. If one deeply embodies the *Neigong Classic*, how could such flaws exist?\n\n**Twenty-First Saying:**\nIf one does not know the *Neigong Classic* but only learns *Scattered Gates*, can one still achieve victory?\nIn *Neigong Scattered Gates*, there are *skillful stances* and *clever stances*. *Skillful stances* cannot be employed without knowing the *Neigong Classic*. As for *clever stances*, if one merely understands the principles of the body’s joints—backward and forward, yielding and resisting, opening and closing, horizontal and vertical—one can achieve victory without being entirely constrained by *Neigong*.\n\n**Twenty-Second Saying:**\nIf one has gained understanding in *internal force* and is also proficient in *Scattered Gates*, what then?\n*Neigong* combined with *Scattered Gates*—hardness tempers softness, softness tempers hardness. The transformations of *generation* and *overcoming*, *yin* and *yang*, *emptiness* and *fullness*—one appears as a gentle maiden at a glance, yet seizes like a fierce tiger. Its marvel is beyond description.\n\n**Twenty-Third Saying:**\nWhy, when studying *Neigong Scattered Gates*, does one open the scroll and remain bewildered, unable to grasp its marvels?\nIt must be that one has not received instruction from an enlightened master. For any profound text, without guidance from an enlightened master, one will inevitably remain bewildered. Let Jingfang speak a word or two of it, and none will fail to deeply comprehend it in their hearts.\n\n**Twenty-Fourth Saying:**\nWithout instruction from an enlightened master, can one still grasp a thing or two?\nWithout instruction from an enlightened master, if one reads diligently and reflects deeply, practices with a partner, and possesses exceptional intelligence, after prolonged effort, one may suddenly awaken. However, compared to having an enlightened master’s guidance, it requires a hundredfold more effort.\n\n**Twenty-Fifth Saying:**\nIf an intelligent person studies *Neigong Scattered Gates* for a long time, they must awaken—otherwise, what value would this book hold?\n\n**Twenty-Sixth Saying:**\nIn learning *Neigong Scattered Gates*, is there anyone who awakens at first sight?\nThose who claim to awaken at first sight either deceive others or deceive themselves. Jingfang possesses only mediocre talent, yet after five or six years of personal guidance from Nanxizi, what I have gained is but one ten-thousandth of his knowledge. If there were one who awakened at first sight, Jingfang would flatly declare: they either deceive others or deceive themselves.\n\n**Twenty-Seventh Saying:**\nIs learning *Neigong Scattered Gates* truly so difficult?\nTo speak of its subtlety and marvel, it is indeed not easy. But to speak of overcoming an opponent, it is most suitable for people. Try applying it, and you will surely witness extraordinary results—it only requires three months of diligent practice.\n\n**Twenty-Eighth Saying:**\nThe hand techniques in *Neigong Scattered Gates* differ greatly from those of the world.\nWe are all human, all with the same body—what difference could there be? Yet in the subtle distinctions of the body’s joints—backward and forward, yielding and resisting, opening and closing, horizontal and vertical—the outcomes of victory and defeat diverge vastly.\n\n**Twenty-Ninth Saying:**\nIn *Neigong Scattered Gates*, whenever one uses the feet, the entire body must fall to the ground, never lightly standing high to strike with the foot—this is the peculiarity of this school. Yet when facing those in the world who stand high and strike with the foot, practitioners of *Neigong* can cause them to lift their foot without rising. This is a natural marvel, and Jingfang does not understand why.\n\n**Thirtieth Saying:**\nThose who have studied this Dao in the past—whether blindly arrogant or timid and weak, or deeply secretive and stingy, swearing never to teach others—yet Nanxizi alone conducts himself with scholarly elegance, treats others with humility, and to all who sincerely seek instruction, explains its principles without reserve. Jingfang has engraved this in his heart—does the world hear my words and also admire him?\n\n**Eight Secrets of Nanxizi of Shanzuo for Overcoming Opponents in Combat**\n\n**Eight Secrets:**\n*Preparation, Assessment, Enticement, Provocation, Exhaustion, Confusion, Pursuit, Adaptation.*\n\n**Method of Preparation:**\nThe first essential secret in facing an opponent is *preparation*.\nOnly by knowing one’s own preparedness can one respond to an opponent’s attack. Only by observing an opponent’s lack of preparedness can one exploit their flaws. The meaning of *preparation* is vast indeed.\nIn terms of *gongfu*, within advancing lies *retreat force*—this is preparation for the opponent’s pull. Within retreating lies *advance force*—this is preparation for the opponent’s collision. Within vertical force lies *horizontal force*—this is preparation for the opponent’s blocking and sweeping. Within horizontal force lies *vertical force*—this is preparation for the opponent’s gaps.\nIn terms of *Scattered Gates*, when striking the opponent’s upper path, one must first prepare for their strike to one’s lower path. When striking the opponent’s inner gate, one must first prepare for their strike to one’s outer gate. Drawing out and extending, one dares not advance lightly—this is preparation for the opponent’s enticement. One dares not act hastily—this is preparation for the opponent’s provocation. One dares not move repeatedly—this is preparation for the opponent’s exhaustion. The applications of *preparation* are boundless. Truly, it is the essential Dao of self-defense and the secret technique of attacking an opponent.\n\n**Method of Assessment:**\nThe second essential secret in facing an opponent is *assessment*.\nBy assessing the depth of the opponent’s skill, one can control their vital points. By ensuring the opponent cannot assess one’s depth, one avoids being toyed with by them. The meaning of *assessment* is far-reaching indeed.\nAssess the opponent’s distance to determine advance and retreat. Assess the opponent’s emptiness and fullness to apply *Scattered Gates*. Assess the opponent’s strength and weakness to employ hardness and softness. Employ many methods to assess them, and only then engage in combat.\n\nThe opponent may be enticed to assess their knowledge, provoked to gauge their composure, wearied to test their strength, or adapted to to discern their adaptability. Such is the method of *assessment*—applicable in all circumstances and indispensable at the outset of an encounter.\n\n**Method of Enticement:**\nThe third essential secret in facing an opponent is *enticement*.\nWhen meeting an opponent of comparable strength, where techniques are evenly matched and both parties are well-versed, each guards their own body.\nIf I do not covet the opponent’s flaws, I must ensure no flaws are exposed to them; if the opponent does not covet my flaws, they will not expose any to me. Thus, with no flaws for the opponent to exploit and no desire in them to strike, no opportunity arises for me to employ my attacking techniques.\nTherefore, true flaws must never exist, but false flaws must never be absent. If neither side exposes flaws nor harbors greed, how can victory or defeat be determined?\nThe method lies in feigning a vulnerable opening for the opponent. If they greedily strike at it, they will inevitably leave themselves unguarded—whereupon I strike unexpectedly.\nThus, to strike the opponent’s inner gate, one must first entice their outer gate; to strike their lower path, one must first entice their upper path. To employ hardness, first display softness; to employ emptiness, first display fullness; to employ fullness, first display emptiness.\nThough these principles are clear and easily understood, without prior training, they may not be readily applied in the moment.\n\n**Method of Provocation:**\nThe fourth essential secret in facing an opponent is *provocation*.\nThis is not provocation through words, but through action.\nEnticement tests the opponent with emptiness, while provocation moves them with substance. If the opponent remains unmoved by enticement, how else can they be engaged?\nOne must feign anger, press close to their body, and test their courage or timidity while observing their movements—only then can one’s attacking techniques be deployed.\nThus, provoke their left, and they cannot but turn left to meet you; provoke their right, and they cannot but turn right to meet you—thereby revealing their true disposition.\nThe subtleties herein must be deeply contemplated; do not cling to the vulgar notion of \"provoking a general.\" These techniques, when used to elicit the opponent’s intent, become strikes; when used to probe their intent, they are called provocation.\nIn sum, the hands act with substance while the intent remains empty.\n\n**Method of Fatigue:**\nThe fifth essential secret in facing an opponent is *fatigue*.\nTo fatigue is to exhaust, to sicken, to induce slackness—then attack.\nWithin a single day, one’s *qi* is sharp at dawn but sluggish by dusk; within a single hour, it is sharp at the outset but sluggish by the end. At the first movement, one’s *qi* is inevitably sharp, and sharpness brings fierce strength. Yet if movement continues unceasingly, *qi* must slacken, and slackness leads to decline—this is the natural course.\nWhen facing a strong opponent who seeks to press the attack, I must gather my entire body’s strength to await them. If they attempt to retreat, I use my spirit to disrupt their rhythm, employing emptiness within fullness, fullness within emptiness, softness concealing hardness, or hardness concealing softness—all to deny them respite. Only when they grow weary from prolonged movement do I strike.\nYet when employing fatigue, one must cherish one’s own spirit and conserve one’s strength, reserving it to attack the opponent. Otherwise, after prolonged exertion, the opponent may be fatigued, but how can one remain sharp alone?\n\n**Method of Confusion:**\nThe sixth essential secret in facing an opponent is *confusion*.\nConfusion is the blinding of the eyes, the bewilderment of the mind. If I am not confused by the opponent, how can they defeat me? If the opponent is not confused by me, how can I outwit them? Between confusion and clarity, victory and defeat are decided.\nThus, when facing a strong opponent, one must employ many means to confuse them: advancing while appearing uncertain to bewilder them, retreating while appearing unpredictable to bewilder them.\nConceal one’s weaknesses and refrain from using them; employ one’s strengths to take the initiative—this is the method of confounding the foolish.\nHide one’s strengths to inflate their arrogance; flaunt one’s weaknesses to lull their vigilance—this is the method of confounding the wise.\nFeign disorder, adopt bizarre postures, display softness when intending to use hardness, or test with hardness when intending to use softness—all serve to confuse.\nOnce this technique is applied, no opponent will escape with eyes unblinded and mind unbewildered. It surpasses the method of fatigue, for fatigue merely attacks their strength, while confusion strikes directly at their mind.\n\n**Method of Pursuit:**\nThe seventh essential secret in facing an opponent is *pursuit*.\nWhen the opponent has been fatigued by my techniques, their strength slackens; when confused by my techniques, their mind grows careless. Reckless and careless, they no longer wish to fight. If not now, when shall their will be subdued?\nThus, the method of pursuit: press close to scatter their gates, or maintain distance to employ spiritual movement.\nIf the opponent retreats with horizontal force, pursue with vertical; if they retreat with vertical force, pursue with horizontal.\nPursue slowly to guard against deception, or swiftly to exploit their emptiness. The methods of pursuit are manifold, yet all deny the opponent freedom of movement.\nTo pursue when opportunity arises and retreat when difficulty looms—this is wisdom.\nMastering these techniques reveals the subtleties of pursuit.\nYet there is also the method of pursuing while striking, attacking the opponent’s unpreparedness; and pursuing without striking, awaiting their flaws—both must be understood.\n\n**Method of Adaptation:**\nThe eighth essential secret in facing an opponent is *adaptation*.\nThe subtleties of adaptation are beyond words.\n\nAdapting to things by entrusting them to their nature, achieving success by seizing the moment, and applying techniques according to the opponent—since ancient times, the ceaseless responsiveness of heaven and humanity has arisen from nothing but the subtlety of *adaptation*. As the *Yijing* states: \"Transformation and movement never abide; they circulate without emptiness.\" Even the deployment of formations in the *Sanmen* school of unarmed combat does not stray from this single principle.\n\nFor if one seeks to control the opponent with fixed techniques, the opponent’s variations are infinite while one’s methods are finite; but if one establishes techniques in response to the opponent, then when the opponent has no fixed form, one’s techniques likewise become formless. How profound is the meaning of *adaptation*!\n\nIf the opponent seeks to attack my upper path, I adapt to their upward momentum and counterattack—this is the method of Chapter Two in the Twentieth Scenario. If they attack my lower path, I adapt to their downward momentum and counterattack—this is the method of Chapter Four in the First Scenario. If their assault is fierce, I adapt to its ferocity and devise a counter—this is the method of Chapter Two in the Fifth Scenario. If they throw me to the ground, I adapt to their throw and establish a counter—this is the method of Chapter Four in the Tenth Scenario.\n\nIn sum, when I apply my skill, countless established techniques reside in my mind. The methods of the ancients are consummate, and I cannot transcend their bounds; thus, I must rely on these established forms as my compass. Yet if no fixed technique resides in my mind, I devise methods in response to the opponent’s *qi*, their openings, and their momentum—techniques that cannot be confined to a single form.\n\nAh! Only when one grasps this profound principle may one be deemed worthy of witnessing the inner workings of the *Sanmen* school.",

However, the various editions of *The Four Classics* currently in circulation have been subject to additions and omissions, lacking systematic coherence, thereby hindering later scholars from grasping its full essence. The \"Original Transmission Martial Arts Dissemination Center\" in Handan, Hebei, has generously made public its held authentic handwritten copy of *The Four Classics of Internal Cultivation*, hoping to aid readers in gaining a comprehensive and objective understanding of this martial arts text.\n\nThe original manuscript comprises over forty thousand characters. The table of contents at the beginning outlines the following structure:\n- **Volume One**: *Neigong Jing* (Classic of Internal Cultivation)\n- **Volume Two**: *Nagua Jing* (Classic of Absorbing the Trigrams)\n- **Volume Three**: *Shenyun Jing* (Classic of Spirit Circulation), *Dali Zhujie* (Annotations on Great Strength), *Hezhan Bamen* (Eight Gates of Combined Combat)\n- **Volume Four**: *Dilong Jing* (Classic of Earthly Dragon), *Sanmen Zhengju* (Standard Forms of Scattered Gates), *Sanmen Bianju* (Variations of Scattered Gates), *Sanmen Zongju* (General Principles of Scattered Gates), *Sanmen Zaping* (Miscellaneous Critiques of Scattered Gates), *Zhisheng Bajue* (Eight Secrets of Victory)\n\nRegarding the provenance of this text, Ren Erqi (1877–1945), a disciple of the Song family’s Xingyi Quan, briefly recounted in his *Original Postscript to The Four Classics of Internal Cultivation*: \"This book was obtained during the early Qing dynasty, retrieved by Minister Wang from a stone casket at the riverbed.\"\n\nIn the *Preface* by Wang Nanxi and the *Postscript* by Zong Jingfang included in this *Authentic Complete Edition of the True Classic of Internal Cultivation*, the detailed history of the text and Wang Nanxi’s painstaking research are elaborated. Wang Nanxi states:\n\n> \"*The Four Classics of Internal Cultivation* was acquired by my ancestor, Minister Wang, while serving in Jiangxi. After his passing, over a hundred years elapsed without anyone understanding the purpose of this book. In the year *jiazi*, I chanced upon it in a hidden storeroom. Upon opening it, I was at first bewildered and nearly abandoned my efforts. Later, after years of exhaustive study, I came to realize that this book embodies the foundational lineage of martial arts and the true transmission of internal cultivation.\"\n\nZong Jingfang recounts:\n\n> \"My friend Nanxi’s ancestor was a minister in the early Qing dynasty. While overseeing affairs in Jiangxi, his boat anchored at Qingjiang, where he witnessed a merchant’s vessel capsize. As goods were salvaged from the riverbed, a stone casket was recovered, containing two books. The minister wished to examine them. The merchant presented them for his inspection: one titled *Jiandan* (Sword Elixir), the other *Neigong* (Internal Cultivation). The *Neigong* text comprised four sections: *Neigong Jing* (Classic of Internal Cultivation), *Nagua Jing* (Classic of Absorbing the Trigrams), *Shenyun Jing* (Classic of Spirit Circulation), and *Dilong Jing* (Classic of Earthly Dragon). A postscript read: ‘Copied on the fifteenth day of the third month in the second year of Zhenguan.’ The minister purchased it at a high price.\"\n\nZong Jingfang, a friend of Wang Nanxi, studied *The Four Classics of Internal Cultivation* alongside him and assisted in \"providing detailed annotations to elucidate its meaning, ensuring that later generations may study and apply it.\" For this publication, the editor has followed the original manuscript’s markings, distinguishing the *Four Classics* text (in bold) from the annotations (in regular script). As the original is a handwritten copy with somewhat cursive script, any errors in transcription or misinterpretation in this edition await correction by discerning readers.\n\n**Preface and Postscript to *The Authentic Complete Edition of the True Classic of Internal Cultivation***\n\n**Volume One**: *Neigong Jing* (Classic of Internal Cultivation)\n**Volume Two**: *Nagua Jing* (Classic of Absorbing the Trigrams)",

The *Classic of Internal Cultivation* thus stands as the highest priority. Some may be dull of talent, impatient with its subtleties, or constrained by poverty, unable to train daily. If they rush to penetrate its principles upon first encounter, will they not gaze in vain like one who faces the ocean yet gathers nothing? Therefore, I have compiled several chapters on external manifestations of internal skill: *Great Power: Complete Formations*, *Internal Skill in Combined Combat*, *Scattered Gates of Internal Skill*, *Reversal and Compliance*, *Inversion and Sequence*, and *Essential Points of the Internal Classics*. Through these, even beginners may grasp the underlying principles of the text.\n\nAs for postures and techniques, a few are recorded here, yet without understanding the *Internal Classics*, one will often err fundamentally in the principles of skeletal alignment, joint coordination, and the interplay of compliance and resistance. Alas! *The Four Classics of Internal Cultivation* have languished in obscurity for centuries. The traces of the ancients have faded, leaving no transmission.

      "translated_text": "The Dao, which embodies the essence of Heaven and Earth and the hidden mysteries of yin and yang, cannot perish in obscurity—this is no mere coincidence. Heaven must raise extraordinary individuals to comprehend it, and those who comprehend it must commit it to writing. If such works do not circulate in the centuries before, they will surely circulate in the centuries after. There must arise one who obtains the book, not by chance, and another who preserves it. If the preserver cannot put it into practice, there must arise one who strives to do so, undaunted by hardship, determined to elucidate the true legacy of the ancients for posterity. Yet fearing that one person’s efforts may not suffice, others will inevitably emerge to assist—how could this be mere coincidence?\n\nAlas! Such individuals may await one another across centuries or meet within them, their paths converging and diverging in wondrous ways. My friend, Nanxi Zi, had an ancestor who served as a high-ranking censor and governor of Jiangxi in the early Qing. While moored at Qingjiang, he witnessed a merchant’s boat capsize, and upon rescuing goods from the water, recovered a stone casket containing two books. The official wished to examine them, and the merchant presented them for his inspection. One was titled *Sword and Elixir*, the other *Internal Cultivation*. The latter comprised four scrolls: the *Classic of Internal Cultivation*, the *Classic of Absorbing the Trigrams*, the *Classic of Spirit Movement*, and the *Classic of Earthly Dragon*. A postscript read: “Copied on the fifteenth day of the third month, second year of Zhen’guan.” The official acquired them at a high price.\n\nAlas! This book, composed in high antiquity and concealed beneath the waters in a stone casket, had endured untold years of obscurity. After centuries of burial, it suddenly resurfaced—was this not proof of the Dao’s indestructibility, that Heaven specially raised a merchant to retrieve it and an official to preserve it? The official studied the texts at length, recognizing their profound principles as truly exceptional. Yet burdened by his solemn duties to the court, he had no leisure to delve deeply. After his passing, the books entered wider circulation. His descendants, however, valued literary pursuits and official rank, while those indifferent to scholarship focused on family and livelihood. None paid heed to these works. Even those who chanced upon them found the contents baffling and dismissed them as useless. Some of the Wang family’s descendants were unaware such books existed in their household.\n\nOnly my friend Nanxi Zi, born with keen intelligence, though he did not pursue official success, delighted in poetry and literature, free from worldly calculations. One day, he chanced upon these books and noticed their seals. Sighing, he remarked: “This official was a man of discernment—clearly, he would not have paid a high price for worthless things. These books must hold profound meaning, though none now understand them.” He pored over them meticulously, noting passages on trigrams resembling *Yijing* commentaries, others on the body’s meridians akin to medical texts, and still others on refining spirit and qi like Daoist alchemical manuals. For two or three years, he pondered them deeply but could not fathom their full significance.\n\nLater, while conversing idly with a man named Guan, he learned that Guan’s master had achieved unparalleled skill in martial arts, attributing it to the *Classic of Internal Cultivation*. Nanxi Zi inquired: “Does the *Classic of Internal Cultivation* still exist?” Guan replied: “It has long been lost. My master, Shao, learned it orally, retaining only two or three parts out of ten.” Suddenly, Nanxi Zi realized—this was the very book the official had acquired! He retrieved it and studied it anew, gaining fleeting insights. Redoubling his efforts, he gradually grasped its potential to awaken wisdom, and secondarily, to heal illness and strengthen the body. Even its martial applications were but minor benefits. After two years, he tested his skills against opponents and never failed to prevail.\n\nAlas! For a century, this book had been deemed useless—had Nanxi Zi not devoted himself to deciphering it, would it not have remained so? As the ancients said: “The Dao is transmitted to those who truly understand it.” How true! A principle buried for over a hundred years was suddenly brought to light—was this not proof of the Dao’s indestructibility, that Heaven specially raised Nanxi Zi to illuminate it?\n\nYet the Dao’s depths are boundless. Nanxi Zi admitted his mastery extended to only half of its ten parts. Regretting the lack of a kindred spirit to discuss and refine it with him, he feared that if he withheld it entirely, the ancients’ treasure would vanish forever—a grievous loss. For over a decade, he bore this burden silently, his heart heavy with unease.\n\nIn the *bingzi* year, I visited his hometown, and we became close, our ages and aspirations aligned. He regarded me as an elder brother, and I, him as a younger brother. Having long heard of his martial prowess, I was drawn to it, and pressed him repeatedly for details. Moved by our deep friendship, he held nothing back, outlining the essentials. At first, I dismissed it as mere brute martial skill. Later, when we lodged in a nearby village and met daily, I learned of its benefits for healing and strengthening the body, and begged to learn it. Nanxi Zi cautioned: “This practice cannot be mastered in a day or a night. Without perseverance, it will be futile.” I insisted, and he taught me a few techniques. After months of practice with no results, I privately deemed it impractical and nearly abandoned it. Nanxi Zi said: “I warned you this was no quick endeavor—do you now believe me?” Ashamed, I persisted for several more months, and faint progress emerged. Overjoyed, I told Nanxi Zi: “Please, teach me more.”",

      "translated_text": "Nanxi Zi said: \"Do not assume that because you practiced for months and suddenly achieved extraordinary results—your long-standing lumps and swellings healed, your strength multiplied severalfold—only then did you understand that I did not lightly transmit this to others not out of stinginess, but out of reverence for this Dao.\"\n\nThereupon, I bowed again and sought further instruction. Though I gained some slight insights, they remained scant. Only then did I realize that Nanxi Zi was not one to speak idly, and so I ceased my requests. Nanxi Zi said: \"In this practice, the method of employing qi follows but a single channel. Should one stray into side paths, the harm will be no small matter.\"\n\nI heard these words but did not take them to heart. After receiving the instruction and practicing, I gradually began to comprehend. Suddenly, I thought: *Are not all arts under heaven but imitations devised by the ancients? Why should I alone not invent my own?* I made slight modifications, and within months, I was stricken with severe cramping and stiffness. I told Nanxi Zi: \"The efficacy of this Dao lies in this: one must not be greedy for progress, nor rush too hastily, nor recklessly alter its methods. Most of the changes I made ran counter to its true principles—otherwise, how could I have suffered such affliction?\"\n\nI was overwhelmed with shame and immediately vowed to repent. Nanxi Zi explained the proper methods in detail, and after several months, my cramping and stiffness were cured. From then on, whatever he deemed correct, I pursued day and night; whatever he deemed incorrect, I abandoned day and night. Thus, for two years, I felt profound awakening in my heart, while my qi and body became as boundless as the rising sun. Though I did not speak of it, my heart knew the truth. The deeper our mutual understanding grew, the more we forgot our physical forms.\n\nNanxi Zi did not regard this as any great achievement, nor did I ever utter a word of flattery. Whenever we discussed these matters, we would forget sleep and food. Nanxi Zi’s discourses were incisive and eloquent, leaving little room for further questions. After another two years, Nanxi Zi suddenly presented me with two scrolls, saying: \"These are supreme treasures. I have long wished to transmit them, but never found the right person. Now I see you are no mere drifter in the world of dust. I wish to bestow them upon you. The first is *The Sword Scroll*, a cinnabar classic of the immortals, which must not be passed on to those without innate wisdom. The second is *The Internal Cultivation Classic*, which strengthens the body, cures illness, and greatly enhances one’s qi and strength. I intend to spread it throughout the land—would you make it known to all who seek it?\"\n\nOverwhelmed with astonishment and joy, I prostrated myself and bowed again, saying: \"This is a teaching beyond price—who would not yearn for it? Yet you alone have chosen to teach me. How can I ever repay your boundless kindness? Now you entrust me with these treasured scrolls, even permitting their transmission to future generations. Your generosity is selfless—how could I refuse?\" I then asked about the origins of the texts in detail.\n\nNanxi Zi explained fully: \"There are many passages in these scrolls that remain obscure. I wish to work with you to annotate and clarify them so that later generations may understand and apply them.\" I replied: \"These texts, buried for centuries, are now to be spread across the land—is this not proof that this Dao cannot be extinguished? Heaven must have raised one who fears no hardship to elucidate the true methods of the ancients and transmit them to posterity. Though I am unworthy, I dare to pledge my humble sincerity to assist you, my brother, in completing this endeavor.\" Thus, this preface was written.\n\nBy Zong Jingfang of Zhushan\nGeneral Discussion",

Without perseverance, it will be futile.” I insisted, and he taught me a few techniques. After months of practice with no results, I privately deemed it impractical and nearly abandoned it. Nanxi Zi said: “I warned you this was no quick endeavor—do you now believe me?” Ashamed, I persisted for several more months, and faint progress emerged. Overjoyed, I told Nanxi Zi: “Please, teach me more.”",

      "translated_text": "The arts of martial valor have numbered no fewer than dozens of schools since ancient times—Exploring Horse, Mirror Son, Arhat, Grand Ancestor, Buddha, Warrior Son—names so astonishing and fearsome they defy full recounting. Yet vulgar custom prevails: to study one is to reject another, to embrace one is to spurn the rest, and disputes multiply day by day. The crux lies in failing to inherit the true transmission of internal skill. Bound by sectarian dogma, practitioners exhaust themselves in vain toil, ever remaining in the lower ranks. It is like reading without returning to essentials, skimming without depth, or pursuing breadth without focus—how can one grasp the Dao?\n\nAll things possess a root; when the root is secured, the branches follow. This is what is meant by \"one governing ten thousand\" and \"simplicity governing complexity.\" Yet those who practice this Way in recent times have forgotten that its root is singular, chasing instead the myriad differences of its branches. They divide into factions, fabricate names, and often boast, \"My art is the shortcut.\" Ignorant of the principle of \"one governing ten thousand\" or \"simplicity governing complexity,\" they wander in confusion—no wonder they crumble in combat.\n\nThe true Way of the cosmos has never offered shortcuts; there are only root and branch, before and after. Later transformations, boundless in variation, arise solely from gradual, orderly progress—where is there room for shortcuts?\n\nThen what is this root? It is *jin*. When advancing, it can subdue the enemy; when retreating, it can defend the self. In all directions—up, down, forth, back—it responds as one wishes. *Jin* that is slack, weak, or hollow cannot withstand an opponent, nor can it guard the self in retreat. Every preparation, whether substantial or insubstantial, becomes a perilous moment. Thus, *jin* is indeed essential.\n\nYet without understanding the guiding principles of *jin*, its pivotal mechanisms, or its ultimate destination, one may possess *jin* in name but never in truth.\n\nWhat are the guiding principles of *jin*? They lie in the head. The head is the meeting point of all yang, the guiding principle of the entire body—like the handle of an object or the beginning of an affair. If the handle is crooked, the matter cannot be resolved; how can one expect the rest to follow? Thus, the head’s function is to lift upward, not to sink downward; to be vibrant and spirited, not sluggish and lifeless. Though *jin* does not reside in the head, the head’s bearing is never irrelevant to the mastery or loss of *jin*.\n\nWhat are the pivotal mechanisms of *jin*? They lie in the shoulders and ribs. The shoulders are the root of the arms, the ribs the cavern of *qi*. They unite the spirit of the head above with the power of the feet, waist, and hips below, forming the great nexus of the entire body. Like the door of a house or the pass of a nation, if the door does not open, there is no passage for coming or going. Thus, the shoulders’ function has eight essentials: *tong* (through), *tou* (penetrate), *chuan* (pierce), *tie* (adhere), *song* (relax), *han* (sweat), *he* (unite), and *jian* (firm). The ribs’ function has two: opening and expanding, tightening and gathering. Mastering these secrets, one grasps more than half the wonders of the middle region.\n\nWhat is the ultimate destination of *jin*? It lies in the feet. The feet are the root of all limbs, bearing the entire body—like all things growing from soil and standing upon the earth, where decline and vigor, form and posture, all depend on the ground. If the earth is not vast and thick, how can it bear all things? Thus, the feet are the source of *jin*’s issuance. Every release and relaxation arises from the *yongquan* (Bubbling Spring) point beneath the feet; every contraction and tension returns to the *yongquan* to subside. This is the essential secret of the lower path and the foundation of all skill.\n\nUnderstanding these three—head, shoulders and ribs, feet—one may grasp the general outline. Yet what remains to be emphasized above all?",

      "translated_text": "It is *qi*. For *jin* arises from *qi* as wood arises from water—wood must await water’s moisture to live, and *jin* must be nurtured by *qi* before it emerges by principle. If one wishes to cultivate *qi*, one must first open the gates and cavities to guide its flow. Otherwise, the gates and cavities of the body will be blocked by the turbid *qi* of later heaven. Even if one desires to cultivate *qi*, how could it be possible? One must stretch the sinews and extend the strength to unblock them, and only then will true *qi* flow naturally. By circulating this *qi*, one may nourish *jin* and replenish *qi*. Thus, in the beginning, *qi* and *jin* serve to mutually support and replenish one another. With prolonged practice, they merge into a single, undifferentiated power. Later scholars who delve deeply into these principles will surely recognize that my words are not idle.\n\nAs for the floating and sinking of *qi*, the relaxation and tension of *jin*, the opening and closing of the head, the horizontal and vertical alignment of the hands, and the upright and oblique postures of the body—these must be sought within the *Internal Skill Classic* and its Ten Postures. They cannot be mastered in a single day.\n\n**Annotations by Wang Nanxi of Langya in Shanzuo**\n**Collated by Zong Jingfang of Zhushan in Haiyou**\n\n**The Internal Skill Classic**\nThe transmission of internal skill is rooted in the authenticity of its meridians. The first essential of internal skill is to understand the meridians. If the meridians are not authentic, forced practice will bring no benefit and may cause harm.\n\n**Front Ren and Rear Du, Rolling Qi Unceasing**\nThe *Ren* meridian begins at *Chengjiang* (Sauce Receptacle), descends straight through the center of the chest and abdomen, and terminates at the high bone of the anterior yin. The *Du* meridian begins at the very end of the coccyx, ascends straight along the spine, passes through *Niuwan* (Mud Pill Palace), and terminates at *Renzhong* (Human Center) beneath the nose. When *qi* rolls unceasingly through these two meridians, front and back, prolonged practice will lead to its abundant arrival.\n\n**Well and Pool, Issuing Power in Sequence**\nThe *Well* refers to *Jianjing* (Shoulder Well), located at the center of the shoulder’s division. The *Pool* refers to *Quchi* (Crooked Pool), located at the center of the elbow’s division, with one point on each side. These are the cavities through which *jin* is issued outward throughout the body. When practicing, one must not be overly forceful but should proceed with composure. *In sequence* means to enter gradually.\n\n**Myriad Transformations, Yet Never Departing from the Root**\n**Attaining Its Profundity, One Marvels at Its Boundlessness**\nThe *root* is the true *qi* of nature. This summarizes the profundity of internal skill: though its manifestations are countless and its threads myriad, its essential principle never departs from the true *qi* of nature. The learner must first taste its profundity. With prolonged practice, insight will arise, and only then will one marvel at its infinite wonders.\n\n**Raising Qi from the Tortoise Tail, Refining Spirit in the Cinnabar Field**\nThe *Tortoise Tail* is the very end of the coccyx. When force is applied to lift it upward, true *qi* naturally ascends. The *Cinnabar Field* lies 1.2 *cun* below the navel. When practicing, one visualizes true *qi* and primordial spirit gathering here, refining the spirit. These are the mechanisms of spiritual transformation, to be grasped through intuition and insight, not sought through external form.\n\n**Qi Descends to the Sea, Light Gathers at Heaven’s Heart**\nThe center of the lower abdomen is the *Sea of Qi*, and the center of the forehead is *Tianxin* (Heaven’s Heart). When true *qi* descends, one’s countenance naturally radiates majesty—this is the external manifestation of inner sincerity.\n\n**Having Clarified the Meridians, One Must Observe the Forms**\n*Forms* are the fixed rules of entry. As the preceding text states, once the meridians are understood, one must then grasp the body’s fixed forms. Without knowledge of the forms, discussions of meridians remain empty talk.\n\n**Head Upright and Rising, Shoulders Level and Aligned, Chest Projecting and Closed**\nAn upright head strengthens the spirit of the face. Aligned shoulders activate the potential of both flanks. A projecting chest enhances the body’s majesty—these are the forms of the upper body. However, the head must be raised by lifting the neck, the shoulders must be level on all sides without the slightest tilt, and though the chest projects, it must retain a sense of restraint. These are the true secrets of the forms, which one must not fail to understand.\n\n**Feet Firm and Steady, Knees Bent yet Extended**\n**Crotch Deep and Concealed, Ribs Open and Expanded**\nThough the step may rise and fall, the feet must be firmly planted and unwavering. The knees’ function lies in their outward bend and inward straightness—though their posture may be bent, one must intend to extend them. The anterior yin must be drawn back with utmost force to achieve deep concealment. The seams of both ribs must be fully opened to complement the projecting rib posture.\n\n**Qi Harmonized and Even, Power Relaxed yet Tense**\nWhen practicing, *qi* should flow like drawn silk, inhaling and exhaling through the nose to avoid damaging the visceral *qi*. This is why *qi* must be even. *Harmonizing* refers to the breath’s ebb and flow. *Power* must first relax before tension is applied. Only through extreme relaxation can tension reach its peak. Thus, tension arises from relaxation, not the other way around.\n\n**First Inhale, Then Exhale—One Out, One In**\n**First Lift, Then Lower—One Ascend, One Descend**\n**Within Lies the Cinnabar Field, the Destination of Qi**\nBuilding on the preceding, this clarifies the method of using *qi*: inhale and exhale without sound—this is the way to harmonize *qi*. *Lifting* means visualizing true *qi* ascending to the crown. *Lowering* means true *qi* descending after ascent. *Descending* means true *qi* deeply concealed within, gradually gathering and shrinking until it settles in the Cinnabar Field, like a hibernating dragon or a crouching tiger, still and unmoving.\n\n**Lower: Draw In the Valley Passage; Upper: Lift the Jade Tower**\n**Whether Standing or Sitting, Draw Qi to the Throat**\n**Guide It with Intention, Gradually Sinking to the Bottom**\nContinuing from above, this describes the method of descending *qi*. The *Valley Passage* is the posterior yin. Drawing it in prevents *qi* from leaking. The *Jade Tower* refers to the high bone behind the ear.",

      "translated_text": "Lifting ensures that descending *qi* flows without obstruction. Whether sitting or standing, when using *qi*, it must enter through the throat to follow the true path into the lungs, heart, liver, and kidneys. Though *qi* enters the Cinnabar Field, when applying intention, one must visualize true *qi* sinking to the very bottom for the method to be effective.\n\nThere is a path for ascent and a place for descent: the *qi*-route of the transport points. This describes the meridians of true *qi*’s ascent and descent. When ascending, it rises through the gaps between the ribs, so one must exert effort to open and lift upward to naturally find the aperture. When descending, it must enter through the *Shu*-mouth points along the spine, penetrating the front of the heart to follow the true path of *qi*. The *Shu*-mouth point is the seventh vertebra counted from the top of the spine.\n\nHaving clarified the *qi*-apertures, we now explain the secrets of *jin*. *Through, penetrate, pierce, adhere, relax, coalesce, unite, firm*—*through* is the smoothness of *jin*; *penetrate* is its transmission. Continuing from above, this speaks of *jin*’s relaxation and tension, the method of refining *qi*. *Through* and *penetrate* describe unimpeded movement from here to there, embodying the meaning of \"supple softness.\" *Pierce* is the continuity of *jin*; *adhere* is its network. *Pierce* and *adhere* refer to horizontal and vertical connections: horizontal connection is *adhere*, vertical continuity is *pierce*, belonging to the yang extension of sinews and tensile force, signifying rigidity and congealed strength. *Relax* is the dispersion of *jin*; *coalesce* is its gathering. *Relax* is extreme softness, utmost pliability, the intention of nurturing essence and storing vigor. *Coalesce* is extreme hardness, utmost robustness, the congealing and contraction of *qi* and blood. *Relax* is like a rope’s binding; *coalesce* is like ice’s formation. These two interact and complement each other, for softness can aid hardness, and hardness can aid softness. *Unite* is the oneness of *jin*; *firm* is its capability. *Unite* means the body’s bones and joints merge into one; *firm* refers to horizontal and vertical strength, advancing a layer beyond the *pierce* and *adhere* of *jin*.\n\nPress the shoulders to train the steps; squeeze the hips to firm the knees. Round the crotch to firm the hips; lift the chest to lower the waist. These are the true secrets of stepping. Everyone trains their steps, yet few know the secret lies in pressing the shoulders—pressing the *Jianjing* point’s *jin* to sink to the *Yongquan* point at the soles. Everyone knows to firm the knees, yet few know the secret lies in squeezing the hips—pressing the buttocks tightly together. Everyone knows to firm the hips, yet few know the secret lies in rounding the crotch—exerting force to push the crotch outward horizontally. Everyone knows to lower the waist, yet few know the secret lies in lifting the chest—using force to raise it.\n\nLift the chin to align the head; press the back to turn the *dou*. Relax the shoulders to emit *jin*. Exert force to lift the chin bone upward to naturally straighten the neck. Press the two shoulder blades tightly together, intending the *jin* to emerge from beneath the arms to the *Liufu* point, turn outward to the *dou* bone, and return. When emitting *jin*, use the softest intention to relax the *Jianjing* point to ensure no obstruction.\n\nFold the *Tianzhu* to descend *qi*; gaze at *Hegu* to establish the gate. The *Tianzhu* point is on the high bone at the back; when ascending and descending *qi*, press it tightly to naturally find its aperture. The *Hegu* point, commonly called the \"tiger’s mouth,\" when facing an opponent, raise the hand to ear level, focus the gaze upon it—this is the method of the mysterious gate.\n\nDistinguish clearly between horizontal and vertical *jin*: the horizontal aids the vertical, the vertical employs the horizontal. Regarding the whole body, from the crown of the head to the soles of the feet is vertical *jin*; from the spine to the fingertips is horizontal *jin*. Regarding the back alone, from the armpits to the *Yunmen* points at the shoulders is vertical *jin*; from the *Liufu* point turning to the *dou* bone is horizontal *jin*. Regarding the legs alone, from the inner hips to the soles is vertical *jin*; from the knees to the buttocks is horizontal *jin*. In sum, within the horizontal there is vertical, and within the vertical there is horizontal. When facing an opponent, the horizontal overcomes the vertical, and the vertical overcomes the horizontal.\n\nThe Five *Qi* Gather at the Origin, circulating endlessly. The four limbs’ primacy lies in their wondrous gathering and containment. This summarizes the unified Dao of internal practice: inhale the essence-*qi* of heaven and earth into the Cinnabar Field, then circulate the true *qi* of the Cinnabar Field from the armpits to ascend to the crown. When ascending *qi*, true *qi* naturally descends from the *Shu*-mouth to the Cinnabar Field—this is the first *qi* gathering at the origin. Circulate the true *qi* of the Cinnabar Field from within the crotch downward to the soles; when descending *qi*, true *qi* naturally rises from the soles, ascending from the outer crotch to the Cinnabar Field—left and right together count as the second *qi* gathering at the origin. Circulate the true *qi* of the Cinnabar Field from beneath the back to the Cinnabar Field—left and right together count as the third *qi* gathering at the origin. In total, the Five *Qi* gather at the origin. One ascent and one descent, one lowering and one rising, one exit and one entry proceed without conflict, circulating endlessly without pause. With prolonged practice, wondrous effects abound—this is the ultimate method of refining spirit to return to the origin.\n\nHeaven and earth unite in harmony; water ascends and fire descends. Head and feet, above and below, connect as if by spirit. Continuing from above, with prolonged and refined practice of gathering at the origin, true water naturally ascends and true fire naturally descends. The upper and lower spirit-*qi* are refined into a seamless whole, like heaven and earth uniting in harmony, a scene of divine transformation beyond measure.\n\nIn stillness, radiance ascends; in motion, it soars. Continuing from above, this speaks of the internal apertures of practice and the external signs of its verification.",

      "translated_text": "When true *qi* is abundant within, its radiance manifests externally, though concealed and unmoving. The face glows with divine light, essence shining afar, making it impossible for others to gaze directly—this is the wondrous effect of stillness. *Qi* surges through the form, the form following *qi*; intent commands spirit, spirit commands *qi*, and *qi* commands the form. Thus, wherever spirit and *qi* lead, the body is never encumbered, like a dragon soaring through clouds or a bird gliding through the sky, appearing suddenly and vanishing in an instant—this is the marvel of the practice.\n\n*(Internal Practice Classic concludes; awaiting the Hexagram Classic to follow.)*\n\n**Hexagram Classic**\n\nThe head’s method follows *Qian* (☰), drawing from its strength, purity, and vigor. The feet and knees follow *Kun* (☻), drawing from its stability, tranquility, and capacity to bear. The head governs the body of *Qian*, serving as the leader of the entire form, embodying the principle of the origin. It lifts the body’s *qi* and blood, embodying the principle of flourishing. It should adapt fluidly to an opponent, avoiding rigidity, embodying the principle of benefit. It should stand firm, upright, and elevated, avoiding slant or collapse, embodying the principle of constancy. If too low, it resembles the \"hidden dragon\" of inaction; if too raised, it risks the calamity of the \"exalted dragon’s regret.\" Neither raised nor lowered, centered and properly aligned, spirit radiates forth—this is how one meets a formidable foe.\n\nThe *nine in the second* speaks of \"the dragon seen in the field\" and \"the flying dragon in the heavens,\" an image of meeting the celestial. Yet this is an external manifestation, not the inner meaning. The *nine in the fourth* says, \"Perhaps leaping in the abyss, without blame.\" Understanding this profound principle reveals the subtle essence of the head’s method. The *nine in the fourth* resides at the base of the upper trigram and the top of the lower, symbolizing the crown. The body’s *qi*, from the heart, surges upward through the crown, embodying the head’s strength and purity—is this not akin to leaping? Yet *qi*, as an entity, can be spoken of but not seen, profound and unfathomable—is it not like the emptiness of the abyss? The first *nine*, *nine in the second*, *nine in the fifth*, and *top nine* all speak of the dragon, but this line alone says \"perhaps.\" Observing this line’s *qi*, ascending from the *first nine*’s concealment to the *nine in the fifth*’s rise and fall, the mechanism of floating and sinking, the natural flow of heavenly principle—one must not cling even slightly to form. Just as the body’s *qi* descends from the crown, true *qi* ascends to the ears, then descends to the mouth, transforming into sweet dew, leaving no trace to point to. The head’s practice outwardly reflects the images of the *nine in the second* and *nine in the fifth*, while inwardly embodying the meaning of the *nine in the fourth*—thus it is without blame.\n\nYet there is further meaning: such practice is profoundly subtle and boundless. The practitioner must delve deeply and experience it naturally. If one acts with impatience or recklessness, the body will only suffer harm—what benefit can come of it? Therefore, \"all day long, *Qian* remains vigilant; even at dusk, it is cautious.\" Whether learning the Dao or martial arts, this must be taken as the rule.\n\nThe feet and knees should be settled and tranquil, not restless or agitated, taking their image from *Kun*. The body’s entire practice relies on the two feet and knees to gather it, just as all things under heaven depend on *Kun*’s earth to bear them. The lower trigram represents the feet, the upper trigram the knees. *Initial six: Treading on frost, solid ice arrives*—this draws from the primal stability of stillness. Yin *qi* condenses and refines, gradually becoming firm. *Six in the second: Straight, square, and great; without practice, nothing is unfavorable*—this speaks of the primal stability of stillness, naturally upright, square, and expansive, requiring no forced effort, and all it encounters proceeds smoothly. *Six in the third: Containing brilliance, it can be steadfast; or following the king’s affairs, without achievement yet with completion*—this speaks of embodying a correct and expansive form, inwardly able to be steadfast and guard itself, outwardly able to follow a superior’s affairs. Though it cannot achieve its own way, it can preserve its end. *Six in the fourth: Tying up the sack, without blame or praise*—this speaks of the knees’ function: one must not act recklessly to seek praise. *Six in the fifth: Yellow skirts, primal auspiciousness*—this speaks of the tiger’s eyes facing outward and *Weizhong* (委中) inward, embracing the middle way before achieving primal auspiciousness. *Top six: Dragons battle in the wild; their blood is dark yellow*—this warns against excessive yin stillness, which harms transformation. Thus, when yin reaches its extreme, yang is born; when stillness reaches its extreme, movement arises. Though outwardly settled, the inner true *qi* surges upward from *Yongquan* (涌泉), yang born beneath the multitude of yin—this embodies the meaning of *Earth-Thunder Revival* (地雷復).\n\nThe head’s practice is upright without slant, extended without contraction, neither reversed nor tilted, neither lowered nor raised—these are its external manifestations. As for its fullness, robust bearing, and martial majesty, all are the work of *qi*. One must observe the *Hukou* (虎口) point to determine the body’s lateral alignment. If the chin is raised, it risks tilting upward; if the spine is slightly raised, it avoids sinking—one must be cautious. Behind each ear lies a prominent bone, the *tiqi* (提气) point. When lifting *qi*, it must rise straight upward to avoid the peril of tilting or reversing. Yet one must use *qi* evenly on both sides; otherwise, if it leans to one side, it will inevitably reverse. If the practitioner does not know this aperture, even with great skill, the true *qi* of the *dantian* cannot ascend to the crown—how then can one achieve the image of strength, purity, and vigor?\n\nWhenever extending a hand, one must observe the *Hukou* point, lifting the front of the chin with balanced force, neither raised nor lowered, while the *Jiaji* (夹脊) point presses downward with effort. When the true *qi* of the *dantian* arrives, it reaches straight to the *tiqi* point, where force is applied to lift it. Passing through *Baihui* (百会), it turns to *Kunlun* (昆仑), descends to *Mingtang* (明堂), and flows into both eyes. When the *qi* seeks to escape through the nose, it is immediately drawn back into the *dantian*. Three *cun* and six *fen* below each ear lies the *dingyan* (顶眼) point, where force is applied downward to stabilize it, unifying the entire body’s structure. With prolonged practice, its wonders will naturally be understood.",

      "translated_text": "The human body stands solely upon two feet, with all bones and flesh relying on them for support. If one’s training is not refined, there remains the risk of stumbling—how much more so for those utterly devoid of strength? With every step, the feet must be rooted to the earth: the big toes press inward with force, the heels likewise turn inward, and the high bones behind the big toes’ soles mark the true acupoints. The entire body’s power is directed downward to anchor them, so that while the knees may move, the feet remain unmoved—like wind shaking a tree, swaying its trunk but leaving its roots undisturbed.\n\nThose who train the knees in the world know only to keep them straight when standing and bent when sitting. Even among the few who grasp the broader principle, their skill remains superficial. How could they fathom that the knees possess fourfold power in all directions? With every step, the outer *huyan* points exert force inward, while the inner *huyan* points press outward with equal vigor. The two great sinews of *Weizhong* must be kept tautly straight, while the *gaigu* bones strive to bend. As these four forces converge, uniting the body’s strength, a single outward twist will allow the *qi* of *Yongquan* to pierce through its center.\n\nTraining is like glue adhering to an object—once set, it becomes unbreakable; like fire tempering metal—once fused, it cannot be pried apart. Its subtleties defy verbal transmission. The practitioner must ponder the principles of the *Kun* hexagram to grasp its essence inwardly.\n\nMoreover, all ten toes must grip the earth with force, yet this must be coordinated with the body’s entire structure to achieve true mastery. If timing is uneven—whether early or late—the method is flawed.\n\nWhen engaging an opponent, if the right step is used, the left knee may slightly straighten, and if the left step is used, the right knee may do the same. Though one must not be rigidly bound by this rule, neither should one overdo it. The essential principle is to avoid losing one’s *yuanqi*. Viewed from the front, the knees appear aligned; from behind, the coccyx seems to rest upon something. With chest sunken and waist lowered, one does not lose forward concealment; with knees firm and steps closed, one avoids leaning backward. Stillness and tranquility govern all.\n\nThe shoulders and back should remain supple and lively, embodying the meaning of *Xun*’s compliance. The crotch and hips, however, must be drawn taut, reflecting the nature of *Dui*’s joy. The shoulders and back take their image from *Xun*: a single yin line crouched beneath two yang lines, outwardly strong yet inwardly yielding. The *Xun* hexagram’s *First Six* states, *\"Advancing and retreating benefit the steadfastness of the warrior,\"* for only when tempered by compliance can strength move with flexibility. *Nine in the Third* says, *\"Compliance beneath the bed, employing shamans and mediums—auspicious, without blame,\"* meaning that one who embodies compliance acts from below yet, like a shaman’s accumulated sincerity, can commune with spirits. *Nine in the Third* further warns, *\"Frequent compliance brings regret,\"* for strength’s advance and retreat must arise naturally—excessive rigidity and imbalance lead only to misfortune. *Six in the Fourth* states, *\"Regret vanishes; in the field, three kinds of game are captured,\"* for after regret fades, one’s gains follow. *Nine in the Fifth*, *\"Firm and central, residing in the middle path of compliance—steadfast and auspicious,\"* embodies the hexagram’s essence. Even without profound insight at first, prolonged compliance yields this marvel, benefiting all actions regardless of sequence. *Top Nine* cautions, *\"Compliance beneath the bed, losing one’s resources and axe,\"* for excessive compliance without restraint depletes one’s *yuanqi*.\n\nThe crotch and hips take their image from *Dui*: inner firmness and outer softness, the softness likened to the abdomen, the firmness to the thighs. The abdomen rests upon the thighs, yin riding over yang. Fearing yang’s excess rigidity, it is tempered by curvature to complete its posture—this is the thigh’s role. Fearing yin’s excess softness, it is bolstered by solidity to invigorate its spirit—this is the abdomen’s function. When *Dui* meets *Kan*, it becomes *Jie* (節, restraint), for restraint imposes limits to prevent excess. *Dui* is the marsh, *Kan* is water—the external kidneys and the anus. Water in a marsh easily leaks; *qi* reaching the abdomen likewise risks dissipation, hence the value of restraint. When *Dui* meets *Li*, it becomes *Guai* (乖, discord), for *Li* is fire, dryness, and upward flaring. The crotch should be refined and concealed, the hips firm and stable—if fiery and restless, discord arises. Yet within firmness, there must be suppleness; within stillness, movement—without becoming rigid or stagnant. Thus, when *Dui* meets *Gen*, it becomes *Sun* (損, reduction), for a mountain that does not move is diminished. It must move without losing stillness, be still without losing movement, firm without losing suppleness, and supple without losing firmness. When *Dui* meets *Zhen*, it becomes *Sui* (隨, following), for *Zhen* is thunder—when thunder moves, rain falls, and the marsh fills, its *qi* descending. When marsh water rises as clouds, true *qi* ascends.\n\nThose who train the shoulders and back often find that straightness precludes bending, bending precludes straightness, relaxation precludes tension, and tension precludes relaxation—all because they fail to grasp the body of inner firmness and outer softness, the function of inner compliance and outer strength. The *Jianjing* points must be pressed downward with force, the shoulders drawn inward to cling together, and the entire back extended outward. From within the spine, intent directs power outward. The hands must grip firmly, the whole body locked securely, enabling straightness within curvature, curvature within straightness, tension within relaxation, and relaxation within tension. With prolonged practice, the profound principle of inner softness and outer firmness, inner compliance and outer strength, will be revealed—pondering the *Xun* hexagram’s line texts will unveil its wonders.\n\nTo press the *Jianjing* points downward, the shoulder peaks must descend straight to meet the spine’s apex, the *Quchi* points slightly lower than the shoulder peaks by half an inch. The wrists align with the brows, and though the spine presses with maximal force, it remains a vertical power, not a horizontal one—for verticality is solid, horizontality is hollow.",

The hips must be divided into front and rear: the front hip exerts force forward, not downward; the rear hip exerts force downward, neither forward nor backward. When the *qi* of the *Yongquan* points surges upward with great intensity, press the hips down with maximal force—the more you press, the more it rises; the more it rises, the more you press. Contract the yin and yang orifices with force, preventing the circulating *qi* from leaking through the feet.

      "translated_text": "The chest takes its meaning from *Gen*, and *Gen* is mountain. One yang above two yins—its image is mountain, to which the human chest is likened. That which is rooted in Heaven and Earth clings to the upper *qi*; that which is rooted in Earth clings to the lower form. *Qi* tends toward floating and must be anchored; this is the inner meaning of the chest. Form tends toward sinking and must be uplifted; this is the outer meaning of the chest.\n\nThe chest’s *qi* ascends to the crown of the head—the crown is the *Qian* trigram, Heaven. Thus, when *Gen* meets Heaven, it becomes *Great Accumulation*: *qi* accumulates within and rises above. It descends to the feet and knees—the feet and knees are the *Kun* trigram, Earth. Thus, when Earth lies beneath mountain, it becomes *Modesty*: the *qi* of the feet embraces the chest, just as Earth, though lowly, embraces the mountain, and the mountain cannot but yield to it.\n\nThe ribs gather their image from *Zhen*, and *Zhen* is movement, thunder. One yang stirs beneath two yins—thunder bursts forth and surges upward; the ribs are likened to this, embodying the image of Heaven above and the meaning of Earth below. When Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang intersect, thunder and rain arise, and the myriad things are born. When the human body’s upper and lower unite, blood and *qi* flow, and true power emerges—this principle is one and the same.\n\nThe ribs’ *qi* ascends to meet the head, so when thunder encounters Heaven, it becomes *Great Strength*: true *qi* rises to the crown, vigorous from the outset, and power naturally becomes great. The ribs’ *qi* descends to meet the feet, so when thunder encounters Earth, it becomes *Delight*: true *qi* descends to the feet and knees, yielding in movement, and spirit and *qi* become joyful.\n\nWith each breath, each ascent and descent, the mouth and nose are outwardly visible, but inwardly, the heart and chest are essential—yet the crux lies in the ribs. The chest is emptiness; emptiness cannot exert force and must be governed by *qi*. Yet *qi* arises from the ribs—if the ribs are not employed, how can the chest be used? For that which is unequal in motion must also be unequal in stillness. The *Gen* trigram’s words say: “When it is time to move, move; when it is time to stop, stop.” Its meaning runs deep.\n\nThe ribs are harmony (*xie*): like a fish’s gills, opening and closing, *qi* ascends and descends. When closed, they harmonize below with the *dantian*, behind with the two kidneys. A single stream of great *qi* descends from beneath the skull, passing through the inner thighs to settle at the *Yongquan* point, then reverses upward along the great tendons of the feet, rising through the *Weizhong* points to penetrate the *Jiaji* via the *Weilü*, where it meets the ribs. When opened, it is like thunder surging from Earth to Heaven—its *qi* naturally ascends, one stream entering the chest and center, another entering the two backs, reaching the *Niwan* palace. Vertically, it rises straight to the crown; horizontally, it extends to the fingertips.\n\nThe ribs’ opening and closing are the *qi*’s breathing, circulating endlessly without reversal or disorder. Carefully ponder the meanings of *Gen* and *Zhen*’s top and bottom lines, and you will grasp the marvel of their upper and lower connection. The chest may protrude but not rise too high; the ribs may close but not constrict, may expand but not splay. Within this lies profound subtlety, difficult to convey by word alone.\n\nThe ribs must be guided by intent, overcome by *qi*, and led by spirit—this is the proper form, not by bone, flesh, or sinew. Employing the ribs is the opening and closing of *qi*’s breath; the hands’ entry and exit are opening and closing; the body’s vertical and horizontal movements are opening and closing. To seek this in bone, flesh, skin, or blood is mistaken.\n\nIn high stances, power lies in the feet; in middle stances, in the ribs; in low stances, in the back—this is the natural principle. *Kan* and *Li* are the images of water and fire: water aids fire, fire aids water. The heart and kidneys are the viscera of water and fire: water should ascend, fire should descend. The trigrams *Kan* and *Li* embody this inner meaning of the body—it can be grasped by intent but is hard to express in words. If I were to speak recklessly, I fear this Way would be lost. Now, from what cannot be spoken, I reluctantly put it into words—students must ponder it carefully.\n\n*Li* is fire; *Kan* is water. In the human body, they are the heart and kidneys. The kidneys belong to water, the heart to fire. Fire’s nature is to rise easily but descend with difficulty; water’s nature is to descend easily but ascend with difficulty. Thus, when the heart stirs, fire surges upward; when emotions stir, water sinks downward—this is the proof.\n\nFire must be aided by water to prevent yang excess and illness; water must be aided by fire to prevent yin excess and calamity. From ancient times, Confucians’ self-cultivation and Daoists’ inner alchemy have all been based on this principle—truly, its profundity is boundless. How could this concern only martial arts? Even in discussing martial valor, its benefits are immense.\n\nTo cultivate valor, one must study power; to study power, one must rely on *qi*; to rely on *qi*, one must clarify water and fire. For when water and fire fail to interact, true *qi* dissipates. When *qi* dissipates, illness arises, and the body cannot be preserved—how much less power? Thus, for martial valor, one must study power; to study power, one must nurture *qi*; to nurture *qi*, one must regulate water and fire—this is an unchanging principle.\n\nThe *Li* trigram has yin within and yang without—fire contains true water. The *Kan* trigram has yang within and yin without—water contains true fire. True fire can aid true water; true water can aid true fire. Only through mutual assistance and supplementation is true *qi* properly nurtured.\n\nWhen practicing, sinking the shoulders, hollowing the chest and ribs, and retracting the *guiwei* all aim to guide kidney *qi* upward to the heart. This must be directed by intent. Training the steps and gathering the sinews of the feet all aim to guide heart *qi* downward to the kidneys—this, too, must be directed by intent, achieving harmony in the circulation of *qi*’s patterns.",

      "translated_text": "**External Applications (Two Methods):**\nWhen the opponent attacks the upper body at close range, use *lifting-knee*; when attacking below, use *kneeling-knee*. Both adapt to the opponent’s angle—whether level or slanted—changing spontaneously without fixed form.\n\n**Third Great Strength: Crotch and Hips**\n\"Crotch\" refers to the inner crotch; \"hips\" to the outer hips. When two opponents close in, sink the body’s full strength downward—both inner crotch and outer hips can overcome the foe. However, this requires perfect alignment of posture; forced execution will fail entirely. Details are found in the classics.\n\n**Fourth Great Strength: Chest and Back**\nOnce internal work is mastered, the chest and back both possess great strength to subdue an opponent. There is no particular subtlety: when blocking the opponent’s hands, use the back to yield space, preventing their attack.\n\n**Fifth Great Strength: Head**\nWith internal work accomplished, not only can the chest and back subdue, but even the head may secure victory. Its applications are two: *side-butting* and *frontal-butting*.\n- *Side-butting*: When the opponent is before you, turn sideways and strike.\n- *Frontal-butting*: When the opponent is above you, strike directly upward.\nYet one must also guard against the opponent’s hands.\n\n**Sixth Great Strength: Three Gates**\n\"Three Gates\" refers to the shoulders. Three methods employ the shoulders: keep the hands drawn in, pressed close to the thighs, and apply with small body movements. Whether used sideways, level, above, or below, all belong to the *scattered and closed gates* of combat—difficult to exhaust in writing. Generally, they require internal work to be effective.\n\n**Seventh Great Strength: Two Gates**\n\"Two Gates\" refers to the elbows. This strength is the swiftest of the Twelve Great Strengths to achieve. Its applications are two: *horizontal-elbow* and *vertical-elbow*.\n- *Vertical-elbow*: Raise the hand beside the face and strike with the elbow.\n- *Horizontal-elbow*: Hold the hand before the chest and strike with the elbow.\nThough methods vary, all derive from these.\n\n**Eighth Great Strength: Piercing Bone**\nWhen the opponent attacks from above, extend the entire body with full force forward to pierce through. Their strength will break, and you will secure complete victory. However, the fighting stance must rise from the side, the rear foot pressing forward to drive the front foot’s piercing force—otherwise, it blends with the *through-punch*.\n\n**Ninth Great Strength: Hardening Bone**\nWhen the opponent attacks from below, seal one of their hands with yours, then drop the entire body’s force fiercely to achieve total victory. The stance must rise from the side to execute this properly. The hardness’s degree depends entirely on the depth of internal work.\n\n**Tenth Great Strength: Inner-Sweeping**\nWhen the opponent attacks from within, overcome them with *sweeping strength*. Its applications are three:\n- *Upper-sweep* breaks the opponent’s upper-route strength,\n- *Middle-sweep* breaks their middle-route strength,\n- *Lower-sweep* breaks their lower-route strength.\nAll seal the opponent’s hands before use.\n\n**Eleventh Great Strength: Outer-Blocking Strength**\nWhen the opponent attacks from the outer gate, overcome them with *blocking strength*. This also divides into *upper-block*, *middle-block*, and *lower-block*. Yet with internal work mastered, one need not rigidly adhere: if distant, block the opponent’s hands; if near, block their body. There is no place that cannot be blocked—let the practitioner grasp this intuitively.\n\n**Twelfth Great Strength: Lifting-Attack**\nHarden the hand’s tip through internal work, like the motion of lifting an object, to strike the opponent. Once this strength is achieved, a mere touch can hurl them several paces away. The hand must not extend too far—let the opponent be just an inch away before lifting for optimal effect. If they are too distant, advance with steps. Its applications are five:\n- *Inner-lift* attacks the opponent at the inner gate,\n- *Outer-lift* attacks the opponent at the outer gate,\n- *Upper-lift* attacks the opponent’s high posture,\n- *Lower-lift* attacks their low posture,\n- *Direct-lift* attacks the opponent head-on.\nHow to issue strength, body method, and footwork upon contact are all detailed in the classics.\n\n*(The* Divine Transmission Classic *concludes. The* Eight Gates of Internal Work Combat *follow.)*\n\n**Eight Gates of Internal Work Combat**\n\n**First Gate**\nThis gate is best entered with the left foot forward, right hand extended, and the body turned sideways for stability.\n- **Mounted Stance**: The three points align as if riding a horse. The entire body’s internal work is engaged.\n- **Flying Right Posture**: Step forward with the right foot and strike the opponent’s left ribs with the right hand.\n- **Right Hardening-Bone Strength**\n- **Left Hand Parries Up, Right Hand Mounted Stance**: Use the left hand to deflect the opponent’s hand outward, then advance the right leg into a single-step mounted stance and strike the chest with the right hand.\n- **Left Outer-Blocking Strength**\n- **Retreating Step, Right Hand Hooking-Hanging**: With small steps, retreat and drag the opponent’s right elbow with your right elbow, hooking both wrist and hand.\n- **Right Inner-Sweeping Strength**\n- **Advancing Elbow**: Seize the opponent’s hooking force to step in and strike their chest with the right elbow.\n- **Right Two-Gates Strength**\n- **Left Hand Sealing-Wresting**: First seal with the left hand forcefully, then extend the right hand to wrest the opponent’s right hand.\n- **Right Hardening-Bone Strength**\n- **Flipping Right Hand-Tip, Advancing Right Hand**: As both wrestle, flip the right hand-tip from outside to inside to strike the ribs.\n- **Right Inner-Sweeping Strength**\n- **Left Hand Chiseling**: When the opponent’s right hand comes, use the left hand to drag forcefully from below upward.\n- **Left Piercing-Bone Strength**\n- **Flipping Right Hand-Tip, Advancing Right Hand**: If the opponent seals with the left hand, flip the right hand again from outside to inside to strike the left ribs.\n- **Right Outer-Blocking Strength**\n- **Retreating Small Step, Right Hand Wresting**: With a small step, drag the opponent’s hand outward, then wrest with the right hand.",
      "overlap_context": "t,\nNo matter how force is applied,\nRemaining immovably stable is the work of root-tempering.\nIts methods are all found in the internal classics;\nExternally, there are two applications:\nTo hook the opponent’s hands or feet, curl the toes inward and overcome with external strength;\nTo block the opponent’s feet, sink the crotch’s strength fully into the ground and prevail with internal strength.\n\n**Second Great Strength: Knee-Strengthening**\n\"Firmness\" arises naturally after applying internal work.",

Regardless of the opponent’s height, reach, or power, all can be overcome with *ground-attacking strength*. For humans, the upper body is often solid, while the lower body is often weak. Even in ordinary sparring, attacking below is more effective than attacking above—how much more so against those with great internal power! However, to practice this method, one must first master the *Internal Power Classic*, *Trigram Absorption Classic*, and *Spiritual Movement Classic*, training them to proficiency before applying the *Earth Dragon Classic*. Otherwise, the forms will be empty, and the secrets contained within the classics will remain unknown.\n\nThough the *Earth Dragon Classic* forms a complete system, its principles interweave with the *qi* channels and connections of the *Internal Power*, *Trigram Absorption*, and *Spiritual Movement Classics*, mutually reinforcing each other. Scholars must not overlook this. The *Earth Dragon* system is entirely encompassed by the two words: *ground attack*. Though it contains boundless discussions, principles, methods, and transformations, all emerge from these two words.\n\n**Second Section**\n*Train the entire body on the ground to strengthen essence and clarity*. When facing an opponent, do not merely train the soles of the feet—lying fully on the ground further trains *qi*, blood, sinews, and spirit, enabling the use of whole-body power in all directions. Only then can one control and release. Training *qi* solidifies, training sinews strengthens, and training spirit sharpens. This work lies in daily practice, as described in the classics—do not resort to heterodox methods.\n\n**Third Section**\n*Extension can become contraction; stillness can become movement. Contraction resembles a crouching tiger; extension compares to a soaring dragon. Movement and stillness leave no trace; contraction and extension conceal their tracks.*\n\nThis means that when the opponent approaches, I immediately lower my body to the ground. Press both hands forward on the ground while the soles of the feet remain planted, then lift the entire body to hover above the earth. From there, respond to the opponent’s position and apply techniques freely—this is the standard method. If using contraction, gather whole-body power and drag backward with both hands to rise from a crouch. If extending, thrust forward with both feet to strike the opponent. There is no fixed pattern for movement or stillness; adapt to the opponent’s actions. When they are still, I move—all to prevent the opponent from discerning my traces.",

      "translated_text": "Occasionally, contract the body so that neither hands nor feet are visible, concealing oneself with full power. Rest the head upon the hands to observe the opponent’s strength and weakness, assuming the posture of a crouching tiger. Hands and feet remain capable of striking the enemy as if rising to stand normally. When leaping, extend the entire body straight—whether turning or rolling, one can still subdue the opponent. Rising and twisting freely, one crouches like a soaring dragon.\n\nThus, to crouch one must first leap, and to leap one must first crouch. Crouching is the momentum of leaping, and leaping is the mechanism of crouching. One leap and one crouch, one extension and one contraction—transformation appears.\n\n**Fourth Technique**\nThe body is firm as iron, the method dense as a dragon, overturning like fierce tigers and leopards, turning swift as falcons and eagles. This technique emphasizes the four characters: firmness, density, swiftness, and ferocity. Yet without comprehending the entire system of the Four Classics, one cannot grasp its subtlety. Only after thoroughly understanding the Four Classics and then applying them can one act freely.\n\nFor if not dense, one loses; if not firm, one falters. Once the body touches the ground, the enemy is drawn into one’s trap and cannot escape. Moreover, one must overturn with the ferocity of tigers and leopards, and coil with the swiftness of falcons and eagles—only then will there be no gaps. Otherwise, even if the enemy is caught in the technique, one cannot achieve the desired effect.\n\nTurning and rolling, crouching and rising, constitute the *overturning force*; left and right rotations constitute the *shifting force*. When rotating, both feet extend straight; when overturning, slightly bend one foot—only then can vertical and horizontal forces remain distinct and unconfused.\n\n**Fifth Technique**\nDistinguish clearly between front and back, left and right. When the enemy approaches head-on, throw the entire body backward to land behind them, leaving them no time to react. This is called *forward collapse*; otherwise, falling backward onto the ground would place one at a disadvantage, with the enemy controlling from afar while one controls from close range. The subsequent method is called *backward collapse*. As for front, back, left, and right, these rely on the skill of leaping and dodging.\n\nIf the enemy attacks directly, shift the entire body outward—left or right—to make their strike miss, then immediately drop to the ground. Seize the moment to apply techniques; by the time the enemy adjusts their stance, they will have already fallen into one’s method. A single collapse secures victory—one need not meticulously distinguish front, back, left, or right to reach this realm of transformation.\n\n**Sixth Technique**\nThe stance has variations, the method has no fixed form. The *stance* refers to the posture one adopts: crouching can shift to rising, rising to crouching; side can become reverse, reverse can become side—these are the rules for establishing stances according to the moment, not to be rigidly adhered to.\n\nAs for the method, there is no set pattern: sometimes the method follows the stance, sometimes the stance follows the method, and at times the method departs from the stance or the stance from the method—all depends on daily mastery of the Four Classics. Only with profound understanding can one respond naturally in the moment. Without it, even with verbal instruction, one cannot grasp the essence, let alone through mere observation.\n\nTurning, rolling, crouching, and rising are the *stances*; hand and foot attacks are the *methods*. When the stance is near, the method changes; when the method is near, the stance changes. Endless coiling gives rise to layers of subtle techniques.\n\n**Seventh Technique**\nFrontal attacks employ the palm; the second and third stances share this principle. A *frontal attack* means when the enemy is before you, respond by attacking with your front. Use the palm—regardless of left or right—first seal their heel with one hand, then with the upper hand forcefully bend their knee outward from the inside. Alternatively, use both hands to seal their feet. The upper three stances fiercely attack the *Zusanli* point.\n\nIf the enemy’s foot is near your chest, swiftly bend your three stances from top to bottom to strike their instep—this too can secure victory. The second stance method is most effective when executed swiftly. If the enemy presses too close, guard against their foot attack, which is why the *dispersing stance* should not be used lightly.\n\n**Eighth Technique**\nRear attacks employ the foot; both heel and knee are applicable. When the enemy is below you, respond by attacking with your lower body. Use the foot—regardless of left or right—first entangle one of their feet, then advance the other foot to forcefully strike their knee. Whether turning, rolling, crouching, or rising, left or right, up or down, one can bend, extend, rotate, and maneuver freely. Success requires exhausting all subtleties without the slightest obstruction to be considered proper.\n\nWhen using the heel: if the enemy’s step is slightly distant and your foot can reach but not entangle, there is no need for entanglement. Simply lift one foot into the air and strike their instep from above. If they retract, immediately launch the other foot to strike again. If the enemy’s step is near your crotch, there is no need to switch to the previous method—simply use a kneeling strike to their instep to secure victory.\n\nThe above six methods are also mentioned in the *Neigong Dispersing Stance*, but all derive from this entanglement—there is no separate doctrine. The *heel* refers to the high bone at the back of the foot. Though described as striking from above, it is actually a diagonal strike, not a direct one. *Kneeling* refers to both knees. When using them, do not lift too high—excessive height renders the strike weak and powerless.\n\n**Ninth Technique**\nWhen distant, pursue and strike; when near, intercept. If the enemy suddenly retreats, do not allow them to withdraw freely—pursue them. However, pursuit does not require changing to a high stance; press both hands to the ground, lift the crotch, and extend both feet forward from beneath it—greater distance is preferable.\n\nIf the feet have already closed in the previous stance, bend the entire body and propel forward with both hands—this too can close the distance, with greater distance being ideal. When pursuing and applying techniques, freely alternate among the six methods above. If, just as you set the technique, the enemy suddenly advances, do not dodge left, right, front, or back.",
      "overlap_context": "ted, then lift the entire body to hover above the earth. From there, respond to the opponent’s position and apply techniques freely—this is the standard method. If using contraction, gather whole-body power and drag backward with both hands to rise from a crouch. If extending, thrust forward with both feet to strike the opponent. There is no fixed pattern for movement or stillness; adapt to the opponent’s actions. When they are still, I move—all to prevent the opponent from discerning my traces.",

      "translated_text": "**Following the Momentum to Apply Technique**\nSeize the opportunity to engage with method—do not wait for the enemy to steady their stance and settle into position before advancing swiftly, for this is the way to ensure no technique misses its mark. The method of pursuit shares the same principle as *Divine Qi Circulation*, relying entirely on the two characters \"suspended crotch.\" If the whole body lacks great strength, and the hands do not press firmly into the earth, the crotch cannot be suspended—how then could the feet leap and pursue at a distance? Only after internal skill and *Divine Qi Circulation* are thoroughly refined can this technique reveal its wonders.\n\n**Tenth Technique**\n*The Greater Hip Rests on the Ground, the Body Forms a Sideways Stance*\nThe \"greater hip\" refers to the outer hip bone. \"The greater hip rests on the ground\" means establishing a sideways stance on one’s side. Whenever employing this sideways falling stance, the tip of the single hip bone must touch the ground, both hands lightly pressing into the earth, while feet and knees lift entirely—thus enabling sinuous bending, stretching, and rolling movements, all derived from the sideways stance. In this technique, the hands must press lightly into the ground; if they bear weight, they become cumbersome. Press and lift in alternation, and the whole body will remain agile. One may also use only the two \"gates\" (hands) to touch the ground, allowing the feet to execute techniques freely as the situation demands.\n\n**Eleventh Technique**\n*Reclining as if Seated, the Tailbone Alone Bears the Weight*\nWhen a person reclines on the ground, none do not sit with their entire buttocks. Yet to sit with the buttocks is to collapse the stance. To execute techniques, only the tip of the tailbone should touch the ground, while hands, feet, and body all lift—uniting the entire posture. Turn left to move left, turn right to move right, and apply techniques at will, all striking the vital points. One may also use only the hands to press into the ground, suspending the lower body to execute techniques and control the opponent. However, this is not as fluid or wondrous as the fully lifted posture, where above, both hands may be employed, and below, both feet—far more versatile and marvelous. Mastering this technique allows left and right spiraling, always centered on the vital pivot. Its subtlety defies description. Yet one must understand its principle: the tailbone serves as the pivot. If the buttocks press fully into the ground, the technique is lost entirely.\n\n**Twelfth Technique**\n*Height and Depth at Will, Distance and Range Unrestrained*\nSome believe this method is limited to ground-level maneuvers, unable to rise for high attacks. Yet who knows that falling and rising at will, leaping and crouching freely, are the very essence of this classic? Any forced movement deviates from the proper form. To execute rising techniques, subtly bend one foot beneath you, gathering the body’s full power from the ground, assisted by both hands or a single hand. Regardless of left or right, reversal or forward lean, the body will naturally rise and fall at will. As for \"unrestrained range,\" employ the high stance to leap outward, use the *Earth Dragon Classic* stance to retract, and deploy the *Earth Dragon* stance to extend—high to strike the enemy above, low to strike below. The key is to conceal all traces, ensuring movements are firm, swift, and fierce. This technique entirely follows the principles of *Divine Qi Circulation*. One who has thoroughly studied *Divine Qi Circulation* will grasp its unrestrained, soaring momentum, comprehend the principles of refining qi and spirit, and naturally achieve seamless mastery.\n\n*(The Orthodox Stances of the Scattered Gates to be continued)*\n*The Orthodox Stances of the Scattered Gates*",

      "translated_text": "**First Stance: Opponent Advances with Right Step and Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent advances with a right step and lifting force (*liao jin*), I use my right hand to intercept their arm, guiding it from above downward and flinging it outward in one motion. Their flank will naturally expose itself. I then swiftly advance with my left *di lian* to seal their right step, employing the full techniques of the Second and Third Gates to attack from the side.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nThis method requires adhering closely to the opponent’s back, using a compact body technique to lift upward—only then is it effective. As the opponent attacks, seize the moment they lower their stance, swiftly execute the right *ju bu* and the full *di lian* force to drive outward, raising the right hand to strike their back with a sweeping force (*lüe jin*). The three forces must be applied simultaneously to prevail.\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nThis is a method for countering upward. When employing it, the legs must be fully extended, channeling the body’s *qi* in a backward diagonal pull—only then will it succeed. Otherwise, if the opponent possesses *di lian* skill, they will not be easily broken.\n\nIf struck on the back, the opponent will inevitably fall forward. Then, seal their right foot with your left, using the *Earth Dragon* ground-rising technique to strike their right leg with a left parry for victory.\n\n**Right, Chapter Three:**\nThis is a \"one counters two\" maneuver. When lowering the body, precision is essential—if you collapse entirely to the ground, rising again will be difficult. Some say employing the Third Gate is even more effective: as the opponent uses the *Earth Dragon* rising technique, before they fully recover, stabilize your right step with *di lian* force, lift your left knee, and strike their left flank for victory.\n\n**Right, Chapter Four:**\nThis is a \"two counters one\" maneuver. Strike precisely as they begin to rise but have not yet fully recovered. If the opponent lifts their left knee, I do not advance; instead, I follow their knee’s forward motion, collapsing outward and rolling the body to adopt the *Crouching Dragon* technique for victory.\n\n**Right, Chapter Five:**\nThis method requires mastery of the *Earth Dragon* technique to be effective. Without it, the timing of rising and falling will be unclear, inviting only ridicule—how can one hope to prevail? After collapsing, one must gather spirit and *qi*, observing the opponent’s movements to launch an attack.\n\nIf the opponent, seeing my position, advances with a low stance and lifting force, I immediately use a left parry to deflect their left hand, then follow with my right hand to strike their chest for victory.\n\n**Right, Chapter Six:**\nThis is a variation building on the previous stance, without profound meaning—only firmness and speed are required.\n\n---\n\n**Second Stance: Opponent Advances with Right Step and Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent advances with a right step and lifting force, I use a left parry (*ge jin*), deflecting their right wrist outward from within. I then advance with my right *di lian*, sealing their right step from without, and apply a right seizing force (*qin jin*) to trap their Third Gate. The three forces must be applied simultaneously to prevail.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nWhen executing this method, the left deflecting hand must be lifted with full force—this will naturally uproot their footing. Both hands and feet must advance together for optimal effect; otherwise, the opponent may retract their leg.\n\nIf the opponent throws me down, I immediately use my right foot’s hooking force (*gou jin*) to entangle their right foot, lowering my body into the full *Earth Dragon* stance. Pressing both hands to the ground and driving with my left foot’s *di* force, I strike their right shin, ensuring their defeat.\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nWhen employing this method, the right leg must be sharply bent while the left leg remains fully extended—only then can the body’s *qi* be properly circulated for effectiveness.\n\nIf the opponent advances with lifting force and I retreat with a right step and parry, but their right hand has already withdrawn, my strike will miss. I then advance to entangle their left hand, lowering my body to attack their flank with the left Third Gate for victory.\n\n**Right, Chapter Three:**\nThis is a variation for attacking downward. Strike swiftly as the opponent retreats, preventing their footwork from settling—this is the method of exploiting emptiness.\n\n---\n\n**Third Stance: Opponent Advances with Right Step and Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent advances with a right step and lifting force, I stealthily advance a small left step, using a left sweeping force (*lüe jin*) to lift their right hand while keeping my body still. If they strike with their left hand, I seize the moment of their extension, swiftly twisting my body to crouch within the Inner Gate, gathering force to attack their flank with the left Third Gate for victory.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nWhen advancing the left step, the posture must already be primed for attack—only by concealing intent will its subtlety be revealed.\n\n---\n\n**Fourth Stance: Opponent Advances with High Right Step and Sweeping Force**\n\nWhen the opponent advances with a high right step and sweeping force, I use a right parry to deflect upward, then advance my left step to intercept and seize them.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nThis method requires the left *di lian* to be firmly grounded to secure victory; otherwise, against a strong opponent, both may collapse together. If the opponent seals my body with their left step and attacks with a pulling force (*ba jin*), I twist my body and strike their inner knee with a firm knee force (*jian xi jin*).\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nThis is a method for countering upward. Strike precisely as the opponent advances with their left step—if they seize you first, escape will be impossible.\n\nIf the opponent attacks my left knee with a firm knee force, I swiftly shift my left step outward, lowering my body to anchor my neck and strike their right flank with my nape.\n\n**Right, Chapter Three:**\nThis is a \"one counters two\" maneuver. The entire body’s stance must be stabilized, using a compact body technique to attack—only then will it be effective.\n\n---\n\n**Fifth Stance: Opponent Advances with High Stance and Dual-Handed Upper Attack**\n\nWhen the opponent advances with a high stance and attacks my upper body with both hands, I use my left hand to coil downward and trap their left hand, and my right hand to coil downward and trap their right hand. Stealthily advancing my left step, I surge forward with my body to strike their chest with chest force (*xiong jin*).\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nThis is a method for attacking the opponent with the entire body—do not confine it to chest force alone. If the opponent attacks from below, this method may still be used, but the hands must coil downward. When sealing the opponent’s hands, ensure they are firmly trapped to prevent withdrawal and counterattacks.",

If long force is used, the opponent may be defeated, but I will not emerge unscathed.\n\nIf the opponent advances with their left step intending to block, I withdraw my right hand and step back with my left, coiling their left step from outside to inside. Then, I seize their right ribs with my left hand and drag outward with both forces.\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nThis is the method of returning upward. It requires clear evasion, first establishing an unassailable position. When executing the right *seizing force*, the entire body’s *qi* must be mobilized.\n\n---\n\n**Ninth Stance: Opponent Delivers Low Right-Hand Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent delivers a low right-hand lifting force, I advance with my right *firm-bone force* to seal their hand. Then, I grasp their hair with my left hand and seize their chin with my right, employing both forces simultaneously.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nThis method contains true subtlety. Do not use excessive force. When sealing their hand, coil their step from the outer gate with your right foot to prevent their retreat.\n\nIf the opponent advances with a high right step and lifting force, I move from the outer gate inward, using my right *blocking force* to deflect their hand. Seizing the moment, I advance my left step and hook their nose bridge from behind their chest with my left hand, applying my entire body’s skill to snap their neck backward.\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nThis is a variation of the previous method. When applying it, ensure the neck is bent toward the opponent’s chest—never to the left, or they will slip free.\n\n---\n\n**Tenth Stance: Opponent Delivers Right-Step Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent delivers a right-step lifting force, I advance my left step with *bottom-refining force* to seal their right foot from outside to inside. Then, I advance my left hand from above to cast their right hand downward, using force to drag it down. Following this, I advance my right hand from above to strike diagonally at their neck.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nWhen casting their hand, if they resist with upward force, making it difficult to drag downward, I instead lift their right hand from below and flip it upward, then advance my right hand to strike their face.\n\nIf the opponent advances their right hand to strike while my hand is already cast and difficult to withdraw, I crouch inward, advance my left step into a kneeling position, and drive my right hand into their chest with the entire body’s force.\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nWhen dropping the left step, evade the opponent’s right hand to establish an unassailable position, ensuring the knee bears force.\n\nIf the opponent attempts to strike my chest, I withdraw both hands, then collapse to the ground. Assuming the *Earth Dragon* (*dilong*) posture, I propel my body forward with full force, using my right foot to sweep their right foot.\n\n**Right, Chapter Three:**\nWhen lunging, the spine must be forcefully lowered, the right foot acting as a step while the left leg extends straight, then sharply bent inward to maximize force.\n\nIf the opponent sweeps my right foot, causing me to fall backward, I do not wait for them to rise. Instead, I roll to the side, pressing both hands to the ground, and employ the *Earth Dragon* posture to rise, striking their left shin with my left foot.\n\n**Right, Chapter Four:**\nThis method requires full extension, striking downward with the left foot from above.\n\n---\n\n**Eleventh Stance: Opponent Delivers Right-Step Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent delivers a right-step lifting force, I immediately crouch backward, pressing both hands to the ground. Assuming the *Earth Dragon* posture, I swing my right leg upward from above to strike their shin.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nWhen applying this method, mobilize the *qi* of the entire body and attack with *firm-bone force*. If the right hand misses, roll the body and strike with the left heel from inside to outside, also employing an upward-to-downward motion.",

Stealthily advancing my left step, I surge forward with my body to strike their chest with chest force (*xiong jin*).\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nThis is a method for attacking the opponent with the entire body—do not confine it to chest force alone. If the opponent attacks from below, this method may still be used, but the hands must coil downward. When sealing the opponent’s hands, ensure they are firmly trapped to prevent withdrawal and counterattacks.",

      "translated_text": "**Twelfth Stance: Opponent Advances with Right-Step Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent advances with a right-step lifting force, I step forward with my right foot, sweeping their hand from inside to outside. Then, I reverse and step forward with my left foot, pressing my back against their chest from below. Crouching, I use both hands to seize their right foot, employing the *Central Full Stance* to crush their knee.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nWhen applying this method, ensure close adherence to prevent their retreat. The left step must be precisely measured so their right foot is exposed before you. When crushing the knee, direct their kneecap upward to shatter the bone—do not allow their *Weizhong* point to face upward, lest I lose leverage.\n\nIf the opponent seeks to crush my knee, I immediately seize their hair, using my left hand to forcefully grip their chin. Employing the *Full-Back Stance*, I break their neck with full-body force.\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nThis must be executed the moment their grasp is unstable. Since their hands target the lower body, I exploit their upper vulnerability—victory is assured. However, if their movement is too swift, I may be unable to react.\n\n---\n\n**Thirteenth Stance: Opponent Wields Blade for a Frontal Thrust**\n\nWhen the opponent thrusts a blade toward my face, I must not retreat. Swiftly sidestepping, I advance my left foot and use my left hand to parry their right wrist from outside to inside. Then, I strike upward with my right hand to their face.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nThis method may also employ the middle and index fingers to pierce their nostrils or strike their eyes—adapt based on the urgency of the situation.\n\n---\n\n**Fourteenth Stance: Opponent Advances with Right-Step Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent advances with a right-step lifting force, I seize their hand with my left, crouch, and use my right hand to hook their right shin. As I lift, I twist their shin with both hands, then drive forward with my full-body force to strike them.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nWhether hooking with the left hand or targeting either leg, the principle remains the same.\n\n---\n\n**Fifteenth Stance: Opponent Advances with Right-Step Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent advances with a right-step lifting force, I step forward with my right foot, crouch, and use both hands to seal their right foot. I attack their *Tiger-Shin Bone* with *Three-Gate Force*.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nWhen sealing both feet, ensure thorough defense to prevent the opponent from seizing the opportunity to kick my face.\n\nIf the opponent seals my right foot and prepares to attack with *Three-Gate Force*, I strike their right ribs with my right knee as their foot descends.\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nIf overpowered and thrown, I must not use my knee—instead, I kick upward with my right foot.\n\n---\n\n**Sixteenth Stance: Opponent Delivers Right-Step Sweeping Force**\n\nWhen the opponent delivers a right-step sweeping force, I twist their right hand upward with both hands, step forward with my right foot to seal their right foot from outside to inside, and hurl them leftward with my full-body *qi*.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nThis method requires wrenching their right wrist with all force to break their momentum. It may be applied to both inner and outer gates—if used on the inner gate, seal with the left foot from inside to outside.\n\n---\n\n**Seventeenth Stance: Opponent Advances with Right-Step Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent advances with a right-step lifting force, I also step forward with my right foot, using *Blocking Force* to deflect their hand. Following through, I seize their shoulder, then grasp their heel with my left hand and hurl them outward with my full-body force.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nWhen applying this method, step into the opponent’s inner gate. The *Blocking Force* must rise from below and overturn from within the abdomen.\n\nIf thrown by the opponent, my chest must not touch the ground. Instead, I press both hands to the earth, assume the *Earth Dragon’s* side posture, and strike their groin with a flying right hand.\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nThe flying kick employs the *Earth Dragon’s* turning motion—though it lacks profound intent, mastery of the *Earth Dragon* technique is essential.\n\n---\n\n**Eighteenth Stance: Opponent Advances with Right-Step Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent advances with a right-step lifting force, I neither advance nor retreat. Instead, I root my left foot firmly, then kick upward with my right leg, driving my full-body force straight into their chest.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nThis method is effective only for those with skill. The left foot must be rooted to defend, and the right foot must be rooted to strike—otherwise, victory is uncertain.\n\nIf the opponent strikes my ribs with their right foot, I do not retreat. Instead, I root both feet firmly, using my chest and ribs to drive outward and strike their foot.\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nThis method demands even greater skill—students must not imitate it carelessly.\n\n---\n\n**Nineteenth Stance: Opponent Delivers Right-Step Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent delivers a right-step lifting force, I shift my entire body to evade their hand. Following the momentum, I step forward with my right foot and use my right hand’s *Blocking Force* to intercept their waist. Then, I seize their hair with my left hand and forcefully break their neck downward.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nWhen blocking, the motion must descend from above. Step into the opponent’s inner gate to prevent their retreat. For those with skill, a horizontal block to their right hand, pinning it at the waist, is even more effective.\n\n---\n\n**Twentieth Stance: Opponent Advances with Right-Step Lifting Force**\n\nWhen the opponent advances with a right-step lifting force, I crouch and first bind their heel with my left hand, then use my right hand to sweep their knee outward with force.\n\n**Right, Chapter One:**\nWhen sweeping the knee, target the inner side—sweeping the kneecap will fail.\n\nIf the opponent crouches to strike my knee, I also crouch, step forward with my left foot, and kneel to strike their back from above with my full-body force.\n\n**Right, Chapter Two:**\nThis exploits their upper vulnerability—most effective.\n\nIf the opponent attempts to crouch and strike my back, I do not wait for them to complete their stance. Instead, I drive upward with my full-body force, attacking their chest and abdomen with *Second- and Third-Gate Force*.\n\n**Right, Chapter Three:**\nWhenever crouching to enter the lower path, if the opponent targets my upper body, this method may be applied.",

      "translated_text": "**Right, Chapter Five:**\nWhen I advance my right step with *Upward-Striking Force*, if the opponent seals my right hand with their right hand and prepares to lift their right foot to strike my ribs, I must stabilize my entire body’s structure, then turn over my right hand to seize their foot and swiftly lift it.\n\n**Right, Chapter Six:**\nWhen I advance my right step with *Upward-Striking Force* and the opponent seals my right hand with their left hand while raising their right hand to strike me, I likewise seal their right hand with my left hand, withdraw my right hand, and strike again with *Upward-Striking Force*—but this requires mastery of full-body skill to be effective.\n\n**Right, Chapter Seven:**\nThe preceding methods are all used when the two opponents are close. If the distance remains great, I need not wait for the opponent to near me; instead, I mobilize my entire body’s spirit to fly forward, seal their right hand with my left, and strike with my right hand’s *Upward-Striking Force*. If the strike misses, I immediately fly back out, never waiting for the opponent to counter. After retreating, I stabilize my full-body skill; if the opponent pursues, I strike suddenly before their step lands. Should I strike the opponent and they retreat, I again mobilize my entire body’s spirit to press the attack, observing their emptiness or solidity, their movement or stillness—whether from the inner or outer gate, the upper or lower path. I adapt my methods to their structure, never missing the moment nor advancing recklessly. This is the essential tactic in facing an opponent, and only through mastering *Spirit-Mobilizing Skill* can one grasp its subtlety.\n\n---\n\n**Miscellaneous Commentaries on *Neigong Scattered Gates***\n\n**First Saying:**\nMaster Nanxi devoted over twelve years to his practice, compiling countless hand techniques. Yet these *Neigong Scattered Gates* distill his synthesis of various schools’ methods, refined through the *Internal Skill Classic*, discarding the superfluous to retain only those with natural overcoming intent, then established as formal patterns to share with fellow practitioners.\n\n**Second Saying:**\nThe high and low postures, inner and outer reversals, and rules of *Neigong Scattered Gates* are all ancient fixed methods; modern practitioners may not alter them. As for the seamless, naturally fitting combat joints within—these arose from Nanxi’s insights while studying the *Internal Skill Classic*, later refined by his own ingenuity. Those who have not read the *Internal Skill Classic* cannot comprehend them.\n\n**Third Saying:**\nThe orthodox and variant forms of *Neigong Scattered Gates* were all personally written by Master Nanxi. Only the annotations in the orthodox forms were composed by Jingfang, yet even these were based on the *Internal Skill Classic* and Nanxi’s daily discourses before he dared put brush to paper.\n\n**Fourth Saying:**\nThe appended *Divided Verses* in *Neigong Scattered Gates* were transmitted orally by Nanxi’s teacher, while the annotations to the *Eight Verses* were personally written by Nanxi himself.\n\n**Fifth Saying:**\n*Neigong Scattered Gates* comprises the orthodox forms, forty-five variant hands, twenty-four general hands, and eight hands—seventy-seven methods in total, covering upper and lower, left and right, front and back, inner and outer. If one trains these thoroughly, no matter from which direction an opponent attacks, there will always be a method to overcome them. Thus, there is no need to exhaust all possibilities.\n\n**Sixth Saying:**\nAnyone with even slight familiarity with the patterns and syntax of *Neigong Scattered Gates* can gain insight through careful reflection. Yet to grasp its divine subtleties, one must first study the *Internal Skill Classic*.\n\n**Seventh Saying:**\nOnly after awakening through the *Internal Skill Classic* should one study *Scattered Gates*. If one cannot awaken to the *Internal Skill Classic* but receives clear transmission of *Neigong Scattered Gates* from an enlightened teacher, and then dedicates time and effort to refining it, victory can still be achieved—one need not be rigidly bound to awakening through the *Internal Skill Classic*.\n\n**Eighth Saying:**\n*Neigong Scattered Gates* contains peerlessly exquisite hand methods, and its unfathomable wonders lie within the variant forms. Yet without first mastering the orthodox forms, the practitioner cannot glimpse the divine transformations of the variants.\n\n**Ninth Saying:**\nIn learning *Neigong Scattered Gates*, the first priority is to recognize where *force* resides. Where the opponent’s *force* lies is what they rely upon. If I know their reliance and break it, how can they not be defeated?\n\n**Tenth Saying:**\nThe second priority is to recognize where the opponent has no *force*. Where they lack *force* is where they fear attack. If I know their fear and strike there, how can they not be defeated?\n\n**Eleventh Saying:**\nThe third priority is to recognize where the opponent establishes their *gate*. Where they set their *gate* is their trap for me. If I know their trap and avoid it, how can they prevail?\n\n**Twelfth Saying:**\nThe fourth priority is to recognize where the opponent has no *gate*. Where there is no *gate* is where they are helpless. If I know their helplessness and attack there, how can they prevail?\n\n**Thirteenth Saying:**\nOne must first understand the principles of the body’s joints—backward and forward, yielding and resisting, opening and closing, horizontal and vertical—before one can know *force* and *gate*.\n\n**Fourteenth Saying:**\nOnly by thoroughly mastering the principles of the body’s joints—backward and forward, yielding and resisting, opening and closing, horizontal and vertical—can one accurately discern *force* and *gate* without error.\n\n**Fifteenth Saying:**\nWithout understanding the principles of the body’s joints—backward and forward, yielding and resisting—no matter how much苦功 one expends, one is merely learning *Scattered Gates*, not *Neigong Scattered Gates*.\n\n**Sixteenth Saying:**\nWhy does training *Neigong Scattered Gates* with *rooted strength* yield no effect? It must be that one uses *rooted* but not *strength*. If one truly employs *rooted strength*, how could there be no effect?\n\n**Seventeenth Saying:**\nWhy does training *Neigong Scattered Gates* with *firm knees* yield no effect? It must be that one uses *knees* but not *firmness*. If one truly employs *firm knees*, how could there be no effect?\n\n**Eighteenth Saying:**\nWhy, in learning *Neigong Scattered Gates*, does one not understand the use of *inner crotch* and *outer hip* *force*?",

      "translated_text": "**Response:**\nIt must be that one has not read the *Neigong Classic*. If one has read the *Neigong Classic*, there would be none who do not understand the use of *force* in the *outer hip* and *inner crotch*.\n\n**Nineteenth Saying:**\nWhy, in learning *Neigong Scattered Gates*, can one not use the *shoulder*, *back*, *chest*, and *ribs* to control others?\nIt must be that one does not understand *adhering force* and *sweating force*. If one employs *adhering force* and *sweating force*, there would be none who cannot use the *shoulder*, *back*, *chest*, and *ribs* to control others.\n\n**Twentieth Saying:**\nWhy, in learning *Neigong Scattered Gates*, does one not understand the *source of force*, the *reason for adhering knees*, or the *purpose of firming the root and refining*?\nThis must be because one has not deeply embodied the *Neigong Classic*. If one deeply embodies the *Neigong Classic*, how could such flaws exist?\n\n**Twenty-First Saying:**\nIf one does not know the *Neigong Classic* but only learns *Scattered Gates*, can one still achieve victory?\nIn *Neigong Scattered Gates*, there are *skillful stances* and *clever stances*. *Skillful stances* cannot be employed without knowing the *Neigong Classic*. As for *clever stances*, if one merely understands the principles of the body’s joints—backward and forward, yielding and resisting, opening and closing, horizontal and vertical—one can achieve victory without being entirely constrained by *Neigong*.\n\n**Twenty-Second Saying:**\nIf one has gained understanding in *internal force* and is also proficient in *Scattered Gates*, what then?\n*Neigong* combined with *Scattered Gates*—hardness tempers softness, softness tempers hardness. The transformations of *generation* and *overcoming*, *yin* and *yang*, *emptiness* and *fullness*—one appears as a gentle maiden at a glance, yet seizes like a fierce tiger. Its marvel is beyond description.\n\n**Twenty-Third Saying:**\nWhy, when studying *Neigong Scattered Gates*, does one open the scroll and remain bewildered, unable to grasp its marvels?\nIt must be that one has not received instruction from an enlightened master. For any profound text, without guidance from an enlightened master, one will inevitably remain bewildered. Let Jingfang speak a word or two of it, and none will fail to deeply comprehend it in their hearts.\n\n**Twenty-Fourth Saying:**\nWithout instruction from an enlightened master, can one still grasp a thing or two?\nWithout instruction from an enlightened master, if one reads diligently and reflects deeply, practices with a partner, and possesses exceptional intelligence, after prolonged effort, one may suddenly awaken. However, compared to having an enlightened master’s guidance, it requires a hundredfold more effort.\n\n**Twenty-Fifth Saying:**\nIf an intelligent person studies *Neigong Scattered Gates* for a long time, they must awaken—otherwise, what value would this book hold?\n\n**Twenty-Sixth Saying:**\nIn learning *Neigong Scattered Gates*, is there anyone who awakens at first sight?\nThose who claim to awaken at first sight either deceive others or deceive themselves. Jingfang possesses only mediocre talent, yet after five or six years of personal guidance from Nanxizi, what I have gained is but one ten-thousandth of his knowledge. If there were one who awakened at first sight, Jingfang would flatly declare: they either deceive others or deceive themselves.\n\n**Twenty-Seventh Saying:**\nIs learning *Neigong Scattered Gates* truly so difficult?\nTo speak of its subtlety and marvel, it is indeed not easy. But to speak of overcoming an opponent, it is most suitable for people. Try applying it, and you will surely witness extraordinary results—it only requires three months of diligent practice.\n\n**Twenty-Eighth Saying:**\nThe hand techniques in *Neigong Scattered Gates* differ greatly from those of the world.\nWe are all human, all with the same body—what difference could there be? Yet in the subtle distinctions of the body’s joints—backward and forward, yielding and resisting, opening and closing, horizontal and vertical—the outcomes of victory and defeat diverge vastly.\n\n**Twenty-Ninth Saying:**\nIn *Neigong Scattered Gates*, whenever one uses the feet, the entire body must fall to the ground, never lightly standing high to strike with the foot—this is the peculiarity of this school. Yet when facing those in the world who stand high and strike with the foot, practitioners of *Neigong* can cause them to lift their foot without rising. This is a natural marvel, and Jingfang does not understand why.\n\n**Thirtieth Saying:**\nThose who have studied this Dao in the past—whether blindly arrogant or timid and weak, or deeply secretive and stingy, swearing never to teach others—yet Nanxizi alone conducts himself with scholarly elegance, treats others with humility, and to all who sincerely seek instruction, explains its principles without reserve. Jingfang has engraved this in his heart—does the world hear my words and also admire him?\n\n**Eight Secrets of Nanxizi of Shanzuo for Overcoming Opponents in Combat**\n\n**Eight Secrets:**\n*Preparation, Assessment, Enticement, Provocation, Exhaustion, Confusion, Pursuit, Adaptation.*\n\n**Method of Preparation:**\nThe first essential secret in facing an opponent is *preparation*.\nOnly by knowing one’s own preparedness can one respond to an opponent’s attack. Only by observing an opponent’s lack of preparedness can one exploit their flaws. The meaning of *preparation* is vast indeed.\nIn terms of *gongfu*, within advancing lies *retreat force*—this is preparation for the opponent’s pull. Within retreating lies *advance force*—this is preparation for the opponent’s collision. Within vertical force lies *horizontal force*—this is preparation for the opponent’s blocking and sweeping. Within horizontal force lies *vertical force*—this is preparation for the opponent’s gaps.\nIn terms of *Scattered Gates*, when striking the opponent’s upper path, one must first prepare for their strike to one’s lower path. When striking the opponent’s inner gate, one must first prepare for their strike to one’s outer gate. Drawing out and extending, one dares not advance lightly—this is preparation for the opponent’s enticement. One dares not act hastily—this is preparation for the opponent’s provocation. One dares not move repeatedly—this is preparation for the opponent’s exhaustion. The applications of *preparation* are boundless. Truly, it is the essential Dao of self-defense and the secret technique of attacking an opponent.\n\n**Method of Assessment:**\nThe second essential secret in facing an opponent is *assessment*.\nBy assessing the depth of the opponent’s skill, one can control their vital points. By ensuring the opponent cannot assess one’s depth, one avoids being toyed with by them. The meaning of *assessment* is far-reaching indeed.\nAssess the opponent’s distance to determine advance and retreat. Assess the opponent’s emptiness and fullness to apply *Scattered Gates*. Assess the opponent’s strength and weakness to employ hardness and softness. Employ many methods to assess them, and only then engage in combat.",

      "translated_text": "The opponent may be enticed to assess their knowledge, provoked to gauge their composure, wearied to test their strength, or adapted to to discern their adaptability. Such is the method of *assessment*—applicable in all circumstances and indispensable at the outset of an encounter.\n\n**Method of Enticement:**\nThe third essential secret in facing an opponent is *enticement*.\nWhen meeting an opponent of comparable strength, where techniques are evenly matched and both parties are well-versed, each guards their own body.\nIf I do not covet the opponent’s flaws, I must ensure no flaws are exposed to them; if the opponent does not covet my flaws, they will not expose any to me. Thus, with no flaws for the opponent to exploit and no desire in them to strike, no opportunity arises for me to employ my attacking techniques.\nTherefore, true flaws must never exist, but false flaws must never be absent. If neither side exposes flaws nor harbors greed, how can victory or defeat be determined?\nThe method lies in feigning a vulnerable opening for the opponent. If they greedily strike at it, they will inevitably leave themselves unguarded—whereupon I strike unexpectedly.\nThus, to strike the opponent’s inner gate, one must first entice their outer gate; to strike their lower path, one must first entice their upper path. To employ hardness, first display softness; to employ emptiness, first display fullness; to employ fullness, first display emptiness.\nThough these principles are clear and easily understood, without prior training, they may not be readily applied in the moment.\n\n**Method of Provocation:**\nThe fourth essential secret in facing an opponent is *provocation*.\nThis is not provocation through words, but through action.\nEnticement tests the opponent with emptiness, while provocation moves them with substance. If the opponent remains unmoved by enticement, how else can they be engaged?\nOne must feign anger, press close to their body, and test their courage or timidity while observing their movements—only then can one’s attacking techniques be deployed.\nThus, provoke their left, and they cannot but turn left to meet you; provoke their right, and they cannot but turn right to meet you—thereby revealing their true disposition.\nThe subtleties herein must be deeply contemplated; do not cling to the vulgar notion of \"provoking a general.\" These techniques, when used to elicit the opponent’s intent, become strikes; when used to probe their intent, they are called provocation.\nIn sum, the hands act with substance while the intent remains empty.\n\n**Method of Fatigue:**\nThe fifth essential secret in facing an opponent is *fatigue*.\nTo fatigue is to exhaust, to sicken, to induce slackness—then attack.\nWithin a single day, one’s *qi* is sharp at dawn but sluggish by dusk; within a single hour, it is sharp at the outset but sluggish by the end. At the first movement, one’s *qi* is inevitably sharp, and sharpness brings fierce strength. Yet if movement continues unceasingly, *qi* must slacken, and slackness leads to decline—this is the natural course.\nWhen facing a strong opponent who seeks to press the attack, I must gather my entire body’s strength to await them. If they attempt to retreat, I use my spirit to disrupt their rhythm, employing emptiness within fullness, fullness within emptiness, softness concealing hardness, or hardness concealing softness—all to deny them respite. Only when they grow weary from prolonged movement do I strike.\nYet when employing fatigue, one must cherish one’s own spirit and conserve one’s strength, reserving it to attack the opponent. Otherwise, after prolonged exertion, the opponent may be fatigued, but how can one remain sharp alone?\n\n**Method of Confusion:**\nThe sixth essential secret in facing an opponent is *confusion*.\nConfusion is the blinding of the eyes, the bewilderment of the mind. If I am not confused by the opponent, how can they defeat me? If the opponent is not confused by me, how can I outwit them? Between confusion and clarity, victory and defeat are decided.\nThus, when facing a strong opponent, one must employ many means to confuse them: advancing while appearing uncertain to bewilder them, retreating while appearing unpredictable to bewilder them.\nConceal one’s weaknesses and refrain from using them; employ one’s strengths to take the initiative—this is the method of confounding the foolish.\nHide one’s strengths to inflate their arrogance; flaunt one’s weaknesses to lull their vigilance—this is the method of confounding the wise.\nFeign disorder, adopt bizarre postures, display softness when intending to use hardness, or test with hardness when intending to use softness—all serve to confuse.\nOnce this technique is applied, no opponent will escape with eyes unblinded and mind unbewildered. It surpasses the method of fatigue, for fatigue merely attacks their strength, while confusion strikes directly at their mind.\n\n**Method of Pursuit:**\nThe seventh essential secret in facing an opponent is *pursuit*.\nWhen the opponent has been fatigued by my techniques, their strength slackens; when confused by my techniques, their mind grows careless. Reckless and careless, they no longer wish to fight. If not now, when shall their will be subdued?\nThus, the method of pursuit: press close to scatter their gates, or maintain distance to employ spiritual movement.\nIf the opponent retreats with horizontal force, pursue with vertical; if they retreat with vertical force, pursue with horizontal.\nPursue slowly to guard against deception, or swiftly to exploit their emptiness. The methods of pursuit are manifold, yet all deny the opponent freedom of movement.\nTo pursue when opportunity arises and retreat when difficulty looms—this is wisdom.\nMastering these techniques reveals the subtleties of pursuit.\nYet there is also the method of pursuing while striking, attacking the opponent’s unpreparedness; and pursuing without striking, awaiting their flaws—both must be understood.\n\n**Method of Adaptation:**\nThe eighth essential secret in facing an opponent is *adaptation*.\nThe subtleties of adaptation are beyond words.",
      "overlap_context": "ssing the depth of the opponent’s skill, one can control their vital points. By ensuring the opponent cannot assess one’s depth, one avoids being toyed with by them. The meaning of *assessment* is far-reaching indeed.\nAssess the opponent’s distance to determine advance and retreat. Assess the opponent’s emptiness and fullness to apply *Scattered Gates*. Assess the opponent’s strength and weakness to employ hardness and softness. Employ many methods to assess them, and only then engage in combat.",

      "translated_text": "Adapting to things by entrusting them to their nature, achieving success by seizing the moment, and applying techniques according to the opponent—since ancient times, the ceaseless responsiveness of heaven and humanity has arisen from nothing but the subtlety of *adaptation*. As the *Yijing* states: \"Transformation and movement never abide; they circulate without emptiness.\" Even the deployment of formations in the *Sanmen* school of unarmed combat does not stray from this single principle.\n\nFor if one seeks to control the opponent with fixed techniques, the opponent’s variations are infinite while one’s methods are finite; but if one establishes techniques in response to the opponent, then when the opponent has no fixed form, one’s techniques likewise become formless. How profound is the meaning of *adaptation*!\n\nIf the opponent seeks to attack my upper path, I adapt to their upward momentum and counterattack—this is the method of Chapter Two in the Twentieth Scenario. If they attack my lower path, I adapt to their downward momentum and counterattack—this is the method of Chapter Four in the First Scenario. If their assault is fierce, I adapt to its ferocity and devise a counter—this is the method of Chapter Two in the Fifth Scenario. If they throw me to the ground, I adapt to their throw and establish a counter—this is the method of Chapter Four in the Tenth Scenario.\n\nIn sum, when I apply my skill, countless established techniques reside in my mind. The methods of the ancients are consummate, and I cannot transcend their bounds; thus, I must rely on these established forms as my compass. Yet if no fixed technique resides in my mind, I devise methods in response to the opponent’s *qi*, their openings, and their momentum—techniques that cannot be confined to a single form.\n\nAh! Only when one grasps this profound principle may one be deemed worthy of witnessing the inner workings of the *Sanmen* school.",
