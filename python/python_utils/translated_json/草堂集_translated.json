  "full_translation": "**The Thatched Hut Collection**\n*Scripture Title: The Thatched Hut Collection*\nBy Wang Dan’gua of the Jin Dynasty\nOne fascicle\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Taiping* Section\n\n---\n\n**The Thatched Hut Collection**\nBy Master Wang of Five Peaks and White Clouds\n\n**Lyrics: Eleven \"Court Full of Fragrance\"**\n\nComposed on the twenty-second day of the twelfth lunar month, the anniversary of the descent of the Venerable Ancestor Chongyang, the Wondrous-Act Realized Man of Compassionate Transformation, and the ascension of Master Danyang, the Merciful-Wish Realized Man, into the rosy clouds. After the assembly of Daoist companions completed the purification feast, these lyrics were presented as a gift.\n\n---\n\n**Snow clears o’er fields and gardens,**\n**Ice congeals on ponds and pools—**\n**The time has come to delve into the depths of winter.**\nOn this day, Chongyang descended,\nRevealing the true wind of the Dao.\nOnce more, Master Danyang,\nLeaving the dusty world behind,\nSoared to the celestial palace.\nIn the principle of the Mysterious Origin,\nOne ascends, one descends—\nManifesting the utmost divine power.\n\n**Boundless—**\n**The hands of the true master,**\nFrom the capital’s south to Shaanxi’s west,\nFrom Hebei to Shandong.\nFrom children to the aged,\nWho does not revere and honor?\nResponding to things, adapting to circumstances,\nBestowing expedient means,\nThe Three Teachings harmonize as one.\nAll you gentlemen,\nFrom this day forward,\nWhen shall we meet again?\n\n---\n\n**To Wei Dechun**\n\nThe shackles of profit, the fetters of fame,\nThe ropes of affection, the cords of desire—\nWho is not ensnared?\nYet if one can awaken,\nIt is but the fruition of prior causes.\nHow much worse to seek liberation in anguish,\nProbing emotions only to turn them into enmity!\nDo you not know?\nIn the unseen, true sages\nWill guide you to grasp the Celestial Origin.\n\n**Be steadfast,**\n**Be vigilant—**\nRein in the mind-horse,\nCapture the heart-ape.\nEven a slight indulgence\nWill damage the field of mushrooms.\nIn daily life, constantly examine your faults,\nAmong the multitude,\nNever notice the transgressions of others.\nAct thus,\nAnd the original single point\nShall not lack perfection.\n\n---\n\n**To Liu Silang**\n\nA family of cold simplicity,\nA household of quiet leisure—\nWho takes the trouble to seek it out?\nThe primal numinous awareness,\nImprisoned in the burning house.\nClinging to fleeting affections,\nNever realizing the journey ahead has an end.\nAwaken now!\nFollow our kind,\nSever ten thousand entanglements at once.\n\n**Carefree—**\nWhat can compare?\nThe hawk freed from its cage,\nThe fish slipped from the hook.\nTruly, drifting like a lone boat,\nCast off from its moorings.\nEat when hungry, drink when thirsty,\nWhen sated, drum your belly and sing.\nUnfettered,\nWhen merit is complete, depart,\nStriding high to visit Penglai.\n\n---\n\n**To Zhou Xin and Others**\n\nNobility and baseness are ordained by Heaven,\nFlourishing and withering follow one’s lot—\nClearly, they do not lie in forced scheming.\nWhat is gained was originally possessed,\nWhat is lost was never truly there.\nIn vain, one employs cunning and luck,\nExhausting spirit and wit,\nWearing out the body.\nFoolish and deluded souls,\nChasing the path of petty profit—\nWhat do they gain from their greed?\n\n**Moon and crow,**\n**Hastening in flight—**\nWithin the span of a hundred years,\nLight and shadow pass in an instant.\nOnce, rosy cheeks and raven locks\nTurn entirely to frost and snow.\nSoon, impermanence will arrive—\nWhat will you rely on then?\nHow can you compare to me,\nEmpty, idle, and still,\nPreserving the great elixir furnace?\n\n---\n\n**Again**\n\nA single point of numinous clarity,\nTen thousand emotions tugging at the threads—\nWhen has it ever known a moment’s peace?\nThe wheel of rebirth presses urgently,\nTrading bones like mountains.\nThus, the deluded heart remains unenlightened,\nBoasting of cleverness, galloping in cunning.\nIt is no different\nFrom the moth flying into the flame,\nThe ant endlessly circling.\n\n**This time,**\n**Having personally encountered**\nThe descent of the host of immortals into the world,\nExpounding and transforming among humankind,\nThey revealed the Great Teaching of Perfect Truth,\nPointing directly to the Mysterious Pass.\nAbide always in constant purity, constant stillness,\nCease debating the reversal of aging and the return to youth.\nFrom now on,\nDispel doubts, sever delusions,\nAnd your name shall be listed among the ranks of immortals.\n\n---\n\n**Again**\n\nThe four karmic deeds, the three Peng spirits,\nThe seven emotions, the six desires—\nDay and night, they incite and provoke.\nTrapped in their cycles,\nOne cannot escape the black winds and waves.\nExhausting stinginess, greed, jealousy,\nCunning and deceit,\nEndless snares are set.\nAlas!\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nWho has not suffered their scorn?\n\n**Brother Wang—**\n**I have revealed the truth to you—**\nYou must be resolute and decisive,\nBeware of wasting time.\nWield the sword of dispassionate wisdom,\nSharpen it again and again.\nEven if you face the battlefield,\nStrengthen your resolve,\nScatter the hordes of demons.\nUpon your return,\nThe people will be at peace, the nation prosperous,\nAnd all shall sing the song of Great Peace.\n\n---\n\n**On the Three Teachings**\n\nBuddhism expounds emptiness and stillness,\nDaoism discourses on purity and quietude,\nConfucianism perfects the hundred virtues.\nThe three branches stand,\nMutually elucidating good affinities.\nThe Master, Confucius, is renowned as the Ultimate Sage,\nThe Tathāgata realized the Great Awakening as the Golden Immortal.\nOur school’s patriarch,\nLaozi, bears the august title—\nTransmitted from ancient times to the present.\n\n**Profound, profound—**\n**Of one body,**\nWho is high, who is low?\nWho comes after, who comes first?\nTogether, they support the state,\nUniversally transforming humans and heavens.\nLike the vast ocean,\nDiverging into streams,\nFlowing through all rivers.\nYet in the end,\nWherever they wander,\nThey all return to the source.\n\n---\n\n**In Reply to One Asking Why I Left Home and How to Cultivate the Dao**\n\nIdle words scribbled,\nCrude verses composed,\nI roughly set forth my humble insights.\nEnsnared in the dream of the world,\nI idly passed twenty springs.\nSuddenly awakening to the perilous road ahead,\nDragging along affections—\nWho would dare to procrastinate?\nI joined the Mystery Teaching,\nExploring its profound and wondrous secrets,\nFreely delighting in the celestial truth.\n\n**Embracing poverty—**\nWhat a fine livelihood!\nReturning to simplicity, nurturing purity,\nCultivating the spirit.\nFortunate to have the clear wind as companion,\nThe bright moon as neighbor.\nI have claimed a life of leisure and freedom,\nFollowing the sun and moon\nAs they rise in the east and set in the west.\nIn the realm beyond words,\nA hint of the message—\nHow many can truly hear it?\n\n---\n\n**Instructions to the Assembly**\n\nFine sesame oil,\nDouble-sifted white flour,\nRice pounded and washed like ivory.\nMeticulously prepared offerings,\nA feast of rare delicacies arrayed.\nReverently performing the incense ritual, entering stillness,\nBowing repeatedly—\nHow could one shrink from toil?\nWe only hope that\nThe living may obtain blessings,\nThe deceased may ascend and transcend.\n\n**All of you—**\nHeed the exhortation:\nDo not grow lax,\nHold fast to the Dao in unwavering devotion.\nIn clarity of mind and purification of thought,\nDo not violate the celestial precepts.\nEven the slightest breach of the fast or transgression of the precepts,\nWithout shame or remorse—\nNot even a drop of water can atone.\nDeficient in merit and conduct,\nWhen the final reckoning comes,\nHeaven and Earth will not lightly forgive.\n\n---\n\n**Lyrics Composed at the Command of Marshal Wanyan of Pingzhou for a Ritual Feast**\n\n**Harmonious qi flows in warmth,**\nthe sun lingers, the breeze softens—\na radiant day where all things align.\nGardens and groves embroidered in splendor,\npeach and plum in full bloom.\nSwallows chatter, orioles vie in song,\ngolden-green willow fronds droop low.\nA delicate fragrance drifts—\non this day, a celestial presence\nbestows its auspicious grace upon the inner chambers.\n\n**Divine countenance—**\nhow resplendent,\na visage of jade-like serenity,\na bearing faint as a crane’s.\nIn mind, humility and kindness,\nin conduct, the great virtue ever upheld.\nLongevity needs no repeated prayers,\nfor the true origin of nature\nholds its own celestial destiny.\nSever the ties of the mundane,\nawaken from the dream of the mortal world,\nand return to feast at Jade Pool.\n\n**Again—**\nA stalwart talent in service of the realm,\na noble scion of the imperial house,\nentrusted by imperial grace to guard Ping Mountain.\nThe land rests in peace—\nwhat fortune to inspire joy!\nThe people are cherished as one’s own children,\nlaws tempered with mercy,\nthe foolish and stubborn shown compassion.\nNo partiality, no bias—\nthe renown of governance spreads,\nresounding throughout the mortal realm.\n\n**In leisure,**\never accumulating virtue,\ndevoted to the teachings,\nthe heart preserved in tranquility.\nOnce more, honored with a summons,\na sacred altar is raised.\nThrough the ritual feast, the host of celestial sages is thanked,\nas the azure-clad ones\nopen the gates of the unseen.\nFrom this day forth,\nthe lofty immortals will bear witness,\nand your name shall be inscribed\namong the ranks of the transcendent.\n\n*Wang Hai Chao*   *Self-Reflection*\n\nOnce, in years past, I was bound by craving and desire,\nall my life’s deeds and doings—\nnow, in a single dawn, scattered like flying dust.\nKnowing fate, I delight in Heaven’s decree,\nbefore the wind, beneath the moon,\ndwelling in seclusion by mountain and stream.\nSilent as one struck dumb, like a fool,\nheedless of others’ praise or blame.\nAll day long, no other task remains—\nonly to guard and preserve this little self.\n\nSubtle and profound, the dark workings of the mysterious mechanism,\nawakening to clarity, deep and still,\nall merges into one refuge.\nWhen the mood strikes, I sing and chant,\nwhen joy arises, I dance and play,\nfollowing conditions, delighting in my emptiness and stillness.\nNo care for outward appearance,\nfreely indulging in carefree abandon,\nat ease, without striving.\nContent to pass my days in poverty and leisure,\nletting the sun and moon race east and west.\n\n*Jade Brazier: Three Streams of Snow* (Eleven Poems, originally titled *West River Moon*)\n*In Response to Master Qin*\n\nLeaning on my staff, I wander through water and clouds,\nmaking my home wherever I go.\nIn grotto heavens, I recline to nurture cinnabar,\na thatched hut and wattle fence—fit for a painting.\nGathering yellow sprouts and white snow,\nblending jade liquid and golden tea.\nOf such sweet savor, no need for boasting—\nit wins an immortal’s priceless prize.\n\n*Hidden-Head Acrostic* (Four missing characters reconstructed as verse)\n\n□ Greatness is not in firmness,\n□ Now, deluded, clinging to home.\n□ Yet awakening to purple spirit-sand,\n□ Abandoning zither, chess, books, and paintings.\n□ Years of diligent refinement,\n□ Within, nurturing famed tea.\n□ Now, knowing its flavor, why boast?\n□ One day, merit perfected—priceless.\n\n*Breaking the Four Characters*\n*For Wang Houtang of Xianyi Temple*\n\nSeeking the swiftest path to cultivation,\nlet not the horse lag nor the monkey run wild.\nIn every thing, sever all entanglements—\nwhy ask of coiled serpents and tortoises?\nKeep the spirit-terrace ever luminous,\nnaturally, the true breath will flow unbroken.\nThe immortal maiden within—fair of face—\nis none other than your original countenance.\n\n*For An Baozhen and Others*\n\nFish lost in the ford of suffering’s sea,\ndrifting with the waves, chasing the current.\nIdly casting fragrant bait upon the hook,\nin an instant, they turn their heads.\nThis, too, is the weight of past karma—\nall things at once come to rest.\nWhere lies the path ahead?\nBecome a leader among the host of immortals.\n\n*Again*\n\nTo transcend the sea of suffering,\nfirst sever love and forget emotion.\nFrom of old, level the pits and trenches,\nlest you stray into desolate byways.\nSee through the illusions of fleeting splendor,\nlet no doubts or delusions arise.\nWith light and carefree steps, press onward—\neach stride finds Penglai’s sure footing.\n\n*Again*\n\nHaving awakened to the Way of home-leaving and Dao-seeking,\nrely on a will unshakably firm.\nThough myriad conditions stir in the heart,\nall depends on diligent refinement.\nAmong the assembly, harbor no dissent,\nput others’ benefit before your own.\nInner attainment and outer conduct—both perfected—\nyou shall attend the jade pool’s sacred feast.\n\n*For Monk Liu of Puzhou Bodhisattva Hall*\n\nThe Great Dao makes no distinction of noble or base—\neach and every person is already complete.\nLet not the square inch of the heart spawn a thousand cares,\nbut keep every thought returning to purity and stillness.\nHaving grasped this message,\nno need to bow the body or weary the form.\nThe spirit-terrace, brighter than the icy moon,\nillumines the seeds of ignorance.\n\n*Sighing for the Fire-and-Smoke Sons of Home-Leaving*\n\nSome seek truth and yearn for the Dao—\npitiful, deserving of sighs.\nForsaking meat, abstaining from wine, shunning rank odors,\nthey take up the conduct of home-leaving.\nIn solitude, they close their eyes and knit their brows,\nbefore others, they speak of the Dao and discourse on Chan.\nYet the slightest touch sets them ablaze—\nall their former knowledge and insight, undone.\n\n*Subtle Function*\n\nNo need to debate the public cases of ancients—\nonly present my own gate’s style.\nAt the third watch, the third stroke of the fast-breaking bell—\nthis is my family’s subtle function.\nLimpid as empty flowers in form,\nluminous as the moon in water’s reflection.\nTwo phases of this message—one in essence—\nsee how you might grasp and wield it.\n\n*Double Extinction*\n\nWhat words can speak of the ancestral Dao?\nWhat discourse can touch the true lineage?\nTo move the lips and wag the tongue is already amiss—\nit betrays the heart-seal of all immortals.\nThus, it is hard to expound,\nyet I dare not refrain from a brief disclosure:\nIn every thing, the whole body is revealed—\nin these words, I ask you to acknowledge it.\n\n*In Gratitude for a Daoist Friend’s Visit*\n\nClumsy and weary of worldly profit,\nindolent, I love only mountain dwelling.\nLearning that a Daoist friend delights in calling,\nI come to forge a bond of wondrous affinity.\nI only wish to ascend the realm of longevity,\nand further pray to deeply awaken to emptiness.\nLaying down the toils of the dusty world, severing a myriad cares—\nbeyond the heights, where white clouds run deep.\n\n*Golden Brazier: One Stream of Clouds* (Four Poems, originally titled *A Stretch of Clouds on Mount Wu*)\n*For Sun Zhidao and Wang Juyi*\n\nOn purple paths, a traveler burdened by cares,\nin red dust, a household bound by fame and profit.\nAll day long, vainly toiling—\nno way to keep company with mist and clouds.\nIf you awaken to the brevity of this floating life,\nPenglai’s immortal halls lie but a hand’s span away.\nHungry, eat; thirsty, drink; weary, sleep—\nall else is without entanglement.\n\n*Again*\n\nWind stilled, clouds first gathered,\ntide level, waves at peace.\nIdly wielding a light oar, clad in a straw cloak,\nI angle near the riverbank.\nThe azure sky, so clear, like water—\nhow much more when the moon shines bright and the wind is gentle?\nAlas, the fish and turtles refuse the hook—\nI stand alone on the desolate isle of reeds.\n\n*Parable of the Skull*\n\nDay after day, lost in flowers and wine,\nmorning after morning, contending for power and wealth.\nSuddenly, life ends, the grave is sealed—\non the outskirts, bleached bones lie exposed.\nThough beaten with sticks and pounded with rods,\nthey are not as sharp and foolish as before.\nI urge you to early awakening to this cause—\nbeyond the world, engage in true cultivation.\n\n*Parable of the Puppet*\n\nFaces painted in outlandish guise,\nbodies swiftly assembled and joined.\nBowing and scraping, twisting and turning—so many postures,\nyet all are but manipulated by others.\nOf their own accord, they shake their heads and mimic shadows,\ndaily racing across the stage.\nOne day, the strings break, the pulling ceases—\nonly then do they awaken to the falsity of such causes.\n\n*Little Layered Mountain*\n*Expressing My Feelings*\n\nWith sudden awakening, I leap from the cage of worldly toil.\nHow many affairs fill the breast—all turn to emptiness.\nBeyond the dust, I feign foolish simplicity in carefree ease.\nTruly unshackled, truly free—\nthis is indeed the finest family tradition.\n\nOpening the door to face the pine-clad peaks,\nred dust cannot reach me here, deep in the white clouds.\nThe heart of Dao does not share the heart of profit.\nI open my embrace,\nreclining high to nurture indolent leisure.\n\n*Six Golden Robust Cries of Jade Splendor*\n*(Originally titled \"Reduced-Word Magnolia Flower\")*\n\n*Exhorting Dao Companions*\nThe wondrous Dao of Perfect Truth:\nfirst lay low the self and others.\nThe wondrous Dao perfects truth—\ndecisively gather essence, qi, and spirit.\nWhen merit is complete and conduct fulfilled,\ncast off the skin-sack without a care.\nWhen conduct is fulfilled and merit complete,\npay homage before Master Danyang.\n\n*Again*\nNonaction, purity, and stillness—\ntiger coils and dragon twines, returning to great samādhi.\nPurity, stillness, and nonaction:\nmother and child harmonize, moving in and out together.\nCarefree and at ease,\ncoming and going without entanglement.\nAt ease and carefree,\nI leave it all to mountains and forests, or the marketplace.\n\n*Again*\nNot-human and human—\nseeing through it all, it is but a trifling matter.\nHuman and not-human—\nlike spring wind blowing past the ear.\nTrue merit, true conduct:\nrestrain the mind-horse and heart-ape within.\nTrue conduct, true merit:\nthroughout the twelve hours, refine and refine the surging qi.\n\n*For Dao Companion of Luo Family Manor*\nLuo Manor, a realm unto itself,\nwinding waters encircle the mountains in mutual embrace.\nLand lovely, people worthy,\nrevering the Dao, honoring truth, sowing seeds of good karma.\nYou invited me here,\nofferings made with tireless devotion.\nNo way to repay such virtue—\nonly wishing each household flourishing longevity.\n\n*For Master Hu*\nDescendant of the Zi and Lin clans,\nyour discourse lofty, surpassing the crowd in distinction.\nFrom birth, your bones were numinous, your flesh refined—\nhalf your countenance already noble, emerging into the world with marvel.\nYou honor the Three Teachings,\nrevering the Buddha, the Sage, and walking the great Dao.\nSilently nurturing the immortal embryo,\nsoon the white lotus will bloom amidst the flames.\n\n*For Lady Wan Yan Ming Hui of Pengwei County*\nThe air is crisp and severe,\nall things root deeply and secure their stems.\nThe *ming* leaves fully unfurl—\nthe immortal maiden moves her true self down from the jeweled terrace.\nPine’s bearing, crane’s form,\ncasting off burdens, purifying the heart, surpassing the crowd in distinction.\nTo celebrate her long life:\nmay fortune and longevity together attain the measure of Mustard Seed City.\n\n*Eight \"Treading Clouds\" Songs*\n*(Originally titled \"Treading the Grass\")*\n\n*Self-Diversion*\nRen and Gui just ascended,\nBing and Ding already descended.\n\nWatering and nurturing, the yellow sprout grows tall.\nThe numinous youth plucks it and ascends to the Jasper Palace,\nwhere reed pipes and flutes welcome him with resonant song.\nTigers roar with auspicious winds,\ndragons churn the snowy waves.\nThe turning of creation rests with the true master.\nRefining cinnabar, the moonlight clears—\nwhere the *Treading Clouds* dance, divine radiance gleams.\n\n---\n\nPure and tranquil is the household’s way,\na livelihood of non-action.\nWithin lies a hidden truth.\nIn stillness and clarity, the profound mechanism is grasped;\nin the boundless and indistinct, the subtle principle is known.\nAtop the Seven Treasures Mountain,\nwithin the Five Luminous Palaces,\nfreely savoring the nectar’s taste.\nSober yet drunk, drunk yet sober—\nsober again, then drunk once more.\n\n---\n\nWorldly affairs swirl in chaos,\nworldly passions stir in turmoil.\nIn spare moments, such thoughts are truly laughable.\nWhen will the rise and fall of gain and loss cease?\nWhen will the cycles of rise and ruin end?\nThough present today,\nwho can guarantee tomorrow?\nListen well and recognize the Dao of non-action.\nWhen cultivation and merit are both complete,\nlaughing, you’ll point to Penglai Isle amid the clouds.\n\n*For Scholar Li of Anshan*\nEnough of \"alas\" and \"how\"—\nof \"this\" and \"that.\"\nAwakened, it’s best to cast them all aside.\n\nInstructing the young and ignorant wastes the spirit,\nlest habit and delay turn your hair to snow.\nThe years fly like arrows—\nhow can you bear to let them pass in vain?\nI earnestly reveal the secrets of immortal cultivation:\nif you’re willing to climb the cinnabar cassia branch,\nyou’ll share with me the moon of eternal life.\n\n*For Liang the Scholar and his nephew of Luojia Village, who piously seek land to build an abbey*\nBefore Longling Peak,\nbehind Luojia Village—\nmountains and rivers here are truly bright and fair.\nIf now you build a Daoist abbey,\nin years to come it shall draw immortals to its halls.\nI write these new verses\nas modest praise and blessing.\nFortune and good omens have always followed virtue.\nUncle and nephew briefly forge a bond of action,\nwhile their descendants shall enjoy boundless longevity.\n\n*For the Assembly of Changchun Township at Chongdao Abbey*\nThe township bears the name \"Eternal Spring,\"\nthe abbey is called \"Venerating the Dao.\"\nIts hidden mysteries are hard for men to fathom.\nLet not the radiance of Eternal Spring wither,\nand with sincere hearts, turn the wheel of venerating the Dao.\nShut out the clamor,\ndelve within to seek the wondrous.\nEver hold fast to patience, humility, and modesty.\nA wind of wisdom scatters the clouds atop the ridge,\nand the moon of true nature shines with brilliant splendor.\n\n*For Yang Deyuan*\nHis Daoist name is \"Peaceful Leisure,\"\nhis dharma name, \"Virtue Distant.\"\nDharma name and Daoist name open the gate of expedience.\nIn peaceful leisure, let the nature roam free;\nawakening to virtue’s distance, return to truth and goodness.\nOutwardly appearing simple,\ninwardly mastering cultivation.\nPressing on with effort, advancing the fire as in battle.\nThe golden crow flies toward Qujiang Pool,\nthe jade toad leaps from the Hall of Luminous Clarity.\n\nFor Yang Deyuan’s Request\n\nThe Dao is fundamentally wordless,\nyet you press for words, demand explanations.\nPoetry and song are but forced interpretations—\nin its original state, the body abides in true constancy,\nresponding to circumstances without the slightest hindrance.\nMoving freely in and out,\ncoming and going at ease,\nbefore your eyes shines a radiant clarity.\nIf you dare accept this in an instant,\nwithout shifting a single step, you transcend the Three Realms.\n\n*Gazing Toward Penglai* (Three Poems, originally titled *Gazing at the River South*)\n\n*For Elder Brother Zhongwu*\n\nOften I laugh,\nfor delusion and awakening differ entirely.\nYour livelihood is wealth and honor,\nmy life, quiet and carefree.\nHigh pillowed, I recline amidst mist and clouds.\n\nThe joy of longevity,\nhow pure and fine its delight!\nAt leisure, I keep company with the thousand-year crane,\nidly watching flowers that never fade through the four seasons.\nWhere might one find the home of immortals?\n\n*For Magistrate Wang at Taolin Pass*\n\nScion of a noble lineage,\nyour pure reputation has long been heard.\nBy chance we met beyond the green peaks,\nlingering together by Jade Spring’s edge,\nour discourse in perfect accord with the true teaching.\n\nSince parting,\nwe have met again without cause.\nI fear your spiritual insight may be obscured by desire,\nso I dare not refuse my clumsy, wild verses—\nmy intent entrusted to this brush and paper.\n\n*For Scholar Zhang the Fourth*\n\nO descendant of the Qing River,\nhear the root of this matter:\nin the past, you never found the raft to cross the shore,\nand now you’ve entered the downhill years,\nstill bound by worldly attachments.\n\nThe realm of splendor,\nillusory and unsteady.\nDo not dream within a dream again,\nnor seek the mysterious within the mysterious.\nMend the heavens within the cave.\n\n*Three Poems on Freeing the Mind* (Originally titled *Nian Nu Jiao*)\n\n*On Bamboo, Respectfully Following the Rhyme of Master Changchun*\n\nA single stalk of bamboo,\npossessing a natural standard,\ntowering and solitary.\nBeyond the balustrade, before the window, its emerald shadows stretch—\nits elegance far from the vulgar.\nWithin, its heart is hollow;\nwithout, its integrity lofty,\nsurpassing all common trees.\nIn quiet recitation of wind and moon,\nits resonance is like jade struck upon ice.\n\nHow lovable its pure essence and noble bearing,\ndrawing cranes to perch and phoenixes to nest,\nthrough all seasons delighting the eye.\nIts lush leaves, layer upon layer, gleam sleek and smooth,\nits supple branches swaying, dense with green.\nIts roots twist like dragons and serpents,\nits qi infuses shoots and bamboo,\ntheir flavor surpassing meat and grain.\nThis gentleman of refinement,\nshares with me boundless good fortune.\n\n*Double Ninth*\n\nMist and light, clear and verdant,\nstirred by the west wind—\nonce more the Double Ninth arrives in leisure.\nRed leaves and yellow blossoms alternate,\na scene truly worthy of painting.\nIn years past on this day,\nsilken robes and strings, feasts and golden cups flew.\nNow, in retrospect,\nall has become an empty dream.\n\nHaving entered the mysterious gate by good fortune,\nworldly attachments of every kind\nleave not the slightest trace.\nA thatched hut, a brushwood fence, set one against the other—\npure and serene, ever refined.\nAll day, words forgotten;\nthrough the night, sleepless,\nI willingly endure this carefree life.\nWho shares my aspiration?\nTogether we speak of the wordless truth.\n\n*Lamenting the World*\n\nThe moon and sun hasten,\nsilently urging a man’s temples to silver.\nAll day he toils, yet remains unenlightened,\ndriven by the fires of family cares.\nThe empty fame of a snail’s horn,\nthe paltry profit of a fly’s head—\nwhat good do they bring?\nHearing of health and strength,\nbest seek the living path among the clouds.\n\nSweeping my sleeves, I cast off worldly bonds,\nby water’s edge, upon stone,\nlaughing freely as I compose idle verses.\nA single grain of divine elixir gleams bright,\nsparing me the entanglements of worldly dust.\nUnfettered and at ease,\nI wander where I will,\ngrasping the true message.\nWhen merit is complete, I shall depart,\nto dwell forever on Penglai’s immortal isle.\n\n*Four Poems to the Tune of \"Linjiang Xian\"*\n\n*Admonishing Debates Among Buddhists and Daoists*\n\nChan and Dao originally need no debate,\nyet ancient sages forced them into names.\nNo need for those beyond the world to labor in vain—\neach person has their portion,\neveryone is perfectly complete.\nSimply lay down the ten thousand entanglements,\nand sever ignorance without hesitation.\nIn Jetavana’s garden, roam freely.\nWhere the mud ox roars,\nmidday strikes the third watch.\n\n*For Shi Yu Xian and Others*\n\nBowing my head, I urge those on the same path to heed the teachings,\nlest you waste the passing years.\nEver awaken and reflect, your Dao-heart steadfast.\nEmbrace others’ faults,\ncorrect your own deviations.\nIn your true nature, there is no self or other—\nin stillness, recognize the root source.\nBut deluded by false unions, you grasp at connections,\nforever sinking in the sea of affliction,\nunable to attain the Great Heavenly Net.\n\n*Evening Scene*\n\nAs evening approaches, a gentle coolness stirs at door and window,\nalone I sit on the pine-clad crag, chin in hand.\nFrom on high, my gaze spans the horizon—\na solitary city veiled in mist and trees,\na distant shore where a single sail returns.\nFor ten thousand miles, the azure sky is clear as water,\nclouds idle, unmoving in the slightest.\nBright and luminous, they play in the radiant sunlight.\nA perfect light embraces the dharma realm,\nits splendor shining upon the Jade Pool.\n\n*Playfully Composed Upon Hearing the Cuckoo*\n\nA mind at leisure grows weary of idleness,\ncarefree and unconcerned, I forget all schemes.\nAt dawn, a light rain passes the window.\nEmerald mists enfold the green peaks—\nagain, I hear the cuckoo’s cry.\nEach call rings clear: \"Better to go home!\"\nNow my time to return has come.\nWhen merit is complete, I shall step upon the clouds.\nWhy trouble with clever arguments,\nvainly urging one another on?\n\n*Guest at the Blue Lotus Pond* (Originally titled *Green Jade Case*)\n\n*For Wu Lin Da Derun*\n\nNow that you have awakened to the suffering of worldly toil,\nyour body has already met its fate.\nCast aside vanity, embrace simplicity.\nEver hold fast to gentleness and humility,\nnever give rise to greed or envy—\nlet your words and deeds match.\nIn stillness, do not stir idle thoughts,\nand you will grasp the wondrous mystery of leisure.\nNurture the Three Fields without cease,\nday or night.\nYin recedes, yang grows,\nqi congeals, the elixir forms—\nonly then may you be called a companion of the Perfect Truth.\n\n*Two Poems from \"Immortal of Yellow Crane Cave\"* (Originally titled *Bu Suan Zi*)\n\n*For the Assembly*\n\nI urge those who cultivate immortality:\neach must remain patient and enduring.\nThrough ten thousand hardships and a thousand demons,\nlet your resolve grow stronger—\nnever alter your initial resolve.\nLike the full moon’s light,\nradiant and serene beyond the vast

dwell in seclusion in Clear Spirit Grotto on Kunlun Mountain,\noften practicing sleeplessness. After long sitting,\nI did not notice the snowfall.\nThat night grew slightly warm; half-melted icicles from the cliffs\nseemed to make a sound.\nSuddenly rising, I stepped outside to look—\nthe mountains on all sides had transformed entirely.\nLeaning against a pine, I composed this lyric.\n\nSitting long, my eyes grew heavy with drowsiness,\nunaware the heavens displayed their auspicious signs.\nThe night warmed, and I suddenly heard the dripping of cliff icicles,\ndrop by drop—\nawakening, my dream of wandering immortals could not take form.\n\nI rose, climbing the steps to open the latch,\ngazing afar—all distant peaks had changed.\nOnly the tall pines, of nature distinct,\nstood steadfast.\nAlone, I leaned against the secluded crag, the Dao’s clarity revealed.\n\n**[To a Clan Member]**\nMy ancestral home lies in Lizhou. A certain Immortal Li\ncame from there, saying that among my kin in springtime,\nthey heard I had entered the Dao many years ago.\nThey know not which branch of the Wang family I belong to—\nI was asked to send word.\nThus I composed this lyric to send to them.\n\nA few words on concealment and action:\ncan the cycles of birth and death ever be measured?\n\nUnrelenting, the stubborn heart deludes with love and desire,\never more manifest—\nthrough endless ages, never reaching home.\nFortunate to meet Ancestor Chongyang,\nwho revealed the Quanzhen Way for transcending the world.\nI send word to my clan: awaken,\nponder deeply—\nthis one has never borne the surname Wang.\n\n**[To Cui Miaoxin]**\nA true and luminous master,\nvast as the Hongfan, wondrous in emergence.\nFragrance,

walking—hold fast,\ncontemplate:\nwith every blink and brow’s lift, who is it?\n\n**[Two Lyrics to the Tune \"Qinlouyue\"]**\n\n**On the Pine**\nA traveler of mist and clouds,\ntowering, hidden beside the secluded crag.\nBeside the secluded crag,\nfrost oppresses, snow weighs—\nyet not the slightest hindrance.\nGnarled branches sway beyond the cold clouds,\nits natural form and substance truly lovable.\nTruly lovable—\nverdant, distinct,\na singular bearing.\n\n**On the Bamboo**\nOf steadfast purity,\nsupple branches and tender leaves fit for painting.\nFit for painting—\nthrough all seasons, ever companion\nto the thatched hall’s wind and moon.\nLofty and unyielding, its nature uniquely noble,\nhollow-hearted, forever undecaying.\nForever undecaying—\ngreen shade swaying,\nauspicious tones, pure and exquisite.\n\n**[Five Lyrics to the Tune \"Fenglouwu\"]**\n\n**Mountain Dwelling, Idle Thoughts**\nAll around, green pines and bamboo.\nShaded and bright, the mountain home—\nwhat care for idle honor or disgrace?\nAlone, I chant and pour fine wine,\nits rich flavor intoxicates; drunk, I sleep in my robes.\nAwakening from a clear dream, desire remains unfulfilled.\nAgain I embrace the jade zither,\nplaying the melody of *No-Birth*.\nWho is the knowing companion at my side?\nThe thatched hall’s wind and moon should approve.\n\n**To Fellow Daoists**\nWorldly affairs, tangled—what suffering they bring!\nDeath and birth, coming and going,\nthe wheel of reincarnation never ceases.\nFortunate to have perfected ones open the Dharma hall,\nguiding people onto the path of *No-Birth*.\nTravelers on this path, heed my words:\ndevote yourself sincerely,\ncherish the Dao, forget thoughts and worries.\nThe work of clarity and stillness shines forth—\non the path of *No-Birth*, we shall ever meet.\n\n**Exhorting the Springtime Wanderer**\nTender willows hang golden, blossoms burst open.\nEverywhere in gardens and groves,\nthe sleeve-sweeping fragrance of wind delights.\nEndless before the eyes, idle scenes—\nonly to adorn the splendor of spring.\nYoung riders gallop in lively throngs,\nheedless of prosperity’s\nstealthy change of rosy complexion.\nIn the end, emotion cannot endure—\nearnestly I tell the flower-seekers this.\n\n**Hearing the Oriole in Late Spring**\nThe fleeting light hastens—how swiftly it presses!\nBright sun, gentle wind,\nagain send spring’s light to dusk.\nGradually I hear the flowing oriole’s speech on the branch,\nwarbling as if pouring out its heart.\nYesterday, flowers bloomed red across the trees—\nnow they have scattered,\nwildly chasing flying catkins.\nI urge the wanderers to awaken to life:\ndo not lose the path you came by.\n\n**Three Days Before Qingming, After a Light Rain, Presented to All**\nSever love, forget emotion—be ever vigilant.\nThe hare runs, the crow flies,\nhurrying the passing years.\nAgain Qingming draws near—\nevery household’s smoke and fire must be guarded with care.\nHarmonious qi, misty and dense, is precious fortune.\nFine rain hangs like a curtain,\nnot betraying spring’s promise.\nNature’s work continues thus,\nimmortal blossoms

delight,\nscorning duckweed and tumbleweed.\nLet fate run its course—\nobstruction or smooth passage.\nA life of quiet simplicity,\ntwenty years since I set aside the golden goblet.\nEverywhere, turning the light inward,\ndispelling darkness and confusion—\nthe spirit’s mirror is not bronze.\nSometimes I play\nin the red dust’s realm,\nsometimes I dwell in seclusion\nbeside green crags and pines.\nGrasping the reins of Tan and Ma,\ntheir legacy of style remains.\nDriving the workings of creation,\nnaturally the tiger and dragon mate.\nAscending to the pure heavens,\nhow dare I linger in indolence to vie for first?\n\n**II**\nAbandoning fleeting glory,\nforgetting entangling snares,\nfreer than autumn’s tumbleweed.\nDelighting in Heaven’s mandate,\nall encounters flow smoothly.\nFollowing conditions, a single meal suffices—\nwhat need for a thousand bushels of emolument?\nContent in idleness, guarding simplicity,\nenduring poverty’s clarity—\nwhy care for stubborn bronze?\nAccompanying cloud companions,\ninviting wind and moon,\nfacing the creek’s stones,\nbefore the crag’s pines.\nDiscussing the serene,\nthe family style of transcending the world.\nRefining gold, cooking jade,\nturning the female tiger and dark dragon.\nNow, once more awakened,\nall ties are empty—\nthe mind weary, the will indolent.\n\n**Entering the Dao**\nDeath and life press,\nthe wheel of rebirth urges—\nno respite from toil.\nToward the ford of delusion,\nthe bitter sea, all vie to race.\nMeeting this sagely age,\ntrue immortals descend teachings to deliver the lost.\nSuddenly awakened,\nthe dream of floating life—\nestranged from frivolity and excess.\nHair like tumbleweed,\nface like grime,\nspirit like drunkenness, demeanor like stupidity.\nAbiding in

Lyrics to the Tune \"Chaozhongcuo\"]**\n\n**Abandoning the Common**\n\n**The Official Path**\n\nThe official path flows like water—\neastward, gains and losses never cease.\nWhat matter prince or peasant?\nThe limit of impermanence arrives, none can stay.\n\nFar better to cast off fame’s shackles,\nto spare oneself vain sorrow.\nOne day, when the three cinnabar elixirs align,\nI’ll ride the clouds to seek Penglai’s isles.\n\n*Matching Master Sun Yuanming’s Rhyme*\n\nSuddenly casting off worldly affairs,\nI pass the boundless years in knowing fate.\nMonopolizing the grass-thatched hall’s

as a dweller of the sea-girt isles.\n\n**Three Lyrics to the Tune \"Su Zhongqing\"**\n\n**The Ninth Day**\n\nOn the Double Ninth, joy runs deep—\nascending heights, the finest delight.\nSky vast,

melodies played anew—\nwho is the true kindred spirit?\n\n*Matching an Ancient Rhyme*\n\nWhere auspicious clouds drift lies the immortal’s home,\npillowed high on mist and rosy clouds.\nGuiding and

Luminaries,\nhead crowned with the Three Flowers.\n\n**To Elder Wei**\n\nLong life comes from indulgence at home,\nslanting sunlight meets lingering glow.\nUnnoticed, hair turns hoary white—\nrare to find it raven-black again.\n\nTeeth decay,\neyes veiled by gauze, dimmed in splendor.\nWhat differs this twilight year\nfrom rain striking the mournful paulownia,\nwind shaking the wanton blossoms?\n\n**Three Lyrics to the Tune \"Xingxiangzi\"**\n\n*Self-Portrait*\n\n**Cloud-Water Life**\n\nA cloud-water life—wherever one goes, there is home.\nFar from floating fame, floating profit, floating vanity.\nThe Three Palaces rise and descend, without deviation above or below.\nEssential to bind the numinous embryo,\ngather the numinous essence,\nand assemble the numinous sprout.\n\nPure joys lie deep and distant—what more could be added?\nFreely, joyously, drink the flowing rosy clouds.\nWhen the Great Elixir ripens,\nride the immortal raft homeward.\nThen trail jade pendants,\nsway jade ornaments,\nand wear jade blossoms.\n\n**Remembering the Master’s Teachings**\n\nThe Master, styled White Cloud, named Cinnamon, sobriquet Everlasting—\nfrom youth awakened to leave the dust,\nrefining mercury, smelting silver.\nGrasping the transformations within the flask,\nharmonizing tiger and dragon,\nnurturing the nascent yang.\nManifesting the ever-present visage,\nthe original face,\nthe fundamental body.\n\nClouds and water as neighbors,\nwind and moon as constant kin.\nOnly when the wondrous mystery is penetrated\nis one truly called a Perfected.\nRecalling the Master’s compassionate instruction,\nslightly different from ordinary folk—\nstyled Everlasting,\nnamed Cinnamon,\ncalled White Cloud.\n\n**Addressing the Assembly, Reusing the Previous Rhyme**\n\nWhy

others.\nCertain to weave auspicious light,\nachieve auspicious omens,\nand tread upon auspicious clouds.\n\n**Four Poems to the Tune \"Flowers Filling the Path\"**\n\n**To Daoist Friend Changli Who Came to Visit**\n\nIn early years, I forgot worldly burdens,\ndwelling among clouds and water at heaven’s edge.\nClustered peaks conceal my humble abode,\nnurturing my foolishness.\nDesolate and plain, silently guarding thusness.\nDeep gratitude to the esteemed true friend,\nwho, staff in hand, did not shrink from the distant journey to my mountain retreat.\nAlas, my gate’s wind is cold and desolate,\nmy hospitality crude.\nYour subtle words, repeated admonitions,\nawaken me from trivialities.\nThe perilous road ahead—\nrecognize the wondrous origin.\nIn every single thing,\na measure of numinous light,\ninherently lacking nothing, needing nothing.\n\n**To Little Cui**\n\nWhat is most bitter in the human realm?\nSpeaking of it stirs sorrow for you.\nThe scenes of arising and ceasing before your eyes,\nfleeting as shadows.\nEmpty fame, meager profit—\nfollow your portion, seek little.\nFortunately, in this fine season,\nseizing the moment to steal leisure,\nI seek cloud companions

grotto-heaven’s wind and moon,\ndance the immortal embryo.\nThe alchemical spoon brimming,\na single Great Elixir perfected.\nHolding it, ascend the azure sky’s path,\nstep by step beyond life and death,\nheedless of seas turning to mulberry fields.\n\n**To Daoist Friends of the Two Mountains: Wulin, Da, and Others**\n\nThe southeast’s scenic land,\ngaze afar, mist and haze locked in embrace.\nSea and mountains gather rare beauty,\nyielding outstanding worthies.\nPeople here are auspicious and kind,\ncalming thoughts, silencing clamor.\nEverywhere, companions gather,\nexploring

to leave the household life.\nI replied, ‘My descendants are not yet established,\nmy family’s path not yet complete—\nI fear I lack the karmic conditions to leave home.\nCould I simply cultivate at home instead?’\nThe Perfected One laughed and said:\n‘I have long declared:\nWithout embracing wife or child,\nimmortals are not found at home—\nhow could Lord Pengwu not know this?’\nWith these words, I awoke.\nI know not what to make of it.\"\nThus, I send these verses to him.\n\nI bow to the immortal of Fuchun,\nlistening to the root of the matter.\nGolden willows and jade twists bind tightly—\nonly when your own heart resolves this\ncan you speak of lacking the conditions.\nThe words of sages in dreams\nare no empty transmission.\n\n\"Household affairs await completion in every detail.\nYet I still hope to attain the fruit of the Dao in this body—\ndigging earth to seek heaven.\n\nTo the female disciples Guo Shouyuan and Guo Shanzhi:\nI exhort the two of Fenyang,\nbriefly recounting the course of conduct.\nWith karmic conditions, the body enters the homeland of the Dao.\nWorldly matters, one after another, should be pared away—\nabandon the short to follow the long.\nIn daily practice, burn the incense of the heart,\nturn the light around to reflect inward.\nWhen encountering demons or hardship, dare to bear it.\nFrom beginning to end, without change or wavering,\nresolutely advance toward Penglai’s estate.\n\nTo the female disciple Zhang Shanxing:\nWild words speak true sincerity—\nthe pure assembly should listen.\nUnexpectedly, white hair has grown at the temples.\nAhead, impermanence awaits as an equal—\nwhat is there to welcome?\nOnly through cultivation,\nwith a mind broad and level,\ndo old, familiar states no longer entangle.\nWhat has passed, correct again and again—\nmerit will naturally come to perfection.\n\nTo the disciple Nun Shan:\nFirm in aspiration, she yearns for the path ahead,\nstartled even by honor or disgrace.\nThe profound meaning of the Five Thousand Characters shines clearly.\nThus, the hundred rivers all flow to the sea—\nthe hollow must be filled.\nThe superior person dwells without contention,\nrelying on softness and weakness.\nThough outwardly responding to things, inwardly remains serene.\nWalking the Dao like this, ever unobstructed,\nstep by step, Penglai and Yingzhou.\n\nThree Poems on Awakening from the Southern Branch (Originally titled *Nankezi*)\nWith Chang Xianzhi\n\nIn quiet sitting, the heart is simply at ease;\nin secluded dwelling, the mood is admirable.\"\n\n**Quietly sounding the celestial drum, rinsing cloud buds,**\nBreathing in and out in unbroken flow,\nFollowing one’s lot to preserve the livelihood of life.\nSimply understanding how to rest in the moment’s course—\nWhy fret over the changing splendor of things?\n\nThe jade paths of Three Mountains are surely not far.\nBefore departure, for now abide\nAmid layered emerald and radiant mist.\n\n---\n\n**To Prefect Liu, Master of Joyful Affairs:**\nApes and birds make true reclusive companions;\nSprings and rocks are near neighbors.\nThree rods of crimson sun near the gate—\nRising from sleep at ease,\nFor a time free of cares, briefly drawing close.\n\nThe Dark Valley patterns the thousand sages,\nThe Mud Pill collects the hundred spirits.\nWith such trifling effort, nurture the celestial true.\nFar from harm, preserving life whole—\nIn pure joy, none surpass you.\n\n---\n\n**At Mingzhou, Delayed by Rain—Detaining a Traveling Friend:**\nA carefree wanderer of the white clouds,\nNo single affair entangles this body.\nIdle thoughts drift to rivers and peaks beyond the mountain screen.\nStaff in hand, a youth in tow,\nPassing through the eastern sea to teach and transform.\n\nThe heat’s breath quietly retreats,\nAutumn winds distinctly clear.\nUnceasing light rain, skies yet unopened.\nWith intent to detain you,\nNot letting you set out the door.\n\n---\n\n**Jade Terrace, First of Three Poems**\n**On the Birthday of Master Cui**\n\nThe turning of years and seasons,\nNow at this time, the tenth month’s minor spring.\nThe Old Man Star gleams,\nJade cords hang low,\nThe Silver River arches high.\n\nAt dawn, auspicious qi gathers,\nCelebrating the banished immortal\nWho first alights at the cloud carriage.\nBy good karmic threads,\nGradually unfolding plain elegance,\nAgain unfolding the golden lotus.\n\nSoaring free—\nWorldly passions swept away,\nMind returning to the root-source of purity and stillness.\nCrucible and furnace refine,\nThe River Chariot transports,\nElixir fills the Three Fields.\n\nWhere the cavern chamber shines resplendent,\nTiger and dragon,\nInfant and maiden unite in harmony.\nMarking long years—\nProud of the tortoise’s span, the crane’s reckoning,\nThrough kalpas unending.\n\n---\n\n**The Lantern Festival**\n\nThe seasons hasten their turn,\nOnce more the Lantern Festival heralds spring’s return.\nThe cassia wheel newly full,\nGolden lotuses just unfurled,\nNo need for planting or tending.\n\nSix streets and three markets all aglow,\nWith turtle-shaped lantern mountains\nAnd pavilions mirrored in radiance.\nVying to join the throng,\nClusters of fragrant carriages and jeweled steeds,\nGalloping with abundant talent.\n\nWe few...\n\n**The Passions Forgotten**\n\nPassions forgotten, longings stilled—\nWithin the Crimson Palace’s depths, the immortal embryo is preserved.\nAwareness blooms fragrant,\nWisdom’s light shines resplendent,\nA joy apart, harmonious and rare.\n\nJade nectar and ambrosial draughts overflow,\nForming the elixir’s measure—\nNo less than the finest goblets.\nFreely open the heart,\nAs phoenix and simurgh lead the way,\nFeasting and wandering in Penglai’s isles.\n\n---\n\n**On the Birthday of Minister Wu**\n\nYin at its utmost, yang ascends,\nAs the pitch pipes respond—\nYellow Bell stands in solemn stillness.\nIn years past at this time,\nPale clouds trailed their skirts,\nAuspicious qi, pure and bright.\n\nThe Jade Balance turns in secret,\nRevealing the southern arc—\nA single luminary grows in splendor.\nThe immortal minister descends,\nGradually the wind clears Penglai’s gardens,\nThe moon chills Pengying’s shores.\n\n---\n\n**Majestic.**\n\nHeaven’s talent abundant,\nEarly years brought fame and success.\nFollowing Heaven, aligning with the Dao,\nHe withdrew to nurture his vastness—\nPeers swallowed their voices.\n\nIn his travels, a modest feast,\nFriends gathered, goblets crossed like rosy clouds.\nDrunk, then sober—\nHis icy bearing and jade frame proclaimed\nA lifespan measured in pine and crane.\n\n---\n\n**Spring Comes from Heaven Above (Two Poems)**\n*For Li Zhipu of Shouyang Mountain*\n\nHaving awakened to worldly ties,\nShaking off the mountains of favor and seas of love,\nThe snail’s gain, the fly’s fame—\nJoyfully he brushed his sleeves,\nCutting off cares, forgetting passions.\nFamiliar realms—beware lest they entangle.\nEmbrace a will unwavering from start to end,\nSimply abiding, unquestioning of the path.\nDwelling in non-action,\nEnduring the whistling, the scattering,\nThe still, the clear.\n\nIn leisure, he perfected his cultivation,\nRefining the hundred vessels to flow freely,\nThe four limbs at peace.\nTiger crouched afar, dragon coiled,\nQi congealed, spirit concentrated—\nA single great elixir, perfectly formed.\nSummoning the divine youths to sing and dance,\nThe cloud chamber filled with jade goblets.\nBoundless delight—\nPreserving the root, securing the stem,\nTo gaze long and live forever.\n\n---\n\n**Winter Solstice**\n\nHare flees, crow hastens,\nRacing west to set, east to rise—\nThe four seasons shift in secret.\nThe lesser year arrives,\nIn ten thousand households, a thousand gates,\nLaughter and joy celebrate the auspicious day.\nDarkly the baleful fate recedes,\nAs the southern eaves welcome\nThe sun’s renewed radiance.\nAssessing fortune and misfortune,\nThe silver terrace divines the signs,\nThe historian’s brush records the clouds.\n\nOh, vast are the workings of the Mysterious Origin!\nGradually plum blossoms scatter their fragrance,\nRailings’ bamboo steals the spring.\nThe serene one, at ease,\nA hundred blessings converge,\nSilently nurturing his vastness, preserving the True.\nEmbodying the wondrous Dao of harmonious emptiness,\nNature governs the turning of chaos.\nThe year’s labor complete—\nThe six yin lines exhausted at last,\nPure yang is reestablished.\n\n---\n\n**Remembering Peach Blossom Spring (Four Poems)**\n*On Zhao the Marshal’s Attendant Sharing His Rhymes*\n\nA hundred years of life—truly rare.\nWho can fathom this truth?\nMeeting, we only open our mouths to laugh—\nWhat care for idle sorrows?\n\nThe four seasons’ winds and moons are ever fair.\nLay down the heart’s burdens, and all is done.\nThough the body may not remain young,\nIn the end, aging must come.\n\n---\n\n**Again**\n\nWorldly cares and vulgar thoughts—how many?\nWho can untangle their far-reaching snares?\nJust as we force a smile,\nAgain they turn to sorrow.\n\nSpring flowers and autumn moons, though fine,\nAre all spoiled by the pursuit of fame.\nNo sooner do we see children grow,\nThan our own faces age.\n\n---\n\n**Again**\n\nFew come to Peach Blossom Spring,\nAlone he holds the cavern-heaven at dawn’s clarity.\nRecalling past follies, he laughs—\nWhy invite needless entanglements?\n\nZither and books—his livelihood, perfectly sound.\nA single tune in the mountain hall, and all is settled.\nProtecting the immortal embryo, ever young,\nForever he follows the Yellow and the Old.\n\n---\n\n**Using the Previous Rhyme, with Hidden Characters**\n\n□ comes—all things in the heart grow few.\n□ hidden, heedless of dusk or dawn.\n□ silent, forgetting talk and laughter.\n□ who grieves over limits?\n\n□ leisure brings ever greater harmony.\nAfter □, before □, the work is done.\n□ mending the fading countenance, restoring youth.\n□ the immortal knows no age.\n\n---\n\n**Water Melody (Two Poems)**\n\nThe Honorable Zhao’s Copy of a Japanese Poem, Requesting a Response in Its Rhyme\n\nYears fly like arrows,\nGreed and desire never cease.\nIn the western city, spring’s hues first meet,\nThen in a blink, autumn startles the eye.\nSun and moon alternate in dawn and dusk,\nSilently wearing one old, willingly swept by the flowing waves.\nHow could it compare to hearing of robust health,\nSleeving the dust to seek reclusion?\n\nLet the heart roam free,\nFollow the body’s ease—\nBetter than enfeoffment as a marquis.\nWandering carefree wherever one goes, unbound,\nUtterly like a lone boat.\nAs long as one’s own nature accords with the Dao,\nLet others laugh or err—\nForget shame, forget sorrow.\nHigh-reclining beyond the misty peaks,\nChanting and whistling before the stone tower.\n\nOn the Honorable Zhao’s Birthday\n\nAutumn’s hues enter the treetops,\nThe deep azure sky stretches long.\nBy the fence, clusters of yellow chrysanthemums,\nOne after another, exhale their pure fragrance.\nSince ancient times, the assembled immortals convene,\nTogether discussing the rise and fall of the human world,\nAiding the times by responding to the mandate.\nSuddenly, the whale-rider is summoned,\nFeathered wings descending from the vault of heaven.\n\nEndowed with celestial harmony,\nCherishing trust and kindness,\nDevoted and loyal.\nWillingly shouldering the weight of office to govern,\nVast magnanimity ever expanding.\nMoreover, from the outset, his reputation and worth\nHave generously bestowed blessings high and low,\nThe people’s hopes sheltered in his lingering light.\nOffering this ode, wishing the lord longevity,\nForever to secure Anyang.\n\nFour Poems of \"Longing for Immortals\" (Originally titled \"Longing for Each Other\")\n\nTo Liu Zhichang of Flat Mountain and Liu Zhiben of Divine Mountain\n\nFlat Mountain Liu,\nDivine Mountain Liu,\nTransforming the common stream into a Daoist current.\nWorldly sentiments—swear not to linger.\n\nAwakened steed,\nRestrained steed,\nBrilliant divine pearl attains freedom,\nRadiance ever lingering.\n\nTo Li Zhichi of Yanzhou\n\nLi Zhichi,\nEngaged in cultivation,\nEarly tend the heart-field’s thorns and brambles,\nLest the hand act too late.\n\nDraw from the Flowery Pool,\nIrrigate the Flowery Pool.\nThe inferior horse and frantic ape do not gallop—\nWith merit complete, bow before the jade steps.\n\nTo Liu Zhizhen of Pingzhou\n\nAdmiring perfection,\nDwelling in perfection,\nEvery movement and conduct strives for true integrity,\nRelying solely on a steadfast will.\n\nUnite with celestial truth,\nHarmonize with celestial truth.\nGuard the inner truth through the twelve hours,\nIn every instance, reveal the original truth.\n\nTo Song Zhihong of Pingzhou\n\nEscape the cage,\nLeave the cage,\nUnchanging, unshifting, embracing beginning and end.\nStraightaway, manifest your vast resolve.\n\nAccumulate true merit,\nPile true merit.\nTruly selfless, merging with the Great Void,\nIn the crucible, the elixir naturally glows red.\n\n**Cloud-Stepping Shoes** (Originally called \"Soft-Turning Shoes\")\n*Presented to the Daoist nuns of Xuan Zhen Abbey, including Sister Shan, who offered these shoes*\n\nFortunate to meet the flourishing of the Teaching’s breeze,\nHarmonious qi fills my heart.\nThe pure and true assembly—all are talents of immortality.\nWith humble reverence, kindness, and obedience,\nThey earnestly offer **Cloud-Stepping Shoes**.\n\nSkillful hands carve and shape with art,\nPearls and gems adorn the sides.\nEach step ascends the altar’s platform.\nAwaiting the day when true conduct and merit are complete,\nThey will transcend the dusty world,\nAnd ascend to Penglai.\n\n---\n\n**Washing the Creek Sands**\n*On the Birthday of Daoist Nun Liu*\n\nIn mid-summer, the four-petaled lotus first blooms,\nA fairy maiden descends in a cloud-borne chariot,\nAuspicious light and propitious qi intertwine.\n\nThe nature of the Dao is free from worldly dust,\nHer spirit unshackled by mundane cares.\nNaturally, her longevity rivals Magu’s.\n\n---\n\n**Intoxicated Peach Spring**\n*On the Birthday of Zhao Gongshan*\n\nThree days prior was the *Ruibin* solar term,\nHer jade carriage parted from the purple palace.\nAuspicious mist and blessed haze swirl in abundance,\nTogether celebrating the birth of this jade-like immortal.\n\nTalented and wise, her nature pure and sincere,\nShe ever aspires to dwell near the Dao and virtue.\nThe fleeting scenes of the human world are not worth recounting—\nWithin her gourd-sky, spring abides anew.\n\n---\n\n**Telling of Innermost Feelings**\n*Ascending Yellow Cliff on the Double Ninth*\n\nThe Double Ninth arrives once more,\nThe scenery stark and desolate.\nFrom on high, I give free rein to my emotions, gazing afar,\nMy eyes traversing the ends of the sky.\n\nAutumn days are short, the frontier sky low,\nThe wild geese fly south.\nPoems inscribed on red leaves,\nWine poured over yellow chrysanthemums—\nWithout drunkenness, there is no return.\n\n---\n\n**Magnolia Flower Curtain (Three Poems)**\n*Mid-Autumn*\n\nMid-Autumn arrives once more,\nThe sun sinks, the night grows cool.\nFacing misty screens and cloudy veils,\nWith good friends and kindred spirits,\nHow boundless our carefree delight!\n\nSuddenly, the jade wheel turns,\nTraversing the vast, boundless ocean, leaping the celestial net.\nIt shatters ten thousand acres of glass,\nIlluminating the Three Realms and Ten Directions.\n\nIt is fitting\nTo share fire dates and jade pears,\nOpening a pure feast surpassing raised cups.\nWe indulge our refined aspirations and secluded hearts,\nOur distant thoughts and untroubled traces—\nAll cares forgotten.\n\nI recall the Teaching’s wind first stirring,\nMoved by Chongyang’s veiled words hinting at the return of yang.\nThe fragrance of osmanthus spreads to the nineteenth branch,\nAllowing me to first savor its supreme flavor.\n\n---\n\n*In the Rhyme of Master Changchun*\n\nI remember then, my spirit sharp and free,\nMy passion for the Dao profound, worldly ties sparse.\nI loved ancient caves and deep streams,\nWhere verdant pines and emerald cypresses\nDisplayed ten thousand scenes.\n\nWith a bamboo hat and gourd bowl, I passed the days,\nFinding joy in poverty’s leisure—\nIts savor surpassing that of fine wine.\nThrough ages of drunken slumber,\nI suddenly awoke, like one who gathers firewood.\n\n---\n\nThe **Jade Chart**,\nThe **Mysterious Registers**—subtle and profound,\nI diligently bore them, never failing.\nCelebrating the radiance of the numinous,\nMy heart’s blossoms shone resplendent,\nNever withering or decaying.\n\nWielding the mighty sword of wisdom,\nI vanquished the Three Corpses and Six Bandits,\nEradicating the mad throng.\nForever preserving the Embryonic Immortal’s comings and goings,\nI traverse the Purple Palace and Clear Capital.\n\n---\n\nAgain,\n\nAlas! The bitter sea surges on,\nAs the deluded masses recklessly drift.\nBound by finite forms,\nBy boundless love and desire,\nThey remain imprisoned.\n\nThey devise ten thousand schemes in vain,\nFor in a hundred years,\nThe fleeting scene does not endure.\nGreedily chasing fame and profit,\nWho expects rivers to flow far and mountains to stand tall?\n\n---\n\nLike flowing water,\nYears and months hasten us along.\nIt is time to awaken and seek liberation.\nBefore the Peak of Grand Unity,\nBeneath the Twin Trees,\nHasten to gather your heart.\n\nEver knowing this was wrong,\nYet repeatedly letting go—\nThen cease!\nWith hands unbound, move freely without hindrance,\nLike a boat untethered.\n\n---\n\n**Immortal’s Grotto Song (Five Poems)**\n*Expressing My Heart*\n\nThe Daoist gate delights in stillness, purity, and emptiness,\nFree from the disturbances of glory and pride.\nAt my window at noon, I peruse\nThe *Dao De Jing* and *Nanhua Jing*,\nBeyond these, I idly pluck a tune on my zither.\n\nAutumn’s light has not yet faded,\nSilken trees and layered mountains encircle me.\nAt ease, I take my staff and wander as I please.\nFacing the boundless whale-like sea,\nMy eyes meet lapis lazuli—\nSky and water merge as one.\nWhy seek to exhaust the profound and subtle?\n\nAwaiting the day when merit is complete and I transform into a flying immortal,\nI will traverse mist, waves, and clouds,\nStraight to the Isles of Peng.\n\n---\n\n*Instructing Disciples*\n\nIn daily cultivation,\nLet me once more outline the essentials.\nOriginally, we abandoned home to attend to our nature and life.\nWith sincere hearts and bitter resolve,\nWe tempered sharpness and crushed strength,\nForgetting favor and disgrace,\nNaturally attaining spirit’s peace and qi’s stability.\n\nAt every turn, on every boundary,\nDo not let the monkey and horse play.\nAt the slightest deviation, correct it.\nIn leisure, refine\nA single grain of golden elixir,\nWhich, when complete,\nWill radiate ten thousand rays of rosy light.\n\nWith the Green Dragon and White Tiger as guardians,\nAcross the Three Realms and Ten Directions,\nAll will come to celebrate.\n\n---\n\n*Double Ninth*\n\nThe wind rises, the dew chills,\nAnnouncing the Double Ninth once more.\nAfter rain, the mountains appear doubly bright and fair.\nCrimson leaves clothe the cliffs,\nYellow blossoms line the paths,\nPiled like brocade—\nTheir delicate fragrance lingers as before.\n\nI gaze intently for a long while,\nMy thoughts entering the realm of nothingness.\nTurning my head, I listen to the long stream by the creek.\nReflecting that life is like a dream,\nWorldly affairs boundless,\nHow futile to drown in them—\nBetter to sweep my sleeves and depart.\n\nSeated on a boulder, my knees at ease,\nI forget all schemes,\nWatching the drifting clouds at the sky’s edge\nReturn to the mountain’s embrace.\n\n---\n\nAgain,\n\nThe pure sky is limpid,\nAutumn nears its end.\nMy aspirations for purity and emptiness rest in the mountains and valleys.\nI watch the wild geese in flight,\nForming ranks in the clouds,\nThen breaking, trailing southward in their honking passage.\n\nWith my true companions, I forget emotions,\nDiscussing the profoundest mysteries—\nFar better than the worldly striving for fame and glory.\nAwaiting the joy of dancing sleeves,\nOr sleeping in my clothes,\nI wholly let go—\nWhat care if the red sun sinks in the west?\n\nIn an instant,\nI dream of wandering as an immortal.\nAwakening, I stroll once more\nThrough the depths of embroidered screens.\n\n---\n\n*After Completing the Ritual at the Immortal’s Abbey in the Tiger Division Settlement, at the Request of the Assembly*\n\nA realm of immortal wandering,\nWhere mountains and plains are fair above and below.\nBacked by high ridges, facing long streams,\nI see peaks arrayed like a thousand blades,\nThe land embracing the Three Yangs,\nAuspicious qi gathering—\nHere, the people are honest and kind.\n\nYellow-haired children and white-haired elders\nHave long revered the Dao and honored truth.\nTogether, they initiated their earnest prayers,\nOffering for the withered and decayed.\n\nWith caps and robes, they transcribed the petitions,\nInvoking the lofty perfected saints,\nWho bestowed abundant grace,\nProclaiming amnesty and pardon.\n\nReleasing those on the dark paths,\nEnding the bitterness of the suffering,\nEnsuring that every household\nShares in blessings and protection.\n\n**\"Lament of Wang Zhaojun\" – Presented to the Daoist Sisters Xiao Jing Shan and Others**\n\nI urge all who cultivate the immortal truth:\nDaily life depends entirely on sincere practice.\nSun and moon race swift as shuttles—\nDo not let time slip idly by.\n\nWhen encountering scenes, let not the heart be stirred;\nIn sitting, dwelling, moving, abide in stillness.\nThis alone is the work of mastery,\nAligning with emptiness and nonbeing.\n\n*End of the Grass Hall Collection*",

      "translated_text": "**The Thatched Hut Collection**\n*Scripture Title: The Thatched Hut Collection*\nBy Wang Dan’gua of the Jin Dynasty\nOne fascicle\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Taiping* Section\n\n---\n\n**The Thatched Hut Collection**\nBy Master Wang of Five Peaks and White Clouds\n\n**Lyrics: Eleven \"Court Full of Fragrance\"**\n\nComposed on the twenty-second day of the twelfth lunar month, the anniversary of the descent of the Venerable Ancestor Chongyang, the Wondrous-Act Realized Man of Compassionate Transformation, and the ascension of Master Danyang, the Merciful-Wish Realized Man, into the rosy clouds. After the assembly of Daoist companions completed the purification feast, these lyrics were presented as a gift.\n\n---\n\n**Snow clears o’er fields and gardens,**\n**Ice congeals on ponds and pools—**\n**The time has come to delve into the depths of winter.**\nOn this day, Chongyang descended,\nRevealing the true wind of the Dao.\nOnce more, Master Danyang,\nLeaving the dusty world behind,\nSoared to the celestial palace.\nIn the principle of the Mysterious Origin,\nOne ascends, one descends—\nManifesting the utmost divine power.\n\n**Boundless—**\n**The hands of the true master,**\nFrom the capital’s south to Shaanxi’s west,\nFrom Hebei to Shandong.\nFrom children to the aged,\nWho does not revere and honor?\nResponding to things, adapting to circumstances,\nBestowing expedient means,\nThe Three Teachings harmonize as one.\nAll you gentlemen,\nFrom this day forward,\nWhen shall we meet again?\n\n---\n\n**To Wei Dechun**\n\nThe shackles of profit, the fetters of fame,\nThe ropes of affection, the cords of desire—\nWho is not ensnared?\nYet if one can awaken,\nIt is but the fruition of prior causes.\nHow much worse to seek liberation in anguish,\nProbing emotions only to turn them into enmity!\nDo you not know?\nIn the unseen, true sages\nWill guide you to grasp the Celestial Origin.\n\n**Be steadfast,**\n**Be vigilant—**\nRein in the mind-horse,\nCapture the heart-ape.\nEven a slight indulgence\nWill damage the field of mushrooms.\nIn daily life, constantly examine your faults,\nAmong the multitude,\nNever notice the transgressions of others.\nAct thus,\nAnd the original single point\nShall not lack perfection.\n\n---\n\n**To Liu Silang**\n\nA family of cold simplicity,\nA household of quiet leisure—\nWho takes the trouble to seek it out?\nThe primal numinous awareness,\nImprisoned in the burning house.\nClinging to fleeting affections,\nNever realizing the journey ahead has an end.\nAwaken now!\nFollow our kind,\nSever ten thousand entanglements at once.\n\n**Carefree—**\nWhat can compare?\nThe hawk freed from its cage,\nThe fish slipped from the hook.\nTruly, drifting like a lone boat,\nCast off from its moorings.\nEat when hungry, drink when thirsty,\nWhen sated, drum your belly and sing.\nUnfettered,\nWhen merit is complete, depart,\nStriding high to visit Penglai.\n\n---\n\n**To Zhou Xin and Others**\n\nNobility and baseness are ordained by Heaven,\nFlourishing and withering follow one’s lot—\nClearly, they do not lie in forced scheming.\nWhat is gained was originally possessed,\nWhat is lost was never truly there.\nIn vain, one employs cunning and luck,\nExhausting spirit and wit,\nWearing out the body.\nFoolish and deluded souls,\nChasing the path of petty profit—\nWhat do they gain from their greed?\n\n**Moon and crow,**\n**Hastening in flight—**\nWithin the span of a hundred years,\nLight and shadow pass in an instant.\nOnce, rosy cheeks and raven locks\nTurn entirely to frost and snow.\nSoon, impermanence will arrive—\nWhat will you rely on then?\nHow can you compare to me,\nEmpty, idle, and still,\nPreserving the great elixir furnace?\n\n---\n\n**Again**\n\nA single point of numinous clarity,\nTen thousand emotions tugging at the threads—\nWhen has it ever known a moment’s peace?\nThe wheel of rebirth presses urgently,\nTrading bones like mountains.\nThus, the deluded heart remains unenlightened,\nBoasting of cleverness, galloping in cunning.\nIt is no different\nFrom the moth flying into the flame,\nThe ant endlessly circling.\n\n**This time,**\n**Having personally encountered**\nThe descent of the host of immortals into the world,\nExpounding and transforming among humankind,\nThey revealed the Great Teaching of Perfect Truth,\nPointing directly to

truth.\n\n**Embracing poverty—**\nWhat a fine livelihood!\nReturning to simplicity, nurturing purity,\nCultivating the spirit.\nFortunate to have the clear wind as companion,\nThe bright moon as

original state, the body abides in true constancy,\nresponding to circumstances without the slightest hindrance.\nMoving freely in and out,\ncoming and going at ease,\nbefore your eyes shines a radiant clarity.\nIf you dare accept this in an instant,\nwithout shifting a single step, you transcend the Three Realms.\n\n*Gazing Toward Penglai* (Three Poems, originally titled *Gazing at the River South*)\n\n*For Elder Brother Zhongwu*\n\nOften I laugh,\nfor delusion and awakening differ entirely.\nYour livelihood is wealth and honor,\nmy life, quiet and carefree.\nHigh pillowed, I recline amidst mist and clouds.\n\nThe joy of longevity,\nhow pure and fine its delight!\nAt leisure, I keep company with the thousand-year crane,\nidly watching flowers that never fade through the four seasons.\nWhere might one find the home of immortals?\n\n*For Magistrate Wang at Taolin Pass*\n\nScion of a noble lineage,\nyour pure reputation has long been heard.\nBy chance we met beyond the green peaks,\nlingering together by Jade Spring’s edge,\nour discourse in perfect accord with the true teaching.\n\nSince parting,\nwe have met again without cause.\nI fear your spiritual insight may be obscured by desire,\nso I dare not refuse my clumsy, wild verses—\nmy intent entrusted to this brush and paper.\n\n*For Scholar Zhang the Fourth*\n\nO descendant of the Qing River,\nhear the root of this matter:\nin the past, you never found the raft to cross the shore,\nand now you’ve entered the downhill years,\nstill bound by worldly attachments.\n\nThe realm of splendor,\nillusory and unsteady.\nDo not dream within a dream again,\nnor seek the mysterious within the mysterious.\nMend the heavens within the cave.\n\n*Three Poems on Freeing the Mind* (Originally titled *Nian Nu Jiao*)\n\n*On Bamboo, Respectfully Following the Rhyme of Master Changchun*\n\nA single stalk of bamboo,\npossessing a natural standard,\ntowering and solitary.\nBeyond the balustrade, before the window, its emerald shadows stretch—\nits elegance far from the vulgar.\nWithin, its heart is hollow;\nwithout, its integrity lofty,\nsurpassing all common trees.\nIn quiet recitation of wind and moon,\nits resonance is like jade struck upon ice.\n\nHow lovable its pure essence and noble bearing,\ndrawing cranes to perch and phoenixes to nest,\nthrough all seasons delighting the eye.\nIts lush leaves, layer upon layer, gleam sleek and smooth,\nits supple branches swaying, dense with green.\nIts roots twist like dragons and serpents,\nits qi infuses shoots and bamboo,\ntheir flavor surpassing meat and grain.\nThis gentleman of refinement,\nshares with me boundless good fortune.\n\n*Double Ninth*\n\nMist and light, clear and verdant,\nstirred by the west wind—\nonce more the Double Ninth arrives in leisure.\nRed leaves and yellow blossoms alternate,\na scene truly worthy of painting.\nIn years past on this day,\nsilken robes and strings, feasts and golden cups flew.\nNow, in retrospect,\nall has become an empty dream.\n\nHaving entered the mysterious gate by good fortune,\nworldly attachments of every kind\nleave not the slightest trace.\nA thatched hut, a brushwood fence, set one against the other—\npure and serene, ever refined.\nAll day, words forgotten;\nthrough the night, sleepless,\nI willingly endure this carefree life.\nWho shares my aspiration?\nTogether we speak of the wordless truth.\n\n*Lamenting the World*\n\nThe moon and sun hasten,\nsilently urging a man’s temples to silver.\nAll day he toils, yet remains unenlightened,\ndriven by the fires of family cares.\nThe empty fame of a snail’s horn,\nthe paltry profit of a fly’s head—\nwhat good do they bring?\nHearing of health and strength,\nbest seek the living path among the clouds.\n\nSweeping my sleeves, I cast off worldly bonds,\nby water’s edge, upon stone,\nlaughing freely as I compose idle verses.\nA single grain of divine elixir gleams bright,\nsparing me the entanglements of worldly dust.\nUnfettered and at ease,\nI wander where I will,\ngrasping the true message.\nWhen merit is complete, I shall depart,\nto dwell forever on Penglai’s immortal isle.\n\n*Four Poems to the Tune of \"Linjiang Xian\"*\n\n*Admonishing Debates Among Buddhists and Daoists*\n\nChan and Dao originally need no debate,\nyet ancient sages forced them into names.\nNo need for those beyond the world to labor in vain—\neach person has their portion,\neveryone is perfectly complete.\nSimply lay down the ten thousand entanglements,\nand sever ignorance without hesitation.\nIn Jetavana’s garden, roam freely.\nWhere the mud ox roars,\nmidday strikes the third watch.\n\n*For Shi Yu Xian and Others*\n\nBowing my head, I urge those on the same path to heed the teachings,\nlest you waste the passing years.\nEver awaken and reflect, your Dao-heart steadfast.\nEmbrace others’ faults,\ncorrect your own deviations.\nIn your true nature, there is no self or other—\nin stillness, recognize the root source.\nBut deluded by false unions, you grasp at connections,\nforever sinking in the sea of affliction,\nunable to attain the Great Heavenly Net.\n\n*Evening Scene*\n\nAs evening approaches, a gentle coolness stirs at door and window,\nalone I sit on the pine-clad crag, chin in hand.\nFrom on high, my gaze spans the horizon—\na solitary city veiled in mist and trees,\na distant shore where a single sail returns.\nFor ten thousand miles, the azure sky is clear as water,\nclouds idle, unmoving in the slightest.\nBright and luminous, they play in the radiant sunlight.\nA perfect light embraces the dharma realm,\nits splendor shining upon the Jade Pool.\n\n*Playfully Composed Upon Hearing the Cuckoo*\n\nA mind at leisure grows weary of idleness,\ncarefree and unconcerned, I forget all schemes.\nAt dawn, a light rain passes the window.\nEmerald mists enfold the green peaks—\nagain, I hear the cuckoo’s cry.\nEach call rings clear: \"Better to go home!\"\nNow my time to return has come.\nWhen merit is complete, I shall step upon the clouds.\nWhy trouble with clever arguments,\nvainly urging one another on?\n\n*Guest at the Blue Lotus Pond* (Originally titled *Green Jade Case*)\n\n*For Wu Lin Da Derun*\n\nNow that you have awakened to the suffering of worldly toil,\nyour body has already met its fate.\nCast aside vanity, embrace simplicity.\nEver hold fast to gentleness and humility,\nnever give rise to greed or envy—\nlet your words and deeds match.\nIn stillness, do not stir idle thoughts,\nand you will grasp the wondrous mystery of leisure.\nNurture the Three Fields without cease,\nday or night.\nYin recedes, yang grows,\nqi congeals, the elixir forms—\nonly then may you be called a companion of the Perfect Truth.\n\n*Two Poems from \"Immortal of Yellow Crane Cave\"* (Originally titled *Bu Suan Zi*)\n\n*For the Assembly*\n\nI urge those who cultivate immortality:\neach must remain patient and enduring.\nThrough ten thousand hardships and a thousand demons,\nlet your resolve grow stronger—\nnever alter your initial resolve.\nLike the full moon’s light,\nradiant and serene beyond the vast sky,\nturning without partiality to fill the great thousand worlds,\ntrust that the floating clouds will disperse.\n\n*For Cheng the Third*\n\nA man is like a candle in the wind—\nwho would turn their heart to look back?\nWorldly ties bind tightly,\nhow could one not feel the suffering?\nFortunately, there is the path of immortal cultivation,\nto be pursued in leisure and ease.\nWherever you go, roam freely—\nwhen merit is complete,
