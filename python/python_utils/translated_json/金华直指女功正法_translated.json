  "full_translation": "**\"The Authentic Dao of Female Alchemy (Nǚgōng Zhízhǐ)**\n*Composed by Qīngxìa Língyáng, the Daoist Immortal*\n*Edited by Chén Lìngníng*\n\n**Preface**\nThis work was originally titled *The Golden Peak Direct-Pointing Authentic Dao of Female Alchemy (Jīnhuá Zhízhǐ Nǚgōng Zhéngfǎ)*, attributed to Qīngxìa Língyáng. It was intended to circulate in the world as one of the dedicated texts for female cultivation. Indeed, there exist in the world both ordained and Dao-seeking women who, upon obtaining this work, may verify its methods of pure refinement.\n\nHowever, because the text has endured for the longest time, it has been extensively corrupted by those who blindly cultivate without insight—many passages, though comprising over a thousand two hundred characters, are merely disjointed compilations, filled with decayed phrases and excessive rhetoric. Thus, they are omitted. Additionally, four sections—on **Daoist teachings (道教)**, **Confucian teachings (儒教)**, **Buddhist teachings (释教)**, and **heretical teachings (邪教)**—are unrelated to the cultivation of **Female Alchemy (女丹)**, and their discussions of the broad principles and histories of the Three Teachings (三教) are often incomplete. The section on heretical teachings is particularly unrefined and vulgar, so all such passages have been deleted. From the first section through the sixth, the text expounds on the **Dao of Female Alchemy (女丹)**, though these methods are forced and artificial, not in accordance with the natural **Way (道)**. Yet, since their origins are ancient, scholars should still be aware of them.\n\nThe seventh section is too brief, while the eighth and ninth sections discuss the **Yang Spirit (阳神)**, interspersed with many terms from external teachings, differing markedly from the specialized vocabulary of the **Immortal Arts (仙家)**. These have been corrected based on the **Yáng Yīyǔ’s (杨一羽) Chéngfēng (成丰) Eighth Year engraving**, so as to avoid the confusion of mingling inferior pearls with fish eyes.\n\nThe tenth section is unimportant. The eleventh section is merely the author’s idealistic musings, not worth serious consideration. The two appendices are included only for supplementary reference. The original also featured sixteen **seven-character absolute verses (七言绝句)**, titled *The Swift Essentials of the Authentic Dao of Female Alchemy (女功正法捷诀)*, whose applications align with the preceding sections—only reiterating what has already been said. Thus, they are omitted.\n\nReaders must understand: the **Immortal Arts (神仙之学)** rest on four fundamental principles.\nFirst, **practice reality, not emptiness (务实不务虚)**.\nSecond, **discuss methods, not abstract theories (论事不论理)**.\nThird, **value the counterintuitive, not the conventional (贵逆不贵顺)**.\nFourth, **prioritize essential techniques, not mere textual study (重诀不重文)**.\n\nAll who carefully examine the **Alchemical Classics (丹经)** and **Daoist scriptures (道籍)** should adhere to these principles to avoid confusion. In this text, what is spoken of is **method (事)**, not **theory (理)**;\nwhat is practiced is **counterintuitive (逆)**, not **conventional (顺)**.\n\nThus, what is passed down is **method (诀)**, not **text (文)**—all aligning with the second, third, and fourth principles.\n\nYet, the original was later distorted by reckless speculation, its **mystic syllables (嘛呢哆罗)** muddled in meaning, rendering the entire **Female Alchemy practice (女修工法)** neither horse nor deer—clearly at odds with the **Daoist Immortal tradition (仙道宗旨)** and clashing with the first principle of **practice reality, not emptiness (务实)**. Hence, all evident interpolations have been excised, preserving the **true (真)** and discarding the **false and perverse (伪邪)**. Let the wise of this world share my sentiment.\n\n**Republic of China, 24th year (632nd year of the Yellow Emperor era), June**\n*Recognized by Chen Jianning in Shanghai*\n\n**General Overview:**\nAt age **eight for men (男儿二八)**, their **essence (精)** is fully mature—excessive **essence (精盈)** leads to **emission (泄)**.\nAt age **seven for women (女子二七)**, their **menstruation (经行)** depletes their **blood (血)**—when the cycle completes (**经满**), it **overflows (溢)**.\nIf one seeks **non-dissipation (无泄)** and **non-overflow (无溢)**, they must grasp **wind (风)** and **fire (火)**:\n**Fire (火)** is the **original spirit (元神)**;\n**Wind (风)** is the **true breath (真息)**.\nSpirit and breath interdependently arise through **observation (观)**.\nThe method enters via the **mysterious aperture of the eyes (目中玄窍)**, directing **qi (气)** into the **breathing orifice (气穴)**.\n**Qi (炁)** enfolds the spirit, which condenses through **intent (意摄)**.\nThe **natural wind and fire (天然风火)** merge without ceasing—\n**consuming essence (易精)** and **refining qi (易气)**,\n**refining qi nourishes the spirit (易气益神)**,\n**spirit completes the transformation (神圆形化)**—\na **second body (身外有身)** emerges.\n\nThe **method states**:\n*\"Only when spirit and breath constantly attend each other,*\n*does the body’s form dissolve into jade nectar.*\n*By long gazing at the **Eternal Fountain (长生窟)**,*\n*the **yang spirit (阳神)** is refined, manifesting at the **crown (顶门)**.*\n*Know that all things born must die,*\n*yet the **original spirit (元神)** dies and is reborn.*\n*If one can dwell the spirit within the **qi (气)**,*\n*the **nourishment of the infant (婴儿赡养)** will succeed.*\n*By mastering this, who fears **Internal Alchemy (内丹)** will not be attained?\"*\n\nThe **method** relies on the **Conception, Governing, and Penetrating Vessels (冲任督脉)**,\nits **circulation (运)** occurs at **External, Middle, and Internal Passes (外中内关)**.\nYet, **Female Alchemy (女修)** differs slightly—\nbeginning at **Upper Pass (上关)**, the **breast meridian (乳溪)**,\nthen at **Middle Pass (中关)**, the **navel interior (脐内)**,\nfinally at **Lower Pass (下关)**, the **womb (子宫)**.\nThe **Middle and Lower Passes (中下)** are then unified as one **orifice (穴)**.\n\nFor men, **refining essence (炼精)** is called **Great Yang Refining Qi (太阳炼气)**;\nfor women, **refining blood (炼血)** is called **Great Yin Refining Form (太阴炼形)**.\n\nThe **secrets of wind and fire (火风之秘)** must be timed like **martial and civil virtues (候宜文武)**—\n**martial (武)** at the center,\n**civil (文)** at the beginning and end.\nThe **microcosmic orbit (周天)** unfolds without deviation from **observation (观)**.\nWithin a **single day (一日)**, the **twelve hours (十二时)**,\nwherever the **intent (意)** reaches,\n**refinement can occur (皆可为也)**.\n\nThose who grasp **pre-heaven qi (先天之气)** and **post-heaven qi (后天之气)**\nwill appear **as if drunk (似醉)** daily.\n\nOrdinary women, steeped in **worldly habits (世俗)**, indulge in **greasy meats and raw flesh (荤腥)**,\neasily generating **lustful thoughts (欲念)**.\nSeeing others marry, they **blame themselves in secret (中怀自怨)**,\n**spring sensitivity (春感)** and **autumn injury (秋伤)** breed **timidity illness (怯病)**.\nExcessive **cold foods (生冷)** worsen **menstrual stagnation (经滞)**,\nwhile **seduction (诱惑)** leads to **ruin of body and reputation (身名俱败)**,\nand **eternal regret (报恨终天)**.\nThus, one must **heed this warning (鉴此)**,\n**avoid karmic entanglements (莫造孽缘)**.\n**Endure (忍)** brings **tranquility (自安)**,\n**repent (悔)** brings **joy (自乐)**.\n**Intent (意)** should seem **to fill the cup (似捧盈)**,\nyet the **heart (心)** remains **still as water (止水)**.\n**Timing (时效)** aligns with **the Golden Man (金人)***—\n**silence the lips, conceal the tongue (缄口藏舌)**,\n**movement and stillness follow the clouds (动静云为)**,\n**preserve chastity and integrity (保贞全节)**,\n**shatter the emotional barrier (打破情关)**,\n**escape the sea of desire (跳出欲海)**—\n**the body’s **pre-heaven essence (天癸)** is the **source of life (养命之源)**.\n**Seek the method urgently (急求功法)**,\n**refine and transform it into truth (炼化成真)**.\n**Accumulate merit in the world (功积人间)**,\n**return the spirit to the heavens (神归天上)**.\n**You, practitioners (汝等修士)**, must **strive diligently (各自勉旃)**.\n\n---\n**First Section: Recognizing the Foundation and Purifying the Heart**\nTo **recognize the foundation (识基)**, first **purify the heart (洁心)**—\n**not a speck of dust (一尘)** may cling,\n**all phenomena (万象)** must not confuse.\n**Heart empty (心空)**, **desire cleansed (欲净)**,\n**naturally still (自然定静)**—\nlike a **mirror’s clarity (如镜之明)**,\nlike **water’s depth (如水之澄)**.\nOnce the heart is purified (**心既洁矣**),\nthen **seek to recognize the foundation (即求识基)**.\n\nWomen, by **nature (原)**, possess the **Kun body (坤体)**—\n**yin back (阴背)**, **yang front (阳腹)**,\n**breasts (乳房)** as **external apertures (外窍)**,\n**breast meridian (乳溪)** as **internal orifices (内穴)**.\nThe **sixth layer of the breast (第六重楼)**, at **six and a half divisions (六分半处)**,\nfaces the **external orifice of the tenth layer (十重楼外阙)**.\nSit **straddling the crane (跨鹤)**,\n**legs crossed at the knees (腿膝交迭)**,\n**seal the Lower Pass (紧闭下关, 泉扉)**,\n**retain the **original qi (固元气)**,\n**stir the Upper Pass (运动上关)**—\n**the breast meridian (乳溪)** must **not leak downward (下免泄漏)**.\nThe **Middle Pass (中关)**, within the **navel (脐内)**, is **one inch and three divisions (一寸三分)**.\n\nTo **avoid the five leaks (无五漏)**,\n**guard the three passes (须守三关)**:\n**Ears listen inwardly (耳常内听)**,\n**Eyes gaze inwardly (目常内视)**,\n**Mouth closed, no speech (口闭不言)**,\n**Qi directed into the breast meridian (气纳乳溪)**,\n**Spirit condensed in the **Golden Room (金室)***,\n**Nature still in the **Ocean of Awareness (觉海)***,\n**Intent focused on the **Cinnabar Palace (丹宫)***.\n\n**Unification (归一)** lies only in **observation (惟观)**—\n**Gold Mother (金母)** observes the **heart (观心)**,\n**Laozi (老子)** observes the **orifice (观窍)**.\nAt **twenty-six hours (二六时中)***,\nobserve **before its manifestation (未发)**—\n**seven emotions (七情)** absent,\n**five aggregates (五蕴)** originally **void (空)**,\nthe **heart dwells in freedom (心常自在)**,\n**lively and unrestrained (活泼泼地)**—\nlike **my teacher, Master Lü (吕师)**,\nwhose **Daoist source (道源)** is **Jade Purity (玉清)**.\n**Condense the spirit (凝神)** at the **breathing orifice (气穴)**,\n**direct the intent downward (注下)** to the **Cinnabar Field (丹田)**,\n**intent led from the eyes (意由目中)**,\n**drawn into the breathing orifice (引入气穴)**.\n**Pre-heaven qi (先天气)** arrives,\n**post-heaven qi (后天气)** enters—\n**keep it ever-present (刻刻存之)**.\n\nFor women, the **breast meridian (乳溪)** is the **Upper Cinnabar Orifice (上丹穴)**;\nbehind the **navel (脐后)**, before the **kidneys (肾前)**, is the **Middle Pass (中关)**;\nthe **vulva (牝户)** is the **Lower Pass (下关)**;\nthe **womb (子宫)** is the **Great Cauldron (大鼎)***—\nall connected via the **eyes’ intent (目中引入)**,\nfrom **breast meridian (乳溪)** to **navel interior (脐内)** and **womb (子宫)**—\na **single vein (一脉)** unites them.\nThe **pre-heaven seed (先天种子)** is the **source of life (命之本源)**.\n\nFor men, **original essence (元精)** is the **greatest yang qi (至阳之气)**;\nfor women, **true blood (真血)** is the **greatest yin essence (至阴之精)**—\n**the body’s treasure (生身之宝)**, **root of all transformations (万化之根)**.\nMen store it at the **Gate of Life (命门)**;\nwomen store it at the **vulva (牝户)**—\nwithin the **womb (子宫)**.\nWhen **desire stirs (欲动)**, it is hard to retain;\nwhen **the heart is still (心静)**, it can be preserved—\nyet **wind and fire (风火)** must be **refined and stored (炼化常存)**.\n\n---\n**Second Section: Cultivating the Menstrual Cycle and Initiating Practice**\nAt age **seven for women (女子二七)**, **menstruation (经行)** depletes their **blood (血)**—\nthough the **monthly renewal (月月信水再生)** occurs,\neach month **still consumes and injures (耗伤)**.\nThose with **aspiration (有志)** to cultivate the **menstrual cycle (修经)**,\nmust **refine and transform (炼之化之)** it—\n**when aging ceases (年老已绝)**, first **make it arise (先使之来)**,\n**avoid cold raw foods (莫食生冷)** to **prevent blood stagnation (方免血淤)**.\n*(Chen Jianning notes: Such customs are tradition, yet need not be rigidly adhered to.)*\n\nFor **menstrual blood (经水)** is the **root of life (命之根基)**.\nThe **method of cultivation (起炼之法)**,\nthough appearing **as if deliberate (意似有为)**,\neasily **augments blood and qi (易益血气)**,\n**preventing further injury (不复再伤)**.\n**Having (有)** is the **beginning of non-having (无之始)**,\n**non-having (无)** is the **end of having (有之终)**.\n**Focus intent (着力)** where **having (有)** exists—\n**post-heaven qi flows (后天气通)**;\n**direct intent (用意)** where **non-having (无)** is—\n**pre-heaven qi is full (先天气盈)**.\n**Eyes follow intent (目随意至)**,\n**spirit and breath interdependently arise (神息相依)**—\n**refining blood augments qi (易血益气)**,\n**refining qi nourishes the spirit (炼气养神)**.\nBegin at the **Middle Pass (中关)**,\n**intent seeming to exert force (意似着力)**,\n**straight upward (往上直提)** thirty-six times,\n**reaching the Upper Pass (提到上关)**.\nAt the **breasts (乳房)**, rotate **left and right (左右)** thirty-six times each.\nIf **Heaven’s Valley (天谷)** is not **hot (不热)**, **qi has not ascended (气未上升)**;\nif **Earth’s Spring (地泉)** is not **hot (不热)**, **qi has not descended (气未下降)**.\n**Intent leads, eyes focus (意领目注)** on the **Upper and Middle Passes (上中二关)**—\n**hands crossed below the navel (两手交叉脐下)**, above the **spring (泉)***—\n**intent seeming to exert force (意似着力)**,\n**straight upward (往上直提)** thirty-six times,\n**reaching the breast meridian (提到乳溪)**,\nthen **into the interior of the breast’s aperture (乳房外窍之内)**—\nrotate **left and right (左右)** thirty-six times each.\n\n**Third Section: The Skillful Method of Severing the Dragon**\n\nThe **Secret Method of Severing the Dragon**, though skillful and deliberate, is practiced at the **Gate Hours (子午)**. Sit as if **straddling a crane (坐如跨鹤)**—\n**knock the teeth seventy-two times (口齿七二)**, striking the **Lung Shu (肺俞)** acupoint,\n**employing the Postnatal (后天)** intent,\n**breathing naturally through the nose (鼻息自然)**,\n**thirty-six times (三十六次)**—\nuntil **all meridians of the body flow (周身脉通)**.\n\n*(As noted by Master Yánníng: These words are too brief, and one may struggle to understand. I now add explanation: \"Knocking the teeth seventy-two times (叩齿七二)\" means knocking the teeth seventy-two times. \"Thirty-six times (三十六次)\" refers to nasal breaths thirty-six times—each inhalation and exhalation counts as one breath. Within thirty-six breaths, if counting inhalation and exhalation separately, there are thirty-six inhalations and thirty-six exhalations, totaling seventy-two times, matching the knocking of the teeth. This is because each inhalation corresponds to one knock, and each exhalation corresponds to another knock. Thus, thirty-six nasal breaths result in seventy-two knocks.)*\n\nPress the **heel (脚跟)** firmly against the **Spring Gate (泉扉)**,\ncross the **hands below the navel (两手交叉脐下)**,\n**intent seeming to exert force (意似着力)**,\n**straight upward (往上直提)** thirty-six times,\nraising to the **Upper Pass (上关)**,\n**intent and eyes rotating (意用目旋)** thirty-six times each,\nthen to the **Middle Pass (中关)**, again **intent and eyes rotating (意用目旋)** thirty-six times each.\nExtend the **hands toward Heaven (手向天托)**—\n**slowly (缓)** thirty-six times,\n**tightly (紧)** thirty-six times.\nThe **tail vertebra (尾闾)** suddenly moves;\ncross the **hands at the waist (两手叉腰)**,\n**clench the teeth tightly (紧咬牙关)**,\n**straighten both shoulders (两肩直耸)**,\n**compress the spine between the two Passes (夹脊双关)**,\n**stirring the Lung Shu (肺俞)**.\n**Intent lifts the head backward (意将头背往上直耸)**,\nreaching the **Jade Pillow (玉枕)**,\n**communicating with the Mud Pellet (泥丸)**.\nThen tightly **enclose the lower lip over the upper lip (下唇紧包上唇)**,\n**intent sending the true elixir (真炁)** upward to the **Mud Pellet (泥丸)**,\ndescending near the **nasal aperture (鼻窍)**.\n\n**Tongue rests on the Heavenly Bridge (舌搭天桥)**,\n**Sweet Dew (甘露)** flows naturally;\n**nose breathes inward (用鼻一缩)**,\n**saliva follows intent (津随意咽)**,\nsending it below the **navel (脐下)**,\n**hands placed on the Vulnerable (牝上)**—\n**intent seeming to exert force (意似着力)**,\nuntil it reaches the **womb (子宫)**, thirty-six times.\n**Sweet Dew enters the Cauldron (甘露入鼎)**,\n**hot qi swirls around (热气盘旋)**,\n**heel pressed firmly (脚跟紧抵)**,\n**body and mind both settled (身心俱定)**,\n**the womb is tranquil (子宫安静)**.\n\n**Lady Wei Yuan** says:\n*\"The treasure returns to the Northern Sea (宝归北海),*\n*tranquility is assured (安静妥妥).\"*\n\n**Fourth Section: Refining the Breasts to Restore Youth**\n\nThe **breasts (乳房)** connect above to the **heart and lungs (心肺)**,\nbelow to the **Sea of Qi (气海)**.\nIf one wishes to refine the **breasts (乳)** to the form of a **maiden (童女)**,\nthe **skill lies within the Severing the Dragon Method (工在断龙法内)**,\nadding the **sending of Sweet Dew (加送甘露)**,\nuntil it reaches the **Vermilion Palace (绛宫)**.\n**Intent focuses on the breasts (意注两乳)**,\nrotate **left and right (左右)** thirty-six times each.\n**Close the lip gate (唇门上下)**,\n**clench the teeth (牙齿咬住)**,\n**shut the nasal passages (鼻孔关闭)**,\nemploying **internal breathing (内呼吸)**.\n\nWithin the **breasts (乳房内)**,\nuse the **palms of both hands (两手心)**,\nrubbing **left and right (左右)** seventy-two times each—\n**first slow then rapid (先缓后急)**,\n**first light then heavy (先轻后重)**.\nA hundred days of practice completes the **formation (功全)**,\nachieving the **shape of a hickory nut (成核桃形)**.\nIn ancient times, **Fengxian Nun**’s **Breast Refining Precept (炼乳诀)** stated:\n*\"Left for the Sun, right for the Moon—one yin, one yang (左日右月一阴阳),*\n*nasal breaths moving internally called **Circulating the Pole (运罡)**.*\n*To make yin and yang return to the Sun and Moon (欲得阴阳归日月),*\n*one must refine the **true fire (真火)** with both palms (必须真火炼双掌).\"*\n*(Note: \"双掌\" in other texts refers to \"双房.\")*\n\n*(As noted by Master Yánníng: Though the three methods from the second to the fourth sections are explained clearly, beginners must proceed cautiously after reading this text. They should not act rashly or recklessly. It is best to consult multiple texts, grasp the principles thoroughly, and achieve **fusion and mastery (融会贯通)** before attempting practice. They must be extremely careful, stopping immediately if any obstruction arises, otherwise they risk falling ill. Relying solely on this text is insufficient. I vow to publish and disseminate **over ten ancient female elixir (女丹)** texts, either with annotations, corrections, or supplements, so that they may become the most complete collection of **female elixir precepts (女丹诀)** in history, to be issued sequentially. The difficulty that women have faced in the past was the lack of texts to study. Now that issue is resolved. You must read widely, study diligently, and seek out those who have already practiced these methods to discuss with them. Only then might you find the **entryway (门径)**.)*\n\n**Fifth Section: Settling the Cauldron and Congealing the Embryo**\n\nFor **men (男)**, the **Lower Cauldron (下田)**, **Middle Cauldron (中田)**, and **Upper Cauldron (上田)** serve as the **Cauldron (鼎)**;\nfor **women (女)**, the **womb (子宫)**, **inner navel (脐内)**, and **Breast Meridian (乳溪)** are the **Cauldron (鼎)**.\nThe **womb (子宫)** is **one inch and three fen (一寸三分)** from the **Lower Cauldron (下丹田)**,\n**two inches and eight fen (二寸八分)** from the **navel (脐)**.\nIt is also located below the **Upper Pass (上关)** and the **Breast Meridian (乳溪)**,\nabove the **Breast Meridian (乳溪)** and within the **navel (脐内)**,\nand below is the **womb (子宫)** itself.\nThe **positions (部位)** are arranged from **outer to inner (由外而内)**,\nwhile **application (运用)** proceeds from **inner to outer (由内而外)**.\nSince **men (男)** lack a **womb (子宫)**, the **Lower Cauldron (下丹田)** serves as the **Great Cauldron (大鼎)**—\nthus, the **names are the same but their meanings differ (此所以名同有异)**.\n\n*(As noted by Master Yánníng: Though the **Elixir Classics (丹经)** speak of the **Cauldron (鼎)** in terms of the **Furnace (炉)**—with the **Cauldron above and the Furnace below (鼎在上而炉在下)**—this text mentions only the **Cauldron (鼎)** without the **Furnace (炉)**. Moreover, it names all three upper, middle, and lower positions as **Cauldrons (鼎)**, which does not align with the ancient methods. The measurements of \"one inch and three fen (一寸三分)\" and \"two inches and eight fen (二寸八分)\" are difficult to standardize. Scholars should not rigidly adhere to these, lest they be misled.)*\n\nFrom **Master Lü’s Gold Collection (吕师金华集)**:\n**Both eyes return their light (二目回光)**,\n**from the level of the two eyes (由二目齐平之间)**,\n**intent wholly focused (一意专注)**,\nuntil the **Lower Cauldron (下丹田)**.\nAfter the **Severing the Dragon Method (女子断龙工法)** is completed,\nsettle in **tranquility (安静)** for several moments.\nThen, **intent returns from the space between the two eyes (意由二目中间)**,\n**light focused on the Breast Meridian (回光注至乳溪)** thirty-six times,\n**on the inner navel (注脐内)** thirty-six times,\n**and on the Lower Cauldron (即子宫，注下丹田)** thirty-six times.\n**Intent draws the waters of the Hua Pool (华池水)** to the **Upper Cauldron (上鼎)**,\n**draws the two liquids of the heart and lungs (引心肺二液)** to the **Upper Cauldron (上鼎)**,\n**intent sends the true gold from the Sea (海中真金)** to the **Upper Cauldron (上鼎)**—\nthen **intent seems to exert force (意似着力)** and sends it downward,\nto the **Middle Cauldron (中鼎)**,\nthen to the **Great Cauldron (大鼎)**,\n**swirling eighteen times (盘旋十八次)**.\nWithin, **hot fire ascends (内热火升)**,\n**the Cauldron is settled, the embryo congealed (鼎安胎凝矣)**.\n\n---\n\n（**Lu Shi’s Annotation on the *Jin Hua Ji*:** This passage’s function and meaning are unclear. Beginners may find it difficult to follow.）\n\n**Section Six: Self-Regulation of Embryonic Breath**\nBreathing can avoid faults such as wind-induced asthma and coarse shallowness. Once nasal breathing is refined,\n**each breath returns to its root (息息归根)**,\n**breathing moves with the pulse (息行脉动)**,\n**breathing ceases, the pulse stops (息住脉停)**.\nAncient texts say: *\"Inhaling qi does not bring longevity; longevity requires subduing the breath (伏气).\"*\nWhen **true breath circulates (真息运行)**,\n**it can subdue the breath (伏气)**.\nAfter the **Dragon-Subduing Practice (断龙工法)**,\n**sit still for another hour (静一时)**,\n**before the seven emotions (七情) arise**,\n**and random thoughts (杂念) emerge**.\nThen, **place the foot against the Spring Fountain (足抵泉扉)**,\n**press the lips over the teeth (唇包齿藏)**,\n**let intent follow the eye’s light (意随目光)**,\n**and focus it on the space between heart and kidneys (心肾)**—\n**three inches and eight *fen* apart (相去三寸八分)**—\n**revolving left and right forty-nine breaths (左旋右转四十九息)**.\n**Sweet dew arrives (甘露自来)**,\n**as if swallowed by the *tian* (如咽是提)**,\n**the *tian* then returns to the navel (提即归脐)**,\n**and the qi congeals (气即凝矣)**.\nWith prolonged practice,\n**breathing occurs spontaneously (不呼自呼, 不吸自吸, 不提自提)**,\n**the gate of the female elixir (牝户) opens and closes naturally**,\n**warm and harmonious as spring (和暖如春)**,\n**and the elixir (丹) forms naturally**.\n\n（**Lu Shi’s Annotation:** The phenomena between refining breath and achieving embryonic breath remain unexplained.\nThe claim that the space between heart and kidneys is **three inches and eight *fen*** is also insufficiently grounded.）\n\n**Section Seven: Elixir Refinement through Embryonic Breath**\nFor men: **The River Vehicle (河车)**,\n**the Spirit Fire subdues the wind (神火息风)**,\n**daily gathering returns to the furnace (日采归炉)**,\n**refining into the minor elixir (炼成小药)**.\nWhen **qi is abundant and spirit is whole (气足神圆)**,\n**the major elixir forms (便成大药)**,\n**the Five Dragons bear the Sage (五龙捧圣)**,\n**harmonizing naturally with the heavens (运合天然)**.\nFrom the **Lower Cauldron (下田)** it ascends to the **Middle Cauldron (中田)**,\n**enhancing qi and nourishing spirit (益气养神)**,\n**then to the Upper Field (上田)**,\n**first piercing the Jade Gate (先透顶门)**,\n**the elixir refines through the jade liquid (玉液还丹)**,\n**the cream of wisdom pours forth (醍醐灌顶)**.\nWhen the **yang spirit is fully refined (阳神炼熟)**,\n**one is called an immortal (神仙)**.\n\nIf asked about **women’s elixir refinement (女子玉液还丹)**,\nit is the **Red Dragon transforming into the White Phoenix (赤龙化为白凤)**,\n**filling the Lower Cauldron (充满下田)**,\n**as if pregnant with an embryo (恍如胎孕)**.\nWhen **the practice is complete and qi transforms (功满气化)**,\n**the spirit light is whole (神光圆足)**,\n**piercing the Jade Gate (透出顶门)**,\n**the yang spirit is refined (炼就阳神)**,\n**the elixir returns through the jade liquid (玉液还丹)**,\n**the cream of wisdom pours forth (醍醐灌顶)**.\nThis does not depart from the prior method,\nbut **one must, like the Queen Mother in Kunlun Palace, listen to the subtle sounds (微妙音)****.\n\n（**Lu Shi’s Annotation:** The discussion of the female method is too brief and insufficient as instruction.）\n\n**Section Eight: Refining the Yang Spirit**\nTo refine essence and augment qi,\nto refine qi into spirit—\nthis is the **inner elixir of men**,\nto refine blood and augment qi,\nto refine qi into spirit—\nthis is the **inner elixir of women**.\n\nBoth employ **fire and wind**.\nFor women, the **Severed Dragon** lies in transforming blood into qi,\nand it is said: *\"Regulate the breath to transform qi into spirit.\"*\nIf qi is not refined, spirit will be insufficient,\nand the form will not be embodied—\nonly the **yin spirit** remains,\nnever the **yang spirit**.\n\nIn **meditative stillness**, use the **Six Character Mantra (六字诀)**,\ndirecting

      "translated_text": "**\"The Authentic Dao of Female Alchemy (Nǚgōng Zhízhǐ)**\n*Composed by Qīngxìa Língyáng, the Daoist Immortal*\n*Edited by Chén Lìngníng*\n\n**Preface**\nThis work was originally titled *The Golden Peak Direct-Pointing Authentic Dao of Female Alchemy (Jīnhuá Zhízhǐ Nǚgōng Zhéngfǎ)*, attributed to Qīngxìa Língyáng. It was intended to circulate in the world as one of the dedicated texts for female cultivation. Indeed, there exist in the world both ordained and Dao-seeking women who, upon obtaining this work, may verify its methods of pure refinement.\n\nHowever, because the text has endured for the longest time, it has been extensively corrupted by those who blindly cultivate without insight—many passages, though comprising over a thousand two hundred characters, are merely disjointed compilations, filled with decayed phrases and excessive rhetoric. Thus, they are omitted. Additionally, four sections—on **Daoist teachings (道教)**, **Confucian teachings (儒教)**, **Buddhist teachings (释教)**, and **heretical teachings (邪教)**—are unrelated to the cultivation of **Female Alchemy (女丹)**, and their discussions of the broad principles and histories of the Three Teachings (三教) are often incomplete. The section on heretical teachings is particularly unrefined and vulgar, so all such passages have been deleted. From the first section through the sixth, the text expounds on the **Dao of Female Alchemy (女丹)**, though these methods are forced and artificial, not in accordance with the natural **Way (道)**. Yet, since their origins are ancient, scholars should still be aware of them.\n\nThe seventh section is too brief, while the eighth and ninth sections discuss the **Yang Spirit (阳神)**, interspersed with many terms from external teachings, differing markedly from the specialized vocabulary of the **Immortal Arts (仙家)**. These have been corrected based on the **Yáng Yīyǔ’s (杨一羽) Chéngfēng (成丰) Eighth Year engraving**, so as to avoid the confusion of mingling inferior pearls with fish eyes.\n\nThe tenth section is unimportant. The eleventh section is merely the author’s idealistic musings, not worth serious consideration. The two appendices are included only for supplementary reference. The original also featured sixteen **seven-character absolute verses (七言绝句)**, titled *The Swift Essentials of the Authentic Dao of Female Alchemy (女功正法捷诀)*, whose applications align with the preceding sections—only reiterating what has already been said. Thus, they are omitted.\n\nReaders must understand: the **Immortal Arts (神仙之学)** rest on four fundamental principles.\nFirst, **practice reality, not emptiness (务实不务虚)**.\nSecond, **discuss methods, not abstract theories (论事不论理)**.\nThird, **value the counterintuitive, not the conventional (贵逆不贵顺)**.\nFourth, **prioritize essential techniques, not mere textual study (重诀不重文)**.\n\nAll who carefully examine the **Alchemical Classics (丹经)** and **Daoist scriptures (道籍)** should adhere to these principles to avoid confusion. In this text, what is spoken of is **method (事)**, not **theory (理)**;\nwhat is practiced is **counterintuitive (逆)**, not **conventional (顺)**.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, what is passed down is **method (诀)**, not **text (文)**—all aligning with the second, third, and fourth principles.\n\nYet, the original was later distorted by reckless speculation, its **mystic syllables (嘛呢哆罗)** muddled in meaning, rendering the entire **Female Alchemy practice (女修工法)** neither horse nor deer—clearly at odds with the **Daoist Immortal tradition (仙道宗旨)** and clashing with the first principle of **practice reality, not emptiness (务实)**. Hence, all evident interpolations have been excised, preserving the **true (真)** and discarding the **false and perverse (伪邪)**.

**blood (血)**—when the cycle completes (**经满**), it **overflows (溢)**.\nIf one seeks **non-dissipation (无泄)** and **non-overflow (无溢)**, they must grasp **wind (风)** and **fire (火)**:\n**Fire (火)** is the **original spirit (元神)**;\n**Wind (风)** is the **true breath (真息)**.\nSpirit and breath interdependently arise through **observation (观)**.\nThe method enters via the **mysterious aperture of the eyes (目中玄窍)**, directing **qi (气)** into the **breathing orifice (气穴)**.\n**Qi (炁)** enfolds the spirit, which condenses through **intent (意摄)**.\nThe **natural wind and fire (天然风火)** merge without ceasing—\n**consuming essence (易精)** and **refining qi (易气)**,\n**refining qi nourishes the spirit (易气益神)**,\n**spirit completes the transformation (神圆形化)**—\na **second body (身外有身)** emerges.\n\nThe **method states**:\n*\"Only when spirit and breath constantly attend each other,*\n*does the body’s form dissolve into jade nectar.*\n*By long gazing at the **Eternal Fountain (长生窟)**,*\n*the **yang spirit (阳神)** is refined, manifesting at the **crown (顶门)**.*\n*Know that all things born must die,*\n*yet the **original spirit (元神)** dies and is reborn.*\n*If one can dwell the spirit within the **qi (气)**,*\n*the **nourishment of the infant (婴儿赡养)** will succeed.*\n*By mastering this, who fears **Internal Alchemy (内丹)** will not be attained?\"*\n\nThe **method** relies on the **Conception, Governing, and Penetrating Vessels (冲任督脉)**,\nits **circulation (运)** occurs at **External, Middle, and Internal Passes (外中内关)**.\nYet, **Female Alchemy (女修)** differs slightly—\nbeginning at **Upper Pass (上关)**, the **breast meridian (乳溪)**,\nthen at **Middle Pass (中关)**, the **navel interior (脐内)**,\nfinally at **Lower Pass (下关)**, the **womb (子宫)**.\nThe **Middle and Lower Passes (中下)** are then unified as one **orifice (穴)**.\n\nFor men, **refining essence (炼精)** is called **Great Yang Refining Qi (太阳炼气)**;\nfor women, **refining blood (炼血)** is called **Great Yin Refining Form (太阴炼形)**.\n\nThe **secrets of wind and fire (火风之秘)** must be timed like **martial and civil virtues (候宜文武)**—\n**martial (武)** at the center,\n**civil (文)** at the beginning and end.\nThe **microcosmic orbit (周天)** unfolds without deviation from **observation (观)**.\nWithin a **single day (一日)**, the **twelve hours (十二时)**,\nwherever the **intent (意)** reaches,\n**refinement can occur (皆可为也)**.\n\nThose who grasp **pre-heaven qi (先天之气)** and **post-heaven qi (后天之气)**\nwill appear **as if drunk (似醉)** daily.\n\nOrdinary women, steeped in **worldly habits (世俗)**, indulge in **greasy meats and raw flesh (荤腥)**,\neasily generating **lustful thoughts (欲念)**.\nSeeing others marry, they **blame themselves in secret (中怀自怨)**,\n**spring sensitivity (春感)** and **autumn injury (秋伤)** breed **timidity illness (怯病)**.\nExcessive **cold foods (生冷)** worsen **menstrual stagnation (经滞)**,\nwhile **seduction (诱惑)** leads to **ruin of body and reputation (身名俱败)**,\nand **eternal regret (报恨终天)**.\nThus, one must **heed this warning (鉴此)**,\n**avoid karmic entanglements (莫造孽缘)**.\n**Endure (忍)** brings **tranquility (自安)**,\n**repent (悔)** brings **joy (自乐)**.\n**Intent (意)** should seem **to fill the cup (似捧盈)**,\nyet the **heart (心)** remains **still as water (止水)**.\n**Timing (时效)** aligns with **the Golden Man (金人)***—\n**silence the lips, conceal the tongue

cleansed (欲净)**,\n**naturally still (自然定静)**—\nlike a **mirror’s clarity (如镜之明)**,\nlike **water’s depth (如水之澄)**.\nOnce the heart is purified (**心既洁矣**),\nthen **seek to recognize the foundation (即求识基)**.\n\nWomen, by **nature (原)**, possess the **Kun body (坤体)**—\n**yin back (阴背)**, **yang front (阳腹)**,\n**breasts (乳房)** as **external apertures (外窍)**,\n**breast meridian (乳溪)** as **internal orifices (内穴)**.\nThe **sixth layer of the breast (第六重楼)**, at **six and a half divisions (六分半处)**,\nfaces the **external orifice of the tenth layer (十重楼外阙)**.\nSit **straddling the crane (跨鹤)**,\n**legs crossed at the knees (腿膝交迭)**,\n**seal the Lower Pass (紧闭下关, 泉扉)**,\n**retain the **original qi (固元气)**,\n**stir the Upper Pass (运动上关)**—\n**the breast meridian (乳溪)** must **not leak downward (下免泄漏)**.\nThe **Middle Pass (中关)**, within the **navel (脐内)**, is **one inch and three divisions (一寸三分)**.\n\nTo **avoid the five leaks (无五漏)**,\n**guard the three passes (须守三关)**:\n**Ears listen inwardly (耳常内听)**,\n**Eyes gaze inwardly (目常内视)**,\n**Mouth closed, no speech (口闭不言)**,\n**Qi directed into the breast meridian (气纳乳溪)**,\n**Spirit condensed in the **Golden Room (金室)***,\n**Nature still in the **Ocean of Awareness (觉海)***,\n**Intent focused on the **Cinnabar Palace (丹宫)***.\n\n**Unification (归一)** lies only in **observation (惟观)**—\n**Gold Mother (金母)** observes the **heart (观心)**,\n**Laozi (老子)** observes the **orifice (观窍)**.\nAt **twenty-six hours (二六时中)***,\nobserve **before its manifestation (未发)**—\n**seven emotions (七情)** absent,\n**five aggregates (五蕴)** originally **void (空)**,\nthe **heart dwells in freedom (心常自在)**,\n**lively and unrestrained (活泼泼地)**—\nlike **my teacher, Master Lü (吕师)**,\nwhose **Daoist source (道源)** is **Jade Purity (玉清)**.\n**Condense the spirit (凝神)** at the **breathing orifice (气穴)**,\n**direct the intent downward (注下)** to the **Cinnabar Field (丹田)**,\n**intent led from the eyes (意由目中)**,\n**drawn into the breathing orifice (引入气穴)**.\n**Pre-heaven qi (先天气)** arrives,\n**post-heaven qi (后天气)** enters—\n**keep it ever-present (刻刻存之)**.\n\nFor women, the **breast meridian (乳溪)** is the **Upper Cinnabar Orifice (上丹穴)**;\nbehind the **navel (脐后)**, before the **kidneys (肾前)**, is the **Middle Pass (中关)**;\nthe **vulva (牝户)** is the **Lower Pass (下关)**;\nthe **womb (子宫)** is the **Great Cauldron

(先天种子)** is the **source of life (命之本源)**.\n\nFor men, **original essence (元精)** is the **greatest yang qi (至阳之气)**;\nfor women, **true blood (真血)** is the **greatest yin essence (至阴之精)**—\n**the body’s treasure (生身之宝)**, **root of all transformations (万化之根)**.\nMen store it at the **Gate of Life (命门)**;\nwomen store it at the **vulva (牝户)**—\nwithin the **womb (子宫)**.\nWhen **desire stirs (欲动)**, it is hard to retain;\nwhen **the heart is still (心静)**, it can be preserved—\nyet **wind and fire (风火)** must be **refined and stored (炼化常存)**.\n\n---\n**Second Section: Cultivating the Menstrual Cycle and Initiating Practice**\nAt age **seven for women (女子二七)**, **menstruation (经行)** depletes their **blood (血)**—\nthough the **monthly renewal (月月信水再生)** occurs,\neach month **still

(不复再伤)**.\n**Having (有)** is the **beginning of non-having (无之始)**,\n**non-having (无)** is the **end of having (有之终)**.\n**Focus intent (着力)** where **having (有)** exists—\n**post-heaven qi flows (后天气通)**;\n**direct intent (用意)** where **non-having (无)** is—\n**pre-heaven qi is full (先天气盈)**.\n**Eyes follow intent (目随意至)**,\n**spirit and breath interdependently arise (神息相依)**—\n**refining blood augments qi (易血益气)**,\n**refining qi nourishes the spirit (炼气养神)**.\nBegin at the **Middle Pass (中关)**,\n**intent seeming to exert force (意似着力)**,\n**straight upward (往上直提)** thirty-six

I now add explanation: \"Knocking the teeth seventy-two times (叩齿七二)\" means knocking the teeth seventy-two times. \"Thirty-six times (三十六次)\" refers to nasal breaths thirty-six times—each inhalation and exhalation counts as one breath. Within thirty-six breaths, if counting inhalation and exhalation separately, there are thirty-six inhalations and thirty-six exhalations, totaling seventy-two times, matching the knocking of the teeth. This is because each inhalation corresponds to one knock, and each exhalation corresponds to another knock.

They should not act rashly or recklessly. It is best to consult multiple texts, grasp the principles thoroughly, and achieve **fusion and mastery (融会贯通)** before attempting practice. They must be extremely careful, stopping immediately if any obstruction arises, otherwise they risk falling ill. Relying solely on this text is insufficient. I vow to publish and disseminate **over ten ancient female elixir (女丹)** texts, either with annotations, corrections, or supplements, so that they may become the most complete collection of **female elixir precepts (女丹诀)** in history, to be issued sequentially. The difficulty that women have faced in the past was the lack of texts to study. Now that issue is resolved. You must read widely, study diligently, and seek out those who have already practiced these methods to discuss with them.

Moreover, it names all three upper, middle, and lower positions as **Cauldrons (鼎)**, which does not align with the ancient methods. The measurements of \"one inch and three fen (一寸三分)\" and \"two inches and eight fen (二寸八分)\" are difficult to standardize.
