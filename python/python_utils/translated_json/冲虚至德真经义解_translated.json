  "full_translation": "**Exegetical Commentary on the *True Scripture of Perfect Virtue in Emptiness and Stillness***\n\n**Title:** *Exegetical Commentary on the True Scripture of Perfect Virtue in Emptiness and Stillness*\nComposed by Emperor Huizong of the Song, Zhao Ji. Completed in the year *Wuxu* of the *Zhenghe* era.\nOriginal text in eight fascicles; six fascicles survive.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, *Jade Instructions* Category.\nSee also *Four Commentaries on the True Scripture of Perfect Virtue in Emptiness and Stillness*, compiled by Gao Shouyuan of the Jin.\n\n---\n\n**Fascicle One of the *Exegetical Commentary on the True Scripture of Perfect Virtue in Emptiness and Stillness***\nBy Emperor Huizong of the Song\n\n**Heavenly Omens**\nThings undergo birth and transformation; the Dao/Way is without past or present.\nOnly those who embody the Dao/Way can remain unchanging yet constant, responding to things without harboring intentions.\nThus, *Heavenly Omens* begins with birth and transformation and concludes with the brigandry of the Guo clan.\n\nLiezi dwelled in the state of Zheng for forty years, yet no one recognized him.\nThe lord, ministers, and grandees regarded him as one of the common folk.\nOf old, those adept in the arts of the scholar were subtle, wondrous, and profoundly penetrating—so deep as to be unknowable.\nWhen the state’s resources were insufficient, he prepared to depart for Wei.\nHis disciples said: \"Master, you depart without a set time for return. Dare we make a request? What teaching will you leave us?\"\nThe Master replied: \"Have you not heard the words of Master Huqiu Zilin?\"\nLiezi laughed and said: \"What did Master Hu say?\"\n\"Though it be so, the Master once spoke to Bohun Maoren. I overheard it in passing and shall now tell you:\nThe Dao/Way cannot be spoken; to speak of it is to miss it.\nThen what did Master Hu say?\nWhen compelled to speak, he spoke, and so I heard and now convey it.\nHis words were: 'There is birth that is not birth; there is transformation that is not transformation.\nThat which does not birth can birth birth; that which does not transform can transform transformation.\nThat which is born cannot but be born; that which transforms cannot but transform—thus there is constant birth and constant transformation.\nConstant birth and constant transformation mean there is no time without birth, no time without transformation.\nSuch is yin and yang; such are the four seasons.\nThat which does not birth is called *dubious solitude*; that which does not transform is called *reciprocity*.\nReciprocity—its bounds cannot be exhausted.\nDubious solitude—its Dao/Way cannot be fathomed.\nBirth proceeds from nonbeing to being; transformation proceeds from being to nonbeing.\nThat which is born and transformed is *thing*; that which neither births nor transforms is the Dao/Way.\nThings are bound by number, so that which is born cannot but be born, and that which transforms cannot but transform.\nThe Dao/Way courses through things, thus there is constant birth and constant transformation, with no time without birth, no time without transformation.\nStanding alone above the myriad things, that which does not birth is called *dubious solitude*, pervading and inexhaustible.\nThus, that which does not transform is called *reciprocity*.\nReciprocity—its bounds cannot be exhausted.\nFor none can know its beginning or end.\nDubious solitude—its Dao/Way cannot be fathomed.\nFor it cannot be measured or probed.\nNo thing can pair with it—how could one truly know its *wherefore*?\nOne can only doubt it.'\n\nThe *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: 'The valley spirit does not die; it is called the *mysterious female*.\nThe gate of the mysterious female is called the root of heaven and earth.\nSubtly continuous, as if present, its use is inexhaustible.'\nThus, that which births things does not birth; that which transforms things does not transform.\nSelf-birthing, self-transforming, self-shaping, self-coloring, self-knowing, self-empowering, self-diminishing, self-ceasing—\nTo call these *birth and transformation, shape and color, knowledge and power, ebb and flow* is incorrect.\nThe movement of yin and yang, the progression of the four seasons, the principles of the myriad things—suddenly born and existing, suddenly transformed and gone.\nForm solidifies, color manifests, wisdom schemes, power acts, ebb and flow wax and wane—ending only to begin again.\nNo movement without change; no time without shift.\nThough all reside in the Dao/Way, their ceaseless revolving is self-so.\nLiezi said: 'Of old, the sages followed yin and yang to unify heaven and earth.\nIf that which has form is born from the formless, then how did heaven and earth come to be?'\nThus it is said: There was *Great Simplicity*, *Great Beginning*, *Great Inception*, *Great Purity*.\n*Great Simplicity* is the state before qi appeared.\n*Great Beginning* is the inception of qi.\n*Great Inception* is the inception of form.\n*Great Purity* is the inception of substance.\nWhen qi, form, and substance were complete yet not yet separated, it was called *Hunlun*.\n*Hunlun* means the myriad things were intermingled and not yet separated.\nInvisible to sight, inaudible to hearing, untraceable by touch—thus it is called *Simplicity*.\n*Simplicity* has no form or boundary; it transforms into *One*, *One* transforms into *Seven*, *Seven* transforms into *Nine*.\n*Nine* is the ultimate transformation.\nThen it transforms again into *One*.\n*One* is the inception of form’s transformation.\nThe clear and light ascended to become heaven; the turbid and heavy descended to become earth; the harmonious qi became human.\nThus, heaven and earth deposited their essence, and the myriad things were transformed and born.\nYin and yang are the greatness of qi; heaven and earth are the greatness of form.\nWhen qi transforms and takes form, there is yin and yang, and then there are heaven and earth.\nThe Dao/Way is their commonality; the sage is the steward of the Dao/Way.\nThis is how the sage follows yin and yang to unify heaven and earth.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* speaks of *Great Ultimate*, which generates the Two Modes.\nThis is what *Zhuangzi* meant by 'the Dao/Way existing prior to the Great Ultimate.'\nThus, *Great Simplicity* is the state before qi appeared, dwelling in the indistinct and vague, transforming to give rise to qi.\nThus, *Great Beginning* is the inception of qi; qi transforms to give rise to form.\nThus, *Great Inception* is the inception of form; form differentiates to give rise to substance.\nThus, *Great Purity* is the inception of substance.\nWhen qi, form, and substance are complete yet not yet separated, the full embodiment of the Dao/Way is therein.\nThus it is said: *Hunlun*—this is what *Laozi* meant by 'a thing chaotically formed.'\nNo use for brightness, thus invisible to sight; no application for hearing, thus inaudible; no exertion of strength, thus untraceable.\nThese three cannot be interrogated, thus they merge into *One*.\nYet having called it *One*, can one truly remain silent?\"\n\nThis is why it is forcibly named *Change*. *Change* has no fixed boundaries, for it has no form. When *Change* is likened to yang, it arises from the One, thus transforming into the One. Numbers begin with the One, thus transforming into seven—this is the state of contraction before expansion. Seven transforms into nine—this is the interaction that brings about change. When numbers reach their limit at nine, they revert to the One. The One is the inception of all transformations, and thus heaven, earth, and humanity all derive their existence from it. Therefore, it is said: that which is pure and light ascends to become heaven; that which is turbid and heavy descends to become earth; that which is harmonious qi becomes humanity. Essence is the One. The One gives rise to the Two, the Two gives rise to the Three, and the Three gives rise to the myriad things. Thus, heaven and earth contain essence, and the myriad things are transformed and born.\n\nMaster Liezi said: \"Heaven has no complete achievement, the sage has no complete ability, and the myriad things have no complete use.\" Thus, heaven’s duty is to give life and provide cover; earth’s duty is to shape and bear; the sage’s duty is to teach and transform; and things fulfill their proper roles. Yet heaven has its shortcomings, earth has its strengths, the sage has limitations, and things have their capacities. Why is this? That which gives life and cover cannot shape and bear; that which shapes and bears cannot teach and transform; that which teaches and transforms cannot defy what is proper; and that which is fixed in propriety does not overstep its position. Thus, the Way of heaven and earth is either yin or yang; the teachings of the sage are either benevolence or righteousness; and the proper roles of the myriad things are either softness or hardness. These all follow what is proper and cannot overstep their positions.\n\nHeaven is positioned above, earth is positioned below, and the sage is positioned between heaven and earth. All serve to complete transformations. As transformations alternate and arise, the myriad things take on different proper roles. How could heaven, earth, and the sage defy what is proper? Thus, in relation to heaven and earth, the sage distinguishes the three poles yet unites them as the three talents. That which gives life and cover cannot shape and bear; that which shapes and bears cannot teach and transform; that which teaches and transforms cannot defy what is proper. That which is fixed in propriety does not overstep its position—this speaks to the division of duties.\n\nTherefore, in terms of their distinctions, the Way of the sage reaches up to heaven and coils down to earth, transforming and nurturing the myriad things, beyond all imagery. Then, above and below flow as one without distinction—how could there be comparisons of long and short, or differences of capacity and limitation? Thus, there are beings that are born, and there is that which gives birth; there are forms, and there is that which forms; there are sounds, and there is that which sounds; there are colors, and there is that which colors; there are flavors, and there is that which flavors. That which is born of birth perishes, yet that which gives birth never ends. That which is formed of form is solid, yet that which forms never exists. That which is sounded of sound is heard, yet that which sounds never emits. That which is colored of color is manifest, yet that which colors never appears. That which is flavored of flavor is tasted, yet that which flavors never presents itself. These are all the duties of non-action.\n\nBirth, form, sound, color, and flavor are all transformations of things, thus the hidden departs and the manifest arrives. Yet that which gives birth, that which forms, that which sounds, that which colors, and that which flavors—these are the subtleties of the Dao/Way. Who can trace their origin? Who can grasp their end? The Dao/Way is ever non-active yet accomplishes all—this is why it is so.\n\nIt can be yin, it can be yang; it can be soft, it can be hard; it can be short, it can be long; it can be round, it can be square; it can give life, it can bring death; it can be hot, it can be cold; it can float, it can sink; it can be gong, it can be shang; it can emerge, it can submerge; it can be dark, it can be yellow; it can be sweet, it can be bitter; it can be foul, it can be fragrant. It is without knowledge, without ability, yet there is nothing it does not know, nothing it cannot do. To have partial knowledge or ability is but a one-sided aspect of the Dao/Way, not its full and complete realization. Yet to be without knowledge yet know all, without ability yet do all—this is to encompass all, to pervade all. What is there it cannot do?\n\nYin and yang are qi; softness and hardness are substance; short and long are form; round and square are vessels; life and death are numbers; heat and cold are seasons; floating and sinking are conditions; gong and shang are sounds; emergence and submergence are paths; dark and yellow are colors; sweet and bitter are flavors; foul and fragrant are odors. All transformations arise from these. Were the ancients not complete in this?\n\nThe six penetrations, the four openings, the small and the great, the refined and the coarse—all move together without ceasing, whither could they not reach? Where would they find no leisure?\n\nMaster Liezi journeyed to Wei and took a meal by the roadside. His followers saw a century-old skull, plucked a clump of mugwort, and pointed at it. Turning to his disciple Bai Feng, he said: \"Only you and that one know that you have never been born and never died. Does this surpass nurturing life? Does this surpass joy?\n\nThere are seeds of transformation: the frog becomes a quail; in water, it becomes a *ji*; at the border of water and earth, it becomes the garment of the *wapin*. Born on a hillock, it becomes *lingxi*. The *lingxi* meeting *yuqi* becomes *wuzu*. The root of *wuzu* becomes the *qichan*; its leaves become butterflies. The butterfly, in time, transforms into an insect, born beneath the stove, its form like a cast-off skin, its name *niaogouduo*. After a thousand days, *niaogouduo* transforms into a bird called *ganyugu*. The foam of *ganyugu* becomes *simi*. *Simi* becomes *shixiyilu*. *Shixiyilu* gives rise to *shixihuanghuang*. *Shixihuanghuang* gives rise to *jiuyou*. *Jiuyou* gives rise to *maorui*, and *maorui* to *fuxuan*. Sheep’s liver transforms into *digao*; horse’s blood into *zhuanlin*; human blood into *wildfire*. The sparrowhawk becomes the *zhan*; the *zhan* becomes the cuckoo; the cuckoo, in time, reverts to the sparrowhawk. The swallow becomes the clam; the field mouse becomes the quail; the rotten melon becomes the fish; old leeks become amaranth; old ewes become apes; fish eggs become insects.\n\nThe beast *danyuan* conceives of itself and is born, called *lei*. The bird of rivers and marshes is born by sight alone, called *yi*. The purely female is named *dayao*; the purely male is named *zhifeng*. The yearning scholar, though unwed, is moved; the yearning maiden, though husbandless, conceives. Hou Ji was born from a giant’s footprint; Yi Yin from the hollow mulberry; Jue Zhao from dampness; the vinegar fly from wine. *Yangxi* paired with the un-sprouted bamboo, and from long-standing bamboo came *qingning*. *Qingning* gave rise to *cheng*; *cheng* to the horse; the horse to man; man, in time, enters the mechanism. All things emerge from the mechanism, all things return to the mechanism.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"Trace beginnings to their end, and you will know the discourse on death and life.\" For where there is birth, there must be death, yet what dies here is not necessarily unborn elsewhere. One who comprehends this knows, like you and that one, that there is no birth, no death. Now living, now dying; now dying, now living—this is nurturing form and delighting in life. What exists now is but what once passed away. Thus it is said: \"Does this surpass nurturing life? Does this surpass joy?\"\n\nAll things replace one another in different forms, so the transformations of life and death cannot be counted. Thus it is said: \"There are seeds of transformation.\" What follows is but what the eyes and ears can perceive. The frog becoming a quail speaks of the transformations of the myriad things between land and water. The *ji*, the garment of the *wapin*, the *lingxi*—these are one kind. Some, meeting water and earth, are born below; others, meeting hillocks, are born above. This speaks of the myriad things transforming according to the forms and qi they encounter.\n\nThe *lingxi* meeting *yuqi* becomes *wuzu*, borrowing another thing as its body. The root of *wuzu* becomes the *qichan*; its leaves become butterflies—scattering the same body into different things. The butterfly, in time, transforms into an insect, born beneath the stove, its form like a cast-off skin, its name *niaogouduo*. Here, the winged becomes the wriggling. After a thousand days, *niaogouduo* transforms into the bird *ganyugu*—the burrower becomes the tree-dweller. Some shift by form, like *simi* becoming *yilu*. Others arise from putrefaction, like *huanghuang* born from *fuxuan*, or *digao*, *zhuanlin*, and *wildfire*. Some reverse by nature, like the sparrowhawk becoming the *zhan*, the *zhan* the cuckoo, the cuckoo reverting to the sparrowhawk. The swallow becomes the clam; the field mouse the quail; the rotten melon the fish; old leeks the amaranth; old ewes the ape; fish eggs the insect—some follow kind, others unite unlike kinds.\n\nThe beast *danyuan* conceives of itself and is born, called *lei*—is this transformation without stimulus? The bird of rivers and marshes is born by sight alone, called *yi*—is this transformation without union? The purely female is named *dayao*; the purely male *zhifeng*—in things, there are those that generate themselves through yin and yang alone. The yearning scholar, though unwed, is moved; the yearning maiden, though husbandless, conceives—in humans, there are those who connect subtly beyond yin and yang. Even Hou Ji born from a giant’s footprint or Yi Yin from the hollow mulberry, though inexplicable, are not strange.\n\nJue Zhao was born from dampness—transformed by qi. The vinegar fly was born from wine—transformed by flavor. *Yangxi* paired with the un-sprouted bamboo—transformed by habit. Long-standing bamboo gave rise to *qingning*—the inanimate generating the animate. *Qingning* gave rise to *cheng*—the unknowing generating the knowing. The *Shizi* says *cheng* is like a leopard; *cheng* gives rise to the horse—like generating like. The horse gives rise to man—unlike generating unlike. Thus, the comings and goings of insects, the life and death of plants, transformations are endless, never reaching a limit. How could one know the order of life and death?\n\nOnly this: all things in birth have their sprouting, in death their return. The sage, in this, knows there is a mechanism they cannot control. The *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: \"Form in motion does not generate form but shadow; sound in motion does not generate sound but echo; non-motion does not generate non-being but being—form must ultimately end.\"\n\nDoes heaven and earth come to an end? They end together with me. Do they advance toward an end? I do not know. Does the Dao come to an end? It has no beginning, so how could its root be transient? Where there is birth, there is a return to non-birth; where there is form, there is a return to formlessness. That which does not birth is not originally non-birthing; that which is formless is not originally formless. Birth is the inevitable end of principle. Ending cannot but end, just as birth cannot but birth. To desire the permanence of life and the fulfillment of its end is to be deluded by calculation.\n\nThe spirit is heaven’s portion; the bones and flesh are earth’s portion. That which belongs to heaven is clear and disperses; that which belongs to earth is turbid and gathers. When spirit departs from form, each returns to its true nature—this is called *gui* (ghost). *Gui* means \"return,\" a return to the true dwelling. The Yellow Emperor said: \"When spirit enters its gate and bones return to their root, what of me remains?\" Stillness restores one’s nature; movement departs from the root—such is principle. When form moves, it does not generate form but shadow; when sound moves, it does not generate sound but echo; non-movement does not generate non-being but being—thus one drifts ever farther from the root. Non-being gives rise to being, and being must return to non-being; therefore, it is said that form must ultimately end.\n\nHeaven and earth are born together with me, and when they end, they end together with me. Who knows their limit? Thus, to speak of an end is to advance toward the unknown. That which has an end has a beginning, that which endures has a transience—these are but temporal phenomena. Therefore, the ultimate Dao takes the beginningless as its beginning, and to end at the root is to reach the ultimate. The enduring takes the non-enduring as its ultimate, and to advance toward the root is to reach the ultimate. Why is it that where there is birth, there is a return to non-birth, and where there is form, there is a return to formlessness? That which does not birth is not originally non-birthing; that which is formless is not originally formless—this is seen only from the perspective of those with birth and form. Birth is the inevitable end of principle; ending cannot but end, just as birth cannot but birth. To desire life’s perpetuity and set death as its boundary—how could one know the endlessness within the cycle? This is to be deluded by calculation.\n\nBirth is the harmony bestowed by heaven and earth. The spirit is heaven’s portion, thus clear and dispersing; the bones and flesh are earth’s portion, thus turbid and gathering. When spirit scatters, each returns to its true nature—what then remains of me? This is spoken from the perspective of the common people. Thus it is said: \"When spirit enters its gate and bones return to their root, what of me remains?\" As for the sage, above they wander with the Creator, below they befriend those without end or beginning—thus their form never decays, and their self alone endures.\n\nFrom birth to death, the great transformation of man passes through four stages: infancy, youth and prime, old age, and death. In infancy, qi is concentrated and the will is unified—harmony is at its peak. No thing harms it, and no virtue surpasses it. In youth and prime, blood and qi surge, desires and thoughts arise abundantly—things assail it, and virtue thus declines. In old age, desires and thoughts soften, the body prepares to rest—no thing precedes it. Though it does not match the wholeness of infancy, it surpasses the state between youth and prime. In death, one comes to rest, returning to the ultimate.\n\nIn infancy, qi is concentrated and the will is unified—harmony is at its peak, what the *Laozi* calls \"the thickness of containing virtue.\" In youth and prime, blood and qi surge, desires and thoughts arise abundantly—what *Zhuangzi* calls \"entanglement with the world.\" In old age, blood and qi have declined, thus desires and thoughts soften and the body prepares to rest. Upon returning to the true dwelling, one comes to rest and returns to the ultimate. *Zhuangzi* said: \"The great clod burdens me with form, labors me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death.\" This is what he meant.\n\nFrom infancy to death, all is called *cu* (passing away), thus it is called transformation. Confucius was traveling on Mount Tai when he saw Rong Qiqi walking in the wilds of Cheng, wearing a deerskin robe tied with a rope, plucking his zither and singing. Confucius asked him: \"Sir, what is the reason for your joy?\" He replied: \"My joys are many. Heaven generates the myriad things, and man is the most noble—this is my first joy. Among the distinctions of male and female, the male is honored and the female is lowly—since I have been born a man, this is my second joy. Some do not live to see the sun and moon, never leaving swaddling clothes—I have already reached ninety years, this is my third joy. Poverty is the constant of the scholar; death is the end of man. Abiding in constancy and meeting one’s end, what is there to grieve?\" Confucius said: \"Excellent! He is able to console himself.\"\n\nLin Lei was nearly a hundred years old. In late spring, he donned a fur robe and gleaned fallen grain in an old field, singing as he walked. Confucius, passing through Wei, saw him in the wilds and said to his disciples: \"That old man may be worth speaking to. Try going to question him.\" Zigong volunteered and met him at the edge of the ridge. Facing him, he sighed and said: \"Sir, do you have no regrets, singing and gleaning as you go?\" Lin Lei walked on without stopping, his song unbroken. Zigong persisted in questioning him, and he finally looked up and answered: \"What should I regret?\" Zigong said: \"In your youth, you did not strive in conduct; in your prime, you did not compete with the times; in old age, you have no wife or children; death approaches—what joy is there in gleaning and singing?\" Lin Lei laughed and said: \"The reason for my joy is something all men possess, yet they turn it into sorrow. In youth, I did not strive in conduct; in my prime, I did not compete with the times—thus I have lived so long. In old age, I have no wife or children; death approaches—thus I can be so joyful.\"\n\nZigong said: \"Longevity is what men desire; death is what men detest. Why do you take death as joy?\"\n\nLin Lei replied: \"Death and life are but a departure and a return. Thus, those who die here—how do we know they are not born there? Therefore, I know they are not the same, and how do I know that busily seeking life is not delusion? How do I know that my death now is not better than my life before?\"\n\nZigong, not comprehending his meaning, returned and told the Master. The Master said: \"I knew he was one with whom words could be shared—indeed, so it is. Yet what he has grasped is not yet complete.\"\n\nThe *Yi* says: \"Rejoice in Heaven and know fate, thus free from care.\" Abiding in constancy, one attains fulfillment. Death and life bring no change to oneself—this is the source of one’s joy. Cultivating the self, accepting poverty or prosperity, knowing that going and coming are not fixed, and that I am not disturbed in mind—what sorrow can there be?\n\nYet to know joy and to know sorrow is not true joy. Confucius took the absence of joy as true joy. Rong Qigi was truly able to ease himself. But Lin Lei has grasped it yet not fully.\n\nZigong, weary of study, said to Confucius: \"I wish to rest for a while.\"\n\nConfucius replied: \"In life, there is no rest.\"\n\nZigong said: \"Then shall I, Ci, have no rest at all?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"There is rest. Look to the grave mound—its clarity like a tower, its height like a stele, its grandeur like a tumulus, its separation like a cauldron. There you will know rest.\"\n\nZigong said: \"Great is death indeed! The noble man rests there; the petty man lies low.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"You have understood, Ci. Men all know the joy of life, yet not the suffering of life; they know the weariness of old age, yet not its ease; they know the dread of death, yet not the rest of death. If one studies the Dao yet does not reach the understanding of death, what is the use of study? You, Zigong, weary of learning and wishing to rest, have not yet understood the meaning of death. Thus the Master told you that in life there is no rest, and pointed to the grave mound—its clarity like a tower, its height like a stele, its grandeur like a tumulus, its separation like a cauldron, cut off from the world. This is the place of rest.\n\nYet the multitude calls death a thing, while the noble man, though dead, does not perish. Thus it is said: the noble man rests there; the petty man lies low.\n\nThe toil of life is what wearies me with life; the ease of old age is what eases me with age; the rest of death is what gives me rest in death.\n\nYanzi said: \"How excellent that the ancients had death! The virtuous rest there; the unvirtuous lie low.\" Death is the culmination of virtue. The ancients called the dead \"those who return.\" If the dead are called \"those who return,\" then the living are \"those who journey.\" To journey without knowing to return is to lose one’s home. If one man loses his home, the world condemns him; if the world loses its home, none know to condemn it.\n\nThere are those who leave their homeland, abandon their six relations, forsake their family and livelihood, and wander the four directions without returning—what manner of men are they? The world must call them mad and reckless. And there are those who cherish worldly success, weigh their words, prize their bodies and lives, boast of their skills, cultivate fame, and vaunt themselves in the world without self-knowledge—what manner of men are they? The world must call them wise and cunning. Both are lost, yet the world approves one and not the other. Only the sage knows what to approve and what to reject.\n\nDeath and life are indeed great matters. To perfect one’s life is to perfect one’s death. Thus it is said: how excellent that the ancients had death. To die yet not perish is called longevity. The virtuous attain longevity; the unvirtuous perish with things. Thus it is said: the virtuous rest there; the unvirtuous lie low.\n\n*Jiao* (culmination) is the place of return. Life is yang; life is the radiance of virtue, and radiance stems from yang. Death is yin; death is the culmination of virtue, and culmination stems from yin. Thus to take life as journeying and death as returning is also the meaning of yin and yang, movement and stillness.\n\nThe mad and reckless are lost in one way; the outwardly cunning are lost in another. To reject this and take that—this is the blindness of the world. Only the sage knows what to approve and what to reject.\n\nSomeone asked Liezi: \"Why do you value emptiness?\"\n\nLiezi said: \"Emptiness is nothing to value.\"\n\nLiezi said: \"Not in name. Nothing compares to stillness; nothing compares to emptiness. Stillness and emptiness—these attain their proper place. Taking and giving—these lose their place.\n\nWhen affairs are shattered and broken, then there arises the performance of benevolence and righteousness—but it cannot be restored. Where there is value, there is baseness; where there is name, there is substance. Emptiness has none of these.\"\n\n*Laozi* says: \"Attain utmost emptiness, guard deep stillness. Emptiness suffices to receive all things; stillness suffices to respond to all movements.\" Thus it is said: nothing compares to stillness; nothing compares to emptiness.\n\nTo take emptiness and stillness as attaining their proper place means that the movements and things of the world cannot obstruct them. To take taking and giving as losing their place means that rejecting this and taking that is to be attached.\n\nWhen the great Dao declines, there is benevolence and righteousness. When affairs are shattered and broken, then there arises the performance of benevolence and righteousness—how can it return to the Dao?\n\nZhou Xiong said: \"Revolving without cease, heaven and earth shift imperceptibly—who notices? Thus what is diminished there is filled here; what is completed here is diminished there. Loss and gain, completion and diminution follow the world and follow death. Coming and going connect without gap—who notices?\n\nIn general, qi does not advance all at once; form does not diminish all at once. One does not perceive its completion; one does not perceive its diminution. It is like a man from youth to old age—his appearance, complexion, wisdom, and demeanor change day by day without notice.\"\n\nSkin, nails, and hair follow the world and fall away—there was never a time in infancy when they paused or remained unchanged. The intervals are imperceptible; one only knows in hindsight.\n\nThe spirit is that which subtly pervades all things. If its subtlety eludes recognition, then all that clings to form, is bound by number, or confined within heaven and earth—where the revolving of the two qi never ceases and the coming and going of the myriad things never ends—how can one seek its governing and propelling force and find it? How then could one claim to know it? Only the sage, penetrating to the source of things, awakens to this and merges with it. Those who only know in hindsight are among the last to awaken, if they awaken at all.\n\nIn the state of Qi, there was a man who worried that heaven and earth would collapse and he would have no place to dwell, so he neglected sleep and food. Another man, concerned about his concern, went to enlighten him, saying: \"Heaven is but an accumulation of qi, with no place devoid of qi. You bend and stretch, breathe and move, spending all day within heaven—why worry about collapse?\" The man said: \"If heaven is but an accumulation of qi, should not the sun, moon, and stars fall?\" The enlightener replied: \"The sun, moon, and stars are merely luminous accumulations within qi. Even if they fell, they could cause no harm.\" The man said: \"What of the earth’s ruin?\" The enlightener replied: \"The earth is but an accumulation of clods, filling the four directions with no place devoid of clods. You tread and step, spending all day upon the earth—why worry about its ruin?\" The man was suddenly relieved and overjoyed. The enlightener was also suddenly relieved and overjoyed.\n\nWhen Changluzi heard of this, he laughed and said: \"Rainbows, clouds, winds, rain, and the four seasons—these are the accumulations of qi that form heaven. Mountains, rivers, seas, metals, stones, fire, and wood—these are the accumulations of form that constitute the earth. To know that they are accumulations of qi and clods—how can one say they do not decay? Heaven and earth are but a tiny thing within the void, the greatest of bounded things. That they are difficult to exhaust, difficult to fathom—this is certainly so. To worry about their decay is indeed too distant; to say they do not decay is also incorrect. If heaven and earth cannot but decay, then they will eventually return to decay. When their time of decay arrives, why should one not worry?\"\n\nWhen Liezi heard this, he laughed and said: \"To say heaven and earth decay is also mistaken; to say they do not decay is also mistaken. Decay and non-decay—I cannot know them. Nevertheless, they are one and the same. Thus the living do not know death; the dead do not know life. The coming do not know going; the going do not know coming. Decay and non-decay—why should I concern myself? From the perspective of vessels, there is completion and there must be decay. From the perspective of the Dao, there is no completion and no decay. Those confined to vessels say that because they have form and qi, they cannot but decay. Those who penetrate the Dao know that they neither sink nor fall, and thus cannot decay. Only the enlightened understand this penetration. This is why Liezi has no concern for such matters.\"\n\nShun asked Zheng Zhuangzi, who served as minister, saying: \"Can the Dao be obtained and possessed?\" He replied: \"Your body is not your own—how can you possess the Dao?\" Shun said: \"If my body is not my own, then whose is it?\" He replied: \"It is the entrusted form of heaven and earth. Life is not your own—it is the entrusted harmony of heaven and earth. Nature and destiny are not your own—they are the entrusted compliance of heaven and earth. Children and grandchildren are not your own—they are the entrusted shedding of heaven and earth. Thus, in walking, you do not know where you go; in dwelling, you do not know what you hold; in eating, you do not know its flavor. Heaven and earth are strong and yang—mere qi. How then can you possess them?\n\nWhen empty, there is nothing; when full, there is something. All that can be obtained and possessed can be grasped and taken. The Dao is subtly formless, profoundly unknowable. Since it cannot be obtained and possessed, and a person’s body, form, nature, and destiny are all momentarily present and suddenly gone—how can one possess them? Form is the body, thus the body is the entrusted form of heaven and earth. Harmony is qi, thus life is the entrusted harmony of heaven and earth. The arising of things merely follows the principle of nature and destiny, thus nature and destiny are the entrusted compliance of heaven and earth. The body is the legacy of one’s parents, thus children and grandchildren are the entrusted shedding of heaven and earth. If this is so, then nothing is one’s own. Thus, in walking, one does not know where one goes; in dwelling, one does not know what one holds; in eating, one does not know its flavor. Since there is that which governs and that which impels, merely the strong yang qi of heaven and earth in motion—how can one possess the Dao?\n\nNevertheless, the Dao is that which all people jointly follow. Thus it is said: 'The Dao will dwell with you'—how could it ultimately be unobtainable and unpossessable? If one claims to possess it, then none can possess it. Only the sage possesses it by not possessing it.\"\n\nIn Qi, the Guo family was very wealthy, while in Song, the Xiang family was very poor. The Xiang family traveled from Song to Qi to ask for their method. The Guo family told them: \"I am skilled at theft.\" When I first began to steal, I was self-sufficient after one year, content after two, and greatly prosperous after three. From then on, my bounty extended to the entire district. The Xiang family was overjoyed, understanding the words of theft but not the way of theft. They then scaled walls and tunneled through rooms, taking whatever their hands and eyes reached. Before long, they were caught for their crimes and lost their ancestral property. The Xiang family, believing the Guo family had deceived them, went to complain. The Guo family said: \"How did you steal?\" The Xiang family described their actions. The Guo family said: \"Alas! Have you lost the way of theft to this extent? Now I will tell you. I have heard that heaven has its seasons, and earth has its advantages...\"\n\nI steal the seasons and advantages of heaven and earth, the abundant moisture of clouds and rain, the nurturing bounty of mountains and marshes, to grow my grain, cultivate my crops, build my embankments, and construct my dwellings. On land, I steal from the birds and beasts; in water, I steal from the fish and turtles—nothing is not stolen. Yet grain, crops, earth, timber, birds, beasts, fish, and turtles are all born of heaven. How can they be mine alone? Yet in stealing from heaven, I incur no misfortune.\n\nGold, jade, precious treasures, grain, silk, wealth, and goods are what men amass. How can they be granted by heaven? If you steal these and are punished, whom can you blame?\"\n\nThe Xiang family was greatly perplexed, believing the Guo family had deceived them once more. They went to consult Master Dongguo, who said: \"Is not your very body itself a theft? You steal the harmony of yin and yang to complete your life, to bear your form. How much more so for external things—are they not also stolen? Indeed, heaven, earth, and the myriad things do not stand apart. To claim possession of them is all delusion.\n\nThe Guo family’s theft is the public Way, and thus incurs no misfortune. Your theft arises from private desire, and thus you are punished. Where there is public and private, there is theft. Where there is neither public nor private, there is also theft. The interplay of public and private is the virtue of heaven and earth. One who understands the virtue of heaven and earth—who can say what is theft and what is not?\n\nTo take what is not yours is all theft. Some, through the public Way, incur no misfortune; others, through private desire, are punished. The difference lies only in whether one is burdened by attachment to possession or the illusion of ownership.\n\nYet those who distinguish public and private cannot escape desire, and thus it is said: where there is public and private, there is theft. Those who transcend public and private cannot forget entirely, and thus it is said: where there is neither public nor private, there is also theft. To embrace both public and private, to follow nature without contrivance—this is to hold all things in one’s embrace, and this is called the virtue of heaven and earth. One who understands this dissolves all distinctions and enters great unity. Though things differ in form, they harmonize with heaven and earth. How could I discern their distinctions?\"\n\nThus concludes the chapter \"Heavenly Omens.\"\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Virtue of the Vacuous and Subtle True Scripture*, Scroll One, Complete.\n*Explication of the Perfect Virtue of the Vacuous and Subtle True Scripture*, Scroll Two.\n\nEmperor Huizong of Song annotates: Among the ancients who illuminated the great Dao, the first priority was to clarify Heaven, followed by the Dao and virtue. *Liezi* begins with the \"Heavenly Omens\" chapter and follows it with \"The Yellow Emperor.\"\n\nIn the fifteenth year of his reign, the Yellow Emperor rejoiced that all under heaven supported him. He nurtured his proper destiny, delighted his ears and eyes, and satisfied his nose and mouth—yet his complexion grew sallow and dull, and his five senses became clouded and confused. Another fifteen years passed, and he grew anxious that all under heaven remained ungoverned. He exhausted his wisdom and strength, laboring for the myriad people—yet again his complexion grew sallow and dull, and his five senses became clouded and confused.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor then sighed in lament, saying: \"My excesses have been grievous. Nurturing only myself brings such calamity; governing the myriad things brings the same.\" Thereupon, he relinquished all affairs of state, abandoned his palace chambers, dismissed his attendants, silenced the bells, and reduced his meals. Withdrawing, he dwelled in seclusion in the Hall of the Great Court, purifying his heart and disciplining his form. For three months, he did not attend to governance.\n\nOne day, as he dozed, he dreamed of wandering in the land of Huaxu. The perfected do not allow things to burden their forms, nor their forms to burden their hearts. Above, they wander with the Creator; below, they befriend those beyond life and death, without beginning or end. Neither sorrow nor joy alters their state—what calamity could then arise? Thus, the Yellow Emperor cast off the burdens of the myriad things and sought to return to the One. Therefore, he purified his heart and disciplined his form, dreaming of wandering in the land of Huaxu.\n\nThe land of Huaxu lies west of Yan Prefecture and north of Tai Prefecture. Its distance from the Qi capital spans thousands of miles—beyond the reach of boats, carriages, or foot travel, accessible only through spiritual wandering. In that land, there are no teachers or rulers; all unfolds naturally. Its people have no desires or cravings; all arises spontaneously. Unaware of the joy of life or the dread of death, they know no premature demise. Unaware of attachment to self or detachment from things, they harbor no love or hatred. Unaware of defiance or compliance, they perceive no benefit or harm. They cherish nothing, fear nothing. They enter water yet do not drown; they enter fire yet do not burn. Blows and strikes cause no pain; prodding and scratching bring no itch. They tread the void as if walking on solid ground, rest in emptiness as if lying on a bed. Clouds and mist do not obstruct their vision; thunder and lightning do not disturb their hearing. Beauty and ugliness do not unsettle their hearts; mountains and valleys do not hinder their steps. They move only through the spirit.\n\nWest of Yan Prefecture and north of Tai Prefecture, thousands of miles from the Qi capital, the Dao of that land is profound and boundless. Thus, only those who wander in spirit can reach it. Without teachers or rulers, it governs itself; without desires or cravings, it is self-sufficient. Life and death do not alter their state; closeness and distance do not burden their bodies. They do not seek benefit, yet benefit does not come; they do not shun harm, yet harm does not arrive. They cherish nothing, fear nothing, and their hearts forget all. They enter water yet do not drown; they enter fire yet do not burn. Blows and strikes cause no pain; prodding and scratching bring no itch. Their forms are unencumbered. They tread the void and rest in emptiness, unobstructed and unobstructing. Wherever they go, they are unhurried. Thus, they traverse the realms of yin and yang, beyond human comprehension—how much more so for mortals? It is called \"spiritual wandering.\"\n\nUpon awakening, the Yellow Emperor felt joyful and content. He summoned Tian Lao, Li Mu, and Tai Shan Ji and said to them: \"For three months, I dwelled in seclusion, purifying my heart and disciplining my form, seeking the Dao of nurturing the body and governing things, yet I found no method. Exhausted, I slept and dreamed thus. Now I understand: the supreme Dao cannot be sought through emotion. I have grasped it; I have attained it—but I cannot convey it to you.\"\n\nTwenty-eight years later, all under heaven was well-governed, nearly resembling the land of Huaxu. Then the Emperor ascended in transcendence. *Jia* should be read as *xia* (\"departed\"); the people mourned him for over two hundred years without cease.\n\nThose who labor their forms and agitate their hearts, relying on knowledge and debate, fail to attain the Dao. Those who purify their hearts and discipline their forms, awakening to the obscure, succeed in attaining it. Though the Dao has essence and sincerity, it is without action or form. Thus, the supreme Dao cannot be sought through emotion. Those who know and attain it cannot convey it to others.\n\nMount Liegu in the midst of the sea and rivers is home to divine beings. They inhale the wind and drink the dew, partaking not of the five grains. Their hearts are like deep springs; their forms, like maidens. They neither cling nor love, yet immortals and sages serve as their ministers. They neither fear nor rage, yet the sincere and earnest act as their envoys. They neither bestow nor favor, yet all things are self-sufficient. They neither hoard nor accumulate, yet they lack nothing. Yin and yang are ever harmonious; sun and moon ever bright. The four seasons proceed in order; wind and rain are ever balanced. Nurturing and birth occur in due time; the harvests are ever abundant. The land knows no blight; the people, no premature death or misfortune. Things bear no blemish or pestilence; ghosts emit no eerie sounds.\n\nThe divine transcends all things in wondrous expression. Those who embody the divine’s wonder exist beyond form and number, thus they overcome things without burden. Inhaling wind and drinking dew, partaking not of the five grains, they are unconcerned with sustenance. With hearts like deep springs and forms like maidens, they are serene and undivided. Neither clinging nor loving, immortals and sages serve as their ministers. Neither fearing nor raging, the sincere and earnest act as their envoys—they align with the Dao and proceed in harmony. Thus, they act with ease and non-action, and yin and yang are harmonious and still. The multitude of beings remains unharmed. Therefore, they neither bestow nor favor, neither hoard nor accumulate. Yin and yang are harmonious; the four seasons proceed in order. Nurturing and birth occur in due time; the harvests are abundant. The people know no premature death or misfortune; things bear no blemish or pestilence; ghosts emit no eerie sounds. This is how the sage subtly completes the myriad things without omission.\n\nLiezi studied under Master Lao Shang and befriended Bo Gaozi. Advancing in the Dao of these two masters, he rode the wind and returned home. The classic states: \"One who excels in movement leaves no tracks.\" Though one who rides the wind leaves no visible traces, they still depend on something.\n\nOnly the spirit arrives without moving. Upon hearing this, Yin Sheng followed Liezi and lived with him, yet for months he did not return to his own dwelling. During a moment of leisure, he repeatedly entreated Liezi to teach him the art, but after ten requests, Liezi refused ten times. Yin Sheng grew resentful and asked to leave, yet Liezi gave no response. Yin Sheng withdrew. Months later, his discontent unabated, he returned to follow Liezi again. Liezi said, \"Why do you come and go so frequently?\" Yin Sheng replied, \"Formerly, I earnestly sought your instruction, but you refused to teach me, leaving me with lingering resentment. Now, my mind is suddenly at ease, so I have returned.\" Liezi said, \"Before, I took you for someone enlightened, but now your vulgarity has reached this point? Ji will tell you what I learned from my master. Three questions met with no answer; ten requests went unanswered—this is because the Dao fundamentally cannot be spoken. In the end, when I did receive instruction, it was only what my master had learned from his own teacher. Since I began serving my master and befriending such men, after three years, my heart dared not entertain judgments of right and wrong, nor my mouth speak of profit and harm. Only then did my master deign to glance at me once. After five years, my heart again pondered right and wrong, my mouth again spoke of profit and harm, and my master first relaxed his expression and smiled. After seven years, I followed my heart’s inclinations without right or wrong; I followed my mouth’s words without profit or harm. Only then did my master draw me to sit beside him on the same mat. After nine years, my heart roamed freely in thought, my mouth spoke freely in words, yet I knew not whether my judgments of right and wrong, profit and harm were mine or another’s. I knew not whether my master was my teacher or those men my friends. Within and without, I had advanced. Thereafter, my eyes were as ears, my ears as nose, my nose as mouth—all were the same. My mind congealed, my form dissolved, bones and flesh wholly merged. I no longer sensed the body’s support or the feet’s tread, drifting east and west with the wind like a withered leaf or dry husk. Did the wind ride me, or did I ride the wind? After three years without confusion, I first earned my master’s glance. After five years without obstruction, I reached the point of his smile. After seven years without encumbrance, he drew me to sit beside him. After nine years, when right and wrong, profit and harm could no longer bind me, self and other were forgotten, the five senses interpenetrated, and the wind bore me or I bore the wind—what room was there for deliberation?\n\nNow you, dwelling at your teacher’s gate for barely a season, have grown resentful and aggrieved again and again. Your limbs will not bear the qi, your joints will not be borne by the earth. How can one who treads the void and rides the wind hope to approach this? Yin Sheng was deeply ashamed, held his breath for a long while, and dared not speak further. One who attains the Dao forgets the heart—how much more so resentment and grievance? If your limbs cannot bear qi and your joints cannot be borne by the earth, then your body will no longer be your own. How then can you possess the Dao?\"\n\nLiezi asked Guan Yin, \"The perfected person moves through water without obstruction, treads fire without heat, walks above the myriad things without fear. May I ask how one reaches this state?\" Guan Yin replied, \"This is the preservation of pure qi, not the rank of cunning, skill, or boldness. Ji Yu will tell you. Ji Yu should read: 'Ji Wu.' All that has form, sound, or appearance is merely thing—how can things be distant from one another? Why should one strive to surpass them? They are but form. Thus, the Dao creates what is formless and abides where there is no transformation. One who attains this and exhausts it—how can they be considered correct? They dwell in measure without depth, conceal themselves in principles without origin, and wander through the beginning and end of the myriad things. Unifying their nature, nourishing their qi, embracing their virtue, they merge with the source of all things. Such a one’s heavenly endowment remains whole, their spirit without flaw—how could things enter them?\n\nConsider the drunkard who falls from a cart: though the fall is swift, he does not die. His bones and joints are the same as others’, yet the harm he suffers differs because his spirit is whole. He is unaware of riding or falling. Life and death, terror and dread do not enter his breast, so he encounters things without fear. If one preserved by wine can be thus, how much more one preserved by Heaven? The sage hides in Heaven, so nothing can harm them. The perfected person is divine. 'Pure' means their spirit remains unblemished. The Dao of purity and simplicity guards only the spirit. Guard it without loss, and you become one with the spirit. Thus it is said: The perfected person moves through water without obstruction, treads fire without heat, walks above the myriad things without fear. This is the preservation of pure qi, not the rank of cunning, skill, or boldness.\n\nForm, appearance, sound, and color have names and realities. Once names and realities exist, they cling to movement and stillness. Once they receive their completion, the form does not forget until its end. How then can one surpass them and alone reach what is prior? As a thing, the Dao creates what is formless and does not pair with things. It abides where there is no origin or transformation, standing independent and ungoverned by things. If form, color, name, and sound are insufficient to grasp its essence, then one who attains this and exhausts it—how can they be considered correct? The perfected person, in this, dwells in measure without excess, acting appropriately without overreaching. Concealed in principles without origin, they move without exhaustion. Wandering through the beginning and end of the myriad things, they roam with the Creator. Unifying their nature without division, nourishing their qi without depletion, embracing their virtue without dispersion, they merge with the source of all things—what is called creating the formless and abiding where there is no transformation. Their heavenly endowment remains whole, their spirit without flaw—how could things enter them? This is how they move through water without obstruction, tread fire without heat, walk above the myriad things without fear.\"\n\nThe drunkard riding in a carriage, by virtue of being wholly given to wine, can defy things without fear. The perfected person moves above the myriad things, by virtue of being concealed in Heaven, and thus overcomes things without any harm befalling them—both preserve the purity of their qi and do not deplete their spirit.\n\nLie Yukou shot for Bohun Wuren, drawing the bow to its fullest, placing a cup of water on his elbow. He loosed the arrows, the arrowheads overlapping, the shafts following one after another. At that moment, he was like a wooden figure. Bohun Wuren said: \"This is the shooting of one who shoots, not the shooting of one who does not shoot. Suppose I take you to climb a high mountain, tread on perilous rocks, and stand at the edge of an abyss a hundred fathoms deep—could you shoot then?\"\n\nThereupon, Wuren ascended the high mountain, trod on perilous rocks, and stood at the edge of an abyss a hundred fathoms deep. He turned his back, hesitating, with two parts of his feet hanging over the edge. He beckoned Yukou to come forward. Yukou prostrated himself on the ground, sweat streaming down to his heels. Bohun Wuren said: \"The perfected person gazes upward into the blue sky, plunges downward into the Yellow Springs, and brandishes their power to the eight limits—yet their spirit and qi remain unchanged. Now you tremble with the intent to follow your eyes—your inner state is perilous indeed.\n\nDrawing the bow to its fullest speaks of his strength; placing a cup of water on his elbow speaks of his precision; loosing the arrows with the arrowheads overlapping and the shafts following one after another speaks of his swiftness—yet like a wooden figure, it also speaks of his single-minded focus. However, this skill has not yet attained communion with the Dao. Thus it is said: This is the shooting of one who shoots, not the shooting of one who does not shoot.\n\nThe perfected person gazes upward into the blue sky—how could this be merely climbing a high mountain? They plunge downward into the Yellow Springs—how could this be merely standing at the edge of an abyss? They brandish their power to the eight limits, their spirit and qi unchanged—how could this be merely turning their back in hesitation with two parts of their feet hanging over the edge? Liezi prostrated himself on the ground, sweat streaming, unable to shoot—thus, though he preserved purity without depletion, his spirit had not yet attained perfection. Therefore it is said: Your inner state is perilous indeed.\n\nThe Fan clan had a son named Zihua, who was skilled at cultivating his private reputation. The entire state admired him; he was favored by the Lord of Jin yet held no office, ranking above the three ministers. Whatever he glanced at with partiality, the state of Jin ennobled; whatever he spoke of with partiality, the state of Jin demoted, no matter how base the words. Those who frequented his courtyard equaled the number in the court. Zihua had his knights attack one another with cunning and vulgarity, the strong bullying the weak. Though they were wounded and broken before him, he paid no heed. Day and night, he made this his amusement, until the state nearly became accustomed to such ways.\n\nHesheng, a senior retainer of the Fan clan, went on a journey and passed beyond the fields. He lodged at the cottage of Tian Geng Shangqiu Kai. (Note: *Tian Geng* should be read as *an old field hand*.) In the dead of night, Hesheng and Zibo spoke of Zihua’s fame and influence—how he could make the living perish and the dead live again, turn the rich into paupers and the poor into the wealthy.\n\nShangqiu Kai, who had long suffered from hunger and cold, had been eavesdropping from behind the north window. Seizing the chance, he borrowed provisions and a basket, then presented himself at Zihua’s gate. Zihua’s followers were all from noble families, clad in white silk, riding in grand carriages, strolling with leisurely strides and haughty gazes. When they saw Shangqiu Kai—old, frail, his face darkened by sun and wind, his robes and cap disheveled—they all sneered. Soon they grew bolder, mocking and deceiving him, shoving and striking, sparing no indignity. Yet Shangqiu Kai never showed the slightest anger, while the others, their tricks exhausted, grew weary of their own taunts.\n\nThen they ascended a high terrace, and one of them declared before the crowd: *\"Whoever can leap from here will be rewarded with a hundred gold pieces.\"* All clamored to accept. Shangqiu Kai, taking the words as true, leapt first—his body like a soaring bird, landing lightly on the ground without the slightest injury. The Fan clan’s followers dismissed it as mere luck and thought nothing of it.\n\nNext, they pointed to a secluded bend in the river and said: *\"There is a treasure pearl in those depths. Dive in, and you may retrieve it.\"* Shangqiu Kai dove in without hesitation. When he emerged, he indeed held a pearl. The crowd was now filled with doubt.\n\nZihua then ordered that Shangqiu Kai be given meat to eat and silk to wear. Soon after, a great fire broke out in the Fan clan’s treasury. Zihua said: *\"Whoever can enter the flames and retrieve the brocade will be rewarded according to what they bring back.\"* Shangqiu Kai showed no hesitation, walking into the fire and returning unscathed—no soot clung to him, no singeing touched his flesh. The Fan clan’s followers now believed him to be a man of the Dao, and they bowed in apology: *\"We did not know you were a man of the Dao and thus deceived you. We did not know you were a spirit and thus humiliated you. You must think us fools, deaf, blind! Pray, tell us of your Way.\"*\n\nShangqiu Kai replied: *\"I possess no Dao. Even in my own heart, I do not know how this comes to be. Yet since you ask, let me try to speak of it.\"*\n\nOnce, when the two guests lodged at my house, I heard them praise the power of the Fan clan, saying it could make the living perish and the dead live, the rich poor and the poor rich. I believed them wholeheartedly, without doubt, and so I came without hesitation. Upon arriving, I took their words as truth, fearing only that my belief might not be sincere enough or my actions not swift enough. I knew not where to place my body or where profit and harm lay—my heart was simply one. Things did not resist me; it was just like this.\n\nNow that I know their words deceived me, I harbor suspicion within and display caution without, clinging to the luck of not having been burned or drowned before. My heart grows hot with shame, and I tremble with fear. How could I dare approach water or fire again?\n\nAfter this, the followers of the Fan clan dared not insult even beggars or horse-doctors they met on the road, but would alight from their carriages and bow to them.\n\nZai Wo heard of this and told Confucius. Confucius said: *\"Do you not understand? A man of perfect sincerity can move things, stir heaven and earth, move ghosts and spirits, traverse the six directions, and meet no resistance—how could it be merely treading peril or entering water and fire? Shangqiu Kai believed in false things and yet met no resistance; how much more so when both parties are sincere? Remember this, my disciples. Sincerity gives rise to spirit, and when spirit is whole, it is the Way of the sage, who embraces spirit and wanders freely. Among the common folk, when purity and wholeness prevail, schemes, profit, and cunning are forgotten. When a man’s heart is untouched by thoughts of life and death, fear and dread, he may oppose things yet feel no terror, walk above the myriad things yet feel no trembling. If one deceives him with falsehood, and he responds with sincerity, where can he not go? Thus Shangqiu Kai climbed a high tower and threw himself down, yet his flesh and bones suffered no harm; he swam to a bend in the river and indeed obtained a pearl; he entered fire and returned without soot clinging to his body. That he was not burned was due to sincerity. The Way of perfect sincerity enters and unites with spirit, leaving no thought for the body’s place or where profit and harm lie, and so it can overcome things without being harmed. Thus a drunken man may fall from a carriage yet suffer no injury, and the Yellow Emperor lost his dark pearl only to have Xiangwang retrieve it. As for treading fire without feeling heat, Guan Yin surely took it to be the preservation of pure qi. But if cunning resides in the heart, then purity and wholeness are incomplete. When purity and wholeness are incomplete, spirit is unsettled, and the Way cannot bear it. Thus, when Shangqiu Kai realized their deception, his relief at not having been burned or drowned turned to trembling fear, and he could no longer approach water or fire—because cunning had arisen in his heart, and doubt had taken root. The distance between believing in falsehood with sincerity and concealing suspicion with insincerity is thus vast. As for the man of perfect sincerity, he surpasses even this. He can move heaven and earth, stir ghosts and spirits, traverse the six directions, and meet no resistance—how could it be merely treading peril or entering water and fire?\"*\n\nKing Xuan of Zhou had a herdsman named Liang Yang, a servant who could raise wild birds and beasts. He would scatter food in the gardens and courtyards, and even tigers, wolves, eagles, and ospreys would grow gentle. Male and female would gather before him, breeding and forming flocks; different species would dwell together without attacking or biting one another. The king, fearing the art would die with Liang Yang, ordered Mao Qiuyuan to learn it from him. Liang Yang said: *\"I am but a lowly servant—what art could I teach you? I fear the king will think I am hiding something from you. Let me tell you my method for raising tigers. All creatures with blood and qi rejoice when obeyed and rage when opposed—this is their nature. But do their joy and anger arise without cause? They are provoked by opposition. When feeding a tiger, one must not give it living prey, for it will kill in anger; nor whole prey, for it will tear it apart in anger. One must time its hunger and satiety, understand its anger—though tigers and humans are different species, they fawn upon those who raise them because they are obeyed. To kill them is to oppose them. So how could I dare oppose them and provoke their anger? Yet I do not obey them to make them happy. For joy inevitably turns to anger, and anger to joy—both are extremes. Now my heart holds neither opposition nor obedience, so the birds and beasts regard me as one of their own. Thus those that roam my gardens do not long for distant forests and open marshes; those that rest in my courtyards do not yearn for deep mountains and secluded valleys—this is the natural principle. The softest thing in the world gallops through the hardest—this is how the sage achieves great victory. Tigers and wolves are the fiercest of beasts; eagles and ospreys the most rapacious of birds. Different species dwell together without attacking or biting, content within the gardens and courtyards—this is because the method of taming and training them is grounded in the Way. The nature of life and destiny is at peace when obeyed. Joy and anger, when excessive, disrupt yin and yang. To oppose them and provoke anger—is this not contrary to the nature of life and destiny? Thus, when raising tigers, one must time their hunger and satiety, understand their anger—all to obey the nature of their life and destiny. How could I dare oppose them and provoke anger, which would violate their nature? Nor do I obey them to make them happy, which would indulge their nature. For joy inevitably turns to anger, and anger to joy—both are excesses of the Way. Now my heart holds neither opposition nor obedience, so I neither violate their nature by provoking anger nor indulge it by making them happy. Their contentment and ease are fitting. The sage’s way of nurturing life does not allow likes and dislikes to harm the body internally. Extending this to nurturing the myriad things and harmonizing the world—what other method is there? It is just this.\"*\n\nYan Hui asked Confucius: *\"I once crossed the deep abyss of Shang, and the ferryman handled the boat as if he were a spirit.\"*\n\nIf asked, he would say: *\"Can one learn to handle a boat?\"*\n*\"Yes,\"* he replied, *\"those who can swim may be taught. Those skilled in swimming often succeed. But as for the diver—he has never seen a boat yet rises to command it.\"*\n\nI questioned him further, but he would not answer.\nDare I ask what this means?\n\nOne who handles a boat as if a spirit does so because his Dao carries all under heaven—it cannot be fathomed.\n*\"Those who can swim may be taught\"* means they are not drowned by things.\n*\"Those skilled in swimming often succeed\"* means they have long abided in the Way.\nAs for the diver—never having seen a boat yet rising to command it—this is wondrous and beyond knowing.\nThat he would not answer when asked means the Dao has reached a point where it cannot be conveyed to others.\n\nConfucius said: *\"Speaking of medicine, you and I have long studied its texts, yet we have not grasped its reality—still, we persist in discussing it. Those who can swim may be taught because they treat water lightly. Those skilled in swimming often succeed because they forget the water. As for the diver—never having seen a boat yet rising to command it—he sees the abyss as a hill, the capsizing of a boat as the backing of his carriage. Though ten thousand things lie arrayed before him, none enter his dwelling. Where could he not be at ease?*\n\n*One who uses a clay pivot is skillful; one who uses an iron hook is cautious; one who uses a golden pivot is dull. Skill is one, yet when one clings to something, they value externals. All who value externals neglect their inner selves.\"*\n\nSpeaking of medicine is like sighing.\nMedicine is intention.\nTo call it *\"speaking of medicine\"* may imply correcting its errors.\n\n*\"Those who can swim may be taught because they treat water lightly\"*—thus, entering the water’s depths does not burden their form.\n*\"Those skilled in swimming often succeed because they forget the water\"*—thus, treading the water’s way brings no change to themselves.\nAs for the diver—never having seen a boat yet rising to command it—he unites self and things, doubting nothing in his course.\nLife and death, fear and dread do not enter his breast—how much less the ends of profit and harm?\n\nThis is why he sees the abyss as a hill, the capsizing of a boat as the backing of his carriage.\nThough ten thousand things lie arrayed before him, none enter his dwelling.\nThere is nowhere he is not at ease.\n\nIf one’s inner endowment in the Dao is not deep, their outer responses to things are easily swayed.\nThus, one who uses a clay pivot is skillful; one who uses an iron hook is cautious; one who uses a golden pivot is dull.\nThe ancients said *\"kòu\"* refers to mutual engagement—like casting lots or hooking stakes.\nThe heavier the stake, the more the mind clings.\nThus, with clay, one is skillful; with iron, cautious; with gold, dull.\nCaution fears loss; dullness is as if one has perished.\nHence it is said: *\"Those who value externals neglect their inner selves.\"* Neglecting the inner self means the heart is bound, unable to rest in ease.\n\nConfucius observed at Lüliang, where the water plunged thirty *ren* and the rapids surged thirty *li*—a place where soft-shelled turtles, alligators, fish, and turtles could not swim. He saw a man swimming there and thought him one in distress, seeking death. He sent his disciples along the current to rescue him. After several hundred paces, the man emerged, loosened his hair, and sang as he walked along the embankment.\n\nConfucius followed and asked him: *\"The water at Lüliang plunges thirty *ren*, and the rapids surge thirty *li*—a place where soft-shelled turtles, alligators, fish, and turtles cannot swim. When I saw you treading it, I thought you were in distress, seeking death, and sent my disciples along the current to save you. Yet you emerged, loosened your hair, and sang. I took you for a ghost, but seeing you are a man, I ask: Is there a Dao to treading water?\"*\n\nThe man said: *\"No. I have no Dao. I began with habit, grew with my nature, and completed it with destiny. I enter with the current and emerge with the flow. I follow the water’s way without private intent—this is how I tread it.\"*\n\nConfucius said: *\"What do you mean by beginning with habit, growing with nature, and completing with destiny?\"*\n\nThe man said: *\"I was born on the heights and am at ease on the heights—this is habit. I grew up in the water and am at ease in the water—this is nature. I do not know why I am so, yet I am so—this is destiny.\"*\n\nThough it is a place where soft-shelled turtles, alligators, fish, and turtles cannot swim, he swims there, forgetting the peril of crossing.\nTaking him for a ghost yet seeing he is a man, one might also suspect him of being a spirit.\nYet when asked about his Dao, it is simply following the water’s way without private intent.\n\n*\"Entering with the current\"* means sinking to the depths below.\n*\"Emerging with the flow\"* means floating to the surface above.\nHe simply follows its natural course—this is what is meant by *\"following the water’s way without private intent.\"*\n\n*\"Born on the heights and at ease on the heights\"* means not losing one’s place of origin.\n*\"Growing up in the water and at ease in the water\"* means not opposing one’s nature.\nThe natural is not burdened by externals, nor does it change within itself.\nThat which makes it so cannot be known—hence it is said: *\"I do not know why I am so, yet I am so—this is destiny.\"*\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao and Virtue, Scroll Two (concluded)*\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao and Virtue, Scroll Three*\n\nEmperor Huizong of the Song annotated:\n\nWhen Confucius traveled to Chu, he passed through a forest and saw a hunchbacked old man catching cicadas with a pole as effortlessly as if he were plucking them by hand. Confucius said, \"You are skillful indeed! Is there a Dao to this?\"\n\nThe old man replied, \"I have my Dao. After five or six months of practice, if I stack two pellets on the pole without them falling, I lose only a few cicadas; if I stack three without them falling, I lose only one in ten; if I stack five without them falling, it is as easy as plucking them by hand. When I stand, I am as still as a tree stump; when I hold my arm, it is as steady as a withered branch. Though the world is vast and the myriad things are many, I am aware of nothing but the cicada’s wings. I do not turn aside or waver, nor do I allow the myriad things to distract me from the cicada’s wings—how could I fail to succeed?\"\n\nConfucius turned to his disciples and said, \"When the will is undivided, it approaches the divine.\" This is what the hunchbacked old man meant.\n\nThe old man said, \"You, a scholar in fine robes, what do you know of such matters? First cultivate your own foundation, then you may speak of higher things. Concentration of will is called *essence*. One who is refined in the Dao can achieve anything. Standing as still as a tree stump, holding the arm as steady as a withered branch, one becomes motionless and forgets one’s own form. Though the world is vast and the myriad things are many, one is aware of nothing but the cicada’s wings. Without turning aside or wavering, without allowing the myriad things to distract from the cicada’s wings, the mind is single and unshaken, and external disturbances vanish. The longer one’s focus endures, the fewer the losses. Thus, at first, one loses only a few; with time, one loses only one in ten; and with even more time, it is as easy as plucking them by hand. There is no other reason—it is simply the concentration of will. Concentration of will is called *essence*; only the utmost essence can penetrate all things and attain the utmost spirit. Hence it is said: *When the will is undivided, it approaches the divine.*\"\n\nThere was a man from the seashore who loved gulls. Every morning, he went to the sea and followed the gulls, and hundreds of gulls would gather around him. His father said, \"I hear the gulls all follow you—bring some back so I may play with them.\" The next day, when he went to the sea, the gulls danced above him but would not land. Thus it is said: *The utmost words transcend words; the utmost action is non-action.* What the wisdom of the world knows is but shallow.\n\nThe ancients who possessed the Dao abandoned cunning and forgot scheming; their purity was complete within. Thus, when they entered the midst of beasts, the herds were not disturbed; when they entered the midst of birds, the flocks were not scattered. Birds and beasts did not fear them—how much less would humans? This is because their minds were fundamentally empty, and things naturally trusted them. If purity is not unalloyed, then cunning and scheming arise, and thus birds take flight to avoid the harm of nets and arrows. The gulls danced above but would not land because before, the man had abandoned cunning, but now he relied on it.\n\nThe sage does not govern the state with cleverness. When he speaks, his words are free from the entanglements of speech; when he acts, his actions leave no trace of effort. What the wisdom of the world knows is but shallow.\n\nWhen Viscount Xiang of Zhao led a hundred thousand men to hunt in Zhongshan, they set fire to the forest, and the flames spread for a hundred *li*. A man emerged from a stone cliff, moving up and down with the smoke and embers. The crowd thought him a ghost. After the fire passed, he walked out slowly, as if untouched by what he had endured. The Viscount detained him in wonder and observed him closely: his form, complexion, and seven apertures were those of a man; his breath and voice were those of a man. He asked, \"By what Dao did you dwell in the stone? By what Dao did you enter the fire?\"\n\nThe man replied, \"What do you call stone? What do you call fire?\"\n\nThe Viscount said, \"What you just emerged from was stone; what you just passed through was fire.\"\n\nThe man said, \"I do not know.\"\n\nMarquis Wen of Wei heard of this and asked Zixia, \"What sort of man was he?\"\n\nZixia said, \"From what I have heard of the Master’s teachings, one who is in harmony is at one with all things, and nothing can harm or obstruct him. He may wander through metal and stone or tread through water and fire—all is possible.\"\n\nThe Marquis said, \"Why do you not do this?\"\n\nZixia said, \"To carve out the heart and discard cleverness—I have not yet attained this. Nevertheless, I shall tell you when I have leisure.\"\n\nThe Marquis said, \"Why does the Master not do this?\"\n\nZixia said, \"The Master is capable but chooses not to act.\"\n\nThe Marquis was greatly pleased.\n\nWhen the mind is in darkness with the Dao, it is one with it, never having been separate. When form follows the changes of things, the ten thousand transformations are never not distinct. When self and things stand opposed, they divide into two categories. Harmonizing them with the natural boundary of Heaven, why seek to distinguish them? Self and things share the same root; that and this are one. Without the contrast of emptiness and fullness, how could anything obstruct one’s entry into stone cliffs? Without the friction of benefit and harm, how could anything injure one amidst smoke and embers? Thus it is said: *One who is in harmony is at one with all things, and nothing can harm him. One who is obstructed may wander through metal and stone or tread through water and fire—all is possible.*\n\nZixia knew this but had not yet attained it; the Master was capable but chose not to act. The Dao is not something those with intent can grasp from afar, nor is it something those without intent can draw near. Thus, Zixia said of this, \"To carve out the heart and discard cleverness—I have not yet attained this.\" The sage conceals himself in Heaven and does not display his abilities, so the Master’s ability to act yet choice not to is truly so. Those who laboriously wander through metal and stone or tread through water and fire, believing themselves to possess the Dao, set their Dao against the world, making it something others can point to and discuss. Thus, in *Liezi*, after examining the teachings of various masters, the text reveres the Master as the most complete.\n\nA divine diviner from Qi arrived in Zheng and was named Ji Xian. He could foretell a person’s death or life, survival or ruin, fortune or misfortune, longevity or early demise, predicting the year, month, ten-day period, or day with divine accuracy. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled. When Liezi saw him, he was enchanted and returned to tell Master Huqiu, saying, \"At first, I thought your Dao was the ultimate—now I see there is something even more ultimate.\"\n\nMaster Huqiu said: \"I have shown you only the outward forms of the Dao, not yet its true substance—how could you truly have attained the Way? A flock of hens without a rooster—how could they produce eggs? You set your Dao against the world and make it something verifiable, so naturally others can appraise you. This is explained in the *Zhuangzi*. Bring him here tomorrow and let me show myself to him.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Master Huqiu. When they emerged, Ji Xian said to Liezi: \"Alas! Your master is already dead—he cannot live. He will not last ten days. I see something strange in him, like damp ashes.\"\n\nLiezi entered, weeping so that his tears soaked his bedding, and told Master Huqiu. The Master said: \"Just now I showed him the patterned stillness of earth. Did *Zhuangzi* not speak of ‘unshaken and unceasing’? This is likely how he saw my sealed virtue at its subtlest. Strange appearances are not constant, and damp ashes do not rekindle. The utmost person moves the pivot of the Dao within the boundless, so that neither ‘this’ nor ‘that’ can find its counterpart. When the mechanism of virtue is sealed and does not activate, one’s responses seem to have lost their partner—thus I showed him the patterned stillness of earth. Seeing my sealed virtue at its subtlest, he declared me already dead. Earth shares its virtue with yin, yet their affairs differ in pattern: one is still, the other manifest. Hence ‘unshaken and unceasing.’ ‘Unshaken’ means not stirred; ‘unceasing’ means not fixed. Bring him again tomorrow.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Master Huqiu again. When they emerged, Ji Xian said to Liezi: \"Fortunate that your master met me! He is recovering. There is life in the ashes now—I see the sealed mechanism at work.\"\n\nLiezi entered and told Master Huqiu. The Master said: \"Just now I showed him the expanse of heaven and earth. Names and realities did not enter, yet the subtlest movement arose from the heels—this is the sealed mechanism at work. This is likely how he saw the subtlest stirrings of my goodness. The ‘life in the ashes’ may be interpreted as the presence of vitality within what was not rekindled. Earlier, seeing damp ashes, the sense of life had already vanished. Once extinguished, it was gone—hence he thought me dead. Now, seeing the sealed mechanism at work, the function of movement is still concealed. Yet since movement has already begun, he thought me alive. I showed him the expanse of heaven and earth—earth is soil that nurtures growth. What is ordained by heaven finds its nurturance here, hence ‘heaven and earth.’ When names and realities do not intrude, the true and the illusory merge. When the mechanism arises from the heels, it is the origin of nurturance—this is why it is called the sealed mechanism at work. The Dao cannot be seen, yet its continuation appears thus—hence he likely saw the subtlest stirrings of my goodness. Bring him again tomorrow.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Master Huqiu once more. Ji Xian said: \"Your master is not in a state of fasting—there is nothing I can appraise. Let him fast until dawn, and I will appraise him again.\"\n\nLiezi entered and told Master Huqiu. The Master said: \"Just now I showed him the Great Thoroughfare without trace. This is likely how he saw the balanced qi at its subtlest. The whirlpool of the salamander becomes an abyss; the still water’s whirlpool becomes an abyss; the flowing water’s whirlpool becomes an abyss; the overflowing water’s whirlpool becomes an abyss; the surging water’s whirlpool becomes an abyss; the spring water’s whirlpool becomes an abyss; the dammed water’s whirlpool becomes an abyss; the Ji River’s whirlpool becomes an abyss; the Fei River’s whirlpool becomes an abyss—these are the nine abysses. The patterned stillness of earth is yin overcoming yang; the expanse of heaven and earth is yang overcoming yin. As for the Great Thoroughfare, it contains both yin and yang yet is neither yin nor yang—hence ‘the Great Thoroughfare without trace.’ *Zhen* is the omen of spirit in things, unfathomable in its yin and yang—thus no trace can be found. Moreover, the Thoroughfare is the intersection of yin and yang. The Great Thoroughfare without trace reveals only perfect equilibrium—hence it is called the balanced qi at its subtlest. The alternation of yin and yang, intersecting without trace, can be understood through the nine abysses. *Pan* means the reversal of flow. Only by reversing flow can wholeness be preserved—this is why each whirlpool becomes an abyss. The whirlpool of the salamander’s spiral becomes an abyss, illustrating wholeness in utmost movement; the still water’s whirlpool becomes an abyss, illustrating wholeness in potential stillness; flowing water illustrates emergence. When it overflows and mingles with things, emergence is excessive. Surging water illustrates entry—when it saturates things, entry is exhausted. The dammed water, having emerged, returns—this differs from the exhaustion of entry. The Ji River, having emerged, does not flow—this differs from the return. The Fei River emerges differently but returns to the same—thus the reversal of flow preserves wholeness, and its meaning is fully expressed here. Yet *Zhuangzi* mentions only three, for when divided they are nine, and when united they are three—their essence is one. Bring him again tomorrow.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Master Huqiu once more. Before Ji Xian could steady himself, he lost his composure and fled. Master Huqiu said: \"Pursue him.\" Liezi chased him but could not catch up. Returning, he reported to Master Huqiu: \"He has vanished, disappeared—I could not reach him.\"\n\nMaster Huqiu said: \"Just now I showed him what has never yet departed from my source. I met him with emptiness and effortless change, not knowing who or what he was. He took me for drifting reeds, for flowing waves—hence he fled.\"\n\nAfter this, Liezi considered himself as one who had never yet begun to learn. He returned home and did not go out for three years. He cooked for his wife, ate the food of pigs, treated all matters with equal detachment, carved and polished only to return to simplicity, stood alone like a clod of earth, and remained sealed and whole to the end.\n\nWhat has never yet departed from my source—this is how the sage takes heaven as his source and conceals himself within it. Thus he has never yet departed from my source. (See *Zhuangzi* commentary.)\n\nOn his way to Qi, Liezi turned back halfway. He encountered Bohun Wuren, who asked: \"Why have you returned?\" Liezi said: \"I was startled. By what?\"\n\n\"I dined at ten millet-porridge stalls, yet five of them served me first.\"\n\nBohun Wuren said: \"If this is so, then why were you startled?\"\nLiezi replied: \"When inner sincerity is not dissolved, the body’s subtlety radiates outward, overawing others’ hearts, making them slight the noble and the aged while exalting their own concerns. Those porridge-sellers merely peddle their wares for a living, with no great profit to spare. Their gains are meager, their influence slight—yet even they behave thus. How much more so a lord of ten thousand chariots, whose body is wearied by the state and whose wisdom is exhausted by affairs? If he were to entrust me with tasks and demand results, I would have cause to be startled.\n\nThe utmost person of antiquity, clear and plain, returned to simplicity through non-action. The heavenly mechanism remained unstrung, silently harmonizing with the Dao. Vague as if absent yet present, effortless as if formless yet spirit-filled—then few would know me, and I would be truly esteemed. If inner sincerity is not dissolved, the heart cannot be forgotten. If the body’s subtlety radiates outward, the form cannot be transcended. Overawing others’ hearts, making them slight the noble and aged while prizing oneself, wearied in body by the state, and exhausting one’s wisdom in affairs—then the pain of sorrow and the ease of joy will alternately afflict the body, while the fear of coercion and the delight of caution will flood the heart. With such concerns pressing, how could one not be startled?\"\n\nBohun Wuren said: \"Excellent insight! If you conduct yourself thus, others will safeguard you.\"\n\nBefore long, Liezi went to visit him, only to find the sandals outside his door piled high. Bohun Wuren stood facing north, leaning on his staff and propping his chin. After a while, he departed without a word. The attendant informed Liezi, who rushed barefoot to the gate, sandals in hand, and asked: \"Master, since you have come, have you not neglected your medicine?\"\nBohun Wuren replied: \"It is done. I had already told you: others will safeguard you. And now they truly do.\"\n\n\"It is not that you can make others safeguard you, but that you cannot prevent them from doing so—why then rely on such influence? Influence breeds premeditated responses, and premeditation yields anomalies.\n\nMoreover, if one must be influenced, it is to shake the very foundation of one’s being—what meaning does that hold? Those who wander with you offer no warning; their petty words are all poison to others. With no awakening and no realization, how can one discern what truly matters?\n\nHow excellent is this observation! It praises one’s ability to turn inward. When you conduct yourself thus, you are instructed to retreat and conceal. The perfected person embraces the spirit and roams amidst the mundane, allowing no one to glimpse their depths—this is what it means to conduct oneself. If you do not conduct yourself thus, others will safeguard you. Yet their safeguarding is not what we mean by ‘allowing no glimpse.’\n\nThus, only after being influenced does one respond; not seeking distinction is the very way to prevent others from safeguarding you. Premeditation leads to response after influence, while seeking distinction leads to the pursuit of anomaly. In such cases, not only do others indeed safeguard you, revealing your dependence on them, but you must also be influenced, shaking the foundation of your being, inevitably burdened by external things.\n\nThose who wander with you offer no warning, so you remain unaware. If their petty words are all poison to others, how can they not bring harm? Without awakening and without realization, how can one long abide in the Way? Thus, what comparison can be made? ‘Comparison’ here means mutual transformation through prolonged exposure.\n\nYang Zhu traveled south to Pei, while Lao Dan journeyed west to Qin, meeting by chance in the outskirts. When they reached Liang, they encountered Laozi. Midway, Laozi looked up to the heavens and sighed: ‘At first, I thought you could be taught, but now I see you cannot.’ Yang Zhu made no reply. Upon reaching the lodging, he washed his hands and face, combed his hair, removed his sandals outside the door, and advanced on his knees, saying: ‘Earlier, Master, you looked up to the heavens and sighed, saying, “At first, I thought you could be taught, but now I see you cannot.” Your disciple wished to ask for an explanation, but your journey afforded no pause, so I dared not speak. Now that you have paused, may I inquire as to my fault?’\n\nLaozi said: ‘Your haughty gaze and arrogant bearing—with whom could you dwell? The purest white appears tarnished; the greatest virtue seems insufficient.’\n\nYang Zhu’s expression changed abruptly, and he said: ‘I respectfully receive your instruction.’\n\nOn his previous journey, when he arrived at a lodging, the host welcomed him, the master of the house laid out the mat, the host’s wife presented the comb and towel, the guests yielded their seats, and the cook left the hearth. On his return, however, the hosts vied with him for seats.\n\nA skilled merchant conceals his wealth as if empty; a noble person of great virtue appears foolish. Those who know me are few, and thus those who emulate me are esteemed. Those who adorn their wisdom to astonish fools, or feign fervor to stand out, who self-promote and self-display—how can they speak of the Dao?\n\nEven Liezi, who had no intention of startling others, was still criticized. How much more so Yang Zhu, who altered his appearance and demeanor to distinguish himself from the crowd—his stubbornness was indeed untamable.\n\n‘The purest white appears tarnished’ means cleansing the profound mirror of perception until not a single flaw is seen; though it bears the world’s filth, it does not cultivate the body to reveal its defilement. ‘The greatest virtue seems insufficient’ means that virtue cannot be surpassed, yet one does not consider oneself excessive—this is what is called ‘the highest virtue does not act as virtue.’\n\nWhen Yang Zhu heard this instruction and departed, the hosts vied for seats—this was nearly the case. For when he first arrived, they welcomed and served him, treating him as extraordinary; upon his return, the hosts vied for seats, showing how lightly they regarded him. Thus, the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within. Therefore, one must abandon that and adopt this.\n\nYang Zhu passed through Song and stayed at an inn in the east. The innkeeper had two concubines: one beautiful, the other ugly. The ugly one was favored, while the beautiful one was slighted. Yang Zhu asked the reason. The innkeeper’s servant replied: ‘The beautiful one is proud of her beauty, so I do not see her as beautiful; the ugly one is ashamed of her ugliness, so I do not see her as ugly.’\n\nYang Zhu said: ‘Take note, disciples: act with virtue but abandon the conduct of self-regard. Wherever you go, will you not be loved?’\n\nFrom the perspective of the Dao, things have no inherent beauty or ugliness. To know beauty as beauty is to set ugliness in opposition. What the world deems beautiful is called wondrous; what it deems ugly is called foul. Yet the wondrous transforms into the foul, and the foul transforms into the wondrous—how then can beauty and ugliness be distinguished? The sage does not cling to right or wrong, beauty or ugliness, but empties the self to wander through the world. Without arrogance or boasting—this is what is meant by ‘acting with virtue but abandoning the conduct of self-regard.’ None in the world contend with such a one in ability, nor in merit. Thus, wherever one goes, will one not be loved?\n\nThe world has a Way that always prevails and a Way that does not always prevail. The Way that always prevails is called softness; the Way that does not always prevail is called strength. Both are known, yet people do not understand them. Thus, the ancients said: ‘Strength first opposes what is not equal to oneself; softness first yields to what surpasses oneself. One who first opposes what is not equal will, upon reaching equality, be imperiled. One who first yields to what surpasses oneself will face no peril. Using this to overcome a single person is like overcoming a multitude; using this to bear the world is like bearing nothing. This is called overcoming without striving and bearing without burden.’\n\nMaster Zhou said: ‘To be firm, one must guard with softness; to be strong, one must preserve with weakness. Accumulating softness leads to firmness; accumulating weakness leads to strength. Observe what is accumulated to know the direction of fortune and misfortune. Strength that prevails over what is not equal to oneself will, upon reaching equality, become brittle. Softness that yields to what surpasses oneself has immeasurable power.’\n\nLao Dan said: ‘When weapons are strong, they perish; when trees are strong, they break. The soft and weak belong to the realm of life; the hard and strong belong to the realm of death.’\n\nOnly the sage can accumulate countless small victories to achieve great triumph. Laozi said: ‘Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet nothing can surpass it in attacking the hard and strong, for nothing can replace it. If something could replace it, one would follow others and lose oneself—how then could one prevail over things?’\"\n\nOnly because nothing can replace it does it remain constant through ten thousand changes, and nothing can prevail over it. This is called the Way of Perennial Victory. The Way of Perennial Victory is called softness; the Way of Perennial Defeat is called strength. These two are easy to understand, yet people do not grasp them—this is what *Laozi* meant by ‘the soft overcoming the hard, the weak overcoming the strong,’ a truth all under Heaven know but none can practice.\n\nStrength first confronts what is not its equal; softness first yields to what surpasses itself. When strength confronts what is not its equal, it becomes brittle upon meeting its match. When softness yields to what surpasses itself, it faces no peril. For those who contend against the world must encounter their adversaries, while those who are yielding, weak, and humble ride freely through the world’s utmost hardness. This is precisely the meaning.\n\nTo overcome the self as if it were another, or to govern all under Heaven as if it were another—this means that only those who follow the path of softness and weakness can truly bear such tasks. For they do not seek to conquer things but conquer themselves; they do not rely on others but rely on themselves.\n\nWhen armies clash, the side that mourns prevails—thus it is said, ‘When weapons are strong, they perish.’ A sapling of paulownia or catalpa, carpenters all know to nurture; when it grows strong, it is felled and shared—thus it is said, ‘When trees are strong, they break.’\n\nAll things bear yin and embrace yang, blending qi to achieve harmony. Yang’s virtue is to bring forth life; yin’s function is to bring stern destruction. When stern destruction prevails, the harmonious blending of qi is lost. Thus it is said, ‘The soft and weak belong to the realm of life; the hard and strong belong to the realm of death.’\n\nAppearance need not be childlike for wisdom to be childlike; wisdom need not be childlike for appearance to be childlike. The sage embraces childlike wisdom and discards childlike appearance, while the common people cling to childlike appearance and distance themselves from profound wisdom. They draw near and love those whose appearance resembles their own, and distance and fear those whose appearance differs.\n\nThough one may possess a seven-foot frame, distinct hands and feet, hair and teeth, standing and walking—this is called a human; yet humans are not without the hearts of beasts. Even with the hearts of beasts, they are loved for their appearance. Though creatures may bear wings and horns, fangs and claws, flying aloft or crouching to run—these are called birds and beasts; yet birds and beasts are not without human hearts. Even with human hearts, they are distanced for their appearance.\n\nFu Xi, Nü Wa, Shen Nong, and the Xia sovereigns had serpent bodies and human faces, ox heads and tiger noses—these bore non-human forms yet possessed the great virtue of sages. Jie of Xia, Zhou of Yin, Huan of Lu, and Mu of Chu had the seven apertures of human appearance, yet harbored the hearts of beasts. Thus, those who cling to a single appearance in pursuit of supreme wisdom will never attain it.\n\nWhen the Yellow Emperor battled the Flame Emperor at Banquan, he led bears, brown bears, wolves, leopards, boars, and tigers as his vanguard, and eagles, falcons, hawks, and kites as his banners—this was commanding beasts by force. When Yao entrusted Kui with music, striking and tapping stones, a hundred beasts danced in unison; when the *Xiao Shao* melody reached its ninth movement, the phoenix came to pay homage—this was summoning beasts by sound.\n\nIf so, how do the hearts of beasts differ from those of humans? Their forms and sounds differ from humans, yet people do not know how to connect with them. The sage, knowing all and penetrating all, thus draws them near and commands them.\n\nThe wisdom of beasts naturally aligns with humans in some ways. In their shared desires and care for life, they do not borrow wisdom from humans: males and females pair, mothers and children bond; they avoid flatlands and seek perilous heights, shun cold and pursue warmth; when dwelling, they form groups, when moving, they march in ranks; the small stay within, the strong guard without; when drinking, they lead one another, when eating, they call in flocks.\n\nIn the age of great antiquity, they dwelled with humans and walked alongside them. By the time of the Five Emperors, they began to scatter in fear. By the final age, they hid and fled to escape harm.\n\nNow, in the eastern land of Jieshi, there are those who frequently understand the speech of the six domestic animals—this is the partial knowledge they possess. The divine sages of great antiquity fully understood the dispositions of all things and could interpret the sounds of different species. Gathering and assembling them, instructing and receiving them, they made them akin to people.\n\nThus, they first harmonized with ghosts, spirits, and mountain demons, then communicated with the peoples of the eight directions, and finally gathered birds, beasts, insects, and moths. This speaks to the shared hearts and minds of all creatures with blood and qi, which are not so distant.\n\nThe divine sages, knowing this, left nothing untaught in their instruction. Earlier scholars took *tong* (childlike) to mean *same*, but *same* should be understood as the correct interpretation.\n\nIn the age of utmost virtue, all was as if without knowledge, and virtue did not depart; all was as if without desire, and this was called plain simplicity. Thus, they dwelled with birds and beasts, and their kind thrived alongside all things. Birds and beasts could be leashed and walked, and the nests of magpies and crows could be climbed to peer inside. Was this not the way of the Yellow Emperor’s campaign at Banquan and Yao’s summoning of beasts through music?\n\nGe Jielu understood the lowing of cattle. In the time of Zhou, officials were appointed to raise and teach birds and beasts, tame them, and even converse with them, fully comprehending the sounds of different species and gathering, assembling, instructing, and receiving them. Traces of this remain in later ages. *Liezi* lamented the scattering of pure simplicity, tracing the intent of the Dao and virtue, and embedding it in his writings. He sought to transform the decline of cunning and change, elevating society to a realm of pure thickness—thus his words touched upon this.\n\nIn Song there was a man called the Monkey Master who loved monkeys and raised them in troops. He understood the monkeys’ intentions, and the monkeys understood his heart. He reduced his household’s provisions to satisfy the monkeys’ desires. Soon, he faced scarcity and sought to limit their food. Fearing the monkeys would not submit, he first deceived them, saying: ‘I will give you taro—three in the morning and four in the evening. Is that enough?’ The monkeys all rose in anger. After a moment, he said: ‘I will give you taro—four in the morning and three in the evening. Is that enough?’\n\nThe monkeys all prostrated themselves in joy.\n\nAll things that are ensnared by cunning and contempt follow this same pattern. The sage ensnares the multitude of fools with wisdom, just as the Monkey Master ensnared the monkeys with his wit. Though names and realities remain unaltered, he causes them to rejoice or rage at will.\n\nThe ancients who were adept in the Way did not seek to enlighten the people but rather to keep them simple. For the people may be made to follow, but they cannot be made to understand. Thus, those skilled in the Way merely cause them to follow, returning to their constant nature. In this way, the Way may be carried and shared with them, without any display of cleverness or artifice.\n\nJi Shengzi reared fighting cocks for King Xuan of Zhou. After ten days, the king asked, “Are the cocks ready to fight?” Ji replied, “Not yet. They are still vain and reliant on their qi.” After another ten days, the king asked again. Ji said, “Not yet. They still react to shadows and movements.” After another ten days, the king inquired once more. Ji answered, “Not yet. They still glare fiercely and bristle with qi.” After another ten days, the king asked again. Ji said, “Nearly so. Though other cocks may crow, they remain unchanged. They now appear like wooden cocks—complete in virtue. No other cock dares respond; they turn and flee.”\n\nThose who excel in overcoming enemies do not contend. Precisely because they do not contend, none in the world can contend with them. To attain stillness, one must calm the qi; to attain spirit, one must follow the heart. This is called the virtue of non-contention. Such a one preserves their heavenly endowment whole, their spirit without flaw—how could external things intrude? Though they may oppose others, they are not intimidated, nor can others harm them. This is the guard of pure qi, not the realm of cleverness, artifice, or boldness. Such is the person of complete virtue.\n\nHui Ang visited King Kang of Song. The king stamped his feet, coughed, and spoke rapidly: “What delights me is courage and strength, not benevolence and righteousness. What instruction do you have for me?” Hui Ang replied, “I possess a method by which, though a man may be brave, his blade will not pierce; though he may be strong, his blows will not strike. Does Your Majesty not wish to hear of it?” The king said, “Excellent. This is what I desire to hear.”\n\nHui Ang continued, “Though his blade does not pierce and his blows do not strike, this is still a form of disgrace. I possess a method by which, though a man may be brave, he will not dare to stab; though he may be strong, he will not dare to strike. Yet this is not because he lacks the will. I possess a method by which he fundamentally lacks the will. Without such will, there is no mind for love or profit. I possess a method by which all men and women in the world joyfully desire to love and benefit one another. This surpasses courage and strength—it is the highest of the four virtues. Does Your Majesty not wish to hear of it?”\n\nThe king said, “This is what I wish to attain.”\n\nHui Ang replied, “Confucius and Mozi embodied this. Though they held no land as rulers nor offices as ministers, all men and women in the world craned their necks and stood on tiptoe, longing to be at peace and benefit under them. Now, Your Majesty is a ruler of ten thousand chariots. If you truly possess this will, all within your four borders will receive its benefit—far surpassing Confucius and Mozi.”\n\nThe king had no reply. Hui Ang hurried out. The king said to his attendants, “How persuasive! The guest has convinced me with his words.”\n\nThe sage’s approach to the world is spirit-like martiality without killing, treasuring compassion as the highest virtue. Thus, benevolence pervades the world, and none do not cherish it; righteousness pervades the world, and none do not submit to it. This is the way of constant victory, far surpassing courage and strength. This is why the world loves and benefits from it.\n\nThat Confucius and Mozi are mentioned together reflects *Zhuangzi*’s discussion of the arts of the ancients, where the Hundred Schools and various techniques each had their strengths. Though Mozi’s Way was not all-encompassing, he was still a man of talent with particular virtues.\n\n*Exegesis on the Perfect Virtue of the Primal Vacuity, Volume Three* concludes.\n*Exegesis on the Perfect Virtue of the Primal Vacuity, Volume Four* begins.\n\nEmperor Huizong of Song annotates:\n\nKing Mu of Zhou: The Dao has no true or false; things have their \"that\" and \"this.\" Like dreams and waking, confusion arises of itself—only the great sage knows how to unite them as one.\n\nIn the time of King Mu of Zhou, a \"transformed person\" arrived from the far western lands. He entered water and fire unscathed, pierced metal and stone; he reversed mountains and rivers, shifted cities and towns. Riding the void without falling, touching the solid without obstruction, his thousand transformations and ten thousand changes knew no limit. Having altered the forms of things, he also altered men’s thoughts. Does one who knows the Dao of transformation know the workings of the spirit? Unharmed by water or fire, unobstructed by metal or stone, high and low as one, void and solid both forgotten—his thousand transformations and ten thousand changes defied all bounds: this was indeed spirit. Yet spirit is that which subtly pervades the ten thousand things yet cannot be fathomed. To alter the forms of things and change men’s thoughts is merely to exhaust calculations and master change, to follow forms and shift appearances—this is why he is called a \"transformed person.\"\n\nKing Mu revered him as a spirit and served him as a lord. He offered his own bedchamber for the transformed person’s dwelling, presented the three sacrificial animals, and selected female musicians to entertain him. The transformed person deemed the king’s palaces too humble to inhabit, his banquets too rank to partake of, and his consorts too foul to embrace. Thus, the king had them rebuilt: the earthworks and timber construction, the red and white plaster, spared no craftsmanship. The five treasuries were emptied before the terrace was completed. Towering a thousand *ren*, overlooking the summit of Zhongnan, it was named the Terrace of Central Heaven. He selected the most graceful and alluring maidens from Zheng and Wei, anointed them with fragrant oils, painted their brows, adorned them with hairpins and earrings, dressed them in fine linen and trailing skirts, powdered their faces and darkened their eyes, hung jade pendants and rings upon them. He filled the halls with orchids and angelica, and performed *Steaming Clouds*, *Six Radiances*, *Nine Shao*, and *Morning Dew* to delight him. Month after month, jade robes were offered; day after day, jade delicacies were presented. Yet the transformed person remained disdainful and only reluctantly deigned to visit.\n\nWhat the world deems beautiful is called wondrous; what it reviles is called foul. Yet wondrous and foul transform into one another—how then can beauty and ugliness be distinguished? The transformed person found the king’s palaces, banquets, and consorts unacceptable and insisted on rebuilding and selecting anew before visiting. This shows he had not yet transcended the emotions of beauty and ugliness. Thus, King Mu honored him as if he were a spirit, and no more.\n\nBefore long, the transformed person invited the king to journey with him. The king grasped the transformed person’s sleeve, and together they soared upward until they reached the midst of heaven, arriving at the transformed person’s palace. This palace was constructed of gold and silver, inlaid with pearls and jade. It rose above the clouds and rain, its foundations unseen below, appearing like a mass of clouds when viewed from afar. All that the eyes beheld and ears heard, all that the nose inhaled and mouth tasted, were unlike anything in the human realm. The king truly believed it to be the Clear Capital, the Purple Tenuity, the Heaven of Equal Music, the abode of the Emperor. Looking down, he saw his own palaces and pavilions like piled clods and heaps of straw.\n\nThe king, having dwelt there for decades, no longer longed for his kingdom. The transformed person then invited him on another journey. Wherever they went, above there were no sun or moon, below no rivers or seas. The play of light and shadow dazzled the king’s eyes so he could not see; the sounds assailed his ears so he could not hear. His hundred bones and six viscera trembled and could not settle; his mind was bewildered, his essence lost. He begged the transformed person to return.\n\nTo say the king truly believed it the abode of the Emperor—the Clear Capital, the Purple Tenuity, the Heaven of Equal Music—only proves it was not. Built of gold and silver, inlaid with pearls and jade, with sights, sounds, tastes, and scents unlike anything in the human realm, the king forgot his kingdom—such was its delight. Yet where they journeyed, above there were no sun or moon, below no rivers or seas; his eyes could not see, his ears could not hear, his mind was bewildered, his essence lost, and he begged to return—such was its lack of delight. This is what it means to alter the forms of things and change men’s thoughts. The transformed person moved the king as if he were a clod of earth.\n\nUpon waking, the king found himself in the same place as before, with the same attendants. Looking ahead, the wine was still unstrained, the dishes still uneaten. When the king asked where he had been, his attendants replied, \"Your Majesty was in silent meditation.\"\n\nThereafter, King Mu was lost in thought for three months before recovering. When he questioned the transformed person again, the latter said, \"I journeyed in spirit with Your Majesty—how could your form have moved? Moreover, what difference was there between the place we dwelt and your palace? What difference between the places we roamed and your gardens?\" The king was perplexed, doubting whether it had been a fleeting absence.\n\nAt the extremes of transformation, in the space between swift and slow, can all be grasped? When the spirit’s mind is in flux, weaving through the ten thousand directions, the spirit’s journey is swift. In the space between lowering and raising the head, one may caress the lands beyond the four seas—though the body does not move, the mind travels with it.\n\nThe people of the world take what is constantly present as real and what is constantly absent as illusory. Thus, they grow accustomed to what is always there and doubt what is only briefly gone. Clinging to existence and discarding emptiness, they are blinded by partiality, unaware that both \"that\" and \"this\" are equally unreal. If the mind is enlightened to this, what difference is there between the place we dwelt and your palace? What difference between the places we roamed and your gardens?\n\nThe king was overjoyed. He neglected state affairs, took no pleasure in his ministers and consorts, and indulged in distant journeys at will.\n\nKing Mu commanded the harnessing of his eight steeds: for the right trace horse of the lead chariot, *Sigu Hua* (styled *Liuliu*); for the left, *Lü’er*; for the right wing horse, *Chiji*; and for the left, *Baijian* (styled *Yi*). *Zaofu* served as charioteer, while *Lijiong* (also pronounced *Taibing*) stood at the right. For the second chariot, the right trace horse was *Quhuang* and the left *Yulun*; the left wing horse was *Daoli* and the right *Shanzi*. *Boyao* drove the chariot, *Canbai* served as charioteer, and *Benrong* stood at the right. Racing a thousand *li*, they arrived at the land of the *Jusou* clan. The *Jusou* presented the blood of white swans for the king to drink, and offered the milk of cows and horses to wash the feet of the king and the two chariot crews.\n\nAfter drinking, they set forth and lodged at the slopes of Mount Kunlun, on the northern bank of the Red Water. The next day, they ascended the heights of Kunlun to behold the palace of the Yellow Emperor, and sealed it with earth to bequeath it to later generations. Then they paid homage to the Queen Mother of the West, feasting with her upon the Jasper Pool. The Queen Mother sang for the king, and the king harmonized with her—her song was mournful. They observed the place where the sun sets, covering ten thousand *li* in a single day. The king sighed and said: *\"Alas! I, alone, am deficient in virtue yet in harmony with pleasure. Will later generations recount my faults?\"*\n\nKing Mu was nearly a spirit-like man. Able to exhaust the joys of his own lifetime, though he lived but a hundred years, the world regarded him as having ascended to transcendence. The spirit does not hasten yet is swift; it does not travel yet arrives. King Mu did not understand that the means of entering and exiting the six directions lay within himself, yet he commanded his chariots and steeds, covering ten thousand *li* in a day. Thus, though he reached the land of the *Jusou*, ascended the heights of Kunlun, beheld the palace of the Yellow Emperor, and paid homage to the Queen Mother upon the Jasper Pool, he did not ride the clouds and mist or mount flying dragons to roam beyond the four seas. Therefore, it is said: *\"He was nearly a spirit-like man\"*—meaning he approached the spirit-like yet was not truly so.\n\n*Laochengzi* studied illusion under Master *Yinwen*. For three years, the master did not instruct him. *Laochengzi* begged to know his faults and sought to withdraw. Master *Yinwen* bowed and led him into the chamber, dismissed his attendants, and spoke to him, saying: *\"When the Old Master Laozi departed for the west, he turned to me and said: ‘The qi of the living, the forms of the shaped—all are illusion. That which begins with creation and transforms through yin and yang is called life and death. To exhaust the reckonings and comprehend the changes, to follow form and shift with ease—this is called transformation, this is called illusion. The Creator’s craft is subtle, its work profound; truly, it is difficult to fathom or exhaust. But that which follows form is craft manifest, its work shallow; thus, it arises and vanishes in an instant. Only when you know that illusion and transformation are no different from life and death can you begin to study illusion. You and I are also illusion—what need is there to learn?’\"*\n\n*Laochengzi* returned home and, reflecting deeply on Master *Yinwen*’s words for three months, was thereafter able to command life and death at will, to reverse the order of the four seasons. In winter, he summoned thunder; in summer, he conjured ice. That which flew he made walk, and that which walked he made fly.\n\nAll his life, he never revealed his arts, and so the world never transmitted them.\n\nThose who can be led may be guided to the wondrous Dao. Those who bow and enter the chamber—these are the ones who cannot be led. Take care never to instruct them. When you dismiss your attendants and speak with them alone, it is because the workings of yin and yang, the movements of the four seasons, the principles of the myriad things—all arise in an instant and vanish in a flash. Thus it is said: the qi of life, the forms of existence, are all illusion.\n\nThings take birth as their beginning and death as their end; they regard life as constant and death as change. Yet all are shrouded in the workings of the Creator and the shifts of yin and yang. Therefore it is said: that which the Creator begins and yin and yang transform is called life, is called death.\n\nHaving exhausted the reckonings of the Creator and yin and yang, and having mastered the changes of qi and form, one calls this *transformation*. Entrusting it to the reckonings of change, and further altering it according to its form, one calls this *illusion*.\n\nThe Creator is Heaven. Heaven is spirit, thus its craft is subtle and unfathomable, its work profound and inexhaustible—this is why it is difficult to plumb or complete. That which follows form is man. Man is clarity, thus his craft is manifest and swiftly accomplished, his work shallow and fleetingly undone—this is why it arises and vanishes in an instant.\n\nLife and death are indeed so, while illusion and transformation are but contrivances. From the perspective of the Dao, none are truly constant. If you know that illusion and transformation are no different from life and death, where is there anything that is not illusion?\n\nNow you and I are both illusion, yet we study illusion—this is like interpreting a dream within a dream. To speak of things that may exist or perish to one who abides freely in existence and nonexistence—we ourselves are surely real. Reversing the order of the four seasons is to command yin and yang without being commanded by them. Summoning thunder in winter and conjuring ice in summer is to govern the seasons without being governed by them. Making the flying walk and the walking fly is to drive the myriad things without being driven by them. Subtle in craft and profound in work, one thus wanders with the Creator.\n\nAll his life, he never revealed his arts, and the world never transmitted them, for they were difficult to plumb, to complete, to fathom, or to know. Thus, those who excel in studying illusion first establish constancy in nonbeing, and only then can they exhaust its depths.\n\nMaster Liezi said: \"One who is skilled in transformation keeps his Dao hidden in the ordinary, and his work appears no different from others'. The virtue of the Five Emperors and the achievements of the Three Kings were not necessarily all due to wisdom or courage; some were accomplished through transformation—who can fathom it?\n\nThe virtue of the Five Emperors and the achievements of the Three Kings—keeping the Dao hidden in the ordinary means concealing it within use. Their work appearing no different from others' means manifesting it among people. The Five Emperors are called *virtue*, the Three Kings *achievement*—these are merely the traces they trod. Their minds were never not one, yet some attribute their success to wisdom and courage, while others dare not be certain, and still others suspect it arose from transformation. Such is the unfathomable skill of those who excel in transformation. Could this be called flowing in unison with Heaven and Earth?\"\n\nThere are eight signs in waking and six phases in dreams. What are the eight signs? The first is *incident*, the second *action*, the third *gain*, the fourth *loss*, the fifth *sorrow*, the sixth *joy*, the seventh *life*, the eighth *death*. These eight signs are what form encounters.\n\nWhat are the six phases? The first is the *ordinary dream*, the second the *startling dream*, the third the *thought dream*, the fourth the *waking dream*, the fifth the *joyful dream*, the sixth the *fearful dream*. These six are what spirit intermingles with.\n\nThose who do not recognize the origin of sensory changes are perplexed by events when they arise, unaware of their cause. Those who recognize the origin of sensory changes understand the cause when events arise. Knowing the cause, there is nothing to fear.\n\nWaking engages with affairs, thus it is verified by the eight signs. Dreaming conceals principle, thus it is divined by the six phases.\n\nWhat one encounters is called *incident*; what one does is called *action*. *Gain* refers to what one acquires; *loss* to what one forfeits. Sorrow and joy burden the heart; life and death transform the self. These eight are what form discloses and can be verified—thus it is said: these eight signs are what form encounters.\n\nThe six—ordinary, startling, thought, waking, joyful, fearful—are what the soul intermingles with and can be divined—thus it is said: these six phases are what spirit intermingles with.\n\nIn dreams, the soul intermingles. In waking, form discloses. The alternation of day and night—those who do not recognize the origin of sensory changes are perplexed by events when they arise, for they do not know they are dreaming and take themselves to be awake. Those who recognize the origin of sensory changes understand the cause when events arise—this is what is meant by *great awakening* and knowing that this is the *great dream*.\n\nOne who comprehends the Dao of day and night knows that the myriad things are one, undivided—who is awake, who is dreaming? Where is there distress in transformation? The waxing and waning, the ebb and flow of the one body all correspond to Heaven and Earth and respond to the kinds of things.\n\nThus, when yin qi is strong, one dreams of wading through great waters in terror. When yang qi is strong, one dreams of traversing great fires and being scorched. When both yin and yang are strong, one dreams of life and death. When overly sated, one dreams of giving; when overly hungry, one dreams of taking.\n\nThose whose illness is floating and hollow dream of soaring; those whose illness is sunken and solid dream of drowning. Sleeping with a sash tied dreams of snakes; if a bird pecks at one’s hair, one dreams of flying. When yin is approaching, one dreams of fire; when illness is coming, one dreams of eating. Those who drink wine grieve; those who sing and dance weep.\n\nMaster Liezi said: \"Spirit encounters make dreams; form encounters make affairs. Thus, daytime thoughts become nighttime dreams—these are what spirit and form encounter. Therefore, when spirit is concentrated, thoughts and dreams dissolve of themselves. Trusting in waking, one does not speak; trusting in dreams, one does not comprehend—these are the comings and goings of the transformation of things.\"\n\nThe true person of old forgot himself in waking and did not dream in sleep—how could this be empty words?\n\nThe world is but a single qi. Thus do fullness and emptiness, growth and decline all communicate with heaven and earth and respond to the kinds of things. When yin qi is strong, one dreams of great waters and feels terror; when yang qi is strong, one dreams of great fires and burning scorching. When both yin and yang are strong and harmonious, one may dream of life; when both are strong yet discordant, one may dream of killing. Those whose illness is floating and hollow dream of soaring; those whose illness is sunken and solid dream of drowning—this is the principle of fullness and emptiness. Extreme satiety dreams of giving; extreme hunger dreams of taking; approaching yin dreams of fire; approaching illness dreams of eating—this is the principle of growth and decline. Sleeping with a sash tied, one dreams of snakes; if a bird pecks at one’s hair, one dreams of flying—this follows their kind. Those who drink wine grieve; those who sing and dance weep—this reverses their kind. For what the form encounters persists in waking, thus what the spirit encounters arises in dreaming. All that spirit and form meet are but the self-so of fullness and emptiness, growth and decline.\n\nAs for one who darkly unites with the One Real and ever moves with the Dao, dreaming and waking become one, reality and illusion both forgotten—this is called the true person. At the southwest corner of the farthest west lies a land, its borders unknown, named the Country of Ancient Wilderness. Yin and yang qi do not mingle there, so cold and heat cannot be distinguished; the light of sun and moon does not reach it, so day and night cannot be distinguished.\n\nThe people there neither eat nor wear clothing but sleep often, waking once every fifty days. What they do in dreams they take as real, and what they see when awake they deem illusory.\n\nThe land equidistant from the Four Seas is called the Central Kingdom, spanning north and south of the river, east and west of Mount Tai, over ten thousand *li* in extent. Its yin and yang are precisely measured, thus one cold and one hot season; its divisions of dusk and dawn are clearly marked, thus one day and one night. The people there possess both wisdom and folly, and the myriad things flourish in abundance, their skills and arts manifold. There are rulers and subjects in mutual governance, rites and laws in mutual support. Their deeds and undertakings are beyond reckoning. They alternate between waking and sleeping, taking what they do when awake as real and what they see in dreams as illusory.\n\nAt the northeast corner lies a land called the Country of Flourishing Descent. Its earthly *qi* is perpetually warm, and though the lingering light of sun and moon shines upon it, its soil yields no fine crops. The people eat grass roots and tree fruits, knowing nothing of cooked food. Their nature is fierce and unyielding, the strong oppressing the weak, prizing victory and scorning righteousness. They run swiftly and seldom rest, ever awake and never sleeping.\n\nYang is movement and brightness; yin is stillness and obscurity. The southwest is inclined toward yin, so its people incline toward obscurity, still and given to much sleep. The northeast is inclined toward yang, so its people incline toward brightness, active and given to much waking. The Central Kingdom is where heaven and earth unite, where the four seasons converge, where wind and rain gather, where yin and yang harmonize. Why should it move in brightness or rest in obscurity? When movement and stillness do not miss their proper time, waking and dreaming dissolve into reality and illusion. Who but one who embodies the true and constant and excels in transformation could attain this?\n\nThe steward Yin of Zhou greatly expanded his estate. Those under his employ toiled from dawn till dusk without rest. An old laborer, his strength exhausted, was driven to even greater exertion. By day he groaned as he worked, and by night he sank into deep slumber. His spirit scattered and waned, and once he dreamed he was a lord. He dwelled above the people, presiding over the affairs of the state; he roamed and feasted in palaces, indulging every desire, his joy unmatched. When he awoke, he returned to servitude. Someone sought to console him for his toil, but the laborer said: \"A human life spans a hundred years, divided equally between day and night. By day I am a slave, and though it is bitter, it is bitter indeed; by night I am a lord, and my joy is unmatched. What cause have I for resentment?\"\n\nThe steward Yin was consumed by worldly affairs, his thoughts fixed on his family’s wealth. Both mind and body were wearied, and by night he too sank into deep slumber. Once he dreamed he was a servant, running errands and performing every task; he endured countless scoldings and beatings, and in his sleep he muttered and groaned until dawn. Distressed, Yin sought counsel from a friend. The friend said: \"Your position brings honor to your person, and your wealth exceeds that of others—you surpass most men by far. Yet by night you dream of being a servant, and thus the alternation of suffering and ease follows the common course. If you wish to combine both waking and dreaming, how could that be possible?\"\n\nUpon hearing his friend’s words, Yin eased the laborers’ tasks and reduced his own burdensome thoughts. His illness gradually abated.\n\nOne yin, one yang—when harmonious and balanced, this is the form bestowed by heaven. When form loses its balance, it becomes biased and gives rise to illness. Some suffer by day and find joy by night; others find ease by day and toil by night. This reversal is the inevitable principle of beginning and end. By easing the laborers’ tasks and reducing his own burdensome thoughts, each attained their proper balance, and thus his illness gradually abated.\n\nYet all things are of one kind—who is awake and who is dreaming? When dreaming, one does not know it is a dream; only upon waking does one realize it was a dream. The foolish believe themselves awake. There must be a great awakening before one knows this to be the great dream. Are lords and herdsmen truly so? How rigid!\n\nA man of Zheng was gathering firewood in the wild when he encountered a startled deer. He chased and struck it down, then killed it. Fearing others would see, he hastily hid it in a ditch, covering it with reeds, his joy overwhelming. Soon after, he forgot where he had hidden it and took the whole affair to be a dream. As he walked along, he recounted the tale. A passerby heard him, followed his words, and took the deer. Upon returning home, he told his wife: \"A woodcutter dreamed he had caught a deer but forgot where he hid it. Now I have found it—he was truly the dreamer.\" His wife said: \"Is it not you who dreamed of the woodcutter catching the deer? Could there really have been a woodcutter? Now that you truly have the deer, is your dream real?\" The man replied: \"I have the deer in hand—why trouble myself over whether he dreamed or I dreamed?\"\n\nThe woodcutter returned home, dissatisfied at losing the deer. That night, he truly dreamed of where he had hidden it and also dreamed of the one who had taken it. At dawn, he followed his dream and found the man. They took their dispute to court, and the magistrate said: \"At first you truly caught the deer but mistakenly called it a dream; now you truly dreamed of the deer but mistakenly call it real. He truly took your deer, and now you dispute it with him. Your wife also said that both dreamed of another’s deer, so no one truly has the deer. Now that this deer is in hand, let us divide it in two.\"\n\nHe reported this to the lord of Zheng, who exclaimed: \"Ah! Is the magistrate about to dream of dividing another’s deer?\" He consulted his minister, who said: \"Whether dreaming or not, I cannot discern. To distinguish waking from dreaming, only the Yellow Emperor or Confucius could do so. Now that they are gone, who can settle this? Let us simply follow the magistrate’s judgment.\"\n\nFrom the perspective of the Dao, who is awake and who is dreaming? Right and wrong are of one *qi*. Is there truly a distinction? With the descent into forms and names, truth and falsehood arise. Thus, truly catching a deer is mistaken for a dream, and truly dreaming of a deer is mistaken for reality. The paths of right and wrong are tangled and confused—how can one know their distinction? Even the Yellow Emperor and Confucius, who merged truth and illusion, could there truly be a \"this\" and \"that\"?\n\nThe magistrate’s judgment sought to distinguish truth from illusion—yet could there truly be no \"this\" and \"that\"? Since even seeking verification from the Yellow Emperor or Confucius proved futile, one could only follow the magistrate’s words.\n\nIn the village of Yang in Song, a man named Hua Zi suffered from forgetfulness in middle age. What he took in the morning he forgot by evening; what he gave at dusk he forgot by dawn. On the road, he forgot to walk; at home, he forgot to sit. He could not recognize the past, nor recall the present. His entire household was distressed. They exhausted the records of diviners, but no hexagram revealed an answer; they consulted shamans and prayed, but no spell could restrain it; they sought physicians and attacked the illness with medicine, but it would not cease.\n\nA scholar from Lu offered his services, claiming he could cure Hua Zi. Hua Zi’s wife and children offered half their property in exchange for his method. The scholar said: \"This is not a matter for divination or prayer, nor can it be cured by acupuncture or herbs. Let me attempt to transform his heart and alter his thoughts—perhaps then he may recover.\" Thereupon, he exposed Hua Zi to the elements until he sought clothing; starved him until he craved food; confined him in darkness until he longed for light. The scholar joyfully told Hua Zi’s son: \"The illness can be cured. However, my method is secret and not to be passed down. Remove all attendants and leave me alone with him for seven days.\" They complied, unaware of what he did. Yet after years of affliction, the illness vanished in a single morning.\n\nWhen Hua Zi awoke, he flew into a rage, cast out his wife, punished his children, and brandished a spear to chase away the scholar. The people of Song seized him and demanded an explanation. Hua Zi said: \"Before, I was forgetful—adrift, unaware of the very existence of heaven and earth. Now, suddenly recalling the past, the myriad threads of existence and loss, joy and sorrow, love and hate from decades past surge forth. I fear that the future’s entanglements of existence and loss, joy and sorrow, love and hate will disturb my heart like this. Can I ever regain even a moment’s forgetfulness?\"\n\nZi Gong heard of this and found it strange. He reported it to Confucius, who said: \"This is beyond your understanding.\" Turning to Yan Hui, he instructed him to remember it. To know forgetfulness is to harmonize the heart’s judgments. To cast off the limbs and depart from form, to renounce cleverness and abandon knowledge—when the celestial mechanism lies dormant, one merges silently with the Dao, dimly present yet as if absent from the world. How could one perceive it? The common people are bright and clear; I alone am as if benighted. To scorn worldly success and feel shame at engaging with the roots of affairs, yet to comprehend the divine—this is why the sage remains free from illness. The world, not understanding, calls it an affliction, thus labeling Hua Zi’s forgetfulness as a disease. Yet by transforming his heart and altering his thoughts, making the tangled threads of existence and loss, joy and sorrow, love and hate arise to burden his form, the scholar’s so-called cure only disturbed his heart. Such a method opens the mind yet harms life—this is why Confucius did not explain it to Zi Gong. But he instructed Yan Hui to record it, for he was capable of *zuowang* (sitting in forgetfulness).\n\nIn Qin, the Feng family had a son who was clever in youth but developed a bewildering illness in adulthood. He heard singing and mistook it for weeping; saw white and took it for black; smelled fragrance and thought it rotten; tasted sweetness and found it bitter; deemed wrong as right. Whatever his mind turned to—heaven and earth, the four directions, water and fire, cold and heat—all were inverted. The Yang family told his father: \"The gentlemen of Lu possess many arts—perhaps they can cure him? Why not seek their help?\"\n\nHis father traveled to Lu but passed through Chen, where he encountered Lao Dan. He described his son’s condition. Lao Dan said: \"How do you know your son is deluded? Today, all under heaven are confused by right and wrong, blinded by profit and harm. Those with the same affliction are many, yet none awaken. Moreover, one person’s delusion cannot overturn a household; one household’s delusion cannot overturn a village; one village’s delusion cannot overturn a state; one state’s delusion cannot overturn the world. If all under heaven were deluded, who could overturn it? If all people’s hearts were like your son’s, you would be the deluded one. Joy and sorrow, sound and color, scent and taste, right and wrong—who can correct them? Furthermore, my own trivial knowledge may itself be delusion—how much more so the gentlemen of Lu, mere couriers of delusion? How could they resolve another’s confusion? Take your provisions and return home swiftly.\"\n\nThe manifestation of right and wrong is the diminishment of the Dao. That has its right and wrong, this has its right and wrong—thus, singing and weeping, black and white, fragrance and rot, sweet and bitter, even within the four seas, each person affirms what they affirm and denies what they deny. Whom could one appoint to set it right? The people’s delusion has endured for ages. Those who whisper of knowing call others deluded—how could I discern the distinction? This is why Laozi asked his father: \"How do you know your son is deluded?\" And also said: \"Joy and sorrow, sound and color, scent and taste, right and wrong—who can correct them?\"\n\nThe loss of the Dark Pearl was retrieved by *Xiangwang*—how could the illness of bewilderment be understood by the world? A man of Yan was born in Yan and raised in Chu. In old age, he returned to his homeland but passed through Jin. His traveling companions deceived him, pointing to a city and saying: \"This is the city of Yan.\" His expression changed sorrowfully. They pointed to a shrine and said...\n\nThe shrine of your native village.\" At this, he sighed deeply. They pointed to a house and said: \"This is your ancestors’ dwelling.\" He wept silently. They pointed to a mound and said: \"This is your ancestors’ grave.\" The man could not restrain his sobs. His companions burst into laughter, saying: \"We were only jesting with you—this is but the land of Jin.\" The man was overcome with shame. When he finally reached Yan and truly beheld the city and shrines of his homeland, truly saw his ancestors’ dwelling and grave, his sorrow was but faint. For when emotion reaches its peak, joy and sorrow pass, and all that once moved him now stirs no delight or grief.\n\n*The Explication of the Perfect Virtue of the Primal and Void*, Scroll Four ends.\n*The Explication of the Perfect Virtue of the Primal and Void*, Scroll Five\nBy Emperor Huizong of Song\n\nConfucius said: \"When acted upon, it is full; when left alone, it is empty. By observing subtleties in tandem, being and non-being are not opposed. Nothing is not forgotten, yet nothing is not present. Serene and boundless, this is called accord with principle.\"\n\nConfucius was at leisure in his chamber when Zigong entered to attend him, his countenance troubled. The sage concealed himself in mystery, thus his heart knew no joy or sorrow, no fortune or misfortune. Yet he shared the people’s afflictions, and so felt concern. Zigong dared not ask and went out to tell Yan Hui. Yan Hui took up his zither and sang. Confucius heard it and summoned Yan Hui in, asking: \"Why do you alone rejoice?\" Yan Hui replied: \"Why does the Master alone grieve?\" Confucius said: \"First speak your mind.\" Yan Hui said: \"I once heard the Master say: 'Rejoice in Heaven and know fate, thus one has no sorrow.' This is why I rejoice. Rejoicing in Heaven means blaming no one; knowing fate means not prizing force. Following nature without burdening the heart—what sorrow can there be?\" Confucius, his expression grave, asked: \"Did I truly say such a thing? You have misunderstood. Those were my words of old. Let my words of today be taken as correct. Where does the Dao not go and yet not abide? Where does speech abide and yet not suffice? Adapting to the moment is called rightness; embodying the constancy of the Dao is called correctness. Thus, my words of old may be deemed right, but from today’s vantage, they cannot be called correct. Yet if the words of old are right and today’s words are correct, what is spoken remains unsettled. Knowing that time has no fixed standard for the present, how can those bound by doctrine grasp this? You merely know that rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate bring no sorrow, but you do not know the great sorrow of rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate. True joy is no joy, yet nothing is not joy; true knowledge is no knowledge, yet nothing is not known. Cultivate it in the self, and there is no sorrow; cultivate it in the world, and there is great sorrow. Now I tell you the truth: Cultivating the self, accepting poverty and success, knowing that going and coming are not of the self, and stilling disorder in the heart and thoughts—this is what you call rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate without sorrow. The ancients who understood the Dao knew that action and stillness were not within human power but lay with Heaven, that rise and fall were not brought about by force but by fate. They neither gloried in success nor shamed poverty, but followed the time as it came. Following and departing in accord with the time, dwelling in peace and compliance, joy and sorrow could not enter—what sorrow could there be? Yet this pertains only to cultivating the self. Formerly, I cultivated the *Book of Songs* and the *Book of Documents*, rectified rites and music, intending to govern the world and leave a legacy for future generations—not merely to cultivate myself or govern the state of Lu. Yet the rulers and ministers of Lu daily lost their proper order, benevolence and righteousness further declined, and human nature and feeling grew ever more shallow. If the Dao does not prevail in one state or one generation, what will become of the world and future ages? I first realized that the *Book of Songs*, the *Book of Documents*, rites, and music could not save the world from disorder, yet I did not know the means to reform them—this is the sorrow of one who rejoices in Heaven and knows fate. The *Book of Songs* and the *Book of Documents* record the words of governance; rites and music are the instruments of governance. Confucius embodied the truth of the Dao to cultivate himself, transcending form, color, fame, and reputation, yet he pitied the world’s ills. Thus, he spoke of benevolence and righteousness, clarified rites and music, and employed every means to console the hearts of the world. Yet people of the age extinguished their essence and drowned their minds, unable to return to their nature and feelings and restore their original state. Thus, benevolence and righteousness further declined, and human nature and feeling grew ever more shallow. The Dao did not prevail in his own time—how could he not be concerned for the world and future generations? Nevertheless, I have grasped it now. The joy and knowledge of one who rejoices and knows are not what the ancients meant by joy and knowledge. Without joy, without knowledge—this is true joy, true knowledge. Thus, there is nothing not joyful, nothing not known, nothing not sorrowful, nothing not done. What need is there to discard the *Book of Songs*, the *Book of Documents*, rites, and music? Why reform them?\" Yan Hui bowed to the north and said: \"I, too, have grasped it.\" He went out and told Zigong. Zigong was bewildered, lost in thought, and returned home to ponder for seven days without sleep or food, until his bones stood out. Yan Hui went again to explain, and only then did Zigong return to Confucius’ gate, strumming the zither and chanting the books, which he did unceasingly for the rest of his life. If the Dao and virtue are not abandoned, what need is there for benevolence and righteousness? If nature and feeling are not lost, what use are rites and music?\n\nOne who delights in Heaven delights in something—this is not what the ancients called delight. One who knows fate knows something—this is not what the ancients called knowledge. One who delights in Heaven must ultimately arrive at having nothing to delight in—this is called true delight. One who knows fate must ultimately arrive at knowing nothing—this is called true knowledge. If this is so, then there is nothing not delightful, nothing not known, nothing not sorrowful, nothing not done, and one becomes a person in harmony with transformation. If, in going forth, one cannot transform others, then governing through the *Book of Songs*, the *Book of Documents*, rites, and music may suffice. Retreating from benevolence and righteousness, honoring rites and music, may also suffice.\n\nThus, in the beginning, the *Book of Songs*, the *Book of Documents*, rites, and music could not save the world from disorder. Yet once one has attained the Way, one says: \"What need is there to discard the *Book of Songs*, the *Book of Documents*, rites, and music? Why reform them?\" Before, Zigong dared not ask, but upon hearing this, he was bewildered and lost in thought, finding nothing to grasp—he could only chant the books without ceasing. Was this not what is called \"grasping the words but not their meaning\"?\n\nA minister of Chen, on a diplomatic mission to Lu, privately visited the house of Shusun. Shusun said: \"Our state has a sage.\" The minister asked: \"Is it not Kong Qiu?\" Shusun replied: \"It is.\" \"How do you know he is a sage?\" Shusun said: \"I once heard Yan Hui say: 'Kong Qiu can set aside the mind and employ the body.'\" The minister of Chen said: \"Our state also has a sage—do you not know?\" \"Who is this sage?\" \"Among the disciples of Lao Dan, there is one named Kang Cangzi who has mastered the Way of the guest. He can see with his ears and hear with his eyes.\"\n\nConfucius responds to things by forgetting the mind, so those who see his sagacity believe he can set aside the mind and employ the body. Kang Cangzi adapts to the self and directs the body, so those who see his sagacity believe he can see with his ears and hear with his eyes. Setting aside the mind and employing the body is like a well-sweep moving up and down—what pulls the person also pulls others. Seeing with the ears and hearing with the eyes is akin to Liezi’s mind congealing and form dissolving, bones and flesh completely merging. Yet what is set aside, and what is employed? The Way of the sage is without seeing and without hearing—how can birds be questioned about it? This is merely what people perceive.\n\nThe Duke of Lu, hearing this, was greatly astonished and sent his highest minister with rich gifts to invite Kang Cangzi. Kang Cangzi accepted the invitation and arrived. The Duke of Lu, speaking humbly, sought his instruction. Kang Cangzi said: \"Those who transmitted this spoke falsely. I can see and hear without using ears and eyes, but I cannot alter the function of ears and eyes.\" The Duke of Lu said: \"This is even more extraordinary—what is your Way?\" \"I wish to hear it to the end.\" Kang Cangzi said: \"My body harmonizes with the mind, the mind harmonizes with qi, qi harmonizes with spirit, and spirit harmonizes with the primordial. When there is the presence of the subtle, the resonance of the unique tone—whether far away at the eight wilds’ edge or near at the space between the brows—whatever comes to disturb me, I must know it. Yet I do not know whether this is perceived by my seven orifices and four limbs or known by my heart, belly, and six viscera—it is simply self-knowing.\"\n\nThe Duke of Lu was overjoyed. Another day, he told Confucius, who smiled but did not answer. Seeing with the ears and hearing with the eyes still cannot transcend form. To see and hear without using ears and eyes is to detach them from form. For ears and eyes to see and hear is not yet to leave form—there is still something they cannot reach. But when ears and eyes are not used, form fills emptiness. One sees in darkness, hears in silence, and unites with spirit—how could the world recognize this?\n\nWhen the body harmonizes with the mind, one advances inward from without. When the mind harmonizes with qi, one attains emptiness from fullness. When qi harmonizes with spirit, one stands in the unfathomable. When spirit harmonizes with the primordial, one moves without direction. Not listening with the ears but listening with qi, I encounter with spirit rather than seeing with the eyes—this is what is called \"entering the seamless with nothingness.\"\n\nThe presence of the subtle is the smallness of form; the resonance of the unique tone is the faintness of sound. Whether far away at the eight wilds’ edge or near at the space between the brows, it is not nothingness—yet confined by form, moved by sound, though I reject cleverness and understanding to merge with the great penetration, whatever comes to disturb me, I must know it. How could I know why it is so? Thus, it is simply self-knowing.\n\nConfucius smiled but did not answer—his smile dissolved the question, and he had no answer. The Grand Steward of Shang visited Confucius and said: \"Is Qiu a sage?\" Confucius replied: \"How would Qiu dare claim sagacity? Yet Qiu is broadly learned and deeply knowledgeable.\" The Grand Steward said: \"Since you are a sage, why say you dare not claim sagacity?\" Confucius did not presume to occupy the position of a sage. Though broadly learned, he had no single accomplishment to his name; though widely knowledgeable, he unified all with one thread—this is why Confucius is called the culmination of greatness.\n\nThe Grand Steward of Shang asked: \"Were the Three Kings sages?\" Confucius said: \"The Three Kings were good at employing wisdom and courage—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.\" \"Were the Five Emperors sages?\" Confucius said: \"The Five Emperors were good at employing benevolence and righteousness—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.\" \"Were the Three Sovereigns sages?\" Confucius said: \"The Three Sovereigns were good at employing what suited the times—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.\"\n\nThe Sovereigns spoke of the Dao, the Emperors of virtue, and the Kings of achievement. Being good at employing what suited the times is how they practiced the Dao; being good at employing benevolence and righteousness is how they perfected virtue; being good at employing wisdom and courage is how they cultivated achievement. Yet these are the burdens of action, not the affairs of non-action—thus, Qiu says he does not know whether they were sages.\n\nNevertheless, the Sovereigns, Emperors, and Kings responded to their times and created what they employed—these are their traces. What underlies their traces is what makes them sages. The Grand Steward of Shang was greatly startled and said: \"Then who is a sage?\" Confucius, his expression changing, paused, and said: \"Among the people of the West, there is a sage who governs without disorder, speaks without needing trust, transforms without teaching, and is so vast that the people cannot name him.\"\n\nI suspect he may be a sage, yet I do not know whether he is truly a sage—or truly not a sage.\n\nThe Grand Steward of Shang fell silent, pondering in his heart: \"Is Confucius deceiving me?\"\n\nZhuangzi, in his discourse on Suiren, Fuxi, Shennong, the Yellow Emperor, and the rulers since Yao and Shun, held that their governance of the world marked the decline of virtue. Confucius, who deemed the rule of the Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, and Three Kings as not truly sagely, now speaks of a sage in the West—this must be the Dao’s unfolding through time. The sage is of the moment: the governance of the Five Emperors and Three Kings, gathering the multitudes at the flourishing assembly, was like spring and summer in the seasons—revealing only their outward kingly achievements, hence he said, \"I do not know whether they were sages.\" The people of the West, having shed refinement to return to simplicity, are like autumn and winter in the seasons—tranquil and sagely in stillness, hence he said, \"There is a sage there.\"\n\nOnly when there is disorder does one govern; without the need to govern, what disorder could there be? Thus, he governs without governing and there is no disorder. One who requires words to be trusted lacks sufficient trust; when understanding comes in silence, there is no need for speech to be believed. The workings of the Dao’s transformation leave traces of their enactment; when transformation leaves no trace, who could impose their will upon it? Thus, it transforms without transforming—this is the meaning. Nothing is done, yet it is always naturally so.\n\nThe Dao cannot be named, for it has no boundaries; thus, he said, \"So vast that the people cannot name him.\" Yet the sage remains unknowable—calling him a sage, how can one be certain it is true? One can only suspect he may be a sage.\n\nThe Grand Steward of Shang, finding Confucius’ words contrary to human nature, was at first startled and alarmed, seeking to measure them by conventional standards but finding no answer. Thus, in the end, he fell silent, pondering in his heart, and concluded that Confucius had deceived him.\n\nZixia asked Confucius, \"What sort of man is Yan Hui?\"\nThe Master said, \"Hui’s benevolence surpasses my own.\"\nZixia asked, \"What sort of man is Zigong?\"\nThe Master said, \"Ci’s eloquence surpasses my own.\"\nZixia asked, \"What sort of man is Zilu?\"\nThe Master said, \"You’s courage surpasses my own.\"\nZixia asked, \"What sort of man is Zizhang?\"\nThe Master said, \"Shi’s dignity surpasses my own.\"\n\nZixia rose from his mat and asked, \"Then why do these four serve you?\"\nThe Master said, \"Sit. I will tell you.\"\n\nHui excels in benevolence but cannot return to simplicity; Ci excels in eloquence but cannot be reticent; You excels in courage but cannot be timid; Shi excels in dignity but cannot blend in. Even if I could exchange my qualities for all that these four possess, I would not consent. This is why they serve me without divided loyalty.\n\nThe Way of the sage is supremely lofty and luminous, yet it abides in the mean. Whether one exceeds it or falls short, neither is the Way. The worthy may surpass it, but the sage takes nothing from them. Hui excels in benevolence but cannot return to simplicity—this is not perfect benevolence. Ci excels in eloquence but cannot be reticent—this is not true eloquence. You excels in courage but cannot be timid—this is not perfect courage. Shi excels in dignity but cannot blend in—this is not harmonious illumination. Though they do not encompass all things or reach everywhere, each has a single aspect of the Way. Yet each has its strengths and its uses in due time. As for the Master’s great completeness, he embodies the Way in its entirety and possesses all its virtues.\n\nThose several disciples, gazing up at the sage, recognize their own limitations. Thus, though Confucius deems each of them superior to himself in their particular strengths, how could they ever waver in their service to him?\n\nLiezi first studied under Master Hushu Zi Lin and befriended Bohun Maoren, then took up residence in Nanguo. Those who followed him gathered daily in great numbers. Yet Liezi himself remained unassuming, engaging in debate with them morning after morning, leaving nothing unheard. Though he and Master Nanguo shared a wall for twenty years, they never paid formal visits to one another. When they met on the road, their eyes seemed not to see each other, and the servants at Liezi’s gate took it for granted that the two masters were rivals.\n\nA man from Chu came and asked Liezi, “Why do you and Master Nanguo oppose each other?”\nLiezi replied, “Master Nanguo’s appearance is full, yet his mind is empty; his ears hear nothing, his eyes see nothing, his mouth speaks nothing, his mind knows nothing, and his form shows no agitation. What could I possibly do with him? Nevertheless, I will go with you to see him.”\n\nLiezi set out with forty disciples. When they saw Master Nanguo, he indeed appeared like a disembodied spirit, impossible to engage. Looking back at Liezi, his form and spirit were mismatched, impossible to join. Then Master Nanguo suddenly pointed to one of Liezi’s disciples in the rear rank and spoke to him, cheerful and forthright, as if he were the only one present.\n\nLiezi’s followers were astonished. On returning home, all wore expressions of doubt.\nLiezi said: “Those who have attained their aim speak not; those who advance in knowledge also speak not. To use non-speech as speech is still speech; to use non-knowing as knowing is still knowing. Non-speech and not-speaking, non-knowing and not-knowing—these are also speech and knowing. They encompass all speech and all knowing, yet also no speech and no knowing. It is only thus. Why should you be so needlessly astonished?”\n\nThe days passed in great number, yet none could reach him—this speaks to how many came together, yet the Master remained beyond reach. Even Liezi was but faint in this regard, for Liezi’s Dao could not be seen. Day after day, they debated without cease, yet nothing went unheard. But the Dao cannot be heard; to hear it is to miss it. When debate arises from necessity, what is heard is but shallow. For twenty years, though their walls adjoined, they paid no visits—this aligns with what Laozi called \"no mutual coming and going.\" When they met upon the Way, their eyes seemed not to see each other, yet the Dao was ever-present without need of gaze. The hundred bones and nine orifices were all intact—this is what is meant by \"form fully filled.\" Hollow and empty, unseen when looked upon—this is what is meant by \"heart void.\" Possessing human form, ears, eyes, mouth, and features were all complete. Lacking human sentiment, there was no hearing, no seeing, no speech, no knowing, no fear—its chamber was empty. Though the spirit seemed present, the form was not true—it was but an image of a person. \"Form and spirit mismatched\" means the spirit does not abide in the form. \"Cheerful and forthright, as if alone and self-assured\" means failing to know the masculine yet clinging to the feminine. Given Liezi’s Dao, even Nanguo saw him thus—no wonder his disciples were astonished and all bore expressions of doubt.\n\nSpeech is the means by which the Dao is transmitted. Speech exists for the sake of meaning; grasp the meaning and forget the words—thus it is said, \"Those who have attained their aim speak not.\" What can be discussed in words is but the coarse aspect of things, ignorant of what lies within. Thus it is said, \"Those who advance in knowledge also speak not.\" To use non-speech as speech is still speech—this is the ultimate speech. To use non-knowing as knowing is still knowing—this is the ultimate knowing. When my non-speech aligns with the Dao’s non-speech, when my non-knowing aligns with the Dao’s non-knowing, from the perspective of those who have attained their aim and those who advance in knowledge, this is also speech, this is also knowing. The Dao does not extend beyond this—why needless astonishment?\n\nLiezi was a student. After three years, his heart dared not ponder right and wrong, his mouth dared not speak of profit and harm—only then did Old Shang grant him a single glance. After five years, his heart again pondered right and wrong, his mouth again spoke of profit and harm—only then did Old Shang begin to relax his countenance and smile. After seven years, his heart followed its thoughts without right or wrong; his mouth spoke without profit or harm. Only then did the Master draw him near to share his mat. After nine years, his heart roamed freely in thought, his mouth spoke freely in words, yet he knew not whether his own right and wrong, profit and harm existed, nor whether others’ right and wrong, profit and harm existed—inner and outer had advanced. Thereafter, his eyes were as ears, his ears as nose, his nose as mouth—all were the same. His heart congealed, his form dissolved, bones and flesh wholly merged. He no longer sensed where his body leaned, where his feet trod, what his heart pondered, or what his words concealed. Thus it was. Then no principle remained hidden.\n\nThe first glance signified the Dao’s presence in the meeting of eyes; the smile signified the heart’s attainment beyond form’s release; drawing him near to share the mat signified advancement to union with him. When inner and outer had advanced, it was wondrous and unfathomable. Form filled yet empty, heart congealed and form released, bones and flesh wholly merged—having reached the utmost of form, no principle remained hidden.\n\nInitially, Liezi delighted in wandering. Master Huqiu asked: \"Youkuo delights in wandering—what does he delight in through wandering?\" Liezi replied: \"The joy of wandering lies in the play of things without fixed nature.\" Others wander to observe what they see; I wander to observe what transforms. Wandering thus—who could discern its nature? Master Huqiu said: \"Is Youkuo’s wandering truly the same as others’, or is it truly different? All that is seen is but the constant sight of change. To play with the unfixed nature of things is to not know that I, too, am without fixed nature. To focus on external wandering is to not know the focus of inner observation. Those who wander externally seek completion in things; those who observe inwardly find sufficiency in themselves. Finding sufficiency in oneself—this is the utmost of wandering; seeking completion in things—this is the failure of wandering.\"\n\nThereafter, Liezi never left his home, believing himself ignorant of wandering. What he played with was without fixed nature—thus it was ever new. Others wander to observe only appearances, sounds, and forms. I wander to observe the transformations of growth and decline, fullness and emptiness. None could discern the nature of his wandering—this speaks to how the difference between the two remained unknown. Yet those who see through nature, in what they see, also constantly see change. Thus it is said: \"All that is seen is but the constant sight of change.\" To follow others is to see only their unfixed nature. To turn outward inward is to find within what is ever new. Thus it is said: \"To play with the unfixed nature of things is to not know that I, too, am without fixed nature.\" Those who focus on external wandering age with things, seeing things but not nature; those who observe inwardly turn to themselves in sincerity, seeing nature but not things. Chasing echoes for sound—this is akin to seeking completion in things. Dwelling in shade to rest the shadow—this is akin to finding sufficiency in oneself. Thus, the utmost of wandering and its failure are distinguished only by inner and outer. Liezi never left his home—this is what is meant by \"turning to seek within oneself.\"\n\nMaster Huqiu said: \"Is this the utmost of wandering? The utmost of wandering knows not where it goes; the utmost of observation knows not where it rests. All things wander, all things observe—this is what I call wandering, this is what I call observation. Thus it is said: *Is this the utmost of wandering? Is this the utmost of wandering?* The utmost of wandering moves by nature; the utmost of observation sees by nature.\"\n\nWhere there is destination, there is limit—how could nature have limit? Thus, the utmost of wandering knows not where it goes. Where there is sight, there is obstruction—how could nature have obstruction? Thus, the utmost of observation knows not where it rests. Wandering without bound yet truly without wandering, observing without bound yet truly without observing—above, one wanders with the Creator of Things. Such is all.\n\nThus it is said: *Is this the utmost of wandering?*\n\n*End of Chapter Five of the* Exegesis on the *True Scripture of Perfect Virtue in Emptiness*\n*Chapter Six of the* Exegesis on the *True Scripture of Perfect Virtue in Emptiness*\n*By Emperor Huizong of Song*\n\n**Confucius Descends**\n\nLongshu said to Wenzhi: \"Your art is subtle. I have an affliction—can you cure it?\"\nWenzhi replied: \"I await your command. But first, tell me the symptoms of your ailment.\"\nLongshu said: \"Praise from my village brings me no honor; slander from the state brings me no shame. Gain does not delight me; loss does not grieve me. I regard life as death, wealth as poverty, others as swine, and myself as one among them. Dwelling in my home, I see it as an inn for travelers; gazing at my village, I see it as a land of barbarians. All these afflictions—titles and rewards cannot sway me, punishments and penalties cannot intimidate me, prosperity and decline, advantage and harm cannot alter me, sorrow and joy cannot move me. Thus, I cannot serve a lord, befriend kin, govern a wife and children, or command servants. What is this affliction? What method can cure it?\"\n\nWenzhi then commanded Longshu to stand with his back to the light. Wenzhi himself faced the light and observed him from behind. After a moment, he said: \"Ah! Now I see your heart. The space of a square inch is empty—you are nearly a sage. Your heart has six apertures flowing freely, yet one remains obstructed. Is it not those who take sagely wisdom as their affliction who suffer from this? This is beyond the reach of my shallow art. Your method is subtle—by this, I mean its profound subtlety.\n\nWhat Longshu described as his affliction, Wenzhi called his ailment, for he sought only to understand the origin of his condition. Praise and slander cannot bring him honor or shame; gain and loss cannot move him to joy or sorrow; life and death cannot alter his heart; wealth and poverty cannot burden his form. Seeing others as swine, he forgets humanity’s superiority over things; seeing himself as one among them, he forgets his own distinction from others. Dwelling in his home as if it were a traveler’s inn, he does not linger; gazing at his village as if it were a land of barbarians, he does not choose his place. All these afflictions—titles and rewards cannot sway him, punishments and penalties cannot intimidate him—thus he does not submit to others. Prosperity and decline, advantage and harm cannot alter him; sorrow and joy cannot move him—thus he is not enslaved by things. Looking up, he cannot serve a lord or befriend kin; looking down, he cannot govern a wife and children or command servants.\n\nThose of old who declined the world all spoke of a hidden sorrow as their ailment. Thus Wenzhi commanded Longshu to stand with his back to the light and observed him facing the light, suspecting he suffered from this hidden sorrow. The Way of the sage values nothing so highly as emptiness. Today I see your heart—the space of a square inch is empty—you are nearly a sage. The ears, eyes, nose, and mouth all connect to the heart; when the six apertures flow freely, the eye is as the ear, the ear as the nose, the nose as the mouth. But if one aperture remains obstructed, the heart congeals. How could external things burden it? Yet if this is called an affliction, is it not akin to the malady of forgetfulness?\n\nThat which arises without cause and yet is ever-present is the Dao; that which arises from life and thus persists even in death is constancy. That which arises from life and yet perishes is misfortune. That which arises with cause and yet is ever-dying is also the Dao; that which arises from death and thus perishes before its end is also constancy. That which arises from death and yet lives is fortune. Thus, to live without attachment is to enact the Dao; to complete life by the Dao is constancy. To die with attachment is also to enact the Dao; to meet death by the Dao is also constancy. What is prized in the Dao is its power over life and death.\n\nThe Dao alone endures and is ever-present, existing without exception. Because it alone endures and is ever-present, it is said: \"That which arises without cause and yet is ever-living.\" Because it exists without exception, it is said: \"That which arises with cause and yet is ever-dying.\" If one lives by the Dao, though one dies, one does not perish—this is the constancy of principle. Thus it is said: \"That which arises from life and thus persists even in death is constancy.\" But if one arises from life and yet perishes, this is not the true course—hence it is called misfortune. If one dies by the Dao, though one perishes before one’s time, it is not seen as change—thus it is said: \"Though one perishes before one’s end, it is also constancy.\" But if one arises from death and yet lives, this is a deluded life, a mere escape by luck—hence it is called fortune.\n\nWhat begins in creation, what transforms through yin and yang, is born and then dies, all by the Dao, all by fate. To live in one moment and die in the next—this is the natural course. When Jiliang died, Yang Zhu sang before his gate; when Suiwu died, Yang Zhu wept over his corpse. The birth and death of a servant—some sing, some weep. If death does not mean perishing, then death may be joyful, which is why he sang before the gate. If death comes as misfortune, then death is lamentable, which is why he wept over the corpse. As for the servant’s life and death—some join in song, some gather in mourning—how could they know where life and death truly lie?\n\nOne whose eyes are about to dim first sees the autumn down; one whose ears are about to deafen first hears the gnats in flight...\"\n\nOne whose mouth is about to lose its taste first distinguishes the waters of Zhi and Sheng; one whose nose is about to be blocked first detects the scent of burning and decay; one whose body is about to stiffen first hastens in restless motion; one whose mind is about to be deluded first discerns right and wrong. Thus, when things do not reach their limit, they do not return. When things reach their extreme, they must reverse—such is the transformation of affairs. Once a form receives its completion, it does not perish until it is utterly spent, and thus it cannot escape entanglement.\n\nThe sage does not fix his position in form; in the depths of obscurity, he alone perceives the dawn; in the midst of silence, he alone hears harmony. How could he allow form to burden spirit?\n\nIn Zheng’s gardens and marshes, many are worthy; in Dongli, many are talented. During the labor at the gardens and marshes, there was a man named Bo Fengzi. Passing through Dongli, he encountered Deng Xi. Deng Xi turned to his disciples and laughed, saying: \"Shall we perform a dance for him? What do you make of this one approaching?\" His disciples replied: \"We would wish to know.\" Deng Xi said to Bo Fengzi: \"Do you understand the meaning of *yang yang* (nurturing nurturance)? To receive nurturance from others yet be unable to nurture oneself—this is the way of dogs and swine. To nurture things so that they serve one’s use—this is the power of man. If your disciples eat their fill and rest in their clothes, it is the achievement of governance. Yet in gathering the young and old to amass provisions for the kitchen, how are you different from dogs and swine?\"\n\nBo Fengzi did not respond. One of his disciples stepped forward out of turn and said: \"Has the master not heard of the many skills in Qi and Lu? There are those skilled in working earth and wood, those skilled in working metal and leather, those skilled in music and sound, those skilled in writing and calculation, those skilled in military affairs, and those skilled in ancestral rites—all talents are present. Yet none can take each other’s place, none can command each other. And those who assign positions lack knowledge, those who command lack ability, while knowledge and ability are both made to serve. The one who governs is but one whom we make use of—why should you take pride in this, Deng Xi?\"\n\nDeng Xi had no reply; he glanced at his disciples and withdrew.\n\nThe hundred schools and myriad skills cannot communicate with one another—like the ear, eye, nose, and mouth, each has its strength and its time of use. Yet there is a true lord residing within. He who employs form uses those who work earth, wood, metal, and leather to make tools; those who work music, writing, and calculation to make use; those who work military affairs to defend the outer; those who work ancestral rites to order the inner—all talents may be said to be present. Yet if one possesses all these for profit, one must also be without them for use, only then can one unify and govern them. For to act is to have what one cannot do; to be without action is to have nothing one cannot do. Thus it is said: \"Those who assign positions lack knowledge; those who command lack ability, yet knowledge and ability are made to serve them.\"\n\nDeng Xi did not comprehend this, taking pride in governance—no wonder he was ridiculed by those of great understanding. Bo Fengzi’s silence was the eloquence of not speaking.\n\nGong Yibo was renowned among the feudal lords for his strength. Tangxigong spoke of him to King Xuan of Zhou, who prepared gifts and invited him. When Gong Yibo arrived and the king observed his appearance, he seemed a feeble man. The king, perplexed, asked: \"What is the measure of your strength?\" Gong Yibo replied: \"Your servant’s strength can break the leg of a spring katydid and crush the wing of an autumn cicada.\" The king’s expression changed: \"My strength can rend the hide of a rhinoceros or drag the tail of nine oxen, yet I still regret its weakness. You break the leg of a spring katydid and crush the wing of an autumn cicada, yet your strength is renowned throughout the world—why?\"\n\nGong Yibo sighed deeply, withdrew from his mat, and said: \"Excellent is the king’s question! Your servant dares to speak truly. I had a teacher, Shang Qiuzi, whose strength was unmatched in the world, yet even his kin did not know it, for he never employed his strength. I served him unto death. He instructed me: 'One who wishes to see what he does not see must observe what others do not; one who wishes to obtain what he does not have must practice what others do not. Thus, one who learns to see first perceives a cartload of firewood; one who learns to hear first hears the striking of a bell. For what is easy within presents no difficulty without. With no difficulty without, one’s name does not leave his household.'\n\nNow my name is known among the feudal lords—this is my violation of my teacher’s teaching, my display of my own ability. Yet my name is not borne of failing to employ my strength, but of knowing how to employ it. Is this not better than failing to employ it? To accumulate many small victories into one great victory—only the sage can do this. How could this be a matter of prizing strength? This is why not using strength is the true possession of strength. The learner studies what he cannot study. Thus it is said: 'One who wishes to see what he does not see must observe what others do not; one who wishes to obtain what he does not have must practice what others do not.'\n\nFrom having what one sees, one discards and forgets it, reaching the point of having no sight—then one sees into obscurity, no different from perceiving a cartload of firewood. From having what one hears, one discards and forgets it, reaching the point of having no hearing—then one listens into silence, no different from hearing the striking of a bell. If virtue does not take form, whence can a name arise? Thus, to display one’s name is to violate one’s teaching. Yet it is still better than prizing strength to seek fame—this is why one is esteemed in the world.\"\n\nPrince Mou of Zhongshan, a worthy prince of Wei, delighted in associating with worthy men and cared not for state affairs, taking pleasure in the company of Gongsun Long of Zhao. The disciples of Le Zhengzi Yu laughed at him. Prince Mou said: \"Why do you laugh at my delight in Gongsun Long?\" Ziyu replied: \"Gongsun Long’s character: he follows no teacher, learns from no friend, is glib but misses the mark, rambles without substance, delights in the strange and speaks recklessly. He seeks to confuse men’s minds and silence their mouths, no better than a turner of the potter’s wheel or a servant.\"\n\nPrince Mou’s expression changed: \"Why do you describe Gongsun Long’s faults so? Pray, tell me the truth.\"\n\nZiyu said: \"I laugh at Long’s deception of Kong Chuan, where he claimed that a master archer could make the rear arrow’s head strike the notch of the one before, each shot following the last, every arrow linked in succession, the foremost arrow reaching the target without break or fall, the notch of the one behind still clinging to the bowstring—so that they seemed as one.\" Kong Chuan was astonished. Long said: \"This is not yet the marvel.\" Among Feng Meng’s disciples was one named Hong Chao, who, enraged at his wife, sought to frighten her. He drew the Wuhao bow and nocked a Qiwei arrow, shooting at her eye. The arrow flew straight toward her pupil, yet her eyelid did not so much as flutter; the arrow fell to the ground, and no dust rose. Could this be the words of a wise man?\"\n\nPrince Mou said: \"The words of the wise are not what the foolish can comprehend. The rear arrow’s head strikes the notch of the one before, the later following the earlier. The arrow flies toward the pupil, yet the eyelid does not flutter—this is the full force of the arrow. Why do you doubt it?\"\n\nLe Zhengzi Yu said: \"You are Long’s follower—how could you not gloss over his flaws? Let me speak of his greater absurdities. Long deceived the King of Wei, saying: 'There is intention without mind. There is pointing without reaching. There is thing without exhausting. There is shadow without movement. A single hair can draw a thousand jun. A white horse is not a horse. An orphaned calf has never had a mother.' His violations of kind and reversal of principle are too many to recount.\"\n\nPrince Mou said: \"You take what you do not understand as the height of absurdity—yet the absurdity lies with you. Without intention, minds are the same; without pointing, all things are reached. One who exhausts things is ever present. That a shadow does not move is explained by change. A single hair drawing a thousand jun is due to equal force. That a white horse is not a horse is the separation of form and name. That an orphaned calf has never had a mother is because it is not an orphaned calf.\"\n\nLe Zhengzi Yu said: \"You take all of Gongsun Long’s prattling as reasoned argument. If such words issued from another’s mouth, you would still accept them.\" Prince Mou fell silent for a long while, then took his leave, saying: \"Let me return another day to seek your counsel.\"\n\n\"Walking in ruin, one desires a teacher; learning in isolation, one desires a friend. Loquacity leads to exhaustion—better to abide in the center. Thus, glibness misses the mark. The hundred schools and myriad arts have their uses at times—thus, rambling lacks a home.\n\nThere is the archer’s shooting, and there is shooting that is not shooting. The rear arrow’s head striking the notch of the one before is nothing more than the later following the earlier. The arrow flying toward the pupil without the eye fluttering is nothing more than the full force of the arrow. This is the archer’s shooting—what doubt remains?\n\nIntention arises from the mind; with intention, minds differ. Thus, there is intention without mind, but without intention, minds are the same. Pointing is for indicating things; what is not pointed to is not reached. Thus, nothing is better than no pointing, for then all things are reached. Things cannot be exhausted. To insist on exhausting them is to be forever bound to existence. Thus, there is thing without exhausting, but one who exhausts things is ever present. That a shadow does not move means that whether the object is bent or straight, its shadow remains the same—thus, the explanation lies in change. That a single hair can draw a thousand jun means that the accumulation of the small, though not victorious alone, becomes victorious in sum—thus, the force is equal.\n\nYet though Gongsun Long can silence men’s mouths, he cannot win their hearts—this is the limit of the debater’s art.\" *Liezi* records this, no doubt to dispel the harm of perverse doctrines.\n\nYao ruled the world for fifty years, yet did not know whether the world was well governed or not, whether the myriad people wished to uphold him or not. He asked his attendants—they did not know; he asked the outer court—they did not know; he asked those in the wilds—they did not know.\n\nYao then donned humble attire and wandered the broad thoroughfares, where he heard children singing:\n\n*\"He sets us, the teeming folk, aright—\nNone but you define our bound.\nUnknowing, unperceiving,\nWe follow Heaven’s decree.\"*\n\nDelighted, Yao asked, \"Who taught you these words?\"\nThe eldest child replied, \"I heard them from a grandee.\"\nYao inquired of the grandee, who said, \"It is an ancient poem.\"\n\nReturning to his palace, Yao summoned Shun and thereupon ceded the realm to him. Shun did not decline but accepted it.\n\nYao was not one who relied on others, nor did he perceive others as relying on him. Not relying on others, he knew not whether the world was well governed or not. Not perceiving others as relying on him, he knew not whether the myriad people wished to uphold him or not. Whether he asked his attendants, the court, or those in the wilds, none could answer—so vast was the people’s virtue that none could name it.\n\n*\"He sets us, the teeming folk, aright—\nNone but you define our bound.\"*\nThis means that when clothing and food are sufficient, all receive the mean of their mandate.\n\n*\"Unknowing, unperceiving,\nWe follow Heaven’s decree.\"*\nThis means that when clothing and food are sufficient, all follow Heaven’s principle, and the people call it natural—this is the governance of the highest order.\n\nGuan Yinxi said: *\"Abiding nowhere in oneself, one’s form manifests in things. In movement, it is like water; in stillness, like a mirror; in response, like an echo. Thus, the Dao resembles things. Things depart from the Dao, but the Dao does not depart from things. One who is good at embodying the Dao neither uses ears, nor eyes, nor strength, nor mind. To seek the Dao through sight, hearing, form, or intellect is misguided. Gazing ahead, it is suddenly behind; employed, it fills the six directions; discarded, none know its place. Neither those with minds can grasp it from afar, nor those without minds draw near. Only those who silently attain it and inwardly perfect it may obtain it—knowing yet forgetting emotion, able yet not acting, this is true knowing and true ability. If one acts from non-knowing, how can there be emotion? If one acts from non-ability, how can there be action? A clod of earth, a heap of dust—though non-acting, they are not in accord with principle.\"*\n\nThe Dao moves above the myriad things. The sage embodies the Dao, circulating without accumulation, yet things cannot depart from it—thus, *\"abiding nowhere in oneself, one’s form manifests in things.\"*\n\n*\"In movement, it is like water\"* means flowing with things, riding their waves, and moving in accord with principle.\n\n*\"In stillness, like a mirror\"* means neither advancing nor retreating, responding to things without retention, still and unchanging.\n\n*\"In response, like an echo\"* means never initiating, only harmonizing with others—this is the Dao, responding to things without opposition.\n\nThe Dao resembles things, yet things increasingly depart from the Dao—this is what is meant by *\"things depart from the Dao.\"* The Dao is vast and identical with things, thus *\"the Dao does not depart.\"*\n\nThe Dao has no beginning; to say it can be heard is false. The Dao cannot be seen; to say it is visible is false. Therefore, one who is good at embodying the Dao neither uses ears nor eyes.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"Without dwelling, without attachment, one first attains the Dao. Without thought, without worry, one first knows the Dao.\"* Therefore, one who is good at embodying the Dao neither uses strength nor mind.\n\nForm, color, name, and sound are insufficient to grasp its essence—thus, *\"to seek the Dao through sight, hearing, form, or intellect is misguided.\"*\n\n*\"Gazing ahead, it is suddenly behind\"* means it cannot be measured.\n\n*\"Employed, it fills the six directions; discarded, none know its place\"* means it cannot be grasped.\n\nThose who govern by the Dao forget the mind; a mind without knowledge is called attainment. Those with minds or without minds have not yet forgotten the mind, and thus cannot possess virtue. Silently attaining it, inwardly perfecting it—this is to use no mind, and thus to obtain it.\n\nKnowing yet forgetting emotion is to be free from the burdens of knowledge—this is true knowing. Able yet not acting is to be free from the artifices of ability—this is true ability.\n\nIf one acts from non-knowing, how can there be emotion? If one acts from non-ability, how can there be action?\n\nThe Dao is constantly non-acting, yet nothing is left undone.\n\n[Text incomplete]\n\n*End of the Sixth Scroll of the Commentary on the* Classic of Integrity and Emptiness.",

Dare we make a request? What teaching will you leave us?\"\nThe Master replied: \"Have you not heard the words of Master Huqiu Zilin?\"\nLiezi laughed and said: \"What did Master Hu say?\"\n\"Though it be so, the Master once spoke to Bohun Maoren. I overheard it in passing and shall now tell you:\nThe Dao/Way cannot be spoken; to speak of it is to miss it.\nThen what did Master Hu say?\nWhen compelled to speak, he spoke, and so I heard and now convey it.\nHis words were: 'There is birth that is not birth; there is transformation that is not transformation.\nThat which does not birth can birth birth; that which does not transform can transform transformation.\nThat which is born cannot but be born; that which transforms cannot but transform—thus there is constant birth and constant transformation.\nConstant birth and constant transformation mean there is no time without birth, no time without transformation.\nSuch is yin and yang; such are the four seasons.\nThat which does not birth is called *dubious solitude*; that which does not transform is called *reciprocity*.\nReciprocity—its bounds cannot be exhausted.\nDubious solitude—its Dao/Way cannot be fathomed.\nBirth proceeds from nonbeing to being; transformation proceeds from being to nonbeing.\nThat which is born and transformed is *thing*; that which neither births nor transforms is the Dao/Way.\nThings are bound by number, so that which is born cannot but be born, and that which transforms cannot but transform.\nThe Dao/Way courses through things, thus there is constant birth and constant transformation, with no time without birth, no time without transformation.\nStanding alone above the myriad things, that which does not birth is called *dubious solitude*, pervading and inexhaustible.\nThus, that which does not transform is called *reciprocity*.\nReciprocity—its bounds cannot be exhausted.\nFor none can know its beginning or end.\nDubious solitude—its Dao/Way cannot be fathomed.\nFor it cannot be measured or probed.\nNo thing can pair with it—how could one truly know its *wherefore*?\nOne can only doubt it.'\n\nThe *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: 'The valley spirit does not die; it is called the *mysterious female*.\nThe gate of the mysterious female is called the root of heaven and earth.\nSubtly continuous, as if present, its use is inexhaustible.'\nThus, that which births things does not birth; that which transforms things does not transform.\nSelf-birthing, self-transforming, self-shaping, self-coloring, self-knowing, self-empowering, self-diminishing, self-ceasing—\nTo call these *birth and transformation, shape and color, knowledge and power, ebb and flow* is incorrect.\nThe movement of yin and yang, the progression of the four seasons, the principles of the myriad things—suddenly born and existing, suddenly transformed and gone.\nForm solidifies, color manifests, wisdom schemes, power acts, ebb and flow wax and wane—ending only to begin again.\nNo movement without change; no time without shift.\nThough all reside in the Dao/Way, their ceaseless revolving is self-so.\nLiezi said: 'Of old, the sages followed yin and yang to unify heaven and earth.\nIf that which has form is born from the formless, then how did heaven and earth come to be?'\nThus it is said: There was *Great Simplicity*, *Great Beginning*, *Great Inception*, *Great Purity*.\n*Great Simplicity* is the state before qi appeared.\n*Great Beginning* is the inception of qi.\n*Great Inception* is the inception of form.\n*Great Purity* is the inception of substance.\nWhen qi, form, and substance were complete yet not yet separated, it was called *Hunlun*.\n*Hunlun* means the myriad things were intermingled and not yet separated.\nInvisible to sight, inaudible to hearing, untraceable by touch—thus it is called *Simplicity*.\n*Simplicity* has no form or boundary; it transforms into *One*, *One* transforms into *Seven*, *Seven* transforms into *Nine*.\n*Nine* is the ultimate transformation.\nThen it transforms again into *One*.\n*One* is the inception of form’s transformation.\nThe clear and light ascended to become heaven; the turbid and heavy descended to become earth; the harmonious qi became human.\nThus, heaven and earth deposited their essence, and the myriad things were transformed and born.\nYin and yang are the greatness of qi; heaven and earth are the greatness of form.\nWhen qi transforms and takes form, there is yin and yang, and then there are heaven and earth.\nThe Dao/Way is their commonality; the sage is the steward of the Dao/Way.\nThis is how the sage follows yin and yang to unify heaven and earth.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* speaks of *Great Ultimate*, which generates the Two Modes.\nThis is what *Zhuangzi* meant by 'the Dao/Way existing prior to the Great Ultimate.'\nThus, *Great Simplicity* is the state before qi appeared, dwelling in the indistinct and vague, transforming to give rise to qi.\nThus, *Great Beginning* is the inception of qi; qi transforms to give rise to form.\nThus, *Great Inception* is the inception of form; form differentiates to give rise to substance.\nThus, *Great Purity* is the inception of substance.\nWhen qi, form, and substance are complete yet not yet separated, the full embodiment of the Dao/Way is therein.\nThus it is said: *Hunlun*—this is what *Laozi* meant by 'a thing chaotically formed.'\nNo use for brightness, thus invisible to sight; no application for hearing, thus inaudible; no exertion of strength, thus untraceable.\nThese three cannot be interrogated, thus they merge into *One*.\nYet having called it *One*, can one truly remain silent?\"",

      "translated_text": "This is why it is forcibly named *Change*. *Change* has no fixed boundaries, for it has no form. When *Change* is likened to yang, it arises from the One, thus transforming into the One. Numbers begin with the One, thus transforming into seven—this is the state of contraction before expansion. Seven transforms into nine—this is the interaction that brings about change. When numbers reach their limit at nine, they revert to the One. The One is the inception of all transformations, and thus heaven, earth, and humanity all derive their existence from it. Therefore, it is said: that which is pure and light ascends to become heaven; that which is turbid and heavy descends to become earth; that which is harmonious qi becomes humanity. Essence is the One. The One gives rise to the Two, the Two gives rise to the Three, and the Three gives rise to the myriad things. Thus, heaven and earth contain essence, and the myriad things are transformed and born.\n\nMaster Liezi said: \"Heaven has no complete achievement, the sage has no complete ability, and the myriad things have no complete use.\" Thus, heaven’s duty is to give life and provide cover; earth’s duty is to shape and bear; the sage’s duty is to teach and transform; and things fulfill their proper roles. Yet heaven has its shortcomings, earth has its strengths, the sage has limitations, and things have their capacities. Why is this? That which gives life and cover cannot shape and bear; that which shapes and bears cannot teach and transform; that which teaches and transforms cannot defy what is proper; and that which is fixed in propriety does not overstep its position. Thus, the Way of heaven and earth is either yin or yang; the teachings of the sage are either benevolence or righteousness; and the proper roles of the myriad things are either softness or hardness. These all follow what is proper and cannot overstep their positions.\n\nHeaven is positioned above, earth is positioned below, and the sage is positioned between heaven and earth. All serve to complete transformations. As transformations alternate and arise, the myriad things take on different proper roles. How could heaven, earth, and the sage defy what is proper? Thus, in relation to heaven and earth, the sage distinguishes the three poles yet unites them as the three talents. That which gives life and cover cannot shape and bear; that which shapes and bears cannot teach and transform; that which teaches and transforms cannot defy what is proper. That which is fixed in propriety does not overstep its position—this speaks to the division of duties.\n\nTherefore, in terms of their distinctions, the Way of the sage reaches up to heaven and coils down to earth, transforming and nurturing the myriad things, beyond all imagery. Then, above and below flow as one without distinction—how could there be comparisons of long and short, or differences of capacity and limitation? Thus, there are beings that are born, and there is that which gives birth; there are forms, and there is that which forms; there are sounds, and there is that which sounds; there are colors, and there is that which colors; there are flavors, and there is that which flavors. That which is born of birth perishes, yet that which gives birth never ends. That which is formed of form is solid, yet that which forms never exists. That which is sounded of sound is heard, yet that which sounds never emits. That which is colored of color is manifest, yet that which colors never appears. That which is flavored of flavor is tasted, yet that which flavors never presents itself. These are all the duties of non-action.\n\nBirth, form, sound, color, and flavor are all transformations of things, thus the hidden departs and the manifest arrives. Yet that which gives birth, that which forms, that which sounds, that which colors, and that which flavors—these are the subtleties of the Dao/Way. Who can trace their origin? Who can grasp their end? The Dao/Way is ever non-active yet accomplishes all—this is why it is so.\n\nIt can be yin, it can be yang; it can be soft, it can be hard; it can be short, it can be long; it can be round, it can be square; it can give life, it can bring death; it can be hot, it can be cold; it can float, it can sink; it can be gong, it can be shang; it can emerge, it can submerge; it can be dark, it can be yellow; it can be sweet, it can be bitter; it can be foul, it can be fragrant. It is without knowledge, without ability, yet there is nothing it does not know, nothing it cannot do. To have partial knowledge or ability is but a one-sided aspect of the Dao/Way, not its full and complete realization. Yet to be without knowledge yet know all, without ability yet do all—this is to encompass all, to pervade all. What is there it cannot do?\n\nYin and yang are qi; softness and hardness are substance; short and long are form; round and square are vessels; life and death are numbers; heat and cold are seasons; floating and sinking are conditions; gong and shang are sounds; emergence and submergence are paths; dark and yellow are colors; sweet and bitter are flavors; foul and fragrant are odors. All transformations arise from these. Were the ancients not complete in this?",
      "overlap_context": "*Great Purity* is the inception of substance.\nWhen qi, form, and substance are complete yet not yet separated, the full embodiment of the Dao/Way is therein.\nThus it is said: *Hunlun*—this is what *Laozi* meant by 'a thing chaotically formed.'\nNo use for brightness, thus invisible to sight; no application for hearing, thus inaudible; no exertion of strength, thus untraceable.\nThese three cannot be interrogated, thus they merge into *One*.\nYet having called it *One*, can one truly remain silent?\"",

      "translated_text": "The six penetrations, the four openings, the small and the great, the refined and the coarse—all move together without ceasing, whither could they not reach? Where would they find no leisure?\n\nMaster Liezi journeyed to Wei and took a meal by the roadside. His followers saw a century-old skull, plucked a clump of mugwort, and pointed at it. Turning to his disciple Bai Feng, he said: \"Only you and that one know that you have never been born and never died. Does this surpass nurturing life? Does this surpass joy?\n\nThere are seeds of transformation: the frog becomes a quail; in water, it becomes a *ji*; at the border of water and earth, it becomes the garment of the *wapin*. Born on a hillock, it becomes *lingxi*. The *lingxi* meeting *yuqi* becomes *wuzu*. The root of *wuzu* becomes the *qichan*; its leaves become butterflies. The butterfly, in time, transforms into an insect, born beneath the stove, its form like a cast-off skin, its name *niaogouduo*. After a thousand days, *niaogouduo* transforms into a bird called *ganyugu*. The foam of *ganyugu* becomes *simi*. *Simi* becomes *shixiyilu*. *Shixiyilu* gives rise to *shixihuanghuang*. *Shixihuanghuang* gives rise to *jiuyou*. *Jiuyou* gives rise to *maorui*, and *maorui* to *fuxuan*. Sheep’s liver transforms into *digao*; horse’s blood into *zhuanlin*; human blood into *wildfire*. The sparrowhawk becomes the *zhan*; the *zhan* becomes the cuckoo; the cuckoo, in time, reverts to the sparrowhawk. The swallow becomes the clam; the field mouse becomes the quail; the rotten melon becomes the fish; old leeks become amaranth; old ewes become apes; fish eggs become insects.\n\nThe beast *danyuan* conceives of itself and is born, called *lei*. The bird of rivers and marshes is born by sight alone, called *yi*. The purely female is named *dayao*; the purely male is named *zhifeng*. The yearning scholar, though unwed, is moved; the yearning maiden, though husbandless, conceives. Hou Ji was born from a giant’s footprint; Yi Yin from the hollow mulberry; Jue Zhao from dampness; the vinegar fly from wine. *Yangxi* paired with the un-sprouted bamboo, and from long-standing bamboo came *qingning*. *Qingning* gave rise to *cheng*; *cheng* to the horse; the horse to man; man, in time, enters the mechanism. All things emerge from the mechanism, all things return to the mechanism.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"Trace beginnings to their end, and you will know the discourse on death and life.\" For where there is birth, there must be death, yet what dies here is not necessarily unborn elsewhere. One who comprehends this knows, like you and that one, that there is no birth, no death. Now living, now dying; now dying, now living—this is nurturing form and delighting in life. What exists now is but what once passed away. Thus it is said: \"Does this surpass nurturing life? Does this surpass joy?\"\n\nAll things replace one another in different forms, so the transformations of life and death cannot be counted. Thus it is said: \"There are seeds of transformation.\" What follows is but what the eyes and ears can perceive. The frog becoming a quail speaks of the transformations of the myriad things between land and water. The *ji*, the garment of the *wapin*, the *lingxi*—these are one kind. Some, meeting water and earth, are born below; others, meeting hillocks, are born above. This speaks of the myriad things transforming according to the forms and qi they encounter.\n\nThe *lingxi* meeting *yuqi* becomes *wuzu*, borrowing another thing as its body. The root of *wuzu* becomes the *qichan*; its leaves become butterflies—scattering the same body into different things. The butterfly, in time, transforms into an insect, born beneath the stove, its form like a cast-off skin, its name *niaogouduo*. Here, the winged becomes the wriggling. After a thousand days, *niaogouduo* transforms into the bird *ganyugu*—the burrower becomes the tree-dweller. Some shift by form, like *simi* becoming *yilu*. Others arise from putrefaction, like *huanghuang* born from *fuxuan*, or *digao*, *zhuanlin*, and *wildfire*. Some reverse by nature, like the sparrowhawk becoming the *zhan*, the *zhan* the cuckoo, the cuckoo reverting to the sparrowhawk. The swallow becomes the clam; the field mouse the quail; the rotten melon the fish; old leeks the amaranth; old ewes the ape; fish eggs the insect—some follow kind, others unite unlike kinds.\n\nThe beast *danyuan* conceives of itself and is born, called *lei*—is this transformation without stimulus? The bird of rivers and marshes is born by sight alone, called *yi*—is this transformation without union? The purely female is named *dayao*; the purely male *zhifeng*—in things, there are those that generate themselves through yin and yang alone. The yearning scholar, though unwed, is moved; the yearning maiden, though husbandless, conceives—in humans, there are those who connect subtly beyond yin and yang. Even Hou Ji born from a giant’s footprint or Yi Yin from the hollow mulberry, though inexplicable, are not strange.\n\nJue Zhao was born from dampness—transformed by qi. The vinegar fly was born from wine—transformed by flavor. *Yangxi* paired with the un-sprouted bamboo—transformed by habit. Long-standing bamboo gave rise to *qingning*—the inanimate generating the animate. *Qingning* gave rise to *cheng*—the unknowing generating the knowing. The *Shizi* says *cheng* is like a leopard; *cheng* gives rise to the horse—like generating like. The horse gives rise to man—unlike generating unlike. Thus, the comings and goings of insects, the life and death of plants, transformations are endless, never reaching a limit. How could one know the order of life and death?\n\nOnly this: all things in birth have their sprouting, in death their return. The sage, in this, knows there is a mechanism they cannot control. The *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: \"Form in motion does not generate form but shadow; sound in motion does not generate sound but echo; non-motion does not generate non-being but being—form must ultimately end.\"",

      "translated_text": "Does heaven and earth come to an end? They end together with me. Do they advance toward an end? I do not know. Does the Dao come to an end? It has no beginning, so how could its root be transient? Where there is birth, there is a return to non-birth; where there is form, there is a return to formlessness. That which does not birth is not originally non-birthing; that which is formless is not originally formless. Birth is the inevitable end of principle. Ending cannot but end, just as birth cannot but birth. To desire the permanence of life and the fulfillment of its end is to be deluded by calculation.\n\nThe spirit is heaven’s portion; the bones and flesh are earth’s portion. That which belongs to heaven is clear and disperses; that which belongs to earth is turbid and gathers. When spirit departs from form, each returns to its true nature—this is called *gui* (ghost). *Gui* means \"return,\" a return to the true dwelling. The Yellow Emperor said: \"When spirit enters its gate and bones return to their root, what of me remains?\" Stillness restores one’s nature; movement departs from the root—such is principle. When form moves, it does not generate form but shadow; when sound moves, it does not generate sound but echo; non-movement does not generate non-being but being—thus one drifts ever farther from the root. Non-being gives rise to being, and being must return to non-being; therefore, it is said that form must ultimately end.\n\nHeaven and earth are born together with me, and when they end, they end together with me. Who knows their limit? Thus, to speak of an end is to advance toward the unknown. That which has an end has a beginning, that which endures has a transience—these are but temporal phenomena. Therefore, the ultimate Dao takes the beginningless as its beginning, and to end at the root is to reach the ultimate. The enduring takes the non-enduring as its ultimate, and to advance toward the root is to reach the ultimate. Why is it that where there is birth, there is a return to non-birth, and where there is form, there is a return to formlessness? That which does not birth is not originally non-birthing; that which is formless is not originally formless—this is seen only from the perspective of those with birth and form. Birth is the inevitable end of principle; ending cannot but end, just as birth cannot but birth. To desire life’s perpetuity and set death as its boundary—how could one know the endlessness within the cycle? This is to be deluded by calculation.\n\nBirth is the harmony bestowed by heaven and earth. The spirit is heaven’s portion, thus clear and dispersing; the bones and flesh are earth’s portion, thus turbid and gathering. When spirit scatters, each returns to its true nature—what then remains of me? This is spoken from the perspective of the common people. Thus it is said: \"When spirit enters its gate and bones return to their root, what of me remains?\" As for the sage, above they wander with the Creator, below they befriend those without end or beginning—thus their form never decays, and their self alone endures.\n\nFrom birth to death, the great transformation of man passes through four stages: infancy, youth and prime, old age, and death. In infancy, qi is concentrated and the will is unified—harmony is at its peak. No thing harms it, and no virtue surpasses it. In youth and prime, blood and qi surge, desires and thoughts arise abundantly—things assail it, and virtue thus declines. In old age, desires and thoughts soften, the body prepares to rest—no thing precedes it. Though it does not match the wholeness of infancy, it surpasses the state between youth and prime. In death, one comes to rest, returning to the ultimate.\n\nIn infancy, qi is concentrated and the will is unified—harmony is at its peak, what the *Laozi* calls \"the thickness of containing virtue.\" In youth and prime, blood and qi surge, desires and thoughts arise abundantly—what *Zhuangzi* calls \"entanglement with the world.\" In old age, blood and qi have declined, thus desires and thoughts soften and the body prepares to rest. Upon returning to the true dwelling, one comes to rest and returns to the ultimate. *Zhuangzi* said: \"The great clod burdens me with form, labors me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death.\" This is what he meant.\n\nFrom infancy to death, all is called *cu* (passing away), thus it is called transformation. Confucius was traveling on Mount Tai when he saw Rong Qiqi walking in the wilds of Cheng, wearing a deerskin robe tied with a rope, plucking his zither and singing. Confucius asked him: \"Sir, what is the reason for your joy?\" He replied: \"My joys are many. Heaven generates the myriad things, and man is the most noble—this is my first joy. Among the distinctions of male and female, the male is honored and the female is lowly—since I have been born a man, this is my second joy. Some do not live to see the sun and moon, never leaving swaddling clothes—I have already reached ninety years, this is my third joy. Poverty is the constant of the scholar; death is the end of man. Abiding in constancy and meeting one’s end, what is there to grieve?\" Confucius said: \"Excellent! He is able to console himself.\"\n\nLin Lei was nearly a hundred years old. In late spring, he donned a fur robe and gleaned fallen grain in an old field, singing as he walked. Confucius, passing through Wei, saw him in the wilds and said to his disciples: \"That old man may be worth speaking to. Try going to question him.\" Zigong volunteered and met him at the edge of the ridge. Facing him, he sighed and said: \"Sir, do you have no regrets, singing and gleaning as you go?\" Lin Lei walked on without stopping, his song unbroken. Zigong persisted in questioning him, and he finally looked up and answered: \"What should I regret?\" Zigong said: \"In your youth, you did not strive in conduct; in your prime, you did not compete with the times; in old age, you have no wife or children; death approaches—what joy is there in gleaning and singing?\" Lin Lei laughed and said: \"The reason for my joy is something all men possess, yet they turn it into sorrow. In youth, I did not strive in conduct; in my prime, I did not compete with the times—thus I have lived so long. In old age, I have no wife or children; death approaches—thus I can be so joyful.\"",

      "translated_text": "Zigong said: \"Longevity is what men desire; death is what men detest. Why do you take death as joy?\"\n\nLin Lei replied: \"Death and life are but a departure and a return. Thus, those who die here—how do we know they are not born there? Therefore, I know they are not the same, and how do I know that busily seeking life is not delusion? How do I know that my death now is not better than my life before?\"\n\nZigong, not comprehending his meaning, returned and told the Master. The Master said: \"I knew he was one with whom words could be shared—indeed, so it is. Yet what he has grasped is not yet complete.\"\n\nThe *Yi* says: \"Rejoice in Heaven and know fate, thus free from care.\" Abiding in constancy, one attains fulfillment. Death and life bring no change to oneself—this is the source of one’s joy. Cultivating the self, accepting poverty or prosperity, knowing that going and coming are not fixed, and that I am not disturbed in mind—what sorrow can there be?\n\nYet to know joy and to know sorrow is not true joy. Confucius took the absence of joy as true joy. Rong Qigi was truly able to ease himself. But Lin Lei has grasped it yet not fully.\n\nZigong, weary of study, said to Confucius: \"I wish to rest for a while.\"\n\nConfucius replied: \"In life, there is no rest.\"\n\nZigong said: \"Then shall I, Ci, have no rest at all?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"There is rest. Look to the grave mound—its clarity like a tower, its height like a stele, its grandeur like a tumulus, its separation like a cauldron. There you will know rest.\"\n\nZigong said: \"Great is death indeed! The noble man rests there; the petty man lies low.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"You have understood, Ci. Men all know the joy of life, yet not the suffering of life; they know the weariness of old age, yet not its ease; they know the dread of death, yet not the rest of death. If one studies the Dao yet does not reach the understanding of death, what is the use of study? You, Zigong, weary of learning and wishing to rest, have not yet understood the meaning of death. Thus the Master told you that in life there is no rest, and pointed to the grave mound—its clarity like a tower, its height like a stele, its grandeur like a tumulus, its separation like a cauldron, cut off from the world. This is the place of rest.\n\nYet the multitude calls death a thing, while the noble man, though dead, does not perish. Thus it is said: the noble man rests there; the petty man lies low.\n\nThe toil of life is what wearies me with life; the ease of old age is what eases me with age; the rest of death is what gives me rest in death.\n\nYanzi said: \"How excellent that the ancients had death! The virtuous rest there; the unvirtuous lie low.\" Death is the culmination of virtue. The ancients called the dead \"those who return.\" If the dead are called \"those who return,\" then the living are \"those who journey.\" To journey without knowing to return is to lose one’s home. If one man loses his home, the world condemns him; if the world loses its home, none know to condemn it.\n\nThere are those who leave their homeland, abandon their six relations, forsake their family and livelihood, and wander the four directions without returning—what manner of men are they? The world must call them mad and reckless. And there are those who cherish worldly success, weigh their words, prize their bodies and lives, boast of their skills, cultivate fame, and vaunt themselves in the world without self-knowledge—what manner of men are they? The world must call them wise and cunning. Both are lost, yet the world approves one and not the other. Only the sage knows what to approve and what to reject.\n\nDeath and life are indeed great matters. To perfect one’s life is to perfect one’s death. Thus it is said: how excellent that the ancients had death. To die yet not perish is called longevity. The virtuous attain longevity; the unvirtuous perish with things. Thus it is said: the virtuous rest there; the unvirtuous lie low.\n\n*Jiao* (culmination) is the place of return. Life is yang; life is the radiance of virtue, and radiance stems from yang. Death is yin; death is the culmination of virtue, and culmination stems from yin. Thus to take life as journeying and death as returning is also the meaning of yin and yang, movement and stillness.\n\nThe mad and reckless are lost in one way; the outwardly cunning are lost in another. To reject this and take that—this is the blindness of the world. Only the sage knows what to approve and what to reject.\n\nSomeone asked Liezi: \"Why do you value emptiness?\"\n\nLiezi said: \"Emptiness is nothing to value.\"\n\nLiezi said: \"Not in name. Nothing compares to stillness; nothing compares to emptiness. Stillness and emptiness—these attain their proper place. Taking and giving—these lose their place.\n\nWhen affairs are shattered and broken, then there arises the performance of benevolence and righteousness—but it cannot be restored. Where there is value, there is baseness; where there is name, there is substance. Emptiness has none of these.\"\n\n*Laozi* says: \"Attain utmost emptiness, guard deep stillness. Emptiness suffices to receive all things; stillness suffices to respond to all movements.\" Thus it is said: nothing compares to stillness; nothing compares to emptiness.\n\nTo take emptiness and stillness as attaining their proper place means that the movements and things of the world cannot obstruct them. To take taking and giving as losing their place means that rejecting this and taking that is to be attached.\n\nWhen the great Dao declines, there is benevolence and righteousness. When affairs are shattered and broken, then there arises the performance of benevolence and righteousness—how can it return to the Dao?\n\nZhou Xiong said: \"Revolving without cease, heaven and earth shift imperceptibly—who notices? Thus what is diminished there is filled here; what is completed here is diminished there. Loss and gain, completion and diminution follow the world and follow death. Coming and going connect without gap—who notices?\n\nIn general, qi does not advance all at once; form does not diminish all at once. One does not perceive its completion; one does not perceive its diminution. It is like a man from youth to old age—his appearance, complexion, wisdom, and demeanor change day by day without notice.\"",
      "overlap_context": "your youth, you did not strive in conduct; in your prime, you did not compete with the times; in old age, you have no wife or children; death approaches—what joy is there in gleaning and singing?\" Lin Lei laughed and said: \"The reason for my joy is something all men possess, yet they turn it into sorrow. In youth, I did not strive in conduct; in my prime, I did not compete with the times—thus I have lived so long. In old age, I have no wife or children; death approaches—thus I can be so joyful.\"",

      "translated_text": "Skin, nails, and hair follow the world and fall away—there was never a time in infancy when they paused or remained unchanged. The intervals are imperceptible; one only knows in hindsight.\n\nThe spirit is that which subtly pervades all things. If its subtlety eludes recognition, then all that clings to form, is bound by number, or confined within heaven and earth—where the revolving of the two qi never ceases and the coming and going of the myriad things never ends—how can one seek its governing and propelling force and find it? How then could one claim to know it? Only the sage, penetrating to the source of things, awakens to this and merges with it. Those who only know in hindsight are among the last to awaken, if they awaken at all.\n\nIn the state of Qi, there was a man who worried that heaven and earth would collapse and he would have no place to dwell, so he neglected sleep and food. Another man, concerned about his concern, went to enlighten him, saying: \"Heaven is but an accumulation of qi, with no place devoid of qi. You bend and stretch, breathe and move, spending all day within heaven—why worry about collapse?\" The man said: \"If heaven is but an accumulation of qi, should not the sun, moon, and stars fall?\" The enlightener replied: \"The sun, moon, and stars are merely luminous accumulations within qi. Even if they fell, they could cause no harm.\" The man said: \"What of the earth’s ruin?\" The enlightener replied: \"The earth is but an accumulation of clods, filling the four directions with no place devoid of clods. You tread and step, spending all day upon the earth—why worry about its ruin?\" The man was suddenly relieved and overjoyed. The enlightener was also suddenly relieved and overjoyed.\n\nWhen Changluzi heard of this, he laughed and said: \"Rainbows, clouds, winds, rain, and the four seasons—these are the accumulations of qi that form heaven. Mountains, rivers, seas, metals, stones, fire, and wood—these are the accumulations of form that constitute the earth. To know that they are accumulations of qi and clods—how can one say they do not decay? Heaven and earth are but a tiny thing within the void, the greatest of bounded things. That they are difficult to exhaust, difficult to fathom—this is certainly so. To worry about their decay is indeed too distant; to say they do not decay is also incorrect. If heaven and earth cannot but decay, then they will eventually return to decay. When their time of decay arrives, why should one not worry?\"\n\nWhen Liezi heard this, he laughed and said: \"To say heaven and earth decay is also mistaken; to say they do not decay is also mistaken. Decay and non-decay—I cannot know them. Nevertheless, they are one and the same. Thus the living do not know death; the dead do not know life. The coming do not know going; the going do not know coming. Decay and non-decay—why should I concern myself? From the perspective of vessels, there is completion and there must be decay. From the perspective of the Dao, there is no completion and no decay. Those confined to vessels say that because they have form and qi, they cannot but decay. Those who penetrate the Dao know that they neither sink nor fall, and thus cannot decay. Only the enlightened understand this penetration. This is why Liezi has no concern for such matters.\"\n\nShun asked Zheng Zhuangzi, who served as minister, saying: \"Can the Dao be obtained and possessed?\" He replied: \"Your body is not your own—how can you possess the Dao?\" Shun said: \"If my body is not my own, then whose is it?\" He replied: \"It is the entrusted form of heaven and earth. Life is not your own—it is the entrusted harmony of heaven and earth. Nature and destiny are not your own—they are the entrusted compliance of heaven and earth. Children and grandchildren are not your own—they are the entrusted shedding of heaven and earth. Thus, in walking, you do not know where you go; in dwelling, you do not know what you hold; in eating, you do not know its flavor. Heaven and earth are strong and yang—mere qi. How then can you possess them?\n\nWhen empty, there is nothing; when full, there is something. All that can be obtained and possessed can be grasped and taken. The Dao is subtly formless, profoundly unknowable. Since it cannot be obtained and possessed, and a person’s body, form, nature, and destiny are all momentarily present and suddenly gone—how can one possess them? Form is the body, thus the body is the entrusted form of heaven and earth. Harmony is qi, thus life is the entrusted harmony of heaven and earth. The arising of things merely follows the principle of nature and destiny, thus nature and destiny are the entrusted compliance of heaven and earth. The body is the legacy of one’s parents, thus children and grandchildren are the entrusted shedding of heaven and earth. If this is so, then nothing is one’s own. Thus, in walking, one does not know where one goes; in dwelling, one does not know what one holds; in eating, one does not know its flavor. Since there is that which governs and that which impels, merely the strong yang qi of heaven and earth in motion—how can one possess the Dao?\n\nNevertheless, the Dao is that which all people jointly follow. Thus it is said: 'The Dao will dwell with you'—how could it ultimately be unobtainable and unpossessable? If one claims to possess it, then none can possess it. Only the sage possesses it by not possessing it.\"\n\nIn Qi, the Guo family was very wealthy, while in Song, the Xiang family was very poor. The Xiang family traveled from Song to Qi to ask for their method. The Guo family told them: \"I am skilled at theft.\" When I first began to steal, I was self-sufficient after one year, content after two, and greatly prosperous after three. From then on, my bounty extended to the entire district. The Xiang family was overjoyed, understanding the words of theft but not the way of theft. They then scaled walls and tunneled through rooms, taking whatever their hands and eyes reached. Before long, they were caught for their crimes and lost their ancestral property. The Xiang family, believing the Guo family had deceived them, went to complain. The Guo family said: \"How did you steal?\" The Xiang family described their actions. The Guo family said: \"Alas! Have you lost the way of theft to this extent? Now I will tell you. I have heard that heaven has its seasons, and earth has its advantages...\"",

      "translated_text": "I steal the seasons and advantages of heaven and earth, the abundant moisture of clouds and rain, the nurturing bounty of mountains and marshes, to grow my grain, cultivate my crops, build my embankments, and construct my dwellings. On land, I steal from the birds and beasts; in water, I steal from the fish and turtles—nothing is not stolen. Yet grain, crops, earth, timber, birds, beasts, fish, and turtles are all born of heaven. How can they be mine alone? Yet in stealing from heaven, I incur no misfortune.\n\nGold, jade, precious treasures, grain, silk, wealth, and goods are what men amass. How can they be granted by heaven?

They went to consult Master Dongguo, who said: \"Is not your very body itself a theft? You steal the harmony of yin and yang to complete your life, to bear your form. How much more so for external things—are they not also stolen? Indeed, heaven, earth, and the myriad things do not stand apart. To claim possession of them is all delusion.\n\nThe Guo family’s theft is the public Way, and thus incurs no misfortune. Your theft arises from private desire, and thus you are punished. Where there is public and private, there is theft. Where there is neither public nor private, there is also theft. The interplay of public and private is the virtue of heaven and earth. One who understands the virtue of heaven and earth—who can say what is theft and what is not?\n\nTo take what is not yours is all theft. Some, through the public Way, incur no misfortune; others, through private desire, are punished. The difference lies only in whether one is burdened by attachment to possession or the illusion of ownership.\n\nYet those who distinguish public and private cannot escape desire, and thus it is said: where there is public and private, there is theft. Those who transcend public and private cannot forget entirely, and thus it is said: where there is neither public nor private, there is also theft. To embrace both public and private, to follow nature without contrivance—this is to hold all things in one’s embrace, and this is called the virtue of heaven and earth. One who understands this dissolves all distinctions and enters great unity. Though things differ in form, they harmonize with heaven and earth. How could I discern their distinctions?\"\n\nThus concludes the chapter \"Heavenly Omens.\"\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Virtue of the Vacuous and Subtle True Scripture*, Scroll One, Complete.\n*Explication of the Perfect Virtue of the Vacuous and Subtle True Scripture*, Scroll Two.",

      "translated_text": "Emperor Huizong of Song annotates: Among the ancients who illuminated the great Dao, the first priority was to clarify Heaven, followed by the Dao and virtue. *Liezi* begins with the \"Heavenly Omens\" chapter and follows it with \"The Yellow Emperor.\"\n\nIn the fifteenth year of his reign, the Yellow Emperor rejoiced that all under heaven supported him. He nurtured his proper destiny, delighted his ears and eyes, and satisfied his nose and mouth—yet his complexion grew sallow and dull, and his five senses became clouded and confused. Another fifteen years passed, and he grew anxious that all under heaven remained ungoverned. He exhausted his wisdom and strength, laboring for the myriad people—yet again his complexion grew sallow and dull, and his five senses became clouded and confused.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor then sighed in lament, saying: \"My excesses have been grievous. Nurturing only myself brings such calamity; governing the myriad things brings the same.\" Thereupon, he relinquished all affairs of state, abandoned his palace chambers, dismissed his attendants, silenced the bells, and reduced his meals. Withdrawing, he dwelled in seclusion in the Hall of the Great Court, purifying his heart and disciplining his form. For three months, he did not attend to governance.\n\nOne day, as he dozed, he dreamed of wandering in the land of Huaxu. The perfected do not allow things to burden their forms, nor their forms to burden their hearts. Above, they wander with the Creator; below, they befriend those beyond life and death, without beginning or end. Neither sorrow nor joy alters their state—what calamity could then arise? Thus, the Yellow Emperor cast off the burdens of the myriad things and sought to return to the One. Therefore, he purified his heart and disciplined his form, dreaming of wandering in the land of Huaxu.\n\nThe land of Huaxu lies west of Yan Prefecture and north of Tai Prefecture. Its distance from the Qi capital spans thousands of miles—beyond the reach of boats, carriages, or foot travel, accessible only through spiritual wandering. In that land, there are no teachers or rulers; all unfolds naturally. Its people have no desires or cravings; all arises spontaneously. Unaware of the joy of life or the dread of death, they know no premature demise. Unaware of attachment to self or detachment from things, they harbor no love or hatred. Unaware of defiance or compliance, they perceive no benefit or harm. They cherish nothing, fear nothing. They enter water yet do not drown; they enter fire yet do not burn. Blows and strikes cause no pain; prodding and scratching bring no itch. They tread the void as if walking on solid ground, rest in emptiness as if lying on a bed. Clouds and mist do not obstruct their vision; thunder and lightning do not disturb their hearing. Beauty and ugliness do not unsettle their hearts; mountains and valleys do not hinder their steps. They move only through the spirit.\n\nWest of Yan Prefecture and north of Tai Prefecture, thousands of miles from the Qi capital, the Dao of that land is profound and boundless. Thus, only those who wander in spirit can reach it. Without teachers or rulers, it governs itself; without desires or cravings, it is self-sufficient. Life and death do not alter their state; closeness and distance do not burden their bodies. They do not seek benefit, yet benefit does not come; they do not shun harm, yet harm does not arrive. They cherish nothing, fear nothing, and their hearts forget all. They enter water yet do not drown; they enter fire yet do not burn. Blows and strikes cause no pain; prodding and scratching bring no itch. Their forms are unencumbered. They tread the void and rest in emptiness, unobstructed and unobstructing. Wherever they go, they are unhurried. Thus, they traverse the realms of yin and yang, beyond human comprehension—how much more so for mortals? It is called \"spiritual wandering.\"\n\nUpon awakening, the Yellow Emperor felt joyful and content. He summoned Tian Lao, Li Mu, and Tai Shan Ji and said to them: \"For three months, I dwelled in seclusion, purifying my heart and disciplining my form, seeking the Dao of nurturing the body and governing things, yet I found no method. Exhausted, I slept and dreamed thus. Now I understand: the supreme Dao cannot be sought through emotion. I have grasped it; I have attained it—but I cannot convey it to you.\"\n\nTwenty-eight years later, all under heaven was well-governed, nearly resembling the land of Huaxu. Then the Emperor ascended in transcendence. *Jia* should be read as *xia* (\"departed\"); the people mourned him for over two hundred years without cease.\n\nThose who labor their forms and agitate their hearts, relying on knowledge and debate, fail to attain the Dao. Those who purify their hearts and discipline their forms, awakening to the obscure, succeed in attaining it. Though the Dao has essence and sincerity, it is without action or form. Thus, the supreme Dao cannot be sought through emotion. Those who know and attain it cannot convey it to others.\n\nMount Liegu in the midst of the sea and rivers is home to divine beings. They inhale the wind and drink the dew, partaking not of the five grains. Their hearts are like deep springs; their forms, like maidens. They neither cling nor love, yet immortals and sages serve as their ministers. They neither fear nor rage, yet the sincere and earnest act as their envoys. They neither bestow nor favor, yet all things are self-sufficient. They neither hoard nor accumulate, yet they lack nothing. Yin and yang are ever harmonious; sun and moon ever bright. The four seasons proceed in order; wind and rain are ever balanced. Nurturing and birth occur in due time; the harvests are ever abundant. The land knows no blight; the people, no premature death or misfortune. Things bear no blemish or pestilence; ghosts emit no eerie sounds.\n\nThe divine transcends all things in wondrous expression. Those who embody the divine’s wonder exist beyond form and number, thus they overcome things without burden. Inhaling wind and drinking dew, partaking not of the five grains, they are unconcerned with sustenance. With hearts like deep springs and forms like maidens, they are serene and undivided. Neither clinging nor loving, immortals and sages serve as their ministers. Neither fearing nor raging, the sincere and earnest act as their envoys—they align with the Dao and proceed in harmony. Thus, they act with ease and non-action, and yin and yang are harmonious and still. The multitude of beings remains unharmed. Therefore, they neither bestow nor favor, neither hoard nor accumulate. Yin and yang are harmonious; the four seasons proceed in order. Nurturing and birth occur in due time; the harvests are abundant. The people know no premature death or misfortune; things bear no blemish or pestilence; ghosts emit no eerie sounds. This is how the sage subtly completes the myriad things without omission.\n\nLiezi studied under Master Lao Shang and befriended Bo Gaozi. Advancing in the Dao of these two masters, he rode the wind and returned home. The classic states: \"One who excels in movement leaves no tracks.\" Though one who rides the wind leaves no visible traces, they still depend on something.",

      "translated_text": "Only the spirit arrives without moving. Upon hearing this, Yin Sheng followed Liezi and lived with him, yet for months he did not return to his own dwelling. During a moment of leisure, he repeatedly entreated Liezi to teach him the art, but after ten requests, Liezi refused ten times. Yin Sheng grew resentful and asked to leave, yet Liezi gave no response. Yin Sheng withdrew. Months later, his discontent unabated, he returned to follow Liezi again. Liezi said, \"Why do you come and go so frequently?\" Yin Sheng replied, \"Formerly, I earnestly sought your instruction, but you refused to teach me, leaving me with lingering resentment. Now, my mind is suddenly at ease, so I have returned.\" Liezi said, \"Before, I took you for someone enlightened, but now your vulgarity has reached this point? Ji will tell you what I learned from my master. Three questions met with no answer; ten requests went unanswered—this is because the Dao fundamentally cannot be spoken. In the end, when I did receive instruction, it was only what my master had learned from his own teacher. Since I began serving my master and befriending such men, after three years, my heart dared not entertain judgments of right and wrong, nor my mouth speak of profit and harm. Only then did my master deign to glance at me once. After five years, my heart again pondered right and wrong, my mouth again spoke of profit and harm, and my master first relaxed his expression and smiled. After seven years, I followed my heart’s inclinations without right or wrong; I followed my mouth’s words without profit or harm. Only then did my master draw me to sit beside him on the same mat. After nine years, my heart roamed freely in thought, my mouth spoke freely in words, yet I knew not whether my judgments of right and wrong, profit and harm were mine or another’s. I knew not whether my master was my teacher or those men my friends. Within and without, I had advanced. Thereafter, my eyes were as ears, my ears as nose, my nose as mouth—all were the same. My mind congealed, my form dissolved, bones and flesh wholly merged. I no longer sensed the body’s support or the feet’s tread, drifting east and west with the wind like a withered leaf or dry husk. Did the wind ride me, or did I ride the wind? After three years without confusion, I first earned my master’s glance. After five years without obstruction, I reached the point of his smile. After seven years without encumbrance, he drew me to sit beside him. After nine years, when right and wrong, profit and harm could no longer bind me, self and other were forgotten, the five senses interpenetrated, and the wind bore me or I bore the wind—what room was there for deliberation?\n\nNow you, dwelling at your teacher’s gate for barely a season, have grown resentful and aggrieved again and again. Your limbs will not bear the qi, your joints will not be borne by the earth. How can one who treads the void and rides the wind hope to approach this? Yin Sheng was deeply ashamed, held his breath for a long while, and dared not speak further. One who attains the Dao forgets the heart—how much more so resentment and grievance? If your limbs cannot bear qi and your joints cannot be borne by the earth, then your body will no longer be your own. How then can you possess the Dao?\"\n\nLiezi asked Guan Yin, \"The perfected person moves through water without obstruction, treads fire without heat, walks above the myriad things without fear. May I ask how one reaches this state?\" Guan Yin replied, \"This is the preservation of pure qi, not the rank of cunning, skill, or boldness. Ji Yu will tell you. Ji Yu should read: 'Ji Wu.' All that has form, sound, or appearance is merely thing—how can things be distant from one another? Why should one strive to surpass them? They are but form. Thus, the Dao creates what is formless and abides where there is no transformation. One who attains this and exhausts it—how can they be considered correct? They dwell in measure without depth, conceal themselves in principles without origin, and wander through the beginning and end of the myriad things. Unifying their nature, nourishing their qi, embracing their virtue, they merge with the source of all things. Such a one’s heavenly endowment remains whole, their spirit without flaw—how could things enter them?\n\nConsider the drunkard who falls from a cart: though the fall is swift, he does not die. His bones and joints are the same as others’, yet the harm he suffers differs because his spirit is whole. He is unaware of riding or falling. Life and death, terror and dread do not enter his breast, so he encounters things without fear. If one preserved by wine can be thus, how much more one preserved by Heaven? The sage hides in Heaven, so nothing can harm them. The perfected person is divine. 'Pure' means their spirit remains unblemished. The Dao of purity and simplicity guards only the spirit. Guard it without loss, and you become one with the spirit. Thus it is said: The perfected person moves through water without obstruction, treads fire without heat, walks above the myriad things without fear. This is the preservation of pure qi, not the rank of cunning, skill, or boldness.\n\nForm, appearance, sound, and color have names and realities. Once names and realities exist, they cling to movement and stillness. Once they receive their completion, the form does not forget until its end. How then can one surpass them and alone reach what is prior? As a thing, the Dao creates what is formless and does not pair with things. It abides where there is no origin or transformation, standing independent and ungoverned by things. If form, color, name, and sound are insufficient to grasp its essence, then one who attains this and exhausts it—how can they be considered correct? The perfected person, in this, dwells in measure without excess, acting appropriately without overreaching. Concealed in principles without origin, they move without exhaustion. Wandering through the beginning and end of the myriad things, they roam with the Creator. Unifying their nature without division, nourishing their qi without depletion, embracing their virtue without dispersion, they merge with the source of all things—what is called creating the formless and abiding where there is no transformation. Their heavenly endowment remains whole, their spirit without flaw—how could things enter them? This is how they move through water without obstruction, tread fire without heat, walk above the myriad things without fear.\"",

He loosed the arrows, the arrowheads overlapping, the shafts following one after another. At that moment, he was like a wooden figure.

      "translated_text": "Hesheng, a senior retainer of the Fan clan, went on a journey and passed beyond the fields. He lodged at the cottage of Tian Geng Shangqiu Kai. (Note: *Tian Geng* should be read as *an old field hand*.) In the dead of night, Hesheng and Zibo spoke of Zihua’s fame and influence—how he could make the living perish and the dead live again, turn the rich into paupers and the poor into the wealthy.\n\nShangqiu Kai, who had long suffered from hunger and cold, had been eavesdropping from behind the north window. Seizing the chance, he borrowed provisions and a basket, then presented himself at Zihua’s gate. Zihua’s followers were all from noble families, clad in white silk, riding in grand carriages, strolling with leisurely strides and haughty gazes. When they saw Shangqiu Kai—old, frail, his face darkened by sun and wind, his robes and cap disheveled—they all sneered. Soon they grew bolder, mocking and deceiving him, shoving and striking, sparing no indignity. Yet Shangqiu Kai never showed the slightest anger, while the others, their tricks exhausted, grew weary of their own taunts.\n\nThen they ascended a high terrace, and one of them declared before the crowd: *\"Whoever can leap from here will be rewarded with a hundred gold pieces.\"* All clamored to accept. Shangqiu Kai, taking the words as true, leapt first—his body like a soaring bird, landing lightly on the ground without the slightest injury. The Fan clan’s followers dismissed it as mere luck and thought nothing of it.\n\nNext, they pointed to a secluded bend in the river and said: *\"There is a treasure pearl in those depths. Dive in, and you may retrieve it.\"* Shangqiu Kai dove in without hesitation. When he emerged, he indeed held a pearl. The crowd was now filled with doubt.\n\nZihua then ordered that Shangqiu Kai be given meat to eat and silk to wear. Soon after, a great fire broke out in the Fan clan’s treasury. Zihua said: *\"Whoever can enter the flames and retrieve the brocade will be rewarded according to what they bring back.\"* Shangqiu Kai showed no hesitation, walking into the fire and returning unscathed—no soot clung to him, no singeing touched his flesh. The Fan clan’s followers now believed him to be a man of the Dao, and they bowed in apology: *\"We did not know you were a man of the Dao and thus deceived you. We did not know you were a spirit and thus humiliated you. You must think us fools, deaf, blind! Pray, tell us of your Way.\"*\n\nShangqiu Kai replied: *\"I possess no Dao. Even in my own heart, I do not know how this comes to be. Yet since you ask, let me try to speak of it.\"*",

Though they were wounded and broken before him, he paid no heed. Day and night, he made this his amusement, until the state nearly became accustomed to such ways.",

      "translated_text": "Once, when the two guests lodged at my house, I heard them praise the power of the Fan clan, saying it could make the living perish and the dead live, the rich poor and the poor rich. I believed them wholeheartedly, without doubt, and so I came without hesitation. Upon arriving, I took their words as truth, fearing only that my belief might not be sincere enough or my actions not swift enough. I knew not where to place my body or where profit and harm lay—my heart was simply one. Things did not resist me; it was just like this.\n\nNow that I know their words deceived me, I harbor suspicion within and display caution without, clinging to the luck of not having been burned or drowned before. My heart grows hot with shame, and I tremble with fear. How could I dare approach water or fire again?\n\nAfter this, the followers of the Fan clan dared not insult even beggars or horse-doctors they met on the road, but would alight from their carriages and bow to them.\n\nZai Wo heard of this and told Confucius. Confucius said: *\"Do you not understand? A man of perfect sincerity can move things, stir heaven and earth, move ghosts and spirits, traverse the six directions, and meet no resistance—how could it be merely treading peril or entering water and fire? Shangqiu Kai believed in false things and yet met no resistance; how much more so when both parties are sincere? Remember this, my disciples. Sincerity gives rise to spirit, and when spirit is whole, it is the Way of the sage, who embraces spirit and wanders freely. Among the common folk, when purity and wholeness prevail, schemes, profit, and cunning are forgotten. When a man’s heart is untouched by thoughts of life and death, fear and dread, he may oppose things yet feel no terror, walk above the myriad things yet feel no trembling. If one deceives him with falsehood, and he responds with sincerity, where can he not go? Thus Shangqiu Kai climbed a high tower and threw himself down, yet his flesh and bones suffered no harm; he swam to a bend in the river and indeed obtained a pearl; he entered fire and returned without soot clinging to his body. That he was not burned was due to sincerity. The Way of perfect sincerity enters and unites with spirit, leaving no thought for the body’s place or where profit and harm lie, and so it can overcome things without being harmed. Thus a drunken man may fall from a carriage yet suffer no injury, and the Yellow Emperor lost his dark pearl only to have Xiangwang retrieve it. As for treading fire without feeling heat, Guan Yin surely took it to be the preservation of pure qi. But if cunning resides in the heart, then purity and wholeness are incomplete. When purity and wholeness are incomplete, spirit is unsettled, and the Way cannot bear it. Thus, when Shangqiu Kai realized their deception, his relief at not having been burned or drowned turned to trembling fear, and he could no longer approach water or fire—because cunning had arisen in his heart, and doubt had taken root. The distance between believing in falsehood with sincerity and concealing suspicion with insincerity is thus vast. As for the man of perfect sincerity, he surpasses even this. He can move heaven and earth, stir ghosts and spirits, traverse the six directions, and meet no resistance—how could it be merely treading peril or entering water and fire?\"*\n\nKing Xuan of Zhou had a herdsman named Liang Yang, a servant who could raise wild birds and beasts. He would scatter food in the gardens and courtyards, and even tigers, wolves, eagles, and ospreys would grow gentle. Male and female would gather before him, breeding and forming flocks; different species would dwell together without attacking or biting one another. The king, fearing the art would die with Liang Yang, ordered Mao Qiuyuan to learn it from him. Liang Yang said: *\"I am but a lowly servant—what art could I teach you? I fear the king will think I am hiding something from you. Let me tell you my method for raising tigers. All creatures with blood and qi rejoice when obeyed and rage when opposed—this is their nature. But do their joy and anger arise without cause? They are provoked by opposition. When feeding a tiger, one must not give it living prey, for it will kill in anger; nor whole prey, for it will tear it apart in anger. One must time its hunger and satiety, understand its anger—though tigers and humans are different species, they fawn upon those who raise them because they are obeyed. To kill them is to oppose them. So how could I dare oppose them and provoke their anger? Yet I do not obey them to make them happy. For joy inevitably turns to anger, and anger to joy—both are extremes. Now my heart holds neither opposition nor obedience, so the birds and beasts regard me as one of their own. Thus those that roam my gardens do not long for distant forests and open marshes; those that rest in my courtyards do not yearn for deep mountains and secluded valleys—this is the natural principle. The softest thing in the world gallops through the hardest—this is how the sage achieves great victory. Tigers and wolves are the fiercest of beasts; eagles and ospreys the most rapacious of birds. Different species dwell together without attacking or biting, content within the gardens and courtyards—this is because the method of taming and training them is grounded in the Way. The nature of life and destiny is at peace when obeyed. Joy and anger, when excessive, disrupt yin and yang. To oppose them and provoke anger—is this not contrary to the nature of life and destiny? Thus, when raising tigers, one must time their hunger and satiety, understand their anger—all to obey the nature of their life and destiny. How could I dare oppose them and provoke anger, which would violate their nature? Nor do I obey them to make them happy, which would indulge their nature. For joy inevitably turns to anger, and anger to joy—both are excesses of the Way. Now my heart holds neither opposition nor obedience, so I neither violate their nature by provoking anger nor indulge it by making them happy. Their contentment and ease are fitting. The sage’s way of nurturing life does not allow likes and dislikes to harm the body internally. Extending this to nurturing the myriad things and harmonizing the world—what other method is there? It is just this.\"*\n\nYan Hui asked Confucius: *\"I once crossed the deep abyss of Shang, and the ferryman handled the boat as if he were a spirit.\"*",

He saw a man swimming there and thought him one in distress, seeking death. He sent his disciples along the current to rescue him.

When I saw you treading it, I thought you were in distress, seeking death, and sent my disciples along the current to save you. Yet you emerged, loosened your hair, and sang. I took you for a ghost, but seeing you are a man, I ask: Is there a Dao to treading water?\"*\n\nThe man said: *\"No. I have no Dao.

      "translated_text": "Emperor Huizong of the Song annotated:\n\nWhen Confucius traveled to Chu, he passed through a forest and saw a hunchbacked old man catching cicadas with a pole as effortlessly as if he were plucking them by hand. Confucius said, \"You are skillful indeed! Is there a Dao to this?\"\n\nThe old man replied, \"I have my Dao. After five or six months of practice, if I stack two pellets on the pole without them falling, I lose only a few cicadas; if I stack three without them falling, I lose only one in ten; if I stack five without them falling, it is as easy as plucking them by hand. When I stand, I am as still as a tree stump; when I hold my arm, it is as steady as a withered branch. Though the world is vast and the myriad things are many, I am aware of nothing but the cicada’s wings. I do not turn aside or waver, nor do I allow the myriad things to distract me from the cicada’s wings—how could I fail to succeed?\"\n\nConfucius turned to his disciples and said, \"When the will is undivided, it approaches the divine.\" This is what the hunchbacked old man meant.\n\nThe old man said, \"You, a scholar in fine robes, what do you know of such matters? First cultivate your own foundation, then you may speak of higher things. Concentration of will is called *essence*. One who is refined in the Dao can achieve anything. Standing as still as a tree stump, holding the arm as steady as a withered branch, one becomes motionless and forgets one’s own form. Though the world is vast and the myriad things are many, one is aware of nothing but the cicada’s wings. Without turning aside or wavering, without allowing the myriad things to distract from the cicada’s wings, the mind is single and unshaken, and external disturbances vanish. The longer one’s focus endures, the fewer the losses. Thus, at first, one loses only a few; with time, one loses only one in ten; and with even more time, it is as easy as plucking them by hand. There is no other reason—it is simply the concentration of will. Concentration of will is called *essence*; only the utmost essence can penetrate all things and attain the utmost spirit. Hence it is said: *When the will is undivided, it approaches the divine.*\"\n\nThere was a man from the seashore who loved gulls. Every morning, he went to the sea and followed the gulls, and hundreds of gulls would gather around him. His father said, \"I hear the gulls all follow you—bring some back so I may play with them.\" The next day, when he went to the sea, the gulls danced above him but would not land. Thus it is said: *The utmost words transcend words; the utmost action is non-action.* What the wisdom of the world knows is but shallow.\n\nThe ancients who possessed the Dao abandoned cunning and forgot scheming; their purity was complete within. Thus, when they entered the midst of beasts, the herds were not disturbed; when they entered the midst of birds, the flocks were not scattered. Birds and beasts did not fear them—how much less would humans? This is because their minds were fundamentally empty, and things naturally trusted them. If purity is not unalloyed, then cunning and scheming arise, and thus birds take flight to avoid the harm of nets and arrows. The gulls danced above but would not land because before, the man had abandoned cunning, but now he relied on it.\n\nThe sage does not govern the state with cleverness. When he speaks, his words are free from the entanglements of speech; when he acts, his actions leave no trace of effort. What the wisdom of the world knows is but shallow.\n\nWhen Viscount Xiang of Zhao led a hundred thousand men to hunt in Zhongshan, they set fire to the forest, and the flames spread for a hundred *li*. A man emerged from a stone cliff, moving up and down with the smoke and embers. The crowd thought him a ghost. After the fire passed, he walked out slowly, as if untouched by what he had endured. The Viscount detained him in wonder and observed him closely: his form, complexion, and seven apertures were those of a man; his breath and voice were those of a man. He asked, \"By what Dao did you dwell in the stone? By what Dao did you enter the fire?\"\n\nThe man replied, \"What do you call stone? What do you call fire?\"\n\nThe Viscount said, \"What you just emerged from was stone; what you just passed through was fire.\"\n\nThe man said, \"I do not know.\"\n\nMarquis Wen of Wei heard of this and asked Zixia, \"What sort of man was he?\"\n\nZixia said, \"From what I have heard of the Master’s teachings, one who is in harmony is at one with all things, and nothing can harm or obstruct him. He may wander through metal and stone or tread through water and fire—all is possible.\"\n\nThe Marquis said, \"Why do you not do this?\"\n\nZixia said, \"To carve out the heart and discard cleverness—I have not yet attained this. Nevertheless, I shall tell you when I have leisure.\"\n\nThe Marquis said, \"Why does the Master not do this?\"\n\nZixia said, \"The Master is capable but chooses not to act.\"\n\nThe Marquis was greatly pleased.\n\nWhen the mind is in darkness with the Dao, it is one with it, never having been separate. When form follows the changes of things, the ten thousand transformations are never not distinct. When self and things stand opposed, they divide into two categories. Harmonizing them with the natural boundary of Heaven, why seek to distinguish them? Self and things share the same root; that and this are one. Without the contrast of emptiness and fullness, how could anything obstruct one’s entry into stone cliffs? Without the friction of benefit and harm, how could anything injure one amidst smoke and embers? Thus it is said: *One who is in harmony is at one with all things, and nothing can harm him. One who is obstructed may wander through metal and stone or tread through water and fire—all is possible.*\n\nZixia knew this but had not yet attained it; the Master was capable but chose not to act. The Dao is not something those with intent can grasp from afar, nor is it something those without intent can draw near. Thus, Zixia said of this, \"To carve out the heart and discard cleverness—I have not yet attained this.\" The sage conceals himself in Heaven and does not display his abilities, so the Master’s ability to act yet choice not to is truly so. Those who laboriously wander through metal and stone or tread through water and fire, believing themselves to possess the Dao, set their Dao against the world, making it something others can point to and discuss. Thus, in *Liezi*, after examining the teachings of various masters, the text reveres the Master as the most complete.\n\nA divine diviner from Qi arrived in Zheng and was named Ji Xian. He could foretell a person’s death or life, survival or ruin, fortune or misfortune, longevity or early demise, predicting the year, month, ten-day period, or day with divine accuracy. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled. When Liezi saw him, he was enchanted and returned to tell Master Huqiu, saying, \"At first, I thought your Dao was the ultimate—now I see there is something even more ultimate.\"",

      "translated_text": "Master Huqiu said: \"I have shown you only the outward forms of the Dao, not yet its true substance—how could you truly have attained the Way? A flock of hens without a rooster—how could they produce eggs? You set your Dao against the world and make it something verifiable, so naturally others can appraise you. This is explained in the *Zhuangzi*. Bring him here tomorrow and let me show myself to him.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Master Huqiu. When they emerged, Ji Xian said to Liezi: \"Alas! Your master is already dead—he cannot live. He will not last ten days. I see something strange in him, like damp ashes.\"\n\nLiezi entered, weeping so that his tears soaked his bedding, and told Master Huqiu. The Master said: \"Just now I showed him the patterned stillness of earth. Did *Zhuangzi* not speak of ‘unshaken and unceasing’? This is likely how he saw my sealed virtue at its subtlest. Strange appearances are not constant, and damp ashes do not rekindle. The utmost person moves the pivot of the Dao within the boundless, so that neither ‘this’ nor ‘that’ can find its counterpart. When the mechanism of virtue is sealed and does not activate, one’s responses seem to have lost their partner—thus I showed him the patterned stillness of earth. Seeing my sealed virtue at its subtlest, he declared me already dead. Earth shares its virtue with yin, yet their affairs differ in pattern: one is still, the other manifest. Hence ‘unshaken and unceasing.’ ‘Unshaken’ means not stirred; ‘unceasing’ means not fixed. Bring him again tomorrow.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Master Huqiu again. When they emerged, Ji Xian said to Liezi: \"Fortunate that your master met me! He is recovering. There is life in the ashes now—I see the sealed mechanism at work.\"\n\nLiezi entered and told Master Huqiu. The Master said: \"Just now I showed him the expanse of heaven and earth. Names and realities did not enter, yet the subtlest movement arose from the heels—this is the sealed mechanism at work. This is likely how he saw the subtlest stirrings of my goodness. The ‘life in the ashes’ may be interpreted as the presence of vitality within what was not rekindled. Earlier, seeing damp ashes, the sense of life had already vanished. Once extinguished, it was gone—hence he thought me dead. Now, seeing the sealed mechanism at work, the function of movement is still concealed. Yet since movement has already begun, he thought me alive. I showed him the expanse of heaven and earth—earth is soil that nurtures growth. What is ordained by heaven finds its nurturance here, hence ‘heaven and earth.’ When names and realities do not intrude, the true and the illusory merge. When the mechanism arises from the heels, it is the origin of nurturance—this is why it is called the sealed mechanism at work. The Dao cannot be seen, yet its continuation appears thus—hence he likely saw the subtlest stirrings of my goodness. Bring him again tomorrow.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Master Huqiu once more. Ji Xian said: \"Your master is not in a state of fasting—there is nothing I can appraise. Let him fast until dawn, and I will appraise him again.\"\n\nLiezi entered and told Master Huqiu. The Master said: \"Just now I showed him the Great Thoroughfare without trace. This is likely how he saw the balanced qi at its subtlest. The whirlpool of the salamander becomes an abyss; the still water’s whirlpool becomes an abyss; the flowing water’s whirlpool becomes an abyss; the overflowing water’s whirlpool becomes an abyss; the surging water’s whirlpool becomes an abyss; the spring water’s whirlpool becomes an abyss; the dammed water’s whirlpool becomes an abyss; the Ji River’s whirlpool becomes an abyss; the Fei River’s whirlpool becomes an abyss—these are the nine abysses. The patterned stillness of earth is yin overcoming yang; the expanse of heaven and earth is yang overcoming yin. As for the Great Thoroughfare, it contains both yin and yang yet is neither yin nor yang—hence ‘the Great Thoroughfare without trace.’ *Zhen* is the omen of spirit in things, unfathomable in its yin and yang—thus no trace can be found. Moreover, the Thoroughfare is the intersection of yin and yang. The Great Thoroughfare without trace reveals only perfect equilibrium—hence it is called the balanced qi at its subtlest. The alternation of yin and yang, intersecting without trace, can be understood through the nine abysses. *Pan* means the reversal of flow. Only by reversing flow can wholeness be preserved—this is why each whirlpool becomes an abyss. The whirlpool of the salamander’s spiral becomes an abyss, illustrating wholeness in utmost movement; the still water’s whirlpool becomes an abyss, illustrating wholeness in potential stillness; flowing water illustrates emergence. When it overflows and mingles with things, emergence is excessive. Surging water illustrates entry—when it saturates things, entry is exhausted. The dammed water, having emerged, returns—this differs from the exhaustion of entry. The Ji River, having emerged, does not flow—this differs from the return. The Fei River emerges differently but returns to the same—thus the reversal of flow preserves wholeness, and its meaning is fully expressed here. Yet *Zhuangzi* mentions only three, for when divided they are nine, and when united they are three—their essence is one. Bring him again tomorrow.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Master Huqiu once more. Before Ji Xian could steady himself, he lost his composure and fled. Master Huqiu said: \"Pursue him.\" Liezi chased him but could not catch up. Returning, he reported to Master Huqiu: \"He has vanished, disappeared—I could not reach him.\"\n\nMaster Huqiu said: \"Just now I showed him what has never yet departed from my source. I met him with emptiness and effortless change, not knowing who or what he was. He took me for drifting reeds, for flowing waves—hence he fled.\"\n\nAfter this, Liezi considered himself as one who had never yet begun to learn. He returned home and did not go out for three years. He cooked for his wife, ate the food of pigs, treated all matters with equal detachment, carved and polished only to return to simplicity, stood alone like a clod of earth, and remained sealed and whole to the end.\n\nWhat has never yet departed from my source—this is how the sage takes heaven as his source and conceals himself within it. Thus he has never yet departed from my source. (See *Zhuangzi* commentary.)\n\nOn his way to Qi, Liezi turned back halfway. He encountered Bohun Wuren, who asked: \"Why have you returned?\" Liezi said: \"I was startled. By what?\"",

Those porridge-sellers merely peddle their wares for a living, with no great profit to spare. Their gains are meager, their influence slight—yet even they behave thus. How much more so a lord of ten thousand chariots, whose body is wearied by the state and whose wisdom is exhausted by affairs? If he were to entrust me with tasks and demand results, I would have cause to be startled.\n\nThe utmost person of antiquity, clear and plain, returned to simplicity through non-action. The heavenly mechanism remained unstrung, silently harmonizing with the Dao. Vague as if absent yet present, effortless as if formless yet spirit-filled—then few would know me, and I would be truly esteemed. If inner sincerity is not dissolved, the heart cannot be forgotten. If the body’s subtlety radiates outward, the form cannot be transcended. Overawing others’ hearts, making them slight the noble and aged while prizing oneself, wearied in body by the state, and exhausting one’s wisdom in affairs—then the pain of sorrow and the ease of joy will alternately afflict the body, while the fear of coercion and the delight of caution will flood the heart. With such concerns pressing, how could one not be startled?\"\n\nBohun Wuren said: \"Excellent insight!

      "translated_text": "\"It is not that you can make others safeguard you, but that you cannot prevent them from doing so—why then rely on such influence? Influence breeds premeditated responses, and premeditation yields anomalies.\n\nMoreover, if one must be influenced, it is to shake the very foundation of one’s being—what meaning does that hold? Those who wander with you offer no warning; their petty words are all poison to others. With no awakening and no realization, how can one discern what truly matters?\n\nHow excellent is this observation! It praises one’s ability to turn inward. When you conduct yourself thus, you are instructed to retreat and conceal. The perfected person embraces the spirit and roams amidst the mundane, allowing no one to glimpse their depths—this is what it means to conduct oneself. If you do not conduct yourself thus, others will safeguard you. Yet their safeguarding is not what we mean by ‘allowing no glimpse.’\n\nThus, only after being influenced does one respond; not seeking distinction is the very way to prevent others from safeguarding you. Premeditation leads to response after influence, while seeking distinction leads to the pursuit of anomaly. In such cases, not only do others indeed safeguard you, revealing your dependence on them, but you must also be influenced, shaking the foundation of your being, inevitably burdened by external things.\n\nThose who wander with you offer no warning, so you remain unaware. If their petty words are all poison to others, how can they not bring harm? Without awakening and without realization, how can one long abide in the Way? Thus, what comparison can be made? ‘Comparison’ here means mutual transformation through prolonged exposure.\n\nYang Zhu traveled south to Pei, while Lao Dan journeyed west to Qin, meeting by chance in the outskirts. When they reached Liang, they encountered Laozi. Midway, Laozi looked up to the heavens and sighed: ‘At first, I thought you could be taught, but now I see you cannot.’ Yang Zhu made no reply. Upon reaching the lodging, he washed his hands and face, combed his hair, removed his sandals outside the door, and advanced on his knees, saying: ‘Earlier, Master, you looked up to the heavens and sighed, saying, “At first, I thought you could be taught, but now I see you cannot.” Your disciple wished to ask for an explanation, but your journey afforded no pause, so I dared not speak. Now that you have paused, may I inquire as to my fault?’\n\nLaozi said: ‘Your haughty gaze and arrogant bearing—with whom could you dwell? The purest white appears tarnished; the greatest virtue seems insufficient.’\n\nYang Zhu’s expression changed abruptly, and he said: ‘I respectfully receive your instruction.’\n\nOn his previous journey, when he arrived at a lodging, the host welcomed him, the master of the house laid out the mat, the host’s wife presented the comb and towel, the guests yielded their seats, and the cook left the hearth. On his return, however, the hosts vied with him for seats.\n\nA skilled merchant conceals his wealth as if empty; a noble person of great virtue appears foolish. Those who know me are few, and thus those who emulate me are esteemed. Those who adorn their wisdom to astonish fools, or feign fervor to stand out, who self-promote and self-display—how can they speak of the Dao?\n\nEven Liezi, who had no intention of startling others, was still criticized. How much more so Yang Zhu, who altered his appearance and demeanor to distinguish himself from the crowd—his stubbornness was indeed untamable.\n\n‘The purest white appears tarnished’ means cleansing the profound mirror of perception until not a single flaw is seen; though it bears the world’s filth, it does not cultivate the body to reveal its defilement. ‘The greatest virtue seems insufficient’ means that virtue cannot be surpassed, yet one does not consider oneself excessive—this is what is called ‘the highest virtue does not act as virtue.’\n\nWhen Yang Zhu heard this instruction and departed, the hosts vied for seats—this was nearly the case. For when he first arrived, they welcomed and served him, treating him as extraordinary; upon his return, the hosts vied for seats, showing how lightly they regarded him. Thus, the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within. Therefore, one must abandon that and adopt this.\n\nYang Zhu passed through Song and stayed at an inn in the east. The innkeeper had two concubines: one beautiful, the other ugly. The ugly one was favored, while the beautiful one was slighted. Yang Zhu asked the reason. The innkeeper’s servant replied: ‘The beautiful one is proud of her beauty, so I do not see her as beautiful; the ugly one is ashamed of her ugliness, so I do not see her as ugly.’\n\nYang Zhu said: ‘Take note, disciples: act with virtue but abandon the conduct of self-regard. Wherever you go, will you not be loved?’\n\nFrom the perspective of the Dao, things have no inherent beauty or ugliness. To know beauty as beauty is to set ugliness in opposition. What the world deems beautiful is called wondrous; what it deems ugly is called foul. Yet the wondrous transforms into the foul, and the foul transforms into the wondrous—how then can beauty and ugliness be distinguished? The sage does not cling to right or wrong, beauty or ugliness, but empties the self to wander through the world. Without arrogance or boasting—this is what is meant by ‘acting with virtue but abandoning the conduct of self-regard.’ None in the world contend with such a one in ability, nor in merit. Thus, wherever one goes, will one not be loved?\n\nThe world has a Way that always prevails and a Way that does not always prevail. The Way that always prevails is called softness; the Way that does not always prevail is called strength. Both are known, yet people do not understand them. Thus, the ancients said: ‘Strength first opposes what is not equal to oneself; softness first yields to what surpasses oneself. One who first opposes what is not equal will, upon reaching equality, be imperiled. One who first yields to what surpasses oneself will face no peril. Using this to overcome a single person is like overcoming a multitude; using this to bear the world is like bearing nothing. This is called overcoming without striving and bearing without burden.’\n\nMaster Zhou said: ‘To be firm, one must guard with softness; to be strong, one must preserve with weakness. Accumulating softness leads to firmness; accumulating weakness leads to strength. Observe what is accumulated to know the direction of fortune and misfortune. Strength that prevails over what is not equal to oneself will, upon reaching equality, become brittle. Softness that yields to what surpasses oneself has immeasurable power.’\n\nLao Dan said: ‘When weapons are strong, they perish; when trees are strong, they break. The soft and weak belong to the realm of life; the hard and strong belong to the realm of death.’\n\nOnly the sage can accumulate countless small victories to achieve great triumph. Laozi said: ‘Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet nothing can surpass it in attacking the hard and strong, for nothing can replace it. If something could replace it, one would follow others and lose oneself—how then could one prevail over things?’\"",

Bohun Wuren stood facing north, leaning on his staff and propping his chin. After a while, he departed without a word. The attendant informed Liezi, who rushed barefoot to the gate, sandals in hand, and asked: \"Master, since you have come, have you not neglected your medicine?\"\nBohun Wuren replied: \"It is done. I had already told you: others will safeguard you. And now they truly do.\"",

      "translated_text": "Only because nothing can replace it does it remain constant through ten thousand changes, and nothing can prevail over it. This is called the Way of Perennial Victory. The Way of Perennial Victory is called softness; the Way of Perennial Defeat is called strength. These two are easy to understand, yet people do not grasp them—this is what *Laozi* meant by ‘the soft overcoming the hard, the weak overcoming the strong,’ a truth all under Heaven know but none can practice.\n\nStrength first confronts what is not its equal; softness first yields to what surpasses itself. When strength confronts what is not its equal, it becomes brittle upon meeting its match. When softness yields to what surpasses itself, it faces no peril. For those who contend against the world must encounter their adversaries, while those who are yielding, weak, and humble ride freely through the world’s utmost hardness. This is precisely the meaning.\n\nTo overcome the self as if it were another, or to govern all under Heaven as if it were another—this means that only those who follow the path of softness and weakness can truly bear such tasks. For they do not seek to conquer things but conquer themselves; they do not rely on others but rely on themselves.\n\nWhen armies clash, the side that mourns prevails—thus it is said, ‘When weapons are strong, they perish.’ A sapling of paulownia or catalpa, carpenters all know to nurture; when it grows strong, it is felled and shared—thus it is said, ‘When trees are strong, they break.’\n\nAll things bear yin and embrace yang, blending qi to achieve harmony. Yang’s virtue is to bring forth life; yin’s function is to bring stern destruction. When stern destruction prevails, the harmonious blending of qi is lost. Thus it is said, ‘The soft and weak belong to the realm of life; the hard and strong belong to the realm of death.’\n\nAppearance need not be childlike for wisdom to be childlike; wisdom need not be childlike for appearance to be childlike. The sage embraces childlike wisdom and discards childlike appearance, while the common people cling to childlike appearance and distance themselves from profound wisdom. They draw near and love those whose appearance resembles their own, and distance and fear those whose appearance differs.\n\nThough one may possess a seven-foot frame, distinct hands and feet, hair and teeth, standing and walking—this is called a human; yet humans are not without the hearts of beasts. Even with the hearts of beasts, they are loved for their appearance. Though creatures may bear wings and horns, fangs and claws, flying aloft or crouching to run—these are called birds and beasts; yet birds and beasts are not without human hearts. Even with human hearts, they are distanced for their appearance.\n\nFu Xi, Nü Wa, Shen Nong, and the Xia sovereigns had serpent bodies and human faces, ox heads and tiger noses—these bore non-human forms yet possessed the great virtue of sages. Jie of Xia, Zhou of Yin, Huan of Lu, and Mu of Chu had the seven apertures of human appearance, yet harbored the hearts of beasts. Thus, those who cling to a single appearance in pursuit of supreme wisdom will never attain it.\n\nWhen the Yellow Emperor battled the Flame Emperor at Banquan, he led bears, brown bears, wolves, leopards, boars, and tigers as his vanguard, and eagles, falcons, hawks, and kites as his banners—this was commanding beasts by force. When Yao entrusted Kui with music, striking and tapping stones, a hundred beasts danced in unison; when the *Xiao Shao* melody reached its ninth movement, the phoenix came to pay homage—this was summoning beasts by sound.\n\nIf so, how do the hearts of beasts differ from those of humans? Their forms and sounds differ from humans, yet people do not know how to connect with them. The sage, knowing all and penetrating all, thus draws them near and commands them.\n\nThe wisdom of beasts naturally aligns with humans in some ways. In their shared desires and care for life, they do not borrow wisdom from humans: males and females pair, mothers and children bond; they avoid flatlands and seek perilous heights, shun cold and pursue warmth; when dwelling, they form groups, when moving, they march in ranks; the small stay within, the strong guard without; when drinking, they lead one another, when eating, they call in flocks.\n\nIn the age of great antiquity, they dwelled with humans and walked alongside them. By the time of the Five Emperors, they began to scatter in fear. By the final age, they hid and fled to escape harm.\n\nNow, in the eastern land of Jieshi, there are those who frequently understand the speech of the six domestic animals—this is the partial knowledge they possess. The divine sages of great antiquity fully understood the dispositions of all things and could interpret the sounds of different species. Gathering and assembling them, instructing and receiving them, they made them akin to people.\n\nThus, they first harmonized with ghosts, spirits, and mountain demons, then communicated with the peoples of the eight directions, and finally gathered birds, beasts, insects, and moths. This speaks to the shared hearts and minds of all creatures with blood and qi, which are not so distant.\n\nThe divine sages, knowing this, left nothing untaught in their instruction. Earlier scholars took *tong* (childlike) to mean *same*, but *same* should be understood as the correct interpretation.\n\nIn the age of utmost virtue, all was as if without knowledge, and virtue did not depart; all was as if without desire, and this was called plain simplicity. Thus, they dwelled with birds and beasts, and their kind thrived alongside all things. Birds and beasts could be leashed and walked, and the nests of magpies and crows could be climbed to peer inside. Was this not the way of the Yellow Emperor’s campaign at Banquan and Yao’s summoning of beasts through music?\n\nGe Jielu understood the lowing of cattle. In the time of Zhou, officials were appointed to raise and teach birds and beasts, tame them, and even converse with them, fully comprehending the sounds of different species and gathering, assembling, instructing, and receiving them. Traces of this remain in later ages. *Liezi* lamented the scattering of pure simplicity, tracing the intent of the Dao and virtue, and embedding it in his writings. He sought to transform the decline of cunning and change, elevating society to a realm of pure thickness—thus his words touched upon this.\n\nIn Song there was a man called the Monkey Master who loved monkeys and raised them in troops. He understood the monkeys’ intentions, and the monkeys understood his heart. He reduced his household’s provisions to satisfy the monkeys’ desires. Soon, he faced scarcity and sought to limit their food. Fearing the monkeys would not submit, he first deceived them, saying: ‘I will give you taro—three in the morning and four in the evening. Is that enough?’ The monkeys all rose in anger. After a moment, he said: ‘I will give you taro—four in the morning and three in the evening. Is that enough?’",

      "translated_text": "The monkeys all prostrated themselves in joy.\n\nAll things that are ensnared by cunning and contempt follow this same pattern. The sage ensnares the multitude of fools with wisdom, just as the Monkey Master ensnared the monkeys with his wit. Though names and realities remain unaltered, he causes them to rejoice or rage at will.\n\nThe ancients who were adept in the Way did not seek to enlighten the people but rather to keep them simple. For the people may be made to follow, but they cannot be made to understand. Thus, those skilled in the Way merely cause them to follow, returning to their constant nature. In this way, the Way may be carried and shared with them, without any display of cleverness or artifice.\n\nJi Shengzi reared fighting cocks for King Xuan of Zhou. After ten days, the king asked, “Are the cocks ready to fight?” Ji replied, “Not yet. They are still vain and reliant on their qi.” After another ten days, the king asked again. Ji said, “Not yet. They still react to shadows and movements.” After another ten days, the king inquired once more. Ji answered, “Not yet. They still glare fiercely and bristle with qi.” After another ten days, the king asked again. Ji said, “Nearly so. Though other cocks may crow, they remain unchanged. They now appear like wooden cocks—complete in virtue. No other cock dares respond; they turn and flee.”\n\nThose who excel in overcoming enemies do not contend. Precisely because they do not contend, none in the world can contend with them. To attain stillness, one must calm the qi; to attain spirit, one must follow the heart. This is called the virtue of non-contention. Such a one preserves their heavenly endowment whole, their spirit without flaw—how could external things intrude? Though they may oppose others, they are not intimidated, nor can others harm them. This is the guard of pure qi, not the realm of cleverness, artifice, or boldness. Such is the person of complete virtue.\n\nHui Ang visited King Kang of Song. The king stamped his feet, coughed, and spoke rapidly: “What delights me is courage and strength, not benevolence and righteousness. What instruction do you have for me?” Hui Ang replied, “I possess a method by which, though a man may be brave, his blade will not pierce; though he may be strong, his blows will not strike. Does Your Majesty not wish to hear of it?” The king said, “Excellent. This is what I desire to hear.”\n\nHui Ang continued, “Though his blade does not pierce and his blows do not strike, this is still a form of disgrace. I possess a method by which, though a man may be brave, he will not dare to stab; though he may be strong, he will not dare to strike. Yet this is not because he lacks the will. I possess a method by which he fundamentally lacks the will. Without such will, there is no mind for love or profit. I possess a method by which all men and women in the world joyfully desire to love and benefit one another. This surpasses courage and strength—it is the highest of the four virtues. Does Your Majesty not wish to hear of it?”\n\nThe king said, “This is what I wish to attain.”\n\nHui Ang replied, “Confucius and Mozi embodied this. Though they held no land as rulers nor offices as ministers, all men and women in the world craned their necks and stood on tiptoe, longing to be at peace and benefit under them. Now, Your Majesty is a ruler of ten thousand chariots. If you truly possess this will, all within your four borders will receive its benefit—far surpassing Confucius and Mozi.”\n\nThe king had no reply. Hui Ang hurried out. The king said to his attendants, “How persuasive! The guest has convinced me with his words.”\n\nThe sage’s approach to the world is spirit-like martiality without killing, treasuring compassion as the highest virtue. Thus, benevolence pervades the world, and none do not cherish it; righteousness pervades the world, and none do not submit to it.

      "translated_text": "Emperor Huizong of Song annotates:\n\nKing Mu of Zhou: The Dao has no true or false; things have their \"that\" and \"this.\" Like dreams and waking, confusion arises of itself—only the great sage knows how to unite them as one.\n\nIn the time of King Mu of Zhou, a \"transformed person\" arrived from the far western lands. He entered water and fire unscathed, pierced metal and stone; he reversed mountains and rivers, shifted cities and towns. Riding the void without falling, touching the solid without obstruction, his thousand transformations and ten thousand changes knew no limit. Having altered the forms of things, he also altered men’s thoughts. Does one who knows the Dao of transformation know the workings of the spirit? Unharmed by water or fire, unobstructed by metal or stone, high and low as one, void and solid both forgotten—his thousand transformations and ten thousand changes defied all bounds: this was indeed spirit. Yet spirit is that which subtly pervades the ten thousand things yet cannot be fathomed. To alter the forms of things and change men’s thoughts is merely to exhaust calculations and master change, to follow forms and shift appearances—this is why he is called a \"transformed person.\"\n\nKing Mu revered him as a spirit and served him as a lord. He offered his own bedchamber for the transformed person’s dwelling, presented the three sacrificial animals, and selected female musicians to entertain him. The transformed person deemed the king’s palaces too humble to inhabit, his banquets too rank to partake of, and his consorts too foul to embrace. Thus, the king had them rebuilt: the earthworks and timber construction, the red and white plaster, spared no craftsmanship. The five treasuries were emptied before the terrace was completed. Towering a thousand *ren*, overlooking the summit of Zhongnan, it was named the Terrace of Central Heaven. He selected the most graceful and alluring maidens from Zheng and Wei, anointed them with fragrant oils, painted their brows, adorned them with hairpins and earrings, dressed them in fine linen and trailing skirts, powdered their faces and darkened their eyes, hung jade pendants and rings upon them. He filled the halls with orchids and angelica, and performed *Steaming Clouds*, *Six Radiances*, *Nine Shao*, and *Morning Dew* to delight him. Month after month, jade robes were offered; day after day, jade delicacies were presented. Yet the transformed person remained disdainful and only reluctantly deigned to visit.\n\nWhat the world deems beautiful is called wondrous; what it reviles is called foul. Yet wondrous and foul transform into one another—how then can beauty and ugliness be distinguished? The transformed person found the king’s palaces, banquets, and consorts unacceptable and insisted on rebuilding and selecting anew before visiting. This shows he had not yet transcended the emotions of beauty and ugliness. Thus, King Mu honored him as if he were a spirit, and no more.\n\nBefore long, the transformed person invited the king to journey with him. The king grasped the transformed person’s sleeve, and together they soared upward until they reached the midst of heaven, arriving at the transformed person’s palace. This palace was constructed of gold and silver, inlaid with pearls and jade. It rose above the clouds and rain, its foundations unseen below, appearing like a mass of clouds when viewed from afar. All that the eyes beheld and ears heard, all that the nose inhaled and mouth tasted, were unlike anything in the human realm. The king truly believed it to be the Clear Capital, the Purple Tenuity, the Heaven of Equal Music, the abode of the Emperor. Looking down, he saw his own palaces and pavilions like piled clods and heaps of straw.\n\nThe king, having dwelt there for decades, no longer longed for his kingdom. The transformed person then invited him on another journey. Wherever they went, above there were no sun or moon, below no rivers or seas. The play of light and shadow dazzled the king’s eyes so he could not see; the sounds assailed his ears so he could not hear. His hundred bones and six viscera trembled and could not settle; his mind was bewildered, his essence lost. He begged the transformed person to return.\n\nTo say the king truly believed it the abode of the Emperor—the Clear Capital, the Purple Tenuity, the Heaven of Equal Music—only proves it was not. Built of gold and silver, inlaid with pearls and jade, with sights, sounds, tastes, and scents unlike anything in the human realm, the king forgot his kingdom—such was its delight. Yet where they journeyed, above there were no sun or moon, below no rivers or seas; his eyes could not see, his ears could not hear, his mind was bewildered, his essence lost, and he begged to return—such was its lack of delight. This is what it means to alter the forms of things and change men’s thoughts. The transformed person moved the king as if he were a clod of earth.\n\nUpon waking, the king found himself in the same place as before, with the same attendants. Looking ahead, the wine was still unstrained, the dishes still uneaten. When the king asked where he had been, his attendants replied, \"Your Majesty was in silent meditation.\"\n\nThereafter, King Mu was lost in thought for three months before recovering. When he questioned the transformed person again, the latter said, \"I journeyed in spirit with Your Majesty—how could your form have moved? Moreover, what difference was there between the place we dwelt and your palace? What difference between the places we roamed and your gardens?\" The king was perplexed, doubting whether it had been a fleeting absence.\n\nAt the extremes of transformation, in the space between swift and slow, can all be grasped? When the spirit’s mind is in flux, weaving through the ten thousand directions, the spirit’s journey is swift. In the space between lowering and raising the head, one may caress the lands beyond the four seas—though the body does not move, the mind travels with it.\n\nThe people of the world take what is constantly present as real and what is constantly absent as illusory. Thus, they grow accustomed to what is always there and doubt what is only briefly gone. Clinging to existence and discarding emptiness, they are blinded by partiality, unaware that both \"that\" and \"this\" are equally unreal. If the mind is enlightened to this, what difference is there between the place we dwelt and your palace? What difference between the places we roamed and your gardens?\n\nThe king was overjoyed. He neglected state affairs, took no pleasure in his ministers and consorts, and indulged in distant journeys at will.",

For the second chariot, the right trace horse was *Quhuang* and the left *Yulun*; the left wing horse was *Daoli* and the right *Shanzi*. *Boyao* drove the chariot, *Canbai* served as charioteer, and *Benrong* stood at the right. Racing a thousand *li*, they arrived at the land of the *Jusou* clan. The *Jusou* presented the blood of white swans for the king to drink, and offered the milk of cows and horses to wash the feet of the king and the two chariot crews.\n\nAfter drinking, they set forth and lodged at the slopes of Mount Kunlun, on the northern bank of the Red Water. The next day, they ascended the heights of Kunlun to behold the palace of the Yellow Emperor, and sealed it with earth to bequeath it to later generations. Then they paid homage to the Queen Mother of the West, feasting with her upon the Jasper Pool. The Queen Mother sang for the king, and the king harmonized with her—her song was mournful. They observed the place where the sun sets, covering ten thousand *li* in a single day. The king sighed and said: *\"Alas! I, alone, am deficient in virtue yet in harmony with pleasure. Will later generations recount my faults?\"*\n\nKing Mu was nearly a spirit-like man. Able to exhaust the joys of his own lifetime, though he lived but a hundred years, the world regarded him as having ascended to transcendence. The spirit does not hasten yet is swift; it does not travel yet arrives. King Mu did not understand that the means of entering and exiting the six directions lay within himself, yet he commanded his chariots and steeds, covering ten thousand *li* in a day. Thus, though he reached the land of the *Jusou*, ascended the heights of Kunlun, beheld the palace of the Yellow Emperor, and paid homage to the Queen Mother upon the Jasper Pool, he did not ride the clouds and mist or mount flying dragons to roam beyond the four seas. Therefore, it is said: *\"He was nearly a spirit-like man\"*—meaning he approached the spirit-like yet was not truly so.\n\n*Laochengzi* studied illusion under Master *Yinwen*. For three years, the master did not instruct him. *Laochengzi* begged to know his faults and sought to withdraw. Master *Yinwen* bowed and led him into the chamber, dismissed his attendants, and spoke to him, saying: *\"When the Old Master Laozi departed for the west, he turned to me and said: ‘The qi of the living, the forms of the shaped—all are illusion. That which begins with creation and transforms through yin and yang is called life and death. To exhaust the reckonings and comprehend the changes, to follow form and shift with ease—this is called transformation, this is called illusion. The Creator’s craft is subtle, its work profound; truly, it is difficult to fathom or exhaust. But that which follows form is craft manifest, its work shallow; thus, it arises and vanishes in an instant. Only when you know that illusion and transformation are no different from life and death can you begin to study illusion. You and I are also illusion—what need is there to learn?’\"*\n\n*Laochengzi* returned home and, reflecting deeply on Master *Yinwen*’s words for three months, was thereafter able to command life and death at will, to reverse the order of the four seasons. In winter, he summoned thunder; in summer, he conjured ice. That which flew he made walk, and that which walked he made fly.",

      "translated_text": "All his life, he never revealed his arts, and so the world never transmitted them.\n\nThose who can be led may be guided to the wondrous Dao. Those who bow and enter the chamber—these are the ones who cannot be led. Take care never to instruct them. When you dismiss your attendants and speak with them alone, it is because the workings of yin and yang, the movements of the four seasons, the principles of the myriad things—all arise in an instant and vanish in a flash. Thus it is said: the qi of life, the forms of existence, are all illusion.\n\nThings take birth as their beginning and death as their end; they regard life as constant and death as change. Yet all are shrouded in the workings of the Creator and the shifts of yin and yang. Therefore it is said: that which the Creator begins and yin and yang transform is called life, is called death.\n\nHaving exhausted the reckonings of the Creator and yin and yang, and having mastered the changes of qi and form, one calls this *transformation*. Entrusting it to the reckonings of change, and further altering it according to its form, one calls this *illusion*.\n\nThe Creator is Heaven. Heaven is spirit, thus its craft is subtle and unfathomable, its work profound and inexhaustible—this is why it is difficult to plumb or complete. That which follows form is man. Man is clarity, thus his craft is manifest and swiftly accomplished, his work shallow and fleetingly undone—this is why it arises and vanishes in an instant.\n\nLife and death are indeed so, while illusion and transformation are but contrivances. From the perspective of the Dao, none are truly constant. If you know that illusion and transformation are no different from life and death, where is there anything that is not illusion?\n\nNow you and I are both illusion, yet we study illusion—this is like interpreting a dream within a dream. To speak of things that may exist or perish to one who abides freely in existence and nonexistence—we ourselves are surely real. Reversing the order of the four seasons is to command yin and yang without being commanded by them. Summoning thunder in winter and conjuring ice in summer is to govern the seasons without being governed by them. Making the flying walk and the walking fly is to drive the myriad things without being driven by them. Subtle in craft and profound in work, one thus wanders with the Creator.\n\nAll his life, he never revealed his arts, and the world never transmitted them, for they were difficult to plumb, to complete, to fathom, or to know. Thus, those who excel in studying illusion first establish constancy in nonbeing, and only then can they exhaust its depths.\n\nMaster Liezi said: \"One who is skilled in transformation keeps his Dao hidden in the ordinary, and his work appears no different from others'. The virtue of the Five Emperors and the achievements of the Three Kings were not necessarily all due to wisdom or courage; some were accomplished through transformation—who can fathom it?\n\nThe virtue of the Five Emperors and the achievements of the Three Kings—keeping the Dao hidden in the ordinary means concealing it within use. Their work appearing no different from others' means manifesting it among people. The Five Emperors are called *virtue*, the Three Kings *achievement*—these are merely the traces they trod. Their minds were never not one, yet some attribute their success to wisdom and courage, while others dare not be certain, and still others suspect it arose from transformation. Such is the unfathomable skill of those who excel in transformation. Could this be called flowing in unison with Heaven and Earth?\"\n\nThere are eight signs in waking and six phases in dreams. What are the eight signs? The first is *incident*, the second *action*, the third *gain*, the fourth *loss*, the fifth *sorrow*, the sixth *joy*, the seventh *life*, the eighth *death*. These eight signs are what form encounters.\n\nWhat are the six phases? The first is the *ordinary dream*, the second the *startling dream*, the third the *thought dream*, the fourth the *waking dream*, the fifth the *joyful dream*, the sixth the *fearful dream*. These six are what spirit intermingles with.\n\nThose who do not recognize the origin of sensory changes are perplexed by events when they arise, unaware of their cause. Those who recognize the origin of sensory changes understand the cause when events arise. Knowing the cause, there is nothing to fear.\n\nWaking engages with affairs, thus it is verified by the eight signs. Dreaming conceals principle, thus it is divined by the six phases.\n\nWhat one encounters is called *incident*; what one does is called *action*. *Gain* refers to what one acquires; *loss* to what one forfeits. Sorrow and joy burden the heart; life and death transform the self. These eight are what form discloses and can be verified—thus it is said: these eight signs are what form encounters.\n\nThe six—ordinary, startling, thought, waking, joyful, fearful—are what the soul intermingles with and can be divined—thus it is said: these six phases are what spirit intermingles with.\n\nIn dreams, the soul intermingles. In waking, form discloses. The alternation of day and night—those who do not recognize the origin of sensory changes are perplexed by events when they arise, for they do not know they are dreaming and take themselves to be awake. Those who recognize the origin of sensory changes understand the cause when events arise—this is what is meant by *great awakening* and knowing that this is the *great dream*.\n\nOne who comprehends the Dao of day and night knows that the myriad things are one, undivided—who is awake, who is dreaming? Where is there distress in transformation? The waxing and waning, the ebb and flow of the one body all correspond to Heaven and Earth and respond to the kinds of things.\n\nThus, when yin qi is strong, one dreams of wading through great waters in terror. When yang qi is strong, one dreams of traversing great fires and being scorched. When both yin and yang are strong, one dreams of life and death. When overly sated, one dreams of giving; when overly hungry, one dreams of taking.\n\nThose whose illness is floating and hollow dream of soaring; those whose illness is sunken and solid dream of drowning. Sleeping with a sash tied dreams of snakes; if a bird pecks at one’s hair, one dreams of flying. When yin is approaching, one dreams of fire; when illness is coming, one dreams of eating. Those who drink wine grieve; those who sing and dance weep.\n\nMaster Liezi said: \"Spirit encounters make dreams; form encounters make affairs. Thus, daytime thoughts become nighttime dreams—these are what spirit and form encounter. Therefore, when spirit is concentrated, thoughts and dreams dissolve of themselves.

      "translated_text": "The people there neither eat nor wear clothing but sleep often, waking once every fifty days. What they do in dreams they take as real, and what they see when awake they deem illusory.\n\nThe land equidistant from the Four Seas is called the Central Kingdom, spanning north and south of the river, east and west of Mount Tai, over ten thousand *li* in extent. Its yin and yang are precisely measured, thus one cold and one hot season; its divisions of dusk and dawn are clearly marked, thus one day and one night. The people there possess both wisdom and folly, and the myriad things flourish in abundance, their skills and arts manifold. There are rulers and subjects in mutual governance, rites and laws in mutual support. Their deeds and undertakings are beyond reckoning. They alternate between waking and sleeping, taking what they do when awake as real and what they see in dreams as illusory.\n\nAt the northeast corner lies a land called the Country of Flourishing Descent. Its earthly *qi* is perpetually warm, and though the lingering light of sun and moon shines upon it, its soil yields no fine crops. The people eat grass roots and tree fruits, knowing nothing of cooked food. Their nature is fierce and unyielding, the strong oppressing the weak, prizing victory and scorning righteousness. They run swiftly and seldom rest, ever awake and never sleeping.\n\nYang is movement and brightness; yin is stillness and obscurity. The southwest is inclined toward yin, so its people incline toward obscurity, still and given to much sleep. The northeast is inclined toward yang, so its people incline toward brightness, active and given to much waking. The Central Kingdom is where heaven and earth unite, where the four seasons converge, where wind and rain gather, where yin and yang harmonize. Why should it move in brightness or rest in obscurity? When movement and stillness do not miss their proper time, waking and dreaming dissolve into reality and illusion. Who but one who embodies the true and constant and excels in transformation could attain this?\n\nThe steward Yin of Zhou greatly expanded his estate. Those under his employ toiled from dawn till dusk without rest. An old laborer, his strength exhausted, was driven to even greater exertion. By day he groaned as he worked, and by night he sank into deep slumber. His spirit scattered and waned, and once he dreamed he was a lord. He dwelled above the people, presiding over the affairs of the state; he roamed and feasted in palaces, indulging every desire, his joy unmatched. When he awoke, he returned to servitude. Someone sought to console him for his toil, but the laborer said: \"A human life spans a hundred years, divided equally between day and night. By day I am a slave, and though it is bitter, it is bitter indeed; by night I am a lord, and my joy is unmatched. What cause have I for resentment?\"\n\nThe steward Yin was consumed by worldly affairs, his thoughts fixed on his family’s wealth. Both mind and body were wearied, and by night he too sank into deep slumber. Once he dreamed he was a servant, running errands and performing every task; he endured countless scoldings and beatings, and in his sleep he muttered and groaned until dawn. Distressed, Yin sought counsel from a friend. The friend said: \"Your position brings honor to your person, and your wealth exceeds that of others—you surpass most men by far. Yet by night you dream of being a servant, and thus the alternation of suffering and ease follows the common course. If you wish to combine both waking and dreaming, how could that be possible?\"\n\nUpon hearing his friend’s words, Yin eased the laborers’ tasks and reduced his own burdensome thoughts. His illness gradually abated.\n\nOne yin, one yang—when harmonious and balanced, this is the form bestowed by heaven. When form loses its balance, it becomes biased and gives rise to illness. Some suffer by day and find joy by night; others find ease by day and toil by night. This reversal is the inevitable principle of beginning and end. By easing the laborers’ tasks and reducing his own burdensome thoughts, each attained their proper balance, and thus his illness gradually abated.\n\nYet all things are of one kind—who is awake and who is dreaming? When dreaming, one does not know it is a dream; only upon waking does one realize it was a dream. The foolish believe themselves awake. There must be a great awakening before one knows this to be the great dream. Are lords and herdsmen truly so? How rigid!\n\nA man of Zheng was gathering firewood in the wild when he encountered a startled deer. He chased and struck it down, then killed it. Fearing others would see, he hastily hid it in a ditch, covering it with reeds, his joy overwhelming. Soon after, he forgot where he had hidden it and took the whole affair to be a dream. As he walked along, he recounted the tale. A passerby heard him, followed his words, and took the deer. Upon returning home, he told his wife: \"A woodcutter dreamed he had caught a deer but forgot where he hid it. Now I have found it—he was truly the dreamer.\" His wife said: \"Is it not you who dreamed of the woodcutter catching the deer? Could there really have been a woodcutter? Now that you truly have the deer, is your dream real?\" The man replied: \"I have the deer in hand—why trouble myself over whether he dreamed or I dreamed?\"\n\nThe woodcutter returned home, dissatisfied at losing the deer. That night, he truly dreamed of where he had hidden it and also dreamed of the one who had taken it. At dawn, he followed his dream and found the man. They took their dispute to court, and the magistrate said: \"At first you truly caught the deer but mistakenly called it a dream; now you truly dreamed of the deer but mistakenly call it real. He truly took your deer, and now you dispute it with him. Your wife also said that both dreamed of another’s deer, so no one truly has the deer. Now that this deer is in hand, let us divide it in two.\"\n\nHe reported this to the lord of Zheng, who exclaimed: \"Ah! Is the magistrate about to dream of dividing another’s deer?\" He consulted his minister, who said: \"Whether dreaming or not, I cannot discern. To distinguish waking from dreaming, only the Yellow Emperor or Confucius could do so. Now that they are gone, who can settle this? Let us simply follow the magistrate’s judgment.\"\n\nFrom the perspective of the Dao, who is awake and who is dreaming? Right and wrong are of one *qi*. Is there truly a distinction? With the descent into forms and names, truth and falsehood arise. Thus, truly catching a deer is mistaken for a dream, and truly dreaming of a deer is mistaken for reality. The paths of right and wrong are tangled and confused—how can one know their distinction? Even the Yellow Emperor and Confucius, who merged truth and illusion, could there truly be a \"this\" and \"that\"?",

      "translated_text": "The magistrate’s judgment sought to distinguish truth from illusion—yet could there truly be no \"this\" and \"that\"? Since even seeking verification from the Yellow Emperor or Confucius proved futile, one could only follow the magistrate’s words.\n\nIn the village of Yang in Song, a man named Hua Zi suffered from forgetfulness in middle age. What he took in the morning he forgot by evening; what he gave at dusk he forgot by dawn. On the road, he forgot to walk; at home, he forgot to sit. He could not recognize the past, nor recall the present. His entire household was distressed. They exhausted the records of diviners, but no hexagram revealed an answer; they consulted shamans and prayed, but no spell could restrain it; they sought physicians and attacked the illness with medicine, but it would not cease.\n\nA scholar from Lu offered his services, claiming he could cure Hua Zi. Hua Zi’s wife and children offered half their property in exchange for his method. The scholar said: \"This is not a matter for divination or prayer, nor can it be cured by acupuncture or herbs. Let me attempt to transform his heart and alter his thoughts—perhaps then he may recover.\" Thereupon, he exposed Hua Zi to the elements until he sought clothing; starved him until he craved food; confined him in darkness until he longed for light. The scholar joyfully told Hua Zi’s son: \"The illness can be cured. However, my method is secret and not to be passed down. Remove all attendants and leave me alone with him for seven days.\" They complied, unaware of what he did. Yet after years of affliction, the illness vanished in a single morning.\n\nWhen Hua Zi awoke, he flew into a rage, cast out his wife, punished his children, and brandished a spear to chase away the scholar. The people of Song seized him and demanded an explanation. Hua Zi said: \"Before, I was forgetful—adrift, unaware of the very existence of heaven and earth. Now, suddenly recalling the past, the myriad threads of existence and loss, joy and sorrow, love and hate from decades past surge forth. I fear that the future’s entanglements of existence and loss, joy and sorrow, love and hate will disturb my heart like this. Can I ever regain even a moment’s forgetfulness?\"\n\nZi Gong heard of this and found it strange. He reported it to Confucius, who said: \"This is beyond your understanding.\" Turning to Yan Hui, he instructed him to remember it. To know forgetfulness is to harmonize the heart’s judgments. To cast off the limbs and depart from form, to renounce cleverness and abandon knowledge—when the celestial mechanism lies dormant, one merges silently with the Dao, dimly present yet as if absent from the world. How could one perceive it? The common people are bright and clear; I alone am as if benighted. To scorn worldly success and feel shame at engaging with the roots of affairs, yet to comprehend the divine—this is why the sage remains free from illness. The world, not understanding, calls it an affliction, thus labeling Hua Zi’s forgetfulness as a disease. Yet by transforming his heart and altering his thoughts, making the tangled threads of existence and loss, joy and sorrow, love and hate arise to burden his form, the scholar’s so-called cure only disturbed his heart. Such a method opens the mind yet harms life—this is why Confucius did not explain it to Zi Gong. But he instructed Yan Hui to record it, for he was capable of *zuowang* (sitting in forgetfulness).\n\nIn Qin, the Feng family had a son who was clever in youth but developed a bewildering illness in adulthood. He heard singing and mistook it for weeping; saw white and took it for black; smelled fragrance and thought it rotten; tasted sweetness and found it bitter; deemed wrong as right. Whatever his mind turned to—heaven and earth, the four directions, water and fire, cold and heat—all were inverted. The Yang family told his father: \"The gentlemen of Lu possess many arts—perhaps they can cure him? Why not seek their help?\"\n\nHis father traveled to Lu but passed through Chen, where he encountered Lao Dan. He described his son’s condition. Lao Dan said: \"How do you know your son is deluded? Today, all under heaven are confused by right and wrong, blinded by profit and harm. Those with the same affliction are many, yet none awaken. Moreover, one person’s delusion cannot overturn a household; one household’s delusion cannot overturn a village; one village’s delusion cannot overturn a state; one state’s delusion cannot overturn the world. If all under heaven were deluded, who could overturn it? If all people’s hearts were like your son’s, you would be the deluded one. Joy and sorrow, sound and color, scent and taste, right and wrong—who can correct them? Furthermore, my own trivial knowledge may itself be delusion—how much more so the gentlemen of Lu, mere couriers of delusion? How could they resolve another’s confusion? Take your provisions and return home swiftly.\"\n\nThe manifestation of right and wrong is the diminishment of the Dao. That has its right and wrong, this has its right and wrong—thus, singing and weeping, black and white, fragrance and rot, sweet and bitter, even within the four seas, each person affirms what they affirm and denies what they deny. Whom could one appoint to set it right? The people’s delusion has endured for ages. Those who whisper of knowing call others deluded—how could I discern the distinction? This is why Laozi asked his father: \"How do you know your son is deluded?\" And also said: \"Joy and sorrow, sound and color, scent and taste, right and wrong—who can correct them?\"\n\nThe loss of the Dark Pearl was retrieved by *Xiangwang*—how could the illness of bewilderment be understood by the world? A man of Yan was born in Yan and raised in Chu. In old age, he returned to his homeland but passed through Jin. His traveling companions deceived him, pointing to a city and saying: \"This is the city of Yan.\" His expression changed sorrowfully. They pointed to a shrine and said...",

      "translated_text": "The shrine of your native village.\" At this, he sighed deeply. They pointed to a house and said: \"This is your ancestors’ dwelling.\" He wept silently. They pointed to a mound and said: \"This is your ancestors’ grave.\" The man could not restrain his sobs. His companions burst into laughter, saying: \"We were only jesting with you—this is but the land of Jin.\" The man was overcome with shame. When he finally reached Yan and truly beheld the city and shrines of his homeland, truly saw his ancestors’ dwelling and grave, his sorrow was but faint. For when emotion reaches its peak, joy and sorrow pass, and all that once moved him now stirs no delight or grief.\n\n*The Explication of the Perfect Virtue of the Primal and Void*, Scroll Four ends.\n*The Explication of the Perfect Virtue of the Primal and Void*, Scroll Five\nBy Emperor Huizong of Song\n\nConfucius said: \"When acted upon, it is full; when left alone, it is empty. By observing subtleties in tandem, being and non-being are not opposed. Nothing is not forgotten, yet nothing is not present. Serene and boundless, this is called accord with principle.\"\n\nConfucius was at leisure in his chamber when Zigong entered to attend him, his countenance troubled. The sage concealed himself in mystery, thus his heart knew no joy or sorrow, no fortune or misfortune. Yet he shared the people’s afflictions, and so felt concern. Zigong dared not ask and went out to tell Yan Hui. Yan Hui took up his zither and sang. Confucius heard it and summoned Yan Hui in, asking: \"Why do you alone rejoice?\" Yan Hui replied: \"Why does the Master alone grieve?\" Confucius said: \"First speak your mind.\" Yan Hui said: \"I once heard the Master say: 'Rejoice in Heaven and know fate, thus one has no sorrow.' This is why I rejoice. Rejoicing in Heaven means blaming no one; knowing fate means not prizing force. Following nature without burdening the heart—what sorrow can there be?\" Confucius, his expression grave, asked: \"Did I truly say such a thing? You have misunderstood. Those were my words of old. Let my words of today be taken as correct. Where does the Dao not go and yet not abide? Where does speech abide and yet not suffice? Adapting to the moment is called rightness; embodying the constancy of the Dao is called correctness. Thus, my words of old may be deemed right, but from today’s vantage, they cannot be called correct. Yet if the words of old are right and today’s words are correct, what is spoken remains unsettled. Knowing that time has no fixed standard for the present, how can those bound by doctrine grasp this? You merely know that rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate bring no sorrow, but you do not know the great sorrow of rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate. True joy is no joy, yet nothing is not joy; true knowledge is no knowledge, yet nothing is not known. Cultivate it in the self, and there is no sorrow; cultivate it in the world, and there is great sorrow. Now I tell you the truth: Cultivating the self, accepting poverty and success, knowing that going and coming are not of the self, and stilling disorder in the heart and thoughts—this is what you call rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate without sorrow. The ancients who understood the Dao knew that action and stillness were not within human power but lay with Heaven, that rise and fall were not brought about by force but by fate. They neither gloried in success nor shamed poverty, but followed the time as it came. Following and departing in accord with the time, dwelling in peace and compliance, joy and sorrow could not enter—what sorrow could there be? Yet this pertains only to cultivating the self. Formerly, I cultivated the *Book of Songs* and the *Book of Documents*, rectified rites and music, intending to govern the world and leave a legacy for future generations—not merely to cultivate myself or govern the state of Lu. Yet the rulers and ministers of Lu daily lost their proper order, benevolence and righteousness further declined, and human nature and feeling grew ever more shallow. If the Dao does not prevail in one state or one generation, what will become of the world and future ages? I first realized that the *Book of Songs*, the *Book of Documents*, rites, and music could not save the world from disorder, yet I did not know the means to reform them—this is the sorrow of one who rejoices in Heaven and knows fate. The *Book of Songs* and the *Book of Documents* record the words of governance; rites and music are the instruments of governance. Confucius embodied the truth of the Dao to cultivate himself, transcending form, color, fame, and reputation, yet he pitied the world’s ills. Thus, he spoke of benevolence and righteousness, clarified rites and music, and employed every means to console the hearts of the world. Yet people of the age extinguished their essence and drowned their minds, unable to return to their nature and feelings and restore their original state. Thus, benevolence and righteousness further declined, and human nature and feeling grew ever more shallow. The Dao did not prevail in his own time—how could he not be concerned for the world and future generations? Nevertheless, I have grasped it now. The joy and knowledge of one who rejoices and knows are not what the ancients meant by joy and knowledge. Without joy, without knowledge—this is true joy, true knowledge. Thus, there is nothing not joyful, nothing not known, nothing not sorrowful, nothing not done. What need is there to discard the *Book of Songs*, the *Book of Documents*, rites, and music? Why reform them?\" Yan Hui bowed to the north and said: \"I, too, have grasped it.\" He went out and told Zigong. Zigong was bewildered, lost in thought, and returned home to ponder for seven days without sleep or food, until his bones stood out. Yan Hui went again to explain, and only then did Zigong return to Confucius’ gate, strumming the zither and chanting the books, which he did unceasingly for the rest of his life. If the Dao and virtue are not abandoned, what need is there for benevolence and righteousness? If nature and feeling are not lost, what use are rites and music?",

      "translated_text": "One who delights in Heaven delights in something—this is not what the ancients called delight. One who knows fate knows something—this is not what the ancients called knowledge. One who delights in Heaven must ultimately arrive at having nothing to delight in—this is called true delight. One who knows fate must ultimately arrive at knowing nothing—this is called true knowledge. If this is so, then there is nothing not delightful, nothing not known, nothing not sorrowful, nothing not done, and one becomes a person in harmony with transformation. If, in going forth, one cannot transform others, then governing through the *Book of Songs*, the *Book of Documents*, rites, and music may suffice. Retreating from benevolence and righteousness, honoring rites and music, may also suffice.\n\nThus, in the beginning, the *Book of Songs*, the *Book of Documents*, rites, and music could not save the world from disorder. Yet once one has attained the Way, one says: \"What need is there to discard the *Book of Songs*, the *Book of Documents*, rites, and music? Why reform them?\" Before, Zigong dared not ask, but upon hearing this, he was bewildered and lost in thought, finding nothing to grasp—he could only chant the books without ceasing. Was this not what is called \"grasping the words but not their meaning\"?\n\nA minister of Chen, on a diplomatic mission to Lu, privately visited the house of Shusun. Shusun said: \"Our state has a sage.\" The minister asked: \"Is it not Kong Qiu?\" Shusun replied: \"It is.\" \"How do you know he is a sage?\" Shusun said: \"I once heard Yan Hui say: 'Kong Qiu can set aside the mind and employ the body.'\" The minister of Chen said: \"Our state also has a sage—do you not know?\" \"Who is this sage?\" \"Among the disciples of Lao Dan, there is one named Kang Cangzi who has mastered the Way of the guest. He can see with his ears and hear with his eyes.\"\n\nConfucius responds to things by forgetting the mind, so those who see his sagacity believe he can set aside the mind and employ the body. Kang Cangzi adapts to the self and directs the body, so those who see his sagacity believe he can see with his ears and hear with his eyes. Setting aside the mind and employing the body is like a well-sweep moving up and down—what pulls the person also pulls others. Seeing with the ears and hearing with the eyes is akin to Liezi’s mind congealing and form dissolving, bones and flesh completely merging. Yet what is set aside, and what is employed? The Way of the sage is without seeing and without hearing—how can birds be questioned about it? This is merely what people perceive.\n\nThe Duke of Lu, hearing this, was greatly astonished and sent his highest minister with rich gifts to invite Kang Cangzi. Kang Cangzi accepted the invitation and arrived. The Duke of Lu, speaking humbly, sought his instruction. Kang Cangzi said: \"Those who transmitted this spoke falsely. I can see and hear without using ears and eyes, but I cannot alter the function of ears and eyes.\" The Duke of Lu said: \"This is even more extraordinary—what is your Way?\" \"I wish to hear it to the end.\" Kang Cangzi said: \"My body harmonizes with the mind, the mind harmonizes with qi, qi harmonizes with spirit, and spirit harmonizes with the primordial. When there is the presence of the subtle, the resonance of the unique tone—whether far away at the eight wilds’ edge or near at the space between the brows—whatever comes to disturb me, I must know it. Yet I do not know whether this is perceived by my seven orifices and four limbs or known by my heart, belly, and six viscera—it is simply self-knowing.\"\n\nThe Duke of Lu was overjoyed. Another day, he told Confucius, who smiled but did not answer. Seeing with the ears and hearing with the eyes still cannot transcend form. To see and hear without using ears and eyes is to detach them from form. For ears and eyes to see and hear is not yet to leave form—there is still something they cannot reach. But when ears and eyes are not used, form fills emptiness. One sees in darkness, hears in silence, and unites with spirit—how could the world recognize this?\n\nWhen the body harmonizes with the mind, one advances inward from without. When the mind harmonizes with qi, one attains emptiness from fullness. When qi harmonizes with spirit, one stands in the unfathomable. When spirit harmonizes with the primordial, one moves without direction. Not listening with the ears but listening with qi, I encounter with spirit rather than seeing with the eyes—this is what is called \"entering the seamless with nothingness.\"\n\nThe presence of the subtle is the smallness of form; the resonance of the unique tone is the faintness of sound. Whether far away at the eight wilds’ edge or near at the space between the brows, it is not nothingness—yet confined by form, moved by sound, though I reject cleverness and understanding to merge with the great penetration, whatever comes to disturb me, I must know it. How could I know why it is so? Thus, it is simply self-knowing.\n\nConfucius smiled but did not answer—his smile dissolved the question, and he had no answer. The Grand Steward of Shang visited Confucius and said: \"Is Qiu a sage?\" Confucius replied: \"How would Qiu dare claim sagacity? Yet Qiu is broadly learned and deeply knowledgeable.\" The Grand Steward said: \"Since you are a sage, why say you dare not claim sagacity?\" Confucius did not presume to occupy the position of a sage. Though broadly learned, he had no single accomplishment to his name; though widely knowledgeable, he unified all with one thread—this is why Confucius is called the culmination of greatness.\n\nThe Grand Steward of Shang asked: \"Were the Three Kings sages?\" Confucius said: \"The Three Kings were good at employing wisdom and courage—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.\" \"Were the Five Emperors sages?\" Confucius said: \"The Five Emperors were good at employing benevolence and righteousness—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.\" \"Were the Three Sovereigns sages?\" Confucius said: \"The Three Sovereigns were good at employing what suited the times—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.\"\n\nThe Sovereigns spoke of the Dao, the Emperors of virtue, and the Kings of achievement. Being good at employing what suited the times is how they practiced the Dao; being good at employing benevolence and righteousness is how they perfected virtue; being good at employing wisdom and courage is how they cultivated achievement. Yet these are the burdens of action, not the affairs of non-action—thus, Qiu says he does not know whether they were sages.\n\nNevertheless, the Sovereigns, Emperors, and Kings responded to their times and created what they employed—these are their traces. What underlies their traces is what makes them sages. The Grand Steward of Shang was greatly startled and said: \"Then who is a sage?\" Confucius, his expression changing, paused, and said: \"Among the people of the West, there is a sage who governs without disorder, speaks without needing trust, transforms without teaching, and is so vast that the people cannot name him.\"",

Confucius, who deemed the rule of the Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, and Three Kings as not truly sagely, now speaks of a sage in the West—this must be the Dao’s unfolding through time. The sage is of the moment: the governance of the Five Emperors and Three Kings, gathering the multitudes at the flourishing assembly, was like spring and summer in the seasons—revealing only their outward kingly achievements, hence he said, \"I do not know whether they were sages.\" The people of the West, having shed refinement to return to simplicity, are like autumn and winter in the seasons—tranquil and sagely in stillness, hence he said, \"There is a sage there.\"\n\nOnly when there is disorder does one govern; without the need to govern, what disorder could there be? Thus, he governs without governing and there is no disorder. One who requires words to be trusted lacks sufficient trust; when understanding comes in silence, there is no need for speech to be believed. The workings of the Dao’s transformation leave traces of their enactment; when transformation leaves no trace, who could impose their will upon it? Thus, it transforms without transforming—this is the meaning. Nothing is done, yet it is always naturally so.\n\nThe Dao cannot be named, for it has no boundaries; thus, he said, \"So vast that the people cannot name him.\" Yet the sage remains unknowable—calling him a sage, how can one be certain it is true? One can only suspect he may be a sage.\n\nThe Grand Steward of Shang, finding Confucius’ words contrary to human nature, was at first startled and alarmed, seeking to measure them by conventional standards but finding no answer. Thus, in the end, he fell silent, pondering in his heart, and concluded that Confucius had deceived him.\n\nZixia asked Confucius, \"What sort of man is Yan Hui?\"\nThe Master said, \"Hui’s benevolence surpasses my own.\"\nZixia asked, \"What sort of man is Zigong?\"\nThe Master said, \"Ci’s eloquence surpasses my own.\"\nZixia asked, \"What sort of man is Zilu?\"\nThe Master said, \"You’s courage surpasses my own.\"\nZixia asked, \"What sort of man is Zizhang?\"\nThe Master said, \"Shi’s dignity surpasses my own.\"\n\nZixia rose from his mat and asked, \"Then why do these four serve you?\"\nThe Master said, \"Sit.

This is why they serve me without divided loyalty.\n\nThe Way of the sage is supremely lofty and luminous, yet it abides in the mean. Whether one exceeds it or falls short, neither is the Way. The worthy may surpass it, but the sage takes nothing from them. Hui excels in benevolence but cannot return to simplicity—this is not perfect benevolence. Ci excels in eloquence but cannot be reticent—this is not true eloquence. You excels in courage but cannot be timid—this is not perfect courage. Shi excels in dignity but cannot blend in—this is not harmonious illumination. Though they do not encompass all things or reach everywhere, each has a single aspect of the Way. Yet each has its strengths and its uses in due time. As for the Master’s great completeness, he embodies the Way in its entirety and possesses all its virtues.\n\nThose several disciples, gazing up at the sage, recognize their own limitations. Thus, though Confucius deems each of them superior to himself in their particular strengths, how could they ever waver in their service to him?\n\nLiezi first studied under Master Hushu Zi Lin and befriended Bohun Maoren, then took up residence in Nanguo. Those who followed him gathered daily in great numbers. Yet Liezi himself remained unassuming, engaging in debate with them morning after morning, leaving nothing unheard. Though he and Master Nanguo shared a wall for twenty years, they never paid formal visits to one another. When they met on the road, their eyes seemed not to see each other, and the servants at Liezi’s gate took it for granted that the two masters were rivals.\n\nA man from Chu came and asked Liezi, “Why do you and Master Nanguo oppose each other?”\nLiezi replied, “Master Nanguo’s appearance is full, yet his mind is empty; his ears hear nothing, his eyes see nothing, his mouth speaks nothing, his mind knows nothing, and his form shows no agitation. What could I possibly do with him? Nevertheless, I will go with you to see him.”\n\nLiezi set out with forty disciples. When they saw Master Nanguo, he indeed appeared like a disembodied spirit, impossible to engage. Looking back at Liezi, his form and spirit were mismatched, impossible to join. Then Master Nanguo suddenly pointed to one of Liezi’s disciples in the rear rank and spoke to him, cheerful and forthright, as if he were the only one present.\n\nLiezi’s followers were astonished. On returning home, all wore expressions of doubt.\nLiezi said: “Those who have attained their aim speak not; those who advance in knowledge also speak not. To use non-speech as speech is still speech; to use non-knowing as knowing is still knowing. Non-speech and not-speaking, non-knowing and not-knowing—these are also speech and knowing. They encompass all speech and all knowing, yet also no speech and no knowing. It is only thus. Why should you be so needlessly astonished?”",

      "translated_text": "The days passed in great number, yet none could reach him—this speaks to how many came together, yet the Master remained beyond reach. Even Liezi was but faint in this regard, for Liezi’s Dao could not be seen. Day after day, they debated without cease, yet nothing went unheard. But the Dao cannot be heard; to hear it is to miss it. When debate arises from necessity, what is heard is but shallow. For twenty years, though their walls adjoined, they paid no visits—this aligns with what Laozi called \"no mutual coming and going.\" When they met upon the Way, their eyes seemed not to see each other, yet the Dao was ever-present without need of gaze. The hundred bones and nine orifices were all intact—this is what is meant by \"form fully filled.\" Hollow and empty, unseen when looked upon—this is what is meant by \"heart void.\" Possessing human form, ears, eyes, mouth, and features were all complete. Lacking human sentiment, there was no hearing, no seeing, no speech, no knowing, no fear—its chamber was empty. Though the spirit seemed present, the form was not true—it was but an image of a person. \"Form and spirit mismatched\" means the spirit does not abide in the form. \"Cheerful and forthright, as if alone and self-assured\" means failing to know the masculine yet clinging to the feminine. Given Liezi’s Dao, even Nanguo saw him thus—no wonder his disciples were astonished and all bore expressions of doubt.\n\nSpeech is the means by which the Dao is transmitted. Speech exists for the sake of meaning; grasp the meaning and forget the words—thus it is said, \"Those who have attained their aim speak not.\" What can be discussed in words is but the coarse aspect of things, ignorant of what lies within. Thus it is said, \"Those who advance in knowledge also speak not.\" To use non-speech as speech is still speech—this is the ultimate speech. To use non-knowing as knowing is still knowing—this is the ultimate knowing. When my non-speech aligns with the Dao’s non-speech, when my non-knowing aligns with the Dao’s non-knowing, from the perspective of those who have attained their aim and those who advance in knowledge, this is also speech, this is also knowing. The Dao does not extend beyond this—why needless astonishment?\n\nLiezi was a student. After three years, his heart dared not ponder right and wrong, his mouth dared not speak of profit and harm—only then did Old Shang grant him a single glance. After five years, his heart again pondered right and wrong, his mouth again spoke of profit and harm—only then did Old Shang begin to relax his countenance and smile. After seven years, his heart followed its thoughts without right or wrong; his mouth spoke without profit or harm. Only then did the Master draw him near to share his mat. After nine years, his heart roamed freely in thought, his mouth spoke freely in words, yet he knew not whether his own right and wrong, profit and harm existed, nor whether others’ right and wrong, profit and harm existed—inner and outer had advanced. Thereafter, his eyes were as ears, his ears as nose, his nose as mouth—all were the same. His heart congealed, his form dissolved, bones and flesh wholly merged. He no longer sensed where his body leaned, where his feet trod, what his heart pondered, or what his words concealed. Thus it was. Then no principle remained hidden.\n\nThe first glance signified the Dao’s presence in the meeting of eyes; the smile signified the heart’s attainment beyond form’s release; drawing him near to share the mat signified advancement to union with him. When inner and outer had advanced, it was wondrous and unfathomable. Form filled yet empty, heart congealed and form released, bones and flesh wholly merged—having reached the utmost of form, no principle remained hidden.\n\nInitially, Liezi delighted in wandering. Master Huqiu asked: \"Youkuo delights in wandering—what does he delight in through wandering?\" Liezi replied: \"The joy of wandering lies in the play of things without fixed nature.\" Others wander to observe what they see; I wander to observe what transforms. Wandering thus—who could discern its nature? Master Huqiu said: \"Is Youkuo’s wandering truly the same as others’, or is it truly different? All that is seen is but the constant sight of change. To play with the unfixed nature of things is to not know that I, too, am without fixed nature. To focus on external wandering is to not know the focus of inner observation. Those who wander externally seek completion in things; those who observe inwardly find sufficiency in themselves. Finding sufficiency in oneself—this is the utmost of wandering; seeking completion in things—this is the failure of wandering.\"\n\nThereafter, Liezi never left his home, believing himself ignorant of wandering. What he played with was without fixed nature—thus it was ever new. Others wander to observe only appearances, sounds, and forms. I wander to observe the transformations of growth and decline, fullness and emptiness. None could discern the nature of his wandering—this speaks to how the difference between the two remained unknown. Yet those who see through nature, in what they see, also constantly see change. Thus it is said: \"All that is seen is but the constant sight of change.\" To follow others is to see only their unfixed nature. To turn outward inward is to find within what is ever new. Thus it is said: \"To play with the unfixed nature of things is to not know that I, too, am without fixed nature.\" Those who focus on external wandering age with things, seeing things but not nature; those who observe inwardly turn to themselves in sincerity, seeing nature but not things. Chasing echoes for sound—this is akin to seeking completion in things. Dwelling in shade to rest the shadow—this is akin to finding sufficiency in oneself. Thus, the utmost of wandering and its failure are distinguished only by inner and outer. Liezi never left his home—this is what is meant by \"turning to seek within oneself.\"\n\nMaster Huqiu said: \"Is this the utmost of wandering? The utmost of wandering knows not where it goes; the utmost of observation knows not where it rests. All things wander, all things observe—this is what I call wandering, this is what I call observation. Thus it is said: *Is this the utmost of wandering? Is this the utmost of wandering?* The utmost of wandering moves by nature; the utmost of observation sees by nature.\"",

      "translated_text": "Wenzhi then commanded Longshu to stand with his back to the light. Wenzhi himself faced the light and observed him from behind. After a moment, he said: \"Ah! Now I see your heart. The space of a square inch is empty—you are nearly a sage. Your heart has six apertures flowing freely, yet one remains obstructed. Is it not those who take sagely wisdom as their affliction who suffer from this? This is beyond the reach of my shallow art. Your method is subtle—by this, I mean its profound subtlety.\n\nWhat Longshu described as his affliction, Wenzhi called his ailment, for he sought only to understand the origin of his condition. Praise and slander cannot bring him honor or shame; gain and loss cannot move him to joy or sorrow; life and death cannot alter his heart; wealth and poverty cannot burden his form. Seeing others as swine, he forgets humanity’s superiority over things; seeing himself as one among them, he forgets his own distinction from others. Dwelling in his home as if it were a traveler’s inn, he does not linger; gazing at his village as if it were a land of barbarians, he does not choose his place. All these afflictions—titles and rewards cannot sway him, punishments and penalties cannot intimidate him—thus he does not submit to others. Prosperity and decline, advantage and harm cannot alter him; sorrow and joy cannot move him—thus he is not enslaved by things. Looking up, he cannot serve a lord or befriend kin; looking down, he cannot govern a wife and children or command servants.\n\nThose of old who declined the world all spoke of a hidden sorrow as their ailment. Thus Wenzhi commanded Longshu to stand with his back to the light and observed him facing the light, suspecting he suffered from this hidden sorrow. The Way of the sage values nothing so highly as emptiness. Today I see your heart—the space of a square inch is empty—you are nearly a sage. The ears, eyes, nose, and mouth all connect to the heart; when the six apertures flow freely, the eye is as the ear, the ear as the nose, the nose as the mouth. But if one aperture remains obstructed, the heart congeals. How could external things burden it? Yet if this is called an affliction, is it not akin to the malady of forgetfulness?\n\nThat which arises without cause and yet is ever-present is the Dao; that which arises from life and thus persists even in death is constancy. That which arises from life and yet perishes is misfortune. That which arises with cause and yet is ever-dying is also the Dao; that which arises from death and thus perishes before its end is also constancy. That which arises from death and yet lives is fortune. Thus, to live without attachment is to enact the Dao; to complete life by the Dao is constancy. To die with attachment is also to enact the Dao; to meet death by the Dao is also constancy. What is prized in the Dao is its power over life and death.\n\nThe Dao alone endures and is ever-present, existing without exception. Because it alone endures and is ever-present, it is said: \"That which arises without cause and yet is ever-living.\" Because it exists without exception, it is said: \"That which arises with cause and yet is ever-dying.\" If one lives by the Dao, though one dies, one does not perish—this is the constancy of principle. Thus it is said: \"That which arises from life and thus persists even in death is constancy.\" But if one arises from life and yet perishes, this is not the true course—hence it is called misfortune. If one dies by the Dao, though one perishes before one’s time, it is not seen as change—thus it is said: \"Though one perishes before one’s end, it is also constancy.\" But if one arises from death and yet lives, this is a deluded life, a mere escape by luck—hence it is called fortune.\n\nWhat begins in creation, what transforms through yin and yang, is born and then dies, all by the Dao, all by fate. To live in one moment and die in the next—this is the natural course. When Jiliang died, Yang Zhu sang before his gate; when Suiwu died, Yang Zhu wept over his corpse. The birth and death of a servant—some sing, some weep. If death does not mean perishing, then death may be joyful, which is why he sang before the gate. If death comes as misfortune, then death is lamentable, which is why he wept over the corpse. As for the servant’s life and death—some join in song, some gather in mourning—how could they know where life and death truly lie?\n\nOne whose eyes are about to dim first sees the autumn down; one whose ears are about to deafen first hears the gnats in flight...\"",

      "translated_text": "One whose mouth is about to lose its taste first distinguishes the waters of Zhi and Sheng; one whose nose is about to be blocked first detects the scent of burning and decay; one whose body is about to stiffen first hastens in restless motion; one whose mind is about to be deluded first discerns right and wrong. Thus, when things do not reach their limit, they do not return. When things reach their extreme, they must reverse—such is the transformation of affairs. Once a form receives its completion, it does not perish until it is utterly spent, and thus it cannot escape entanglement.\n\nThe sage does not fix his position in form; in the depths of obscurity, he alone perceives the dawn; in the midst of silence, he alone hears harmony. How could he allow form to burden spirit?\n\nIn Zheng’s gardens and marshes, many are worthy; in Dongli, many are talented. During the labor at the gardens and marshes, there was a man named Bo Fengzi. Passing through Dongli, he encountered Deng Xi. Deng Xi turned to his disciples and laughed, saying: \"Shall we perform a dance for him? What do you make of this one approaching?\" His disciples replied: \"We would wish to know.\" Deng Xi said to Bo Fengzi: \"Do you understand the meaning of *yang yang* (nurturing nurturance)? To receive nurturance from others yet be unable to nurture oneself—this is the way of dogs and swine. To nurture things so that they serve one’s use—this is the power of man. If your disciples eat their fill and rest in their clothes, it is the achievement of governance. Yet in gathering the young and old to amass provisions for the kitchen, how are you different from dogs and swine?\"\n\nBo Fengzi did not respond. One of his disciples stepped forward out of turn and said: \"Has the master not heard of the many skills in Qi and Lu? There are those skilled in working earth and wood, those skilled in working metal and leather, those skilled in music and sound, those skilled in writing and calculation, those skilled in military affairs, and those skilled in ancestral rites—all talents are present. Yet none can take each other’s place, none can command each other. And those who assign positions lack knowledge, those who command lack ability, while knowledge and ability are both made to serve. The one who governs is but one whom we make use of—why should you take pride in this, Deng Xi?\"\n\nDeng Xi had no reply; he glanced at his disciples and withdrew.\n\nThe hundred schools and myriad skills cannot communicate with one another—like the ear, eye, nose, and mouth, each has its strength and its time of use. Yet there is a true lord residing within. He who employs form uses those who work earth, wood, metal, and leather to make tools; those who work music, writing, and calculation to make use; those who work military affairs to defend the outer; those who work ancestral rites to order the inner—all talents may be said to be present. Yet if one possesses all these for profit, one must also be without them for use, only then can one unify and govern them. For to act is to have what one cannot do; to be without action is to have nothing one cannot do. Thus it is said: \"Those who assign positions lack knowledge; those who command lack ability, yet knowledge and ability are made to serve them.\"\n\nDeng Xi did not comprehend this, taking pride in governance—no wonder he was ridiculed by those of great understanding. Bo Fengzi’s silence was the eloquence of not speaking.\n\nGong Yibo was renowned among the feudal lords for his strength. Tangxigong spoke of him to King Xuan of Zhou, who prepared gifts and invited him. When Gong Yibo arrived and the king observed his appearance, he seemed a feeble man. The king, perplexed, asked: \"What is the measure of your strength?\" Gong Yibo replied: \"Your servant’s strength can break the leg of a spring katydid and crush the wing of an autumn cicada.\" The king’s expression changed: \"My strength can rend the hide of a rhinoceros or drag the tail of nine oxen, yet I still regret its weakness. You break the leg of a spring katydid and crush the wing of an autumn cicada, yet your strength is renowned throughout the world—why?\"\n\nGong Yibo sighed deeply, withdrew from his mat, and said: \"Excellent is the king’s question! Your servant dares to speak truly. I had a teacher, Shang Qiuzi, whose strength was unmatched in the world, yet even his kin did not know it, for he never employed his strength. I served him unto death. He instructed me: 'One who wishes to see what he does not see must observe what others do not; one who wishes to obtain what he does not have must practice what others do not. Thus, one who learns to see first perceives a cartload of firewood; one who learns to hear first hears the striking of a bell. For what is easy within presents no difficulty without. With no difficulty without, one’s name does not leave his household.'\n\nNow my name is known among the feudal lords—this is my violation of my teacher’s teaching, my display of my own ability. Yet my name is not borne of failing to employ my strength, but of knowing how to employ it. Is this not better than failing to employ it? To accumulate many small victories into one great victory—only the sage can do this. How could this be a matter of prizing strength? This is why not using strength is the true possession of strength. The learner studies what he cannot study. Thus it is said: 'One who wishes to see what he does not see must observe what others do not; one who wishes to obtain what he does not have must practice what others do not.'\n\nFrom having what one sees, one discards and forgets it, reaching the point of having no sight—then one sees into obscurity, no different from perceiving a cartload of firewood. From having what one hears, one discards and forgets it, reaching the point of having no hearing—then one listens into silence, no different from hearing the striking of a bell. If virtue does not take form, whence can a name arise? Thus, to display one’s name is to violate one’s teaching. Yet it is still better than prizing strength to seek fame—this is why one is esteemed in the world.\"\n\nPrince Mou of Zhongshan, a worthy prince of Wei, delighted in associating with worthy men and cared not for state affairs, taking pleasure in the company of Gongsun Long of Zhao. The disciples of Le Zhengzi Yu laughed at him. Prince Mou said: \"Why do you laugh at my delight in Gongsun Long?\" Ziyu replied: \"Gongsun Long’s character: he follows no teacher, learns from no friend, is glib but misses the mark, rambles without substance, delights in the strange and speaks recklessly. He seeks to confuse men’s minds and silence their mouths, no better than a turner of the potter’s wheel or a servant.\"\n\nPrince Mou’s expression changed: \"Why do you describe Gongsun Long’s faults so? Pray, tell me the truth.\"",

If death comes as misfortune, then death is lamentable, which is why he wept over the corpse.

      "translated_text": "Ziyu said: \"I laugh at Long’s deception of Kong Chuan, where he claimed that a master archer could make the rear arrow’s head strike the notch of the one before, each shot following the last, every arrow linked in succession, the foremost arrow reaching the target without break or fall, the notch of the one behind still clinging to the bowstring—so that they seemed as one.\" Kong Chuan was astonished. Long said: \"This is not yet the marvel.\" Among Feng Meng’s disciples was one named Hong Chao, who, enraged at his wife, sought to frighten her. He drew the Wuhao bow and nocked a Qiwei arrow, shooting at her eye. The arrow flew straight toward her pupil, yet her eyelid did not so much as flutter; the arrow fell to the ground, and no dust rose. Could this be the words of a wise man?\"\n\nPrince Mou said: \"The words of the wise are not what the foolish can comprehend. The rear arrow’s head strikes the notch of the one before, the later following the earlier. The arrow flies toward the pupil, yet the eyelid does not flutter—this is the full force of the arrow. Why do you doubt it?\"\n\nLe Zhengzi Yu said: \"You are Long’s follower—how could you not gloss over his flaws? Let me speak of his greater absurdities. Long deceived the King of Wei, saying: 'There is intention without mind. There is pointing without reaching. There is thing without exhausting. There is shadow without movement. A single hair can draw a thousand jun. A white horse is not a horse. An orphaned calf has never had a mother.' His violations of kind and reversal of principle are too many to recount.\"\n\nPrince Mou said: \"You take what you do not understand as the height of absurdity—yet the absurdity lies with you. Without intention, minds are the same; without pointing, all things are reached. One who exhausts things is ever present. That a shadow does not move is explained by change. A single hair drawing a thousand jun is due to equal force. That a white horse is not a horse is the separation of form and name. That an orphaned calf has never had a mother is because it is not an orphaned calf.\"\n\nLe Zhengzi Yu said: \"You take all of Gongsun Long’s prattling as reasoned argument. If such words issued from another’s mouth, you would still accept them.\" Prince Mou fell silent for a long while, then took his leave, saying: \"Let me return another day to seek your counsel.\"\n\n\"Walking in ruin, one desires a teacher; learning in isolation, one desires a friend. Loquacity leads to exhaustion—better to abide in the center. Thus, glibness misses the mark. The hundred schools and myriad arts have their uses at times—thus, rambling lacks a home.\n\nThere is the archer’s shooting, and there is shooting that is not shooting. The rear arrow’s head striking the notch of the one before is nothing more than the later following the earlier. The arrow flying toward the pupil without the eye fluttering is nothing more than the full force of the arrow. This is the archer’s shooting—what doubt remains?\n\nIntention arises from the mind; with intention, minds differ. Thus, there is intention without mind, but without intention, minds are the same. Pointing is for indicating things; what is not pointed to is not reached. Thus, nothing is better than no pointing, for then all things are reached. Things cannot be exhausted. To insist on exhausting them is to be forever bound to existence. Thus, there is thing without exhausting, but one who exhausts things is ever present. That a shadow does not move means that whether the object is bent or straight, its shadow remains the same—thus, the explanation lies in change. That a single hair can draw a thousand jun means that the accumulation of the small, though not victorious alone, becomes victorious in sum—thus, the force is equal.\n\nYet though Gongsun Long can silence men’s mouths, he cannot win their hearts—this is the limit of the debater’s art.\" *Liezi* records this, no doubt to dispel the harm of perverse doctrines.\n\nYao ruled the world for fifty years, yet did not know whether the world was well governed or not, whether the myriad people wished to uphold him or not.
