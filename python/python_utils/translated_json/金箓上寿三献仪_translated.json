  "full_translation": "**The Golden Talisman Ritual for Presenting Three Offerings of Longevity**\n\n**Ritual Title:** *The Golden Talisman Ritual for Presenting Three Offerings of Longevity*.\n**One scroll.**\n**Source:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era), *Tongxuan* (Cavernous Mystery) section, **Threats and Rituals** category.\n\n**Ritual Proceedings:**\nWhen the first offering is made, the Way is illuminated—its blessings unfold like the auspicious opening of the Rainbow Pool.\nWhen the second and third offerings are presented, the radiance of the sun and moon extends to the Dragon Steps, where joyous celebration resounds.\n\n**The Officials of the Court, [Name] and others, humbly unite with the Ritual Officers of the age, in sincere joy and reverence.**\nWe bow our heads and kneel, offering repeated obeisance, and present our petition to:\nThe **Celestial Sovereign of the Northern Pole, the Purple Micro Emperor of the Central Heaven’s Star Host**,\nThe **clustered celestial luminaries of sun, moon, and stars**,\nThe **Emperor’s Personal Star, the Commanding Star of His Native Hour**,\nThe **Southern Pole Elder, the Star Lord of Longevity and Virtue**,\nThe **Highest Clarity Star Lord of Auspicious Virtue**,\nThe **Highest Clarity Star Lord of Auspicious Power**,\nThe **Imperial Throne’s Illuminating Star Officials and the Supreme Celestial Worthies Who Bow Over the Hosts of the Circumambient Heavens**.\n\n**With reverent devotion, we gaze upon the boundless benevolence,**\n**piercing the depths of the Way’s profound mirror.**\n\nWe have heard that:\nThe **Primordial Beginning** first revealed the cosmic diagram,\n**Dispersing the True Wind** across all existence;\nThe **Emptiness Sovereign** governed the celestial course,\n**Flowing the Way’s Dew** over the ten directions.\n\nThus, all within the world take form beneath the heavens,\nAnd the myriad realms obey the **Primordial Command**.\n\nWe, the subjects, in awe, observe that the **Emperor’s Majesty**,\n**Reverently occupies the Supreme Pole**,\n**Holds sway over the scales of all nations**;\n**Nurtures the common folk**,\n**Expands the domain of longevity** to the eight extremes.\n\nThe **harmonious *qi*** ascends and fills the celestial gate,\nWhile **joyous voices** resonate throughout the earth.\n\nNow, upon this sacred birthday,\nWe perform the **Primordial Beginning’s rites**,\n**Consecrating the Golden Talisman**,\n**Manifesting the Jade Platform’s realm**.\n\nWe bow our heads to the azure vault,\n**Humbly emulating the Three Blessings of Hua Peak**,\n**Returning our hearts to the Dao**,\nAnd pray for the **Emperor’s endless years**.\n\nWe earnestly beseech the **Most High Sage** to bestow grace,\nThat the **Primordial Lord** may bestow felicitous blessings.\n\nThe **Black Dragon** rides the sun’s chariot,\n**Accompanying the Jade and Pearl** in their celestial retinue;\nThe **Vermilion Phoenix** guards the imperial banner,\n**Descending in green palanquins and crimson carriages**.\n\nNo supplication is neglected,\nAnd all reverence is fulfilled.\n\nWe, the officials, **sincerely rejoice and offer homage**.\nWe bow our heads and kneel, offering repeated obeisance,\n**Present incense and libations** for the first offering.\n**The ritual proceedings commence with music.**\n\nWe have heard that great virtue originates from life,\nAnd the **Most High’s** sovereign authority extends without limit.\nOf the Five Blessings, the first is longevity—\nThe people’s deepest hopes are ever profound.\n\nThus, with sincere reverence, we humbly petition the **Heavenly Listener**,\nThat longevity may be granted through celestial favor.\n\nWe pray that Heaven’s discernment may be bestowed,\nAnd that our devout supplications may be fulfilled.\n\nReflecting upon our humble selves,\nWe, though unworthy, inherit the **Orthodox Dao’s** lineage,\nYet fail to grasp the **Three Mysteries’** profundity.\nIn purity and stillness, we are ashamed of our many transgressions;\nOur aspirations are faint and feeble—\nOur words and thoughts fall far short.\n\nFortunate to witness this auspicious era,\nWe rejoice in drawing near to the **Pure Radiance**.\nWith reverence, we meet this pivotal moment,\nAnd solemnly observe the **Primordial Lord’s** rites.\n\nWe humbly pray for the **Emperor’s** Majesty,\nThat one may bring blessings to all,\nAnd ten thousand realms may know peace.\nThe blessings of fortune, rank, and longevity—\nLike countless stars—\nShine resplendent upon the **Celestial Throne**;\nThe **Three Dynasties of Xia, Shang, and Zhou**\nHarmonize in radiant splendor within the **Heavenly Court**.\n\nMay **Eternal Joy and Great Clarity** prevail,\nAnd the realm of longevity be ever expanded.\n\nWe, the officials, **sincerely rejoice and offer homage**,\nBow our heads and kneel, offering repeated obeisance,\nPresent incense and libations for the **second offering**.\n**The ritual proceedings continue with music.**\n\nWe have heard that the gaze and hearing descend from Heaven,\nAnd the **Emperor’s** heart alone discerns the **Dao’s** simplicity.\nThe joyous acclamations stir the Earth,\nAs we pray for the **Sage’s** longevity to flow boundless.\n\nAt the convergence of **Yin-Yang’s** responsive moment,\nAnd the union of **Heaven-Earth’s** harmonizing virtue,\nWe, your servants, with earnest devotion,\nAnd utmost sincerity, fulfill our command.\n\nThe **Mysterious Rites** proceed in ordered succession,\nAs we pray for boundless blessings to descend upon the **Celestial Realm**.\nMay the **Way** endure without end,\nAnd **virtue/power** extend to near and far.\n\nThe **Eight Nodes** and **Four Seasons** bring perpetual **qi** to the **Celestial Throne**,\nWhile the **Three Celestial Stems** and **Six Heavenly Branches** align auspicious stars in cosmic balance.\n\nMay we extol the **State** with eternal years,\nAnd spread the flourishing harmony of the **Four Quarters**.\nThe **Heavenly Sovereign’s** benevolence is vast and bright,\nAnd the **Sage’s** radiance shines ever clear.\n\nWith loyal ministers in perfect accord,\nGood governance spreads throughout the lands;\nThe people rejoice and dance,\nTheir praises echoing to the eldest and youngest alike.\n\nThe **Golden Branches** bear blessings,\nAnd auspicious signs weave through the **Jade Calendar**.\nWe, your servants, **sincerely rejoice and offer homage**,\nBow our heads and kneel, offering repeated obeisance,\nPresent incense and libations for the **final offering**.\n\n**The ritual proceedings continue with music.**\nRecite the **Sutra of Pure Stillness**.\nSubmit the memorial.\nBurn the incense offerings.\n\nMay we, with utmost reverence, now turn our hearts to the past and present,\nAnd with profound sincerity, humbly present our words before the **Dao/Way**.\n\nWith earnest devotion, we lay out our offerings,\nAnd with sincerity, we present the **Law** and its rites,\nEnsuring all is complete and proper,\nAnd offering the mundane ceremonial forms.\n\nWe pray that Your **Sagely Truth** may look upon us with favor,\nAnd that Your **Divine Insight** may descend to discern our devotion.\n\nMay the **Celestial Pole** store auspicious omens,\nAnd the **Purple Court** [of Heaven] increase its celestial calculations.\n\nThe **Grand Enterprise** stands mighty and enduring,\nThrough the **Divine and Mysterious** cooperation of **Yin** and **Yang**’s protective power.\n\nThe **Vast Benevolence** flows unbound,\nSo that the people may fully enjoy the **Harmony and Prosperity**.\n\nMay the winds and rains be in perfect accord,\nAnd the land and heavens endure eternally.\n\nOnce more, we rely upon the **Dao/Way’s** power,\nWith devoted hearts, we invoke and chant:\n**\"The **Eternal Life Sovereign** of the **Mysterious Capital**.\"\n\n**Inconceivable merits and virtues** be bestowed.\n\nAll kneel and extol with threefold acclamation.\n\nThe rites conclude.\nThe **Golden Talisman** is presented for the **Threefold Longevity Offerings**.\nThe ceremonial proceedings are complete.",
