  "full_translation": "**The Mystic Praise of the Dao/Way and Its Virtue: Preface to the Mystic Praise of the Dao/Way and Its Virtue**\n\nBy **Song Luan**, newly appointed as the **Defense Judge of Yingzhou**, **Junior Official of the Great Justice Bureau**, and **Censorate Inspector**, humbly offering this work.\n\nI have heard that the pure and simple nature originates from the natural, and the source of wisdom springs from cultivation. Thus, it is known that knotting cords to mark numbers and refining civilization could be practiced in the age of **Great Antiquity**. Yet, the emotions of joy and sorrow arise from the **Five Phases** and transform with the **Harmonious Qi** of moderation. Once language and writing were established, the distinction between the virtuous and the foolish emerged. Even before **Emperor Yao** and **Emperor Shun**, wars and conflicts began, yet they still followed the **Dao/Way**. At the time of **King Tang** and **King Wu**, the **Dao/Way** was neglected as they pursued conquest. Afterward, the **fiefdoms were divided like scattered stones**, and the **pao tree** bestowed favors—those who aided their rulers sought glory, while schemers plotted for power. The decline of the **Zhou dynasty** began when the king hunted at **Henyang**, where the **Jin Wen** alliance was formed, and the **Heavenly King** attended the gathering. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* discreetly omitted this, simply recording \"the king hunted at **Henyang**.\"\n\nAs the **Zhou dynasty** weakened, debates arose over **gaining worthy men** and **losing worthy men**, and discussions of **flourishing states** and **declining states** proliferated. All sought clever arguments, their tongues twisting in vain. Some refused **yellow gold** yet demanded it, while others scorned **white jade** yet coveted it. **Su Qin** adorned his family by wearing the **seal of office**, **Zhang Lu** strengthened his state to erase his shame, **Li Si** ascended to high rank, and **Bu Wei** sighed in obscurity. In that era, the **eloquent persuasions** of a single moment could bring glory, while **tenfold honors** were grasped in an instant. Yet they failed to grasp that harming the **noble qi**, chasing fleeting fame—initially thriving in prosperity, they ultimately perished in ruin.\n\nThen came the **hunted stag** and the **soaring dragon**. The **Qin dynasty** collapsed, its chariots crossing the **Sea Bridge** amid **blue waves**. The **Han Emperor** rose, his **sword of destiny** leaning against the **Azure Sky**. As **civilization flourished** and **culture thrived**, the **Four Cardinal Directions** were bound by **writings and governance**, and all living beings felt the **transformative power** of the **Dao/Way**, finding ease in its flow. The **Eight Seas** became clear mirrors, and the **Nine Regions** settled in stillness—deceitful words could not prevail, while the **authentic and profound** winds were restored.\n\nThus arose **Yang Zi Yun**, **Dongfang Shuo**, **Li Yuan**, and **Yuan An**, all like **radiant stars** and **exalted talents**, their fragrance spreading like **orchids and osmanthus**. They indulged in **classics and lore**, yet delayed their ambitions. For they understood that **Su Qin’s wearing of the seal** to honor his family was inferior to **Yang Zi Yun’s taking up arms** to serve the **Han**; **Zhang Lu’s strengthening of his state** to erase his shame was not as noble as **Dongfang Shuo’s feigning humility** by offering his flesh; **Li Si’s ascent to prominence** was less worthy than **Li Yuan’s perpetual refusal** of lavish rewards; and **Bu Wei’s lament in obscurity** paled compared to **Yuan An’s quiet retreat** to his thatched cottage.\n\nThey did not harbor **vain and deceitful thoughts**, but only recognized the **allotted fates** of poverty and wealth. When used, they shone like **pearls returned to their streams**, radiant and resplendent; when abandoned, they lay hidden like **jade buried in mountains**, yet still retaining their **gentle warmth**. With **measured advancement and retreat**, they found **ease in the Dao/Way**, ever serene in their own being. They contemplated the **mystic origins** of the **Supreme Good** and followed the **principles of the Great Changes**, avoiding **excessive striving**, and drawing near to **tranquil harmony**.\n\nIn reflection of the **Four Virtuous Ones** whose fame endures through ages, I recall the **retreat to the Yan Platform** and the **plots by the Wei River**. Though I deem myself **base and unworthy**, I dare to speak and compose, only to **aspire to the lofty teachings** and **fan the true winds**. I seek to **promote the Four Virtues** to calm the **four cardinal regions**, using the **Three Treasures** to **comfort the people**. All should return to **simplicity and purity**, casting off **superficial adornments**.\n\nThus, I boldly interpret the *Dao/Way Dejing*, weaving **Ba-style songs**, following each chapter’s theme to **chant its essence**. Sometimes, I divide a single line for **separate verses**; other times, I compose an entire poem to **narrate its meaning**. Though not refined like the *Sao* or *Ya*, I still admire the **mystic subtleties**, sincerely offering my **devoted heart** to those who **discern the profound**.\n\n**Volume One: Mystic Praise of the Dao/Way Dejing**\n**Chapter One: \"The Dao/Way That Can Be Spoken Of\"**\nDo not confuse the **Dao/Way** with the **True Dao/Way**,\nNor tarnish the **Great Name** with common speech.\nThe *Dao/Way Dejing* says:\n*The Dao/Way that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao/Way*;\n*The name that can be named is not the eternal name.*\n\nOnly when **desires are abandoned** can the **pure and simple** be preserved,\nFor **action and striving** will always **regret cleverness**.\nThe *Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\n*If a person can always abandon desire, they may perceive the Dao/Way’s essence.*\n*Essence refers to a single, unclouded mind.*\n\nThe **mind’s source** is straight and clear, its **Dao/Way** pure and still,\nWhile **emotions** are crooked, needing **sweeping and leveling**.\nOnly through **diligent practice** can one truly **penetrate and understand**,\nYet **clarity and turbidity** are already born within.\n\nThe *Dao/Way Dejing* says:\n*Without the **Dao/Way of Non-Action**, the beginning of heaven and earth would not exist.*\n*Beginning refers to the **Dao/Way’s origin**.*\n\n**Chapter Two: \"The World Knows the Dao/Way\"**\nCultivate **virtue/power** to leave behind **glory and wealth**,\nYet **Emperor Yi** and **Emperor Kang** achieved **great deeds** through **non-action**.\nDo good without **boasting**, yet **reach the utmost goodness**,\nAchieve success without **taking credit**, for it is **distinctive merit**.\nThe *Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\n*Those who do not dare to rest in their **virtue/power** yet still cultivate it—*\n*They forget their deeds yet their merit remains,*\n*They do not cling yet are not abandoned.*\n\nIf one can **nurture the Three Treasures** in **stillness and tranquility**,\nThey will **attain the Dao/Way of wordless instruction**,\n**Establishing a name** while **preserving life** is worthy of admiration,\nYet even a **simple boat** cannot be detained by the **Five Lakes’ winds**.\nThe *Dao/Way Dejing* says:\n*Only those who achieve success*\n*Do not dwell in their rank.*\n\n**Fan Li** achieved success and **fulfilled his name**,\nThen **vanished into the Five Lakes**.\n\n**Chapter Three: \"Not Exalting the Worthy\"**\nTo **abolish superficiality** and **not exalt the worthy**,\nThe *Dao/Way Dejing* says:\n*Do not exalt the worthy.*\n\nInstead, **abandon gold and jade** to the **mountains and streams**.\nThe *Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\n*The ruler does not indulge in rare delicacies—*\n*Gold is cast into the mountains,*\n*Jade is discarded into the streams.*\n\n**Merit and fame** are not **boasted of**, returning to **simplicity and purity**,\n**Lusts and cravings** are **extinguished**, merging with **nature**.\nThe *Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\n*Do not seek merit and fame, return to nature.*\n*Again, it says:*\n*Eliminate lusts and cravings,*\n*Abandon vexation and confusion.*\n\nThe **virtuous scholar** can **embrace simplicity**,\nYet even the **beautiful woman** cannot **compare to rustic elegance**.\nThe *Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\n*Discard the **music of Zheng**,*\n*Keep distant from **flatterers**.*\n\nWith **empty mind and full belly**, diligently **cultivate the Dao/Way**,\nThe *Dao/Way Dejing* says:\n*Empty its mind,*\n*Fill its belly.*\n\nObtaining **effortless action** is the **mystic realm**.\n**Chapter Four: Dao’s Purity**—\nConceal reputation, treasure **virtue/power** to preserve the body,\nDo not let idle worries disturb the **true Dao/Way**.\n\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\n*The Dao hides its name, conceals its reputation—*\n*Its use lies within.*\n\nAs an official in **Lacquer Garden**, **Zhuangzi** tempered sharpness,\nGuarding **Hangu Pass**, he blended with the common dust.\n*The Dao/Way* says:\n*Dull its sharpness.*\n*Again, it says:*\n*Blend with the dust.*\n\n**Zhuangzi** served as **Lacquer Garden’s** keeper,\n**Yin Zheng** as **Hangu Pass’s** warden.\n\nCalmly mingling with the world like clear water,\nHis years extended like the **Great Mulberry Tree**.\n\nBefore **Xuanlao’s** birth, he preserved **tranquility**,\nJust as the **Qishu Tree** steadies **Eternal Spring**.\n\n*The Dao/Way* says:\n*I do not know whose child he was,*\n*Before **Xuanlao’s** birth.*\n*Again, it comments:*\n*Those who endure today*\n*Are those who can remain tranquil and serene,*\n*Free from toil,*\n*Seeking to guide others in **cultivating the body** and **embracing the Dao/Way**.*\n\n**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth’s Impartiality**—\nHeaven and Earth bestow **mercy**, equally nurturing all things,\nYet they regard humans as **yellow dogs**—seemingly without favor.\n\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\n*Heaven and Earth give birth to myriad things,*\n*Yet humans are most precious.*\n*They view them like **worthless grass** or **beasts**,*\n*Demanding no repayment.*\n\n**Empty and unobstructed**, life flourishes naturally,\n**Emotions and desires** forgotten—**purity** remains.\n\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\n*Between Heaven and Earth lies **emptiness**,*\n*Where **vast qi** flows freely,*\n*Thus all things arise spontaneously.*\n*If one eliminates **emotions and desires**,*\n*Moderates **appetites**,*\n*Cleanses the **Five Zang**,*\n*The **spirit** will dwell there.*\n\nCherish **qi**, nourish **jing**—**virtue/power** must be guarded,\nPreserve the body, dispel **afflictions**—**truth** lies in few words.\n\n*The Dao/Way* says:\n*Many words lead to exhaustion,*\n*Better to **embrace centrality**.*\n*Again, it comments:*\n*Better to **guard virtue/power within**,*\n*Nurture the **spirit** and **qi**,*\n*Cherish silence.*\n\nThus, contemplating **mystical stillness** to fathom subtle truths,\nOne must seek those who **cultivate a tranquil heart** to discuss.\n\n**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit**—\n**Round and pure**, it bears **thick vitality**—\nThe **root of all things** lies in the **Dark Feminine’s Gate**, the **Land of Immortality**.\n\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\n*The **Land of Immortality** lies in the **Dark Feminine**.*\n*Playful (Xuan) is Heaven—*\n*In humans, the **nose**.*\n*Feminine (Pìn) is Earth—*\n*In humans, the **mouth**.*\n\nBoldly emerging from the **mundane dust**, nothing is lost,\nIn stillness, **true qi** harmonizes—**relaxation** unfolds.\n\nWhen the **Six Emotions** dissolve like ice melting,\nThe **Five Natures** align—**orange fragrance** blooms.\n\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\n*The **Five Natures** are **ghosts of the day** (arcana),*\n*The **Six Emotions** are **ghosts of the night** (vitality).*\n*If one eliminates the **Six Emotions** and purifies the **Five Natures**,*\n*Then the **Dark Feminine’s Gate** is attained.*\n\n**Yanluo’s Child**—\nGreat as a **bullet**, yellow as an **orange**,\nEmerging from the **Jade Pool**, entering the **Golden Chamber**.\n\nWhen applied, its **merit** is fulfilled—\nOne will naturally meet the **Emperor of Emptiness** at the **forked path**.\n\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\n*The use of the **Dark Feminine** is endless and subtle.*\n\n「When applied, its use is without contrivance—\nThus no labor is exerted.\n\n**Chapter Seven: Heaven and Earth’s Enduring Dao/Way**\nHeaven and Earth stretch boundless, their logic profound and subtle,\nSelf-effacement alone reveals the hidden principle.\n\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nHeaven and Earth nurture life—**virtue/power** vast and manifold,\nYet endure eternally because they draw from the Dao/Way,\nNot boasting of their creative function.\n\nThe outer body thus attains longevity and firmness,\nYet selflessness brings all goodness to fruition.\n\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nPlace others before yourself.\nAgain it says:\nThe outer body forgotten, the heart serene—\nOnly then does the body endure.\n\nThe **caterpillar** bends, buried in mud, concealing its might,\nThe **jade** hides in deep valleys, yet radiance remains secret.\n\nIf one upholds the **Way’s** boundless, selfless transformation,\nLet not the **active mind** stray from the Dao/Way.\n\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nThe sage is without self, yet enriched—\nThus their **virtue/power** is fulfilled.\n\n**Chapter Eight: Nourishing Above Like Water**\nThe highest **virtue/power** is like water’s nature—gentle,\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *The highest **virtue/power** is like water.*\nYet it cannot be obstructed by the **lowly and hungry**.\n\n偶穿积霭离幽壑，\n\n「What then of the willows drooping toward the Imperial Canal?\nWater’s beneficence flows, balancing all things,\nYet ever returns—never trapped by a lone boat’s drift.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *Water benefits all things.*\nSquare or round, it adapts to vessels’ form,\nRefining its currents through wisdom’s art;\nNo need for Qin’s emperors to ride the sea—\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nIn all affairs, to act with natural ease,\nLike water’s flow—square or round, shaped by its vessel,\nUnbound by things, yet ever in accord.\n**Chapter Nine: Holding Fullness Like the Void**\nThe emptiest white is heart’s truest state—\nFullness is what one must shun.\nDo not let high rank corrupt your natural grace.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *Fullness leads to loss, yet stopping is better.*\nTo hold what is full is to invite its fall—\nBetter to cease than to be overthrown.\nAgain it says: *Wealth and honor bring arrogance,\nAnd ruin comes from one’s own hand.*\n\nSun Heng preserved his fortune through humility,\nHao Qin held fast to legacy’s grace.\nGongsun Hong, in quiet virtue, welcomed guests,\nYet prized modesty—thus his wealth increased.\nChangsha Wang Wu’s descendants, too, by virtue kept,\nTheir honor passed through careful, steadfast hands.\n\nYet see the carriage-riders lost in endless schemes,\nWho dream of peach groves, not the Three Pure Ones.\nFan Li and Zhang Liang, though clad in rank’s display,\nNever forgot the Dao/Way’s path.\nTo float the lake and fast from grain—\nBoth left their glory, yet their names remain bright.\nFan Li drifted on the lake, Zhang Liang starved his flesh.\n**Chapter Ten: Embracing the Spirit’s Essence**\nHold fast to One—let not the body stray.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *Can one embrace the One and not depart?*\nLove the people, raise the land—yet act without design.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nTo nurture all, to govern with care,\nCan one do so without interference?\nThen must one transform through selflessness.»\n\n「。\n　　The Three Spirits at peace extend life’s span,\nYet Four Reachings’ clarity they fail to see.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nWhen Spirits rest, the Dao/Way’s *qi* flows undisturbed,\nAnd peace of mind prolongs both life and years.\nAgain it says: *Can one be bright and Four-Reaching yet know nothing?*\n\nGuard single-mindedly the Spirit’s Essence and preserve the vast *qi*,\nYet once distinctions arise, the childlike innocence is lost.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nTo focus solely on the boundless *qi*,\nAnd rule with gentle harmony—\nIf one can remain as innocent as a child,\nWithout clinging to dual distinctions.\n\nWhen deeds are done, let not the axe be raised—\nThus virtue’s depth is manifest.\nOnly then does one lay the foundation for Sun’s strategy through ages.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nThe Dao/Way nurtures all things,\nGrows vast yet never severs—\nIt serves as vessel and instrument.\nAgain it says: *Since it does not rule as sovereign,*\nThose who can thus remain—\nAre said to possess the profound virtue of the Dao/Way.\n\n**Chapter Thirty: The Thirty Spokes**\nEmpty as the hub, yet one with the Dao’s mystery,\nThe thirty spokes fulfill their function with depth.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nAncient chariots had thirty spokes,\nFollowing the cycles of the moon.\nAll converging at the hub—\nThe hub, with its hollow core,\nWhere all spokes are gathered.\nTo govern the self, one must purge emotion and desire,\nEmpty the Five Viscera—\nThen the Spirit returns to its source.\nTo govern the state, one must gather all under a single strength,\nAnd uphold the mighty.\nClarify its principle:\nThe clay vessel, formed yet empty, holds its capacity,\nWindows and doors open—\nThe Dao/Way is found within.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nClay vessels are shaped from earth,\nYet their emptiness allows them to contain.\nAgain it says: *The vessel’s hollowness receives and holds.*\nAgain it says: *Windows and doors, though empty,*\nLet people observe and pass through,\nIllustrating the boundless use of the Dao/Way.\n\nUnsoiled by right and wrong, one nourishes the True Nature in obscurity,\nYet laments the world’s desires while tuning the Spirit’s strings in silence.\nWith one uncluttered mind, all minds submit—\nOnly then does the mind of transcendent ease emerge.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nThe void shapes the manifest.\n**Chapter Five: The Five Colors**\nIf one can debase the eyes and dissolve the Six Passions,\nThen the belly’s needs alone shall govern—\nLike a horse adjusted to its harness.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:\nThus the Sage acts for the belly, not the eyes.\nFor the belly means to purge the Six Passions,\nAnd debasing the eyes means no reckless gazing.\n\nWhen the mouth grows wanton, green with envy for refined feasts,\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:\nThe Five Flavors make the mouth reckless.\nReckless, it speaks in vain—\nLost to the Dao/Way.\nWhen the heart runs wild, it’s as though galloping after gold in the hunt.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:\nTo chase and hunt across fields,\nMakes the heart grow mad.\nAgain it says:\nTo race through worldly affairs,\nClinging to action—\nLike the hunter’s relentless pursuit,\nOnly seeking slaughter,\nThe heart follows, chasing after gains,\nStill while thinking—\nThis is the madness of the heart.\n\nTo rise above dust, one must follow the Heavenly Crane’s path,\nYet drowning in俗， one must awaken to sever the Dao’s strings.\nAbandon desire and uphold the True Doctrine’s simplicity—\nWithout dwelling in caves or valleys, one finds true ease.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: Honor and Humiliation as Startling**\nThe Venerable Master descends with clear intent:\nHonor and humiliation—\nBoth are cause for alarm.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:\nHonor and humiliation as startling.\nWhy sully oneself in lowly station?\nWhen merit is earned, let it fade—\nAnd yield to greater glory.\nGan Tang bore the cauldron to aid the enlightened ruler,\nFan Li fled in a humble boat to preserve his name.\nYi Yin bore the cauldron for Gan Tang—\nHis deeds were vast and his aid profound.\nFan Li took the humble boat and fled—\nForever safeguarding his merit and fame.\nTo curb worldly dust and expand vast aid,\nWhen deeds are done, retire to preserve one’s path.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Unseen**\nXi Yi, the Obscure, and the Minute—\nAll three merge as one.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:\nThe Obscure, the Minute, and the Vast—\nThese three blend into unity.\nIn motion, endless as the cord’s pull,\nYet cannot be named—\nBeyond the hues of *xuan* and *huang*,\nNot to be grasped by sight.\nDo not compare it to tones and rhythms,\nFor it is soundless.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nThe cord’s endless pull—\nUnnamable, for it is not a single hue,\nNot to be divided by green, yellow, red, white, or black.\nNot a single sound,\nNot to be distinguished by the five tones.\nNot a single form,\nNot to be measured by length, breadth, or size.\n\nPurge emotion and desire—\nThe True Nature’s wind gathers.\nCling to the ancient, align with the present—\nThe ultimate transformation clears.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nTo uphold the ancient Dao/Way’s non-action,\nAnd govern the present’s affairs—\nThen one returns to simplicity and purity.\n\nExpand the Dao/Way without division or obscurity,\nCommunicate universally above and below—\nThus clarity shines.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:\nIts upper reaches are not dazzling,\nIts lower depths are not murky.\nAgain it says:\nThose above must be clear,\nThose below must be murky.\nYet the Dao/Way is neither above nor below,\nNor is it clear or murky in itself.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Sage’s Conduct**\nThe ancient Sage who excelled in virtue\nGuarded the Dao’s mysterious path.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nMysterious—\nLike Heaven’s vastness.\nHis resolve and conduct were profound,\nBeyond the Dao/Way’s reach.\nInner vision as blind,\nReturned hearing as deaf—\nYet he knew its length.\nSteady as winter’s river crossing,\nHis True Nature revealed.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:\nSteady as crossing a river in winter.\nAgain it says:\nSteady—\nUnruffled ease.\nThe Sage, in times of transition,\nActs like crossing winter’s river,\nWhile common folk cling and fear.\nNow I am unsoiled,\nThus my ease is steady.\n\nDissolving like ice in spring,\nThe world’s dust vanishes.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:\nDissolving like ice about to melt.\nAgain it says:\nDissolving—\nScattering and fading,\nPurging emotion, abandoning desire—\nEach day grows clearer,\nLike spring ice melting away.\n\nSlowly purified, none recognize—\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nWater murky must first be stilled,\nThen gradually clears itself.\nYet even in murkiness,\nIt can blend with the common.\n\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nThe muddy guards its original truth,\nThe murky does not reflect.\nTo blend with the common yet not exalt oneself.\n\nPreserve one’s resolve without swelling like the pine’s stubborn grip,\nGuard its flaws and in obscurity achieve success.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nTo uphold this gradual, growing Dao/Way,\nWithout indulging in excess or rigid fullness.»\n\n「Again it says: One must not cling to anything.\nIf one clings to purity and seeks life,\nThis is called excess and fullness,\nAnd one will lose this Dao/Way.\n\nAgain it says: Only those who do not indulge in excess can preserve their flaws,\nAnd not be destroyed by newfound success.\nThose who embrace their flaws hide their glory,\nThose who achieve new success value their accomplishments.\n\nChapter Sixteen: *The Chapter of Extreme Emptiness*\nTo attain purity of heart and simplicity of conduct, reaching the state of extreme emptiness,\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nThose who attain the Dao/Way\nDiminish their emotions and abandon their desires,\nTheir five viscera remain serene,\nAnd thus they reach extreme emptiness.\nWith steadfast resolve, they transcend the world’s dust.\n\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nTo uphold serene stillness,\nAnd practice profound sincerity.\nAll things return to their roots, clearly revealing the Dao/Way’s instruction,\nAnd one contentedly follows its natural course.\n\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nAll things wither without fail,\nEach returns to its origin,\nAnd thus they regenerate.\nThe heart, like an empty valley, holds vast capacity,\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nTo know and guard the True Constant,\nThe heart’s realm becomes empty and serene,\nLike that valley, containing all things without limit.\n\nVirtue aligns with the central heavens, evenly covering all.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nVirtue harmonizes with the heavens,\nThus merging with the Dao/Way.\n\nThe Dao/Way ensures enduring longevity and blessings.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nTo merge with the Dao/Way,\nOne attains long-lasting endurance.\nTo reveal the peril of eternal decay,\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nTo follow the Dao/Way as the heavens do,\nOne’s body ultimately returns to them—\nThe fate of eternal decay and peril.\n\nChapter Seventeen: *The Chapter of the Supreme Sovereign*\nGovernance must emulate the age of primordial simplicity,\nIlluminating like the sun, without partiality.\n\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nThe Supreme Sovereign refers to the ruler of the ancient, nameless age.\nThose who know of his existence below,\nYet fail to see the natural purity of things,\nAre beneath him.\n\nWhen accomplishments are fulfilled and affairs settled, the world grows tranquil,\nYet none know of the drudging labor of digging wells or plowing fields.\n\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nWhen deeds are done without clinging,\nAnd affairs accomplished without action,\nThe common folk live their daily lives unaware—\nThis is the Supreme Sovereign’s natural way.\n\nTo distance oneself from artificiality and return to pristine simplicity,\nRestoring the true Dao/Way,\nAnd to observe the constant, fearing disrespect to preserve grand principles.\n\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nVirtue declines, rulers grow corrupt,\nAnd people cannot bear their lives—\nThus they are driven by punishments and feared.\nEmotions are harbored, deceit is practiced,\nYet they cannot discern, so they are disrespected.\nIf a ruler’s trust and balance were sufficient,\nWould his subjects dare to deceive him openly?\n\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *\"Trust is insufficient when there is distrust.\"*\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nWhen a ruler’s trust is insufficient,\nHis subjects below harbor distrust.\n\nChapter Eighteen: *The Chapter of the Great Dao’s Decline*\nWithout revering the Great Dao/Way, distinctions of benevolence and righteousness arise.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *\"When the Great Dao/Way is abandoned, benevolence and righteousness appear.\"*\n\nWhen filial piety is lost, distinctions of familial affection and compassion emerge.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *\"When the six bonds of kinship are fractured, filial piety and compassion arise.\"*\n\nWhen the reins of governance cannot be forgotten, distinctions of action and inaction appear.\n\nThe ruler’s governance is like a rotting rope guiding six horses.\nOnly by knotting cords can the principle of *wuwei* be harmonized.\nIn the age of antiquity, governance was conducted through knotted cords.\nWhen talent soars to eight bushels, hypocrisy and deceit arise.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *\"When wisdom emerges, great deceit appears.\"*\n\nLoyalty meets its end with the Three Loyal Ministers as the nation’s fate declines.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *\"When a state is in chaos, loyal ministers arise.\"*\nThis refers to Duke Mu of Qin, who buried the Three Loyal Ministers alive.\n\nEven when all stars withdraw their brilliance,\nThe sun’s radiance still shines universally across the horizon.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says: *\"In the age of the Great Dao/Way,\nbenevolence and righteousness vanish, filial piety and compassion fade—\nyet the sun remains resplendent, and the stars lose their light.\"*\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: *The Chapter of Abandoning the Sage and Discarding Wisdom***\nWhen both sageliness and wisdom are cast aside, vast *qi* flows pure and clear.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *\"Abandon the sage, discard wisdom.\"*\n\nWhere does one employ cleverness in cultivating the self?\nThe Master of *Xuan* [Zhuangzi] guards the Mysterious, transcending the world.\nZhuangzi wandered freely, abandoning sageliness and wisdom,\npreserving the True Dao/Way, and wrote *The True Classic of the South* [Nanhua Zhenjing] for the world.\n\nThose who turn from the Dao/Way and boast of culture only invite ridicule.\nQiao Heng, styled Zhengping, relied on his schemes and often acted arrogantly.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: *The Chapter of Abandoning Learning and Having No Worries***\nTo drag the tortoise’s tail and float on the turtle’s shell—\nnature’s way is to preserve life’s true essence.\nThe sacred tortoise, trailing its tail, preserves its nature whole;\nthe mountain wood, rooted in the earth, thrives without artifice.\nFew desires and little self—return to purity’s simplicity.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *\"Few desires, little self.\"*\n\nOnly then does one ascend to the Vermilion Terrace—\nthe Celestial Capital.\nThe Vermilion Terrace—this is the heart.\nIf one accumulates virtue and practice,\nthe Celestial Capital and Penglai Mountain appear

heavens are empty and tranquil—\nthe stars shine brightly in order.\n\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"The heavens follow the Dao’s purity and emptiness,\nthus they are exalted and never sullied by worldly things.\"\n\nThe thick earth is settled and peaceful—\nthe Nine Regions lie undisturbed.\n\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"The earth follows the Dao’s yielding and compliance,\nthus it is stable and peaceful,\nenduring all things without ever tipping or moving.\"\n\nThe Sovereign’s deeds are vast and far-reaching,\nwhile the mountain-dwelling recluse acts alone in seclusion.\n\nThe Sovereign of the Xuān Dynasty pacified the troubles of Chī Yóu,\nsaving all beings,\nand the people received eternal blessings,\nspreading everlasting beauty.\n\nThough the Prince of the State of Wáng (子晋) may have charmed the phoenix with his flute,\ncrossed the world on the dragon,\nand saved himself alone—\nuntainted by dust—\nhis kindness extended to all,\nyet he lacked the true techniques of salvation.\n\n---\n\nChapter Forty: *The Dao’s Movement of Return*\n\nThe ruler seeks the Mystic Gate without wearying—\nthe spirit’s traces emerge, manifesting as the Pine and the Qiao.\n\nThe Pine Child (赤松子) and Wáng Qiao (王乔),\nboth ancient masters who attained the Dao and transcended the world.\n\nThe tranquil earth’s axis generates all things broadly,\nwhile the heavens’ movements harmonize the sequence of qi.\n\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"As the heavens are strong and vigorous,\nthey move the sun and moon in day and night,\nand the four seasons cycle endlessly without rest.\nThus, those who cultivate the Dao,\nif they can clear their hearts,\nmove the qi within their bodies day and night without pause—\nthey align with the heavens’ enduring nature.\n\nIt further notes:\n\"The things of heaven and earth are all things.\nThe Dao is *有* (yǒu, existence).\nThe Dao generates all things,\nthus we know that the things of heaven and earth are born from *有*,\nand *有* arises from *无* (wú, non-existence).\nIf all things attain the Dao’s essence—\nthe harmonious interplay of the strong and yielding—\nthey will achieve longevity and swift transformation.\nHence, it is said:\n*The things of heaven and earth are born from existence,\nexistence from non-existence.*\"\n\nThe worthy minister plans strategies for governance—\nto aid and assist in the realm’s affairs.\n\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"Those who wield authority must return to reality,\nand those who act must rely on non-action.\nIf one can forget both authority and reality,\nand erase both existence and non-existence,\nthey embody the principle of aiding and assisting in governance.\"\n\nThe Perfect Ones cultivate and attain true freedom.\n\nThose who cultivate their bodies discard cleverness and brilliance,\nconceal their light, and refine their practice—\nin quietude, they find freedom and ease.\nYet they do not know the Dao of aiding and assisting in governance.\n\nTo govern oneself and the realm in hidden merit is sufficient—\none will naturally ascend to the Vermilion Gate’s court.\n\nIf one governs their body fully and achieves success in the realm,\nthey will follow the Pine Child and Wáng Qiao,\nascending together to the Vermilion Gate.\n\n---\n\nChapter Forty-One: *The Virtue/Power of the Superior*\n\nThe Superior, Middle, and Inferior all hear the Dao,\nyet their acceptance and practice differ in origin.\n\nThe Superior, upon hearing the Dao, acts with resolve—\nthe Inferior, lost in confusion, laughs in derision.\n\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* says:\n\"The Superior, upon hearing the Dao, acts with resolve.\nThe Middle, upon hearing the Dao, clings to it uncertainly.\nThe Inferior, upon hearing the Dao, laughs in derision.\nTo not laugh is insufficient for the Dao.\"\n\nAdvancing is like stepping into a deep abyss—\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* says:\n\"Advancing in the Dao is like retreating.\"\n\nClarity is like floating clouds reflecting distant space.\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"Clarity in the Dao conceals its traces,\nnurturing its purity,\nwhich is the Sage’s true achievement.\"\n\nCultivating Virtue/Power is like stealing merit—\none’s name is inscribed in the Jade Emperor’s palace.\n\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"Virtue/Power is cultivated inwardly,\nyet outwardly appears as if stolen,\ndesiring no recognition,\nand achieving merit without ostentation.\"\n\n---\n\nChapter Forty-Two: *The Dao Generates the One*\n\nTeach others softness and frailty as precious,\nto preserve their bodies whole and intact.\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"When rulers seek to teach others,\nthey should instruct them in the Way of softness,\nfrailty, humility, and modesty.\"\n\nBelieve that force and rigidity lose their nature.\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* states:\n\"Those who rely on force and rigidity\ndo not meet their natural end.\"\n\nHumble the will and hold to modesty—\nvirtue stands as a towering mountain.\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"Kings and nobles who embrace solitude and humility,\nlowering themselves to preserve their virtue,\ndo not they thereby diminish themselves\nwhile gaining greater benefit?\"\n\nExcessive desires harm the mind—\nthey sow confusion in the fields of emotion.\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"The foolish value arrogance and deception to seek advancement,\nwhile greedily hoarding wealth they gain—\ndo not they thereby gain what harms them?\"\n\nThe moon hangs in autumn’s clarity,\nilluminating a thousand leagues.\nThe rivers surge with roaring waves,\nstirring the hundred streams.\n\nThe *Viceroy Fan* drifts beyond fame,\nhis light dust scorns worldly affairs,\nriding the winds upon the Five Lakes’ boat.\nFan Li, renouncing glory, fled to Yue,\nfollowing his nature on the Five Lakes,\nmay be said to embody the Dao\nand awaken to its truth first.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three: *The Dao of the Utterly Soft***\nThe utterly soft overcomes the utterly firm—\n\n—\n\n「The *Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\nThe utterly soft of the world—\nthat is the true nature of things.\nIf one roams through worldly affairs,\nentangled in the dusty realm,\nwith passions and desires overflowing,\nthen it becomes the utterly firm of the world.\nAt this moment, when the utterly soft overcomes the utterly firm,\nit reveals how the utterly firm cannot rival the utterly soft’s true nature.\n\nThe dusty realm is hard to confuse—\nonly those who hold fast to the uncarved can remain undisturbed.\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\nThose who possess nothing are untouched by the dusty realm.\nLet the mind be empty of all things,\nguard the solitary purity of the uncarved and the tranquil stillness,\nperfectly embodying the undivided whole—\nunshaken by desires,\nnever disrupted by the alluring.\n\nBelieve not in silence as mere closure of the mouth,\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\nSilence is not about sealing the mouth—\nin principle, it is both presence and absence;\nin teaching, it is both speech and tacit understanding.\nEven as speech fills the world,\nthere is no fault in the doctrine of silence.\n\nOnly now does it become clear:\nThe benefit of *having* comes from *non-being*.\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\nI know the benefit of *non-being*.\nBefore the frost, the crane’s call harmonizes with the celestial melody,\nat the snow’s edge, the upright pine stands beyond the vulgar.\n\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\nWhen my body and mind are tranquil and still,\nI can align with the Dao.\nBody still, mind clear, desires forgotten—\nthe Jade Capital imagined is the first stage.\nIf one follows the Dao,\nthey must see the paths diverging from the Jade Capital.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four: *The Dao of What Is Truly Near***\nWhich is closer: name or self?\nThe more one treasures, the more one must perish thickly.\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* states:\n\"Excessive hoarding brings thick destruction.\"\nIf one knows when to stop, they are wise and virtuous.\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"Knowing when to stop brings no peril.\"\nChasing fame invites disaster—\nthe body lost as if bereaved.\nA damp house, abundant wealth—\nyet such matters can wound.\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\nThose who pursue wealth seek it,\nbut when wealth is gained, the body perishes—\nwhich is more: the body or the wealth?\nThus, they cast away jade and shatter pearls\nto preserve their harmony.\n\nAlas, if one feeds on wealth while the body perishes,\neven if one piles jade at home,\nwhat value is there in it?\n\nThe wind passes through the Unending Palace,\nswaying the lush grass.\nThe Unending Palace—\nbuilt by Xiao He, a thousand gates, ten thousand halls—\nwas once the world’s grandest splendor.\nNow it has withered into mere grass,\nits foundations still standing, empty.\nSeeing this rise and fall,\nit is enough to warn against greed.\n\nThe waters flow through the Golden Valley,\ncarrying the slanting sunlight.\nThe Golden Valley—\nonce a place of noble grandeur,\nrecorded in the *Simple Records*—\nnow has wild waters coursing through it,\nsuddenly become a ruined fortress,\nbathed in the slanting light—\nhow could one not grieve?\n\nThe *Dao of Perfect Truth* requires the mind to be desireless—\nit would laugh at the Lord of Sui for his prized *Night Light*.\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"Name is the guest of substance,\nyet those who serve others for the sake of name lose their own.\"\nLet them abandon merit to preserve their truth.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five: *The Dao of Great Perfection***\nThose who do not concern themselves with agitation or stillness—\nPrthagṛṇha equalizes all things and frees the mind from dust.\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* states:\n\"Agitation overcomes cold, stillness overcomes heat.\"\nFurther notes:\nOnly those who are utterly tranquil and do nothing\ncan have a peaceful mind and steady resolve,\nand thus truly overcome agitation without cold,\nand stillness without heat.\nErasing both agitation and stillness,\nthey become the world’s norm.\n\nStraight thinking finds no successor in Ji Dan,\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"The most straight can seem bent.\"\nJi Dan—\na true and upright minister of the Han,\nwho spoke boldly and corrected the ruler,\nnever avoiding taboo—\nwho can follow him?\n\nSophisticated reasoning invites harm—\nas seen in Su Qin’s fate.\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* states:\n\"The most eloquent can seem inarticulate.\"\nSu Qin—\nthe wandering orator of the Six States.\nThough his cleverness flourished,\nhe valued superficiality.\nLater, in Qi, he was assassinated,\nhis head cut off—\nyet he loved the seals of the Six States,\nand feared not the calamity of a single morning.\nProud of his eloquence and relying on his wit,\nshould he not be feared?\n\nWhite jade stains the body—\neven as it is pure.\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"When learning and practice reach great perfection,\nthey are always as if stained by imperfection.\"\nThe Clear River holds the same depth with all beings.\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"Empty and pure in the heart—\nthis is the way of holding fullness.\nFull yet not overflowing,\nthey long endure in wealth and honor,\ntheir use never exhausted.\"\n\nThe virtuous winds of Tang and Yu retreat in humility,\ntheir noble deeds recorded in the *Trustworthy Histories*—\nto be sought again.\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"When a ruler’s governance is perfectly accomplished,\nyet they further practice humility and retreat,\nit seems as if there is a flaw.\nBut if they renew their virtue daily,\ntheir use will never be worn out.\"\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: *The Dao of the World’s Harmony***\nLiang Ji, though lacking talent, relied on the imperial harem’s favor,\nyet he could not know contentment or praise the rules of virtue.\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* states:\n\"Misfortune is not greater than failing to know contentment.\"\nNow Liang Ji is the example—\nthough lacking talent, he relied on his favor,\nwhich is indeed failing to know contentment.\n\nAt the height of the Han’s decline,\nwhen the imperial house was most perilous,\nhe alone flourished in his crimson gates,\nstriding arrogantly.\nIn the later Han, under Emperor Huan of the Eastern Han,\nthe dynasty’s fate was precarious,\nand people had grown cold and shallow.\nLiang Ji, seated in the highest position of favor,\ncould neither correct the ruler with loyalty\nnor restrain himself with frugality.\nInstead, he made his household even more proud and arrogant,\nbecoming a tyrant who brought ruin upon himself.\nHis fortune exceeded—disaster arose—\nhe met the fate of self-annihilation.\nAlas.\n\nSun Shou was utterly bewildered by embroidered finery,\nSun Shou—\nLiang Ji’s wife.\nShe lost herself in the pursuit of beauty,\ndrowning in allure.\nZhang Gang merely shamed himself by asking about foxes and rabbits.\n\nWhen the Han dispatched eight envoys to survey the customs of the realm,\nZhang Gang buried his wheels and refused to go,\nsaying: *\"The jackals and wolves hold sway—\nhow can I ask about foxes and rabbits?\"*\nThus he memorialized Liang Ji’s crimes.\nDisaster overflowed—his kin were exterminated in three generations,\nhis deeds sullied the *Qingbian* annals for ages of lament.\nEmperor Huan, deceived by Liang Ji’s extravagant pretenses,\nordered Dan Chao and others to encircle his estate and slay him.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Seven: *Not Laboring to Peep Through the Window* (不出户)**\nThe Way reveals itself without need to spy through walls—\n*Daojing* says: *\"Without peeping through windows,\none perceives the Way’s unfolding.\"*\n\nWithin, the self is mirrored; beyond, the heart discerns.\n*Daojing*’s commentary explains:\n*\"The Sage, though never leaving his home,\nknows the world’s state—\nby his own person he understands others,\nby his own household he grasps theirs.\"*\n\nThe wars of Qin and Han boasted cunning stratagems,\nwhile Tang and Yu ruled with serene and bright virtue.\n*Daojing*’s commentary states:\n*\"When rulers cultivate stillness,\nthe *tianqi* aligns itself.\nExcessive desires breed turmoil and corruption.\"*\n\n**Chapter Forty-Eight: *Daily Learning* (为学日益)**\nShouldering the steep path to seek a master’s refined art,\nhis eloquence sharpens like a blade in the *Qingping* ford.\nLofty in character, he marks the land’s natural splendor,\nhis talent transcending ink and brush’s fleeting grace.\nDo not scorn the scholar who prizes white snow’s love,\nfor he knows well the labor of gathering flying moths’ light.\n\nIf one could daily diminish the heart’s unfeeling cravings,\nthen might he grasp the toil of *youwei* shaping form.\n*Daojing* says: *\"For learning, one gains daily.\nFor the Way, one loses daily.\"*\nIts further commentary declares:\n*\"The scholar’s path is daily growth in knowledge,\nthe Daoist’s is daily reduction of deeds.\nGaining knowledge is the slow ascent of study,\nlosing deeds is the gateway to enlightenment.\nThus, through accumulated effort, one forgets effort itself,\nand attains the Way—\ncan this not be rest?\"*\n\n**Chapter Forty-Nine: *The Sage Has No Fixed Heart* (圣人无常心)**\nThe Sage acts with trembling yet holds no fixed resolve—\n*Daojing* says: *\"The Sage has no fixed heart,\nfor he takes the hearts of the people as his own.\"*\nResponding to things, he extends virtue with boundless warmth.\n*Daojing*’s commentary explains:\n*\"The Sage’s heart is stirred by all things,\nand thus he responds.\nResponse arises from sensitivity,\nso he has no fixed heart.\"*\n\nTending to infants with tender care, his virtue is shared like an emperor’s,\n*Daojing*’s commentary states:\n*\"The Sage pities the common folk as a mother pities her child,\nso all are seen as infants in his care.\"*\n\nGuiding the virtuous and teaching the faithless to show his sovereign presence,\n*Daojing*’s commentary says:\n*\"To those who revere virtue and trust in faith,\nI follow their path.\nTo those who do not revere virtue and trust in faith,\nI teach them virtue and faith,\nso the people may feel my power and become virtuous and trusting.\"*\n\nHe rejoices in medicine’s return to the Way’s roots,\nyet fears the *shenggan*’s allure—\n*Daojing*’s commentary declares:\n*\"The Sage is vast, encompassing all,\nlike the Way mirroring Heaven—\nhis actions embody virtue and faith,\nand all are drawn by his power,\nunaware of his effortless transformation.\nIf rulers accept counsel and abandon delusion,\nthey naturally become virtuous and trusted.\nAll nations then joyfully follow,\nreturning to the Way’s bright reflection,\nstill as the moon, clear as the *chenqin*’s virtue.\"*\n\n**Chapter Fifty: *Life and Death* (出生入死)**\nAwakening and delusion share a single path—\n*Daojing*’s commentary says: *\"Enlightenment brings life,\nobstinacy leads to death.\"*\nYet if one speaks of purity and impurity’s distinction,\naccumulated merit and virtue can ascend to the Azure Han.\n\n「感德港化，暗合无为之功。\n*Rulers embody virtue and trust, harmonizing effortlessly,*\n*Daojing’s* commentary says: *\"All people turn their ears and eyes—*\n*Yet again it says: The Way’s virtue covers all,*\n*transforming the Sage’s power into goodness,*\n*so they lean to observe the Sage.\"*\n\n**Chapter Fifty: *Life and Death* (出生入死)**\nAwakening and delusion share a single root—\n*Daojing’s* commentary says: *\"Enlightenment brings life,\nobstinacy leads to death.\"*\n\n**Chapter Fifty: *The Dao’s Generation* (道生之)**\nAll beings arise from the Dao’s beginning—\n*Daojing’s* commentary says: *\"The Dao’s birth is singular—*\n*One gives rise to yin and yang,*\n*Yin and yang generate all beings,*\n*Thus knowing that myriad forms*\n*cannot arise without the Dao.\"*\n\nThe Sage expands virtue, his law pure and round—\n*Daojing’s* commentary says: *\"Heaven’s relation to all things,\n*Generates yet does not possess,*\n*Acts yet does not rely,*\n*Nurtures yet does not dominate—*\n*Letting them unfold naturally,*\n*This is called Heaven’s virtue.\"*\n\n*Similarly, the ruler governs the world.*\nWithout action, the realm is naturally tranquil—\n*Daojing* says: *\"The Way of virtue is without effort,\n*Why should it favor the exalted?*\n*All things naturally attain*\n*their noble station,*\n*Thus manifesting their natural rank and fate.\"*\n\n*Not dominating, yet fostering growth,*\n*Like the sun and moon’s radiant function.*\n*Daojing* says: *\"Nurturing yet not dominating.\"*\n*Rain and dew shower deep benevolence,*\n*Reviving grasses and woods,*\n*Silken threads and gentle words*\n*Bring fortune to the lowly.*\n\n*Daojing’s* commentary says: *\"The Dao’s relation to all things*\n*Is not merely to give life and sustenance—*\n*It further nurtures and matures them,*\n*Shelters and protects them,*\n*Preserving their essence and vitality.*\n*The ruler, if he follows this,*\n*In governing the nation and himself,*\n*Should align with the Dao’s*\n*Exalted virtue and noble station,*\n*Returning to his natural rank and fate.\"*\n\n*Green virtue covers all,*\n*The Sage’s wind extends far,*\n*All under heaven turn in harmony,*\n*Peace naturally prevails.*\n\n*Daojing’s* commentary says: *\"The Dao’s virtue is not*\n*Conferred by rank and fate—*\n*Its generative and nurturing function*\n*Covers all things,*\n*Ever naturally noble in itself.\"*\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Two: *The Origin of All Under Heaven* (天下有始)**\n*Secrets of practice curb the six senses,*\n*Daojing’s* commentary says: *\"If the six senses are not indulged,*\n*Then no calamity befalls.*\n*Thus, throughout life, danger is avoided.\"*\n\n*If one fears the mouth’s*\n*Lust for bear’s paws’ delicacy,*\n*And trembles at the heart’s*\n*Delusion from the phoenix’s new coiffure,*\n*Daojing’s* commentary says: *\"The river within man*\n*Is the greatest affliction,*\n*From whence arise disputes,*\n*And cravings that assault the body.*\n*Again it says: The gates of sight, hearing, and smell,*\n*If not led by desires,*\n*Then throughout life,*\n*There will be no restless exertion.*\n*Bear’s paws—*\n*The finest of tastes,*\n*Should be avoided with caution.\"*\n\n*Refining qi ensures eternal purity,*\n*Daojing’s* commentary says: *\"Constantly preserving*\n*The harmonious and subtle qi,*\n*Not letting it disperse,*\n*Then in cultivating the body,*\n*One will long endure*\n*Without danger.\"*\n\n*Guarding softness brings lasting strength,*\n*Daojing* says: *\"Guarding softness, daily growing strong.\"*\n*When asked of the tree before the warm house,*\n*No answer is given.*\n*For it is cautious and secretive,*\n*Revealing nothing of the inner sanctum.*\n*Thus seeing the man of hidden virtue and goodness.*\n\n*Daojing’s* commentary says: *\"Cautious speech,*\n*Moderate eating,*\n*Refining qi and concealing light—*\n*This makes me stand apart.*\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Three: *The Ruler’s Modesty* (使我介然)**\n*Must one believe the Dao’s simplicity is most even,*\n*Yet never lose sight of its grand rule.*\n*Daojing* says: *\"The Dao is most even,*\n*Yet men prefer shortcuts.\"*\n*Commentary says: Even, meaning plain and natural,*\n*Shortcuts, the crooked paths.*\n*Saying that without the Way of non-action*\n*There is no evenness,*\n*Yet men themselves enter*\n*The crooked paths of action.*\n\n*Small paths are perilous and difficult,*\n*The great Way is secure and easy.*\n\n*Leisurely contemplation of lofty halls and carved walls,*\n*Is it not better than*\n*Lowly palaces and meager meals?*\n*Daojing’s* commentary says: *\"Exalting palaces and halls,*\n*Adorning galleries and chambers,*\n*Then artisans labor in abundance,*\n*How can fields remain uncultivated?*\n*Fields once overgrown,*\n*How can granaries remain full?\"*\n\n*If cultivated virtue is neglected,*\n*And martial strength is relied upon,*\n*The Way’s transformation is lost.*\n*Daojing’s* commentary says: *\"If cultivated virtue is not upheld,*\n*Yet martial strength is emphasized,*\n*Then the Way’s natural transformation is forsaken.*\n*If able to govern the nation with greatness,*\n*Like the sun’s high brilliance,*\n*Illuminating the ocean’s edge,*\n*Daojing’s* commentary says: *\"The Sage’s Way,*\n*Its radiance like the sun,*\n*Without it, there is no way to illuminate*\n*The six directions.*\n*The Sage does not dwell in greatness,*\n*Then there is no way to benefit*\n*The world under heaven.\"*\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Four: *The Sage’s Foundation* (善建者不拔)**\n*The foundation of the Sage is unshaken,*\n*Observing Heaven’s enduring presence.*\n*Daojing’s* commentary says: *\"The Sage establishes himself and his nation*\n*With virtue and the Dao—*\n*This cannot be plucked away.\"*\n\n*Not grinding, nor roasting,*\n*Nor tasting the sacrificial meats,*\n*Extending the lineage of the altars.*\n*Daojing* says: *\"Descendants’ sacrifices shall not cease.\"*\n*For the altars’ lineage is vast and unbroken.*\n*The ruler’s trust and ministers’ loyalty*\n*Flourish through great virtue,*\n*Daojing’s* commentary says: *\"If the Dao is cultivated within the nation,*\n*Then the ruler is trusted,*\n*Ministers are loyal,*\n*And the seven bonds naturally arise.\"*\n\n*Honoring the elderly,*\n*Cherishing the young,*\n*And instructing the ignorant*\n*Display the Sage’s enduring virtue,*\n*Daojing’s* commentary says: *\"If the Dao is cultivated in the village,*\n*Honoring elders,*\n*Loving and nurturing the young,*\n*Teaching the foolish,*\n*His virtue is longest-lasting,*\n*Unmatched in excellence.\"*\n\n*Water returns to the Azure Sea,*\n*Its robes hanging daily—*\n*The zither calls forth the fragrant wind,*\n*Nurturing all things year after year.*\n*Daojing’s* commentary says: *\"The nation that cultivates the Dao,*\n*Observing the nation that does not,*\n*Thus with the virtue of Tang and Yu,*\n*It can discern the crimes of Jie and Zhou,*\n*Certainly able to govern well,*\n*And bring prosperity to the age.\"*\n\n*Following the Dao’s non-action,*\n*Overseeing the great treasure,*\n*Endless blue sky holds the star of longevity.*\n*If one follows the Dao’s purity and tranquility,*\n*And governs the great treasure,*\n*Then the star of longevity’s auspice shall appear.*\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Five: *The Depth of Virtue* (含德之厚)**\n*Virtue fully contained,*\n*True as the innocent babe,*\n*Daojing’s* commentary says: *\"The perfect man*\n*Embraces the depth of virtue and the Dao,*\n*His conduct like that of an infant.\"*\n\n*First teaching the three poisons,*\n*Dissolving the pure and harmonious.*\n\n「注云：含德淳厚之人，万应不干於心神，\n*The commentary states: Those of profound and pure virtue,*\n*All responses of the

yielding qi*\n*Is beneficial to others,*\n\n则为深知道德真常之用。\n*Then they have deeply grasped the Dao’s*\n*Virtue and the True and Eternal Way.*\n\n又云：众人以争竞爵禄，\n*It further states:*\n*The common folk vie

craving is closed.*\n\n又注云：既不可得亲疏，\n*It further states:*\n*When neither partiality nor detachment can be obtained,*\n又不可得利害，\n*Nor can gain or harm be seized,*\n不可得贵，\n*Nor can one be exalted,*\n不可得贱，\n*Nor debased,*\n是为天下贵，\n*This is to be the most noble in the world,*\n道德自更尊高也。\n*For his Dao and virtue are naturally most exalted.*\n\n以政理国章第五十七\n**Chapter Fifty-Seven: *Governance

the Dragon Gate to safeguard the Nine Regions.*\n\nThe *Daodejing* commentary states:\n*The *Zhou Shu* says:*\n*Perfect governance exudes fragrant virtue,*\n*Resonating with the divine clarity.*\n*Millet and barley are not fragrant,*\n*Yet the virtue of the Sage alone is fragrant.*\n\n*What is called the Sage’s perfect governance,*\n*Is nothing more urgent than rescuing living beings.*\n*The fragrant virtue of the Sage’s clarity*\n*Moves heaven and earth,*\n*Not only ensuring wealth and longevity without bounds,*\n*But also securing enduring blessings and boundless

hundred rivers to the sea,*\n*Reviving the people of the Nine Regions,*\n*Truly embodies the essence of rescue.*\n\n*The moon aids the lute in tuning the endless night,*\n*The rain envelops the round pool in the serene autumn.*\n\nThe *Daodejing* commentary states:\n*The intent of this chapter*\n*Should be centered on perfect governance and tranquil rectitude.*\n*Now, the lute signifies adherence to rectitude,*\n*The autumn signifies clarity and stillness,*\n*Using events to illustrate principles.*\n\n*After the harmonious transformation where none are harmed,*\n*There arises the noble qi of the *qingyun* clouds.*\n*The *Daodejing* states:*\n*The gods of the Dao do not harm the people,*\n*Nor does the Sage harm the people.*\n\n**Chapter Sixty-One of the *Treatise on Governing Great States*:**\n*When the great sea is humble, all rivers flow to it.*\n*The *Daodejing* commentary states:*\n*The great sea is lowly,*\n*And the hundred rivers naturally flow to it.*\n*A great state’s humility and deference,*\n*And the myriad lands naturally submit to it.*\n\n*Gentleness and stillness hold the heart,*\n*Embodying the principle of transcending the world.*\n*The *Daodejing* commentary states:*\n*If a ruler of a great state maintains gentleness and stillness,*\n*The world will unite in harmony and return to it.*\n\n*A great state’s humility and deference flourish the Sage’s Dao,*\n*All feudal lords gaze reverently toward the imperial court.*\n*The *Daodejing* states:*\n*A great state that upholds the virtue of humility*\n*And looks down upon lesser states*\n*Is merely seeking to annex and subjugate them.*\n\n*Lesser states seizing upon greater states*\n*Is to rely on power and advantage.*\n\n*Jin Wen’s repayment to Chu ultimately made him a hegemon,*\n*Idong Hu’s refusal of Qi cost him his opportunity.*\n*Before Jin Wen entered his state,*\n*He once traveled through Chu.*\n*Chu honored him,*\n*And the Chu king asked Wen,*\n*What would you repay me for in

the heart of the humble never forgets*\n*The Sage’s vigilant night robes.*\n\nThe *Daodejing* commentary states:\n*A great state must always guard against fullness and excess.*\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Two of the *Treatise on Governing Great States*:**\n*The Dao/Way is the profound mystery of all things,*\n*Its depths must be explored.*\n*One must recognize*\n*The virtue of humility and purity,*\n*And rise above the dust of the world.*\n\n*The *Daodejing* states:*\n*The Dao/Way is the profound mystery of all things.*\n\n*Those with expansive Dao-heart*\n*And the few who reach enlightenment,*\n*Assist the effortless sovereign*\n*As virtuous ministers.*\n\nThe commentary states:\n*Unless one is of the utmost Dao and great goodness,*\n*How could they value profound mysteries and treasures,*\n*And have the resolve to save others?*\n\n*Again, the text states:*\n*Therefore, the Son of Heaven establishes the Three Dukes,*\n*To teach those who are not yet good.*\n\n*It is essential to rescue all beings with sweet words,*\n*And gently guide those whose roots are lost,*\n*Who are not yet good.*\n\nThe commentary states:\n*The Sage uses sweet and appealing words of law,*\n*And honors high and pure conduct,*\n*To transform those who are not yet good.*\n\n*Guilt and suffering are forever erased,*\n*When one awakens to the truth,*\n*And the phoenix and crane of the

Dao is free from greed,*\n*And from thoughts of the mundane.*\n\nThe commentary states:\n*The taste of the Dao is not the vulgar taste of the world,*\n*And even the Dao’s taste should not be greedily sought,*\n*How much more so the vulgar tastes of the world?*\n\n*Yet, one must steadfastly maintain a humble heart,*\n*And diligently uphold one’s word.*\n*The *Daodejing* states:*\n*Light promises and few trustworthy words.*\n*One has never hated in leisure,*\n*Nor remembered faults in repose.*\n\n*The *Daodejing* states:*\n*Great and small, all have defects,*\n*Yet repay hatred with virtue.*\n\n*It is essential to pacify the myriad multitudes,*\n*And harmonize the winds of the world,*\n*Forever to restrain the Three Miao*\n*From their dancing with feathers.*\n\nThe commentary states:\n*The Sage’s creations are effortless,*\n*Yet bring about transformations without effort.*\n*Though Yu of the Xia harmonized the winds*\n*And danced with dry feathers,*\n*He achieved effortless transformations through his actions.*\n\n*Why should King Mu of Zhou*\n*Meet at the Yao Pool,*\n*When Yu of the Xia maintained purity in his simplicity,*\n*And thus reached the Dao?*\n*King Mu of Zhou met at the Yao Pool,*\n*His chariot wheels and horses’ tracks*\n*Covering the four seas,*\n*Yet he only sought vain and excessive desires,*\n*And failed to embody purity and stillness.*\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Four of the *Treatise on Governing Great States*:**\n*Peace and stillness are easy to maintain,*\n*Yet perfect for cultivating the self.*\n\nThe commentary states:\n*To cultivate the self and govern the state,*\n*Peace and stillness are the easiest to uphold.*\n\n*At the outset,*\n*One must divide and conquer*\n*The desires that may topple anger.*\n\nThe commentary states:\n*Desires bring calamity,*\n*And when they have not yet taken form,*\n*They are easiest to stop.*\n\n*When a tree reaches its full height,*\n*It begins as a tiny sprout,*\n*And when a tower is built,*\n*It starts with a single shovelful of earth.*\n\n*The *Daodejing* states:*\n*A tree with arms wide enough to embrace*\n*Grows from a tiny sprout.*\n*It also states:*\n*A nine-tiered tower*\n*Rises from piled earth.*\n\n*Zhao’s master could not lightly value state treasures,*\n*Dong Zhongshu must emphasize the importance of words.*\n\n*The *Daodejing* states:*\n*Do not prize what is hard to obtain.*\n*Its commentary states:*\n*The common folk study vulgar learning,*\n*What is called pursuing heterodox ends.*\n\n*The Sage follows the Dao’s original effortlessness,*\n*Thus learning from what is not learned.*\n*Is this not a remedy for the faults*\n*Of the common folk’s heterodox pursuits?*\n\n*Zhao Wang ordered Lan Si to deliver a jade to Qin,*\n*Seeking its price in connected cities,*\n*This was to prize what is hard to obtain,*\n*And to neglect the Dao’s intent.»*\n\n「How could one prevent Dong Zhongshu from withdrawing behind his curtains to study,\nSeeking worldly gain—\nIts certainty is already known.\n\nCautious to the end as at the beginning, there will be no failure;\nCherish the spirit, beware of excessive action.\n\n*The Daodejing* states:\n*\"Cautious to the end as at the beginning, there will be no failure.\"*\nIts commentary states:\n*\"To act upon desires exhausts the spirit.\"*\n\nIn ancient times, those skilled in the *Daodejing*’s sixth chapter:\nLured the people to remain in ignorance, extinguishing emotions like withered trees.\n*The Daodejing*’s commentary states:\n*\"The ancients skilled in the Dao did not enlighten the people—\nThey sought to keep them in ignorance.\"*\n\nWithout the delusions of wisdom, anger, and ignorance,\nOnly the true wind stirs, calming the four quarters.\n\n*The Daodejing*’s commentary states:\n*\"Noble sages and virtuous rulers govern by the Dao’s original simplicity,\nEver preserving naturalness and simplicity.\"*\n\nThe ignorant of antiquity did not allow clever schemers\nTo taint the wise with their artifices,\nLest they confuse true nature.\n\nAgain, the *Daodejing* states:\n*\"The difficulty in governing the people lies in their excess of wisdom.\"*\n\nWith reverence for the Dao’s greatness, he accomplished nothing yet illuminated vast plans.\nThe Yellow Emperor governed thus—\nHis merit ascended, riding clouds from the Cauldron Lake.\n\n*The Daodejing* states:\n*\"To govern without wisdom is the state’s blessing.\"*\nThe Yellow Emperor followed the Dao without action,\nNurturing the four quarters,\nLater ascending to the Cauldron Lake upon white clouds,\nReaching the imperial realm.\n\n**Chapter 66: The River and Sea as King of All Valleys**\nThe river and sea, honored as king of all valleys,\nFlow downward, never against the current—vast and boundless.\nA voyage unfurls, swaying with the wind’s might,\nAs dawn’s sun rises, bathing in morning light.\nCrashing against celestial stars, waves surge wide,\nThe path opens to the boundless blue, waves surging high.\n\nIf a ruler follows the virtue of humility,\nAll nations joyfully uphold his enduring prosperity.\n\n*The Daodejing* states:\n*\"The river and sea become king of all valleys\nBecause they excel in yielding.\nThus, the Sage desires to elevate others—\nHe speaks in humility.\nHe desires to lead others—\nHe places himself last.\nThus, though exalted, none resent him;\nThough first, none harm him.\nThus, the world willingly follows without burden.\nBecause he does not contend, none can contend with him.\"*\n\n**Chapter 67: The World’s Judgment**\nNeither wise nor foolish—seeming unworthy,\n*The Daodejing* states:\n*\"The world all say my Dao is great—\nIt seems unworthy.\"*\nIts commentary states:\n*\"Not resembling wisdom, not resembling foolishness,\nDifferent from others—\nThus, it is called unworthy.\"*\n\nEver holding the Three Treasures, the true wind stirs.\n*The Daodejing* states:\n*\"I possess three treasures—\nGuard and uphold them.\nFirst, compassion;\nSecond, frugality;\nThird, not daring to act before the world.\"*\n\nFrugality achieves abundance without excess,\nCompassion rescues all living beings with great merit.\n*(As noted above.)*\n\nRen’s virtue harmonizes the central lands,\nThe Dao’s essence aligns with the Supreme Mystery.\n\n*The Daodejing*’s commentary states:\n*\"The compassionate and virtuous—\nThe people naturally attach themselves.\"*\nAgain, it states:\n*\"If a ruler practices these three treasures,\nThen heaven, earth, and spirits will surely assist and protect.\"*\n\nStrong Qin abandoned these principles in vain,\nBuilding its foundation—\nYet in one day, all was empty.\n\n*The Daodejing* states:\n*\"Now, gathering compassion and courage,\nGathering frugality and breadth,\nGathering humility and precedence—\nDeath awaits.\"*\nQin Shi Huang gathered the Three Treasures,\nRelying on cleverness and force—\nHis dynasty did not endure.\n\nAlas.\n\n**Chapter 68: The Virtuous Scholar**\n\n「Expounding the Dao never relies on martial might,\n*The Daodejing*’s commentary states:\n*\"Hold virtue and the Way in high esteem,\nDo not valorize force.\nUse the subtle and yielding to transform things,\nNot the rigid and fierce to subdue people.\"*\nIt is not through wrath that campaigns are launched.\n\n*The Daodejing* states:\n*\"The skilled warrior does not rage.\"*\n\nYu the Great’s dance of feathers and dryads brought harmony,\nThe Three Miao submitted in peace.\nKing Wu of Zhou honored the Duke of Zhou beneath the *yǒu’ōu* banner,\nThe army marched only after the sage’s counsel.\nXiang Yu, in his haste, fled that night,\nXiang Yu’s forces were crushed at Gaixia,\nHearing the encircling Chu songs,\nHe knew the Chu troops were all now in Han’s grasp.\nThus, he parted from his concubine in the tent,\nAnd fled into the night.\nWhen he still relied on strength and indulged his ambitions,\nWho could foresee the night of defeat?\nAlas.\n\nFú Jiān, at least, considered retreat when facing defeat.\nFú Jiān led a million-strong army against the Eastern Jin,\nRejecting Wang Mèng’s advice,\nIgnoring the calamity of the Lìshuǐ River.\nAt the time of his retreat after the Lìshuǐ defeat,\nHearing the wind’s cry like a crane’s call,\nHe mistook it for the Jin army’s approach.\nWas he not too careless?\nOne must know that military ventures are not lightly undertaken;\nThe four virtues still could pacify the Nine Borders.\n*The Daodejing* states:\n*\"The virtuous scholar does not wield arms,\nThe skilled warrior does not rage,\nThe master of victory does not contend,\nThe sage in using men places himself beneath them.\"*\n\n**Chapter 69: The Virtue of Caution in War**\nWhen acting as a guest, maintain humility,\nEver guard the path of retreat.\n*The Daodejing* states:\n*\"I dare not take the lead but only follow,\nI dare not advance an inch without retreating a foot.\"*\n\nThe *rǎngbì* is powerless—be cautious with military orders.\n*The Daodejing*’s commentary states:\n*\"The act of rolling up one’s sleeves signifies anger;\nThe skilled warrior does not rage, hence no rolling up of sleeves.\"*\n\nRen’s compassion and foresight are the perfect strategy,\nContempt breeds ruin and forsakes grand designs.\n*The Daodejing*’s commentary states:\n*\"Let compassion be the master.\"*\nAgain, it states:\n*\"No disaster greater than scorning the enemy.\"*\n\nEmpty threats echo like hollow bells over Yue,\nYet he failed to grasp the deer and hare’s flight to Gusu.\nKing Gou of Wu, overconfident in his strength,\nHeld Yue in contempt,\nUnmindful that power fades and nations fall—\nAt Gusu, the deer and hare wandered empty.\nDo not let the loss of treasure violate profound truth,\n*The Daodejing* states:\n*\"Scorning the enemy risks losing all five treasures.\"*\n\nAdapt to circumstances, act with subtlety, and bring peace to the four quarters.\n*The Daodejing*’s commentary states:\n*\"When the enemy bends, do not strike;\nWhen they are straight, respond with force—\nThough you hold your troops ready,\nYour intent is never to harm.\nMy words are simple yet profound.\"*\n\n**Chapter 70: The Supreme Sage’s Clear Doctrine**\n\n*The Daodejing* says: *\"My words are simple yet profound,\nEasy to know yet difficult to practice.\nThose who cannot know and cannot practice—*\n*The Daodejing* states: *\"Few in the world can know or practice them.\"*\n\nThe blind gaze at the splendor of a fallen kingdom’s silks,\nThe deafened are lost to the alluring melodies of Zheng and Wei.\nUnquenched passions darken the form, like chains of favor that cloud the mind—\n*The Daodejing’s* commentary explains: *\"Confused by lust, they cannot know;\nEnsnared by glory and gain, they cannot practice.\"*\n\nThe humble in coarse robes, yet treasuring virtue within, sink deep in stillness—\nYet even they, when weighed by worldly currents, fail to see the eternal truth.\n*The Daodejing’s* commentary states: *\"The coarse-clad obscure the outer,\nThe virtuous-clad discern the inner—\nThus, few truly understand me.\"*\n\n**Chapter 70 (continued):**\n*Knowing yet feigning ignorance—this is the highest virtue.*\n*The Daodejing’s* commentary says: *\"The Sage knows the Dao within,\nYet outwardly appears as though he does not—\nThis is the virtue’s peak.\"*\n\n*Feigning knowledge while ignorant—this is the sickness of empty words.*\n*The Daodejing’s* commentary states: *\"To claim knowledge without understanding\nIs the root of vain speech’s affliction.\"*\n\nThough common folk may fail to grasp the eternal realm,\nThe Saints ever open the gate of benefit and salvation.\nGuard tranquility to preserve boundless *qi*,\nPity the greedy, pointing them toward their deluded roots.\nIn accord with nature, rescue all beings—\nThe Sage’s mercy spans the heavens, vast as his embrace.\n*The Daodejing’s* commentary says: *\"The Sage knows no sickness of forced understanding,\nFor he pities all beings, who share this flaw—\nThus, he himself cannot be afflicted.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 72: The Sage’s Non-Fear**\nMen fear not threats when threats become their rule.\n*The Daodejing* states: *\"If men do not fear great threats,\nThen greater threats shall come.\"*\n\nLet the mind be empty and pure—then the spirit dwells.\n*The Daodejing’s* commentary says: *\"The spirit’s home is the mind.\nCast aside emotions, purge desires,\nLet emptiness bloom with clarity—\nRight and wrong reveal themselves;\nThe body bears no blame.\"*\n\nThe Sage knows his own merit and demerit within,\nYet sees no outward praise or censure.\nHis vital *qi* ever full, the Dao overflows.\nSleeping, he dreams of Zhuangzi’s carefree butterflies;\nAwakened, he rejoices in Hui Shi’s fish of joy.\n*The Daodejing’s* commentary says: *\"He guards himself from dreadful deeds,\nLoves his spirit’s purity—\nThus, no fault of driving the spirit away.\"*\n\nSo it is—\nThe butterflies of Zhuang and the fish of Hui\nSpring forth as pleasures beyond the dust.\n\nThose who shun arrogance and pride, hiding their virtue,\nClose their doors when snow blocks the three paths.\n*The Daodejing’s* commentary says: *\"He does not boast of noble status or worldly fame.\nYuan An, when snow fell, sealed his gate—\nAvoiding all entanglement.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 73: The Sage’s Boldness**\nBoldness in daring to slay those who defy Heaven’s Way—\n*The Daodejing’s* commentary asks: *\"How can this compare to self-destruction?\"*\nFor those without *ren* (benevolence),\nWho scorn the retribution of Heaven’s law,\nBegin with reckless daring—\nTo kill is to court their own demise.\nWhen death is certain, who then dares?\nThus, the bold who kill are like those who kill themselves.\n\nEver restrain the fierce—this preserves the life.\n*The Daodejing* says: *\"The daring who do not dare shall live.\"*\n\nFear of harm, if the mind can cast aside confusion—\n*The Daodejing’s* commentary states: *\"Daring and restraint:\nThe one who spares himself lives;\nThe one who harms himself dies.*\nNo idle words, yet goodness responds.\nThe world may pity the modest and humble,\nBut Heaven’s net favors the strong and resolute.\n*The Daodejing’s* commentary says: *\"Though Heaven’s net is vast and distant,\nIts punishments for vice and rewards for virtue\nFail not even by a hair’s breadth.*\n\nLook to the banks of Wujiang—\nThe might to uproot mountains faded to dust.\nXiang Yu held the power to move mountains,\nYet all perished at Wujiang’s edge.\nMen do not fear death—\nHow can they be coerced by threats?\n*The Daodejing’s* commentary says: *\"Given to passions, drawn into peril,\nDeath becomes their habit—\nYet still, they fear not.\"*\n\nA ruler should transform with clarity and stillness.\nWhy impose new laws of punishment?\nWhy frighten them with constant fear of death?\nEmperor Wen of Han abhorred harsh laws, following the Five Hearings.\nIn the time of Emperor Wen of Han,\nHe ruled by the Yellow Emperor-Laozi’s teachings,\nNearly abolishing punishments—\nThis was truly to follow the Five Hearings.\nHigh Emperor Gaozu’s lenient laws were but three chapters.\nWhen Emperor Gaozu first entered the Pass,\nHe made three simple laws with the elders:\n‘Whoever kills shall die;\nWhoever wounds or steals shall be punished—\nAll other Qin laws are hereby removed.’\nThe people lived in peace, secure in their homes.\nTo follow Heaven, govern with nature—\nThen men shall transform of their own accord.\n\n「The *Daodejing* commentary states: If a ruler guides the people with few desires and governs with stillness and non-action, then the people will cherish life and all fear death.\nThe clumsy carpenter wounds his own hands while shaping materials.\n\nThe *Daodejing* commentary states: A ruler acts as Heaven’s agent in governing the world. If punishment is not justly applied, it is like a clumsy artisan attempting to forge a new vessel—how could he avoid marring his hands, not to mention failing to achieve the proper shape? Can one not be cautious?\n\nWhen the tripod was cast with success, virtue was divided—\nClimbing the Dragon’s beard to leave the White Cloud Realm.\nIn the age of the Yellow Emperor’s governance,\nHe broadened his saving compassion to its fullest,\nNot only did the four quarters live in peace and follow transformation,\nBut also the tripod was cast in perfection,\nHeaven bestowed the Dragon’s beard,\nRiding upon the White Clouds,\nAscending to the imperial domain.\n\n**Chapter 75: The People’s Hunger**\nA ruler’s extravagance brings the people’s hunger.\nThe *Daodejing* commentary states: The people of the world suffer from hunger and want because their lords and rulers consume too much and tax them excessively.\n\nThe hard-to-govern return to green policies with active rule.\nThe *Daodejing* states: The people are hard to govern because their rulers act excessively. Therefore, they are hard to govern.\n\nThose in high station seek abundance, while the destitute grow weary and lean.\nThe *Daodejing* commentary states: Those in power cannot restrain their own actions; thus, they drain the lower ranks to benefit themselves, exhausting the common folk so they cannot provide tribute. Since life is not cherished, death becomes a trivial matter.\n\nPushed by rank and wealth, the heartless follow.\nThe *Daodejing* commentary states: Those who care nothing for life—rank and wealth mean nothing to them, nor do riches enter their hearts. They let things take their course, embracing emptiness with open mind.\n\nThe courtyard filled with broom and grass sustains their nature.\nThe *Daodejing* commentary states: Though poor and lowly, they do not harm their lives for profit.\nZhang Zhongyu’s dwelling was overgrown with broom and grass.\n\nUntil the robe of office is hung, virtue spreads naturally—\nThe foundation of eternal peace is unshaken.\nIf a ruler governs by hanging his robe and elucidating transformation,\nrequiring nothing from the people, they will be self-sufficient—\nthis is indeed the firm basis of lasting peace.\n\n**Chapter 76: The People’s Life**\nGrasses and trees flourish, spreading thick shade—\nThe *Daodejing* states: All things, grasses and trees, are soft and tender when they first grow, preserving harmonious *qi*.\nYet when they wither and decay, frost and snow invade.\nThe *Daodejing* states: When they die, they become brittle and dry, their harmonious *qi* dispersed.\n\nStraight as a ten-armed embrace, they hide in secluded depths—\nYet slender branches rise above the dense forest.\nThe *Daodejing* commentary states: The roots are strong and sturdy, so they rest below;\nThe branches are weak and pliable, so they grow above.\nIt is as though the weak and tender flourish above,\nWhile the strong and rigid lie beneath.\nThe weak and tender preserve life—this is worth heeding,\nThe strong and rigid lose their nature—this should alarm the heart.\n\nThe *Daodejing* commentary states: The living, in their weakness and tenderness, retain harmonious *qi* fully;\nThe dying, in their rigidity, lose their harmonious *qi*.\nThose who guard their weakness and tenderness will preserve life and extend years,\nWhile those who cling to strength and rigidity will perish and lose their nature.\n\nFu Jian’s arrogance destroyed his army—\nThe water’s flow was choked by deep resentment.\nFu Jian relied on his wealth and power,\nIndulging his rigid and domineering nature,\nAnd was defeated at the Fei River,\nWhere the water refused to flow for him,\nUltimately losing his own life.\n\n**Chapter 77: The Dao/Way of Heaven**»\nOne must know that Heaven’s Dao/Way is like the string of a bow—\n\nThe *Daodejing* says: The Dao/Way of Heaven—is it not like a drawn bow?\nIt raises the low and suppresses the high, dividing with utmost fairness.\nThe *Daodejing* says: The high are suppressed, the low are raised.\n\nSelf-restraint in abundance—like dew moistening the house,\nYet constant lamentation reveals the path’s end.\nThe *Daodejing* says: Reduce the surplus and supplement the deficient.\n\nThough vast the imperial work, virtue remains concealed.\nThe *Daodejing* commentary says: The Sage does not desire the world to know his virtue,\nHiding his deeds and merits, fearing Heaven’s Dao,\nTo reduce the surplus.\n\nBroadening blessings for the people, not relying on merit.\nThe *Daodejing* says: The work accomplished, yet not dwelling upon it.\n\nAt Zhulú, martial might was laid aside—true *qi* endured,\nThen returning in procession to seek the Kunlun peaks.\nThe Yellow Emperor ceased war, swimming in the Lu River,\nAnd sought the Dao at Kunlun, meeting Guangchengzi.\n\n**Chapter 78: The Dao/Way of Heaven’s Genuine Softness**\nSquare and round like water—its softness defined,\nThe *Daodejing* says: None are softer than water.\nYet it overcomes the rigid—logic clear.\nThe *Daodejing* says: The soft overcomes the hard.\n\nAccepting defilement, extending grace—like the Sea’s embrace,\nTaking responsibility, transforming all under Heaven.\nThe *Daodejing* commentary says: If a ruler embodies water’s virtue,\nAccepting filth and defilement without hesitation,\nSetting up the *Wood of Slander* and *Drum of Dare*,\nThis is the enlightened sovereign, the Dao-bearing sage.\n\nThough knowing profound truths, who will truly follow?\nEach hides their nature—who would act?\nThe *Daodejing* commentary says: Though all know the soft overcomes the hard,\nNone can practice it.\n\nDuan Ganmu’s virtue—wind’s breath hard to inherit,\nRetiring to high repose, halting Qin’s armies.\nDuan Ganmu dwelled in Wei’s outer lands,\nAnd Qin dared not strike Wei.\n\n**Chapter 79: Harmonizing Great Grievances**\nHeaven’s Dao favors none—blessing the virtuous,\n\n「The *Daodejing* states: Heaven’s Dao favors none, yet always blesses the virtuous.\nIf one holds fast to the *Left Contract*, they shall remain untainted in truth.\nThe *Daodejing* says: Thus the sage clings to the *Left Contract* and does not blame others.\n\nThough lacking in impartial justice, they shower favors alone,\nUnworried by enmity or schemes to harm their person.\nThe *Daodejing* commentary says: Those in office cannot uphold the *Left Contract* in faith,\nThus errors arise unchecked, while they indulge in luxury within,\nEver scrutinizing others, yet harboring inner deceit,\nBringing misfortune upon themselves while seeking blessings from Heaven.\nThey fail to take responsibility for their own faults,\nYet mete out punishments to others.\n\nIt is like dwelling with a man’s son and slaying his father,\nOr residing with a man’s brother and killing his younger sibling—\nYet still they wish to bestow rich treasures and vast honors,\nTo seek broad pardon and forgiveness—\nCan such a one be absolved?\n\nI endure to witness Emperor Chen abandoning his sacred trust,\nWell knowing Jiang Zong was no loyal minister.\nThe *Hou Ting*’s foundations still stand, a stark testament,\nWhile the *Yu Shu* blooms anew—spring from wild grass.\n\nEmperor Chen of Chen could not uphold his trust in governing others,\nBut only gave free rein to his extravagance and debauchery,\nCultivating the *Hou Ting* and planting *Yu Shu* trees,\nTo become the envy of all under Heaven.\n\nJiang Zong, meanwhile, was the most favored by imperial grace,\nYet he could not rectify or save—\nInstead, he erected the *San Ge* to entertain guests.\nSwiftly drafting verses, he sought to emulate the *Eight Strings*,\nWhile the *Iron Ogre* and *Golden Bowl* relied on their strength in one river alone.\n\nLittle did they know that the *Sui* ruler’s virtue was spreading,\nWhile Chen’s heart was lost in delusion—\nSoon came their downfall, a sorrowful spectacle for ages past.\nWas it not Jiang Zong betraying his former favors?\nAlas.\n\n**Chapter 80: The Small State with Few People**」\n\nThe boat and carriage though never ridden,\n*The Dao De Jing* says: Though there be boats and carriages, there is no place to ride them.\nYan Zi’s gourd and bamboo bowl—virtue’s grandeur unfolds.\n*The Dao De Jing* commentary: The Way resides within; even Yan Zi’s coarse gourd and bamboo bowl suffice for sweetness.\n\nJoyous to see the people return to the Domain of Longevity,\n*The Dao De Jing* commentary: In an age where the world is cleansed and bright, the people are brought to the realm of benevolent life.\n\nLaughing as armies and armor guard Jianling.\n*The Dao De Jing* says: Though there be armor and weapons, there is no place to array them.\nThe Six Dynasties of Jiangnan all made Jianling their capital, yet they relied on arms to fortify the riverbank—far from the vast and august virtue.\n\nWithout intent, the strange customs are naturally at ease,\n*The Dao De Jing* commentary: The Way resides within; even if one dwells among the Nine Barbarians, it is enough for joy.\n\nReturning to simplicity, yet still resorting to knotted cords.\n*The Dao De Jing* commentary: When governance reverts to purity, all return to simplicity, using knotted cords—truly in harmony with the Original One.\n\nKnowing the calamity of Emperor Huai and Emperor Min of Yongjia,\nYet seeking no wise counsel—what did He Zong ever do?\nThe Jin Emperor Wu, at first, with his diligence and rectitude, pacified the world.\nAfter destroying Shu, only Wu remained.\nHad he heeded the strategies of Yun Yang, Zhang Hua, and Du Yu, Wu too would have fallen.\nWith the Six Directions pacified and all nations aligned, he could have spread the radiant and tranquil transformation, restoring the pure and simple ways.\nYet he was ensnared by the beauty of Sun Hao’s concubines, doted on Emperor Hui’s frailty, lost in the present, and forgot the distant horizon.\nHe Zong said to his son: *\"I bear the weight of the nation’s trust, always striving to serve. Yet I see the Emperor consult only fleeting words of the past, never long-term plans.\"*\nPointing to his grandson, he said: *\"You shall surely suffer this fate.\"*\nAnd when the Yongjia era came, Liu Cong and Liu Yao rebelled,\nBoth capturing Emperors Huai and Min.\nAlas.\n**Chapter 81: Trusting in One Truth Brings No Beauty**\n\nThe love of fine words brings no trust in the end,\nYet trustworthy words, though plain, benefit many.\n*The Dao De Jing* says:\n*\"Trustworthy words are not fine,\nFine words are not trustworthy.\"*\n\nA virtuous heart conceals its brilliance in true cultivation,\nWhile eloquent tongues boast false skill—mere flattery alone.\n*The Dao De Jing* says:\n*\"The virtuous do not argue,\nThose who argue are not virtuous.\"*\nFlattery is the speech of sycophants.\n\nSimple and unadorned, they forget artifice—\nYet schemers twist nature, their empty rhetoric thin as silk.\nThe Master without guile surpasses the silver-tongued deceiver.\n\nThe Sage acts for the people’s benefit, returning to virtue.\n*The Dao De Jing* says:\n*\"The Way of the Sage is to act without contention.\"*\n\nAdjust the jade candle to harmonize all things.\nThus concludes the *Dao De Jing*—mysterious praises, Volume Two.",

      "translated_text": "**The Mystic Praise of the Dao/Way and Its Virtue: Preface to the Mystic Praise of the Dao/Way and Its Virtue**\n\nBy **Song Luan**, newly appointed as the **Defense Judge of Yingzhou**, **Junior Official of the Great Justice Bureau**, and **Censorate Inspector**, humbly offering this work.\n\nI have heard that the pure and simple nature originates from the natural, and the source of wisdom springs from cultivation. Thus, it is known that knotting cords to mark numbers and refining civilization could be practiced in the age of **Great Antiquity**. Yet, the emotions of joy and sorrow arise from the **Five Phases** and transform with the **Harmonious Qi** of moderation. Once language and writing were established, the distinction between the virtuous and the foolish emerged. Even before **Emperor Yao** and **Emperor Shun**, wars and conflicts began, yet they still followed the **Dao/Way**. At the time of **King Tang** and **King Wu**, the **Dao/Way** was neglected as they pursued conquest. Afterward, the **fiefdoms were divided like scattered stones**, and the **pao tree** bestowed favors—those who aided their rulers sought glory, while schemers plotted for power. The decline of the **Zhou dynasty** began when the king hunted at **Henyang**, where the **Jin Wen** alliance was formed, and the **Heavenly King** attended the gathering. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* discreetly omitted this, simply recording \"the king hunted at **Henyang**.\"\n\nAs the **Zhou dynasty** weakened, debates arose over **gaining worthy men** and **losing worthy men**, and discussions of **flourishing states** and **declining states** proliferated. All sought clever arguments, their tongues twisting in vain. Some refused **yellow gold** yet demanded it, while others scorned **white jade** yet coveted it. **Su Qin** adorned his family by wearing the **seal of office**, **Zhang Lu** strengthened his state to erase his shame, **Li Si** ascended to high rank, and **Bu Wei** sighed in obscurity. In that era, the **eloquent persuasions** of a single moment could bring glory, while **tenfold honors** were grasped in an instant. Yet they failed to grasp that harming the **noble qi**, chasing fleeting fame—initially thriving in prosperity, they ultimately perished in ruin.\n\nThen came the **hunted stag** and the **soaring dragon**. The **Qin dynasty** collapsed, its chariots crossing the **Sea Bridge** amid **blue waves**. The **Han Emperor** rose, his **sword of destiny** leaning against the **Azure Sky**. As **civilization flourished** and **culture thrived**, the **Four Cardinal Directions** were bound by **writings and governance**, and all living beings felt the **transformative power** of the **Dao/Way**, finding ease in its flow. The **Eight Seas** became clear mirrors, and the **Nine Regions** settled in stillness—deceitful words could not prevail, while the **authentic and profound** winds were restored.\n\nThus arose **Yang Zi Yun**, **Dongfang Shuo**, **Li Yuan**, and **Yuan An**, all like **radiant stars** and **exalted talents**, their fragrance spreading like **orchids and osmanthus**. They indulged in **classics and lore**, yet delayed their ambitions. For they understood that **Su Qin’s wearing of the seal** to honor his family was inferior to **Yang Zi Yun’s taking up arms** to serve the **Han**; **Zhang Lu’s strengthening of his state** to erase his shame was not as noble as **Dongfang Shuo’s feigning humility** by offering his flesh; **Li Si’s ascent to prominence** was less worthy than **Li Yuan’s perpetual refusal** of lavish rewards; and **Bu Wei’s lament in obscurity** paled compared to **Yuan An’s quiet retreat** to his thatched cottage.\n\nThey did not harbor **vain and deceitful thoughts**, but only recognized the **allotted fates** of poverty and wealth. When used, they shone like **pearls returned to their streams**, radiant and resplendent; when abandoned, they lay hidden like **jade buried in mountains**, yet still retaining their **gentle warmth**. With **measured advancement and retreat**, they found **ease in the Dao/Way**, ever serene in their own being. They contemplated the **mystic origins** of the **Supreme Good** and followed the **principles of the Great Changes**, avoiding **excessive striving**, and drawing near to **tranquil harmony**.\n\nIn reflection of the **Four Virtuous Ones** whose fame endures through ages, I recall the **retreat to the Yan Platform** and the **plots by the Wei River**. Though I deem myself **base and unworthy**, I dare to speak and compose, only to **aspire to the lofty teachings** and **fan the true winds**. I seek to **promote the Four Virtues** to calm the **four cardinal regions**, using the **Three Treasures** to **comfort the people**. All should return to **simplicity and purity**, casting off **superficial adornments**.\n\nThus, I boldly interpret the *Dao/Way Dejing*, weaving **Ba-style songs**, following each chapter’s theme to **chant its essence**. Sometimes, I divide a single line for **separate verses**; other times, I compose an entire poem to **narrate its meaning**. Though not refined like the *Sao* or *Ya*, I still admire the **mystic subtleties**, sincerely offering my **devoted heart** to those who **discern the profound**.\n\n**Volume One: Mystic Praise of the Dao/Way Dejing**\n**Chapter One: \"The Dao/Way That Can Be Spoken Of\"**\nDo not confuse the **Dao/Way** with the **True Dao/Way**,\nNor tarnish the **Great Name** with common speech.\nThe *Dao/Way Dejing* says:\n*The Dao/Way that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao/Way*;\n*The name that can be named is not the eternal name.*\n\nOnly when **desires are abandoned** can the **pure and simple** be preserved,\nFor **action and striving** will always **regret cleverness**.\nThe *Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\n*If a person can always abandon desire, they may perceive the Dao/Way’s essence.*\n*Essence refers to a single, unclouded mind.*\n\nThe **mind’s source** is straight and clear, its **Dao/Way** pure and still,\nWhile **emotions** are crooked, needing **sweeping and leveling**.\nOnly through **diligent practice** can one truly **penetrate and understand**,\nYet **clarity and turbidity** are already born within.\n\nThe *Dao/Way Dejing* says:\n*Without the **Dao/Way of Non-Action**, the beginning of heaven and earth would not exist.*\n*Beginning refers to the **Dao/Way’s origin**.*\n\n**Chapter Two: \"The World Knows the Dao/Way\"**\nCultivate **virtue/power** to leave behind **glory and wealth**,\nYet **Emperor Yi** and **Emperor Kang** achieved **great deeds** through **non-action**.\nDo good without **boasting**, yet **reach the utmost goodness**,\nAchieve success without **taking credit**, for it is **distinctive merit**.\nThe *Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\n*Those who do not dare to rest in their **virtue/power** yet still cultivate it—*\n*They forget their deeds yet their merit remains,*\n*They do not cling yet are not abandoned.*\n\nIf one can **nurture the Three Treasures** in **stillness and tranquility**,\nThey will **attain the Dao/Way of wordless instruction**,\n**Establishing a name** while **preserving life** is worthy of admiration,\nYet even a **simple boat** cannot be detained by the **Five Lakes’ winds**.\nThe *Dao/Way Dejing* says:\n*Only those who achieve success*\n*Do not dwell in their rank.*\n\n**Fan Li** achieved success and **fulfilled his name**,\nThen **vanished into the Five Lakes**.\n\n**Chapter Three: \"Not Exalting the Worthy\"**\nTo **abolish superficiality** and **not exalt the worthy**,\nThe *Dao/Way Dejing* says:\n*Do not exalt the worthy.*\n\nInstead, **abandon gold and jade** to the **mountains and streams**.\nThe *Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\n*The ruler does not indulge in rare delicacies—*\n*Gold is cast into the mountains,*\n*Jade is discarded into the streams.*\n\n**Merit and fame** are not **boasted of**, returning to **simplicity and purity**,\n**Lusts and cravings** are **extinguished**, merging with **nature**.\nThe *Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\n*Do not seek merit and fame, return to nature.*\n*Again, it says:*\n*Eliminate lusts and cravings,*\n*Abandon vexation and confusion.*\n\nThe **virtuous scholar** can **embrace simplicity**,\nYet even the **beautiful woman** cannot **compare to rustic elegance**.\nThe *Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\n*Discard the **music of Zheng**,*\n*Keep distant from **flatterers**.*\n\nWith **empty mind and full belly**, diligently **cultivate the Dao/Way**,\nThe *Dao/Way Dejing* says:\n*Empty its mind,*\n*Fill its belly.*",

one can remain as innocent as a child,\nWithout clinging to dual distinctions.\n\nWhen deeds are done, let not the axe be raised—\nThus virtue’s depth is manifest.\nOnly then does one lay the foundation for Sun’s strategy through ages.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nThe Dao/Way nurtures all things,\nGrows vast yet never severs—\nIt serves as vessel and instrument.\nAgain it says: *Since it does not rule as sovereign,*\nThose who can thus remain—\nAre said to possess the profound virtue of the Dao/Way.\n\n**Chapter Thirty: The Thirty Spokes**\nEmpty as the hub, yet one with the Dao’s mystery,\nThe thirty spokes fulfill their function with depth.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nAncient chariots had thirty spokes,\nFollowing the cycles of the moon.\nAll converging at the hub—\nThe hub, with its hollow core,\nWhere all spokes are gathered.\nTo govern the self, one must purge emotion and desire,\nEmpty the Five Viscera—\nThen the Spirit returns to its source.\nTo govern the state, one must gather all under a single strength,\nAnd uphold the mighty.\nClarify its principle:\nThe clay vessel, formed yet empty, holds its capacity,\nWindows and doors open—\nThe

Nature in obscurity,\nYet laments the world’s desires while tuning the Spirit’s strings in silence.\nWith one uncluttered mind, all minds submit—\nOnly then does the mind of transcendent ease emerge.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nThe void shapes the manifest.\n**Chapter Five: The Five Colors**\nIf one can debase the eyes and dissolve the Six Passions,\nThen the belly’s needs alone shall govern—\nLike a horse adjusted to its harness.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:\nThus the Sage acts for the belly, not the eyes.\nFor the belly means to purge the Six Passions,\nAnd debasing the eyes means no reckless gazing.\n\nWhen the mouth grows wanton, green with envy for refined feasts,\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:\nThe Five Flavors make the mouth reckless.\nReckless, it speaks in vain—\nLost to the Dao/Way.\nWhen the heart runs wild, it’s as though galloping after gold in the hunt.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:\nTo chase and hunt across fields,\nMakes the heart grow mad.\nAgain

Doctrine’s simplicity—\nWithout dwelling in caves or valleys, one finds true ease.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: Honor and Humiliation as Startling**\nThe Venerable Master descends with clear intent:\nHonor and humiliation—\nBoth are cause for alarm.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:\nHonor and humiliation as startling.\nWhy sully oneself in lowly station?\nWhen merit is earned, let it fade—\nAnd yield to

profound.\nFan Li took the humble boat and fled—\nForever safeguarding his merit and fame.\nTo curb worldly dust and expand vast aid,\nWhen deeds are done, retire to preserve one’s path.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Unseen**\nXi Yi, the Obscure, and the Minute—\nAll three merge as one.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:\nThe Obscure, the Minute, and the Vast—\nThese three blend into unity.\nIn motion, endless as the cord’s pull,\nYet cannot be named—\nBeyond the hues of *xuan* and *huang*,\nNot to be grasped by sight.\nDo not compare it to tones and rhythms,\nFor it is soundless.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nThe cord’s endless pull—\nUnnamable, for it is not a single hue,\nNot to be divided by green, yellow, red, white, or black.\nNot a single sound,\nNot to be distinguished by the five tones.\nNot a single form,\nNot to be measured by length, breadth, or size.\n\nPurge emotion and desire—\nThe True Nature’s wind gathers.\nCling to the ancient, align with the present—\nThe ultimate transformation clears.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nTo uphold the ancient Dao/Way’s non-action,\nAnd govern the present’s affairs—\nThen one returns to simplicity and purity.\n\nExpand the Dao/Way without division or obscurity,\nCommunicate universally above and below—\nThus clarity shines.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:\nIts upper reaches are not dazzling,\nIts lower depths are not murky.\nAgain it says:\nThose above must be clear,\nThose below must be murky.\nYet the Dao/Way is neither above nor below,\nNor is it clear or murky in itself.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Sage’s Conduct**\nThe ancient Sage who excelled in virtue\nGuarded the Dao’s mysterious path.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nMysterious—\nLike Heaven’s vastness.\nHis resolve and conduct were profound,\nBeyond the Dao/Way’s reach.\nInner vision as blind,\nReturned hearing as deaf—\nYet he knew its length.\nSteady as winter’s river crossing,\nHis True Nature revealed.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:\nSteady as crossing a river in winter.\nAgain it says:\nSteady—\nUnruffled ease.\nThe Sage, in times of transition,\nActs like crossing winter’s river,\nWhile common folk cling and fear.\nNow I am unsoiled,\nThus my ease is steady.\n\nDissolving like ice in spring,\nThe world’s dust vanishes.\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:\nDissolving like ice about to melt.\nAgain it says:\nDissolving—\nScattering and fading,\nPurging emotion, abandoning desire—\nEach day grows clearer,\nLike spring ice melting away.\n\nSlowly purified, none recognize—\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nWater murky must first be stilled,\nThen gradually clears itself.\nYet even in murkiness,\nIt can blend with the common.\n\n*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:\nThe muddy guards

*The Virtue/Power of Non-Attachment*\n\nOne must know that the Virtue/Power of the Highest Dao seeks no reward,\nand seeking reward only betrays its boundless measure.\n\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"Those of the Highest Virtue/Power give without seeking return,\nwhile those of lesser Virtue/Power must always expect reward in kind.\"\n\nTo embody the Dao, one must hold steadfast to its depth,\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"Rulers who align with the Dao possess extraordinary techniques to save all beings.\nWhen their deeds are complete and their influence profound,\nthey dwell in the Dao’s pure simplicity,\nnot in the superficiality of rites and propriety.\"\n\nTheir grand ambition lies in non-action—\nunadorned, they reject all pomp.\n\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"Action is the Dao’s superficiality.\nRites and propriety are Virtue/Power’s adornment.\nThus, the Sage abides in the affairs of non-action,\ndwelling in its depth,\nand never in its shallowness.\nTo abandon the practices of rites and propriety,\nto discard their adornment,\nis to return to their true essence.\"\n\nThe Three Sovereigns were pure and simple—truly worthy of emulation,\nwhile the Six Kingdoms, though lavish, fall short of praise.\n\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"Speaking of rites in the age of simplicity is either madness or reckless abandon.\nTo forget rites in a time of excess is either foolishness or deceit.\nIf one can dissolve and renew them,\nthey must abandon rites to practice justice,\nabandon justice to practice benevolence,\nabandon benevolence to practice Virtue/Power,\nand forget Virtue/Power to merge with the Dao.\nWhen people return to simplicity,\nthey embody the Highest Virtue/Power’s non-action.\"\n\nThe hidden deeds of governance yield the greatest merit—\nfar surpassing the alchemy of gold and elixirs.\n\nThe Sovereign of the Xī Dynasty inscribed the trigrams to cultivate culture,\nwhile the Sovereign of the Xuān Dynasty hung the mirror to pacify chaos.\nEmperor Yáo wore unadorned robes,\nEmperor Shùn danced with feathers,\nGreat Yǔ tamed the floods,\nEmperor Tāng abolished the nets—\neach achieved great deeds in their age,\nbringing governance that secured life and longevity for the people.\nCould the alchemist alone compare to their Virtue/Power and Dao?\n\n---\n\nChapter Thirty-Nine: *The Virtue/Power of Unity*\n\nWhen rulers attain the One, they govern the world with ease.\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* says:\n\"When rulers attain non-action,\nthe world naturally aligns.\"\n\nAll things follow the Dao’s subtle essence and come to life.\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"All things follow the Dao’s subtle essence,\nthus they are born and never perish.\"\n\nTheir teachings are clear without ostentation,\ntheir names are humble without self-aggrandizement.\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"舆 (yú) is another name for a carriage.\nWhen all parts are complete, it is called a carriage (舆).\nWhen separated, they are called wheels, axles, and spokes—\neach with its own name—\nthus, there is no single *舆*.\nSimilarly, kings and rulers call themselves *孤寡不谷* (gū guà bù yú),\nabandoning grand titles,\nand returning to the essence of humility.\nThis is the profound Virtue/Power of yielding and modesty.\"\n\nThe high heavens are empty and tranquil—\nthe stars shine brightly in order.\n\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"The heavens follow the Dao’s purity and emptiness,\nthus they are exalted and never sullied by worldly things.\"\n\nThe thick earth is settled and peaceful—\nthe Nine Regions lie undisturbed.\n\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"The earth follows the Dao’s yielding and compliance,\nthus it is stable and peaceful,\nenduring all things without ever tipping or moving.\"\n\nThe Sovereign’s deeds are vast and far-reaching,\nwhile the mountain-dwelling recluse acts alone in seclusion.\n\nThe Sovereign of the Xuān Dynasty pacified the troubles of Chī Yóu,\nsaving all beings,\nand the people received eternal blessings,\nspreading everlasting beauty.\n\nThough the Prince of the State of Wáng (子晋) may have charmed the phoenix with his flute,\ncrossed the world on the dragon,\nand saved himself alone—\nuntainted by dust—\nhis kindness extended to all,\nyet he lacked the true techniques of salvation.\n\n---\n\nChapter Forty: *The Dao’s Movement of Return*\n\nThe ruler seeks the Mystic Gate without wearying—\nthe spirit’s traces emerge, manifesting as the Pine and the Qiao.\n\nThe Pine Child (赤松子) and Wáng Qiao (王乔),\nboth ancient masters who attained the Dao and transcended the world.\n\nThe tranquil earth’s axis generates all things broadly,\nwhile the heavens’ movements harmonize the sequence of qi.\n\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"As the heavens are strong and vigorous,\nthey move the sun and moon in day and night,\nand the four seasons cycle endlessly without rest.\nThus, those who cultivate the Dao,\nif they can clear their hearts,\nmove the qi within their bodies day and night without pause—\nthey align with the heavens’ enduring nature.\n\nIt further notes:\n\"The things of heaven and earth are all things.\nThe Dao is *有* (yǒu, existence).\nThe Dao generates all things,\nthus we know that the things of heaven and earth are born from *有*,\nand *有* arises from *无* (wú, non-existence).\nIf all things attain the Dao’s essence—\nthe harmonious interplay of the strong and yielding—\nthey will achieve longevity and swift transformation.\nHence, it is said:\n*The things of heaven and earth are born from existence,\nexistence from non-existence.*\"\n\nThe worthy minister plans strategies for governance—\nto aid and assist in the realm’s affairs.\n\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"Those who wield authority must return to reality,\nand those who act must rely on non-action.\nIf one can forget both authority and reality,\nand erase both existence and non-existence,\nthey embody the principle of aiding and assisting in governance.\"\n\nThe Perfect Ones cultivate and attain true freedom.\n\nThose who cultivate their bodies discard cleverness and brilliance,\nconceal their light, and refine their practice—\nin quietude, they find freedom and ease.\nYet they do not know the Dao of aiding and assisting in governance.\n\nTo govern oneself and the realm in hidden merit is sufficient—\none will naturally ascend to the Vermilion Gate’s court.\n\nIf one governs their body fully and achieves success in the realm,\nthey will follow the Pine Child and Wáng Qiao,\nascending together to the Vermilion Gate.\n\n---\n\nChapter Forty-One: *The Virtue/Power of the Superior*\n\nThe Superior, Middle, and Inferior all hear the Dao,\nyet their acceptance and practice differ in origin.\n\nThe Superior, upon hearing the Dao, acts with resolve—\nthe Inferior, lost in confusion, laughs in derision.\n\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* says:\n\"The Superior, upon hearing the Dao, acts with resolve.\nThe Middle, upon hearing the Dao, clings to it uncertainly.\nThe Inferior, upon hearing the Dao, laughs in derision.\nTo not laugh is insufficient for the Dao.\"\n\nAdvancing is like stepping into a deep abyss—\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* says:\n\"Advancing in the Dao is like retreating.\"\n\nClarity is like floating clouds reflecting distant space.\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"Clarity in the Dao conceals its traces,\nnurturing its purity,\nwhich is the Sage’s true achievement.\"\n\nCultivating Virtue/Power is like stealing merit—\none’s name is inscribed in the Jade Emperor’s palace.\n\n*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:\n\"Virtue/Power is cultivated inwardly,\nyet outwardly appears as if stolen,\ndesiring no recognition,\nand achieving merit without ostentation.\"\n\n---\n\nChapter Forty-Two: *The Dao Generates the One*",
