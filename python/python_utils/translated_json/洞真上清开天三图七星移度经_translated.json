  "full_translation": "**The Wondrous Perfection Highest Clarity Scripture of the Three Celestial Diagrams and the Seven Stars’ Transference of Destiny**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Wondrous Perfection Highest Clarity Scripture of the Heavenly Pass, Three Diagrams, and the Seven Stars’ Transference of Destiny*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin dynasty. A foundational scripture of the early Highest Clarity tradition. Originally one scroll, later divided into two. Source text: *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\n---\n\n**The Wondrous Perfection Highest Clarity Scripture of the Three Celestial Diagrams and the Seven Stars’ Transference of Destiny, Volume One**\n\n**The Supreme Method for Transcending Death, Preserving Life, and Securing Immortality**\n\nThe Heavenly Pass is the Gate of Life of the Nine Heavens, governing the southeast corner of the Nine Heavens. It is also called the Celestial Diagram or the Heavenly Pass, hence the Three Passes. It is the path traversed by the host of perfected beings, the course tread by divine immortals, and the way by which scholars ascend. It lies five thousand *li* from the Golden Portal and seven thousand *li* from the Upper Palace of Jade Clarity. Once one has passed through the Three Passes, one may ascend to the Golden Portal and wander in the feasts of Jade Clarity.\n\nThe First Heavenly Pass stands atop a nine-tiered jade terrace, rising twelve hundred *zhang* above the earth. Below, thousands of long serpents, flying dragons, and venomous beasts guard the Jade Pass, while three thousand mighty warriors, clad in interlocking golden armor, stand vigil at the gates. The Jade Dawn Overseer of the Great Void, whose name is Void Supreme Clarity, resides upon the jade terrace. Flying clouds and flowing auroras flank his chamber, while the mysterious radiance of sun and moon illumines Jade Clarity. Three hundred perfected immortals attend him, presiding over the entry and exit of ascending immortals and the opening of the pass.\n\nThe Second Heavenly Pass stands atop a six-tiered jade terrace, nine hundred *zhang* in height. Below, thousands of long serpents, flying dragons, and venomous beasts guard the Jade Pass, while three thousand mighty warriors, clad in interlocking golden armor, stand guard at either side of the gate. The Supreme Overseer of Perfected Jade, whose name is Bright Elder, is enthroned upon the jade terrace. Crimson clouds and purple canopies shroud his chamber, while the mysterious light of sun and moon shines between them. Three hundred perfected immortals attend him, overseeing the passage of the host of perfected beings as they wander and feast.\n\nThe Third Heavenly Pass stands atop a three-tiered jade terrace, six hundred *zhang* in height. Below, thousands of long serpents, flying dragons, and venomous beasts guard the Jade Pass, while three thousand mighty warriors, clad in interlocking golden armor, stand guard at either side. The Supreme Emperor’s Overseer of Perfected Jade, whose name is Heavenly Eternal Life, is enthroned upon the jade terrace. Dark clouds veil its summit, while ethereal mists perfume its courtyard. A light of self-illumination gleams upon his form. Three hundred perfected immortals attend him, presiding over the celestial host of perfected beings, the earthly multitude of living beings, and the registers and records that govern their passage.\n\nThose who receive the Dao of inscribing their names upon golden tablets and jade slips must cultivate the method of passing through the Heavenly Pass. At dawn and dusk, one should enter the chamber, burn incense, and strike the teeth twelve times. Facing east, bow in reverence to the four directions, and visualize the boundary of the Nine Heavens, clearly perceiving the Three Passes below in vivid detail. When the vision is complete, next visualize the Seven Stars above the heavens, revolving with the celestial motion. Envision your body upon the stars of the Heavenly Pass, the Seven Stars carrying you to the base of the jade terrace of the Heavenly Pass. There, present a jade slip and announce your name to the Jade Dawn Overseer of the Great Void. See the overseer inscribe your name upon the jade register, permitting your passage to the base of the Heavenly Pass.\n\nNext, visualize your body returning to the Seven Stars, which carry you to the base of the jade terrace of the Heavenly Pass. Present another jade slip and announce your name before the Supreme Overseer of Perfected Jade. See the overseer inscribe your name upon the jade register, permitting your passage to the base of the Heavenly Pass.\n\nThen, visualize your body returning once more to the Seven Stars, which carry you to the base of the jade terrace of the Heavenly Pass. Present another jade slip and announce your name before the Supreme Emperor’s Overseer of Perfected Jade. See the overseer inscribe your name upon the jade register, permitting your passage to the Golden Portal beneath the Palace of Jade Clarity.\n\nNext, visualize the Seven Stars receding, your body suspended in the Void of Emptiness, adrift in the primordial chaos, with nothing to rely upon or perceive. After a moment, you will find yourself above the Golden Gate of the Golden Portal and Jade Capital. Present a golden slip, and see the Four Pole Perfected Ones receive it upon a jade table, entering to announce it before the Lord Emperor of the Golden Portal. The Four Pole Perfected Ones will report and ascend with you to the summit of Jade Clarity.\n\nNext, visualize the summit of Jade Clarity, where the Four Poles stretch boundlessly, with only verdant *qi* billowing thickly. Above, there is no heaven; below, no earth. Only at the center do four golden gates open in all directions, within which stand palaces of jasper and jade trees, golden branches flourishing on either side. Mighty dragons and beasts roam and play upon their peaks. Envision yourself wandering among them for a long while, until you feel as though awakening from sleep, your body returning to its resting state. Within, you will feel a vague, ethereal sensation, as though treading upon emptiness. When the vision of your journey is complete, strike the teeth sixteen times and recite the incantation while gazing upward:\n\n*\"The Three Flowers’ precious radiance,\nThe Jade Capital opens in clarity.\nMysterious splendor unfolds,\nIllumining the formless overseer.\nGolden tablets record the script,\nInscribing names upon jade.\nBrightly beholding the Nine Heavens,\nAscending to sport in the Three Clarities.\nThe Three Diagrams of the Heavenly Pass,\nReturning to ascend the Purple Court.\nReceiving titles in the Golden Portal,\nEastern Florescence records life.\nAttaining the Eight Effulgences,\nDriving the flying plow.\"*\n\nWhen finished, swallow the *qi* nine times and cease.\n\nThose who study the Dao yet do not know the method of passing through the Heavenly Pass or the way of presenting tablets and inscribing names will never achieve success. The Three Passes govern all the heavens and earths, the flying immortals, and the registers of beginning scholars—none may bypass the Three Passes.\n\nIf a diligent student of the Dao can ensure their jade name is recorded in the Nine Heavens and the Three Passes, and that the Jade Dawn of the Three Passes presents it to the Palace of the Supreme and the Supreme Emperor, then the Lord Emperor will dispatch twelve jade lads and twelve jade maidens to attend and protect them.\n\nThis is the Supreme Emperor’s Upper Scripture, transmitted to the Lord Emperor of Heaven. The Lord Emperor of Heaven transmitted it to the Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Pole, who transmitted it to the Lord Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity. The Lord Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity transmitted it to the Lord Emperor of the Golden Portal, who entrusted it to the Prime Minister, the Azure Lad, to teach future scholars destined to become perfected beings.\n\nAccording to the Mysterious Statutes, this may be transmitted thrice within seven hundred years. The Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Pole commands ninety Western Florescence Jade Maidens to guard within the Southern Pole’s Purple Chamber.\n\nThe Azure Lad states: Those whose bone and countenance accord with the Mysterious may behold this Dao, learn the method of submitting memorial tablets, and thereby become perfected beings. Yet the statutes are exceedingly weighty—this must not be lightly divulged. Among the multitudes of scholars, how few encounter the true! Thus the Central Yellow and Old Lord declared: One who beholds the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Perfected Scripture* shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight. Yet some who cultivate it for years achieve no success and claim the scripture is not true. This is solely because their names are not recorded on the Golden Tablet in the Eastern Florescence or the Jade Slip in the Golden Portal; the true spirits do not descend for them, and they are instead assailed by celestial demons, resulting in no response. Though they may obtain myriad divine scriptures, they will still not succeed.\n\nIf one first submits a Golden Tablet to the Azure Palace and presents a Jade Slip to the Imperial Sovereign, receiving the attendance of the Golden Dawn Jade Lads and Western Florescence Jade Maidens to guard the numinous text, and if this is proclaimed throughout the heavens and earth, with the Three Realms extolling its virtue and chanting its verses ten thousand times—how could one fail to evoke the response of jade chariots and purple carriages?\n\n**Memorial for Submitting Jade Slips at the Three Passes of Heaven**\nPresented at the Jade Terrace of the Heavenly Pass, beneath the supervision of the Great Void Jade Dawn Inspector:\n[Name], of [prefecture, county, village], male/female, born in the year of [zodiac], aged [years], born in the [month], styled [courtesy name].\n\nPresented at the Jade Terrace of the Heavenly Chart, beneath the supervision of the Supreme Perfected Jade Gentleman Inspector:\n[Name], of [prefecture, county, village], male/female, born in the year of [zodiac], aged [years], born in the [month], styled [courtesy name].\n\nPresented at the Jade Terrace of the Heavenly Pass, beneath the supervision of the Supreme Emperor’s Perfected Jade Controller:\n[Name], of [prefecture, county, village], male/female, born in the year of [zodiac], aged [years], born in the [month], styled [courtesy name].\n\nThe above three Jade Slips shall each be one foot and six inches in length.\n\n**Memorial for Submitting a Jade Slip at the Golden Pass**\nPresented before the Golden Portal Emperor Lord:\n[Name], of [prefecture, county, village], male/female, born in the year of [zodiac], aged [years], born in the [month], styled [courtesy name].\n\nThe above Jade Slip shall be one foot and six inches in length.\n\nThe Azure Lad states: If one lacks a Golden Tablet, silver or wood may suffice; if one lacks a Jade Slip, paulownia wood may suffice—so long as it is refined and flawless, with unbroken grain.\n\nThe Azure Lad further states: When submitting the Jade Slips at the Heavenly Pass, Heavenly Chart, and Heavenly Pass, ascend the path to the Azure Palace and the Golden Portal of the Jade Clarity. Write the Jade Slip in azure ink, first enter the chamber and strike the teeth twelve times, then face east to read the slip. After completing the visualization practice, place the slip in a cloud-brocade pouch, burn incense beside it, and never expose it lightly. This is the supreme title of the highest perfected beings, the numinous scripture of the Jade Emperor.\n\nIf one’s golden name and jade characters are inscribed in reverse in the Azure Palace and one obtains this Dao, one must follow the statutes of the Supreme Perfected: prepare one Golden Tablet and one Jade Slip, each one foot and two inches long, two inches and four parts wide, along with one golden fish and one jade dragon. Offer one hundred feet of purple silk and thirty feet of azure damask as the covenant of the Supreme Perfected, presenting them to one’s scripture-holding master. The master faces east, the recipient faces north, and they swear an oath before the Northern Emperor and their seven ancestors, pledging not to divulge the secret. According to the Mysterious Statutes, this may be transmitted thrice within seven hundred years. If transmitted to an unworthy recipient, the seven mysteries and nine ancestors shall be eternally consigned to ghostly servitude, their bodies perishing in the Nine Springs, never to attain immortality.\n\nDevoted scholars and those who aspire to immortality must adhere to the statutes and cultivate in accordance with the text. This precious scripture is treasured by the Supreme Emperor Lord, who transmitted it to the Heavenly Emperor Lord. The Heavenly Emperor Lord transmitted it to the Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Pole, who transmitted it to the Supreme Emperor Lord of the Supreme Tenuity. The Supreme Emperor Lord of the Supreme Tenuity transmitted it to the Sage Lord of the Golden Portal, who entrusted it to the Prime Minister, the Azure Lad, to teach those destined to become immortals. Thus, it is transmitted once every seven hundred years. The Supreme Primordial Lord commands thirty-six Western Florescence Jade Maidens to safeguard the numinous text within the Southern Pole’s Purple Chamber.\n\nThe Heavenly Emperor Lord states: This scripture governs the writings of the Nine Heavens and the hidden texts of the Eight Assemblies, surpassing all other Daoist teachings and excelling beyond the jade scriptures. Thus, the Central Yellow and Old Lord concealed the *Thirty-Nine Chapters*, and the Supreme Emperor Lord treasured the *Seven Primes’ Transference*. Though the Three Vehicles each display their wonders, their practical application does not align.\n\nPerfected beings merely know how to tread the celestial net and gaze upward at the Five Dawns, swallowing qi and imbibing mist, chewing the solar root, absorbing the mysterious infusion of flowing essence, and returning to vast whiteness to prolong their years. Yet they do not comprehend the transference of the Seven Stars, the opening and closing of the Heavenly Pass, the revolving of the Nine Qi for self-contemplation, or the preservation of the Seven Essences in the Muddy Pellet. Those who practice this Dao shall ride upon clouds of emerald carriages, and thus the Supreme Emperor is honored as the utmost in supremacy.\n\nThe Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Pole states: From refining and gathering the Mysterious Radiance, exhaling and inhaling the flowing mist, consolidating the hun and po, securing essence and preserving spirit, to wielding the Purple Transcendence and the Scorching Radiance, ringing the Golden Fire Bell, binding the luminous brilliance and galloping to the moon, commanding ten thousand transformations of the solar effulgence, the Nine Perfected and Eight Daoists donning the solar and lunar imperial splendor, wearing jade pendants and golden girdles, and visualizing the true forms of the Two Effulgences—such practices number over three hundred. Yet even if one causes the Mysterious Radiance to ascend and infuse, reposing in the numinous palace, one has still not received the transference of the Seven Stars, the pivotal mechanism of heaven, nor traversed the Twenty-Eight Constellations, revolved the two luminaries of sun and moon, drawn from the Five Dawns for combined use, or resolved the union and separation in the bedchamber. Then the heavens shall descend purple mist, and the Emperor shall dispatch the Golden Dawn Lads.\n\nIf one can endure hardship, accumulate devotion, and resonate with the Mysterious Palace, within seven years one may ride the emerald shafts of the Three Pure Ones’ flying carriage, ascending to the Imperial Dawn—truly subtle and wondrous, an unfathomable transformation!\n\nThe Supreme Emperor Lord of the Supreme Tenuity states: Perfected beings merely know how to tread the celestial net and traverse the Seven Primes, yet they do not comprehend the transference of the Seven Stars or the opening of the Heavenly Pass. They do not revolve the Dipper’s net to shield the body, nor circulate the Seven Degrees to ensure longevity. They do not depart from the northeastern \"Gate of Death\" nor unite with the southwestern \"Gate of Life.\" Practicing this for fourteen years, one shall evoke the descent of the jade chariot and the flying carriage of cinnabar mist, ascending in broad daylight to the Golden Portal’s palace.\n\nThe Golden Portal Sage Lord states: The Dao of the Heavenly Pass is easy to unfold yet difficult to comprehend; the transference of the Seven Primes is hard to perceive yet easy to practice. The separation and union of the Two Symbols are the source of life and death. Humans receive qi and possess thirteen modes of life; when fate reaches its end, they return to thirteen modes of death. Thus, the Heavenly Pass serves as the pivot of separation and union, while the Seven Primes are the root of life and death. Those who cultivate lofty practices and seek immortality with sincere devotion, yet do not know how to seal the death-qi at the Ghost Gate, transfer the life-qi through the Human Gate, revolve the Seven Stars to the northeast, or unfold the Heavenly Pass to the southwest, shall not escape mortality—attaining Perfection will be exceedingly difficult. If one bears a golden name in the Eastern Florescence and a jade title in the Upper Clarity, having beheld this Dao, then the root of deathlessness shall be established. Practicing this for seven years, one shall hold the rank of a named immortal, ascend in a flying carriage of emerald shafts, the body of a cinnabar youth, and mount the Mysterious Palace.\n\nThe Most Exalted Minister, the Azure Lad Lord, states: The turning mechanism revolves through Heaven and Earth, the Mysterious Dipper governs the Eight Gates, its flowing radiance illumines the Nine Empyreans, the celestial might shakes the Ten Directions. The celestial patterns are arrayed upon the Heavenly Chart, life and death are encompassed within the Seven Primes. The Five Separations are firmly established to suppress death, while the Six Harmonies are gathered for self-protection. If one can ride the High Perfected to seek deliverance, seal the Ghost Gate at the Heavenly Pass, ingest the Nine Essences to inwardly illuminate, and visualize the Mysterious Dipper’s subtle glow, one shall summon the flying carriage of cinnabar mist and the clouds of the Three Pure Ones, soaring through the void to ascend to the Empyrean Dawn. Those who cultivate the Dao of transposing the Seven Stars shall summon the Nine Lords of the Jade Emperor; with the inner illumination of Mysterious Essence, they sever the root of death. One must dwell in a secluded chamber with a tranquil mind, undisturbed by worldly dust, standing alone to face the light, gazing upon the Empyrean Dawn. Burn incense to left and right, diffuse mist in the courtyard of rosy clouds, concentrate the mind with earnest devotion, and remain awake on this day. After seven years of such practice, the jade carriage with its flying canopy and cinnabar shafts shall descend to welcome the adept’s body, ascending through the Heavenly Pass to seal the path of death in the northeast and inscribe the immortal’s name in the Southern Transcendence—this is the Dao most difficult to attain, yet the Perfected most readily descend.\n\nThose who possess a golden register and jade name may unfold this Dao. One should choose the days of the Six Celestial Convergences: *renyin*, *bingyin*, *jiazi*, *jiawu*, *xinwei*, and *xinchou*, for these are the times when the Most High aligns with the harmonious moments. On these days, the Jade Emperor routinely dispatches the Jade Lads of the Attendant Immortals to review and confirm the golden registers and jade names of the Eastern Florescence and Azure Palace, recording those who study the immortal’s path. On such days, if one’s diligent aspiration ascends to move the Jade Emperor, he shall command the Northern Emperor of Fengdu’s Six Palaces to sever the root of death’s register, inscribe the record of life at the Human Gate, transpose the Seven Stars to the Ghost Gate, transfer the Mysterious Pivot, and unfold the Heavenly Pass.\n\nWhenever practicing purification and fasting, one must earnestly visualize and focus inwardly. Close the eyes and internally store the vision, then knock the teeth thirty-six times. Visualize the First Celestial Star, the Supreme August Mysterious Pivot of Yang Brightness, the Celestial Pivot Hun Spirit, the Nine Lords of the Upper Mysterious, clad in flying cloud brocade skirts, crowned with the coronet of the Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into one’s body. Then recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Supreme August Mysterious Pivot of Yang Brightness, Celestial Pivot Hun Spirit, Nine Perfected Lords of the Upper Mysterious, blending and transforming as one spirit—may you sever my path of death at the Ghost Gate, transfer the record of life to the Southern Pavilion, remove the Seven Mysteries from the Three Paths, and rebirth me to become an immortal. Revolve the Seven Essences to grant me mysterious shade, and deliver my form through the Heavenly Pass.\"*\n\nAfterward, swallow qi fourteen times.\n\nNext, visualize the Second Primordial Star, the Northern Womb Yin Essence, the Celestial Chariot Hun Spirit, the Nine Jade Lords of the Upper Mystery, all clad in yellow brocade flying skirts and coronets of the Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into one’s body. Swallow qi and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Northern Womb Yin Essence, Celestial Chariot Hun Spirit, Nine Jade Lords of the Upper Mystery, blending myriad transformations as one spirit—may you erase my yang transgressions in the Great Yin, transfer yin qi to the Great Yang, transpose the Seven Primes to sever death, and unfold the Six Harmonies at the Heavenly Pass. Deliver my seven ancestors from the Three Paths, and grant me rebirth in the Southern Pavilion.\"*\n\nAfterward, swallow qi fourteen times.\n\nNext, visualize the Third True Star, the Nine Ultimates of the Upper Perfected, the Lady of the Upper Primordial, the Celestial Mechanism Po Essence, the Nine Pure Lords of the Upper Simplicity, all clad in azure brocade flying skirts and coronets of the Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into one’s body. Swallow qi and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Nine Ultimates of the Upper Perfected, Lady of the Upper Primordial, Celestial Mechanism Po Essence, Nine Pure Lords of the Upper Simplicity, blending and transforming as one spirit—may you unfold and dissolve the roots of karmic opposition, sever the source of the deathly path. Grant me eyes that see clearly and penetrate the boundless, with Mysterious Perfection pouring down and essence irrigating my body. May I grasp the August Chief Star, tread the Seven Primes, ride the luminous void, and soar alongside Heaven.\"*\n\nAfterward, swallow qi fourteen times.\n\nNext, visualize the Fourth Pivot Star, the Mysterious Mechanism of Profound Darkness, the Celestial Balance Hun Essence, the Nine Void Lords of the Upper Mystery, all clad in purple brocade flying skirts and coronets of the Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into one’s body. Recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Mysterious Mechanism of Profound Darkness, Celestial Balance Hun Essence, Nine Void Lords of the Upper Mystery, blending myriad transformations as one spirit—may you transpose the Seven Stars, fill and seal the Ghost Gate, sever the death-qi, and unfold the radiant Heavenly Pass. Revolve the Northern Dipper at the Mysterious Pivot, transfer the life-qi to the Western Kun, depart from the Northern Emperor of Fengdu, and inscribe my name in the Southern Pavilion.\"*\n\nAfterward, swallow qi fourteen times.\n\nNext, visualize the Fifth Principal Star, the Celestial Balance of Cinnabar Origin, the Jade Balance Hun Terrace, the Nine August Lords of the Upper Mystery, all clad in cinnabar brocade flying skirts and coronets of the Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into one’s body. Recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Celestial Balance of Cinnabar Origin, Jade Balance Hun Spirit, Nine August Lords of the Upper Mystery, blending myriad transformations as one spirit—may you descend the Seven Essences upon me, pour them into my body, revolve the Four to become Three, and activate the Seven Primes. Seal the Ghost Gate in the northeast, receive the life palace of the Nine Mysteries, inscribe my name in the Eastern Florescence, and allow me to serve the Jade Dawn.\"*\n\nAfterward, swallow qi fourteen times. With unwavering practice, one shall summon the guests of the Jade Emperor. The Emperor shall descend upon a thoroughfare of purple clouds, accompanied by twelve Western Florescence Jade Maidens and twelve Golden Dawn Jade Lads to attend and guard the adept’s body.\n\nAfterward, swallow qi fourteen times. Next, visualize the Sixth Register Star, the Life-Mechanism of the Northern Ultimate, the Radiant Yang Hun-Spirit Terrace, the Nine Lords of the Upper Cinnabar and Void. Clad in crimson brocade flying skirts and crowned with the Dark Dawn’s coronet, they descend from the Dark Dipper into one’s body. Recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Life-Mechanism of the Northern Ultimate, Radiant Yang Hun-Spirit Terrace, Upper Cinnabar and Void Nine Lords—blending myriad transformations as one spirit—may you open for me the Heavenly One’s Three Charts of the Mystic Pass above, revolve the Six Palaces of Fengdu below, and govern the yin officials. Sever the roots of nine deaths, return the Three to the Four, and inscribe my name in the Seven Primes. May I preserve eternity and share the Dipper’s lifespan.\"*\n\nAfterward, swallow qi fourteen times. Next, visualize the Seventh Barrier Star, the Dark Yang Celestial Barrier, the Shaking Brilliance of the Great Luminous Supreme Jade Emperor Dao Lord. Clad in cinnabar brocade flying gauze skirts and crowned with the Dark Dawn’s coronet, they descend from the Dark Dipper into one’s body. Recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Dark Yang Celestial Barrier, Shaking Brilliance of the Great Luminous Supreme Jade Emperor Dao Lord—blending myriad transformations as one spirit—may you summon for me the Nine Perfected Lords of the Imperial Dawn above. Merge the Nine Yin, revolve the Celestial Gate, and release my Seven Mysteries’ ancestors. Grant me roaming through the Dark Clouds, sever my Northern Yin’s roots of death, and inscribe my name in the Eastern Florescence’s Jade Register.\"*\n\nAfterward, swallow qi fourteen times. Upon completing the visualization of the Seven Primes, knock the teeth twelve times. With eyes closed, envision the seven stars of the Northern Dipper shining brilliantly, illuminating the north. The Dark Essence reflects inwardly, descending to cover one’s body. The Perfected Lords within the Dipper undergo hun-tun transformations, assuming no fixed form. Together, they ride clouds of green mist to welcome the adept’s body, ascending into the midst of the Seven Stars.\n\nOne perceives oneself at the center of the Dipper, beneath the Flourishing Canopy. Radiant essence blazes, encircling the body like a crown, revolving with the Dipper as a wheel turns. In an instant, the Celestial Barrier opens. The Seven Stars and Nine Lords each bestow the talismans of the Seven Primes’ Barrier-Opening, enabling control over the Six Palaces of the Northern Emperor and severing the roots of death-qi.\n\nUpon receiving the talismans, one revolves and returns to the original essence, dwelling once more within the Dipper. The seven talismans blaze like fiery essence, propelling the adept downward. Suddenly treading the void, in the blink of an eye, one rests in the grove of repose. Knock the teeth thirty-six times and, lifting the head, recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Dark Radiance illumines essence, flowing light takes lightning’s form. Shedding mist, I vanish and transform, ascending to the Seven Stars. The Turning Mechanism tightens its reins, swift as startled lightning. The Heavenly One opens the Barrier, conveying me to life’s inscription. The Northern Emperor’s yin palaces sever my death-name. If not conveyed, if not severed, I turn toward the Seven Essences. I bear the Seven Primes, flowing gold and fiery bells. The Barrier-Opening’s celestial mechanism floods the Eight Darknesses. I command the Six Jia, dispatch the Six Ding. Heaven sends down Dark Mist, the Emperor grants divine soldiers. I beseech the Eastern Florescence to record my jade name. Soaring through the void, I ascend to the Jade Purity.\"*\n\nThen, swallow qi thirty-six times and cease.\n\nThis concludes the Dao of opening the Celestial Barrier, severing the roots of death, and blending myriad transformations. Practicing this for seven years and bearing the Seven Primes’ Barrier-Opening will summon green-mist chariots to welcome the adept’s body. This method must be secretly cultivated; do not transmit it lightly.\n\n*The Upper Scroll of the* Wondrous True Highest Clarity Scripture of the Three Charts of Opening Heaven and the Seven Stars’ Transference of Destiny *#1: \"Celestial Barrier\" (originally miswritten as \"Opening Heaven\").*\n\n*The Lower Scroll of the* Wondrous True Highest Clarity Scripture of the Three Charts of Opening Heaven and the Seven Stars’ Transference of Destiny.\n\n**The Talismans of the Seven Primes’ Barrier-Opening of the Emperor Lord**\n- Right: Orpiment inscribed on fresh green silk.\n- Right: Malachite inscribed in crimson.\n- Right: Vermilion inscribed on blue-green silk (alternatively, yellow on plain silk).\n- Right: Orpiment inscribed on white silk.\n- Right: Orpiment inscribed on fresh purple silk (alternatively, black on plain silk).\n- Right: Black inscribed on yellow silk.\n- Right: Vermilion inscribed on blue-green silk.\n\nThe inner talismans of the Seven Primes’ Barrier-Opening were bestowed by the Emperor Lord upon the Heavenly Emperor Lord, who transmitted them to the Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Ultimate. The Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Ultimate transmitted them to the Heavenly Emperor Lord of the Grand Tenuity, who passed them to the Lord of the Golden Watchtower. The Lord of the Golden Watchtower entrusted them to the Azure Lad of the Upper Minister, who conferred them upon those destined for immortality.\n\nAccording to the *Scripture of the Four Poles’ Luminous Regulations*, these talismans emerge once every seven hundred years. The method of transmission requires the disciple to observe a seven-day fast, offering thirty-one feet of blue-threaded silk, seventy feet of blue silk, ninety feet of phoenix-patterned gauze, seven pairs of gold buttons, one pair each of gold fish and jade dragons as tokens of the oath. To receive the scripture without such tokens is to treat the celestial treasure lightly; to transmit it without upholding the oath is to leak the Dao of Heaven. Sages value the Dao and disdain wealth, thus transmitting it only with tokens. Those who vex over wealth while seeking the Dao will find the Dao ever distant. Even if one glimpses the treasure text amid such leaks, the body will perish among the ghost officials, calamity extending to the Seven Mysteries—no benefit shall arise from such attainment.\n\nIf one possesses sincere devotion, an empty and earnest heart, and petitions the Jade Emperor to inscribe their name in the Eastern Florescence, dwelling in secluded peaks and distancing oneself from the human realm, sacrificing one’s own clothing and sustenance—only then may the scripture be transmitted.\n\nScholars who study yet remain ignorant of Heaven’s Celestial Barrier and Earth’s Fengdu—where the Barrier governs spirits and Fengdu commands ghosts—fail to grasp that these two Emperors preside over life and death, bound by the Dipper’s pivotal mechanism. Thus, the Seven Stars’ transference severs the Six Palaces’ names, while the Celestial Barrier records the register of immortals. The Dark Dipper corresponds to the Flourishing Canopy, and the Seven Primes bestow the Barrier-Opening. The path to immortality lies near at hand.\n\nThe Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Ultimate declared: \"Those with aspiration are all illumined in heart by the Seven Stars and Nine Emperors. Through ardent seeking and苦念, one naturally attains this scripture. Cultivating it for seven years leads to ascending at dawn. Even if one merely venerates this scripture without visualization, burning incense to its left and right, the essence of the Seven Stars will still constantly illumine the chamber, and the officials of Fengdu will not dare approach the body.\"\n\nOnce the ritual of transference through the Seven Stars is complete, next visualize and invoke the Two August Stars. Sit upright facing east, and strike the teeth thirty-six times. Visualize the Two August Stars—the Nine Exalted Lords of the Eightfold Radiance of the Most High Jade Emperor, and the Lords of the Seven Primes of the Supreme Subtlety and the Jade Emperor of the Grand Tenuity—all clad in skirts of purple brocade woven with flying clouds, crowned with the coronets of the Dark Dawn. Descending from the Dark Dipper, they enter your body. Recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Most High Jade Emperor, Nine Exalted Lords of the Eightfold Radiance, Lords of the Seven Primes of the Supreme Subtlety and the Jade Emperor, Two August Ones who merge with the Nine Transformations of the Supreme God: for me, open the Celestial Barrier above, transfer and elevate my jade-name, sever and seal the demonic gate. Let the Six Palaces of the Northern Emperor cut off the roots of death. Ascend through the Seven Primes, bestow upon me the Eightfold Radiance, the Sevenfold Essence, the Ninefold August Flying Chariot, and the Green Canopy, that together we may ascend to the Imperial Dawn, collectively attend the August Consort, and command the myriad spirits.\"*\n\nUpon completion, swallow the qi twenty-one times.\n\n**Celestial Barrier-Opening Talisman of the Jade Emperor**\n*(Inscribed in realgar on fresh green jade.)*\n\n**Two August Stars Talisman**\n*(Ascend to the midst of the Flourishing Canopy of the Seven Stars.)*\n\nThe governance of the Two August Stars lies beneath the Flourishing Canopy, which perpetually veils them so that their luminous essence remains unseen, and no mortal may behold them. Thus, the *Golden Script in Jade Characters* states: *\"One who beholds the Two Stars extends life by six hundred years.\"* Without the Flying Celestial Talisman of the Two August Ones, one cannot ascend beneath the Flourishing Canopy, nor will the Two Stars reveal themselves to you. Once you bear the two talismans, the Two August Ones will naturally illumine your body with their dark radiance. Cultivating thus for seven years, you will ascend at dawn.\n\n**Method of the Northern Emperor’s Fengdu Six Palaces for Transcending Death**\nFengdu Mountain lies in the north, in the *gui* region, hence the northeast is the demonic gate, the root of the qi of death. The mountain stands two thousand six hundred *li* high, with a circumference of thirty thousand *li*. Beneath it lies the Primordial Cavern-Heaven, extending fifteen thousand *li* in circumference. Above and below, ghostly palaces abound. Atop the mountain stand the Six Palaces, and within the cavern lie another Six Palaces—each palace spans a thousand *li* in circumference, forming the abodes of the ghostly deities of the Six Heavens.\n\nThe First Palace is named the *Zhoujue Yin* Heavenly Palace, governing human affairs.\nThe Second Palace is named the *Taisha Liangshi Zong* Heavenly Palace.\nThe Third Palace is named the *Mingchen Naifan Wucheng* Heavenly Palace.\nThe Fourth Palace is named the *Tianzhao Zuiqi* Heavenly Palace.\nThe Fifth Palace is named the *Zongling Qifei* Heavenly Palace.\nThe Sixth Palace is named the *Gansi Lianwanlü* Heavenly Palace.\n\nThese Six Palaces are ruled by the Northern Emperor and governed by the ghostly deities of the Six Heavens, who record the names of mortals. None who die escape the Six Palaces of Fengdu. Thus, the August Lord constantly employs the Seven Stars to transfer and elevate those who cultivate immortality, passing through the Celestial Barrier to the Southern Ultimate’s palace, severing and sealing the northeastern gate of death.\n\nOnce the ritual of transference through Fengdu is complete, strike the left teeth nine times, intone the names of the Six Palaces, and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"I am a servant of the August Lord, my name inscribed in the Jade Purity. I do not govern the Six Heavens; the ghostly palaces of the Northern Emperor are all within my command. What ghost under my jurisdiction dares arise? At my right hangs the Barrier-Opening, at my left the Fire Bell. I hurl fire ten thousand *li*, my might subdues the myriad spirits. Those who offend are slain; those who trespass are punished. By the August Lord’s decree, none shall escape capture.\"*\n\nWith this, the ritual is complete. After the first recitation, the celestial radiance trembles; after the second, the myriad demons bind their forms; after the third, ghostly fiends are eradicated, the Six Palaces erase mortal names of death, the Celestial Barrier transfers the living, and the Southern Ultimate revives the dead. One who does not study the names of the Fengdu Palaces or the governance of its ghostly deities, who does not learn to sever and seal the realm of death, will never attain immortality.\n\n**Supreme Method of the Five Separations for Cutting Off Death and Ascending to Life**\nTo practice the Way of the Six Convergences and Transference, one must cultivate the Five Dawns to sever ties with the gate of death and ascend to the palace of life, the method of flying immortality.\n\nChoose the days of *renshen*, *bingshen*, *wushen*, *jiashen*, and *gengshen*—the Five Separation days of death. At this time, the August Lord holds a grand feast, riding a chariot of luminous dragons, a flying canopy of green mist, accompanied by immortal officials and jade maidens, circling the Ten Heavens before descending to the mortal realm to inspect and examine those who cultivate immortality. He commands the Five Lords of the Northern Darkness of the Northern Emperor to present the Registers of Death at the Accounting Palace of Pingdu, where the ledgers of life and death are reviewed and tallied.\n\nThe True August Lords of the Five Stars of the Five Directions each govern one direction, collectively overseeing all immortals who are to attain the Dao, their names proclaimed in the Eastern Florescence. For those burdened by yin sins, yin transgressions, yang sins, or yang transgressions—offenses bound to the Northern Emperor—the Lords of the Northern Darkness declare their names in the palaces of Fengdu, separating the good from the evil, the living from the dead.\n\nThus, on the Five Separation days, one first repents before the Northern Darkness, cultivates life before the Great Yang, removes the register of death from the Northern Emperor, and seeks the record of immortality from the Five Stars. On each of these days, don immaculate robes, burn incense, enter the chamber, repent of transgressions, contemplate goodness, visualize the spirits within, and focus the mind on the mysterious, free of distractions. As the August Lord traverses the Five Realms, the divine officials record your merits and proclaim your name to the Jade Emperor.\n\nAfter five years of such practice, the True August Lords of the Five Stars will descend to your chamber.\n\nOn these days, at the three times of dawn, noon, and midnight, enter the chamber, burn incense, bow twice to the north, strike the teeth three times, and visualize while reciting the incantation:\n\n*\"Most High Jade Emperor, I beseech you to absolve the yin evils and unrighteous deeds committed by my seven generations of ancestors down to myself—killing, licentiousness, arrogance, jealousy, harm to the true Dharma, the thousand offenses and ten thousand transgressions, the yang sins and yin transgressions—all names reported to the Northern Emperor. I beg for their dispersal and erasure, the elimination of my sinful name, the severing of the roots of death, the transfer through the Celestial Barrier of humanity, that I may be inscribed in the Eastern Florescence, my name recorded in the celestial register. May my seven generations of ancestors and parents return to the womb of the Southern Immortals.\"*\n\nUpon completion, visualize the essence of the True August Lord of the Chen Star in the northern direction, clad in a flying skirt of purple brocade, a tiger tally at his waist, a yellow coronet upon his head, riding a cloud of brocade mist. Accompanied by twelve immortal officials, he descends from the north to cover your body. His radiance is lush and resplendent, his essence dazzling and brilliant. Look up and recite the incantation:\n\nThe True August Lord of the North, Sovereign of Flying Immortals, riding clouds in a returning chariot, descends to crown my body. I beg that he seal my ghostly gate, sever the roots of death, inscribe my name in the Jade Purity, and release the Celestial Barrier. May I depart from the Northern Emperor, ascend to the Southern Terrace, and with the True August Lord, together guard the Northern Star in eternal life.\n\nThen swallow qi twenty-five times and cease. Face east, bow twice, and knock the teeth three times. Visualize and recite the incantation:\n\n*August Lord of Jade Dawn, Lord of Primordial Radiance of the Great Ultimate, I beg forgiveness for all yin transgressions and yang offenses I have committed since my first year, extending to the heavy faults of my seven generations of ancestors, all bound in the Three Yin. May they be released and dissolved, my sinful name erased, the roots of death sealed, my karmic bonds severed by the Northern Emperor, my name recorded in the Jade Register of Eastern Florescence, and my seven generations of ancestors ascend together to the Imperial Dawn.*\n\nThen visualize the True August Lord of the Chen Star in the eastern direction, clad in a cloud-brocade skirt adorned with dragon patterns, a tiger tally at his waist, a coronet of yellow jade upon his head, riding a jade chariot of azure mist. Accompanied by twelve immortal officials, he descends from the east to cover your body. His radiance is lush and resplendent, illuminating the eastern direction. Look up and recite the incantation:\n\n*True Lord of the East, flowing radiance of the Nine Gates, your light shines within and without, crowning and covering my body. I beg that you intercede with the Northern Emperor to sever my roots of death, deliver my jade name, and allow me to ascend as an inner immortal of Eastern Florescence. May I forever depart the path of death, my seven generations of ancestors all enjoying blessings, growing with the moon, aging with the sun, riding the void and floating in space, ascending in flying steps.*\n\nThen swallow qi nine times and cease. Face south, bow twice, and knock the teeth three times. Visualize and recite the incantation:\n\n*Lords of the Three Primordials of Highest Purity, August Lord of the Upper Primordial of the Southern Culmen, Jade Worthy Lord of the Nine Qi of the Great Yang, I beg forgiveness for all my conscious transgressions since birth—primordial evil and impiety, treason and unrighteousness, lewdness and theft, yin sins and yang offenses—extending to the karmic bonds of my seven generations of ancestors, their names recorded in the Great Yin, their sins bound to the Northern Star. May they be released, the records of the Three Officials erased, the roots of deathly qi severed, passing through the northeastern gate and ascending to the southwestern barrier. May my seven generations of ancestors all receive imperial grace.*\n\nThen visualize the True August Lord of the Sparkling Deluder Star in the southern direction, clad in a cloud-frost skirt adorned with phoenix patterns and dragon bells, a tiger tally at his waist, a coronet of dark dawn upon his head, wearing a flying robe of azure brocade, riding a crimson chariot of cinnabar mist. Accompanied by twelve immortal officials, he descends from the south to cover your body. His radiance blazes like the rising sun. Look up and recite the incantation:\n\n*True August Lord of the South, flowing light of the dark constellation, circling the Three Gates, ascending in a cinnabar chariot to the Seven Primordials, your inner radiance shining brilliantly, crowning my body. For me, erase the Northern Emperor’s sinful records, untie knots and dissolve stagnation, dispel the Great Yin. May my body depart the ghostly gate, the roots of karmic bonds severed, ascending through the Celestial Barrier to enter the Southern Terrace. May my seven generations of ancestors together meet before the Emperor.*\n\nThen swallow qi eight times and cease. Face west, bow twice, and knock the teeth three times. Visualize and recite the incantation:\n\n*Lords of the Three Primordials of the Great Simplicity, Four Elders of the Dao’s Center, I beg forgiveness for all transgressions committed since gaining consciousness—(for women: jealousy of the virtuous), belittling the worthy, carelessly revealing scriptures, treading filth and defiling purity, polluting the Three Luminaries, swearing oaths and shedding sorrowful tears, offending the August Lords. May the karmic bonds recorded in the Great Yin, the sins bound to the ghostly officials, be released and dissolved, the roots of judgment severed, the path of death blocked, my name delivered through the Gate of Life. May my seven generations of ancestors ascend to the Northern Hall.*\n\nThen visualize the True August Lord of the Great White Star in the western direction, clad in a luminous brocade skirt adorned with flowing bells, a tiger tally at his waist, a coronet of supporting dawn upon his head, riding a chariot of white mist. Accompanied by twelve immortal officials, he descends from the west to cover your body. His light is penetrating and brilliant, illuminating the western direction. Look up and recite the incantation:\n\n*True August Lord of the West, white radiance of the dark standard, ascending in a jade chariot, white splendor filling the heavens, returning at dawn to descend, your true form revealed. For me, turn the Nine Gates, deliver my body to the imperial court. May I depart the records of the Great Yin, ascend to the Dark Palace in shared song, my life spanning heaven and earth, enduring for countless eons. May my seven generations of ancestors together ascend to the dawn of the immortals.*\n\nThen swallow qi six times and cease. Face the center, bow twice, and knock the teeth three times. Visualize and recite the incantation:\n\n*Highest Great August Lord, Jade Emperor, I beg forgiveness for all transgressions and offenses I have committed from birth to this day—innumerable sins and faults—extending to the unresolved karmic bonds of my seven generations of ancestors, all bound in the Great Yin. May they all be dissolved and released, the dark name of the Northern Emperor erased, the roots of deathly qi in the Ghostly Gate of Gui Earth severed, my name delivered through the Celestial Barrier, passing through the Five Dawns. May my seven generations of ancestors all be reborn as immortals.*\n\nThen visualize the True August Lord of the Quelling Star in the central direction, clad in a yellow cloud-brocade skirt adorned with dragon and tiger patterns, a golden tally at his waist, a purple coronet upon his head, driving a chariot of yellow mist. Accompanied by twelve immortal officials, he descends from the center to crown and cover your body. His light is penetrating and brilliant, illuminating the Central Primordial. Look up and recite the incantation:\n\n*True August Lord of the Quelling Star of the Center, Sovereign of the Five Emperors, turning the dark net, ascending in a yellow chariot to traverse the four directions. For me, sever the roots of death, deliver my name to the Southern Yang Palace, transform the Five into the Six, soaring with me in shared flight, transforming through ten thousand streams, enjoying boundless life. Ascend to the Great Ultimate, the Golden Gates and Jade Halls. May my seven generations of ancestors together share in prosperity.*\n\nThen swallow qi twelve times and cease. The five repentances are offered to the Five Emperors, visualizing the Five Dawns to deliver life. The ritual concludes here.\n\nIf one practices this without fail on the appointed days, after seven years the Five Dawn True August Lords will be moved to respond, manifesting their forms in your bedchamber. The Supreme Thearch will personally dispatch five Jade Maidens from the Five Directions to guard your body, and the Northern Thearch of Great Yin will come to pay homage at your gate, no longer daring to bind you with your transgressions. Those who study immortality and seek the True should diligently practice this.\n\nThe method of repentance for seeking immortality is the technique taught by the High Minister Azure Lad to petition the Sacred Lord of the Golden Gates, established as a precept for later learners who seek life—it is not the repentance of the Supreme Thearch himself. When performing this practice, the August Lord also observes your heart. If past transgressions remain unresolved, the palaces of the Six Heavens will not strike your name from the register of death, nor will the Gate of Opening and Closing permit your body to pass through. Thus, the Merging and Converging Repository is the source that fills death, while the Gate of Opening and Closing is the office that delivers life. Only through earnest seeking can one attain the True.\n\n**The August Lord’s Inner Illumination with the Bright Lamp: Supreme Method for Seeking Immortality**\n*Transmitted by the Southern Culmen Supreme Primordial Lord*\n\nThe August Lord constantly dwells in the Tower of Radiant Mystery, within golden chambers and purple doors. He illumines himself with the Bright Mystery Lamp, suffusing the eight windows with rosy light. He contemplates the Supreme Perfected within the Five Forms and unfolds the Three Vows in the August Chamber. The numinous descends beneath a purple canopy, and the Primordial August Lord assigns him golden lads. Naturally, he is titled an August Lord, governing the Mysterious Palace. The Supreme Grade arises from the wondrous inception; the Dao resides in the faintest glimmer. Now I impart this to you—practice it diligently.\n\nThe Southern Culmen Supreme Primordial Lord declared: \"You who study the Way of Divine Perfection, abiding above the Numinous Palace within the Jade Chamber—if you do not know how to illumine yourself with the Bright Lamp and suffuse the Mysterious Light within the Five Viscera, you will not attain clarity. The spirits of the bodily form will not find their return. If you can light the Bright Lamp at your Original Destiny in the evening and at your Active Year in the morning, and keep a Bright Lamp constantly at the Grand Year, making vows in these three places, your body will become serene and your qi upright. The True Light will shine brightly, and the myriad spirits will be radiant and pure.\n\nIf the Primordial Lord receives and practices this method for three years, twenty-four Night-Light Lads will arrive, and the Mysterious Light will naturally become bright—no Bright Lamp will be needed to transmit the light. Yet this wondrous method of the Supreme Perfected and the Pure is not transmitted to the lower world. Only those with golden names, jade characters, and a mysterious register may receive this Dao. Practicing it for nine years, your body will become luminous, seeing clearly for ten thousand miles. The Mysterious Vision will arise naturally, and the Night-Light Lads will descend to your chamber, bestowing upon you the True Writ. You will ascend in broad daylight to the Dawn.\n\nConstantly keep the Bright Lamp in a quiet chamber at your Original Destiny. In the evening, enter the chamber, face the lamp, and kneel in prostration. Strike the teeth twelve times and recite the incantation:\n\n*The Mysterious Light illumines the Great Yin,\nEight paths radiant and bright.\nSerene in spirit within the secluded chamber,\nGazing upward to leap into the Supreme Clarity.\nFive glories emanate from the Mysterious Terrace,\nJade mushrooms grow naturally.\nPenetrating illumination reaches the Supreme Perfected,\nThe myriad spirits observe my form.\nEradicating the qi of the Nine Yin,\nInscribing my name in the Eastern Florescence.\nPreserving me without end,\nForever paralleling the sun and moon.\nDelivering me from the Seven Dark Perils,\nReceiving further glory in the Southern Palace.\nThe Bright Light awakens the Jade Thearch,\nAscending to receive the Inner Illumination Scripture.\nHeaven sends the Flying Rosy Chariot,\nSoaring through the sky in a green carriage.\nI attain audience in the Thearch’s hall,\nAdvancing to bow in the Jade Thearch’s court.*\n\nWhen finished, bow twice, face your Original Destiny, raise your head, and swallow saliva seven times.\n\nAlso, constantly keep the Bright Lamp at your Active Year. In the morning, face the lamp, strike the teeth twelve times, and recite the incantation:\n\n*The Bright Lamp illumines my Active Year,\nScattering light that shines in the eight directions.\nInfant-like, the colors and images become serene,\nInner vision radiant, empty and unified.\nUnfastening the luminous sash of the spirit,\nI commune with the Jade Perfected.\nGazing upward to the lofty and supreme Dao,\nVast and distant, without form or trace.\nI yearn for the descent of the Mysterious Cloud,\nTo rein in the flying dragons.\nReversing my hundred-year span,\nReturning to an infant’s countenance.\nBestowing upon me the Maiden of the Western Florescence,\nAssigning me the Golden Dawn Lad.\nAttending to incense and treading upon my years,\nBowing my head in the Jade Thearch’s chamber.\nSpirits at peace, the Dao flows smoothly,\nFear dispelled amidst the fragrant smoke.\nComposing my heart to abide in the Supreme Mystery,\nEarnestly moved by the cavernous void.\nThe chamber summons the descent of Divine Rosy Clouds,\nClosing my eyes to gaze upon the Immortal Lords.\nDelivering my seven generations of ancestors from peril,\nTransforming my form to return to the Southern Palace.*\n\nWhen finished, bow twice, face east, and swallow qi fourteen times.\n\nConstantly keep the Bright Lamp at the Grand Year to commune with the spirits and fulfill vows in seeking the True. After three years, the Mysterious Light will inwardly crystallize, and the Divine Perfected will descend, bestowing upon you the method of immortality. At that time, there will naturally be a response. Morning and evening, burn incense, strike the teeth twelve times, face the lamp, and recite the incantation:\n\n*The lamp’s flame illumines the Supreme Perfected,\nBright light penetrating the Mysterious Void.\nUnfolding the supreme and lofty Dao,\nMy heart fixed upon the Jade Thearch’s abode.\nPenetrating the empty and cavernous within,\nThe spirit’s vision expands the body’s ease.\nAccumulated sincerity draws the numinous descent,\nA tranquil heart governs the hidden dwelling.\nMorning rites in the Thearch’s hall,\nEvening recitations of the True Writ.\nCarefree within the Mysterious Capital,\nFor ten thousand years reverting to infancy.\nA heavenly crown of purple rosy clouds,\nThe Thearch assigns six jade chariots.\nWandering atop the Five Peaks,\nContentment found wherever I go.\nSeven generations of ancestors escape the Three Wretched Paths,\nBlessings and felicity overflowing.*\n\nWhen finished, bow twice and swallow qi fourteen times.\n\nIf you can constantly keep the Bright Lamps lit in these three places without extinguishing them, your seven generations of ancestors will immediately escape the Ten Sufferings, ascending to the Southern Culmen. Your body’s spirits will become serene and upright, your eyes seeing for ten thousand miles, your ears hearing distant sounds, and your heart’s wisdom foreseeing the yet-unrealized. The Divine Perfected will descend, and the Night-Light Lads will teach you the Way of seeking immortality. After nine years of this, the numinous light will naturally become bright, penetrating within and without.\n\nThe Five Dawns repent their transgressions before the Five Emperors, visualizing the Five Dawns to deliver life. The practice concludes here.\n\n**The August Lord’s Five Vows: Supreme Method for Seeking Immortality**\n\nThe August Lord constantly observes the ninth day of the ninth month, the fifth day of the tenth month, the third day of the third month, the eighth day of the fourth month, and the seventh day of the seventh month—these are the times of the Five Vows and Ten Assemblies. Ascending to the Great Ultimate’s Jade Terrace, within the lofty Jade Hall and golden chambers, he visualizes the Five Vows in the Jade Palace, yearning for the descent of the Mysterious Perfected. The Void and Nothingness open with jade missives, golden tones resounding through the Great Emptiness. He summons the Five Emperors to guard the numinous, celebrating the myriad assemblies in the Cinnabar Chamber.\n\nThus, through sincere devotion, the Perfected are summoned, and the Perfected, moved by such devotion, descend. On these days, one must bathe in purity and fast, enter the chamber to burn incense, bow in reverence to the four directions, then sit upright facing east—for east is the direction of the dawning radiance. Knock the teeth thirty-six times in succession.\n\nThe First Vow: May the qi of my birth be natural, coalescing within it to form my body, my body equal in rank to the Three Luminaries, eternally rooted in the boundless.\nThe Second Vow: May my body ever dwell above the Great Void, within the Jade Palace and chambers of jade, feasting with the Jade Emperor by day and abiding with the Mysterious Mother by night; when thirsty, sipping from the Wave-Well’s vast spring and jade mushrooms, when hungry, partaking of dragon embryos, jade-rich fat, crimson trees, and red infants.\nThe Third Vow: May my body generate ten thousand auspicious signs and seventy-two rays of light, with rare hairs and extraordinary bones, clad in feathered robes, riding the void and driving through the sky, entering and exiting the imperial palace, with all blessings converging, and boundless longevity.\nThe Fourth Vow: May I be born with the formless and die with the formless, dying yet living again, reborn as a Perfected Sovereign, governing the Ten Heavens and leading the host of immortals.\nThe Fifth Vow: May all sentient beings, born or yet unborn, together preserve the Three Luminaries of sun and moon; may those of the Dao and the Seven Mysteries’ ancestors ascend to the Southern Palace, and may the world’s blessings be without exception fulfilled.\n\nThe vows of the four directions and the Five Vows converge in the Jade Hall.\n\nNext, the supreme vow: May the Nine Mysteries nurture my body, my hun and po souls and true spirits ever dwell within my palace, ascending to commune with the celestial immortals, descending to reach the abyssal depths. May the vows to Heaven, Earth, Wind, Spirits, and Immortals unite as one, inscribing my name in the register of eternal life. May purple mists descend from Heaven, and may the Five Numinous Ones guard the earth. Riding clouds and driving through the void, ascending in a jade-green chariot, I shall reach the Golden Gate and ascend to the Jade Purity, extending blessings to my seven ancestors, who shall be reborn anew. The Five Vows merge into five unions, eternally enjoying prosperity and harmony.\n\nThe Middle Vows, also five in number, seek the root of attaining the Dao: the Vow of Yin, the Vow of Yang, the Vow of the Great Void, the Vow of the Great Nothingness, and the Vow of the Great Mystery. Feasting in the Jade Chambers with the Emperor, bound by karmic affinity, gazing upon the gates of life, traversing the Nine Heavens. The Primordial Father inscribes my name, the Mysterious Mother records my years. Peaches of immortality and radiance coalesce, securing the Cinnabar Field. My body ascends to the Golden Gate, my name inscribed in the Jade Register. My seven ancestors are liberated, and blessings converge.\n\nThe Lower Vows, also five in number: the Vow of the Great Void, the Vow of the Great Existence, the Vow of the Supreme, the Vow of the Great Perfected, and the Vow of the Divine Immortals. May I traverse the peaks of the Five Marchmounts, drift among the Nine Skies, enter and exit the gates of opening, and transcend the portals of death. May Heaven and Earth be my parents, the Three Luminaries guard me for ten thousand years. May spirits guard the nine apertures of my body, and numinous qi descend naturally. The Five Vows of the eight directions converge in resonance.\n\nWhen the Five Vows are complete, knock the teeth fourteen times and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Supreme Emperor of the Upper Origin, the Emperor’s Unity and Mysterious Canon, five clouds scatter radiance, luxuriant in the Three Purities. Jade lads and jade maidens burn incense and attend the numinous. The supreme vows are declared, uniting with my form, making me a divine immortal, ascending to the imperial court. The Northern Emperor severs death, the Southern Dipper inscribes life. In the Eastern Flower’s Golden Pavilion, my name is recorded. Boundless vows align with mine.\"*\n\nWhen the incantation is finished, knock the teeth twenty-one times more, then tilt the head back and swallow qi five times before ceasing.\n\nThis is the August Lord’s method of declaring the supreme vows to unite with the numinous in form. Those who practice thus shall be attended by jade blossoms and guarded by jade lads who scatter incense, their devotion ascending to the Nine Heavens, moving the Emperor to respond. After five years of such practice, the Dao shall naturally descend. Throughout the world’s ten directions, wherever there are vows of the Dao, the Dao shall not fail to descend in response. When reciting the vows, the mind and intent must be singular, without stray thoughts or external distractions. If the true spirits scatter, the vows shall not descend. If one treads in defilement or impurity, the Perfected shall remain distant.\n\nHere concludes the August Lord’s method of the Five Vows and Ten Assemblies.\n\nOn each of these days, if one can recite the vows with focused sincerity and proper method, the Emperor shall dispatch jade lads to guard one’s body, summoning the vows of the five directions and the Dao of divine immortality to descend upon one’s form. After five years of such practice, one shall ride flying clouds to ascend the Nine Heavens, with one’s name recorded in the Eastern Flower. One’s seven ancestors and parents shall also receive blessings, escape the Three Wretched Paths, and be reborn in the Southern Palace of the Immortals.\n\nThe Supreme Lord of the Upper Origin of the Southern Culmen states: Those who study in the world know only to seek in the morning and expect results by evening, to utter a single vow and hope for a response, to recite an incantation and await its fulfillment. Yet they do not realize that ascending the peaks of Mount Qi begins with the first step on the mountain path; a tree of a thousand feet grows from a tender shoot. The Dao is lofty and the Perfected are wondrous—how can one set foot and expect to climb the cloud ladder at once? Even the August Lord, who received the qi and governed the Perfected, still relied on the bright lamp to commune with the numinous, and the Five Vows to invoke blessings. How could one not encompass the natural?\n\nThe path of seeking immortality must begin with vows before seeking, for vows move the numinous to respond. The greatness of the Five Vows encompasses all, their blessings covering all, their felicity flowing without end—truly, they touch upon all that is good. If one’s heart is sincere in the vows, there shall be no vow that does not resonate in response. May those who come after with devotion take heed.\n\nThe Most Exalted Azure Lad states: In my past studies, I traversed seven hundred years, scaling perilous peaks, crossing east and west, journeying south and north, roaming the central plains. I studied under thirty-two masters and received over three hundred teachings, yet I had not ascended to the Golden Gate to receive the sacred texts and purple writings from the Saintly Lord—the Dao of ingesting the yellow essence of sun and moon to restrain the hun and po souls, of coalescing radiance and luminous instruments, of the Nine Perfected and Eight Paths to dissolve form and escape transformation, of the Purple Passage, scorching light, flowing gold, and fire bells, of exhaling and inhaling flying clouds, treading the void, and stepping upon the Seven Primordials’ precious canon. The Saintly Lord, by the Seven Stars’ translocation—a treasure of the Supreme Emperor—swore an oath and transmitted it to me, enabling me to sever the deathly names of the Six Palaces, seal the ghostly gate of the northeast, and open the Heavenly Pass to translocate my body. Only then could I ascend to serve the Three Origins, attaining the office of Most Exalted Minister, governing the host of immortals. The Seven Stars blazed in the heavens, revolving the essence of the Nine Origins. Above, I rode the qi of the Three Origins; below, I governed the names of the Six Heavens. Life and death, separation and union—none were beyond the Seven Stars.\n\nThus, when the Dipper’s influence falls upon a person, they die; when the Dipper shifts, they live. Therefore, the Seven Stars serve as the celestial ministers, and the Heavenly Pass is the treasury of life-translocation. Those who study yet do not sever the ghostly gate in the northeast or translocate the life-mark to the Southern Pass—how can their lives be preserved?\n\nThe Supreme Emperor concealed this scripture within the chambers of the Six Directions, commanding the Jade Maiden of Western Florescence, the Golden Dawn Jade Youths—three hundred in number—to guard its sacred text. Later, it was transmitted to the host of perfected beings and emerged within the renowned mountains. The Lord of Western City, afterward, discovered this text within the stone chamber of Mount Wangwu. The Lord then retreated to purify himself for three months, bearing tokens of faith to ascend the mountain, where he received, unfolded, and perused it. Through the Seven Stars’ translocation and the cultivation of its Way, he attained the rank of Perfected.\n\nSince the time when those without jade names achieved immortality, none have heard or beheld this Way. For the child who possesses this scripture, the Six Palaces of Fengdu will record their name and translocate them to the Southern Pass—how much more so for those who cultivate its practice?\n\nThe Lord of Western City stated: This original text comprised three scrolls—*The Heavenly Pass* and *The Heavenly Diagram*—which do not circulate in the world. The Lady of Southern Marchmount received only this single scroll, *The Seven Stars’ Translocation*. Here ends the lower scroll of *The Wondrous Perfection of Highest Clarity: The Three Heaven-Opening Diagrams and the Seven Stars’ Translocation*.",

      "translated_text": "**The Wondrous Perfection Highest Clarity Scripture of the Three Celestial Diagrams and the Seven Stars’ Transference of Destiny**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Wondrous Perfection Highest Clarity Scripture of the Heavenly Pass, Three Diagrams, and the Seven Stars’ Transference of Destiny*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin dynasty. A foundational scripture of the early Highest Clarity tradition. Originally one scroll, later divided into two. Source text: *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\n---\n\n**The Wondrous Perfection Highest Clarity Scripture of the Three Celestial Diagrams and the Seven Stars’ Transference of Destiny, Volume One**\n\n**The Supreme Method for Transcending Death, Preserving Life, and Securing Immortality**\n\nThe Heavenly Pass is the Gate of Life of the Nine Heavens, governing the southeast corner of the Nine Heavens. It is also called the Celestial Diagram or the Heavenly Pass, hence the Three Passes. It is the path traversed by the host of perfected beings, the course tread by divine immortals, and the way by which scholars ascend. It lies five thousand *li* from the Golden Portal and seven thousand *li* from the Upper Palace of Jade Clarity. Once one has passed through the Three Passes, one may ascend to the Golden Portal and wander in the feasts of Jade Clarity.\n\nThe First Heavenly Pass stands atop a nine-tiered jade terrace, rising twelve hundred *zhang* above the earth. Below, thousands of long serpents, flying dragons, and venomous beasts guard the Jade Pass, while three thousand mighty warriors, clad in interlocking golden armor, stand vigil at the gates. The Jade Dawn Overseer of the Great Void, whose name is Void Supreme Clarity, resides upon the jade terrace. Flying clouds and flowing auroras flank his chamber, while the mysterious radiance of sun and moon illumines Jade Clarity. Three hundred perfected immortals attend him, presiding over the entry and exit of ascending immortals and the opening of the pass.\n\nThe Second Heavenly Pass stands atop a six-tiered jade terrace, nine hundred *zhang* in height. Below, thousands of long serpents, flying dragons, and venomous beasts guard the Jade Pass, while three thousand mighty warriors, clad in interlocking golden armor, stand guard at either side of the gate. The Supreme Overseer of Perfected Jade, whose name is Bright Elder, is enthroned upon the jade terrace. Crimson clouds and purple canopies shroud his chamber, while the mysterious light of sun and moon shines between them. Three hundred perfected immortals attend him, overseeing the passage of the host of perfected beings as they wander and feast.\n\nThe Third Heavenly Pass stands atop a three-tiered jade terrace, six hundred *zhang* in height. Below, thousands of long serpents, flying dragons, and venomous beasts guard the Jade Pass, while three thousand mighty warriors, clad in interlocking golden armor, stand guard at either side. The Supreme Emperor’s Overseer of Perfected Jade, whose name is Heavenly Eternal Life, is enthroned upon the jade terrace. Dark clouds veil its summit, while ethereal mists perfume its courtyard. A light of self-illumination gleams upon his form. Three hundred perfected immortals attend him, presiding over the celestial host of perfected beings, the earthly multitude of living beings, and the registers and records that govern their passage.\n\nThose who receive the Dao of inscribing their names upon golden tablets and jade slips must cultivate the method of passing through the Heavenly Pass. At dawn and dusk, one should enter the chamber, burn incense, and strike the teeth twelve times. Facing east, bow in reverence to the four directions, and visualize the boundary of the Nine Heavens, clearly perceiving the Three Passes below in vivid detail. When the vision is complete, next visualize the Seven Stars above the heavens, revolving with the celestial motion. Envision your body upon the stars of the Heavenly Pass, the Seven Stars carrying you to the base of the jade terrace of the Heavenly Pass. There, present a jade slip and announce your name to the Jade Dawn Overseer of the Great Void. See the overseer inscribe your name upon the jade register, permitting your passage to the base of the Heavenly Pass.\n\nNext, visualize your body returning to the Seven Stars, which carry you to the base of the jade terrace of the Heavenly Pass. Present another jade slip and announce your name before the Supreme Overseer of Perfected Jade. See the overseer inscribe your name upon the jade register, permitting your passage to the base of the Heavenly Pass.\n\nThen, visualize your body returning once more to the Seven Stars, which carry you to the base of the jade terrace of the Heavenly Pass. Present another jade slip and announce your name before the Supreme Emperor’s Overseer of Perfected Jade. See the overseer inscribe your name upon the jade register, permitting your passage to the Golden Portal beneath the Palace of Jade Clarity.\n\nNext, visualize the Seven Stars receding, your body suspended in the Void of Emptiness, adrift in the primordial chaos, with nothing to rely upon or perceive. After a moment, you will find yourself above the Golden Gate of the Golden Portal and Jade Capital. Present a golden slip, and see the Four Pole Perfected Ones receive it upon a jade table, entering to announce it before the Lord Emperor of the Golden Portal. The Four Pole Perfected Ones will report and ascend with you to the summit of Jade Clarity.\n\nNext, visualize the summit of Jade Clarity, where the Four Poles stretch boundlessly, with only verdant *qi* billowing thickly. Above, there is no heaven; below, no earth. Only at the center do four golden gates open in all directions, within which stand palaces of jasper and jade trees, golden branches flourishing on either side. Mighty dragons and beasts roam and play upon their peaks. Envision yourself wandering among them for a long while, until you feel as though awakening from sleep, your body returning to its resting state. Within, you will feel a vague, ethereal sensation, as though treading upon emptiness. When the vision of your journey is complete, strike the teeth sixteen times and recite the incantation while gazing upward:\n\n*\"The Three Flowers’ precious radiance,\nThe Jade Capital opens in clarity.\nMysterious splendor unfolds,\nIllumining the formless overseer.\nGolden tablets record the script,\nInscribing names upon jade.\nBrightly beholding the Nine Heavens,\nAscending to sport in the Three Clarities.\nThe Three Diagrams of the Heavenly Pass,\nReturning to ascend the Purple Court.\nReceiving titles in the Golden Portal,\nEastern Florescence records life.\nAttaining the Eight Effulgences,\nDriving the flying plow.\"*\n\nWhen finished, swallow the *qi* nine times and cease.\n\nThose who study the Dao yet do not know the method of passing through the Heavenly Pass or the way of presenting tablets and inscribing names will never achieve success. The Three Passes govern all the heavens and earths, the flying immortals, and the registers of beginning scholars—none may bypass the Three Passes.\n\nIf a diligent student of the Dao can ensure their jade name is recorded in the Nine Heavens and the Three Passes, and that the Jade Dawn of the Three Passes presents it to the Palace of the Supreme and the Supreme Emperor, then the Lord Emperor will dispatch twelve jade lads and twelve jade maidens to attend and protect them.\n\nThis is the Supreme Emperor’s Upper Scripture, transmitted to the Lord Emperor of Heaven. The Lord Emperor of Heaven transmitted it to the Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Pole, who transmitted it to the Lord Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity. The Lord Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity transmitted it to the Lord Emperor of the Golden Portal, who entrusted it to the Prime Minister, the Azure Lad, to teach future scholars destined to become perfected beings.",

      "translated_text": "According to the Mysterious Statutes, this may be transmitted thrice within seven hundred years. The Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Pole commands ninety Western Florescence Jade Maidens to guard within the Southern Pole’s Purple Chamber.\n\nThe Azure Lad states: Those whose bone and countenance accord with the Mysterious may behold this Dao, learn the method of submitting memorial tablets, and thereby become perfected beings. Yet the statutes are exceedingly weighty—this must not be lightly divulged. Among the multitudes of scholars, how few encounter the true! Thus the Central Yellow and Old Lord declared: One who beholds the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Perfected Scripture* shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight. Yet some who cultivate it for years achieve no success and claim the scripture is not true. This is solely because their names are not recorded on the Golden Tablet in the Eastern Florescence or the Jade Slip in the Golden Portal; the true spirits do not descend for them, and they are instead assailed by celestial demons, resulting in no response. Though they may obtain myriad divine scriptures, they will still not succeed.\n\nIf one first submits a Golden Tablet to the Azure Palace and presents a Jade Slip to the Imperial Sovereign, receiving the attendance of the Golden Dawn Jade Lads and Western Florescence Jade Maidens to guard the numinous text, and if this is proclaimed throughout the heavens and earth, with the Three Realms extolling its virtue and chanting its verses ten thousand times—how could one fail to evoke the response of jade chariots and purple carriages?\n\n**Memorial for Submitting Jade Slips at the Three Passes of Heaven**\nPresented at the Jade Terrace of the Heavenly Pass, beneath the supervision of the Great Void Jade Dawn Inspector:\n[Name], of [prefecture, county, village], male/female, born in the year of [zodiac], aged [years], born in the [month], styled [courtesy name].\n\nPresented at the Jade Terrace of the Heavenly Chart, beneath the supervision of the Supreme Perfected Jade Gentleman Inspector:\n[Name], of [prefecture, county, village], male/female, born in the year of [zodiac], aged [years], born in the [month], styled [courtesy name].\n\nPresented at the Jade Terrace of the Heavenly Pass, beneath the supervision of the Supreme Emperor’s Perfected Jade Controller:\n[Name], of [prefecture, county, village], male/female, born in the year of [zodiac], aged [years], born in the [month], styled [courtesy name].\n\nThe above three Jade Slips shall each be one foot and six inches in length.\n\n**Memorial for Submitting a Jade Slip at the Golden Pass**\nPresented before the Golden Portal Emperor Lord:\n[Name], of [prefecture, county, village], male/female, born in the year of [zodiac], aged [years], born in the [month], styled [courtesy name].\n\nThe above Jade Slip shall be one foot and six inches in length.\n\nThe Azure Lad states: If one lacks a Golden Tablet, silver or wood may suffice; if one lacks a Jade Slip, paulownia wood may suffice—so long as it is refined and flawless, with unbroken grain.\n\nThe Azure Lad further states: When submitting the Jade Slips at the Heavenly Pass, Heavenly Chart, and Heavenly Pass, ascend the path to the Azure Palace and the Golden Portal of the Jade Clarity. Write the Jade Slip in azure ink, first enter the chamber and strike the teeth twelve times, then face east to read the slip. After completing the visualization practice, place the slip in a cloud-brocade pouch, burn incense beside it, and never expose it lightly. This is the supreme title of the highest perfected beings, the numinous scripture of the Jade Emperor.\n\nIf one’s golden name and jade characters are inscribed in reverse in the Azure Palace and one obtains this Dao, one must follow the statutes of the Supreme Perfected: prepare one Golden Tablet and one Jade Slip, each one foot and two inches long, two inches and four parts wide, along with one golden fish and one jade dragon. Offer one hundred feet of purple silk and thirty feet of azure damask as the covenant of the Supreme Perfected, presenting them to one’s scripture-holding master. The master faces east, the recipient faces north, and they swear an oath before the Northern Emperor and their seven ancestors, pledging not to divulge the secret. According to the Mysterious Statutes, this may be transmitted thrice within seven hundred years. If transmitted to an unworthy recipient, the seven mysteries and nine ancestors shall be eternally consigned to ghostly servitude, their bodies perishing in the Nine Springs, never to attain immortality.\n\nDevoted scholars and those who aspire to immortality must adhere to the statutes and cultivate in accordance with the text. This precious scripture is treasured by the Supreme Emperor Lord, who transmitted it to the Heavenly Emperor Lord. The Heavenly Emperor Lord transmitted it to the Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Pole, who transmitted it to the Supreme Emperor Lord of the Supreme Tenuity. The Supreme Emperor Lord of the Supreme Tenuity transmitted it to the Sage Lord of the Golden Portal, who entrusted it to the Prime Minister, the Azure Lad, to teach those destined to become immortals. Thus, it is transmitted once every seven hundred years. The Supreme Primordial Lord commands thirty-six Western Florescence Jade Maidens to safeguard the numinous text within the Southern Pole’s Purple Chamber.\n\nThe Heavenly Emperor Lord states: This scripture governs the writings of the Nine Heavens and the hidden texts of the Eight Assemblies, surpassing all other Daoist teachings and excelling beyond the jade scriptures. Thus, the Central Yellow and Old Lord concealed the *Thirty-Nine Chapters*, and the Supreme Emperor Lord treasured the *Seven Primes’ Transference*. Though the Three Vehicles each display their wonders, their practical application does not align.\n\nPerfected beings merely know how to tread the celestial net and gaze upward at the Five Dawns, swallowing qi and imbibing mist, chewing the solar root, absorbing the mysterious infusion of flowing essence, and returning to vast whiteness to prolong their years. Yet they do not comprehend the transference of the Seven Stars, the opening and closing of the Heavenly Pass, the revolving of the Nine Qi for self-contemplation, or the preservation of the Seven Essences in the Muddy Pellet. Those who practice this Dao shall ride upon clouds of emerald carriages, and thus the Supreme Emperor is honored as the utmost in supremacy.\n\nThe Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Pole states: From refining and gathering the Mysterious Radiance, exhaling and inhaling the flowing mist, consolidating the hun and po, securing essence and preserving spirit, to wielding the Purple Transcendence and the Scorching Radiance, ringing the Golden Fire Bell, binding the luminous brilliance and galloping to the moon, commanding ten thousand transformations of the solar effulgence, the Nine Perfected and Eight Daoists donning the solar and lunar imperial splendor, wearing jade pendants and golden girdles, and visualizing the true forms of the Two Effulgences—such practices number over three hundred. Yet even if one causes the Mysterious Radiance to ascend and infuse, reposing in the numinous palace, one has still not received the transference of the Seven Stars, the pivotal mechanism of heaven, nor traversed the Twenty-Eight Constellations, revolved the two luminaries of sun and moon, drawn from the Five Dawns for combined use, or resolved the union and separation in the bedchamber. Then the heavens shall descend purple mist, and the Emperor shall dispatch the Golden Dawn Lads.\n\nIf one can endure hardship, accumulate devotion, and resonate with the Mysterious Palace, within seven years one may ride the emerald shafts of the Three Pure Ones’ flying carriage, ascending to the Imperial Dawn—truly subtle and wondrous, an unfathomable transformation!\n\nThe Supreme Emperor Lord of the Supreme Tenuity states: Perfected beings merely know how to tread the celestial net and traverse the Seven Primes, yet they do not comprehend the transference of the Seven Stars or the opening of the Heavenly Pass. They do not revolve the Dipper’s net to shield the body, nor circulate the Seven Degrees to ensure longevity. They do not depart from the northeastern \"Gate of Death\" nor unite with the southwestern \"Gate of Life.\" Practicing this for fourteen years, one shall evoke the descent of the jade chariot and the flying carriage of cinnabar mist, ascending in broad daylight to the Golden Portal’s palace.",

      "translated_text": "The Golden Portal Sage Lord states: The Dao of the Heavenly Pass is easy to unfold yet difficult to comprehend; the transference of the Seven Primes is hard to perceive yet easy to practice. The separation and union of the Two Symbols are the source of life and death. Humans receive qi and possess thirteen modes of life; when fate reaches its end, they return to thirteen modes of death. Thus, the Heavenly Pass serves as the pivot of separation and union, while the Seven Primes are the root of life and death. Those who cultivate lofty practices and seek immortality with sincere devotion, yet do not know how to seal the death-qi at the Ghost Gate, transfer the life-qi through the Human Gate, revolve the Seven Stars to the northeast, or unfold the Heavenly Pass to the southwest, shall not escape mortality—attaining Perfection will be exceedingly difficult. If one bears a golden name in the Eastern Florescence and a jade title in the Upper Clarity, having beheld this Dao, then the root of deathlessness shall be established. Practicing this for seven years, one shall hold the rank of a named immortal, ascend in a flying carriage of emerald shafts, the body of a cinnabar youth, and mount the Mysterious Palace.\n\nThe Most Exalted Minister, the Azure Lad Lord, states: The turning mechanism revolves through Heaven and Earth, the Mysterious Dipper governs the Eight Gates, its flowing radiance illumines the Nine Empyreans, the celestial might shakes the Ten Directions. The celestial patterns are arrayed upon the Heavenly Chart, life and death are encompassed within the Seven Primes. The Five Separations are firmly established to suppress death, while the Six Harmonies are gathered for self-protection. If one can ride the High Perfected to seek deliverance, seal the Ghost Gate at the Heavenly Pass, ingest the Nine Essences to inwardly illuminate, and visualize the Mysterious Dipper’s subtle glow, one shall summon the flying carriage of cinnabar mist and the clouds of the Three Pure Ones, soaring through the void to ascend to the Empyrean Dawn. Those who cultivate the Dao of transposing the Seven Stars shall summon the Nine Lords of the Jade Emperor; with the inner illumination of Mysterious Essence, they sever the root of death. One must dwell in a secluded chamber with a tranquil mind, undisturbed by worldly dust, standing alone to face the light, gazing upon the Empyrean Dawn. Burn incense to left and right, diffuse mist in the courtyard of rosy clouds, concentrate the mind with earnest devotion, and remain awake on this day. After seven years of such practice, the jade carriage with its flying canopy and cinnabar shafts shall descend to welcome the adept’s body, ascending through the Heavenly Pass to seal the path of death in the northeast and inscribe the immortal’s name in the Southern Transcendence—this is the Dao most difficult to attain, yet the Perfected most readily descend.\n\nThose who possess a golden register and jade name may unfold this Dao. One should choose the days of the Six Celestial Convergences: *renyin*, *bingyin*, *jiazi*, *jiawu*, *xinwei*, and *xinchou*, for these are the times when the Most High aligns with the harmonious moments. On these days, the Jade Emperor routinely dispatches the Jade Lads of the Attendant Immortals to review and confirm the golden registers and jade names of the Eastern Florescence and Azure Palace, recording those who study the immortal’s path. On such days, if one’s diligent aspiration ascends to move the Jade Emperor, he shall command the Northern Emperor of Fengdu’s Six Palaces to sever the root of death’s register, inscribe the record of life at the Human Gate, transpose the Seven Stars to the Ghost Gate, transfer the Mysterious Pivot, and unfold the Heavenly Pass.\n\nWhenever practicing purification and fasting, one must earnestly visualize and focus inwardly. Close the eyes and internally store the vision, then knock the teeth thirty-six times. Visualize the First Celestial Star, the Supreme August Mysterious Pivot of Yang Brightness, the Celestial Pivot Hun Spirit, the Nine Lords of the Upper Mysterious, clad in flying cloud brocade skirts, crowned with the coronet of the Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into one’s body. Then recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Supreme August Mysterious Pivot of Yang Brightness, Celestial Pivot Hun Spirit, Nine Perfected Lords of the Upper Mysterious, blending and transforming as one spirit—may you sever my path of death at the Ghost Gate, transfer the record of life to the Southern Pavilion, remove the Seven Mysteries from the Three Paths, and rebirth me to become an immortal. Revolve the Seven Essences to grant me mysterious shade, and deliver my form through the Heavenly Pass.\"*\n\nAfterward, swallow qi fourteen times.\n\nNext, visualize the Second Primordial Star, the Northern Womb Yin Essence, the Celestial Chariot Hun Spirit, the Nine Jade Lords of the Upper Mystery, all clad in yellow brocade flying skirts and coronets of the Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into one’s body. Swallow qi and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Northern Womb Yin Essence, Celestial Chariot Hun Spirit, Nine Jade Lords of the Upper Mystery, blending myriad transformations as one spirit—may you erase my yang transgressions in the Great Yin, transfer yin qi to the Great Yang, transpose the Seven Primes to sever death, and unfold the Six Harmonies at the Heavenly Pass. Deliver my seven ancestors from the Three Paths, and grant me rebirth in the Southern Pavilion.\"*\n\nAfterward, swallow qi fourteen times.\n\nNext, visualize the Third True Star, the Nine Ultimates of the Upper Perfected, the Lady of the Upper Primordial, the Celestial Mechanism Po Essence, the Nine Pure Lords of the Upper Simplicity, all clad in azure brocade flying skirts and coronets of the Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into one’s body. Swallow qi and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Nine Ultimates of the Upper Perfected, Lady of the Upper Primordial, Celestial Mechanism Po Essence, Nine Pure Lords of the Upper Simplicity, blending and transforming as one spirit—may you unfold and dissolve the roots of karmic opposition, sever the source of the deathly path. Grant me eyes that see clearly and penetrate the boundless, with Mysterious Perfection pouring down and essence irrigating my body. May I grasp the August Chief Star, tread the Seven Primes, ride the luminous void, and soar alongside Heaven.\"*\n\nAfterward, swallow qi fourteen times.\n\nNext, visualize the Fourth Pivot Star, the Mysterious Mechanism of Profound Darkness, the Celestial Balance Hun Essence, the Nine Void Lords of the Upper Mystery, all clad in purple brocade flying skirts and coronets of the Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into one’s body. Recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Mysterious Mechanism of Profound Darkness, Celestial Balance Hun Essence, Nine Void Lords of the Upper Mystery, blending myriad transformations as one spirit—may you transpose the Seven Stars, fill and seal the Ghost Gate, sever the death-qi, and unfold the radiant Heavenly Pass. Revolve the Northern Dipper at the Mysterious Pivot, transfer the life-qi to the Western Kun, depart from the Northern Emperor of Fengdu, and inscribe my name in the Southern Pavilion.\"*\n\nAfterward, swallow qi fourteen times.\n\nNext, visualize the Fifth Principal Star, the Celestial Balance of Cinnabar Origin, the Jade Balance Hun Terrace, the Nine August Lords of the Upper Mystery, all clad in cinnabar brocade flying skirts and coronets of the Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into one’s body. Recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Celestial Balance of Cinnabar Origin, Jade Balance Hun Spirit, Nine August Lords of the Upper Mystery, blending myriad transformations as one spirit—may you descend the Seven Essences upon me, pour them into my body, revolve the Four to become Three, and activate the Seven Primes. Seal the Ghost Gate in the northeast, receive the life palace of the Nine Mysteries, inscribe my name in the Eastern Florescence, and allow me to serve the Jade Dawn.\"*\n\nAfterward, swallow qi fourteen times. With unwavering practice, one shall summon the guests of the Jade Emperor. The Emperor shall descend upon a thoroughfare of purple clouds, accompanied by twelve Western Florescence Jade Maidens and twelve Golden Dawn Jade Lads to attend and guard the adept’s body.",

Next, visualize the Sixth Register Star, the Life-Mechanism of the Northern Ultimate, the Radiant Yang Hun-Spirit Terrace, the Nine Lords of the Upper Cinnabar and Void.

Sever the roots of nine deaths, return the Three to the Four, and inscribe my name in the Seven Primes. May I preserve eternity and share the Dipper’s lifespan.\"*\n\nAfterward, swallow qi fourteen times. Next, visualize the Seventh Barrier Star, the Dark Yang Celestial Barrier, the Shaking Brilliance of the Great Luminous Supreme Jade Emperor Dao Lord. Clad in cinnabar brocade flying gauze skirts and crowned with the Dark Dawn’s coronet, they descend from the Dark Dipper into one’s body. Recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Dark Yang Celestial Barrier, Shaking Brilliance of the Great Luminous Supreme Jade Emperor Dao Lord—blending myriad transformations as one spirit—may you summon for me the Nine Perfected Lords of the Imperial Dawn above. Merge the Nine Yin, revolve the Celestial Gate, and release my Seven Mysteries’ ancestors. Grant me roaming through the Dark Clouds, sever my Northern Yin’s roots of death, and inscribe my name in the Eastern Florescence’s Jade Register.\"*\n\nAfterward, swallow qi fourteen times. Upon completing the visualization of the Seven Primes, knock the teeth twelve times. With eyes closed, envision the seven stars of the Northern Dipper shining brilliantly, illuminating the north. The Dark Essence reflects inwardly, descending to cover one’s body. The Perfected Lords within the Dipper undergo hun-tun transformations, assuming no fixed form. Together, they ride clouds of green mist to welcome the adept’s body, ascending into the midst of the Seven Stars.\n\nOne perceives oneself at the center of the Dipper, beneath the Flourishing Canopy. Radiant essence blazes, encircling the body like a crown, revolving with the Dipper as a wheel turns. In an instant, the Celestial Barrier opens. The Seven Stars and Nine Lords each bestow the talismans of the Seven Primes’ Barrier-Opening, enabling control over the Six Palaces of the Northern Emperor and severing the roots of death-qi.\n\nUpon receiving the talismans, one revolves and returns to the original essence, dwelling once more within the Dipper. The seven talismans blaze like fiery essence, propelling the adept downward. Suddenly treading the void, in the blink of an eye, one rests in the grove of repose. Knock the teeth thirty-six times and, lifting the head, recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Dark Radiance illumines essence, flowing light takes lightning’s form. Shedding mist, I vanish and transform, ascending to the Seven Stars. The Turning Mechanism tightens its reins, swift as startled lightning. The Heavenly One opens the Barrier, conveying me to life’s inscription. The Northern Emperor’s yin palaces sever my death-name. If not conveyed, if not severed, I turn toward the Seven Essences. I bear the Seven Primes, flowing gold and fiery bells. The Barrier-Opening’s celestial mechanism floods the Eight Darknesses. I command the Six Jia, dispatch the Six Ding. Heaven sends down Dark Mist, the Emperor grants divine soldiers. I beseech the Eastern Florescence to record my jade name. Soaring through the void, I ascend to the Jade Purity.\"*\n\nThen, swallow qi thirty-six times and cease.\n\nThis concludes the Dao of opening the Celestial Barrier, severing the roots of death, and blending myriad transformations. Practicing this for seven years and bearing the Seven Primes’ Barrier-Opening will summon green-mist chariots to welcome the adept’s body. This method must be secretly cultivated; do not transmit it lightly.\n\n*The Upper Scroll of the* Wondrous True Highest Clarity Scripture of the Three Charts of Opening Heaven and the Seven Stars’ Transference of Destiny *#1: \"Celestial Barrier\" (originally miswritten as \"Opening Heaven\").*\n\n*The Lower Scroll of the* Wondrous True Highest Clarity Scripture of the Three Charts of Opening Heaven and the Seven Stars’ Transference of Destiny.\n\n**The Talismans of the Seven Primes’ Barrier-Opening of the Emperor Lord**\n- Right: Orpiment inscribed on fresh green silk.\n- Right: Malachite inscribed in crimson.\n- Right: Vermilion inscribed on blue-green silk (alternatively, yellow on plain silk).\n- Right: Orpiment inscribed on white silk.\n- Right: Orpiment inscribed on fresh purple silk (alternatively, black on plain silk).\n- Right: Black inscribed on yellow silk.\n- Right: Vermilion inscribed on blue-green silk.\n\nThe inner talismans of the Seven Primes’ Barrier-Opening were bestowed by the Emperor Lord upon the Heavenly Emperor Lord, who transmitted them to the Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Ultimate. The Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Ultimate transmitted them to the Heavenly Emperor Lord of the Grand Tenuity, who passed them to the Lord of the Golden Watchtower. The Lord of the Golden Watchtower entrusted them to the Azure Lad of the Upper Minister, who conferred them upon those destined for immortality.\n\nAccording to the *Scripture of the Four Poles’ Luminous Regulations*, these talismans emerge once every seven hundred years. The method of transmission requires the disciple to observe a seven-day fast, offering thirty-one feet of blue-threaded silk, seventy feet of blue silk, ninety feet of phoenix-patterned gauze, seven pairs of gold buttons, one pair each of gold fish and jade dragons as tokens of the oath. To receive the scripture without such tokens is to treat the celestial treasure lightly; to transmit it without upholding the oath is to leak the Dao of Heaven. Sages value the Dao and disdain wealth, thus transmitting it only with tokens. Those who vex over wealth while seeking the Dao will find the Dao ever distant. Even if one glimpses the treasure text amid such leaks, the body will perish among the ghost officials, calamity extending to the Seven Mysteries—no benefit shall arise from such attainment.\n\nIf one possesses sincere devotion, an empty and earnest heart, and petitions the Jade Emperor to inscribe their name in the Eastern Florescence, dwelling in secluded peaks and distancing oneself from the human realm, sacrificing one’s own clothing and sustenance—only then may the scripture be transmitted.\n\nScholars who study yet remain ignorant of Heaven’s Celestial Barrier and Earth’s Fengdu—where the Barrier governs spirits and Fengdu commands ghosts—fail to grasp that these two Emperors preside over life and death, bound by the Dipper’s pivotal mechanism. Thus, the Seven Stars’ transference severs the Six Palaces’ names, while the Celestial Barrier records the register of immortals. The Dark Dipper corresponds to the Flourishing Canopy, and the Seven Primes bestow the Barrier-Opening. The path to immortality lies near at hand.\n\nThe Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Ultimate declared: \"Those with aspiration are all illumined in heart by the Seven Stars and Nine Emperors. Through ardent seeking and苦念, one naturally attains this scripture. Cultivating it for seven years leads to ascending at dawn. Even if one merely venerates this scripture without visualization, burning incense to its left and right, the essence of the Seven Stars will still constantly illumine the chamber, and the officials of Fengdu will not dare approach the body.\"",

      "translated_text": "Once the ritual of transference through the Seven Stars is complete, next visualize and invoke the Two August Stars. Sit upright facing east, and strike the teeth thirty-six times. Visualize the Two August Stars—the Nine Exalted Lords of the Eightfold Radiance of the Most High Jade Emperor, and the Lords of the Seven Primes of the Supreme Subtlety and the Jade Emperor of the Grand Tenuity—all clad in skirts of purple brocade woven with flying clouds, crowned with the coronets of the Dark Dawn. Descending from the Dark Dipper, they enter your body. Recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Most High Jade Emperor, Nine Exalted Lords of the Eightfold Radiance, Lords of the Seven Primes of the Supreme Subtlety and the Jade Emperor, Two August Ones who merge with the Nine Transformations of the Supreme God: for me, open the Celestial Barrier above, transfer and elevate my jade-name, sever and seal the demonic gate. Let the Six Palaces of the Northern Emperor cut off the roots of death. Ascend through the Seven Primes, bestow upon me the Eightfold Radiance, the Sevenfold Essence, the Ninefold August Flying Chariot, and the Green Canopy, that together we may ascend to the Imperial Dawn, collectively attend the August Consort, and command the myriad spirits.\"*\n\nUpon completion, swallow the qi twenty-one times.\n\n**Celestial Barrier-Opening Talisman of the Jade Emperor**\n*(Inscribed in realgar on fresh green jade.)*\n\n**Two August Stars Talisman**\n*(Ascend to the midst of the Flourishing Canopy of the Seven Stars.)*\n\nThe governance of the Two August Stars lies beneath the Flourishing Canopy, which perpetually veils them so that their luminous essence remains unseen, and no mortal may behold them. Thus, the *Golden Script in Jade Characters* states: *\"One who beholds the Two Stars extends life by six hundred years.\"* Without the Flying Celestial Talisman of the Two August Ones, one cannot ascend beneath the Flourishing Canopy, nor will the Two Stars reveal themselves to you. Once you bear the two talismans, the Two August Ones will naturally illumine your body with their dark radiance. Cultivating thus for seven years, you will ascend at dawn.\n\n**Method of the Northern Emperor’s Fengdu Six Palaces for Transcending Death**\nFengdu Mountain lies in the north, in the *gui* region, hence the northeast is the demonic gate, the root of the qi of death. The mountain stands two thousand six hundred *li* high, with a circumference of thirty thousand *li*. Beneath it lies the Primordial Cavern-Heaven, extending fifteen thousand *li* in circumference. Above and below, ghostly palaces abound. Atop the mountain stand the Six Palaces, and within the cavern lie another Six Palaces—each palace spans a thousand *li* in circumference, forming the abodes of the ghostly deities of the Six Heavens.\n\nThe First Palace is named the *Zhoujue Yin* Heavenly Palace, governing human affairs.\nThe Second Palace is named the *Taisha Liangshi Zong* Heavenly Palace.\nThe Third Palace is named the *Mingchen Naifan Wucheng* Heavenly Palace.\nThe Fourth Palace is named the *Tianzhao Zuiqi* Heavenly Palace.\nThe Fifth Palace is named the *Zongling Qifei* Heavenly Palace.\nThe Sixth Palace is named the *Gansi Lianwanlü* Heavenly Palace.\n\nThese Six Palaces are ruled by the Northern Emperor and governed by the ghostly deities of the Six Heavens, who record the names of mortals. None who die escape the Six Palaces of Fengdu. Thus, the August Lord constantly employs the Seven Stars to transfer and elevate those who cultivate immortality, passing through the Celestial Barrier to the Southern Ultimate’s palace, severing and sealing the northeastern gate of death.\n\nOnce the ritual of transference through Fengdu is complete, strike the left teeth nine times, intone the names of the Six Palaces, and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"I am a servant of the August Lord, my name inscribed in the Jade Purity. I do not govern the Six Heavens; the ghostly palaces of the Northern Emperor are all within my command. What ghost under my jurisdiction dares arise? At my right hangs the Barrier-Opening, at my left the Fire Bell. I hurl fire ten thousand *li*, my might subdues the myriad spirits. Those who offend are slain; those who trespass are punished. By the August Lord’s decree, none shall escape capture.\"*\n\nWith this, the ritual is complete. After the first recitation, the celestial radiance trembles; after the second, the myriad demons bind their forms; after the third, ghostly fiends are eradicated, the Six Palaces erase mortal names of death, the Celestial Barrier transfers the living, and the Southern Ultimate revives the dead. One who does not study the names of the Fengdu Palaces or the governance of its ghostly deities, who does not learn to sever and seal the realm of death, will never attain immortality.\n\n**Supreme Method of the Five Separations for Cutting Off Death and Ascending to Life**\nTo practice the Way of the Six Convergences and Transference, one must cultivate the Five Dawns to sever ties with the gate of death and ascend to the palace of life, the method of flying immortality.\n\nChoose the days of *renshen*, *bingshen*, *wushen*, *jiashen*, and *gengshen*—the Five Separation days of death. At this time, the August Lord holds a grand feast, riding a chariot of luminous dragons, a flying canopy of green mist, accompanied by immortal officials and jade maidens, circling the Ten Heavens before descending to the mortal realm to inspect and examine those who cultivate immortality. He commands the Five Lords of the Northern Darkness of the Northern Emperor to present the Registers of Death at the Accounting Palace of Pingdu, where the ledgers of life and death are reviewed and tallied.\n\nThe True August Lords of the Five Stars of the Five Directions each govern one direction, collectively overseeing all immortals who are to attain the Dao, their names proclaimed in the Eastern Florescence. For those burdened by yin sins, yin transgressions, yang sins, or yang transgressions—offenses bound to the Northern Emperor—the Lords of the Northern Darkness declare their names in the palaces of Fengdu, separating the good from the evil, the living from the dead.\n\nThus, on the Five Separation days, one first repents before the Northern Darkness, cultivates life before the Great Yang, removes the register of death from the Northern Emperor, and seeks the record of immortality from the Five Stars. On each of these days, don immaculate robes, burn incense, enter the chamber, repent of transgressions, contemplate goodness, visualize the spirits within, and focus the mind on the mysterious, free of distractions. As the August Lord traverses the Five Realms, the divine officials record your merits and proclaim your name to the Jade Emperor.\n\nAfter five years of such practice, the True August Lords of the Five Stars will descend to your chamber.\n\nOn these days, at the three times of dawn, noon, and midnight, enter the chamber, burn incense, bow twice to the north, strike the teeth three times, and visualize while reciting the incantation:\n\n*\"Most High Jade Emperor, I beseech you to absolve the yin evils and unrighteous deeds committed by my seven generations of ancestors down to myself—killing, licentiousness, arrogance, jealousy, harm to the true Dharma, the thousand offenses and ten thousand transgressions, the yang sins and yin transgressions—all names reported to the Northern Emperor. I beg for their dispersal and erasure, the elimination of my sinful name, the severing of the roots of death, the transfer through the Celestial Barrier of humanity, that I may be inscribed in the Eastern Florescence, my name recorded in the celestial register. May my seven generations of ancestors and parents return to the womb of the Southern Immortals.\"*\n\nUpon completion, visualize the essence of the True August Lord of the Chen Star in the northern direction, clad in a flying skirt of purple brocade, a tiger tally at his waist, a yellow coronet upon his head, riding a cloud of brocade mist. Accompanied by twelve immortal officials, he descends from the north to cover your body. His radiance is lush and resplendent, his essence dazzling and brilliant. Look up and recite the incantation:",

      "translated_text": "If one practices this without fail on the appointed days, after seven years the Five Dawn True August Lords will be moved to respond, manifesting their forms in your bedchamber. The Supreme Thearch will personally dispatch five Jade Maidens from the Five Directions to guard your body, and the Northern Thearch of Great Yin will come to pay homage at your gate, no longer daring to bind you with your transgressions. Those who study immortality and seek the True should diligently practice this.\n\nThe method of repentance for seeking immortality is the technique taught by the High Minister Azure Lad to petition the Sacred Lord of the Golden Gates, established as a precept for later learners who seek life—it is not the repentance of the Supreme Thearch himself. When performing this practice, the August Lord also observes your heart. If past transgressions remain unresolved, the palaces of the Six Heavens will not strike your name from the register of death, nor will the Gate of Opening and Closing permit your body to pass through. Thus, the Merging and Converging Repository is the source that fills death, while the Gate of Opening and Closing is the office that delivers life. Only through earnest seeking can one attain the True.\n\n**The August Lord’s Inner Illumination with the Bright Lamp: Supreme Method for Seeking Immortality**\n*Transmitted by the Southern Culmen Supreme Primordial Lord*\n\nThe August Lord constantly dwells in the Tower of Radiant Mystery, within golden chambers and purple doors. He illumines himself with the Bright Mystery Lamp, suffusing the eight windows with rosy light. He contemplates the Supreme Perfected within the Five Forms and unfolds the Three Vows in the August Chamber. The numinous descends beneath a purple canopy, and the Primordial August Lord assigns him golden lads. Naturally, he is titled an August Lord, governing the Mysterious Palace. The Supreme Grade arises from the wondrous inception; the Dao resides in the faintest glimmer. Now I impart this to you—practice it diligently.\n\nThe Southern Culmen Supreme Primordial Lord declared: \"You who study the Way of Divine Perfection, abiding above the Numinous Palace within the Jade Chamber—if you do not know how to illumine yourself with the Bright Lamp and suffuse the Mysterious Light within the Five Viscera, you will not attain clarity. The spirits of the bodily form will not find their return. If you can light the Bright Lamp at your Original Destiny in the evening and at your Active Year in the morning, and keep a Bright Lamp constantly at the Grand Year, making vows in these three places, your body will become serene and your qi upright. The True Light will shine brightly, and the myriad spirits will be radiant and pure.\n\nIf the Primordial Lord receives and practices this method for three years, twenty-four Night-Light Lads will arrive, and the Mysterious Light will naturally become bright—no Bright Lamp will be needed to transmit the light. Yet this wondrous method of the Supreme Perfected and the Pure is not transmitted to the lower world. Only those with golden names, jade characters, and a mysterious register may receive this Dao. Practicing it for nine years, your body will become luminous, seeing clearly for ten thousand miles. The Mysterious Vision will arise naturally, and the Night-Light Lads will descend to your chamber, bestowing upon you the True Writ. You will ascend in broad daylight to the Dawn.\n\nConstantly keep the Bright Lamp in a quiet chamber at your Original Destiny. In the evening, enter the chamber, face the lamp, and kneel in prostration. Strike the teeth twelve times and recite the incantation:\n\n*The Mysterious Light illumines the Great Yin,\nEight paths radiant and bright.\nSerene in spirit within the secluded chamber,\nGazing upward to leap into the Supreme Clarity.\nFive glories emanate from the Mysterious Terrace,\nJade mushrooms grow naturally.\nPenetrating illumination reaches the Supreme Perfected,\nThe myriad spirits observe my form.\nEradicating the qi of the Nine Yin,\nInscribing my name in the Eastern Florescence.\nPreserving me without end,\nForever paralleling the sun and moon.\nDelivering me from the Seven Dark Perils,\nReceiving further glory in the Southern Palace.\nThe Bright Light awakens the Jade Thearch,\nAscending to receive the Inner Illumination Scripture.\nHeaven sends the Flying Rosy Chariot,\nSoaring through the sky in a green carriage.\nI attain audience in the Thearch’s hall,\nAdvancing to bow in the Jade Thearch’s court.*\n\nWhen finished, bow twice, face your Original Destiny, raise your head, and swallow saliva seven times.\n\nAlso, constantly keep the Bright Lamp at your Active Year. In the morning, face the lamp, strike the teeth twelve times, and recite the incantation:\n\n*The Bright Lamp illumines my Active Year,\nScattering light that shines in the eight directions.\nInfant-like, the colors and images become serene,\nInner vision radiant, empty and unified.\nUnfastening the luminous sash of the spirit,\nI commune with the Jade Perfected.\nGazing upward to the lofty and supreme Dao,\nVast and distant, without form or trace.\nI yearn for the descent of the Mysterious Cloud,\nTo rein in the flying dragons.\nReversing my hundred-year span,\nReturning to an infant’s countenance.\nBestowing upon me the Maiden of the Western Florescence,\nAssigning me the Golden Dawn Lad.\nAttending to incense and treading upon my years,\nBowing my head in the Jade Thearch’s chamber.\nSpirits at peace, the Dao flows smoothly,\nFear dispelled amidst the fragrant smoke.\nComposing my heart to abide in the Supreme Mystery,\nEarnestly moved by the cavernous void.\nThe chamber summons the descent of Divine Rosy Clouds,\nClosing my eyes to gaze upon the Immortal Lords.\nDelivering my seven generations of ancestors from peril,\nTransforming my form to return to the Southern Palace.*\n\nWhen finished, bow twice, face east, and swallow qi fourteen times.\n\nConstantly keep the Bright Lamp at the Grand Year to commune with the spirits and fulfill vows in seeking the True. After three years, the Mysterious Light will inwardly crystallize, and the Divine Perfected will descend, bestowing upon you the method of immortality. At that time, there will naturally be a response. Morning and evening, burn incense, strike the teeth twelve times, face the lamp, and recite the incantation:\n\n*The lamp’s flame illumines the Supreme Perfected,\nBright light penetrating the Mysterious Void.\nUnfolding the supreme and lofty Dao,\nMy heart fixed upon the Jade Thearch’s abode.\nPenetrating the empty and cavernous within,\nThe spirit’s vision expands the body’s ease.\nAccumulated sincerity draws the numinous descent,\nA tranquil heart governs the hidden dwelling.\nMorning rites in the Thearch’s hall,\nEvening recitations of the True Writ.\nCarefree within the Mysterious Capital,\nFor ten thousand years reverting to infancy.\nA heavenly crown of purple rosy clouds,\nThe Thearch assigns six jade chariots.\nWandering atop the Five Peaks,\nContentment found wherever I go.\nSeven generations of ancestors escape the Three Wretched Paths,\nBlessings and felicity overflowing.*\n\nWhen finished, bow twice and swallow qi fourteen times.\n\nIf you can constantly keep the Bright Lamps lit in these three places without extinguishing them, your seven generations of ancestors will immediately escape the Ten Sufferings, ascending to the Southern Culmen. Your body’s spirits will become serene and upright, your eyes seeing for ten thousand miles, your ears hearing distant sounds, and your heart’s wisdom foreseeing the yet-unrealized. The Divine Perfected will descend, and the Night-Light Lads will teach you the Way of seeking immortality. After nine years of this, the numinous light will naturally become bright, penetrating within and without.\n\nThe Five Dawns repent their transgressions before the Five Emperors, visualizing the Five Dawns to deliver life. The practice concludes here.\n\n**The August Lord’s Five Vows: Supreme Method for Seeking Immortality**\n\nThe August Lord constantly observes the ninth day of the ninth month, the fifth day of the tenth month, the third day of the third month, the eighth day of the fourth month, and the seventh day of the seventh month—these are the times of the Five Vows and Ten Assemblies. Ascending to the Great Ultimate’s Jade Terrace, within the lofty Jade Hall and golden chambers, he visualizes the Five Vows in the Jade Palace, yearning for the descent of the Mysterious Perfected. The Void and Nothingness open with jade missives, golden tones resounding through the Great Emptiness. He summons the Five Emperors to guard the numinous, celebrating the myriad assemblies in the Cinnabar Chamber.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, through sincere devotion, the Perfected are summoned, and the Perfected, moved by such devotion, descend. On these days, one must bathe in purity and fast, enter the chamber to burn incense, bow in reverence to the four directions, then sit upright facing east—for east is the direction of the dawning radiance. Knock the teeth thirty-six times in succession.\n\nThe First Vow: May the qi of my birth be natural, coalescing within it to form my body, my body equal in rank to the Three Luminaries, eternally rooted in the boundless.\nThe Second Vow: May my body ever dwell above the Great Void, within the Jade Palace and chambers of jade, feasting with the Jade Emperor by day and abiding with the Mysterious Mother by night; when thirsty, sipping from the Wave-Well’s vast spring and jade mushrooms, when hungry, partaking of dragon embryos, jade-rich fat, crimson trees, and red infants.\nThe Third Vow: May my body generate ten thousand auspicious signs and seventy-two rays of light, with rare hairs and extraordinary bones, clad in feathered robes, riding the void and driving through the sky, entering and exiting the imperial palace, with all blessings converging, and boundless longevity.\nThe Fourth Vow: May I be born with the formless and die with the formless, dying yet living again, reborn as a Perfected Sovereign, governing the Ten Heavens and leading the host of immortals.\nThe Fifth Vow: May all sentient beings, born or yet unborn, together preserve the Three Luminaries of sun and moon; may those of the Dao and the Seven Mysteries’ ancestors ascend to the Southern Palace, and may the world’s blessings be without exception fulfilled.\n\nThe vows of the four directions and the Five Vows converge in the Jade Hall.\n\nNext, the supreme vow: May the Nine Mysteries nurture my body, my hun and po souls and true spirits ever dwell within my palace, ascending to commune with the celestial immortals, descending to reach the abyssal depths. May the vows to Heaven, Earth, Wind, Spirits, and Immortals unite as one, inscribing my name in the register of eternal life. May purple mists descend from Heaven, and may the Five Numinous Ones guard the earth. Riding clouds and driving through the void, ascending in a jade-green chariot, I shall reach the Golden Gate and ascend to the Jade Purity, extending blessings to my seven ancestors, who shall be reborn anew. The Five Vows merge into five unions, eternally enjoying prosperity and harmony.\n\nThe Middle Vows, also five in number, seek the root of attaining the Dao: the Vow of Yin, the Vow of Yang, the Vow of the Great Void, the Vow of the Great Nothingness, and the Vow of the Great Mystery. Feasting in the Jade Chambers with the Emperor, bound by karmic affinity, gazing upon the gates of life, traversing the Nine Heavens. The Primordial Father inscribes my name, the Mysterious Mother records my years. Peaches of immortality and radiance coalesce, securing the Cinnabar Field. My body ascends to the Golden Gate, my name inscribed in the Jade Register. My seven ancestors are liberated, and blessings converge.\n\nThe Lower Vows, also five in number: the Vow of the Great Void, the Vow of the Great Existence, the Vow of the Supreme, the Vow of the Great Perfected, and the Vow of the Divine Immortals. May I traverse the peaks of the Five Marchmounts, drift among the Nine Skies, enter and exit the gates of opening, and transcend the portals of death. May Heaven and Earth be my parents, the Three Luminaries guard me for ten thousand years. May spirits guard the nine apertures of my body, and numinous qi descend naturally. The Five Vows of the eight directions converge in resonance.\n\nWhen the Five Vows are complete, knock the teeth fourteen times and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Supreme Emperor of the Upper Origin, the Emperor’s Unity and Mysterious Canon, five clouds scatter radiance, luxuriant in the Three Purities. Jade lads and jade maidens burn incense and attend the numinous. The supreme vows are declared, uniting with my form, making me a divine immortal, ascending to the imperial court. The Northern Emperor severs death, the Southern Dipper inscribes life. In the Eastern Flower’s Golden Pavilion, my name is recorded. Boundless vows align with mine.\"*\n\nWhen the incantation is finished, knock the teeth twenty-one times more, then tilt the head back and swallow qi five times before ceasing.\n\nThis is the August Lord’s method of declaring the supreme vows to unite with the numinous in form. Those who practice thus shall be attended by jade blossoms and guarded by jade lads who scatter incense, their devotion ascending to the Nine Heavens, moving the Emperor to respond. After five years of such practice, the Dao shall naturally descend. Throughout the world’s ten directions, wherever there are vows of the Dao, the Dao shall not fail to descend in response. When reciting the vows, the mind and intent must be singular, without stray thoughts or external distractions. If the true spirits scatter, the vows shall not descend. If one treads in defilement or impurity, the Perfected shall remain distant.\n\nHere concludes the August Lord’s method of the Five Vows and Ten Assemblies.\n\nOn each of these days, if one can recite the vows with focused sincerity and proper method, the Emperor shall dispatch jade lads to guard one’s body, summoning the vows of the five directions and the Dao of divine immortality to descend upon one’s form. After five years of such practice, one shall ride flying clouds to ascend the Nine Heavens, with one’s name recorded in the Eastern Flower. One’s seven ancestors and parents shall also receive blessings, escape the Three Wretched Paths, and be reborn in the Southern Palace of the Immortals.\n\nThe Supreme Lord of the Upper Origin of the Southern Culmen states: Those who study in the world know only to seek in the morning and expect results by evening, to utter a single vow and hope for a response, to recite an incantation and await its fulfillment. Yet they do not realize that ascending the peaks of Mount Qi begins with the first step on the mountain path; a tree of a thousand feet grows from a tender shoot. The Dao is lofty and the Perfected are wondrous—how can one set foot and expect to climb the cloud ladder at once? Even the August Lord, who received the qi and governed the Perfected, still relied on the bright lamp to commune with the numinous, and the Five Vows to invoke blessings. How could one not encompass the natural?\n\nThe path of seeking immortality must begin with vows before seeking, for vows move the numinous to respond. The greatness of the Five Vows encompasses all, their blessings covering all, their felicity flowing without end—truly, they touch upon all that is good. If one’s heart is sincere in the vows, there shall be no vow that does not resonate in response. May those who come after with devotion take heed.\n\nThe Most Exalted Azure Lad states: In my past studies, I traversed seven hundred years, scaling perilous peaks, crossing east and west, journeying south and north, roaming the central plains. I studied under thirty-two masters and received over three hundred teachings, yet I had not ascended to the Golden Gate to receive the sacred texts and purple writings from the Saintly Lord—the Dao of ingesting the yellow essence of sun and moon to restrain the hun and po souls, of coalescing radiance and luminous instruments, of the Nine Perfected and Eight Paths to dissolve form and escape transformation, of the Purple Passage, scorching light, flowing gold, and fire bells, of exhaling and inhaling flying clouds, treading the void, and stepping upon the Seven Primordials’ precious canon. The Saintly Lord, by the Seven Stars’ translocation—a treasure of the Supreme Emperor—swore an oath and transmitted it to me, enabling me to sever the deathly names of the Six Palaces, seal the ghostly gate of the northeast, and open the Heavenly Pass to translocate my body. Only then could I ascend to serve the Three Origins, attaining the office of Most Exalted Minister, governing the host of immortals. The Seven Stars blazed in the heavens, revolving the essence of the Nine Origins. Above, I rode the qi of the Three Origins; below, I governed the names of the Six Heavens. Life and death, separation and union—none were beyond the Seven Stars.",

Ascending to the Great Ultimate’s Jade Terrace, within the lofty Jade Hall and golden chambers, he visualizes the Five Vows in the Jade Palace, yearning for the descent of the Mysterious Perfected. The Void and Nothingness open with jade missives, golden tones resounding through the Great Emptiness. He summons the Five Emperors to guard the numinous, celebrating the myriad assemblies in the Cinnabar Chamber.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, when the Dipper’s influence falls upon a person, they die; when the Dipper shifts, they live. Therefore, the Seven Stars serve as the celestial ministers, and the Heavenly Pass is the treasury of life-translocation. Those who study yet do not sever the ghostly gate in the northeast or translocate the life-mark to the Southern Pass—how can their lives be preserved?\n\nThe Supreme Emperor concealed this scripture within the chambers of the Six Directions, commanding the Jade Maiden of Western Florescence, the Golden Dawn Jade Youths—three hundred in number—to guard its sacred text. Later, it was transmitted to the host of perfected beings and emerged within the renowned mountains. The Lord of Western City, afterward, discovered this text within the stone chamber of Mount Wangwu. The Lord then retreated to purify himself for three months, bearing tokens of faith to ascend the mountain, where he received, unfolded, and perused it. Through the Seven Stars’ translocation and the cultivation of its Way, he attained the rank of Perfected.\n\nSince the time when those without jade names achieved immortality, none have heard or beheld this Way. For the child who possesses this scripture, the Six Palaces of Fengdu will record their name and translocate them to the Southern Pass—how much more so for those who cultivate its practice?\n\nThe Lord of Western City stated: This original text comprised three scrolls—*The Heavenly Pass* and *The Heavenly Diagram*—which do not circulate in the world. The Lady of Southern Marchmount received only this single scroll, *The Seven Stars’ Translocation*. Here ends the lower scroll of *The Wondrous Perfection of Highest Clarity: The Three Heaven-Opening Diagrams and the Seven Stars’ Translocation*.",
