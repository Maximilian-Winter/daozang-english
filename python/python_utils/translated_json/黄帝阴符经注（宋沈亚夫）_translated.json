  "full_translation": "**Translation:**\n\n*The Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing* Commentary*\nTitle: *Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing***\nAuthored by Shěn Yàfū, likely from the Northern Song dynasty.\nRecorded in *The Comprehensive Records of the Arts and Literature* (《通志□艺文略》).\nOne scroll.\n\nThe original text: *The Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era* (《正统道藏》), under the *Tongzhen* (洞真) section, *Jade Precepts* (玉诀类).\n\nThe *Yin Fu Jing*’s three hundred words converge upon a singular principle.\nMost people fail to grasp its profound mysteries, discussing Dao, military strategy, and human affairs instead—this is not its intent.\n\n*The Tai Xuan* (《太玄》) states:\n*\"The Yang ascends the Five Blessings by their kindred affinity.*\nLongevity, wealth, ease, and good fortune come to those who cherish virtue and fulfill their destiny.\n*The Yin descends the Six Calamities by their kindred affinity.*\nShortened life, misfortune, illness, and sorrow come to those burdened by poverty, malice, or weakness.\"*\n\nThe Sage expounds upon the One Dao of Heaven, the Two of Earth, and the Three of Life (三生).\nAll ten thousand things derive from the One *Qi* (炁) and are born from it.\nThus, one cultivates the mind to harmonize with nature (*xìng* 性),\ncultivates nature to harmonize with *Qi*,\n*Qi* merges with the Void (*xūwú* 虚无),\nand the Void integrates with the Essence (*tǐ* 体).\n\nThen, one embodies the Dao’s movement in Heaven,\nobserves celestial omens to model speech,\ndeciphers the profound patterns of the Three Essentials (三要),\nrefines the true *Qi* of the Five Phases (五行),\nmolds the essence of Sun and Moon,\nconceals and directs the *Kàn* (坎) and *Lí* (离) energies,\ndiscerns the interplay of Yin and Yang in creation,\nand penetrates the principles of Heaven and Earth’s generation.\n\nThe text says:\n*\"The Sun and Moon follow their appointed cycles,\ngreat and small have fixed measures—\nfrom this, the Sage’s work arises,\nand divine insight emerges.\nAh, how profound!\"*\n\nTo delve deeply into its subtle meaning,\nto perceive its true source,\ngaining it grants eternal life,\nlosing it risks a premature end.\n\nHere we see the three terms—*performing the Dao* (演道), *performing the Law* (演法), *performing the Art* (演术)—\nancient sages kept them hidden, preserving them.\nThis is the hidden mechanism of Heaven,\nnot to be carelessly divulged.\n\nNow, I briefly annotate its meaning,\nto guide the essence toward clarity.\nThe unadorned truth is most precious,\neasy to grasp, profound in intent.\n\n**Highest:** The Immortals embrace the One in *performing the Dao*.\n*Performing the Dao* refers to the *Huan Dan* (还丹) school’s embrace of the One,\nwhere the primal *Qi* (元炁) circulates toward the brain,\nascending to the Celestial Orb (朝天).\nLike the *Qi*-orb revolving,\nit ascends to the Celestial Court (朝天).\n\n*The Daoist Scriptures* say:\n*\"Eternal life without aging—\nreturn the essence to replenish the brain.\"*\n\n*The Tai Qing Jade Precepts* (《太清玉诀》) say:\n*\"If you reach the River Vehicle’s realm,\ngolden treasures fill your home.\"*\n\n**Middle:** The ruler enriches the nation and secures the people by *performing the Law*.\n*Performing the Law* means purifying the heart of defilement,\nascending to the *Chun Kan* (淳坎) waters of purity,\nbecoming the Law itself.\n\nThis heart is the Emperor’s—\nserene and undivided, he establishes just governance,\nthus enriching the nation and securing the people.\n\n*The Tai Qing Jade Precepts* say:\n*\"If you reach the Brown River’s ford,\nforging white essence,\nconcealing the truth.\"*\n\n**Lowest:** The warrior strengthens his forces and conquers by *performing the Art*.\n*Performing the Art* means:\n*Fire* (木) generates *Fire* (火),\nthe hollow center of *Lí* (离) is *Water*,\nthe solid center of *Kàn* (坎) is *Fire*—\nthus, the true *Water* and true *Fire* are concealed within the heart,\nforming the Art itself.\n\n*The Tai Qing Jade Precepts* say:\n*\"If you reach the Violet Elixir,\nlife is neither death nor difficulty.\"*\n\n**Commentary on the *Yellow Emperor’s Yin Fu Jing***\nBy the *Censor-in-Chief* Shěn Yàfū.\n\n**Chapter One: Performing the Dao**\n\nObserve the Dao of Heaven, grasp its movement—\nthus it is complete.\n\nThe virtuous one gazes upward at Heaven’s Dao,\nits ceaseless motion, conforming to Law and following its course—\nthus his nature and life are preserved and nurtured,\nand Heaven’s order is fulfilled.\n\nHeaven has five *thieves*—\nthose who perceive them flourish.\n\nHeaven’s five *thieves* are the Five Phases.\nThe sun is *Fire*.\n*Fire* is born of *Wood*, which overcomes *Earth*.\nThe moon is *Water*.\n*Water* is born of *Metal*, which overcomes *Wood*.\nWhen the Five Phases prey upon or give birth to one another,\nthis is the origin of cold and heat.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"I gaze upward at Heaven’s thieves—\nthe Five Phases in order or disorder.\nWhen their sequence is right,\nHeaven’s command flourishes and extends,\nbecoming the great foundation of longevity.\"*\n\nThe five *thieves* dwell within the heart,\nyet their actions manifest in Heaven.\n\nHeaven has five stars,\nthe human body has five viscera,\ncorresponding to eye, ear, nose, tongue, and heart.\nThe heart is the chief of the five *thieves*—\nthus, by observing the five stars,\none weaves through myriad symbols,\ninner and outer forces harmonizing,\nand grasps Heaven’s Dao in action.\n\nThe cosmos lies within the hands,\nten thousand transformations arise from the body.\n\nThe virtuous one comprehends the true source—\nas if Heaven and Earth were in the hands,\ncreation born from the heart,\nknowing all things draw from the One *qi* to form their bodies.\n\nHeaven’s nature is humanity.\nHumanity is the heart.\nThe heart is the mechanism.\nEstablishing Heaven’s Dao to steady humanity.\n\nWhat is called *Heaven’s command* is *nature*—\nhumanity.\nThe human heart is a shifting mechanism,\nmeasuring the workings of creation to fix,\nand acting in accordance with Heaven’s Dao without error.\n\nWhen Heaven unleashes its killing intent,\ndragons and serpents rise from the land.\nIn the months of the three *Yangs*,\nwhen *Yin* and *Yang* harmonize,\nand *Water* and *Fire* prey upon each other—\nthis is when Heaven unleashes its killing intent,\nwith thunder, wind, and rain shaking the world,\ndragons and serpents emerging from their lairs,\nand ten thousand things bursting forth—\nthus the authority of life and death is fully revealed.\n\nWhen humanity unleashes its killing intent,\nHeaven and Earth are overturned.\nFor if the human heart is stirred,\nthen fortune and misfortune, regret and blame arise.\n\nHeaven and Earth are not overturned.\nHeaven is the Sage,\nEarth is the path of the subject.\nOverturning refers to order and disorder.\nWhen the six orders and six reversals are not constant,\nthis is called overturning.\n\nThe Sage stirs not his heart,\nthus he follows Heaven’s command;\nthe petty man acts against the mechanism,\nthus he does not exhaust Heaven’s order.\n\nWhen Heaven and humanity act in concert,\nall transformations are fixed by the mechanism.\nThe Sage aligns with Heaven’s Dao,\nbalancing the mechanism without deviation,\nthus fixing his heart’s intent—\nhence, he guards the One.\n\nNature has skill and clumsiness,\nwhich can be concealed.\nFor humanity’s skill or clumsiness in nature\nmirrors the symbols of *Kàn* and *Lí*—\nskill means *Jiè* (completion),\nclumsiness means *Wèi Jiè* (incompletion),\nthus it is concealed within the *Dan Tian*.\n\nThe *Dan Tian* is the origin of essence and *qi*.\nThe nine orifices’ evils lie in the three *Yào* points,\nwhich can be moved or stilled.\nThe nine orifices of the human body—\nif the heart is upright, the nine evils cannot enter.\nThe three *Yào* are the proper count of *Yang*.\nThree threes make nine—\nwhen *Yang qi* is sufficient, movement and stillness admit no deceit or evil.\n\n*Fire* is born of *Wood*—\nwhen calamity arises, it must overcome.\nDeceit arises in the realm—\nwhen it acts, it must collapse.\nKnowing this and refining it\nis the mark of the Sage.\n\n*Fire* is born of *Wood*.\nWhen *Yang qi* is at its peak,\nguard against it in the *Dòu* (constellation) and in desire,\nlest deceitful thieves arise.\n\nThe virtuous one refines his body and conduct,\nthen governs the realm and secures the people—\nsuch is the Sage and the worthy.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Two: Performing the Law**\n\nHeaven and Earth are thieves of all things;\nall things are thieves of humanity;\nhumanity is the thief of all things.\nWhen the three thieves are complete,\nthe Three Powers are at peace.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Eat in season, and the hundred bones are in order.\nStir the mechanism, and all transformations are at peace.\"*\n\nThe Three *Generations* produce ten thousand things,\ncontaining the pure *Yang qi*.\nIf the One *qi* is stolen,\nit returns after seven days of *Lái Fù* (reversal),\nthus the Three Powers are complete in unity.\n\nHumanity, having stolen the beginning of all things,\nuses them unknowingly—\nbut those who know this attain longevity,\ntheir form unchanging, all transformations at peace.\n\nHumanity knows its spirit,\nbut does not know how its non-spirit makes it spirit.\n\nHumanity has thirty-six thousand spirit-lights—\nthus, when desires multiply, the spirit is exhausted,\nand it is no longer spirit.\n\nThe *Yì* says:\n*\"The unfathomable *Yin* and *Yang* are spirit—\nembracing the One and preserving the spirit is how one becomes spirit.\"*\n\nThe sun and moon have their numbers,\nthe great and small have their limits.\nFrom this, the Sage’s work arises,\nand divine clarity emerges.\n\nThe sun is the essence of *Fire*,\nmoving one degree per day and night;\nthe moon is the essence of *Water*,\nmoving twelve and a half degrees per day and night.\n\nThus the virtuous one steals the numbers of *Water* and *Fire*,\ntheir great and small movements,\nand attains extraordinary Sagehood—\nfrom this, divine light emerges.\n\nAs for stealing the mechanism,\nnone under Heaven can see or know it.\nThe virtuous one who obtains it preserves his life;\nthe petty man who obtains it risks his life.\nThus, to steal Heaven’s mechanism,\nthe workings of creation—\nthe foolish cannot see or know it.\n\nThe virtuous one attains it and returns to the true;\nthe petty man acts against it and perishes.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Three: Performing the Art**\n\nThe blind excel in hearing,\nthe deaf excel in seeing.\nCutting off the source of gain,\none’s use of a teacher is tenfold;\nthe blind and deaf excel in hearing and seeing,\nthus the root of gain is severed.\n\nIf humanity can focus the heart\nwithout abandoning the middle path,\nthe tenfold use of a teacher cannot compare.\n\nThree returns of day and night,\none’s use of a teacher is ten thousandfold.\nThe virtuous one focuses the heart,\nrepeating day and night in the three *Yang* periods,\nhis actions unbroken—\nthus his use of a teacher surpasses ten thousandfold.\n\nThe heart is born of things,\ndies in things,\nits mechanism lies in the eyes.\nWhen the heart is extinguished and the eyes do not gaze outward,\nlife and death are forgotten—\nthus the mechanism is forgotten.\n\nHeaven, though without kindness, gives rise to great kindness.\nHeaven, though silent, is without partiality in sun and moon.\nIf humanity can steal the bait of essence,\nattaining the art of immortality—\nthis is when kindness knows no end, and great kindness arises.\n\nSwift lightning and fierce winds—\nnone remain unmoved.\nWhen the will is singular and sincere,\nthus unmoved and still.\n\nSupreme joy overflows from nature,\nsupreme stillness brings purity.\nWhen nature is harmonious, it embraces the boundless with ease;\nwhen the heart is clear, all transformations are pure and balanced.\n\nThe utmost privacy of Heaven yields its application in the utmost fairness. Heaven displays its symbols—when humanity seizes and imitates them, this is Heaven’s utmost privacy; Heaven’s creative transformations are without bias or favoritism, thus the utmost fairness.\n\nThe regulation of beasts lies in **qi**[*1].\nThe living are the root of the dead;\nthe dead are the root of the living.\nHumans live by **qi**, die by **qi**;\nall things live by the Earth, die by the Earth.\nIf humans can grasp and regulate **qi**,\nattaining Heaven and Earth’s true **qi**—\nthis is the root of eternal life and immortality.\n**Qi** is the art of grasping and releasing[*2].\nVirtue arises from harm, harm from virtue.\nSpring’s birth and summer’s growth—virtue;\nautumn’s killing and winter’s concealment—harm.\nHumans are born through women—virtue;\nthey die through women—harm.\n\nThe fool takes Heaven and Earth’s patterns and principles as sacred;\nI take the changes of time and things as profound wisdom.\nHeaven’s patterns and Earth’s principles—these are the **Dao** of Heaven and Earth;\nHeaven’s timing and Earth’s advantages—these are the **Dao** of time and circumstances.\nThose who embody Heaven’s patterns and Earth’s regulations are sacred;\nthose who adapt to time’s shifts and movements are profound.\nThe fool cannot discern Heaven’s timing and human affairs;\nif one can align with Heaven and Earth’s nurturing transformations,\nand set teachings according to the times—\nthis is the conduct of the Sage and the Wise.\n\nThe **Dao** is the foundation of stillness,\nstillness is Heaven’s mechanism.\nMovement reveals its changes,\nchanges reveal its symbols.\nThus, creative transformations move and still,\n**yin** and **yang** propel each other—\nthis is why it harmonizes with Heaven’s flow,\nand calculations never stray.\n\nThe *Tài Xuān*[*3] says:\nBy night, measure **yin**;\nby day, measure **yang**.\nThis is the Sage’s grasp of profound principles,\nwho naturally sustains life,\nconceals the mechanism without slaughtering it,\nand whose discourse is boundless.\n\nHow distant are those who merely discuss military strategy and human affairs!\n\nThe *Yellow Emperor’s Yīn Fú Jīng*[*4] concludes.",

threes make nine—\nwhen *Yang qi* is sufficient, movement and stillness admit no deceit or evil.\n\n*Fire* is born of *Wood*—\nwhen calamity arises, it must overcome.\nDeceit arises in the realm—\nwhen it acts, it must collapse.\nKnowing this and refining it\nis the mark of the Sage.\n\n*Fire* is born of *Wood*.\nWhen *Yang qi* is at its peak,\nguard against it in the *Dòu* (constellation) and in desire,\nlest deceitful thieves arise.\n\nThe virtuous one refines his body and conduct,\nthen governs the realm and secures the people—\nsuch is the Sage and the worthy.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Two: Performing the Law**\n\nHeaven and Earth are thieves of all things;\nall things are thieves of humanity;\nhumanity is the thief of all things.\nWhen the three thieves are complete,\nthe Three Powers are at peace.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Eat in season, and the hundred bones are in order.\nStir the mechanism, and all transformations are at peace.\"*\n\nThe Three *Generations* produce ten thousand things,\ncontaining the pure *Yang qi*.\nIf the One *qi* is stolen,\nit returns after seven days of *Lái Fù* (reversal),\nthus the Three Powers are complete in unity.\n\nHumanity, having stolen the beginning of all things,\nuses them unknowingly—\nbut those who know this attain longevity,\ntheir form unchanging, all transformations at peace.\n\nHumanity knows its spirit,\nbut does not know how its non-spirit makes it spirit.\n\nHumanity has thirty-six thousand spirit-lights—\nthus, when desires multiply, the spirit is exhausted,\nand it is no longer spirit.\n\nThe *Yì* says:\n*\"The unfathomable *Yin* and *Yang* are spirit—\nembracing the One and preserving the spirit is how one becomes spirit.\"*\n\nThe sun and moon have their numbers,\nthe great and small have their limits.\nFrom this, the Sage’s work arises,\nand divine clarity emerges.\n\nThe sun is the essence of *Fire*,\nmoving one degree per day and night;\nthe moon is the essence of *Water*,\nmoving twelve and a half degrees per day and night.\n\nThus the virtuous one steals the numbers of *Water* and *Fire*,\ntheir great and small movements,\nand attains extraordinary Sagehood—\nfrom this, divine light emerges.\n\nAs for stealing the mechanism,\nnone under Heaven can see or know it.\nThe virtuous one who obtains it preserves his life;\nthe petty man who obtains it risks his life.\nThus, to steal Heaven’s mechanism,\nthe workings of creation—\nthe foolish cannot see or know it.\n\nThe virtuous one attains it and returns to the true;\nthe petty man acts against it and perishes.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Three: Performing the Art**\n\nThe blind excel in hearing,\nthe deaf excel in seeing.\nCutting off the source of gain,\none’s use of a teacher is tenfold;\nthe blind and deaf excel in hearing and seeing,\nthus the root of gain is severed.\n\nIf humanity can focus the heart\nwithout abandoning the middle path,\nthe tenfold use of a teacher cannot compare.\n\nThree returns of day and night,\none’s use of a teacher is ten thousandfold.\nThe virtuous one focuses the heart,\nrepeating day and night in the three *Yang* periods,\nhis actions unbroken—\nthus his use of a teacher surpasses ten thousandfold.\n\nThe heart is born of things,\ndies in things,\nits mechanism lies in the eyes.\nWhen the heart is extinguished and the eyes do not gaze outward,\nlife and death are forgotten—\nthus the mechanism is forgotten.\n\nHeaven, though without kindness, gives rise to great kindness.\nHeaven, though silent, is without partiality in sun and moon.\nIf humanity can steal the bait of essence,\nattaining the art of immortality—\nthis is when kindness knows no end, and great kindness arises.\n\nSwift lightning and fierce winds—\nnone remain unmoved.\nWhen the will is singular and sincere,\nthus unmoved and still.\n\nSupreme joy overflows from nature,\nsupreme stillness brings purity.\nWhen nature is harmonious, it embraces the
