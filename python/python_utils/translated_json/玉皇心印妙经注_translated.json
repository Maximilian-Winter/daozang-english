  "full_translation": "**Commentary on the *Wondrous Scripture of the Jade Emperor’s Heart-Seal***\n\nThis is the transmission of the Jade Emperor’s heart-mind, passed down from sage to sage, sealing mind with mind. Through illumination and realization, all adhere to this principle. The Three Teachings do not transgress it—hence, it is called the *Heart-Seal*.\n\n**The Three Grades of Supreme Medicine**\nThe most exalted wondrous medicine has three grades—namely, the three kinds:\n**Spirit, qi, and essence.**\nThese are not minerals, alchemical arts, lingzhi mushrooms, or jade dust, nor are they external or common medicines. They are the primordial spirit, primordial qi, and primordial essence. Ordinary medicines may cure illness, but their reach is limited. This medicine preserves kalpas, delivers the world, and transforms boundless salvation—nothing compares to it, thus it is called *supreme medicine*.\n\n**Vague and indistinct,**\nseemingly existent yet not existent.\n**Dim and obscure,**\nseemingly absent yet not absent.\n**Fathomless and distant,**\nseemingly far yet not far.\n**Dark and profound,**\nseemingly near yet not near—\nas if unseen and unheard, yet seemingly seen and heard.\n\n**Preserve the nonexistent, guard the existent.**\nSecretly abide in emptiness, silently uphold wondrous being.\n**In an instant, it is accomplished.**\nOnce the supreme medicine is attained, one instantly ascends to the realm of sages.\n\n**Revolving wind blends in harmony—**\nthe cyclical wind of Xun merges with the hundred spirits.\n**A hundred days, and the work is efficacious.**\nIn three months, the foundation is laid; the work gradually becomes mystically potent.\n**Silently pay homage to the Supreme Emperor—**\nthe cosmos is tranquil and steadfast; secretly venerate the Primordial Sovereign.\n**In one cycle, one ascends in flight.**\nTwelve years, and the cinnabar spirit takes flight. Another saying: one sheds the twelve links of conditioned existence before ascending.\n\n**Those who know awaken easily—**\nthose with true knowledge readily grasp the foundation of the supreme medicine.\n**The ignorant struggle to practice.**\nThe foolish find it difficult to uphold the principle of preservation and abiding.\n\n**Treading the radiance of heaven—**\nwhen the cosmos is settled, the radiance of heaven emerges, and one’s feet tread the root of heaven.\n**Inhaling and exhaling nurtures purity—**\ntrue qi flows and reflows, nourishing the mysterious and pure.\n**Emerging from the mysterious, entering the feminine—**\nknowing the celestial valley’s primordial spirit, one emerges from the mysterious and enters the feminine.\n**As if vanished, as if present—**\nneither scattered nor forcibly retained—\nas if vanished, as if present.\n\n**Continuous and unbroken—**\nsilently, ceaselessly, from beginning to end.\n**Firmly rooted, deeply grounded—**\nthe root of nature and the stem of life are wondrously cultivated and deeply secured.\n\n**Each person possesses essence—**\nevery person has the most true and authentic essence.\n**Essence unites with spirit—**\ntrue essence wondrously merges with primordial spirit.\n**Spirit unites with qi—**\nprimordial spirit wondrously merges with true qi.\n**Qi unites with the true body—**\nprimordial qi wondrously merges with one’s utmost true body.\n\n**If one does not attain this truth,**\none does not attain the utmost truth of the body.\n\nAll are forced designations.\nTo claim one has obtained the elixir is but a forced designation.\n**Spirit can enter stone—**\nspirit enters metal and stone without obstruction.\n(Another version: \"To penetrate mountains and pass through stone without fail.\")\n**Spirit can make the body fly—**\nrefining spirit to return to emptiness, the body naturally ascends.\n**Entering water without drowning—**\none with the Dao is not swept away by water.\n(Another version: \"Unstained by desires is not to drown.\")\n**Entering fire without burning—**\none with the Dao cannot be consumed by fire.\n(Another version: \"Free from anger and delusion is not to burn.\")\n\n**Spirit depends on the body’s formation—**\nthe body takes form, and spirit arrives; thus, spirit depends on the body’s formation.\n**Essence depends on qi’s fullness—**\nwhen qi is replete, essence is complete; thus, essence depends on qi’s fullness.\n**Neither withering nor decaying—**\nwhen spirit, qi, and essence are whole, bound without dissipation, they neither wither nor decay.\n**Like the verdant pine and cypress—**\never unchanging, like the pine and cypress, evergreen.\n\n**The three grades share one principle—**\nthe three grades of supreme elixirs share a single root and principle.\n**Too wondrous to be heard—**\nthe profound mystery of the Double Mystery cannot be grasped by hearing.\n**When gathered, it exists—**\nthrough diligent preservation and silent guarding, the wondrous gathering brings it into being.\n**When scattered, it dissipates—**\nwhen the wondrous intent scatters, it swiftly withers and fades.\n\n**The seven apertures are interconnected—**\nthe true seven apertures—ears, eyes, nose, and mouth—are internally linked.\n(Another version: \"The seven apertures reside within.\")\n**Each aperture radiates light—**\nwind and clouds issue forth, and each aperture shines with light.\n(Another version: \"Each possesses the celestial light of treasured brilliance.\")\n**The sacred sun and sacred moon—**\nthe body’s true yin and true yang, eternally luminous and indestructible; thus, the sacred sun and sacred moon.\n**Illuminating the Golden Court—**\nlight shines upon the cinnabar terrace and purple palace, said to illuminate the Golden Court.\n\n**Once attained, forever attained—**\ntrue attainment of real benefit is never lost or destroyed.\n\nThe body naturally becomes light.\nLightness of body means returning yang, transmuting bones, and reverting to emptiness—this is not merely physical health.\nGreat harmony overflows,\nthe true qi of great harmony fills and brims over.\nThe bones scatter like cold jade.\nWithin the yellow center, the principle is penetrated; the bones stand tall, the spirit rejoices, jade and gems fall away, leaving golden sinews and jade bones.\nAttaining the elixir grants numinosity,\nwhen the luminous medicine obtains the elixir, the mortal becomes numinous.\nFailing to attain it leads to ruin.\nWithout the true elixir, the beam collapses and the body topples.\nThe elixir resides within the body, neither white nor blue—\nnot the white of the lungs, nor the blue of the liver.\nRecite it ten thousand times,\nsilently revolve the true scripture ten thousand times, not merely reciting with the mouth.\nThe wondrous principle becomes self-evident.\nThe scripture’s wondrous principle suddenly becomes clear.\n\n*Commentary on the Wondrous Scripture of the Heart Seal of the Supreme Jade Emperor* concludes.\n\n**Text of Reverent Dedication and Repentance**\n\nTurning the heart toward the Dao, earnestly repenting past transgressions, and reforming to avoid future faults.\nThe dragon’s script and phoenix’s seal have already exhausted the sincerity of song and praise;\nthe crane’s carriage and simurgh’s chariot earnestly hope for the grace of observation and reflection.\nYour servant reverently burns true incense—cinnabar sincerity, celestial fragrance—\nand earnestly petitions the Treasures of Dao, Scriptures, and Masters, the Primordial Beginning and the Myriad Spirits, all the sagely perfected of the Jade Radiance Assembly.\nHumbly beseeching the gracious light, earnestly imploring witness and verification.\n\nYour servant, in the past, on behalf of so-and-so for such-and-such a matter, has recited several copies of the *Collected Scriptures on the Original Conduct of the Jade Emperor*, respectfully safeguarding so-and-so in such-and-such a matter, and so forth, proclaiming the myriad scriptures—daring not be anything but reverent.\nYet, hindered by karmic obstructions and demonic obstacles, the spirit and mind became disordered; the established roots were dull. Naturally, thoughts arose in confusion, omissions and mix-ups occurred, repetitions and inversions arose, and while composing the text, personal bias led to character errors and sentence misplacements.\nDeviating from the correct sounds of purity and turbidity, sinking into the perverse views of misinterpretation.\nAffairs distracted the will, the heart was not in the scriptures.\nInquiries about well-being were cut off and estranged.\nLong recitations grew lax, anger arose due to circumstances.\nSolemn purity was sometimes tainted by dust and filth; reverence was sometimes marred by irreverence and negligence.\nThe body, mouth, and use of objects were impure; attire, crowns, rites, and manners were irreverent.\nOfferings did not conform to the rites; the place was unsuitable; scrolls were crumpled and disordered, falling and becoming damaged.\nLacking focus and reverence, great shame and remorse arise.\nProstrate, I pray for compassion and mercy, forgiveness of transgressions, that recitation and upholding may reach the threshold of resonance.\nMay all prayers and wishes be as the heart desires.\nYet, I fear that transmission of the scripture may have been erroneous, and transcription may contain many mistakes.\nThe masters and recipients alike all repent.\nBy the power of the Dao, may sins be eradicated, may the Dharma wheel turn constantly, and may all beings be universally delivered.\n\nFor the sake of all the above, I bow my head and invoke the Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Most Real Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures, the True Writings and Treasured Talismans, the Three Supreme Ones of the Great Dao, the Sagely Hosts of the Ten Directions, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center,\nand the innumerable hosts of immortals within the Jade Scripture, whose merits are inconceivable.\n\n*Text of Repentance for the Collected Scriptures on the Original Conduct of the Supreme Jade Emperor* concludes.",
