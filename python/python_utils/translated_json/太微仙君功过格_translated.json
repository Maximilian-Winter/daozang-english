  "full_translation": "**The Merit-Demerit Ledger of the Most Supreme Perfected Lord**\n\n**Title:** *The Merit-Demerit Ledger of the Most Supreme Perfected Lord* (1 fascicle)\n**Source:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, Precept Category\n\n---\n\n### **Preface to the Merit-Demerit Ledger of the Most Supreme Perfected Lord**\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: *\"The family that accumulates goodness will surely have abundant blessings; the family that accumulates evil will surely have lingering misfortune.\"* The Daoist scriptures say: *\"Accumulating goodness brings forth auspicious rewards; committing evil incurs calamitous retribution.\"* Thus, the teachings of Confucianism and Daoism are not different in essence.\n\nIn ancient times, sages, noble gentlemen, and lofty Daoist adepts all composed covenants and precepts. Internally, they purified their minds and refined their conduct; externally, they instructed others, thereby establishing their meritorious deeds. In the *xinmao* year of the Dading era, at the hour of *zi* on the second day of the second lunar month, I dreamed of wandering through the Purple Palace and paying homage to the Most Supreme Perfected Lord. There, I received the *Merit-Demerit Ledger* and was instructed to transmit it to those of sincere faith.\n\nSuddenly awakening from the dream, I pondered the merits and demerits, their categories vivid and distinct in my mind. Rising at once, I donned my robe, sat upright, and reflected in silence. Realizing this was a revelation from a lofty immortal, I dared not be negligent. Adjusting my attire and cap, I washed the inkstone, spread out the paper, and swiftly transcribed it all—completed in an instant, as if without conscious thought, untouched by deliberate intent. Thus were set forth thirty-six articles of merit and thirty-nine articles of transgression, each divided into four gates, to clarify the reckoning of merit and demerit. This is entrusted to the practitioners of the Dao, who shall record their daily deeds, tallying merits and demerits monthly in a minor review and annually in a major reckoning. They will thereby know the measure of their merits and transgressions, which shall align precisely with the celestial tally of the Perfected Ones above, with no discrepancy.\n\nIn general, at the end of each day, recording merits comes easily, while recording transgressions is difficult. Even the wise, though they may suddenly awaken to the causes and conditions of sin and fortune, the gates of good and evil, may understand half but remain wholly lacking in caution. By adhering to this practice, turning away from evil and advancing in goodness, one holds to true precepts, and the way to immortality is not far.\n\n**Preface by Youxuanzi of the Wuyou Pavilion, Huizhen Hall, Western Mountain**\n\n---\n\n### **The Merit-Demerit Ledger of the Most Supreme Perfected Lord**\n\n#### **Thirty-Six Articles of Merit**\n**1. Gate of Salvation and Relief (12 articles)**\n**2. Gate of Teaching and Scriptures (7 articles)**\n**3. Gate of Ritual Devotion (5 articles)**\n**4. Gate of Practical Affairs (12 articles)**\n\n#### **Thirty-Nine Articles of Transgression**\n**1. Gate of Inhumanity (15 articles)**\n**2. Gate of Unwholesomeness (8 articles)**\n**3. Gate of Injustice (10 articles)**\n**4. Gate of Improper Conduct (6 articles)**\n\n---\n\n### **Instructions for Upholding the Dao**\n\nAlways keep brush, ink, and ledger by the head of your bed. At the start of each month, record the month and day. Beneath each day, draw two columns for merit and demerit. Before retiring at night, record all good and evil deeds of the day, matching them to the categories and quantities in this ledger. For good deeds, mark under merit; for evil, under demerit. One must not conceal transgressions while highlighting merits.\n\nAt month’s end, tally the total merits and demerits. Compare them: either offset merits with demerits or demerits with merits. The remaining balance reveals the net merit or demerit. Record this total, then proceed to the next month. At year’s end, conduct a major reckoning. One will thereby know one’s karmic fortune and misfortune, without need to inquire of omens.\n\n---\n\n### **Thirty-Six Articles of Merit**\n\n#### **Gate of Salvation and Relief (12 articles)**\n1.

Gate of Practical Affairs (12 articles)**\n\n#### **Thirty-Nine Articles of Transgression**\n**1. Gate of Inhumanity (15 articles)**\n**2. Gate of Unwholesomeness (8 articles)**\n**3. Gate of Injustice (10 articles)**\n**4. Gate of Improper Conduct (6 articles)**\n\n---\n\n### **Instructions for Upholding the Dao**\n\nAlways keep brush, ink, and ledger by the head of your bed. At the start of each month, record the month and day. Beneath each day, draw two columns for merit and demerit. Before retiring at night, record all good and evil deeds of the day, matching them to the categories and quantities in this ledger. For good deeds, mark under merit; for evil, under demerit. One must not conceal transgressions while highlighting merits.\n\nAt month’s end, tally the total merits and demerits. Compare them: either offset merits with demerits or demerits with merits. The remaining balance reveals the net merit or demerit. Record this total, then proceed to the next month. At year’s end, conduct a major reckoning. One will thereby know one’s karmic fortune and misfortune, without need to inquire of omens.\n\n---\n\n### **Thirty-Six Articles of Merit**\n\n#### **Gate of Salvation and Relief (12 articles)**\n1. Using talismans, acupuncture, or medicine to save a person from a grave illness earns ten merits; for a minor illness, five merits. If accepting bribes from the patient’s family, no merit is granted. The same applies to treating demonic afflictions.\n2. Each successful treatment earns one merit; administering one dose of medicine earns one merit.\n3. Transmitting one talisman, one method, one prescription, or one technique to enable others to accumulate deeds and save lives earns ten merits per technique. If accepting bribes to transmit or causing the recipient to accept bribes, no merit is granted.\n4. Transmitting talismans, methods, prescriptions, or techniques for preserving life earns five merits per act. If accepting bribes to transmit, only one merit is earned.\n5. Saving a person from execution earns one hundred merits; sparing a life sentenced to death earns one hundred merits; reducing a death sentence earns fifty merits. Saving a person from penal servitude earns forty merits; sparing one from penal servitude earns thirty merits; reducing penal servitude earns twenty merits. Saving a person from caning earns ten merits; sparing one from caning earns eight merits; reducing caning earns six merits. Saving a person from flogging earns five merits; sparing one from flogging earns four merits; reducing flogging earns three merits.\n   - *\"Saving\"* refers to cases where one is not the presiding official but exerts utmost effort to rescue.\n   - *\"Sparing\"* refers to cases where one is the presiding official and deliberately exempts the punishment.\n   - If the sentence is lawfully determined, no merit is earned. For privately reducing or exempting punishments of servants or slaves, merits are calculated likewise.\n6. Saving the life of an animal belonging to someone capable of repayment earns ten merits (e.g., camels, mules, oxen, horses, donkeys).\n7. Saving the life of an animal belonging to someone incapable of repayment earns eight merits (e.g., wild birds and beasts). Saving the life of insects, ants, flying moths, or creatures born of moisture earns one merit per life.\n8. Relieving widows, widowers, orphans, the childless, or the destitute with one hundred coins earns one merit; with one string of coins (one thousand), ten merits. If distributing one coin at a time, accumulating to one hundred earns one merit. For rice, wheat, silk, cloth, clothing, or other goods, merits are calculated by monetary value. Forgiving the debts of the poor is likewise calculated.\n9. Providing one drink or one meal to the hungry and thirsty earns one merit.\n10. Sheltering the cold and freezing in a warm room for one night earns one merit.\n11. Relieving the exhaustion of humans or animals for one hour earns one merit.\n12. Burying unclaimed bones earns fifty merits; providing land for a landless family to bury their dead earns thirty merits. If requiring payment of rent or taxes, no merit is granted.\n13. Burying the carcasses of wild beasts, birds, or livestock earns one merit per life. Burying the bones of birds, beasts, or livestock earns one merit per sixteen pounds.\n14. Leveling treacherous or obstructed roads, or filling muddy or waterlogged paths, earns ten merits per person per day. Building boats or bridges for ferrying others without seeking bribes earns one merit per one hundred coins spent; ten merits per person per day.\n\n*(Continued in the original text with remaining articles of merit and all articles of transgression.)*",
