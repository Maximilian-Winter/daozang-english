  "full_translation": "**The \"Valley Spirit Rhapsody\"**\n*Annotated by the Recluse of Tianshui, Zhao Daxin*\n\n**Title:** *Valley Spirit Rhapsody*\nOne fascicle, composed by Zhao Daxin of the Song Dynasty.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Section of Cavernous Truth*.\n\n---\n\nThe Dao resides solely in the Valley Spirit,\nWhose numinous essence blends with the primordial;\nNestled within the womb, its nature remains whole.\nWhen the image and method first arise, they begin as one—\nThe valley’s echo responds from the Three Fields,\nDwelling at the Gate of the Mysterious Female.\n\nWhen the Mysterious True first stirs, the Female Gate opens,\nIts nature uniting with the Central Palace, called the Nurtured Child.\nQi follows qi, departing through the constructive and defensive,\nWhile spirit drives spirit, returning to the orifices.\nBy containing it, the Three Passes remain undying.\n\nTo contain the Mysterious Nurturance is to seal the Celestial Pass,\nUnfettering the numinous root to follow nature’s law.\nWhen breath cycles divide, know the latter breath;\nThe source returns whence it arose, back to its origin.\nThrough skillful nurturance, the singular qi endures forever.\n\nThis enduring singular qi is named the Spirit Metropolis,\nModeling the Three Powers to issue wondrous talismans.\nThe Mysterious Method but adheres to the Three Sages’ principles—\nHow could the Cavern Heavens possess divergent paths?\n\nWithin qi lies essence:\nWithin qi lies treasure—true essence,\nWhich may be sealed and stored, free from craving.\nAs water is in fish and fish in water,\nSo essence is in man, and man attains life.\nOne must guard the black to know the white.\n\nKnowing the white, guard the black—black becomes the minister;\nKnowing the black, guard the white—white is the sovereign.\nWhen sovereign and minister harmonize,\nThe hun and po remain in the body for a thousand years.\n\nTurning outward, there is nothing—\nWithin purity, the external becomes spiritually permeable.\nTruly, one who upholds this refuses to comply.\nAwakening to the dream-body as but a dream,\nDo not let true qi mingle with perverse winds.\nSimply secure the stem to deepen the root.\n\nThe deep root and firm stem originate from the womb,\nEndowed by heaven and earth at birth.\nWhen the two qi do not intermingle yet resonate,\nWithin the Three Fields dwells a single mediator.\n\nNow consider:\nThe myriad things, teeming, each return to their source—\nTruly, this is the Cavern Heaven.\nShould one mistake the Maiden for true defense,\nThe years of cultivation are squandered in vain.\n\nEmerging from the Rare and Subtle,\nWithin the subtle lies treasure, though the rare is formless.\nThrough inhalation and swallowing, the clam yields a pearl.\nWhen yin reverts to yang, the spirit-fetus coalesces;\nIn the profound obscurity, the method is complete.\nThis resides in the essential and wondrous.\n\nTo preserve it, first purify the hundred spirits,\nAbiding in emptiness until phenomena take shape.\nThe essential and wondrous ever pervade exhalation and inhalation—\nBeware lest the mechanism leak the Mysterious Essence.\n\nThe valley, self-nurturing:\nWithin the valley’s echo, the spirit is most numinous,\nThe Cavern Heaven’s nurturance follows the method of Mysterious Jade.\nIf, after breath unites, one engages with external things,\nFrom this regulation, life is then beheld anew.\n\nWhen spirit stirs, the hundred joints align with principle;\nWhen the orifices open, true qi’s method endures.\nLet the Triple Burner not move ceaselessly,\nAnd the Five Viscera must guard against cold and heat’s harm.\n\nKnowing softness, conceal the shadow within the central void—\nKnowing softness, the sagely canon’s principles align.\nThe subtle and wondrous spirit communicates through qi.\nIn the Mysterious Discourse, within emptiness, grasp the image;\nThe immortal scriptures repeatedly record the Dharma-gate’s emptiness.\n\nSkillfully sealing and containing light, inwardly radiant and unified—\nSkillfully sealing and containing light, a single path opens.\nThe numinous gate and womb coalesce, fourfold in material.\nThough inwardly luminous, with an aspiration for emptiness,\nOne must comprehend the self-arising of things within the womb.\n\nLife may be prolonged forever:\nFrom the original source of life, life arises anew;\nThe withered stem revives from the old stem’s glory.\nReverting to essence, it naturally penetrates transformation—\nWhat fear is there that the perfected infant will not be resplendent?\n\nDeath may be remedied:\nWhen the Six Qi give rise to illness, whence comes the affliction?\nCalming the spirit, the spirit stills, and qi returns to clarity.\nDiligently, in the tranquil night, commune with the numinous body—\nHow could the Three Worms ever assail the Five Phases?\n\nThough spoken of as spontaneous,\nSpontaneity is liberation, self-sustained.\nOnly then does the numinous root harmonize with the Dao’s subtlety.\nThe Four Images are well observed—like the toad’s principle,\nBeyond the third autumn’s curtain, the moonlight grows full.\n\nIn stillness and focus:\nWith sincere intent and a heart devoted to the Dao’s verdancy,\nEmptiness is wholly qi’s precedence.\nWhen the Mysterious Spirit attains the pursuit of true refinement,\nOne fathoms the most supreme Mystery within the Mystery.\n\nWithout great neglect, outwardly flourishing—\nDiligently practice, never abandoning the Mysterious Work.\nIn daily use, know that external things are permeable.\nA single treasury of dragon radiance returns to the pure chamber—\nIn the world, nothing remains, yet it may still be vast.\n\nSimply accumulate much to inwardly strengthen:\nAccumulating resolve, the inner is fortified.\nA single piece of true heart is the oceanic Dharma-source.\nNaturally attaining, one knows the child’s nature;\nWithout contrived wisdom, wisdom becomes complete.\n\nIf one can comprehend its containment of the true,\nThen life rests in oneself:\nSimply understanding the root’s Dao-nature as pure,\nUniting with the true, silently shadowing the body.\nQi augments qi, as it pertains to me;\nLife supplements life, yet no one is other than oneself.\n\nIf one does not know to guard the One,\nThen it is the Mystery within the Mystery.\nFrom ancient times, attaining the One is the Dao’s beginning.\nWithin the Mystery, the Three Powers mirror the Five Diagrams.\nThe adept must know spirit’s egress and ingress—\nThe method resembles the Mysterious Pearl, yet again mysterious.\n\nThus, contain it subtly, subtly—\nThe subtle Dao is truly subtle.\nOne qi calls, one qi returns.\nLike wind arising, clouds and mist respond,\nEven heaven cannot contravene this image.\n\nAbide in it silently, silently—\nDwelling in the Mystery, dwelling in the Dao’s time,\nSilent without speech, silent in upholding.\nFrom ancient times, those who attained it spoke of no attainment;\nTo expound or elaborate is not the person’s way—crossing into calamity.\n\nQi employed in myriad ways seeks dissolution—\nQi used in myriad forms begets toil.\nOriginally pure and quiescent, free from grease and fat.\nThe spirit’s visage, ancient in countenance, preserves the True One;\nWhen the primordial chaos opened, it was once refined.\n\nSevering profit, unifying the source to take as principle—\nPreserving the primordial chaos’s embryonic moisture, deepening the root,\nWhen the clear opens, the method naturally rounds.\nLet the will’s path adhere to the Three Sages’ principles;\nThe immortal scriptures guard the secret—a single subtle word.\n\nThe heart is the pivot, the eyes are thieves:\nThe pivot desires to generate myriad things,\nThe heart admits perverse winds, the eyes rely on their brightness.\nScenery and colors cannot admonish themselves—\nIn a fleeting instant, another floating life slips away.\n\nIndulging in desires without seeking—\nWhen desire opens perverse intent, the heart’s gate stirs.\nThe original spirit scatters and disorders—how can nature be at peace?\nAll creatures, wriggling, become objects of delight;\nTo seek such delight is indeed difficult.\n\nThus, the cultivation of the true is unattainable:\nThe hun wanders nightly, the po returns to the body,\nLifetime after lifetime, teeming, desiring to learn the true.\nHow could the supreme Dao instruct one to be ensnared by form?\nIn the dusty world, true persons are everywhere.\n\nObserve how all things bear yin and embrace yang—\nOnly after traversing the Three Purities does one enter the Emperor’s Realm.\nIf purity and stillness know the divine’s later use,\nThose who attain it will surely freeze the heart’s motion.\nHeaven endures, earth abides.\n\nYin and yang contain qi in perfect balance,\nOnly then does one realize heaven’s eternity and earth’s constancy.\nDeep in the grotto, luminous clarity shines bright,\nEmerald light in autumn’s hue, the moon vast and pale.\nThose lost in the grotto may seek it by a path—\nTo lose the grotto, follow the Jasper Jade Stream,\nWhere immortals transform gold from clay.\nTo know where sacred traces transmit the truth,\nA single tree where twin wild cranes alight.\n\nThose blocked have no way to depart—\nWithout root, wisdom lacks acuity;\nThe ear must listen much, lest wisdom grow deaf.\nHemp grows straight when bound to flax,\nYet flax within hemp shares its nature.\n\nBehold the hidden sprouting of the crimson child—\nThe crimson child’s sprouting nature resembles infancy,\nAs sprouts follow the advent of true yang.\nIn the third spring, the hidden dragon stirs;\nWhen the Four Symbols converge, the White Tiger urges.\n\nRoaring yet not hoarse—\nMale and female roar, suppressing hoarse cries,\nDesire conjoins, yet first they swallow, restraining force.\nThe two qi do not bind to the womb’s fate,\nOnly then does one know the profound mystery of the True One.\n\nKnow the numinous tortoise to attain self-mastery—\nThe tortoise’s form aligns with heaven’s timing,\nThe dragon’s canopy, earth’s spirit, the foundation of ten thousand years.\nIf one knows the secret passage between above and below,\nThe crescent moon’s high and low are rare in the world.\n\nAbandon it, and it conceals itself—\nGrasp it, yet no form or substance can be sought;\nSeize it, and clouds and thunder stir without cease.\nApproach smoke and fire, dryness turns to damp;\nMoisture flows where it will, ever replenishing.\n\nContemplate the divine coagulation of the yellow orange—\nThe yellow coagulation is truly the Emperor’s head,\nSpirit resides in emptiness, qi gathers above.\nThe great Dao requires no labor to seek beyond,\nWhen principle penetrates the utmost extreme, what more is there to seek?\n\nExhort the dark pearl to grow everlasting—\nThe dark pearl and jade tree have roots,\nAble to be brittle or supple, their aspiration called rare.\nThose who awaken should hasten to retreat and hide,\nYet still harbor the urge to push others aside or prop them up.\n\nFocused use and nurturing containment—\nDivine use demands unwavering resolve,\nNurturing containment knows the gate of mysterious qi.\nThe dharma’s firmness and softness emerge and vanish together,\nOnly when the moment arrives can affairs be truly weighed.\n\nNever departing from resonance and shadow—\nLike echo to sound, like shadow to form,\nShadow and form are silent, echo alone gives voice.\nWhen the mechanism of the Dao is employed, not a single thing remains;\nYet when the image unfolds, the dharma’s essence naturally overflows.\n\nReturn to the jade essence within—\nQi’s jade essence wears snow as its robe,\nScholars may know it, yet not in fine detail.\nAsk the aspirant—does he lack profound aspiration?\nScant in the profound principle, how can he grasp its subtleties?\n\nHow could one born of doubt ever arise?\nFailing to comprehend pure discourse, the truth remains obscure,\nMisinterpreting the intent, all become lost wayfarers.\nWithout tranquility, how can one nurture virtuous resolve?\nHow could one forget intention and model the primordial spirit?\n\nExpounding beyond the dust—how could it be confused with stored thought?\nWhere no dust arises, no external filth exists,\nHow dare one mix purity and serenity with it?\nWhen storing and applying, attune to the seasons’ rhythms,\nYin and yang clash, striking forth as thunder.\n\nSeeing yet unseen, attaining it as if startled—\nWithin the image of the mysterious, no thing has form,\nYet the Dao and virtue naturally resound like an echo.\nFrom ancient times, the immortals’ intent remains unfathomable,\nCreation’s generation emerges from the boundless void.\n\nLaozi transmitted it to Yin Xi—\nDescending to the world, transmitting truth, styled the Great Immortal,\nAt the Pass of Han, stone walls held his bequeathed words.\nHow many have come and gone, attaining it?\nWest beyond the shifting sands, the dharma is natural.\n\nHuizi received it from Zhuangzi—\nHuizi’s learning was then not yet refined,\nOnly after awakening did he surpass Zhuangzi.\nIn a single leap, he entered the land of the mysterious origin,\nFor ten thousand ages, discoursing on the Dao’s nature.\n\nAh, the supreme Dao!\nNurturing spirit lies in the heart,\nImmortality rests with me.\nTo esteem it is not enough—again, one sighs—\nThe way of nurturing spirit is truly subtle.\n\nIf stillness and faith allow the exchange of precious qi,\nOthers may not know, but I know myself.\nBorn, one follows water; sprouting, one turns to fire.\nThe two sources of immortal water are hard to fathom,\nTidal waves of true flow are not easily traversed.\nOnce, at Black Horse Mountain, he met the Primordial Mother,\nWhat need has the Great Yin for the moon as its officer?\n\nIf one knows that movement leads to the realm of death,\nThen there is nothing that cannot be turned to what cannot be.\nFear the cultivation of the realm of death, be wary of indulging passion,\nCultivating fortune depends on this life.\nThe great Dao’s mysterious compassion knows no impossibility,\nReturning the hun-soul to preserve life, one attains longevity.\n\nThe *Ode to the Valley Spirit* concludes.",

depart—\nWithout root, wisdom lacks acuity;\nThe ear must listen much, lest wisdom grow deaf.\nHemp grows straight when bound to flax,\nYet flax within hemp shares its nature.\n\nBehold the hidden sprouting of the crimson child—\nThe crimson child’s sprouting nature resembles infancy,\nAs sprouts follow the advent of true yang.\nIn the third spring, the hidden dragon stirs;\nWhen the Four Symbols converge, the White Tiger urges.\n\nRoaring yet not hoarse—\nMale and female roar, suppressing hoarse cries,\nDesire conjoins, yet first they swallow, restraining force.\nThe two qi do not bind to the womb’s fate,\nOnly then does one know the profound mystery of the True One.\n\nKnow the numinous tortoise to attain self-mastery—\nThe tortoise’s form aligns with heaven’s timing,\nThe dragon’s canopy, earth’s spirit, the foundation of ten thousand years.\nIf one knows the secret passage between above and below,\nThe crescent moon’s high and low are rare in the world.\n\nAbandon it, and it conceals itself—\nGrasp it, yet no form or substance can be sought;\nSeize it, and clouds and thunder stir without cease.\nApproach smoke and fire, dryness turns to damp;\nMoisture flows where it will, ever replenishing.\n\nContemplate the divine coagulation of the yellow orange—\nThe yellow coagulation is truly the Emperor’s head,\nSpirit resides in emptiness, qi gathers above.\nThe great Dao requires no labor to seek beyond,\nWhen principle penetrates the utmost extreme, what more is there to seek?\n\nExhort the dark pearl to grow everlasting—\nThe dark pearl and jade tree have roots,\nAble to be brittle or supple, their aspiration called rare.\nThose who awaken should hasten to retreat and hide,\nYet still harbor the urge to push others aside or prop them up.\n\nFocused use and nurturing containment—\nDivine use demands unwavering resolve,\nNurturing containment knows the gate of mysterious qi.\nThe dharma’s firmness and softness emerge and vanish together,\nOnly when the moment arrives can affairs be truly weighed.\n\nNever departing from resonance and shadow—\nLike echo to sound, like shadow to form,\nShadow and form are silent, echo alone gives voice.\nWhen the mechanism of the Dao is employed, not a single thing remains;\nYet when the image unfolds, the dharma’s essence naturally overflows.\n\nReturn to the jade essence within—\nQi’s jade essence wears snow as its robe,\nScholars may know it, yet not in fine detail.\nAsk the aspirant—does he lack profound aspiration?\nScant in the profound principle, how can he grasp its subtleties?\n\nHow could one born of doubt ever arise?\nFailing to comprehend pure discourse, the truth remains obscure,\nMisinterpreting the intent, all become lost wayfarers.\nWithout tranquility, how can one nurture virtuous resolve?\nHow could one forget intention and model the primordial spirit?\n\nExpounding beyond the dust—how could it be confused with stored thought?\nWhere no dust arises, no external filth exists,\nHow dare one mix purity and serenity with it?\nWhen storing and applying, attune to the seasons’ rhythms,\nYin and yang clash, striking forth as thunder.\n\nSeeing yet unseen, attaining it as if startled—\nWithin the image of the mysterious, no thing has form,\nYet the Dao and virtue naturally resound like an echo.\nFrom ancient times, the immortals’ intent remains unfathomable,\nCreation’s generation emerges from the boundless void.\n\nLaozi transmitted it to Yin Xi—\nDescending to the world, transmitting truth, styled the Great Immortal,\nAt the Pass of Han, stone walls held his bequeathed words.\nHow many have come and gone, attaining it?\nWest beyond the shifting sands, the dharma is natural.\n\nHuizi received it from Zhuangzi—\nHuizi’s learning was then not yet refined,\nOnly after awakening did he surpass Zhuangzi.\nIn a single leap, he entered the land of the mysterious origin,\nFor ten thousand ages, discoursing on the Dao’s nature.\n\nAh, the supreme Dao!\nNurturing spirit lies in the heart,\nImmortality rests with me.\nTo esteem it is not enough—again, one sighs—\nThe way of nurturing spirit is truly subtle.\n\nIf stillness and faith allow the exchange of precious qi,\nOthers may not know, but I know myself.\nBorn, one follows water; sprouting, one turns to fire.\nThe two sources of immortal water are hard to fathom,\nTidal waves of true flow are not easily traversed.\nOnce, at Black Horse Mountain, he met the Primordial Mother,\nWhat need has the Great Yin for the moon as its officer?\n\nIf one knows that movement leads to the realm of death,\nThen there is nothing that cannot be turned to what cannot be.\nFear the cultivation of the realm of death, be wary of indulging passion,\nCultivating fortune depends on this life.\nThe great Dao’s mysterious compassion knows no impossibility,\nReturning the hun-soul to preserve life, one attains longevity.\n\nThe *Ode to the Valley Spirit* concludes.",
      "overlap_context": "n desire opens perverse intent, the heart’s gate stirs.\nThe original spirit scatters and disorders—how can nature be at peace?\nAll creatures, wriggling, become objects of delight;\nTo seek such delight is indeed difficult.\n\nThus, the cultivation of the true is unattainable:\nThe hun wanders nightly, the po returns to the body,\nLifetime after lifetime, teeming, desiring to learn the true.\nHow could the supreme Dao instruct one to be ensnared by form?\nIn the dusty world, true persons are everywhere.",
